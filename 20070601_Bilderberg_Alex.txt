[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]  Which will also be a global tax for those that don't know, a global tax on all maritime
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.240]  activities and put the UN over 74% of the Earth's surface.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.320]  Absolutely, and with the major surrender of sovereignty in the, well some international
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:28.840]  group, obviously under control of the UN, remember Clinton signed the Law of the Sea
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.840]  Treaty.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.480]  Stay there, stay there, Jim Tucker, we're going to come right back with a final segment.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.520]  This is the news he's getting from inside Bilderberg, with his sources he gets every
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.160]  year with infiltrators, after the people that work in the hotel see the open evil, the open
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.540]  discussion of world government and total enslavement, he then gets the inside intel.
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.320]  You're getting it here first, from Jim Tucker, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.760]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.040]  Storm is complete.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.880]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.760]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.920]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.160]  were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.240]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.480]  disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.760]  and much, much more.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.720]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.960]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.040]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.560]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.960]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.320]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.000]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.040]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.360]  molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.960]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.200]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]  filters.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.520]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.520]  cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.840]  metals and nitrates.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.840]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams and stagnant
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.840]  ponds.

[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.200]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.800]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.360]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360]  are synthetic.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.760]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.480]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.840]  coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840]  and mucous membranes.

[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.720]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.760]  a war on for your mind.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, Congressman Ron Paul on this show, May 31st, yesterday,
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.440]  it's now June 1st, said that if Rick Perry went to Bilderberg, he hadn't yet seen the
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440]  Dallas Morning News.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.880]  He said that that does look like a violation of the Logan Act, which is criminal, it's
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.600]  a federal felony, punishable by large fines and prison time.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.440]  He also said that it shows that he's definitely part of the, quote, one world government conspiracy,
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.720]  the plan for a one world government, that he's part of the international conspiracy.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.400]  And if you go up to PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com and especially JonesReport.com, just unbelievable
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.480]  reporting there, he will see all of this.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.880]  And of course, we also broke yesterday.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.640]  I'm so proud of this and so honored that Jim wrote this here, that it is confirmed
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.640]  and they finally reported today that it is the Ritz-Carlton there in Istanbul.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.320]  Jim has got sources inside.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.680]  Jim was getting into, which you could already see him starting to move towards publicly,
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.680]  capitulating.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.520]  Of course, they were just getting the Americans ready.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.920]  Bush was always 40-some back onto UNESCO three years ago, United Nations Educational and
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.480]  Cultural Organization.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.560]  They were getting us ready for this.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.120]  And we got the SPP.gov documents through a FOIA request last year, Judicial Watch, didn't
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.920]  it, said in there they were going to use global warming hysteria and fear.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.540]  They said use the fear to get a region-wide carbon tax.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.720]  Going back to Jim Tucker, please continue on that point, sir, and you were also getting
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.720]  into some other points.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:06:02.960]  Well, on the energy-related point, the U.S. was told to increase to high gasoline taxes
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:10.040]  enough to make the prices to exceed $4 a gallon at least.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.200]  They prefer it to be about $5 a gallon.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:22.920]  And that would be, of course, to reduce carbon monoxide emissions and make us all healthier,
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920]  see.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:30.640]  Now, before we laugh at this proposal, with the boot of America paying record high gas
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:38.760]  taxes now adjusted for inflation, consider that in the early 80s, the Junior Varsity
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.640]  Trilateral Commission meeting in San Francisco called for an increase in gasoline taxes,
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.760]  a federal gas tax increase of $0.10 a gallon.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:55.880]  Shocking to most Americans at that time because that was another one of those get in line
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:02.080]  and wait for gas at sky-high prices time.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.880]  So you'd think offhand that they politically could not do that.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.160]  Now, the Trilateral Commission meeting ended with farewells on a Monday morning.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:19.280]  All the work done, they tell each other goodbye on Monday morning and head for the airport.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.720]  On Tuesday, the Bilderberg-controlled Washington Post in its editorial, not some op-ed column
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:31.400]  given its opinion, but the official position of the Bilderberg-controlled Washington Post
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:38.840]  on Tuesday, in the editorial, called for a gas tax increase of $0.10 a gallon, and it
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.040]  came to pass.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:49.240]  So let's not take this too lightly.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.240]  Now-
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.240]  Now, before the break, Jim, you were trying to get into Bill Clinton.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.000]  You were saying, remember Bill Clinton in connection with law of the sea treaty, which
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.560]  allows the UN to seize 70-plus percent of the Earth's surface, of course being the
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.840]  oceans and seas of the world, and inland seas, and being able to levy taxes and have paramilitary
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.760]  global coastguards running around controlling everyone.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.680]  This is a massive grab, just like the Pentagon has claimed total dominance and ownership
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.680]  of space.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.120]  In fact, that's the official position of our government is ownership of the entire universe
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.120]  now.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.680]  They've told any other government they can't get up there.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.160]  This is all for dominance and control.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.840]  Nobody cared when Spain claimed the New World for themselves, along with Portugal, but that
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.720]  certainly meant something down the line.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.360]  Now with society being accelerated and everything happening, instead of over 100 years, the
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.160]  change that happened in 100 years is now happening in a year.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.520]  This is very, very serious to anyone who's going to be alive in just 10 years.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.160]  So please get back into law of the sea, sir, what the intel you're getting from inside
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.160]  Bilderberg.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:02.320]  Remember that Reagan denounced it with humor and would not sign off on it.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:11.920]  The original, even though he is under Bilderberg control, did not dare push it too hard in
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.440]  his term, and Bill Clinton signed it and told us how wonderful it would be.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:22.000]  Of course, Bill Clinton was anointed by Bilderberg when he attended their meeting in Baden-Baden,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.440]  Germany in 1991, and he tells us what a wonderful thing it will be.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:33.080]  So the city's had a test, what they call it, on ratification, and it was rejected 95-0.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:42.280]  So Clinton pulled back his request for ratification, for political reasons obviously, on the treaty
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.280]  he had signed off on.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:52.880]  That was before the 9-11 police state agenda, where 9-11 used to do absolutely anything
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.600]  and everything, and that was before the fake man-made global warming hysteria, where we've
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.600]  got to turn everything over to the UN, and man-eating meat, and restricting people to
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.360]  one family, one child, that's all being called for right now.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.600]  The Chinese model is the new world order model.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:15.400]  Jim Tucker, any other key tidbits you're getting from your sources inside Bilderberg?
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.920]  Domestically, that's about it.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:29.280]  The fact that Little Bush is going to embrace the Law of the Sea Treaty is something that
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.840]  will have to emerge in the fullness of time, and the KEP press also, but you heard it here
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.840]  first.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.920]  And of course, you heard it here first that they were not going to attack Iraq in 02,
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.520]  as the Washington Post said they were, and as the media unanimously said it was going
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.280]  to be 03, you said that we heard it here first from you, Jim, on the Berlin Wall was going
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.000]  to fall on a staged event.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.800]  We heard it here first on every single issue, these guys pull the shots, Jim told you three
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.240]  years ago, they were going to double oil prices, it indeed happened, these guys are setting
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.240]  the policy.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:08.320]  Jim, on a whole separate issue, just on media coverage, it is in newspapers globally.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.600]  I did a search under Bilderberg on Google News this morning, and I came up with hundreds
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.800]  of hits.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.800]  We see exponential coverage of this from ten years ago, the media said it didn't exist,
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800]  seven years ago they said it didn't exist.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.720]  No, you don't know the American media, because I've not seen an American newspaper since
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720]  left Washington.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:31.000]  Yes, the Dallas Morning News front page, many other U.S. newspapers front page, magazines
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.760]  Jim, some of the top movies at the box office make jokes about Bilderberg.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.320]  It's just all of a sudden, it's all over Texas television, we have video clips up on PrisonPlanet.com
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.560]  from News 8 Austin, there's also a Dallas piece, I'm told the Senate.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:50.800]  It's wonderful, this breakthrough, because you know as well as I do about the near total
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.640]  blackout we've had in the United States, while the European newspapers and broadcasters have
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.640]  had a lot of fun.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:04.080]  I've had very few moments today when I'm not staring into somebody's camera and yacking
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.080]  away.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.080]  Well see that's the difference, I mean before when you were doing this 30 years ago and
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.920]  physically what at 29 of these meetings Jim?
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.920]  Something like that.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.880]  So I mean literally five, six, seven, eight years ago it didn't exist, then last year
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.360]  in Canada because they arrested me and a few other things, it blew up nationally there,
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.280]  but it never really been in our press now for the first time Jim, and again you get
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.920]  most of the credit on this, it is everywhere, do you think they're happy about this?
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:38.240]  Oh they're, they've got their knickers in not to be sure, because their salad years
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.600]  was when they could be absolutely secret and deny their very existence, and they're doing
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:50.360]  everything stupidly perhaps to try to suppress coverage like the lie they planted in that
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.240]  newspaper story we talked about yesterday, six paragraphs deep inside the paper, very
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:02.480]  polite and saying it was going to, they classed as a resort, but there's also big Turkish
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.160]  papers saying big deal, so they're world leaders meeting, the point is they tried to keep it
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.240]  secret all these years, we've gotten their minutes, we know they're securing global events,
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.120]  we know that they are very corrupt, Jim what type of security did you see outside of the
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.120]  Ritz-Carlton?
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:30.360]  Typical, tremendous show of uniformed police, of course armed, surrounding the whole hill,
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.680]  of course many of them at the front gate, but then you don't take three steps without
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:40.960]  a couple of cops confronting you as you walk all the way around that hill.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.440]  So it's a lot heavier than Canada?
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.960]  I'm trying to remember Canada, well yes it was heavier than Canada, and of course they
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:54.680]  had the guys on the top of the roof with their binoculars, and our photographer thinks he's
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:02.760]  able to shoot David Rockefeller, when he blows his photographs up he'll be sure, but so far
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:08.720]  they've tried to keep the list secret, but we've just got all of them accounted for,
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:15.120]  and they may end up putting you on our website save Monday just to get rid of the questions
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.680]  and all that jazz, but I'll bet you we've identified people that they will not put on
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:26.000]  that website that were confirmed by, their presence was confirmed by our site.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.640]  By that you mean there's always people who are there who aren't on the list, how big
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:36.200]  is this to have Rick Perry, by the way who's embroiled, a Bilderberg member by the way
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:43.000]  has been indicted in connection to literally the biggest takeover of government and private
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.400]  owned power plants in Texas that's powering much of the surrounding states.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.760]  It's already been a big scandal, it turns out Rick Perry's involved in all that and
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.480]  with Bilderberg group members in the grabbing of 8,000 miles of roads, literally Bilderberg
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.800]  is grabbing the infrastructure of Texas, the fastest growing state in the union, the second
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.720]  most populous, what does this mean for Rick Perry, I mean is it that the positioning him
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.760]  for president later or is this more that he's just one of their gangsters?
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.880]  Well first of all as I mentioned yesterday was they would consider him a potential president,
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:21.520]  a useful cool and fool in the future and that he would not be invited next year if they
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:29.160]  decide to throw that shoe away because about 110 to 115 of the Bilderberg are the regulars,
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:36.160]  typically there's five or so newcomers most of whom are not invited back.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:42.160]  They had to see some potential for him to be their tool to invite him.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.600]  Jim I tell you what, we're scheduled to have reporters on, Jim stay there, let me talk
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.800]  to you during the break, we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen, we've got a big lineup
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.160]  of other reporters who've been there on the scene, we'll be right back, Jim stay there.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.160]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods you are not correctly attacking the
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.160]  cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:17.160]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning and the poisoning of your entire system are
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160]  totally unnecessary?
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:25.160]  But now it's cancer's turn to die with Lace Med Inc.'s patented methodology.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:31.160]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation we can destroy skin cancer and breast
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.160]  tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.160]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:53.160]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.LaseMedInc.com.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.160]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.160]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.160]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.160]  risks of deficit spending.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.160]  Therefore, with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.160]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.160]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160]  for immediate withdrawal.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.160]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.160]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.160]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.160]  for depositors.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.160]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.160]  inflation.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.160]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.160]  investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.160]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.160]  for over 6,000 years.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.160]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.160]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.160]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.160]  the market.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.160]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.160]  used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:15.160]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.160]  and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene and MTBE.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.160]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.160]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.160]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.160]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, Black Berkey elements are more economical than the
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:43.160]  standard disposable elements providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:51.160]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.160]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.160]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24,
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.160]  What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.160]  For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.160]  And there shall be famines, disease and earthquakes in many places.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.160]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.160]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.160]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:24.160]  Second Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.160]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.160]  The Bible says, We'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, the Unholy Alliance.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.160]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:44.160]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the New World Order, and much more.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.160]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.160]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:56.160]  That's 1-888-211-1715 and ask for Packet B.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:17.160]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:23.160]  Lading in the wings, we have American filmmakers Andrew Neal and Luke Meyer.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:30.160]  Also, Romanian filmmaker Paul Duranu and Daniel Estelhan coming up later.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.160]  This is just absolutely amazing.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.160]  And of course, Jim Tucker right now.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.160]  Jim, you said there's so much more.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.160]  And obviously, when you get back to town, we'll do a full hour and debrief you properly.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.160]  And American Free Press is going to have photos and articles about it.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.160]  So is PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.160]  But just in closing, before I go to these other reporters, Jim, I want to thank you for coming on.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:57.160]  I want to thank you for your 30-plus years of covering this, 29 years physically covering it.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.160]  What is it, 35 covering it total?
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.160]  You said there was a whole other European side.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:08.160]  Give us just a taste of some of the things that you're going to be writing about and some of the things you've learned from your sources.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:20.160]  Well, you've been reading about the Turkish troops massing on the border with Iraq to invade the Kurds in Iraq.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:37.160]  Well, they're always having Kurds engaging in incursions, so they've always got troops there.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.160]  Yeah.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:45.160]  The newspaper is all wrong about the massing on the border and the potential invasion.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:55.160]  Another Turk said that he didn't like to be portrayed as begging through the European Union
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:05.160]  and pointed out that a lot of Turks are opposed through the European Union because they'd have to surrender too much sovereignty.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.160]  And there's so many nationalists.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:15.160]  Well, nationalists, which is their synonym for patriots, are demeaned by a bilibur.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.160]  To be a nationalist, a patriot to your own country, you're horrible.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:33.160]  So they've had that kind of interchange to the Europeans supporting the invasion of Afghanistan.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.160]  Jim, what about Bush now saying he wants to bring U.N. troops and hand it over to I-4?
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:44.160]  Hasn't that been on the Bilderberg plate the last few years to kind of let the U.S. play the bad cop and the U.N. later comes in as the savior?
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.160]  Have you gotten any intel on that?
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.160]  Nothing this year so far, but I'll be back tomorrow.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:55.160]  I guess I better turn you over to those old-timers who've had some good adventures today.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.160]  Absolutely, Jim. Thank you so much. Are you still being followed?
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.160]  Okay, you're welcome.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.160]  They pointed out a different set of cops today.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.160]  All right, sir. We'll talk to you this weekend.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.160]  Very good. Have fun.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:15.160]  There goes Jim Tucker from his hotel in Istanbul, the Orient, and it's overlooking the nearby Ritz-Carlton.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:22.160]  We now go, we're about to break, but I want to go ahead and introduce them to Andrew, Neil, and Luke Meyer, and they're in a hotel room filled with other reporters.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.160]  Gentlemen, thank you for coming on.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.160]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex? Thanks for having us.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.160]  Thank you for coming on. What have you seen? What is this like covering Bilderberg?
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:37.160]  It's been pretty wild. We got here on Tuesday. Jim got here on Wednesday.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:47.160]  We came here to follow Jim's journey, and we've been with him pretty much every waking moment of the day when he's been on the move.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:56.160]  It's been pretty incredible. There's cops following him, and when we went over to the Ritz, it cordoned off the entire area.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.160]  With riot gear and things kind of roped up with barricades so you can't go on the sidewalk.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:07.160]  There were some guys with, like, submachine guns and stuff, and you couldn't even get close to it.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.160]  That's normal.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:15.160]  Yeah, no, for Luke and I, we'd never seen anything like this, so for us, it was kind of mind-blowing.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:21.160]  Well, I was about to add that that's happened every other time but when I went to Canada. Go ahead.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:29.160]  So, yeah, that was kind of a shock to us, and then we were in the car with Jim traveling around the city to be followed by police.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:35.160]  Certainly nothing that has ever happened to me before, and so it was kind of startling.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:42.160]  We got some good shots of that, and Jim is just kind of inspiring. He's still on the move.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.160]  I can't believe he's got the energy to keep going, practically got more energy than us.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:54.160]  But it's hard to see what's going on inside there. They seem to have established a really good perimeter, and it's all buttoned up.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.160]  We spent some time out in front.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.160]  What about all the entrances?
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:05.160]  Yeah, there was, like, three entrances that different people were going in, but we didn't see any.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.160]  We weren't able to get any clear shots of anyone in particular.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.160]  Is this Andrew or Luke I'm talking to?
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.160]  This is Andrew, sorry.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.160]  Okay, no, no, no. I just wanted to learn the voices. Okay, go ahead, Andrew.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:24.160]  So anyway, we kind of left with Jim, and then there's another filmmaker here, Paul, that's sitting in the wings.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.160]  Yeah, we're going to talk to him on the other side, but stay there. I want to talk to Luke, too.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.160]  Andrew, I just want to get your take on the whole experience, the press coverage, what's happening.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:39.160]  Talk about the film you're making about Jim Tucker, and we'll be right back on the other side. Stay with us.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:52.160]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:04.160]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water, a world in which our produce is grown naturally,
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.160]  without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.160]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:16.160]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver,
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.160]  which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:25.160]  With more than 500 vital functions, give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52,
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:30.160]  the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries,

[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:41.160]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol, and prescription medications.

[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.160]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.160]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.160]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Border back with the Divided Kingdom,
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.160]  the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:16.160]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts,

[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:04.160]  He's the T. Rex of political talk. Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:11.160]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:20.160]  I want to thank my producer, Trey Kincaid, and also my wife who's been producing, Violet Jones.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:25.160]  I want to thank everybody who's been joining us, Jim Tucker, Aaron Dykes for the stories he's been doing,
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:32.160]  Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Ryan Slickhuysen, everybody on the crew for doing such a fabulous job,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:38.160]  Mike Nelson, the list goes on and on. RIT people, everybody.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.160]  Going back to Istanbul, we're talking to American Documentary Filmmaking Crew,
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:48.160]  who are making a film, I guess, about people that cover these type of events.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.160]  Great guys, they called me a few months ago and I never got back with them, like everybody else I don't get back with,
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.160]  but now I'm definitely getting with them here on air.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.160]  And it's Andrew, Neil, and Luke Meyer, they're in Istanbul.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:05.160]  We really appreciate their work and they're in a hotel room with a Romanian filmmaker, Paul Duranu.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.160]  I believe that's the right way to pronounce it.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.160]  And we're just, again, very thankful to have them there with us from Istanbul.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.160]  Gentlemen, give us the lay of the land, what your trip was like getting over there,
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:20.160]  how the papers first reported that it was the classes to divert everybody.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.160]  Now that same paper's putting out disinfo pieces worshiping Bilderberg about how good they are.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.160]  And then just basically what you witnessed, how the riot police were dressed,
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.160]  and some of the physical things that you saw, because I know you're not really doing a thing on Bilderberg,
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.160]  you're doing it on people who cover Bilderberg.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:41.160]  But I think now it's just kind of convincing you about the wickedness of Bilderberg,
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.160]  to see all the security.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:49.160]  One of the most interesting things, I think, for Luke and I, and I guess Jim was talking about it some too,
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:54.160]  is that in America you really hear very little about these issues.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.160]  This is pretty newsworthy.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.160]  I mean, when Davos meets, and there aren't even as many elites there,
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.160]  I mean, this is the crème de la crème, Davos is a step below this,
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.160]  I mean, that's a big international spectacle.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.160]  Why isn't this news?
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.160]  Yeah, it was interesting.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:14.160]  Jim was saying that he felt as though there was a lot more coverage of it.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.160]  Oh, this is the breakthrough year.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.160]  I mean, last year was the break in the ice, and that got a hole in their armor,
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.160]  but that was the chink in the armor.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.160]  This year drove a huge spike right into their heart.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.160]  How is it being covered back in the States right now?
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.160]  It's all over the newspapers.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:36.160]  It's literally, I mean, we're talking about less than 20 mentions in the last 50 years in U.S. newspapers,
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.160]  and there's more than 20 articles and TV reports on it in just the last day.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.160]  So there's been more coverage in the last 24 hours in the United States
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.160]  than there has been on Bilderberg in the last 20, 30, 50 years.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.160]  That's amazing.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:56.160]  Yeah, well, there's an energy to it here as well, we felt.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:01.160]  I think obviously some of the people, some of the regulars that come from the United States
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:05.160]  or other parts in Europe probably weren't able to make it because of the travel expense,
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:12.160]  but there was a lot of buzz about it, and every day at 4, Jim is mobbed at his hotel.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.160]  People showing up, taking pictures.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.160]  I mean, he's practically like a celebrity here, and then we're running around after him too.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.160]  It's kind of a bit of a circus running around after Jim.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.160]  He's probably not as covert as he might be, but he still goes to meet his sources by himself.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.160]  Now, who are you guys making your film for?
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.160]  Because this is something I definitely want to carry when it comes out.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:39.160]  We're an independent production company, so we're trying to acquire funding for it,
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.160]  and we're getting going, trying to make a promo or whatever.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:50.160]  Basically, the film is about the people who are trying to bring the New World Order concept into the mainstream.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.160]  Our producer, Tom Davis, who worked on some of our other films,
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.160]  started talking to Luke and I about it, and we didn't know that much about it.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.160]  We got kind of interested in it, and then started surfing the web and stuff,
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.160]  and just started running into all the personalities who were doing it.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:13.160]  Well, I'm interested because you guys obviously came to this as virgins to it all.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.160]  Now, do you think it's nefarious? Do you think it's dark? Do you think it's happy-lovey?
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.160]  Well, it's definitely not happy-lovey.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:27.160]  I mean, there's a lot of policemen around, and you don't have any idea what's going on inside the gates.
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:35.980]  And then, you know, I started surfing the web and stuff, and just started running into
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.980]  all the personalities who were doing it, and saw all this stuff, and I was like, boy, this
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:39.980]  is crazy.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.580]  Well, I'm interested because you guys are, you guys obviously came to this as virgins
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.580]  to it all.
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.260]  Now, do you think it's nefarious?
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.260]  Do you think it's dark?
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.260]  Do you think it's happy-lovey?
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.700]  Well, it's definitely not happy-lovey.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:55.860]  I mean, there's a lot of policemen around, and you know, you just don't have any idea
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.940]  what's going on inside the gates.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:58.940]  I have a secret.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:33:59.940]  I only protect it.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.940]  Yeah, Lou, pop in and give us your take on all this.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.940]  Well, I mean, all I know is really what I'm seeing right now, and that's how full force
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:08.940]  the police exist.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.940]  Okay, that proves it's nefarious right there.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.940]  Then we get their minutes out of the meetings.
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:16.940]  They literally created the European Union.
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:21.940]  They ran the whole deal with Prince Bernhard and the royalty out of England.
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:27.020]  They ran the entire show, and they're trying to set up a world tax.
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.020]  My point is, is that there's no way to be neutral on this.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:35.020]  It'd be like being filmmakers, and either you're for Hitler or you're against Hitler.
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.020]  You know, you're either for Stalin or you're against Stalin.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.020]  And I understand you're trying to make an objective film about the movement and let
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.020]  people decide on their own.
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.020]  I'm not putting you on the spot.
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:47.020]  I'm just telling you, as human beings, can you not see who these people are?
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.020]  This is the enemy of humanity.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:54.100]  Yeah, well, we're really at the very beginning of our stages of getting to know this, and
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.100]  we're trying to get to know it through our characters.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.100]  But in my opinion, there's a lot of unanswered questions that over the course of the next
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.100]  year, I would hope I would get the answer to some of those.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:09.100]  And really, for me as a filmmaker, and I don't know, Luke, if you agree with me, but we're
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:16.100]  just really interested by basically you guys and the amount of work and effort that you've
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.180]  put into it, and what brought you to it.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:24.180]  Because no one was talking about it, you know, even five years ago.
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.180]  And there's been a small group of people that have been talking about it.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.180]  Well, listen, I'm finishing Endgame in the next month and a half.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:34.180]  If you guys want to come to Austin, Texas, and I've literally got selected...
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.180]  You would love to come.
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.180]  Sure, sure.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.180]  Well, I've got...
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.180]  I know you tried to contact me a few months ago and never got back with it because I'm
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.180]  flooded.
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:44.180]  But come to Austin, and if you want to do some limited footage swap, because I'm going
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.260]  to do an update in the film before I finish it, just about how Perry went.
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:52.260]  It's going to be like probably two minutes of my film that, oh, by the way, in 2007 Perry
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.260]  went.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.260]  But if you guys want any of my footage from last year, I'd be happy to swap it.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.260]  But it's got to be quick if we're going to do it, because Endgame is almost done.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.260]  But yeah, you guys turn around and get down here in Austin.
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.260]  Okay, cool.
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.260]  We'll be back early next week, so maybe we can get in touch with you then.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:09.260]  Yeah, basically, I've got pitcher Lockie in one month, and then I've got to have Graham
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.260]  Reynolds do the music.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.260]  He's already working on it, and I've got all the graphics houses.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.340]  I've got two different graphics houses doing graphics on it.
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.340]  I'm trying to up my films, and Terror Storm was the next level.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.340]  This is going to be the next level after that.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.340]  But the point is, you've got to rush down, and just a few selects of Jim being mobbed
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.340]  or the police, and then I'll be glad to give you guys quite a bit of my footage, because
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.340]  I'm all about getting the information out.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.340]  That way you'll have Canada.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:40.340]  But that aside, anything else you want to add before I get the Romanian filmmaker who's
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.340]  waiting in the wings on?
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:43.420]  Yeah, I mean, just one thing.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.420]  Maybe, Alex, you could give us some recommendations, and we'd love to talk to you too, but we're
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.420]  looking for more people.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:53.420]  Jim is obviously the oldest guy, but we're looking for younger guys who are also in the
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.420]  movie.
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.420]  Daniel Estolin, but you know, of course, he's got a sick family member.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.420]  This is the first time...
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.420]  Yeah, he couldn't make it this year, and we were looking forward to talking to him.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.420]  Yeah, first time in 15 years.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.420]  Yeah, that was unfortunate.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.420]  We were looking forward to talking to him, but maybe we'll get a chance to see him in
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.420]  the future.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.500]  Or maybe Bilderberg next year.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.500]  We've been thinking about trying to follow Jim.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.500]  Well, there's a fella in England who I've interviewed who has Bilderberg.org.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.500]  He'd be good to interview.
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.500]  Obviously, I'd be good to interview.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.500]  You've already been trying.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.500]  And then there's...
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:27.500]  I can think of just a few others, but there are quite a few.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.500]  I know Michael Piper's covered it quite a bit.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.500]  All right, cool.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.500]  We look forward to talking base with you next week, and do you want us to get Paul on the
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.500]  line here?
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.500]  Absolutely.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.580]  When are you guys flying out?
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.580]  Because I'd like to get a report from you guys Monday or Tuesday.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.580]  Kind of debrief you on air once you get back.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.580]  We're leaving Monday morning.
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.580]  I'm not sure the flight time, but sometime on Monday we'll be flying back.
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.580]  Okay, well, then that means I'll have to have you on Tuesday or Wednesday.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:56.580]  Let me just have my producer call you when this interview is over to make sure I've got
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.580]  all your contact points, not just there at the hotel.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.580]  Okay, cool.
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.580]  All right, great.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.580]  Should we just put Paul right on?
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:08.660]  Yeah, and is it correct to pronounce his name, Paul Dornanu?
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.660]  Dornanu.
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:11.660]  Dornanu.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.660]  Okay, thank you.
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:13.660]  Yes, put him on.
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:14.660]  Thank you.
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:15.660]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.660]  I appreciate you, Andrew Neal and Luke Meyer.
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.660]  Thank you for reporting for us from Istanbul.
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.660]  Okay, is this Paul Dornanu?
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.660]  Yeah, that's about right.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:31.660]  Hello, Paul.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.660]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.740]  Tell us about what you witnessed there and what your film is about.
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:40.740]  Well, I checked first thing in the morning, the Classics Hotel, because Jim Tucker had
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:46.740]  thought that that might be the actual site for the board meeting, and I went there, and
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.740]  there's nothing there.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:53.740]  Also, was picked by the lady in the lobby to go to the Classics Golf and Country Club,
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:59.740]  which is like 10 miles north from there, and I checked there, but still nothing there.
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:06.820]  So, everything happens at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel where, like the other guy said, basically
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:11.820]  it's packed with policemen, armed guards, securities.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:18.820]  I actually managed to get photos and video shots with people on the roof of a side of
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:25.820]  a building where there were securities, military men with binoculars, they were looking at
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.900]  me, and even civilians.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:35.900]  There were groups of people talking there on the roof, and basically I think we can
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:43.900]  get later a look at the pictures on the computer and see more details of what I got.
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.900]  Absolutely.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:49.900]  Pictures are now starting to come out online on different websites, different Turkish newspapers
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.900]  of the unusual suspects, David Rockefeller and others.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.980]  Have you been able to see Texas Governor Rick Perry yet?
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:56.980]  No, no, no.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:04.980]  I haven't been able to see anyone actually, but only got pictures of a black limo who
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:09.980]  entered the second gate, which is the gate on the street which is blocked, you can enter
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.980]  that street.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:16.980]  So, I think from this point of view, the Ritz-Carlton site is perfect for the situation because
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:21.980]  nobody can actually get very close to the main entrance.
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.060]  There's a large ground.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.060]  Tell us about yourself.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.060]  Is this your first time covering Bilderberg, Paul?
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:34.060]  Yes, this is the first time I have my own website which I launched a couple of weeks
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:37.060]  ago, info.com.ro.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.060]  Spell that out for people.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.060]  Spell out your website for us.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:44.060]  info.com.ro.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:49.060]  It's a new website, and I've been listening to your show and watching your websites for
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.060]  a couple of years now.
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.140]  Oh, fantastic.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.140]  So, you've been taking pictures and you're going to upload those to your website?
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.140]  Yes, yes.
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.140]  So, we'll try.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:01.140]  The problem is that here the Internet is very, very slow and wireless is not reliable.
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.140]  I understand.
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.140]  Well, listen, get those up as soon as you can and we'll post them as well if that's
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.140]  okay with you and write an article about it.
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:12.140]  Yeah, probably Sunday night when I get back to Bucharest because I drove here with a car.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:17.140]  Okay, spell that out slowly for people because if I had trouble covering it, others are.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.140]  Spell out your website for us.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:25.220]  info.com.ro.
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.220]  info.com.com?
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:31.220]  No, info.com.ro from Romania.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.220]  .ro.
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.220]  So, it's info.com.ro.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.220]  That's exactly it.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:39.220]  Okay, well, we'll be watching that Sunday and we'll do a report on it, sir.
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.220]  I mean, describe...
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.220]  Yes.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.220]  I was hearing that there are riot police out there.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:53.300]  Yeah, there's a lot of police and what I understand that they actually were afraid of riots
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:42:01.300]  because I understand that people, Turkish people, do easily get together and start riots
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.300]  and big meetings.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:10.300]  Actually, there was a couple of days ago a meeting in a square near the Brits Carlton
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:18.380]  hotel from an organization, I don't know the name, something like Global Peace and I don't
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.380]  remember exactly the name, but...
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.380]  Oh, that's major news.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.380]  Now, state that again.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.380]  Exactly what happened at the Brits Carlton?
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.380]  You're saying it was some type of protest?
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:34.380]  Yeah, there was a small protest, not at Brits Carlton, but in a square near Brits Carlton,
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:37.380]  not very far, like under one mile.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.380]  Really?
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.380]  People protesting?
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:40.460]  How many?
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:45.460]  Bilderberg and anti-nuclear things.
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.460]  Sure, how many people?
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:51.460]  I think there were like up to 100 people, something like that.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:55.460]  I'm not sure because I got late...
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:59.460]  That's got to be the biggest Bilderberg protest I ever heard of because they're so secret.
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:03.460]  Of course, 100 will probably be 10,000 next year wherever they have it.
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:10.540]  And after that it was a press conference in Turkish about this protest that was organized
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.540]  and Jim was there too.
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:16.540]  What inspired you to cover Bilderberg?
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:20.540]  Well, I think the same thing as you do.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:24.540]  I want people to find out about this stuff.
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:32.540]  Lots of people do not believe Bilderberg exists and it's a way where I can actually prove
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:36.620]  that they do exist, that there's something going on.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:42.620]  If I can describe this Bilderberg meeting is similar to a conference that has taken
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.620]  place in Bucharest in Romania in September.
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:54.620]  That is the Francophonic meeting where like presidents and ministers from a lot of countries,
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:44:01.620]  at least a couple of dozen countries, countries that do speak French came to Bucharest.
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:06.700]  So basically the parliament building where the meeting was sealed off, all the streets
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:12.700]  around it, lots of policemen, snipers on the buildings and so on.
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.700]  Is this freedom?
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:19.700]  Is this a free society with elites meeting in secret and our politicians present themselves
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:25.700]  like vegetables or fruit at a fruit stand to be squeezed on and smelled and examined
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.700]  to see which person they want to buy or back?
[00:44:28.779 --> 00:44:31.779]  There's no doubt they're setting global policies.
[00:44:31.779 --> 00:44:34.779]  No, clearly it's not a free society.
[00:44:34.779 --> 00:44:38.779]  We should know about what they are talking there because they are going there on our
[00:44:38.779 --> 00:44:39.779]  expenses.
[00:44:39.779 --> 00:44:44.779]  There are public figures which are elected by us.
[00:44:44.779 --> 00:44:48.779]  So we have to know what's happening there.
[00:44:48.779 --> 00:44:53.779]  I said public figures that were elected, not everyone is elected because let's consider
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:58.860]  Barroso which is the president of the European Commission.
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:06.860]  Barroso was just over here a few weeks ago with Bush openly announcing a merger of the
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:08.860]  EU and the American Union.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:13.860]  It was on C-SPAN and we wrote an article about it and people couldn't even grasp how big
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:14.860]  it was.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:18.860]  When I say a story is big folks, it's big and this stuff is just happening right out
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:19.860]  in the open.
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:23.940]  The world's sovereignty is dying, not with a bang, but with a whimper.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.940]  Well listen, we're going to watch your site, sir, and we'll get a report out on your
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:30.940]  photos as soon as that's okay.
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:35.940]  Is it all right with you when we link to your site because your site might crash if we send
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:36.940]  5 million people there?
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:39.940]  Is it okay if we go ahead and post your photos on prisonblinded.com?
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.940]  Yes, that's right.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:48.940]  I can get contact to you and send you a link where I can upload some good quality photos
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.020]  for you.
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.020]  Do that.
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.020]  Listen, Aaron at Infowars.com.
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:55.020]  He is the guy that's working the hardest right now in the organization.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.020]  Aaron, two A's.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.020]  Aaron at Infowars.com.
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:00.020]  Two A's.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:01.020]  Sure, we'll do that.
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.020]  Absolutely.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.020]  In fact, if you send them to us, we'll get them up and put a link to your site, sir,
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.020]  and of course we'll probably crash your site.
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:13.020]  My email is Paul at Infocon.com so you don't...
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.020]  Okay, well sure, we can just go to your site and contact you that way.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:18.020]  Then we will send you your contact, our contact info.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.100]  It's great working with you.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.100]  God bless you.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.100]  I look forward to interviewing you.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.100]  Thank you so much for having me on your show.
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.100]  You bet.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:28.100]  Let me just hand the phone back briefly, if you can, if they're still there, to Andrew
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.100]  Neal and the guys.
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:31.100]  I don't want to let them go quite yet.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.100]  Okay, Paul?
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.100]  Okay, okay.
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.100]  Thank you.
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:38.100]  And then we're scheduled to have Daniel Estolin on from Spain.
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:42.100]  He's got a family member who's very sick, but I want his analysis.
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.180]  He's one of the, I'd say the foremost analyst.
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.180]  He's the best-selling author of Club Bilderberg.
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.180]  We've got him coming up in the next hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.180]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.180]  I wasn't going to take a day of vacation.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.180]  Not doing it now.
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.180]  It's here.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.180]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.180]  complete.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:08.180]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:13.260]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:18.260]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.260]  were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:25.260]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:31.260]  disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information,
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.260]  and much, much more.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.260]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.340]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:42.340]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:59.340]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.340]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:07.420]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfalls, fish contamination advisories,

[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.500]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:01.580]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:06.580]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards,
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:10.580]  banking information, and more all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:15.580]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:19.580]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:24.580]  virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:30.660]  Put a stop to this right now with the NET7 Network Security Switch from NET7 Technologies.

[00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:02.740]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:08.740]  Live from Istanbul, ladies and gentlemen, we've interviewed Jim Tucker, we've interviewed
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:15.820]  Andrew Neal, Luke Meyer, Paul Daronneau from Romania, Daniel Estolans has a family member
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:20.820]  on death's doorstep, but he has still got great contacts inside.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:24.820]  He's the most informed on Bilderberg and covering for 15 years.
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:26.820]  He's going to be with us in the next hour.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:30.820]  We're about to go to him in about 60 seconds, but just saying bye to Andrew Neal and Luke
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:31.819]  Meyer.
[00:50:31.819 --> 00:50:36.819]  Gentlemen American filmmakers, were you able to see any of the Bilderberg group or is there
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.900]  just too much security this year?
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:45.900]  We were not able to see really anyone because the barricades are so far away.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.900]  I think they got really smart about how they let them in.
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:53.900]  I think they kind of just stagger it and stuff so you couldn't see.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:59.900]  There's no helipad, there's no motorcade of cars going in.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.900]  We were usually with Jim, but there were a couple of the...
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.980]  Paul for instance that was just on was out there all day and some of the other guys that
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.980]  were here chasing the Bilderbergers were also out there all day.
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:17.980]  I think they got a couple of pictures and I think you touched base with Paul and hopefully
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.980]  they'll be able to get you some stuff that you can use.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.980]  Absolutely.
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:24.980]  I want to thank you gentlemen for the great job you've been doing and I appreciate it
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.980]  and I look forward to debriefing and next week we'll talk then.
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:29.980]  Okay, cool.
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:30.980]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:31.980]  Take care and God bless.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:36.060]  Alright, now going to Daniel Estelon and coming up in the next hour, folks, I've got huge
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.060]  reports of my own with Rick Perry and massive corruption.
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:45.060]  This stuff, violating Logan Act, Bilderberg members that are under indictment that Perry
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.060]  is involved with in business.
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.060]  This stuff is huge.
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.060]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:54.060]  Daniel Estelon, I feel guilty, twisting your arm to come on with your mother-in-law in
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.060]  deep trouble, but we should all pray for her.
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.060]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:01.060]  Alex, great to be lightning back to your show and it's always a pleasure.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.140]  Well, thank you.
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:04.140]  I'm sad you can't be there, but you are still on the phone.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.140]  You're on the internet.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.140]  You've got the sources.
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.140]  You've got huge news on Zollock, Al.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.140]  Give us the info.
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:12.140]  Alright, I just jotted down a few points.
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:13.140]  I'll just start going.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:15.140]  When you get tired of listening to me, just tell me to stop.
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:16.140]  We're going to break here in a minute.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.140]  We'll just come back and continue.
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:18.140]  Go ahead.
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.140]  Okay, now Robert Zollock and the World Bank nomination.
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:26.140]  Now the U.S. delegation is standing unanimously behind Robert Zollock's candidacy as the
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:28.140]  next president of the World Bank.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.220]  Zollock is a 53-year-old Wall Street executive.
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.220]  He's a former administration official and a free market fundamentalist.
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:38.220]  Now during the Bilderberg meeting yesterday, he pledged to work to restore confidence in
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.220]  the bank.
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:43.220]  Now he said, we need to put our differences aside and focus on the future together.
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:48.220]  I believe, Zollock said, that the World Bank's best days are still to come.
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:52.220]  Now the chances of Zollock not being approved for the chair of the World Bank presidency
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.220]  are slim to none.
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:57.220]  The final decision is to be made by the end of June by the bank's 24-member board of
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.300]  directors.
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:02.300]  Now the United States and Europe have a tacit agreement between them that the bank's
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:06.300]  president should always be a U.S. national, while its sister institution, the International
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:09.300]  Monetary Fund, is headed by a European.
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:13.300]  Now nevertheless, according to a source at the conference, European Bilderbergers are
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:18.300]  not at all pleased, Alex, with continuing the status quo in which the U.S. nominates
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.300]  a single candidate after informal consultation with the bank members.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:27.380]  Now the nomination also appears to short-circuit burgeoning calls for reform of the selection
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:32.380]  process of the bank, one of the cornerstones of the global financial architecture as designed
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:35.380]  by the victors of World War II.
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:38.380]  According to our sources at the conference, one Belgian Bilderberger proposed, what he
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:44.380]  said, a merit-based selection process without regard to nationality, something which will
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:47.380]  obviously be discarded by the Inept Bush administration.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:51.380]  What is rather quite remarkable is that on several occasions, European Bilderbergers
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:57.460]  have openly rejected the current model, saying that the nomination reeks of double standards,
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:03.460]  especially because the United States and the World Bank preach accountability and transparency
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:06.460]  to developing countries as the main clients of the bank.
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:11.460]  But with the International Monetary Fund under the control of a Spaniard, the European Central
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:15.460]  Bank under the control of a Frenchman, it's very difficult to imagine that the United
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.460]  States would give up control of the World Bank.
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:23.540]  Only the United States Federal Reserve would remain in the hands of the Americans.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.540]  Daniel Estoland, stay right there.
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.540]  And Daniel has been writing incredible reports.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:30.540]  This sounds like one that hasn't even been published yet.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.540]  He's giving you the scoop here first.
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:34.540]  We'll be right back.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:39.540]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com.
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.540]  Or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:47.620]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:51.620]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.620]  showers than when you drink the water?
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:57.620]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:58.620]  through the skin.
[00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:03.620]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:07.620]  inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:11.620]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:16.700]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:17.700]  first.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:21.700]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:23.700]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.700]  What about you?
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:33.700]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35 of $14 savings.
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:38.700]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:44.779]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:56:08.779 --> 00:56:12.779]  This is Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:12.779 --> 00:56:16.779]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:56:20.779 --> 00:56:22.779]  It is now hour number two.
[00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:28.779]  We had four different reporters and journalists on, including Jim Tucker, in the last hour
[00:56:28.779 --> 00:56:34.779]  from the Bilderberg meeting covering an Istanbul, Turkey, formerly Constantinople.
[00:56:36.779 --> 00:56:37.779]  Why I mention that, I'm just into history.
[00:56:37.859 --> 00:56:41.859]  The point is, Daniel Estelan joins us from Spain.
[00:56:41.859 --> 00:56:45.859]  He's been to the last 15 meetings, but he has a family member on death stories, definitely
[00:56:45.859 --> 00:56:47.859]  to pray for her, so he's unable to attend.
[00:56:47.859 --> 00:56:51.859]  But he is continuing with the best analysis, and he's huge in Endgame.
[00:56:51.859 --> 00:56:52.859]  Wait till it comes out.
[00:56:52.859 --> 00:56:54.859]  We couldn't do it without him.
[00:56:54.859 --> 00:56:56.859]  Daniel Estelan also, of course, has his website.
[00:56:56.859 --> 00:56:59.859]  We have a link to it on info.wars.com and prisonplano.com.
[00:56:59.859 --> 00:57:02.859]  A week and a half ago, he got the entire guest list.
[00:57:02.859 --> 00:57:04.859]  His info is always checked out.
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:08.940]  He's giving huge news on Zelical, a very dangerous globalist.
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:12.940]  Somebody that I was informed of 10 years ago, they said, watch this guy.
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:14.940]  He is very, very important.
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.940]  And there's all these other people involved as well.
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:21.940]  Going back to Daniel Estelan, please continue with that analysis you were going over, sir.
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:22.940]  Well, it's funny, Alex.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:28.940]  You should say that you were informed of Zelic's danger to the international community 10 years ago.
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.940]  I too was told by people who were close to the Bilderberg community that...
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.940]  Yes, Zelic and Zelical.
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:33.940]  I'm sorry.
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.020]  That's right, that's right.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:39.020]  Now, Zelic's name also raises eyebrows, Alex, among development groups,
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:44.020]  for his close ties to the U.S. establishment as well as his relationship to the corporate interests.
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:47.020]  One of the attendees at the Bilderberg conference,
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:50.020]  and I have not had the confirmation as to who this individual is,
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:55.020]  asked Zelic how he was planning to patch up relationships with third- and fourth-world nations
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:59.020]  when he is best remembered during his tenure as United States Trade Representative
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:05.100]  for arm-twisting poor nations' governments to adhere to United States-imposed intellectual property laws
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:09.100]  that make medicines, for example, unaffordable to the developing world.
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:12.100]  Zelic didn't say anything, which, again, are rhetorical questions.
[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:15.100]  Snickering was heard in the room.
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:19.100]  Now, he has been also a close friend to the brand-name pharmaceutical industry
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:24.100]  and the bilateral trade agreements he has negotiated effectively block access to genetic medication
[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:28.100]  for millions of people, meaning basically that millions of people will die
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:31.180]  because they do not have access to cheap medicine.
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:34.180]  Which goes back to the population control agenda, correct?
[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:35.180]  Exactly.
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:39.180]  However, what has really riled up both the American and European delegates
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:43.180]  is the fact that the World Bank's dirty linen is being washed in public.
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:45.180]  Thanks in great part to Paul Wolfowitz's ineptness,
[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:49.180]  which, incidentally, Wolfowitz has blamed on the American press.
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:51.180]  That's quite cheeky of him.
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:53.180]  Now, I'd like to go over a little bit for your audiences,
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:57.180]  exactly explain what the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank stand for,
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:00.260]  because I think a lot of people think that they are good institutions
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:02.260]  that are supposed to be helping humanity,
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:04.260]  where, in fact, they have done more damage to the human race
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:07.260]  than any other financial institution in history, if I may.
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:09.260]  Alex?
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.260]  Yes, please continue.
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.260]  All right.
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:14.260]  Now, it's widely but mistakenly believed that the purpose of the World Bank,
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:16.260]  controlled by the United States Federal Reserve,
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.260]  and the International Monetary Fund,
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:20.260]  of which the United States is the principal donor
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.260]  and the only nation with the veto power,
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:26.260]  is to encourage development and relief poverty in the Third World.
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:30.340]  But in practice, these organizations have added to the impoverishment
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:32.340]  and destitution of millions
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:35.340]  through the loan scheme called the Structural Adjustment Program, SAPs,
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:39.340]  that have succeeded in adding to the country's burden of debt and stagnation.
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:43.340]  Now, the obvious result of the SAPs from the World Bank and the IMF
[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:45.340]  is that the money lent to the destitute nations
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:49.340]  were used to make immediate interest payments to Western banking institutions,
[00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:53.340]  something that both Jim Tucker and I have been saying for years.
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:55.420]  Furthermore, by ordering Third World economies
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:58.420]  to focus on production for export purposes,
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.420]  the World Bank and the IMF channeled over almost $200 billion
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:06.420]  of the Third World financial resources in the 1980s and the early 1990s
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.420]  into servicing dollar denominated for debt.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:12.420]  Obviously, that doesn't help the Third World economies.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:16.420]  Now, these programs are being implemented in over 73rd World countries,
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.420]  from Nigeria to Jamaica, from Hungary to Ethiopia,
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.500]  Ghana, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:27.500]  and they're subjected to 566 IMF and World Bank stabilizations and SAPs.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.500]  Daniel, final segment with you when we get back.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.500]  By the way, folks, they're raping the Third World.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.500]  Now they're subdividing the assets of the United States,
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.500]  treating us like a Third World nation.
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.500]  We are now on the chopping block. Stay with us.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.500]  It's here. After a year in production and traveling to distant lands,
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.500]  my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.500]  Shocking declassified government documents prove
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.500]  that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.500]  against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.500]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.500]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by the United States.
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.500]  It's here. After a year in production and traveling to distant lands,
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.500]  my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.580]  The attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:23.580]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran,
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.580]  the White House program to disseminate fake news,
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.580]  NSA spying, secret police torture,
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:32.580]  the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:34.580]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:36.580]  to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.580]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:40.580]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.580]  who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.660]  Hello, folks. This is Alex Jones,
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.660]  introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger,
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.660]  your source for free solar electricity.
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:06.660]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:10.660]  and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:13.660]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:16.740]  Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.740]  such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras,
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:22.740]  and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.740]  Its multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters,
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.740]  and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.740]  sorts of auxiliary backup power.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.740]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun,
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.740]  plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.740]  Disconnect your application, and the system
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.740]  automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[01:02:40.819 --> 01:02:43.819]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75
[01:02:43.819 --> 01:02:48.819]  by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:02:48.819 --> 01:02:50.819]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:02:50.819 --> 01:02:54.819]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[01:02:57.819 --> 01:03:00.819]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note
[01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:02.819]  is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:03:02.819 --> 01:03:04.819]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:03:04.819 --> 01:03:06.819]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate
[01:03:06.819 --> 01:03:08.819]  is big enough, the size of the vibration will become
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.900]  so large that the glass shatters.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.900]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.900]  discovered that disease organisms can be
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:16.900]  destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.900]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.900]  uses the same technology for relief
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:22.900]  for elimination of pain and disease
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.900]  conditions with no side effects.
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.900]  The 2006 BioSolutions Plus
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.900]  is the easiest to operate frequency
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.900]  instrument ever developed. Its easy reference
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.900]  guide will allow you to begin using the instrument
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.900]  within minutes. Simple, step-by-step
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.900]  instructions using pictures are easy
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.980]  to follow. Customer satisfaction is guaranteed
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:40.980]  or your money back. Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.980]  Eliminate the cause.

[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.980]  That's 1-866-885-6625
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.980]  1-866-885-6625
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:52.980]  1-866-885-6625
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.980]  1-866-885-6625
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:56.980]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.980]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.980]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.980]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:04.980]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.980]  Coming up, we're going to re-air the Ron Paul interview
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:06.980]  coming up, we're going to re-air the Ron Paul interview
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.980]  coming up, we're going to re-air the Ron Paul interview
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:10.980]  from yesterday.
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.980]  Where he talked about the international conspiracy to overthrow America.
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.980]  Then the Steven E. Jones
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.980]  new information about thermite in the buildings and bombs
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:18.980]  that's coming up in the third hour.
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.980]  Of course, Sunday I'll be on the air
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.980]  from 4 to 6 PM central time
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.980]  out of the studios of News Radio 590K, LBJ, and across the country
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.980]  out of the studios of News Radio 590K, LBJ, and across the country
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:28.980]  on wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.980]  The United Nations officially is saying the dollar could collapse
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:32.980]  on the United Nations officially is saying the dollar could collapse
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.980]  and when you actually read the document
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.980]  they say they think it is going to collapse.
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:38.980]  Then of course, they'll come out with the Amaro
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.980]  as the answer to counter the European Union.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.980]  The trilaterals wrote about this in 74
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:44.980]  the trilaterals wrote about this in 74
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:46.980]  when the organization went public, they were actually set up in 73.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.980]  when the organization went public, they were actually set up in 73.
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.980]  It's all happening right now.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.980]  When I tell you the information on PrisonPlanet.com
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.980]  and JonesReport.com
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.980]  is of the utmost importance, folks.
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.980]  You can bank it.
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:00.980]  Go read the articles.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.980]  There are so many that Aaron has written, that Paul Watson has written,
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.980]  that Steve Watson has written.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:06.980]  They're all huge.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.980]  Everything that Ethelum is saying is huge.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.980]  What the guest said in the last hour
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.980]  that was stuff from inside Bilderberg with Jim Tucker.
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:14.980]  Do you understand, folks?
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.980]  You can bank it over and over again.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.980]  It's been accurate.
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.980]  We're not talking about
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:22.980]  what size breast implant some woman got.
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.980]  We're not talking about
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:26.980]  Lindsay Lohan's in rehab.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:28.980]  We're not talking about stoop.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:30.980]  We're talking about everything you've got in the bank
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.980]  being turned into pesos.
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.980]  We're talking about the economy imploding.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.980]  We're talking about trips in the streets.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.980]  We're talking about martial law.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.980]  We're talking about World War III.
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.980]  We're talking about one world government.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.980]  We're talking about biblical type stuff here.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:46.980]  This is the real deal.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.980]  Daniel Estolin, please continue, sir,
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:50.980]  in the last few minutes we've got with you.
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.980]  Great. Great to be back again.
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.980]  One of the key sticking points
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:56.980]  as far as Zollux nomination is concerned
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.980]  has to do with African.
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.980]  African states are unable to compete
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.980]  with Western multinationals.
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.980]  They've been forced to withdraw from the health sector
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:06.980]  as part of the free market economy.
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:08.980]  Again, it goes back to what you were saying
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:10.980]  about the population reduction, etc.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.980]  This has put African children
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:14.980]  at the mercy of unscrupulous international organizations
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.980]  and pharmaceutical transnational corporations
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:18.980]  who are thus at liberty
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:20.980]  to use them as guinea pigs
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.980]  for testing various drugs and vaccines.
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.980]  Now, as a case in point,
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.980]  in January 2001, the U.S.-based pharmaceutical
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.980]  TMC Pfizer used an experimental drug
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.980]  on about 50,000 children
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:32.980]  suffering from meningitis
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.980]  in Cairo, Nigeria,
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.980]  without official authorization as a result
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.980]  of the epidemic.
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:40.980]  Almost 15,000 people died
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.980]  while many others became deaf and blind.
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:44.980]  Needless to say, we haven't heard about it
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.980]  in the United States, nor have we heard about it
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:48.980]  in Europe.
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.980]  But just a couple of other items on the agenda
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.980]  which we're following from the billable conference.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.980]  Now, the European relations with Russia
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:56.980]  is, needless to say, the key sticking point
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:58.980]  not only in Europe, but also in Central Asia.
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.980]  We'll have a complete report on that next week
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.980]  once the conference is finished
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.980]  with Moscow making a deal...
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.980]  Daniel, let me copy you right there.
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:08.980]  Now, you graciously let us post all your stuff
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:10.980]  at prisonblot.com and then pollwars.com.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.980]  Let's take a look at the address for your fabulous
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.980]  news site.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.980]  It's www.danielestuen.com
[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:20.980]  E-F-T-U-L-I-N
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.980]  Today, by the way, Alex, the Turkish edition
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.980]  of my Billenberg book is out.
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:26.980]  And on the 1st of September, the American edition
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.980]  of the true story of the Billenberg
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:30.980]  will be out in the United States.
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.980]  Needless to say, I'll be there to promote it.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.980]  And it's already published in, what, 24 countries?
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.980]  It's published in 42 countries
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.980]  in 24 languages.
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.980]  It has sold a million and a half copies
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.980]  worldwide.
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:44.980]  So, there are a lot of people.
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.980]  Needless to say, it's not nearly as popular
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.980]  as American Idol, but we have enough people
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.980]  and we don't need a lot. We just need 3%
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.980]  of the American population.
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.980]  Well, that was my next question for you.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.980]  3% won the Revolutionary War.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.980]  I want to get the bottom line from you,
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.980]  the globalist strategy to try to bring down the U.S.
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.980]  the last piece in their puzzle.
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:04.980]  You talked about it last year, how important
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.980]  it is for them to get this amnesty
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.980]  to finally bring in the New World Order
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:10.980]  with the North American Union,
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.980]  and what you see the key things are
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.980]  we need to do as people of the world
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.980]  against our enemies, only a couple hundred of them,
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:18.980]  and what they're going to try.
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:20.980]  Well, one of the key things
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.980]  we need to understand is how money works.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.980]  That's one of the things that one of the bankers
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.980]  who actually is a member of the Billenberg Club
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:28.980]  and an intimate friend of mine, he told me,
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.980]  if you want to do something about these people,
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:32.980]  you cannot stand up shoulder to shoulder
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:34.980]  with others, pick up a gun or an arm,
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:36.980]  and try to fight them.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:38.980]  You can't physically win the battle.
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:40.980]  What you need to do is to understand
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:42.980]  how money works, and once you understand
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:44.980]  how money works for you,
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:46.980]  you can actually do something against these people
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:48.980]  because what we're doing by putting money
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.980]  into major financial institutions,
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.980]  we're feeding the monster who sooner or later
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:54.980]  will destroy us.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.980]  So what we need to do, as he told me,
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.980]  is to take the money out of the bank
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.980]  and take the power of the money away from these people.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.980]  That'll be the first step, and that is actually
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:04.980]  what most people believe because everybody thinks
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:06.980]  that the bank is the safest place to keep one's money.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:08.980]  Take the money out of the bank,
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:10.980]  convert it to gold, convert it to silver,
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:12.980]  don't give these people the power
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:14.980]  to destroy us.
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.980]  Absolutely. I mean, why leave it there
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:18.980]  where they have control of it?
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:20.980]  I mean, obviously hedge, be diversified, folks.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:22.980]  Most of us aren't diversified.
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:24.980]  I'm so busy I have no chance to diversify
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:26.980]  my meager nest egg.
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.980]  Daniel, last year you spoke about
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:30.980]  the North American Union and the key to that
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:32.980]  being the open borders.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.980]  How important is that today?
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.980]  I think it's more important than ever.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:38.980]  Europe is a guinea pig.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:40.980]  Europe is an experiment.
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:42.980]  You can see what is going on in Europe.
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:44.980]  They're actually using the same blueprint
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.980]  and they're putting it into practice in the United States.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:48.980]  The American Union is just a matter of time.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.980]  It's a question of time, and I think
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:52.980]  unless people realize what is going on,
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:54.980]  the North American Free Trade Agreement,
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:56.980]  which was actually put into practice
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.980]  in the early 1990s,
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:00.980]  in clear details about how this whole thing
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.980]  was going towards the North American Union.
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.980]  And you could see 10 years or 15 years later
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:06.980]  how we're almost there.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.980]  But again, I think there's still time
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:10.980]  for us to wake up and this general awakening
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:12.980]  hopefully will have enough
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.980]  reason for the people
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.980]  who actually stand together
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.980]  and prevent this thing from actually taking place.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:20.980]  Absolutely. Shame reactions.
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:22.980]  Last year I was with you in Canada and Ottawa, their capital.
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.980]  That's right.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.980]  And it was in dozens of papers,
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.980]  I don't know, probably 20 papers up there,
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:30.980]  hundreds of websites, foreign news,
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.980]  but nothing in the U.S. press.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:34.980]  The U.S. press has always been the most locked down.
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.980]  Now it's all over
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.980]  Dallas Morning News,
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:40.980]  all over other major U.S. newspapers,
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:42.980]  just like Bilderberg and the Google Click News folks.
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:44.980]  What are they saying in the Dallas Morning News?
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.980]  What exactly are they saying?
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.980]  How big is the bill?
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:50.980]  What are they saying?
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.980]  What are they saying in the Dallas Morning News?
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.980]  Okay, the Dallas Morning News,
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.980]  they're talking about how the Governor Rick Perry
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:58.980]  went over there and announced a super-secret meeting
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:00.980]  and it's been on television.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.980]  I'm going to play a TV clip here in a minute.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:04.980]  And other reports are admitting that the world's elite
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:06.980]  are meeting in secret
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.980]  and it's in quite a few U.S. and British and other newspapers.
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:10.980]  All I'm saying is
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.980]  we're seeing more coverage right now
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:14.980]  in one year than we've seen in decades combined.
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.980]  So this is exponential.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.980]  What's it going to be next year?
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.980]  I just hope we have enough time
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.980]  to put a stop to this.
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.980]  But is that encouraging to you,
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.980]  to see this type of coverage?
[01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:28.980]  Well, it is.
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.980]  But again, I think the interlock mechanisms
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:32.980]  that these people actually need
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:34.980]  to bring about their new world order,
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.980]  I think it's in place.
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:38.980]  It's just a question of how quickly they can organize it.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:40.980]  Because again, one of the key issues
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.980]  is the power of money.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:44.980]  As long as we have the money, we more or less are free.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.980]  As soon as they destroy the economy,
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.980]  and that's one of the things
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:50.980]  that they've been talking about in Europe,
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:52.980]  you were talking about Barroso a few minutes ago.
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.980]  Now Barroso, a few months back
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:56.980]  when they were presenting, unveiling the new
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.980]  European energy policy, talked about
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:00.980]  it's time to bring the world into the post-industrial age.
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.980]  Now when I heard that phrase, Alex,
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:04.980]  I almost fell off my chair.
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.980]  That's what you talk about
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:08.980]  in Endgame.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:10.980]  This is the new feudal state.
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:12.980]  This is where they see middle class
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.980]  as their enemy, whether you're Hispanic,
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:16.980]  black, white, Asian.
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.980]  They don't care, folks. Understand that.
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:20.980]  They want to destroy you. Do you understand that?
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:22.980]  That's exactly right. You just said it, Alex.
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.980]  The post-industrial age is a symmetrical twin
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:26.980]  to the pre-industrial age, where you and I worked the field.
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:28.980]  We died, our children worked the field.
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:30.980]  They died, their children worked the field.
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.980]  For an oligarchical lead of one percent.
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.980]  Now to bring the world to the post-industrial age,
[01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.980]  what you need to do,
[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:38.980]  you need to destroy the world economy.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.980]  Now they're saying it as an excuse.
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.980]  That is a global warning.
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.980]  That's what they're using as an excuse.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.980]  Needless to say, well no, that is not the reason.
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:48.980]  Now to destroy the world economy,
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:50.980]  somebody will have to work in the post-industrial age.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:52.980]  My question to you, and to the audience,
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:54.980]  is who is it going to be?
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:56.980]  David Rockefeller or you and I?
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:58.980]  Well, bottom line,
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:00.980]  look at Mexico as a model.
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:02.980]  Richest country per capita in the world.
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.980]  Triple the resources of the U.S.
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.980]  They have the smallest and richest elite.
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:08.980]  Most billionaires in the world, folks.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:10.980]  And it is a religion down there
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:14.980]  to have 50, 100, and 200,000 acre ranches.
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:16.980]  Jose Fox has a 40,000 when he's low level,
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.980]  and they literally, it's a religion,
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:20.980]  just like the British had.
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.980]  A religion of their slaves
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.980]  out there working, it's so sad.
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:26.980]  And now they're using those very people
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:28.980]  who I want to be free,
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.980]  instead of having a revolution in Mexico,
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:32.980]  they're using them to slit the throat of America, Daniel.
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:34.980]  Needless to say, Mexico,
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:36.980]  Mexico has even had
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.980]  the trading parts of the United States
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.980]  and the great benefit to the United States
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:42.980]  and to Mexico, but it's much better to have
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:44.980]  a slave working as a third world wages,
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.980]  and this way you can, exactly.
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.980]  Exactly, instead of us working together
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.980]  to overthrow the government of Mexico
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:52.980]  that's corrupt, and to get our government back
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:54.980]  here in the U.S., and again, I'm talking about that
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.980]  as a microcosm, same thing's happening in Europe.
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:58.980]  You wrote about how they do use the Muslim extremists,
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:00.980]  how the Bilderberg group is behind them,
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:02.980]  because again, it's a destabilizer
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.980]  for the Middle East.
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.980]  And then if we criticize the quote Muslim extremists,
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.980]  some Muslims think, oh, we're against them.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:10.980]  You don't understand, folks, those revolutionaries
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.980]  are controlled by the globalists.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.980]  Daniel Estulin dot com,
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:16.980]  spell that out for people, Daniel.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:20.980]  Daniel E-S-T-U-L-I-N dot com.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:22.980]  And in closing, everybody
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:24.980]  should pray for your mother-in-law.
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:26.980]  I want to thank you for coming on.
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:28.980]  Do you think the globalists are mad right now
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:30.980]  that all this coverage is out there?
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.980]  I'm not sure, Alex.
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:34.980]  The fact that Barroso,
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:36.980]  the president of the European Commission,
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:38.980]  a few months back, actually showed his hand,
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.980]  if you're in a poker game, you show your hand,
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:42.980]  because no matter what the other one has,
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:44.980]  you can always win.
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.980]  And what they've done a few months back
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:48.980]  is they actually showed their hand by saying that it's time
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:50.980]  to bring the world into the post-industrial age.
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:52.980]  Now, this is the first time, I think, in history
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:54.980]  that they've openly admitted
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.980]  what they've actually been trying.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:58.980]  And they're going to do that with the new carbon tax,
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:00.980]  which means one child policy, no more meat.
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:02.980]  I mean, hundreds of rules.
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:04.980]  It's all mainstream media now, folks.
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:06.980]  When you hear carbon tax, oh, let's ban the light bulbs.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.980]  See, that sounds reasonable,
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.980]  but it's once they've set that precedent, folks,
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:12.980]  it's total feudalism,
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:14.980]  micromanagement of your life
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:16.980]  under new environmental laws.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.980]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:20.980]  Now, Daniel,
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:22.980]  where and when did Barroso say that?
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:24.980]  Because I'm going to get that.
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:26.980]  Well, he actually said it.
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:28.980]  I got it off the BBC.
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:30.980]  I don't have the date right now,
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:32.980]  but he said it a few months ago
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:34.980]  at the unveiling of the latest European energy policy.
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:36.980]  Barroso said it the same day.
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:38.980]  Oh, my God, I've got to get that.
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:40.980]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:42.980]  Daniel, thank you.
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:44.980]  Okay, well, stay there.
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:46.980]  Stay there, because we've got to come back to you.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:48.980]  Just a quick break if you want to finish up.
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:50.980]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:58.980]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer,
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.980]  but every time I get a pedicure,
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:02.980]  my feet look great.
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.980]  For a while, anyway.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.980]  Then I have to go right back again
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:08.980]  because they get dry so quickly.
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:10.980]  Listen, haven't you heard about cal-ex ointment?
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:12.980]  I use it regularly on my heels,
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.980]  and they stay looking great,
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:16.980]  and my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.980]  What's the name again?
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:20.980]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:22.980]  It's cal-ex, C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.980]  What makes cal-ex ointment so different?
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.980]  It's got these natural enzymes
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:28.980]  that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.980]  and leave your feet
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:32.980]  feeling soft and smooth,
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.980]  just like a baby's bottom.
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:36.980]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals,
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:38.980]  use enzyme-rich, moisturizing cal-ex ointment.
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:40.980]  It's diabetic-friendly
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:42.980]  and found in the foot care section of Walgreens,
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:44.980]  Longs, Snyder's Drug,
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.980]  Bilo, Car Drug,
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:48.980]  H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies,
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:50.980]  and Rite Aid.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:52.980]  Hey, there's a drug store. I'll be right back.
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.980]  I'm getting some cal-ex.
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.980]  As many people know,
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:00.980]  the US dollar has been devaluating.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:02.980]  What people don't know, however,
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:04.980]  is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:06.980]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.980]  from losing value?
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:10.980]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.980]  They've both maintained their purchasing power
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.980]  for 6,000 years.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:16.980]  If you had had $100,000 in cash
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.980]  and $100,000 in gold and silver
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:20.980]  back in 1913
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:22.980]  and kept them both until now,
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:24.980]  your cash would actually have the buying power
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.980]  of only $4,800.
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.980]  Gold and silver would have the buying power
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:30.980]  of $3 million.
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.980]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:34.980]  Call me, John Ballman, today
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:36.980]  at 1-800-686-2237
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:38.980]  extension 169.
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:40.980]  Get all your questions answered
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:42.980]  before your money is worth zero.
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:44.980]  Call 1-800-686-2237
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:46.980]  extension 169.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.980]  Take action today while we still accept
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:50.980]  paper dollars for gold.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:52.980]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.980]  extension 169.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:58.980]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.980]  to remove chemicals such as
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:02.980]  triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine,
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:04.980]  chloroform, and MTBE to below
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.980]  detectable limits. Black murky elements
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:08.980]  are so powerful they remove pathogenic
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.980]  bacteria, cysts, and parasites
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:12.980]  to non-detectable levels and transform
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.980]  water, even raw, stagnant pond water
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:16.980]  into delicious crystal clear drinking
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:18.980]  water. Nitrates, nitrites,
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:20.980]  radon-222, unwanted heavy metals
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:22.980]  like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.980]  problem. Foul tastes like chlorine and
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.980]  obnoxious sulfur odors are removed
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:28.980]  without removing the healthful and beneficial
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:30.980]  minerals that your body needs. Black murky
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:32.980]  elements flow one and a half to two times faster
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:34.980]  than ordinary gravity elements, which
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:36.980]  means it takes much less time to filter your
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:38.980]  water. Supercharge your gravity filter
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:40.980]  today. Upgrade to black murky purification
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:42.980]  elements. Get a 2-pack, only
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:44.980]  $99, or a 4-pack, only

[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.980]  We're going to be using a
[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:26.980]  separate word for the word monastery
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:28.980]  spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.

[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:44.980]  Most Holy Family Monastery,

[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:48.980]  14735. The price of the
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:50.980]  whole package is $10 which includes
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:52.980]  everything inside the U.S.

[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:23.980]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:25.980]  Daniel, finish up your point, my friend.
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.980]  Just a couple of points before
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:29.980]  I go. Build-A-Work is not
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:31.980]  a conspiracy. I think it's very, very important that people
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:33.980]  understand that they exist, they
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:35.980]  meet, and then what they decide is executed
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.980]  on the world stage annually.
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:39.980]  And as most of the things that they actually decide
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:41.980]  is very, very short term because there is no
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:43.980]  long term, I think we can actually see
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:45.980]  the things that I say, the things that Jim Tucker says,
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:47.980]  things that you do. People
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:49.980]  can, we don't need to go 800
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:51.980]  years into the future. These are short three, six,
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:53.980]  one year decisions, one year
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:55.980]  into the future decisions, and we can
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:57.980]  actually see just how right we are about the
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:20:59.980]  things that we say. This is a world
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.980]  governing council.
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:03.980]  Exactly. This is a world governing council
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:05.980]  run by the European and the Americans,
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:07.980]  which is a NATO alliance. Now you said a few
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:09.980]  minutes ago, is there anything we can do? Do we have a chance?
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:11.980]  I think we do have a chance, but the thing is that
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:13.980]  these people are slightly ahead of us. They
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:15.980]  started about 500 years ago, shortly after
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:17.980]  the Treaty of Florence was signed, which
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:19.980]  established the idea of nation states.
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:21.980]  So they've been at it for 500
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:23.980]  years, and they know exactly
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.980]  what they want. Now the thing about us,
[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:27.980]  the people who are trying to organize the resistance
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:29.980]  against what the Bilderbergers are trying to
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:31.980]  do, is that we're not as
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.980]  well organized, and needless to say, we don't have
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:35.980]  a purpose in mind. They do. The idea is
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:37.980]  not so much a one world government as
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:39.980]  a one world company. That's
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.980]  their final objective. Yeah, that's just a bunch of blocks
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:43.980]  owned and run by the same people.
[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:45.980]  Daniel, let's...
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:47.980]  Go ahead. That's what George Ball
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.980]  said in 1968. Now Ball was the
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:51.980]  sub-secretary of economic affairs
[01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:53.980]  with Johnson and Kennedy. He said, how do we
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:55.980]  create a world company which will give
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:57.980]  orders to governments? In other words, how do you create
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.980]  a Halliburton type company
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:01.980]  which will supersede and empower every government
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:03.980]  on Earth? It's not up to God.
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:05.980]  It's up to us to do something about this, and I
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:07.980]  think we can, as long as we can stop
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:09.980]  watching American Idol and whatever else is
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:11.980]  out there, which has a lot to
[01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:13.980]  do with dumbing down of society, and
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:15.980]  very little to do with the idea of freedom.
[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:17.980]  Absolutely. Daniel, I want to get you
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:19.980]  back up in the next few weeks as soon as your
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.980]  family problems are
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.980]  concluded. God bless you, my friend,
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:25.980]  and thank you for your great work. Thanks so much for
[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:27.980]  having me. What a great gentleman.
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:29.980]  I wanted to play this clip, but we don't have time now.
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:31.980]  You can go up to PresentBlonde.com and
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.980]  watch the News 8 Austin piece
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.980]  about Rick Perry and the Bilderberg Group.
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:37.980]  I mean, this is on local
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:39.980]  Texas news. By the way,
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:41.980]  I'll admit, we called him up and said
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.980]  yesterday and said, you know, it's in the
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:45.980]  Dallas Morning News that he went to this. By the way,
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:47.980]  it's illegal. It's a violation of the Logan Act.
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:49.980]  We have articles on PresentBlonde.com about
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:51.980]  the Logan Act being violated. That needs
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:53.980]  to be gotten out to people. He could get
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:55.980]  in trouble for this. Hillary got fined $300,000
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.980]  a few years ago for this
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:59.980]  stuff. Okay, this is serious.
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:01.980]  We've got news about Giuliani
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:03.980]  being heckled and booed by 9-11 members,
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:05.980]  family members. That is important.
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.980]  So we stopped using their name
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:09.980]  to wrap them around himself, help us get
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:11.980]  that out. We've got this huge
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:13.980]  article that
[01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:15.980]  Aaron Dyke stayed up to the middle of the night
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:17.980]  doing last night. It's unbelievable.
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:19.980]  Governor Perry summoned the Bilderberg
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.980]  while insider trading charges
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:23.980]  mounted related Texas buyout. We're talking
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.980]  about indictments, folks, with Bilderberg
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:27.980]  members involved in his handing over
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:29.980]  of the water systems, the biggest
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.980]  power plant grab ever, the roads,
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:33.980]  everything. I mean, folks, this is happening.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:35.980]  I mean, this is going
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:37.980]  on right now. This is huge
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.980]  stuff. I just want to hurt them. I want
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:41.980]  to expose them. I want to get my fellow
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:43.980]  Americans, people of the world, my fellow
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:45.980]  Texans to see what's happening.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:47.980]  That is all I want. Please help

[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:51.980]  Infowars.com. And I know my team
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:53.980]  works really hard, but we need to
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:55.980]  look at this breaking news with
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.980]  what Tucker said last hour. That's the stuff
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:59.980]  that's going to happen. We need articles on that.
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:01.980]  Help us listeners. Write up your own articles about what
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:03.980]  we said. Send them to Aaron at Infowars.com.
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:05.980]  JonesReport.com right now
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:07.980]  has the most reporting. It's all up there
[01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:09.980]  right now on the site. Just
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:11.980]  help us get this out. All I want to do
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.980]  is expose these people. All I want to do
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:15.980]  is stop these people. That
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:17.980]  is what we're doing here. And they're
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:19.980]  evil. They're bad. We're exposing
[01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:21.980]  them. It's starting to come out in the news. We need to
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:23.980]  arrest all these people. These are
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:25.980]  evil, evil, evil people.
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:27.980]  They're destroying my country. They're destroying my
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.980]  state. They're destroying your nations, no matter
[01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:31.980]  where you live. And they're playing us
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:33.980]  off against each other. We have got to
[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:35.980]  defeat them with God's help. We have to at least
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:37.980]  put up a fight against them or they're going to run all
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.980]  over us. So please,
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:41.980]  go get the video clips.

[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:51.980]  It is June 1st, 2007.
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:53.980]  It's a year

[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:35.980]  fight. We got good on our side.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:37.980]  They're the bad guys. If we expose
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:39.980]  them, with God's help, we cannot
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:41.980]  lose. Get to PrisonPlanet.com.
