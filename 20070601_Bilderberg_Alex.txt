[00:00:00.942 --> 00:00:07.606]  Which will also be a global tax, for those that don't know, a global tax on all maritime activities and put the U.N.
[00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:11.608]  over 74% of the Earth's surface.
[00:00:11.608 --> 00:00:25.315]  Absolutely, and with a big, major surrender of sovereignty when the, well, some international group, obviously, under control of the U.N.
[00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:29.297]  Remember, Clinton signed the Law of the Sea Treaty.
[00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:30.555]  Stay there.
[00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:31.596]  Stay there, Jim Tucker.
[00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:33.436]  We're going to come right back with a final segment.
[00:00:33.436 --> 00:00:39.458]  This is the news he's getting from inside Bilderberg, with his sources he gets every year with infiltrators.
[00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:47.481]  After the people that work in the hotel see the open evil, the open discussion of world government and total enslavement, he then gets the inside intel.
[00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:52.343]  You're getting it here first, from Jim Tucker, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:01.363 --> 00:01:04.888]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:01:04.888 --> 00:01:07.190]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.840]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:22.960]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:34.703]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:38.664]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:40.925]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:01:40.925 --> 00:01:44.786]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:01:58.288 --> 00:02:01.511]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:05.674]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:08.297]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:02:08.297 --> 00:02:10.819]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:19.346]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:02:19.346 --> 00:02:20.787]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:02:20.787 --> 00:02:26.672]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filter.
[00:02:26.952 --> 00:02:38.826]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals and nitrates.
[00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:45.213]  It is so powerful it purifies raw untreated water from remote lakes, streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:02:45.313 --> 00:02:50.158]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.

[00:02:58.064 --> 00:03:01.145]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:06.666]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:12.387]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:03:12.387 --> 00:03:13.868]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:03:13.868 --> 00:03:22.770]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.190]  Yes!
[00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.032]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[00:03:57.802 --> 00:04:03.206]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:03.206 --> 00:04:05.488]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:04:11.748 --> 00:04:25.338]  Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, Congressman Mon Paul, on this show, May 31st, yesterday, it's now June 1st, said that if Rick Perry went to Bilderberg, he hadn't yet seen the Dallas Morning News.
[00:04:25.338 --> 00:04:30.721]  He said that that does look like a violation of the Logan Act, which is criminal.
[00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:35.585]  It's a federal felony, punishable by large fines and prison time.
[00:04:36.627 --> 00:04:47.718]  He also said that it shows he's definitely part of the quote, one world government conspiracy, the plan for a one world government, that he's part of the international conspiracy.
[00:04:47.718 --> 00:04:55.085]  And if you go up to PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com and especially JonesReport.com, just unbelievable reporting there.
[00:04:56.109 --> 00:04:58.950]  He will see all of this, and of course we also broke yesterday.
[00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:07.771]  I'm so proud of this and so honored that Jim broke this here, that it is confirmed, and they finally reported today that it is the Ritz-Carlton there in Istanbul.
[00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:10.432]  Jim has got sources inside.
[00:05:10.432 --> 00:05:15.513]  Jim was getting into, which you could already see him starting to move towards publicly, capitulating.
[00:05:15.513 --> 00:05:17.573]  Of course, they were just getting the Americans ready.
[00:05:17.573 --> 00:05:18.393]  Bush was always for it.
[00:05:18.393 --> 00:05:23.494]  He signed back on to UNESCO three years ago, United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization.
[00:05:23.494 --> 00:05:25.795]  They were getting us ready for this.
[00:05:26.488 --> 00:05:37.893]  And we got the SPP.gov documents through a FOIA request last year, Judicial Watch did, and it said in there they were going to use global warming hysteria and fear.
[00:05:37.893 --> 00:05:43.356]  They said use the fear to get a region-wide carbon tax.
[00:05:43.356 --> 00:05:49.479]  Going back to Jim Tucker, please continue on that point, sir, and you were also getting into some other points.
[00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.020]  Well, on the energy-related part,
[00:05:54.764 --> 00:05:55.204]  The U.S.
[00:05:55.204 --> 00:06:09.995]  was told to increase to hike gasoline taxes enough to make the prices exceed $4 a gallon at least.
[00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:13.197]  They prefer it to be about $5 a gallon.
[00:06:13.197 --> 00:06:22.804]  And that would be, of course, to reduce carbon monoxide emissions and make us all healthier, see?
[00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:34.532]  Uh, laugh at this proposal with the boot of America paying record high gas taxes now, uh, adjusted for inflation.
[00:06:34.532 --> 00:06:48.900]  Consider that, uh, in the early 80s, the Junior Varsity Trilateral Commission meeting in San Francisco called for, uh, increase in, uh, gasoline taxes, a federal gas tax increase of ten cents a gallon.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.503]  Shocking to most Americans at that time because that was another one of those
[00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:55.325]  We're good to go.
[00:07:20.816 --> 00:07:41.023]  The Bilderberg Control Washington Post, in its editorial, not for my column, but the official position of the Bilderberg Control Washington Post, on Tuesday, in its editorial, called for a gas tax increase of tens of thousands of gallons, and it came to pass.
[00:07:41.023 --> 00:07:49.166]  So, we must not take this too lightly.
[00:07:50.908 --> 00:07:53.229]  Now, before the break, Jim, you were trying to get into Bill Clinton.
[00:07:53.229 --> 00:08:13.656]  You were saying, remember Bill Clinton in connection with Law of the Sea Treaty, which allows the UN to seize 70 plus percent of the Earth's surface, of course, being the oceans and seas of the world, and inland seas, and being able to levy taxes and have paramilitary global coast guards running around controlling everyone.
[00:08:13.656 --> 00:08:20.318]  This is a massive grab, just like the Pentagon has claimed total dominance and ownership of space.
[00:08:21.145 --> 00:08:25.629]  In fact, that's an official position of our government, is ownership of the entire universe now.
[00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:27.651]  They've told any other government they can't get up there.
[00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:29.492]  This is all for dominance and control.
[00:08:29.492 --> 00:08:36.738]  You know, nobody cared when Spain claimed the New World for themselves, along with Portugal, but you know, that certainly meant something down the line.
[00:08:36.738 --> 00:08:44.145]  Now, with society being accelerated and everything happening, instead of over a hundred years, you know, the change that happened in a hundred years is now happening in a year.
[00:08:44.145 --> 00:08:48.148]  This is very, very serious to anyone who's going to be alive in just ten years.
[00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:53.301]  So please get back into law to see, sir, what the intel you're getting from inside Bilderberg.
[00:08:53.301 --> 00:09:03.786]  Remember that Reagan denounced it with humor and would not sign off on it.
[00:09:03.786 --> 00:09:13.170]  Bush, the original, even though he is under Bilderberg control, did not dare push it too hard in his term.
[00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.951]  And Bill Clinton signed it and told us how wonderful it would be.
[00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:17.112]  Of course, Bill Clinton
[00:09:18.536 --> 00:09:23.320]  Was annoyed by Bilderberg when he attended their meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany in 1991.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.402]  And he tells us what a wonderful thing it will be.
[00:09:26.402 --> 00:09:33.067]  So the citizens had a testament, they call it on ratification, and it was rejected 95 to 0.
[00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:43.334]  So Clinton pulled it back, pulled back his request for ratification, for political reasons obviously, on a treaty he had signed off on.
[00:09:47.214 --> 00:10:05.061]  That was before the 9-11 police state agenda, where 9-11 was used to do absolutely anything and everything, and that was before the fake man-made global warming hysteria, where we've got to turn everything over to the UN, and man-eating meat, and start restricting people to one family, one child.
[00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:07.381]  That's all being called for right now.
[00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:09.562]  The Chinese model is the New World Order model.
[00:10:09.562 --> 00:10:14.604]  Jim Tucker, any other key tidbits you're getting from your sources inside Bilderberg?
[00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:19.740]  Uh, domestically, uh, that's about it.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:36.288]  But the fact that, uh, little Bush is going to embrace the, uh, uh, the Law of the Sea Treaty is something that will have to emerge in the fullest of time in the cut press also, but you heard it here first.
[00:10:36.288 --> 00:10:41.310]  And of course you heard it here first that they were not going to attack Iraq in 02 as the Washington Post said they were.
[00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.232]  And as the media unanimously said, it was going to be 03.
[00:10:44.232 --> 00:10:44.752]  You said that.
[00:10:45.171 --> 00:10:48.072]  We heard it here first from you, Jim, on the Berlin Wall.
[00:10:48.072 --> 00:10:50.013]  It was going to fall on a staged event.
[00:10:50.013 --> 00:10:52.774]  We heard it here first on every single issue.
[00:10:52.774 --> 00:10:54.034]  These guys pull the shots.
[00:10:54.034 --> 00:10:57.316]  Jim told you three years ago they were going to double oil prices.
[00:10:57.316 --> 00:10:59.056]  It indeed happened.
[00:10:59.056 --> 00:11:01.317]  These guys are setting the policy.
[00:11:01.317 --> 00:11:08.460]  Jim, on a whole separate issue, just on media coverage, it is in newspapers globally.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:14.262]  I did a search under Bilderberg on Google News this morning, and it came up with hundreds of hits.
[00:11:14.781 --> 00:11:21.129]  We see exponential coverage of this from 10 years ago the media said it didn't exist, 7 years ago they said it did.
[00:11:21.129 --> 00:11:21.750]  American media?
[00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.773]  Because I've not seen an American newspaper since Left Washington.
[00:11:24.773 --> 00:11:28.798]  Yes, Dallas Morning News front page, many other U.S.
[00:11:28.798 --> 00:11:29.940]  newspapers front page.
[00:11:30.459 --> 00:11:31.879]  Magazines, Jim.
[00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:35.740]  Some of the top movies at the box office make jokes about Bilderberg.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.361]  It's just all of a sudden, it's all over Texas television.
[00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:43.021]  We have video clips up on prisonplanet.com from News 8 Austin.
[00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:44.801]  There's also a Dallas piece.
[00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:52.943]  I'm told the Senate... It's wonderful, this breakthrough, because you know as well as I do about the near total blackout we've had in the United States.
[00:11:52.943 --> 00:11:57.144]  The European newspapers and broadcasters have had a lot of fun.
[00:11:57.144 --> 00:11:59.484]  I've had very few moments today, but I'm not staring into
[00:12:00.077 --> 00:12:05.260]  Somebody's camera and yacking away.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.641]  Well, see, that's the difference.
[00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:11.844]  I mean, before, when you were doing this 30 years ago, and physically, what, at 29 of these meetings, Jim?
[00:12:11.844 --> 00:12:13.345]  Something like that.
[00:12:13.345 --> 00:12:17.067]  So, I mean, literally 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, it didn't exist.
[00:12:17.067 --> 00:12:23.891]  Then last year in Canada, because they arrested me and a few other things, it blew up nationally there, but it never really been in our press.
[00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:25.272]  Now, for the first time, Jim,
[00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:27.570]  And again, you get most of the credit on this.
[00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.090]  It is everywhere.
[00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.151]  Do you think they're happy about this?
[00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:42.894]  Oh, they've got their knickers in, not to be sure, because their salad years have been, they could be absolutely secret until now, their very existence.
[00:12:42.894 --> 00:12:46.635]  And they're doing everything stupidly, perhaps, to
[00:12:47.717 --> 00:12:52.619]  Trying to suppress coverage like the lie they planted in that newspaper story we talked about yesterday.
[00:12:52.619 --> 00:13:01.383]  Six paragraphs deep inside the paper, very polite, and saying it was going to be a classic resort.
[00:13:01.383 --> 00:13:06.125]  Well, there's also big Turkish papers saying big deal, so they're world leaders meeting.
[00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:08.226]  The point is they try to keep it secret all these years.
[00:13:08.226 --> 00:13:09.426]  We've gotten their minutes.
[00:13:09.426 --> 00:13:12.207]  We know they're securing global events.
[00:13:12.207 --> 00:13:13.888]  We know that they are very corrupt.
[00:13:14.338 --> 00:13:19.780]  Jim, what type of security did you see outside of the Ritz Carlton?
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:26.122]  Typical, tremendous show of uniformed police.
[00:13:26.122 --> 00:13:30.383]  All, of course, armed, surrounding the whole hill.
[00:13:30.383 --> 00:13:40.947]  Of course, many of them at the front gate, but then you don't take three steps without a couple of cops confronting you as you walk all the way around that hill.
[00:13:40.947 --> 00:13:42.347]  So it's a lot heavier than Canada?
[00:13:44.557 --> 00:14:02.501]  I'm trying to remember Canada, well yes it was heavier than Canada and of course they had the guys on the top of the roof with their binoculars and our photographer thinks he was able to shoot David Rockefeller when he blows his photographs up he'll be sure.
[00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:13.103]  So far they've tried to keep the list secret but we've just got all of them accounted for and they may end up putting it on a website say Monday just to
[00:14:14.164 --> 00:14:26.013]  Get rid of the questions and all that jazz, but I'll bet you we've identified people that they will not put on that website that were confirmed by their presence was confirmed by our site.
[00:14:26.013 --> 00:14:30.336]  By that you mean there's always people on who are there who aren't on the list?
[00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:40.204]  How big is this to have Rick Perry, by the way, who's embroiled a Bilderberg member, by the way, has been indicted in connection to literally the biggest
[00:14:40.783 --> 00:14:48.365]  A takeover of government and private-owned power plants in Texas that's powering much of the surrounding states.
[00:14:48.365 --> 00:14:49.545]  It's already been a big scandal.
[00:14:49.545 --> 00:14:55.666]  It turns out Rick Perry's involved in all that, and with Bilderberg Group members, in the grabbing of 8,000 miles of roads.
[00:14:55.666 --> 00:15:03.028]  Literally, Bilderberg is grabbing the infrastructure of Texas, the fastest-growing state in the Union, the second most populous.
[00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:04.328]  What does this mean for Rick Perry?
[00:15:04.328 --> 00:15:09.009]  I mean, is it that they're positioning him for president later, or is this more that he's just one of their gangsters?
[00:15:10.635 --> 00:15:35.295]  Well, first of all, as I mentioned yesterday, they would consider him a potential president, a useful tool and fool in the future, and that he'd not be invited next year if they decide to throw that shoe away, because about 110 to 115 of the Bilderbergs are the regulars, typically there's five or so newcomers, most of whom are not invited back.
[00:15:38.246 --> 00:15:41.869]  They had to see some potential for him to be their tool to invite him.
[00:15:59.289 --> 00:16:01.970]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:11.433]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:16:11.433 --> 00:16:18.535]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:16:19.258 --> 00:16:25.240]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:36.822]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:16:36.822 --> 00:16:39.383]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:16:39.383 --> 00:16:40.803]  For more information, call 702-953-0111.
[00:16:43.404 --> 00:16:43.684]  We're good.
[00:16:57.987 --> 00:16:59.048]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:16:59.048 --> 00:17:04.014]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:17:04.014 --> 00:17:12.084]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:17:12.084 --> 00:17:17.431]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:17:17.651 --> 00:17:24.934]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:17:24.934 --> 00:17:30.517]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:17:30.517 --> 00:17:35.599]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:43.182]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:17:43.522 --> 00:17:50.086]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:17:50.086 --> 00:17:51.407]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:17:51.407 --> 00:17:57.210]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:02.354]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:18:02.354 --> 00:18:09.638]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:20.627]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:18:20.627 --> 00:18:25.471]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:30.435]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:18:30.655 --> 00:18:33.837]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:18:33.837 --> 00:18:43.722]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:48.584]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:18:48.584 --> 00:18:50.325]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:18:56.897 --> 00:19:02.165]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[00:19:02.165 --> 00:19:04.248]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:19:04.248 --> 00:19:07.473]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:19:07.473 --> 00:19:10.918]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:19:10.918 --> 00:19:12.761]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:17.002]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:19:17.002 --> 00:19:20.283]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:19:20.283 --> 00:19:24.785]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:19:24.785 --> 00:19:29.026]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:19:29.466 --> 00:19:34.108]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[00:19:34.108 --> 00:19:38.689]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[00:19:38.689 --> 00:19:44.891]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[00:19:44.891 --> 00:19:47.512]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[00:19:47.512 --> 00:19:48.352]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:19:48.352 --> 00:19:49.693]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.372]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:18.372 --> 00:20:30.641]  Waiting in the wings, we have American filmmakers Andrew Neal and Luke Meyer, also Romanian filmmaker Paul Duranu, and Daniel Estefan coming up later.
[00:20:30.641 --> 00:20:33.643]  This is just absolutely amazing.
[00:20:33.643 --> 00:20:35.865]  And of course, Jim Tucker right now.
[00:20:35.865 --> 00:20:37.286]  Jim, you said there's so much more
[00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:48.945]  And obviously, when you get back to town, we'll do a full hour and debrief you properly, and American Free Press is going to have photos and articles about it, so is PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[00:20:48.945 --> 00:20:52.126]  But just in closing, before I go to these other reporters, Jim, I want to thank you for coming on.
[00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:58.109]  I want to thank you for your 30-plus years of covering this, 29 years physically covering it.
[00:20:58.109 --> 00:20:59.590]  What is it, 35 covering in total?
[00:21:00.642 --> 00:21:02.984]  You said there was a whole other European side.
[00:21:02.984 --> 00:21:08.888]  Give us just a taste of some of the things that you're going to be writing about, some of the things you've learned from your sources.
[00:21:08.888 --> 00:21:20.337]  Well, you've been reading about the Turkish troops massing on the border with Iraq to invade the Kurds in Iraq.
[00:21:20.337 --> 00:21:29.544]  The Turkish, Billiberg said, there's the massing of our troops on the border with Iraq and there will be the invasion of the Kurds.
[00:21:30.517 --> 00:21:32.419]  In Iraq.
[00:21:32.419 --> 00:21:38.424]  Well, they're always having Kurds engaging in incursions, so they've always got troops there.
[00:21:38.424 --> 00:21:40.365]  Yeah.
[00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:45.569]  The newspaper was all wrong about the massacre on the border and the potential invasion.
[00:21:45.569 --> 00:21:59.220]  Another Turk said that he'd like to be portrayed as begging to the European Union and pointed out that a lot of Turks
[00:22:00.026 --> 00:22:07.612]  Are opposed to the European Union because they'd have to surrender too much sovereignty, and there's so many nationalists.
[00:22:07.612 --> 00:22:15.517]  Well, nationalists, which is their synonym for patriots, are demeaned by Bill O'Brien.
[00:22:15.517 --> 00:22:20.561]  To be a nationalist, a patriot to your own country, you're horrible.
[00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:24.464]  So they've had that little kind of interchange to
[00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:31.393]  The Europeans support the invasion of Iraq, but still, I mean, of Afghanistan.
[00:22:31.393 --> 00:22:34.035]  Nothing this year so far, but I'll be back tomorrow.
[00:22:49.958 --> 00:22:54.902]  I guess I better turn you over to those old-timers who've had some good adventures today.
[00:22:54.902 --> 00:22:55.963]  Absolutely, Jim.
[00:22:55.963 --> 00:22:56.683]  Thank you so much.
[00:22:56.683 --> 00:22:58.725]  Are you still being followed?
[00:22:58.725 --> 00:22:59.966]  Okay, you're welcome.
[00:22:59.966 --> 00:23:01.267]  Oh, yes.
[00:23:01.267 --> 00:23:04.510]  They pointed out a different set of cops today.
[00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.010]  All right, sir.
[00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.491]  We'll talk to you this weekend.
[00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:06.852]  Very good.
[00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:07.552]  Have fun.
[00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:12.076]  There goes Jim Tucker from his hotel in Istanbul, the Orient.
[00:23:12.076 --> 00:23:14.698]  And it's overlooking the nearby Ritz-Carlton.
[00:23:15.351 --> 00:23:22.915]  We now go, we're about to break, but I want to go ahead and introduce them to Andrew Neal and Luke Meyer, and they're in a hotel room filled with other reporters.
[00:23:22.915 --> 00:23:25.116]  Gentlemen, thank you for coming on.
[00:23:25.116 --> 00:23:26.016]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[00:23:26.016 --> 00:23:27.236]  Thanks for having us.
[00:23:27.236 --> 00:23:28.937]  Thank you for coming on.
[00:23:28.937 --> 00:23:29.658]  What have you seen?
[00:23:29.658 --> 00:23:32.279]  What is this like, covering Bilderberg?
[00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:34.540]  It's been pretty wild, you know.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.561]  We got here on Tuesday, Jim got here on Wednesday.
[00:23:37.561 --> 00:23:39.442]  We came here to follow Jim's
[00:23:40.307 --> 00:23:49.132]  Jim's a journey, and we've been with him pretty much every waking moment of the day when he's been on the move, and it's been pretty incredible.
[00:23:49.132 --> 00:23:56.496]  Like, there's cops following him, and when we went over to the Ritz, it cordoned off the entire area.
[00:23:56.496 --> 00:24:02.239]  With riot gear and things kind of roped up with barricades so you can't go on the sidewalk.
[00:24:02.239 --> 00:24:06.862]  There were some guys with, like, submachine guns and stuff, and you couldn't even get close to it.
[00:24:07.938 --> 00:24:08.738]  That's normal.
[00:24:08.738 --> 00:24:12.159]  Yeah, no, for Luke and I, we've never seen anything like this.
[00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:15.320]  So for us, it was kind of mind-blowing.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.662]  Well, I was about to add that that's happened every other time, but when I went to Canada.
[00:24:19.662 --> 00:24:21.842]  But go ahead.
[00:24:21.842 --> 00:24:24.883]  So yeah, that was kind of a shock to us.
[00:24:24.883 --> 00:24:29.705]  And then we were in the car with Jim, traveling around the city to be followed by police.
[00:24:29.705 --> 00:24:32.806]  Certainly nothing that has ever happened to me.
[00:24:33.776 --> 00:24:36.217]  Before and so it was kind of startling.
[00:24:36.217 --> 00:24:40.818]  We got some good shots of that and Jim is just kind of inspiring.
[00:24:40.818 --> 00:24:43.198]  He's still on the move.
[00:24:43.198 --> 00:24:45.339]  I can't believe he's got the energy to keep going.
[00:24:45.339 --> 00:24:47.039]  In fact, he's got more energy than us.
[00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:49.820]  It's hard to see what's going on inside there.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.760]  They seem to have established a really good perimeter.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.961]  It's all buttoned up.
[00:24:54.961 --> 00:24:56.721]  We spent some time out in front.
[00:24:56.721 --> 00:24:59.482]  Look at all the entrances that we've got.
[00:25:00.327 --> 00:25:08.590]  Yeah, there's like three entrances that, you know, different people are going in, but you couldn't, we couldn't, we didn't see any, we weren't able to get any clear shots of anyone in particular.
[00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.210]  Is this Andrew or Luke I'm talking to?
[00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:11.571]  This is Andrew, sorry.
[00:25:11.571 --> 00:25:14.111]  Okay, no, no, no, I just wanted to learn the voices.
[00:25:14.111 --> 00:25:15.812]  Okay, go ahead, Andrew.
[00:25:15.812 --> 00:25:24.335]  Um, so anyway, you know, that, we kind of left with Jim, and then, um, and then, well, there's another filmmaker here, uh, Paul, that's sitting in the wings.
[00:25:24.335 --> 00:25:26.275]  Yeah, we're going to talk to him on the other side, but stay there.
[00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:27.696]  I want to talk to Luke, too.
[00:25:27.696 --> 00:25:28.756]  Andrew, I just want to, uh,
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.682]  You know, get your take on the whole experience, the press coverage, what's happening.
[00:25:32.682 --> 00:25:35.744]  Talk about the film you're making about Jim Tucker.
[00:25:35.744 --> 00:25:38.586]  And we'll be right back on The Other Side.
[00:25:38.586 --> 00:25:48.712]  Stay with us.
[00:25:48.712 --> 00:25:50.133]  We're on the march.
[00:25:50.133 --> 00:25:52.654]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:25:52.654 --> 00:25:55.336]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:25:58.567 --> 00:26:01.729]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:26:01.729 --> 00:26:07.891]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:26:07.891 --> 00:26:10.193]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:26:10.193 --> 00:26:19.397]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:26:19.697 --> 00:26:30.809]  With more than 500 vital functions, give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[00:26:30.809 --> 00:26:33.872]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[00:26:33.872 --> 00:26:41.200]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol, and prescription medications.

[00:27:03.417 --> 00:27:10.699]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[00:27:10.699 --> 00:27:22.204]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network, Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[00:27:22.204 --> 00:27:23.024]  Central.
[00:27:23.024 --> 00:27:28.606]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[00:27:28.966 --> 00:27:35.350]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:40.474]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[00:27:40.474 --> 00:27:45.717]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.

[00:27:47.078 --> 00:27:48.079]  Central.

[00:28:51.685 --> 00:28:53.205]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:28:53.205 --> 00:28:54.546]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:07.023 --> 00:29:14.046]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:29:14.046 --> 00:29:20.748]  I want to thank my producer, Trey Kincaid, also my wife's been doing producing, Violet Jones.
[00:29:20.748 --> 00:29:34.874]  I want to thank everybody who's been joining us, Jim Tucker, Aaron Dykes for the stories he's been doing, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Ryan Slickheisen, everybody on the crew for doing such a fabulous job, Mike Nelson, the list goes on and on.
[00:29:36.713 --> 00:29:39.054]  Our IT people, everybody.
[00:29:39.054 --> 00:29:48.940]  Going back to Istanbul, we're talking to American documentary film-making crew, who are making a film, I guess, about people that cover these type of events.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.440]  Great guys.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.400]  They called me a few months ago.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.923]  I never got back with them like everybody else I don't get back with, but now I'm definitely getting with them here on air.
[00:29:55.923 --> 00:29:58.605]  And it's Andrew Neal and Luke Meyer.
[00:29:58.605 --> 00:29:59.565]  They're in Istanbul.
[00:29:59.565 --> 00:30:00.546]  We really appreciate their work.
[00:30:00.546 --> 00:30:04.388]  And they're in a hotel room with Romanian filmmaker Paul.
[00:30:05.004 --> 00:30:11.289]  Duranu, I believe that's the right way to pronounce it, and we're just again very thankful to have them there with us from Istanbul.
[00:30:11.289 --> 00:30:29.164]  Gentlemen, let me give us the lay of the land, what your trip was like getting over there, how the papers first reported that it was the classes to divert everybody, now that same paper's putting out disinfo pieces worshipping Bilderberg about how good they are, and then just basically what you witnessed, how the riot police were dressed,
[00:30:29.645 --> 00:30:34.909]  Some of the physical things that you saw, because I know you're not really doing a thing on Bilderberg.
[00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:37.071]  You're doing it on people who cover Bilderberg.
[00:30:37.071 --> 00:30:43.416]  But I think now it's just kind of convincing you about the wickedness of Bilderberg, the security.
[00:30:43.416 --> 00:30:52.022]  One of the most interesting things, I think, for Luke and Nye, and I guess Jim was talking about it some, too, is that in America, you hear very little about these issues.
[00:30:54.782 --> 00:30:55.923]  This is pretty newsworthy.
[00:30:55.923 --> 00:31:00.585]  I mean, when Davos meets, and there aren't even as many elites there, I mean, this is the creme de la creme.
[00:31:00.585 --> 00:31:02.385]  Davos is a step below this.
[00:31:02.385 --> 00:31:04.226]  I mean, that's a big international spectacle.
[00:31:04.226 --> 00:31:06.167]  Why is it this news?
[00:31:06.167 --> 00:31:07.608]  Yeah, it was interesting.
[00:31:07.608 --> 00:31:14.210]  Jim was saying, you know, that he felt as though, you know, that there was a lot, actually, there was a lot more coverage of it.
[00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.731]  Oh, this is the breakthrough year.
[00:31:15.731 --> 00:31:20.993]  I mean, last year was the break in the ice, and that got a hole in their armor, but that was the kink in the armor.
[00:31:20.993 --> 00:31:22.994]  This year drove a huge spike right into their heart.
[00:31:23.891 --> 00:31:26.232]  How's it being covered back in the States right now?
[00:31:26.232 --> 00:31:30.414]  It's all over the newspapers.
[00:31:30.414 --> 00:31:36.076]  We're talking about less than 20 mentions in the last 50 years in U.S.
[00:31:36.076 --> 00:31:41.839]  newspapers, and there's more than 20 articles and TV reports on it in just the last day.
[00:31:41.839 --> 00:31:49.102]  So there's been more coverage in the last 24 hours in the United States than there has been on Bilderberg in the last 20, 30, 50 years.
[00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:52.321]  It's amazing.
[00:31:52.321 --> 00:31:56.363]  Yeah, well, there's an energy to it here as well.
[00:31:56.363 --> 00:32:05.667]  I think, obviously, some of the regulars that come from the United States or other parts of Europe probably weren't able to make it because of the travel expense, you know?
[00:32:05.667 --> 00:32:12.110]  But there was a lot of buzz about it, and every day at 4, Jim is mobbed at his hotel.
[00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:13.611]  People showing up, taking pictures.
[00:32:13.611 --> 00:32:16.132]  I mean, he's practically like a celebrity here.
[00:32:16.132 --> 00:32:17.833]  And then we're running around after him, too.
[00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:27.101]  There's kind of a bit of a circus running around after Jim, so he's probably not as covert as he might be, but he still goes to meet his sources by himself.
[00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:28.902]  Now, who are you guys making your film for?
[00:32:28.902 --> 00:32:33.506]  Because this is something I definitely want to carry when it comes out.
[00:32:33.506 --> 00:32:41.512]  We're an independent production company, so we're trying to acquire funding for it, and we're getting going, trying to make a promo or whatever.
[00:32:42.096 --> 00:32:50.522]  You know, basically the film is about the people who are trying to bring the New World Order concept into the mainstream.
[00:32:50.522 --> 00:32:58.988]  Our producer, Tom Davis, who worked on some of our other films, started talking to Luke and I about it, and we didn't know that much about it.
[00:32:58.988 --> 00:33:03.011]  He got kind of interested in it, and then started surfing the web and stuff.
[00:33:03.878 --> 00:33:13.807]  Well, I'm interested because you guys obviously came to this as virgins to it all.
[00:33:13.807 --> 00:33:15.048]  Now do you think it's nefarious?
[00:33:15.048 --> 00:33:15.908]  Do you think it's dark?
[00:33:15.908 --> 00:33:18.350]  Do you think it's happy-loving?
[00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.712]  Well, it's definitely not happy-loving.
[00:33:20.712 --> 00:33:26.217]  I mean, there's a lot of policemen around and you don't have any idea what's going on inside the gate.
[00:33:32.574 --> 00:33:44.942]  You know, start surfing the web and stuff, and just started, you know, running into all the personalities we're doing, and... Well, I'm interested because you guys are... You guys, you know, obviously, you know, came to this as virgins to it all.
[00:33:44.942 --> 00:33:46.243]  Now, do you think it's nefarious?
[00:33:46.243 --> 00:33:47.043]  Do you think it's dark?
[00:33:47.043 --> 00:33:49.465]  Do you think it's happy-loving?
[00:33:49.465 --> 00:33:51.846]  Well, it's definitely not happy-loving.
[00:33:51.846 --> 00:33:58.411]  I mean, there's a lot of policemen around, and, um, you know, you just... You don't have any idea what they're going on... What's going on inside the gate.
[00:33:58.411 --> 00:33:59.071]  Highly secret.
[00:33:59.071 --> 00:33:59.972]  Highly protected.
[00:33:59.972 --> 00:34:01.893]  Yeah, Luke, pop in and give us your take on all this.
[00:34:03.431 --> 00:34:09.657]  Well, I mean, all I know is really what I'm seeing right now, and that's how full force the police exist.
[00:34:09.657 --> 00:34:12.199]  Okay, that proves it's nefarious right there.
[00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:14.581]  Then we get their minutes out of the meetings.
[00:34:14.581 --> 00:34:17.483]  They literally created the European Union.
[00:34:17.483 --> 00:34:21.507]  They ran the whole deal with Prince Bernhard and the royalty out of England.
[00:34:22.212 --> 00:34:27.796]  They ran the entire show, and they're trying to set up a world tax.
[00:34:27.796 --> 00:34:30.938]  My point is, is that there's no way to be neutral on this.
[00:34:30.938 --> 00:34:34.801]  It'd be like being filmmakers, and either you're for Hitler or you're against Hitler.
[00:34:34.801 --> 00:34:37.202]  You know, you're either for Stalin or you're against Stalin.
[00:34:37.202 --> 00:34:41.165]  And I understand you're trying to make an objective film about the movement, and let people decide on their own.
[00:34:41.165 --> 00:34:42.666]  I'm not putting you on the spot.
[00:34:42.666 --> 00:34:47.189]  I'm just telling you, as human beings, can you not see who these people are?
[00:34:47.189 --> 00:34:48.390]  This is the enemy of humanity.
[00:34:49.679 --> 00:35:03.782]  Yeah, well, we're just, we're really at the very beginning of our stages of getting to know this and we're trying to get to know it through our characters, you know, but in my opinion, you know, there's a lot of unanswered questions that over the course of the next year, you know, I would hope I would get the answer to some of those.
[00:35:03.782 --> 00:35:15.824]  And really, you know, for me as a filmmaker, and I don't know if you agree with me, but like, we're just really interested by, you know, basically you guys, you know, and the amount of work and effort
[00:35:16.414 --> 00:35:27.261]  You've put into it and what brought you to it because no one was talking about it, you know, even five years ago and there's been a small group of people that have been talking about it.
[00:35:27.261 --> 00:35:30.863]  Well listen, I'm finishing endgame in the next month and a half.
[00:35:30.863 --> 00:35:32.744]  If you guys want to come to Austin, Texas,
[00:35:35.542 --> 00:35:35.902]  Sure, sure.
[00:35:35.902 --> 00:35:47.798]  Well, I know you tried to contact me a few months ago and I never got back with you because I'm flooded, but come to Austin and if you want to do some limited footage swap, because I'm going to do an update in the film before I finish it just about how Perry went.
[00:35:47.798 --> 00:35:48.239]  It's going to be like
[00:35:48.709 --> 00:35:52.771]  Probably two minutes of my film that, oh by the way, in 2007, Perry went.
[00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:55.953]  But if you guys want any of my footage from last year, I'd be happy to swap it.
[00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:59.314]  But it's got to be quick and we're going to do it, because Endgame's almost done.
[00:35:59.314 --> 00:36:01.535]  But yeah, you guys turn around and get down to Austin.
[00:36:01.535 --> 00:36:05.117]  We'll be back early next week, so maybe we can get in touch with you then.
[00:36:05.117 --> 00:36:08.158]  Yeah, basically, I've got picture lock in one month.
[00:36:08.158 --> 00:36:10.219]  And then I've got to have Graham Reynolds do the music.
[00:36:10.219 --> 00:36:11.180]  He's already working on it.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.201]  And I've got all the graphics houses.
[00:36:13.201 --> 00:36:16.262]  I've got two different graphics houses doing graphics on it.
[00:36:16.262 --> 00:36:17.363]  I'm trying to up my films.
[00:36:18.024 --> 00:36:19.765]  And, you know, Terror Storm was the next level.
[00:36:19.765 --> 00:36:22.326]  This is going to be the next level after that.
[00:36:22.326 --> 00:36:32.029]  But the point is, you've got to rush down, and just a few selects of Jim being mobbed or the police, and then I'll be glad to give you guys quite a bit of my footage, because I'm all about getting the information out.
[00:36:32.029 --> 00:36:33.630]  That way you'll have Canada.
[00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:41.473]  But that aside, anything else you want to add before I get the Romanian filmmaker who's waiting on the wings on?
[00:36:42.528 --> 00:36:49.892]  Yeah, I mean, just one thing, you know, maybe Alex, you could give us some recommendations and we'd love to talk to you too, but, you know, we're looking for more people.
[00:36:49.892 --> 00:36:54.515]  You know, Jim is obviously the oldest guy, but we're looking for younger guys who are also in the movement.
[00:36:54.515 --> 00:36:55.756]  Daniel Esselstyn.
[00:36:55.756 --> 00:36:58.077]  Daniel Esselstyn, but you know, of course, he's got a sick family member.
[00:36:58.077 --> 00:36:59.278]  This is one of the first times.
[00:36:59.278 --> 00:37:00.298]  He couldn't make it this year.
[00:37:00.298 --> 00:37:01.719]  We were looking forward to talking to him.
[00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:04.861]  First time in 15 years.
[00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:07.322]  Yeah, it was unfortunate.
[00:37:07.322 --> 00:37:11.725]  We were looking forward to talking to him, but maybe we'll get a chance to see him again in the future, or maybe Bilderberg next year.
[00:37:12.321 --> 00:37:18.744]  We've been thinking about trying to follow... Well, there's a fella in England who I've interviewed who has Bilderberg.org.
[00:37:18.744 --> 00:37:19.885]  He'd be good to interview.
[00:37:19.885 --> 00:37:20.865]  Obviously, I'd be good to interview.
[00:37:20.865 --> 00:37:21.985]  You've already been trying.
[00:37:21.985 --> 00:37:27.128]  And then there's... I can think of just a few others, but there are quite a few.
[00:37:27.128 --> 00:37:31.070]  I know Michael Piper's covered it quite a bit.
[00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:31.610]  Alright, cool.
[00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:34.211]  We look forward to touching base with you next week.
[00:37:34.211 --> 00:37:36.012]  Do you want us to get Paul on the line here?
[00:37:36.653 --> 00:37:37.213]  Absolutely.
[00:37:37.213 --> 00:37:39.154]  In fact, I would... when are you guys flying out?
[00:37:39.154 --> 00:37:44.835]  Because I'd like to get a report from you guys Monday or Tuesday, kind of debrief you on air once you get back.
[00:37:44.835 --> 00:37:47.055]  Uh, we're leaving Monday morning.
[00:37:47.055 --> 00:37:50.196]  Not for the flight time, but sometime on Monday we'll be flying back.
[00:37:50.196 --> 00:37:52.676]  Okay, well, then that means I'll have to have you on Tuesday or Wednesday.
[00:37:52.676 --> 00:37:59.198]  Uh, let me just have my producer call you when this interview's over to make sure I've got all your contact points, not just there at the hotel.
[00:37:59.198 --> 00:38:00.798]  That's how I got... Okay, cool.
[00:38:00.798 --> 00:38:01.798]  Sounds good.
[00:38:01.798 --> 00:38:02.599]  Yeah, fan... Alright, great.
[00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:04.399]  Should we just... should we just put Paul Wright on?
[00:38:05.314 --> 00:38:10.098]  Yeah, and is it correct to pronounce his name Paul Duranu?
[00:38:10.098 --> 00:38:11.139]  Dornanu.
[00:38:11.139 --> 00:38:11.719]  Dornanu.
[00:38:11.719 --> 00:38:12.360]  Okay, thank you.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:12.980]  Yes, put him on.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:13.881]  Thank you.
[00:38:13.881 --> 00:38:14.862]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[00:38:14.862 --> 00:38:17.944]  I appreciate you, Andrew Neal and Luke Meyer.
[00:38:17.944 --> 00:38:25.090]  Thank you for reporting for us from Istanbul.
[00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:28.973]  Okay, is this Paul Duranu?
[00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:30.634]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:38:30.634 --> 00:38:31.214]  Hello, Paul.
[00:38:31.214 --> 00:38:32.355]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[00:38:32.355 --> 00:38:34.377]  Tell us about what you witnessed there and what your film is about.
[00:38:35.347 --> 00:38:47.817]  Well, I checked first thing in the morning the Classes Hotel because Jim Tucker had thought that that might be the actual site for the board meeting and I went there and there's nothing.
[00:38:47.817 --> 00:38:59.506]  I also was tipped by the lady in the lobby to go to the Classes Golf and Country Club which is like 10 miles north from there and I checked there but still nothing there.
[00:39:00.479 --> 00:39:12.150]  Uh, everything happens, uh, at the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where, uh, like, uh, the other guys said, uh, basically it's packed with, uh, policemen, uh, armed armed guards, securities.
[00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:25.522]  I actually managed to, uh, to get stills and video shots with, uh, people on the roof of a side of a building where there were, uh, securities, uh, uh, military men with binoculars.
[00:39:25.522 --> 00:39:26.583]  They were looking at me.
[00:39:27.499 --> 00:39:29.361]  And even civilians.
[00:39:29.361 --> 00:39:33.684]  There were groups of people talking there on the roof.
[00:39:33.684 --> 00:39:44.632]  And basically, I think we can get later, look at the pictures on the computer and see more details of what I got.
[00:39:44.632 --> 00:39:45.213]  Absolutely.
[00:39:45.213 --> 00:39:53.379]  Pictures are now starting to come out online on different websites, different Turkish newspapers of the usual suspects, David Rockefeller and others.
[00:39:53.379 --> 00:39:55.881]  Have you been able to see Texas Governor Rick Perry yet?
[00:39:56.889 --> 00:39:57.610]  No, no, no.
[00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:09.418]  I haven't been able to see anyone actually, but only got pictures of a black limo who entered the second gate, which is the gate on the street, which is blocked.
[00:40:09.418 --> 00:40:11.099]  You can't enter that street.
[00:40:11.099 --> 00:40:16.703]  So I think from this point of view, the Ritz-Carlton site is perfect for their situation because
[00:40:17.396 --> 00:40:22.077]  Nobody can actually get very close to the main entry.
[00:40:22.077 --> 00:40:24.038]  There's a large crowd.
[00:40:24.038 --> 00:40:24.898]  Tell us about yourself.
[00:40:24.898 --> 00:40:28.118]  Is this your first time covering Bilderberg, Paul?
[00:40:28.118 --> 00:40:29.399]  Yes, this is the first time.
[00:40:29.399 --> 00:40:37.821]  I have my own website, which I launched a couple of weeks ago, Infocon.ro.
[00:40:37.821 --> 00:40:39.181]  Spell that out for people.
[00:40:39.181 --> 00:40:40.341]  Spell out your website, please.
[00:40:40.341 --> 00:40:44.282]  Info, I-N-F-O-E-O-N dot R-O.
[00:40:44.835 --> 00:40:51.458]  It's a new website and I've been listening to your show and watching the websites for a couple of years now.
[00:40:51.458 --> 00:40:52.278]  Oh, fantastic!
[00:40:52.278 --> 00:40:55.639]  So you've been taking pictures and you're going to upload those to your website?
[00:40:55.639 --> 00:40:56.219]  Yes, yes.
[00:40:56.219 --> 00:40:57.760]  So we'll try.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.481]  The problem is that here the internet is very, very slow and wireless is not reliable.
[00:41:01.481 --> 00:41:01.861]  I understand.
[00:41:01.861 --> 00:41:06.123]  Well, listen, get those up as soon as you can and we'll post them as well if that's okay with you and write an article about it.
[00:41:06.923 --> 00:41:12.486]  Yeah, probably Sunday night when I get back to Bucharest, because I drove here with a car.
[00:41:12.486 --> 00:41:17.488]  Okay, spell that out slowly for people, because if I had trouble covering it, others are.
[00:41:17.488 --> 00:41:20.249]  Spell out your website, Slate.
[00:41:20.249 --> 00:41:25.892]  I-N-F-O-E-O-N dot R-O.
[00:41:25.892 --> 00:41:28.553]  Infocon.com?
[00:41:28.553 --> 00:41:30.734]  No, Infocon.ro.
[00:41:30.734 --> 00:41:31.935]  R-O from Romania.
[00:41:31.935 --> 00:41:32.575]  Dot R-O.
[00:41:32.575 --> 00:41:34.096]  So it's Infocon.ro.
[00:41:35.362 --> 00:41:36.062]  That's exactly.
[00:41:36.062 --> 00:41:41.703]  Okay, well we'll be watching that Sunday and we'll do a report on it, sir.
[00:41:41.703 --> 00:41:48.225]  I mean, describe... I was hearing that there are riot police out there.
[00:41:48.225 --> 00:42:03.088]  Yeah, there's a lot of police and what I understand is that they actually were afraid of riots because I understand that people, Turkish people, do easily get together and start riots.
[00:42:04.558 --> 00:42:05.839]  Big meetings.
[00:42:05.839 --> 00:42:22.528]  Actually, there was a couple of days ago a meeting in a square near the Bridge Carlton Hotel from an organization, I don't know the name, something like Global Peace and... I don't remember exactly the name, but... Oh, that's major news!
[00:42:22.528 --> 00:42:24.869]  Now, state that again.
[00:42:24.869 --> 00:42:26.490]  Exactly what happened at the Ridge Carlton?
[00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:27.551]  There was some type of protest?
[00:42:28.724 --> 00:42:37.769]  Uh, yeah, there was a small protest, not at Ritz-Carlton, but in a square near Ritz-Carlton, not very far, like under one mile.
[00:42:37.769 --> 00:42:38.049]  Really?
[00:42:38.049 --> 00:42:39.510]  People protesting Bilderberg?
[00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:40.790]  How many?
[00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:45.312]  Bilderberg and anti-nuclear things.
[00:42:45.312 --> 00:42:46.173]  Sure, how many people?
[00:42:47.592 --> 00:42:51.856]  I think there were like up to 100 people, something like that.
[00:42:51.856 --> 00:42:54.618]  I'm not sure because I got late.
[00:42:54.618 --> 00:42:59.442]  That's got to be the biggest Bilderberg protest I've ever heard of because they're so secret.
[00:42:59.442 --> 00:43:03.345]  Of course, 100 will probably be 10,000 next year, wherever they have it.
[00:43:03.345 --> 00:43:11.352]  And after that it was a press conference in Turkey about this protest that was organized.
[00:43:11.352 --> 00:43:13.393]  And Jim was there too.
[00:43:13.393 --> 00:43:15.435]  What inspired you to cover Bilderberg?
[00:43:16.914 --> 00:43:21.277]  Well, I think the same thing as you do.
[00:43:21.277 --> 00:43:24.840]  I want people to find out about this stuff.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:28.763]  Lots of people do not believe Bilderberg exists.
[00:43:28.763 --> 00:43:36.709]  And this is a way where I can actually prove that they do exist, that there's something going on.
[00:43:36.709 --> 00:43:44.675]  If I can describe this Bilderberg meeting, it's similar to a conference that has taken place in Bucharest in Romania in September.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:44:01.850]  That is, the francophonic meeting where, like, presidents and ministers from a lot of countries, at least a couple of dozen countries, countries that do speak French, came to Bucharest.
[00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:11.436]  So basically the Parliament building where was the meeting was sealed off, all the streets around it, lots of policemen, snipers on the buildings, and so on.
[00:44:12.539 --> 00:44:14.380]  I mean, is this freedom?
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:28.283]  Is this a free society with elites meeting in secret and our politicians present themselves like vegetables or fruit at a fruit stand to be squeezed on and smelled and examined to see which person they want to buy or back?
[00:44:28.283 --> 00:44:31.344]  I mean, there's no doubt there's a global problem.
[00:44:31.344 --> 00:44:34.265]  No, clearly it's not a free society.
[00:44:34.919 --> 00:44:40.422]  We should know about what they are talking there because they are going there on our expenses.
[00:44:40.422 --> 00:44:48.947]  There are public figures which are elected by us, so we have to know what's happening there.
[00:44:48.947 --> 00:45:00.995]  I said public figures that were elected, not everyone is elected, because let's consider Barroso, which is the president of the European Commission, which is not listed by name.
[00:45:02.901 --> 00:45:09.143]  Deborah Rosso was just over here a few weeks ago with Bush, openly announcing a merger of the EU and the American Union.
[00:45:09.143 --> 00:45:14.124]  It was on C-SPAN, and we read an article about it, and people couldn't even grasp how big it was.
[00:45:14.124 --> 00:45:17.205]  I mean, when I say a story is big, folks, it's big.
[00:45:17.205 --> 00:45:20.286]  And this stuff is just happening right out in the open, America and the world.
[00:45:21.355 --> 00:45:24.217]  Sovereignty is dying, not with a bang, but with a whimper.
[00:45:24.217 --> 00:45:31.084]  Well, listen, we're going to watch your site, sir, and we'll get a report out on your photos as soon as that's OK.
[00:45:31.084 --> 00:45:37.090]  And is it all right with you when we link to your site, because your site might crash if we send 5 million people there?
[00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.613]  Is it OK if we go ahead and post your photos on prisonplanet.com?
[00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:42.351]  Yes, that's right.
[00:45:42.351 --> 00:45:49.536]  I think I'll get in contact with you and send you a link where I can upload some quality photos for you.
[00:45:49.536 --> 00:45:50.056]  Do that!
[00:45:50.056 --> 00:45:52.397]  Listen, Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[00:45:52.397 --> 00:45:55.119]  He's the guy that's working the hardest right now in the organization.
[00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:55.939]  Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[00:45:59.088 --> 00:45:59.889]  Two ways.
[00:45:59.889 --> 00:46:01.431]  We'll do that.
[00:46:01.431 --> 00:46:01.851]  Absolutely.
[00:46:01.851 --> 00:46:04.874]  In fact, if you send them to us, we'll get them up and put a link to your site, sir.
[00:46:04.874 --> 00:46:06.415]  And, of course, we'll probably crash your site.
[00:46:06.415 --> 00:46:12.661]  My email is paul at info-con.org.
[00:46:12.661 --> 00:46:13.282]  Okay, well, sure.
[00:46:13.282 --> 00:46:15.404]  We can just go to your site and contact you that way.
[00:46:15.404 --> 00:46:18.507]  Then we will send you our contact info.
[00:46:18.507 --> 00:46:20.229]  It's great working with you, and God bless you.
[00:46:20.229 --> 00:46:21.650]  I look forward to interviewing you.
[00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:22.851]  Thank you for having me on your show.
[00:46:23.812 --> 00:46:24.273]  You bet.
[00:46:24.273 --> 00:46:30.403]  Let me just, just hand the phone back briefly if you can, if they're still there, to Andrew Neal and the guys.
[00:46:30.403 --> 00:46:31.665]  I don't want to let them go quite yet.
[00:46:31.665 --> 00:46:32.566]  Okay, Paul?
[00:46:32.566 --> 00:46:32.907]  Okay.
[00:46:32.907 --> 00:46:33.267]  Okay.
[00:46:33.267 --> 00:46:33.528]  Okay.
[00:46:33.528 --> 00:46:34.209]  Thank you.
[00:46:34.209 --> 00:46:37.394]  And then we're scheduled to have Daniel Estelan on from Spain.
[00:46:38.568 --> 00:46:42.790]  Uh, he's got a family member who's very sick, but I want his analysis.
[00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:45.291]  He's one of the, I'd say the foremost analyst.
[00:46:45.291 --> 00:46:48.333]  He's the best-selling author of Club Bilderberg.
[00:46:48.333 --> 00:46:50.954]  We've got him coming up in the next hour.
[00:46:50.954 --> 00:46:52.855]  Uh, ladies and gentlemen, this is Alex Jones.
[00:46:52.855 --> 00:46:54.576]  I wasn't going to take a day of vacation.
[00:46:54.576 --> 00:46:55.156]  Not doing it now.
[00:46:59.247 --> 00:46:59.928]  It's here.
[00:46:59.928 --> 00:47:05.076]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:47:05.076 --> 00:47:12.727]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:47:13.419 --> 00:47:20.864]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:47:20.864 --> 00:47:32.611]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:47:32.611 --> 00:47:36.574]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:47:36.574 --> 00:47:38.835]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:47:38.835 --> 00:47:42.678]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:47:56.209 --> 00:47:59.430]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:02.531]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:48:02.531 --> 00:48:09.113]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfalls, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:48:09.113 --> 00:48:16.616]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:48:16.616 --> 00:48:20.617]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophe.
[00:48:20.657 --> 00:48:21.437]  We're good to go!
[00:48:55.852 --> 00:48:57.793]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:48:57.793 --> 00:49:01.814]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:49:01.814 --> 00:49:10.896]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:49:10.896 --> 00:49:15.798]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:49:16.118 --> 00:49:25.369]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[00:49:25.369 --> 00:49:31.636]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.
[00:49:31.636 --> 00:49:34.599]  Turn your internet on and off with one simple switch.
[00:49:34.799 --> 00:49:38.240]  There's no software to load, and it's so easy to install.

[00:49:56.844 --> 00:50:03.446]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:22.506]  Live from Istanbul, ladies and gentlemen, we've interviewed Jim Tucker, we've interviewed Andrew Neal, Luke Meyer, Paul Duranenu from Romania, Daniel Estolans has a family member on death's doorstep, but he has still got great contacts inside.
[00:50:22.506 --> 00:50:26.748]  He's the most informed on Bilderberg, covering for 15 years.
[00:50:26.748 --> 00:50:28.229]  He's going to be with us in the next hour.
[00:50:28.229 --> 00:50:32.792]  We're about to go to him in about 60 seconds, but just saying bye to Andrew Neal and Luke Meyer,
[00:50:33.283 --> 00:50:41.509]  Gentlemen, American filmmakers, were you able to see any of the Bilderberg group, or is there just too much security this year?
[00:50:41.509 --> 00:50:46.312]  We were not able to see really anyone because the barricades are so far away.
[00:50:46.312 --> 00:50:54.658]  But Jim was saying something about how they let them in, like I think they tried to stagger it and stuff so you couldn't see, you know?
[00:50:54.658 --> 00:50:59.441]  There's no helipads, there's no motorcade of cars going in.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:13.128]  And we were usually with Jim, but there were a couple, like Paul, for instance, that was just out there all day, and some of the other guys that were here chasing the Bilderbergers were also out there, like, all day.
[00:51:13.128 --> 00:51:20.453]  So I think they got a couple pictures, and I think you touched base with Paul, and hopefully they'll be able to get you some stuff that you can use.
[00:51:20.453 --> 00:51:21.073]  Absolutely.
[00:51:21.073 --> 00:51:26.897]  I want to thank you, gentlemen, for the great job you've been doing, and I appreciate it, and I look forward to debriefing you next week.
[00:51:26.897 --> 00:51:27.437]  We'll talk then.
[00:51:29.207 --> 00:51:29.707]  Okay, cool.
[00:51:29.707 --> 00:51:30.928]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[00:51:30.928 --> 00:51:32.488]  Take care and God bless.
[00:51:32.488 --> 00:51:39.610]  All right, now going to Daniel Estillon, and coming up in the next hour, folks, I've got huge reports of my own with Rick Perry and massive corruption.
[00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:47.633]  This stuff, Violating Logan Act, Bilderberg group members that are under indictment that Perry's involved with in a business.
[00:51:47.633 --> 00:51:48.533]  This stuff is huge.
[00:51:48.533 --> 00:51:50.494]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:51:50.494 --> 00:51:56.216]  Daniel Estillon, I feel guilty twisting your arm to come on with your mother-in-law in deep trouble, but we should all pray for her.
[00:51:56.216 --> 00:51:57.056]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[00:51:57.839 --> 00:52:01.381]  Alex, great to be lined back to your show, and it's always a pleasure.
[00:52:01.381 --> 00:52:02.382]  Well, thank you.
[00:52:02.382 --> 00:52:08.525]  I'm sad you can't be there, but you are still on the phone, you're on the internet, you've got the sources, you've got huge news on Zolocal.
[00:52:08.525 --> 00:52:10.186]  Give us the info.
[00:52:10.186 --> 00:52:12.207]  Alright, I just jotted down a few points.
[00:52:12.207 --> 00:52:12.988]  I'll just start going.
[00:52:12.988 --> 00:52:15.109]  When you get tired of listening to me, just tell me to stop.
[00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:16.090]  We're going to break here in a minute.
[00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:17.170]  We'll just come back and continue.
[00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:18.151]  Go ahead.
[00:52:18.151 --> 00:52:20.672]  Okay, now Robert Zoloc and the World Bank nomination.
[00:52:20.672 --> 00:52:21.293]  Now, the U.S.
[00:52:21.293 --> 00:52:21.873]  delegation
[00:52:22.799 --> 00:52:27.863]  ...is standing unanimously behind Robert Zoellick's candidacy as an ex-president of the World Bank.
[00:52:27.863 --> 00:52:31.386]  Now, Zoellick is a 53-year-old Wall Street executive.
[00:52:31.386 --> 00:52:34.749]  He's a former administration official and a free market fundamentalist.
[00:52:34.749 --> 00:52:39.613]  Now, during the Bill of Rights meeting yesterday, he pledged to work to restore confidence in the bank.
[00:52:39.613 --> 00:52:43.956]  Now, he said, we need to put our differences aside and focus on the future together.
[00:52:43.956 --> 00:52:48.220]  I believe, Zoellick said, that the World Bank's best days are still to come.
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:52.243]  Now, the chances of Zoellick not being approved for the chair of the World Bank Presidency
[00:52:52.742 --> 00:52:53.123]  I think?
[00:53:10.825 --> 00:53:18.652]  According to a source at the conference, European Bilderbergers are not at all pleased, Alex, with continuing the status quo in which the U.S.
[00:53:18.652 --> 00:53:23.055]  nominates a single candidate after informal consultation with the bank members.
[00:53:23.055 --> 00:53:33.384]  Now, the nomination also appears to short-circuit burgeoning calls for reform of this selection process at the bank, one of the cornerstones of a global financial architecture as designed by the
[00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:47.778]  According to our sources at the conference, one Belgian Bilderberger proposed what he said, a merit-based selection process without regard to nationality, something which will obviously be discarded by the inept Bush administration.
[00:53:47.778 --> 00:54:01.507]  What is rather quite remarkable is that on several occasions, European Bilderbergers have openly rejected the current model, saying that the nomination reeks of double standards, especially because the United States and the World Bank preach
[00:54:01.954 --> 00:54:02.415]  I don't know.
[00:54:21.934 --> 00:54:23.816]  ...would remain in the hands of the Americans.
[00:54:23.816 --> 00:54:25.898]  Daniel Estelin, stay right there.
[00:54:25.898 --> 00:54:28.320]  Daniel has been writing incredible reports.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.143]  This sounds like one that hasn't even been published yet.
[00:54:31.143 --> 00:54:32.945]  He's giving you the scoop here first.
[00:54:32.945 --> 00:54:35.968]  We'll be right back.
[00:54:35.968 --> 00:54:40.852]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:54:46.221 --> 00:54:49.562]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:54:49.562 --> 00:54:54.745]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:54:54.745 --> 00:54:59.387]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:54:59.387 --> 00:55:08.510]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:12.112]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:55:12.412 --> 00:55:17.738]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:55:17.738 --> 00:55:24.445]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:55:24.952 --> 00:55:26.252]  What about you?
[00:55:26.252 --> 00:55:31.654]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:55:31.654 --> 00:55:32.834]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:55:32.834 --> 00:55:34.715]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:55:34.715 --> 00:55:36.035]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:55:36.035 --> 00:55:37.535]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:56:00.535 --> 00:56:05.358]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:56:05.358 --> 00:56:06.939]  You want answers?
[00:56:06.939 --> 00:56:08.880]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:12.682]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:12.682 --> 00:56:20.847]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:56:20.847 --> 00:56:22.868]  It is now hour number two.
[00:56:22.868 --> 00:56:29.652]  We had four different reporters and journalists on, including Jim Tucker, in the last hour from.
[00:56:30.885 --> 00:56:36.808]  The Bilderberg meeting covering it in Istanbul, Turkey, formerly Constantinople.
[00:56:36.808 --> 00:56:37.709]  Why I mention that?
[00:56:37.709 --> 00:56:38.569]  I'm just into history.
[00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:41.831]  The point is, Daniel Estelin joins us from Spain.
[00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:46.373]  He's been to the last 15 meetings, but he has a family member on death's doorstep.
[00:56:46.373 --> 00:56:47.654]  We need to pray for her.
[00:56:47.654 --> 00:56:52.717]  So he's unable to attend, but he is continuing with the best analysis, and he's huge in endgame.
[00:56:52.717 --> 00:56:53.777]  Wait till he comes out.
[00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:54.618]  We couldn't do it without him.
[00:56:55.051 --> 00:56:57.073]  Daniel Estillon also, of course, has his website.
[00:56:57.073 --> 00:57:00.315]  We have links to it on InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com.
[00:57:00.315 --> 00:57:03.858]  A week and a half ago, he got the entire guest list.
[00:57:03.858 --> 00:57:05.579]  His info is always checked out.
[00:57:05.579 --> 00:57:12.324]  He's giving you huge news on Zelikow, a very dangerous globalist, somebody that I was informed of 10 years ago.
[00:57:12.324 --> 00:57:13.865]  They said, watch this guy.
[00:57:13.865 --> 00:57:15.606]  He is very, very important.
[00:57:15.606 --> 00:57:17.908]  And there's all these other people involved as well.
[00:57:17.908 --> 00:57:21.831]  Going back to Daniel Estillon, please continue with that analysis you were going over, sir.
[00:57:22.625 --> 00:57:29.550]  Well, it's funny Alex, you should say that you were informed of Zelleck's dangers to the international community ten years ago.
[00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:34.655]  I too was told by people who are close to the Billiburr community that... Yes, Zelleck and... Zelleck, I'm sorry.
[00:57:34.655 --> 00:57:35.335]  That's right, that's right.
[00:57:35.335 --> 00:57:44.722]  Now, Zelleck's name also raises eyebrows, Alex, among development groups for his close ties to the Est establishment as well as his relationship to the corporate interests.
[00:57:44.722 --> 00:57:46.564]  One of the attendees at the Billiburr conference
[00:57:47.199 --> 00:57:50.401]  I have not had the confirmation as to who this individual is.
[00:57:50.401 --> 00:58:09.214]  Asked Zolik how he was planning to patch up relationships with third and fourth world nations when he is best remembered during his tenure as United States Trade Representative for arm-twisting poor nations' governments to adhere to United States-imposed intellectual property laws that make medicines, for example, unaffordable to the developing world.
[00:58:09.214 --> 00:58:12.336]  Zolik didn't say anything, which, again, are rhetorical questions.
[00:58:12.336 --> 00:58:14.578]  A snickering was heard in the room.
[00:58:14.972 --> 00:58:20.974]  Now, he's been also a close friend to the brand-name pharmaceutical industry and the bilateral trade agreements.
[00:58:20.974 --> 00:58:31.376]  He has negotiated to effectively block access to genetic medication for millions of people, meaning basically that millions of people will die because they do not have access to cheap medicine.
[00:58:31.376 --> 00:58:34.717]  Which goes back to the population control agenda, correct?
[00:58:34.717 --> 00:58:35.797]  Exactly.
[00:58:35.797 --> 00:58:42.579]  However, what has really riled up both the American and European delegates is the fact that the World Bank's dirty linen is being washed in public.
[00:58:43.123 --> 00:58:49.447]  Thanks in great part to Paul Wolfowitz's ineptness, which, incidentally, Wolfowitz has blamed on the American press.
[00:58:49.447 --> 00:58:50.767]  That's quite cheeky of him.
[00:58:50.767 --> 00:59:08.477]  Now, I'd like to go over a little bit for your audiences, exactly explain what the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank stand for, what they are, because I think a lot of people think that they're good institutions that are supposed to be helping humanity, where in fact they've done more damage to the human race than any other financial institution in history, if I may.
[00:59:08.477 --> 00:59:08.998]  Alex?
[00:59:08.998 --> 00:59:09.738]  Yes, please continue.
[00:59:10.345 --> 00:59:10.685]  All right.
[00:59:10.685 --> 00:59:26.391]  Now, it's widely but mistakenly believed that the purpose of the World Bank, controlled by the United States Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund, of which the United States is the principal donor and the only nation with a veto power, is to encourage development and relieve poverty in the third world.
[00:59:26.391 --> 00:59:38.236]  But in practice, these organizations have added to the impoverishment and destitutions of millions through the loan scheme called the Structural Adjustment Programs, SAPs, that have succeeded in adding to the country's burden of debt
[00:59:38.886 --> 00:59:39.766]  And stagnation.
[00:59:39.766 --> 00:59:53.113]  Now, the obvious result of the SAPs from the World Bank and the IMF is that the money lent to the destitute nations were used to make immediate interest payments to Western banking institutions, something that both Jim Tucker and I have been saying for years.
[00:59:53.113 --> 01:00:04.018]  Now, furthermore, by ordering third world economies to focus on production for export purposes, the World Bank and the IMF channeled over almost $200 billion of the third world financial resources
[01:00:04.577 --> 01:00:06.818]  Daniel, final segment with you when we get back.
[01:00:06.818 --> 01:00:07.298]  By the way, folks,
[01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:33.894]  They're raping the third world.
[01:00:33.894 --> 01:00:39.127]  Now they're subdividing the assets of the United States, treating us like a third world nation.
[01:00:39.127 --> 01:00:40.270]  We are now on the chopping block.
[01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.651]  Stay with us.
[01:00:59.346 --> 01:01:00.007]  It's here.
[01:01:00.007 --> 01:01:05.154]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:01:05.154 --> 01:01:12.804]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:20.948]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:01:20.948 --> 01:01:32.673]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:01:32.673 --> 01:01:36.655]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:01:36.655 --> 01:01:38.916]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:01:38.916 --> 01:01:42.758]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:01:55.842 --> 01:02:01.326]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:02:01.326 --> 01:02:03.647]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:02:03.647 --> 01:02:10.892]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:02:10.892 --> 01:02:22.820]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.501]  It's multi-voltage capabilities,
[01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:30.466]  Multiple adapters and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:02:30.466 --> 01:02:35.590]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:40.894]  Disconnect your application and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[01:02:40.894 --> 01:02:46.979]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:02:46.979 --> 01:02:51.323]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:02:51.323 --> 01:02:52.324]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:02:57.942 --> 01:03:02.305]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:03:02.305 --> 01:03:04.327]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:03:04.327 --> 01:03:10.912]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:17.276]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:03:17.276 --> 01:03:23.321]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:03:23.581 --> 01:03:30.143]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:03:30.143 --> 01:03:33.984]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:03:33.984 --> 01:03:37.885]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:03:37.885 --> 01:03:40.546]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:03:40.546 --> 01:03:41.606]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:03:41.966 --> 01:03:45.147]  Coming up, we're going to re-air the Ron Paul interview from yesterday.
[01:04:10.822 --> 01:04:13.483]  Where he talked about the international conspiracy to overthrow America.
[01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:18.406]  Then the Stephen E. Jones, new information about thermite in the buildings and bombs.
[01:04:18.406 --> 01:04:19.806]  That's coming up in the third hour.
[01:04:19.806 --> 01:04:23.108]  Of course, Sunday I'll be on the air from 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:04:23.108 --> 01:04:24.068]  Central Time.
[01:04:24.068 --> 01:04:29.691]  Out of the studios of NewsRadio 590K LBJ and across the country on wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[01:04:30.493 --> 01:04:37.635]  The United Nations officially is saying the dollar could collapse, and when you actually read the document, they say they think it is going to collapse.
[01:04:37.635 --> 01:04:42.416]  Then, of course, look about the Amaro as the answer to counter the European Union.
[01:04:42.416 --> 01:04:45.417]  The Trilaterals wrote about this in 74.
[01:04:45.417 --> 01:04:49.258]  When the organization went public, they were actually set up in 73.
[01:04:49.258 --> 01:04:51.418]  It's all happening right now.
[01:04:51.418 --> 01:04:55.159]  When I tell you the information on PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com,
[01:04:55.916 --> 01:04:57.877]  is of the utmost importance, folks.
[01:04:57.877 --> 01:04:58.878]  You can bank it.
[01:04:58.878 --> 01:04:59.859]  Go read the articles.
[01:04:59.859 --> 01:05:03.901]  There's so many that Aaron has written, that Paul Watson has written, that Steve Watson has written.
[01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:05.502]  They're all huge.
[01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:07.743]  Everything that Ethel, I'm saying, is huge.
[01:05:07.743 --> 01:05:12.066]  What the guest said in the last hour, that was stuff from inside Bilderberg with Jim Tucker.
[01:05:12.066 --> 01:05:13.347]  Do you understand, folks?
[01:05:13.347 --> 01:05:14.888]  You can bank it over and over again.
[01:05:14.888 --> 01:05:16.029]  It's been accurate.
[01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:18.710]  These are the people steering the world's future.
[01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:19.771]  We're not talking about what some
[01:05:20.251 --> 01:05:20.812]  We're good to go.
[01:05:32.031 --> 01:05:34.192]  We're talking about the economy imploding.
[01:05:34.192 --> 01:05:36.192]  We're talking about troops in the streets.
[01:05:36.192 --> 01:05:37.953]  We're talking about martial law.
[01:05:37.953 --> 01:05:39.773]  We're talking about World War III.
[01:05:39.773 --> 01:05:41.814]  We're talking about one-world government.
[01:05:41.814 --> 01:05:45.275]  We're talking about biblical-type stuff here, okay?
[01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.396]  This is the real deal.
[01:05:47.396 --> 01:05:50.417]  Daniel Estolin, please continue, sir, in the last few minutes we've got with you.
[01:05:50.417 --> 01:05:50.937]  Great.
[01:05:50.937 --> 01:05:51.657]  Great to be back again.
[01:05:51.657 --> 01:05:57.939]  Now, one of the key, Alex, sticking points, as far as Zoellick's nomination is concerned, is, again, has to do with Africa.
[01:05:57.939 --> 01:06:01.100]  African states are unable to compete with Western multinationals.
[01:06:02.369 --> 01:06:05.692]  They've been forced to withdraw from the health sector as part of the free market economy.
[01:06:05.692 --> 01:06:10.495]  Now, again, it goes back to what you were saying about the Malthus, about the population reduction, etc.
[01:06:10.495 --> 01:06:23.484]  Now, this has put African children at the mercy of unscrupulous international organizations and pharmaceutical transnational corporations who are thus at liberty to use them as guinea pigs for testing various drugs and vaccines.
[01:06:23.484 --> 01:06:24.405]  Now, at a case in point,
[01:06:24.995 --> 01:06:35.903]  In January 2001, the US-based pharmaceutical TNC-Pfizer used an experimental drug on about 50,000 children suffering from meningitis in Kano, Nigeria, without official authorization.
[01:06:35.903 --> 01:06:42.708]  As a result of the epidemic, almost 15,000 people died, while many others became deaf and blind.
[01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:46.911]  Needless to say, we haven't heard about it in the United States, nor have we heard about it in Europe.
[01:06:47.455 --> 01:06:50.917]  But just a couple of other items on the agenda, which we're following from the Bill of Rights Conference.
[01:06:50.917 --> 01:06:58.041]  Now, the European relations with Russia, needless to say, is a key sticking point, not only in Europe, but also in Central Asia.
[01:06:58.041 --> 01:07:01.744]  We'll have a complete report on that next week, once the conference is finished.
[01:07:01.744 --> 01:07:04.886]  With Moscow making a deal... Daniel, let's stop you right there.
[01:07:04.886 --> 01:07:13.751]  Now, you graciously let us post all your stuff at prisonblooded.com and infowars.com, but tell folks the address for your fabulous news site.
[01:07:14.728 --> 01:07:20.209]  It's www.danielestulin.com, E-S-T-U-L-I-N.
[01:07:20.209 --> 01:07:24.610]  Today, by the way, Alex, the Turkish edition of my Billenburg book is out.
[01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:30.992]  And on the 1st of September, the American edition of the true story of the Billenburg will be out in the United States.
[01:07:30.992 --> 01:07:32.492]  You know, today I'll be there to promote it.
[01:07:32.492 --> 01:07:34.932]  It's already published in what, 24 countries?
[01:07:34.932 --> 01:07:36.813]  It's published in 42 countries.
[01:07:36.813 --> 01:07:39.353]  It's published in 42 countries in 24 languages.
[01:07:39.353 --> 01:07:42.534]  It has sold a million and a half copies worldwide.
[01:07:43.183 --> 01:07:49.844]  So, a lot of people needless to say, it's not nearly as popular as American Idol, but we have enough people and we don't need a lot.
[01:07:49.844 --> 01:07:51.665]  We just need 3% of the American population.
[01:07:51.665 --> 01:07:53.505]  Well, that was my next question for you.
[01:07:53.505 --> 01:07:55.546]  3% won the Revolutionary War.
[01:07:55.546 --> 01:07:58.326]  I want to get the bottom line from you.
[01:07:58.326 --> 01:08:03.447]  The globalist strategy to try to bring down the U.S., the last piece in their puzzle.
[01:08:03.447 --> 01:08:11.609]  You talked about it last year, how important it is for them to get this amnesty to finally bring in the New World Order with the North American Union.
[01:08:12.239 --> 01:08:21.747]  And what you see the key things are we need to do as people of the world against our enemies, only a couple hundred of them, and what they're going to try.
[01:08:21.747 --> 01:08:24.949]  Well, one of the key things we need to understand is how money works.
[01:08:24.949 --> 01:08:35.858]  That's one of the things that one of the bankers who actually is a member of the Bill of Rights Club and an intimate friend of mine, he told me, if you want to do something about these people, you cannot stand up shoulder to shoulder with others, pick up a gun or an arm,
[01:08:36.306 --> 01:08:37.567]  And try to fight them.
[01:08:37.567 --> 01:08:39.168]  You can't physically win the battle.
[01:08:39.168 --> 01:08:41.770]  What you need to do is to understand how money works.
[01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:46.393]  And once you understand how money works for you, you can actually do something against these people.
[01:08:46.393 --> 01:08:53.599]  Because what we're doing by putting money into major financial institutions, we're feeding the monster who sooner or later will destroy us.
[01:08:53.599 --> 01:09:00.203]  So what we need to do, as he told me, is to take the money out of the bank and take the power of the money away from these people.
[01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:00.944]  That'll be the first step.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:07.785]  And that is actually the anathema to what most people believe, because everybody thinks that the bank is the safest place to keep one's money.
[01:09:07.785 --> 01:09:11.108]  Take the money out of the bank, convert it to gold, convert it to silver.
[01:09:11.108 --> 01:09:15.431]  Don't give these people the power to destroy us.
[01:09:15.431 --> 01:09:16.132]  Absolutely.
[01:09:16.132 --> 01:09:18.834]  I mean, why leave it there where they have control of it?
[01:09:18.834 --> 01:09:20.015]  I mean, obviously, hedge.
[01:09:20.015 --> 01:09:21.136]  Be diversified, folks.
[01:09:21.136 --> 01:09:22.917]  Most of us aren't diversified.
[01:09:22.917 --> 01:09:26.520]  I'm so busy, I have no chance to diversify my meager nest egg.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.503]  Daniel, last year you spoke about the North American Union and the key to that.
[01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:35.032]  Being the open borders, how important is that today?
[01:09:35.032 --> 01:09:36.113]  I think it's more important than ever.
[01:09:36.113 --> 01:09:38.734]  I think you're seeing what... Europe is a guinea pig.
[01:09:38.734 --> 01:09:39.614]  Europe is an experiment.
[01:09:39.614 --> 01:09:41.435]  You can see what is going on in Europe.
[01:09:41.435 --> 01:09:45.538]  They're actually using the same blueprint and they're putting it into practice in the United States.
[01:09:45.538 --> 01:09:47.659]  The American Union is... it's just a matter of time.
[01:09:47.659 --> 01:09:48.939]  It's a question of time.
[01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:51.901]  And I think unless people realize what is going on, this thing is...
[01:09:53.787 --> 01:10:07.031]  The North American Free Trade Agreement, which was actually put into practice in the early 1990s, talked in clear details about how this whole thing was going towards North American Union, and you could see 10 years or 15 years later how we're almost there.
[01:10:07.031 --> 01:10:16.313]  But again, I think there's still time for us to wake up, and the General Awakening hopefully will have enough reason for the people who actually stand
[01:10:16.949 --> 01:10:18.891]  Together and prevent this thing from actually happening.
[01:10:18.891 --> 01:10:19.811]  Absolutely.
[01:10:19.811 --> 01:10:20.832]  Shame reactions.
[01:10:20.832 --> 01:10:24.015]  You know, last year I was with you in Canada in Ottawa, their capital.
[01:10:24.015 --> 01:10:24.836]  That's right.
[01:10:24.836 --> 01:10:33.262]  And there was, it was in dozens of papers, I don't know, probably 20 papers up there, hundreds of websites, foreign news, but nothing in the U.S.
[01:10:33.262 --> 01:10:34.023]  press.
[01:10:34.023 --> 01:10:34.383]  The U.S.
[01:10:34.383 --> 01:10:36.645]  press has always been the most locked down.
[01:10:36.645 --> 01:10:40.168]  Now it's all over Dallas Morning News, all over other major U.S.
[01:10:40.168 --> 01:10:42.910]  newspapers, just like Bilderberg and the Google Click News, folks.
[01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:44.191]  It's all over Texas TV.
[01:10:46.103 --> 01:10:52.169]  What exactly are they saying?
[01:10:52.169 --> 01:10:53.911]  What are they saying in the Dallas Morning News?
[01:10:53.911 --> 01:10:59.596]  The Dallas Morning News was talking about how the Governor Rick Perry went over there and how it's a super secret meeting and it's been on television.
[01:10:59.596 --> 01:11:01.618]  I'm going to play a TV clip here in a minute.
[01:11:01.618 --> 01:11:08.105]  And other reports are admitting that the world's elite are meeting in secret and it's in quite a few U.S.
[01:11:08.105 --> 01:11:09.246]  and British and other newspapers.
[01:11:09.671 --> 01:11:15.674]  All I'm saying is we're seeing more coverage right now in one year than we've seen in decades combined.
[01:11:15.674 --> 01:11:16.934]  So this is exponential.
[01:11:16.934 --> 01:11:19.875]  What's it going to be next year?
[01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:23.397]  I just hope we have enough time to put a stop to this.
[01:11:23.397 --> 01:11:26.198]  But is that encouraging to you to see this type of coverage?
[01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:27.459]  Well, it is.
[01:11:27.459 --> 01:11:32.841]  But again, I think the interlock mechanisms that these people actually need
[01:11:33.294 --> 01:11:34.074]  We're good to go!
[01:11:53.795 --> 01:12:01.960]  A few months back, when they were presenting, unveiling the new European energy policy, he talked about, it's time to bring the world into the post-industrial age.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.082]  Now, when I heard that phrase, Alex, I almost fell off my chair.
[01:12:06.082 --> 01:12:08.784]  That's what you talk about in Endgame.
[01:12:08.784 --> 01:12:10.505]  This is the new feudal state.
[01:12:10.505 --> 01:12:15.548]  This is where they see middle class as their enemy, whether you're Hispanic, black, white,
[01:12:16.449 --> 01:12:17.590]  They don't care, folks.
[01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:18.471]  Understand that.
[01:12:18.471 --> 01:12:19.852]  They want to destroy you.
[01:12:19.852 --> 01:12:20.893]  Do you understand that?
[01:12:20.893 --> 01:12:21.894]  That's exactly right.
[01:12:21.894 --> 01:12:22.595]  You just said it, Alex.
[01:12:22.595 --> 01:12:27.700]  The post-industrial age is a symmetrical twin to the pre-industrial age, where you and I worked the fields.
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.461]  We died, our children worked the fields.
[01:12:29.461 --> 01:12:31.103]  They died, their children worked the fields.
[01:12:31.474 --> 01:12:32.955]  For an oligarchical elite of 1%.
[01:12:32.955 --> 01:12:38.661]  Now, to bring the world to the post-industrial age, what you need to do is you need to destroy the world economy.
[01:12:38.661 --> 01:12:40.643]  Now, they're saying it as an excuse.
[01:12:40.643 --> 01:12:43.345]  That is global warming.
[01:12:43.345 --> 01:12:44.866]  That's what they're using as an excuse.
[01:12:44.866 --> 01:12:47.008]  Needless to say, we know that is not the reason.
[01:12:47.008 --> 01:12:51.272]  Now, to destroy the world economy, somebody will have to work in the post-industrial age.
[01:12:51.272 --> 01:12:54.615]  My question to you and to the audience is, who is it going to be?
[01:12:54.615 --> 01:12:56.017]  David Rockefeller or you and I?
[01:12:57.665 --> 01:13:00.367]  Well, bottom line, look at Mexico as a model.
[01:13:00.367 --> 01:13:02.308]  Richest country per capita in the world.
[01:13:02.308 --> 01:13:04.329]  Triple the resources of the U.S.
[01:13:04.329 --> 01:13:06.711]  They have the smallest and richest elite.
[01:13:06.711 --> 01:13:08.672]  Most billionaires in the world, folks.
[01:13:08.672 --> 01:13:14.756]  And it is a religion down there to have 50, and 100, and 200,000 acre ranches.
[01:13:14.756 --> 01:13:17.538]  Vicente Fox has a 40,000 when he's low level.
[01:13:17.538 --> 01:13:19.479]  And they literally, it's a religion.
[01:13:19.479 --> 01:13:21.040]  Just like the British had.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.362]  A religion of their slaves out there working.
[01:13:24.362 --> 01:13:25.303]  It's so sad.
[01:13:26.079 --> 01:13:34.326]  And now they're using those very people who I want to be free, instead of having a revolution in Mexico, they're using them to slit the throat of America, Daniel.
[01:13:34.326 --> 01:13:46.996]  Needless to say, Mexico as an even-handed trading partner of the United States is a great benefit to the United States and to Mexico, but it's much better to have Mexico as a slave working as a third world wages, and this way you could... Exactly.
[01:13:47.697 --> 01:13:53.900]  Exactly, instead of us working together to overthrow the government of Mexico that's corrupt, and to get our government back, here in the U.S.
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:56.021]  Again, I'm talking about that as a microcosm.
[01:13:56.021 --> 01:13:57.102]  Same thing's happening in Europe.
[01:13:57.102 --> 01:14:04.445]  You wrote about how they do use the Muslim extremists, how the Bilderberg Group is behind them, because, again, it's a destabilizer for the Middle East.
[01:14:04.445 --> 01:14:05.546]  Exactly.
[01:14:05.546 --> 01:14:09.648]  And then if we criticize the, quote, Muslim extremists, some Muslims think, oh, we're against them.
[01:14:09.648 --> 01:14:10.648]  You don't understand, folks.
[01:14:10.648 --> 01:14:13.850]  Those revolutionaries are controlled by the globalists.
[01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:15.550]  DanielLesteland.com.
[01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:16.851]  Spell that out for people, Daniel.
[01:14:17.458 --> 01:14:22.300]  Daniel, E-S-T-U-L-I-N dot com.
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:24.781]  And in closing, everybody should pray for your mother-in-law.
[01:14:24.781 --> 01:14:25.901]  I want to thank you for coming on.
[01:14:25.901 --> 01:14:32.244]  Do you think the globalists are mad right now that all this coverage is out there?
[01:14:32.244 --> 01:14:33.865]  I'm not sure, Alex.
[01:14:33.865 --> 01:14:39.347]  The fact that Barroso, the president of the European Commission a few months back, actually showed his hand.
[01:14:39.347 --> 01:14:42.388]  If you're in a poker game, you show your hand because no matter what the other one has,
[01:14:42.898 --> 01:14:46.020]  And they're going to do that with a new carbon tax, which means one child policy, no more meat.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:46.701]  I mean, hundreds of rules.
[01:14:46.701 --> 01:14:47.761]  It's all mainstream media now, folks.
[01:15:04.954 --> 01:15:07.596]  When you hear carbon tax, oh, let's ban the light bulbs.
[01:15:07.596 --> 01:15:17.424]  See, that sounds reasonable, but once they've set that precedent, folks, it's total feudalism, micromanagement of your life under new environmental laws.
[01:15:17.424 --> 01:15:19.726]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:15:19.726 --> 01:15:22.629]  Now, Daniel, where and when did Barroso say that?
[01:15:22.629 --> 01:15:24.170]  Because I'm going to get that.
[01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:25.551]  Well, he actually said it.
[01:15:25.551 --> 01:15:26.872]  I got it on the BBC.
[01:15:26.872 --> 01:15:31.416]  I don't have the date right now, but he said it a few months ago at the unveiling of the latest
[01:15:32.864 --> 01:15:34.525]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:15:34.525 --> 01:15:35.365]  Daniel, I have one final thing.
[01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:36.225]  Okay, well stay there.
[01:15:36.225 --> 01:15:38.306]  Stay there because we've got to come back to you.
[01:15:38.306 --> 01:15:40.326]  Just a quick break if you want to finish up.
[01:15:40.326 --> 01:15:41.647]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:58.203 --> 01:16:00.644]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[01:16:00.644 --> 01:16:04.086]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[01:16:04.086 --> 01:16:05.727]  For a while, anyway.
[01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:09.510]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:12.151]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX Ointment?
[01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:16.013]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:16:16.013 --> 01:16:18.815]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:16:18.815 --> 01:16:19.535]  What's the name again?
[01:16:19.535 --> 01:16:21.316]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:16:21.316 --> 01:16:22.477]  It's CalX.
[01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:24.058]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:16:24.987 --> 01:16:26.847]  What makes Cal-X ointment so different?
[01:16:26.847 --> 01:16:36.209]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:16:36.209 --> 01:16:40.990]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:50.791]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:51.952]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[01:16:51.952 --> 01:16:52.892]  I'll be right back.
[01:16:52.892 --> 01:16:53.812]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[01:16:56.929 --> 01:17:00.793]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:17:00.793 --> 01:17:02.214]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:17:02.214 --> 01:17:06.098]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:17:06.098 --> 01:17:09.001]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:17:09.001 --> 01:17:11.083]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:17:11.083 --> 01:17:13.225]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:17:14.426 --> 01:17:20.068]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:17:20.068 --> 01:17:22.569]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:17:30.091 --> 01:17:32.192]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:17:32.192 --> 01:17:34.754]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[01:17:34.754 --> 01:17:37.736]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:38.456]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[01:17:38.456 --> 01:17:41.178]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[01:17:41.178 --> 01:17:41.858]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[01:17:56.926 --> 01:18:06.234]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:18:06.234 --> 01:18:17.803]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:18:17.803 --> 01:18:22.627]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:18:22.847 --> 01:18:22.987]  I think?
[01:18:41.596 --> 01:18:42.057]  How much get a 2-pack?
[01:18:42.057 --> 01:18:42.197]  Only $99.
[01:18:42.197 --> 01:18:42.797]  Or a 4-pack?
[01:18:42.797 --> 01:18:43.038]  Only $188.
[01:18:43.038 --> 01:18:43.538]  Call New Millennium.
[01:18:43.538 --> 01:18:43.618]  888-803-4438.
[01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:44.119]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:45.881]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:18:56.497 --> 01:18:59.759]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.

[01:19:52.043 --> 01:19:54.165]  Mostholyfamilymonastery.com
[01:20:22.295 --> 01:20:24.796]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:24.796 --> 01:20:27.138]  Daniel, finish up your point, my friend.
[01:20:27.138 --> 01:20:28.999]  Just a couple of points before I go.
[01:20:28.999 --> 01:20:30.740]  Bilderberg is not a conspiracy.
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:32.701]  I think it's very, very important that people understand that.
[01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:38.145]  They exist, they meet, and then what they decide is executed on the world stage annually.
[01:20:38.145 --> 01:20:47.712]  And as most of the things that they actually decide is very, very short term, because there is no long term, I think we can actually see the things that I say, the things that Jim Tucker says, things that you do.
[01:20:47.712 --> 01:20:50.994]  People can, we don't need to go 800 years into the future.
[01:20:50.994 --> 01:20:59.100]  These are short, three, six, one-year decisions, one year into the future decisions, and we can actually see just how right we are about the things that we say.
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:00.921]  This is a world governing council.
[01:21:02.597 --> 01:21:03.097]  Exactly.
[01:21:03.097 --> 01:21:07.600]  This is the World Government Council, run by the European and the Americans, which is a NATO alliance.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.561]  Now, you said a few minutes ago, is there anything we can do?
[01:21:09.561 --> 01:21:10.281]  Do we have a chance?
[01:21:10.281 --> 01:21:13.823]  I think we do have a chance, but the thing is that these people are slightly ahead of us.
[01:21:13.823 --> 01:21:20.367]  They started about 500 years ago, shortly after the Treaty of Florence was signed, which established the idea of nation-states.
[01:21:20.367 --> 01:21:25.089]  So they've been at it for 500 years, and they know exactly what they want.
[01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:28.051]  Now, the thing about us, the people who are trying to organize the resistance,
[01:21:28.507 --> 01:21:35.030]  I guess what the deliberators are trying to do is that we're not as well organized and needless to say we don't have a purpose in mind.
[01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.370]  They do.
[01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:39.692]  Their idea is not so much a one world government as a one world company.
[01:21:39.692 --> 01:21:40.793]  That's their final objective.
[01:21:46.230 --> 01:21:47.291]  Go ahead.
[01:21:47.291 --> 01:21:48.432]  That's what George Ball said in 1968.
[01:21:48.432 --> 01:21:52.977]  Now, Ball was the sub-secretary of Economic Affairs with Johnson and Kennedy.
[01:21:52.977 --> 01:21:56.821]  He said, how do we create a world company which will give orders to governments?
[01:21:56.821 --> 01:22:03.387]  In other words, how do you create a Halliburton-type company which will supersede and empower every government on Earth?
[01:22:03.387 --> 01:22:04.128]  It's not up to God.
[01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:05.909]  It's up to us to do something about this.
[01:22:05.909 --> 01:22:10.554]  And I think we can, as long as we can stop watching American Idol, whatever else is out there,
[01:22:10.939 --> 01:22:16.280]  Which has a lot to do with dumbing down of society and very little to do with the idea of freedom.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:16.900]  Absolutely.
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:23.122]  Daniel Esselstyn, I want to get you back up in the next few weeks as soon as your family problems are concluded.
[01:22:23.122 --> 01:22:25.483]  God bless you, my friend, and thank you for your great work.
[01:22:25.483 --> 01:22:27.003]  Thanks so much for having me.
[01:22:27.003 --> 01:22:28.283]  What a great gentleman.
[01:22:28.283 --> 01:22:30.164]  I wanted to play this clip, but we don't have time now.
[01:22:30.164 --> 01:22:36.645]  You can go up to prisonplanet.com and watch the News 8 Austin piece about Rick Perry and the Bilderberg Group.
[01:22:36.645 --> 01:22:39.026]  I mean, this is on local Texas news.
[01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:45.772]  By the way, I'll admit, we called him up and said, uh, yesterday I said, you know, it's in the Dallas Morning News that he went to this.
[01:22:45.772 --> 01:22:48.213]  By the way, it's illegal, it's a violation of the Logan Act.
[01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:51.634]  We have articles on prisonplanet.com about the Logan Act being violated.
[01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:53.695]  That needs to be gotten out to people.
[01:22:53.695 --> 01:22:54.735]  He could get in trouble for this.
[01:22:54.735 --> 01:22:58.796]  Hillary got fined $300,000 a few years ago for this stuff.
[01:22:58.796 --> 01:23:00.757]  Okay, this is serious.
[01:23:00.757 --> 01:23:03.218]  We've got news about Giuliani being heckled and booed by 9-11 members.
[01:23:04.835 --> 01:23:06.476]  Fellow members, that is important.
[01:23:06.476 --> 01:23:09.597]  So he stops using their name, you know, to wrap them around himself.
[01:23:09.597 --> 01:23:11.758]  Help us get that out.
[01:23:11.758 --> 01:23:17.020]  We've got this huge article that Aaron Dyke stayed up until the middle of the night doing last night.
[01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:18.181]  It's unbelievable.
[01:23:18.181 --> 01:23:23.683]  Governor Perry summoned to Bilderberg while insider trading charges mount in related Texas buyout.
[01:23:23.683 --> 01:23:32.807]  We're talking about indictments, folks, with Bilderberg members involved in his handing over of the water systems, the biggest power plant grab ever, the roads, everything.
[01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.368]  I mean, folks, this is happening.
[01:23:35.433 --> 01:23:36.973]  I mean, this is going on right now.
[01:23:36.973 --> 01:23:38.694]  This is huge stuff.
[01:23:38.694 --> 01:23:39.914]  I just want to hurt them.
[01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:41.254]  I want to expose them.
[01:23:41.254 --> 01:23:46.016]  I want to get my fellow Americans, people of the world, my fellow Texans, to see what's happening.
[01:23:46.016 --> 01:23:47.316]  That is all I want.
[01:23:47.316 --> 01:23:51.297]  Please help us at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:23:51.297 --> 01:23:55.198]  And I know my team works really hard, but we need to... I mean, look at the breaking news.
[01:23:55.808 --> 01:23:57.569]  With what Tucker said last hour.
[01:23:57.569 --> 01:23:58.830]  That's the stuff that's going to happen.
[01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:00.131]  We need articles on that.
[01:24:00.131 --> 01:24:00.872]  Help us listeners.
[01:24:00.872 --> 01:24:02.773]  Write up your own articles about what we said.
[01:24:02.773 --> 01:24:04.774]  Send them to Aaron and InfoWars.com.
[01:24:04.774 --> 01:24:07.476]  JonesReport.com right now has the most reporting.
[01:24:07.476 --> 01:24:09.898]  It's all up there right now on the site.
[01:24:09.898 --> 01:24:11.359]  Just help us get this out.
[01:24:11.359 --> 01:24:13.381]  All I want to do is expose these people.
[01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:15.042]  All I want to do is stop these people.
[01:24:15.993 --> 01:24:18.435]  That is what we're doing here, and they're evil.
[01:24:18.435 --> 01:24:19.215]  They're bad.
[01:24:19.215 --> 01:24:20.256]  We're exposing them.
[01:24:20.256 --> 01:24:21.577]  It's starting to come out in the news.
[01:24:21.577 --> 01:24:23.518]  We need to arrest all these people.
[01:24:23.518 --> 01:24:26.320]  These are evil, evil, evil people.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.461]  They're destroying my country.
[01:24:27.461 --> 01:24:28.381]  They're destroying my state.
[01:24:28.381 --> 01:24:31.363]  They're destroying your nations, no matter where you live.
[01:24:31.363 --> 01:24:33.124]  And they're playing us off against each other.
[01:24:33.124 --> 01:24:35.526]  We have got to defeat them with God's help.
[01:24:35.526 --> 01:24:39.548]  We have to at least put up a fight against them or they're going to run all over us.
[01:24:39.548 --> 01:24:40.209]  So please,
[01:24:41.232 --> 01:24:42.334]  Go get the video clips.
[01:24:42.334 --> 01:24:43.075]  Get the materials.
[01:24:43.075 --> 01:24:43.896]  Get the information.

[01:24:45.799 --> 01:24:49.525]  And yes, in closing, because Ron Paul's coming up, it is live.
[01:24:49.525 --> 01:24:50.827]  We are Friday.
[01:24:50.827 --> 01:24:52.270]  It is June 1st, 2007.
[01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:54.874]  We're a year halfway through already.
[01:24:55.416 --> 01:24:58.638]  Please go to PrismPlanet.com and buy some of the books and videos.
[01:24:58.638 --> 01:24:59.759]  That's how I pay for things.
[01:24:59.759 --> 01:25:01.320]  That's how I'm able to hire more people.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:06.944]  That's how we're able to go on trips and go places and get you this information and bring it to you.
[01:25:06.944 --> 01:25:12.708]  So please get PrismPlanet.tv memberships or if you've let yours expire, get another membership or give it as a gift.
[01:25:12.708 --> 01:25:14.549]  I want to thank those that have supported us.

[01:25:21.454 --> 01:25:22.255]  InfoWars.com.
[01:25:23.234 --> 01:25:30.060]  Get in there, and to everybody, the whole team, John Harmon up there at the network, that guy's got the best attitude, can do, takes action.
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:31.341]  Good job, John.
[01:25:31.341 --> 01:25:35.124]  And I just love working with all of you and being in this historical fight.
[01:25:35.124 --> 01:25:37.206]  We got good on our side, they're the bad guys.
[01:25:37.206 --> 01:25:40.949]  If we expose them, with God's help, we cannot lose.
[01:25:40.949 --> 01:25:44.252]  Get to PrisonPlanet.com, get the articles, get them out there!
[01:25:44.252 --> 01:25:46.814]  Unleash your power!
[01:25:46.814 --> 01:25:49.716]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
