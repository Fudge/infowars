[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:31.800]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome this is the Alex Jones show Friday April 3rd 2009 the
[00:31.800 --> 00:39.520]  day after a new world order has been announced by Gordon Brown and his cronies his criminal
[00:39.520 --> 00:45.600]  cronies at the G20 I'm Jason Burma sitting in for Alex Jones Alex will actually be up in about
[00:45.600 --> 00:50.760]  15 minutes to discuss Gordon Brown and then also discuss of the story we have it out in
[00:50.760 --> 00:56.560]  fours dot com we discussed a little bit last night on my show but basically at Patrice O'Neill on
[00:56.560 --> 01:01.320]  and I was talking about the new world order and he's like well I don't even really know if I
[01:01.320 --> 01:06.320]  want to describe it like that I'm like look that's their term for it so I go past the break room
[01:06.320 --> 01:11.880]  and out of the corner of my ear I hear Anderson Cooper say yeah they actually declared a new
[01:11.880 --> 01:15.800]  world order today and I'm like I run and I'm seeing if we're recording and of course we're not so
[01:15.800 --> 01:20.160]  I thrown to you do you start recording and he's like that really worried a lot of people in the
[01:20.160 --> 01:26.360]  United States look we're not telling you that they plan on making go global government a global
[01:26.360 --> 01:33.240]  carbon tax because it's not real it is real in fact if you read this raw data G20 communicate
[01:33.240 --> 01:40.480]  sheet I mean they're openly talking about the IMF global banking system they're gonna cut out
[01:40.480 --> 01:45.760]  any countries that threaten this banking system there's no more quote-unquote protectionism in
[01:45.760 --> 01:51.880]  other words and by the way they want no trade laws no trade no new export laws this is going to
[01:51.880 --> 01:56.760]  kill our economy even further it's designed to tear down the dollar in every way shape and form
[01:56.760 --> 02:03.800]  and bring in this new global currency and at the end of it they sneak in what we've been saying all
[02:03.800 --> 02:09.840]  along listen to this there's a number out 28 there's 29 points we reaffirm our commitment to
[02:09.840 --> 02:16.840]  address the threat of irreversible climate change did you just hear that irreversible climate
[02:16.840 --> 02:23.080]  change they're saying there's no way to come back from it so we are all going to be paying a carbon
[02:23.080 --> 02:28.000]  tax based on the principle of common but different responsibilities see common but different
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.560]  responsibilities there'll be different flavors of it but I guarantee you this it'll be the new
[02:32.560 --> 02:39.680]  currency system and we are going to be taxed to breathe it is it is revolting after they
[02:39.680 --> 02:43.640]  bring in their little global currency after they smash out the dollar I mean Gordon Brown
[02:43.640 --> 02:49.320]  announced the emerging new world order in front of everybody again last night I can't tell you
[02:49.320 --> 02:55.760]  how many pieces just in the last few hours last night this one came out of Bloomberg G20 shapes
[02:55.760 --> 03:03.200]  new world order with lesser role for us and its markets that's their headline openly stating what
[03:03.200 --> 03:08.960]  I'm telling you right now and have been telling you for weeks that this G20 was a coming out
[03:08.960 --> 03:14.480]  party for their global banking system their global currency and their global governance that
[03:14.480 --> 03:23.080]  they've had a hard on for for the last 100 plus years 200 years this is it I mean it is unreal

[08:06.240 --> 08:33.600]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network all right we are back
[08:33.600 --> 08:40.040]  it's the Alex Jones show I want to play this clip of Gordon Brown talking about the emerging
[08:40.040 --> 08:48.520]  new world order on the stage of the G20 we got that all right this happened in 1929 it took
[08:48.520 --> 08:55.800]  15 years for the world to come together to rebuild and renew our economies this time I think people
[08:55.800 --> 09:01.800]  will agree that it is different we will not hesitate as long as people are losing their jobs
[09:01.800 --> 09:09.320]  and their homes to make the difference that we can by improving their prosperity sales today's
[09:09.320 --> 09:15.400]  decisions of course will not immediately solve the crisis but we have begun the process by
[09:15.400 --> 09:22.600]  which it will be solved a few years ago meetings such as this could not have happened with so many
[09:22.600 --> 09:29.040]  different countries from diverse continents involved far less could there have been an
[09:29.040 --> 09:35.640]  agreement amongst them but today the largest countries of the world have agreed a global
[09:35.640 --> 09:42.640]  plan for recovery and reform this involves the biggest interest rate cuts in history the biggest
[09:42.640 --> 09:48.040]  fiscal stimulus we have ever seen the biggest increase in resources in the history of our
[09:48.040 --> 09:55.880]  international institutions with 250 billions more money than ever before for trade finance as well
[09:55.880 --> 10:01.840]  for the first time we have a common approach around the world to cleaning up banks balance sheets
[10:01.840 --> 10:08.960]  and restoring lending we are engaging in a deep process of reform and restructuring of our
[10:08.960 --> 10:14.840]  international financial system for now and for the future and we have maintained our commitment
[10:14.840 --> 10:21.480]  to help the world's poorest and we have put more money aside for that and also for a green
[10:21.480 --> 10:29.520]  recovery these are not just a single collection of actions this is collective action people working
[10:29.520 --> 10:35.680]  together at their best I think a new world order is emerging and with it the foundations of a new
[10:35.680 --> 10:42.000]  and progressive era of international cooperation we have resolved that from today we will together
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.960]  manage the process of globalization to secure responsibility from all and fairness to all and
[10:48.960 --> 10:56.200]  we've agreed that in doing so we will build a more sustainable and more open and a fairer global
[10:56.200 --> 11:02.640]  society all right there's Gordon Brown you know he's been preaching this global new deal and now
[11:02.640 --> 11:08.240]  we have this g20 communication let me just read some of the quotes in here everything I'm reading
[11:08.240 --> 11:14.360]  is out of the document just like we told you a global crisis requires a global solution we told
[11:14.360 --> 11:19.080]  you this is what we were going they were going to do to bring in world government they talk about
[11:19.080 --> 11:24.920]  sustainable globalization and rising prosperity for all is in an open world economy based on
[11:24.920 --> 11:31.560]  market principles effective regulation and strong global institutions all right so it's all about
[11:31.560 --> 11:37.280]  creating these new global institutions for the entire world they're pledging to do whatever is
[11:37.280 --> 11:43.440]  necessary all right in other words that means a new global currency with a new world bank they
[11:43.440 --> 11:51.600]  actually discuss the formation of this new world bank entity and its oversight let's see fund and
[11:51.600 --> 11:56.360]  reform our international finance institutions to overcome this crisis and prevent future ones
[11:56.360 --> 12:01.840]  see fund and reform our international finance institutions it's all about internationalism
[12:01.840 --> 12:09.600]  let's see promote global trade and investment and reject protectionism so in other words they
[12:09.600 --> 12:14.640]  don't plan on us having anything in this country anymore the auto industry that's why that's
[12:14.640 --> 12:18.200]  about to fail all together and they're not going to bail that out the last thing we make in this
[12:18.200 --> 12:24.320]  country is gone because they don't want us to be self-sufficient and they want us to be
[12:24.320 --> 12:29.800]  interdependent on one another so they can control us I mean it's disgusting here's one of the most
[12:29.800 --> 12:38.520]  disgusting is build an inclusive green and sustainable recovery that's all nonsense again
[12:38.520 --> 12:44.920]  they want to make you feel guilty for having two cars for you know having children I mean
[12:44.920 --> 12:51.000]  it fossil fuels are the demons I know remember climate change according to this document is
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.320]  completely irreversible let's see taking together these actions will constitute the largest fiscal
[12:57.320 --> 13:02.160]  and monetary stimulus and the most comprehensive support program for the financial sector in
[13:02.160 --> 13:09.800]  modern times so this is the biggest repackaging ever ever they further agreed to over a trillion
[13:09.800 --> 13:15.600]  of additional resources for the world economy through the IMF and other international finance
[13:15.600 --> 13:22.120]  institutions I mean give me a break I mean this is exactly what we were telling you exactly
[13:22.120 --> 13:27.360]  what we were saying meanwhile Bernanke and Geithner were up there lying oh we're not
[13:27.360 --> 13:32.520]  gonna do a global currency and your boy Obama was up there lying and I threw him softball
[13:32.520 --> 13:38.960]  questions at the summit makes me sick we will conduct all our economic policies cooperatively
[13:38.960 --> 13:43.840]  and responsibly and we're in with regard to the impact of other countries and we're
[13:43.840 --> 13:49.600]  afraid from competitive devout devaluation of our currencies and promote a stable well-functioning
[13:49.600 --> 13:57.040]  international monetary system so here it is again we can't devalue any kind of currency
[13:57.040 --> 14:00.840]  all right we're gonna play this Anderson Cooper clip talking about the new world order right
[14:00.840 --> 14:05.480]  now and then we're gonna have Alex Jones on the line hit it jaren it's no matter what
[14:05.480 --> 14:09.080]  country they were in well I might be alone on this and Ed might not agree with me but
[14:09.080 --> 14:14.960]  I think buried somewhere in here is the beginnings of a global regulation we may not well we
[14:14.960 --> 14:19.880]  may not see it this year we may not see it next year but they have opened up the idea
[14:19.880 --> 14:24.960]  of there being some form of other regulator across countries and I think that's gonna
[14:24.960 --> 14:28.240]  come so is this some sort of a new world order which was Gordon Brown kind of alluded
[14:28.240 --> 14:33.120]  to that's where President Obama was drawing the line and said that concerns a lot of
[14:33.120 --> 14:36.880]  people you can't all of a sudden have a super regulator even if you were in a desperate
[14:36.880 --> 14:41.400]  crisis now you cut the clip or in the US seeing this guy's over here to deny it but it totally
[14:41.400 --> 14:45.680]  talks about all these new international bodies it says that it's it's going to promote the
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.280]  fact that there will be no new trade regulations whatsoever and you're not gonna be able to
[14:50.280 --> 14:56.680]  go after someone else's economy if it's detrimental to say Mexico or it's detrimental to Canada
[14:56.680 --> 15:01.440]  you're not gonna be able to do it it's going to be regulated I mean it's absolutely a hundred
[15:01.440 --> 15:07.800]  and ten percent global government it's announced I mean it again Bloomberg G 20 shapes the new
[15:07.800 --> 15:13.080]  world order with a lesser role for the US and markets this was a couple days ago analysis
[15:13.080 --> 15:16.400]  crisis may lead to new world order do you think there's some predictive programming
[15:16.400 --> 15:22.840]  in here New York Times a world in need of a new order I think there's another article
[15:22.840 --> 15:26.960]  out there six steps to a new world order here it is G 20 makes six pledges toward a new
[15:26.960 --> 15:34.120]  world order all this stuff I mean it's unbelievable folks they're gonna establish a new financial
[15:34.120 --> 15:40.040]  stability board again bringing in more bureaucracies more control with a strengthened mandate as
[15:40.040 --> 15:46.600]  a success as a successor to the fsf which is the financial stability forum which will include
[15:46.600 --> 15:52.480]  all G 20 countries fsf members spain and the european commission do we have alex on the
[15:52.480 --> 15:58.760]  line at john is he called in yet as soon as he gets on the line we're gonna bring him
[15:58.760 --> 16:05.440]  up let's see fsb will collaborate with the imf we're going to extend regulation and oversight
[16:05.440 --> 16:09.600]  to all systematically important financial institutions instruments and markets do you
[16:09.600 --> 16:16.960]  know what that means every bank every financial institution and every market in other words
[16:16.960 --> 16:21.680]  any kind of trade whatsoever is going to be globally regulated by a new system do you
[16:21.680 --> 16:28.720]  understand their stories all over info wars going up about how revolting this this is
[16:28.720 --> 16:35.200]  I mean they're all pledging to it towards it again sarcosi gives his little fake I don't
[16:35.200 --> 16:40.200]  want to play here anymore it's not going to be enough reform I'm walking out he was never
[16:40.200 --> 16:44.840]  walking and then he's smiling with everybody it's like big smiles and hugs and I've got
[16:44.840 --> 16:51.040]  to see disgusting headlines like we saved the world today no you didn't you took yet another
[16:51.040 --> 17:01.640]  monumental step in enslaving humanity in reigning tyranny upon men that's what you did
[17:01.640 --> 17:05.680]  you know again we had patrice on last night on the info warrior i do it on nine to twelve
[17:05.680 --> 17:12.720]  central time and uh... he was a script writer for a time for wwe back in two thousand smack
[17:12.720 --> 17:20.240]  down the wrong and it is no different his job writing for characters that seemingly
[17:20.240 --> 17:26.000]  are arguing than what these world stage players i mean yesterday obama talked about how the
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.280]  world is a stage and america is the biggest actor in it
[17:30.280 --> 17:35.620]  i don't think we should be using that type of terminology if we're trying to be genuine
[17:35.620 --> 17:39.060]  if we're truly trying to bring about change
[17:39.060 --> 17:42.400]  that is positive for the american people
[17:42.400 --> 17:46.120]  but the only change this guy's bringing in
[17:46.120 --> 17:48.960]  disease changing the system even further
[17:48.960 --> 17:52.640]  he's having a progress from administration to administration member it goes beyond the
[17:52.640 --> 17:55.880]  bush administration that regime
[17:55.880 --> 17:57.800]  beyond the obama administration
[17:57.800 --> 18:01.320]  and justice incremental march
[18:01.320 --> 18:05.880]  towards total and complete world government tyranny
[18:05.880 --> 18:08.200]  the full monty if you will
[18:08.200 --> 18:09.520]  i mean it is
[18:09.520 --> 18:12.580]  is only let's read some more the bill
[18:12.580 --> 18:15.680]  let's see uh... we stand ready to play sanctions
[18:15.680 --> 18:16.680]  to protect
[18:16.680 --> 18:21.400]  our public finances and financial systems see they can employ ship sanctions on other
[18:21.400 --> 18:23.680]  nations on people that don't play ball
[18:23.680 --> 18:28.320]  but as soon as some other nation tries to go uh... sanctions on them or theirs
[18:28.320 --> 18:29.720]  they're out of the picture
[18:29.720 --> 18:31.240]  though they'll use nato on

[24:18.320 --> 24:25.520]  mugged if you go downtown you see folks so many times what these people will do
[24:25.520 --> 24:30.400]  I'll live back in the woods they'll have other forums they'll put together other
[24:30.400 --> 24:36.800]  legislation other think tank papers and will agree to these things and they
[24:36.800 --> 24:39.880]  won't necessarily implement them right away but then they'll be referred to
[24:39.880 --> 24:46.880]  later on in a document like this one for instance in this G20 communique they're
[24:46.880 --> 24:51.840]  all committing to implementing the World Bank reforms agreed to in October of
[24:51.840 --> 24:55.760]  2008 this is how they put everything in motion beforehand this is all a stage
[24:55.760 --> 24:59.920]  show they knew what they were going to do this isn't a conference okay this is a
[24:59.920 --> 25:05.760]  photo op and basically them stepping up and telling you what they've been
[25:05.760 --> 25:10.520]  working on they act like all we just we just had to do this has been years
[25:10.520 --> 25:15.760]  decades in the making all right so another thing that they they pull in this
[25:15.760 --> 25:22.920]  is they also reaffirm our historic commitments to meeting the millennium
[25:22.920 --> 25:27.360]  development goals and to achieve our respective ODA pledges including
[25:27.360 --> 25:33.840]  commitments on the air for trade debt relief and the Glenegals commitments
[25:33.840 --> 25:41.320]  especially to sub-saharan Africa all right so then they throw in all these
[25:41.320 --> 25:44.200]  other things that you know people generally don't know anything about
[25:44.200 --> 25:48.640]  again this is the carbon tax this is the sanctions on other countries this is
[25:48.640 --> 25:54.000]  this is empowering the World Bank this is it this is it this is really one of
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.360]  their underlying doctrines I mean when you watch the Anderson Cooper thing the
[25:59.360 --> 26:03.880]  guys like well I I see something of a structure for global governance hidden
[26:03.880 --> 26:07.160]  amongst here we mean hidden it's all right here in the open they're they're
[26:07.160 --> 26:13.320]  just saying that if you if you don't go along with it too bad we're going to
[26:13.320 --> 26:17.960]  deploy people against you we're like we're gonna hold sanctions uncooperative
[26:17.960 --> 26:21.200]  and unrestricted areas let's see they're going to take action against non
[26:21.200 --> 26:26.160]  cooperative jurisdictions they stand ready to deploy sanctions to protect our
[26:26.160 --> 26:31.640]  public finances and financial systems we note that the OECD has today published
[26:31.640 --> 26:36.520]  a list of countries assessed by the global forum against the international
[26:36.520 --> 26:41.960]  standard for exchange of tax information so these are going to be like right in
[26:41.960 --> 26:47.760]  the scope of this new world government and you know what they're probably going
[26:47.760 --> 26:51.520]  to put somebody pretty likable at the head of this thing at least someone who's
[26:51.520 --> 26:58.560]  uh you know somewhat well-spoken somewhat prominent has that air about him
[26:58.560 --> 27:03.760]  kind of like an Obama I mean Barack Obama yesterday while he was taking
[27:03.760 --> 27:08.320]  questions and giving a speech I mean he what he didn't sweat at all he's
[27:08.320 --> 27:12.680]  reading off a script even when they ask him a question I mean he just he just
[27:12.680 --> 27:19.600]  says what he wants case in point he gives that speech last week and then he
[27:19.600 --> 27:23.920]  starts taking questions from the press and one of the one of the guys actually
[27:23.920 --> 27:27.240]  asked him about China's comments of dropping the dollar and bringing in a
[27:27.240 --> 27:32.280]  world currency now prior to that you know two weeks ahead of time we're
[27:32.280 --> 27:40.760]  reporting on this show and my show that the IMF is going to have quantitative
[27:40.760 --> 27:45.040]  easing that's their little term for it their little you know semantic word
[27:45.040 --> 27:51.600]  game quantitative easing by printing a global super currency and not talking
[27:51.600 --> 27:55.480]  about it and then you're reading the article it's Alistair Darling and
[27:55.480 --> 28:00.080]  members of the US Treasury Department but when Geithner the head of the US
[28:00.080 --> 28:05.680]  Treasury Department gets asked about oh no no no but then in front of the CFR
[28:05.680 --> 28:13.120]  he says he's open to it you know and I mean even Hannity picked that up Sean
[28:13.120 --> 28:18.440]  Hannity picked that up so it's time to you know drop the facade stop acting like
[28:18.440 --> 28:23.000]  you know the Federal Reserve is some kind of quasi government agency it's not
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.560]  that's that's what Hannity will tell you and start owning up to the fact these
[28:27.560 --> 28:30.760]  guys are colluding and have been for years they're working together I mean we
[28:30.760 --> 28:36.240]  had the chairman of the Bilderberg group in the 90s come out and say oh yeah by
[28:36.240 --> 28:40.480]  the way we were the ones behind the euro and you know the euro is going to
[28:40.480 --> 28:46.240]  last through this because it promotes a global currency it promotes globalism it
[28:46.240 --> 28:54.560]  promotes their quote unquote new world order that's not me telling you it you
[28:54.560 --> 28:57.680]  know we're gonna pull some new world order clips because I I really need to
[28:57.680 --> 29:02.160]  emphasize that this is just everywhere I want to pull up the article for prison

[29:21.200 --> 29:26.360]  spitting what Kissinger was talking about in the 70s who was just spitting
[29:26.360 --> 29:30.800]  what you know dictators like Hitler had been talking about for a long time and
[29:30.800 --> 29:34.200]  authors like H.G. Wells had been writing about in books called the new world

[33:30.160 --> 33:34.160]  America civics building it's breaking right now we're gonna cover that in
[33:34.160 --> 33:37.000]  this long segment if we can bring something up on it I should really put
[33:37.000 --> 33:44.200]  my mother I didn't do that so I can read it I was really just gonna go into the
[33:44.200 --> 33:47.320]  new world order thing but if there's a massive shooting I mean that really does
[33:47.320 --> 33:50.840]  just play into the fact they want first of all ammo folks have been a lot of
[33:50.840 --> 33:55.160]  calls in my show is it is on a very short short supply out of Colorado it's
[33:55.160 --> 33:58.440]  mainstream news that they're selling 200 to 300 percent of what they were
[33:58.440 --> 34:03.280]  selling just a year ago so it seems like the only people that are making
[34:03.280 --> 34:07.360]  money small businesses in this economy that are that are doing well are the
[34:07.360 --> 34:14.680]  gun owners you know the guys that have the shops so you know I know they want to
[34:14.680 --> 34:19.920]  take our guns I don't have any details on this yet obviously it hits a close to
[34:19.920 --> 34:26.400]  home we got Paul Hartman and jaren bring it up right now you know before we do
[34:26.400 --> 34:31.400]  that I just want to make the point is it any wonder that they used Gordon Brown
[34:31.400 --> 34:35.600]  to throw out the terminal terminology new world order first of all they know
[34:35.600 --> 34:40.360]  that it's not gonna run on any major news networks in this country all right
[34:40.360 --> 34:44.520]  in other words not gonna run on your nightly news on NBC or CBS or Fox
[34:44.520 --> 34:48.560]  it'll probably be on the 24-hour networks just like you saw CNN CNN
[34:48.560 --> 34:53.040]  headline news that's a that sort of thing but it won't be played live they
[34:53.040 --> 34:56.720]  know that's already more accepted in Europe that it's already been on the
[34:56.720 --> 35:03.840]  covers of magazines and newspapers all the time let's see I'm getting this right
[35:03.840 --> 35:09.120]  now but so I'm going to play Gordon Brown before he was the British Prime
[35:09.120 --> 35:14.600]  Minister and using the term new world order so many times yeah I mean this
[35:14.600 --> 35:18.240]  guy's a part of the world's sustainable society and notice sustainable is a lot
[35:18.240 --> 35:21.720]  of the language you'll see on the G20 sustainability to these people means
[35:21.720 --> 35:26.080]  killing a bunch of us don't you understand that I mean you have members
[35:26.080 --> 35:30.720]  of the Obama administration under Clinton saying there's already too many
[35:30.720 --> 35:36.200]  people in the world this is insane you have the guy under Gordon Brown saying
[35:36.200 --> 35:41.240]  that the UK population has to be taken down to 30 million it's at 70 million
[35:41.240 --> 35:44.920]  folks how are they gonna do that in the next 20 years unless they kill a bunch
[35:44.920 --> 35:48.400]  of us so I'm gonna read over this and see what happened in New York City we're
[35:48.400 --> 35:52.760]  gonna come back with that but right now Gordon Brown talking about a new world
[35:52.760 --> 35:59.760]  order all these new challenges are bringing together about the biggest
[35:59.760 --> 36:03.880]  restructuring we have ever seen not just of the global economy but of the
[36:03.880 --> 36:09.040]  global order as a whole and 200 years ago a famous British Foreign Secretary
[36:09.040 --> 36:13.800]  said that the new world had been called into existence to redress the balance
[36:13.800 --> 36:20.280]  of the old in 1990 another old world ended dominated by the Cold War and
[36:20.280 --> 36:26.000]  people taught then in 1990 of a new world order what they actually meant then
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.880]  was a new political order and what was not foreseen then but is obvious now
[36:30.880 --> 36:35.160]  from everything that we see and do what we experience in every day of our life
[36:35.160 --> 36:40.520]  is the sheer scale and speed and scope of globalization and it's only now that
[36:40.520 --> 36:45.360]  we can begin to understand that the world order that globalization brings and
[36:45.360 --> 36:49.400]  what it's going to look like it's driven forward now not just by the balance of
[36:49.400 --> 36:54.200]  military strength the Cold War times or ordinary political power it's being
[36:54.200 --> 36:59.640]  driven forward by a seismic shift in economic power that we see around us but
[36:59.640 --> 37:04.080]  what does the new world order mean for countries like ours who are looking to
[37:04.080 --> 37:08.640]  succeed I suggest that the countries that are going to succeed are those that
[37:08.640 --> 37:14.160]  combine flexibility free trade open markets with proper stewardship of the
[37:14.160 --> 37:20.440]  environment and investment in education infrastructure and innovation and the
[37:20.440 --> 37:24.440]  question for us is how we meet and master all these challenges to ensure
[37:24.440 --> 37:30.120]  that Britain enhances its competitiveness in the process and realize realizes
[37:30.120 --> 37:35.400]  what I believe is our destiny of success in this new world order so in
[37:35.400 --> 37:41.600]  conclusion ladies and gentlemen a new world is emerging it is a new world
[37:41.600 --> 37:47.800]  order with significantly different and radically new challenges for the future
[37:47.800 --> 37:52.600]  well there you have it I mean again not a shock that they used Gordon Brown to use
[37:52.600 --> 37:56.520]  that terminology right after the G20 not a shock that we're seeing headlines
[37:56.520 --> 38:00.320]  across the world and in the United States like a world in need of a new world
[38:00.320 --> 38:08.160]  order analysis crisis may lead to a new world order G20 makes six pledges towards
[38:08.160 --> 38:13.280]  a new world order and of course my favorite and that's sarcasm folks because
[38:13.280 --> 38:16.800]  it I mean it really does spell it out G20 shapes new world order with lesser
[38:16.800 --> 38:23.480]  role for us markets all right so we said New York City it's not New York City
[38:23.480 --> 38:27.040]  it's actually a lot closer to my hometown where I live in New York in
[38:27.040 --> 38:31.200]  Oniana it's about 50 miles away I haven't been to Binghamton a while but
[38:31.200 --> 38:35.600]  it's right on that border of Pennsylvania apparently it's an active shooting in
[38:35.600 --> 38:41.600]  Binghamton New York I just texted my my state trooper buddy see if he knows
[38:41.600 --> 38:45.120]  anything about it sometimes he gets the skinny on these things they haven't
[38:45.120 --> 38:49.080]  provided any number of victims or hostages however a local website is
[38:49.080 --> 38:54.160]  saying at least four people are dead and or shot and about 20 people have been
[38:54.160 --> 38:59.360]  taken hostage it's at the American Civic Association which apparently helps
[38:59.360 --> 39:03.880]  immigrants and refugees now I'm gonna guess right off the bat it's gonna be
[39:03.880 --> 39:08.720]  spun by some crazy you know it was some crazy guy who lost his job and is
[39:08.720 --> 39:12.640]  blaming the immigrants for everything and you know they're the problem so we
[39:12.640 --> 39:16.680]  have to kill all those people we shouldn't have guns you know upstate
[39:16.680 --> 39:20.520]  New York large hunting community I would imagine who knows what kind of
[39:20.520 --> 39:23.320]  weapon he had but I would imagine some kind of rifle maybe I'm wrong maybe a
[39:23.320 --> 39:28.320]  handgun could have a handgun very very possible but we're gonna report on that
[39:28.320 --> 39:36.000]  as the story breaks very interesting man that's that's crazy I wonder I really
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.520]  hope we're not gonna see more of this people breaking down or you know whether
[39:39.520 --> 39:43.280]  this is provocative or not we really don't have enough information so I want
[39:43.280 --> 39:51.320]  to get back into this new world order and how it's not just Gordon Brown and
[39:51.320 --> 39:57.000]  the leaders of the G20 that are talking about this how it is our world leaders
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.320]  and people that usually are seen in a positive light by you know the left or
[40:02.320 --> 40:06.120]  sometimes good-meaning people you know people like Bill Clinton we play that
[40:06.120 --> 40:13.000]  Bill Clinton mean 45 in the end of the war through 1989 in the end of the Cold
[40:13.000 --> 40:19.640]  War we had a world view Republican and Democratic presidents alike from Harry
[40:19.640 --> 40:27.120]  Truman to George Bush stood for freedom and stood for certain propositions that
[40:27.120 --> 40:30.680]  would make America strong and healthy and grow the middle class and shrink
[40:30.680 --> 40:38.960]  poverty and stand against communism and after 1989 president Bush kept said and
[40:38.960 --> 40:42.920]  it's a phrase that I often use myself that we needed a new world order and
[40:42.920 --> 40:46.920]  instead it looks like we got a lot of disorder we still win and after 9-11
[40:46.920 --> 40:52.400]  we've been more sensitive to the report I mean again he knows the terminology he
[40:52.400 --> 40:57.320]  used it when he was running against George Bush senior for the presidency I
[40:57.320 --> 41:01.560]  have the video clips are not on the internet I mean it's just unbelievable
[41:01.560 --> 41:07.320]  to me that people don't see that this supersedes conservative and Republican
[41:07.320 --> 41:12.160]  or a conservative and Democrat or liberal and Republican and I'm mixing them all
[41:12.160 --> 41:17.080]  up and right and left and elephant and donkey you know on the way in here I was
[41:17.080 --> 41:21.080]  listening to a little talk radio bubble of sponge head Joe Rogan I think it was
[41:21.080 --> 41:25.400]  a repeat but Rogan was really you know breaking it down in that team mentality
[41:25.400 --> 41:29.440]  and that's what we have we all want to I have that team mentality where we're
[41:29.440 --> 41:34.800]  rooting for someone now you know let's go let's go Dems let's go Obama listen
[41:34.800 --> 41:42.080]  I'll get behind somebody as soon as they're leading for the people and I am
[41:42.080 --> 41:46.400]  not seeing anybody in the mainstream media other than Lou Dobbs talk about the
[41:46.400 --> 41:52.600]  true issues Dobbs is I mean he's the only one that's been critical of this whole
[41:52.600 --> 41:57.040]  G20 he's the only one saying hey this looks really bad this looks like they're
[41:57.040 --> 42:01.360]  going to plunge the dollar and doom I mean Ron Paul saying it but Ron Paul's
[42:01.360 --> 42:12.040]  been saying it Ron Paul is the and to see someone as vicious as just horrific
[42:12.040 --> 42:19.960]  as Ann Coulter begin to support Ron Paul and say Ron Paul is the way in 2012 I'm
[42:19.960 --> 42:28.040]  just it's revolting that I mean that woman is the epitome of a provocateur
[42:28.040 --> 42:34.840]  the epitome of someone who's bought off the epitome of disingenuous you really
[42:34.840 --> 42:39.320]  think she believes what she says give me a break she says what she says to sell
[42:39.320 --> 42:43.960]  books to get on television you know Bill Maher you know who I'm not a huge fan
[42:43.960 --> 42:48.080]  of either at least we'll have someone like Moe's death on to take Christopher
[42:48.080 --> 42:52.480]  Hitchens on about the fall side Kate al-Qaeda deal and you know he'll talk
[42:52.480 --> 42:56.360]  about how he believes you know bin Laden is the boogeyman and he doesn't believe
[42:56.360 --> 43:01.440]  in the boogeyman and that was just a Hitchens delight they actually did a
[43:01.440 --> 43:05.920]  little overtime we can't play it because there's just so many curse words in it
[43:05.920 --> 43:10.560]  but he was just saying what is their stated goal what is the stated goal of
[43:10.560 --> 43:15.240]  al-Qaeda what is their political manifesto and he's like they hate our
[43:15.240 --> 43:20.200]  freedoms and they want to bring in a a fascist super state it's religious he's
[43:20.200 --> 43:23.600]  like well where is this written down well where can I see what their stated
[43:23.600 --> 43:27.560]  goals are so maybe we can meet some of these all you can't reason with them
[43:27.560 --> 43:32.960]  that's the whole point to prop up this unreasonable enemy that can't be
[43:32.960 --> 43:38.400]  negotiated with again on this world stage of actors so that you can go into
[43:38.400 --> 43:43.160]  the Middle East so that you can create your Eurasian Union you that branch of
[43:43.160 --> 43:47.120]  the New World Order I mean I don't know if they covered it on this program but
[43:47.120 --> 43:50.840]  Iran has now pledged to the Obama administration that they're going to
[43:50.840 --> 43:56.480]  help fight al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan apparently now they're best
[43:56.480 --> 44:02.840]  buddies isn't that odd how that works how Iran all of a sudden is no longer the
[44:02.840 --> 44:07.520]  enemy how Hillary Clinton can go around and say that they've dropped the war on
[44:07.520 --> 44:10.960]  terror rhetoric this administration doesn't talk about that but then we have
[44:10.960 --> 44:16.240]  to read stories about how this young the new Taliban and al-Qaeda leader I don't
[44:16.240 --> 44:21.200]  know if you saw this guy and he looks ridiculous now he's gonna get the White
[44:21.200 --> 44:26.640]  House and attack is imminent and here's the headline Obama admits attack on US
[44:26.640 --> 44:29.800]  soil likely now they're gonna get they're gonna get the White House and
[44:29.800 --> 44:35.120]  come on that war in Afghanistan should have been over three to six months in
[44:35.120 --> 44:39.760]  but it wasn't about getting al-Qaeda wasn't about getting bin Laden it was
[44:39.760 --> 44:44.600]  about building infrastructure about taking over the resources and again it's
[44:44.600 --> 44:49.120]  about globalization it's about world government all this stuff is you know
[44:49.120 --> 44:52.080]  I'm talking to Patrice again last night and he asked me that same question he
[44:52.080 --> 44:57.680]  asked Alex you know what are the three subject matter the three most important
[44:57.680 --> 45:02.080]  things people need to learn about this system well I said actually there's three
[45:02.080 --> 45:06.880]  things and they have three nexus points and I go if I was teaching New World Order
[45:06.880 --> 45:11.800]  101 these are the three things that I would teach and of course it would be
[45:11.800 --> 45:15.840]  the monetary system you know perpetual debt the Federal Reserve banking fraud
[45:15.840 --> 45:20.680]  comprehensive annual financial reports how they rip you off how they create
[45:20.680 --> 45:25.160]  money out of nothing and they control us with it that would be one two the
[45:25.160 --> 45:30.120]  eugenics programs how we've been dumbed down there's fluoride in the water you
[45:30.120 --> 45:33.760]  know it causes us to be more docile they're you know putting mercury in the
[45:33.760 --> 45:38.200]  vaccinations everybody knows that mercury is a deadly poison a heavy metal
[45:38.200 --> 45:42.480]  that should not be in our body talk about the sv-40 I played clips last night
[45:42.480 --> 45:49.000]  of you know the factor eight by bear this medication that was injected the
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.600]  people gave people HIV and AIDS killed a bunch of people eugenics you know the
[45:53.600 --> 45:58.160]  Nazis eugenics program go through the whole thing those two things and then
[45:58.160 --> 46:04.840]  the third thing false flag tear false flag tear it is their favorite from you
[46:04.840 --> 46:09.200]  know burning Rome and saying it was the Christians to the Nazis burning the
[46:09.200 --> 46:16.520]  Reichstag building to 9-11 and the Empire able to expand both here at home
[46:16.520 --> 46:20.080]  with police state legislation with the military commissions act with the
[46:20.080 --> 46:25.200]  Patriot acts that they passed and overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq false
[46:25.200 --> 46:29.480]  flag tear it's right there and the way that they you I mean the the three main
[46:29.480 --> 46:35.400]  mechanisms of this are the think tanks foundations those sorts of groups the
[46:35.400 --> 46:40.560]  CFRs the roundtable groups that uh of course G Edward Griffin talks about
[46:40.560 --> 46:45.280]  Bilderberg all these things quote-unquote think tanks informal organizations
[46:45.280 --> 46:53.120]  then government organizations things like the military the NSA the CIA you know
[46:53.120 --> 46:57.000]  the shadow government continuity government programs though that entity
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.800]  the the presidency has little to do with that you know the administration helps
[47:00.800 --> 47:05.440]  that policy and then the third thing that they all all three have in common is
[47:05.440 --> 47:11.000]  the psychological warfare on the people through psyops they are able to get
[47:11.000 --> 47:17.480]  people to accept these forms of control and I mean we are hit with it all day
[47:17.480 --> 47:22.680]  every day all the time everything you're watching I hate to tell you folks but it
[47:22.680 --> 47:27.960]  is garbage I have the TV out of my office during the day usually when Alex
[47:27.960 --> 47:30.960]  is doing the show while I'm going over news and I'm bringing in articles and
[47:30.960 --> 47:36.280]  whatnot and I'm also taping stuff in HD and it is just such brainwashing
[47:36.280 --> 47:43.560]  pro-world government garbage everything's going green everything's about
[47:43.560 --> 47:48.280]  carbon emissions now I can't turn on the television for more than 10 minutes
[47:48.280 --> 47:53.400]  it without you know them trying to make me feel guilty for the way that I'm
[47:53.400 --> 47:58.640]  living my life for the fact that I use gasoline all uses gasoline he must be
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.320]  the devil oh my goodness what kind of recycling is he doing he's not harnessing
[48:03.320 --> 48:08.520]  wind power he didn't take part in that global hour where everybody turned off
[48:08.520 --> 48:14.240]  the lights come on if we wanted to modernize third-world nations and second
[48:14.240 --> 48:19.040]  world nations we would do it but we don't because we believe not we but they
[48:19.040 --> 48:22.120]  believe the people at the top that the population is too large and no matter
[48:22.120 --> 48:26.160]  what eugenics programs they've put out there the fact that we've pumped all
[48:26.160 --> 48:30.840]  this funding and research into cancer cancer is not cured you know at least
[48:30.840 --> 48:33.680]  not on the public scale you know they want to radiate all these people do the
[48:33.680 --> 48:38.440]  same thing they were doing you know 40 and 50 years ago with all the fear
[48:38.440 --> 48:43.680]  mongering on AIDS I mean I covered how in 1990 I believe was 96 dr. David Ho was
[48:43.680 --> 48:49.000]  time and of the year on the cover showing how he had cured it with protease
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.840]  inhibitors and cocktails folks that's over 10 years ago and with all these
[48:53.840 --> 48:57.800]  eugenics programs with you know the Gardasil shots they're giving the girls
[48:57.800 --> 49:03.760]  the cancer viruses and the vaccines guess what the population still grows it's
[49:03.760 --> 49:09.520]  still go it's over 6 billion gonna be 7 billion before you know it so to these
[49:09.520 --> 49:15.920]  people they don't want to develop third world nation they don't want to develop
[49:15.920 --> 49:21.040]  humanity they don't want to empower the little guy because that that comes into
[49:21.040 --> 49:26.520]  conflict with their power structure that challenges them and God forbid they
[49:26.520 --> 49:33.880]  should try to love humanity and share with the rest of the world and empower
[49:33.880 --> 49:38.120]  us now they want to denigrate us they want to surf class they want to slave
[49:38.120 --> 49:43.280]  class they want us to bow down all in the guise of helping everybody oh this
[49:43.280 --> 49:48.160]  this new global agreement it's gonna help the world we're all gonna get
[49:48.160 --> 49:52.960]  together and it's gonna be sunshine and lollipops and rainbows and we're gonna
[49:52.960 --> 49:57.440]  sing songs and everything's gonna be better under this new green earth can't
[49:57.440 --> 50:00.520]  you wait but then they put the word sustainable in there you know who we use
[50:00.520 --> 50:05.400]  the word sustainable Ted Turner when he talks about how there's too many useless
[50:05.400 --> 50:09.680]  feeders in fact we'd better play that Ted Turner sustainability clip on the
[50:09.680 --> 50:14.280]  other side his people won't believe me he starts talking about how there's
[50:14.280 --> 50:17.880]  already too many people on the planet and that's what global warming is there's
[50:17.880 --> 50:22.080]  too many people doing too many things and soon we're all gonna they're all
[50:22.080 --> 50:25.080]  gonna die and the people that are left are gonna turn into cannibals are gonna
[50:25.080 --> 50:33.000]  be like third world nation and what we need is a more sustainable society well
[50:33.000 --> 50:37.400]  thank you Ted Turner it's so nice that you're you're into eugenics just like
[50:37.400 --> 50:40.560]  the rest of these monsters we're gonna come back on the other side we're gonna
[50:40.560 --> 50:44.480]  play that cliff we're gonna start taking your calls in the third hour Bob
[50:44.480 --> 50:50.760]  Chapman at the top of the second hour prisonplan.tv infowars.com
[50:50.760 --> 51:05.160]  this year many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on
[51:05.160 --> 51:09.880]  and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future in these troubled
[51:09.880 --> 51:13.840]  times one of the most important things your family can have is good health some
[51:13.840 --> 51:17.760]  of the contributors to poor health are parasites viruses toxins and heavy
[51:17.760 --> 51:23.480]  metals it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans in 85% of people around the

[54:11.680 --> 54:15.520]  Jones is joining us right now to discuss this g20 communicate and
[54:15.520 --> 54:20.840]  announcement Alex hey Jason I'm just making a lane change here almost got
[54:20.840 --> 54:25.800]  hit sorry about that yeah how's my cell phone coming in it's coming in well
[54:25.800 --> 54:32.200]  okay good I did a lot of research last night I read the whole g20 communicate
[54:32.200 --> 54:36.080]  I know it's up on info wars dot com and present by the dot com folks can just
[54:36.080 --> 54:43.400]  google g20 communicate and they can read it from CNN and Fox everywhere else if
[54:43.400 --> 54:47.520]  they want and it clearly states you know not only are they saying they're
[54:47.520 --> 54:51.920]  setting up a new world order and at least at 15 20 newspapers I've seen
[54:51.920 --> 54:57.360]  have had a new world order is born the council on farm relations has put out a
[54:57.360 --> 55:01.400]  press release saying this is global governance and hailing it is the birth
[55:01.400 --> 55:05.200]  of the new world order I mean just hundreds and hundreds of reports but
[55:05.200 --> 55:10.600]  more than a dozen saying the birth of a new world order then we look at what is
[55:10.600 --> 55:15.880]  a new world order and they define it a world central bank owned by private
[55:15.880 --> 55:20.680]  banks ruling every country on the planet setting world taxes the
[55:20.680 --> 55:27.120]  international bank of settlements in the OECD dominating everyone and remember
[55:27.120 --> 55:33.880]  they claim they're fixing a crisis that they created by design and I saw time
[55:33.880 --> 55:42.600]  magazine today so I picked it up and the cover of it is the end of excess the
[55:42.600 --> 55:47.040]  crisis is good for America and I knew what I'd read once I opened it up but
[55:47.040 --> 55:50.920]  it sure if it was there oh we've been greedy we've been bad we bought SUVs
[55:50.920 --> 55:55.880]  that's why everything's falling down it's not the international bankers it's
[55:55.880 --> 55:59.440]  not the global crime syndicate blowing up the economy by design to consolidate
[55:59.440 --> 56:04.400]  it's all our fault Americans and the whole world's been told it's our fault
[56:04.400 --> 56:07.920]  see George Bush was meant to set that idea up by the part of the bad guy now
[56:07.920 --> 56:13.820]  Obama's the savior he took his orders they said in England I miss his
[56:13.820 --> 56:19.320]  mainstream news he he understood that you know America's bad and that it's his
[56:19.320 --> 56:25.320]  job to you know to admit that and and but but don't worry that the new global
[56:25.320 --> 56:30.720]  Europe as Gordon Brown calls it the new new world order so so not only have
[56:30.720 --> 56:34.400]  people denied there's a new world order all these years we specifically said
[56:34.400 --> 56:38.880]  what it was an international banking cartel setting up world government and
[56:38.880 --> 56:44.080]  now they say yes this is the new world order and this is how we define it an
[56:44.080 --> 56:48.000]  international banking cartel ruin the planet with financial and military
[56:48.000 --> 56:54.360]  force and we're gonna have this age of austerity and feudalism and serfdom to
[56:54.360 --> 56:58.720]  teach you better and all these headlines are saying well we're not gonna live as
[56:58.720 --> 57:02.760]  well now this is what we deserve they've always been setting this up they've
[57:02.760 --> 57:06.320]  always been preparing this and all the yuppies bought into the stock market and
[57:06.320 --> 57:10.480]  bought into putting their 401ks in there in their pensions and now that your
[57:10.480 --> 57:14.480]  master's the establishment are gonna take it all from you and if you don't
[57:14.480 --> 57:17.760]  like it they're gonna send guys in black uniforms by to blow you and your
[57:17.760 --> 57:22.600]  children's heads off now that's if we let them get to the next phase that they're
[57:22.600 --> 57:26.320]  going for but you know these are the globalists they funded the Soviets and
[57:26.320 --> 57:30.320]  the Nazis to vertically integrate society and control it but to read that
[57:30.320 --> 57:34.640]  communicate you know they had said they were gonna set up world government they
[57:34.640 --> 57:37.840]  had of course I think leaked weeks ago they had said this but now they've
[57:37.840 --> 57:43.440]  agreed to do it they always use the psychology of don't worry new order is
[57:43.440 --> 57:48.920]  not coming right now and you know CNN oh it's just a joke haha don't worry it
[57:48.920 --> 57:54.080]  you know it's not coming for a while it's already here but they say that so
[57:54.080 --> 58:00.120]  people will stand down so people will go along with this Jason and I'm just

[1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:30.120]  breaking news on that a hostage situation and multiple deaths shooting in
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:33.680]  binghamton new york binghamton of course about 50 miles from where I live in
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:37.480]  oniana it's right on the border of pennsylvania it's it's happening in an
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:41.280]  american civic association building that apparently helps immigrants and
[1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:46.480]  refugees and so the media was saying you know at least four were shot 20 people
[1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:50.520]  have been taken hostage I contacted my friend who is a state trooper in new
[1:00:50.520 --> 1:00:54.480]  york he hadn't heard anything about it he called it in and apparently his
[1:00:54.480 --> 1:00:57.440]  information and this is his information we're gonna try to get them on at the
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:00.800]  eight after i'll see if i can get them to come on the show he's saying 40 people
[1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:04.040]  are dead right now and he's still hold up there so this is about to be the
[1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:07.160]  biggest news in the country it doesn't matter that they just announced world
[1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:10.560]  government doesn't matter there was some wind on the mainstream media this is
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:13.920]  going to be this is going to be topic a and it's going to be about gun
[1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:20.160]  confiscation alex well in every case in every issue came out in Alabama it came
[1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:24.200]  out in germany three weeks ago they were both on serotonry have taken

[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:39.000]  it or they'll probably try to ban criticizing immigrants I mean they're
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.960]  already Supreme Court's hearing arguments about banning films criticizing
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:48.760]  anybody in government so the press I mean you can't make up how crazy all of
[1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:52.800]  this is and just notice how soon as Obama got elected mass shooting mass
[1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:57.280]  shooting mass shooting mass shooting mass shooting mass shooting mass shooting
[1:01:57.280 --> 1:02:02.120]  mass shooting and now they're saying we got to restrict your guns because of
[1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:08.120]  Mexico collapsing when Mexico has total gun bans and we have all this going on
[1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:11.480]  just get ready for the fight of your lives the new world order is moving on
[1:02:11.480 --> 1:02:15.760]  every front the government did it with their pros act pushing one way or the
[1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:22.080]  engineered it the other way you know either way you cut it that's the way
[1:02:22.080 --> 1:02:29.440]  that this is so I know I'm gonna let you continue to cover the mass shooting
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:34.320]  thing I'll call back in later as all of this unfolds Jason I want you to get
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:37.640]  the Bob Chapman on what's happening on the economy front but here they are

[1:02:56.280 --> 1:03:00.160]  Jason what do you say to all the people who written all these hundreds of
[1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:04.280]  articles thousands of articles about patriots saying that none of this
[1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:13.000]  exists saying that you know there is no such thing as a new world order period
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.520]  or that okay there's a new order but that's not world government and then
[1:03:16.520 --> 1:03:20.400]  specifically announcing world government global governance run by banks
[1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:24.240]  exactly as we always said I mean it's ridiculous we can't even get the
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:28.200]  cowardly public to admit reality when it's in their face and that's why you're
[1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:31.600]  gonna lose everything your guns your pension funds everything I'm not talking
[1:03:31.600 --> 1:03:35.640]  to the general audience I'm talking to people that are in denial yeah that is
[1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:41.360]  exactly right and we can't curl up in a fetal position because we are opposed by
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:44.640]  these people I mean they're right out in the open right now and they try to say
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:48.240]  oh we're going to help third world nations you just have to read the
[1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:52.280]  language of sustainability and you talked about the OECD in this world
[1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:56.240]  government this is a subsection of section 15 of this communique to take
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:00.840]  action against non-cooperative jurisdictions to stand ready to deploy
[1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:06.440]  sanctions to protect our public finances and our financial institutions we know
[1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:09.920]  that the OECD has today published a list of countries assessed by the global
[1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:14.480]  forum against the international standard of exchange of taxes

[1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:34.720]  that they're using sustainability environmentalism to freeze out the
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:37.880]  third world so you hear about money to the third world that means loan
[1:04:37.880 --> 1:04:42.480]  sharking loans to their dictators God bless you Jason come back with a state

[1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:30.920]  time proto grow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity
[1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:33.840]  to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants

[1:08:12.680 --> 1:08:17.120]  all right folks we are back as the Alex Jones show I'm Jason Bermas sitting in
[1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:21.920]  and I just got off the phone with my police officer friend he's gonna be
[1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:25.880]  joining us in about seven minutes just to give an update he's saying that is
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:29.840]  correct it's only four that have been shot right now apparently there are 40
[1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:35.240]  hostages plus he's telling me that the sheriff's department is down there he's
[1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:41.160]  also telling me that the feds are about to come in and he he's actually out
[1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:45.960]  snowboarding in in Vermont and one of his police friends just called him like
[1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:49.960]  right after I texted him so he's gonna do five minutes on the other side with
[1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:55.960]  us give us an update apparently this guy is of Asian descent and I have no other
[1:08:55.960 --> 1:08:59.080]  details other than that we're gonna find out what he's using what it looks like
[1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:02.640]  the obviously doesn't look like there's going to be a pretty resolution if four
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:07.880]  people are dead already I mean this is a this is gonna be big news but it seems
[1:09:07.880 --> 1:09:11.240]  like it's going to be a huge distraction I know we have Bob Chapman coming up I'm
[1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:16.040]  not sure if he's on the line yet and we do have Bob good all right then we're
[1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:19.360]  gonna we're gonna go to Bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com the
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:23.080]  next six minutes we're gonna talk about this G20 the coming out party of the
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:28.840]  New World Order and then we're going to we're going to have my buddy on for
[1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:34.760]  about five minutes let's see let's go to Bob right now Bob did you read this new
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:41.520]  communique or hear the Gordon Brown speech from yesterday? I perused it
[1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:48.120]  and he's calling for the New World Order. Oh it's absolutely New World Order
[1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:54.760]  order takeover document they are talking about the IMF and the SDR and
[1:09:54.760 --> 1:09:58.760]  basically the Federal Reserve coming together they're talking about establishing
[1:09:58.760 --> 1:10:03.360]  their new financial stability board their FSB they're talking about going
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:06.560]  after other countries that are outside of this with sanctions they're also
[1:10:06.560 --> 1:10:10.520]  saying that countries can no longer try to profit off one another if it's
[1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:14.040]  detrimental to another country in this again calling for global government and
[1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:17.640]  then at the end you know they let us know they're gonna play off of our fear of
[1:10:17.640 --> 1:10:22.800]  climate changes by reaffirming their commitment to address the threat of
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:26.600]  irreversible climate change you know it's irreversible Bob there's nothing we
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:32.400]  can do about it so let's just tax us for it it's unbelievable and you're right
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:38.800]  about the facts as far as Brown and the others I think one of the things that's
[1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:44.320]  not being annunciated at the meetings and it's probably the main topic of
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:49.960]  conversation behind the scenes and that is the reserve status of the dollar if
[1:10:49.960 --> 1:10:55.380]  you've noticed that there's been virtually nothing said about it but the
[1:10:55.380 --> 1:11:01.600]  dollar is going to be phased out there's no question and will it go to a
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:08.680]  group of say 10 currencies as a new international monetary trading unit that
[1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:13.080]  remains to be seen probably that's what they way they will go at the beginning
[1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:19.440]  as far as the SDR is concerned there's nothing backing it it's just an
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:27.720]  expansion of fiat money sort of an extension of the federal reserve
[1:11:27.720 --> 1:11:34.200]  system internationally and they're all on the wagon all the big countries
[1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:39.480]  especially the top 20 and they do not not be on the wagon because as you said
[1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:44.960]  in the communique they said that you know if you step out of line you toast
[1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:51.120]  this is essentially what they're saying and so the SDR will be used but it
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:55.040]  doesn't mean anything because there's nothing backing it and it's going to be
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:11:59.360]  between countries for the most part people aren't going to be running around
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:04.720]  what SDR is in their pockets and that's where I think another currency unit
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:09.320]  comes in until they can merge them all together and this is going to take
[1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:13.520]  some time to do it isn't going to happen over two years or so it's going to take
[1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:18.520]  several years or more and all depends what they run into along the way but I
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:26.600]  think in essence and you could tell this by the body English from President
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:34.600]  Obama and that is the US is now experiencing probably the beginning of
[1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:41.320]  a long funeral and the dollar is going to be phased out SDR is and then I think
[1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:46.600]  a international unit will be formed and then they'll go for world government
[1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:52.160]  after that and if we don't stop them here in the next year or two it's really
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:57.000]  over for us well I agree I mean I don't know if there's any way to stop this I
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.080]  mean if you just look at what they're calling for you know they want to fund
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:05.400]  and reform our international financial institutions they want to promote global
[1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:10.480]  trade and reject protectionism in other words no internal economies no self
[1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:13.800]  sustainable economies they don't want us to produce anything in this country
[1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:18.400]  anymore and then they want to build an inclusive green and sustainable recovery
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:22.760]  and you know every time they use that word sustainable it means less for us
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:29.080]  more for them and I mean by less for us it might even mean death for us that's
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:37.360]  exactly true if you speak against it at some time in the future you will be
[1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:42.360]  incarcerated there's just no question it's coming you've seen that in some of
[1:13:42.360 --> 1:13:46.960]  the laws that they have in Europe already if you challenge certain things
[1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:54.480]  like the status of immigration or we just recently in Scandinavia had a case
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:14:05.200]  where somebody spoke out about the rape of a of a domestic woman or someone
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:12.160]  who lived in and I think it was a Sweden was raped by 20 immigrants or
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:17.000]  something like that and now they brought charges against the person who said
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  you know let's get them out of the country and so all of these people who
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:28.040]  speak out against anything that they don't like are gonna get shut up and it
[1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:32.200]  it's eventually gonna lead to revolution there's no question and they
[1:14:32.200 --> 1:14:34.880]  think they can handle it and I can promise you they're not gonna handle it
[1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:39.080]  because you're gonna have it in every country I mean they're talking now about
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:45.080]  Mexico falling apart and Mexico is not falling apart it's it's them saying
[1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:51.600]  that it is economic problems just like everybody else but you know you you've
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:58.680]  got a coiterie of well-trained narcotics you might call them soldiers so to
[1:14:58.680 --> 1:15:05.920]  speak trying to ply their trade because America wants lots of drugs and in the
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:10.560]  government saying no no you can't do that for two reasons number one they're not
[1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:16.640]  paying them enough money to stay shut up and number two the CIA and the banks
[1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:21.880]  want the cartels broken up so they can get the business well if you look at
[1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:26.480]  this document section 18 is all about Mexico and the IMF's new flexible credit
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:30.840]  line and supporting Mexico's decision to seek this flexible credit line so it
[1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:36.280]  seems to me you know Mexico is right in line with this total global plan to
[1:15:36.280 --> 1:15:40.200]  bring in not only a world currency but world government hold on one moment Bob
[1:15:40.200 --> 1:15:48.200]  let's see if we have my friend on the line we got him yet John no not yet okay
[1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:53.760]  all right that way the people who are running Mexico or all US educated you
[1:15:53.760 --> 1:15:59.560]  know Ivy League graduates and they're all in on it and the election in Mexico
[1:15:59.560 --> 1:16:05.040]  was stolen just like it was in the United States and you know they're doing
[1:16:05.040 --> 1:16:09.120]  what they want to do they know they get troops walking up and down the streets
[1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:13.040]  but you know how many people I got they have 40,000 troops I mean the country is
[1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:16.720]  almost as big as the United States I mean do they really think they're going to
[1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:20.960]  keep the public down guns are illegal in Mexico but I can tell you right now
[1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:27.120]  that like every other Latin American country many many people have guns and
[1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:32.040]  so it's not going to be as easy as what government thinks it's going to be
[1:16:32.040 --> 1:16:37.160]  short of an invasion but you know where is the US going to get the troops from
[1:16:37.160 --> 1:16:42.720]  and they're sending another 40,000 to Afghanistan absolutely well I think
[1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:46.040]  they're gonna rely more on NATO troops as they expand that kind of power I mean
[1:16:46.040 --> 1:16:49.640]  how are they going to go after these nations that don't go along I mean the
[1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:55.040]  reaffirming all these pledges you know they set up the framework in the you
[1:16:55.040 --> 1:17:00.840]  know years and months before these kind of summits for instance they're
[1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:05.720]  committing to implementing the World Bank reforms agreed to in 2008 the
[1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:10.560]  reaffirming reaffirming their historic commitments to meeting the Millennium
[1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:14.520]  Development goals to achieving our respective ODA pledges including
[1:17:14.520 --> 1:17:20.040]  commitments on aid for trade debt relief the gleneglas commitments and especially
[1:17:20.040 --> 1:17:23.960]  to Africa so they really are just furthering I mean this isn't a new
[1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:27.800]  document and that what we saw was a stage show I mean Sarkozy saying oh I'm
[1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:31.440]  gonna walk out that was all bull he was never planning to walk out we need to
[1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:36.360]  get something done all this was set up I mean we had Sean Hannity I don't know
[1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:39.360]  if you've seen this clip yet but Sean Hannity and Dick Morris earlier in the
[1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:42.920]  week admitted that we were right and that they were creating a global currency
[1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:46.240]  and global governance and you went control I couldn't believe it he of
[1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:50.040]  course they refer to us as conspiracy nuts but at least they gave us a credit
[1:17:50.040 --> 1:17:56.120]  to the fact that we were right well we are right we were right well at least in
[1:17:56.120 --> 1:18:02.240]  my book since 1960 and and you know they're pushing one way we're pushing
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:07.440]  the other it's just that you know there's a small cadre of people like you
[1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:12.200]  and Alex and a handful of others and you know they have this giant apparatus
[1:18:12.200 --> 1:18:18.200]  at their control and they have all of this tremendous amounts of funds that
[1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:27.240]  they can go in and serve up news that is total propaganda and in the public you
[1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:31.400]  know is so confused and doesn't know what's going on and you know they don't
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:36.800]  know how to grasp it and then on top of that they shut up a lot of the third
[1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:41.560]  world countries by creating this one point one trillion dollar fund which
[1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:46.880]  they're going to subsidize just about everything the problem with that is
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:53.440]  they're looking down the the barrel of hyperinflation and it's soon to come
[1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:57.840]  and it's going to be very strong and that's a sacrifice they've got to make
[1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:01.600]  along with the fact that the dollar is going to go down in value now that has
[1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:05.800]  already begun in fact we taught taught call the top of the dollar market
[1:19:05.800 --> 1:19:12.280]  incidentally and and and over the next year it'll slowly sink down and after
[1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:15.680]  that it'll get down more quickly and all currencies are going to go down
[1:19:15.680 --> 1:19:21.160]  against gold and there's no way they can go up I mean when you you went let's say
[1:19:21.160 --> 1:19:25.920]  you have a million dollars outstanding and you triple it to three million the
[1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:29.880]  dollars you've got to got to be worth one third of what they were before I mean
[1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:35.960]  it there's no mystery to it yeah it is a little mathematics I want to get your
[1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:40.720]  take on the IMF saying it's going to sell hundreds of tons I think it was 400
[1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:45.080]  tons of gold they've already sold 35 tons of gold get your take on that Bob

[1:24:27.320 --> 1:24:31.720]  him on the next 30 seconds I want to go back to Bob Chapman and talk about the
[1:24:31.720 --> 1:24:35.600]  IMF discussing selling off I believe it's a 400 tons of gold we could bring that
[1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:41.080]  story up this one is at a CNN at least four people were killed on a Friday when
[1:24:41.080 --> 1:24:44.520]  a man now opened fire in a building in Binghamton New York a law enforcement
[1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:47.760]  source close the situation said the source said that there were more than a
[1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:52.440]  dozen wounded the man began shooting in the American Civic Association which
[1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:57.720]  helps immigrants refugees during their citizenship test so these are people
[1:24:57.720 --> 1:25:01.800]  that are actually trying to become legal citizens unbelievable let's see the
[1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:05.200]  source said there may be 20 to 40 people who have been taken hostage apparently
[1:25:05.200 --> 1:25:10.040]  this guy still hold up there they're bringing in the feds just crazy crazy
[1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:13.240]  stuff this is gonna be the real reason that we're covering this is because this
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:16.520]  is gonna be national news gonna be all over the place it's going to be a
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:21.440]  reason to restrict guns even further in New York State remember it's almost
[1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:26.000]  impossible to get a carrying conceal permit in the state I mean you know
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:31.040]  there's a hunting culture there but it's all shotguns and and rifles it's it's
[1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:35.520]  not a handgun culture it's not you know a militia culture it's really especially
[1:25:35.520 --> 1:25:40.120]  in the city it's an unarmed culture well we wait for hopefully my buddy to get
[1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:44.880]  back on the line I want to get Bob Chapman's take on the IMF selling off
[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:48.080]  all this gold what do you think that's about Bob
[1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:54.640]  first of all did you say that they said that they already sold 35 tons I believe
[1:25:54.640 --> 1:25:58.080]  that was that the headline was 400 but when you read into the article I'll
[1:25:58.080 --> 1:26:01.440]  bring it up I have my guys print but I think they already said they've sold
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:10.920]  35 tons yeah mmm it's news to me but anyway 400 tons let's back up a step
[1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:18.000]  here first of all every year the European individual banks under the old
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:24.680]  Washington agreement they have a five-year agreement and it's up this
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:31.640]  coming fall and all indications that are that they're going to renew it and each
[1:26:31.640 --> 1:26:42.400]  country gets a allotment to sell gold and the maximum is 500 tons now they
[1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:48.040]  were selling for 450 the year before last your last year it dropped down to
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:53.960]  something like 390 in other words governments weren't participating as
[1:26:53.960 --> 1:27:01.600]  much as they could within the program this year they are probably sold and I
[1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:06.800]  don't know the exact figure but I'll guess that probably 50 times not very
[1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:12.920]  much and that goal that was supposed to come to market or was available to come
[1:27:12.920 --> 1:27:22.880]  to market through central banks in Italy France Sweden whatever that will not be
[1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:29.360]  in existence if the IMF thought sells gold now the reason IMF is selling gold
[1:27:29.360 --> 1:27:35.000]  is yes to raise funds and number two to suppress the price but it's not going to
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:40.880]  be very suppressive because it's just going to supplant the sale by the
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:46.120]  European banks that would be normally coming to market as prices and gold
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:52.280]  rose and they wanted to get what they call more liquidity second of all it
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:59.360]  would be if it had to be phased in over a period of time and maybe two or three
[1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:04.520]  or four or five years which would not really affect the market at all and then
[1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:12.120]  as a proviso that if they can sell it off market they will do so and I should
[1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:15.920]  suppose the Rothschilds would be standing there rubbing their hands just like
[1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:20.360]  they were when England was selling at 275 and they were buying it up hand over
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:25.400]  fist and that's it and that's a fact that they were the buyers for the most
[1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:31.520]  part yes and then I thought that they have to be approved pardon me I said
[1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:35.520]  this is a further consolidation of all this you know all these precious metals
[1:28:35.520 --> 1:28:40.600]  for these people correct right and and further of the United States Congress
[1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:45.280]  has to approve it and whether they will or not remains to be seen historically
[1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:52.800]  they have not wanted to and so the price of gold is hanging around $900
[1:28:52.800 --> 1:29:01.920]  an ounce today it came down 25 or $30 an ounce because of the announcement that
[1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:08.880]  they wanted to sell at 403 tons of gold and they might want to sell more but
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:13.640]  you heard my explanation so it's not really going to affect the market that
[1:29:13.640 --> 1:29:21.040]  much and when they sold gold back in the 70s gold came off about $20 an ounce
[1:29:21.040 --> 1:29:27.200]  and after the sale was over it went berserk well this article is telling me
[1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:31.840]  it's a 403 tons of gold but that the European Central Bank said Wednesday
[1:29:31.840 --> 1:29:36.440]  it had already completed the sale of 35.5 tons of gold it's Bob Chapman the

[1:31:22.640 --> 1:31:27.320]  fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a

[1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:04.200]  that gold story there are so many headlines out today and in the past
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:10.080]  couple of days about g20 shapes new world order with lesser role for us and
[1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:13.440]  markets that's a Bloomberg headline I mean they're coming out right here and
[1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:17.160]  saying global leaders took their biggest steps yet towards a new world order
[1:34:17.160 --> 1:34:21.600]  that's less u.s. centric with more heavily regulated financial industry and
[1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:26.200]  a greater role for the international institutions and quote unquote emerging
[1:34:26.200 --> 1:34:31.240]  markets so this is all pro globalization this means less for us I mean when
[1:34:31.240 --> 1:34:36.200]  Obama said that we were gonna have to sacrifice he wasn't kidding well you're
[1:34:36.200 --> 1:34:41.440]  right and this is one of the works for some time about 20 years as far as
[1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:47.080]  financial regulations concerned and what they want to do is bring all of the
[1:34:47.080 --> 1:34:53.360]  regulation for banks any kind of lenders brokerage firms private equity firms
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:35:00.720]  insurance companies etc and they want to bring them under one set of rules and
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:06.360]  those rules will be promulgated and run from perhaps the Brussels or Frankfurt
[1:35:06.360 --> 1:35:12.000]  or wherever they're going to run them from and but it'll be Eurocentric so
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:17.080]  to speak and they want to run everything in the world financially and what
[1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:22.080]  they'll eventually looking for in the final analysis as far as currency is
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:28.760]  concerned is a world currency which is digital with both with gold backing
[1:35:28.760 --> 1:35:35.800]  supposedly and this currency because of the nature of it being digital will
[1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:40.400]  mean that every government and the central database if you want to call it
[1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:46.240]  that we'll know how much money you have or how much units you have or how many
[1:35:46.240 --> 1:35:51.640]  units you have I should say and they'll know exactly what's going on in your
[1:35:51.640 --> 1:35:58.600]  financial life and of course it'll go on from there next will be who's gonna be
[1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:03.240]  able to go to university who's gonna be able to study what who's gonna be able
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:08.840]  to marry who who's gonna be able to breed and in on and on and on I mean and
[1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:14.040]  this is really really frightening nothing new to me because you know I've
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:18.600]  seen it for the past 50 years but to the average person with listening today
[1:36:18.600 --> 1:36:23.800]  this has been a long time coming this is a dream of world government and we've
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:28.680]  got to stop yeah even Anderson Cooper when discussing what happened to the G20
[1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:33.160]  made the comment that when Gordon Brown mentioned a new world order this
[1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:36.000]  worried a lot of people in the United States because of the negative
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:40.440]  connotation the phrasing has with people like you and myself because we know
[1:36:40.440 --> 1:36:44.080]  what the new world order is I mean it seems like this is their coming out
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:48.200]  party there's headlines everywhere we had the new world order in time we had
[1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:52.960]  Obama's new world order in time just last year they're openly talking about a
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:59.000]  carbon tax system I mean this is it I mean we even had any on Davignon admit
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:02.800]  yesterday in the mainstream press that the euro was brought about from the
[1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:07.200]  Bilderberg group in the 90s and we know that the euro is a currency supported by
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:16.800]  the globalists well I lived in Europe during the 1950s and 60s and this was
[1:37:16.800 --> 1:37:22.960]  bantied about when they had the European common market so it goes back to the late
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:31.200]  40s and the early 50s and you could sit and read and any publication throughout
[1:37:31.200 --> 1:37:36.880]  Europe the plans for the European economic community which eventually became
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:43.040]  the European Union and they talked about the currency then they didn't talk
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:47.600]  about world currency but they talked about the borderless Europe and so on
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:52.640]  and so forth and of course the excuse in those days was so that it could be
[1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:59.680]  defended against the the demons from Russia and also so that Germany could
[1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:05.520]  not rise again and these were the excuses in those days and so you know the
[1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:10.840]  game has changed somewhat but that's where they're headed it's absolutely
[1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:14.560]  where they're headed how can we take what are the best proactive steps right
[1:38:14.560 --> 1:38:18.160]  now your average citizen can take to combatting this because our movements
[1:38:18.160 --> 1:38:22.320]  have really been co-opted by people like Glenn Beck offer instance Glenn Beck is
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:27.960]  going to be here in San Antonio with his 912 project on April 15th and a lot of
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:30.880]  these people are well-meaning people they're angry at the government they
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:33.880]  don't know who to turn to they're watching the mainstream media so
[1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:37.560]  automatically they go to Glenn Beck but Glenn Beck is about to have popular
[1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:41.760]  mechanics come on his show and debunk the FEMA camps Glenn Beck isn't talking
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:46.320]  about the mandatory service in the give act you know Glenn Beck isn't on TV
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:50.680]  screaming bloody murder about the G20 summit and the announcement of a new
[1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:56.720]  world order the Glenn Beck is a change agent yeah you sure he certainly is
[1:38:56.720 --> 1:39:03.320]  the whole group are and you know it's like 70% 80% true and the rest of it's
[1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:07.520]  all propaganda and they get away with for the very reasons that you talk about
[1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:13.760]  and what we have to do is get more stations more reach more people and tell
[1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:18.080]  them the truth they have Glenn Beck you know here's the real truth this is what
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:21.560]  he's leaving out well we're gonna be going down there and I'm going to be
[1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:26.600]  taking with me you know the army regulation 210-35 the civilian inmate
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:29.800]  labor program to show to everybody making multiple copies we're gonna be
[1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:33.840]  handing out copies of the Obama deception but really what what angers me
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:37.360]  the most is that you know the Patriot movement the 9-11 truth movement we
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:41.680]  really pioneered doing these tea parties in the last 10 or so years you
[1:39:41.680 --> 1:39:44.800]  know what I mean we're the ones who've been going out protesting the IRS
[1:39:44.800 --> 1:39:49.400]  protesting the 9-11 Commission and now Glenn Beck is taking up the tea
[1:39:49.400 --> 1:39:54.880]  parties completely and totally co-opting what we worked so hard for in the last
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:40:00.640]  few years it seems like a page right out of Cointel Pro Bob well it's the
[1:40:00.640 --> 1:40:08.120]  protected opposition and in other words the opposition is now going to be
[1:40:08.120 --> 1:40:16.640]  controlled by the the puppet bastards in Washington if you may and it was to be
[1:40:16.640 --> 1:40:22.560]  expected I mean they've had some of these change agents working for years but
[1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:27.520]  now they're going at a big time in order to neutralize what we're doing yeah it
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:31.560]  is it is unbelievable that more people can't see through this guy who is
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:35.120]  completely and totally disingenuous but I guess when you get up on television
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:38.960]  and you start to put on a big fake crying act and you love this country
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:43.800]  you're gonna sucker a lot of the rubes in and again it is just so upsetting that
[1:40:43.800 --> 1:40:47.360]  they can understand now that the Federal Reserve banking system is corrupt but
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:51.120]  it seems like as soon as they figured that out it doesn't matter because the
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:55.880]  IMF comes in and they're gonna print a world currency and the G20 comes in and
[1:40:55.880 --> 1:41:00.360]  says they're gonna have a new global regulation system for world banking and
[1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:03.720]  we're just gonna muscle out any of these third world nations or second world
[1:41:03.720 --> 1:41:08.400]  nations that don't want to go along and we're going to make it illegal to to
[1:41:08.400 --> 1:41:11.560]  basically build any kind of infrastructure in your own country if it
[1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:15.040]  doesn't benefit these other countries I mean that's basically what they're
[1:41:15.040 --> 1:41:19.320]  saying it is as you know we can't have these protectionist policies that means
[1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:23.760]  no infrastructure in the U.S. economy you know they want to build an
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:27.120]  infrastructure in their North American Union economy I think that's what we're
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:33.160]  gonna see with this presidency a North American Union by 2012. Well that's what
[1:41:33.160 --> 1:41:39.080]  they're looking for and so far we've shot them down the only thing they still
[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:43.920]  do is harmonizing which means they're taking existing laws that are in the
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:48.960]  United States and they're matching them up with Canada and Mexico and Canada
[1:41:48.960 --> 1:41:53.920]  and Mexico are now labeling their foods with how much salt and sugar and
[1:41:53.920 --> 1:42:01.120]  whatever they've got in the contents of the can of the bottle and they're just
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:06.520]  trying to make the regulations the same so that when they're ready to go all
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:14.600]  that groundwork will be done you know even today when when you send things
[1:42:14.600 --> 1:42:22.040]  across borders from the United States to Canada now they now want the an
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:28.960]  explanation of what is being sent and what is it and what does it do and what
[1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:33.080]  is the tax ID number of the person who's sending it or their social security
[1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:39.360]  number you talk about police state and this is getting worse by the day and a
[1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:44.440]  few people out there don't think it is you're wrong it's dreadful and you know
[1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:51.840]  this whole thing is just closing in on us like a giant amoeba that's gonna be
[1:42:51.840 --> 1:42:58.760]  able to smother us all in the final analysis with new laws and new rules and
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:04.480]  and many of the things that we've discussed on the show before and and
[1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:09.920]  they're working on all fronts and yes they're out in the open and yes now
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:15.040]  they try to call up we're doing they're not going to be successful and it's just
[1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:18.940]  going to make our work harder what our problem is we don't have enough Alex
[1:43:18.940 --> 1:43:23.560]  Joneses you know we need three or four or five thousand of them all over the
[1:43:23.560 --> 1:43:27.400]  world yelling at the top of their lungs this is what these Cretans are trying to
[1:43:27.400 --> 1:43:32.520]  do to you that's our problem nobody's got the guts to get out there and tell
[1:43:32.520 --> 1:43:37.120]  people the truth and take the slings and arrows from government and being
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:42.120]  audited by the iris 15 or 20 years in a row in all of our harassment that goes
[1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:46.040]  with it yeah it seems like people really need to step up to the plate
[1:43:46.040 --> 1:43:49.280]  especially in light of things like the my act report that was out there and
[1:43:49.280 --> 1:43:52.680]  that definitely seems like it was out on a federal level I had somebody call
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:57.920]  into my program this week and his girlfriend got pulled over in
[1:43:57.920 --> 1:44:02.200]  Los Angeles County and she asked why she was pulled over and literally the cop
[1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:05.560]  told her we pulled you over because of your Ron Paul bumper sticker so that
[1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:10.360]  tells me that that my act report has a large reach you know they weren't
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:12.040]  kidding when they said they were going to put it
[1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:16.360]  of federally in public and private sectors across the country it obviously
[1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:20.400]  went through that way and for somebody to be pulled over for a bumper sticker
[1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:23.920]  for a third-party political candy and not really even a third-party political
[1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:28.800]  candy or republican political candidate that the establishment doesn't like is
[1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:32.400]  is just beyond or well into me
[1:44:32.400 --> 1:44:36.240]  it's it's my control it's total control
[1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:39.680]  and that's why so many people are are leaving the country
[1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:42.600]  i don't know that they're going to be at betting any better off any place else
[1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:43.560]  but
[1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:45.880]  they don't say where where where could
[1:44:45.880 --> 1:44:49.320]  where do people think they're going to run from this this g-20 was a global
[1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:50.200]  summit
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:53.960]  they live we talked about having sanctions about against countries that
[1:44:53.960 --> 1:44:57.600]  don't go along with it i mean they're talking about for instance uh... let's
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:44:58.360]  see
[1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:02.760]  uh... that that that that that uh... we reaffirm the commitment made in uh...
[1:45:02.760 --> 1:45:07.120]  washington to refrain from raising new barriers of investment or to trade of
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:11.160]  goods and services or imposing new uh... export restrictions or implementing
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:12.600]  the world trade organizations
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:14.160]  inconsistent measures
[1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:16.500]  uh... to stimulate exports with each other
[1:45:16.500 --> 1:45:17.360]  so in other words
[1:45:17.360 --> 1:45:20.640]  they're they're creating a system where there are no barriers of trade where
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:25.360]  there is are no tariffs it will be a truly global economy for those who work
[1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:28.200]  with them but we won't be able to produce anything will have to take what we
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:29.200]  can get
[1:45:29.200 --> 1:45:32.040]  and when they talk about sustainability that means less
[1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:32.920]  and less
[1:45:32.920 --> 1:45:37.360]  and less i mean how do you feel when you hear the right hand man of gordon
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:38.420]  brown saying
[1:45:38.420 --> 1:45:41.400]  that the uh... uk's population has to get from
[1:45:41.400 --> 1:45:44.280]  seventy uh... million people to thirty million
[1:45:44.280 --> 1:45:46.920]  i mean how does that even work how is that going to happen in the next twenty
[1:45:46.920 --> 1:45:50.000]  years if they don't plan on killing a bunch of us bob
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.240]  that's right or they're going to
[1:45:52.240 --> 1:45:54.360]  uh... put in breeding control
[1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:57.000]  uh... like the chinese after so long
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:00.320]  and then it will be selective breeding
[1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:04.600]  and uh... everybody will be dna and they'll say okay that couple over there
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:07.240]  uh... who we told to get married
[1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:09.600]  uh... they can breed and uh...
[1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:13.680]  and everything that works out alright uh... the boys that come through
[1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:17.280]  uh... will be engineers and the girls that come through will be doctors or
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:18.520]  something like that
[1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:19.800]  i mean this is how
[1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:22.000]  unbelievable this is but this
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:23.880]  this was all this information
[1:46:23.880 --> 1:46:27.440]  was available up to us in the nineteen sixties
[1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:31.040]  and you know we were screaming at the top of our lungs
[1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:33.600]  nobody wanted to hear it
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:34.680]  it's here
[1:46:34.680 --> 1:46:35.760]  yet is here
[1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:39.920]  and now it is now and uh... people like alex jones have been screaming this
[1:46:39.920 --> 1:46:43.120]  at the top of their lungs for over a decade
[1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:46.960]  i guess we got that thirty seconds of in vindication from lord hannity but
[1:46:46.960 --> 1:46:50.440]  that's not what we want what we want is people to step up and say no what we
[1:46:50.440 --> 1:46:54.680]  want is people to join an organization like campaign for liberty and become a
[1:46:54.680 --> 1:46:55.880]  city council member
[1:46:55.880 --> 1:46:57.320]  become the mayor of their town
[1:46:57.320 --> 1:46:58.840]  uh... become a congressman
[1:46:58.840 --> 1:47:00.760]  challenge these positions
[1:47:00.760 --> 1:47:04.720]  we can have a government foreign by the people if we act now
[1:47:04.720 --> 1:47:09.400]  if we decide now that we want to be proactive if we decide that this g twenty
[1:47:09.400 --> 1:47:12.640]  uh... communicate is not for us it doesn't benefit us
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:17.120]  if we decide that the give act was a bad idea if we expose what's in the give act
[1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:19.960]  we already exposed a bunch of what was in the give act bob and it seems like they
[1:47:19.960 --> 1:47:21.720]  pulled a lot of that legislation
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:25.640]  out and had to redistributed in other legislation like fourteen forty four
[1:47:25.640 --> 1:47:27.520]  but it got taken out of thirteen eighty eight
[1:47:27.520 --> 1:47:28.760]  uh... case in point
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:30.080]  uh... seventeen ten
[1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:33.640]  was the electronic citizen uh... verification i d act
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:36.000]  and they were going to use the department of education
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:39.600]  and this new corporation the national service corporation that the created in
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:40.160]  the bill
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:43.320]  to implement this so in other words it was going to be a real idea act
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:45.600]  for everybody in this country even children
[1:47:45.600 --> 1:47:47.960]  well last i checked my check that last night
[1:47:47.960 --> 1:47:50.920]  uh... the final version of that bill didn't have seventeen ten in it
[1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:53.000]  that they sneak it in somewhere else they may have
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:54.880]  but we caused enough of an uproar
[1:47:54.880 --> 1:47:59.080]  that it didn't make it there we can make a difference bob
[1:47:59.080 --> 1:48:02.040]  your influence counts you gotta use it
[1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:03.440]  and if you don't you don't
[1:48:03.440 --> 1:48:05.320]  died by attrition
[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:09.560]  i think people are serious i mean what do you think that might late age
[1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:13.120]  undoing twenty programs a week uh... you know all
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:16.360]  the other people over seventy three or either dead
[1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:19.720]  whether in a rocking chair watching television all day
[1:48:19.720 --> 1:48:24.040]  and uh... i understand what's going on and and i spend my time at it
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:25.400]  but that's why
[1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:27.200]  i mean i'm trying to help people
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:30.600]  and in alex is doing the same thing and so you
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:35.640]  you people got a response you you've got to do something to help yourself
[1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:37.720]  that's right and that's why you know one of the things that we're gonna be
[1:48:37.720 --> 1:48:41.080]  doing uh... this july fourth is info warrior independence day and no matter
[1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:41.920]  whether you're

[1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:50.560]  above if you're just an independent thinking we were encouraging people
[1:48:50.560 --> 1:48:53.160]  to go out to you know to these fireworks
[1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:55.320]  to these picnics to these community events

[1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:10.960]  but we may not have this next year and what is
[1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:13.200]  independence day if we can't keep
[1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:14.320]  what's left
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:18.680]  of our eviscerated bill of rights in comp and constitution i mean what is left
[1:49:18.680 --> 1:49:22.480]  in this country if we can't go out to other human being that they had this is
[1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:24.920]  what's important
[1:49:24.920 --> 1:49:28.920]  well you know uh... one of the things i came across in the last several weeks
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:30.160]  is
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:33.720]  more more people in the military are learning what's going on
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:37.200]  and i get three questions yesterday one of the programs
[1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:42.000]  decade is too military uh... both active as well as retired
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:43.360]  and they're saying g
[1:49:43.360 --> 1:49:46.040]  uh... i i really don't want to re-enlist
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:49.280]  uh... you know i like the army of the marines or whatever
[1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:53.480]  but i'd like to come out into civilian life but there's no job
[1:49:53.480 --> 1:49:54.800]  you know what am i to do
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:56.600]  i don't have any choice
[1:49:56.600 --> 1:49:58.340]  i got a re-enlist
[1:49:58.340 --> 1:50:01.680]  and probably get shipped over to afghanistan which i really don't want
[1:50:01.680 --> 1:50:02.360]  to do

[1:55:04.040 --> 1:55:08.280]  looming food shortages and at current economic downturn
[1:55:08.280 --> 1:55:11.720]  i mean just look at the economy folks it is imperative that you make sure that
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:16.040]  your family has non-gmo foods and they are prepared

[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:33.800]  golden silver they can they can do that through mitis resources
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:37.080]  and uh... you know others they can get your uh... newsletter but
[1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:40.600]  what else out there what what else should we be doing
[1:55:40.600 --> 1:55:45.400]  as soon as you get off the line i mean what can people do today
[1:55:45.400 --> 1:55:49.240]  well i think what they cover those bases i think what they have to do
[1:55:49.240 --> 1:55:53.320]  is get the word out and they can use the dvds and uh...
[1:55:53.320 --> 1:55:56.440]  and any of the other information that you have available
[1:55:56.440 --> 1:55:59.480]  and uh... just keep on passing out be the
[1:55:59.480 --> 1:56:02.600]  uh... the the most aggressive pamphlet here and
[1:56:02.600 --> 1:56:08.840]  and the giver of dvds in the country and uh... people will respond because
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:12.280]  they're slipping deeper and deeper uh...
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:17.160]  into a mode where they're going to be very responsive because they're losing
[1:56:17.160 --> 1:56:21.000]  their jobs can't buy a new car uh...
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:26.600]  they may be losing their home or already have done so
[1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:30.200]  and uh... i mean you saw the outpouring of people
[1:56:30.200 --> 1:56:33.880]  hundreds of thousands of people in england uh... protesting
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:39.240]  about the bank and and the situation there are a populist uprising and we
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:42.520]  need that in america we needed all over the country
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:47.000]  and we need to at the very very local levels elect people who understand
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:50.760]  what the problem is i couldn't agree with you more and
[1:56:50.760 --> 1:56:54.440]  you know the reason that martin luther king jr was so successful
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:58.520]  is that he got out in the streets and went to the people and we haven't really
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:02.760]  been able to do that as a movement and we constantly get co-opted
[1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:05.400]  but it doesn't take you know
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:08.760]  you know twenty people a hundred people a thousand people ten thousand people
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:12.120]  to make a difference you know you and your girlfriend can go out there you
[1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:15.560]  and your best buddy can go out there two people one person
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:19.480]  a huge sign i know people that make you know take a sheet and spray paint a
[1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:22.920]  website over on it and go over an overpass and they
[1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:26.920]  reach thousands of people every ten minutes on a on a busy highway
[1:57:26.920 --> 1:57:30.600]  i mean there are a million ways to do this you know you can sit in
[1:57:30.600 --> 1:57:34.440]  your mall parking lot and talk to people you can go to your local church and talk
[1:57:34.440 --> 1:57:36.360]  to people i mean
[1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:40.280]  the ways to do this are endless as soon as you have the willpower to do so as
[1:57:40.280 --> 1:57:44.120]  soon as you have identified the enemy and the enemy are these globalists
[1:57:44.120 --> 1:57:48.200]  that are literally colluding now out in the open
[1:57:48.200 --> 1:57:52.680]  to take away our sovereignty and to bring in global governance bob

[1:57:56.600 --> 1:57:59.640]  uh... was uh... a launching of two things
[1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:02.920]  toward world government and also telling america
[1:58:02.920 --> 1:58:07.240]  it's time for them to take an equal back feet they're not going to be the leader

[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:11.000]  there'll be no more corn growing it will
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:15.720]  not doing it is suicide just like dropping bombs on each other nuclear
[2:03:15.720 --> 2:03:18.760]  weapons is suicide so we've got to stop doing the two
[2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:22.280]  suicidal things which are hanging onto our nuclear
[2:03:22.280 --> 2:03:25.000]  weapons and global and then after that we've got to
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:29.320]  we've got to stabilize the population when i was born so what's wrong with

[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:41.320]  using less stuff we don't get global warming and the

[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:17.640]  people who have lost their jobs because we no longer have economies that
[2:04:17.640 --> 2:04:21.480]  create anything we'll have to go to these jobs
[2:04:21.480 --> 2:04:27.720]  and they're not going to be good jobs i mean if we if we're going to be judged

[2:09:39.320 --> 2:09:43.320]  good uh... you guys just talking about like what people can do
[2:09:43.320 --> 2:09:46.920]  mm-hmm um you know besides like spreading the word
[2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:50.920]  waking people up um do you think that it would be
[2:09:50.920 --> 2:09:54.040]  a good idea to write our congresspeople and the senate
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:09:57.560]  and let them know where we stand and that we're fully aware of the
[2:09:57.560 --> 2:10:01.560]  plans i think it's good to have an order or what
[2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:05.160]  well i think that it's always good to have a coordinated effort it doesn't hurt
[2:10:05.160 --> 2:10:08.360]  to call these organizations uh... you know you call your local congressman
[2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:11.160]  one of my friends is big into that he's been doing it for years and let them
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:16.040]  know i mean that is an effective way but i find that if you can find a uh...
[2:10:16.040 --> 2:10:19.880]  a common letter that you and others can write up and agree upon
[2:10:19.880 --> 2:10:23.480]  and they get you know hundreds or thousands of these faxes a day signed
[2:10:23.480 --> 2:10:26.520]  by different people i think that that's the most effective
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:29.880]  but really i mean it it's almost beyond that i mean we all know that the
[2:10:29.880 --> 2:10:33.880]  majority of our congress and senate are bought and paid for by these are you
[2:10:33.880 --> 2:10:36.920]  know these lobbyists and uh... special interest groups
[2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:39.880]  so that you know they don't care i mean they they should be screaming bloody
[2:10:39.880 --> 2:10:41.400]  murder right now net
[2:10:41.400 --> 2:10:45.880]  well ron paul i mean you know we got him in there and there's a couple others
[2:10:45.880 --> 2:10:50.440]  sanders and i think i see the guy's name yeah because they're right and uh...
[2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:54.280]  ron paul are about the uh... only ones out there currently in the congress that
[2:10:54.280 --> 2:10:55.880]  are saying anything
[2:10:55.880 --> 2:10:59.240]  and what sanders is senator by the way i shouldn't say he's in the congress he's
[2:10:59.240 --> 2:11:03.800]  not but yeah i mean yeah we we just need to step up and mobilize man i mean we
[2:11:03.800 --> 2:11:07.560]  have first of all we have to say that we're even even if they tell us to do
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:10.760]  something we're not going to do it i think there's going to be a big test
[2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:14.520]  on nine eleven this year now that give acts passed and it's officially a
[2:11:14.520 --> 2:11:19.000]  holiday it's a national day of service and remembrance and this is going to be

[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:26.680]  is going to have memorials around the country for nine eleven you know for
[2:11:26.680 --> 2:11:30.120]  further politicizing this program and then they're also going to be going
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:33.800]  uh... doing knocking talks and trying to recruit people people have to say no
[2:11:33.800 --> 2:11:37.000]  and we have to have counter demonstrations exposing people to the
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:40.760]  truth about nine eleven and the truth of what they're taking part of in this
[2:11:40.760 --> 2:11:41.720]  national
[2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:45.080]  uh... service corps which is just it it's scary man

[2:11:51.160 --> 2:11:54.920]  uh... jason thanks for taking my call you got a lot of follow-up on your last
[2:11:54.920 --> 2:11:57.080]  caller
[2:11:57.080 --> 2:11:59.960]  what we do that work my
[2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:03.640]  i think the front lines are at the individual state capitals
[2:12:03.640 --> 2:12:07.960]  and many states here fifty states uh... the tenth amendment
[2:12:07.960 --> 2:12:11.640]  resolutions that have been addressed are submitted in the many states we need
[2:12:11.640 --> 2:12:14.360]  to people need to go to the capital
[2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:17.960]  and thank the sponsors of the bills talk to the people
[2:12:17.960 --> 2:12:21.720]  uh... suggest that the representatives
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:24.920]  reach out to the to the county sheriffs and their
[2:12:24.920 --> 2:12:29.400]  in their district and get them involved in this
[2:12:29.400 --> 2:12:35.080]  and uh... just you know stay on that we need to keep this up front
[2:12:35.080 --> 2:12:38.280]  the many info warriors need to do that go to the go to the capitals the people
[2:12:38.280 --> 2:12:41.320]  that live in the in the in the state capitals of their state
[2:12:41.320 --> 2:12:45.560]  should go to their capital and and don't be afraid to approach these people
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:49.160]  because they're approachable and i think that another thing that we have to do
[2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:52.600]  is take advantage of you know some of these pseudo tea parties are putting
[2:12:52.600 --> 2:12:55.400]  together you know it's not just about going after glenn back in his nine
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:12:58.600]  twelve project on april fifteenth in san antonio
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:03.000]  it's about showing the people the civilian inmate labor program documents
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:06.440]  it's about showing the people these mass graves it's about showing the people
[2:13:06.440 --> 2:13:10.040]  that he's being dishonest and disingenuous and this is what's really
[2:13:10.040 --> 2:13:12.680]  going on and he doesn't want to have an open debate
[2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:16.680]  he just wants to have people quote unquote debunk conspiracy theories he's
[2:13:16.680 --> 2:13:18.520]  not genuine at all
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:22.120]  i agree uh... here in austin at the rotunda
[2:13:22.120 --> 2:13:26.120]  on the floor of the capital right there in the center of the rotunda it says
[2:13:26.120 --> 2:13:30.520]  the republic of texas you know i mean it's already there in stone
[2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:33.880]  and uh... you know i think if we stay on these people
[2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:37.640]  and go to the cosponsors also the bill you know here in texas i think there's
[2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:40.440]  like thirty thirty or thirty five cosponsors
[2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:44.200]  and just go and thank them and and have them reach out to their sheriffs and
[2:13:44.200 --> 2:13:45.720]  their districts and more
[2:13:45.720 --> 2:13:49.080]  i mean the county sheriffs is is you know in the individual counties is where
[2:13:49.080 --> 2:13:52.920]  we're going to get the power at and if we get the sheriffs involved in this
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:57.080]  i think that we can can uh... can push these things through
[2:13:57.080 --> 2:14:00.360]  well sheriff is usually an electable office this is another example of how
[2:14:00.360 --> 2:14:03.560]  you can take back your government for and by the people it's not just about
[2:14:03.560 --> 2:14:07.560]  running for congress or state senator or city council member run for sheriff
[2:14:07.560 --> 2:14:09.560]  i mean there's a yeah go ahead
[2:14:09.560 --> 2:14:11.400]  they're sovereign you know i mean they're
[2:14:11.400 --> 2:14:15.800]  they have uh... they have power over the uh... over the feds i mean they
[2:14:15.800 --> 2:14:19.320]  you know they can kick them out of it you know the county not let them in
[2:14:19.320 --> 2:14:23.800]  and i just think that we really you know we just can't say now that these
[2:14:23.800 --> 2:14:27.000]  these bills and these are resolutions have been introduced in these many states
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:30.680]  we just can't sit back and let them you know just let them sit there and pass
[2:14:30.680 --> 2:14:33.960]  through we got to get in there and show the show those representatives that
[2:14:33.960 --> 2:14:36.760]  they have have a lot of people behind michael we definitely have to be more
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:39.240]  proactive and show initiative i thank you for the call

[2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:02.680]  need an extra guy in the ground over there
[2:15:02.680 --> 2:15:07.480]  i mean i'd work for free i mean i i'm the wrong guy to be talking to about it
[2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:10.520]  because i'm not uh... i'm not the one that coordinates uh... you know where
[2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:13.400]  you would send the videos and whatnot but if you're close to sacramento you
[2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:15.080]  want to do some reconnaissance work
[2:15:15.080 --> 2:15:19.480]  over on uh... you know uh... the ten cities and what's going on down there
[2:15:19.480 --> 2:15:22.920]  i would contact rob d at info wars dot com
[2:15:22.920 --> 2:15:25.880]  just go shoot it anyway i mean if it's good will use it that's
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:29.480]  that's basically what we do and not only do we come over youtube and whatnot
[2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:33.000]  to see what's out there but uh... some people will have already done it and
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.880]  send us i mean we can't report on everything we can't take everything
[2:15:35.880 --> 2:15:39.240]  but we do encourage people to become their own info warriors and
[2:15:39.240 --> 2:15:43.400]  you know do real journalism aid by by taking a camera
[2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:47.240]  going and documenting the event and then getting the people that it's
[2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:49.880]  affecting opinions you know the people are actually in there
[2:15:49.880 --> 2:15:53.000]  that's more journalism than ninety percent of the mainstream media is gonna
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:56.680]  gonna do anyway so you know we encourage that type of behavior whether or not
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:16:00.120]  you know we will definitely use it or i can coordinate i can't
[2:16:00.120 --> 2:16:03.160]  rob d at info wars dot com martin i thank you for the call
[2:16:03.160 --> 2:16:05.960]  all right let's jump to our next caller let's go to
[2:16:05.960 --> 2:16:09.000]  uh... denise in illinois you're up
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:14.040]  hey jason how's it going good so here's what i'm calling about
[2:16:14.040 --> 2:16:18.200]  as an info warrior myself i've been using facebook
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:22.920]  to post as many things as i can possibly get my hands on from youtube from
[2:16:22.920 --> 2:16:26.840]  everywhere i've taken some things from alex
[2:16:26.840 --> 2:16:31.080]  um i put you know as much as i could i have about a hundred and thirty friends
[2:16:31.080 --> 2:16:36.360]  on my page do you know that about two of them
[2:16:36.360 --> 2:16:41.160]  have anything no any idea at all about what i'm talking about
[2:16:41.160 --> 2:16:43.960]  they don't believe in the nine eleven conspiracies
[2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:47.320]  which is actually not conspiracy it's the truth
[2:16:47.320 --> 2:16:51.640]  they don't have any clue about so much because
[2:16:51.640 --> 2:16:54.760]  i think music has gotten in people's minds
[2:16:54.760 --> 2:16:58.840]  so much the television music the internet they're keeping themselves
[2:16:58.840 --> 2:17:03.640]  so preoccupied with absolutely everything but the truth
[2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:07.160]  because the truth is it's scary yeah it is scary you know
[2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:11.240]  but i've been doing this for i don't know
[2:17:11.240 --> 2:17:15.160]  ten eleven twelve years of looking up stuff because
[2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:19.720]  when i was little i remember some very odd things
[2:17:19.720 --> 2:17:24.840]  you know from my childhood so i asked a man in my later years
[2:17:24.840 --> 2:17:29.400]  what the scars on my arms were and what what all these different marks on my
[2:17:29.400 --> 2:17:32.360]  body are and he gave me a book called the biggest
[2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:37.240]  conspiracy theory reader well just yesterday or the day
[2:17:37.240 --> 2:17:41.560]  before on my facebook page i posted an mk ultra cia
[2:17:41.560 --> 2:17:46.760]  uh video post and today facebook has sent me a message saying that if i continue
[2:17:46.760 --> 2:17:50.680]  to post my page will be canceled
[2:17:50.680 --> 2:17:54.920]  well that is just terrible i don't yes i mean it just illustrates the fact that
[2:17:54.920 --> 2:17:57.720]  you know they're trying to censor the internet and for those that don't know
[2:17:57.720 --> 2:18:00.120]  what uh... mk ultra is i think for the called me
[2:18:00.120 --> 2:18:04.520]  this is the mind control ultra program that was semi declassified
[2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:08.840]  uh... during the seventies you can read a lot of them on pdf files a lot of those
[2:18:08.840 --> 2:18:14.200]  uh... files were destroyed but i mean it goes over everything from lsd to
[2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:17.080]  i mean i don't know how to describe it you know some people knew that they were
[2:18:17.080 --> 2:18:19.800]  going to be subjected to experiments some people didn't
[2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:24.360]  it's not only about lsd it's it's really about controlling the masses about
[2:18:24.360 --> 2:18:27.400]  psychological warfare it's about one of those nexus points
[2:18:27.400 --> 2:18:31.480]  that we talked about earlier remember if i were doing a class on new world order
[2:18:31.480 --> 2:18:34.520]  101 you know the three main subjects would be
[2:18:34.520 --> 2:18:37.720]  you know the monetary system perpetual debt the federal reserve things that are
[2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:41.240]  going on there uh... the eugenics programs what's in the vaccinations the
[2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:44.680]  foods how they're dumbing us down the third of course would be false flag
[2:18:44.680 --> 2:18:47.160]  terror and you know the hegellian dialectic problem
[2:18:47.160 --> 2:18:49.640]  right reaction solution and how they
[2:18:49.640 --> 2:18:53.320]  motivate populations in their three main modus operandi are
[2:18:53.320 --> 2:18:57.640]  you know think tanks lobbyist groups of foundations things like the cfr the
[2:18:57.640 --> 2:19:00.760]  billderberg group those types of things and then you have your government
[2:19:00.760 --> 2:19:03.800]  organizations the nsa the cia the fb i
[2:19:03.800 --> 2:19:06.920]  uh... you know uh... continuity government the shadow government that's out
[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:10.280]  there and of course the psyops psychological warfare it's not a
[2:19:10.280 --> 2:19:13.800]  mistake that they found members of the cia
[2:19:13.800 --> 2:19:19.000]  in uh... the newsrooms of cnn most of your news is

[2:25:28.920 --> 2:25:36.520]  hello yes sir how you doing jason good good listen i have an idea
[2:25:36.520 --> 2:25:40.040]  that was sparked this morning by an article that i read in the
[2:25:40.040 --> 2:25:44.360]  Forbes magazine okay about some about some
[2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:49.320]  preparations who are watching the uh... a couple of uh...
[2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:53.240]  cases that have to do with the recall
[2:25:53.240 --> 2:25:58.360]  uh... all what it's not a recall law basically iraq
[2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:01.480]  loss yeah yeah they're yeah i don't think i have a mob for
[2:26:01.480 --> 2:26:05.080]  it's but it's basically racketeering and collusion it's what they usually go
[2:26:05.080 --> 2:26:08.760]  after uh... mob bosses foreign crime syndicates but the truth is that the
[2:26:08.760 --> 2:26:12.760]  real criminal cartel is the banking system
[2:26:12.760 --> 2:26:16.760]  that's true and i apologize but i guess i'll tell him that when i get on here
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:20.920]  it seems like i can't think fast enough take what i need to say that anyway
[2:26:20.920 --> 2:26:27.480]  long story short cut to the chase what what it hit me was that
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:33.080]  why we i mean we're desperate for a place to start to stop these people
[2:26:33.080 --> 2:26:36.600]  desperate and and what what hit me was well
[2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:40.840]  you know i i happen to think that why couldn't we go in
[2:26:40.840 --> 2:26:46.280]  uh... with a probably the biggest best super team of
[2:26:46.280 --> 2:26:51.240]  lawyers ever assembled take all these people
[2:26:51.240 --> 2:26:55.160]  that have lost their life savings in their 401k's
[2:26:55.160 --> 2:26:58.280]  and stuff like that and do a class action lawsuit
[2:26:58.280 --> 2:27:02.120]  well let's just look at that on its face though all class action lawsuits of
[2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:05.480]  any kind of like real financial stability years and years and years
[2:27:05.480 --> 2:27:08.440]  and we don't got years and years and years they're literally they literally
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:12.120]  announced the new world order yesterday they announced that they're no longer
[2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:13.000]  going to have
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:16.760]  these uh... trade barriers they announced they were going to go after
[2:27:16.760 --> 2:27:20.440]  third world countries that weren't in on the game i mean this is it man
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:23.000]  i mean they announced three weeks ago that they were going to print up a
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:25.640]  global super currency for quantitative easing
[2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:29.880]  and this is the establishment of it right here so even if we sue these guys
[2:27:29.880 --> 2:27:33.400]  but first of all it looks like they're putting us under an international court
[2:27:33.400 --> 2:27:37.880]  system what we need to do is we need to say we need to put in a
[2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:41.720]  instead of a civil court we need to file legislation that we're not going to
[2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:45.800]  take part in this for instance there's a woman out of a minnesota congresswoman
[2:27:45.800 --> 2:27:51.560]  who has filed a bill that says that uh... the u.s cannot drop the dollar as the
[2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:55.160]  world currency she's against the global currency it's it's basically a bill
[2:27:55.160 --> 2:27:58.280]  ensuring that the global currency doesn't come here or at least to the state of
[2:27:58.280 --> 2:28:02.040]  minnesota will it get passed probably not has gotten any immediate tension no
[2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:05.960]  but it's a step forward i just think that uh... civil cases probably aren't the
[2:28:05.960 --> 2:28:09.640]  way to go i'm not discouraging people from trying something like that but i
[2:28:09.640 --> 2:28:13.480]  feel like legislation is the better way i think for the call danny
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:18.760]  all right let's go to michael in toronto michael you're on the air
[2:28:18.760 --> 2:28:20.120]  yes sir

[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:27.160]  don't show i've uh... you know the videos uh...
[2:28:27.160 --> 2:28:30.360]  you know very very very much uh... interested in everything you have to
[2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:33.560]  say uh... i'm a canadian and uh...
[2:28:33.560 --> 2:28:36.520]  there's some uh... substantial differences between uh... the u.s.
[2:28:36.520 --> 2:28:39.080]  system the canadian system and we've been uh...
[2:28:39.080 --> 2:28:43.240]  largely socialist up here for a long uh... period of time and uh...
[2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:46.680]  have a national health care and uh... you know been uh...
[2:28:46.680 --> 2:28:50.360]  supported by our government and uh... just have a couple questions about the
[2:28:50.360 --> 2:28:55.000]  differences and then uh... hope that the canadians are getting a bad rap here
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:56.760]  uh...
[2:28:56.760 --> 2:28:58.440]  our economy is great
[2:28:58.440 --> 2:28:59.640]  uh... in comparison
[2:28:59.640 --> 2:29:01.960]  uh... to the u.s. i mean we've got uh...
[2:29:01.960 --> 2:29:06.760]  uh... fairly uh... stable uh... real estate market uh... you know the
[2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:09.560]  banking market none of our banks have gone south
[2:29:09.560 --> 2:29:13.800]  uh... and i i'm just curious i've been part of the reason is that um... i've
[2:29:13.800 --> 2:29:17.320]  spent uh... that good portion of my life supporting globalism
[2:29:17.320 --> 2:29:21.560]  uh... in my job uh... i'm one of those guys who uh... when you call your bank
[2:29:21.560 --> 2:29:25.160]  and uh... somebody in india answers is probably my fault

[2:29:29.880 --> 2:29:33.000]  i want to get your perspective on why you you are pro-globalism

[2:33:35.640 --> 2:33:41.560]  central time here at prismplanet.tv and info wars.com
[2:33:41.560 --> 2:33:44.760]  michael you're saying you know you were the guy at at the bank that sent you
[2:33:44.760 --> 2:33:49.480]  overseas to somebody else and uh... you were pro globalism money expand on that
[2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:54.760]  well not precisely um... i'm part of a consulting group that um
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:33:59.480]  essentially looks at uh... jobs in the u.s and canada
[2:33:59.480 --> 2:34:02.520]  uh... that uh... are typically unwanted
[2:34:02.520 --> 2:34:08.760]  uh... and uh... economically not viable uh... for most people in this country
[2:34:08.760 --> 2:34:13.560]  and uh... you know we look at options for corporations to uh... be able to uh...
[2:34:13.560 --> 2:34:17.640]  final alternative for shareholders uh... in order to uh... reduce costs and
[2:34:17.640 --> 2:34:21.960]  hopefully pass some of those uh... savings on to uh... consumers in america
[2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:25.800]  uh... main street um... this has been going on for a long time
[2:34:25.800 --> 2:34:29.240]  and um... i'm not uh... you know uh...
[2:34:29.240 --> 2:34:34.200]  uh... how should i say being uh... uh... that uh... you're critical of
[2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:38.120]  of of the globalization issue i i do understand that there needs to be certain
[2:34:38.120 --> 2:34:41.240]  people in charge of it but but my point is that
[2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:45.160]  globalization in itself is not a bad idea
[2:34:45.160 --> 2:34:48.280]  um... the people who are in charge of it in their intent
[2:34:48.280 --> 2:34:54.200]  absolutely can influence the outcome of that and um... but but by fear of uh...
[2:34:54.200 --> 2:34:58.280]  you know some of the um... the rhetoric that that goes on on the internet
[2:34:58.280 --> 2:35:01.160]  uh... and elsewhere about globalization
[2:35:01.160 --> 2:35:05.080]  um... it's actually going to you know take away from the benefits of it
[2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:08.600]  i i i have what are the benefits of it that's why i want to benefit other than
[2:35:08.600 --> 2:35:12.600]  other than a really really simple other than sharing information
[2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:15.960]  you know you know openly and freely sharing information
[2:35:15.960 --> 2:35:18.840]  i feel like you know obviously there are certain things that you'll have to
[2:35:18.840 --> 2:35:22.200]  import or export from places because you just can't get anywhere else
[2:35:22.200 --> 2:35:26.200]  but it seems like you can almost build uh... infrastructure
[2:35:26.200 --> 2:35:29.080]  anywhere within countries but good
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:32.840]  yeah no no i i totally agree and i i i i i think the issue is when you take a
[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:35.480]  look at war and you take a look at the things we've been fighting over for
[2:35:35.480 --> 2:35:37.400]  uh... you know centuries
[2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:41.480]  um... which uh... involve territory um...
[2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:46.120]  uh... that uh... whole bunch of stuff it's all been about um...
[2:35:46.120 --> 2:35:50.120]  people living it's been about people being able to uh... say hey i can go to
[2:35:50.120 --> 2:35:54.200]  the store i can buy stuff i have some kind of capital or some kind of currency
[2:35:54.200 --> 2:35:57.080]  that i can go and do stuff with and i i agree that there's issues with the
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:35:59.880]  currency in the way that it's controlled but at the end of the day
[2:35:59.880 --> 2:36:04.280]  cooperation amongst people is critical
[2:36:04.280 --> 2:36:08.360]  for the world and and that this is that uh... delineator
[2:36:08.360 --> 2:36:12.120]  that i see between the the truth movement and
[2:36:12.120 --> 2:36:15.640]  you know the powers that be which probably are quite
[2:36:15.640 --> 2:36:18.920]  evil and have a ill intent and i i don't deny that
[2:36:18.920 --> 2:36:23.720]  uh... what i'm saying is unless uh... people on the right side of the movement
[2:36:23.720 --> 2:36:27.400]  uh... decide that they're going to embrace globalism in the right
[2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:33.080]  fashion um... which includes countries includes people includes cultures
[2:36:33.080 --> 2:36:36.280]  um... outside of the typical um...
[2:36:36.280 --> 2:36:40.120]  way that we've been accustomed to then we're in bigger trouble
[2:36:40.120 --> 2:36:43.480]  than you know we are with these uh... guys the top
[2:36:43.480 --> 2:36:45.960]  uh... i would say this i don't think there's any way we're going to be in
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:49.080]  any uh... bigger trouble than where we are with the guys at the top i think
[2:36:49.080 --> 2:36:52.600]  that we should have understanding and communications with all other nations
[2:36:52.600 --> 2:36:56.760]  uh... but i i take a ron paul stance i don't necessarily think that globalism
[2:36:56.760 --> 2:37:00.920]  is the answer it seems like globalism is these people's wet dream
[2:37:00.920 --> 2:37:04.120]  and these are the people that are in the builder group these are the people that
[2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:07.720]  go to the bohemian grove club these are the people that unfortunately in some
[2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:11.400]  cases are not only a cultic but luciferian and really do believe in
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:15.080]  do is thou wilt these are the ones that are putting in these eugenics programs
[2:37:15.080 --> 2:37:19.160]  is the reason that you know there's bird flu in the bird flu vaccines this is
[2:37:19.160 --> 2:37:23.240]  the reason that people were given aids in this country and yours through factor
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:26.440]  eight injections from bear and nothing is done
[2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:29.560]  it's because when you listen to somebody who's not even at the top like ted
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:32.200]  turner talking about a sustainable community and globalism
[2:37:32.200 --> 2:37:35.800]  it means killing a bunch of us i thank you for the call that's my biggest fears
[2:37:35.800 --> 2:37:40.440]  that this eugenics and the sustainability is in part with globalism
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:44.760]  listen up am i against building a more global internet
[2:37:44.760 --> 2:37:48.680]  not as long as it's free you know i i would love to have more communications
[2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:51.560]  with people overseas you know a decoder or
[2:37:51.560 --> 2:37:54.840]  you know a language translator you know not have to use rosetta stone to
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:37:58.120]  understand everything i would love all that stuff but is it plausible
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:38:02.680]  and when you see what their steps are just like uh... you know zeitgeist uh...
[2:38:02.680 --> 2:38:05.960]  in the second half of that he's talking about all these great technologies that
[2:38:05.960 --> 2:38:10.440]  do exist you know when solar electromagnetics all
[2:38:10.440 --> 2:38:14.840]  that stuff's real but the elite aren't going to give it to us in mass
[2:38:14.840 --> 2:38:18.120]  until they can control it and make a profit on it
[2:38:18.120 --> 2:38:21.640]  and really have consolidated their power in such a way that there are less of us
[2:38:21.640 --> 2:38:24.680]  to consume that stuff because they don't want challenges to their power
[2:38:24.680 --> 2:38:28.920]  i mean on the surface addendum looks like this one world society we're all
[2:38:28.920 --> 2:38:30.680]  gonna love each other but when you start getting into it
[2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:34.840]  they want a one-world hive mind watch the worldwide mind at a pbs it gives you a
[2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:38.920]  good idea of what they want there you know all this with a brain trip
[2:38:38.920 --> 2:38:43.160]  uh... you know in cyberspace communicating each other telepathically
[2:38:43.160 --> 2:38:47.320]  i mean this is really what they discuss and if you think that's going to be for
[2:38:47.320 --> 2:38:51.160]  the general populace because they want they love us so much it's not
[2:38:51.160 --> 2:38:54.600]  you know they want to offer us this utopia globalism it's not what they have in
[2:38:54.600 --> 2:38:57.640]  mind for us and you know what they do have in mind for us this story's over at
[2:38:57.640 --> 2:39:00.520]  prismplanet dot com info wars dot com
[2:39:00.520 --> 2:39:04.120]  almost forgot to talk about this is a document out of new york state
[2:39:04.120 --> 2:39:07.960]  nonetheless said all this stuff out of new york uh... april fourth two thousand
[2:39:07.960 --> 2:39:11.640]  and seven so this document's about two years old
[2:39:11.640 --> 2:39:15.240]  there in the process of updating and collecting some very important information
[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:20.040]  to our database regarding uh... bio attacks and massive disasters you see this
[2:39:20.040 --> 2:39:24.120]  is to cemeteries seeing if they can house a massive
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:27.720]  graves we're talking nine hundred and fifty people per acre
[2:39:27.720 --> 2:39:30.840]  let me repeat that nine hundred and fifty dead bodies
[2:39:30.840 --> 2:39:34.920]  per acre and they're talking about thousands and thousands of acres and
[2:39:34.920 --> 2:39:37.400]  they want to know whether these cemeteries
[2:39:37.400 --> 2:39:41.400]  can hold all these people why are they getting ready for mass death
[2:39:41.400 --> 2:39:45.080]  if they don't have it in mind for us i don't think they're killing themselves
[2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:47.640]  all these people that say there are too many people in the world right here
[2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:51.480]  look this is that uh... clinton uh... administration official
[2:39:51.480 --> 2:39:56.440]  someone under hillary right here earth's population already exceeds limits
[2:39:56.440 --> 2:40:00.920]  all all and and the reason we have all this global warming too many people
[2:40:00.920 --> 2:40:04.600]  doing too much stuff according to ted turner return to camels eight
[2:40:04.600 --> 2:40:08.680]  eight degrees hotter no crops nuclear war
[2:40:08.680 --> 2:40:13.480]  ridiculous it's all an excuse to bring in this globalist agenda
[2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:18.920]  all right let's go to our next caller let's go to david in indiana david you're on the line
[2:40:18.920 --> 2:40:23.320]  yellow hello yes sir
[2:40:23.320 --> 2:40:26.680]  yeah i've been an info warrior now for about twelve years
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:30.600]  and uh... the first film i've seen twelve years ago was by david wagner
[2:40:30.600 --> 2:40:36.680]  hold bar barbed wire over america and basically uh... that's when i realized
[2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:39.960]  that everything that i've been taught in public school
[2:40:39.960 --> 2:40:46.360]  and everything that uh... i've had is my belief system was basically false
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:50.120]  and that public schools nothing but an instrument of mind control
[2:40:50.120 --> 2:40:55.240]  into a brainwash young people and uh... that's what
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:40:58.360]  obama he's going to use that uh... national service
[2:40:58.360 --> 2:41:01.720]  just like hitler did he's going to use that uh...
[2:41:01.720 --> 2:41:04.840]  like that like use it of the same way hitler did
[2:41:04.840 --> 2:41:08.920]  and uh... basically have a hitler youth or i totally agree with you and i think
[2:41:08.920 --> 2:41:10.840]  that you people need to understand this
[2:41:10.840 --> 2:41:15.240]  you know whereas in george bush and his administration when they want to people
[2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:18.280]  to get behind them they didn't use bush as an image they use the flag
[2:41:18.280 --> 2:41:21.800]  after nine eleven and everybody you know saw the red white and blue all over
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:23.880]  and that was their symbol what's really scary
[2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:27.080]  is with this guy with obama it's not the flag they're using
[2:41:27.080 --> 2:41:31.560]  it's the obama logo it's his face it's his swagger it's his attitude
[2:41:31.560 --> 2:41:37.080]  it's literally a youth that is being indoctrinated not into an idea but into
[2:41:37.080 --> 2:41:40.920]  a person and i i can't agree with you more that you know these schools are
[2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:43.800]  nothing but indoctrination centers and it is a real big
[2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:47.640]  kick to the chest it knocks the wind out of you when you start to realize
[2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:52.040]  how much brainwashing has gone in your honor has gone on in your individual
[2:41:52.040 --> 2:41:53.400]  life
[2:41:53.400 --> 2:41:56.360]  yeah obama he's nothing but a demagogue he's
[2:41:56.360 --> 2:42:00.280]  parade around like he's the champion of the common people the middle class
[2:42:00.280 --> 2:42:04.040]  and he's just another agent of the new world order he's finishing
[2:42:04.040 --> 2:42:07.320]  the job that george w bush didn't finish
[2:42:07.320 --> 2:42:10.760]  he's given this economy the final show over the cliff
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:14.440]  so they can starve us into submission because what they're going to do in
[2:42:14.440 --> 2:42:17.400]  this country they're going to try to starve us into submission
[2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:21.960]  with fear and with a bad economics and all them tactics to
[2:42:21.960 --> 2:42:25.480]  get us to go along with their program well they're offering um and i thank you
[2:42:25.480 --> 2:42:28.920]  for the call they're offering full-time service through this give act for those
[2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:31.000]  people who don't have jobs that want to join
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:33.720]  so this is going to be the new jobs you know it's not just the department of
[2:42:33.720 --> 2:42:36.600]  homeland security that's going to expand it's not just the youth core
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:40.920]  it's these jobs for national service
[2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:45.400]  full-time volunteerism well you can't be a full-time volunteer without some kind
[2:42:45.400 --> 2:42:48.680]  of an income so obviously this isn't really going to be volunteerism it's
[2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:53.240]  going to be new bureaucracies set up to worship this administration
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:55.720]  and it's all ideals i mean that's the bottom line
[2:42:55.720 --> 2:42:59.080]  all right let's jump to our next caller let's go to one in new york one you're
[2:42:59.080 --> 2:43:00.600]  on the line
[2:43:00.600 --> 2:43:04.200]  hey jason what's going on how you doing all right
[2:43:04.200 --> 2:43:09.400]  i mean i i i call because um you know i'm trying i'm trying to do uh the right
[2:43:09.400 --> 2:43:13.560]  thing here and disseminate information amongst the people that i know when
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:17.560]  and uh you know just the people at work and my family members
[2:43:17.560 --> 2:43:22.520]  it seems that you know the mainstream media has really got the people's minds
[2:43:22.520 --> 2:43:27.800]  in a stranglehold oh yeah when i talk to like an older individual
[2:43:27.800 --> 2:43:32.760]  at work tells me you know he's receptive to some of my ideas but then
[2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:37.480]  he reversed to the uh to the limbaugh line that it's all the the
[2:43:37.480 --> 2:43:42.600]  democrats doing this and i keep trying to uh come across the people by telling
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:45.480]  them they're both the same people you can't tell
[2:43:45.480 --> 2:43:50.360]  i mean uh i just need some i want to i just need some guidance
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:54.360]  you need some ammo for the info war right how do i break this left right
[2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:57.880]  paradigm how do i tell them that both the democrats and the republicans
[2:43:57.880 --> 2:44:01.160]  are controlled without them scoffing at me first of all you're probably at a
[2:44:01.160 --> 2:44:03.960]  disadvantage because you're a younger guy you sound like a younger guy
[2:44:03.960 --> 2:44:07.000]  and everybody who's older they already think they know it all they don't want
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:09.960]  some young punk telling them you know what's going on
[2:44:09.960 --> 2:44:13.960]  what i would do is you know start them in slow with uh the skull and bone
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:17.720]  society and uh the quotes from carry and bush maybe you throw them on your
[2:44:17.720 --> 2:44:20.440]  phone you know you got an iphone or even even a razor
[2:44:20.440 --> 2:44:23.720]  you can compress video and throw that on there you know throw on the fact that
[2:44:23.720 --> 2:44:27.960]  they both are in you know the cfr and admitting to that and both in skull and
[2:44:27.960 --> 2:44:31.800]  bones try to surpass it that way you know on top of that
[2:44:31.800 --> 2:44:35.800]  you try to explain to the guy that you know clinton was brought up by bush
[2:44:35.800 --> 2:44:39.880]  senior he ran cocaine form in the eighties through the iran contra scandal
[2:44:39.880 --> 2:44:43.000]  i mean you've got to break these barrier lines and i think that
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:47.080]  uh youtube videos and movies since nobody reads anymore
[2:44:47.080 --> 2:44:50.360]  really do speak the best language but if you're talking to some older people
[2:44:50.360 --> 2:44:54.280]  you know i just i don't have it here in front of me but there was this cfr
[2:44:54.280 --> 2:44:58.600]  document from may of 2008 laying out this entire plan for global
[2:44:58.600 --> 2:45:01.960]  governance basically all the economic stuff that just happened to the g20 and
[2:45:01.960 --> 2:45:05.000]  explain to him hey this is an organization of both sides
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:08.280]  they predicted this thing was going to happen they engineered it it's right
[2:45:08.280 --> 2:45:10.760]  here in black and white please take the time to read it
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:13.560]  you just got to be persistent not everybody's gonna turn around in a day
[2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:17.000]  or a week or a month or a year sometimes it takes a long time i thank you for
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:21.160]  the call one all right let's jump to chris in louisiana chris you're
[2:45:21.160 --> 2:45:25.800]  online hi how you doing good man

[2:45:30.440 --> 2:45:33.960]  in games in the obama deception recently uh-huh
[2:45:33.960 --> 2:45:38.280]  and uh they they really opened up my eyes to a lot of things that i see going on
[2:45:38.280 --> 2:45:45.480]  in uh the management of our natural resources here in south louisiana
[2:45:45.480 --> 2:45:49.160]  and uh i'm wondering like what is it that someone that
[2:45:49.160 --> 2:45:53.640]  this is south louisiana can do to curtail some of this uh
[2:45:53.640 --> 2:45:57.080]  raping of the environment well first of all you got to find out you know what
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:00.280]  what legislation has passed in your area you know in tennessee
[2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:04.280]  they're already putting in this uh two billion dollar carbon credit system
[2:46:04.280 --> 2:46:08.360]  uh because they believe the carbon credit is inevitable and uh we're gonna
[2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:10.200]  have it so you have to fight things like that
[2:46:10.200 --> 2:46:13.480]  you know when they're trying to uh tax you on the flatulence of
[2:46:13.480 --> 2:46:17.320]  your cattle or your livestock that's a big issue
[2:46:17.320 --> 2:46:20.600]  in a uh self-improvement parish here in uh

[2:46:24.840 --> 2:46:27.800]  people so you have to get a local representative somebody in your congress
[2:46:27.800 --> 2:46:31.640]  or state senate to propose some kind of legislation that's going to help you
[2:46:31.640 --> 2:46:34.120]  and then you have to publicize you have to get your neighbors on board yet to
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:37.640]  say look this is really what they're doing i mean they just put past another
[2:46:37.640 --> 2:46:42.440]  bill this big land grab act which was an amalgamation of a hundred and sixty
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:45.640]  other conservation bills in this g twenty communicate
[2:46:45.640 --> 2:46:49.400]  they openly state that climate change is irreversible
[2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:52.600]  and we're going to reach an agreement with the u n and they're going to
[2:46:52.600 --> 2:46:56.360]  control it all after two thousand and nine of uh and december
[2:46:56.360 --> 2:46:59.560]  so they're openly announcing it uh another another great way you know we

[2:47:35.400 --> 2:47:39.320]  get the magnitude of uh you know what these people are about to do
[2:47:39.320 --> 2:47:42.600]  i mean they want to kill eighty percent of us
[2:47:42.600 --> 2:47:46.520]  and you know this is no delusion nothing crazy i mean they've stated in their
[2:47:46.520 --> 2:47:49.640]  documents alexa said a million times you said a
[2:47:49.640 --> 2:47:52.760]  million times but people still don't get it
[2:47:52.760 --> 2:47:57.320]  i you know i mean we can play video clip after video clip all these people
[2:47:57.320 --> 2:48:00.040]  talking about a sustainable society talking about how there's
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:03.640]  too many people in the world already i don't know what doesn't click
[2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:10.200]  and look they they put aids in the factory they put uh cancer viruses sv
[2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:13.000]  40 in the polio vaccines they got caught
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:17.240]  57 to 62 some guy just won a 22.5 million dollar lawsuit
[2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:20.440]  after like 30 plus years from an oral polio vaccination
[2:48:20.440 --> 2:48:25.000]  where he lost his legs okay they're cutting the high fructose corn syrup
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:28.200]  which already causes diabetes and a host of other health issues
[2:48:28.200 --> 2:48:31.480]  including premature death in other words you're gonna die when you're 50 and
[2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:34.600]  60 years old you're not gonna listen live to this 70 or 80 year old mark that
[2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:38.280]  were were used to and they're cutting it with a poisonous
[2:48:38.280 --> 2:48:42.360]  heavy metal called mercury i don't know you got to be brain dead at the
[2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:45.480]  i mean i we almost had this argument with tarply at one point
[2:48:45.480 --> 2:48:49.000]  when he was here you know oh there's a there's a boogeyman behind every corner
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:54.280]  tarply i go listen tarply it's not a mistake that they send out a bird flu
[2:48:54.280 --> 2:48:59.720]  vaccination to 14 other nations and it's killing a ferret i'm like it's it's
[2:48:59.720 --> 2:49:04.200]  not a mistake that there are two live bird flu viruses and a third type of
[2:49:04.200 --> 2:49:07.160]  flu viruses like you just gotta go well yes there's probably something to that
[2:49:07.160 --> 2:49:09.720]  but this business about fluoride i'm like
[2:49:09.720 --> 2:49:13.960]  what do you mean this business about fluoride fluoride was used by the nazis
[2:49:13.960 --> 2:49:17.960]  tarply i mean oh there's a there's a boogeyman behind every corner i know
[2:49:17.960 --> 2:49:22.360]  jason no there is this is a eugenics program and the end game of their eugenics
[2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:27.480]  program is 80 percent of us could put gone dead we need to make people aware
[2:49:27.480 --> 2:49:31.640]  brad well jason um here's another point i'd like to make i i was living in uh
[2:49:31.640 --> 2:49:37.480]  hampton to hampshire and um right next to hampton is the seabrook power plant
[2:49:37.480 --> 2:49:40.600]  and every night all of a sudden i'd see a helicopter
[2:49:40.600 --> 2:49:44.280]  light flashing out on the edge of a place called boar's head
[2:49:44.280 --> 2:49:49.720]  they fire a flare they square around the flare a few times and then just take
[2:49:49.720 --> 2:49:53.800]  off and i saw this night after night after
[2:49:53.800 --> 2:49:58.360]  night for months and then maybe a year later i was driving through port smith
[2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:01.880]  at night with my girlfriend somebody actually saw it with me for once
[2:50:01.880 --> 2:50:05.560]  and um all of a sudden i see this helicopter light come on you know there
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:08.360]  was nothing in the sky and all of a sudden the flashing light and the red light
[2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:12.360]  come on they fire a flare and this was right over the uh old
[2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:18.040]  air force base that we had up here mm-hmm what do you suspect this is
[2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:21.960]  i don't know what they think they check in wind direction for a possible attack
[2:50:21.960 --> 2:50:26.760]  on the seabrook plant or um you know i i just think it's funny that they would
[2:50:26.760 --> 2:50:28.680]  do something like this near the seabrook plant
[2:50:28.680 --> 2:50:33.560]  mm-hmm well it sounds interesting you know that's usually the prevailing wind
[2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:36.840]  in the direction which they shot it from which is usually a southwest wind
[2:50:36.840 --> 2:50:40.440]  sweeping across that way brad i thank you for the call it's the alex

[2:54:46.120 --> 2:54:49.880]  it's about people like their hands turning yellow as they die and they
[2:54:49.880 --> 2:54:54.120]  cough things up and they realize that they've been poisoned by the eugenesis
[2:54:54.120 --> 2:54:57.240]  by the globalist that's what it's about
[2:54:57.240 --> 2:55:00.920]  i want to play this clip i'm coming up with the eight after break
[2:55:00.920 --> 2:55:05.000]  i do a little uh intro into it max keiser was on paris tv
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:07.640]  and it's a long clip we're probably gonna play the whole thing because
[2:55:07.640 --> 2:55:11.240]  everything he says is relative he not only brings up the controlled
[2:55:11.240 --> 2:55:16.840]  coup d'etat through the financial institutions that just happened but he
[2:55:16.840 --> 2:55:21.400]  relates it to 9 11 and the collapse of building seven twin towers
[2:55:21.400 --> 2:55:25.080]  he basically it's the controlled demolition coup d'etat and that article
[2:55:25.080 --> 2:55:29.640]  is over at the info warrior dot com we do about you know we do one or two blogs
[2:55:29.640 --> 2:55:30.760]  a day over there

[2:55:34.360 --> 2:55:37.880]  and he killed so much that we're gonna be having him on the jones show i believe
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:42.360]  on monday he'll be joining us and then he'll be on my program the info warrior
[2:55:42.360 --> 2:55:45.480]  uh... which is the nighttime program nine to twelve central

[2:55:55.240 --> 2:55:57.440]  and uh... max keiser's clip i mean
[2:55:57.440 --> 2:55:58.120]  folks
[2:55:58.120 --> 2:56:01.640]  he breaks it down so eloquently and what when i heard him
[2:56:01.640 --> 2:56:05.400]  say it was a controlled demolition coup d'etat i just could not he's like this
[2:56:05.400 --> 2:56:09.000]  is all being controlled i don't think you understand they're getting the dollar
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:11.320]  i don't want to do a bad impersonation of him but
[2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:12.760]  he's got that kind of a voice
[2:56:12.760 --> 2:56:16.840]  all right let's go to i believe we are on josh when california
[2:56:16.840 --> 2:56:18.360]  josh you're up
[2:56:18.360 --> 2:56:23.720]  oh hey jason wow i've been calling him for a while

[2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:28.120]  um...
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:31.320]  it's interesting like my uh... dad uh... roger
[2:56:31.320 --> 2:56:32.680]  uh... freedman was on the
[2:56:32.680 --> 2:56:36.680]  uh... braided plan uh... he wrote the brain trust for it he was like best
[2:56:36.680 --> 2:56:38.280]  friend to peter grace and
[2:56:38.280 --> 2:56:40.840]  one of the founders of the bill de berg group and um...
[2:56:40.840 --> 2:56:44.360]  ahead of the night to malta and um...
[2:56:44.360 --> 2:56:48.200]  i'd like a really well interesting child i'm not going to end all that but
[2:56:48.200 --> 2:56:51.880]  yeah i mean if you're talking about the eugenics and stuff is just crazy and i
[2:56:51.880 --> 2:56:53.960]  read the medical apartheid book and
[2:56:53.960 --> 2:56:56.840]  i'm i'm here in southern california and
[2:56:56.840 --> 2:57:00.280]  i listen to show every day because i have a home office
[2:57:00.280 --> 2:57:01.800]  and it's
[2:57:01.800 --> 2:57:05.240]  totally like you said i mean i'm up in the hills of california
[2:57:05.240 --> 2:57:09.640]  right above los angeles and i could see them come and do the spraying because
[2:57:09.640 --> 2:57:12.200]  the millet i know where the military bases it's off
[2:57:12.200 --> 2:57:13.640]  kind of like
[2:57:13.640 --> 2:57:17.480]  i don't want to say uh... to the west when you're talking about you're talking
[2:57:17.480 --> 2:57:20.840]  about chemtrails by the way we're gonna have rooselyn peterson of california
[2:57:20.840 --> 2:57:22.840]  skywatch dot org on shortly
[2:57:22.840 --> 2:57:25.720]  uh... we've had around a couple times in the program but she really goes over
[2:57:25.720 --> 2:57:29.320]  the issue of chemtrails i mean they're all over the place to say that chemtrails
[2:57:29.320 --> 2:57:30.280]  don't exist
[2:57:30.280 --> 2:57:34.600]  and that you know it's a figment of our imagination is is utterly ludicrous and
[2:57:34.600 --> 2:57:38.920]  quite frankly disgusting that humanity allows it to happen to to have us be
[2:57:38.920 --> 2:57:41.720]  ostracized and demonized for pointing out something that is
[2:57:41.720 --> 2:57:46.600]  so relatively easy to be seen in the skies as the planes put them up
[2:57:46.600 --> 2:57:50.920]  totally crazy like exactly so true i mean they
[2:57:50.920 --> 2:57:54.680]  you can't even get information on it i mean except for stuff that on
[2:57:54.680 --> 2:57:56.760]  you know with journalists you know
[2:57:56.760 --> 2:57:59.640]  hardcore journalists like yourself dig out and
[2:57:59.640 --> 2:58:02.920]  i mean this guy it's like perfectly clear every day and then
[2:58:02.920 --> 2:58:05.400]  it's just filled with tic tacs and you see them
[2:58:05.400 --> 2:58:09.560]  there's these weird satellites right uh satellite dishes right on like the five
[2:58:09.560 --> 2:58:11.960]  and uh... two ten highways
[2:58:11.960 --> 2:58:17.400]  and you'll see clouds in like totally strange geometrical sheets that are just
[2:58:17.400 --> 2:58:20.120]  unnatural like right by where the satellite
[2:58:20.120 --> 2:58:23.000]  uh... what you gotta wonder what they're doing i mean is that a part of heart
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:26.600]  i don't know i know they're spraying something in the air you can see it
[2:58:26.600 --> 2:58:30.600]  and it's got aluminum oxide and barium in it more heavy metals what is going on
[2:58:30.600 --> 2:58:34.840]  in this country what is going on in this world will be back after this

[3:00:18.520 --> 3:00:29.160]  all right folks well we've been covering this story since it broke
[3:00:29.160 --> 3:00:34.120]  i had my my cop buddy online uh over break and i talked to him and he was
[3:00:34.120 --> 3:00:37.800]  confirming four deaths to me and now uh cnn is
[3:00:37.800 --> 3:00:42.440]  reporting at least 12 dead uh cvs is saying 13 are dead
[3:00:42.440 --> 3:00:45.800]  i don't know if the gunman is still at large
[3:00:45.800 --> 3:00:50.600]  no the gunman is amongst the dead uh it looks like law enforcement uh
[3:00:50.600 --> 3:00:54.600]  law enforcement got to him but that's that's 13 confirmed dead right now
[3:00:54.600 --> 3:00:58.520]  after this hostage taking in
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:02.360]  first of all it scares me because it is very close to home where i am
[3:01:02.360 --> 3:01:06.440]  second of all it scares me for the implications of this and uh
[3:01:06.440 --> 3:01:10.280]  much more gun restriction i mean uh it's mainstream news now
[3:01:10.280 --> 3:01:14.040]  out of uh colorado and elsewhere we had a caller calling from organ yesterday
[3:01:14.040 --> 3:01:17.480]  that ammunition because people are worried
[3:01:17.480 --> 3:01:20.440]  because people see what's going on with the economic strife they're not sure
[3:01:20.440 --> 3:01:23.400]  if they're going to have a house if they're going to be dealt with fairly
[3:01:23.400 --> 3:01:27.800]  ammo has gone through the roof it's up to 300 percent in sales
[3:01:27.800 --> 3:01:31.080]  we did cover all those stories of all the firearms they sold it seems like the
[3:01:31.080 --> 3:01:34.040]  only small business owners in this country that are that are making any
[3:01:34.040 --> 3:01:39.160]  scratch at this point are the gun dealers and the ammo dealers
[3:01:39.160 --> 3:01:46.520]  and uh i would really hate for more regulations more restrictions
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:50.120]  to come on regular american citizens because of
[3:01:50.120 --> 3:01:54.520]  what some one person did i mean again we don't have all the facts on this
[3:01:54.520 --> 3:01:58.360]  i'm sure a lot of this will flesh out over the weekend
[3:01:58.360 --> 3:02:01.560]  and what you know Alex will probably be covering it
[3:02:01.560 --> 3:02:05.880]  on the sunday program all right let's continue to take your calls
[3:02:05.880 --> 3:02:10.280]  we are on uh paula in illinois paul you're on the line
[3:02:10.280 --> 3:02:14.120]  hello hey i listened to alex just about every day
[3:02:14.120 --> 3:02:17.240]  except for when he gets those right wing christians on it can't handle it
[3:02:17.240 --> 3:02:20.440]  but i have a little bit different perspective i was wanting to share with
[3:02:20.440 --> 3:02:24.280]  you okay go ahead i i think that we've had a
[3:02:24.280 --> 3:02:28.440]  uh a world order well we've had a world currency since the end of world war two
[3:02:28.440 --> 3:02:31.000]  with breton wood it's just as it's been the dollar
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:36.200]  well breton hold on breton woods because of the gold standard in 1972 they immediately
[3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:41.000]  aligned with the saudi arabia to have gold uh oil back that the dollar so
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:45.800]  this dollar has been the de facto world currency since 1945
[3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:49.400]  what i think we're seeing now is the other country's rebelling
[3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:54.360]  and the same with um the same with the the uh corporations ruling the world
[3:02:54.360 --> 3:02:58.040]  that's not new that's happened since 1945
[3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:02.600]  with imf and the world bank um coming in and ruling though
[3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:07.000]  the third world country for the benefit of the of of u.s capital and also
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:10.840]  international capital and what happened with the new world order that bush was
[3:03:10.840 --> 3:03:13.800]  talking about was when the soviet union was no longer around
[3:03:13.800 --> 3:03:18.040]  that the united states would then control the entire world both militarily
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:22.200]  economically in i think the new world order has been around for a long time
[3:03:22.200 --> 3:03:24.920]  is what i'm saying it's not that they're trying to put it in
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:28.920]  they've we've had it we've had it it's just that the as americans we have
[3:03:28.920 --> 3:03:31.960]  announcing it more you know what i mean i obviously it's
[3:03:31.960 --> 3:03:34.840]  obviously it's been in the works for over a hundred years you know we
[3:03:34.840 --> 3:03:38.600]  highlighted you know hitler's book hg wells's book all these institutions that
[3:03:38.600 --> 3:03:41.240]  you just talked about you know you didn't talk about some of the other ones
[3:03:41.240 --> 3:03:43.960]  like you know them trying to bring in the league of nations and then the
[3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:47.000]  council on foreign relations after that actually being brought in and of course
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:50.680]  the united nations you mentioned the breton woods institute see all this is
[3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:54.040]  being harmonized now and uh you said it was you know the other
[3:03:54.040 --> 3:03:56.520]  countries rebelling i don't see it that way i see that is
[3:03:56.520 --> 3:03:59.720]  uh a staged mechanism like sarcosis saying all
[3:03:59.720 --> 3:04:02.440]  you know we're not gonna get anything done i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:05.880]  conference right now and then he's smiling at the end now this is this is
[3:04:05.880 --> 3:04:10.920]  definitely though to shift gears away from the united states as being the
[3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:14.200]  dominant country it's about globalism in that respect i don't think it's
[3:04:14.200 --> 3:04:16.600]  anybody rebelling i think it's the fact that
[3:04:16.600 --> 3:04:20.360]  the united states as time has come and now we have to amalgamate it into the
[3:04:20.360 --> 3:04:24.680]  north american union to further this globalization process i think the new
[3:04:24.680 --> 3:04:27.480]  world order is an idea i think it's a process
[3:04:27.480 --> 3:04:31.640]  i think that when you have world leaders like gordon brown at the g20 summit
[3:04:31.640 --> 3:04:35.400]  actually announcing it however it's becoming more in the public eye
[3:04:35.400 --> 3:04:39.800]  and you may see it as an actual institution or government organization
[3:04:39.800 --> 3:04:42.440]  in the near future but have we been living under it your damn right we've
[3:04:42.440 --> 3:04:44.920]  been living up living under it for quite some time now

[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:29.480]  calls veronica john adam and mark but first i want to play this max
[3:08:29.480 --> 3:08:33.480]  keiser on paris tv clip folks he says it all here he
[3:08:33.480 --> 3:08:36.600]  he names the criminals who they are what should be done to them
[3:08:36.600 --> 3:08:40.280]  and how they are controlling this implosion of the economy
[3:08:40.280 --> 3:08:45.400]  like a controlled demolition coup d'etat hit it jaren
[3:08:45.400 --> 3:08:48.440]  well joining me now on the first max keiser the journalists and broadcast
[3:08:48.440 --> 3:08:53.160]  alive from paris in france max goldman and uh morgan now subject to
[3:08:53.160 --> 3:08:56.520]  regulation isn't this what critics of their highly geared
[3:08:56.520 --> 3:09:02.360]  dealing have been demanding for years i'm not so sure ashen i think this is a
[3:09:02.360 --> 3:09:07.160]  great way for them now to hide any close examination of their books i think
[3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:11.160]  this is actually in the cards from the beginning because as you know morgan
[3:09:11.160 --> 3:09:14.760]  and jp morgan and goldman sacks have been involved in a
[3:09:14.760 --> 3:09:20.360]  tremendous amount of let's call it the euphemistically money laundering over
[3:09:20.360 --> 3:09:23.800]  the years and now by becoming a commercial bank
[3:09:23.800 --> 3:09:27.560]  i believe that this is going to insulate themselves from any real close
[3:09:27.560 --> 3:09:30.120]  examination because they're going to be behind the firewall
[3:09:30.120 --> 3:09:33.880]  behind hang paulson's firewall you know hang paulson has effectively hijacked
[3:09:33.880 --> 3:09:37.400]  uh the u.s financial system he's no different than the 911 hijackers as far
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:41.160]  as i'm concerned he's a financial terrorist and he's taken the u.s banking
[3:09:41.160 --> 3:09:44.120]  system to the edge of the abyss all for the benefit
[3:09:44.120 --> 3:09:48.040]  of the shareholders and his cronies at goldman
[3:09:48.040 --> 3:09:51.080]  and jp morgan the u.s taxpayer the u.s citizen unfortunately is going to get
[3:09:51.080 --> 3:09:54.600]  the short end of the stick but doesn't the new regulatory provision
[3:09:54.600 --> 3:09:57.480]  because they will now be holding companies mean that we can expect loads
[3:09:57.480 --> 3:10:01.000]  of sec u.s treasury officials all flying around the world to morgan
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:04.360]  stanley and goldman sacks's officers checking all the records interviewing
[3:10:04.360 --> 3:10:07.800]  the staff checking on probity
[3:10:07.800 --> 3:10:11.320]  yes but at the same time as this coup d'etat has taken place and given hang
[3:10:11.320 --> 3:10:15.000]  paulson dictatorial powers to determine what is fact the
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:17.160]  information that should be disclosed or not disclosed
[3:10:17.160 --> 3:10:20.760]  come combine that with bush's dictatorial powers to declare a state of
[3:10:20.760 --> 3:10:24.280]  emergency at the drop of a hat i don't think we're going to see any
[3:10:24.280 --> 3:10:27.480]  of this information is going to see the light of the day at light of day it's just like
[3:10:27.480 --> 3:10:31.240]  remember building seven on nine eleven is where they had all those in ron records
[3:10:31.240 --> 3:10:34.600]  and the uh... the those twin towers collapsing
[3:10:34.600 --> 3:10:38.200]  uh... was kind of a cover to keep those records from being examined
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:42.120]  you know these guys will stop at nothing to keep their dirty laundry a secret
[3:10:42.120 --> 3:10:45.080]  even all just uh... even all the auditing companies
[3:10:45.080 --> 3:10:49.240]  all the auditing companies that now uh... these these banks will have a uh...
[3:10:49.240 --> 3:10:53.480]  well i have to be scrutinized by under federal law
[3:10:53.480 --> 3:10:57.160]  to what auditing companies the ones that have been discredited for the last
[3:10:57.160 --> 3:11:00.920]  ten years and going out of business like arthur anerson who's auditing uh...
[3:11:00.920 --> 3:11:04.520]  and ron for example the auditing companies the rating agencies the treasury
[3:11:04.520 --> 3:11:07.240]  department the federal reserve bank this is a criminal syndicate they should be
[3:11:07.240 --> 3:11:09.960]  investigated under riko these guys are wholesale
[3:11:09.960 --> 3:11:13.320]  thieving of trillions of dollars uh... the rest of the world
[3:11:13.320 --> 3:11:16.600]  unfortunately or fortunately will wake up to the fact that
[3:11:16.600 --> 3:11:20.840]  they should probably get out of the u s dollar because that's the only
[3:11:20.840 --> 3:11:23.960]  tether between the rest of the world in this criminal syndicate on wall street
[3:11:23.960 --> 3:11:26.920]  headed up by hank paulson so once they figure that out
[3:11:26.920 --> 3:11:30.600]  the dollar goes into permanent decline and the rest of the world will escape
[3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:34.840]  this nightmare of u s banking uh... you know hank paulson
[3:11:34.840 --> 3:11:38.120]  has become kind of like a carnal perch character he's gone insane
[3:11:38.120 --> 3:11:41.880]  nobody can stop them they need to send like a martin sheen guy up the river
[3:11:41.880 --> 3:11:46.440]  to uh... find him and take him out because he's taking the entire u.s economy
[3:11:46.440 --> 3:11:50.200]  into oblivion at at the very least will they at least have to play
[3:11:50.200 --> 3:11:53.640]  pay uh... more tax because after so many years people have been saying the
[3:11:53.640 --> 3:11:56.680]  goldman uh... partners when it was a partnership they paid
[3:11:56.680 --> 3:12:00.680]  uh... very little tax
[3:12:00.680 --> 3:12:04.760]  uh... what are they going to be extradited from some low tax
[3:12:04.760 --> 3:12:07.880]  country with a non extradition extradition agreement they're not
[3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:10.520]  going to stick around in the u s when the americans are going to have their
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:14.040]  pitchforks ready to go in and take back their country they're not going to
[3:12:14.040 --> 3:12:17.240]  stick around for that that's uh... for somebody else to do
[3:12:17.240 --> 3:12:20.840]  will will the poor of america now be able to open current accounts grand
[3:12:20.840 --> 3:12:23.960]  mothers with you know ten dollars to spare goldman sacks
[3:12:23.960 --> 3:12:28.440]  branch
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:33.000]  action uh... i don't think you're getting the full picture here
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:38.680]  in order to bail out these cracks the treasury in the federal reserve will
[3:12:38.680 --> 3:12:41.880]  flood the economy with trillions of dollars
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:44.760]  which will take the dot value of the dollar down to zero
[3:12:44.760 --> 3:12:47.720]  sure you can open an account of goldman sacks with your hundred dollar
[3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:51.080]  retirement fund unfortunately that hundred dollars won't buy you any of
[3:12:51.080 --> 3:12:55.160]  this won't buy you toilet paper toilet paper is going to be you know this is
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:12:58.680]  this is more valuable than the u.s dollar in a few uh... in a few weeks time
[3:12:58.680 --> 3:13:01.480]  a hundred dollars a sheet this is a hundred dollars i can make i can make
[3:13:01.480 --> 3:13:04.440]  dollars right here all i want here's a thousand dollars here's five thousand
[3:13:04.440 --> 3:13:08.040]  dollars here's a million dollars it's all going to complete zero it's like the
[3:13:08.040 --> 3:13:11.400]  weimar republic they'll say have all the money you want they want to do how did
[3:13:11.400 --> 3:13:15.240]  they pick another hundred billion dollars doesn't make any differences all worthless
[3:13:15.240 --> 3:13:18.040]  how did they pick the seven hundred billion dollar figure anyway because
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:21.320]  uh... there were some estimates of one point three trillion then it was a
[3:13:21.320 --> 3:13:25.880]  five hundred where where they're getting these numbers from
[3:13:25.880 --> 3:13:29.560]  the seven hundred uh... billion dollars is an arbitrary sum and it's not the
[3:13:29.560 --> 3:13:33.000]  extent to which they can't launder this money it just means that they can't go
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:36.440]  exceed that level at any given moment of the laundering scheme let me tell you
[3:13:36.440 --> 3:13:39.480]  how it works in other words they got the seven hundred billion dollar slash
[3:13:39.480 --> 3:13:42.920]  fund they can buy a mortgage for fifty cents on the dollar to help out their
[3:13:42.920 --> 3:13:46.600]  banking buddies and then they can resell it for some other jump for twenty cents
[3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:50.360]  on the dollar book a loss for the american public take it off the seven
[3:13:50.360 --> 3:13:53.640]  hundred dollar uh... billion excuse me seven hundred billion dollar slash fund
[3:13:53.640 --> 3:13:56.360]  and then do it repeat the process over and over again and they can keep the
[3:13:56.360 --> 3:14:01.080]  circular motion of this money laundering scheme multi national ponzi scheme
[3:14:01.080 --> 3:14:04.440]  going but now it's like it's a controlled demolition it's not unlike
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:07.400]  nine eleven which was a controlled demolition this is a controlled
[3:14:07.400 --> 3:14:09.400]  demolition of the u.s. banking system
[3:14:09.400 --> 3:14:13.720]  hank paulson has become the arsonist and pyromaniac in chief
[3:14:13.720 --> 3:14:18.920]  his job is to floor by floor take the u.s. banking system down take the u.s.
[3:14:18.920 --> 3:14:23.480]  dollar down to its absolute zero and do so without upsetting his chinese
[3:14:23.480 --> 3:14:27.400]  masters as a middle eastern masters and he's a tyrant under the
[3:14:27.400 --> 3:14:29.960]  constitution hank paulson qualifies as a tyrant
[3:14:29.960 --> 3:14:32.920]  it should be taken up on charges under the constitution that's the
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:35.960]  constitutional obligation of every american to
[3:14:35.960 --> 3:14:39.720]  get hank paulson into a court of law as a tyrant
[3:14:39.720 --> 3:14:42.200]  well you you were talking about a question of timing
[3:14:42.200 --> 3:14:45.800]  um by the way building seven is a bit more controversial that we'll have to
[3:14:45.800 --> 3:14:49.960]  save that for another time but uh but as to the timing as long as the chinese
[3:14:49.960 --> 3:14:53.400]  don't withdraw their dollars does that mean that they could have they could
[3:14:53.400 --> 3:14:58.200]  just stave off uh a real systemic economic collapse in the united states
[3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:01.160]  till after the election
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:06.440]  i think that the the word from china was that they were going to start dumping
[3:15:06.440 --> 3:15:10.840]  u.s. dollars this is what triggered all right let's let's pull the clip guys
[3:15:10.840 --> 3:15:14.360]  let's pull the clip uh yeah i mean he he said it all there it's a controlled
[3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:18.440]  demolition coup d'etat of the economy he talks about them blowing out the
[3:15:18.440 --> 3:15:22.200]  economy like they blew up where's the world trade center i mean even the guy
[3:15:22.200 --> 3:15:25.800]  over there knew about building 70s like that's a bit more controversial
[3:15:25.800 --> 3:15:30.200]  well not really when you look at the facts at all intertwines

[3:17:12.440 --> 3:17:15.960]  let's go to uh... john in california john you're on the air
[3:17:15.960 --> 3:17:20.200]  hey it's all about the time and it's great good man
[3:17:20.200 --> 3:17:23.960]  um so i wanted to say thanks for everything i've been pretty much using
[3:17:23.960 --> 3:17:27.160]  all your resources all the prisonplanet tv stuff i've been going to tarpley's
[3:17:27.160 --> 3:17:30.200]  books now i'm reading russ baker's uh bush book
[3:17:30.200 --> 3:17:34.920]  man what an amazing amazing amazing complication that is but i wanted to call
[3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:38.600]  and talk to you about um about the occult you know because i heard somebody
[3:17:38.600 --> 3:17:40.440]  call the other day and you were like
[3:17:40.440 --> 3:17:43.640]  something white magic black magic this and that and you know i mean a lot of
[3:17:43.640 --> 3:17:47.720]  people that do use magical type practices
[3:17:47.720 --> 3:17:51.960]  are funnily enough being validated by quantum science
[3:17:51.960 --> 3:17:55.000]  because the behavioral type stuff that happens in say like a
[3:17:55.000 --> 3:17:58.440]  magic spell or a meditation or whatever you want to call it
[3:17:58.440 --> 3:18:02.440]  um actually happens on the atomic level and they're they're finding these
[3:18:02.440 --> 3:18:04.600]  things like these non-local principles
[3:18:04.600 --> 3:18:07.560]  um in quantum physics you know so it's it's interesting that like these mystery
[3:18:07.560 --> 3:18:10.920]  religions are being sort of validated well let's just say this i mean let's
[3:18:10.920 --> 3:18:13.400]  let's let's put it in this perspective alchemy
[3:18:13.400 --> 3:18:17.080]  used to be you know not only you know this occult ritual type stuff but it was
[3:18:17.080 --> 3:18:19.400]  science you know i mean these things were no doubt
[3:18:19.400 --> 3:18:22.520]  no doubt it was metascience you know and they they would even say like there
[3:18:22.520 --> 3:18:25.240]  were people that thought that it was a code you know that alchemy the the
[3:18:25.240 --> 3:18:29.160]  search for the rose cross for instance was a code for a man having sex with
[3:18:29.160 --> 3:18:33.560]  woman becoming god creating life you know so so i mean it also like i'm not
[3:18:33.560 --> 3:18:36.520]  given validity or not i'm just saying we do have freedom of religion under the
[3:18:36.520 --> 3:18:39.720]  constitution oh yeah and i'm trying to control anyone's religious
[3:18:39.720 --> 3:18:43.640]  beliefs i just put it out there that look i'm not pro occult either side and i
[3:18:43.640 --> 3:18:46.520]  think a lot of people that do like these white magic
[3:18:46.520 --> 3:18:50.760]  practices are kind of fooling themselves into believing like they're part on a
[3:18:50.760 --> 3:18:54.360]  part of a different spectrum of the people that do the black magic stuff
[3:18:54.360 --> 3:18:57.720]  you know what i mean yeah it's possible but i mean i was raised catholic roman
[3:18:57.720 --> 3:19:01.320]  catholic and i didn't dig on it at all so and then i started to do some of this
[3:19:01.320 --> 3:19:05.320]  like ritual magic type stuff and i'm not super into it but i've gone to some
[3:19:05.320 --> 3:19:08.120]  different masses and met a bunch of cool people and i've really had some
[3:19:08.120 --> 3:19:11.720]  spiritual experiences that have like brought me uh cool things so what i'm
[3:19:11.720 --> 3:19:15.320]  saying is like you know that the word occult itself is kind of like that it's
[3:19:15.320 --> 3:19:18.760]  you know there's no value judgment to have on it just like globalism
[3:19:18.760 --> 3:19:22.600]  you know because i think that globalism and in the night not like the zeitgeist
[3:19:22.600 --> 3:19:25.000]  thing or not certainly not killing 90 percent of us
[3:19:25.000 --> 3:19:29.000]  but you know if have you ever read a buckminster fuller
[3:19:29.000 --> 3:19:33.000]  no no i haven't man this guy's books called synergetics and synergetics too
[3:19:33.000 --> 3:19:37.160]  he basically i mean he invented the geodesic dome and all these different
[3:19:37.160 --> 3:19:39.800]  metals that are banned for use because they would be
[3:19:39.800 --> 3:19:44.280]  uh too strong you know interesting uh john i thank you for the call i'll
[3:19:44.280 --> 3:19:48.200]  definitely uh check it out you know i'm i'm not necessarily against anybody
[3:19:48.200 --> 3:19:51.320]  because of the religious beliefs i just feel like you look at the guys at the

[3:24:45.080 --> 3:24:49.320]  calls from nine midnight with my world
[3:24:49.320 --> 3:24:54.600]  let's go to adam in canada adam you're up
[3:24:55.480 --> 3:24:59.160]  are we on it we're on adam right yes sir adam
[3:24:59.160 --> 3:25:02.680]  hello go ahead sir oh hi how are you today jason good
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:06.360]  that's good to hear uh... the theme of today or some of it uh... i've noticed
[3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:08.680]  from the colors is on how to wake people up
[3:25:08.680 --> 3:25:12.200]  mm-hmm and i've been finding a lot of trouble myself uh i've only been uh
[3:25:12.200 --> 3:25:15.480]  awake uh... six months uh only about a year
[3:25:15.480 --> 3:25:18.680]  and i find it really difficult to convince people of
[3:25:18.680 --> 3:25:22.120]  what's going on uh mostly because whenever you say anything
[3:25:22.120 --> 3:25:25.080]  uh... you look like you're crazy mm-hmm
[3:25:25.080 --> 3:25:27.160]  you know i mean uh... we've all been programmed to think they could be a
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:28.680]  super star
[3:25:28.680 --> 3:25:31.320]  not so they believe in aliens and all that kind of stuff and draw those
[3:25:31.320 --> 3:25:32.440]  kind of connections
[3:25:32.440 --> 3:25:36.280]  and i just uh... i wanted to talk about ways to wake up people that are close
[3:25:36.280 --> 3:25:37.640]  to you or people that you know
[3:25:37.640 --> 3:25:40.680]  slowly sure how do i do it
[3:25:40.680 --> 3:25:41.800]  yeah how do you do it
[3:25:41.800 --> 3:25:43.800]  all right well i mean first of all
[3:25:43.800 --> 3:25:47.240]  technology is a double-edged sword just like anything just like the guy called
[3:25:47.240 --> 3:25:49.000]  in the occult i guess you know it can be
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:50.680]  used to do good or harm
[3:25:50.680 --> 3:25:54.280]  so i use it to do good in other words you know i have stuff on my phone that i
[3:25:54.280 --> 3:25:57.880]  can break out in a moment's notice if i get into a conversation with somebody
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:26:01.240]  about something i usually also feel someone out and see where their
[3:26:01.240 --> 3:26:03.080]  perspective is and where they're coming from
[3:26:03.080 --> 3:26:06.840]  you know get their opinion first and then try to find a common viewpoint
[3:26:06.840 --> 3:26:11.240]  to ease them into it i also find it doesn't hurt to have a
[3:26:11.240 --> 3:26:15.240]  a uh actual internet ready computer by your side while you're talking to these
[3:26:15.240 --> 3:26:16.920]  people it's always good to be able to
[3:26:16.920 --> 3:26:20.840]  talk about this stuff off the cuff you know at dinner somewhere else but
[3:26:20.840 --> 3:26:25.080]  not only that you have to be able to find the sources that easy if if that takes
[3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:27.880]  you know doing a little research and just having some bookmarks
[3:26:27.880 --> 3:26:30.840]  quick on your home pc have those ready you know what i mean
[3:26:30.840 --> 3:26:35.960]  um i would also you know definitely try to show that this supersedes left and
[3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:38.680]  right and show some of the scarier stuff i think that
[3:26:38.680 --> 3:26:43.480]  the implantable microchip is you know the vera chip and you know the real id act
[3:26:43.480 --> 3:26:46.440]  rfids are one of the scariest things out there and they're very
[3:26:46.440 --> 3:26:49.080]  very easy to prove to people i mean i can pull up
[3:26:49.080 --> 3:26:52.440]  a chip for sale right now on ebay that i can order
[3:26:52.440 --> 3:26:55.880]  have within a week and if i want inject myself with i mean that's a privatized
[3:26:55.880 --> 3:26:58.360]  one but then there are these other programs you know
[3:26:58.360 --> 3:27:02.920]  i like to pull up the clip from 2004 when uh peter jennings is admitting the
[3:27:02.920 --> 3:27:07.560]  144 um mexican workers in uh the uh
[3:27:07.560 --> 3:27:11.800]  national security agency over there took chips for secure places at the
[3:27:11.800 --> 3:27:15.560]  workforce you know to gain access so i try to find common points that are
[3:27:15.560 --> 3:27:18.920]  going to scare everybody or get everybody to at least take a look at
[3:27:18.920 --> 3:27:23.000]  that information and another thing that i often tell people friends and family
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:26.520]  you know have the card game at your house you know have a drinking night
[3:27:26.520 --> 3:27:29.160]  before you guys go out to the bar on friday at your house
[3:27:29.160 --> 3:27:32.680]  and put something like the obama deception or fabled enemies on in the
[3:27:32.680 --> 3:27:35.240]  background and you know while you're sitting there
[3:27:35.240 --> 3:27:39.960]  you know playing uh cards or kings or whatever you're doing maybe some poker
[3:27:39.960 --> 3:27:43.560]  um have that on so you maybe you catch somebody's ear and they get wait what
[3:27:43.560 --> 3:27:46.440]  did what did he just say wait what is this what am i watching
[3:27:46.440 --> 3:27:50.280]  get them interested that way you know you you just have to draw them into one
[3:27:50.280 --> 3:27:53.720]  point of interest in this whole world expands i'm sure is your where i mean
[3:27:53.720 --> 3:27:56.280]  who woke you up you've only been awake six months to a year
[3:27:56.280 --> 3:27:59.000]  what was it that started you on your journey
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:02.040]  uh me personally uh i'd always been into hip hop
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:04.680]  and uh something prevalent throughout hip hop culture
[3:28:04.680 --> 3:28:07.400]  was the idea that drugs were brought in by the government
[3:28:07.400 --> 3:28:10.440]  and i always thought it was nonsense and i i even heard of alex jones like 10
[3:28:10.440 --> 3:28:13.480]  years ago at a girlfriend's father who was the
[3:28:13.480 --> 3:28:16.840]  you know this crazy guy i thought he was crazy
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:19.800]  he showed me a you know a radio program by himself i always thought it was
[3:28:19.800 --> 3:28:23.720]  nuts first time i've ever heard your uh the loose change i thought you were
[3:28:23.720 --> 3:28:27.000]  crazy and then what really changed was just scanning
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:31.480]  through uh some new documents and it was something about
[3:28:31.480 --> 3:28:35.160]  absolutely proven that in the 1980s the cia
[3:28:35.160 --> 3:28:39.480]  flew cocaine into la oh absolutely well what they were doing is they were taking
[3:28:39.480 --> 3:28:43.240]  cocaine and marijuana from south america and then they were trading arms but they
[3:28:43.240 --> 3:28:46.680]  weren't even hard to see they would do use plausible deniability and proxy
[3:28:46.680 --> 3:28:50.120]  nations in other words they would have israel round up all the weapons
[3:28:50.120 --> 3:28:53.960]  from the check republic and other parts of you know romania all all these places
[3:28:53.960 --> 3:28:57.320]  in europe and then they would take the weapons and they would give them
[3:28:57.320 --> 3:29:01.000]  to the contrast again giving us plausible deniability was all run by our
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:05.160]  intelligence organizations this came out in hearings people got convicted of it
[3:29:05.160 --> 3:29:09.320]  to say that it's a conspiracy theory is absolutely ludicrous we had multiple
[3:29:09.320 --> 3:29:13.080]  pilots go public and say that they not only flew them into the united states
[3:29:13.080 --> 3:29:17.160]  but they flew the drugs into u.s air bases where they were protected and paid
[3:29:17.160 --> 3:29:20.440]  go ahead and that's exactly what uh what woke me up with
[3:29:20.440 --> 3:29:23.720]  i sat down i went well there's this something that i didn't believe in for
[3:29:23.720 --> 3:29:27.560]  so long i thought was just silly you know mumbo jumbo and then you find out
[3:29:27.560 --> 3:29:31.240]  that it's absolutely true 100 percent and you go what other crazy things have i
[3:29:31.240 --> 3:29:35.480]  heard about are nonsensical things that i that i know passed off as well it
[3:29:35.480 --> 3:29:38.840]  shows you that all this information is important and that we can't drop these
[3:29:38.840 --> 3:29:41.560]  types of issues because they use them again and again if it's the drug war
[3:29:41.560 --> 3:29:43.480]  that woke you up and brought you into all this
[3:29:43.480 --> 3:29:48.040]  try to find something like that for other people remember play on their beliefs
[3:29:48.040 --> 3:29:51.720]  at first and then bring them across see how it's going to

[3:33:57.320 --> 3:34:00.280]  mark in georgia mark what's on your mind
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:07.000]  hey bro how you doing you know my impression is that i i call it the
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  rain of the beast and my gut impression is
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  i'm not even remotely worried about people like you
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:18.840]  i'm concerned about the people who think themselves christian
[3:34:18.840 --> 3:34:22.920]  because they fall lockstep with everything they've been programmed into
[3:34:22.920 --> 3:34:28.120]  somebody you're a berean you trust what you can verify and substantiate
[3:34:28.120 --> 3:34:31.640]  and when somebody questions you're questioning you go why is it you have a
[3:34:31.640 --> 3:34:35.800]  problem with me asking a question about this thing that you maintain is so
[3:34:35.800 --> 3:34:40.200]  important why is it you insist that i take what you have to say at face value
[3:34:40.200 --> 3:34:45.080]  and um that's the thing i want to clarify is that
[3:34:45.080 --> 3:34:48.680]  from my point of view and of course people are free to disagree
[3:34:48.680 --> 3:34:52.280]  is that we're looking at the rain of the beast and the beast is not going to come
[3:34:52.280 --> 3:34:56.680]  to power because he's so open and honest about what he's really about
[3:34:56.680 --> 3:35:00.600]  he's going to come to power because he's slick and smooth
[3:35:00.600 --> 3:35:04.600]  and charming like i tried to explain to my dear demented parent
[3:35:04.600 --> 3:35:09.160]  the more smooth and eloquent a politician's rhetoric is
[3:35:09.160 --> 3:35:11.720]  that means you have to crank up the gain on the bull spit
[3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:15.000]  detector it means you have to be all the more
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:18.680]  careful about what are they saying because politicians are relying
[3:35:18.680 --> 3:35:24.040]  on us taking their stated goals at face value oh by the way
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:27.720]  my site is do you love jesus dot org and i'll be the first to admit i'm
[3:35:27.720 --> 3:35:31.960]  trying to get it rebuilt uh because it's a mess right now
[3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:36.120]  and uh you you you understand that the word
[3:35:36.120 --> 3:35:39.000]  agnostic and the word ignorant are of the same
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:43.800]  root that i'm not as concerned about you want to be able to test things and
[3:35:43.800 --> 3:35:46.920]  verify things it's not that you have a problem with the christian
[3:35:46.920 --> 3:35:50.280]  religion you have a problem with the apostate institution
[3:35:50.280 --> 3:35:53.400]  right now that's exactly right now i have a problem with people telling me i'm
[3:35:53.400 --> 3:35:56.840]  a less less of a human being if i believe this or i believe one way
[3:35:56.840 --> 3:36:00.360]  and i just feel like we're never going to be able to defeat these guys and try
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:03.240]  to bring back constitution and bill of rights if we're bickering over
[3:36:03.240 --> 3:36:07.640]  things as petty as religion or race or you know creed all that stuff is is out
[3:36:07.640 --> 3:36:11.160]  the window it's it's it really is an us against them mentality
[3:36:11.160 --> 3:36:15.160]  where it's the general populace who they feel are the serfs
[3:36:15.160 --> 3:36:19.240]  the slave class against the elites and i could care less what somebody believes
[3:36:19.240 --> 3:36:22.040]  religiously and you know i respect their beliefs but
[3:36:22.040 --> 3:36:25.400]  at the same time i don't feel like i should have to adhere to them
[3:36:25.400 --> 3:36:29.800]  amen so uh you're gonna be on tonight i am gonna be on tonight my man
[3:36:29.800 --> 3:36:34.040]  well tell you what um i i imagine you probably have other colors again do you
[3:36:34.040 --> 3:36:38.520]  love jesus dot org that's letter u and i'm trying to get it to where it's not
[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:43.000]  the embarrassment that it is now and i gather we can continue this discussion
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:46.520]  later because i believe the apostle paul
[3:36:46.520 --> 3:36:50.120]  names sound familiar have more memories of the berean's when he wrote
[3:36:50.120 --> 3:36:54.840]  test everything including you know because the thing is i look at how
[3:36:54.840 --> 3:36:59.480]  people have accepted things at face value as though truth were a democracy
[3:36:59.480 --> 3:37:03.640]  and i'm like no it's not and god's not going to
[3:37:03.640 --> 3:37:08.200]  ask my advice on judgment day about your soul any more than he's going to ask
[3:37:08.200 --> 3:37:13.160]  your advice about mine so why are we hung up about my opinion
[3:37:13.160 --> 3:37:17.640]  as to where any particular person or set of persons is going
[3:37:17.640 --> 3:37:20.600]  why don't we just try to live out a genuine message
[3:37:20.600 --> 3:37:24.440]  you see the thing is tough love is essentially we must be accountable to
[3:37:24.440 --> 3:37:26.840]  each other knowing that ultimately we're going to be
[3:37:26.840 --> 3:37:30.840]  accountable to the creator himself by what other by whatever name
[3:37:30.840 --> 3:37:34.760]  you believe that creator to be called does that make sense
[3:37:34.760 --> 3:37:38.360]  it makes sense to me mark i hope to call i hope you are calling later tonight
[3:37:38.360 --> 3:37:42.840]  uh let's jump to the next caller let's go to uh glosser in indiana glosser you're
[3:37:42.840 --> 3:37:46.680]  online yes sir well i just wonder why we seem to be so
[3:37:46.680 --> 3:37:51.320]  powerless as a society to call these people out on the carpet
[3:37:51.320 --> 3:37:55.720]  and do uh something with them as far as bringing criminal charges against them
[3:37:55.720 --> 3:37:59.640]  when uh we know who the players are we know who these people are that are
[3:37:59.640 --> 3:38:04.360]  perpetrating these crimes against this republic and also um
[3:38:04.360 --> 3:38:07.640]  i'd like to say that uh it's just it's just unbelievable
[3:38:07.640 --> 3:38:12.760]  how much time is wasted trying to wake people up i think we need to organize
[3:38:12.760 --> 3:38:16.440]  and uh who wasted so much time on these people
[3:38:16.440 --> 3:38:21.240]  that uh you need needing to be woken up or whatever if you look at it this way
[3:38:21.240 --> 3:38:23.720]  like all right let's let's look at people that are just
[3:38:23.720 --> 3:38:27.080]  angry right now they know something's wrong right but they don't know exactly
[3:38:27.080 --> 3:38:30.840]  what we need to just quit talking we we need to organize
[3:38:30.840 --> 3:38:34.120]  well i agree but i don't bring the battle to them because
[3:38:34.120 --> 3:38:38.280]  well let me let me give you an example man like like we have organized before
[3:38:38.280 --> 3:38:40.760]  in fact a lot of the grassroots organizations out there are the
[3:38:40.760 --> 3:38:44.600]  originators of this tea party idea now we don't have a mainstream television
[3:38:44.600 --> 3:38:47.400]  network we have a message you know we have radio
[3:38:47.400 --> 3:38:50.200]  shows like this one shortwave internet stuff
[3:38:50.200 --> 3:38:54.280]  websites we don't have an o'reilly factor we don't have a glenn beck
[3:38:54.280 --> 3:38:58.280]  and glenn beck goes and sees that a lot of people are nervous a lot of people
[3:38:58.280 --> 3:39:01.080]  are unrest a lot of people want to trust the establishment no matter how
[3:39:01.080 --> 3:39:05.720]  corrupt they are and he uses that to get to organize those people
[3:39:05.720 --> 3:39:08.760]  and it's controlled opposition and they get those in the masses so i still
[3:39:08.760 --> 3:39:11.480]  think it's very important that we wake people up
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:14.680]  and if you're talking about organizing you know let's infiltrate these
[3:39:14.680 --> 3:39:17.800]  organizations i'm encouraging people to go down to san antonio
[3:39:17.800 --> 3:39:21.240]  on april 15th to this tea party bring copies
[3:39:21.240 --> 3:39:24.360]  of the civilian inmate labor program document with you i'm going to be
[3:39:24.360 --> 3:39:26.760]  bringing the copies on them and handing them out to people
[3:39:26.760 --> 3:39:30.280]  and let's try to get these people into our organizations
[3:39:30.280 --> 3:39:34.440]  you know because we all talk about we need to organize we need to do this
[3:39:34.440 --> 3:39:38.200]  we do know who some of the players are and we have tried
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:42.520]  to organize things i mean you know we put we put ron paul
[3:39:42.520 --> 3:39:46.200]  out into the public eye and really gave him a push so that he was one of the
[3:39:46.200 --> 3:39:50.760]  last real candidates in the primaries you know i i think it's all about
[3:39:50.760 --> 3:39:54.040]  getting a unified message and bringing more people into the fold
[3:39:54.040 --> 3:39:59.080]  go ahead even get voted for and that's what's going on basically
[3:39:59.080 --> 3:40:03.560]  um i i'm going to start my own revolt this year i'm not going to file a federal
[3:40:03.560 --> 3:40:07.240]  tax return i'm not going to fund my own destruction from now on
[3:40:07.240 --> 3:40:11.480]  if all the american people got pissed off and said i ain't funding this crap no
[3:40:11.480 --> 3:40:14.040]  more i'm not going to fund the destruction of my own
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:18.040]  country and fund these criminal people and not file a federal tax return
[3:40:18.040 --> 3:40:21.240]  they can't put us all in jail and if they try who cares
[3:40:21.240 --> 3:40:24.840]  bring it on i'm with you there glossary thank you for the call all right
[3:40:24.840 --> 3:40:28.040]  we got a bunch of callers from indiana let's go to george in indiana george
[3:40:28.040 --> 3:40:30.840]  you are on the line hey jason i know you've seen
[3:40:30.840 --> 3:40:34.600]  probably all the videos but my my channel at the floor when i seen this
[3:40:34.600 --> 3:40:38.120]  latest one on youtube about bush in the school
[3:40:38.120 --> 3:40:41.960]  right before they started to read the uh the pet goat
[3:40:41.960 --> 3:40:45.720]  yeah well let me stop you right there first uh before that his brother jeb bush
[3:40:45.720 --> 3:40:49.400]  had declared martial law in a state of emergency in florida two days before
[3:40:49.400 --> 3:40:53.400]  9-11 okay uh there was a weird instance instance
[3:40:53.400 --> 3:40:56.840]  where uh someone wanted to photograph bush in the very beginning people have
[3:40:56.840 --> 3:41:00.840]  said you know was this a attack on him were they trying to
[3:41:00.840 --> 3:41:02.840]  assassinate him no one knows what this is
[3:41:02.840 --> 3:41:07.400]  but for instance we have pictures of him in the classroom
[3:41:07.400 --> 3:41:10.600]  not only in the classroom but in the school and supposedly someone's pointing
[3:41:10.600 --> 3:41:14.200]  to the first plane hitting the building bush went public twice
[3:41:14.200 --> 3:41:18.360]  and said that he saw the first plane hit live on television now we know that's
[3:41:18.360 --> 3:41:21.800]  totally and completely impossible unless he was watching on a closed circuit
[3:41:21.800 --> 3:41:25.160]  television because that didn't air until about uh
[3:41:25.160 --> 3:41:28.600]  i think nine eastern time that evening the first plane hitting
[3:41:28.600 --> 3:41:32.600]  now what we can establish is that he knew about
[3:41:32.600 --> 3:41:36.920]  the first attack the first plane strike before he went into that classroom
[3:41:36.920 --> 3:41:40.840]  okay so then once what he's admitted to that several times so once he's in the
[3:41:40.840 --> 3:41:44.440]  classroom and andy card comes in and he tells him
[3:41:44.440 --> 3:41:47.320]  something people have speculated oh it's the second tower or
[3:41:47.320 --> 3:41:50.680]  oh we're under attack he sits there for another
[3:41:50.680 --> 3:41:54.520]  15 plus minutes before he leaves
[3:41:54.520 --> 3:41:57.720]  with his security force now that tells me two things
[3:41:57.720 --> 3:42:01.400]  uh number one it tells me that this is not a surprise otherwise he would have
[3:42:01.400 --> 3:42:05.000]  left immediately and number two it tells me that the secret service
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:09.320]  must have known he was safe there okay if this was a real attack this is a real
[3:42:09.320 --> 3:42:12.280]  terrorist event you've got hijacked airliners you've got threats to the
[3:42:12.280 --> 3:42:15.400]  president you'd get him out of there it was highly publicized where he was in
[3:42:15.400 --> 3:42:18.040]  florida but they put all these things into play like the
[3:42:18.040 --> 3:42:21.880]  martial law and you know the school photo op in
[3:42:21.880 --> 3:42:25.880]  uh jeb bush's state on purpose go ahead
[3:42:25.880 --> 3:42:31.000]  this this ad for icing to the cake because it was done in an occult-like
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:36.200]  fashion uh this latest video on youtube is uh the kids
[3:42:36.200 --> 3:42:40.520]  saying words that the teacher is pointing on the on the uh
[3:42:40.520 --> 3:42:44.360]  the board and they always had to sound off on this but what it's saying is
[3:42:44.360 --> 3:42:50.360]  kite hit steel plane must that's a cultish for
[3:42:50.360 --> 3:42:55.320]  kite plane must hit steel in other words the planes were remote control like a
[3:42:55.320 --> 3:42:59.000]  kite and if you watch this video you can see
[3:42:59.000 --> 3:43:04.040]  bush almost turn into the devil i mean you wouldn't believe the patient i've
[3:43:04.040 --> 3:43:07.160]  seen the video i've seen listen i've seen the video i know exactly what you're
[3:43:07.160 --> 3:43:10.920]  talking about it's very unnerving you know he's reading my pet goat is that a
[3:43:10.920 --> 3:43:15.240]  symbolism for baphomet very possibly you know they're into the occult i try to
[3:43:15.240 --> 3:43:18.360]  stick to what i can prove is it interesting yeah it is interesting i
[3:43:18.360 --> 3:43:22.840]  thank you for the call my man all right let's go to brandon in indiana it's the
[3:43:22.840 --> 3:43:27.000]  trifecta of indiana calls brandon you're on the line
[3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:30.360]  well uh you know i thought i'd mentioned something about
[3:43:30.360 --> 3:43:36.520]  all this occult talk um you know really it's just an operating system
[3:43:36.520 --> 3:43:40.520]  it you know they can't you can't demonize the system
[3:43:40.520 --> 3:43:45.800]  it's it's ultimately the people and and what their goals are and then most of
[3:43:45.800 --> 3:43:50.360]  them that most of the people were referring to their goals are basically
[3:43:50.360 --> 3:43:55.160]  to destroy human will and and humanity itself
[3:43:55.160 --> 3:43:59.400]  i would um like to draw everybody's attention to
[3:43:59.400 --> 3:44:03.640]  i mean i believe mostly how they're doing what they're doing is through
[3:44:03.640 --> 3:44:09.800]  contracting everyone's got free will they offer these benefits they offer these
[3:44:09.800 --> 3:44:13.720]  contracts and and i'll just tell you indiana mitch daniels
[3:44:13.720 --> 3:44:19.240]  has been privatizing all of our benefits but people are basically signing
[3:44:19.240 --> 3:44:24.120]  their rights away to the government and they see that is their
[3:44:24.120 --> 3:44:28.040]  ability to do what they will with you if you're going to give your rights to them
[3:44:28.040 --> 3:44:31.560]  then then they're going to do what they want to do
[3:44:31.560 --> 3:44:35.080]  absolutely and you know it is that kind of a mentality where they want our
[3:44:35.080 --> 3:44:39.560]  permission and they want us to allow them to come in and do this sort of
[3:44:39.560 --> 3:44:42.520]  thing you know that they only like to go by force
[3:44:42.520 --> 3:44:46.840]  you know conquest when they ultimately have no other choice otherwise it's
[3:44:46.840 --> 3:44:49.800]  consent you know that those are two main modes of
[3:44:49.800 --> 3:44:54.120]  operating is you know consent and conquest and when they can't get consent
[3:44:54.120 --> 3:44:57.640]  you know they consent to conquest in other words to go into something like
[3:44:57.640 --> 3:45:00.760]  iraq and afghanistan they'll pull off an attack here and then they will get
[3:45:00.760 --> 3:45:04.200]  consent right we do have one weapon though
[3:45:04.200 --> 3:45:07.880]  it is in the commercial code the uniform commercial code
[3:45:07.880 --> 3:45:14.760]  an explicit reservation of rights you basically sign your name and you write
[3:45:14.760 --> 3:45:17.960]  without prejudice above your name and underline it
[3:45:17.960 --> 3:45:22.600]  it's in the commercial code it's how they operate the court system uses it
[3:45:22.600 --> 3:45:25.960]  but the thing is you need to know what you're doing you need to know about
[3:45:25.960 --> 3:45:30.120]  common law right yeah yeah i mean you can set all these
[3:45:30.120 --> 3:45:34.040]  declarations out there there's a film out there called hijacking humanity that
[3:45:34.040 --> 3:45:37.720]  has a large section on common law i encourage people to check that out

[3:46:57.560 --> 3:47:01.880]  yeah i don't good man it's an honor to talk to you i
[3:47:01.880 --> 3:47:06.520]  seem loose change and i've used it to wake up a couple good friends of mine and
[3:47:06.520 --> 3:47:10.920]  you know it's just it's it's great to see other people
[3:47:10.920 --> 3:47:14.680]  get the same feeling of it that i did but um
[3:47:14.680 --> 3:47:18.040]  i was calling because lately i've been noticing a trend even with the people
[3:47:18.040 --> 3:47:22.680]  that i woke up is that people are just repeating
[3:47:22.680 --> 3:47:28.120]  what you say or what alex says and i i don't necessarily have a problem with
[3:47:28.120 --> 3:47:32.360]  that my problem comes from people not actually going
[3:47:32.360 --> 3:47:36.360]  and looking for themselves it's it's i have a big problem with that i think
[3:47:36.360 --> 3:47:39.000]  that you need to verify everything i say i'm not going to get everything a
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:42.280]  hundred percent right neither is alex jones and that's why
[3:47:42.280 --> 3:47:46.440]  well basically what i do before i come into every show is i just go scan
[3:47:46.440 --> 3:47:50.680]  the uh the regular news wires i go to routers i go to
[3:47:50.680 --> 3:47:54.760]  msnbc i go to fox i go to the telegraph and i go to the guardian those are my
[3:47:54.760 --> 3:47:57.400]  big five sites now other than that i also check my
[3:47:57.400 --> 3:48:00.440]  myspace in my facebook so a lot of the information i present here
[3:48:00.440 --> 3:48:04.360]  really isn't even my own it is coming out of the mainstream media but it's
[3:48:04.360 --> 3:48:07.480]  really coming out of all the little info warriors all across the country that
[3:48:07.480 --> 3:48:11.720]  are sending me this stuff you know well for instance section 1710
[3:48:11.720 --> 3:48:13.800]  of the give act i wouldn't have known about that
[3:48:13.800 --> 3:48:17.080]  unless uh one of my callers came in and said listen you need to
[3:48:17.080 --> 3:48:20.840]  listen to what 1710 is he read it to me i then went and verified it myself
[3:48:20.840 --> 3:48:23.800]  and check it out other people should be doing the same you know it's not enough
[3:48:23.800 --> 3:48:26.920]  just to listen to the podcast or listen to the radio show
[3:48:26.920 --> 3:48:30.840]  please look at these articles please look at these videos verify what i'm
[3:48:30.840 --> 3:48:34.360]  saying is true and if i'm incorrect let me know if you have another take on it
[3:48:34.360 --> 3:48:38.280]  we encourage you to call in go ahead well you know that's
[3:48:38.280 --> 3:48:41.400]  that's kind of how i feel about it too i mean if one person
[3:48:41.400 --> 3:48:45.240]  comes up to somebody who's not awake and just completely
[3:48:45.240 --> 3:48:48.600]  recites word for word what was said on the radio show
[3:48:48.600 --> 3:48:52.600]  great you said what you've heard but you have nothing to back that claim up
[3:48:52.600 --> 3:48:57.720]  at all you you don't have date you may not have a date you may not have
[3:48:57.720 --> 3:49:01.240]  anything that's actually tangible to prove to somebody
[3:49:01.240 --> 3:49:05.400]  and then i mean if you actually have studied something and you are educated
[3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:10.040]  on it you have no problem defending your point of view and people kind of
[3:49:10.040 --> 3:49:13.400]  respond better to someone who's confident with what they're saying and a lot of
[3:49:13.400 --> 3:49:17.000]  people are like well why can't i wake this person up well it's because you're
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:20.440]  you're not completely awake yet yourself in my eyes
[3:49:20.440 --> 3:49:23.400]  well it took me a long time to get to the point where i was comfortable
[3:49:23.400 --> 3:49:27.720]  uh doing this on a massive level it took me a short period of time i got a
[3:49:27.720 --> 3:49:30.600]  pretty good memory to try to take some of these facts to my friends and my
[3:49:30.600 --> 3:49:34.040]  family but like you said it's very difficult when you're just sitting there
[3:49:34.040 --> 3:49:36.680]  talking to somebody and you don't have the article right in front of you to
[3:49:36.680 --> 3:49:40.360]  back up it's gotten a lot easier with the advent of cell phone technology
[3:49:40.360 --> 3:49:43.640]  wireless internet everywhere laptops and that sort of thing
[3:49:43.640 --> 3:49:47.560]  however you're correct i mean if you're sitting there babbling and coming off
[3:49:47.560 --> 3:49:51.000]  sounding crazy and you're not confident you're not making eye contact
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:54.040]  obviously you're not going to encourage somebody to take a look at the
[3:49:54.040 --> 3:49:58.040]  information you're presenting you know you have to be cool calm collected and
[3:49:58.040 --> 3:50:02.280]  focused on what you're trying to tell somebody
[3:50:02.280 --> 3:50:07.240]  well i appreciate you taking my call man and uh like i said i'm i use your
[3:50:07.240 --> 3:50:10.280]  movies to and alex's movies to wake up people and i'm

[3:50:41.080 --> 3:50:44.200]  concerned about that no kidding we're concerned about it
[3:50:44.200 --> 3:50:48.280]  because a new world order means less for us and more for them
[3:50:48.280 --> 3:50:51.640]  it's the alex joneshow on jason bermas we'll be back after this info wars dot

[3:51:09.720 --> 3:51:13.160]  than when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are inhaled
[3:51:13.160 --> 3:51:16.120]  when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin

[3:54:09.560 --> 3:54:15.240]  final segment and joining us now alex jones alex what's up
[3:54:15.240 --> 3:54:18.040]  hey buddy i've been taking care of business all day and i've been taking my
[3:54:18.040 --> 3:54:21.400]  children fishing and i've been listening to the show and that was you know that
[3:54:21.400 --> 3:54:27.000]  last caller was a nice guy but i you know i don't completely agree
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:34.200]  with him or by that i mean i think we should spend all our time
[3:54:34.200 --> 3:54:38.920]  uh... being too worried about how we present things
[3:54:38.920 --> 3:54:42.120]  uh... or obsessing or trying to convince those
[3:54:42.120 --> 3:54:45.720]  hey if people want to have older 401k stolen i want to live in a world
[3:54:45.720 --> 3:54:48.520]  government i want to have their confiscated
[3:54:48.520 --> 3:54:52.120]  i mean we've been doing people a favor you know we're doing something for
[3:54:52.120 --> 3:54:54.920]  humanity warning all these stupid
[3:54:54.920 --> 3:55:00.040]  uh... self-serving for themselves arrogant foolish people
[3:55:00.040 --> 3:55:03.880]  and you know i feel sorry for that guy trying to wake folks up and they get
[3:55:03.880 --> 3:55:09.080]  problems but you know i get people documentation evidence hardcore facts
[3:55:09.080 --> 3:55:14.120]  and they still deny it and so i say to that guy or to others just move on
[3:55:14.120 --> 3:55:17.400]  move on there's always people that want to be suckers there's always people that
[3:55:17.400 --> 3:55:20.840]  want to be slaves uh... i don't think people are running around
[3:55:20.840 --> 3:55:25.640]  regurgitating what they heard on info wars dot com or or on the radio show
[3:55:25.640 --> 3:55:29.720]  all we do is cover legislation and documents and
[3:55:29.720 --> 3:55:34.120]  have guessed on that literally 98 percent of what we cover
[3:55:34.120 --> 3:55:37.640]  on the radio is posted on the website
[3:55:37.640 --> 3:55:41.640]  uh... and so no it we have the higher standard of journalism we have the
[3:55:41.640 --> 3:55:45.080]  higher standard of documentation we've done a fabulous job
[3:55:45.080 --> 3:55:50.120]  it's the mainstream or media uh... that's now trying to play catch up
[3:55:50.120 --> 3:55:53.800]  and so i i think the most important thing relaying information to people is to be
[3:55:53.800 --> 3:55:56.840]  confident and to say listen we have a world
[3:55:56.840 --> 3:56:01.000]  government coming down on us uh... and we've been right all along
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:05.480]  and we need to point that out to people uh... look who even needs to wake up one
[3:56:05.480 --> 3:56:09.640]  of these arrogant nobodies who is on a power trip thinking that
[3:56:09.640 --> 3:56:11.960]  you know they run the planet the establishment
[3:56:11.960 --> 3:56:15.160]  doesn't have anything over on them but i mean who wants to wake up somebody
[3:56:15.160 --> 3:56:18.600]  that doesn't instinctively know that government's too big and the tyranny's
[3:56:18.600 --> 3:56:22.600]  out of control and that freedoms under attack at every level of society and
[3:56:22.600 --> 3:56:25.480]  that we're in serious trouble uh...
[3:56:25.480 --> 3:56:29.320]  listen five percent what the revolutionary war against britain we got
[3:56:29.320 --> 3:56:33.240]  way more than five percent right now and so the main thing is just to go out and
[3:56:33.240 --> 3:56:37.320]  wake up those that want to be woken up but also see no no no to this system
[3:56:37.320 --> 3:56:40.600]  and call for the arrest of these bankers jason i appreciate you filling in
