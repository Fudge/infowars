[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  It's Wednesday, July 21st. This is the biggest news we've broken in our entire history. Get ready.
[00:13.000 --> 00:30.000]  Infowars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:43.000 --> 00:54.000]  Excuse me, sir. Would you mind letting me have a look at the contents of your bag, please?
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  Biological samples. I have the papers right here.
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.000]  I'm going to have to ask you to open this up, sir.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  Open it? Yes, of course.
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  Excuse me, sir. You'll have to get in the lounge.
[01:21.000 --> 01:28.000]  See? It's biological. Check the papers. It's all proper. Take the permit.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  It's empty.
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.000]  Well, yes, to be sure. It looks empty, but I assure you it's not.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.000]  You don't understand.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  No, ma'am, I don't have to understand. But you have to get in front.
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  This is very important. You're the man who said that you cannot get around.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  There you see? All so invisible to the naked eye.
[01:52.000 --> 02:00.000]  It doesn't even have an odor.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  That's not necessary, sir. There you go. Thank you for your cooperation. Have a good flight.
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  Bill Gates tells you he wants to kill you.
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  And he takes over every major medical system on the planet,
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  backed by the Rockefeller Foundation now in public control of world health
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  through the UN that they established in 1946.
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  And I want you to meet the real 12-monkey scientist. He adds up.
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  The program, ladies and gentlemen, are the biggest bio weapons lab in the world in London, England.
[02:37.000 --> 02:46.000]  He's David L. V. Bauer, and he went on TV and said that the inoculations for COVID-19 from Pfizer
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  that he studies and runs the program on, studying those that are vaccinated around the world,
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  he says it will get rid of your immune system and give you one-sixth of the immune system
[02:56.000 --> 03:03.000]  you had previously and that you're going to need shots every month, every month.
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  This gets rid of your immune system. It basically gives you the equivalent of HIV.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  It even has the HIV delivery system in it, but it doesn't do a different mechanism
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  and destroys your body's immune system. They have committed mass crimes against humanity.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  I think we're too stupid to know what's happening. I had a huge brainstorm yesterday
[03:20.000 --> 03:27.000]  and I did seven hours of research yesterday evening until 3.30 in the morning.
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.000]  And I'm going to present that here today, but here's just a small prelude of what's coming up. Here he is.
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  A message from our finding is that we found that recipients of the Pfizer vaccine,
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  those who've had two doses, have about five to six-fold lower amounts of neutralizing antibodies.
[03:46.000 --> 03:52.000]  Now, these are the sort of gold standard private security antibodies of your immune system
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  which block the virus from getting into your cells in the first place.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  So we found that that's less for people with two doses.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  We've also found that for people with only one dose of the Pfizer jab
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  that they are less likely to have high levels of these antibodies in their blood.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  And perhaps most importantly for all of us going forward
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  is that we see that the older you are, the lower your levels are likely to be
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  and the time since you've had your second jab, as that time goes on,
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  the lower your levels are also likely to be.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  So that's telling us that we're probably going to be needing to prioritize boosters
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  for older and more vulnerable people coming up soon, especially if this new variant spreads.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  So folks saw that and got about five million views and Twitter took it down.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  It was on an international TV.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  And then I went and read a bunch of his papers and he admits it gets rid of your immune system.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  So, wow! Who needs an immune system? Thank you, Pfizer.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  Oh, it's all coming up. Oh, and guess who's sponsoring Making Little Kids Wear a Mask?
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  You guessed again, Pfizer, the spirit of Hitler lives.
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the Infowars War Room.
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  And I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfowarsStore.com.
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers, and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[05:13.000 --> 05:19.000]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfowarsStore.com.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away. Listen to this.
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf,
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  And we packed it all in to fibergreencaps at InfowarsStore.com.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  So, I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  I suggest that you do the same thing.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  And right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[05:55.000 --> 05:59.000]  That's 33% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:25.000 --> 06:33.000]  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender.
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  This position to fight back against these monsters.
[06:59.000 --> 07:05.000]  So, I want to salute all of you for keeping us in this position, holding us with your gravity, with your will,
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  where we're still here despite all the enemy's attacks.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  And I just thank God for putting me in the position to be able to do this.
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  I have been very, very obviously upset. It's like you have about the extermination of our people
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  and about this public depopulation being carried out by folks that say they wanted to carry out this very depopulation.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  But, I got home yesterday, had dinner with the family.
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  My daughter wanted to go to bed early. The youngest daughter, about eight.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  So, I went into my office. I closed the door.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  And it was about 1 a.m. when I went and got in bed.
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.000]  And then I could not stop praying.
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  And God said, get back up and go get back on the computer.
[07:47.000 --> 07:50.000]  And I just started jumping around everywhere.
[07:50.000 --> 07:56.000]  And just, I'm going to give you that gestalt of information here today.
[07:56.000 --> 08:02.000]  And while I was up late at night, I was getting text messages from very well-known prominent talk show hosts
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  who were all simultaneously researching the same thing.
[08:05.000 --> 08:12.000]  So, I'm up at midnight and top talk show hosts in the country, just to show you the synchronicity,
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  are both hitting me with messages on the same zeitgeist subject.
[08:16.000 --> 08:23.000]  So, the forces with us, as they say, let me go ahead and lay it out for you.
[08:23.000 --> 08:30.000]  Let me just lay it out. And then in the next hour, I'm going to show you everything I claim here.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  We have video of Fauci, but we have like five videos.
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  But I'm going to play one here.
[08:36.000 --> 08:42.000]  2012, 2013, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, so six videos.
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  Of him saying, of course I'm funding Gain of Function, it's good to do calling it Gain of Function.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  And then we have him saying he's never funded Gain of Function.
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.000]  When taking animal viruses and making them transmittable to humans is the essence of when they developed the term
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.000]  during World War II of the Nazis giving animal viruses Gain of Function to humans.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  The term comes from that.
[09:05.000 --> 09:12.000]  So, it's like saying, Roger Stalback was never a gallus cowboy. I mean, he's the cowboy.
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.000]  I mean, it's just ridiculous level gaslighting.
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  We have that. That's one small area.
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  And Senator Paul's saying he's referring for criminal prosecution of Fauci.
[09:24.000 --> 09:25.000]  Don't hold your breath.
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  But I mean, this is what he's done.
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  He is a criminal with Bill Gates.
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  And it's either us or them.
[09:32.000 --> 09:40.000]  And then I began to research off a clip that I ran into it like eight at night of Trudeau,
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  the guy that says he wants to be a Communist Chinese dictator, the Prime Minister of Canada.
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  Still got him in lockdown up there.
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  Announcing forced booster shots because they're trying to make them forced.
[09:54.000 --> 10:02.000]  Every year and in 2024, they go back to giving you two a year of whatever quote,
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  Pfizer wants to put in you.
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  Then off of that, I did some more research.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  And I said, I wonder who's directing this project.
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  So I looked up who directs the project of how to quote tweak the Pfizer shot.
[10:17.000 --> 10:26.000]  And I found the former Pfizer employee who heads up the project for the main level four bio weapons lab in London, England.
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  That we'll be telling you about.
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.000]  And I watched seven or eight of his videos and then read, scanned over dozens of his papers.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  And by the time I was done, my job was on the ground.
[10:38.000 --> 10:44.000]  And it went right back to Henrietta Lacks.
[10:44.000 --> 10:51.000]  That we told you about this black woman that got eaten alive by cancer in one week.
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  And they cut her uterus out, stole it.
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.000]  And it's the basis of all human cloning.
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  Everything today, the cells won't die.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  They have factories all the world that just create her cells.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  And I already knew all this, but my God, I didn't know they cloned her.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  In 1966, they spliced her with mice in 1966.
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  I mean, we, I mean, folks, you've seen the thing where it like jumps on things and eats them.
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  That's that's what ate her.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  And they even say they don't believe it's human doesn't have our genome doesn't have our chromosomes.
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  And they call it another species in debate, whether what was in our uterus is an alien.
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  I'm going to show you Wikipedia and then I'm going to show you the actual documents.
[11:37.000 --> 11:44.000]  Now, this little feller right here, because let me tell you, I'm not going to pretend to know exactly what they're doing.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  But let's just say this, it's world ending, baby.
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.000]  They're putting Henrietta Lacks cells in you.
[11:52.000 --> 12:02.000]  And one other white baby that got aborted in the third trimester also in the late sixties, but she's from 1951.
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, whoa, this isn't a science fiction movie.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  You went to sit down and eat some milk duds and popcorn, right?
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  This is chills up my spine.
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.000]  I got in bed at 330 and I literally had to get back out of the bed and get on my knees.
[12:21.000 --> 12:32.000]  And because we already knew this stuff, but man, this is bad. This is bad, bad, bad.
[12:32.000 --> 12:41.000]  They admit on video and I'm going to show you when we come back that they had the guy that heads the program up.
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  That it gets rid of your immune system.
[12:46.000 --> 12:56.000]  And that when you've taken two Pfizer shots alone, your immune system is one sixth what it was.
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  You're like, well, that's hiding criminal activity in plain view.
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  Because they have to just say it like, hey, pedophilia is legal.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  I got articles right here.
[13:03.000 --> 13:04.000]  Mainstream news.
[13:04.000 --> 13:12.000]  Horrifying Berlin foster experiments, saw kids deliberately given to pedos to see if sex abuse was good for them, close quote.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  Told you about that a long time ago, but it's mainstream news.
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  They get it to 30,000 plus children all over Germany.
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.000]  Babies to be raped by men in an experiment.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  So it's the same group.
[13:24.000 --> 13:31.000]  But what I'm getting in here is you have to hide it in plain view like, well, sure we give kids pedophiles.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  What's the big deal?
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  Or sure, of course, we injected black people with sephalus.
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  Oh, oh, oh, the Henrietta lack story.
[13:40.000 --> 13:52.000]  Guess where it comes out of and the human cloning Tuskegee, Alabama.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  And then they spliced her with everything.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  Because you see the cells won't die.
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  They never stopped replicating.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  You just put some on the table and they'll live five years.
[14:03.000 --> 14:10.000]  But if you give them, put them in any type of medium, they just keep growing and growing and growing and growing.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  They send ourselves to space.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  They divide it even faster.
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[14:14.000 --> 14:15.000]  This is all real.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  Okay.
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.000]  But just the bombshells that I'm giving you here, you're going to see video of Trudeau saying, oh, you're going to get shots every year.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  And then you're going to learn why they're now saying, oh, you need 10 shots a year.
[14:28.000 --> 14:34.000]  It's a therapeutic and we're going to give you cancer drugs if you have COVID.
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  Because, oh, it's like cancer or HIV.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  They're now announcing.
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.000]  I have those clips.
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  Like, you know, it's like HIV.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  It gets rid of your immune system and it never goes away.
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  But then they go, oh, and the vaccine gets rid of your immune system and never goes away.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  But don't worry.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  We've got cancer drugs for you after the shots don't work.
[14:52.000 --> 15:03.000]  Oh, permanently wipes out your bone marrow and your lymph nodes able to defend you.
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.000]  They're just lowering everybody's defenses right now for extermination.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  That's how powerful we are as they've got to actually put this.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  I mean, they've done it.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  They've done it.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  They've done it.
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.000]  And I guess we're going to join all the abortive babies now because they're, I mean, within six months to a year and it's already happening.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]  Just the death is going to be everywhere.
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  When the viruses and the mutations hit this fall, they're going to say it's COVID.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  Everything's going to be locked down.
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  There's going to be dead people all over the place and it's going to get worse and worse and worse until we wake up.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  They're doing this to us on purpose.
[15:31.000 --> 15:38.000]  I don't care if you're in the Navy or you're a farmer or you're in the FBI or you're in the military or you're a school teacher.
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.000]  I don't care who you are.
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  This is going to get you.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  You're not getting out of this.
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  You're not getting out of this.
[15:45.000 --> 15:51.000]  They got cells that they debate are alien that they're putting in all this.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  The Gardasil shots, all the major vaccines.
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.000]  Henrietta lacks whatever ate her.
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  Your voice counts.
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.000]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  They know you're angry.
[16:13.000 --> 16:18.000]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[17:19.000 --> 17:25.000]  We're trying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.000]  And then in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  They're now implementing it.
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  And now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[17:42.000 --> 17:51.000]  By the thirties was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Couserville Home Institute in Germany.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  And full wars will continue to set fast.
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.000]  They fight this.
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  I don't know how long we can.
[17:55.000 --> 17:56.000]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[17:56.000 --> 17:57.000]  God bless and good luck.
[17:57.000 --> 18:13.000]  I would begin to get right with God right now.
[18:27.000 --> 18:37.000]  I don't know how long this is going to take.
[18:37.000 --> 18:47.000]  I don't know how long this is going to take.
[18:47.000 --> 19:07.000]  I don't know how long this is going to take.
[19:07.000 --> 19:27.000]  I don't know how long this is going to take.
[19:27.000 --> 19:54.000]  Everyone on Earth is being injected with cellular product from an immortal cell line from a
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  black woman that died in 1951.
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  An aggressive cancer.
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.000]  They believe it's not of human cells.
[20:02.000 --> 20:09.000]  Different genome that cannot die ate her in a week.
[20:09.000 --> 20:15.000]  They took it for research and only found one other human they admit that had an immortal cell line.
[20:15.000 --> 20:19.000]  That was an aborted baby in the 1960s.
[20:19.000 --> 20:25.000]  They've got other immortal cell lines that they're not telling us about in other plants and animals.
[20:25.000 --> 20:31.000]  That's why there's some trees they'll find that normally can live 500 years, but some they found that are 4,000 years old.
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  There's certain cell lines that are basically immortal.
[20:34.000 --> 20:40.000]  This is the secret to immortality that so many sought out the holy grail.
[20:40.000 --> 20:51.000]  And they are testing it all on us to then get tissue samples they believe to find out of all these horrible mutations that are going to happen.
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  A controllable immortal cell line for life extension.
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.000]  So now you know the main mode of power control playing God.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  Let me give you the bombshell information.
[21:03.000 --> 21:16.000]  You have to understand this is seven hours of research yesterday that dovetails into years of research, but the rabbit hole is so deep that we only scratch the surface and we've gone deeper than anybody else.
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  But the people running this who are light years ahead of us.
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.000]  They're evil.
[21:21.000 --> 21:22.000]  They're hunchback.
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.000]  We're almost always connected to pedophilia because it's about the humanizing humanity.
[21:27.000 --> 21:36.000]  They're the scum of the earth, but they are willing to go randomly to raw research as they call it.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  And to get control of society to play God.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  And now they're doing it.
[21:39.000 --> 21:46.000]  Here is Justin Trudeau, the leader of Canada who said in multiple occasions he admires dictatorship.
[21:46.000 --> 21:52.000]  Here he is yesterday announcing that they're buying from Pfizer.
[21:52.000 --> 21:57.000]  Who had Bill Gates, the Rockefeller Foundation run everything, the mass mandates on kids, everything.
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.000]  They're the ones behind it.
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000]  I'll show you those documents next segment.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.000]  They are now coming out.
[22:04.000 --> 22:20.000]  This is the project director, David L. V. Bauer group leader of the most prestigious facility, one of the most prestigious facilities in the world, the Francis Crick Institute,
[22:20.000 --> 22:26.000]  the biggest, most high-tech biolab in the world in London.
[22:26.000 --> 22:36.000]  Here they are saying your monthly dose now, at least 10 shots, they say monthly, but they say 10 a year, not 12, of whatever Pfizer says goes into you.
[22:36.000 --> 22:49.000]  And he goes on to say, and I went and read his papers where he says this, they've studied those injected with the Pfizer shot alone in the UK and from around the world.
[22:49.000 --> 22:52.000]  He's from North America, but he lives in England.
[22:52.000 --> 22:57.000]  He's an Oxford scholar, Cecil Road scholar.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  That's the global government trust.
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  Road scholar.
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  And he's running this particular program and he says this gets rid of your immune system.
[23:06.000 --> 23:13.000]  He just said, now you're not going to have an immune system anymore, but it's okay because now we're going to give you shots all the time.
[23:13.000 --> 23:14.000]  We're going to play him in a moment.
[23:14.000 --> 23:27.000]  Here is Trudeau saying it, and then here is this individual, the head scientist leading the testing that's actually showing that you don't have the immune system after you do this.
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  I mean, this is just earth shattering, but they put it out like it's no big deal.
[23:31.000 --> 23:38.000]  You've got something less than one tenth of 1% death rate, even in sick people, even in old people, comorbidities.
[23:38.000 --> 23:46.000]  You've got something that doesn't even affect the young, but thanks to hysteria and irrational behavior, they're now telling you, oh, and we showed mainstream news articles last segment.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  When I mentioned that, they just pulled up articles.
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  Mainline news went, well, yeah, the Pfizer shot does get rid of your immunity.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  They all do.
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  So here it is, ladies and gentlemen, David LV Bauer.
[24:00.000 --> 24:06.000]  First, we're going to play the leader of Canada still under lockdown yesterday.
[24:06.000 --> 24:07.000]  Here it is.
[24:07.000 --> 24:15.000]  While more and more Canadians are getting vaccinated right now, it's also important to plan ahead for the future.
[24:15.000 --> 24:24.000]  We've reached an agreement with Pfizer for 35 million booster doses for next year and 30 million in the year after.
[24:24.000 --> 24:35.000]  This deal includes options to add 30 million doses in both 2022 and 2023 and an option for 60 million doses in 2024.
[24:35.000 --> 24:46.000]  Pfizer has been a solid partner for Canada in this fight against COVID-19, and we're happy to be one of the first countries to secure an agreement with them going forward.
[24:46.000 --> 24:55.000]  These boosters will be the latest version of the Pfizer vaccine based on research and testing, and they will help us keep the virus under control.
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  And the work doesn't end there either.
[24:57.000 --> 25:04.000]  We're on ongoing discussions with other vaccine manufacturers about their plans for booster shots, too.
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  Their plans, they say it.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  Well, it's in its secret.
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.000]  They don't do public testing.
[25:09.000 --> 25:16.000]  They just give you the experimental injections, which they admit give you blood clots that can kill you and attack your uterus.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  And, oh, you'll think you have cancer, but don't worry, it's not cancer.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  Though people then go in and have stage three, stage four cancer.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  That's mainline news.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  And they're just normalizing it.
[25:24.000 --> 25:25.000]  Hey, get rid of your immune system.
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  Hey, a lot of people are getting cancer within a few weeks of taking this.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  No, it is causing it.
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.000]  Just don't worry.
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  That's just a happy side effect.
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  And they've noticed that they just normalize it like, hey, we're going to have human sacrifice.
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  Bring your firstborn son up to the temple next week.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  We're going to cut their heart out under the full moon.
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  And people went, well, everybody's cutting their child's heart out.
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  Every culture went into a decadent cycle and would demand the firstborn boys and girls be killed.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  Every culture.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  Mesoameric, if you've got a German background, your ancestors ate their children in certain times.
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  If you've got a Latin American background, Mesoamerican, your ancestors ate their children.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  If you've got an ancient African background, there were times when people sacrificed their children.
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.000]  Why does every culture do this?
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  There is an evil group that gets control and does this.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.000]  Look at this headline.
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  Mainline news.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  DW.com, the sun, everything reporting him.
[26:18.000 --> 26:28.000]  Horrifying Berlin foster experiments saw 30,000 children deliberately given to pedophiles to see if sex abuse was, quote, good for them.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  That's human sacrifice right there.
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  This is a cult.
[26:32.000 --> 26:41.000]  So here's David LV Bauer, who heads up the program at the main bio weapons lab in London, England that started the first shots.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  That's going after the kids.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  That's doing the trials on children.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  He studies their blood to see what happens.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  And he heads the project up.
[26:49.000 --> 26:57.000]  And here he is telling you that it reduces your immune system massively when you take it.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  You've got to have more shots in the future.
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  Well, how about capturing humanity?
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  Here it is.
[27:01.000 --> 27:13.000]  So the key message from our finding is that we found that recipients of the Pfizer vaccine, those who've had two doses, have about five to six fold lower amounts of neutralizing antibodies.
[27:13.000 --> 27:23.000]  Now these are the sort of gold standard private security antibodies of your immune system, which block the virus from getting into your cells in the first place.
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  So we found that that's less for people with two doses.
[27:27.000 --> 27:35.000]  We've also found that for people with only one dose of the Pfizer jab, that they are less likely to have high levels of these antibodies in their blood.
[27:35.000 --> 27:43.000]  And perhaps most importantly for all of us going forward is that we see that the older you are, the lower your levels are likely to be.
[27:43.000 --> 27:49.000]  And the time since you've had your second jab, as that time goes on, the lower your levels are also likely to be.
[27:49.000 --> 27:59.000]  So that's telling us that we're probably going to be needing to prioritize boosters for older and more vulnerable people coming up soon, especially at this new birth.
[27:59.000 --> 28:09.000]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[28:09.000 --> 28:25.000]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[28:25.000 --> 28:37.000]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[28:37.000 --> 28:42.000]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[28:42.000 --> 28:49.000]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  So what are you waiting for?
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  Go to the N4 store.
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  Never been a better time than right now.
[28:55.000 --> 29:02.000]  Super male vitality at N4store.com.
[29:02.000 --> 29:08.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[29:10.000 --> 29:16.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization and absurdity.
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[29:21.000 --> 29:33.000]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product. The XQ does wonders. They recommend it to everybody. You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the N4.
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year. Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.000]  Honored to talk to you.
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  Awesome.
[29:40.000 --> 29:52.000]  So first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29. If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom. So just number one for a few of you.
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  I think that only works. It's not a joke.
[29:54.000 --> 30:21.000]  Absolutely.
[30:24.000 --> 30:36.000]  They only got them back in stock, the highest rated. They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off, $14.95. They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[30:36.000 --> 30:49.000]  We've got a private label for them for wars on them for $14.95 because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these quote smartphones really are.
[30:49.000 --> 30:58.000]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use. It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal global system. They're 50% off right now.
[30:58.000 --> 31:20.000]  At m4warstore.com.
[31:20.000 --> 31:42.000]  A digital frontier. I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer. What did they look like? Chips, motorcycles. Where the circuits like freeways. I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see.
[31:42.000 --> 31:54.000]  And then one day, and then one day, I got in.
[31:54.000 --> 32:13.000]  Well, I'm here to tell you, I got into Satan's mind. Thanks to God. And I know more than most of the minions of the system that have a good idea what they're building, but are delusional. I've got the big picture and so do you. And our goal is to give the general public the big picture of the nightmare system that's being built for them and their families.
[32:13.000 --> 32:28.000]  And that compliance with this means death, enslavement, humiliation and separation from God. And that resistance to this is the animating contest of liberty that God designed us for that will elevate us to the next level.
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.000]  So this is the big challenge.
[32:32.000 --> 32:38.000]  So we got to keep our chins up. We got to stay focused and we got to ask God to lead God and direct us.
[32:38.000 --> 32:48.000]  Okay, I got Robert Barnes, I'm a host of issues joining us next hour. I need to judiciously get through as much of this as I can before that happens.
[32:48.000 --> 33:01.000]  And then we do have some of those medical doctors that have filed the emergency lawsuit over all the different secret recording systems of deaths that they're saying are in 40 plus thousand just in the first week of the vaccines in the US, which I believe those numbers,
[33:01.000 --> 33:09.000]  because we know that only one out of 40 bars gets reported bears and that's it. That's it. 13,000 now.
[33:09.000 --> 33:16.000]  Most of those are physician reported. So those guys are on the show Friday.
[33:16.000 --> 33:29.000]  And we have some other experts joining us tomorrow as well. And I also have Dr. Yedon, the former chief scientist at Pfizer, who just retired three years ago, very prestigious, saying this is a crime against humanity.
[33:29.000 --> 33:35.000]  He's made new statements. He said this is crimes against humanity. This is a global depopulation operation.
[33:35.000 --> 33:49.000]  This is purposely to make everybody sick and collapse civilization for a great reset. So now Dr. Yedon has come out since he came out in December with Wolfgang Wudarg, the chief advisor to the European Union Medical Board,
[33:49.000 --> 33:59.000]  and said, OK, it's confirmed. They did it on purpose. This is the greatest crime in history. And this is designed to collapse society as a weapon, of course.
[33:59.000 --> 34:08.000]  I mean, you don't do something like this unless you're planning to plot all the stops. And as soon as we try to arrest them, they'll activate the race war squads they've got.
[34:08.000 --> 34:14.000]  We've got to not kill each other. We're black or white or brown or whatever. We've got to see through that. We've got to come together as well.
[34:14.000 --> 34:29.000]  I mean, this is their big move, ladies and gentlemen. This is it. And I see the sad left going. We're with the science. We're with Fauci. Fauci's a corrupt bureaucrat, a eugenicist with Bill Gates.
[34:29.000 --> 34:40.000]  But let me stop. The bad news is these people are out of control and evil, and they've triggered their operation, and they can't even reverse it at this point. The fight's on.
[34:40.000 --> 34:58.000]  The good news is we know their whole plan. We've been studying it. And now, because Info Wars was able to be the genesis with our research and a few other experts that understood things, 17, 18 months ago, we were able to get ahead of this thing.
[34:58.000 --> 35:12.000]  And then a lot of top scientists and researchers looked at what we were saying and then applied their incredible gravitas to it and concurred and even found more than obviously we'd found. And so we weren't caught flatfooted like the enemy wanted.
[35:12.000 --> 35:23.000]  They've launched their attack. I would say a billion people are going to die very slowly now. I mean, we're seeing biblical stuff unfold. It's just unbelievable. There's no going back now.
[35:23.000 --> 35:36.000]  I mean, look at these stacks of articles. None of this is here as a prop. This is not meant to impress people. Every one of these is an incredible story. I spent a whole hour just on this report, five pages long.
[35:36.000 --> 35:46.000]  Former Pfizer VP destroys media hit piece, attacking his warnings about COVID injection, a pack of lies. That's a nice headline. That's the headline they put out when he was interviewed.
[35:46.000 --> 35:56.000]  The real headline is says that it's crimes against humanity confirmed depopulation. This one article.
[35:56.000 --> 36:08.000]  And then I read the other accompanying articles that go with it. So just imagine what's what's in here. Total proof that Fauci lied and called it gain of function when he funded it and gave speeches bragging saying he's proud of funding gain of function.
[36:08.000 --> 36:20.000]  We have that video. We have six or seven of them. And we've aired them before, but he just told Congress that's preposterous and that Rand Paul's a liar.
[36:20.000 --> 36:34.000]  I have more proof of lies. He said 99% of the people dying of COVID are dying because they weren't inoculated. And then I went to the AP report. There is no link. There is nothing.
[36:34.000 --> 36:44.000]  They said they looked at private information Fauci gave them that won't be published. Well, guess what? I actually have the reporting services of the UK of the EU and the US.
[36:44.000 --> 36:53.000]  And you know what? It's above 50% in almost every index were actually vaccinated that are dying that they're saying COVID. They're trying to suppress it.
[36:53.000 --> 37:07.000]  So when you hear 99.2%, like Fauci said, he pulled that out of the Rockefeller Foundation's rear end because they tell him what to say. That's on record.
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  And I'm not trying to impress you here. You need to go research this all yourself. But how many times did I tell you?
[37:12.000 --> 37:23.000]  Rockefeller Foundation runs Gates, runs Fauci. And now they said, step aside, boys, because they're losing right now. They've launched their attack, but they know it's not going well. They're like, step aside.
[37:23.000 --> 37:32.000]  Now the big boys stood up. And believe me, they're hovering over the button to have me kill. They're like, you kill him. It's going to make him bigger. Don't do it.
[37:32.000 --> 37:45.000]  They're having debates in their boardrooms. And that's fine because you're all going to be dead soon too anyways. So I'm talking about all the listeners. You guys are our rightful gods. You're going to kill us, right?
[37:45.000 --> 37:57.000]  We're all just going to bend over and take it. George Soros, by the way, just merged with Bill Gates Foundation to take control of world COVID testing. Of course.
[37:57.000 --> 38:07.000]  Oh, just like Laura Sillsby got caught kidnapping all those kids for Hillary Clinton got convicted, changed her name and now she heads up Amber Alert. Of course you do.
[38:07.000 --> 38:20.000]  Of course you do. Let me let me control myself and come back in the next segment. It's a long segment and hit the lockdown in Australia, which is the same thing already happening in Canada.
[38:20.000 --> 38:27.000]  It's the same thing coming back to the UK and Europe. It's the model because the Australians are good people and the globalists have taken over.
[38:27.000 --> 38:35.000]  So they have a so-called conservative leader doing it to them sending a Boris Johnson. It's all set up. They're announcing the lockdowns, the mask, because they weren't good. It didn't take their shots.
[38:35.000 --> 38:44.000]  They've had 10 people die this year from COVID, but not one person's allowed to die, even though thousands commit suicide or anything else.
[38:44.000 --> 38:58.000]  What's absurd? They want it to be absurd. They want it to be absolutely asinine and to not make any sense.
[38:58.000 --> 39:06.000]  That's how they operate. That's how the globalists rule over us is they just get us to suspend logic and then just see headlines.
[39:06.000 --> 39:17.000]  The German government gave 30,000 children to convicted pedophiles so they could rape them. Mainstream news. Strip to you three times.
[39:17.000 --> 39:23.000]  Even the New Yorker tells you about it. I mean, these are sick, sick people. How many years ago did I tell you about that?
[39:23.000 --> 39:31.000]  I told you about that 10 years ago about Germany. That's the socialists for you. They are devils. They drain the energy off children.
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.000]  They drain the energy of the innocent in dark crystal. It's all in allegory.
[39:36.000 --> 39:44.000]  I'm going to go to break. I'm going to ask you all to remember that you make this broadcast possible when you go to mypelo.com and use promo code Alex.
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.000]  You get up to 66% off the best discounts. There are. They have a lot of promo codes, but ours is the best.
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.000]  That's the deal I struck where I get a little less money. So does Lindell, but you get the very best deals.
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.000]  He goes to stores. They want 50%. Well, I'm not asking for that. I'm asking for a much smaller percent. That way you get more of a savings.
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.000]  Lindell obliged. I said, I want the best affiliate deal you've got. He said, OK, it's this one.
[40:07.000 --> 40:14.000]  66% off up to that. It's like 25 on the lowest deal up to 66. On average, it's about half off.
[40:14.000 --> 40:21.000]  Mypelo.com and promo code Alex gets you the very best deal at Mypelo.com and all their products.
[40:21.000 --> 40:29.000]  And X2 is still available in the dropper bottle at 40% off. It's the deep earth crystal iodine for your stamina, your libido.
[40:29.000 --> 40:35.000]  But more importantly, your immune system, every cell, it's the opposite of fluoride. It's why they bomb you with fluoride and try to keep this from you.
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.000]  It is such a game changer. It is so amazing. I've got the libido of when I was a 16 year old because of X2.
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.000]  I mean, I got on this stuff eight years ago and I was like, my God, why wasn't I told about this earlier?
[40:47.000 --> 40:55.000]  I'm a teenager again. Infowarsstore.com and it funds the Info War. Have we not delivered? Are we not the place to support?
[40:55.000 --> 41:18.000]  We are. We love you. We're in this together.
[41:25.000 --> 41:33.000]  Mypelo.com and all the great products he's got and all the thousands of employees he has hired America because he's doing God's work.
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  And at the same time, he's funding Infowars. That's right.
[41:36.000 --> 41:45.000]  We use promo code Alex at checkout up to 60% off on the best selling sheets and towels and the new beds he's got.
[41:45.000 --> 41:52.000]  And the pillows, of course, everything up to 60% off with promo code Alex at checkout at Mypelo.com
[41:52.000 --> 41:59.000]  and you fund his great work and our great work at Infowars, a 360 win. Mypelo.com promo code Alex.
[41:59.000 --> 42:09.000]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on and that its criminals are extremely pathological.
[42:09.000 --> 42:18.000]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[42:18.000 --> 42:29.000]  Well guess what? It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenistist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with ACT and other chemicals
[42:29.000 --> 42:40.000]  that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[42:40.000 --> 42:46.000]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[42:46.000 --> 42:53.000]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system,
[42:53.000 --> 43:19.000]  basically giving you the equivalent of HIV. That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[43:19.000 --> 43:45.000]  All of these things are so incredible for your health. Just one of these ingredients can be a life changing supplement for your health and we've packed it all in to fibergreencaps at infowarstore.com.
[43:45.000 --> 43:55.000]  I decided to add this to my supplement routine every day. I suggest that you do the same thing and right now it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[43:55.000 --> 44:17.000]  33% off at infowarstore.com.
[44:25.000 --> 44:36.000]  It's been an incredible experience to work with you over the years and as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[44:36.000 --> 44:44.000]  But again that's really up to you and up to God. So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[44:44.000 --> 44:55.000]  But again that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[44:55.000 --> 45:21.000]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support infowarstore. God bless.
[45:21.000 --> 45:30.000]  In fact, the Alex Jones show, we're about to show you with documents with the actual studies he funded with his name on the top of the line in charge.
[45:30.000 --> 45:38.000]  The buck stops with him, Fauci, and videos. There's a bunch of videos. We'll just play one of them endorsing game of function and saying it's good to do.
[45:38.000 --> 45:48.000]  And then doing it and then lying to Congress. It's a huge scandal in 2015. They had to move it from Chapel Hill, North Carolina over to Wuhan, China to get away with it.
[45:48.000 --> 45:54.000]  He's just up there bigger than Dallas saying we've got all the experts in the entire program signing off on it.
[45:54.000 --> 46:04.000]  Oh, you mean auditor fraud, manager fraud? The first thing the FBI back when it did half its job with WCAT is the CEOs and the controllers engaged in fraud.
[46:04.000 --> 46:10.000]  You mean you had Peter Dasik and Lanzik not have his name on it, but write a whole study saying it didn't come out of Wuhan?
[46:10.000 --> 46:19.000]  You mean you're in control of the whole cover up while you're in control of the vaccines and control of the censorship, you little monster?
[46:19.000 --> 46:31.000]  But next hour I'm going to get more into this. In Australia, you remember in Canada two weeks ago they said we don't want to ever have the end of martial law because people talk in the street and then they want to oppose us.
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.000]  Well, now the Australian government officially said do not talk to people.
[46:36.000 --> 46:43.000]  Don't even look at people that will spread COVID so you don't even talk cult members when you're outside your house.
[46:43.000 --> 46:58.000]  I mean this is a direct communist authoritarian beyond Hitler, beyond Stalin, beyond Mao attempt by this behavioral psychologist gang rape assault with big corporations they've launched on us.
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.000]  I mean this is redonkulous.
[47:01.000 --> 47:07.000]  So we'll play that next hour, but in case you're doubting me, here's a little bit of it. Go ahead.
[47:07.000 --> 47:18.000]  Whilst it isn't human nature to engage in conversation with others, to be friendly, unfortunately, this is not the time to do that.
[47:18.000 --> 47:31.000]  So even if you run into your next door neighbour in the shopping centre, in the Coles Wars or Aldi or any other grocery shop, don't start up a conversation.
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.000]  Now is the time for minimising your interactions with others.
[47:35.000 --> 47:40.000]  Even if you've got a mask, do not think that affords total protection.
[47:40.000 --> 47:49.000]  We want to be absolutely sure that as we go about our daily lives, we do not come into contact with anyone else that would pose a risk.
[47:49.000 --> 47:54.000]  Ten people have died in Australia supposedly from COVID. This is a total takeover.
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.000]  She says, I know it's in your human nature. It's about getting you out of your human nature, teaching you you're dirty.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  What kills you is bacterial pneumonia wearing the mask.
[48:01.000 --> 48:05.000]  Top health officer, she's the top health officer, that's coming up.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  Orders Australians, don't have conversations.
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  Without you, go jump off a cliff. We're not going to hurt you, lady.
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  But if humans are so bad, you know, the next thing is stop breathing, just kill yourselves.
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  You know, don't talk to people, stay in your house, commit suicide.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  What about the thousands of suicides in Australia on top of their previous record?
[48:22.000 --> 48:28.000]  This is sick. This is to see what you'll put up with to beta test for the rest of the world.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  Good God.
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.000]  Remember in the UK, they said, don't look at people and wear your mask in the swimming pool.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  The Spanish police said, wear your mask in the ocean.
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.000]  It's all an exercise in martial law, making you the dirty person, making you the criminal.
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.000]  It's all a Milgram psychological experiment.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  Now, you saw the exchange yesterday.
[48:49.000 --> 48:57.000]  We've got a clip of it of Rand Paul doctor walking Fauci into perjury, which he's done.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  We're going to play a little compilation of that exchange here in a moment.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  The full exchange is like eight minutes long. It's on infowars.com.
[49:03.000 --> 49:10.000]  But Fauci was shaking. He got really mad. He didn't know what to do because he's being called out on their illegal program.
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  He runs the whole damn thing on.
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  And so this is the beginning of the end for these guys.
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.000]  They're conflicts of interest. They're suppressing their censorship.
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.000]  Fauci controlling so much the funding in the country and the world through Bill Gates and intimidating science.
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  This isn't science. This is pure intimidation.
[49:26.000 --> 49:31.000]  And Michael Crichton put out an excellent diagram of all this that we have time before he died.
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  I want to get to pseudo science versus real science.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  Guys, I can't find that in the stack. We reprint me.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  The Michael Crichton graphic. Thank you.
[49:38.000 --> 49:46.000]  So right now let's go to Fauci in 2012 at a dinner at a conference promoting gain of function that he was funding.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  Here it is.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  Of a catastrophic pandemic.
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  This is not a theoretical danger. It is a real danger.
[49:53.000 --> 50:03.000]  For decades, NIH has supported basic influenza research included on transmissibility, host adaptation and virulence.
[50:03.000 --> 50:12.000]  The goal is to anticipate what the virus is continually trying to do on its own in the wild and to prepare for it.
[50:12.000 --> 50:27.000]  Such goals were pursued by the NIH funded scientists Kawaioka and Fushay and could have important positive implications for pandemic influenza prediction, prevention, diagnosis and treatment.
[50:27.000 --> 50:38.000]  Kawaioka and Fushay constructed variants of H5N1 avian influenza in order to identify which genetic mutations might alter the transmissibility of the virus.
[50:38.000 --> 50:45.000]  In their studies, they employed a standard influenza animal model, namely the ferret.
[50:45.000 --> 50:55.000]  This slide shows the basic design of the experiments in which the virus was modified to allow for aerosol transmission from one ferret to another.
[50:55.000 --> 51:12.000]  I might point out that one of the causes of the public misunderstanding was the widespread belief that the virus that was transmitted by aerosol from one ferret to another actually killed the ferrets, when in fact, that was not the case.
[51:12.000 --> 51:27.000]  We feel that these studies provide critical information and it was important to determine if H5N1 virus that has this enhanced transmissibility would remain sensitive to existing anti-influenza drugs and vaccines.
[51:27.000 --> 51:39.000]  In addition, and importantly, knowledge of the genetic mutations that facilitate transmission may be critical for global surveillance of emerging influenza viruses.
[51:39.000 --> 51:45.000]  So they bring in the global problem. They release it now. They're the global solution.
[51:45.000 --> 51:51.000]  By the way, I sent somebody close to the crew. That's one in Congress. I'd sent another one of him at a dinner saying, yeah, it's getting a function.
[51:51.000 --> 51:57.000]  So we'll play that next hour. The point is, is that he's all over the place saying, and that's classic gain of function right there.
[51:57.000 --> 52:03.000]  He just told Congress he's never been involved in any of it, though he just funded and supported and ran that. Put him in prison right there.
[52:03.000 --> 52:08.000]  Here is the exchange with him perjuring himself yesterday in front of Senator Rampol.
[52:08.000 --> 52:16.000]  Dr. Fauci, as you are aware, it is a crime to lie to Congress. It's a felony and a five-year penalty for lying to Congress.
[52:16.000 --> 52:24.000]  You stated that the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain of function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[52:24.000 --> 52:33.000]  And yet, gain of function research was done entirely in the Wuhan Institute by Dr. Xi and was funded by the NIH.
[52:33.000 --> 52:42.000]  In this paper, Dr. Xi credits the NIH and lists the actual number of the grant that she was given by the NIH.
[52:42.000 --> 52:55.000]  In this paper, she took two-bat coronavirus genes, spike genes, and combined them with a SARS-related backbone to create new viruses that are not found in nature.
[52:55.000 --> 53:06.000]  These lab-created viruses were then to be shown to replicate in humans. These experiments combined genetic information from different coronaviruses that infect animals,
[53:06.000 --> 53:13.000]  but not humans, to create novel artificial viruses able to infect human cells.
[53:13.000 --> 53:22.000]  Viruses that in nature only infect animals were manipulated in the Wuhan lab to gain the function of infecting humans.
[53:22.000 --> 53:29.000]  Dr. Richard E. Bright, a molecular biologist from Rutgers, described this research in Wuhan as,
[53:29.000 --> 53:40.000]  the Wuhan lab used NIH funding to construct novel, chimeric, SARS-related coronaviruses able to infect human cells and laboratory animals.
[53:40.000 --> 53:49.000]  This is high-risk research that creates new potential pandemic pathogens that exist only in the lab, not in nature.
[53:49.000 --> 54:01.000]  This research matches, these are Dr. E. Bright's words, this research matches indeed epitomizes the definition of gain-of-function research done entirely in Wuhan,
[54:01.000 --> 54:05.000]  for which there was supposed to be a federal pause.
[54:05.000 --> 54:16.000]  Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?
[54:16.000 --> 54:23.000]  Senator Paul, I have never lied before the Congress, and I do not retract that statement.
[54:23.000 --> 54:34.000]  This paper that you were referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function.
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  Let me finish.
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.000]  Shut up, murderer.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  And you increased the responsibility to humans.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  You're saying that's not gain-of-function?
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  That is correct, and Senator Paul, you do not know what you are talking about, quite frankly.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  Yeah, we do.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  We're going to say that officially.
[54:49.000 --> 54:52.000]  You do not know what you are talking about.
[54:52.000 --> 54:59.000]  You're dancing around this because you're trying to obscure responsibility for 4 million people dying around COVID from a pandemic.
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.000]  It is molecularly impossible.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  No one's saying those viruses caused it.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  It is molecularly...
[55:06.000 --> 55:17.000]  I'm going to come back to this. He then talks about how they grabbed all these wild viruses and trying to say that Senator Paul, Dr. Paul, is saying those did this.
[55:17.000 --> 55:27.000]  No, you got them and combined them, and your own program head, Peter Dasek, said that to develop an all-in-one vaccine.
[55:27.000 --> 55:36.000]  She's going to be the heroes once you release this on us. You'll never get away with it, Fauci. You've launched your mad scientist attack. You've turned us all into guinea pigs.
[55:36.000 --> 55:43.000]  Hey, great! But like Tyrants always learned, you get that big slug in and you wake up the tiger. You wake up the dragon.
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  You're going to get your ass politically stomped in.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  We'll be right back.
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome. Go ahead.
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[55:55.000 --> 55:56.000]  Good, bro.
[55:56.000 --> 56:05.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements. It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization, and absurdity.
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[56:10.000 --> 56:16.000]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products. The X2 does wonders.
[56:16.000 --> 56:22.000]  They recommend it to everybody. You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the ample work.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  Tyler in Maine. You're on the year. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  Honored talk to you.
[56:28.000 --> 56:37.000]  Awesome. So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products. Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half, she loves it.
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.000]  And it helps in the bedroom. So, just number one for a few of you.
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  Well, it definitely works. It's not a joke.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  Absolutely.
[56:44.000 --> 56:59.000]  The Bios security state is here. It's an anti-human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty, bad and evil.
[56:59.000 --> 57:07.000]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same,
[57:07.000 --> 57:14.000]  has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out into 2024.
[57:14.000 --> 57:21.000]  And that in 2024, you will again take two shots. And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[57:21.000 --> 57:27.000]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates. They're now implementing it.
[57:27.000 --> 57:31.000]  And now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[57:31.000 --> 57:38.000]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor,
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  And bullwars will continue to set fast. They fight this. I don't know how long we can.
[57:44.000 --> 58:10.000]  The enemy's coming for us all now. God bless and good luck. I would again get right with God right now.
[58:10.000 --> 58:18.000]  All right. They put another clip earlier of Fauci in Congress submitting a function, but we found the clip of him at a quote,
[58:18.000 --> 58:23.000]  gain of function conference saying, I like a function. This guy is in a lot of trouble.
[58:23.000 --> 58:31.000]  But here first is a couple of great clips from Tucker Carlson, our ambassador to the mainstream media to get the truth out.
[58:31.000 --> 58:40.000]  He's dealing with the demonization of the unvaccinated, the demonization of asking questions. And then I'm going to come back with some other huge breaking news.
[58:40.000 --> 58:45.000]  And then Robert Barnes is going to be joining us. Please spread the word about this live show. You are the resistance.
[58:45.000 --> 58:54.000]  That's your birthright. For example, schools across the country are now forcing children to take the vaccine as a condition of their education.
[58:54.000 --> 58:59.000]  So is that a good idea? Is it rooted in science? We should know the answer to that. Why wouldn't we know the answer to that?
[58:59.000 --> 59:05.000]  Before we can answer that question, we need to know how many young people are dying from COVID. Okay, let's go to the CDC website.
[59:05.000 --> 59:14.000]  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 335 Americans under the age of 18 have died from coronavirus in this country.
[59:14.000 --> 59:24.000]  That's the number. But what does that number mean exactly? The CDC did not provide any specific information on the circumstances of those deaths.
[59:24.000 --> 59:32.000]  And the circumstances can be all important. So researchers at Johns Hopkins led by Dr. Marty McCary looked closely at those numbers and what they actually meant.
[59:32.000 --> 59:40.000]  And here's what they found, quote, a mortality rate of zero among children without a preexisting medical condition such as leukemia.
[59:40.000 --> 59:46.000]  Oh, leukemia is a very serious underlying medical condition.
[59:46.000 --> 59:56.000]  So does that mean that no one under 18, without a serious underlying medical condition, died from COVID? Seems that way.
[59:56.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  So then is it as a matter of science and public policy necessary to force every child, including the millions without preexisting conditions, to get vaccines and wear masks all day?
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  What about adults who already have had COVID? There are millions of those.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  The Johns Hopkins researchers found the CDC is barely doing anything to answer that question.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  The CDC's reports on rates of natural immunity and what that immunity means and whether people who have it should get the vaccine or benefit from it in any way or need it.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  McCary's team noted that that guidance is, quote, outdated, outdated, really a year and a half into this pandemic.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  These are relevant and vital questions. They are hardly denial of anything. They're the opposite. They are a search for truth.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  An open-minded one, a relentless one that will not be shamed into science.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  It's the American birthright.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  That is what science is.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  Asking questions of birthright.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  We should not allow ourselves to be bullied by political forces into ignoring obvious questions.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  So the left's moral measurements pretty clear. Good people follow coronal law. Abediently, evil people don't.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  Former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sibelius just made this announcement.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  I think that it's time to say to those folks, it's fine. If you don't choose to get vaccinated, you may not come to work.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  You may not have access to a situation where you're going to put my grandchildren in jeopardy, where you might kill them,
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  where you might put them in a situation where they're going to carry the virus to someone in a high-risk position.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  That's, I think, the point where we are, is freedom is one thing, but freedom when you harm others like second-hand smoke and issues that we've dealt with very clearly in the past.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  You can't drive drunk. You can drink, but you can't drive drunk because you can injure other people.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  Freedom is one thing.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  Weird how many vaccinated people seem to be spreading the virus at this point. So maybe it's not as simple as unvaccinated bad, vaccinated virtuous.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  Maybe it's a disease, not a moral category. Maybe you should be quiet, Kathleen Sibelius. You're an idiot.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  There are a lot of idiots. The main anchor at the most watched local television station in the country, WABC in New York.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  Bill Ritter just wrote this in a Facebook post.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Anyone who hasn't gotten vaccinated and is medically able to get it, stay away from me and have the decency to let people know you're not inoculated by putting a sign on your neck.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  Whoa, we're a little badge.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Oh, by the way, Nancy Pelosi has been lecturing us for months now about how we're immoral if we don't wear masks and get the vaccines.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  And that looks like members of her staff who wore masks and got the vaccine, got corona anyway from those fleeing Texas legislature.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  Makes you wonder if what Pelosi has been saying about masks and vaccines is actually science, doesn't it?
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  The rest of us ought to be careful not to what you're talking about.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the Infowars War Room.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  And I am very excited about our latest supplement edition to InfowarsStore.com.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfowarsStore.com.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  Listen to this. Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  And we've packed it all in to fibergreencaps at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  I suggest that you do the same thing.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  And right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  That's 33% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  Welcome back. We're now into our number two constitutional lawyer.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  Good friend of mine, Robert Barnes will cover the waterfront with us.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  This so-called indictment of Barrick, one of Trump's confidants for lobbying.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  We're going to get into the election fraud information coming up.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  Trump's big tech lawsuit.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Is it targeting the right things?
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  A lot of lawyers I've talked to, including Barnes and others, think no.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  I mean, they can always amend it.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  We're going to be talking about that.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  And I'll be talking about the most inoculations and the second lockdowns and all the things that are happening with Robert Barnes here in just a few minutes.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  But I wanted to play you a clip because I've seen a lot of attacks in the media against myself and against quote, anti-vaxxers who are saying that, oh, it's because you won't take the shots that it's quote still spreading.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  No, they just set the PCR test however they want.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  For example, the die of automobile accidents and gunshot wounds have died of COVID.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  When Biden guts worn in on January 20th, they had the NIH and the CDC turned the COVID testing systems from 40 cycles down to 30, meaning you're not going to have any positives.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  Now they've ordered reportedly people to turn them back up.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  So because they want lockdowns again.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  This is a fraud.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  This is a fraud.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  So I thought that I would show those of you out there because I see the left saying, oh, the right wingers not taking their shots.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  Even though a lot of left wingers aren't either.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  They're experimental shots.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  It's their fault.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  Lockdowns are coming again because they are spreading it.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  Well, like if you're protected, if there's so-called shop protection, because in the past, vaccines are attenuated viruses or bacteria and they have side effects, but they do work.
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  So if you, if this is a real vaccine and worked, it'd be great, but see, they're now saying it's a therapeutic.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  They want the 10 shots a year.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  Trudeau's announcing that.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  The head UK researcher over their main science facility says, oh, this actually lowers your immunity, but that's okay.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  We'll just give you monthly shots.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  That's all coming up.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  I mean, this is huge.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  The admission it doesn't work.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  It's not a vaccine.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  It's a gene therapy that gets rid of your immune system.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  Holy hell.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  And by the way, that's not even tonight.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  I found this video last night of the head scientist over all these programs at Pfizer for the UK government that's doing the testing on what happens to those that take the shots.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  He's like, yeah, it reduces your immune system the first time you take it to one six of what it was and you'll need vaccines the rest of your life of whatever Pfizer comes up with.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Oh, that's not a context. I went and read the studies that he heads up at the most prestigious facility in the UK.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  Probably the world.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  Let me just give you the name of it since we're on that.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  The Francis Crick Institute.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  Formerly the UK's bio weapons facilities.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  They're Fort Dietrich, Maryland.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  But now there's a Francis Crick name, the discoverer of DNA, along with the Watson guy that says Blackstar and humans.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  So this is a really nice group of people here.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  Of course, they really say none of us are humans but them, unless you're a sociopath or psychopath.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  So, so here's a clip compilation of old Alex Jones back in early 2020, right through into early 2021, telling you what was coming.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  See, I didn't just say more lockdowns are coming. The vaccines won't work.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  It's a fraud. It's a program.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  I already know.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  I'm not guessing.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  I'm not that smart.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  Here it is.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  They have never guessed the right flu virus for the mutation of what the main flu is the next year.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  And it's always a whole bunch of flues, dozens and dozens of them.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  And then it does nothing to protect you from the next flu if it's not the exact flu.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  That's why they never asked why they don't have a vaccine for the common cold because it's too varied because there's thousands of them.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  And because you have to get it exactly right.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  And viruses are always mutating.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  But you notice they're telling you they've got a vaccine.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  They want you willingly to go take whatever it is that's going to be in there.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  Now Fauci has come out.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  If you just joined us, we're going to play the clip again first here in a moment and said, hey, we're going to surveil people.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  We're going to cycle into other seasons next year.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  You won't be able to go out either.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  So they'll run into the middle of summer and then let you have a month or two and then clamp it back down.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  But there'll be special apps.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  They're announcing you'll be tracked.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  China was the model.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  They're going to roll it out like they just got these ideas, but it's all preplanned by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  Belomelina Gates, the tabletop exercises predicting COVID-19 in November when it was already launched in China.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  I think all of you already instinctively know this is the big one.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  And if we fail this test, we're going to be ruled by the threat of unending invisible bio weapons.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  They're going to tighten down the restrictions, loosen them by the summer and then release new strains immediately
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  that aren't even as bad as the current strain.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  They'll say they're worse, fearmonger, and then clamp down even stronger.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  That's what they've done in Italy.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  It's what they've done in other areas where they've been beta testing like Spain and now moving towards Australia.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  So this is all formulaic.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  It's all heavily scripted.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  And we know they're playing.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  By the way, if you think that's hardcore prediction, all coming true.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  I have war games so much.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  I see it backwards and forwards.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  That's why I'm not bragging.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  I know like not just General Flynn, former head of defense intelligence, listens and says,
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  I'm about one of the smartest people he knows.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  The agencies all listen around the world because I'm able to integrate all this together and then put out a bull done analysis of it.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  And man, last night I was in on a brainstorm that was insane.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  Had to have a cup of coffee since about two o'clock during the day.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  Had dinner, hadn't been drinking.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  I was here as the clearest blue sky.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  And I saw the whole operation.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  And now I'm just trying to process the next leg of it to try to tell you what's coming next.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  But anybody that's immersed themselves in this would know it.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  We're going to break them up with Robert Barnes for resting hour constitutional lawyer.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  It is take on the code and roll out how we fight how we stop it.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  But Australia today the world tomorrow the globalist minutes their model Australian PM says and vaccinated people need to be controlled and restricted.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  That's what they're all saying anger in Australia is almost half a population lockdown yet again amid slow vaccine rollout.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  So see you won't take your shot you're locked down again.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  But they admit that almost no one's died 10 people last six months lockdowns mass mandates and new vaccine rules.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  Here's the latest coming 19 news across Australia.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  See it never ends once you submit once you get into it.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  This cult of scientists are into power. They will never let you out of the trap.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  Australia under lockdown sees worrying jump in covid cases not death just their fake PCR machine.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  I mean you think of Las Vegas slot machines rig.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  Australian leaders are also saying that here she is covid deaths in entire continent of Australia.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  In the last 30 days are three.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  But most of them had heart attacks cancer you name it.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  It's not even real.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  But here she is.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  Let's play a clip of her again.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Top health officer orders Australians don't have a conversation with each other.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  What did the head health minister in Canada say two weeks ago.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  He said we don't want people to have rallies.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  We want the lockdown to continue so they don't demonstrate and organize against us.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  They're externalizing the method.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  They're so normal in this that they're establishing a dictatorship that they're just saying don't talk to your neighbor.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  Burn in hell.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  The suicides are in the millions now.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Millions of died from non medical treatment insurance companies love that.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  I'll give a treatment.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  I mean this is mass murder.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  But here they are.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  Oh using a woman is always the front group because we genetically don't see a woman as an assaulter as a soldier.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  She is a soldier.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  So in Canada in Alberta in Australia it's all happening.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  Here she is the cult leader saying don't talk to your neighbor till you've taken your secret shot and then that's not even good enough.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  Still wear your mask.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  Here it is.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  Whilst it isn't human nature to engage in conversation with others to be friendly.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  Unfortunately this is not the time to do that.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  So even if you run into your next door neighbor in the shopping centre in the Coles wars or Aldi or any other grocery shop don't start up a conversation.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  Now is the time for minimizing your interactions with others.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Even if you've got a mask do not think that affords total protection.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  Be absolutely sure that as we go about our daily lives we do not come into contact with anyone else that would pose a risk.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  So that's what President Eisenhower said back when he was president in 1960 in a famous speech to college students.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  You look it up.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  For what college?
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  It was like Columbia.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  You can pull it up.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  President Eisenhower on freedom.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  He said I can make you all completely free and set or no freedom versus safety.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  He said Eisenhower on freedom versus slavery.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  And he said I can make you all 100% safe. You'll be slaves. I can lock you up in a tiny jail cell.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  And so that's what this is.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  It's literally we can't let one person die from this.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  We have little robot testers that are fraudulent that will tell you.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  And now Bill Gates and George Soros are buying up all the COVID testing companies.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  They'll have the database on your name, your healthcare and they can block you through the social credit score through the COVID.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  I mean, figured it out yet. Stay with us.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Your voice counts.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go when we do.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate,
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  When I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage,
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off, $14.95.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  We've got a private label for them for $14.95 because I want you to get them
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  and I want you to buy friends and family of these systems to educate them about
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  what these, quote, smart phones really are.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  Orson slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system,
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  It's been said that sometimes we lose the forest for the trees.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  Robert Barnes is a friend of mine, great constitutional lawyer, really even better historian.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  I study a lot and most folks don't know as much as I do.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  He always impresses me, he knows as much as I know and a lot of times more.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  He's not an infighter, but he called me up yesterday, a little pissed off at Black Rifle Coffee Company
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  for just their attack on Rittenhouse and said screw our Second Amendment supporters.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  And he said, you know, how would you like to get Rittenhouse's mom and focus on trying to support him?
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  We'll do that next week after that. We're looking forward to that.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  But we'll talk about that coming up next segment.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  But it's bigger than just Black Rifle Coffee Company because I sell coffee, I'm not in a pissing contest with them,
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  that their coffee is good coffee.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  It's that this cut and run by conservatives and nationalists and veterans when the New York Times calls up and says,
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  disavow your base. It just seems politically, culturally, economically suicidal.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  So we'll talk about the next segment.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  Speaking of suicide, Barnes, you were on over a year ago and you predicted this is not a vaccine that teaches you immunity.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  This is a drug because given somebody an attenuated virus, a dead virus, a dead bacteria,
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  that's not really a drug, that's introducing the pathogen and that's a real science.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  It's got pitfalls, it's got side effects, it's got problems, but it works.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  Most of the time. This is something totally different.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  Like you said, they just put it in your body, call the vaccine.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  Now the head scientist over the UK studies admits it gets rid of your immune system, reduces it to one sixth of what it was.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  My God, seeing all this come out, lockdown twos, all of it, they've really, I think, bitten off more than they could chew.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  And I'm not an overconfident person and things are bad.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  But I think they tried to commit a crime so big that they thought they'd get away with it.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  But I think you commit a crime so big it destroys everything you do go down.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  I think they've made a Hitler gamble here, like invading Russia and Operation Barbarossa.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  I do not see them getting out of this.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  Barnes, I think you muted your mic or somebody did it.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  I don't know why that happens. I apologize to start over. Go ahead.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  Can you hear me now?
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  Sure can. Go ahead.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  What you have is a situation where, take the first six months of the peak of this virus in the United States,
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  the number of people that died from this, that were healthy, that didn't have other comorbidities,
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  was somewhere around 25,000 people, according to the government's own data.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  And there's arguments about that.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  But look at what we have in the first six months of the vaccine, according to the government's own database of people reporting in,
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  reporting it under penalty of perjury, what injuries have been suffered, close to half a million already,
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  in serious injuries being reported by people under penalty of perjury related to the vaccine.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  And at the same time, we're seeing all around the world vaccinated people just recently in Texas.
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  Those Texas Democrats, they were all vaccinated, they went to DC, came back, and a whole bunch of them have COVID.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  So the fact that this vaccine doesn't appear to actually function as a vaccine, more as a therapeutic, as a drug,
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  that simply mitigates the rate of transmission, mitigates the severity of the consequences,
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  but doesn't appear to actually preclude transmission or immunize the body against anything.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  And when you combine that with the number of self-reported injuries,
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  this is the highest number of reported injuries in American history related to a vaccine.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  And the media is doing a great job suppressing this, smearing what VAERS reporting data shows.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  But we're already almost at half a million in six months, serious injuries being reported,
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  and almost everybody agrees that that underreports the data.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  There's all kinds of people who don't know there's a connection, don't know there's a correlation,
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  don't know there's causation involved.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  We've opened the phones up, almost everyone has family members that die or have strokes or heart attacks,
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  and none of them want to complain, none of them want to say it was a vaccine.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  So the estimates are between 10%, you know, one out of 10 reported, maybe one out of 100, the estimates vary.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  So obviously it's much bigger.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  No doubt. I mean, you're seeing more consequences.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  If you're healthy, you're seeing far more consequences to getting the vaccine than you ever did from COVID.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  That's the data. I mean, the most fascinating, striking thing from a legal perspective to me
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  is the government's complete unwillingness and incapacity to produce any statistical data
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  as to what they think the vaccine will do versus what COVID will do for different population groups.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  And that was my next question.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  That was my next question. Overhead shot, please.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  By the way, that news is a few weeks old.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  It's over 13,000 now dead in the VAERS reporting.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  Fauci, more than 99% of people who died from COVID-19 in June were not vaccinated.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  I read the AP article, the Hill article, they never give the data.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  They say Fauci provided AP data, but they won't show it.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  But then I look at the actual data out of the US, out of Canada, out of Australia, out of England.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  Most COVID deaths in England now are in vaccinated. Here's what you should know.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  Mainline news, 63.4% who died had been given the shot.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  That's mainstream news. That's medicalpress.com.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  All university epidemiologists, 60% of new COVID cases are vaccinated people.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  And I've got hundreds of these articles, literally.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  So what's crazy is they're telling us that it's 99% of those dying didn't have a shot.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  It's just made up out of their butt.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  But then we have the real facts. It's the opposite.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  Exactly. And the details in Israel has been releasing data.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  A majority of its people that now have it are from the vaccinated ranks,
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  according to a range of data and information.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  And so the question, you have a vaccine that doesn't actually inoculate you,
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  doesn't actually prevent the worst consequences.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  It might reduce those consequences. It might reduce transmission.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  But the cost of the vaccine itself in terms of public health,
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  if you're a healthy person, is far greater statistically,
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  according to the available data than from the disease.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  And this is, I mean, the other thing the media has done a great job of doing is suppressing.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  We rushed an influenza-like vaccine once before in our history, 1976.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  We rushed it out. The media said it would be great.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  The medical establishment said it would be great.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  And a year or two later, we found out that the vaccine caused far more injury
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  to healthy people than the pandemic ever could.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  And so we're repeating it.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  We go back to the late 1950s when they rushed an Xperia polio vaccine in the Belgian Congo.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  And now there are many people.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  And a cancer virus is in the U.S.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  Exactly. I mean, with the rushing the polio vaccine in the Belgian Congo,
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  probably gave us AIDS, one of the worst viruses in human history.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  So we have a history that whenever we rush these things,
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  and as you note, and as we've been saying for a year,
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  there is no history of success with influenza vaccine,
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  because of, in fact, Brett Weinstein's argument for the last six months
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  has been if we rush this vaccine,
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  we will increase the probability of an effective variant
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  that is completely outside the scope of the vaccine.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  And now here they are complaining about exactly that around the world
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  about the Delta variant.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  So they've created this because they increased the risk of a variant
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  by rushing a vaccine.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  But Robert, they're not stupid.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  They wore game this Fauci eight years ago, University of Texas,
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  did all these studies.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  He knew what this so-called vaccine would do.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  They planned every damn bit of this.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  What do you think their master plan is?
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  Complete control of the human being.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  I mean, it's the same thing you've been talking about now
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  for a quarter century.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  It's just this is an easier method of achieving it
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  than anything else they've tried before.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  Because what they're trying to do is establish the legal precedent
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  that the state has a right to control your body,
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  to control not only whether you work, whether you move,
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  almost everything else about your life,
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  whether you can go to church, whether you can go to school,
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  whether you can talk to your neighbor.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  But now they want to control your physical body
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  and what they put into your physical body
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  without your informed consent.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  In fact, without either one, you're not going to be informed
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  and you're not going to be allowed to consent.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  It's going to be coerced.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  This is the new state structure
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  that they've been looking for for half a century.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  And they're on the verge of achieving it
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  unless people fight back.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  Let's talk about how we legally and lawfully fight back
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  in the great video we'll play when we come back
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  of the police in France joining the protesters
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  all over the country.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  That's the answer.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  So many people say to me,
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  and going in a root canal is not negative.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  It hurts. It stinks.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  It's got pus coming out of it.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  I go to the doctor. They fix it.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  That's not negative.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  I'm not living in denial.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  And so think of globalism as being hidden
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  as an infection that we feel yet,
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  now it's come to the surface.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  That's actually a positive thing.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  And so, yeah, Trump did an overall great job.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  They stole the election.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  We can't get down about that.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  So now they're trying to suppress us
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  because they know they've been exposed.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  They're scared.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  That's why instead of saying,
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  oh, we're a bunch of losers.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  Look what happened.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  No, we're a bunch of winners.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  They're trying to suppress us.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  Let our light of truth shine
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  Your own website, your own show,
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  Just keep sharing however you can
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  and realize we're in information war.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  We're going to win this together.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  And the fight starts at 4s.com.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  It's just been the whole time,
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  we've had a lot of people
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  out of HIV and the mistreatment of it
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  with ACT and other chemicals
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  that actually killed more people than HIV
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  and they were the ones involved
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  in viral research of viruses
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  that would actually go attack the tilinfas
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  and the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  The problem for them
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  was the viruses would then break down
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  and would be nonlethal down the road.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.660]  one of HIV. That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  Perfect by itself, or with super male vitality in the true alpha male path, alpha power can help
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  lose performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol, and more.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  Let alpha power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with alpha power.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  Head to infowarstore.com today.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody. You're on the fence about it.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the infowar.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air. Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  Awesome. So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products. Alpha power, even at 29.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom. So, just number one for a few days.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  Well, it definitely works. It's not a joke.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  Absolutely.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  While more and more Canadians are getting vaccinated right now, it's also important to plan ahead for the future.
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  We've reached an agreement with Pfizer for 35 million booster doses for next year and 30 million in the year after.
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  This deal includes options to add 30 million doses in both 2022 and 2023 and an option for 60 million doses in 2024.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  Pfizer has been a solid partner for Canada in this fight against COVID-19 and we're happy to be one of the first countries to secure an agreement with them going forward.
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:12.000]  These boosters will be the latest version of the Pfizer vaccine based on research and testing and they will help us keep the virus under control.
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  And the work doesn't end there either. We're on ongoing discussions with other vaccine manufacturers about their plans for booster shots too.
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  So, the key message from our finding is that we found that recipients of the Pfizer vaccine, those who've had two doses, have about five to six-fold lower amounts of neutralizing antibodies.
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  Now, these are the sort of gold standard private security antibodies of your immune system which block the virus from getting into your cells in the first place.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  So, we found that that's less for people with two doses. We've also found that for people with only one dose of the Pfizer jab that they are less likely to have high levels of these antibodies in their blood.
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:03.000]  And perhaps most importantly for all of us going forward is that we see that the older you are, the lower your levels are likely to be.
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  And the time since you've had your second jab, as that time goes on, the lower your levels are also likely to be.
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  So, that's telling us that we're probably going to be needing to prioritize boosters for older and more vulnerable people coming up soon, especially if this new variant spreads.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  By the way, he didn't mean to speak there. That's the head of the big EU program testing to see how the Pfizer and other injections work. And he's saying it lowers your immunity so you have to keep getting it.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  Where instead of them saying, oh, we're going to give you a utopia. They go, you'll have nothing. You'll own nothing. We're all going to starve to death. It's, you know, it's just completely sociopathic.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:33:01.000]  How do you respond to something when it's got all the media gaslighting, all the corporations, the public's rebelling, but they just don't stop? How do we legally and lawfully respond to this?
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  I mean, I know you've been very, very, very, very deep in researching this. I don't know if you're ready to give people your ideas on it. What do you think?
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:21.000]  So a couple of different components. One, people fighting back in the court of public opinion has been critical and essential. So continuing to support places like infowars, continuing to share the links, continuing to share the information.
[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  Because there are people out there. I mean, I had a debate yesterday with someone on Twitter who just assumed there couldn't possibly be any reason why any smart individual would not want to take the COVID vaccine.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  And I just started laying out the facts that the reality is, according to the available data, there's reason to believe that you're 20 times more at risk of your health.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  If you're a healthy person without comorbidities from the vaccine, then you are from COVID. That's what the existing data shows for the first six months of this year, almost half a million serious injuries being reported to the vaccine database.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  No doubt understates the scope and scale of it compared to very few COVID related deaths in healthy populations in the United States in the first six months.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  So continuing to get the information out, the data out. I mean, that's why there's been such massive censorship of even people on the left, like Brett Weinstein, like Alex Berenson, like others in that school, like Robert Kennedy Jr.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  Oh, you're right. They've had a trick claiming it's Republicans that don't want the shot. When I look at numbers, it's about evenly divided. In fact, the more educated you are, the less you want to take it, other than black folks on average, because they aren't stupid.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  They've been tested on.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  Exactly. In fact, Richard Barris, people's pundit, did detailed polling on people that had doubts about the vaccine and didn't plan on taking it. And YouTube removed it, stopped his live stream live because he was detailing how many ordinary people all across the racial and political spectrum that simply have reasons to doubt the government or know
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  Let's talk about that. Let's shift gears. Is this all interconnected to Trump's suit? I know you've been critical of it. The nice way and a friendly way to get him to amended. I talked to Norm Pattis and others, they agree with what you said.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  They need to go after this on the fact that now government is working with it. That totally ends everything. It's beyond section 203 or whatever it is. The point is, is that looking at this, the fact is, well, talk about that briefly.
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  Absolutely. So the president suit is the right idea. The problem is he's got these corrupt insiders that are the lawyers that part of this, they claim to be America first. They're not really America first. They're just, well, you know, I'm their big oil bus people from Texas.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  You know, that's, I mean, it's Rick Perry and his crew. So these are people who are not well equipped to file Trump suit. So Trump is in the right state of mind. But the lawsuit as designed right now appears to be designed to fail. It appears to have a poison pill in it.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  So if he will modify the suit to change what allegations are there, bring different causes of action, put the class in a different place. Alan Dershowitz is willing to help out. I'm willing to help out. Army Dylan's willing to help out. Ron Coleman's willing to help out.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  A lot of lawyers that know this space very well, understand the significance of the suit and that Trump has the right state of mind. He just has the wrong lawyers and the currently the lawsuit reflects those wrong lawyers, rather than Trump's right state of mind.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  So if he will change the suit, then it has a chance because you're right. It's part of the much bigger picture right now that the biggest suppression and censorship, even more so than of Trump has been of anybody raising questions about what's happening in this vaccine,
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  COVID lockdown, Milgram experiment, what's going on to the whole world population. And so and when it's happening to prominent people on the left, like Robert Kennedy Jr., like Rhett Weinstein, like Alex Barron said, all people who were Joe Biden supporters, Alan Dershowitz even to some degree, then it reveals the scale and scope of what they're doing.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  They are terrified of honest, objective information coming out. The Nuremberg code of 1947 was all about guaranteeing that people have two things that they are informed prior to any medical intervention that takes place concerning them and that they consent before there's
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  So let's talk about section 230. It's one thing to say section 230 clearly they're violating that clearly they're violating campaign finance law, suppressing Republicans, nationalist patriots, boosting establishment voices but to go through and block
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  Governor DeSantis hearings in the State House with scientists to block congressional hearings, senatorial hearings. I mean this is real Soviet level, lifetime AI censorship and it's the whole future. If we can't do something about that, we can't do anything about any of it.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  And so you're absolutely right. I read Trump's suit before I even talked to you or others. And I said, where are they talking about the Democrats admitting they went and told Facebook to suppress pro Trump stuff during the campaign.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  That's election meddling. I mean, we have no proof of Russians. We've got proof of the Democrats with an organization that's three billion members Facebook because any country suppressing our election right there.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  Exactly what Trump needs to do is amend his complaint and add specific claims that that Fauci directed that Trump be removed that Pelosi directed that Trump be removed that the Vice President Harris directed big tech to remove Trump that
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  President Biden directed. I mean here you had President Biden on the same day his press secretary comes out and says we're going to be telling Facebook what post to remove and whom to remove. The President President Biden comes out and accuses Facebook of serial murder for not going along with
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  what he directed them to do in removing certain posts. So they need to they should have expanded include the whole history that this was a five year campaign. There were secret meetings that they targeted you because you were considered the tip of the spear of Trump support.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  All of that should be in a much more robust lawsuit that gets into all of it brings different causes of action enhances the existing causes of action details the facts and makes the specific allegation that the lawsuit seems scared to make.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  That the direct order of the leading elected political Democrats including the President the Vice President Fauci and the Speaker of the House and that's what it needs to do to have a chance to win.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  And that's what's crazy we'll talk about the final segment coming up is they're just going for broke on every front. And if we got good lawyers and good leadership and the population behind it should be very easy to beat what they're doing not on section 230 but on
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  section 230 and election meddling and anti trust. I mean this is all just insane Robert Barnes is our guest will tell you about his show he hosts when we come back.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  And we got 12 seconds. How do we find your show of Viva Barnes law that locals that time. That's getting really popular that show you're doing exploded.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  As we predicted the globalist are now launching a new lockdown. The first one has already destroyed the third world already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  And it's caused massive supply chain problems across the Western world. Ladies and gentlemen now is the time for you to get high quality storeable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  Our biggest best company in the United States is our supplier. Their entire catalog is an info or store.com. You get an additional 10% off at info or store.com but only for one more week.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  They've told us you can extend it one more week Alex. But that's it. They won't do this sale again until November. And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  This is insurance you can eat. It's the highest quality hundreds of high quality foods three months six month your supplies all ready for you at info or store.com or call toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine.

[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  The bio security state is here. It's an anti human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty bad and evil.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada says he admires the communist dictatorship of GCP and wishes to make Canada saying has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  And then in 2024 you will again take two shots and he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates. They're now implementing it and now they've announced that US policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  Of course the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf Alois Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville Institute in Germany.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  And bullwars will continue to selflessly fight this. I don't know how long we can. The enemy's coming for us all now. God bless and good luck. I would again get right with God right now.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this to be able to find it off.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the attack that's happening we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance we will defeat it.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time supporting info wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're also funding our operation.

[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host and we're going to clean house here today. I didn't say anything when Black Rifle Coffee Company when Carl Rittenhouse went out to volunteer and try to help people and they tried to murder him and convicted pedophile and an armed robber and others.
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  And he defended himself. They threw him under the bus at Black Rifle Coffee Company and they just said he's a terrible person. Then they did a New York Times interview this week and I mean said, F our supporters, F gun owners, F, you know, we don't want them, screw them.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  I mean, you talk about rolling over like a yellow belly. And so I'm not in competition with this company. I think I think their coffee's, you know, pretty good. In fact, I know one of their former head marketing guys here in Austin, he's a great guy, but I know he got out of it because of the way they were going.
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  But to see them come to the New York Times and bow down to them and attack Carl Rittenhouse, who's a good young man, who's facing life in prison, when Antifa burned down all these buildings and killed all these people and they're, you know, they're being heralded as heroes.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  It's bigger than Black Rifle Coffee Company, which is synonymous in my view with Benedict Arnold. It's this cucking by the Republican establishment that this afraid of the system.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  Oh my God, the New York Times, because the New York Times even attacks them. That's not enough that you hate gun owners. It's not enough that you hate conservatives.
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  It's not enough in life. We're veterans, so you need to buy our coffee while they piss all over the Republic. So to me, Black Rifle Coffee is, I'd rather die than drink it.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  When you talk about empty fakes, when you talk about fraud, when you talk about what's destroyed this country, they're the essence of it.
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  And so that's all I'm saying is that with friends like this, we don't need any enemies, do we?
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  And so Barnes, I really see you get pissed as well, but you are on the case with Rittenhouse and his lawyers. You got Rittenhouse's mom on and we're going to try to support them.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  I've never even waited in the middle of this. I mean, I thought he'll easily, you know, not be convicted, but now they're all piling on.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  Everyone's betrayed him. They've turned their backs on him. Fox News has done it.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  And if they let Rittenhouse rot in jail, I know he's out now, or they let the folks rot in jail from the Capitol, well, then we deserve what happens to us next.
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  So, man, I read that Black Rifle Coffee Company article in the New York Times. It made me ashamed.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  I just, I mean, these are some very shameful people. So give us your take on, they're an example of what not to be.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  Completely. I mean, for example, Clay Travis and Buck Sexton, the kind of replacement for Rush Limbaugh in some stations, did a puff piece with them after this.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  Oh, Buck Sexton of the CIA?
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  Oh, yeah. Clay Travis has a slogan that says, Debap, which supposed to be, don't be a pussy. He needs to just remove the word, don't be a pussy, because that's basically what the Black Rifle Coffee Company slogan now should be as well.
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  These are people who, it's one thing to be a bunch of capitulating sellouts to run to the New York Times, to play the wokes to a card.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  And then at the same time to have a whole bunch of people they advertise with on the right, run cover form the next day or two, like Clay Travis and Buck Sexton, like Dana Loche, like some other people.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  But what's inexcusable in all of this is this is the second time they have smeared a kid and his family and the people supporting him.
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  This is a kid who is the, if Kyle Rittenhouse doesn't walk free, then self-defense is dead in America, period.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  He is the sine qua non of self-defense in America.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  This kid has been smeared by more people in the press than probably any individual defendant in American legal.
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  And he's basically, he's basically like Sheriff Andy from Mayberry.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  I mean, this is, just to watch these guys call themselves veterans and patriots and we're for America when they're not, they just want to lick the butt of the New York Times.
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  That's exactly right. Here you have a kid that's been smeared by everybody, completely innocent. Everybody who's watched those videos, even the New York Times' own video breakdown, shows how clearly, convincingly, irrefutably innocent.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  Kyle Rittenhouse is. This is a kid who 20-year veterans have said they were shocked at the level of trigger discipline shown.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  Well, that's the thing is though, they want to set the precedent that we can't defend ourselves in our own homes during the communist takeover, during the anti-fabiolem takeover.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  So if we stand for Rittenhouse, we stand for ourselves. If we don't, we get what we deserve. This is a serious litmus test.
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  And like you said, they didn't just crap all over Rittenhouse and his family. They rubbed it in.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  I mean, I read that article that they said, screw an FR people, F Second Amendment, F gun owners, F.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  I mean, they were just like, F, F, F, F, F these people. Wow. I mean, you talk about scum.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  No doubt. I mean, the tip of the spear of self-defense is Kyle Rittenhouse. And here they are attacking this kid, a kid they don't know, a case they obviously haven't investigated, and they did it a second time.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  They attacked him the first time just because he wore it.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  They hate the image of a citizen stopping a bunch of pedophiles burning buildings down. They hate the idea of a man who isn't going to take it anymore.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  If Kyle Rittenhouse had not been there that night, there would have been a lot more innocent people dead, more buildings burned, more destruction taken place. That's the reality.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  And so the idea that you would attack this person-
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  His crime was being there and not letting bullies killing.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  That's exactly right. I mean, they are coming after Kyle Rittenhouse because they don't want any American to have self-defense, period, ever. If Kyle doesn't have self-defense, none of us have self-defense.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  And he knew the laws. He knew what was happening. He knew lawless groups were coming. He was there getting people first aid. He backed off these people. He was not looking for trouble.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  He did a very better job, like you said, a 10-year veteran of a police department would do. That's all the cops I know said. They said he did a very good job.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  Absolutely. I mean, there's people firing guns behind him. He doesn't sit around. He doesn't- He never panics once. He never overreacts once.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  There was nothing vigilante about this at all. This was a kid who only did what he had to do at the very last possible second.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  He's as people trying to bash his head in and he's not pulling the trigger. So he's only doing so and people are literally grabbing the gun-
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  I just want to say this. I know a lot of veterans that are great people and they're some of the best folks I know, but you look at this Black Rifle Coffee Company people.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  They don't look like a sacks of garbage. They actually look like a bunch of wimps living off of the name of the U.S. military.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  They're disgraceful people. George Washington pisses on them and I hope they burn in hell. I mean, look at these guys. Looks like Brian Stiltz.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  I mean, these are people who are fake conservatives. They think they put some chicks with bikinis on and pretend to be tough guys and they got almost all of their monetary support from conservatives
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  and now they turn around after they've gotten rich off those conservatives and slap them in the face and attack a kid.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  Anybody who's going to attack a kid like Kyle Rittenhouse is a business that doesn't belong in business on the political side of the aisle.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  So they've been a total disgrace. There's no excuse for what they did.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  But what they are is cowards because they growl to the left. They growl to the New York Times and I guarantee you they're not happy now.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  I've got people calling me fama that everyone calls me saying, I don't like that Black Rifle Coffee Company.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  You know them. You're not with them. Are you? And I'm like, no, no, the guy we had on used to be with them.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  I have family like threatening me and not be associated with them.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  They pissed off Hillbilly. They pissed off my Hillbilly family.
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  What I told them was all they have to do is issue an apology and a correction and retraction and quit Smear and Kyle Rittenhouse and his family and they refused to.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  Instead, they have these conservatives put them on and softpedal what they said and what they did.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  If you're not with Kyle Rittenhouse, you're not a conservative. If you're not with Kyle Rittenhouse, you're not with the Second Amendment.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  You're not with America. You're a piece of crap.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  Precisely. And these people have gone out of their way to attack a kid repeatedly.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  So if you're a Black Rifle Coffee customer, today is the day to send them your cancellation order because they decided to cancel Kyle Rittenhouse, cancel the self-defense, cancel the Second Amendment, cancel Americana at its core.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  And by the way, we're not trying to pitch this against Black Rifle. I've promoted them. I've been nice to say, quote, plan their pro-second amendment. They're not.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  We've had the highest quality people make jokes about it. Well, what? It's from Chiapas. That's where Comedy Star.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  That's where great coffee is. We buy it from villagers in Chiapas. It's basically almost Guatemalan coffee, but it's better.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  It's high-end. The same stuff sells for $10 more a pound at Whole Foods. I found a distributor for it more than 10 years ago.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  It is very high-end coffee. People drink it. They can't believe how good it is. We've never raised prices in 10 years. Coffee prices are exploding.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  In the new year, it's going to go up 25%. But we've got two different varieties of it at infowarstore.com.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  And we're not even, I mean, I've had Kyle's family on. We've done fedraisers for him, but I'm not some person that sits up and says, buy my stuff.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  I'm going to support Kyle Rittenhouse. I'm going to support him no matter what.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  We got it with the Rishi mushrooms for your immune system. We have it without. At $19.95 for a package this big, it is an amazing deal.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  But I will say, because they don't want Kyle having support, that's going to make me support him even more.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  I guess his trial is coming up, what, in October or November? When is it?
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  The first week in November.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  What's the website? I'm not involved. You're not involved. Just how do we donate to Kyle Rittenhouse since Black Rifle Trader Company doesn't want this American to stay free?
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  They said screw him, F you. We don't want you as our customers. We get it scum. We hate you too. Right back. You're on American trash.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  How do we support Kyle Rittenhouse in the name of standing up against this film?
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  Freekyleusa.com. Freekyleusa.com. That's where people can go to support Kyle's defense.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  And by the way, none of this goes to me. I've delayed and deferred any receipt of any payment. I've been doing all of this pro bono.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  No, I know that. You're not like Black Rifle Coffee Company claiming you're these big patriots while you piss on America. We get it.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  This all goes to Kyle, who has no money. They've lost everything. They've got the whole DA and the Soros group against them.
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  Everybody needs to donate right now. One more time, the website.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  Freekyleusa.com. Freekyleusa.com.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  And I got to say, I'm really ashamed of Black Rifle Pussy Company. I don't insult women. Women are incredible.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  A lot compare them to pussies. I love pussies. These are traders and these are cowards and these are on American scum.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  And you know what? They got God to deal with. Burn in hell, Black Rifle. Burn in hell.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  Mike Lindell is a man in the arena. A man after Teddy Roosevelt's own heart. People demonize him. They laugh at him. They attack him.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  But he's been proven right. The audits are coming out and there was total absolute election fraud against President Trump and against the American people.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  That is the bottom line. And Mike Lindell is getting sued by all these big, powerful, globalist institutions.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  Trying to shut him down. That's why it's so important to support mypelo.com and all the great products he's got and all the thousands of employees he has hired in America.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  Because he's doing God's work. And at the same time, he's funding infowars. That's right.

[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  They have forced them out in the open. So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  You've got to trust in the plan of God. And trust in the plan of God's justice. That is invincible. That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action against the globalists.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  You've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you. We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  We've seen the governor in New York say we're going to take kids and give them shots no matter what their parents say.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  California passed a law where 12-year-olds and up can do it without their parents' consent.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  And in places like Toronto, Canada, and Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, they have ice cream trucks. I'm not joking.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  Look at them drive around and give the kids shots without their parents even knowing.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  This is a criminal revolution, a new world order. And Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, is working with Robert Kennedy Jr. who's doing an amazing job fighting all of this on attempts to inject districts of Columbia children without parental consent.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  Barnes, tell us about that.
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  So two things have happened. Essentially, D.C. passed a law and then put in procedures first to use the COVID vaccine on public school children without their parents knowing about it, but then they took it a step further.
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  They instructed doctors and medical staff to falsify documents so that they lied to parents and they created fake medical records for parents with a different set of medical records secretly being kept by the state and the school.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  So that parents who already had religious exemptions under the law, already had medical exemptions under the law, were not going to know that their kid had been secretly vaccinated against their will without any aspects of informed consent taking place at all.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  And what the striking thing about this was not just that aspect, but was that other aspect of having doctors forge documents to lie to parents so that parents don't know what their own children's health treatment actually is because of the school.
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  So Bobby Kennedy has brought suit against the District of Columbia, challenging all of it, noting that it not only violates parental rights under the Constitution, certain privacy rights under the Constitution, informed consent rules under the Constitution, but also it violates religious rights under the religious statutes that were passed in 2000 by
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  Congress because this is deliberately, their primary target are religious kids, religious parents who have religious exemption. For example, there's people that have exemption that have a religious exemption to this particular vaccine because some of it was used with stem cell research.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  And so people that opposed stem cell research don't want to support this vaccine. So some of them have used that as a religious exemption. They're deliberately targeting religious exempt kids. So they're going to secretly vaccinate them without the parents knowing, then lie to the parents by having doctors forge documents
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  and the schools forge documents, create fraudulent documents to lead them to believe it didn't happen. And this is a big suit being brought by Bobby Kennedy against the District of Columbia, exposing all of this first and foremost, but also challenging it on constitutional and federal statutory grounds.
[1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  And it has an excellent chance of winning.
[1:59:56.000 --> 2:00:12.000]  And then we see the sitting president of the United States, and we see the press spokesperson, Jen Psaki saying, we've got to stop this person. And we said, when does government go to big tech and say stop a person when all they're doing is telling the truth?
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  I mean, this is a perfect storm of evil barns. I shudder to think if we don't stop this, and if we don't fight back what they're going to do next.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  Yeah, exactly. That's why Bobby Kennedy's also brought suit in federal court in California. It's going to go up to the Ninth Circuit because he was one of the first targets by Fauci and crew for removal from the Internet, for removal from big tech.
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  This is a guy who when he simply cited the VAERS data we were talking about earlier. Facebook and Instagram completely banned his account overnight and then libeled him to the world.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  Said he was spreading misinformation when all he was spreading was the government's own information from the government's own database.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  That is how insane this environment has got. When a guy as famous as Bobby Kennedy, a guy on the left, can't even cite a government database without being banned by big tech.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  That shows how dangerous and perilous this is.
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  Let me say this. Let me say this. I've never been able to get him on the air, but I've had a huge whisper campaigns against him telling me don't interview him. He's bad.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  No, he's great. He's done great work. He's a great person. His father died for freedom and I support Robert Kennedy Jr. I think he's doing amazing work.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  But there is major whisper campaigns against him because he's the real deal and he's a hero.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  Robert Barnes, thank you so much for the time. Incredible interview. I'm going to air a clip of him talking about Gates and Fauci and their financial corruption when we come back.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  But real quick, again, I love coming on your big show, but that great French lawyer, our Canadian lawyer, tell us about that real briefly.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  How people find you and the great show you're doing with other folks.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  Viva Barnes Law.locals.com. Viva Barnes Law.locals.com. Beautiful.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  Viva Barnes Law.locals.com.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  Viva Barnes Law.locals.com.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  Viva Barnes Law.locals.com.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  Viva Barnes Law.locals.com.
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  Well, evil is flexing its muscles. It's making its big run against humanity. It's taking over every major institution we've learned to trust and love.
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  It's taking over every major institution we've learned to trust and love.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  It's taking over every major institution we've learned to trust and love.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  I mean, that's what we've been talking about from the beginning. Gates has these incestuous relationships with Anthony Fauci that go back 20 years where he's paying Fauci and they have all kinds of really corrupt financial entanglements with each other.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  You know, he brought Fauci to his house in 2000 and his $189 million house in Seattle brought him into the den, sat him down and said, I want to have a partnership with you.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  And the way that Fauci explains it is that Fauci would develop the drugs and then pass them on to the drug companies to Merck, Sonofi, Gilead, Johnson & Johnson. Gates would then guarantee markets in Africa through his control of WHO.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  Wow. And those companies don't want to give vaccines to Africa because it's very uncertain. You know, Botswana has a government this year that says yeah, we want them in next year.
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  And Gates, because he controls WHO, he controls those companies, those countries because WHO pays for their health ministries and supplies on their HIV medications.
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  And they have to do what WHO tells them to do. So he can require those companies, those countries to buy the vaccines from these companies.
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  And he then is invested in the companies in Merck, you know, and by the way, Gates has no pretension that he gives a crap about public health.
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  His other investments are in tobacco companies, in processed foods, in Coca-Cola, in Cargill, in Monsanto, in Philomores, Kraft, you know, cheese, and then all the oil companies, which he owns steaks and virtually all of them.
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  So he's not a guy who cares about climate or who cares about public health. He's a guy who cares about control.
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  Leo Zagami joins us. I went to Rome five years ago. I've been interviewing Zagami for years. I read several of his books. He said that both Jorge Francis would be the pope.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  He said you'll have a Jesuit pope, then they'll have the other pope step down. You'll have two pubs at once. And he said then they'll start having rotating pubs.
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  And I thought, well, this guy's smart. I don't think he's lying, but then it all came true. Never happened before in 2,000 years of popes.
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  So he knows what he's talking about. Let me just put that out front for you. And there I was at the Vatican with him at night as thunderstorms were lightning striking the main dome.
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  It was Twilight Zone. And they had armored wheels drive by and like point machine guns at us. We have a footage of this. You cannot make this up. So Leo Zagami, bestselling author, researcher, and also he's an aristocrat.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  He's all part of the inside groups in Italy, but he was arrested and run out of the country for exposing this.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  And he joins us. He joins us now from the United States where he is in exile to talk about this big stack of news I have here outlawing what you said they would do years ago, the Latin mass and getting rid of any of the Christian tenants in the Catholic church.
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  So to talk about where the world is today, what's happening, the Vatican basically declaring war on Christianity, the schism that's happening and what this tells us about where we are in end times.
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  Leo Zagami, thank you so much.
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  Hello, Alex. Hello, everybody at Infowars. Well, first of all, we had also a press conference at the Vatican earlier in July with an important statement of the International Academy of the Vatican, which was addressed to all the scientists and the medical associations regarding
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  the vaccine hesitancy. So they are actually directly involved in what you've been speaking up until now regarding instead the topic of the day. Of course, the war has been on the traditional mass, the traditional mass, which has been put into question since the middle
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  of the sixties after the end of the Second Vatican Council, which ended up in December 1965 in time for year zero of Satanism, of modern Satanism, 1966.
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  From that moment onwards, they started to abolish gradually the practice of Latin in masses, the classic trident in mass, which was basically in place for hundreds of years. And this has been obviously then presented by the pope back then who was a Freemason,
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  Paul VI, his own version of the mass. I have an image here of Papa Montini, which I included in one of my books because it actually, this image proves with his own signing that he was a Freemason.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  He actually dedicated this pick to a Freemason friend of mine. And why I'm talking about Freemason? Because the liberal side of Freemasonry, which is the prevalent one these days, took over the Second Vatican Council, decided to destroy all the Catholic traditions to gradually
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  prepare, of course, for the one world religion later on. But from 1970, we have the presentation of the mass that is practiced these days in most churches, the mass in your ordinary language. But there was still a number of priests that were, of course, still practicing the old
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  school mass in Latin. And in 2007, Pope Ratzinger actually supported the idea that these communities could still practice the mass in Latin, the traditional mass, because, of course, the new mass is called Novo Ordo Mise, which goes
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  in line with Novo Ordo Secularum, is the new order of the ages, but it's also the new mass for the church, which has, of course, gradually taken over this Latin side and getitized it.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  And now, Pope Francis, this year, with this unprecedented move, prohibits priests in any ordinary parish church to practice this Latin mass, eventually they can go to their dioceses to their
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  bishops. What does it signify? It's got a lot of conservative Catholics angry. What does it signify? Because I'm embarrassed about Europe's Christian past two years ago, he said all these abominations, obviously, I mean, what does it mean now ban the original?
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  It means a lot. Okay, it means a lot for non Catholics. The practice of Latin is essential for also for the exorcism. A mass is in itself a form of exorcism. The fact that they have that Pope Francis has prohibited the use of their traditional Latin mass inside
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  a demon, a demon wouldn't want to hear that. Yes. In fact, the first thing he did a few months ago was to prohibit such mass within the Vatican walls. And now he's going after all those who practice it.
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  And like I've been saying, also in this book, volume 6.66, I underlined the importance of the Latin language.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  You predicted on my show like six years ago, you said they'd ban the Latin mass. That's happening. That happened. That's why you're here.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  Absolutely. They are actually going after those people and those priests to still support this form of mass. They say that basically the document that Pope Francis has issued says that
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  Pope Ratzinger in 2007 wanted to reopen the possibility for the celebration of the Latin mass only because of the Lefebriens of the schismatic groups that wanted more tradition after the Second Vatican Council.
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  Let's talk about what this means and who this current Pope is and where you see this going because obviously big changes are happening right now. Leo Zagami is our guest expert on the Vatican, big insider, who went public about it all.
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  He's a big Mason. He's a member of the Illuminati, like the original Illuminati. Tell us about that when you come back. Stay with us.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  Anthony Fauci and Eugenesis Globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  down the road. That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV. That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  And it's caused massive supply chain problems across the Western world. Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storeable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 20, 20 prices.

[2:14:56.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Alex Jones, your host, Leo Zagami is our guest, best selling author, researcher, Vatican insider, big top freemason, gotten recruited to it, became even more Christian, broke away from it.
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  You know, you'll do the fleet. You're so nice. Talk about any subject I want.
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  That got you on to some of the crew mentioned a few days ago. Hey, look, they're getting rid of the Latin mass. Leo Zagami predicted that many years ago. I don't want to just obsess on that. Where else do you want to go?
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  Because there's so much happening and I always ask the questions. Finish up the Latin mass, but what else is front and center for you? What else is really important right now?
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  Well, there is actually a very famous intellectual in France, which on Monday on the figure, which is one of the main French newspapers, he's an atheist, but he said, I am shocked about what Pope Francis is doing to the church.
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  So his name is Michel Onfret. And so that means really that even the atheist are starting to feel a little bit puzzled by what this pope is doing regarding where we want to go.
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  Well, aside from the fact that, of course, this pope is a facilitator of Satan himself, but that can be said of all the church after the Second Vatican Council, because they gradually are moving towards that one word.
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  The religion we have talked about many times. And then there is also the fact that, of course, the church has 80% of his members.
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  And we talked about it many times on the show that are homosexuals. And so they find themselves entangled in this continuous hypocrisy.
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  Pope Paul VI, the guy who actually, Paul Montini, who actually did the new mass, wrote it down together with a bunch of Freemasons. He himself had a gay lover.
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  He used to go and see in Switzerland. And because of that, and because of the photos that certain Masonic lodges had, they could actually blackmail him even further in accepting certain things for the church.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  Now we have, of course, a Jesuit pope. And along with him, we have people like Anthony Fauci, who is a Jesuit agent. We have many other Jesuits running the show, including Joe Biden, who is in the White House.
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  So we can say really that the Jesuits are fully in charge, together, of course, with their all-time allies, which are, of course, China. China and the communists worldwide. What is happening?
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  And for those who don't know, mainline history, the Vatican opened up China with the Portuguese runners, right?
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  It was actually the first people who opened up these relations were Jesuits. It was Matteo Ricci, who was a disciple of Ignacio Loyola, because the company of Jesus, right from the start, when they created this order, this new order within the Vatican,
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  not only they wanted to go against the Protestant world that was reforming, but they wanted to also move towards the East. And in the East, they will do some very powerful alliances.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  Actually, he got to become the assistant to the emperor, and since then the Jesuits have been present in China. In Beijing, Matteo Ricci has the big shrine for somebody who is actually a Jesuit in a communist country.
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  And so here we have, of course, this very strong alliance that the Vatican has been getting since the election of Pope Francis, two billion dollars a year from China.
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  So they can shut up about whatever is going on in Hong Kong, whatever goes on in their concentration.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  Well, let me ask you this then, what do we do? Where does this go? Because you predicted you'd have two pubs, you predicted it'd be this guy, but I was in Rome with you like five, six years ago, and I'm like, okay, Zygome, I know you're smart, but it happened a few years later.
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  What are you predicting comes next now?
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  Well, of course, you have been discussing during the show the fact that there is this vaccine pass, this green pass that in Europe, not only in France, but now also in Italy and many other countries will become really the first stage of the mark of the beast before they will actually implement the microchipping.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:39.000]  Because from a piece of paper or from actually having it on your phone, then they will once they will get there.
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  Oh, they're stealing identities. Oh, it's not safe.
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  He says first your phone, then a chip.
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  So we have, for example, already in France in Paris, there is clinics who are of course forging fake passes. So with that excuse, they will eventually say we need to microchip you. So that is basically the mark of the beast.
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:09.000]  What we have to do, we have to resist and eventually we have to form isolated communities that are independent from all this.
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:10.000]  So there is no other option.
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:15.000]  Exactly. The future is our own communities. That's everything.
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:19.000]  What's the time frame? I know you don't want to say it, but you don't know.
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  What's the time frame of the Antichrist takeover? How long does this happen? How long we got to survive?
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  From 2020 to 2030, there is a three stages takeover. The first is bacteriological warfare. The second is cyber warfare. The third is nuclear warfare.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  So these three scenarios will be unveiled in the next nine years. The first one is, of course, unveiling in front of our eyes.
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  Now, of course, the cyber polygon, the World Economic Forum with the people at Davos have discussed the next pandemic, which is the cyber pandemic that will close down the electricity and hold cities will create all kinds of damage.
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  That is the cyber warfare part. This is huge because I know you're a top expert. I'll tell you. Start over. I agree. First is biological, bacteriological virus.
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  Next is the cyber, which they tell us in the next is nuclear. Lay that out.
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  Yes. The cyber warfare basically is already taking place with all these hackers that are working constantly.
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  And then, of course, we have the nuclear. Now, the nuclear is already starting to be announced. China has China threatened to nuke Taiwan yesterday.
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  Here's the headline. Fox News. Go ahead. Keep going. Official Chinese Daily. They said we will nuke Japan.
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  So as you can see, gradually these three phases of this period that we unfortunately going to be leaving and that will, of course, diminish the population of the F because they already the vaccines are made to get less people in the next few years alive.
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  Why? Because they will be affected by it. Also, they will be they will not be producing new babies because they will be infertile.
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  So all this is connected, of course, with the vaccines. People will suddenly die and all that. We already know that.
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:39.000]  But then we have the cyber warfare for those people who have resisted and who rely on the Internet. We need to find alternative means of communicating and also alternative means of creating our own networks, internet networks, because that's going to be very important.
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  First, they say we're not essential to shut off small businesses. Next, they're going to shut off all the other small businesses that are online, only letting big tech survive to consolidate power. It's very simple.
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  Yes, and you showed the cyber polygon that was on the 9th of July, a very important moment for the New World Order as well as what went on in the week prior to that in San Vale in Idaho.
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  Well, let's come back and talk about San Vale Idaho, give me the floor, and then exactly why did they declare their attacks first before they do them? Because exactly.
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  First, they declare everybody non-essential, shut on their competition, consolidate power. Now they're going to say, oh, everybody else is shut down, can only go to our websites.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  So how do you get around that? Because obviously that is their end game. Leo Zagami. Leo Zagami.com. Leo is the lion. L-E-O Zagami. Z-A-G-A-M-I.com. Leo Zagami, all his books can be found there.
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  This guy knows what he is talking about, and we are steaming right into this. We've got to get ready. I'm listening to him because I'm getting ready for my family, folks.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  We tried to stop this, but the enemies launched their attack. This is the antichrist takeover.
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  You can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports, and share them with everyone you know.
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  Take action now by texting the word news, N-E-W-S, to 833-470-0438. That's 833-470-0438 for Info Wars Emergency News Alerts.

[2:24:46.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  All the way out to 2024, and then in 2024 you will again take two shots, and he says it will be whatever Pfizer cooks out that wants to put in your body.
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates. They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kosserville Institute in Germany.
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  Info Wars will continue to set fast. They fight this. I don't know how long we can. The enemy's coming for us all now. God bless, and good luck. I would again get right with God right now.

[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, and I've been asking a lot of questions. He's making a lot of key points, but Leo Zagami is an expert in the world government, an expert on what's unfolding, and he was just laying out bombshell information about the three next attacks we're going to see were already in the middle of the biological
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:59.000]  attack. And what's crazy is the Davos group admits all this. So I'm going to try to shut up the next 30 minutes or the next 25 minutes you have the floor. Leo Zagami, lay it out for him.
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  Yes, you said it. Davos is actually trying to find also ways of brainwashing people lately. They have been working closely with psychiatrists, with psychologists. They're finding ways of really brainwashing the masses to their own version of reality, which includes, of course, this cyber polygon, which we've been discussing, which was a rehearsal of the future that unfortunately
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:47.000]  expect us when we're going to have these massive blackouts of the Internet. Things are going to go really wrong if you rely too much on this technology. So that's why I said earlier we need to find new means of communications or new means of creating an alternative to the main Internet
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  network. And that can be done because it was done during the Arab Spring. I said you got the floor, but explain. They admit they love to brag. Why do they love to brag A than B? They tell us they're going to end the Internet for everybody else but them so you've got to go to them
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  online to buy things. It's a simple consolidation. How do we fight that? Well, we fight it by creating our own alternative networks. There is a way it was experimented during the Arab Spring.
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  You can use an antenna and then pass it on to the next antenna and then to the next one and create like this an alternative to the main Internet. That could be possible. Of course, we need to have some
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:48.000]  technological advice from people who are experts on the matter. But aside from that, we need to have our own grown food, our own animals. We don't need to rely so much on the general distribution. We have seen what has happened when the
[2:30:48.000 --> 2:31:04.000]  hackers have attacked the meat distribution, for example. So that is just a touch of what's going to happen next. And this is going to bring a major chaos and disruption. Then gradually they're forcing people in accepting the possibility of a vaccine
[2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:23.000]  passport. But we said that is the initial stage for the eventual and final mark of the beast, which will be like we always said and you said it for many years to a microchip. But then we have the nuclear situation, which of course is going to become a big problem.
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:40.000]  There is going to be certain areas which are going to be affected both by the so called dirty bombs, which are quite easy to create for terrorist networks, which of course work for the New World Order. And then we have, of course, frontal attacks with nuclear
[2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  missiles like the one which is prosecuted by China that has threatened Japan. When you are using the nuclear, you are of course creating a damage which will stay there for hundreds of years. So we are preparing really for a grim reality.
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:14.000]  But we can, like I said, isolate ourselves. And the first thing is to walk out of the cities because all cities, regardless who is governing them, will become eventually smart cities. And I've been saying this for a long time.
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  Everything that they deem, they call smart is actually satanic. Your phone is smart. No, it's satanic. Your car is smart. No, it's satanic. Anything that they deem as smart is actually.
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  And the dependency from Satan, which ultimately is the one behind all of it and his legion, this demonic reality which transcends our own terrestrial reality also in an other dimension.
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:33:07.000]  So Satan in his last stage, which was described, of course, in the book of Revelation, which you also cited, is very important to understand that we have to avoid all this. But the moment in which we have accepted the vaccine, the moment in which we accept this green pass,
[2:33:07.000 --> 2:33:19.000]  this vaccine passport, we are basically at that point going into the mark of the beast. And there is no, there's no going back. There's no way back from that point onwards.
[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:34.000]  So we will become less and less who want to fight this war. It's going to become increasingly difficult. They're going to make it like in Europe, we will not be able to go to the bars, to the restaurants, and then suddenly to the supermarket.
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  Exactly what the Bible tells us, which in a way is incredibly positive that it's all happening just like we were told it would. Is there, because God gives us free will, but I know it's also predestined.
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  God already knows the outcome, but we were given free will. Is there any way to escape it being as bad as the Bible says, if we were to do the right thing, or, or is that all predestined?
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  I mean, how do you work with free will, but then it's still going to happen because we can see it happening very quick now.
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  Well, we have still, until the end, our own will, our choice is going to be made increasingly difficult. We will, we're going to be learned into accepting this, this compromise.
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  We're going to be says no big deal is no big deal. But in the end, once you do that small step, then it becomes a giant step. And then there is, like I said, no way back.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  So the only solution is creating this smaller community using, of course, the fact like you mentioned earlier, the religious exemption, because we can definitely use that as a way to oppose this tyranny.
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  But then we have countries where that is not possible any longer. And those countries are the countries which don't have weapons. For example, Europe, they don't have any weapons. They don't, they don't, they can't defend themselves.
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  They have no sovereignty.
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  They don't have the possibility of defending themselves from the police, from the army, and it is actually the army in Italy. There is a general and there is an army that goes around with soldiers house by house to vaccinate people in remote areas.
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  So and they come there fully dressed as militaries. They don't knock on the door here like the Joe's witnesses of Joe Biden. There is more is more is more military, the whole thing.
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  And of course, we have Kamala Harris, which is now abusing the Bible saying herself that it's, it's, it's a Christian thing. It's, it's a godly thing to accept the vaccine is in the Bible for Kamala Harris.
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  Imagine that. So they are really proposing this whole thing as a sort of religion. Kamala Harris said that the church that was formerly frequented by Martin Luther King where Martin Luther King was to preach now is a vaccination center.
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  I mean, that really says it all.
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  What they're saying is we're going to give you eternal life with these injections. We're going to basically like Christ and the church is the bride and groom. They're literally saying we're going to have genetic intercourse with you.
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  It's very, very biblical, very satanic.
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  Absolutely. And of course, we have also the fact that they want to encourage this transgenderism, this gender fluidity, and they want to make sure that there is less and less people interested in creating a traditional family because of course the traditional
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  family means producing babies and they don't want you to produce any babies. They want you to reject all that live your life.
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  They also don't want the loyalty that comes from a man and woman having a child. They don't want that ritual. Is it that other than giving your heart to the Holy Spirit? Is it the man and woman coming together, creating a child, the ultimate ritual?
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  Absolutely. And the family is in itself a sacred unity that we create in front of God, no matter which religion you are affiliated to.
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  Unfortunately, now there is a priest, for example, in Germany, there has been a whole debacle with the Vatican regarding the fact that some priests have been marrying gay couples and that this implies really the church recognizing and not only recognizing, but actually
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  marrying gay couples, which is in itself an absurdity and not because the gay couples is something wrong, maybe in the eyes of the ordinary person, but in the eyes of a church which has certain values and of course sticks to the tradition and the Holy Scriptures, they should be
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  caught into what they are doing. Well, it's a ritual. It's a ritual. The two dudes have a sex, aren't having a child. Let's talk about it. Leo Zidami straight ahead.
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  That's why it's so important to support mypillow.com and all the great products he's got and all the thousands of employees he has hired America because he's doing God's work.
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  And at the same time, he's funding infowars. That's right. When you use promo code Alex at checkout, up to 60% off on the best-selling sheets and towels and the new beds he's got and the pillows, of course, everything.
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  Up to 60% off with promo code Alex at checkout at mypillow.com that you fund his rate work and our great work and infowars, a 360 win. Mypillow.com promo code Alex.
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  That's right where we're at brother.
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say. And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go what we do.
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire has a lot of power.
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com. We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated. They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off $14.95.
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long. We've got a private label with info wars on them for $14.95 because I want you to get them.
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  And I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these quote smartphones really are. This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal global system. They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead. Hey, how's it going, Alex? Good, bro. Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products. The XQ does wonders. They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info war.
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  Honor, talk to you.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  Awesome. So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products. Alpha Power, even at $29, if you ask my better half, she loves it.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  All right, it helps in the bedroom. So, just number one for a few of you.
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  Well, it definitely works. It's not a joke.
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  Absolutely.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  Leo Zagami is our guest. He's amazing. I want to invite him to be with us 15 minutes to the next hour.
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  Then open your phones up the rest of the fourth hour and hit the southern news I haven't gotten to.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  But before we get into your books, the way you talk about those, you're a shy guy.
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  You never promote your own work, but it's very important. I read most of your books.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  I think you've got a new one out. You just mentioned I haven't read yet.
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  What is Satan's goal for folks that don't get why this is happening?
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  Why evil is pushing? Why it wants to hurt good? What is wrong with Satan?
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  I know we're supposed to just love God and understand God, but people that I think also understand that they're not like Satan.
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:00.000]  They're falling. Sure, they're not perfect, but they're not trying to serve evil.
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  From your research, who is Satan? What is Satan and what does Satan want?
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:10.000]  Satan and his legion want our soul. So, they want a soulless society.
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  That's why the ultimate incarnation of Satan will be achieved in two thousand and thirty.
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:24.000]  After these three stages, which I have described, then there will be the materialization of Satan and cyber Satan.
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  The artificial intelligence will have matured to the next stage.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  And at that point, together with the robot, the robots, the robotic part of our society,
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:40.000]  which is increasing more and more, then they will dominate this planet.
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  And so that will be the beast is this giant robot system that has wonders and medical cures and everything.
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  And at that point, it will be very difficult to oppose such a system if we are not well prepared to fight.
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  Because a robot will spring up in a month. It'll just be giving you medicine, food, everything, but it wants you to do something.
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:04.000]  Yes, that's why I go back to what I said earlier.
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  Leave the big cities. Don't live in big cities because those cities, wherever they are, they are doomed.
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  Because their plan is to be transformed in a controlled system.
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  And of course, the artificial intelligence, you just showed the image of 2001 Space Odyssey and people don't really know this.
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  But Stanley Kubrick made actually an extra 20 minutes of this film that were never put out.
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  They were supposed to be like the presentation of the film.
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  The initial 20 minutes was him interviewing a Jesuit rabbi.
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:55.000]  And these people talk with him about alien, of course, the origin, the alien origins of humanity.
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  Shockingly, they also talk about the dangers of artificial intelligence, which manifests, of course, in the film 2001 Space Odyssey.
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:07.000]  By the way, where did you learn about that? Because I know Vivian Kubrick, who's his daughter, she told me some stuff privately.
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  Where were you told that?
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  If you go on the internet and you Google this, there is this part of the film which has not come out.
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  But you can see the transcript of it.
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  You can find it on the internet.
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  It's very interesting because at that time, of course, the people who were bringing out this film, they thought there would be too much to give all this kind of information.
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  Also because, of course, when you are showing Jesuits, rabbis and other people, scientists talking, this will have given even more credibility to a film that was already a milestone, not only of the cinematic culture, but I think much more than that.
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:01.000]  It was definitely a spiritual announcement. It was a big deal.
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  Yes. So what happened here in 2019? We had, for example, Event 201 with John Hopkins, Bill Melinda Gates and all these people.
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  Then they went in November, just when they did this Event 201, they went to the Vatican. They went to the Vatican.
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  There was a specific meeting in the Vatican and then they kickstarted the pandemic.
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  And now, of course, like I said earlier, we are at the next stage and that stage involves more and more the artificial intelligence, which, of course, is one of the reasons why we have also this pandemic.
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  This pandemic is meant to feed the artificial intelligence, the cyber satan, with data.
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:55.000]  You see, the cyber satan needs, it's like a vampire that feeds itself. It wants to play God. It needs to be given artificial, low-level omnipresence.
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:47:05.000]  Well, but it needs also data, information on everything on this planet so then they can eventually manifest the ultimate cyber satan.
[2:47:05.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  At that point, they can work on the next stage after that, which is transhumanism, the merger of man with machine.
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:21.000]  So what is the promise against these globalists to believe? Get rid of humanity, commercial machines, you live forever.
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  Because they admit that's the plan. Aren't they thinking maybe this is a scam? Get rid of my body and you'll empower me?
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  For example, Google has just bought out Boston Dynamics. They are working together with robotics because that's going to be their army.
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  You showed Hello Mask. He's been working, of course, as we all know, on a computer brain interface, but also on an internet that surrounds this planet with many satellites.
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  So this computer brain interface is going to create an army of transhuman people because at that point you are not really any longer a human.
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  You are a human connected with the artificial intelligence. So who are we talking with here?
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  When we're going to be talking with somebody who has this computer brain interface, we're no longer going to be talking with the guy we have in front of us.
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  Maybe we are talking with something else. And that is really scary because we're going to have also these hybrids.
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  So it's not only the robots, but also these men who will be like hybrids mixed already with the machine and all this, of course.
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  What about cyborgs and hybrids? And what about the genetic engineering side of this? What about the genetic engineering side?
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  I mean, they're admitting human animal clones now in the sixth stage.
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  And that, of course, is all going on mostly in China because there they can conduct all the experiments that they can conduct here in the West.
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  So here we have supposedly some ethical and moral rules.
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  So like Dr. Anthony Fauci, which is a gain of function research, everything is moved to China. And China, of course, is the dragon of the apocalypse, which was of course discussed in this text.
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  So the figure of the dragon is really representative and together with the beast, they constitute really the last phase.
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  But the last phase, of course, is also the return into the picture of this messianic figure that is supposedly going to oppose all this.
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  And with a minority of people who have resisted and who, of course, we can say are true Christians, they will be able to generate the society of the future.
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  The other people, unfortunately, will be in one way or another doomed and their lives will end in a very sad way, unfortunately.
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  Well, Leo, it's not my job to cause a lack of faith. We see the big church is getting in line with Satan.
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  But but why do the Satanists, why do the Luciferians follow God's system and actually fulfill it while they think they're still going to win?
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  Is that a great delusion?
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  Well, for example, we discussed the fact that the Catholic Church is taking away the Latin mass, but the Satanists are bringing it back.
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  They actually have brought back Latin in their rituals. They are here to create the society of tomorrow.
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  We see it in the billboards that the satanic temple is placing all over the United States, promoting abortion as a ritual.
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  They are selling us basically the birth of a baby like making a cake.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  They say it's no it's no big deal. Making a baby is just like making a cake.
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  So you're just adding some ingredients and putting them together.
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  So that is the value ourselves, not standing up for ourselves. How obvious is that they want us alone? They want us weak?
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  That is so evil.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  That is very evil. And of course, the satanic temple is the last part of this evolution that started in 1966.
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  The year zero of modern Satanism with the foundation of the Church of Satan.
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:17.000]  Then in the middle of the 70s, we had the satanic temple of Seth with Michael Aquino.
[2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  That was the second stage. He went on opera Winfrey.
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  He kind of mingled a little bit with celebrities with the New Age.
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  And then in 2012, 2013, the last stage, Satanism becomes political, starts to lobby and becomes the satanic temple, which is basically.
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  And you said, I remember you were on my show 10 years ago, you said soon they'll be lobbying, they'll be in your government.
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  And now they're openly saying it is our religious sacrament to kill babies, which it's always been.
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:52.000]  Absolutely. Unfortunately, that's a joke.
[2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  When you get into the killing of babies, you wave your connection to the Holy Spirit, the devil gets you.
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:01.000]  Can you explain how people briefly like when you do that, you cut God off?
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  You cut God off. And this whole ritual, which is also the pandemic is now symbolized in this designer who has made a bride wedding dress made out of damp face mask.
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:24.000]  It's also satanic. This is a satanic ritual that we are living, unfortunately, every day around us.
[2:52:24.000 --> 2:52:28.000]  Oppression is part of it. And we simply have to obey.
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  Leo Zagami, you have 15 more minutes, whether it's all about your books, what you see coming next, amazing.
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  Leo Zagami is always informative. But boy, is he on target.
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  Hour number four, then a bunch of news and your phone calls coming up. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:52.000]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death.
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  And it's caused massive supply chain problems across the Western world.
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storeable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  Their entire catalog is at infowarstore.com. You get an additional 10% off at infowarstore.com, but only for one more week.
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:17.000]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex, but that's it.
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:22.000]  They won't do this sale again until November. And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  This is insurance you can eat. It's the highest quality, hundreds of high quality foods, three months, six months, your supplies, all ready for you at infowarstore.com.
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  Recall toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. Again, infowarstore.com, 10% off on high quality, storeable food, ready to ship.
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:43.000]  But it ends in just one week, so take action now while you still can.
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, that it's criminals are extremely pathological.
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  Even more than general public, they do the same things over and over again, and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  Well, guess what? It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenice's globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV.
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:26.000]  And they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:32.000]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:54.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  Well, make no mistake. Everybody trying to sit on the fence, you're not going to be able to do that much longer.
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  We're in a major time of change. The globalists say they're about to destroy its civilization.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  Plaswab says it all. Why do they metaphysically, Leo Sagan? I mean, we've got one more segment with you, and then only you cover your own points.
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  My question to you, last question I have right now is, why do they metaphysically need to tell us what they're going to do to us?
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  Well, why do they do that?
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  Well, it's a sort of pre-programming of what we are about to be subject to. They are not really shy of saying what is coming up, because they have been programming us all along.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  And the masses are already ready to receive whatever is their next message, because they have, of course, been in control of Hollywood.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  They have been in control of the newspapers, of the various media. And now we have, of course, the incentive, which is a government like, for example, the Joe Biden government, which is open to censorship.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  And for them, this is very important, because that means no voices of dissent will be allowed.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  And now they want to re-discuss section 230. It's all about basically silencing the opposition and going forward with their own version of reality.
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  But also there is the satanic possession. The satanic possession, they are literally possessing more and more people.
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  During the pandemic, we had an increase in the demands for exorcism in the Catholic Church.
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  People locked up in their houses are facing not only their own demons, but they are facing demons, demons that are grabbing them through modern technology.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:26.000]  This is something that I've been discussing in this book, Volume 6.66, is the fact that the demonic uses these days, your computer uses basically the internet to get into your house and then, of course, possess those people who are weak.
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  And unfortunately, the pandemic has made a lot of people weak.
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:42.000]  So that is what is happening here. We have an increase in demonic possessions because Satan wants your soul and wants to grab it in one way or the other.
[2:57:42.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  And then the Vatican is not protecting you from all this. They actually at the beginning of the crisis said, oh, there is less people who are possessed, people should stay in their homes. They shouldn't really meet with priests because it's dangerous.
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:20.000]  So they have not really been supporting Jesus or God in the fight against the devil. They've been supporting instead this guy, Klaus Schwab and the whole Davos posse together with Prince Charles and the elite that wants us exterminated.
[2:58:20.000 --> 2:58:31.000]  Because as you remember, the father of Prince Charles once said that he wanted to come back as a virus to limit the, to destroy part of the world.
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:34.000]  He said a particularly deadly virus to go anywhere in the world.
[2:58:34.000 --> 2:58:50.000]  Yes. So he died. But he died, of course, after this pandemic starts. But we know already there is new pandemic, new viruses that are a monkeypox and many other things that have been prepared for us in the future.
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:59:04.000]  So the bacteriological warfare is ongoing. And unfortunately, the, the normality we used to have will only be possible in our own communities where we will say screw off this mask.
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:18.000]  We are free of living our life. But in mainstream society, they will be must for the next 1000 years. That's their intention is not the mass for the next two or three years.
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:27.000]  They will be mass forever. And you said that on the show a year ago, and now they've announced it is for ever covering up the human face made the image of God.
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:30.000]  I want to ask you to close in the next 10 minutes. Second, we come back in one minute.
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:35.000]  And makes the Muslims very happy. Yeah, makes them at the fact that the woman covers itself.
[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:49.000]  Now, exactly. It's all, it's all not look bad double the burgers running around. So when we come back in 60 seconds, if Satan had his way, what would the world look like? We know he comes to kill, show and destroy, but we'll talk about that in 60 seconds. Stay with us.
[3:00:06.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to infowarstore.com. But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away. Listen to this. Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health. Just one of these ingredients can be a life changing supplement for your health. And we've packed it all in to fibergreencaps at infowarstore.com.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:01:02.000]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day. I suggest that you do the same thing. And right now it's at an introductory price of 1995. That's 33% off at infowarstore.com.
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  Well, Leo Sagami is the best selling author and a friend of mine. In 2006, he decided to walk out of what he perceived as the criminal side of the new order.
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  Sagami is still at present at Grand Master, the Ordo. And he goes through the old Masonic Lodge he was in who are considered to be many of the good side, the Vatican Illuminati.
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  He's a blog that concentrating his direct involvement in the New World Order and the secret societies commonly known as the Illuminati. Sagami is the author of 12 published books based on a variety of subjects from the variety of the secret societies and the Vatican to geopolitical matters concerning the New World Order.
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:02:08.000]  Sagami now appears regularly on popular Italian TV shows, others around the world, LeoSagami.com. I've known about him at least since then. But tell us about your new book and just other key points you want to finish up the next nine minutes.
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  First of all, I want to just correct the fact that I'm no longer the Grand Master since I had to leave Italy. I had to also leave my position because it was sincerely impossible to find a good side to Freemasonry and a good side within the Illuminati that will really fight.
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  Well, I would say, yes, it should be updated to what has happened since 2019. As you know, I had to leave Italy because I was persecuted. They want to arrest me. And now I'm, of course, I've relocated here in the United States of America where I'm trying to survive
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  still warning people, even if the censorship is increasing about what has been happening because people like me, you have been doing this for a long time. Satan wants a robotic word. Satan and cyber Satan, like I call him in my book, is basically going to manifest ultimately for the artificial intelligence.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  But people are fighting with each other when the real enemy here is what is going to happen next when robots and artificial intelligence will take over. There is not going to be any longer a human enemy to face.
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  But it's going to be something truly evil that is also impossible even to imagine nowadays because we don't have the capabilities. Of course, science fiction has done many movies about it, Terminator and all that.
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  But I think that the future is going to be even worse than any science fiction.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  They're going to swallow and spray dust on us that goes into our cerebral cortex and our brainstem and just takes us over.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  Yes. And they want to take us over. But first of all, they want to weak us also in our human relations because, for example, they have been discussing over and over again what is dividing us.
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  This critical race theory is all about dividing us. That's why the race relations between black and white are hitting an all time low at the moment when in reality we are all part of the same human race and we all face the same enemy in the years to come.
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:48.000]  Let's expand on that. If we weren't made the image of God, what would Satan try to do with us? Why does Satan want to make us ugly, dumb us down, poison us and kill us, but first make us turn from God so I guess Satan gets the soul, gets the free will that angers God?
[3:04:48.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  Is that what it is?
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:05:07.000]  Yes, but Satan also knows that this is his last possibility and is unfortunately manifesting in front of our eyes. So for us, living in the year 2021 now, it seems almost impossible that we will be winning this war.
[3:05:07.000 --> 3:05:29.000]  That's why I ask all our viewers to have more faith in God, to have more faith and to find again the Holy Spirit that can guide them through these difficult times and try also to help those people who of course have to have a lot of psychological problems with what is going on.
[3:05:29.000 --> 3:05:36.000]  Sure, so what would God's in-game be versus the devil's in-game? The devil had complete free reign. What would that look like?
[3:05:36.000 --> 3:05:52.000]  Well, of course, we know that the end game for God is to reflect upon the self, the kingdom of God. So already the phrase itself gives us an announcement of things to come. It's not going to be a democracy, it's going to be a kingdom.
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:06:08.000]  This is going to be a little bit difficult to digest, but I would say that aside from this great republic in which we stand, created in 1776, most of the other forms of democracy have failed.
[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:12.000]  But the French Revolution was a devilish creation?
[3:06:12.000 --> 3:06:32.000]  Definitely, a diabolic creation also because it was in France that Satanism evolved before any other country in the world. Approximately five centuries ago, with Catherine de Medici, she celebrated, and she was the ruler of France, the first black mass.
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  And this is something else that I also talk in my books about extensively. Well, you know, we've got more segments to explain to us why they worship Satan, why they would have knowledge that God's real but choose Satan.
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  People now see Macron giving very strict and stringent laws, but Macron is coming from this tradition. Macron is itself a member of the Grand Orient de France.
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:07:09.000]  Grand Orient de France is a schismatic body of remission from 1877, abandoned, believing God, and opened up to basically all the ateists.
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  You are showing Catherine de Medici, by the way, was also connected with Nostradamus. She was the one who wanted to save her kingdom by using black magic, and she wanted to also save her child that had some sickness.
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:29.000]  So what she did, she celebrated on black mass that sacrificed a baby.
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:37.000]  So basically she wanted to use this great evil in order to save her kingdom. So that already shows you that.
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:43.000]  And that's why everything's based on pedophilia or hurting children, because that's the energy that the Satan demands.
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:55.000]  Absolutely. And then this Satanism that grow and grow in France then manifested ultimately in this revolution.
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:08:02.000]  This revolution that of course people would say there was a king that was not in touch with the people.
[3:08:02.000 --> 3:08:07.000]  Let all them admit it. The French Revolution is where they got communism.
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:16.000]  Absolutely, because the Illuminati, there was a guy from Italy, Philippe Boerotti, he came from Italy.
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:22.000]  He left Tuscany to participate in the French Revolution, was made a French citizen.
[3:08:22.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  And if you go in his Wikipedia, you can find that Philippe Boerotti, he was basically inspirational for Karl Marx.
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  So Karl Marx. Hold on, hold on. You can do more time doing this. I'm going to give you the floor like I've been doing.
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:41.000]  I want you to come out the next time and give us a brief ten minute history of the Illuminati.
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:45.000]  But stop there. Tell folks, because I've read a bunch of your books. I've not read your new book.
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  I want to get a copy and we should carry it in for where it's on.
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:51.000]  But where do we get your new books? Spend a few minutes on what your new book covers.
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  Well, my new books, I have a volume 6.66, which we discussed.
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:09:02.000]  I have also volume four, which is a very important book because here I talk about.
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:04.000]  I read that one. That's good. Yeah.
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:19.000]  And then, of course, I have a new edition of volume five, which I have basically rewrote adding 120 pages based also on this pandemic and why it's so important for the New World Order.
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:24.000]  So there is a plan. The plan, of course, we know was announced.
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:33.000]  Nobody believed in this this plan coming into fruition. But now that it's coming into fruition, we have to find also the solutions.
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:38.000]  That's a good thing that we are doing here today. We are trying to give the solution.
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  We're trying to tell the ordinary folk how we should protect himself from all this.
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  And the main thing is to understand that the Illuminati is not a myth, a legend.
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:58.000]  It's a reality. When I talk about Philip Bonerotti, you can actually go and find.
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  George Washington wrote letters against the Illuminati and the French Revolution, even though some say he was the head of the Illuminati.
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  So you could see there's an illuminated group and there's the false Illuminati and that gets people confused.
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  Let's come back from break and explain all that to people. Leo Zagami. Amazing.
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  How do people find the books again? Leo Zagami.com. Is that the best place?
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  Absolutely. Just go there or Google it and you will find a way to find the books.
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  I want to read the new one because I've read the other books.
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:28.000]  All right, we're going to come back and we're going to hit on the Illuminati.
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  What is it? What's its goal? How do we stop it? We know with Christ. That's how we do it.
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:35.000]  He's going to leave us in 10 minutes and I'm going to hit...
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  I haven't hit this other news on this universal eternal cell line news.
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:49.000]  Oh, you want to... I mean, this is real. Cells that never die. It's one dead black lady and one dead white kid that have this.
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:51.000]  We'll be right back.
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead.
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex? Good, bro.
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:09.000]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization, and absurdity.
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:14.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man. All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it. Get off the fence, get the product, support the import.
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:28.000]  Tyler in Maine. You're on the year. Thanks for holding it. Go ahead.

[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  Honored talk to you.
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  Awesome. So, firstly, I wanted to do is say I love the products, alpha power, even at 29.

[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:46.000]  I like that one. It works. It's not a joke.
[3:11:46.000 --> 3:12:10.000]  Absolutely.

[3:12:54.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:21.000]  I got a baby's brain and an old man's heart took 18 years to get this far. Don't always know what I'm talking about.
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:36.000]  It feels like I'm living in the middle of doubt.
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  It feels like I'm living in the middle of doubt.
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  It feels like I'm living in the middle of doubt.
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:25.000]  It feels like I'm living in the middle of doubt.
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  Anybody can be saved. We see it with that great guy. I like very much Michael Lindell. So anybody really can be saved. Believe me.
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:57.000]  As we know it was born in 1776. And this guy Philip Buonarrotti joined it and he wrote a book that became the quintessential text for all the revolutionaries.
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  He basically proposes a strategy that will revolutionize society by stages, starting from monarchy to liberalism, then to radicalism and finally to communism.
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  That's why I want to introduce to our viewers this figure, Philip Buonarrotti, because he is deemed as very important by the Illuminati up to this day and is part of the problem that we are living, unfortunately.
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  And so this French revolution with Buonarrotti that joined the Jacobean Club and was a friend of Napoleon Bonaparte, by the way, then nominated himself emperor.
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:55.000]  Out of their false revolutions always becomes an emperor. That was the Illuminati's plan out of my stop, as you know, was to go to all the other wars and bring in an absolute tyranny.
[3:15:55.000 --> 3:16:02.000]  Yes. And of course, then we have the distillery going one step further.
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:12.000]  In 1877, the Grand Orient of France abandoned completely God. People like Lenin and Trotsky became involved.
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:29.000]  Lenin and Trotsky then experimented, of course, this tyranny in the Soviet Union and became inspirational for what became then the early stages of the Chinese Communist Party, which started their long struggle to achieve
[3:16:29.000 --> 3:16:50.000]  then in 1949 power and create, of course, what we have nowadays. So this is all part of a history that is to be studied in detail, because in Russia, for example, there was an infernal club that was a little bit like the Hellfire
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:17:05.000]  pubs that we had here in this part, well, in Europe. So Lenin himself was an Illuminati, was the creator of something called the Grand Orient of the Russian people.
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:23.000]  In the Grand Orient of the Russian people substituted the Christian form of Freemasonry, which was present in Russia until then, because in Russia they used to practice basically what is known as the Swedish right, which derives from a Christian form of Freemasonry.
[3:17:23.000 --> 3:17:39.000]  Christian form of Freemasonry had to be abolished. And at that point, he welcomed something different, something different that, of course, has now taken over the world, because that's why it's so important what Macron is doing in France,
[3:17:39.000 --> 3:17:54.000]  because Macron and France are linked to that polar lodge, which was the first lodge from abroad that was granted permission to reopen once the Soviet Union ended.
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:18:10.000]  Tell us about George Washington's view. He was a Mason Scottish right, but he spoke out against the Illuminati, said they were Satanists. So what was the schism before then? Because I think Washington meant to be a Christian. I don't think he was a bad person. So why was he criticizing the Illuminati when he was obviously part of something similar?
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:21.000]  There is here a misconception. He wasn't really a Scottish right Freemason, because the ancient and accepted Scottish right started in 1805 with the establishment.
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:25.000]  He was never even led in under British Royals. He was actually fighting that.
[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:51.000]  Yes, so he was actually in a form of Freemasonry that predates the ancient and accepted Scottish right and he's actually more Christian. So what happened with George Washington is that he had a Christian imprint, a Christian version of Freemasonry that he wanted to promote. That's why he was critical of the Illuminati that were trying instead to destroy that form of Freemasonry.
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:59.000]  In 1782, they managed in a way to subvert Freemasonry thanks to...
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:06.000]  The word is that that European arm actually, through the first psychiatrist, murdered George Washington is what they say.
[3:19:06.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  That's possible. I don't know about that, but I know that George Washington is regarded in highest team by Freemasonry. Myself, when I was a member of Kerby Lodge's weight weight in London, I was always there admiring this beautiful painting that sits right inside the headquarters of the United
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:28.000]  Geron Lodge of England.
[3:19:28.000 --> 3:19:36.000]  The point is there's good and evil in every organization, but some are found every day. Some are found good.
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:46.000]  Unfortunately, though, I have to really admit, and it's very sudden for me that Freemasonry in this country today has been taken over by Satanists.
[3:19:46.000 --> 3:20:00.000]  The Geron Lodge of California, for example, requires you to get a vaccine to go and attend a Lodge meeting. They actually have two officers between your entrance, and this is absolutely insane.
[3:20:00.000 --> 3:20:04.000]  So here we have also a former...
[3:20:04.000 --> 3:20:12.000]  All the International Museum of Human Rights talking about satire becoming true is now saying you must have an injection to go into it.
[3:20:12.000 --> 3:20:20.000]  And then here, the former Grandmaster of the Geron Lodge of California is openly criticizing President Donald J. Trump.
[3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:32.000]  Conservatives are basically being getty-sized all over in various grand lodges. This didn't happen only in California, but also in New Mexico, in the Grand Lodge of New York.
[3:20:32.000 --> 3:20:45.000]  Conservatives are being getty-sized by an institution which itself has to do with the very foundation of the United States, so Americans shouldn't take sides with the Democrat Party.
[3:20:45.000 --> 3:20:58.000]  Instead, this is what is happening, unfortunately. So I personally have stopped going in Masonic lodges since I came to the conclusion that here in the United States they have been taken over by Satanists.
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:04.000]  Here in California, for example, the Ordo Tempe Orientis has taken over some of the lodges.
[3:21:04.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  So George Washington's fight to keep the Illuminati taking over Masonry was lost probably right after he died.
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:21.000]  Unfortunately, that's... I have to admit you're completely right, and that is also what I tried to explain in this book, Volume 5 of My Confessions, which actually...
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:28.000]  Well, I'd love to have you and your wife back go to dinner with my wife here in Austin, Texas. Leo, come on sooner. I know you're busy. You come on the war in Milan.
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:34.000]  Other shows. Incredible job. Amazing interview. And thank you so much, leosagami.com. Thank you, sir.
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:38.000]  Thank you, Alex. And let's pray for America. And let's pray for America.
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  Absolutely. I pray right now. All right. Thank you. All right. I got a bunch of breaking news and stuff I haven't covered yet. We'll hit when we come back.
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:51.000]  This is Leo Zagami. I'm Alex Sheldon, infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today. Thank you, Leo.
[3:22:15.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  That is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups. And we're still here.
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:30.000]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility's going up. That's why we've got to be taken off air. That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved. And America's still quasi-free. You can't have infowars has been proven right beyond error with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:48.000]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all. And get in infowars.com. Get some great 2020 election shirts. Supplements and so much more.
[3:22:48.000 --> 3:23:11.000]  They're wonderful products and they support the M4. Thank you.
[3:23:19.000 --> 3:23:28.000]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body. This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[3:23:28.000 --> 3:23:38.000]  They're now implementing it. And now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation. Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf A. Lois Hitler.
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:48.000]  And the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor, the train, the Couserville Institute in Germany. And volwars will continue to set fast. They fight this. I don't know how long we can. The enemy's coming for us all now.
[3:23:48.000 --> 3:24:10.000]  God bless and good luck. I would again get right with God right now.
[3:24:18.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  So please pray for us and please buy the products. And infowarsstore.com. They're great products. Plus, they fund the operation. So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:36.000]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:41.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:52.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word. Download everything we've done you can find and save it. Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:25.000]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away. Listen to this. Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.

And we've packed it all in to fibergreencaps at infowarsstore.com. So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.

[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:13.000]  Nothing matters.
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:15.000]  High noon.
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:19.000]  Finally nothing moves.
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  High noon.
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  Black dot rolling below the asphalt drive.
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:35.000]  A concrete fascination scraping the edge of nothing.
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:41.000]  This. This. Black.
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:49.000]  Planetary bombshell. Director of COVID-19 vaccine program. Since Pfizer injection, he races immune system.
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:59.000]  You already played that in the first and second hour. Now here we are in hour number four.
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:04.000]  I got a bunch of clips I want to get to in a bunch of breaking news, but man, I tell you.
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:13.000]  My job is so easy to prove tyranny now. I just wanted people motivated to say no to it because most people are like given to tyranny, it'll leave you alone.
[3:27:13.000 --> 3:27:22.000]  That's not how this works. The more you give in, the worse it gets. And you know, a lot of people are going to listen. A lot of folks aren't going to listen.
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:31.000]  But when folks back is up against the wall and their backs are literally shoved up against the wall.
[3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:39.000]  When you got that communist firing squad about to kill your ass or you watch your neighbors get killed, you're going to know there's nothing to do but to fight that point.
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:45.000]  I rather fight intellectually, economically, culturally, spiritually right now, before you got to do it physically.
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  But once the venerous civilization peels off, that's pretty easy to deal with too, isn't it?
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  I just feel sorry for everybody that's scared to die.
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:27:57.000]  They'll really sorry for you.
[3:27:57.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  And also, if they'll sorry for all the millions of the system, they're going to be crying for their mommies before it's all over.
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:07.000]  Let's go ahead and go to a really important report.
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:15.000]  Dr. Vladimir Zelinko is a orthodox, ultra-orthodox, they call him Jew, and he follows the Old Testament.
[3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:19.000]  And he's the guy that treated thousands of people and cured them all with hydroxychloroquine.
[3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:22.000]  He was the first, a year and a half ago, to first expose it.
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  And here he was with Dr. Joseph Mercola in a two-minute clip, knocking out of the park, saying,
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:37.000]  what type of psychopath, what type of sociopath, brags about how you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, but he'll have everything.
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:39.000]  Here it is.
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  Well, you'd have to be irrational or psychotic, I would think.
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:44.000]  Either one works.
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:54.000]  And then, let me continue, if I can. And then, if you look at another scary individual, his name's Klaus Schwab.
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:28:59.000]  He's the founder of the World Economic Forum.
[3:28:59.000 --> 3:29:02.000]  And people may not know of him, but he's very influential.
[3:29:02.000 --> 3:29:05.000]  He wrote the book COVID-19, The Great Reset.
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:08.000]  That's where the term, The Great Reset, became so popular.
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:18.000]  And in 2016, in a French interview, by the way, everything I'm saying is documented and could be seen and people could come to their own conclusions.
[3:29:18.000 --> 3:29:22.000]  Don't make the same mistake and just take my word for it.
[3:29:22.000 --> 3:29:24.000]  That's what you've done with the government.
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  Take my words and vet them, make sure that I'm not psychotic or nuts, and make sure that what I'm saying is in line with truth and then make your decisions.
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:48.000]  So in 2016, Klaus Schwab made an announcement that within 10 years, all of humanity will be tagged with an identifier.
[3:29:48.000 --> 3:29:58.000]  And then, if you look at the UN 2030 plan, which was crafted by the World Economic Forum, says the following.
[3:29:58.000 --> 3:30:00.000]  America will no longer be a superpower.
[3:30:00.000 --> 3:30:03.000]  That's a state agenda.
[3:30:03.000 --> 3:30:08.000]  Then my favorite is you'll own nothing and you'll be happy.
[3:30:08.000 --> 3:30:10.000]  You won't eat any meat.
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:13.000]  Fossil peels will be prohibited.
[3:30:13.000 --> 3:30:18.000]  There'll be a billion refugees, which will have to be integrated into your societies and other stuff like that.
[3:30:18.000 --> 3:30:31.000]  So my question is, what kind of sociopath feels entitled to make a statement like you will own nothing and you will be happy?
[3:30:31.000 --> 3:30:38.000]  What entitles this type of individual or group of individuals to think that way?
[3:30:38.000 --> 3:30:47.000]  Well, they believe that they're enlightened far beyond the average human or subhuman.
[3:30:47.000 --> 3:30:54.000]  And that is actually going on right now and the root of it is a war against God.
[3:30:54.000 --> 3:31:01.000]  They believe they're enlightened way beyond the average human or subhuman.
[3:31:01.000 --> 3:31:04.000]  He doesn't call us subhuman. He says they call us subhuman.
[3:31:04.000 --> 3:31:05.000]  And that's what this is.
[3:31:05.000 --> 3:31:09.000]  Uber mentioned this is where Hitler got his ideas.
[3:31:09.000 --> 3:31:11.000]  This is not Hitlerian.
[3:31:11.000 --> 3:31:13.000]  Hitler was just one branch of this.
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:17.000]  And so, let's talk about that.
[3:31:17.000 --> 3:31:19.000]  You have the communist takeover of South Africa.
[3:31:19.000 --> 3:31:20.000]  They break it up.
[3:31:20.000 --> 3:31:22.000]  They foment racial collapse.
[3:31:22.000 --> 3:31:25.000]  No food, no water, hundreds of thousands of diverse starvation.
[3:31:25.000 --> 3:31:28.000]  Millions have already died in Africa from the lockdowns.
[3:31:28.000 --> 3:31:32.000]  And the left is praising this as progress.
[3:31:32.000 --> 3:31:38.000]  Here's a clip at the grocery stores now in South Africa where you wait two, three hours to be able to get a few items.
[3:31:38.000 --> 3:31:41.000]  Here it is.
[3:31:41.000 --> 3:31:53.000]  Only one of us are fancy to come into the store. Only five items will be accepted.
[3:31:53.000 --> 3:32:01.000]  Only 20 items for a basket. Only 15 minutes to shop.
[3:32:01.000 --> 3:32:10.000]  No external refund will be allowed. No cashmacks or patrol will be allowed.
[3:32:10.000 --> 3:32:12.000]  So it's all an exercise in tyranny.
[3:32:12.000 --> 3:32:16.000]  And if we would stay closed, we'd still be closed like France or Australia.
[3:32:16.000 --> 3:32:21.000]  It's because we didn't put up with it in red areas, not that we're perfect, that it got taken off.
[3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:22.000]  But they're trying to bring it back.
[3:32:22.000 --> 3:32:28.000]  And Dana White did like a seven, eight minute interview on Fox News and said, oh, you survived the pandemic.
[3:32:28.000 --> 3:32:30.000]  Thank God you reopened.
[3:32:30.000 --> 3:32:31.000]  Look at the real statistics.
[3:32:31.000 --> 3:32:33.000]  This killed less than the flu, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:32:33.000 --> 3:32:41.000]  But here's Dana White, who is a trailblazer with leadership, getting everything else open from baseball to basketball to you name it,
[3:32:41.000 --> 3:32:48.000]  just by saying screw this and being one corporate leader against all the others that bucked the system and got attacked.
[3:32:48.000 --> 3:32:51.000]  Now he's making record profits. Now he's successful.
[3:32:51.000 --> 3:32:53.000]  That's an example of leadership here at us.
[3:32:53.000 --> 3:33:06.000]  I've been candidly on the broadcast before and now do you worry when you look around this country and you bleed red, white and blue, they were losing the charge, the energy, the fight to be successful.
[3:33:06.000 --> 3:33:10.000]  No matter what we do, are we losing that?
[3:33:10.000 --> 3:33:13.000]  Yeah, I think we are, to be honest with you.
[3:33:13.000 --> 3:33:15.000]  It's I don't know.
[3:33:15.000 --> 3:33:16.000]  I've never seen anything like it.
[3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:18.000]  It's it's blowing my mind.
[3:33:18.000 --> 3:33:37.000]  But you know what, everybody that's that's slowing down, everybody that is afraid or whatever their reason is for, you know, not wanting to get back to work, not wanting to, you know, to run their business, not wanting to get back to normal and full capacity.
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:39.000]  I'll run you all over.
[3:33:39.000 --> 3:33:40.000]  I'll run you over.
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:44.000]  Right. And that's the attitude of the 22 year old to the 32 year old.
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:50.000]  If people are going to sit on the sideline, that's an opportunity. No one ever gave you anything.
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:54.000]  Absolutely right. There's never been more opportunity out there than it is right now.
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:33:59.000]  You know, I keep hearing about restaurants that can't open all the way because they can't get people to come into work.
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:03.000]  You know, you can't get an Uber because nobody wants to go back and drive Uber.
[3:34:03.000 --> 3:34:07.000]  It's just it's a very weird time in this country right now.
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  And yeah, people need to get back to work and things need to get back to normal as soon as possible.
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:16.000]  You got the celebrity.
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:21.000]  Which is all just common sense. The big box stores, the big internet stores, they don't want you to ever open.
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  They want their competition out. They're the ones that first shut down a year and a half ago.
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  They're now lobbying for things to shut down.
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:31.000]  In fact, I've got the group that's behind trying to make three year olds wear masks.
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  Guess who's behind it? I'll tell you in the next segment.
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:39.000]  But here's an important clip.
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:48.000]  Here's Dr. Lena Wynn, the CHICOM operative on CNN saying mask for all. Here it is.
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:53.000]  If there is proof of vaccination and everybody is fully vaccinated, then you can take off your mask.
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:35:04.000]  It's time for us to reinstate some of these masking mandates while in the meantime, ideally aiming for proof of vaccination so that we can really boost our vaccination numbers.
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:09.000]  They want to put you back to the first trauma of having to put it back on again. They want to keep torturing you.
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:13.000]  None of it's about your safety. She's the same one that wants forced inoculations.
[3:35:13.000 --> 3:35:21.000]  This woman is a monster and they sit up there with their corporate talking points thinking that you are a complete idiot.
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:25.000]  When we come back, I've got a bunch of articles I want to hit in the final segment.
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:35.000]  I'm sure the war room is coming up today on this live July 21st, Wednesday broadcast. Please don't forget we're listed supported in fullwarstore.com.
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  A lot of sales are about to end. We have X2, the Deep Earth Allogen Ionon that's so good for your body, your immune system, it's selling out.
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:50.000]  But it's still discounted 40% off, so please support the broadcast.
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:56.000]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:36:01.000]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:06.000]  It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:12.000]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:23.000]  You've got red blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[3:36:23.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  And as crazier things are, I want to keep working under the future. But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:35.000]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:42.000]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for us. God bless.
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:28.000]  The world, slaves, Orson slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[3:37:28.000 --> 3:37:38.000]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world that realizes it's a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[3:37:38.000 --> 3:37:46.000]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world. And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery go to evil.
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  It is a spiritual battle, an info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.

[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  Thank you for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the product. The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it. Get off the fence, get the product, support the info wars.
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:29.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year. Thanks for rolling. Go ahead.
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:31.000]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:32.000]  Honored talk to you.
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  Awesome. So, personally, I wanted to do was say I love the products, alpha power, even at $29. If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom. So, just number one for a few years.
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  It definitely works. It's not a joke.
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:55.000]  Absolutely.
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  Wow. So much big news breaking here at the end of the transmission. I'm honored to be here, honored to be your host, thankful for all of you tuning in. The fact that you care and you're involved is the main hope this planet's got. This God is shining through you.
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:51.000]  Well, Senator Rand Paul isn't just calling for criminal investigations of Fauci caught red handed lying about getting a function. We've played those clips here, but we now have Rand Paul Fauci intimidate scientists from contradicting him because he controls all the funding.
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  And I've got a great example of that in a moment.
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:41:09.000]  But he controls all the funding. So people are deathly afraid of him. Researchers will not speak out. Why have there not been other scientists? I get letters from scientists all the time. You can find them. They're very distrustful of what he's saying. They don't think he's making sense.
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:19.000]  They don't think he's reading the science accurately, but they're afraid to speak out because many of them are university science and they depend on NIH funds and to cross him means it's the last money you'll ever get.
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:24.000]  So up by the way.
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:36.000]  Now, I heard earlier congressional hearing from six years ago, Fauci admitting a function. We have him at the gain of function conference he put on promoting a function in a moment, perjuring himself before Congress just again yesterday.
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  But first, Rand Paul's right. Look at the zero-hedge article. Is this why child doctors group suddenly demanded all children under the age of two or over the age of two wear a mask? Is this why the pediatricians said all children over two wear a mask?
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:57.000]  Guess who's funding it?
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  It is Pfizer.
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:09.000]  American Academy of Pediatrics main supporter, Pfizer.
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  Once your children still wearing masks, they can scare everyone into injecting them with a vaccine that isn't a vaccine that lowers their immunity so that they'll be addicted to Pfizer for life.
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:21.000]  This is beyond giving people opioids.
[3:42:21.000 --> 3:42:33.000]  I'm glad they've indicted companies that, you know, came out with the OxyContin. How about we indict Pfizer and Fauci and Bill Gates, who of course sells you the McDonald's food, the Monsanto, the cigarettes.
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  That's all legal and lawful, but pushing poison vaccines is not, I say, arrest Bill Gates.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  So here is Fauci at that gain of function conference I was talking about in 2012 that he now says he knows nothing about.
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:43:05.000]  Anyway, so let me just go on about NIH lifts funding pause on gain of function research. So let me explain this a little because whenever this comes out, there's always the pushing back and forth from the press.
[3:43:05.000 --> 3:43:09.000]  So like NIH now is going to do dangerous research.
[3:43:09.000 --> 3:43:28.000]  No, as a matter of fact, it's exactly the opposite. So a framework has been now established to guide funding decisions on proposed research that might be anticipated to create, transfer or use enhanced potential pandemic pathogens.
[3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:43.000]  The program, everybody has to have a neat little name to it. This is called P3CO. So if you hear about P3CO, it's potential pandemic preparedness, care and oversight.
[3:43:43.000 --> 3:43:48.000]  Now, why is this different from everything else we've been doing?
[3:43:48.000 --> 3:44:01.000]  It's different because remember the trouble we used to get in when someone would do an experiment, they were submitted to a journal and just as it's getting ready to go out, everybody would start scrambling around, should we be publishing, should it not.
[3:44:01.000 --> 3:44:08.000]  So we decided to go upstream from that and talk about decisions that are made by government funded.
[3:44:08.000 --> 3:44:20.000]  Remember, we have no control over things that are not funded by the government, but in government funded activities to guide the funding decision before you actually do the experiment.
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:28.000]  I don't think this is going to be foolproof. Things are going to slip through, but I think this is a much better approach than we've had before.
[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:33.000]  That's right. They cut the scientists and others out so they wouldn't complain about gain of function.
[3:44:33.000 --> 3:44:41.000]  So there's another example. They cooked it up. They released it. He said trouble be challenged by a novel virus by a pandemic in 2017.
[3:44:41.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  And yes, they did.
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:56.000]  Meanwhile, McCarthy pulls his five GOP members from one sixth committee at the Pelosi rejects two of his picks because they might actually bring up the Democrats staging most of it.
[3:44:56.000 --> 3:45:07.000]  Another one, vast majority of Cape Cod clusters were vaccinated. New big article out ABC news is reporting on that right there.
[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:11.000]  So Fauci says 99% of the new cases and deaths.
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:15.000]  Where do you get that? There's no statistic there. It's out of his rear end.
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:29.000]  But here it is, the vast majority just like the reporting in Europe and the UK and Canada and the US, the vast majority are vaccinated of people sick of hospitalized and of people dying.
[3:45:29.000 --> 3:45:32.000]  Don't worry, Fauci, the little liar.
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:38.000]  It's up there and tells you that that is not the case.
[3:45:38.000 --> 3:45:45.000]  Here it is Fauci, more than 99% of people who died from COVID in June are not vaccinated. You read the whole AP article.
[3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:52.000]  Nowhere does it say any of that. There's not a link. There's not a fact that we have all these other studies saying the opposite.
[3:45:52.000 --> 3:45:55.000]  Most of the deaths are from the vaccinated.
[3:45:55.000 --> 3:45:57.000]  They just call it COVID-19.
[3:45:57.000 --> 3:46:01.000]  This is the biggest fraud ever seen by these cameras.
[3:46:01.000 --> 3:46:04.000]  And look, I'm really proud of the last four hours.
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  I was up till 3.30, 4 in the morning. Well, I was up till about 4.
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:11.000]  Last month, the clock, it was like 3.47.
[3:46:11.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  I was just so on fire in all this research and I kind of ran out of energy the last hour.
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:20.000]  And I'm exhausted, but I'm going to do an interview with Jason Bermas, so it should be all right.
[3:46:20.000 --> 3:46:22.000]  No rest for the wicked, as they say.
[3:46:22.000 --> 3:46:26.000]  And so that's coming up at the war rooms coming up, 3 to 6 p.m. Central.
[3:46:26.000 --> 3:46:33.000]  And then I can get a nap for an hour. I want to keep working because I didn't hit the immortal cell lines.
[3:46:33.000 --> 3:46:37.000]  Did you know it's admitted they had human animal clones in the 60s?
[3:46:37.000 --> 3:46:41.000]  Did you know it's admitted they found a black lady that got eaten by a cancer?
[3:46:41.000 --> 3:46:45.000]  They believe the cells were alien. They call it new species or alien.
[3:46:45.000 --> 3:46:52.000]  I've got all mainline John Hopkins, British Medical Journal, right here.

[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:10.000]  The entire modern medicine is built on her.
[3:47:10.000 --> 3:47:20.000]  Talk about slavery. They finally paid her family $600,000, even though they estimate her cells are worth over a trillion dollars.

[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:50.000]  Who knows what they're up to? The point is we're in a lot of trouble.
[3:47:50.000 --> 3:47:52.000]  Admitting to it will get us out of the trouble.
[3:47:52.000 --> 3:47:55.000]  I think we pray to God and get right with God.
[3:47:55.000 --> 3:47:59.000]  But regardless, we didn't stand up for all those unborn babies.
