[00:00.000 --> 00:12.300]  We are on the march the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[00:12.300 --> 00:35.360]  We are on the march the Empire is on the run we've been running that intro the
[00:35.360 --> 00:44.360]  intro you're listening to right now since about 1998 we are on the march the
[00:44.360 --> 00:52.560]  Empire is on the run what is the Empire the Empire of lies the Empire of fraud
[00:52.560 --> 00:58.580]  the Empire of cheating the Empire of deceit and globalist manipulation the
[00:58.580 --> 01:05.200]  Empire of government through conquest culture through conquest and fuggish
[01:05.200 --> 01:10.820]  brutal oppression versus government oven by the people government of
[01:10.820 --> 01:20.080]  renaissance government of openness it is the great paradox but sometimes I hear
[01:20.080 --> 01:26.400]  that promo that intro and I think yes we are on the march the Empire is on the
[01:26.400 --> 01:30.580]  run other times a look at all the tyranny expanding like a metastasizing
[01:30.580 --> 01:40.660]  cancer and I say to myself humanity is falling goodness is collapsing evil the
[01:40.660 --> 01:46.620]  Empire the globalist invisible hand the invisible Empire is coming out in the
[01:46.620 --> 01:50.580]  open and it is on the march the truth is evil is always on the march and good is
[01:50.580 --> 01:54.780]  always on the march and there are those competing forces in the world and there
[01:54.780 --> 01:59.060]  are many other variants and forces in the world the globalists are not in
[01:59.060 --> 02:04.260]  control they don't have total control they're lusting after a technotronic
[02:04.260 --> 02:13.220]  technocratic panopticonic global dehumanizing computerized omnipresent
[02:13.220 --> 02:19.220]  counterfeit godlike system the Pentagon calls it the mind of God these
[02:19.220 --> 02:24.740]  computers they're building to attempt total control but if they themselves are
[02:24.740 --> 02:29.660]  falling creatures how could they ever even imagine that they could harness or
[02:29.660 --> 02:36.540]  control such a force I've got to cover the news today and I say that so many
[02:36.540 --> 02:39.940]  times when we start a broadcast but it's absolutely got to be covered this
[02:39.940 --> 02:46.420]  evening there is so much to go over just huge news on every front
[02:46.420 --> 02:54.540]  look at these headlines West poised to join forces with Assad the Washington
[02:54.540 --> 03:01.180]  Post says was Putin right saying the West was aiding Al Qaeda what does that
[03:01.180 --> 03:09.620]  mean what do these headlines signify meanwhile Libya is completely falling
[03:09.620 --> 03:15.220]  to Al Qaeda right now these of the country don't have under control for
[03:15.220 --> 03:20.780]  four years even before Gaddafi fell they are murdering every Christian and
[03:20.780 --> 03:25.500]  every Muslim and every black person they get their hands on you'll hear no
[03:25.500 --> 03:33.420]  coverage of it but the headline in Bloomberg is why Libby is a failed
[03:33.420 --> 03:38.620]  state now oh it's like shoving an old woman at the mall down an escalator just
[03:38.620 --> 03:41.580]  hitting her in the back of the head watching her tumble down and break her
[03:41.580 --> 03:47.260]  neck and going someone calling ambulance she broke her neck in front of
[03:47.260 --> 03:50.260]  everybody just punch her right in the back of the head or hit her with a
[03:50.260 --> 03:54.820]  blackjack or a baseball bat right square in the head she goes tumbling down and
[03:54.820 --> 04:03.660]  granny tries to get up oh bams are breaking her legs she got hurt but the
[04:03.660 --> 04:10.620]  public can't find Libya right between Egypt and Tunisia with both eyeballs on
[04:10.620 --> 04:15.900]  a map even when it's named foreign media comes to the US and makes fun of us
[04:15.900 --> 04:21.380]  and shows people world maps they can't even find Australia or England on it but

[08:36.340 --> 08:41.300]  the chancellor of Germany jets into Kiev that's the capital of your new listener
[08:41.300 --> 08:47.340]  or a public school educated person like myself of Ukraine as tensions soar over
[08:47.340 --> 09:00.060]  Ukraine China hosts largest military drill with Russia as China basically
[09:00.060 --> 09:04.060]  threatens the United States to have its jets back off its coastline that's in
[09:04.060 --> 09:12.940]  Bloomberg continuing Iran is unveiling new missiles and drones Libyan
[09:12.940 --> 09:18.940]  Islamists sees Tripoli Airport as parliament dual set to unfold as Al Qaeda
[09:18.940 --> 09:25.820]  prepares to take full control of Libya our government removed Gaddafi who worked
[09:25.820 --> 09:30.260]  with the West for eight years turned over all his weapons and apologized
[09:30.260 --> 09:34.740]  shut him up turned Al Qaeda loose they are ten times worse this is a
[09:34.740 --> 09:38.100]  destabilization program we're going to continue with analysis of that but
[09:38.100 --> 09:44.140]  there's the headline new fear what happens in Ferguson if there's no charges
[09:44.140 --> 09:51.340]  associated press as evidence mounts that the police officer was attacked and had
[09:51.340 --> 09:57.660]  his rotary bone around his eye broken and his eyewitnesses videos emerge with
[09:57.660 --> 10:03.460]  people reporting that just that had happened and the officer story is true
[10:03.460 --> 10:09.980]  then I ask the question why in the world is there no dash cam video a but they
[10:09.980 --> 10:14.140]  turned it off be why aren't the police parading out all these witnesses that
[10:14.140 --> 10:18.060]  shot cell phone video minutes after it happened local residents that are black
[10:18.060 --> 10:22.700]  talking about what happened all confirming what the officer said really
[10:22.700 --> 10:28.940]  stirring things up Obama is stirring things up saying police that are
[10:28.940 --> 10:34.860]  militarizing with few checks he's launching an investigation of the
[10:34.860 --> 10:39.540]  militarization of police that is really rich my friends that's from the Hill
[10:39.540 --> 10:43.580]  newspaper because it's the federal government that has been giving the
[10:43.580 --> 10:51.260]  training the grants the uniforms the armored vehicles just all of it
[10:51.340 --> 10:55.820]  while the globalist through the federal government destabilized the country
[10:55.820 --> 11:00.860]  forced people on welfare basically by deindustrialization open the borders up
[11:00.860 --> 11:05.500]  ran corporation 20 years ago wrote about the destabilization plan for the u.s.
[11:05.500 --> 11:10.100]  the answer would be the national stabilization force first published in
[11:10.100 --> 11:18.060]  1997 I covered on local radio and on access television I was a weirdo you know
[11:18.060 --> 11:21.260]  I read government documents and things that were public I go down to the UT
[11:21.260 --> 11:25.940]  law library and get the hard copies of it and I would show people the plan to
[11:25.940 --> 11:30.180]  collapse America and bring in an authoritarian state in the name of
[11:30.180 --> 11:34.100]  stopping the collapse see because the collapse is coming oh now we need the
[11:34.100 --> 11:37.700]  armored vehicles we need the militarized police been warning people for a long
[11:37.700 --> 11:42.860]  time as I thought it because they're going to collapse the system and then
[11:42.860 --> 11:47.060]  the militarized police will stabilize things of course in the next phase they'll
[11:47.060 --> 11:51.500]  send in feds to take over talk radio the internet free speech and arrest the
[11:51.500 --> 11:57.020]  political opposition of the next socialist communist total takeover this
[11:57.020 --> 12:00.380]  is not my opinion I told you everything that's coming up into this point so we're
[12:00.380 --> 12:03.780]  trying to checkmate them to wake up the police and military so see the larger
[12:03.780 --> 12:08.660]  plan and the state legislatures and people that aren't total criminals in
[12:08.660 --> 12:12.660]  Congress to see the game plan decompartmentalize it and reverse the
[12:12.660 --> 12:18.020]  whole program you can watch films I made in the year 2000 police state to the
[12:18.020 --> 12:23.220]  takeover where I detail this total takeover plan and no I didn't come up
[12:23.220 --> 12:28.500]  with this on my own I was told this by major police chiefs I was told this by
[12:28.500 --> 12:31.980]  the head of emergency management in Kingsville Texas I was told this
[12:31.980 --> 12:36.140]  basically by the San Antonio police chief I was told this by a lot of
[12:36.140 --> 12:42.060]  government sources because I was willing to go on air and talk about it
[12:43.860 --> 12:49.380]  because they were all approached to be paid off by Homeland Security before it
[12:49.380 --> 12:54.540]  even existed publicly under Clinton so this program was already set up under
[12:54.540 --> 12:58.540]  Clinton Jimmy Carter set it up Reagan let it go for a while but Clinton will
[12:58.540 --> 13:03.900]  really set it up officially the the the the continuity of government COG
[13:03.900 --> 13:08.500]  Northcom program then 9-11 comes and then it's oh it's about terror so it's
[13:08.500 --> 13:13.780]  okay that's the public roll out of it then Obama gets back in the Democrats
[13:13.780 --> 13:17.740]  get back in the Clintons get their third term through Obama basically and oh my
[13:17.740 --> 13:22.100]  gosh we're gonna use Homeland Security on the Tea Party veterans and gun owners
[13:22.100 --> 13:28.140]  when it was always set up for that from the beginning and I told you all that
[13:28.140 --> 13:32.380]  was coming on the day of 9-11 when it happened I said you watch in a decade or
[13:32.380 --> 13:36.580]  so this will be used against the general public if you're not a criminal if you're
[13:36.580 --> 13:39.660]  a moral person they don't like you because you stand in the way of their
[13:39.660 --> 13:44.300]  takeover and that means taking your pension funds it means taking your bank
[13:44.300 --> 13:48.100]  accounts it means bail ins as they call them they've already done this in over a
[13:48.100 --> 13:54.020]  hundred other countries the last 60 years or so and the average person at
[13:54.020 --> 13:57.300]  Northcom is a good man or woman the average cops a good person the average
[13:57.300 --> 14:00.980]  FBI person is not bad they're compartmentalized folks and they're being
[14:00.980 --> 14:04.380]  rolled out on legitimate missions while in the background the training
[14:04.380 --> 14:09.420]  accelerates for the criminal tyrannical missions but see after collapse after the
[14:09.420 --> 14:14.220]  terrorists after ISIS smuggles a nuke into the US and detonates it and why it
[14:14.220 --> 14:17.580]  will be tied to the Tea Party that's already in the Army War College training
[14:17.580 --> 14:22.100]  that the Tea Party will merge with Al Qaeda and attack America again that's
[14:22.100 --> 14:29.060]  saying that Superman will join forces with Lex Luthor or that Spiderman will
[14:29.060 --> 14:34.860]  join forces with the Green Goblin does it matter if it doesn't make sense it
[14:34.860 --> 14:38.660]  doesn't make sense to have our government fund Al Qaeda to attack Assad three
[14:38.660 --> 14:43.420]  years ago and try to bomb Assad so he couldn't defeat him it doesn't make
[14:43.420 --> 14:48.220]  sense to give him 15,000 stinger missiles that's mainstream news now that
[14:48.220 --> 14:52.660]  they were given those missiles in Benghazi and we told you they start
[14:52.660 --> 14:56.620]  targeting the West that'd be the next new wave of why they need tanks on the
[14:56.620 --> 15:01.660]  streets and checkpoints is for ISIS or IS or all the new names of Al Qaeda and
[15:01.660 --> 15:08.540]  they'll probably let IS in they'll attack and then the Homeland Security
[15:08.540 --> 15:13.500]  apparatus will be for your political speech it'll be to shut you up it'll be
[15:13.500 --> 15:17.940]  to make sure you go along with your pension fund being taken not for IS
[15:17.940 --> 15:23.060]  that's how this works ladies and gentlemen how many times you have to
[15:23.060 --> 15:27.060]  hear me predict everything that will happen before it happens how many
[15:27.060 --> 15:31.460]  times do you have to be told exactly how the world works before you'll listen
[15:31.460 --> 15:34.420]  to me and stop it I'm talking to legislators I'm talking to governors

[20:02.140 --> 20:07.620]  direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[20:07.620 --> 20:30.380]  I was looking at a photograph on infowars.com from Obama a few months ago
[20:30.380 --> 20:38.100]  meeting with world leaders at the G7 with Merkel and others and it just struck
[20:38.100 --> 20:44.300]  me something I already knew but the image told a thousand words that whether
[20:44.300 --> 20:48.740]  it's the leader of France the leader of England or the leader of Germany or the
[20:48.740 --> 20:52.820]  leader of the Netherlands or the leader of the United States or Canada or South
[20:52.820 --> 20:59.700]  Africa when you go look at who finances the campaigns and who owns the media in
[20:59.700 --> 21:06.380]  those countries and who is writing the agendas it's a handful of megabanks that
[21:06.380 --> 21:12.380]  own the defense contractor companies and of course the insurance companies and
[21:12.380 --> 21:16.180]  that's why they have the same government policies in England that we have in the
[21:16.180 --> 21:22.820]  US that you have in Australia it is all developed rolled out and deployed and
[21:22.820 --> 21:26.980]  it's done incrementally to make it all sound reasonable but what you see is a
[21:26.980 --> 21:32.380]  radical transformation of society to a totalitarian system and that's what
[21:32.380 --> 21:37.660]  William Benny number four at the NSA highest level whistleblower ever said
[21:37.660 --> 21:43.100]  a few months ago to the Guardian and a few weeks ago on this radio show that the
[21:43.100 --> 21:48.380]  NSA is targeted to control political dissent and to bring in totalitarianism
[21:48.380 --> 21:54.660]  or total control people say hey I want to play fantasy football and get drunk I
[21:54.660 --> 22:00.740]  don't care do you want to know what the total control is it's like people that
[22:00.740 --> 22:06.220]  say I don't care if the government spies on me I have nothing to hide really
[22:06.220 --> 22:12.220]  why do you have blinds on your windows why do you lock your door because you
[22:12.220 --> 22:19.780]  may not have anything to hide but your instinct is seal the front of the cave
[22:19.780 --> 22:24.740]  at night because the neighboring village might do a night raid on you and
[22:24.740 --> 22:28.900]  kill you and haul your women and children off or a big cave bear might
[22:28.900 --> 22:35.500]  come in and eat you and your family or wolves might come in or in modern days
[22:35.500 --> 22:39.460]  the government and black uniforms might drag you away because that's what every
[22:39.460 --> 22:42.500]  government ends up doing when it's allowed to do what it wants because the
[22:42.500 --> 22:46.820]  worst the worst end up getting in because the public stands down and evil
[22:46.820 --> 22:52.340]  people crave control basic psychology and they get control and their worst
[22:52.340 --> 22:59.740]  dreams that are our nightmares come true Ted Bundy had dreams their
[22:59.740 --> 23:04.780]  nightmares to us Hitler had dreams their nightmares to us Stalin had dreams we
[23:04.780 --> 23:09.500]  call them nightmares Jeffrey Dahmer had dreams we call them nightmares see
[23:09.500 --> 23:13.340]  people say hey what do I have to hide I'm gonna post where I live and what I
[23:13.340 --> 23:22.060]  own and when I go on vacation on Facebook and you get robbed oh I don't
[23:22.060 --> 23:24.900]  care if my personal dad is out there I mean let these corporations government
[23:24.900 --> 23:33.540]  share it letting it stolen as you know what I have to hide that's like leaving
[23:33.540 --> 23:38.740]  your hotel room open if you're visiting the Bahamas you will be robbed but
[23:38.740 --> 23:45.100]  that's the spirit of our age be a schmuck be gullible it's honored to be
[23:45.100 --> 23:49.580]  mindless and and not know anything and and not care and and just want to be
[23:49.580 --> 23:56.100]  robbed and people that are informed and know the names of countries and laws I
[23:56.100 --> 24:05.340]  mean those are weirdos I'll get into the news but I was watching ESPN today when
[24:05.340 --> 24:16.500]  I was on the elliptical at the gym with a sound off but I was reading the text on
[24:16.500 --> 24:21.540]  the closed captioning and it was all these college football coaches and their
[24:21.540 --> 24:29.300]  different sports jackets and team jerseys so deadly serious putting off the
[24:29.300 --> 24:33.820]  mannerisms of a male war chief who will lead the tribe to happy hunting grounds
[24:33.820 --> 24:37.540]  and success and and and debating and arguing what would come up in the new
[24:37.540 --> 24:41.860]  year and how the game should work and how the bulls should work and oh my gosh
[24:41.860 --> 24:46.140]  it was so serious male soap opera what do you think the Romans and others
[24:46.140 --> 24:50.420]  developed games that they said so the public would mindlessly only care about
[24:50.420 --> 24:59.020]  games and and remain children while the adults the elite ran the world and made
[24:59.020 --> 25:05.660]  the decisions they live we sleep would be one allegory used by John Carpenter and
[25:05.660 --> 25:12.620]  they live or parable so it isn't that I don't get a football or baseball game
[25:12.620 --> 25:15.500]  oh believe me I get it I mean that you're looking at somebody when you know
[25:15.500 --> 25:18.540]  grew up in Dallas Texas you go Dallas Cowboy games give me a break folks I
[25:18.540 --> 25:29.660]  played football it's that it is deployed sickeningly to control the public and
[25:29.660 --> 25:36.180]  interlaced with anti-gun pro-Obama care just garbage and beer commercials and
[25:36.180 --> 25:40.180]  just all of it just admit you're being manipulated just admit you're being
[25:40.180 --> 25:45.260]  preyed on and then from that you can make the decision on whether you want to
[25:45.260 --> 25:48.180]  be conscious whether you want to be involved whether you want to build a
[25:48.180 --> 25:54.620]  better world or you want to be a thug because football and baseball when you
[25:54.620 --> 26:01.700]  look at the spectrum of propaganda at least it's human competition it's
[26:01.700 --> 26:08.020]  athleticism there's something good there compared to gangster rap and
[26:08.020 --> 26:15.580]  sugar night getting shot and MTV in the mid 90s on record I've talked to former

[33:26.900 --> 33:32.900]  network I jumped the gun as I often do I'm gonna spend a little bit of time next
[33:32.900 --> 33:39.180]  hour talking about chug night shot at Sunset Strip Club during Chris Brown
[33:39.180 --> 33:44.740]  party two others hit and of course he was there when many of the people he
[33:44.740 --> 33:51.580]  brought into gangster hip-hop were also shot and killed biggie Tupac I mean I
[33:51.580 --> 33:55.620]  barely even follow this stuff but I'm aware of what's going on I just have
[33:55.620 --> 34:00.260]  been contacted over the years by some of the most famous founders of hip-hop out
[34:00.260 --> 34:04.780]  there the folks with public enemy we've interviewed quite a few of them
[34:04.780 --> 34:09.260]  professor Griff and others of course the Keras one and others but then I
[34:09.260 --> 34:16.700]  separately with high-level multiple high-level household name rock stars who
[34:16.700 --> 34:23.780]  were in MTV in the mid 90s and early 90s from their perspective they were being
[34:23.780 --> 34:27.420]  told sorry we don't care of your number one or number two we're gonna promote
[34:27.420 --> 34:36.260]  death rap basically that's the orders coming down from the government so just
[34:36.260 --> 34:41.180]  like the CIA and the globalist found Al Qaeda to further radicalize Muslims and
[34:41.180 --> 34:46.260]  then build systems to destroy them while taking Americans liberties the system
[34:46.260 --> 34:50.900]  literally what was declassified last year that I've been told by experts for
[34:50.900 --> 34:57.620]  decades that the CIA promoted the downfall of culture and morals and the
[34:57.620 --> 35:04.020]  exportation of meaningless ugly art so that people couldn't differentiate what
[35:04.020 --> 35:10.820]  was beautiful classically from what was ugly that's why I have government
[35:10.820 --> 35:18.780]  funding oh $300,000 for a photo of a crucifix in a brandy glass of urine the
[35:18.780 --> 35:25.140]  famous piss Christ I don't say that to be vulgar I'm just documenting in here

[35:31.260 --> 35:35.980]  it yeah there's the London independence headline modern art was CIA weapon boom
[35:35.980 --> 35:45.020]  and even if you like some of the art Pollock and others the point was they
[35:45.020 --> 35:50.060]  would even put some good stuff out Pollock of course was one of them that's
[35:50.060 --> 35:55.820]  been declassified show that they could set the precedent of what art was
[35:55.820 --> 36:10.500]  because you control style and art you control everything not many people can
[36:10.500 --> 36:15.380]  hand paint a Rembrandt and capture the light and everything a lot of people
[36:15.380 --> 36:21.900]  can do it Jackson Pollock and boy haven't they been successful because once
[36:21.900 --> 36:28.340]  they get you to accept a Jackson Pollock that you know five monkeys on PCP
[36:28.340 --> 36:33.420]  could paint easily once you get them to accept that well then you can get them
[36:33.420 --> 36:38.980]  to accept Marilyn Manson vomiting on stage talking about killing children and
[36:38.980 --> 36:42.460]  of course it's just to be shocking from his level but why did some of the red
[36:42.460 --> 36:49.140]  stone on record I saw PBS documentary about this for five years promote him
[36:49.140 --> 36:53.980]  when it was losing ratings and other nasty stuff till it caught on because
[36:53.980 --> 37:02.940]  it's an agenda it's an order it's a program it's a plan so gangster rap I
[37:02.940 --> 37:09.100]  mean look listen in 1945 you can look the numbers up there was less illegitimacy
[37:09.100 --> 37:15.020]  in the black community than there was in the white less babies out of wedlock you
[37:15.020 --> 37:20.820]  fast forward to 2014 right at 90% of blacks are born illegitimately you say
[37:20.820 --> 37:24.700]  and the spin is why are you against single mothers no no no just side effect
[37:24.700 --> 37:28.980]  three to four times more likely to be in prison or on drugs or to die or commit
[37:28.980 --> 37:32.620]  suicide yada yada yada we all know it the point is nobody's bashing single
[37:32.620 --> 37:37.740]  mothers the point is they're engineering the society to break it because
[37:37.740 --> 37:44.940]  it's not a broken system it's agenda 21 cloward and piven writ large agenda 21
[37:44.940 --> 37:49.380]  cloward and piven are just program names for a few agendas within the whole
[37:49.380 --> 37:54.700]  agenda to balkanized dumb down turn us into thugs turn us into mindless idiots
[37:54.700 --> 37:59.860]  so that we won't stand up for anything blank slates of just worldly dumb people
[37:59.860 --> 38:04.700]  who will accept whatever's trending whether it be university of texas
[38:04.700 --> 38:14.020]  football or whether it be self-mutilation or whether it be Islamophobia pick
[38:14.020 --> 38:19.980]  whatever version of it you want or la raza hispanic Ku Klux Klan Larica and
[38:19.980 --> 38:25.580]  quista or or or new black panther party justice department funded rate it's all
[38:25.580 --> 38:30.140]  dividing us why they've got new shows about fishermen northerners against
[38:30.140 --> 38:34.100]  southerners and they've got shows about black against white and man against
[38:34.100 --> 38:37.900]  woman and that's how you get ahead in the world is getting to be part of a
[38:37.900 --> 38:43.100]  group and screwing over the other ones while the globalists sit back knowing
[38:43.100 --> 38:46.460]  that if we ever come together around the principles of liberty if we ever click
[38:46.460 --> 38:50.260]  to that and come together around justice and freedom and honor that that's the
[38:50.260 --> 38:55.100]  real value that's the real possession prosperity follows and then we have a new
[38:55.100 --> 38:58.980]  golden age of freedom and then all these kleptocrats that have robbed us blind
[38:58.980 --> 39:02.820]  and stolen hundreds of trillions of dollars and that are building giant
[39:02.820 --> 39:07.180]  FEMA camps now on record and army manuals about mowing down crowds of
[39:07.180 --> 39:11.140]  people during collapse none of that would have to happen but I've watched the
[39:11.140 --> 39:14.860]  globalists in third-world country and in old-world countries and in Western
[39:14.860 --> 39:21.500]  countries now bring them down destroy them to rebuild them and their image of
[39:21.500 --> 39:29.100]  tyranny and so I can cover all this news and I'm going to today but until we pull
[39:29.100 --> 39:35.980]  back and look at the agenda of the ruling class that is not capitalist that is not
[39:35.980 --> 39:41.140]  free market they do everything they do under that guys while they fund the
[39:41.140 --> 39:45.020]  socialists the fascists the totalitarians the communists as Carol
[39:45.020 --> 39:49.700]  quickly wrote in the mid 1960s in tragedy and hope 1,100 pages long we
[39:49.700 --> 39:55.300]  sell the book back in print at info or store.com if you dare read it the head
[39:55.300 --> 39:58.820]  of Georgetown political science Bill Clinton's mentor when he joined the
[39:58.820 --> 40:02.900]  central intelligence agency and was sent to London England with Hillary is fake
[40:02.900 --> 40:09.420]  arranged marriage classic spice all declassified who Bill Clinton thanked in
[40:09.420 --> 40:16.580]  his inauguration Carol quickly explained it all and he thought the public was so
[40:16.580 --> 40:20.940]  dumb he argued for its public publishing and at first it wasn't he argues in the
[40:20.940 --> 40:24.420]  book that the public should be told about the world government plan the
[40:24.420 --> 40:27.820]  eugenics plan and he said the public is so dumb they're not going to want to know
[40:27.820 --> 40:32.060]  those that do want to know will want to join us you might want to read it it's
[40:32.060 --> 40:35.180]  love under pages long we'll know what runs the world how everything operates
[40:35.180 --> 40:41.100]  we're even bigger presents he's five books read Alvin and Heidi Toffler's
[40:41.100 --> 40:45.580]  books which puts a pop spin on it but you'll find out I mean listen what you're
[40:45.580 --> 40:50.300]  hearing from me is not my opinion that's what I keep trying to get across to all
[40:50.300 --> 40:54.700]  you out there they are putting poison in the water they are putting nanotech
[40:54.700 --> 41:02.260]  garbage and cancer viruses and micro plasms in the vaccines they are brain
[41:02.260 --> 41:07.020]  damaging the public I mean you're in a you know about all the secret testing on
[41:07.020 --> 41:10.500]  the troops and minorities and poor people you know about Hitler you know
[41:10.500 --> 41:13.340]  about the Kaiser villain Institute everybody knows the Rockefeller's
[41:13.340 --> 41:17.700]  funded Hitler that's even pop pop culture well who do you think runs this
[41:17.700 --> 41:22.100]  country by the way there was a big earthquake I haven't even gotten to
[41:22.100 --> 41:26.500]  that obviously a 6.0 that hit up in northern California but also shook
[41:26.500 --> 41:32.820]  San Francisco we're gonna talk about that some but did you know that the
[41:32.820 --> 41:37.180]  Baroness Philippine de Rothschild one of the heads of the Rothschild family
[41:37.180 --> 41:42.500]  reportedly tied into trillions of dollars very interesting lady she died
[41:42.500 --> 41:46.860]  yesterday right up there in Sonoma County where the earthquake centered
[41:46.860 --> 41:49.460]  thought that was the interesting coincidence you might want to go look
[41:49.460 --> 41:53.220]  her up it's type in type around she always wore necklaces she wore a
[41:53.220 --> 41:57.940]  bathroomette and a devil around her neck at all times we have that up on
[41:57.940 --> 42:02.180]  screen just side issue and yeah they did release in a fashion magazine last
[42:02.180 --> 42:07.700]  year and some Rothschild photos like eyes wide shut stuff but never mind all
[42:07.700 --> 42:13.620]  that you know Stanley Kerbert he was just a director even though we should
[42:13.620 --> 42:16.860]  talk to his daughter that won't talk to anybody else and she told me a lot of
[42:16.860 --> 42:20.260]  bit of stuff I don't know I'm always told this stuff I want to talk about it
[42:20.260 --> 42:26.780]  but anyways the point is is these are very nice people and there you go so
[42:26.780 --> 42:33.860]  put that in your pipe and smoke it make of all that what you will now we're
[42:33.860 --> 42:37.820]  gonna break and get back to the serious news when we come back here's the
[42:37.820 --> 42:43.420]  headline of the Washington Post was Putin right about Syria why Al Qaeda is
[42:43.420 --> 42:47.260]  taking over everywhere in Syria and everywhere else and we've got a bomb
[42:47.260 --> 42:51.700]  them wow was Putin right as the West tries to start a war with Russia that's

[45:24.340 --> 45:34.620]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones on
[45:34.620 --> 45:54.300]  the GCN radio network
[46:05.420 --> 46:13.300]  we didn't have time
[46:13.300 --> 46:18.300]  Or at the best place around
[46:18.300 --> 46:22.300]  The sun's stupid with a placard
[46:22.300 --> 46:26.300]  Turn the place to the ground
[46:26.300 --> 46:31.300]  A smoke on the water
[46:31.300 --> 46:34.300]  A fire in the sky
[46:34.300 --> 47:00.300]  A smoke on the water
[47:00.300 --> 47:04.300]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[47:04.300 --> 47:28.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[47:28.300 --> 47:38.300]  Radio, radio, radio, radio
[47:38.300 --> 47:46.300]  By the way, this evening we are dispatching reporters to California to cover the state of emergency that's been declared there.
[47:46.300 --> 47:57.300]  I'll be covering that live with our reporters on the ground tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central, with David Knight, Leanne McAdoo, Paul Watson and others reporting here on the transmission.
[47:57.300 --> 48:05.300]  Northern California, rocked by a magnitude 6.0 earthquake, widespread power outages have been reported.
[48:05.300 --> 48:10.300]  A piece of strong California quake causes injuries and damage.
[48:10.300 --> 48:21.300]  It's been 25 years since the federal government, or Northern California, was hit by an earthquake of this magnitude.
[48:21.300 --> 48:32.300]  The largest earthquake to hit the San Francisco Bay Area in 25 years since scores of people to hospitals ignited fires, damaged multiple historic buildings and knocked down power.
[48:32.300 --> 48:38.300]  The tens of thousands in California's wine country today.
[48:38.300 --> 48:46.300]  Injuries fires after 6.0 quake, rocks Napa, state of emergency declared, according to NBC Local.
[48:46.300 --> 48:55.300]  Pray for those out there in California. 6.1 now they've upgraded it from 6.0, kind of like what happened in Japan with Fukushima kept getting upgraded.
[48:55.300 --> 49:01.300]  Magnitude quake center in Napa felt throughout Northern California.
[49:01.300 --> 49:07.300]  So that is some of the news on that front.
[49:07.300 --> 49:11.300]  And we see hurricanes and earthquakes and things like that.
[49:11.300 --> 49:22.300]  But hey, no one can ever keep you perfectly safe. And when government acts like it's their job and that they're there to quote, keep you safe, even though they take your freedom, that's a lie.
[49:22.300 --> 49:25.300]  Government is there to protect your freedom, not your life.
[49:25.300 --> 49:30.300]  And government has no responsibility historically and cannot protect you.
[49:30.300 --> 49:32.300]  That's why we have a second amendment.
[49:32.300 --> 49:38.300]  They've gotten rid of the right to keep their arms in almost every country in the world, except for Switzerland and the United States.
[49:38.300 --> 49:44.300]  Very limited rights in places like Australia. We need to reverse that. Just throwing that in.
[49:44.300 --> 49:51.300]  I mean, I hear talk radio and see Fox News and CNN and oh my gosh, ISIS is so scary.
[49:51.300 --> 49:54.300]  Oh my gosh, I'm so scared they're going to get us.
[49:54.300 --> 50:00.300]  When I was watching a vice report online of the al-Qaeda leaders, that's what it is. They're al-Qaeda, they have al-Qaeda flags.
[50:00.300 --> 50:05.300]  They're like, I will kill all the Americans. No one can stop me. I am invincible.
[50:05.300 --> 50:16.300]  We took over Rome and sacked Rome in 410 and the Visigoths led by Alaric in 410 sacked Rome.
[50:16.300 --> 50:24.300]  Islam didn't exist in 410. I mean, these people are just literally whacked out nutballs.
[50:24.300 --> 50:32.300]  But who else do you think responds to this propaganda to go join a radical force who's protected and given weapons by NATO?
[50:32.300 --> 50:39.300]  And then later NATO will go and kill them, letting the main forces escape always.
[50:39.300 --> 50:43.300]  So again, it's not like they're like, hey, we're friends playing cards together.
[50:43.300 --> 50:46.300]  No, our troops will die fighting them and they will die fighting them.
[50:46.300 --> 50:50.300]  They're running around, chopping heads off and the rest of it. It's just amazing.
[50:50.300 --> 51:01.300]  Saudi Arabia publicly is funding them while being on the news today saying they're having a summit on how to end the crisis.
[51:01.300 --> 51:10.300]  Again, if you don't know what a Shiite in a Sunni is, you better learn or don't watch mainstream news and let them lie to you.
[51:10.300 --> 51:13.300]  God bless him, George W. Bush.
[51:13.300 --> 51:18.300]  A year before he left office was in a press conference with Muhammad Karzai at the Rose Garden.
[51:18.300 --> 51:26.300]  And he said, Iran runs al-Qaeda and we've been fighting them in Afghanistan. Isn't that right, Muhammad Karzai?
[51:26.300 --> 51:35.300]  And Karzai said, Your Excellency, I apologize, we played the clip here, but Iran is Shiite, al-Qaeda is Sunni based,
[51:35.300 --> 51:43.300]  and Iran is actually helping us fight the Sunni. And Bush said, No, it is you that is incorrect.
[51:43.300 --> 51:47.300]  You can find that clip. I mean, Bush knew what was going on.
[51:47.300 --> 51:52.300]  It's part of manipulating the American people. And I'm not saying Iran's good either.
[51:52.300 --> 52:00.300]  Some people now send me emails or I see them on the street, they go, Yeah, Alex, I know the plan is to get the Arabs all kill each other. So what?
[52:00.300 --> 52:09.300]  Oh, it's just Arabs, they're Muslims all over the world. They're the biggest Muslim countries are in Asia, Indonesia, places like that.
[52:09.300 --> 52:14.300]  And a lot of them are not that radical, folks, and we don't want to have a clash of civilizations.
[52:14.300 --> 52:22.300]  While the government imports as many as they can, but then it's politically correct and says don't criticize even radical Islam, you get arrested for that in England.
[52:22.300 --> 52:27.300]  See, because they're just getting us all squared off like two chickens in a cock fight, two roosters to kill each other.
[52:27.300 --> 52:34.300]  I don't want to play the game. I understand the game. I understand the scam. It's very elementary.
[52:34.300 --> 52:41.300]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers and others for hundreds of years would finance both sides of a war.
[52:41.300 --> 52:47.300]  They would sell weapons to both sides. That's what the New World Order does.
[52:47.300 --> 52:53.300]  And all you good old boys that go, well, good, let them have the Arabs kill each other. You know, they won't come over here and get us.
[52:53.300 --> 53:04.300]  They're overthrowing countries that are working with the West like Egypt to give the jihadis a base to menace us so our freedoms can be taken.
[53:04.300 --> 53:18.300]  And by the way, remember over 90% of Homeland Security funding and training. This has been in the news and Janet Napolitano and J. Johnson or whatever his name is, the new head of it.
[53:18.300 --> 53:31.300]  They have all come out and said the vast majority of preparation is for who veterans, returning veterans, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, constitutionalist libertarians,
[53:31.300 --> 53:38.300]  basically anybody that works hard and knows what America is all about and cares about basic freedom and the Second Amendment and private property and family.
[53:38.300 --> 53:43.300]  If you're a good person, the people taking over hate your guts because you're not going to like the new tyranny.
[53:43.300 --> 53:50.300]  They know you're the enemy. They're going to be fighting because they're going to make it so bad. The Pentagon says this.
[53:50.300 --> 53:55.300]  They will fight the Tea Party. They will have a war, not our average troops.
[53:55.300 --> 54:03.300]  But the people running our Pentagon, pull it up, do nothing but prepare to crush state legislatures, to arrest governors.
[54:03.300 --> 54:09.300]  Read the John Warren Defense Authorization Act 2007, expanded by Obama in 2010.
[54:09.300 --> 54:16.300]  It talks about taking over legislatures when states are in insurrection, not just people.
[54:16.300 --> 54:27.300]  See, they've pushed and pushed and pushed. They're going to push until we can't be pushing any further. And they plan to have a so disarmed, so balkanized, so dumbed down, so fighting with each other,
[54:27.300 --> 54:35.300]  with the borders wide open, with a dollar worthless, where the nuke goes off in a major city, blamed on ISIS, might be next week, might be three years from now.
[54:35.300 --> 54:42.300]  We know their game plan so they can go on the news and pose as saviors. We're going to fix it. We're going to take care of the race war.
[54:42.300 --> 54:48.300]  We're going to take care of the ISIS attack. We're going to arrest the black leaders. We're going to arrest the Tea Party leaders.
[54:48.300 --> 54:56.300]  We're going to go after the Mecha leaders and the Tea Party leaders. We're going to stabilize America. It's the National Stabilization Force.
[54:56.300 --> 55:05.300]  Just like the West has to invade Syria and Iraq right now, because ISIS, ISIS, al-Qaeda and Iraq was its former name.
[55:05.300 --> 55:12.300]  It's running around murdering tens of thousands a month. It's killed 300 plus thousand in Syria. And look at them sawing people's heads off.
[55:12.300 --> 55:22.300]  Why, we've just got to do something right now. Why, there's crack cocaine and heroin all over our streets being flown in on C-130s and landed at U.S. military bases.
[55:22.300 --> 55:35.300]  It came out in 1972 in Congress in the church hearings and 1974 and 5 came out in 1997 of the CIA and Specter General Report. I watched it on C-SPAN.
[55:35.300 --> 55:43.300]  Now, almost all the cocaine was shipped in by our government. And then Jeepers, creepers, you got a bunch of coked up nutballs running around.
[55:43.300 --> 55:58.300]  Daughters going to be a whore to pay for the cocaine or the smack. And why, we got checkpoints everywhere to stop them drugs and stop that al-Qaeda and stop them illegals and stop everything else they brought in and they created.
[55:58.300 --> 56:08.300]  A little secret of criminology is actually well known. You know who the first people they look at in a big fire, a big arson, especially of a government building.
[56:08.300 --> 56:17.300]  You know who they look at first, they look at who called it in first. Because criminals like to then get the thrill of sitting there talking to the police and the firemen.
[56:17.300 --> 56:34.300]  And then secondarily, they look at the firemen. I use an politically incorrect term, just not to bash women, but just to show that I still have free speech. Firemen, firemen are the number two suspect in any arson.
[56:34.300 --> 56:41.300]  You know who the number one suspect was for blowing up the Capitol building to declare martial law in Germany? Oh, it was the Nazi party and they did it, that's declassified.
[56:41.300 --> 56:47.300]  Oh, how'd they start World War II with Poland? They blew up their own military bases operation in there.
[56:47.300 --> 57:06.300]  See, I'm telling you how the world works here. Game over if you just listen. Game over if you discovered it. Game over for the globalist. But if you don't figure it out, they're going to take your pension funds, they're going to take your freedom, they're going to take your health, they're going to socially engineer you seven ways to Sunday.
[57:06.300 --> 57:17.300]  I haven't even gotten into it yet, though. Here's the headlines. Now they're spinning it. Oh, we've got to intervene with Syria to take out Al Qaeda. Was Putin right about Syria saying Al Qaeda's evil?
[57:17.300 --> 57:27.300]  U.S. strikes in Syria against Islamic State would be hindered by intelligence gaps. Oh, we need more troops there. That would fix it. Then of course they'll attack Assad and claim he was involved with them.
[57:27.300 --> 57:39.300]  They're set to launch airstrikes on senior ISIS leaders in Syria. Why? Why the very same group they opened the door for and armed? Full spectrum dominance. Create the crisis worldwide. Burn down the planet.
[57:39.300 --> 57:50.300]  And then offer your planetary regime, your anti-Christ, as the answer. And the state-run churches will all hail him and fall to their knees.
[57:50.300 --> 58:01.300]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify. Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[58:01.300 --> 58:14.300]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[58:14.300 --> 58:25.300]  Then about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals. And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[58:25.300 --> 58:39.300]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating. And the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[58:39.300 --> 58:49.300]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2. Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at infowarslife.com.
[58:49.300 --> 58:59.300]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day. But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[58:59.300 --> 59:09.300]  The indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air. And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[59:09.300 --> 59:21.300]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions. And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[59:21.300 --> 59:31.300]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[59:31.300 --> 59:42.300]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A. The new infowars life lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[59:42.300 --> 59:51.300]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[59:51.300 --> 01:00:00.300]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:15.300]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:31.300]  Even if you don't believe in the antichrist world government God the devil. It is a union archetype that is real whether it's not real or not.
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:46.300]  You understand that? If groups of humans and organizations take on things that could only be described as purely satanic, purely destructive they exist. They are manifest.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:01:02.300]  So the debate all ends and the globalist believers setting up a ten kingdom. That's what the UN and UNESCO calls it. Club of Rome. Planetary world government with a world religion the whole nine yards.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:29.300]  It's really a counterfeit new age. See every major symbol, the new age, the all seeing eye, everything has been the swastika. It's all been expropriated. All these archetypal important symbols that just belong to the universe that belong to God's creation that are there and true and resonate with us have been taken by the enemy and made their symbols.
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:40.300]  I want to get two esoteric or sophisticated here, not that folks out there are smarter than I in many cases. It's just that we're entering a great time of crisis.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:53.300]  The world is blowing up as Defense Secretary Hagel said two weeks ago. Now a month ago Obama's Press Secretary came out and proclaimed the age of tranquility thanks to Barack H. Obama. I mean I'm not kidding, pull that up.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:02:10.300]  I just can't make this stuff up. The world is beginning to be set on fire. I'm saying it was an arsonist. I'm telling you where it's coming from. Now you can go check out when I'm claiming and find out it's true or you can just sit there and say all conspiracy theorist as the cop out to ignore reality.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:25.300]  And it doesn't mean that I don't see through a rose color darkly to quote the Bible. All of us are distorted. It's part of our beauty. It's a Japanese term for things that are so incredibly beautiful that have some flaw that makes it even more beautiful.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:47.300]  The older I get the more I realize what great wisdom that is. So we'll give the phone number out when we come back and I've got some other news I want to hit about Islamic State, about Obama golfing on CIA runs, ISIS plans, U.S. Strike, the latest on Ferguson, the latest on the economy, the latest on politics.
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:03:03.300]  We've got some clips here, Democratic politician says, grant illegals and the Steve, let's just cue that up now. Or they'll become terrorists. And don't cut the NSA's funding or terrorists will blow you up or let us have your guns or terrorists will blow you up.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:12.300]  Or let us have your guns and accept Obamacare will call you racist. We'll engage in terrorism. We'll terrorize you. That's the definition of terrorism.
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:25.300]  Just thought the whole world's collapsing. We're totally bankrupt. Oh, let's just have 30 million more illegals here. And then I was reading where it's bankrupting schools across the country where they're going basically Spanish only Spanish immersion.
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:36.300]  I'm not against Spanish, but it's not the global language. And if you don't teach these kids English, they will be a permanent political block under the control of the Ford Foundation.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:55.300]  The Ford Foundation, LFA Spanish speakers, which is the whole point. English is a Mongol language. I don't mean actual Mongols like the Huns. It is not a real language in the classic original thing like Latin or Chinese.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:07.300]  It is Germanic languages. It is a mix of Latin and Germanic languages going back a thousand years ago. And now every other language it attaches, it grows. It is the global language. It is officially the world language.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:18.300]  If humans don't get replaced with machines, then we launch space bases in the future. If we're still using words and things are still written, baby, it's going to be in English. You disadvantage these children.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:27.300]  No, no. Now the English language itself is racist. No. The politicians don't want you being able to communicate with people.
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:36.300]  I'm all for learning Spanish, by the way. I'm all for learning. That's the language we live in the United States. You should learn. The first one you should learn. You're going to disadvantage not knowing Spanish.
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:54.300]  And you're a disadvantage not knowing English, no matter where you are in the world. Number one thing you can do for your child if you want them to get ahead in the world is not just me, all the top educators. Get them to learn to speak English and get them to learn how to dress nice, shake hands, have a spark on their eye and be honorable.
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:59.300]  Because in business, people are looking for folks that don't stab them in the back. We'll be back.
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:08.300]  Another major health threat. This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water. Ohio Governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:18.300]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day? If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:21.300]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:31.300]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was. To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:38.300]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store. There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.300]  To the Cues!
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.300]  One more voice on the Cues!
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.300]  Pro on Cues for you!
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:17.300]  K.F. Quinn.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.300]  Los Angeles.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:23.300]  Clone radio. We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:24.300]  Clone.
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:32.300]  Hitler took the guns. Stalin took the guns. Mal took the guns. Fidel Castro took the guns. Dominique.
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:45.300]  No Chavez took the guns. 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms. The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:56.300]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, internal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:06.300]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:21.300]  I want to get your take on the earthquake. I want to get your take on ISIS. I want to get your take on everything we've been breaking down so far.
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:31.300]  Coming up in the final segment tonight, I'll break down the literal mind control that is gangster, hip hop, cop killer, thug rap.
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:40.300]  With Shug Knight being shot, the wages of sin are death. Those that live by the sword die by the sword.
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:53.300]  That is coming up in the final segment today. The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539. We're live on this Sunday broadcast, 24th of August.
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:08:06.300]  Again, that number, 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539. Different number than the weekday show. It's 12.00 to 3.00 p.m. Eastern.
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:18.300]  That's all run by the network and they pipe the calls through here because that goes back to 1997 when I would broadcast from home in my little studio and they would feed me the calls like every day was a remote.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:24.300]  We still do it that way. But on the Sunday, it's all produced right here in-house.
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:33.300]  Okay, where to start in this segment? I want to get the news I haven't covered yet. Then take your calls coming up in the next few segments after that.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:39.300]  I already mentioned this, but let me just go over the headlines themselves unless you doubt me.
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:54.300]  Last year, John Kerry and we should tomorrow on the show dig up those clips. We could even probably do it today of Kerry saying we must attack Syria right now or Assad will nerve gas America.
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:09:03.300]  There's like blaming Saddam for 9-11. You can say what you want about Saddam Hussein. It has nothing to do with Saudi Arabia. It's where the people came from on record.
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:18.300]  It's Saudi Arabia behind ISIS and IS and al-Qaeda right now. Our big precious, dardling, sweetsy-cake ally who literally greets half of Congress and most of the state governors as well and legislatures.
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:24.300]  And so they're running around all over Syria murdering people. They're the main force to start the civil war almost four years ago.
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:33.300]  Our government gives them all these weapons. It becomes a big scandal because our own military and our own CIA, military is usually pretty moral because they're compartmentalized.
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:41.300]  The CIA and others, there was even bulking there and the Joint Chiefs in openly joining with al-Qaeda, openly turning Syria over.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:48.300]  And the issue was the military knew they couldn't get away with it. We covered all that at the time last year.
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:53.300]  Rand Paul and others came out and talked about we shouldn't be al-Qaeda's air force.
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:10:05.300]  So IS then went into Iraq and has taken about a third of the country. They've got a deal to split the country in three parts with Saudi Arabia, the Kurds, and of course Iran.
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:12.300]  But ISIS is going for broke. They're now double-crossing that deal. Saudi Arabia's double-crossing that deal.
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:17.300]  They're very mad that a deal's been made behind the scenes with Iran to de-escalate things.
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:24.300]  And Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. Don't believe me. I'm not even a big critic of Israel. I'm not against Israel.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:30.300]  I get criticized for not being anti-Israel. But it was in the Jerusalem Post Netanyahu who said ISIS might be good.
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:36.300]  A good thing for the Middle East. Yeah, they stabilize. All the Arabs kill each other. Notice ISIS doesn't say they're going to attack Israel.
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:43.300]  Of course they will someday. This is so sick. This is so evil. Just like our country's working with al-Qaeda.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:50.300]  It's not the American people that are doing it. It's not the Israeli people that are doing it. It's the sick leadership we have.
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:58.300]  And the decision that was made above our government and above Israel's government, up there in the military industrial complex and the big banking combine,
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:02.300]  that this destabilization is what they want to bring in their world government.
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:08.300]  Well, if you go back to last year and they've got the quotes here in the Washington Post, everybody remembers that Putin said,
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:13.300]  you are turning Syria over to people that will chop off.
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:20.300]  In fact, the headline was, Putin says, don't turn Syria over to people that are animals.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:25.300]  Don't turn Syria over to Satanists who eat hearts. Type in Vladimir Putin.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:31.300]  Don't turn Syria over to people that are cannibals. That was the actual headline, but then he said all that in his speech.
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:40.300]  Putin, don't hand Syria over to monsters that are cannibals was the exact quote.
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:47.300]  And that'll give us the exact date. But here it is in the Washington Post. They don't give him that much credit. Just my memory does.
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:52.300]  Was Putin right about Syria? And they go on to ask the question, oh my gosh.
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:57.300]  The establishment is scared now because they don't control the media anymore. They thought they did.
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:03.300]  They just ignore the real media. DrudgeReport.com and FullWars.com, WorldNet Daily, stuff like that.
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:10.300]  They ignore that. And so the whole world learned that our government's funding Al Qaeda.
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:16.300]  The whole world learned about what was really going on and what was really happening.
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:26.300]  And so now the world knows our government's funding Al Qaeda in Libya, in Jordan, in Egypt.
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:31.300]  And it's causing major, major, major problems for the establishment.
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:34.300]  So they're bombing a few artillery pieces and a few Toyota trucks with nobody in them.
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:38.300]  They're acting like they're fighting them. They're acting like they want to send troops there to go after them.
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:41.300]  And they'll go after some little faction group of it or whatever.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:46.300]  And now ISIS is so out of control. They're not following orders. So maybe ISIS has to be dealt with.
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:49.300]  See, that's what's so wrong with this Machiavellian view.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:54.300]  When everybody starts stabbing everybody in the back, when everybody starts cheating each other,
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:58.300]  then there's no stability even for corrupt elites.
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:04.300]  There's a reason smart elites that are even evil like to not double deal and like stability.
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:07.300]  It's because they want to survive. They want to be smart.
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:11.300]  They want to cut the cream off the top of a successful society.
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:15.300]  They don't want to be a third world imploded pit.
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:20.300]  But the globalists politically so want to dominate moral Western culture
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:29.300]  and they want to extinguish it because chivalry and free market is such a threat to their monopoly fascist system
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:37.300]  and they want to extinguish it forever and believe they'll then bring some golden age utopia in later.
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:41.300]  That's what the Rand Corporation, all of them say. That's not going to happen.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:47.300]  You turn loose these forces that you are messing with, these titans.
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:55.300]  You will destroy the planet. You can't use some Rothschild model from the Napoleonic Wars
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:14:01.300]  financing all three sides and then both sides when it went from three to two.
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:06.300]  You will not get rich and powerful out of this. You will not control everything.
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:10.300]  So the Rothschild, you've got some weird score to settle with the West
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.300]  because you don't feel like you were accepted 300 years ago and all this other craziness.
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:16.300]  You're going to blow the planet up you lunatics.
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:20.300]  And I know you're probably not going to listen to me as globalist.
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:23.300]  The Queen of England, the Dutch royalty, all of you.
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:29.300]  You're going to embread nuts, but your minions and the military and the joint chiefs and other,
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:34.300]  and Interpol, Interpol's head came out and said arm the general public in Europe
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:37.300]  to stop radical Muslim attacks a few months ago.
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:41.300]  I'm seeing signs everywhere throughout the power structure that people don't want to ruin
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:44.300]  and wreck society and drive it off a cliff.
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:46.300]  Most people serving the system aren't even evil.
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:50.300]  They were compartmentalized and lazy and just want to get along.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:57.300]  They realize the New World Order is not going to let them get along.
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:00.300]  The New World Order is going to bring in tyranny.
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.300]  So here's some of the headlines and during the break I'm going to pull up that headline
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:05.300]  because I really want it.
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:10.300]  Putin says that the Al Qaeda rebels are cannibals.
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:14.300]  I want to give you the date when he said all that, but here is the Washington Post
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:18.300]  going over all of that, saying was Putin right
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.300]  and the U.S. set to launch airstrikes.
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.300]  See, they couldn't get airstrikes before with Congress.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.300]  It's a back Al Qaeda.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:27.300]  So now they need airstrikes in Syria to stop Al Qaeda.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:30.300]  And of course they'll probably bomb Assad forces.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:33.300]  Last week they were saying Assad may be behind it.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:37.300]  We need to bomb him and then let the good rebels take over and then that will stop Al Qaeda.
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.300]  There it is.
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.300]  Why arm cannibal rebels in Syria?
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:47.300]  Putin asked Sydney Morning Herald, June 17, 2013, almost a year ago.
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.300]  We'll be back. Stay with us.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:51.300]  I'm going to take your phone calls.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:16:20.300]  Then I'm going to get into a bunch of other important news on Ferguson, Libya, and more.

[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.300]  else what happened?
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:39.300]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.300]  Talk about the effects.
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:42.300]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.300]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.300]  I feel like I look better.
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.300]  I feel better.
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:47.300]  I feel sexier.
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.300]  I love it.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.300]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:59.300]  This is life changing.
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:06.300]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:08.300]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:14.300]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:19.300]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:22.300]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:26.300]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:31.300]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:41.300]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:45.300]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:52.300]  The new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:05.300]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:10.300]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:15.300]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.300]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:23.300]  You now know it as survival shield true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:31.300]  Then about a year ago he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth and deep earth crystals.
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:35.300]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:40.300]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:49.300]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.

[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:17.300]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:20.300]  Prime Directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.300]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.300]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called info wars.
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.300]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.300]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.300]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.300]  They are never going to stop.
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:39.300]  They are never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:54.300]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:20:01.300]  Electrally, it's for God you can fail it.
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:04.300]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:08.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.300]  Network.
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:22.300]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.300]  in the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:28.300]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:35.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.300]  Alright, let's do this.
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:42.300]  I'm not going to jump into what's coming up because I'll never get to your calls.
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.300]  But I was speaking about Al Qaeda being turned loose.
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:47.300]  Remember we overthrew Libya.
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:50.300]  It was pro-west now working with the world.
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:54.300]  Now Al Qaeda, Bloomberg reports, is taking over the airport and the main government.
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:57.300]  Shut the takeover of the parliament, it'll be full Al Qaeda.
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:00.300]  Everyone is not a radical, we'll have their heads chopped off.
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:04.300]  And every major analyst admits, such a mistake going to Libya.
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:06.300]  Oh, it's a horrible thing.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:08.300]  The plan was to destabilize.
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.300]  The plan was to make it a failed state.
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:13.300]  As they're now saying, it's becoming.
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:16.300]  And you know we're not just here to bash the police on this show.
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:19.300]  Because if we do that, it plays into the globalist mindset.
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:21.300]  And then it's an us against them situation.
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:23.300]  And then they just basically join the globalist.
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:26.300]  But I've seen cases, we're going to show this coming up,
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:30.300]  where you yell at a police dog, you get multiple years in jail.
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:33.300]  Well,
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:39.300]  Wyoming cop charged with animal cruelty is $750 fine
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:43.300]  after death of Canaan dog left for five hours in the hot squad car.
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:46.300]  Nick's the dog died, but it's always just a PR thing,
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.300]  where some bad guy will kick a police dog,
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:50.300]  they'll give him 10 years in prison.
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:55.300]  It's just meant to say cops are God, dogs are people, citizens are trash.
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:22:00.300]  Of course, cops aren't important to the system, unless they're fronting for it.
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:05.300]  Look at this man charged with assault for yelling at police dog,
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:07.300]  reason.com.
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:10.300]  So yell at him, you go to jail.
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:16.300]  10 years in prison for a Canaan cop, unless you're a cop,
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.300]  then it's $750.
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:21.300]  Again, that's the essence of the animal farm tyranny,
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:25.300]  is when people in government aren't held the same standards.
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:30.300]  Different rules for different folks.
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:33.300]  Everybody knows the dice is loaded.
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:36.300]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:41.300]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:43.300]  Chris, thanks for calling, you're on the air.
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:44.300]  Go ahead.
[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:45.300]  Alex, how are you doing?
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:46.300]  Good, go ahead.
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:49.300]  I'll tell you what, you're absolutely right about all this.
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:53.300]  Ferguson did this, this control of everything is going on out here.
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:56.300]  The mind said, when are people going to start manning up out here
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:58.300]  and get real and start getting information?
[01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:03.300]  This, we had back in March of 2014, this specimen here in Louisville.
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.300]  You know what happened?
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.300]  You know, these people out here, these teenagers act up,
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.300]  oh, they're going to ride the streets,
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.300]  they're tearing up the convenience stores.
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:13.300]  We had that in March of 2000, guess what?
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:15.300]  Mayor Fisher in Louisville, Kentucky,
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:17.300]  I'm going to say your name, buddy.
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:21.300]  You got federal ID cams with your digital information
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.300]  about you that everybody's terrorist.
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:28.300]  I am sick and tired of this country going to drain.
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:29.300]  I'm sick of it, Alex.
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:31.300]  And these people are getting to be zombies out here.
[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:32.300]  I'm so angry.
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:34.300]  I'm sorry.
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.300]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:37.300]  It's good to hear from you.
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:38.300]  It is bad.
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:42.300]  The borders are wide open while the NSA watches everything we do illegally.
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:45.300]  The TSA came out in public documents last week confirming
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:49.300]  that they let illegals fly without IDs.
[01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:51.300]  You can come in or leave the country.
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:54.300]  Oh, you're an illegal, you're Hispanic, you're above the law.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:56.300]  Oh, we're going to make the schools go Spanish only now.
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:24:01.300]  Oh, red carpet, everything's free.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.300]  Again, to drive down the wages.
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:05.300]  And then to make it if you're against open borders
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:08.300]  while you're against Hispanics.
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.300]  Well, I can't go to Mexico and get everything free.
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.300]  And I know a lot of the illegals are working very hard as well.
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:15.300]  The point is our wages are going down.
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.300]  The country's collapsing.
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.300]  Latin America is collapsing.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:20.300]  We can't take all these people.
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:22.300]  And then all these different racial groups
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:25.300]  are just played off against each other.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:27.300]  Let's go back to the phone calls here.
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:30.300]  Rob, Rob is calling from FEMA Region 10.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:32.300]  I guess that's the West Coast somewhere.
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:34.300]  In Oregon or Washington or Idaho,
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:38.300]  what former state under FEMA are you calling us from?
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:40.300]  Former state of Oregon, Alex.
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.300]  Always a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:47.300]  It's a point to the last caller, the zombies out there.
[01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:50.300]  And it's fantasy football time.
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:53.300]  And all the men, like you said, are sitting around tables.
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:55.300]  And here's a good analogy for them.
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:00.300]  Last year, when the Broncos banged around the table,
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:04.300]  almost one level deal fell apart in the Super Bowl.
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:06.300]  And everyone's crushed.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.300]  Two weeks, they're devastated.
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:13.300]  What if you found out that Peyton Manning actually played on the other team?
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:16.300]  And that's the analogy of what's going on here in the U.S.
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.300]  Yes.
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:20.300]  The sports and all of it is deployed
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.300]  where you've got the owners,
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:24.300]  and you've got the generals out of the coaches,
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:29.300]  and it's all tribal garbage designed to manipulate people.
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.300]  And it's worked great.
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:32.300]  The average man is not a man.
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:36.300]  All they care about is the fantasy world of sports,
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:39.300]  while the globalists literally take the world away from them.
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:45.300]  That's how the men of the West had their wave-os chopped off.
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:47.300]  And I'm telling you, the average American, if you told them,
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:50.300]  you can't watch football unless you go in and have surgery
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:52.300]  and have your testicles cut off.
[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:53.300]  I'm not joking.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.300]  They would go and have them chopped off
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.300]  because they don't care about their wives, their kids, nothing.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:03.300]  They care about the fantasy of watching men on TV
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.300]  in simulated combat.
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.300]  But they don't count.
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:09.300]  The globalists did all that to make them spectators
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:11.300]  and not exist and be nobodies.
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:13.300]  Just ignore them, let them giggle at us
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:15.300]  and wear their sports jerseys.
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:18.300]  We need to move on to find real men that care.
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:21.300]  There's a lot more of us than there are on the globalist side.
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:24.300]  And again, I'm not putting you down if you have a sports cap or a jersey.
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:26.300]  If it's your God, if you worship it,
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:30.300]  if it's all you care about, if you're not involved in other issues,
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.300]  it's just pathetic.
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:35.300]  It's like people that are into hip-hop gangster rap.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.300]  I mean, literally deployed by the psych warfare generals.
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:41.300]  You are chumps, you are fools, you are idiots.
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:44.300]  Anything else, Rob?
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:49.300]  Yeah, the analogy can be used to maybe wake up that side of it.
[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:53.300]  And that's the one thing that might get them emotionally involved in this.
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:57.300]  Like, imagine how you felt there, this is real life.
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:58.300]  Well, there is hope.
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:03.300]  There is hope because Helen Keller couldn't speak or hear.
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:09.300]  And she could be taught to write very interesting books.
[01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:11.300]  But they've got to want to come out of the trance.
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:14.300]  They've got to want to come out of it.
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:17.300]  And a lot of them never will.
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:19.300]  No matter when things collapse, they won't care.
[01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:22.300]  They'll serve the other side. It's what they do.
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:25.300]  Sharon in Texas, go ahead. Thanks for holding.
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:26.300]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:36.300]  Listen, it's been said that totalitarianism expresses itself anonymously through the corporate state.
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:41.300]  But I can think of a couple other incidences where it expresses itself.
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:49.300]  And one of them is that police, this militia-like method of operation where they have to take away the documentation or not allow it.
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:52.300]  I know there was a little gal on 24-action news that said,
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:56.300]  she had a ponytail, pom-pom ponytail.
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:59.300]  And she said, you know, I had a picture.
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:02.300]  I was videotaping.
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:06.300]  Michael Brown and his friend walking across the street with a police car drove up.
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:08.300]  And they took away my camera.
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:10.300]  They took away my cell phone, rather.
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:14.300]  And I felt just a sinking feeling inside.
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:17.300]  That's the damage control.
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:20.300]  Sure, sure. And again, the local cops don't know it,
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:24.300]  that it was allowed to go as bad as possible to beta test martial law,
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:27.300]  even though all this footage showed the cop told the truth.
[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:29.300]  The evidence is leaning that direction big time.
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:32.300]  They didn't release any of it, because the feds told them not to.
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:36.300]  And the feds gave them the tanks and the armored vehicles and the training.
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:41.300]  And then Obama comes and says, I'm going to investigate militarization of police.
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:45.300]  That's like Al Capone saying, I'm going to investigate the Chicago mafia.
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:49.300]  Or Hitler saying, he's going to investigate the Nazi party.
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:52.300]  So yes, they attacked our reporters.
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:54.300]  They attacked other reporters.
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.300]  It was a horrible display.
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:29:19.300]  We're all contrived by the globalist.
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:32.300]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:36.300]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:39.300]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:43.300]  The Pro Pure Pro One G2.0 water filtration system is a must have

[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:31.300]  If you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:35.300]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.

[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:46.300]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show,
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:49.300]  the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:53.300]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.

[01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:03.300]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:05.300]  about a potential for hood situation?
[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:09.300]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:10.300]  Here we go, folks. I'm being a sergeant.
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:14.300]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news,
[01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:17.300]  info wars is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:21.300]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeland security
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.300]  on the streets?
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:27.300]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:30.300]  and that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:36.300]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.300]  against the so-called rebels.
[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:42.300]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:47.300]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv
[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:51.300]  and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:59.300]  Become a member, share your membership and help take the info war to the next level.
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:03.300]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:07.300]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:09.300]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:14.300]  Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:18.300]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal, but for how long?
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:24.300]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor.com.
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:46.300]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:59.300]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Gene Company.
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:27.300]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:32.300]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:34.300]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.300]  Alright, let's race through your calls right now.
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:46.300]  Andrew in Pennsylvania, you're on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:49.300]  Yeah, Val Snowden in the NSA.
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:54.300]  First of all, with all due respect to Dr. Steve Pagenik, Snowden is not a double-agent voice analyst.
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:57.300]  Sherry Edwards, who can analyze voices just like you can analyze body language,
[01:33:57.300 --> 01:34:01.300]  has made it clear that Snowden in his voice is honest and cares about humanity,
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.300]  and in regards to his always-
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:06.300]  Sure, you know even responding to that only puts it back out there.
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:13.300]  Look, regardless, all the NSA stuff's pretty much already come out before through a whole bunch of other whistleblowers.
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:20.300]  So, the point is they are illegally spying on us. That's the issue, not who Snowden really is.
[01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:24.300]  Right, right, and in regards to that revelation he said is coming,
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:29.300]  is it possible, as a contractor, you wonder, does he have info about how the NSA,
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:35.300]  as Alfred Weber of ExoPoliticsTV talked about, has the ability to track and monitor your bodily light emissions
[01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:37.300]  that you can't normally see?
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:40.300]  Sure, that was patented 20 years ago and it's hooked into the satellites now.
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:45.300]  Off of your heat residence, off the top of your head and shoulders,
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:49.300]  they have a biometric print tracking you in real time, face scanning cameras.
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:54.300]  Most of the spying is done by the 860 something thousand private contractors
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:58.300]  that use the data in economic espionage destroying the free market.
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:03.300]  But the larger revelation is going to be blackmail of Congress.
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:06.300]  That's already come out with MI6, blackmailing parliament.
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:11.300]  It's blackmail and that a large members of Congress are pedophiles.
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:16.300]  That's come out in England as well and that they're using the pedophile data to control them.
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:21.300]  Yeah, that's right, and is it possible that contractors Snowden, as some whistleblowers have said,
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:26.300]  but he can't really be proven that the NSA has collaborated with NASA to use spacecraft
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.300]  and bases on the moon, among other things?
[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:32.300]  Well, I know this. They're about 30 years advanced, what they say.
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:36.300]  I've known quite a few NASA engineers and astronauts we've interviewed,
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:40.300]  Buzz Aldrin and others, and I've had private conversations with Buzz Aldrin a couple of times.
[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:45.300]  But I knew Raymond Teague who died last year, God rest his soul earlier this year, good friend of mine.
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:50.300]  He's famously in the film Mission Control Frontline, controlling the cameras on the moon.
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:56.300]  He controlled the cameras on Skylab and the special after that, and he said no, they were on the moon.
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:58.300]  But he couldn't talk about the other classified stuff.
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:01.300]  He just said there's a lot of stuff the public wasn't allowed to see.
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:07.300]  And that's why you saw fake photos and stuff, just like you Photoshopped something for your business to make it look better.
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:10.300]  They couldn't get the photos back because of radiation.
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:14.300]  Digital cameras hadn't been invented yet, so they dolled up some photos.
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.300]  That's where all the conspiracies come from.
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:20.300]  I appreciate your call. Let's go ahead and talk to Julio in Wyoming.
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:22.300]  Julio, you're on the air.
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:28.300]  Hello, Alex. Total life change from Chicago to Wyoming.
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:33.300]  It's so beautiful seeing people with open carry and actually caring about their freedoms out here.
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:35.300]  It's beautiful.
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:41.300]  That's right. For all the negative things that are happening, there's an opposite and equal reaction under Newtonian physics.
[01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:47.300]  There is a giant awakening happening, but it's a race for the finish line. We're in the fight.
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:52.300]  We have to decide, though, is the Empire on the march or are we on the march?
[01:36:52.300 --> 01:37:00.300]  100%. And watching CBS Chicago draw the link to this about ISIS attacking Chicago.
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:04.300]  Mark my words, Alex. It's going to be similar to 9-11.
[01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:13.300]  I'm reading documents from Homeland Security and the FBI talking about domestic extremists going to attack government buildings
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:19.300]  or domestic extremists in San Antonio are going to attack emergency officials.
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:23.300]  I'm going to tell you this, Alex. I have a feeling it's when an attack happens.
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:31.300]  Not if, but when it's going to be ISIS with domestic extremists going after the evil US government.
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:34.300]  Oh, yeah. I mean, you're absolutely right.
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:41.300]  They said two years ago, Army War College stuff came out claiming – this was in mainstream news –
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:45.300]  that Tea Party – I mean, I made a big deal about it at the time. It was so ridiculous.
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:50.300]  I probably talked about it a hundred times. That's where I came up with the saying,
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:56.300]  it's like Superman joining the Legion of Doom. The Tea Party is the most Islamophobic group out there.
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:38:01.300]  God bless them. I'm not an Islamophobic, but I am radical Islamophobic.
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:07.300]  I am globalistphobic. I am tyrannyphobic. I am chop women and children's heads off phobic.
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:14.300]  I am anybody in black uniforms torturing people phobic, whether it be the CIA or the ISIS scum.
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:21.300]  And yes, they conflate and they mix together. ISIS is going to hit Chicago and going to hit police
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:27.300]  and firemen and firefighters any minute and domestic extremists.
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:32.300]  So they wedged that in and getting it ready. And absolutely, it doesn't care if it's not true.
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:36.300]  They're claiming Assad's with Al Qaeda when he's been fighting Al Qaeda in ISIS.
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:40.300]  And they'll probably say I'm with them. I mean, hell, excuse me.
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:49.300]  We could play the clip of NSNBC saying that I influenced the Boston bombers and that I was deeply racist.
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:52.300]  That story doesn't have anything to do with race with no proof.
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:56.300]  My lawyer said, yes, you can win a lawsuit, but it'll take years.
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:39:00.300]  Is that what you want to spend your time on? I mean, they said I'm behind it.
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:06.300]  Just absolutely fruit loop off the wall, crazy town.
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:12.300]  It's like saying little red riding hoods, the wolf. I mean, it is just 100 day degree certified fraud.
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:18.300]  But yeah, I mean, they might say Ron Poles behind it. I mean, the sky's the limit.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:21.300]  They say Iran's behind Al Qaeda.
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:28.300]  When Iran backs Hezbollah and other countries back Hamas.
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:31.300]  I appreciate your call. Good to hear from you. Great points.
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:37.300]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in Houston, Texas. You're on the air.
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:40.300]  Three things, Alex. You might want to write them down.
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:45.300]  The first question I have for you, Mr. Jones, is prove our government funds Al Qaeda.
[01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:52.300]  And then number two, can you tell us about Michael Aquino, the former head of the NSA National Security Agency?
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:56.300]  And then three, I'd like to fly over there to California and meet David and crew.
[01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:58.300]  And where and how could I do that?
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:02.300]  Well, I can't get on air and tell you where our crew is going to be exactly because I don't even know.
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:05.300]  We're going to be David and I's going to be on air tomorrow here with us.
[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:10.300]  And then we're going to send some reporters out there. I was saying who'd be on air tomorrow with the daily weekday show.
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:14.300]  I appreciate your call. You're saying prove.
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:17.300]  I mean, I could take the rest of the show and have them.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:23.300]  Oh, you have proof. I mean, it's on record that they set up Al Qaeda in 79.
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:31.300]  It's a big presence key. It's on record Saudi Arabia protects them. It's on record. Al Qaeda in Iraq changed their name to ISIS or IS.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:35.300]  I thought you were saying you want me to prove it. You go ahead and prove it.
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:40.300]  Yeah, I thought he said he wants me to prove it or does he want to prove it?
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:45.300]  Because it says that on screen. He wanted to prove it. Let's go ahead and move along now since he hung up.
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:52.300]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Texas. I mean, I mean, that's just like saying prove the Atlantic Ocean exist.
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:57.300]  Our government funded the rebels. The main rebel group was Al Qaeda is Al Qaeda.
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:41:04.300]  They changed their name and they even endorsed Al Qaeda and the Council on Foreign Relations saying why we need Al Qaeda last year in a headline.
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:10.300]  And they funded the Muslim Brotherhood to overthrow other areas like Egypt.
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:18.300]  And they used Al Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia into Benghazi in the east of Libya to overthrow that country.
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:27.300]  I mean, that's who they're using. So there's your proof. Let's go ahead and even Rand Paul said we shouldn't be Al Qaeda's Air Force.
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:35.300]  Senator Cruz, this is a well-known thing. It's like proving that Dale Earnhardt is a champion NASCAR driver. I don't need to prove it.
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:43.300]  I've proven it 18,000 times here on air. I've made films about it. If that's what you were saying, maybe I missed what you were saying.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:50.300]  Bob in Texas, go ahead. You done a wonderful job of waking people up to Alex and hope they wake up from this show.
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:59.300]  I have a perfect question for you today given the earthquake in California and also preparations being made by FEMA in the New Madrid fault area
[01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:04.300]  and the documented increase in seismic activity all over the year.
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:16.300]  Do you think there's a possible connection between a natural catastrophe and a reason for them to create the terrorism as they cover to get control of the population before a natural catastrophe?
[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:25.300]  Well, they could use a naturally occurring natural disaster as the cover to get more control, a power grab, mission creep.
[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:36.300]  Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2008, April issue Army Times gave a press conference. They covered it saying that we do have earthquake weapons.
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:42.300]  That's now been in mainstream news. I don't know how advanced they are. I don't know if that's true, but they say they have them.
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:51.300]  Or are you saying they know a big natural disaster is coming? They're getting martial law ready for that. Which one of those are you saying?
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:57.300]  I'm saying that they probably know that there is actual calamity coming because of the increase in seismic and volcanic activity.
[01:42:57.300 --> 01:43:00.300]  Yeah, I'll cover that when we come back. That's a good point.
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:06.300]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:11.300]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:24.300]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:31.300]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:41.300]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:49.300]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund Infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:54.300]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.

[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:13.300]  Security, alert. This is Homeland Security. Analysis, Infowars building independent media operations.
[01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:18.300]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:21.300]  Prime Directive did credit Alex Jones.
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:24.300]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:27.300]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Infowars.
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:30.300]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:31.300]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:34.300]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:40.300]  They are never going to stop. They are never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:43.300]  Block free iPhone app at Infowars.com.
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:47.300]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:50.300]  Imperative, destroyed, criminal planet TV.
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.300]  You got a censor eye on the enemy.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:57.300]  Do not worry about what propaganda they put out. Collectually it's for God you can fail it.
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:33.300]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:37.300]  At the same time, the restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:39.300]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:44.300]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds.
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.300]  Is reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:48.300]  But for how long?
[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:54.300]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor.com.
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:46:22.300]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:26.300]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:30.300]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:40.300]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:45.300]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:51.300]  The new Infowars Life Lung Cleans is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:58.300]  Now available exclusively at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:31.300]  Well the National Weather Service admits that in the last 19 years the world had stopped heating up and the planet goes through different sun based cycles.
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:36.300]  The UN promptly had a vote five years ago to say the sun does not affect climate.
[01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:39.300]  That's like saying that water isn't wet.
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:52.300]  Well now it's being reported. Montana Wyoming braced for cold snow, cold temperatures while much of the US sizzles.
[01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:54.300]  Here's another headline.
[01:47:54.300 --> 01:48:02.300]  Cold summer US daily record minimums outnumbering record maximums three to one in the last 30 days.
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:17.300]  But don't worry treehugger.com has an article about a man to live on a melting iceberg for one year to urge climate change action.
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:20.300]  And of course they go and find a iceberg.
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:31.300]  Giant ones break off the southern northern pole by the tens of thousands every year that has beached itself along a coastline and then they're supposed to melt.
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:38.300]  Sometimes they drift all the way up to the equator from Antarctica on the bottom of the earth down by Chile.
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:42.300]  They'll drift thousands of miles up into the coastline of Brazil.
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:56.300]  It'll be 105 degrees and why here comes a giant iceberg and then I can go out and sit on it and literally sun on the iceberg while watching girls and bikinis on the shore and go my gosh look it's melting.
[01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:59.300]  Why look at those glaciers they're collapsing into the water.
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:10.300]  That's what glaciers do it rains and then the snow and the ice moves in glacial flows to the sea and the warmer sea makes it break up and they collapse.
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:18.300]  That's what the and then they get bigger in the winter smaller in the summer and the ice caps expand and contract.
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:28.300]  But the public again is only knows how to put on makeup or act trendy or go to fantasy football or or check their Facebook update.
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:34.300]  And so the globalists are taking big time advantage of you.
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:39.300]  It's like Al Gore putting out videos that penguins and stuff can't swim.
[01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:41.300]  Oh the poor penguins gonna drown.
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:49.300]  Oh the polar bear look at swimming out to an ice flow because everything melted no they hunt whales on the ice flows.
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:53.300]  That's when they get big and fat during the summer.
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:57.300]  Beluga whales they kill them.
[01:49:57.300 --> 01:50:00.300]  But it doesn't matter I'm a conspiracy theorist OK.
[01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:05.300]  Why they get on the news and say we've got to pass carbon taxes because all the polar bears are dying.
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:11.300]  Doesn't matter our own government's numbers are their numbers are up five fold from the 1950s facts don't matter.
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:14.300]  Two plus two equals four is a conspiracy theory.
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:18.300]  Obama says you didn't build your business and raising the debt ceiling doesn't raise the debt.
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:26.300]  And you can keep your doctor under Obamacare even though you can't and it's going to cut your premiums in half at least to the price of a cable bill or phone bill.
[01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:29.300]  It doesn't matter if that's all lies.
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:33.300]  Just call me a conspiracy theorist and that makes you intellectually cool.
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:37.300]  You don't have to have any facts with people that have more facts than you.
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:41.300]  Just say I'm a liar.
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:43.300]  And everything's OK.
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:47.300]  I want to play this clip and then get into chug night and get a few calls we have time.
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:53.300]  Democrat politician grant illegals amnesty or they will become terrorists.
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:51:05.300]  Democrat state representative and candidate for the U.S. representative Pat Murphy said that if the underage migrants who have come to the U.S. from Central America aren't given a pathway to citizenship they could become terrorists.
[01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:07.300]  Let's play a clip of that.
[01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:09.300]  You do what we want or stuff's going to get blown up.
[01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:10.300]  Hell don't say that.
[01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:11.300]  Just blame it on the Tea Party.
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:12.300]  That's easier.
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:14.300]  Blame global warming on them.
[01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:15.300]  Here it is.
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:18.300]  We need to make sure that we take care of the children that are coming up here.
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:19.300]  They're not from Mexico.
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:20.300]  They're coming from further south.
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:26.300]  We need to make sure that when we're talking about these children we need to treat them like they're our children or our grandchildren.
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:36.300]  If they're going to be refugees, which several of them are going to be, we need to make sure that we have one we take care of them and we create a pathway for citizenship and set up education for them.
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:42.300]  So they don't become the same problem that we're currently having in the Middle East that they'll be a terrorist a generation from now.
[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:51.300]  Yeah, because Afghanistan is south of us, not east or west, especially on the same parallel as New York.
[01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:54.300]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:59.300]  And really, they're saying worldwide poor kids come here, will make you wards of the state.
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:00.300]  You'll be the future cops.
[01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:03.300]  You'll be the enforcers, which they've done in England the last 30 years.
[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:07.300]  They brought in poor kids from Europe, Eastern Europe, and they are now the social workers in the cops.
[01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:09.300]  And let me tell you, they do what the government says.
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:17.300]  The Soviets do that, and Putin still does it, where they take orphans and make them the enforcers of the state.
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:18.300]  That's even been on ABC News.
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:19.300]  Look it up.
[01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:21.300]  I mean, this is so diabolical.
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:26.300]  They want a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military.
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:28.300]  And they need to have that five, 10 years down the road.
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:31.300]  This is a long term strategic takeover.
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:35.300]  And they set the precedent that all immigrants are little children.
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:41.300]  And so you're against the children, just all sick political sociopaths.
[01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:48.300]  And just look at the quickest way to get money and power and to leverage the giant third world populations against this country.
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:51.300]  And to turn us into a giant third world pit as well.
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:58.300]  Not to help the third world, but to enrich a new chief class, a new LFA class here in America.
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:00.300]  Truly disgusting.
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:06.300]  Now, earlier I talked about this, and when I put this out on YouTube tomorrow, or perhaps on the radio show tomorrow,
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:11.300]  I want to merge this piece of the live radio show, but I want to play this tomorrow during that live show,
[01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:14.300]  with what I talked about earlier, or maybe I'll just do it tomorrow.
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:21.300]  But I've discussed a lot here on air about weaponized culture, weaponized media.
[01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:28.300]  How sports has been designed for thousands of years to politically divert the masses from real issues
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:34.300]  so that men won't try to be politically active to better their lot and their families' lot,
[01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:42.300]  but that they'll be obsessed with the local horse races or gladiatorial events or baseball or football in the year 2014.
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:48.300]  Not saying it's inherently bad in and of itself, but it's deployed to control you
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:56.300]  and to fill the gap in men's brains that is designed for strategy and designed for being involved.
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:54:00.300]  You should be worrying about getting a better job, being more successful, taking care of your family,
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:04.300]  how the world really works, how to protect your liberties and freedoms,
[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:08.300]  how to stop combines from starting monopolies that shut you down.
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:14.300]  Instead, you want to know about fantasy football, and women just want to run around and think they get ahead
[01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:16.300]  if they put their man down, because that's the message.
[01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:18.300]  Put your man down, you get ahead.
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:20.300]  Dominate the man, you get ahead.
[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:25.300]  No, dominate the globalist, create a free market, build a good society, raise good children.
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:30.300]  Then your family gets ahead, but it's all a bunch of so-called individuals.
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:34.300]  See, they attack individualism if it isn't what the state wants.
[01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:36.300]  Individual freedom.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:40.300]  But when they call it individualism, they mean only worry about yourself.
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:46.300]  And nobody pushes being more self-centered, more goblin-like than the whole music industry,
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:53.300]  with the hardcore rock and roll, degrading women and men, the drugs, the Satanism.
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:56.300]  But that wasn't hardcore enough by the mid-90s.
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:55:02.300]  Sumner Redstone, Viacom, MTV, on record,
[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:06.300]  I've talked to top people, it's been documented, books have been written on the subject,
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:10.300]  Professor Griff Karris won so many others, they came in and they said,
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:15.300]  we're not going to have hip-hop about empowering intercity communities and getting true equality.
[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:20.300]  We're going to fund gangster rap, hip-hop, thug rap, just like the CIA,
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:23.300]  ship cocaine into the intercities to start an implosion.
[01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:32.300]  Then by the early and mid-90s, they shipped in Shug Knight and Biggie and Tupac,
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:37.300]  and all these people that got whacked out and killed because of the devilish culture they were putting out,
[01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:42.300]  and that it's cool to sling the rock and have the hose and the grill and everything else,
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:47.300]  and that's how you're a man is not taking care of your family, but not caring about anybody but yourself.
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:52.300]  And how many of these guys get gunned down? How many of them get killed? How many of them?
[01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:59.300]  And they sell the idea. The only way you get ahead is being a hip-hop, rapper, an OG, an original gangster.
[01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:06.300]  How good it feels to be a gangster? Or you're a footballer, baseballer, basketball player.
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:12.300]  Only a few thousand slots to be in any of those places, but people think that's how you're successful.
[01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:19.300]  And meanwhile, you fall in as the cannon fodder to use the drugs, to sell the drugs, to be jokes, to be primed for prison,
[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:26.300]  ready to be rolled into the giant private prisons, which they segregate by black, white, and Hispanic and Asian.
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:31.300]  Just like they're segregating the country, according to that, and the government's the referee,
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:38.300]  protecting everyone from the gang culture that was sent like a psychic or psychological warfare torpedo in
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:47.300]  to destroy all these people. It is a demonic, sickening, arrogant, narcissistic,
[01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:57.300]  bloated degenerate culture that you see being pushed by the hip-hop culture.
[01:56:57.300 --> 01:57:05.300]  It is absolute death, and it's taken black communities in the 50s with lower illegitimacy
[01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:13.300]  than were in the white communities to a world record of 90 to 91 or even higher percentage points.
[01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:23.300]  And now you see weird rap-style gangster country music and weird gangster-style rock and roll.
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:26.300]  It is so out of control. I'm sorry to other callers, I'm out of time.
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:30.300]  But we'll be back tomorrow, live, 11 a.m. Central Standard Time.
[01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:35.300]  By the way, you have experienced the Alex Jones experience. Joe Rogan is on tomorrow.
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:37.300]  I'm going to take the interview with him when he was here last week.
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:41.300]  We hung out. That's going to be on tomorrow, and the rest will be on the nightly news tomorrow.
[01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:50.300]  But we'll be back 11 a.m. Central, live. Spread the word about this transmission, folks, because you are The Resistance.
[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:58.300]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sown American-made genes.

[01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:24.300]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Supermale, and then when Superfemale came out.
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:29.300]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:30.300]  Talk about the effects.
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:37.300]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning. I have drive to go to the gym. I feel like I look better. I feel better. I feel sexier. I love it.

[01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:55.300]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:58:55.300 --> 01:59:00.300]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:05.300]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:59:05.300 --> 01:59:13.300]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:21.300]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth and deep earth crystals.
[01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:25.300]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:30.300]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:39.300]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:43.300]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.
