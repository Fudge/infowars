[00:00.000 --> 00:18.520]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:18.520 --> 00:21.920]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:21.920 --> 00:25.400]  I see your hair is burning.
[00:25.400 --> 00:30.320]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday, January the 12th, 2007.
[00:30.320 --> 00:38.040]  The Senate has begun the dismantling of Obamacare, the dismantling of Barack Obama's legacy.
[00:38.040 --> 00:42.360]  And of course, Barack Obama has spent the last eight years dismantling America, so
[00:42.360 --> 00:44.320]  it's great to see this coming.
[00:44.320 --> 00:45.320]  And we're going to be talking about that.
[00:45.320 --> 00:49.920]  We're going to talk about the war that is developed between Donald Trump and the press,
[00:49.920 --> 00:52.120]  but there's more than that.
[00:52.120 --> 00:53.680]  It's what's behind it.
[00:53.680 --> 00:58.560]  And you can see this in the other stories that have surfaced today, a couple of stories
[00:58.560 --> 01:01.920]  that are up on the Drudge Report, one about babies being made without mothers.
[01:01.920 --> 01:04.240]  That's going to come sooner than you think, they say.
[01:04.240 --> 01:08.480]  And so we just talked about the possibility of this, technically, a year or so ago.
[01:08.480 --> 01:11.360]  Now it's looking like this is going to come very, very quickly.
[01:11.360 --> 01:17.000]  Same thing we've been hearing from these genetic engineers with CRISPR, the gene editing software.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.080]  They met like first time 40 years ago, and they said, well, yeah, let's talk about this
[01:20.080 --> 01:23.080]  in general, but it's going to be certainly not in our lifetime.
[01:23.080 --> 01:26.040]  Now the same scientists are meeting there and saying, this has gone way too fast.
[01:26.040 --> 01:29.040]  How do we get ahead of this in terms of the moral and ethical issues?
[01:29.040 --> 01:32.960]  And of course, there's moral and ethical issues with artificial intelligence as well.
[01:32.960 --> 01:37.920]  The top of Drudge Report is talking about robots and their legal protection, treating
[01:37.920 --> 01:39.560]  them as humans.
[01:39.560 --> 01:45.160]  So what we've got here is a situation of, we've seen a lot of 1984, but we've also seen
[01:45.160 --> 01:47.400]  a lot of Brave New World.
[01:47.400 --> 01:51.720]  And I think for the most part, people who fight the system, who notice what's going on, they're
[01:51.720 --> 01:56.600]  going to get 1984, they're going to get the boot stomping on their face.
[01:56.600 --> 02:02.560]  For the rest of the crowd, who is just easily distracted with entertainment, with hedonism,
[02:02.560 --> 02:04.400]  they're going to get Brave New World.
[02:04.400 --> 02:07.480]  And now we throw iRobot into the mix, Isaac Asmob.
[02:07.480 --> 02:11.480]  I mean, they're even quoting the robotics laws from Isaac Asmob.
[02:11.480 --> 02:15.360]  And you've seen this done many times with Twilight Zone.
[02:15.360 --> 02:17.960]  You of course had movies that have been made of this as well.
[02:17.960 --> 02:22.280]  A robot made out of harm humanity, or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm, etc., etc.
[02:22.280 --> 02:25.720]  Okay, we're going to have, we're going to call them the positronic brains as well.
[02:25.720 --> 02:27.520]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[02:27.520 --> 02:30.960]  He's going to talk about the most important information we've ever had.
[02:30.960 --> 02:33.200]  And of course, one of the other things that's happened that we're going to be talking about
[02:33.200 --> 02:36.920]  in the show today is the move by the EPA.
[02:36.920 --> 02:41.680]  This agency that is drunk on power and thinks that they control everything.
[02:41.680 --> 02:47.680]  And of course, this also boils into the entire globalist agenda, Agenda 21.
[02:47.680 --> 02:52.640]  They're now coming after Chrysler, after perhaps bankrupting VW.
[02:52.640 --> 02:57.480]  But they're coming after diesel fuel, because that's what they want to shut down.
[02:57.480 --> 03:01.680]  And this goes all the way back to one of the first reports I had when I came here at Infowars.
[03:01.680 --> 03:06.000]  Their phony testing, their rigged emissions testing, where they were testing on human
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.440]  beings, hooking them up to diesel tailpipes, searching for people who had heart and respiratory
[03:12.440 --> 03:17.080]  issues, and doing that right there where I was living in North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
[03:17.080 --> 03:18.800]  Because there's a big EPA facility there.
[03:18.800 --> 03:19.800]  Then they did it in California.
[03:19.800 --> 03:22.960]  I was there with a group that tried to stop human experimentation.
[03:22.960 --> 03:25.760]  They were doing it to further their climate change agenda.
[03:25.760 --> 03:28.080]  So we're going to be talking to Mark Marino, a climate depot.
[03:28.080 --> 03:30.000]  He's going to also be coming up on the show.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.680]  And then we're going to have comments about this developing war from Lionel as well.
[03:34.680 --> 03:35.680]  It's pretty amazing.
[03:35.680 --> 03:42.360]  We've got people from the former defense spokesman in Germany saying that Washington
[03:42.360 --> 03:47.120]  seems to be on the brink of civil war as elites fuel anti-Trump hostility.
[03:47.120 --> 03:50.800]  That's a former German member of parliament, also a spokesman for the Defense Agency.
[03:50.800 --> 03:55.240]  He said, we had very good relations between European nations and Russia until Washington
[03:55.240 --> 03:56.320]  changed it.
[03:56.320 --> 04:00.160]  The Russian reset, as they called it, but it's actually a reset of the Cold War.
[04:00.160 --> 04:04.080]  And then of course, you have Glenn Greenwall saying the deep state goes to war with President
[04:04.080 --> 04:07.080]  Elect using unverified claims as Democrats cheer.
[04:07.080 --> 04:12.200]  And he makes it very clear, certainly Glenn Greenwall doesn't like Donald Trump.
[04:12.200 --> 04:15.120]  He makes it very clear he doesn't like Donald Trump, but he's concerned about something
[04:15.120 --> 04:17.760]  that is even more dangerous.
[04:17.760 --> 04:23.800]  And that is the fact that the CIA would be doing this types of things to a president
[04:23.800 --> 04:27.160]  and that the left would cheer for it out of sheer partisanship.
[04:27.160 --> 04:28.720]  It's just fine to be partisan.
[04:28.720 --> 04:31.080]  It's fine to have an opinion about things.
[04:31.080 --> 04:36.840]  But when you start authorizing censorship, we start authorizing clandestine operations.
[04:36.840 --> 04:40.200]  Now you are burning down the republic.
[04:40.200 --> 04:41.200]  So stay with us.
[04:41.200 --> 04:43.880]  This is going to be coming up with the most important information ever.
[04:43.880 --> 05:00.480]  We'll be right back after this break.
[05:00.480 --> 05:03.160]  Just where does CNN find their news sources?
[05:03.160 --> 05:07.440]  If you recall, they first suggested that the Russians hacked the election to help get Donald
[05:07.440 --> 05:08.440]  Trump elected.
[05:08.440 --> 05:12.560]  And yesterday, they're reporting now that intel chiefs are presenting Trump with claims
[05:12.560 --> 05:15.000]  of Russian efforts to compromise him.
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.800]  What they're insinuating, directly quoting here from their website, classified documents
[05:18.800 --> 05:23.560]  presented last week, the President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations
[05:23.560 --> 05:28.720]  that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump.
[05:28.720 --> 05:33.000]  This of course is coming from, quote, multiple U.S. officials with direct knowledge on the
[05:33.000 --> 05:34.000]  briefings.
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.920]  And really, what they're insinuating is that the Russians have finance secrets and sexual
[05:38.920 --> 05:42.720]  deviant secrets about Trump that could be used to blackmail him.
[05:42.720 --> 05:46.880]  They're also claiming that one reason the nation's intelligence chiefs took an extraordinary
[05:46.880 --> 05:51.560]  step of including the synopsis in the briefing of documents was to make Donald Trump aware
[05:51.560 --> 05:54.920]  that such allegations involving him were circulating among their agencies.
[05:54.920 --> 05:56.640]  I can't make this up if I tried.
[05:56.640 --> 06:00.000]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for Infowars.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:04.600]  I want to encourage all of you to remember how high the stakes really are right now in
[06:04.600 --> 06:07.480]  the battle for freedom, and the information war is paramount.
[06:07.480 --> 06:11.680]  That's why it's more important than ever that you spread the word about infowars.com and
[06:11.680 --> 06:15.720]  send out the links so people can watch the free feeds and get the free podcasts and download
[06:15.720 --> 06:19.520]  the free iPhone and droid apps at infowars.com forward slash show.
[06:19.520 --> 06:24.280]  It is critical that we be able to email you when we're being cyber attacked or shut down.
[06:24.280 --> 06:28.120]  Sign up to get our email alerts at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[06:28.120 --> 06:32.840]  Finally, we have launched our new free app at infowars.com forward slash app.
[06:32.840 --> 06:35.000]  You can download it on iPhone and droid.
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.320]  Once you've downloaded the free app at infowars.com forward slash app, you can then of you choose
[06:39.320 --> 06:42.400]  pay 4.95 a month to get info wars prime.
[06:42.400 --> 06:47.400]  We produce documentaries, special reports, live events and so much more on a daily and
[06:47.400 --> 06:49.720]  weekly basis just for prime members.
[06:49.720 --> 06:53.920]  We also have daily specials, sometimes as much as 50% off for members of info wars
[06:53.920 --> 06:54.920]  prime.
[06:54.920 --> 06:55.920]  Infowars has come a long way.
[06:55.920 --> 06:59.920]  And info wars prime is just one more weapon in the fight for liberty.
[06:59.920 --> 07:04.320]  More than two years ago, info wars first told you about our research into what has been
[07:04.320 --> 07:06.320]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[07:06.320 --> 07:10.400]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[07:10.400 --> 07:15.600]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[07:15.600 --> 07:19.360]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family into the water.
[07:19.360 --> 07:23.040]  They took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in.
[07:23.040 --> 07:27.600]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[07:27.600 --> 07:30.040]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[07:30.040 --> 07:35.480]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[07:35.480 --> 07:41.280]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[07:41.280 --> 07:42.880]  ever concerning iodine.
[07:42.880 --> 07:44.840]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[07:44.840 --> 07:49.080]  This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to
[07:49.080 --> 07:51.360]  any optimum health regimen.
[07:51.360 --> 07:59.080]  Click up on Survival Shield X2 Today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[08:11.080 --> 08:17.200]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[08:17.200 --> 08:22.000]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.800]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[08:30.800 --> 08:33.560]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[08:33.560 --> 08:37.720]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those
[08:37.720 --> 08:40.800]  over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[08:40.800 --> 08:45.320]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[08:45.320 --> 08:47.880]  The guns will be taken and no one will be able to be armed.
[08:47.880 --> 08:49.160]  We will take all weapons.
[08:49.160 --> 08:51.480]  Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in.
[08:51.480 --> 08:56.040]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[08:56.040 --> 08:57.040]  Enough.
[08:57.040 --> 08:58.040]  Enough.
[08:58.040 --> 08:59.040]  Enough.
[08:59.040 --> 09:00.040]  Enough.
[09:00.040 --> 09:03.760]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[09:03.760 --> 09:07.840]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[09:07.840 --> 09:12.880]  MSKSLA News 12 Jeff Carroll discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially
[09:12.880 --> 09:14.720]  their biggest problem.
[09:14.720 --> 09:15.720]  Us.
[09:15.720 --> 09:18.960]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to
[09:18.960 --> 09:22.960]  their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[09:22.960 --> 09:29.680]  If you've got a business that you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen.
[09:29.680 --> 09:34.600]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[09:34.600 --> 09:35.600]  Pediatrics.
[09:35.600 --> 09:40.800]  Black Hawk choppers soaring through the night sky but this is only a drill.
[09:40.800 --> 09:53.040]  Only armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect house to house.
[09:53.040 --> 09:59.480]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police also military.
[09:59.480 --> 10:00.480]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[10:00.480 --> 10:01.480]  Go back and solve it right now.
[10:01.480 --> 10:02.480]  I am inside.
[10:02.480 --> 10:03.480]  I have two words for you.
[10:03.480 --> 10:04.480]  Predator drones.
[10:04.480 --> 10:05.480]  You will never see it coming.
[10:05.480 --> 10:16.280]  The dramatic scene laid out in front of our cameras, parents grabbing their children and
[10:16.280 --> 10:20.400]  running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves
[10:20.400 --> 10:23.680]  face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[10:23.680 --> 10:24.680]  They let them in the area.
[10:24.680 --> 10:28.280]  They told them they could come in and now they're coming in like their trespassers punching
[10:28.280 --> 10:29.280]  and shoving people.
[10:29.280 --> 10:34.480]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down.
[10:34.480 --> 10:40.040]  If you want a commentator, we are on the march.
[10:40.040 --> 10:42.800]  The Empire is on the run.
[10:42.800 --> 10:47.800]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[10:47.800 --> 10:56.960]  The revolution is in my door to rest out too far and it's the way all the ways they have
[10:56.960 --> 10:57.960]  to live.
[10:57.960 --> 11:07.960]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[11:07.960 --> 11:33.960]  This is the heart of 1776.
[11:33.960 --> 11:59.160]  I am not at liberty still to talk about major developments that are the biggest of not just
[11:59.160 --> 12:05.480]  my career on air, but quite frankly, this country, this is a lot bigger than Infowars
[12:05.480 --> 12:09.160]  and myself and we are obviously intimately involved in it.
[12:09.160 --> 12:14.800]  The country is in an all out civil war against foreign multinational banks that believe they
[12:14.800 --> 12:16.800]  own and control it.
[12:16.800 --> 12:21.120]  They're allied with the communist Chinese, the EU bureaucrats that have hijacked Europe,
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.480]  the Saudi Arabian, Islamic caliphate.
[12:25.480 --> 12:30.640]  This is truly World War IV, it's economic, it's cultural, and if you get military any
[12:30.640 --> 12:36.720]  day, we are truly seeing the sad depths to which our nation has sunk, the criminal rogue
[12:36.720 --> 12:46.040]  elements of the CIA led by Brennan and Clapper and others who lie to the American people
[12:46.040 --> 12:50.960]  to our faces constantly and told us the TNSA doesn't spy on Americans, period, that doesn't
[12:50.960 --> 12:51.960]  exist.
[12:51.960 --> 13:00.560]  That was what Clapper told everybody and now they've come out with this fake dossier that
[13:00.560 --> 13:04.840]  when I saw it two and a half, three days ago, and wait a minute, I saw this before, Fortan
[13:04.840 --> 13:11.080]  had this, the big hacker group, over a year ago and was passing it around as a joke.
[13:11.080 --> 13:18.320]  It's misspelled, it's got fake names, wrong names, it's a classic setup like the one
[13:18.320 --> 13:25.760]  Carl Rove famously reportedly gave to Dan rather to mess up his whole Texas National Guard
[13:25.760 --> 13:30.920]  story as a poison pill into the rest of the story that was actually true, not a fan of
[13:30.920 --> 13:36.040]  Dan rather overall, but compared to Rachel Maddow or other CIA operatives like Anderson
[13:36.040 --> 13:42.520]  Cooper, he's an angel, but instead of them backing off when Trump came out and said your
[13:42.520 --> 13:49.760]  fake news and Time Warner stock dipping and people really waking up and even CNN had to
[13:49.760 --> 13:53.480]  admit that Trump nailed the press conference and knocked it out of the park of Grand Slam.
[13:53.480 --> 13:57.440]  Instead of that, they have tripled down and Anderson Cooper and everybody else are actually
[13:57.440 --> 14:00.520]  defending PPGate.
[14:00.520 --> 14:05.240]  This is just so incredible, totally and completely made up.
[14:05.240 --> 14:10.520]  Now folks are asking, is this from Hackers, Fortan and their spoofing board, their famous
[14:10.520 --> 14:15.400]  trolling board, the King of the Trolls, or is this opposition research?
[14:15.400 --> 14:16.400]  Well, it's both.
[14:16.400 --> 14:22.600]  This is opposition research, Mark Dice correctly called it two days ago.
[14:22.600 --> 14:27.240]  This is opposition research where they just cook up a bunch of lies and a bunch of disinformation
[14:27.240 --> 14:31.960]  and start floating it out there and then got floated on the web back before the Republican
[14:31.960 --> 14:34.080]  primaries over a year ago.
[14:34.080 --> 14:36.720]  We're talking, this happened like 16 months ago.
[14:36.720 --> 14:45.640]  This happened in, back in late 2015, this is just incredible.
[14:45.640 --> 14:48.960]  Was the first time this stuff started floating around.
[14:48.960 --> 14:54.800]  So this shows us with eight days left, the sky is the limit and let me assure everybody,
[14:54.800 --> 14:58.720]  I said this a month ago, got picked up by a lot of different publications.
[14:58.720 --> 15:04.080]  You can simply Google Alex Jones, CIA, planning to kill Donald Trump.
[15:04.080 --> 15:06.360]  Now the media kind of took what I said out of context.
[15:06.360 --> 15:10.640]  I said the fact that they're announcing continuity of government, the fact that they're announcing
[15:10.640 --> 15:14.280]  COG, the fact that they're announcing that they believe Russians have basically taken
[15:14.280 --> 15:17.320]  over the government, that's what they're saying, they're claiming Trump's a Russian
[15:17.320 --> 15:18.320]  agent.
[15:18.320 --> 15:25.520]  They're selling that out into the public ahead of an attempt at a coup d'etat, an assassination,
[15:25.520 --> 15:29.640]  or the type of coup d'etat where they just indict Trump or indict his underlings and
[15:29.640 --> 15:30.920]  use fake evidence.
[15:30.920 --> 15:36.640]  It's a continuum where they're just ramping up the background noise to see what the public
[15:36.640 --> 15:40.320]  will buy and the public's not buying at the poll show but they don't care, they're so
[15:40.320 --> 15:44.480]  committed it's a plan that it appears they're going to go ahead and follow through with,
[15:44.480 --> 15:48.000]  just like they followed through with Hillary, just like they followed through with Jeb Bush
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.760]  on the tickets that blew up in their face.
[15:50.760 --> 15:57.200]  So they are arrogant, they are insane, but they are in control and they do have a plan
[15:57.200 --> 15:59.200]  and they are moving forward, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:59.200 --> 16:05.000]  Now let's remember John McCain publicly poses with Al Nussra and Al Qaeda and ISIS fighters
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.840]  and is behind basically with Hillary, the entire Syria five-year nightmare and 300,000
[16:09.840 --> 16:10.840]  dead.
[16:10.840 --> 16:15.320]  This is a monstrous creature who hasn't found a war he doesn't like, he's called for net
[16:15.320 --> 16:16.320]  censorship.
[16:16.320 --> 16:20.920]  He called for, quote, blowing up people's computers that criticize the government eight
[16:20.920 --> 16:24.920]  years ago, you can actually Google that, or if you, quote, violate copyright, no judge,
[16:24.920 --> 16:29.360]  no jury, quote, send a virus to, quote, blow up your computer.
[16:29.360 --> 16:38.320]  So he is a mad dog, just insanely arrogant, out of control, up on the intelligence committee,
[16:38.320 --> 16:49.760]  taking a four-chan dossier that was obviously, they now admit, produced for opposition research
[16:49.760 --> 16:55.520]  by some former MI6 spooks, now, ladies and gentlemen, notice it continues to be MI6 time
[16:55.520 --> 17:00.880]  and time again, it continues to pop up and plan the Russians are running everything.
[17:00.880 --> 17:04.760]  Remember the famous polonium poisoning and all the rest of that, it dropped to be a false
[17:04.760 --> 17:05.760]  flag.
[17:05.760 --> 17:08.960]  I guess one of their double agents they were getting rid of.
[17:08.960 --> 17:14.120]  So this is very, very serious when you see them involved, because they see the United
[17:14.120 --> 17:18.320]  States as part of their larger empire, they made deals in the 20s to merge the British
[17:18.320 --> 17:22.640]  empire, that's what the council of farm relations is all about.
[17:22.640 --> 17:30.160]  So this is, this is the maximum moment of crisis for this country and the world.
[17:30.160 --> 17:34.600]  Everybody should be praying for Donald Trump, everybody should be praying for myself, everybody
[17:34.600 --> 17:39.040]  should be praying for Roger Stone, everybody should be praying for anybody that's prominent
[17:39.040 --> 17:44.600]  that's supporting Trump, because let me just give you a newsflash, okay?
[17:44.600 --> 17:49.840]  There's all hell breaking loose behind the scenes and I quite frankly, quite frankly,
[17:49.840 --> 17:52.720]  you're not like having to sit here and knowing all this and not able to tell you and I'm
[17:52.720 --> 17:56.280]  not trying to pick your interest, everybody knows, if I have a top story and I say it's
[17:56.280 --> 17:59.360]  coming up the next hour, I'll go ahead and just tell you right up front, because I don't
[17:59.360 --> 18:03.080]  like holding on to stuff, I don't build things up like other talks to host, I just give you
[18:03.080 --> 18:08.560]  everything I got right up front, because there's always so much more coming anyways and I just
[18:08.560 --> 18:13.120]  cannot tell you, look at all the hell this breaking loose, ladies and gentlemen, fake
[18:13.120 --> 18:17.960]  dossiers, the media not caring they've been caught, this look of total insanity in the
[18:17.960 --> 18:24.320]  CNN reporter's eyes, this is a look of total commitment and two weeks ago, I ominously
[18:24.320 --> 18:28.080]  told everybody that I was watching the body language of different spooks on CNN and they
[18:28.080 --> 18:32.360]  said, it is now Trump's fault from the situation around when he had a filling guest, what is
[18:32.360 --> 18:36.240]  coming now with a huge war will be his fault and his supporter's fault.
[18:36.240 --> 18:42.080]  We have tried, but we have failed, I mean it was like in, you know, Superman too, when
[18:42.080 --> 18:46.600]  they're sitting there committing the General Zod to the Phantom Zone, they're like guilty,
[18:46.600 --> 18:54.920]  guilty, what is all that, guilty, the final verdict, guilty, I mean you can see the criminal
[18:54.920 --> 18:59.760]  commitment in these people's eyes, in their actions, they think we're the bad guys and
[18:59.760 --> 19:03.920]  they're going to pull something big in the next eight days, you see it exponentially
[19:03.920 --> 19:11.720]  getting worse every single day in magnitude and if you plot the next level, it's going
[19:11.720 --> 19:17.440]  to be fake witnesses, women giving press conferences that Donald Trump raped them or that women
[19:17.440 --> 19:22.160]  delivered children to him to rape, I mean it's going to be the most horrible and sane
[19:22.160 --> 19:27.840]  crap or the public is just in hysteria, not knowing what to believe and then boom, a truck
[19:27.840 --> 19:33.920]  mom goes off or boom, you know, some crazy assassin storms the building.
[19:33.920 --> 19:37.080]  Of course Trump's got to have his own private security, it isn't that most of the secret
[19:37.080 --> 19:41.640]  service are great, wonderful, hardworking veterans and patriots and good people, but
[19:41.640 --> 19:46.120]  of course it's a federal government body under the control of Obama for eight years and the
[19:46.120 --> 19:50.800]  globalists before that, it's totally infiltrated with killers, with operatives, with double
[19:50.800 --> 19:54.640]  and triple agents, I mean that's one of the number one targets you do penetrate as a foreign
[19:54.640 --> 20:00.000]  state or as a globalist operation, so while they're, and I happen to know about Trump's
[20:00.000 --> 20:06.160]  security just separately through other people, okay, not through Roger Stone but through
[20:06.160 --> 20:10.320]  other sources, there might always think it's Roger Stone, it's kind of like a secret service
[20:10.320 --> 20:16.040]  info, I always think it's Dan Montino, he's a guest on the show, I have it from people
[20:16.040 --> 20:21.480]  inside the military and let's just say multiple sources in special forces command and all
[20:21.480 --> 20:26.320]  the rest of it of where Trump got his security and I'm not giving up any security information
[20:26.320 --> 20:30.720]  that the globalists don't already know, okay, but he's got department of defense people,
[20:30.720 --> 20:35.120]  now he's president-elect, he's got top former department of defense people before that
[20:35.120 --> 20:42.720]  that do some of the most important security work and high value target defense out there,
[20:42.720 --> 20:48.640]  okay, but just understand this, this country is under siege, everybody's got to be praying
[20:48.640 --> 20:53.960]  hourly that the truth come out and I'm telling all the patriots in government, all the patriots
[20:53.960 --> 20:59.080]  in corporations, everybody, you must leak everything you've got on the enemy now, this
[20:59.080 --> 21:03.640]  is the time, drop everything you've got on them, if you're inside a corporation, if you're
[21:03.640 --> 21:07.600]  inside one of their operations and you've got intel that brings down any globalist,
[21:07.600 --> 21:11.720]  hit them hard, any one of these operatives we politically take out right now is a major
[21:11.720 --> 21:19.080]  victory, they know that against us, okay, understand that they are going after basically
[21:19.080 --> 21:22.320]  all the high value targets that support Trump and I'm just going to leave it there for my
[21:22.320 --> 21:30.080]  own safety and end issues, okay, so listen to me very, very carefully, ladies and gentlemen,
[21:30.080 --> 21:34.600]  this is the fight right now for this whole country's soul, this country's future, but
[21:34.600 --> 21:38.720]  not just this country, the world, and I want to give the globalist a very important message
[21:38.720 --> 21:44.320]  I want to skip this network breaks, we have more time, I want to give a message to the
[21:44.320 --> 21:49.600]  new world order, you have failed, you can look at the tea leaves, I know you're so evil
[21:49.600 --> 21:54.360]  and so turned over wickedness, it's not like I'm here trying to demoralize you, I want
[21:54.360 --> 22:01.720]  you to know that we know and that we're declaring it here publicly, you have failed no matter
[22:01.720 --> 22:07.520]  what you do, any angle you go down, any road you go down only buys you a little more time,
[22:07.520 --> 22:13.960]  but makes your fall that much harder when you finally get there, globalism is exposed
[22:13.960 --> 22:22.160]  as a corporate fraud, as a new imperium, as a new royalty, tax exempt above the law, globalism
[22:22.160 --> 22:29.960]  has been exposed as a anti-human eugenics based system, your whole new world order program
[22:29.960 --> 22:36.200]  is dead on arrival, all of you are being identified worldwide by patriots in government and corporations
[22:36.200 --> 22:41.080]  and private life everywhere, and the fact that you have tried to force your world government
[22:41.080 --> 22:46.400]  here at the end when the planet was rejecting it, the fact that you've tried to force the
[22:46.400 --> 22:53.880]  destruction of nation states and this global corporate overwrite is only going to accelerate
[22:53.880 --> 23:00.360]  the fall of your system, so know this, you may be able to stop people and kill people
[23:00.360 --> 23:05.560]  and poison people and do all the evil stuff you've been doing forever to third world countries
[23:05.560 --> 23:09.760]  that you're now doing here, but you're a bunch of bullies, and the reason I had them air
[23:09.760 --> 23:15.480]  that intro from earlier that's about four years old, three years old, is where I say
[23:15.480 --> 23:20.600]  we're not turning our guns in and we're not backing down, so if you want them, come and
[23:20.600 --> 23:25.320]  take them, and those are real declarations, I'll be quite honest, the fact that this
[23:25.320 --> 23:31.440]  has gone into the physical realm and the fact that this has escalated up into these higher
[23:31.440 --> 23:36.160]  areas makes me very, very excited at a fundamental level of victory because we have pushed the
[23:36.160 --> 23:42.760]  enemy in nakedly making up the most ridiculous unsubstantiated garbage publicly, we have
[23:42.760 --> 23:48.720]  pushed them into persecuting the press and intimidating people and really showing everybody
[23:48.720 --> 23:55.960]  exactly who they really are and the fact that this has happened and the fact that they have
[23:55.960 --> 24:01.160]  taken the gloves off metaphysically and historically shows us they're losing and they know they're
[24:01.160 --> 24:06.080]  going down the tubes and that's why everything they do is blowing up in their face, so instead
[24:06.080 --> 24:10.440]  again they're only intensifying when they get caught with a year and a half old, almost
[24:10.440 --> 24:17.800]  a year and a half old, piece of total made up garbage that a 12-year-old probably wrote
[24:17.800 --> 24:22.280]  and the fact that they're all passing that around as their great evidence of how Russia
[24:22.280 --> 24:26.800]  has infiltrated our country when it's globalism has infiltrated our country, when they're
[24:26.800 --> 24:30.920]  the traitors and it's Hillary meeting secretly with Putin and it's Henry Kissinger that's
[24:30.920 --> 24:37.440]  Putin's top adviser on and on and on, the fact that everything they say about us is
[24:37.440 --> 24:43.160]  what they're doing and this is now all blowing up in their face and so this battle is the
[24:43.160 --> 24:45.600]  animating contest of liberty.
[24:45.600 --> 24:50.080]  This fight is what grows our muscles, grows our movement for national sovereignty and
[24:50.080 --> 24:55.360]  anti-neural order, anti-globalism from 15 years ago, maybe one in 50 people knew the
[24:55.360 --> 24:58.920]  Federal Reserve was private, maybe one in 50 people knew about the Neural Order, now
[24:58.920 --> 25:04.440]  almost everybody does and the growth curve is so fast now that even the most zombie-type
[25:04.440 --> 25:11.640]  people are now starting to wake up but notice MSM has its old instincts where they would
[25:11.640 --> 25:16.520]  operate with no opposition or they could put out any lies they ever wanted to, well now
[25:16.520 --> 25:21.840]  they don't just not have air superiority, they are being dominated by us and others
[25:21.840 --> 25:26.600]  so good luck hacking Drudge, good luck trying to shut him down for two weeks straight and
[25:26.600 --> 25:31.880]  us for a month straight, good luck, all you do is send us more traffic as everybody realizes
[25:31.880 --> 25:36.680]  how real this is, all you've done is come out from the shadows, we forced you out of
[25:36.680 --> 25:41.640]  the shadows, we forced you to name us, we forced you to admit you're afraid of us but
[25:41.640 --> 25:45.720]  what you're afraid of is the truth you see, I don't want to just sit here like a peacock
[25:45.720 --> 25:50.400]  in some mansion and be powerful and have minions under me, I want to restore the republic,
[25:50.400 --> 25:56.280]  I want to empower humanity, I want to treat babies bodies with respect and not sell their
[25:56.280 --> 26:04.960]  body parts, I want to bring back pro-human ideas, I want to empower culture and the world,
[26:04.960 --> 26:08.600]  that's what I believe in because I know this body doesn't go that long but my genetics
[26:08.600 --> 26:13.240]  go on forever as long as the species is destroyed, I want to add another big pointer today, there's
[26:13.240 --> 26:19.840]  an RT article up on info wars.com where governments and parliaments are calling, I told you this
[26:19.840 --> 26:25.600]  has been coming for over 15 years, they're calling for a bill of rights for artificial
[26:25.600 --> 26:31.120]  intelligence and robots, that's because this isn't real life folks but the elites will
[26:31.120 --> 26:35.920]  control it and backdoor it and will now be able to out vote us claiming all this tech
[26:35.920 --> 26:40.800]  and all this surveillance and all this AI that's swallowing up our species now is its
[26:40.800 --> 26:46.480]  own life form represented by the bureaucrats and the guilds and the lobbies that we'll
[26:46.480 --> 26:51.920]  represent and I always told you, that's the telltale sign before they roll out the AI
[26:51.920 --> 26:56.720]  they've created, whether you say it's conscious or not, it clearly doesn't have a spirit,
[26:56.720 --> 27:01.800]  the real AI they have is Google where billions of us every day interface with it into a giant
[27:01.800 --> 27:07.240]  hive mind, that's the only thing that's real in AI and Google admits that, this is not
[27:07.240 --> 27:10.880]  science fiction or hearing, this is in their quarterly reports, it's been declassified
[27:10.880 --> 27:15.000]  by Google for four years, we knew about it when Google was found 17 years ago from our
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.760]  sources inside AT&T and Time Warner who were working with them on creating the new super
[27:19.760 --> 27:24.400]  brain, they believe they've created it, Amazon all of them are in a race to create it and
[27:24.400 --> 27:29.000]  it's meant to make us obsolete so listen, we're aware of their whole plan, beating Hillary
[27:29.000 --> 27:35.040]  Clinton and beating George Soros is only one level of this, the real battle is going to
[27:35.040 --> 27:42.000]  be AI, it's going to be the genetic engineering, it's going to be false realities, false AI,
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.040]  false virtual reality that is so enticing and so alluring where you're a king on your
[27:48.040 --> 27:53.360]  own planet and have the most beautiful women, la la la, versus the real reality where we
[27:53.360 --> 27:57.480]  live here in the third dimension, the real challenge coming is going to be for the very
[27:57.480 --> 28:04.920]  soul and genetics of humanity itself, so Hillary Clinton and George Soros and this crop of
[28:04.920 --> 28:11.920]  old 90 year old globalist, they've already been defeated, but in this test many of us
[28:11.920 --> 28:16.360]  as individuals aren't going to make it, so let's just understand that they believe they
[28:16.360 --> 28:22.480]  can physically and culturally destroy individuals and scare the rest of you into believing that
[28:22.480 --> 28:26.560]  we've been defeated when we've been empowered, it is a great honor to be attacked by these
[28:26.560 --> 28:31.000]  people, it is a great honor to be destroyed by them even though I don't want that physically
[28:31.000 --> 28:36.120]  and my flesh certainly doesn't want it and I'm a selfish person at my lower levels of
[28:36.120 --> 28:41.200]  my awareness and my consciousness, but at my heart, at my core, at my spirit, fearless,
[28:41.200 --> 28:45.760]  loving every minute of it, have never been more alive, have never had greater discernment,
[28:45.760 --> 28:51.000]  but just to understand this, just as my awakening is accelerating, so is your awakening and
[28:51.000 --> 28:56.080]  the enemy is awakening to what they've actually built and how deceived they were and so a
[28:56.080 --> 29:00.560]  lot of what you're seeing is the panic of the minions of this devilish system, but now
[29:00.560 --> 29:04.400]  realize they weren't going to be the captains of the world government, they were just the
[29:04.400 --> 29:09.760]  fools that were psychotic enough to put their fellow humans in a cage and begin the enslavement
[29:09.760 --> 29:15.880]  of humanity because they were promised greater power by their masters. Now David Knight's
[29:15.880 --> 29:19.840]  with us, I want to bring him in obviously here as I host him to the hour and then turn
[29:19.840 --> 29:25.520]  things over to him. I'm going to probably be on tomorrow via video and we're going
[29:25.520 --> 29:30.760]  to be having some big announcements of not today over the weekend. Quite frankly, I'm
[29:30.760 --> 29:37.480]  not sure I am waiting, waiting on a whole bunch of fronts to be able to bring this information
[29:37.480 --> 29:41.720]  out to you, but this is a critical time for all of humanity on Alex Jones, this is the
[29:41.720 --> 29:49.920]  info or stay with us.
[29:49.920 --> 30:00.360]  We're on the march, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.360 --> 30:05.080]  Well Trump called Buzzfeed a failing pile of garbage yesterday, which will famously
[30:05.080 --> 30:09.600]  go down in history because they are the leakers of the dossier that John McCain supposedly
[30:09.600 --> 30:14.440]  gave to the FBI. Now Buzzfeed, could they be facing legal hot water for publishing this
[30:14.440 --> 30:18.880]  Trump doc? Experts are saying yes, the individual name of the documents may have caused to bring
[30:18.880 --> 30:24.720]  a libel suit against Buzzfeed for publishing this ridiculous piece of fake news. Now we
[30:24.720 --> 30:27.720]  have an article that's up on our website, it aggregated from the Daily Caller and it
[30:27.720 --> 30:31.720]  talks about how Buzzfeed is weathering the quote criticism for publishing a document
[30:31.720 --> 30:36.600]  cache containing unsubstantiated and scandalous allegations about President-elect Trump and
[30:36.600 --> 30:41.960]  his confidants. Now this could mean serious legal consequences for the quote news organization
[30:41.960 --> 30:46.040]  and they went ahead and decided to publish the 35 page dossier claiming that Russian
[30:46.040 --> 30:51.480]  operatives had compromised personal information about President-elect Trump and they're insinuating
[30:51.480 --> 30:56.320]  that the information is sexual in nature. A really Buzzfeed looks like you're going
[30:56.320 --> 31:03.320]  down. I'm Margaret Hall reporting for infowords.com.
[31:56.320 --> 32:09.600]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able
[32:09.600 --> 32:15.960]  to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from Mustard Seed Extract. When
[32:15.960 --> 32:20.400]  you take selenium in the body it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[32:20.400 --> 32:26.640]  body. It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify. Selenium is another one
[32:26.640 --> 32:30.800]  of those absolute must-haves. The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid
[32:30.800 --> 32:35.440]  gland but it's actually used all over the body. As a matter of fact there's 25 genes
[32:35.440 --> 32:42.840]  in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium so it really is a all around nutrient
[32:42.840 --> 32:48.680]  that everybody really needs. I'm taking it now every day. This is soaking. Biotruel selenium
[32:48.680 --> 32:52.280]  is the product, the best selenium that we could bring. We believe it's the best out
[32:52.280 --> 32:56.920]  there at a very very low price. Excusably available at infowords.com or by calling toll free
[32:56.920 --> 33:12.960]  triple eight two five three three one three nine. The Alex Jones show because there is
[33:12.960 --> 33:21.600]  a war on for your mind. Well we knew we could do it. We knew the American people were good
[33:21.600 --> 33:28.320]  people who loved freedom and who remembered when made the nation great which was the greatest
[33:28.320 --> 33:33.720]  ideas humanity ever developed. The ideas developed in the Bible and then merged with Anglo-Saxon
[33:33.720 --> 33:40.960]  common law. We are a Judeo-Christian nation. I've heard a lot of white supremacist people
[33:40.960 --> 33:47.080]  say they hate that term Judeo-Christian and I'm sorry I researched history, I researched
[33:47.080 --> 33:52.840]  the Bible. Whether you love Jews or hate Jews, Jews are a mixed group like any other group.
[33:52.840 --> 33:58.320]  We are a Judeo-Christian nation. That's where it comes from. The whole thing, the Abrahamic
[33:58.320 --> 34:04.280]  religions are Judeo, Judah, tribe of Judah. I don't know why I just went off on that
[34:04.280 --> 34:09.640]  jag but it's just semantically I'm so tired of being historically informed and watching
[34:09.640 --> 34:14.840]  all the complete abject ignorance out there. But the point is is that our Anglo-Saxon common
[34:14.840 --> 34:20.040]  law which fit quite nicely was actually very, very similar to Judaic law and then Roman
[34:20.040 --> 34:24.720]  law has been mixed into it as well. That's more the global mercantile system. These three
[34:24.720 --> 34:32.040]  systems of law were basically codified into our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, our
[34:32.040 --> 34:38.840]  Declaration of Independence in reverse order and it's a beautiful thing and it's the newest
[34:38.840 --> 34:46.080]  best thing. It's the Trump card against tyranny. They always say, oh, that's a 250-something-year-old
[34:46.080 --> 34:53.800]  document from 1776 written by Thomas Jefferson. I mean, that's old. We need this new globalism.
[34:53.800 --> 35:00.520]  We need some big computer to decide how we live and what we do. The CNN and the New York
[35:00.520 --> 35:07.160]  Times said so. Meanwhile, that's the technocracy they want. That's the technocracy Bloomberg
[35:07.160 --> 35:11.800]  admits that he wants to put in place. He's a technocrat. He's a king technocrat to control
[35:11.800 --> 35:17.960]  every facet of our lives. Guess what Bloomberg's done in just a decade? His 10 billion has gone
[35:17.960 --> 35:25.560]  to 50-something billion. Just off technocracy, just off quote, information and he gets information
[35:25.560 --> 35:30.240]  that you allow him to get that he aggregates from the big internet giants and then he sells
[35:30.240 --> 35:36.160]  it back to them with his algorithms that are basically proprietary from the government
[35:36.160 --> 35:39.960]  and then he controls our lives. How do you like that? How do you like high frequency
[35:39.960 --> 35:44.280]  trading where they make billions a day ripping you off and scamming the whole stock market
[35:44.280 --> 35:49.840]  or rigging the currency rates or rigging the interest rates? Everything our guest would
[35:49.840 --> 35:55.440]  come on 20 years ago. I'd have lawyers on and people wouldn't believe them when they
[35:55.440 --> 36:01.600]  were breaking down mirrors. Now, most of the mortgages have been sold 3, 4, 5, 10, 15,
[36:01.600 --> 36:06.600]  20 times and that was all a scam and how they were putting debt against your birth certificate
[36:06.600 --> 36:13.640]  and how they created 100 plus trillion, now it's several thousand trillion in fake derivatives.
[36:13.640 --> 36:19.320]  All of it was true. All of it was true. And I, 20 years ago, would roll my eyes at it
[36:19.320 --> 36:23.560]  and couldn't believe it even though lawyers and others were bringing me the documents.
[36:23.560 --> 36:29.360]  And that's what I'm saying is it's such a tiny elite of globalists at the top. And
[36:29.360 --> 36:36.200]  the news I want to give you is I cannot stress enough to you the fact that I have studied
[36:36.200 --> 36:39.480]  so much history and I'm not bragging when I say that. I'm just saying this isn't my
[36:39.480 --> 36:44.400]  opinion. I'm not your efforts cat. I'm not just here saying this to be dramatic. When
[36:44.400 --> 36:48.800]  I said over a month ago, you can Google it. I got picked up by newspapers. I'm proud of
[36:48.800 --> 36:54.200]  the fact they attacked me. They said, look at Alex Jones. He claims that the CIA has
[36:54.200 --> 37:00.000]  activated COG, uh, saying that Trump's a Russian agent and maybe preparing to overthrow
[37:00.000 --> 37:06.600]  his presidency. They're calling for it in the news now. They built up to this point.
[37:06.600 --> 37:11.320]  They're selling the idea. They're getting Congress lined up. They're getting the media
[37:11.320 --> 37:15.640]  lined up. They're intimidating people in the press saying you won't have a future anyways
[37:15.640 --> 37:21.440]  if Trump gets in. You've got to stop it. Trump is such an incredible champion. I'll just
[37:21.440 --> 37:27.920]  say this to kiss his rear end. It's amazing how good he is. I was, you know, had a little
[37:27.920 --> 37:33.240]  bit of concern about my support. My gut told me he was good. We first announced two years
[37:33.240 --> 37:39.320]  ago. I've been basically backing him from the very start, but now it's so proven as
[37:39.320 --> 37:43.680]  the hundreds of billions come back in jobs and as he prepares to control the border and
[37:43.680 --> 37:49.360]  as he's about to this week have the Senate and then House repeal Obamacare, something
[37:49.360 --> 37:55.280]  they said was impossible that we'd never reverse. That was them trying to break our will, folks.
[37:55.280 --> 38:00.200]  No, they're the ones that are broken. So let me tell them something. You go ahead and you
[38:00.200 --> 38:03.960]  kill Trump or you go ahead and kill his supporters. You go ahead and start a false flag. You go
[38:03.960 --> 38:07.280]  ahead and indict him. You go ahead and make something up. You go ahead and have false
[38:07.280 --> 38:11.320]  witnesses come forward. This is for the whole empire, folks is why they're doing this. I
[38:11.320 --> 38:16.400]  mean, they're, we're in the middle of a war right now. But just like Trump beautifully
[38:16.400 --> 38:23.240]  said yesterday, do you really understand what you did with Obamacare? That if it's $2,000,
[38:23.240 --> 38:30.840]  $3,000 fines in 2016, in 2017, it goes up to $5,000 fines on employers alone, multi-thousand
[38:30.840 --> 38:36.920]  dollar fines on individuals. The premiums are ballooning. It's going up on average 17%
[38:36.920 --> 38:42.200]  a year. Some people, it's doubled and tripled like my parents who were good and never used
[38:42.200 --> 38:47.000]  their insurance and paid for it for 30 plus years. And then now it's been doubled and then
[38:47.000 --> 38:53.640]  tripled. I mean, this is insane. These two Democrats, I'm doing you a favor. I could
[38:53.640 --> 38:58.800]  let this sit there and not ram this through and then let it hurt people even worse and
[38:58.800 --> 39:03.040]  hurt our economy worse and you'd be destroyed in the next election. But he said, I'm not
[39:03.040 --> 39:07.480]  doing that to destroy you. I'm going to try to save this country and save Americans money.
[39:07.480 --> 39:12.840]  I'm going to do my job and not stoop to politics. And that's why they're so scared, folks.
[39:12.840 --> 39:17.920]  They've artificially jacked the economy and picked the winners and losers and it all ends
[39:17.920 --> 39:22.960]  with Trump. Look at what humans build. Look at what we do. You turn us loose. We will
[39:22.960 --> 39:27.640]  innovate the planet. We will innovate the third world. We will empower everybody who
[39:27.640 --> 39:32.760]  wants to work and who has a good attitude. And the spirit of having ingenuity and Americanism,
[39:32.760 --> 39:38.600]  you can feel it, can't you? You can feel it, can't you? Trump can feel it. You can feel
[39:38.600 --> 39:44.200]  that spirit. You can feel what the enemy howls and anger at because they want to be the only
[39:44.200 --> 39:49.200]  ones with a spark of creativity. They want to be the only ones deciding what to build
[39:49.200 --> 39:52.360]  and what to do. They don't want you to be able to chop down a tree in your backyard
[39:52.360 --> 39:57.680]  or fix your garage or open an ice cream shop or a wine shop. They don't want you to put
[39:57.680 --> 40:01.880]  a windmill up in your backyard or a solar panel unless they say, unless it's jacked
[40:01.880 --> 40:07.320]  into their system, their control freaks because they're nobodies. And the return of real men
[40:07.320 --> 40:13.640]  and real women with the largesse and the gravitas to build cornucopious of human empowerment
[40:13.640 --> 40:19.760]  is here. It's knocking up the door. We open the door. Trump's coming in and the vampires
[40:19.760 --> 40:27.000]  are having conniption fits. Conniption fits as the light just pours in. And here's the
[40:27.000 --> 40:35.240]  danger. With eight days left, you see, as I told you, I'm not flat, I'm right. Exponential
[40:35.240 --> 40:41.800]  acceleration, exponential arrogance, exponential lies. That will bring David Knight in here
[40:41.800 --> 40:44.760]  and then I'm going to finish up in a moment. But David, is it not incredible to you, you're
[40:44.760 --> 40:48.800]  about to host the rest of the show, is it not incredible to you that here we are, yes,
[40:48.800 --> 40:52.440]  they're going, look at this. They admit it's fake. They admit, you know, this Cohen guy
[40:52.440 --> 40:55.800]  they say was in Russia, was never even there. They can't even get the names right in this
[40:55.800 --> 41:00.160]  fake dossier. It was clearly just created off internet information and it fell in the
[41:00.160 --> 41:04.680]  blank lies put in. We've known about it again. I mean, I saw this thing when I was early
[41:04.680 --> 41:09.040]  on supporting Trump like 16 months ago, people are like, you better watch it. He's getting
[41:09.040 --> 41:15.440]  peed on by hookers. And when he was over there in 2013, I was like, this is on 4chan. This
[41:15.440 --> 41:19.680]  thing's got spelling mistakes in it on purpose, okay? Because trolls always give you a chance
[41:19.680 --> 41:23.560]  to know you're being, you're being duped. I said, this is crap. I said, this is such
[41:23.560 --> 41:27.400]  crap. It's probably put out by a Trump supporter, hoping Democrats pick it up. Now, I don't
[41:27.400 --> 41:31.520]  know what really happened with it, but here's the bottom line, David. They're running with
[41:31.520 --> 41:38.480]  it even more arrogantly now on CNN and MSNBC, now saying it's real. At first when it came
[41:38.480 --> 41:41.960]  out that it was totally fake, they had to admit, okay, we screwed up. They don't care
[41:41.960 --> 41:45.960]  now, David. What does that tell you that the New York Times, and I want to say one thing
[41:45.960 --> 41:52.000]  is Trump, man, next time I talk to him, I want to tell him this, sir, I know you don't want
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.040]  to make the New York Times be nice. I know you live in New York. I know it's important
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.440]  to you. I know you grew up with it being numero uno. In Forrest has more traffic than it
[41:59.440 --> 42:03.560]  does, sir. You're not going to win him over just because you had a meeting with Slim.
[42:03.560 --> 42:07.640]  They're not going to stop. For every nice article they write, they write 15. They called
[42:07.640 --> 42:13.480]  him yesterday, the Manchurian candidate in a huge front page story. Let's pull it up.
[42:13.480 --> 42:19.120]  Just type in Manchurian candidate, click news. And they said he's a Soviet agent. Now, I
[42:19.120 --> 42:23.840]  told you, that's the criminal elements of the CIA. And when they said he's a Manchurian
[42:23.840 --> 42:28.360]  candidate, they're getting ready to green light, road groups are arresting him or killing
[42:28.360 --> 42:32.400]  him. Okay, believe me, the stuff going on behind the scenes, folks, the things they've
[42:32.400 --> 42:37.920]  activated, the crap they're pulling is, by the way, a two-way street. And they know that.
[42:37.920 --> 42:43.800]  They are out of their minds. They're losing, but in their death rattle, they're trying
[42:43.800 --> 42:48.080]  to pull us down like a giant squid trying to pull down a sperm whale. David Knight,
[42:48.080 --> 42:49.640]  what do you make of this?
[42:49.640 --> 42:54.240]  We know, Alex, I thought it was kind of interesting. Pierce Morgan, who was on The Apprentice,
[42:54.240 --> 42:57.880]  was one of the winners on The Apprentice. Not a friend of ours, but he knows Donald
[42:57.880 --> 43:02.200]  Trump personally. And I thought he put it perfectly. He said, the only hookers in this
[43:02.200 --> 43:08.080]  story are the cheap, lazy journalists who run with fake Trump sleaze so they can urinate
[43:08.080 --> 43:11.680]  on his presidency. I think that just basically lays the whole thing out.
[43:11.680 --> 43:14.760]  Well, that's what I said yesterday. I said they're literally peeing on the truth.
[43:14.760 --> 43:19.960]  Yeah, and they're literally prostitutes. They're literally prostitutes. And of course, it was
[43:19.960 --> 43:25.440]  just a couple of weeks ago that we saw that Snopes, the people who have been chosen by
[43:25.440 --> 43:32.480]  Facebook and others to be the arbiters of real truth, they have their own problems with
[43:32.480 --> 43:39.560]  prostitutes. They have SNM mistress that's doing their stories there. And of course,
[43:39.560 --> 43:44.040]  all the dirt that came up with them, I mean, they're the real prostitute media.
[43:44.040 --> 43:49.280]  And so what happens is they project their perverted lifestyle, their vulgar, disgusting
[43:49.280 --> 43:54.360]  lifestyle on other people. They speak to people's confirmation bias that follow them. And that's
[43:54.360 --> 43:57.880]  really what's going on here. But that's just the surface. As you pointed out, what's beneath
[43:57.880 --> 44:02.240]  us all is the war of the elites. And of course, there's a lot of people now who are speaking
[44:02.240 --> 44:07.640]  out about that across the political spectrum. We got Glenn Greenwald, no fan of Donald Trump,
[44:07.640 --> 44:10.320]  saying this is his deep state going to war with Donald Trump.
[44:10.320 --> 44:16.440]  We got German MPs, a former Defense Department spokesman. They're talking about how this
[44:16.440 --> 44:21.060]  is really about the military industrial complex coming after him. So that's really the bottom
[44:21.060 --> 44:22.760]  line of all this.
[44:22.760 --> 44:28.880]  Well, that's it. And again, yes, now Glenn Greenwald says it's the deep state coming
[44:28.880 --> 44:32.800]  after him. Now what he likes says it. Now the German members of government say it. Remember,
[44:32.800 --> 44:36.640]  folks, we told you months and months ago, this is the deep state, the shadow criminal
[44:36.640 --> 44:43.520]  globalist set of hijacked the nation. It isn't about credit. It's about listeners understanding.
[44:43.520 --> 44:47.520]  We told you the UN is going to come out and call for computers to be given rights. But
[44:47.520 --> 44:52.400]  of course, the UN will represent the so-called machines that the globalists create. So their
[44:52.400 --> 44:56.760]  own creations with Trojan horses and backdoors will now have rights where you get sent to
[44:56.760 --> 45:01.920]  prison if you say smash some robot that pulls you over and gives you a ticket. And that's
[45:01.920 --> 45:07.520]  where all this is going. We have their dehumanization program. If we simply wake up to it and say
[45:07.520 --> 45:13.120]  no and call it out, they will fail. The spirit of awakening to this will bring them down.
[45:13.120 --> 45:16.440]  I want to play a clip again. I played this probably five times yesterday, but it's so
[45:16.440 --> 45:21.480]  important of Trump telling CNN, no, you're not real news. I'm not going to let you just
[45:21.480 --> 45:24.880]  butt in here and take over. Here it is.
[45:24.880 --> 45:30.760]  Information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public as far
[45:30.760 --> 45:37.880]  as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it. I think they're going to suffer
[45:37.880 --> 45:43.640]  the consequences. They already are. And as far as CNN going out of their way to build
[45:43.640 --> 45:48.040]  it up. And by the way, we just found out I was coming down Michael Cohn. I was being
[45:48.040 --> 45:52.440]  come Michael Cohn is a very talented lawyer is a good lawyer of my firm, who's just reported
[45:52.440 --> 45:56.480]  that it wasn't this Michael Cohn they were talking about. So all night long, it's Michael
[45:56.480 --> 46:02.080]  Cohn. I said, I want to see your passport. He brings his passport to my office. I say,
[46:02.080 --> 46:06.080]  hey, wait a minute, he didn't leave the country. He wasn't out of the country. They had Michael
[46:06.080 --> 46:11.600]  Cohn of the Trump Organization was in prod. It turned out to be a different Michael Cohn.
[46:11.600 --> 46:16.480]  It's a disgrace what took place. It's a disgrace. And I think they ought to apologize to start
[46:16.480 --> 46:20.480]  with Michael Cohn. Sir, it's your attacking us. Can you give us a question?
[46:20.480 --> 46:23.480]  Go ahead. No, Mr. President elect, go ahead, go ahead.
[46:23.480 --> 46:27.480]  No, not you. Not you. Not you. Can you give us a chance? Your organization is terrible.
[46:27.480 --> 46:31.480]  You are attacking our news organization. Can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir?
[46:31.480 --> 46:35.480]  Go ahead. Sir, can you stay quiet? Mr. President elect, go ahead. Can you stay categorically?
[46:35.480 --> 46:39.480]  Mr. President elect, can you give us a question? Don't be rude. Can you give us a question?
[46:39.480 --> 46:43.480]  Don't be rude. No, I'm not going to give you a question. I'm not going to give you a question.
[46:43.480 --> 46:47.480]  Can you stay categorically? You are fake news, sir.
[46:47.480 --> 46:51.480]  All right. Now I'm going to get out of here in a moment and let David and I take over.
[46:51.480 --> 46:55.480]  Understand, we've always wanted somebody to be a champion of America.
[46:55.480 --> 46:59.480]  Somebody to fight globalism. Somebody to turn the economy back on.
[46:59.480 --> 47:03.480]  Somebody to defend the Second Amendment. Defend religious rights in this country.
[47:03.480 --> 47:07.480]  I've personally talked to Trump about this. He's deeply committed to getting the IRS off the backs of the 501C3s
[47:07.480 --> 47:11.480]  and the churches. You wanted it, folks. You've got it.
[47:11.480 --> 47:15.480]  This is God giving us an imperfect servant
[47:15.480 --> 47:19.480]  just like King David. But I do like him to King David
[47:19.480 --> 47:23.480]  taking down Goliath. Okay? He's taken down
[47:23.480 --> 47:27.480]  Goliath. But next phase, folks, we've got to get behind Trump.
[47:27.480 --> 47:31.480]  And I'm telling you, a whole era of prosperity can come in and we can have
[47:31.480 --> 47:35.480]  Americana spread around the world in the face of globalism that's
[47:35.480 --> 47:39.480]  going to still operate and the whole technocracy. But Trump is just riding
[47:39.480 --> 47:43.480]  a wave of this awakening. But he's a very, very special person, a very, very
[47:43.480 --> 47:47.480]  special person who, believe me, is way
[47:47.480 --> 47:51.480]  smarter than he even looks on air. I mean, just the understanding he's got
[47:51.480 --> 47:55.480]  is an absolute God-send. He's a blessing.
[47:55.480 --> 47:59.480]  I mean, I'm telling you, Trump is absolutely heaven-sent and we need
[47:59.480 --> 48:03.480]  to pray for this man. We need to understand it. And the people in the media that are going along with the attacks
[48:03.480 --> 48:07.480]  on him just because it's seen as fashionable and cool. Look, this is a real war. This is
[48:07.480 --> 48:11.480]  dangerous. You have sided with really evil criminal forces
[48:11.480 --> 48:15.480]  that are very, very wicked. I know a lot of you know that and get off on it. But some
[48:15.480 --> 48:19.480]  of you that media matters and others I know are pretty upset about what you're
[48:19.480 --> 48:23.480]  seeing. I'll just go ahead and announce this. That's why there has been a mole inside media matters.
[48:23.480 --> 48:27.480]  And there's a lot of information that we have and there's a lot of information
[48:27.480 --> 48:31.480]  that we have on other sources. And you know, quite frankly,
[48:31.480 --> 48:35.480]  quite frankly, you know, going back a few months ago with the election
[48:35.480 --> 48:39.480]  I have been basically asked and others have just to not take
[48:39.480 --> 48:43.480]  the clubs completely off hoping that CNN and media matters
[48:43.480 --> 48:47.480]  and everybody else would just stop. They're not going to stop. They're scum.
[48:47.480 --> 48:51.480]  And everybody knows about scum. They don't know when to quit. They don't know when they're whipped.
[48:51.480 --> 48:55.480]  And so here's the deal. Everybody always wanted to fight. I always said
[48:55.480 --> 48:59.480]  hey, I know this is going to end, but if you want to fight you better believe you got one. Well, I met
[48:59.480 --> 49:03.480]  every bit of that. So I love it. You know, I'm sad for people
[49:03.480 --> 49:07.480]  what they're going through. And I'm sad for, you know, some people that
[49:07.480 --> 49:11.480]  you know, may not make it. But the whole point is, is that just the way this is
[49:11.480 --> 49:15.480]  a man's game, isn't it? It's a man's world. I've done a man's job. And you know what?
[49:15.480 --> 49:19.480]  I'm ready to do more jobs. I'm ready to do whatever it takes. So you want to bang heads with me
[49:19.480 --> 49:23.480]  in New World Order? You got it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's go.
[49:23.480 --> 49:27.480]  Oh, guess what? We're already banging heads right now, aren't we? That's right. You're going to get your head
[49:27.480 --> 49:31.480]  bang so hard now. You're going to get your head bang so hard.
[49:31.480 --> 49:35.480]  So hard you ain't ever going to get back up. So
[49:35.480 --> 49:39.480]  discretion is a greater part of valor. Well, you don't have discretion.
[49:39.480 --> 49:43.480]  You don't get it, do you? And you're never going to get the better stuff, better men.
[49:43.480 --> 49:47.480]  You just, you just mark that down. You came from scum.
[49:47.480 --> 49:51.480]  You are scum and you're going to get run over now. And I feel great.
[49:51.480 --> 49:55.480]  Daddy to listeners, because I've obviously been out of town. I thought I'd take some time for the family
[49:55.480 --> 49:59.480]  but I ended up working this whole time. And it worked out to be good that I'm out of town during all this craziness.
[49:59.480 --> 50:03.480]  We have a huge special on our amazing best-selling
[50:03.480 --> 50:07.480]  Neutropic BrainForce. It's got 20% more each bottle. We almost
[50:07.480 --> 50:11.480]  got over a break so David has more time. I need David to keep plugging here, David,
[50:11.480 --> 50:15.480]  because we're not bringing in the capital right now. I know nobody's false. I just haven't been on it.
[50:15.480 --> 50:19.480]  We also have 10% off on DNAForce, the flagship product
[50:19.480 --> 50:23.480]  that's been sold out for months because this isn't a product even
[50:23.480 --> 50:27.480]  our listeners ordered. This is the product that real
[50:27.480 --> 50:31.480]  nutraceutical supplement heads buy because they know it's
[50:31.480 --> 50:35.480]  at least half the price of other similar brands that you get from doctors' offices.
[50:35.480 --> 50:39.480]  It is a prescription, but stuff that has this type of quality product is usually sold by doctors
[50:39.480 --> 50:43.480]  or at health clinics and things. Well, some people sell for five times, six times as much.
[50:43.480 --> 50:47.480]  We have it. The very best BioPQQ, the very best CoQ10,
[50:47.480 --> 50:51.480]  and a bunch of other CoFactors and things that accelerate it in times you up
[50:51.480 --> 50:55.480]  take it and absorb it. With BioTrue, Selenium's back in, but
[50:55.480 --> 50:59.480]  10% off on DNAForce. And this is just an epic battle. It's an epic war
[50:59.480 --> 51:03.480]  and we need your financial support now more than ever, whether it's Hillary for Prison Shirt
[51:03.480 --> 51:07.480]  2017, deport George Soros in the back, whether it's
[51:07.480 --> 51:11.480]  Trump as my president, still a few sizes and that left in red.
[51:11.480 --> 51:15.480]  Whatever the case is, we need your financial support now because history's happening
[51:15.480 --> 51:19.480]  and David, you are so eloquent. You're so amazing when I hear you on air,
[51:19.480 --> 51:23.480]  but you've got the same problem I have. You're too jovial, you're too confident,
[51:23.480 --> 51:27.480]  you're too focused sometimes. I want you to just sit back and realize where you're at right now
[51:27.480 --> 51:31.480]  talking to, let's be conservative. There's probably two million
[51:31.480 --> 51:35.480]  people right now, conservatively watching you and listening to you
[51:35.480 --> 51:39.480]  live. Very conservative number. It's like five million a day.
[51:39.480 --> 51:43.480]  But let's say two million people are tuning in to you right now and you're sitting there
[51:43.480 --> 51:47.480]  talking about all this, dealing with this. We're not just saying
[51:47.480 --> 51:51.480]  there's a civil war. We're not just saying stuff's going on behind the scenes.
[51:51.480 --> 51:55.480]  James Bond movie stuff. When I say that, I mean the stuff I've
[51:55.480 --> 51:59.480]  seen, the things I've witnessed, it's the biggest story
[51:59.480 --> 52:03.480]  in the country right now. I'm not even supposed to say this.
[52:03.480 --> 52:07.480]  I am
[52:07.480 --> 52:11.480]  completely speechless at this point. The government is run by total criminals.
[52:11.480 --> 52:15.480]  Here's the look at the top, but it's full of all these good people
[52:15.480 --> 52:19.480]  that things got so corrupt they finally had to speak out to say something. That's why
[52:19.480 --> 52:23.480]  we're actually winning right now. I'm not kissing their ass. It's true because people in the intelligence
[52:23.480 --> 52:27.480]  agencies leaked the truth, stood up and have basically told Obama to go to hell
[52:27.480 --> 52:31.480]  and they told Obama to go to hell about backing ISIS in Al Qaeda. So all this incredible
[52:31.480 --> 52:35.480]  stuff's happening right now, David. It's such an incredible time to be alive. I'm so honored to know
[52:35.480 --> 52:39.480]  you, my friend. But I just do not real, I don't know the listeners realize
[52:39.480 --> 52:43.480]  the level we're at right now and how insane things are.
[52:43.480 --> 52:47.480]  David. Well, thank you, Alex, for giving me the opportunity to speak here
[52:47.480 --> 52:51.480]  to these people. What we see here going on, as you point out, is
[52:51.480 --> 52:55.480]  like a James Bond movie, where you've got the billionaire with
[52:55.480 --> 52:59.480]  the army and the hollowed out volcano. Quite frankly,
[52:59.480 --> 53:03.480]  the news that we've got here goes beyond what we saw with the Bond
[53:03.480 --> 53:07.480]  films. I mean, as you well know, this is really like the Terminator, what we're seeing
[53:07.480 --> 53:11.480]  happening here. There's been stories on the Drudge Report last couple of days, things that we've been
[53:11.480 --> 53:15.480]  talking about. Talked to Dr. Sharkey a couple of years ago about
[53:15.480 --> 53:19.480]  what he was talking about. It's also jumping in, but you're right. They're building a Terminator system,
[53:19.480 --> 53:23.480]  but just like the final Terminator movie admits, the last one, it's a human brain
[53:23.480 --> 53:27.480]  at the middle of it. It's a eugenics doctor building a robot takeover.
[53:27.480 --> 53:31.480]  They're telling us the plan. David, I'm going to hand over to you. I love you. I appreciate your work.
[53:31.480 --> 53:35.480]  Teddum and Edamard, folks, this is huge. I'll be calling in later. Thank you, Alex.
[53:35.480 --> 53:39.480]  And of course, there's the Drudge Report. You see the eye from
[53:39.480 --> 53:43.480]  2001 Space Odyssey, Hal there. And as I look at this, we look at all these
[53:43.480 --> 53:47.480]  different things we talk about on a regular basis, the self-driving
[53:47.480 --> 53:51.480]  cars. Hal there, when you say open the pod door, Hal,
[53:51.480 --> 53:55.480]  or open the car door, Hal, and he says,
[53:55.480 --> 53:59.480]  sorry, Dave, I can't do that. Hal, I don't want to go where you're
[53:59.480 --> 54:03.480]  taking me, Hal. Sorry, Dave. I've got orders from somebody else. What they are
[54:03.480 --> 54:07.480]  building is an infrastructure that is going to
[54:07.480 --> 54:11.480]  treat you as a child. If we look at this story, robot kill switches
[54:11.480 --> 54:15.480]  and legal status, one of the first things they say about this is, my report on
[54:15.480 --> 54:19.480]  robotics adopted today included a debate on tax and social systems
[54:19.480 --> 54:23.480]  and the possible introduction of, listen, a general
[54:23.480 --> 54:27.480]  basic income. See, they want to make you passive.
[54:27.480 --> 54:31.480]  They want to make you fat and dependent.
[54:31.480 --> 54:35.480]  That's the whole point of the general basic income. And it really
[54:35.480 --> 54:39.480]  grieves me to go back and look at people who are advocating this. People like
[54:39.480 --> 54:43.480]  Charles Murray, who is at the heart of efforts to try to reform
[54:43.480 --> 54:47.480]  welfare. He wrote a book back in the 1980s called Losing Ground.
[54:47.480 --> 54:51.480]  And he pointed out that welfare had harmed the people that it was intended
[54:51.480 --> 54:55.480]  to help. He said it's made them more dependent
[54:55.480 --> 54:59.480]  on government. And now this same guy is advocating
[54:59.480 --> 55:03.480]  universal basic income. We saw it brought up for referendum in Sweden this last year.
[55:03.480 --> 55:07.480]  The people there wisely rejected that. In Finland, they're starting
[55:07.480 --> 55:11.480]  an experiment that began the beginning of this year of giving people
[55:11.480 --> 55:15.480]  income for not working. Because they know that they're going to turn the robots
[55:15.480 --> 55:19.480]  in all production over to, they're going to turn it over
[55:19.480 --> 55:23.480]  to robots. They're going to turn it over to artificial intelligence. And they're going to take your jobs.
[55:23.480 --> 55:27.480]  Even the Obama administration is saying we're going to have anywhere
[55:27.480 --> 55:31.480]  from 20 to 50% unemployment across the spectrum.
[55:31.480 --> 55:35.480]  This is every industry. This is everything from blue collar to
[55:35.480 --> 55:39.480]  white collar jobs that they're talking about. We've never seen this kind of displacement
[55:39.480 --> 55:43.480]  before. And so now you've got these people who are trying to keep the system together saying
[55:43.480 --> 55:47.480]  well what we're going to have to do is just turn everybody into welfare recipients. And of course
[55:47.480 --> 55:51.480]  that is just a system of soft kill. And of course you've also talked to Dr.
[55:51.480 --> 55:55.480]  Sharkey in past years. The people who are concerned about autonomous killing robots.
[55:55.480 --> 55:59.480]  We've seen this story earlier in the week about swarms of tiny intelligent
[55:59.480 --> 56:03.480]  micro drones. And as my son Lance said, nothing
[56:03.480 --> 56:07.480]  good ever comes from a swarm. And it is
[56:07.480 --> 56:11.480]  quite frightening to look at this. These are autonomous killing machines
[56:11.480 --> 56:15.480]  that operate in a swarm. And if we go back and look at this, a fighter jet releases
[56:15.480 --> 56:19.480]  a cloud of tiny flying machines into the skies over California. This is not
[56:19.480 --> 56:23.480]  science fiction folks. This has been done earlier this week with Pentagon
[56:23.480 --> 56:27.480]  tests successfully. The US Air Force unleashed a swarm
[56:27.480 --> 56:31.480]  of tiny killer robots in a test, as they point out, that could change warfare
[56:31.480 --> 56:35.480]  forever because they're autonomous. They say the drones can act autonomously
[56:35.480 --> 56:39.480]  using artificial intelligence. And they can be used, they say, in targeted
[56:39.480 --> 56:43.480]  destinations, of course that's how they're going to be used. And when they go crazy
[56:43.480 --> 56:47.480]  and they wipe out entire towns, or they just keep killing, and they'll say, oh
[56:47.480 --> 56:51.480]  I'm sorry, I'm not really responsible. It was a software error.
[56:51.480 --> 56:55.480]  See, I've worked, I've programmed computers all of my life.
[56:55.480 --> 56:59.480]  And I do not trust them to be autonomous killing machines.
[56:59.480 --> 57:03.480]  I will never trust a computer to take over my transportation completely.
[57:03.480 --> 57:07.480]  And so this is the thing that's very disturbing about it. And they point out
[57:07.480 --> 57:11.480]  that this system, PURTICS, as they refer to these micro drones,
[57:11.480 --> 57:15.480]  are not pre-programmed, synchronized individuals. They are a collective organism
[57:15.480 --> 57:19.480]  sharing one distributed brain for decision making and adapting
[57:19.480 --> 57:23.480]  to each other like swarms in nature.
[57:23.480 --> 57:27.480]  103 drones took part in the test where they demonstrated their collective decision making.
[57:27.480 --> 57:31.480]  Does that scare you? It really should. Every thinking person
[57:31.480 --> 57:35.480]  should be afraid of this type of out of control use
[57:35.480 --> 57:39.480]  in a very industrial complex. And we'll look at this situation about giving legal
[57:39.480 --> 57:43.480]  protection to robots, saying we're going to give them certain specific rights
[57:43.480 --> 57:47.480]  and obligations. Really? How about giving humans some
[57:47.480 --> 57:51.480]  rights and obligations? They've removed all of our rights, and now they're
[57:51.480 --> 57:55.480]  substituting these robots in here. Again, another person I've interviewed before, Hugo
[57:55.480 --> 57:59.480]  DeGaris, a doctor who's worked all of his life on artificial intelligence.
[57:59.480 --> 58:03.480]  He wrote a book. He called it The Art-Elect War. And we talked to him about that.
[58:03.480 --> 58:07.480]  He talks about how society will be
[58:07.480 --> 58:11.480]  a few elites. He calls them the cosmos. He says as people realize
[58:11.480 --> 58:15.480]  where this is headed, the vast majority of people rebel. Now they will
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.480]  stay on Earth. They'll be called the Terrans. But then the cosmos, the people like Jeff Bezos,
[58:19.480 --> 58:23.480]  they will go to near orbit or to Lagrange Libration
[58:23.480 --> 58:27.480]  points. And from there, they will use their superior technology to enforce
[58:27.480 --> 58:31.480]  gigadeth on the population until they come back to a subdued Earth. This is what
[58:31.480 --> 58:35.480]  he sees happening. And yet he is drawn to it to make it happen.
[58:35.480 --> 58:39.480]  Because he says, I'm a scientist. That's the problem. Stay with us and we'll be right back.
[58:39.480 --> 58:43.480]  You are listening to GCN.
[58:43.480 --> 58:47.480]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:47.480 --> 58:51.480]  We're selling a product, DNA Force,
[58:51.480 --> 58:55.480]  that is the very best nutraceutical that we can
[58:55.480 --> 58:59.480]  produce. Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[58:59.480 --> 59:03.480]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's
[59:03.480 --> 59:07.480]  very, very important. What the aging process is, is when the
[59:07.480 --> 59:11.480]  cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[59:11.480 --> 59:15.480]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes. And when it runs out,
[59:15.480 --> 59:19.480]  you start dying. We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different
[59:19.480 --> 59:23.480]  clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world.

[1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:21.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight.
[1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:25.480]  We're going to be joined in the next hour by Lionel. I'm sure he's going to have a lot of
[1:00:25.480 --> 1:00:29.480]  interesting things to say about the crazy developments that have happened the last
[1:00:29.480 --> 1:00:33.480]  day or so. And in the third hour, we're going to be joined by Mark Morano
[1:00:33.480 --> 1:00:37.480]  of Climate Depot. And there's a lot of news
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:41.480]  that is coming out. Of course the EPA has moved
[1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:45.480]  in another massive power grab. Today we have an article by Kit Daniels. EPA is accusing
[1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:49.480]  Fiat Kreiser of VW-style emissions
[1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:53.480]  cheating. Quote-unquote emissions cheating. Do you remember one of the first stories
[1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:57.480]  I covered when I came here to InfoWars was the emissions cheating
[1:00:57.480 --> 1:01:01.480]  of the EPA itself. They were doing tests on
[1:01:01.480 --> 1:01:05.480]  human beings. They had Lisa Jackson going before Congress
[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:09.480]  working out a little script within Congressman Ed Markey. He's now Senator.
[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:13.480]  They had a little script and of course he read some of her lines for her
[1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:17.480]  by mistake because they're not very good actors. And she eventually was taken out of the
[1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:21.480]  EPA with her own email scandal. But Lisa Jackson was lying to the American people
[1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:25.480]  and she was saying that there were more
[1:01:25.480 --> 1:01:29.480]  deaths from fine particulate matter. That's what they call
[1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:33.480]  diesel fuel. Fine particulate matter. There were more deaths from that than there were
[1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:37.480]  from cancer. A patent lie. And yet at the same time
[1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:41.480]  she was selling that lie. We had the EPA in my hometown
[1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:45.480]  where UNC, University of North Carolina was. The EPA was
[1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:49.480]  hooking up people that they had selectively screened for respiratory and heart issues
[1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:53.480]  hooking them up directly to diesel exhaust fumes trying
[1:01:53.480 --> 1:01:57.480]  to get them sick so they could increase the regulation. So here they are
[1:01:57.480 --> 1:02:01.480]  coming after yet another car company because diesel
[1:02:01.480 --> 1:02:05.480]  engines. Why do they hate diesel engines? Because they're cheap, they're
[1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:09.480]  efficient, they're here today and their competition for the battery-driven
[1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:13.480]  cars where the technology is really not there right now. They want to push that
[1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:17.480]  against us because it's all part of their control grid. And
[1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:21.480]  we've talked about that before. We're going to talk about that in a little bit more detail. And of course we're going to talk about
[1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:25.480]  the EPA in general. Climate change in general.
[1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:29.480]  And of course Rex Tillerson was just
[1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:33.480]  had his confirmation hearings. He had some things to say about that as well.
[1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:37.480]  Before I get back into the robot issue, I don't want to cover
[1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:41.480]  that in this segment. I want to get back to it in the next segment because there's a little bit more there
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:45.480]  to talk about. But today we see that they have taken the first
[1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:49.480]  steps towards dismantling Obamacare. I think it's interesting
[1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:53.480]  to go back and look at Obama's legacy because when we talk about the
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:57.480]  Global Salute and when we talk about Obamacare, understand that Obamacare was
[1:02:57.480 --> 1:03:01.480]  really a massive subsidy to the insurance companies
[1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:05.480]  to the bankers. The people who have prospered under
[1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:09.480]  Obama as the rest of us have been cut off. And we're going to see that trend accelerate
[1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:13.480]  unless we reverse that kind of globalism, that kind of crony capitalism.
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:17.480]  And this report from RT, they did an interview with a couple of people
[1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:21.480]  they say under Obama family median income dropped and the Democrat
[1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:25.480]  party imploded. See it's cause and effect. They point out the wealthy
[1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:29.480]  recovered from the recession in 2008 very dramatically.
[1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:33.480]  They said 97% of all net income gains since 2008
[1:03:33.480 --> 1:03:37.480]  have gone to the wealthiest 1%. See that? The wealthiest 1%
[1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:41.480]  get 97% of the gain. They had a recovery
[1:03:41.480 --> 1:03:45.480]  the rest of us didn't. Households at the same time in the middle class
[1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:49.480]  the median family income has continued to decline every year
[1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:53.480]  in real terms. And you know that. And so what is the result of that? The result of that
[1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:57.480]  is that the Democrat party has the lowest control of state
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:01.480]  legislatures they've ever had. The head of the Democrat party points out
[1:04:01.480 --> 1:04:05.480]  they've imploded roughly two thirds of all the state legislatures and the
[1:04:05.480 --> 1:04:09.480]  governorships are now in the hands of Republicans. They've lost over 1,000 elected seats
[1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:13.480]  under Obama in eight years. And of course he's given us a domestic
[1:04:13.480 --> 1:04:17.480]  war. He created a domestic war between black lives matter and the police
[1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:21.480]  between black lives matter and white people. And he even created a war between
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:25.480]  blacks and blacks in Chicago. We point this out as
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:29.480]  it's amazing irony to me. Or Hutzpah, maybe it's Hutzpah
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:33.480]  I guess, that he would go back to his hometown in Chicago where
[1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:37.480]  about 4,000 people died. About the same number of people died in the
[1:04:37.480 --> 1:04:41.480]  eight years of Chicago or Obama in Chicago
[1:04:41.480 --> 1:04:45.480]  that died under George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan. About the same number
[1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:49.480]  about 4,000 people. That's the war that he brought even between black people
[1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:53.480]  and black people in Chicago where it's a gun-free zone. Stay with us
[1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:59.480]  and we'll be right back.
[1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:27.480]  If someone takes it to the intelligence agencies, you would think it would be private.
[1:05:27.480 --> 1:05:31.480]  And really, this is so important that I think whoever leaked it should be
[1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:35.480]  prosecuted. He told this to Neil Cavuto of Fox News saying someone should go to jail.
[1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:39.480]  If this was an intelligence agency heard talked, the media, they should
[1:05:39.480 --> 1:05:43.480]  go to jail. Well you know what Senator, I couldn't agree with you more. Frankly,
[1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:47.480]  we understand that it's a steaming pile of garbage. For those that may not,
[1:05:47.480 --> 1:05:51.480]  this is still information that is pertaining to a public figure that's quote
[1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:55.480]  block-mail-em. So somebody should be held responsible and I couldn't agree with
[1:05:55.480 --> 1:06:21.480]  you more. I'm Margaret Howell reporting for Infowars.com.
[1:06:25.480 --> 1:06:29.480]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[1:06:55.480 --> 1:06:59.480]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:29.480]  Thank you for joining us today.
[1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:59.480]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:15.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:08:15.480 --> 1:08:19.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight. I'm going to continue
[1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:23.480]  with what I was talking about at the beginning of the end of the last hour.
[1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:27.480]  Because this is the big picture, folks. The fact that we have
[1:08:27.480 --> 1:08:31.480]  what is turning into a mixture of the brave new world, 1984
[1:08:31.480 --> 1:08:35.480]  and iRobot. Think of it that way. If you don't want to go back and look at
[1:08:35.480 --> 1:08:39.480]  Agenda 21 and the U.N. Agenda for Sustainability,
[1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:45.480]  2030, okay? That's there. Boring. You read that, that'll put you to death. The details on that, okay?
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:49.480]  But if you want to think about it in big terms, this is what we're seeing here is a confluence
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:53.480]  of that. And when I talk about these stories here, the swarms of drones, the
[1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:57.480]  autonomous killing machines that are being developed by the military industrial complex that we've been warned about,
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:01.480]  that we've now seen go out of control. They're the ones who are behind the attacks on
[1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:05.480]  Donald Trump. They're the ones who are behind the attacks on Donald Trump.
[1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:09.480]  And we're going to talk about that in just a moment. But let's talk about
[1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:13.480]  what is really at the confluence of all this.
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:17.480]  And we talk about the swarms of killer drones. We talk about the
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:21.480]  robots that they're now saying. We need to give them legal protection and status.
[1:09:21.480 --> 1:09:25.480]  And then they start talking about babies made without mothers, okay?
[1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:29.480]  We've been mocked about talking about how they're going to
[1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:33.480]  genetically engineer babies without people. Oh, that's science fiction. That's
[1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:37.480]  brave New World. It's like, exactly. Exactly.
[1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:41.480]  Aldous Huxley, one of the brain
[1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:45.480]  children of the globalist establishment was talking about that.
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:49.480]  And that's quite frankly what is happening here. The vast majority of Americans
[1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:53.480]  are duped into passivity by
[1:09:53.480 --> 1:09:57.480]  entertainment. And they are the ones that you see
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:10:01.480]  exactly as they did in Brave New World. And what they're doing is they're moving to have a system
[1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:05.480]  where they can engineer children. Why is it that they're doing that? They want to create
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:09.480]  superhumans and subhumans. They will be the superhumans.
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:13.480]  And then they will create a subservient subhuman race. So as we look
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:17.480]  at this AI situation, yes, there is an issue there that we need to be
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:21.480]  careful about. We need to be careful about turning this stuff over to
[1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:25.480]  computers. They call anything that is smart AI.
[1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:29.480]  And that's part of the bluff that they're doing. For the longest time
[1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:33.480]  back in the day when you first had computers, if you had a printout from a computer
[1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:37.480]  and you said, look, I've got a model and I've got a printout here. It's like, go bow down
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:41.480]  and worship that. Douglas Adams made fun of that Hitchhiker's
[1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:45.480]  Guide to the Galaxy where they had this giant computer crunching for decades to
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:49.480]  determine the meaning of life. And when it came out, the answer was 42. It's like, oh,
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:53.480]  I'm not sure what that is. And that's what we saw. Here's your
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:57.480]  printout. Well, garbage in, garbage out, folks. If you've got a bad model
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:01.480]  and I don't care how big your computer is, how long it took, it's going to spit out
[1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:05.480]  some garbage. And so this whole
[1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:09.480]  elevating computers to a position of authority over our lives is really
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:13.480]  what's behind a lot of this artificial intelligence. It really
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:17.480]  is an artifice, really, set up to try to
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:21.480]  deceive you, to try to make you stand in awe of what they're doing.
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:25.480]  And quite frankly, I've worked with computers too long to be in awe of this. I'm
[1:11:25.480 --> 1:11:29.480]  quite frankly getting very angry about it. I'm angry about the way the military
[1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:33.480]  industrial complex is moving with these swarms of drones moving to
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:37.480]  replace us in our work and saying, well, we'll put you on a welfare system,
[1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:41.480]  universal basic income. And then saying, we're going to even take away your reproductive
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:45.480]  rights because there's too many of you. That makes you dangerous to us. That's what they did.
[1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:49.480]  That was the essence of Brave New World. That was the way they pacified people.
[1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:53.480]  The government took over reproduction. The government decided how they were going
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:57.480]  to have where they're going to have subhumans or superhumans.
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:01.480]  And when we look at this report, this up on the Drudge Report, the Daily Mail, babies
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:05.480]  made without mothers will come sooner than we think. They point out last year
[1:12:05.480 --> 1:12:09.480]  at the University of Bath, they discovered that they could use sperm and skin cells.
[1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:13.480]  Or any other kind of non-egg cell would be all that they needed for conception.
[1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:17.480]  I said, well, okay, it's still a ways off. Now we've got a report that's published today
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:21.480]  top embryologists at Harvard and Brown University's urging nations
[1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:25.480]  to begin contemplating the legal minefield that would surround motherless babies.
[1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:29.480]  Who are they going to be owned by? They'll be owned by the state.
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:33.480]  You see, the state has been taking control of your children gradually.
[1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:37.480]  They called the government school system for the longest time. You take your child
[1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:41.480]  to the government school system and they can do anything they want in that government school system.
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:45.480]  And if you didn't like what they were telling your kids because they were introducing
[1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:49.480]  sexual issues to them at a very young age, I mean, this is back when it was still
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:53.480]  heterosexual issues. And there was a father in Massachusetts.
[1:12:53.480 --> 1:12:57.480]  I remember 25, 30 years ago, he went there and he said, I don't really want you talking
[1:12:57.480 --> 1:13:01.480]  to my child about sex. And it wasn't even the weird
[1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:05.480]  stuff they're doing today. I mean, it was ordinary heterosexual sex. And they said,
[1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:09.480]  sorry, you don't have any say about this. And he got upset. They arrested him.
[1:13:09.480 --> 1:13:13.480]  And he said, I want to get my child out of this. And they said, no,
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:17.480]  you can't do that. Once you take your child to the school and you drop him off, there's a doctrine
[1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:21.480]  called enloco parentis in place of the parents. We
[1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:25.480]  are the parents. Once you have surrendered, and this is what the judge said, literally
[1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:29.480]  said this, you have surrendered your child to the state.
[1:13:29.480 --> 1:13:33.480]  And so they have been pushing this to an earlier and earlier
[1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:37.480]  stage. And everyone since Aristotle has known that you get children at an early stage,
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:41.480]  they become yours for life. And so they've been trying to take over your children. But now
[1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:45.480]  they will go to the point where you only have any claims over these children
[1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:49.480]  because they will manufacture them. And so when you look at this in the near term,
[1:13:49.480 --> 1:13:53.480]  yes, there are issues that come about with this. And Hugo de Gares has talked
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:57.480]  about this as I pointed out, the art of like war. It was actually a war between the elites
[1:13:57.480 --> 1:14:01.480]  and the rest of us, a technological war between us using artificial
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:05.480]  intelligence. But he said, you get true artificial intelligence. You're not going to be able
[1:14:05.480 --> 1:14:09.480]  to tell it. Do not harm humanity. Do not allow
[1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:13.480]  any harm to come to humans by action or inaction. So once
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:17.480]  they get to that point, you're not going to really be able to boss them around.
[1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:21.480]  And they also want to have something that really has that human touch. So in my
[1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:25.480]  personal opinion, I think, again, we can always talk about is it going to be
[1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:29.480]  robots or is it going to be a brave new world situation? Is it going to be 1984?
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:33.480]  Or is it going to be a brave new world? Are we going to get the boot in the face? Yes, some of us will.
[1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:37.480]  The rest of us, they'll pacify with hedonism,
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:41.480]  with passivity, with the universal basic income. That's the way it's going to work out. And when we
[1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:45.480]  look at this, I believe that the robots are going
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:49.480]  to be the subhumans that they're going to manufacture. Remember that the term robot
[1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:53.480]  that was first used into play was, I believe, is a check word
[1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:57.480]  for slave. They're simply looking for slaves.
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:15:01.480]  They simply want to make all of us slaves. That is the ultimate
[1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:05.480]  end goal of the elite of the military industrial
[1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:09.480]  complex of these people that we were warned about by
[1:15:09.480 --> 1:15:13.480]  Eisenhower. Let's go back to this war that we're seeing
[1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:17.480]  now, that is the one that's right in front of our face, that the New York Times
[1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:21.480]  talks about the war with the media and within the media.
[1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:25.480]  Let's say Donald Trump's news session starts, news
[1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:29.480]  session, his press conference yesterday, starts a war with and within the media.
[1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:33.480]  Well, is that a, it's a fake war, isn't it? As I point out,
[1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:37.480]  Pierce Morgan said, the only prostitutes in any of this are the journalists
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:41.480]  themselves. And we have RT coming in and saying
[1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:45.480]  they have an interview with a former German MP who is also
[1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:49.480]  the former defense spokesman for Angela Merkel's party.
[1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:53.480]  He said, when you see the situation in Washington, I think they're not willing, those who lost
[1:15:53.480 --> 1:15:57.480]  the election to accept the new president, whose name is Trump. What's going on in Washington
[1:15:57.480 --> 1:16:01.480]  sounds like the beginning of a civil war.
[1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:05.480]  Yes, exactly. He said there is a network of resistance against
[1:16:05.480 --> 1:16:09.480]  the president who will be in office on the 20th of January. And I think when you
[1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:13.480]  look at the reality in Europe, people of all of our European countries
[1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:17.480]  want to live in good relations with the Russian Federation.
[1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:21.480]  Of course they do. They don't want war. It's the people at the top that want war.
[1:16:21.480 --> 1:16:25.480]  So we look at this and we say, well, there's a war with the media and there's a war within the media.
[1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:29.480]  That's kind of like saying, well, if you guys could all get along, there wouldn't be a fight.
[1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:33.480]  This isn't simply about the media. That's what we see.
[1:16:33.480 --> 1:16:37.480]  And of course they're part of it. They are the foot soldiers of this. But understand
[1:16:37.480 --> 1:16:41.480]  that it's not simply limited to that. It's these people
[1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:45.480]  behind it that we're talking about. The people who are engineering this entire system.
[1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:49.480]  Whether it's the swarms of robots or the manufactured humans
[1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:53.480]  or the AI or the driverless cars or packing you into the
[1:16:53.480 --> 1:16:57.480]  cities with agenda 21. Those are the people who are really directing it.
[1:16:57.480 --> 1:17:01.480]  In the same way, they have a real war. You say, well, if only those soldiers at the front would stop
[1:17:01.480 --> 1:17:05.480]  fighting with each other, we could have peace. No, it's much deeper
[1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:09.480]  than that. It's the people who are pushing them out into the war. He pointed out, he said, there's no
[1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:13.480]  hostility between Russia and Europe. The hostility is organized in a very artificial way.
[1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:17.480]  And it is the same way of organizing hostilities as we see
[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:21.480]  nowadays against Trump. Again, this is the former German defense
[1:17:21.480 --> 1:17:25.480]  spokesman. He says, this makes it very clear there's a network of Democrats
[1:17:25.480 --> 1:17:29.480]  and Republicans in a war establishment in Washington that is not willing
[1:17:29.480 --> 1:17:33.480]  to accept the ballots. He argued that the EU and Moscow
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:37.480]  had had excellent relations before something changed in U.S.
[1:17:37.480 --> 1:17:41.480]  policy. So it was a U.S. that restarted the Cold War.
[1:17:41.480 --> 1:17:45.480]  Absolutely. And then you've got this article here from Glenn Greenwald.
[1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:49.480]  And he points out, the deep state is going to war with the president
[1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:53.480]  elect and using unverified claims. And then he excoriates
[1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:57.480]  Democrats for cheering this. He said, the serious dangers
[1:17:57.480 --> 1:18:01.480]  posed by Trump presidents here numerous and manifest. See, he doesn't agree with Donald Trump.
[1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:05.480]  But he says, there are a wide variety of legitimate and effective
[1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:09.480]  tactics to combat those threats. Look, you can be partisan. You can disagree
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:13.480]  with people. But when you start resorting to censorship, when you start resorting
[1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:17.480]  to the kind of character assassination
[1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:21.480]  and the types of things that we've seen the CIA do in other
[1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:25.480]  countries. Remember, it was our founding fathers, James Mason, who warned us that the tools
[1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:29.480]  that we use to fight wars abroad will come home to haunt us and tyrannies at home.
[1:18:29.480 --> 1:18:33.480]  And that's what we're seeing here now. The CIA that we created
[1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:37.480]  to fight our war's force, to get involved abroad, to
[1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:41.480]  take down these monsters that we were told existed abroad. Now
[1:18:41.480 --> 1:18:45.480]  those monsters have turned on us internally. He says, cheering for the CIA
[1:18:45.480 --> 1:18:49.480]  and its shadowy allies to unilaterally subvert the U.S.
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:53.480]  election and impose its own policy dictates on the elected
[1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:57.480]  president is both warped and self-destructive, empowering
[1:18:57.480 --> 1:19:01.480]  the very entities that have produced the most shameful atrocities and
[1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:05.480]  systemic deceit over the last six decades is the desperation of the worst
[1:19:05.480 --> 1:19:09.480]  kind. This is what the left is doing, says Glenn Greenwald. He says, look, I don't agree
[1:19:09.480 --> 1:19:13.480]  with his policies, but don't do this. You're going to burn our country down doing this.
[1:19:13.480 --> 1:19:17.480]  He said, demanding that evidence-free, anonymous assertions be
[1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:21.480]  instantly venerated as truth. Why? Because the media put this out
[1:19:21.480 --> 1:19:25.480]  there that we're supposed to instantly respect. He said, despite emanating from the very precincts
[1:19:25.480 --> 1:19:29.480]  designed to propagandize and lie, this is an assault on journalism,
[1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:33.480]  on democracy, on basic human rationality, and it casually branding
[1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:37.480]  domestic adversaries who refuse to go along as traitors and disloyal
[1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:41.480]  foreign operatives is bankrupt morally and certain
[1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:45.480]  to backfire on those who are doing it. And this is what it
[1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:49.480]  fundamentally is. It is the CIA that's moving against this. It's John McCain who's
[1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:53.480]  moving against this. We give you credit, John. Good for you, John.
[1:19:53.480 --> 1:19:57.480]  Good for the CIA. We know exactly what you're about. You've been exposed just like
[1:19:57.480 --> 1:20:21.480]  the fake media. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[1:20:27.480 --> 1:20:37.480]  We'll be right back.
[1:20:57.480 --> 1:21:23.480]  We'll be right back.
[1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:33.480]  We'll be right back.

[1:22:35.480 --> 1:22:41.480]  for years and I thought it would be that way for the rest of my life. Three weeks on one-world-way
[1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:47.480]  set me on a new path. That was five months ago and I haven't been irregular since. Will it work the same way for you?

[1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:19.480]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. We're going to be joined by Lionel in the next segment,
[1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:25.480]  and I'm sure he's going to have a lot of interesting things to say about what happened with the press conference yesterday,
[1:24:25.480 --> 1:24:29.480]  but of course, the bigger picture, and we're going to play you in just a second here, a clip.
[1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:33.480]  Democrats vowing to stall Trump's cabinet picks. They're going to do anything they can to stop him.
[1:24:33.480 --> 1:24:38.480]  We've had Chuck E. Schumer come out and say, I'm going to vote against the first guy he puts up for Supreme Court.
[1:24:38.480 --> 1:24:43.480]  You don't know who it is. He's just going to vote against it just to vote against it.
[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:50.480]  That's the kind of opposition that they say, oh, you can't, you're obstructionist when you don't do what we want to do
[1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:55.480]  when the Democrats are in power, but of course, that's what he's going to do, pure obstructionism.
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:25:00.480]  Yesterday, we were criticized, I was criticized specifically, about, they said,
[1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:03.480]  Profiteering, this is Media Matters, George Soros' organization.
[1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:08.480]  Of course, George Soros gives billions to all of his organizations,
[1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:13.480]  his non-governmental organizations that have created revolutions throughout Europe,
[1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:17.480]  and he's trying to do that here with Black Lives Matter, with people like Media Matters,
[1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:21.480]  and so they accused us of profiteering off of the shooting in Fort Lauderdale.
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:26.480]  We simply said to people, look, you can protect yourself with body armor.
[1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:30.480]  If they're not going to allow you to protect yourself with a gun, at least you can get body armor.
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:36.480]  But these people who you would think, they're all talking about how horrible guns are
[1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:41.480]  and how many people are getting shot in the gun-free zones like Chicago and airports,
[1:25:41.480 --> 1:25:44.480]  and of course, they'd been warned that that was going to happen in airports.
[1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:48.480]  So we say, look, airports, schools, places like Chicago where you can't have guns,
[1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:52.480]  they make it impossible to defend yourself, at least you can have this.
[1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:57.480]  If I had to live in Chicago, I literally would have my kids wearing a bulletproof vest
[1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:00.480]  as they're sitting in the apartment because in many of these areas,
[1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:04.480]  people are shot in their apartments as they're sitting there watching television.
[1:26:04.480 --> 1:26:07.480]  That's how bad the violence there is in Chicago.
[1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:10.480]  But of course, we were accused of profiteering.
[1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:16.480]  The same way I guess it's profiteering that when we tell people, hey, you need to clean up your water
[1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:19.480]  because there's all kinds of toxic stuff in the water.
[1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:21.480]  Maybe you should filter your water.
[1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:26.480]  Instead, people who didn't filter their water found out after the fact they'd been giving lead to their children.
[1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:30.480]  And then they're going to find out someday, they're going to eventually learn
[1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:34.480]  and realize the effects of fluoride and glyphosate and some of the other things are in the water.
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:37.480]  So we tell you these things, we give you things that are defensive
[1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:40.480]  and that's supposedly profiteering.
[1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:41.480]  No, that's how we fund the operation.
[1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:47.480]  We don't get millions of dollars of subsidies as the major networks do, as NPR does.
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:49.480]  We don't get charitable donations.
[1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:53.480]  What we try to do is we offer you products that are going to protect you,
[1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:56.480]  that are going to help you with your health.
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:26:59.480]  And so in that light, we have put out the body armor.
[1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:03.480]  We've also put out a Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative as this time of year
[1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:06.480]  as people start thinking about their health, thinking about the next year,
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:08.480]  how they're going to do better the next year.
[1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:12.480]  They're going to give themselves more exercise, better nutrition, set up a good base.
[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:15.480]  We've put a lot of our products, our most popular products on sale.
[1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:17.480]  We've got brain force, 30% off.
[1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:19.480]  Supermal vitality, 30% off.
[1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:22.480]  Survival shield, X2 nascent iodine.
[1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:25.480]  They used to put iodine, they used to supplement that into your food.
[1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:28.480]  Now they don't do that as much in the salt.
[1:27:28.480 --> 1:27:32.480]  But this is a great form of iodine, it's something that you need to have there.
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:38.480]  Same thing with vitamin B12, we have 20% off secret 12, 20% off liver shield,
[1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:42.480]  20% off natural sleep aid knockout.
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:46.480]  That's a great way to make sure that you get your baseline of sleep.
[1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:48.480]  That's very essential to your health.
[1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:49.480]  Prostagard, 20% off.
[1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:51.480]  You'll find all those at infowarslife.com.
[1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:54.480]  Also, we've gotten in an emergency shipment of DNA force.
[1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:56.480]  We sold out a DNA force over a month ago.
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:01.480]  It's been out for a while, so we're offering that as 10% off right out of the gates
[1:28:01.480 --> 1:28:03.480]  to help you get stocked back up.
[1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:05.480]  It's very difficult for us to produce this.
[1:28:05.480 --> 1:28:08.480]  It's a difficult and expensive ingredient to get, BiopQQ.
[1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:12.480]  You can find all the clinical studies, look at them online.
[1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:18.480]  There's 175 clinical studies that show how important this supplement is.
[1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:20.480]  Just one batch of the stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:23.480]  So it's very expensive to produce, very difficult to obtain.
[1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:24.480]  That's why we're out of it.
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:29.480]  And a 10% discount on this supplement is something that is very substantial.
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:31.480]  So again, it's now back in stock.
[1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:34.480]  It could be months before we get another shipment of DNA force.
[1:28:34.480 --> 1:28:36.480]  This is just an emergency shipment that we've gotten back in,
[1:28:36.480 --> 1:28:38.480]  so make sure that you move on that.
[1:28:38.480 --> 1:28:41.480]  And if you are not set up for auto-ship, think about that.
[1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:44.480]  That's one thing that keeps you from ever running out of the things
[1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:47.480]  that you have determined you want for your baseline health.
[1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:50.480]  You can sign up for that, get a 10% discount on everything that you sign up for.
[1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:53.480]  And if your recurring order is more than $50,
[1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:55.480]  we'll give you free shipping on that as well,
[1:28:55.480 --> 1:29:00.480]  because that helps us provide our supplies on a regular basis.
[1:29:00.480 --> 1:29:02.480]  Now, I want to play this clip before we go to break
[1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:04.480]  and before we get Lionel come back.
[1:29:04.480 --> 1:29:08.480]  This is Democrats vowing to stall Trump's cabinet picks.
[1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:13.480]  Democrats are vowing to stall action on eight of Trump's picks.
[1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:17.480]  And this type of obstructionism is enormously anti-democratic.
[1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:21.480]  It's important that Justice Department have a senior leadership in place without delay.
[1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:26.480]  I think we owe deference to a president for choices to executive positions.
[1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:31.480]  Republicans have prevented votes on judges, on agency heads,
[1:29:31.480 --> 1:29:34.480]  and on administration secretaries.
[1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:36.480]  This is wrong.
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:40.480]  My idea would be to go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom with them.
[1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:47.480]  We have always had the tradition of moving these nominees as quickly as we possibly could.
[1:29:47.480 --> 1:29:53.480]  As much as some people in this room don't like it, he was elected president of the United States by the American people.
[1:29:53.480 --> 1:29:55.480]  There you go. That's how they're going to help.
[1:29:55.480 --> 1:30:18.480]  We'll be right back with Lionel.
[1:30:25.480 --> 1:30:27.480]  On our website, it aggregated from The Daily Caller,
[1:30:27.480 --> 1:30:32.480]  and it talks about how BuzzFeed is weathering the, quote, criticism for publishing a document cache containing
[1:30:32.480 --> 1:30:37.480]  unsubstantiated and scandalous allegations about President-elect Trump and his confidants.
[1:30:37.480 --> 1:30:41.480]  Now, this could mean serious legal consequences for the, quote, news organization,
[1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:46.480]  and they went ahead and decided to publish the 35-page dossier claiming that Russian operatives
[1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:50.480]  had compromised personal information about President-elect Trump,
[1:30:50.480 --> 1:30:54.480]  and they're insinuating that the information is sexual in nature.
[1:30:54.480 --> 1:30:57.480]  For more information on BuzzFeed, look like you're going down.
[1:30:57.480 --> 1:31:25.480]  We're reporting for Infowars.com.
[1:31:27.480 --> 1:31:50.480]  We'll be right back with more information on BuzzFeed.
[1:31:58.480 --> 1:32:08.480]  National Defense Labs and Citizen Armor has given Infowars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[1:32:08.480 --> 1:32:10.480]  the true next generation in body armor.
[1:32:10.480 --> 1:32:18.480]  Basically what we're bringing to the Infowars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[1:32:18.480 --> 1:32:24.480]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[1:32:24.480 --> 1:32:27.480]  We saw what you talked to people that have been using this actually testing for years,
[1:32:27.480 --> 1:32:29.480]  people that currently have tested for us.
[1:32:29.480 --> 1:32:30.480]  They didn't just say outstanding.
[1:32:30.480 --> 1:32:31.480]  I mean, what they really say about them.
[1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:33.480]  They want to know how do they get it?
[1:32:33.480 --> 1:32:34.480]  Where do they find it?
[1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:37.480]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[1:32:37.480 --> 1:32:41.480]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:42.480]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:43.480]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:44.480]  It's got a 20-year warranty.
[1:32:44.480 --> 1:32:45.480]  It's waterproof.
[1:32:45.480 --> 1:32:46.480]  You can wear it.
[1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:47.480]  It's comfortable.
[1:32:47.480 --> 1:32:48.480]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it.
[1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:50.480]  Again, funding Infowars.
[1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:53.480]  Get the game changing in nanotech tubes.
[1:32:53.480 --> 1:32:54.480]  It's a win-win.
[1:32:54.480 --> 1:32:55.480]  $200.
[1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:58.480]  Go check out all their different products at InfowarsTour.com.
[1:32:58.480 --> 1:32:59.480]  It's amazing.
[1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:04.480]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:33:04.480 --> 1:33:10.480]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[1:33:17.480 --> 1:33:19.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:19.480 --> 1:33:21.480]  I'm David Knight and joining us now is Lionel,
[1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:24.480]  an Emmy Award-winning television news decoder, legal analyst,
[1:33:24.480 --> 1:33:26.480]  licensed trial lawyer, former prosecutor.
[1:33:26.480 --> 1:33:31.480]  You'll find him at lionelmedia.com, also on Twitter, at Lionel Media.
[1:33:31.480 --> 1:33:34.480]  But before we go to Lionel, I want to get his first thing I want.
[1:33:34.480 --> 1:33:36.480]  It says, take on this.
[1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:42.480]  We've got Rand Paul, who's saying that the people who leaked this information on Trump should go to jail.
[1:33:42.480 --> 1:33:44.480]  And I think it's very interesting.
[1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:45.480]  It makes a very compelling point.
[1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:48.480]  And of course, Lionel is also a former prosecutor.
[1:33:48.480 --> 1:33:50.480]  And I'd like to get his take on this.
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:53.480]  Let's play this clip and get Lionel's take on this.
[1:33:53.480 --> 1:33:55.480]  Rand Paul.
[1:33:55.480 --> 1:33:59.480]  Senator Paul, Donald Trump also said today and acknowledged today in his press conference
[1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:03.480]  that Russia probably was behind cyber attacks in the past election.
[1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:11.480]  But he also struck back at allegations in an intelligence.ca that he said weren't fairly vetted or even rife.
[1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:18.480]  But this almost sounded like a cabal on a part of intelligence officials.
[1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:20.480]  What do you make of it?
[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:25.480]  What I would say is that if there's private information that someone is blackmailing a public figure,
[1:34:25.480 --> 1:34:30.480]  and the public figure or someone takes it to the intelligence agencies, you would think it would be private.
[1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:34.480]  And really, this is so important that I think whoever leaked it should be prosecuted.
[1:34:34.480 --> 1:34:36.480]  Someone should go to jail.
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:40.480]  If this was an intelligence agency had to talk to the media, they should go to jail.
[1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:43.480]  If this was part of the Obama administration, they should go to jail.
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:47.480]  The reason is you don't want your public figures succumbing to blackmail.
[1:34:47.480 --> 1:34:51.480]  Now, he's saying the information is false, and I have to rely on his word on that.
[1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:55.480]  But the thing is, let's say any public official is being blackmailed.
[1:34:55.480 --> 1:34:58.480]  What do they tell you to do? You're supposed to go to the FBI and give them the information.
[1:34:58.480 --> 1:35:04.480]  But if you can't trust the FBI to keep it secret, and the FBI is going to tell the press what someone is blackmailing you about,
[1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:10.480]  what will happen is it will lead to a situation where public figures may be more liable to be extorted or to be blackmailed.
[1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:12.480]  So this is a very serious thing.
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:17.480]  That's exactly what your colleague Senator John McCain did with this, that's for what you outlined,
[1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:24.480]  that someone gave this or got wind of this, sent it and went to the FBI with this information and let them pursue it.
[1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:26.480]  What do you think of the approach he took?
[1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:29.480]  Well, I don't know what all happened.
[1:35:29.480 --> 1:35:34.480]  All I can say is when information is given to the FBI, particularly information that people are using to blackmail somebody,
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:41.480]  it has to be kept private, and no one will want to give information to the FBI if the FBI is going to release blackmail information to the public.
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:43.480]  This is essentially what happened.
[1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:50.480]  Somebody is releasing information that was trying to be used to blackmail it, and it turns out the President-elect says it's not true,
[1:35:50.480 --> 1:35:57.480]  but what's more important than any of that is that you can't let the intelligence agencies release blackmail information to the public.
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:03.480]  It had to either be them, or I'm not sure if the Obama administration was in this meeting, I'm not sure how the information got out,
[1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:05.480]  but this should not be released to the public.
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:06.480]  That's crazy.
[1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:14.480]  These are allegations, I have no way of ascertaining whether they're true or false, but it's absolutely inappropriate for someone to be putting this out in the public.
[1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:18.480]  Alright, that's an interesting point that Rand Paul makes as he's talking to Neal Cavuto.
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:20.480]  Joining us now is Lionel.
[1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:22.480]  Lionel, what is your take on that?
[1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:24.480]  It's fascinating.
[1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:29.480]  It is fascinating how this started.
[1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:32.480]  David, where do we begin?
[1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:38.480]  No, I'm serious. Where do I begin?
[1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:45.480]  If I could just have one minute of a program, a polagaminon, if you will, just an introduction.
[1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:55.480]  Since I have become relatively aware of what's going on, I thought that it couldn't get any more complicated before.
[1:36:55.480 --> 1:37:00.480]  Bill Clinton, I thought, my God, look at the media there after Bill Clinton, and the right wing and the left wing.
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:03.480]  It was very simple. Right wing, left wing media.
[1:37:03.480 --> 1:37:05.480]  Right wing, left wing media.
[1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:10.480]  And the media would sometimes vacillate or be somehow, maybe a little bit skewed one way or the other.
[1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:20.480]  Now we have left wing, right wing, alt left, alt right, media, fake news media, various internet platform media, controlled media.
[1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:30.480]  Then you have Donald Trump, who completely upset the apple cart and poses an existential threat to everyone.
[1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:41.480]  He is a threat, David, to everyone, to the left, to the political right, to the globalist, to the international banksters, to the deep state, whatever you want to call it.
[1:37:41.480 --> 1:37:56.480]  He has upset the apple cart, and so consequently, he is going to be the beneficiary of this frisson, this calamity, this complete unraveling of everyone.
[1:37:56.480 --> 1:38:02.480]  He can just sit back, say nothing, and watch what has happened.
[1:38:02.480 --> 1:38:17.480]  I, again, cannot believe how there used to be something called somewhat this notion of journalistic integrity.
[1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:25.480]  And we needed to always, you know, David, back up independent alternative media platforms and the like.
[1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:31.480]  Now they are themselves under attack, and sometimes deservedly so.
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:40.480]  But what I've just said in perhaps 30 or so seconds of sounds like complete disjointed gibberish, because that's exactly what the state we're in right now.
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:45.480]  I don't know from moment to moment who's in charge.
[1:38:45.480 --> 1:38:49.480]  Rand Paul, Rand Paul is, he makes a lot of sense.
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:58.480]  I think what I used to think makes sense, makes sense, but Trump intel leakers should go to jail.
[1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:05.480]  First, let us stop with this idea, this fetish, David, that we have about putting people in prison and in jail.
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:07.480]  Let's just stop this.
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:25.480]  Let us stop this idea that speech, leaked speech, whistleblowers, whether it might be Daniel Ellsberg, Sange, Snowden, who knows a concerned citizen, think of the Aaron Brockovich model.
[1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:36.480]  When you allow this trope or meme to be suggested that whistleblowers, or excuse me, that people who leak should go to jail, that poses a very, very serious threat.
[1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:42.480]  So the first reaction to all First Amendment scholars and lovers of liberty should be, wait a minute, stop.
[1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:50.480]  Let us look at this very carefully and see if there's another way, because any time First Amendment and free speech is thwarted, David, we all lose.
[1:39:50.480 --> 1:40:02.480]  Absolutely, and of course Barack Obama, with using the 100-year-old 1917 Espionage Act, put more journalists and whistleblowers in than all the other presidents in the last 100 years combined.
[1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:03.480]  He put them into jail.
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:06.480]  So there's been a lot of move against whistleblowers.
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:16.480]  And I think the interesting thing in defense of Rand Paul, when people said, oh, we got to put Snowden in jail, we've got to put WikiLeaks and Julian Assange in jail.
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:26.480]  He said, all right, fine, you want to put them in jail for releasing that information, then fine, you put the people in the NSA whose crimes they exposed, put them in jail as well, okay?
[1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:28.480]  So I think that's where he's coming from.
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:42.480]  And I look at this, I think what Rand Paul doesn't want to go, where he doesn't want to go, is where we saw this German former defense spokesman, say, a member of parliament in Germany, say, look, this is a war.
[1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:45.480]  You've got the military industrial complex coming after Donald Trump.
[1:40:45.480 --> 1:40:52.480]  When Neil Cavuto started talking about John McCain, and he said, well, didn't John McCain do the right thing?
[1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:54.480]  Didn't he give this stuff to the FBI?
[1:40:54.480 --> 1:41:01.480]  I think the intention of John McCain, I think the intention of the FBI and the people who leaked this out there, was to do character assassination on Donald Trump.
[1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:03.480]  And so that is the issue.
[1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:10.480]  And so Rand Paul didn't want to go to it to say, hey, this is an attempted coup against Donald Trump.
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:15.480]  Instead, he's saying, hey, you got a situation here where the FBI is supposed to investigate blackmailers.
[1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:32.480]  And when somebody is being blackmailed for something, they ought to be able to go to them, especially if it's not true, that'll be able to go to them and say, hey, I want you to investigate this and expect that the FBI or the intelligence services aren't going to put that out in the press.
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:41.480]  And I think that is a weaponized version, a weaponized abuse of their office and abuse of their trust to do that.
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:43.480]  I think that's what he's really kind of speaking to here.
[1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:46.480]  Well, look, again, I'm very sensitive to the notion of jail.
[1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:50.480]  Number one, number two, I wish Rand Paul would have said this is precisely a coup.
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:52.480]  This is precisely what it is.
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:55.480]  Rand, with all due respect, grew a pair, called the way it is.
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:56.480]  That's exactly what this is.
[1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:05.480]  Now, David, do you remember the old days, a lot of the youngsters and the millennial types might not know this, but during the heyday of J. Edgar Hoover, he would do the following.
[1:42:05.480 --> 1:42:11.480]  Let's say you were a congressman or senator, and let's say more importantly, you were in charge of my budget.
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:17.480]  And I would go to your office and I would say, Senator Nightman, I speak with you for a moment.
[1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:18.480]  Yes, close the door.
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:19.480]  So listen, I just want you to know something.
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:25.480]  We have this information here, and it would be very, very dangerous if this ever got out.
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:29.480]  I just want you to know that it's not, it's safe with us.
[1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:36.480]  Don't worry, we have stopped this, any of the channels, and we will make sure that it never gets out.
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:42.480]  Now, about that funding, and that's kind of sort of what this is, but not as artful.
[1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:49.480]  What McCain is doing is basically saying is he says, hey, look, I didn't, I'm just trying to pass this along.
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:54.480]  I'm not trying in any way to discredit President-elect Trump.
[1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:58.480]  What I'm doing is merely saying that this is a bigger issue.
[1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:03.480]  This could compromise the safety and the integrity of American intelligence.
[1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:10.480]  And I'm doing it for, it just so happens that President-elect Trump, a man whom I loathe, happens to be the beneficiary of this bad news.
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:11.480]  But let me just stop right there.
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:13.480]  Look at this fellow right here.
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:15.480]  Let me ask you a very simple question, David.
[1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:16.480]  Good guy, bad guy.
[1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:17.480]  Answer the question.
[1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:20.480]  Good guy or bad guy?
[1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:21.480]  Which one?
[1:43:21.480 --> 1:43:22.480]  Are you talking about that, McCain?
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:23.480]  Sorry?
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:24.480]  Oh, on screen.
[1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:25.480]  Oh, sorry.
[1:43:25.480 --> 1:43:26.480]  Yeah.
[1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:27.480]  James Clapper.
[1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:28.480]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:43:28.480 --> 1:43:29.480]  I would say a bad guy.
[1:43:29.480 --> 1:43:32.480]  This is a guy, they ask, are you spying on the American people?
[1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:33.480]  You're collecting stuff?
[1:43:33.480 --> 1:43:36.480]  And of course, you know, he can't even make eye contact with Ron Wyden.
[1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:39.480]  He's looking down and rubbing his eye, you know?
[1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:48.480]  Do you remember, again, years ago, I'm very historic today, when Jeremiah Denton, the brave POW in Vietnam, was being asked questions.
[1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:50.480]  And he was blinking in Morse code.
[1:43:50.480 --> 1:43:51.480]  Like, they're beating me.
[1:43:51.480 --> 1:43:52.480]  They're torturing me.
[1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:55.480]  But Clapper was saying, well, and he still has it.
[1:43:55.480 --> 1:43:58.480]  I mean, they're still talking about perjury in the past with him.
[1:43:58.480 --> 1:44:02.480]  I mean, this man is not the, you know, the standard bearer of veracity.
[1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:11.480]  But he's thinking, well, let me just get down to brass tacks, David, because you know when it comes down to brass tacks, that's our middle name.
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:13.480]  I'm a trial lawyer by profession.
[1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:14.480]  I love facts.
[1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:16.480]  If there's no facts, there's no evidence.
[1:44:16.480 --> 1:44:17.480]  There's no facts.
[1:44:17.480 --> 1:44:18.480]  It never happened.
[1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:19.480]  It never happened.
[1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:21.480]  You may be a lot of things.
[1:44:21.480 --> 1:44:24.480]  But if I don't have proof of it, it never happened.
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:33.480]  Number one, to date, as we speak, and President-elect Trump kind of let me down with this one.
[1:44:33.480 --> 1:44:34.480]  And we, you know what he said?
[1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:38.480]  Okay, look, I admit, okay, there was some, maybe there was some Russian hacking.
[1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:39.480]  Excuse me.
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:42.480]  What evidence of Russian hacking is there?
[1:44:42.480 --> 1:44:44.480]  There is none.
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:46.480]  Yeah, we've had, we had John McAfee on yesterday.
[1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:47.480]  They talk about it.
[1:44:47.480 --> 1:44:48.480]  He destroyed that.
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:53.480]  And we've seen one article after the other, people who are technically proficient, people
[1:44:53.480 --> 1:44:59.480]  who are in the cybersecurity business, white hats, who have totally destroyed this phony
[1:44:59.480 --> 1:45:03.480]  report that we got before the phony dossier that broke a couple of dates ago.
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:04.480]  Now, a couple of things too.
[1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:10.480]  Let's say tonight you go home to your palatial man's and the front door is broken.
[1:45:10.480 --> 1:45:11.480]  It's shattered.
[1:45:11.480 --> 1:45:12.480]  It's hanging on the hinges.
[1:45:12.480 --> 1:45:16.480]  And you go inside and nothing's been taken.
[1:45:16.480 --> 1:45:17.480]  Nothing.
[1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:21.480]  You and your family say, no, it's just an inventory and nothing's been taken.
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:25.480]  You call the police and you say, I've been burglarized.
[1:45:25.480 --> 1:45:26.480]  Okay.
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:30.480]  Technically, you really have it because there was somebody came in with anything taken.
[1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:32.480]  No, but we were burglarized.
[1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:34.480]  So we were hacked.
[1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:43.480]  I guess there's evidence of maybe Russia or somebody entering a budding, doing something.
[1:45:43.480 --> 1:45:44.480]  That's not David.
[1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:46.480]  What we're talking about.
[1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:49.480]  Imagine this story.
[1:45:49.480 --> 1:45:58.480]  Russian FSB agents under the direction of Vladimir Putin changed the vote count and Donald Trump
[1:45:58.480 --> 1:46:01.480]  actually received only 15 votes.
[1:46:01.480 --> 1:46:03.480]  Now, that's a good story.
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:05.480]  Now, that's a hack I want to talk about.
[1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:09.480]  And I think that's what they're trying to imply because they keep talking about it being hacked.
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:11.480]  I think that's what the public is hearing.
[1:46:11.480 --> 1:46:17.480]  And that's why you've got Homeland Security moving into the voting machines trying to make their move on that.
[1:46:17.480 --> 1:46:18.480]  Yeah.
[1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:23.480]  Listen to how language, how language is so important.
[1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:28.480]  Nobody talks about the veracity, the authenticity of the information.
[1:46:28.480 --> 1:46:30.480]  Let's assume another, another argument.
[1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:34.480]  God forbid a spouse were to come home and find her husband's phone.
[1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:38.480]  So they found pictures of you with your secretary in rather compromising positions.
[1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:42.480]  And the husband responds with, I've been hacked.
[1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:45.480]  Now, I don't care whether I've been hacked or not.
[1:46:45.480 --> 1:46:52.480]  Is this or is this not you dressed in an Ike jacket and a whip, you know, with a barn owl costume?
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:53.480]  All right.
[1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:56.480]  The problem is, is that we asked them this particular question.
[1:46:56.480 --> 1:46:57.480]  All right.
[1:46:57.480 --> 1:47:03.480]  Let's assume, as we lawyers say, argument for the sake of argument, let's assume that there was hacking there.
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:07.480]  Was the information that was revealed?
[1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:08.480]  Was it true?
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:09.480]  Let's look at it.
[1:47:09.480 --> 1:47:14.480]  Was there evidence that the Democratic Party itself subverted, let's say Bernie Sanders or did something?
[1:47:14.480 --> 1:47:15.480]  That's number one.
[1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:19.480]  Number two, which is the most important, explain this to me.
[1:47:19.480 --> 1:47:25.480]  And I want everybody watching and listening from sea to shiny sea and from around the world.
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:28.480]  How exactly did this happen?
[1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:36.480]  Did somebody, let's say in Austin one day walk up to the polling booth and a man says, honey, something happened right now.
[1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:37.480]  I'm feeling this.
[1:47:37.480 --> 1:47:43.480]  I was going to vote for Hillary Clinton, but I think, I think the DNC was hacked.
[1:47:43.480 --> 1:47:46.480]  And for some reason, I may not be sure about this.
[1:47:46.480 --> 1:47:48.480]  I'm voting for Donald Trump now.
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:51.480]  I don't know why I voted.
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:48:03.480]  What do you mean to tell me all of those people, 65, 60, whatever, millions of people who showed up and the tens of thousands to the rock star show called the Trump extravaganza.
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:09.480]  Why were they voting for him?
[1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:13.480]  Did it have anything to do with, you know, honey, I would have never voted for Donald Trump.
[1:48:13.480 --> 1:48:21.480]  But you know, this amazing invisible, mysterious hack that I've never heard about until after the election has changed me.
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:22.480]  That's gone.
[1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:27.480]  Now, you might do something else, which is great too, because David, as you normally do so brilliantly, you inspire me.
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:30.480]  I think language is a critical thing.
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:32.480]  How we say things.
[1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:37.480]  Years ago, we have a joke in criminal law when somebody would ask us, is this illegal?
[1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:39.480]  I say, no, it's unlawful.
[1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:41.480]  Or I did if you were a client.
[1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:43.480]  I said, have you ever been convicted of a crime?
[1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:44.480]  And he said, convicted?
[1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:45.480]  Convicted?
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:46.480]  Okay, we got a part.
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:48.480]  Now, you notice this, David.
[1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:54.480]  There was not documents found, pictures, movies, gifts, JPEGs.
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:56.480]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:02.480]  You see, David, they found a dossier.
[1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:03.480]  Exactly.
[1:49:03.480 --> 1:49:05.480]  They have a dossier.
[1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:10.480]  And I guarantee you, more people turned up and said, hey, Milford, yeah.
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:11.480]  The hell's a dossier?
[1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:12.480]  Is that like a bidet?
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:14.480]  Is that like that French poet?
[1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:15.480]  What is a dossier?
[1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:17.480]  Did they find it in an attaché?
[1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:18.480]  Was it?
[1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:20.480]  That makes it give it more credibility.
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:22.480]  Gravitas, there you go.
[1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:26.480]  And Bette, I think it was a communique.
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:30.480]  Those things we heard in all those spy movies, a communique.
[1:49:30.480 --> 1:49:34.480]  I'm sure that Alex, when he sends you memos, he sends you communiques.
[1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:39.480]  So all of a sudden, we now have communiques.
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:43.480]  Now, in this thing, I want to also speak about something.
[1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:47.480]  Again, part of the multivariate theme here.
[1:49:47.480 --> 1:49:55.480]  As you know, under the case of New York Times against Sullivan, this is the consummate,
[1:49:55.480 --> 1:50:03.480]  the most important seminal libel case in our American jurisprudence when a public figure
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:06.480]  sues for libel defamation and the like.
[1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:13.480]  And because that public figure is a public figure and is able to summon a press conference
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:20.480]  or hold him or herself out in fights controversy, maybe oftentimes as a politician, when they
[1:50:20.480 --> 1:50:25.480]  are allegedly defamed or libeled, they have a higher standard, a higher burden.
[1:50:25.480 --> 1:50:32.480]  They have to show that that libel, that defamation, that slander, was based in malice.
[1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:33.480]  And it was malicious.
[1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:36.480]  And it was based, for example, a reckless disregard for the truth.
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:41.480]  When we return after this incredible month, I'm going to tell you how the defense, whatever
[1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:48.480]  that little memo, could not have been written better by a plaintiff's lawyer as he basically
[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:51.480]  described malice in so many words.
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:53.480]  They were very careful with it, weren't they?
[1:50:53.480 --> 1:50:54.480]  We're going to be right back.
[1:50:54.480 --> 1:50:55.480]  I'm David Knight.
[1:50:55.480 --> 1:50:56.480]  We have Lionel with us.
[1:50:56.480 --> 1:50:57.480]  He's going to break this down.
[1:50:57.480 --> 1:50:58.480]  Stay with us.
[1:50:58.480 --> 1:50:59.480]  We'll be right back.
[1:50:59.480 --> 1:51:05.480]  Men, if you're like me, you appreciate the feeling of a clean, smooth shave from a quality
[1:51:05.480 --> 1:51:09.480]  blade, the sort of shave that cuts clean without the burn.
[1:51:09.480 --> 1:51:14.480]  So why are you messing around with generic razors that cost 32 bucks for an 8-pack?
[1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:19.480]  When you can shave with Harry's high-quality German engineered blades for half the price,

[1:51:44.480 --> 1:51:45.480]  enjoy?
[1:51:45.480 --> 1:51:48.480]  By owning the factory that manufactures the blades.

[1:53:04.600 --> 1:53:07.600]  Are you tired of your butt cheek speed frozen?
[1:53:07.600 --> 1:53:09.920]  Tired of cold hands or cold feet?
[1:53:09.920 --> 1:53:11.560]  I'm tired of the cold.
[1:53:11.560 --> 1:53:13.480]  Well, there's a new kid on the block.

[1:53:53.880 --> 1:54:09.720]  This is the end, beautiful.
[1:54:09.720 --> 1:54:11.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:11.560]  I'm David Knight.
[1:54:11.560 --> 1:54:13.400]  We're talking to Lionel.
[1:54:13.400 --> 1:54:17.360]  We were just talking about how the people in authority
[1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:19.560]  came out with a dossier in a communique.
[1:54:19.560 --> 1:54:22.640]  As Lionel pointed out, they use these kind of semantics.
[1:54:22.640 --> 1:54:25.520]  They use this kind of sophistry to argue
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:27.680]  from a position of authority.
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:28.800]  And we're going to go back.
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:32.640]  He was just breaking down the difference in terms
[1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:35.080]  of libel law, the Sullivan decision,
[1:54:35.080 --> 1:54:37.840]  on how a public figure is treated.
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:40.040]  So we're going to get back to Lionel on that.
[1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:43.560]  But I wanted to remind you again that we have this special
[1:54:43.560 --> 1:54:44.840]  that we started at the beginning of the year.
[1:54:44.840 --> 1:54:48.040]  People who are wanting to turn over a new leaf in life
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:51.080]  on their health, and of course, you need a good base
[1:54:51.080 --> 1:54:53.960]  of nutrients and supplements and vitamins and minerals.
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:54:57.240]  We've put a lot of these on sale at infowarslife.com.
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:54:58.360]  They are 2017.

[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:31.080]  and to support info wars.
[1:55:31.080 --> 1:55:35.040]  We don't get the massive funding from George Soros,
[1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:37.520]  as media matters does when they criticize us
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:39.280]  trying to say, we're trying to capitalize
[1:55:39.280 --> 1:55:42.400]  for telling people how to defend their bodies
[1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:46.200]  from whether it's Obama's shooting zones,
[1:55:46.200 --> 1:55:47.400]  his gun-free killing zones,
[1:55:47.400 --> 1:55:49.480]  or whether we try to tell you how to defend your body
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:54.080]  from the people who are dumping junk into your water,
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:55.840]  into your food supply.
[1:55:55.840 --> 1:55:56.960]  But that's how we make our money.
[1:55:56.960 --> 1:55:59.920]  We do that by offering you products that you can use
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:01.960]  to protect yourself, to protect your family,
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:03.120]  to make your life better,
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:05.920]  to increase your quality and vitality of life.
[1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:08.680]  So you'll find those specials at infowarslife.com.
[1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:10.480]  You'll also find our state-of-the-art
[1:56:10.480 --> 1:56:13.160]  carbon nanotube technology
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:18.160]  that is a state-of-the-art ultra-lightweight body armor
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:23.120]  that you'll find there is also inserts that insert there.
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:24.840]  That is our very cheapest format,
[1:56:24.840 --> 1:56:28.760]  and that is something you can put into your backpack
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:30.720]  when you travel, when your kids go to school.
[1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:32.160]  That's what I was criticized for,
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:33.680]  saying, hey, here's something
[1:56:33.680 --> 1:56:35.240]  that you could shield yourself with.
[1:56:35.240 --> 1:56:39.440]  You know, some people had a bullet stopped at that shooting.
[1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:40.880]  One guy had a bullet shot stopped
[1:56:40.880 --> 1:56:42.600]  by his personal computer.
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:46.400]  This is a lot more effective at stopping bullets
[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:47.640]  than a computer is.
[1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:49.080]  And it's a lot larger than an iPhone.
[1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:50.640]  Remember, there was a guy whose life was saved
[1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:54.080]  because he was in Istanbul at that shooting.
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:57.800]  And it was an iPhone that stopped a bullet.
[1:56:57.800 --> 1:56:58.920]  This is larger.
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:00.920]  This is designed to stop bullets,
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:01.840]  not to do something else.
[1:57:01.840 --> 1:57:03.360]  This is much more reliable
[1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:06.400]  and cheaper, more cost-effective way to protect yourself.
[1:57:06.400 --> 1:57:08.000]  Put that in your luggage instead.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:09.040]  All right, let's go back to Lionel.
[1:57:09.040 --> 1:57:11.040]  Lionel, you know, when they're talking about hacking,
[1:57:11.040 --> 1:57:12.840]  even they use semantics.
[1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:15.400]  They use it as a verb,
[1:57:15.400 --> 1:57:16.800]  is what the way people are hearing it.
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:18.280]  They're saying, oh, somebody hacked it.
[1:57:18.280 --> 1:57:19.520]  They broke into a computer.
[1:57:19.520 --> 1:57:20.680]  They stole some information.
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:22.600]  When in reality, what we're talking about
[1:57:22.600 --> 1:57:24.320]  is hack as a noun.
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:26.600]  We saw that Hillary Clinton was a political hack
[1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:30.200]  and the DNC were hacks and Podesta was a hack, okay?
[1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:32.960]  But they use it very cleverly, don't they?
[1:57:32.960 --> 1:57:34.480]  By the way, special little side note
[1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:36.680]  in this ammo, great product there.
[1:57:36.680 --> 1:57:37.960]  I'd buy that up real quick
[1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:41.200]  because you know somebody's gonna say, we can't,
[1:57:41.200 --> 1:57:43.480]  we can't let people protect themselves from this.
[1:57:43.480 --> 1:57:44.320]  Exactly.
[1:57:44.320 --> 1:57:45.400]  Oh yeah.
[1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:46.800]  You know, buy, no, no, no.
[1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:48.960]  So, you know, buy it now.
[1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:50.960]  I'm afraid of standing by.
[1:57:50.960 --> 1:57:52.040]  I want to read something to you before
[1:57:52.040 --> 1:57:54.480]  and I brought this to your attention.
[1:57:54.480 --> 1:57:59.400]  There is a, as I told you, in the libel law,
[1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:00.720]  when I put something out, let's say,
[1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:01.960]  and I put something out about David Knight
[1:58:01.960 --> 1:58:04.680]  and you're a public figure and you sue me,
[1:58:04.680 --> 1:58:06.480]  you've got to prove, basically.
[1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:10.160]  Now, what I did was I was basically guilty of malice.
[1:58:10.160 --> 1:58:12.000]  Reckless disregard for the facts.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:13.040]  Didn't really care.
[1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:15.000]  And I hear more music.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:16.280]  Yeah, we ran out of time again.
[1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:19.120]  I went so long, okay, we're gonna be right back with Lionel
[1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:21.560]  and we're gonna go straight to that explanation.
[1:58:21.560 --> 1:58:24.080]  We're gonna be back in less than a minute.
[1:58:24.080 --> 1:58:25.840]  We're gonna finish that point.
[1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:27.440]  All right, we're gonna be right back with Lionel.
[1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:28.760]  I'm David Knight.
[1:58:28.760 --> 1:58:36.760]  Here we go.
[1:58:36.760 --> 1:58:44.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[1:58:51.760 --> 1:58:53.760]  how high the stakes really are right now
[1:58:53.760 --> 1:58:54.760]  in the battle for freedom
[1:58:54.760 --> 1:58:57.760]  and the information war is paramount.
[1:58:57.760 --> 1:58:59.760]  That's why it's more important than ever

[1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:22.760]  at infowars.com.

[1:59:26.760 --> 1:59:28.760]  at infowars.com.

[1:59:30.760 --> 1:59:32.760]  to get info wars prime.

[1:59:39.760 --> 1:59:41.760]  We also have daily specials, sometimes as much
[1:59:41.760 --> 1:59:44.760]  as 50% off for members of info wars prime.
[1:59:44.760 --> 1:59:46.760]  Info wars has come a long way.
[1:59:46.760 --> 1:59:48.760]  Info wars prime is just one more weapon
[1:59:48.760 --> 1:59:51.760]  in the fight for liberty.
[1:59:51.760 --> 1:59:55.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:55.760 --> 1:59:58.760]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:59:58.760 --> 2:00:00.760]  I'm David Knight with Lionel.
[2:00:00.760 --> 2:00:02.760]  We hit two hard breaks, and Lionel
[2:00:02.760 --> 2:00:04.760]  was making a point about the Sullivan
[2:00:04.760 --> 2:00:07.760]  decision with the Supreme Court
[2:00:07.760 --> 2:00:14.040]  the difference in how the
[2:00:14.040 --> 2:00:16.760]  plan would work.
[2:00:16.760 --> 2:00:20.920]  Alex Joneshawnd, David Knight with Lionel, we hit two hard breaks and Lionel was making
[2:00:20.920 --> 2:00:25.800]  a point about the Sullivan decision with the Supreme Court, the difference in how they
[2:00:25.800 --> 2:00:27.680]  treat libel if it's a public figure.
[2:00:27.680 --> 2:00:30.480]  Go ahead, I'm going to give you the floor and let you make your point finally.
[2:00:30.480 --> 2:00:31.480]  Are you sure?
[2:00:31.480 --> 2:00:32.480]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:33.480]  Go ahead.
[2:00:33.480 --> 2:00:37.080]  By the way, Townsend, Poncho and Lefty, you can interrupt me with that great song at
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:38.080]  any time.
[2:00:38.080 --> 2:00:41.760]  By the way, David, don't you wish real life where if we're talking to relatives or friends
[2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:43.760]  we don't like, we just cue the music.
[2:00:43.760 --> 2:00:48.360]  We say, oh, I'm sorry, we're out of time, out of time, all right.
[2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:49.480]  This is from Ben Smith.
[2:00:49.480 --> 2:00:50.800]  This is to publish your Buzzfeed.
[2:00:50.800 --> 2:00:53.360]  I just want you to remember it now very quickly.
[2:00:53.360 --> 2:00:57.360]  In order for a public figure, Trump to sue, you've got to basically prove malice.
[2:00:57.360 --> 2:01:01.480]  He's got to show that you publish something with a total disregard for the facts or the
[2:01:01.480 --> 2:01:02.480]  truth.
[2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:09.040]  And he writes, as you have probably seen this evening, we published a secret dossier making
[2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:15.000]  explosive and unverified allegations about Donald Trump and Russia.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  Stop right there.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  That's it.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  There's your suit.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  Thank you.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:25.280]  You said you just wrote, and apparently he had no lawyer or somebody help him.
[2:01:25.280 --> 2:01:29.560]  But I, if I were Trump's lawyer, could not have written something better.
[2:01:29.560 --> 2:01:33.040]  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, how do we know this was unverified?
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:34.040]  Well, let's stay safe.
[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:36.480]  Let's go to the horse's mouth here.
[2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:42.040]  So now, well, we have to understand, though, David, and this is a bigger issue here.
[2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:47.000]  You know, a lot of times, and I say this with all due respect, you know, newsrooms and,
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:53.040]  you know, like Huffington Post and Google, there's a lot of 20-somethings and good people.
[2:01:53.040 --> 2:01:55.040]  It's not 20-something or 30-something.
[2:01:55.040 --> 2:01:56.800]  It's just some things that we're talking about.
[2:01:56.800 --> 2:02:00.360]  And they sit around, they were flanneling, they throw a football, and they, hey, this
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:01.360]  is great.
[2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:02.880]  I got a bunch of likes.
[2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:08.800]  And I want to tell them, do you understand that you're hitting enter, and you're sending
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:15.840]  a story up into this permanent ether called the Internet, is like you firing into a crowd.
[2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:16.960]  You can't take that back.
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:17.960]  That's right.
[2:02:17.960 --> 2:02:20.880]  You are now entering the world, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
[2:02:20.880 --> 2:02:25.840]  And by the way, let's applaud alternative bloggers, and you're going to be it.
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:28.840]  But you are now entering into something.
[2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:33.640]  And by the way, you know, years ago, I used to think that motorcycle drivers should be
[2:02:33.640 --> 2:02:37.840]  held to a different standard of care, because whenever you tap a motorcycle in traffic,
[2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:43.000]  you can kill somebody, or it will be a bumper fender bender with a car.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:48.720]  Well, if you made a mistake in a little local Austin or New York newspaper, kind of a penny-saver
[2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:52.680]  local thing, you know, you can say, can I have those copies back, please?
[2:02:52.680 --> 2:02:53.680]  I'm sorry.
[2:02:53.680 --> 2:02:54.680]  I made a mistake.
[2:02:54.680 --> 2:02:59.320]  And it could be the most blasphemous, horrible thing, but it wasn't that big of a deal because
[2:02:59.320 --> 2:03:01.880]  nobody really heard it, and okay, we can bring it back.
[2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:07.320]  Now, I can take something which really isn't that big of a deal, but by virtue of how many
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:14.720]  people it is, it reaches, it now is elevated to a level of contamination, if you will,
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:17.920]  that becomes deadly and toxic.
[2:03:17.920 --> 2:03:20.720]  This is another aspect of this story.
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:24.200]  Now, remember, Gawker was basically put out of business.
[2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:25.200]  Oh, yeah.
[2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:27.960]  But what they published was the truth.
[2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:33.720]  I mean, it was a violation of rights, and it was, but nobody ever said, hey, wait a minute,
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:38.280]  Hulk Hogan, that's not Hulk Hogan, that's, you got the wrong person, no, it was, it was,
[2:03:38.280 --> 2:03:43.400]  no, no, they said I was, so if you can get in trouble, there's an old Sicilian expression
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:45.920]  that says, if you can get in trouble for saying a little, I think what happens if you say
[2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:46.920]  a lot?
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:52.120]  Well, if you can get in trouble for basically publishing the truth, and normally truth is
[2:03:52.120 --> 2:03:54.920]  a defense and libel, what happens if this doesn't take place?
[2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:56.720]  Now, David, imagine this.
[2:03:56.720 --> 2:04:00.120]  Because the intent was to do harm, you know, it's what, what it was there, right?
[2:04:00.120 --> 2:04:02.120]  Well, it sure wasn't to make him look good.
[2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:06.240]  And by the way, if you as a, if you as a, as an editor or publisher got the story and
[2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:10.400]  you said, wait a minute, let me get this straight, Donald Trump is in Russia.
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:14.800]  I'm not going to go through this because you know all the terrible puns, but you, this,
[2:04:14.800 --> 2:04:20.200]  this, no, no, no, no, that's that, a couple of things we've got to understand here.
[2:04:20.200 --> 2:04:27.600]  The reason why it's critical that people go after Putin is because now you got to work
[2:04:27.600 --> 2:04:28.600]  backwards.
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:30.600]  Putin is the boogeyman.
[2:04:30.600 --> 2:04:32.720]  Putin is the boogeyman who justifies NATO.
[2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:33.720]  Yeah.
[2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:34.720]  That's the news.
[2:04:34.720 --> 2:04:35.720]  That's the music is coming in.
[2:04:35.720 --> 2:04:39.840]  I don't know where, we're out of time.
[2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:40.840]  And you're absolutely right.
[2:04:40.840 --> 2:04:45.880]  They want to tie Donald Trump's hands in terms of easing the relations that they have now
[2:04:45.880 --> 2:04:46.880]  made strained.
[2:04:46.880 --> 2:04:47.880]  I absolutely agree with you, Lionel.
[2:04:47.880 --> 2:04:50.760]  David, thanks so much for being with us, I'm sorry, we're out of time.
[2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:51.760]  You know what?
[2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:52.760]  Can we come back?
[2:04:52.760 --> 2:04:55.280]  David, I'll have you back next time with a Lionel show.
[2:04:55.280 --> 2:04:56.280]  Thank you, Lionel.
[2:04:56.280 --> 2:04:57.760]  That's Lionelmedia.com.
[2:04:57.760 --> 2:05:00.120]  You'll find him on Twitter at Lionelmedia.
[2:05:00.120 --> 2:05:01.120]  Thank you so much.
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:04.960]  One senator from Kentucky, Rand Paul, thinks that the Trump intel leaker should quote,
[2:05:04.960 --> 2:05:07.880]  go to jail and whoever leaked it should be prosecuted.
[2:05:07.880 --> 2:05:12.040]  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul said on Wednesday of this week, those responsible for leaking
[2:05:12.040 --> 2:05:17.080]  the intel pertaining to Donald Trump, whether fake or not, should be prosecuted and jailed.
[2:05:17.080 --> 2:05:20.560]  Kentucky said quote, what I want to say is if there's private information that someone
[2:05:20.560 --> 2:05:24.920]  is blackmailing a public figure and a public figure or someone takes it to the intelligence
[2:05:24.920 --> 2:05:27.560]  agencies, you would think it would be private.
[2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:32.120]  And really, this is so important that I think whoever leaked it should be prosecuted.
[2:05:32.120 --> 2:05:35.600]  He told this to Neil Kovuto of Fox News saying someone should go to jail.
[2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:40.080]  If this was an intelligence agency heard talked to the media, they should go to jail.
[2:05:40.080 --> 2:05:41.080]  Well, you know what, Senator?
[2:05:41.080 --> 2:05:42.720]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[2:05:42.720 --> 2:05:47.280]  Frankly, we understand that it's a steaming pile of garbage for those that may not.
[2:05:47.280 --> 2:05:52.040]  This is still information that is pertaining to a public figure that's quote, use to blackmail
[2:05:52.040 --> 2:05:53.040]  him.
[2:05:53.040 --> 2:05:56.040]  So somebody should be held responsible and I couldn't agree with you more.
[2:05:56.040 --> 2:05:59.880]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for info wars dot com.
[2:05:59.880 --> 2:06:04.400]  We have the new product and info wars life dot com bio true selenium.
[2:06:04.400 --> 2:06:09.160]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able
[2:06:09.160 --> 2:06:15.160]  to source a certified organic bio available selenium from mustard seed extract.
[2:06:15.160 --> 2:06:19.960]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[2:06:19.960 --> 2:06:20.960]  body.
[2:06:20.960 --> 2:06:23.040]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[2:06:23.040 --> 2:06:27.640]  It helps detoxify selenium is another one of those absolute must haves.
[2:06:27.640 --> 2:06:31.600]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used
[2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:37.520]  all over the body as a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent
[2:06:37.520 --> 2:06:44.000]  upon selenium, so it really is a all around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:45.760]  I'm taking it now every day.
[2:06:45.760 --> 2:06:51.000]  This is soaking bio true selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:54.680]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price exclusively available at info

[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:18.800]  disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[2:07:18.800 --> 2:07:22.080]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[2:07:22.080 --> 2:07:25.200]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[2:07:25.200 --> 2:07:28.040]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your

[2:07:55.440 --> 2:08:20.440]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance
[2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:27.440]  center.
[2:08:27.440 --> 2:08:28.360]  I've been listening the last 20 minutes to Lionel and David write down the fact that
[2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:34.560]  there's no evidence in this made up dossier and that the dossier itself has no providence
[2:08:34.560 --> 2:08:37.560]  has been floating around for almost a year and a half.
[2:08:37.560 --> 2:08:42.480]  My big issue and my question and what I'd like to get people to focus on out there in
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:48.480]  the listening audience to really think about is if they'll do this with eight days left
[2:08:48.480 --> 2:08:52.720]  until the inauguration what else are they going to do that's that's my point is that
[2:08:52.720 --> 2:09:00.000]  the story itself is a distraction I think from the larger issue of the MSM dropping
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:06.720]  any pretense of objectivity and just going completely insane and wild.
[2:09:06.720 --> 2:09:11.880]  Don't they understand even if they stop Trump from getting in they're done they're discredited
[2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:18.160]  they lost this war they got so damaged that even if they win which is a super long shot
[2:09:18.160 --> 2:09:23.600]  it's a pyrrhic victory everybody knows you hate America everybody knows that you've
[2:09:23.600 --> 2:09:31.400]  got mental problems and are just openly involved in an attempt to take over of this republic
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:36.680]  using disinformation and since when are our intelligence agencies publicly involved in
[2:09:36.680 --> 2:09:41.720]  our elections while claiming it's the Russians that are involved with no evidence I mean
[2:09:41.720 --> 2:09:47.880]  this is just over the top insane and the good news is nobody's buying it so Lionel David
[2:09:47.880 --> 2:09:53.920]  what's your take on that well Alex we let Lionel go but absolutely it is the fake news
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:58.440]  one of the reports we had here is a Russian tech expert that was in the fake intelligence
[2:09:58.440 --> 2:10:02.560]  report and we got to differentiate between these because you know we've had so many different
[2:10:02.560 --> 2:10:08.040]  fake reports remember there was the first dossier then there was the second dossier and as Lionel
[2:10:08.040 --> 2:10:13.240]  pointed out they use those terms just to sound authoritative to give it grovy toss but the
[2:10:13.240 --> 2:10:18.960]  first intelligence report that they came out with saying oh we know the Russians did this
[2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:25.200]  that was naming a Russian text tech expert in that report and he said they never contacted
[2:10:25.200 --> 2:10:30.280]  me you know they quote these people they put RT programs in their report that haven't
[2:10:30.280 --> 2:10:35.760]  existed for years they've done everything they can to build this into something that
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:41.400]  it truly isn't so that's the the first indication that this thing is phony but here's something
[2:10:41.400 --> 2:10:46.600]  else that we got from the report that was put out by Glenn Greenwald he said that for
[2:10:46.600 --> 2:10:52.360]  months the CIA with unprecedented clarity overtly threw its weight behind Hillary Clinton's
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:56.280]  candidacy and we've talked about this over and over again he talks about a CIA director
[2:10:56.280 --> 2:11:00.680]  Michael Morrell again he was a guy who took over from David Petraeus why did he take over
[2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:05.760]  from David Petraeus because David Petraeus had been careless with national security
[2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:10.840]  and thrown this stuff around to his mistress and he was given a slap on the wrist at least
[2:11:10.840 --> 2:11:16.020]  he lost his job nothing happened to Hillary Clinton and of course Michael Morrell who
[2:11:16.020 --> 2:11:21.400]  replaces David Petraeus then goes on to endorse Hillary Clinton even though she has the most
[2:11:21.400 --> 2:11:27.920]  egregious violations of national security ever not only in terms of the scope of what
[2:11:27.920 --> 2:11:31.760]  she the quantity of what she did out there but the qualitative intelligence that she
[2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:36.760]  put out there and so he announces his endorsement of Clinton and then he points out that General
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:42.680]  Michael Hayden former director of the CIA and the NSA had a lot of very vicious things
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:47.280]  to say about Donald Trump he said Trump is a useful fool a naïve manipulated by Moscow
[2:11:47.280 --> 2:11:52.680]  secretly held in contempt but whose blind support is happily accepted and exploited well that's
[2:11:52.680 --> 2:11:57.480]  not true and we know that but it kind of tells you where Michael Hayden is remember who Michael
[2:11:57.480 --> 2:12:02.620]  Hayden is Michael Hayden is the guy who went to a forum with Judge Napolitano and he stood
[2:12:02.620 --> 2:12:09.120]  up at one point said well I'm a libertarian and and the other guy's like what this is
[2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:15.640]  a guy who supported no restrictions whatsoever on the intelligence services violating our
[2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:20.720]  privacy remember we had that report we went to he spoke at Washington and Lee and he said
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:25.680]  I didn't need the Constitution I didn't need the Patriot Act I had a direct order from
[2:12:25.680 --> 2:12:33.160]  the president of the United States that's the mentality of people like Michael Hayden
[2:12:33.160 --> 2:12:36.840]  he has absolutely no respect for the rule of law so I don't need any laws I don't need
[2:12:36.840 --> 2:12:44.320]  a stinking laws I don't need no badges that's his aspect on this yeah that's the danger
[2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:50.120]  of all of this and we can see this today I was just handed this report from Michael
[2:12:50.120 --> 2:12:55.640]  McHale Phelan about the New York Times say now they're gonna give the NSA even more power
[2:12:55.640 --> 2:13:01.640]  to share intercepted communications and this is coming as a parting shot from Barack Obama
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:07.080]  who has done everything to enhance the surveillance state and I gotta say as I see all this stuff
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:15.240]  playing out in one respect I'm very glad that it's happened because Donald Trump is experiencing
[2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:21.880]  the dangers of the surveillance state he is experiencing what can happen when the deep
[2:13:21.880 --> 2:13:29.600]  state doesn't like you and so I hope that what comes out of this is a new found respect
[2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:34.720]  for civil liberty and the rule of law that's really the solution to this that's the ultimate
[2:13:34.720 --> 2:13:38.920]  solution it isn't just taking the reins of power and taking these other guys down if
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:43.560]  we do it that way that's not gonna work out well for any of us okay but the thing that
[2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:48.800]  works out well for all Americans and I hope and I believe that Donald Trump will ultimately
[2:13:48.800 --> 2:13:52.680]  take this view because he was really sided with the common American when it comes to
[2:13:52.680 --> 2:13:58.240]  the economy and not with the globalist elitist and he has to understand that and I think
[2:13:58.240 --> 2:14:02.680]  he is getting this lesson if you didn't ever understand before boy he is experiencing this
[2:14:02.680 --> 2:14:08.520]  from a personal aspect and understanding the danger of these out of control intelligence
[2:14:08.520 --> 2:14:12.840]  services who absolutely don't care for the rule of law don't care about personal privacy
[2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:17.720]  he could care less about the Constitution and our civil liberties the rights that we
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:22.160]  have enshrined there the rights that we don't get from the Constitution but that are protected
[2:14:22.160 --> 2:14:25.840]  in the Constitution but here's this article from the New York Times in his final days
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:30.160]  the Obama administration has expanded the power of the NSA to share globally intercepted
[2:14:30.160 --> 2:14:35.480]  personal communications with the government's 16 other intelligence agencies before applying
[2:14:35.480 --> 2:14:40.480]  any privacy protection they say the change means that far more officials will be searching
[2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:46.000]  through raw data previously the NSA would filter information that it got before sharing
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  intercepted communications with another agency like the CIA or intelligence branches of the
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:58.480]  FBI the DEA the drug drug enforcement administration the NSA's analysts passed on only information
[2:14:58.480 --> 2:15:03.040]  that they deemed pertinent screening out the identities of innocent people and irrelevant
[2:15:03.040 --> 2:15:08.960]  personal information now they're not going to do that anymore now they go the next step
[2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:15.360]  see the gradual incremental destruction of every last shred of freedom and dignity that
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:20.960]  we have left in this country it's relentless they will never stop somebody has to stop
[2:15:20.960 --> 2:15:26.080]  them and I hope Donald Trump will see where this is leading see this from his personal
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:31.200]  experiences and say I'm going to stop this and I'm going to stop it for all Americans
[2:15:31.200 --> 2:15:36.320]  they say now other intelligence agencies will be able to search directly through raw repositories
[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:40.160]  of communications intercepted by the NSA and then apply such rules for minimizing privacy
[2:15:40.160 --> 2:15:46.320]  intrusions and let me tell you the most dangerous parts of this are not your recorded text messages
[2:15:46.320 --> 2:15:52.720]  your recorded emails but the metadata that they collect on you showing what you do all
[2:15:52.720 --> 2:15:56.560]  of that little metadata that Michael Hayden was lying to you about the James Clapper
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:16:01.040]  was lying to you about telling you that's not important let me tell you James Clapper
[2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:06.640]  DNI James Clapper who lied to Ron Wyden and said we're not really collecting any information and
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:10.880]  then it was just within a couple of months we had the Snowden leaks that proved that they were
[2:16:10.880 --> 2:16:16.960]  and had been for a very long time that guy James Clapper has since the year 2000
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:22.640]  been at the forefront of the fastest growing part of the intelligence community and that is
[2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:29.840]  geospatial intelligence where are you mapping what you do to where you are mapping the human
[2:16:29.840 --> 2:16:34.960]  domain activity based intelligence human domain analytics it's all part of geospatial intelligence
[2:16:34.960 --> 2:16:41.040]  that has been the fastest growing area of intelligence and most people are not even aware
[2:16:41.040 --> 2:16:46.800]  of what that is and when he tells you oh we're just collecting metadata that is the most important
[2:16:46.800 --> 2:16:51.440]  information because with that they can plug that into a computer and run algorithms on you and do
[2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:58.480]  them in order to report pre-crime profiling and that can turn up false positives yeah it can
[2:16:58.480 --> 2:17:03.360]  identify some criminals perhaps before they do anything how is that working out for us so far
[2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:08.560]  how has it worked out for us so far turning over all of our privacy and all of our information to
[2:17:08.560 --> 2:17:14.320]  these intelligence services I mean just look at this guy the shooter in Fort Lauderdale he goes
[2:17:14.320 --> 2:17:20.240]  into an FBI agency they don't even have to spy on him and do any intelligence he goes into them
[2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:25.600]  and says I'm I'm being compelled to watch these ISIS videos and to go fight for ISIS
[2:17:25.600 --> 2:17:31.600]  they say oh well let's let's send you over here and less than two months later after they put him
[2:17:31.600 --> 2:17:36.880]  into a mental institution he's down there shooting people and of course then it subsequently comes
[2:17:36.880 --> 2:17:44.080]  out this guy had connections to ISIS they they hid that from us for several days we found out
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:53.280]  subsequently that this guy had had connections with Islam before he went over to to fight as a
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:18:01.040]  soldier so none of this was on the screen of the FBI they didn't do anything about it they
[2:18:01.040 --> 2:18:06.240]  didn't even put him on a no fly list and as I pointed out one of the first stories that I had
[2:18:06.240 --> 2:18:10.960]  when I came here at info wars was somebody who was unfairly put on a no fly list had no reason
[2:18:10.960 --> 2:18:15.600]  to put him on a no fly list he couldn't find out why they had put him on the no fly list he couldn't
[2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:19.360]  find out if they had really taken him off they allowed him to fly back from why they stranded
[2:18:19.360 --> 2:18:26.320]  him in Hawaii he was on his way to see his wife who was in the military in Japan but that's the
[2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:31.680]  problem with it you get false positives like that guy who was stranded in Hawaii and then you get
[2:18:31.680 --> 2:18:36.560]  situations where the intelligence agencies do absolutely nothing and I'm just assuming that
[2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:41.600]  there wasn't any skullduggery going on there's that's a whole another aspect to it that I think
[2:18:41.600 --> 2:18:47.440]  really needs to be looked at very carefully there's a lot of indications that they they would like
[2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:51.200]  to see this type of thing we see this every time there's a shooting like the navy yard shooter who
[2:18:51.200 --> 2:18:57.760]  says well here's my ELF gun my extremely low frequency gun of course we had situations in
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:19:06.240]  the past we had the we had Michael Kino part of the church of satan the church of set this guy
[2:19:06.240 --> 2:19:12.240]  who was on the Oprah Winfrey show dressed up like Eddie Munster talking about his satanism who had
[2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:19.520]  been there were allegations that he was involved in pedophilia at the the the military base in
[2:19:19.520 --> 2:19:23.200]  san francisco the prosidio all these different things and yet this guy continues on with the
[2:19:23.200 --> 2:19:29.040]  national security agency and he talked about using ELF decades ago to project mind control
[2:19:29.040 --> 2:19:32.720]  situations so when you got this guy the navy yard shooter says I'm being persecuted by voices and I
[2:19:32.720 --> 2:19:37.360]  got ELF you really don't think that this is credible you really think that this is over the top we
[2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:42.400]  just had at the consumer electronics show people talking about brain implants at a consumer level
[2:19:42.400 --> 2:19:46.640]  the pentagon has been talking about this for a long time and yet people don't want to believe
[2:19:46.640 --> 2:19:50.080]  that that can happen stay with us we're going to be right back at the bottom of the hour we're

[2:24:21.520 --> 2:24:28.160]  of course we have it's just amazing how they continue on with this today we had the EPA come
[2:24:28.160 --> 2:24:34.400]  after Chrysler they just got a four billion dollar criminal charges they kidnapped an executive at
[2:24:34.400 --> 2:24:38.720]  VW and I guess has held him as ransom until they could get another four billion that takes up to
[2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:42.800]  20 billion dollars that they've gotten from Volkswagen and now they're going after Chrysler
[2:24:42.800 --> 2:24:47.760]  this is the out of control EPA that is at the center of all these different things
[2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:51.680]  okay they're trying to take over everybody's water and say we're going to control your water
[2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:57.280]  went after that guy with eight acres in Montana remember that finding him tens of thousands
[2:24:57.280 --> 2:25:02.560]  of dollars a day getting it up to such a large amount they wanted to then exercise new powers for
[2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:08.160]  the EPA and garnish his wages they were shut down by the court they're absolutely out of control
[2:25:08.160 --> 2:25:13.760]  and at the same time they're doing that they blew up a mine and polluted with heavy metals
[2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:18.480]  a river that went through three entire states in an Indian reservation I mean this is the EPA
[2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:23.280]  that we're talking about here so we're going to talk to Mark Moreno in the next segment about the
[2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:28.240]  EPA about climate change what is going to be changing under the trump administration before
[2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:32.320]  we do I want to remind you that we've gotten back in stock DNA force it's been out of stock for several
[2:25:32.320 --> 2:25:38.800]  months and actually it's a little over a month ago I should say and we were able to get an emergency
[2:25:38.800 --> 2:25:43.360]  supply of DNA force in it's very difficult for us to get this it's very expensive to produce but
[2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:50.240]  it's also a very scarce ingredient to give them the key ingredient in this biopqq and you can look
[2:25:50.240 --> 2:25:56.720]  this up there's 175 clinical studies about the effectiveness of biopqq just one batch of this
[2:25:56.720 --> 2:26:02.880]  costs more than $30,000 so this is one of our premier probably the premier product that we have
[2:26:02.880 --> 2:26:08.560]  in terms of expense because it's very expensive for us to produce this so a 10 discount on that
[2:26:08.560 --> 2:26:14.160]  is a substantial savings and it is our thank you because we have been out of stock for a while and
[2:26:14.160 --> 2:26:18.320]  of course this is an emergency shipment it could be months before we get a larger shipment of this
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:24.560]  end so now is the time to stock up on that you'll find that infowarslife.com also we have specials

[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:26.240]  of the hour all these reports that came out yesterday we just kind of touched on a little bit
[2:27:26.240 --> 2:27:31.760]  was the fact that donald trump had reached out to robert kennedy jr because robert kennedy has
[2:27:31.760 --> 2:27:38.080]  spoken out against the abuses of the cdc the abuses of uh mandatory vaccines and that sort of thing
[2:27:38.080 --> 2:27:42.480]  i think it's very important to see people that he's bringing in on which you would have a lot
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:47.440]  of disagreements with but reaching out to people that are democrats who would disagree with him
[2:27:47.440 --> 2:27:52.000]  on pretty much everything except this core issue donald trump has spoken out on this it's one of
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:57.200]  the things that really made me stop and say this guy is genuine i mean the first thing about donald
[2:27:57.200 --> 2:28:00.560]  trump and we've always heard we heard the republicans so many times say we're going to close the
[2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:04.720]  border we're going to get rid of obama care they never did it they never did any of the things that
[2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:09.360]  they said they were going to do but donald trump had been when i realized that uh 30 years earlier
[2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:13.040]  he'd spent a hundred thousand dollars take out ads against the unfairness of nafta this guy's
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:17.680]  for real when i heard him talking about vaccines it's like wow this guy's not only for real but
[2:28:17.680 --> 2:28:22.640]  he's not afraid to take the heat and that's what we're seeing here with these attacks on him by the
[2:28:22.640 --> 2:28:28.800]  intelligence services by the elite by the globalist is because he's saying this type of thing which
[2:28:28.800 --> 2:28:33.280]  actually is what robert kennedy has said this is what robert kennedy said in hearings in vermont he
[2:28:33.280 --> 2:28:38.480]  said the cdc is a troubled agency there have been four separate scathing federal studies about the
[2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:43.120]  cdc i'm not talking about the whole agency i'm talking about the vaccine division one by the
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:48.080]  u.s state the united states senate a three-year study one by the house another by hhs by the
[2:28:48.080 --> 2:28:53.040]  inspector general and a study this year by the office of research and integrity and all together
[2:28:53.040 --> 2:28:59.360]  and separately they paint a picture of an agency that has become a cesspool of corruption he said
[2:28:59.360 --> 2:29:04.240]  hey breakfast last week with the president of a network news division see this this uh plays into
[2:29:04.240 --> 2:29:08.320]  this uh fake news stuff that we've got from the networks another reason why they don't like donald
[2:29:08.320 --> 2:29:14.800]  trump i had a breakfast he said with the president of a network news division this is rfk jr and he
[2:29:14.800 --> 2:29:20.000]  told me that during non-election years 70 percent of the advertising revenue for his news division
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:24.240]  comes from pharmaceutical ads and if you go on tv any night and watch the network news you'll see
[2:29:24.240 --> 2:29:28.720]  they just become a vehicle for selling pharmaceuticals see they didn't like donald trump because he
[2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:34.800]  didn't buy a lot of tv ads from him he spoke to you directly on twitter he didn't spend much money
[2:29:34.800 --> 2:29:38.240]  on tv they didn't like that set up a whole new pattern that's one of the things they didn't like
[2:29:38.240 --> 2:29:43.120]  about him but really the fact that they make so much of their money from pharmaceuticals that is
[2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:47.600]  a key thing we're going to be right back we're going to talk about climate change where it's going
[2:29:47.600 --> 2:29:55.680]  to be changing in the epa under a trump administration the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[2:29:55.680 --> 2:30:05.200]  network well trump called buzzfeed a bailing pile of garbage yesterday which will famously go down
[2:30:05.200 --> 2:30:09.840]  in history because they are the leakers of the dossier that john mccain supposedly gave to the
[2:30:09.840 --> 2:30:15.440]  fbi now buzzfeed could they be facing legal hot water for publishing this trump doc experts are
[2:30:15.440 --> 2:30:21.200]  saying yes the individual name in the documents may have caused to bring a libel suit against buzzfeed
[2:30:21.200 --> 2:30:25.920]  for publishing this ridiculous piece of fake news now we have an article that's up on our website
[2:30:25.920 --> 2:30:29.600]  it aggregated from the daily caller and it talks about how buzzfeed is weathering the quote
[2:30:29.600 --> 2:30:34.720]  criticism for publishing a document cache containing unsubstantiated and scandalous allegations
[2:30:34.720 --> 2:30:39.760]  about president elect trump and his confidants now this could mean serious legal consequences for
[2:30:39.760 --> 2:30:45.360]  the quote news organization and they went ahead and decided to publish the 35 page dossier claiming
[2:30:45.360 --> 2:30:50.480]  that russian operatives had compromised personal information about president elect trump and they
[2:30:50.480 --> 2:30:55.760]  were insinuating that the information is sexual in nature a really buzzfeed looks like you're

[2:33:11.120 --> 2:33:24.320]  the answer to 1984
[2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:38.160]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night and joining us in this segment is mark marano
[2:33:38.160 --> 2:33:43.600]  he's a producer of climate hustle he's also the publisher of climate depot that's a great source
[2:33:43.600 --> 2:33:50.400]  climate depot dot com a great source of information about global warming uh a eco news center it was
[2:33:50.400 --> 2:33:54.400]  founded back in 2009 and of course he's also communications director for the committee for
[2:33:54.400 --> 2:33:59.840]  constructive tomorrow executive editor and chief correspondent there at climate depot
[2:33:59.840 --> 2:34:07.040]  want to talk to him about where he sees uh the uh where he sees um the trump administration going
[2:34:07.040 --> 2:34:14.080]  with the epa as we have a uh nomination for the head of the epa by donald trump it's a former
[2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:21.200]  attorney general out of oklahoma and he has been one of the people at the forefront of challenging
[2:34:21.200 --> 2:34:28.240]  the power grabs of the epa and here's the latest one that happened today today we've had the epa
[2:34:28.240 --> 2:34:32.720]  now move after chrysler and instantly their stock dropped 15 percent because they know
[2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:39.280]  that this is going to be a lot of money this is the same thing they accused vw of last summer
[2:34:39.920 --> 2:34:48.800]  cheating cheating on their emissions tests okay now was anybody killed with this absolutely not
[2:34:48.800 --> 2:34:54.640]  in spite of the lies that we were told by lisa jackson and then congressman markey now senator
[2:34:54.640 --> 2:35:00.320]  markey nobody is dying from this stuff folks they're not dying we got an article here from
[2:35:00.320 --> 2:35:04.400]  climate depot where the new york times is saying is donald trump denies climate change these kids
[2:35:04.400 --> 2:35:10.480]  are dying from it that's seriously their headline no that's not true people aren't dying from this
[2:35:10.480 --> 2:35:13.440]  at the same time they were putting it out as i mentioned they were hooking people up
[2:35:14.320 --> 2:35:19.920]  trying to cheat on their test looking to see if they could get adverse reactions from people
[2:35:19.920 --> 2:35:24.720]  showing that uh diesel fuel was going to harm them they literally hooked people up at unc the
[2:35:24.720 --> 2:35:29.760]  university north carolina at chapel hill hooked them up to the tailpipes of diesel engines that's
[2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:34.800]  the kind of cheating that the epa does on their tests we tried to stop that we tried to get an
[2:35:34.800 --> 2:35:41.920]  injunction against it absolutely amazing that our own government wouldn't stop harmful testing
[2:35:41.920 --> 2:35:46.560]  on humans testing that was designed to make them sick so they could increase their regulation so
[2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:51.440]  they could grow their bureaucratic empire isn't that amazing i mean after tuskegee and all the
[2:35:51.440 --> 2:35:56.880]  other things that we've seen that they would allow that to continue to go on and yet they do
[2:35:56.880 --> 2:36:01.680]  and we see in the government do other types of testing releasing things in the new york subways
[2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:07.520]  but today we see the epa going after fiat crisis we got an article on info wars dot com from kit
[2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:12.640]  daniels they say you're trying to fool our emission test that's not nice remember as we go back
[2:36:12.640 --> 2:36:17.680]  remember we've had situations where there have been large fines a multi-million dollar fines
[2:36:17.680 --> 2:36:21.840]  i guess people like ford when they had the exploding pentos people would hit the pentos in the back
[2:36:21.840 --> 2:36:26.960]  and they would explode or they would have a situation where they had suv rollovers
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:30.560]  or they would have airbags that were killing small children and they wouldn't let you turn
[2:36:30.560 --> 2:36:35.040]  those off remember that then they've got millions of airbags are being recalled that have actually
[2:36:35.040 --> 2:36:41.600]  killed a lot of people because they have failed and go off and shoot metal fragments into you
[2:36:41.600 --> 2:36:45.360]  like a shotgun going off in your face and they've killed people so in all these cases
[2:36:45.920 --> 2:36:50.000]  the exploding pentos the suv is rolling over in the early days of suv is the airbags that killed
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:54.160]  small children the airbags that are killing people now that they won't let you turn off until you can
[2:36:54.160 --> 2:37:00.800]  get it replaced and all of these situations people have died nobody died from these emission
[2:37:00.800 --> 2:37:04.960]  scandals yet they're trying to put Volkswagen out of business and the reason they're doing it folks
[2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:09.600]  is not because they care about air quality they're using this just like they're using climate change
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:13.840]  to advance their globalist climate change agenda they have to have a global crisis
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:18.880]  so they can have a way to fund a global government and that's what's truly behind this
[2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:24.880]  now as this article from kit daniel they point out that if they beat a vw retroactively complies
[2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:30.720]  with this to fix these vehicles as eric peters points out he says the truly grotesque thing is
[2:37:30.720 --> 2:37:35.680]  that if the mileage drops as expected the cars that issue will emit more of the harmful emissions
[2:37:36.320 --> 2:37:40.080]  that they've been concerned about and that's what we've seen with the corporate cafe standards
[2:37:40.800 --> 2:37:46.000]  because they gave aids a differential when they created these things back in 1978 they gave a
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:53.040]  differential between cars and trucks people have started using trucks as cars because they one of
[2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:56.240]  the reasons is they can get bigger engines and they do other things with them and they aren't
[2:37:56.960 --> 2:38:02.400]  subject to these types of regulations and so what you wind up having is a situation where
[2:38:02.400 --> 2:38:09.840]  the total fuel economy has gone down because people have switched so let's go to uh mark morano i
[2:38:09.840 --> 2:38:13.280]  i didn't see him up on the uh board here i wasn't sure that we had connected with him but we now
[2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:18.720]  have uh mark morano producer of climate hustle and publisher of climate depot thank you for joining
[2:38:18.720 --> 2:38:26.000]  us mark thank you david happy to be here yes you're you're uh completely accurate about the epa and
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:31.760]  even worse than what you're describing like about the christler you know attacks by the epa and their
[2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:38.480]  alleged emissions violations the republican congress a few years back even under george bush
[2:38:38.480 --> 2:38:45.040]  they have statutorily killed the the suv in america unless donald trump's administration and
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:48.880]  the new congress tries to change it and what i mean by that is you mentioned the corporate
[2:38:48.880 --> 2:38:54.000]  average fuel economy standards they're trying to merge those or bring them in line with what
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:39:00.400]  vehicles have been which means we're talking about ford f-150 pickups jeeps everything else
[2:39:00.400 --> 2:39:05.920]  having to move to aluminum much lighter weight the shrinking the downsizing the reason people
[2:39:05.920 --> 2:39:11.920]  have always liked suvs are at threat uh and so that's one of the other things they're doing aside
[2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:17.120]  from hassling them with these emission uh alleged violations they're now coming after them for their
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:23.120]  weight size materials that they're made out of uh it's a way of essentially re-engineering
[2:39:23.680 --> 2:39:28.880]  american society in the face of global warming and they're doing this from everything from our
[2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:33.760]  light bulb to our appliances you know consumer reports even says that washing machine high end
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:38.720]  washing machines don't perform as well as low end washing machines of 15 years ago brand new ones
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:44.080]  because of all the energy department energy stars sucking all the available power out of these
[2:39:44.080 --> 2:39:49.520]  machines so they're forced to make them lighter light weight lighter duty uh it just goes on and
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:54.000]  on and it goes all the way up to our population whether we can eat beef our transportation
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:40:00.160]  carbon taxes so donald trump is probably the greatest threat to this agenda that's that's
[2:40:00.160 --> 2:40:05.040]  occurred in the history of the entire you know modern environmental movement since 1970
[2:40:05.040 --> 2:40:10.400]  oh absolutely as you point out even what we eat everything that they have put out here
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:15.680]  and there really is a globalist aspect to all this so we understand you've put together a list of
[2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:21.280]  back in 2008 you had a list even then of 650 plus scientists who were dissenting from this
[2:40:21.280 --> 2:40:27.600]  so-called science of uh man-made global warming uh i mean they like to say that there's nobody
[2:40:27.600 --> 2:40:33.200]  that dissents from this it's a settled issue we can't even talk about it because when they get
[2:40:33.200 --> 2:40:37.920]  put up against the facts they don't want to debate them they just resort to censorship resort to the
[2:40:37.920 --> 2:40:42.800]  idea of arguing from authority and so it's great when you put together a list of people like that
[2:40:42.800 --> 2:40:48.960]  we just had a professor from georgia tech saying i can't take this anymore i've got too many knives
[2:40:48.960 --> 2:40:53.040]  in my back i'm getting out of this business they don't want to hear it and yet we see them turn
[2:40:53.040 --> 2:40:58.480]  this around and say isn't this horrible donald trump wants to know what these people's position
[2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:02.960]  in the epa is on climate change he's going to do some kind of a purge well they've been doing a purge
[2:41:02.960 --> 2:41:07.600]  a political purge along with this stuff we're trying to get a situation where we got uh real
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:13.280]  science done and this is not about real science this is about pushing an agenda and not allowing
[2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:18.160]  other people to push back against it yeah if you mentioned that jaded curry is this climatologist
[2:41:18.160 --> 2:41:24.480]  from georgia tech she's featured in climate hustle uh my film which is out this year with 2016 it came
[2:41:24.480 --> 2:41:28.960]  out and it's actually we're going to be making it available very shortly with al gore's sequel
[2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:32.800]  coming out here in a couple weeks and of course i'll tell people too they can get climate hustle we
[2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:36.960]  sell that in our store so i'll give that a plug here there you see it yes you can buy that at
[2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:42.640]  info war store a great a great film thank you very much yeah and with jaded curry the climatologist
[2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:46.720]  who just resigned she was a tenured professor she just had it she used to be the chair of
[2:41:46.720 --> 2:41:51.840]  her department uh the climatology department of georgia tech and she basically said that she
[2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:57.920]  cannot play this game anymore and what happened was she was a former believer for lack of a better
[2:41:57.920 --> 2:42:03.040]  word you know of the global warming science lined herself with united nations climate view
[2:42:03.040 --> 2:42:06.880]  and then we had the big climate gate scandal and then she started questioning and then she's
[2:42:06.880 --> 2:42:13.360]  become essentially a full-blown skeptic now and because of that she has been faced vilification
[2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:18.320]  from her peers she's all kinds of difficulty getting published she talks about how the the
[2:42:18.320 --> 2:42:23.360]  publishing of climate studies comes from universities and foundations and the government
[2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:27.920]  they only want funding that goes one direction in other words if you want to get funding and have
[2:42:27.920 --> 2:42:32.640]  a career as a climate scientist you better toe the line that our politicians and our culture
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:37.200]  is demanding the global warming is dangerous and we need more central planning a government to solve
[2:42:37.200 --> 2:42:42.640]  it otherwise you can't play you can't be a scientist and that's that's what we're facing here and we
[2:42:42.640 --> 2:42:48.800]  have robert f kennedy jr calling for climate skeptics to be thrown in jail bill nye the science guy
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:54.080]  thinks that's a great idea too we have him on videos talking about what a great idea
[2:42:54.080 --> 2:43:00.320]  and how is there skeptics affecting or affecting his quality of life bill nye and by the way global
[2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:05.600]  warming people have blamed the drought in california and global warming now thank god they're actually
[2:43:05.600 --> 2:43:11.520]  getting enough rains and precipitation to actually recover from the drought almost completely now
[2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:16.160]  they're saying that the floods in california are caused by global warming anything bad yeah
[2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:21.040]  playing floods and droughts and hurricanes and tornadoes on global war global cooling in the
[2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:27.200]  1970s there's no consistency here whatsoever you just mentioned rfk jr and i said i was talking
[2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:32.880]  about him in the segment before you came on about vaccines now trump may use him to reveal the truth
[2:43:32.880 --> 2:43:37.680]  about vaccines and about pharmaceutical industries but i think that's a genius of what trump has been
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:42.800]  doing as he's been picking these cabinet positions we look at him it's like oh look at what this guy
[2:43:42.800 --> 2:43:47.120]  said about this and it's like oh that's very inconsistent with what trump has said and yet
[2:43:47.120 --> 2:43:53.920]  he's picking people who will work with him on particular issues like that they share a point
[2:43:53.920 --> 2:44:01.760]  of view on like he does with rfk jr on vaccines and yet when it comes to the epa head he goes and
[2:44:01.760 --> 2:44:06.480]  gets somebody that the new york times is just flipping out they call him a climate change
[2:44:06.480 --> 2:44:11.360]  denialist and and that's the key thing is that they don't talk about you as being a skeptic if
[2:44:11.360 --> 2:44:15.680]  you don't agree with them they talk about you as being a denialist so you're not you're denying
[2:44:15.680 --> 2:44:20.480]  their religion you are an infidel i guess we should embrace it as as uh you and i are climate
[2:44:20.480 --> 2:44:25.920]  change infidels aren't we mark that's right yeah they say you know when we say oh you they
[2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:30.080]  michael critan the famous author and said the global warming is a religion environment and they
[2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:34.560]  always say oh no no it's not but then we find out the head of the united nations climate panel a
[2:44:34.560 --> 2:44:41.280]  man named regenda patchari when he stepped down over a sexual uh harassment scandal he actually
[2:44:41.280 --> 2:44:47.680]  said quote global warming is my religion unquote yes so we know what is motivating these people and
[2:44:47.680 --> 2:44:51.840]  you're absolutely right donald trump is doing amazing you could never get and here's what i
[2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:57.360]  never understood about the never trumpers who alleged to be conservatives if you get all the
[2:44:57.360 --> 2:45:03.040]  previous republican nominees since reagan you have george hw bush who was an absolute disaster
[2:45:03.040 --> 2:45:08.240]  when it came to climate change issues in the united nations and environmentalism he set up
[2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:14.560]  the entire un foundation for the global warming treaties with the real earth summit in 1992
[2:45:14.560 --> 2:45:19.040]  you have bob dole who was so weak on these issues you can't even really comment he was just sort of
[2:45:19.040 --> 2:45:24.240]  it was his turn so they nominated him you have john mccain uh who was nominated 2008 and he was
[2:45:24.240 --> 2:45:30.400]  actually a um uh sponsor of these climate bills you have george w bush who rubber stamped every
[2:45:30.400 --> 2:45:36.320]  un report kept the funding coming and uh and and literally accepted all the science and never
[2:45:36.320 --> 2:45:41.440]  except a skeptical word out of his mouth so george w bush did that then you admit romney who had many
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:46.080]  of obama's advisors working for him so when he comes to donald trump particularly on environment
[2:45:46.080 --> 2:45:51.520]  and climate he has the greatest breath of fresh air of any republican nominee that you could even
[2:45:51.520 --> 2:45:57.280]  conceive of that's why they hate him so much on this issue just as on other issues he's the only one
[2:45:57.280 --> 2:46:02.800]  who is not in league with both the republican and the democrat establishment as you just ran down
[2:46:02.800 --> 2:46:06.960]  that list of former presidents and presidential candidates i mean look at mit romney he was
[2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:11.760]  with obama on obama care they were they were going to get that through after the 2012 election
[2:46:11.760 --> 2:46:16.160]  regardless of which way it went he had already put that through with uh ted kennedy in mass
[2:46:16.160 --> 2:46:21.120] achusetts they put in romney care which was fundamentally the same thing as obama care so
[2:46:21.120 --> 2:46:26.320]  they know how to get their people in on both republican and the democrat ticket and this time
[2:46:26.320 --> 2:46:32.400]  through donald trump broke through that and he is coming from the point of view that the rest of us
[2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:36.880]  are looking at to try to break this lock on power that both the democrat and republican
[2:46:36.880 --> 2:46:42.400]  establishment have had yeah and i think if you go back this is probably the most successful if
[2:46:42.400 --> 2:46:47.760]  anyone can actually measure success of a president elect term meaning this is the most successful
[2:46:47.760 --> 2:46:54.480]  president elect uh period that we've ever had i mean this is just a phenomenal time here's if
[2:46:54.480 --> 2:46:59.760]  any republican had doubts or hesitation about donald trump yesterday they were removed when
[2:46:59.760 --> 2:47:05.360]  he stared at the cnn reporter and actually said you are fake news wasn't a great moment conceivable
[2:47:05.360 --> 2:47:10.080]  of even ronald reagan to go that far yeah this is that's what i was just gonna say you know
[2:47:10.080 --> 2:47:15.200]  ronald reagan really in the in the primaries the moment that ronald reagan had if you remember
[2:47:15.200 --> 2:47:21.040]  was when he stood up and he said i paid for this microphone remember that and he and he took charge
[2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:25.200]  you know he was he was right and he stood up he wasn't going to be he wasn't going to be cowed
[2:47:25.200 --> 2:47:29.200]  down by these people he stood up for what was right and he showed that he had a backbone and boy i
[2:47:29.200 --> 2:47:32.880]  tell you what if you didn't know that donald trump had a backbone and you didn't know that he was
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:38.320]  going to stand up by now you saw that yesterday and boy he was absolutely right to shut down that
[2:47:38.320 --> 2:47:43.760]  guy a costa from cnn the arrogance and the sense of entitlement that that guy had shouting at him
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:48.240]  and saying you know you you can't do this it's like yeah just watch me i mean it was amazing yes
[2:47:48.240 --> 2:47:54.240]  and yeah and so what what this does is because donald trump literally doesn't care and the next
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:47:59.440]  thing i'd like to see trump do by the way is in the press room right now the whole first row of
[2:47:59.440 --> 2:48:05.440]  the white house press room is reserved for the you know the usual suspects abc nbc peter cnn they
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:11.280]  need to clear all that out and replace it you know with all the new sources of news and and and just
[2:48:11.280 --> 2:48:15.440]  say goodbye to them maybe give them one cheer they can rotate you can call them the quirky
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:20.480]  alternative media or something like that but they deserve not one ounce of respect their entire
[2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:24.720]  mission right now is to impeach donald trump and they're going to be working with every
[2:48:24.720 --> 2:48:29.680]  enemy that of donald trump to try to bring his presidency down as this most recent ridiculous
[2:48:29.680 --> 2:48:34.320]  news story for you know that they tried to pass from buzzfeed and cnn but i think what's most
[2:48:34.320 --> 2:48:40.160]  important here when it comes to these issues of climate and environment republicans in fact every
[2:48:40.160 --> 2:48:45.600]  former i believe almost every single former republican epa director came out and supported president
[2:48:45.600 --> 2:48:51.200]  obama's uh climate policies his climate regulations through the epa that's what they did with the
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:56.160]  client with the paris uh agreement just last year they go over there and their posturing say well
[2:48:56.160 --> 2:48:59.120]  we're gonna have something to say about it and what they did was they immediately within three
[2:48:59.120 --> 2:49:03.760]  days with their omnibus they funded it the republican funded it so yeah all these former
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:08.240]  directors what happens is when republicans get an office for republican presidents and
[2:49:08.240 --> 2:49:12.320]  obviously senators and congressmen they don't want to be seen as against the environment i
[2:49:12.320 --> 2:49:16.560]  worked in the environment of public works committee i would see great conservative senators top staff
[2:49:16.560 --> 2:49:20.960]  show up at meetings and say we got to be careful we can't we can't look like we're against the
[2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:25.200]  environment when it comes to this climate bill coming up they're just be they'd be no backbone
[2:49:25.200 --> 2:49:30.160]  and they would not accept the premise that that the the the climate activists in the united nations
[2:49:30.160 --> 2:49:35.840]  have given us the information they admit it's we are the top un official named auto edenhofer
[2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:40.720]  uh actually says the vice chair of this climate panel actually say it's not about environmental
[2:49:40.720 --> 2:49:45.920]  policy we will redistribute wealth by climate policy this is no longer about the environment
[2:49:45.920 --> 2:49:50.960]  they're actually open about what they want to do they talk openly of global governance in the film
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:56.000]  climate hustle we actually have al gore talking about that you know climate bills are lead to
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:59.920]  global governance that's what they're looking for essentially plan thing where we had nancy
[2:49:59.920 --> 2:50:05.760]  pelosi went to china in 2009 and she said we need a complete inventory on every aspect of our lives
[2:50:05.760 --> 2:50:10.640]  in order to fight global warming and they've got every aspect of our lives covered from our home
[2:50:10.640 --> 2:50:15.840]  thermostat to our vehicles to our appliances to light bulbs to what we eat to how we travel to
[2:50:15.840 --> 2:50:21.840]  how we live to our energy choices even down and we actually in the film feature the most frightening
[2:50:21.840 --> 2:50:27.760]  thing at all an nyu professor talking about how we're gonna genetically shrink human beings
[2:50:27.760 --> 2:50:32.240]  genetic engineering to solve global warming and give us and give skeptics and people who
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:38.080]  don't want to go along uh psychiatric drugs and make them more malleable to the government agenda
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:43.840]  i mean this is not something people should be uh not angry that's right it's not just our jobs
[2:50:43.840 --> 2:50:49.280]  it's not just our standard of living it's also life expectancy and it is globalism it's them
[2:50:49.280 --> 2:50:53.680]  taking over control of our economy and if they say it's a global situation why are they giving
[2:50:53.680 --> 2:50:57.120]  exemptions to china on this stay with us you're gonna be right back with mark marino

[2:55:29.840 --> 2:55:35.120]  those and put it in your kids backpack because that's the world the democrats have created for us
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:41.440]  also we're talking to mark morano and he has created a film climate hustle that is also
[2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:47.040]  available at the info wars store and mark you know one of the things i see here is uh
[2:55:47.040 --> 2:55:50.640]  the new york times bragging about the sundance film festival and the fact that the theme this
[2:55:50.640 --> 2:55:54.960]  year is climate change and of course robert redford just tells us that just happens to be
[2:55:54.960 --> 2:56:00.800]  coincidental we'd like to stay free of politics he said and yet the key thing that they're promoting
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:07.760]  is the next al gore convenient lie and then convenient sequel so if people want to have
[2:56:08.400 --> 2:56:14.960]  the information that they can show people to counter al gore's propaganda film i think they
[2:56:14.960 --> 2:56:21.440]  really need to see your opposing view and that is climate depot you know we we don't have a problem
[2:56:21.440 --> 2:56:25.440]  arguing our point of view with these other people they're the ones who are trying to shut down in
[2:56:25.440 --> 2:56:29.920]  a discussion of this are the ones who are trying to censor it at academia but we want to have that
[2:56:29.920 --> 2:56:36.800]  debate yeah we absolutely do in fact the film is interesting because it actually profiles left
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:42.880]  wing politically left wing scientists who endorse president obama who voted for al gore but are
[2:56:42.880 --> 2:56:48.800]  appalled by their science views we have a professor and we go through that whole thing to show that
[2:56:48.800 --> 2:56:53.360]  it's the left wing now that is examining it and they believe that essentially global warming has
[2:56:53.360 --> 2:56:57.760]  hijacked the real environmental movement the real environmental movement used to be so concerned
[2:56:57.760 --> 2:57:04.080]  about clean air clean water conservation and now it's all arguing about you know these arcane
[2:57:04.080 --> 2:57:10.080]  arguments about how much co2 is in the atmosphere and we show in the film that geologically speaking
[2:57:10.080 --> 2:57:15.120]  the earth is in a co2 famine in other words co2 is in their all-time lows and the earth is one
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:19.040]  of the coldest temperatures it's ever been we've been very few periods in our earth's history
[2:57:19.040 --> 2:57:24.080]  have we had ice at both poles so yeah we're in the 10 coldest part of the earth's history
[2:57:24.080 --> 2:57:29.600]  uh living right now so the idea that we are control we are the control knob of the climate
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:34.560]  does not hold up and bill nye just recently said that we basically need the un climate treaty so
[2:57:34.560 --> 2:57:39.760]  that we'll have less droughts they these these liberals actually believe that epa regulations
[2:57:39.760 --> 2:57:45.520]  and un treaties can control the earth's thermostat hurricanes tornadoes it's it's it's just a it's
[2:57:45.520 --> 2:57:50.960]  beyond absurd it's akin to old witchcraft that they believe legislation can alter the weather
[2:57:50.960 --> 2:57:54.560]  and they believe you know with used to believe witches can alter the weather it's amazing you
[2:57:54.560 --> 2:57:59.440]  know as like i said yesterday uh mark it's like these guys flip the coin you know heads it's gonna
[2:57:59.440 --> 2:58:04.480]  warm tails it's kind of cool they made they made the wrong call you know when they started out the
[2:58:04.480 --> 2:58:08.240]  first earth they they were telling us what we're heading into a new site new ice age and then
[2:58:08.240 --> 2:58:12.400]  they flipped it and went the other direction you know but now they've been shown that that's not
[2:58:12.400 --> 2:58:17.120]  working either all their predictions all their dire predictions have fallen uh on the on the
[2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:23.920]  ground and i think it's very important for people to get your film again that's a climate hustle we
[2:58:23.920 --> 2:58:30.320]  sell it at info wars store it's a great thing you need to have this debate folks and i always

[2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:37.600]  them had to say and then make up my mind and we want to have that debate thank you so much

[3:00:38.480 --> 3:00:44.160]  been a frequent guest here and of course he uh frequently hosts the fourth hour here at info wars
[3:00:44.160 --> 3:00:50.320]  also he's been a frequent contributor to articles as well and his site is no more fake news dot com
[3:00:50.320 --> 3:00:57.680]  and john uh fake news is everywhere and we've had donald trump in a big way call out cnn for just
[3:00:57.680 --> 3:01:04.400]  exactly what they were yesterday fake news and alex jones put out a report yesterday saying mark
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:11.120]  this date this is the date that it essentially we remove the mask from these people we've now had
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:17.280]  the president point out that the press emperors have no clothes they got caught with their hands down
[3:01:17.280 --> 3:01:23.120]  on this filthy false made-up report that they put out there i think pierce morgan said it great when
[3:01:23.120 --> 3:01:28.400]  he said look the only prostitutes involved here are the ones who are journalists uh in this so
[3:01:28.400 --> 3:01:33.920]  your your comments on this john well that's what i was going to lead with actually because i agree
[3:01:33.920 --> 3:01:44.640]  yesterday was mark it down folks because this wasn't just somebody saying guess what fake news
[3:01:45.440 --> 3:01:54.960]  this is a president-elect press conference never happened before in modern history president-elect
[3:01:54.960 --> 3:02:02.960]  gets up and says directly to a reporter fake news your outlet is fake news and he also said
[3:02:02.960 --> 3:02:09.680]  trump did there's several other of you fake news outlets right here sitting down front right so
[3:02:10.320 --> 3:02:16.560]  the war continues uh in case people thought that when trump was elected uh he was just going to
[3:02:16.560 --> 3:02:23.440]  back off and make nice and say we're all friends and it's all great no no no no no because they
[3:02:23.440 --> 3:02:29.280]  kept shooting at him and so now they can feel the heat and they can understand what's happening
[3:02:29.280 --> 3:02:33.920]  i think everybody is appalled not only at the the way they put this story together
[3:02:34.960 --> 3:02:40.320]  but also at that press conference where he's demanding that that donald trump talked to him
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:45.360]  donald trump is going to talk to morray liason and uh you know she's establishment media and he's
[3:02:45.360 --> 3:02:50.640]  pointing to her and this guy is shouting at trump demanding i have got a a sense of entitlement here
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:56.880]  yeah you can't do that and it's like no actually i can you don't really understand who is in control
[3:02:56.880 --> 3:03:03.680]  here and i thought that was a amazing moment to not only call them out on their lies on their deceit
[3:03:03.680 --> 3:03:08.480]  on their being the prostitutes for these people behind all of this who are trying to take down
[3:03:08.480 --> 3:03:13.040]  donald trump because they're part of the global elite establishment and they understand that he's
[3:03:13.040 --> 3:03:18.640]  not with them but i think it was it was just an amazing visual for people to see the arrogance
[3:03:18.640 --> 3:03:24.720]  of the media there the arrogance of cnn didn't he say this is inappropriate yeah exactly lecturing
[3:03:24.720 --> 3:03:31.200]  him like this is inappropriate it's like goodbye as if he expected you know suddenly everything
[3:03:31.200 --> 3:03:37.920]  to stop and people would say my goodness sakes my man you're right it is inappropriate and we
[3:03:37.920 --> 3:03:48.880]  apologize we'll back off let's now do an appropriate dialogue did not happen oh amazing amazing
[3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:54.000]  well what have you got for us that coming up in the fourth hour john oh well we're going to talk
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:04:00.800]  more about the press conference i'm looking at my notes here how trump actually broke into this
[3:04:01.840 --> 3:04:08.560]  monopoly of media what he did yeah he really transcended them didn't he i did it with with
[3:04:08.560 --> 3:04:13.600]  social media you know ronald reagan always said he was going to go over the heads of the media
[3:04:13.600 --> 3:04:18.320]  and everything he didn't really have the tools to do something like that but donald trump
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:22.960]  had the tools he had the guts to do it he actually made it come true and i think we're going to
[3:04:22.960 --> 3:04:26.320]  continue to see this he's not going to be held captive by these people he's not going to be held
[3:04:26.320 --> 3:04:30.960]  captive by their their press releases he may even go to a situation where he doesn't have these normal
[3:04:30.960 --> 3:04:35.520]  press conferences i hope so yeah i hope so good all right well i'm going to sign out and we're
[3:04:35.520 --> 3:04:40.560]  going to turn this broadcast over to john rapopores and good hands thank you so much john and we'll
[3:04:40.560 --> 3:04:56.480]  be right back with john rapopore
[3:05:00.000 --> 3:05:04.320]  well one senator from kentucky rand paul thinks that the trump intel leaker should
[3:05:04.320 --> 3:05:09.360]  quote go to jail and whoever leaked it should be prosecuted kentucky senator rand paul said on
[3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:13.760]  wednesday of this week those responsible for leaking the intel pertaining to donald trump
[3:05:13.760 --> 3:05:18.880]  whether fake or not should be prosecuted and jailed he said quote what i want to say is if
[3:05:18.880 --> 3:05:23.120]  there's private information that someone is blackmailing a public figure and a public figure or
[3:05:23.120 --> 3:05:28.160]  someone takes it to the intelligence agencies you would think it would be private and really this
[3:05:28.160 --> 3:05:33.200]  is so important that i think whoever leaked it should be prosecuted he told this to neil kovidov
[3:05:33.200 --> 3:05:38.880]  fox news saying someone should go to jail if this was an intelligence agency heard talked the media
[3:05:38.880 --> 3:05:43.600]  they should go to jail well you know what senator i couldn't agree with you more frankly we understand
[3:05:43.600 --> 3:05:48.720]  that it's a steaming pile of garbage for those that may not this is still information that is
[3:05:48.720 --> 3:05:54.320]  pertaining to a public figure that's quote used to blackmail him so somebody should be held responsible

[3:08:24.640 --> 3:08:31.280]  here welcome good to be here as always i've got to start by talking about climate hustle here
[3:08:31.280 --> 3:08:38.320]  which uh david was talking about in the last hour with mark marano of climate depot climate hustle
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:48.080]  is the film info wars store dot com is where you can get it here's the story folks look
[3:08:50.080 --> 3:09:01.440]  the whole climate agenda predicate on this idea that based on fake science which is revealed
[3:09:01.440 --> 3:09:11.120]  in climate hustle presidents leaders monarchs oligarchs you you name it deletes around the
[3:09:11.120 --> 3:09:19.680]  world can say to their people and can rule on this that we are going to cut energy production in our
[3:09:19.680 --> 3:09:29.760]  country figures have been touted for the u.s at 20 to 30 percent cut in the next 10 to 15 years
[3:09:29.760 --> 3:09:36.400]  because you see we're bringing online solar and wind and this and that and you know all of that
[3:09:36.960 --> 3:09:45.200]  kind of malarkey to replace the co2 emitting energy that we are now using but we have to
[3:09:45.200 --> 3:09:52.400]  cut energy production period 20 to 30 percent right so this is what's behind this whole agenda
[3:09:52.400 --> 3:10:01.120]  well what does that mean can you figure out what that means if you were the king and you said my
[3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:06.400]  people we are going to cut energy production throughout the whole land by 20 to 30 percent
[3:10:07.920 --> 3:10:12.320]  well that means you're going to torpedo the economy let's wake up to that let's get it
[3:10:12.320 --> 3:10:19.200]  straight please once and for all you're going to put more and more people into pain suffering
[3:10:19.200 --> 3:10:24.400]  and poverty and the people who are already there are going to be feeling it even worse
[3:10:26.160 --> 3:10:33.040]  but everybody is going to be affected significantly that's the agenda that's what
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:42.080]  we're talking about fake science leading to diminishment of energy production by a whole lot
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:47.760]  all over the world and this is supposed to save the planet of course from frying and so forth because
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:59.040]  we'll have less co2 so this sham of science has a reason it's not just an academic piece of fraud
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:05.840]  this is what we're talking about here because globalism elite globalism is in the business
[3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:13.520]  of torpedoing economies that's what they do that's what they want they don't want to create jobs
[3:11:13.520 --> 3:11:23.440]  because in the midst of the chaos and the desecration and the destitution created by the
[3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:29.520]  lowering of energy production then the elite can say well my goodness gracious we have a horrible
[3:11:29.520 --> 3:11:36.720]  crisis here and we need to do something and here's the plan that will save us all and of course in
[3:11:36.720 --> 3:11:42.800]  order to put this plan into effect we have to have representatives from every nation on earth
[3:11:42.800 --> 3:11:48.720]  who represent the best interests of the people to put the plan into action and then it turns out
[3:11:48.720 --> 3:11:54.320]  of course that these representatives are not representatives at all they are trilateral
[3:11:54.320 --> 3:12:00.880]  commission members council on foreign relations members all of the globalist organizations
[3:12:00.880 --> 3:12:08.960]  Bilderberg you name it and they become the global management system that is the new world order and
[3:12:08.960 --> 3:12:19.200]  sovereign nations cease to exist because it's a planetary crisis the loss of energy where
[3:12:19.200 --> 3:12:26.240]  did that come from it came from the same people who are now presenting the plan to rescue everybody
[3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:33.040]  let's get it straight please please please please please climate hustle
[3:12:33.040 --> 3:12:42.160]  will show you a great deal of what has been happening here including fake science
[3:12:43.280 --> 3:12:54.720]  info wars store.com mark morano climate depot.com thank you mark okay trumps press conference
[3:12:54.720 --> 3:13:08.160]  yesterday he says to cnn reporter cnn is fake news he says there are a few other fake news
[3:13:08.160 --> 3:13:12.960]  outlets sitting here today too there's the next president of the united states
[3:13:15.280 --> 3:13:21.520]  i've been a reporter now for 34 years never seen anything like this never ever
[3:13:21.520 --> 3:13:30.880]  i implore you to understand the magnitude of what happened there the extreme magnitude
[3:13:31.440 --> 3:13:38.240]  of what happened yesterday at the press conference a president-elect going to war
[3:13:38.240 --> 3:13:46.400]  with the major media which has been traditionally the eyes ears nose mouth everything of society
[3:13:46.400 --> 3:13:54.640]  presenting fake news endlessly confusing everybody putting everybody to sleep covering
[3:13:54.640 --> 3:14:04.560]  up and omitting the true deep political events of our time if we're going to have a revolution
[3:14:04.560 --> 3:14:10.720]  and we're in the middle of one right now then the first order of business is overtaking and
[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:19.440]  overthrowing fake news by which i mean major media that's the first order of business and
[3:14:19.440 --> 3:14:26.320]  that is happening and now we had yesterday a president-elect i don't care what you think of them
[3:14:27.920 --> 3:14:36.080]  getting up and saying directly to these news guys you're fake and in case you didn't understand
[3:14:36.080 --> 3:14:42.960]  what i was saying you're fake and if you need any further clarification on that you're fake
[3:14:44.320 --> 3:14:46.080]  you are fake
[3:14:51.280 --> 3:14:57.440]  i mean you can't overstate the significance of that event no matter how much you try
[3:14:58.800 --> 3:15:03.920]  and i'll tell you something else too and this goes to the point of what some of you think of
[3:15:03.920 --> 3:15:10.640]  trump and others think of trump and so on and so forth this guy broke into the scene
[3:15:12.240 --> 3:15:17.360]  like some kind of a swaggering cowboy walking into the saloon in a western b movie
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:23.840]  steps up to the bar and says give me a double whiskey looks around and says
[3:15:24.800 --> 3:15:31.040]  man this is a foul place who are these people that are inhabiting it
[3:15:31.040 --> 3:15:39.120]  it and everybody looks at him who is this guy where did he come from how did he break in
[3:15:40.800 --> 3:15:46.880]  what is he talking about how dare he say these things about our sacred heart and home
[3:15:47.520 --> 3:15:51.680]  you know the saloon where all the news really happens in town
[3:15:51.680 --> 3:15:58.160]  so my contention is and it's correct
[3:15:59.840 --> 3:16:06.080]  that some people would have preferred to have another candidate quote destroy major media
[3:16:06.080 --> 3:16:11.760]  oh well we would have liked it if somebody had you know been more polite and been more
[3:16:12.320 --> 3:16:18.080]  cute and been more measured and so forth and subrational so
[3:16:18.080 --> 3:16:25.440]  uh no no no no no that wasn't going to work people have tried that as david pointed out
[3:16:25.440 --> 3:16:33.520]  reagan tried that didn't work ron paul tried that didn't work ross pro made a few dents didn't work
[3:16:33.520 --> 3:16:41.920]  though trump made it work exactly because of his persona and his personality and his character
[3:16:41.920 --> 3:16:49.600]  so i don't care what you think of him he broke through a revolution that was already in progress
[3:16:49.600 --> 3:16:55.920]  which is overthrowing major media and he gave it the kind of boost that you can only do with
[3:16:55.920 --> 3:17:01.840]  rocket fuel and you can only do with that kind of personality that just doesn't care that's
[3:17:01.840 --> 3:17:08.960]  completely reckless that can dismiss a mainstream reporter with a look who can say you know what
[3:17:08.960 --> 3:17:16.640]  you're an idiot you're a complete idiot and your news outlet is failing completely
[3:17:18.720 --> 3:17:24.240]  and it works my mind that's inappropriate and we don't like that mr trump and you
[3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:29.920]  shouldn't i don't care what you think you're an idiot you're wrong most of the time you're
[3:17:29.920 --> 3:17:37.920]  wrong and that's why your news outlet is going down the toilet and all of a sudden this has
[3:17:37.920 --> 3:17:43.360]  legs this works people are waking up and saying well that's what i thought millions of people are
[3:17:43.360 --> 3:17:47.840]  saying well i've been thinking that for years i mean can't we get these idiots off the air
[3:17:47.840 --> 3:17:51.840]  and stop reading these crazy newspapers like the new york times and the washington post
[3:17:52.560 --> 3:17:59.440]  please can we do it and trump is basically saying yeah of course we can do it of course
[3:17:59.440 --> 3:18:05.680]  we can do it of course we can do it and so they're trying to defame him and destroy him
[3:18:05.680 --> 3:18:12.080]  in every way possible with as many fake stories they can put together but basically what the media
[3:18:12.080 --> 3:18:20.000]  are saying is we're fine we've always been fine there's nothing wrong with us we always tell the
[3:18:20.000 --> 3:18:29.440]  truth this guy is the problem this guy is the guy who's pretending to be president who's illegitimate
[3:18:29.440 --> 3:18:36.000]  and we are going to do everything we can to delegitimize him to take the attention off of us
[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:43.520]  he's a fake president he isn't real he's a delusion everybody's dreaming this didn't happen
[3:18:43.520 --> 3:18:50.320]  this election never took place we your news media friends are fine and
[3:18:50.320 --> 3:18:59.760]  and upstanding and resolute and truthful and honest as we've always been he is the faker and
[3:18:59.760 --> 3:19:06.160]  it's not working hasn't worked for the last year and it's getting worse for them getting absolutely
[3:19:06.160 --> 3:19:15.360]  worse for them trump is like the guy to use another metaphor you're on a football team
[3:19:15.360 --> 3:19:21.520]  let's say college team is not doing very well scholarships everybody's on scholarship but
[3:19:21.520 --> 3:19:26.640]  you know it's not happening and then all of a sudden one day this guy swagger's onto the field
[3:19:26.640 --> 3:19:32.640]  and says i'm the greatest football player that ever lived and everybody starts laughing at him
[3:19:32.640 --> 3:19:39.280]  come on so forth and so and he said let me show you so he takes the ball and he runs through
[3:19:39.280 --> 3:19:45.920]  15 tacklers and destroys them that's what's happening i'll have more after the break here

[3:26:01.280 --> 3:26:10.960]  what i can do for you you're now one in six having a real losing season in fact you're a bunch of
[3:26:10.960 --> 3:26:18.240]  losers right this doesn't go over too well with the team you're out there you're on the team
[3:26:18.240 --> 3:26:26.000]  you're out there on the field it's been a pathetic season and the coach says all right mr smarty pants

[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:43.280]  knock them down quarterback takes the ball gives it to this swaggering cowboy character trump
[3:26:44.560 --> 3:26:53.520]  and no blocking for him no blocking no interference no help he smashes through the line and knocks six
[3:26:53.520 --> 3:26:57.680]  guys down and goes all the way to the end zone and he stands there and he looks back and he says
[3:26:57.680 --> 3:27:05.440]  see what i mean it works it works you don't have to be losers anymore we're going to have a good team
[3:27:05.440 --> 3:27:11.520]  here and he does it three or four more times and people go holy mackerel look what's happening here
[3:27:11.520 --> 3:27:19.760]  how did this go from nothing to where we are now this is what happened he came in looked at the
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:27.760]  media and said you're a bunch of losers you're idiots oh i've never heard anything like that in my
[3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:34.400]  life that's right you haven't but now you are and millions of people started cheering immediately
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:42.080]  because as i said they've been thinking the same thing exactly the same thing and then yesterday
[3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:48.960]  at his first press conference as president elect he doubled down he doubled down in front of a
[3:27:48.960 --> 3:27:56.400]  national global audience he looked at what was the guy's name jim acosta and he said
[3:27:57.680 --> 3:28:05.200]  your outlet cnn is fake news and there's a few more of you fake news outlets sitting right here
[3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:15.280]  this was unheard of absolutely unheard of so here's the point the movement the people who
[3:28:15.280 --> 3:28:22.000]  want freedom and who want truth who are many of whom have supported trump but many of whom not
[3:28:23.120 --> 3:28:31.680]  maybe they didn't support anybody an opening a further opening in the war the info war has been
[3:28:32.560 --> 3:28:40.960]  produced by trump that's the fact do with it what you will i don't care what you think about trump
[3:28:40.960 --> 3:28:49.920]  that's a fact and we are making tremendous hay as a result of that because people are waking up
[3:28:49.920 --> 3:28:57.360]  and saying well this is fake news from mbc and that's fake news from cbs and by the way when we
[3:28:57.360 --> 3:29:05.840]  look at these outlets isn't a guy named david roads the president of cbs news and isn't his
[3:29:05.840 --> 3:29:16.640]  brother ben roads his brother obama's deputy national security advisor for communication
[3:29:16.640 --> 3:29:23.840]  strategic communications how did that happen how did that happen that sounds like fake news to me
[3:29:25.600 --> 3:29:34.800]  how did a guy named carlos slim get to be the principal investor in the world's most
[3:29:34.800 --> 3:29:42.000]  honored newspaper the new york times how did that happen you ought to read up on carlos slim
[3:29:42.720 --> 3:29:47.360]  check him out we'll be back after the break down wrapping what i did before
[3:29:49.360 --> 3:29:56.080]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:56.080 --> 3:30:05.120]  well trump called buzzfeed a failing pile of garbage yesterday which will famously go down
[3:30:05.120 --> 3:30:09.760]  in history because they are the leakers of the dossier that john McCain supposedly gave to the
[3:30:09.760 --> 3:30:15.360]  fbi now buzzfeed could they be facing legal hot water for publishing this trump doc experts are
[3:30:15.360 --> 3:30:21.120]  saying yes the individual name of the documents may have caused to bring a libel suit against buzzfeed
[3:30:21.120 --> 3:30:25.840]  for publishing this ridiculous piece of fake news now we have an article that's up on our website
[3:30:25.840 --> 3:30:29.600]  it aggregated from the daily caller and it talks about how buzzfeed is weathering the quote
[3:30:29.600 --> 3:30:34.640]  criticism for publishing a document cache containing unsubstantiated and scandalous allegations
[3:30:34.640 --> 3:30:39.760]  about president elect trump and his confidants now this could mean serious legal consequences for
[3:30:39.760 --> 3:30:45.280]  the quote news organization and they went ahead and decided to publish the 35 page dossier claiming
[3:30:45.280 --> 3:30:50.320]  that russian operatives had compromised personal information about president elect trump and
[3:30:50.320 --> 3:30:55.520]  they were insinuating that the information is sexual in nature oh really buzzfeed looks like
[3:30:55.520 --> 3:31:01.040]  you're going down i'm margaret helve reporting for info wars dot com it's not just our water we
[3:31:01.040 --> 3:31:05.760]  need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing especially
[3:31:05.760 --> 3:31:12.160]  for our children the artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune
[3:31:12.160 --> 3:31:17.760]  systems the same team based right here in america that brought you the alexa pure groundbreaking
[3:31:17.760 --> 3:31:23.280]  water filtration systems have now developed alexa pure breeze whether it's your home or office you
[3:31:23.280 --> 3:31:28.720]  owe it to yourself your co-workers your family your children to the best job you can to purify
[3:31:28.720 --> 3:31:33.920]  your air the elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that
[3:31:33.920 --> 3:31:40.800]  mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves the general public doesn't the alexa pure breeze
[3:31:40.800 --> 3:31:46.720]  would be a steal at 300 400 500 dollars one of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly
[3:31:46.720 --> 3:31:51.280]  clean this is a system i'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive
[3:31:51.280 --> 3:31:57.120]  filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so revolutionary today at info

[3:32:05.040 --> 3:32:10.880]  many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified
[3:32:10.880 --> 3:32:17.440]  organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract when you take selenium in the body it
[3:32:17.440 --> 3:32:23.120]  actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body it helps balance the thyroid gland it
[3:32:23.120 --> 3:32:28.960]  helps detoxify selenium is another one of those absolute must have the highest concentration
[3:32:28.960 --> 3:32:32.800]  of selenium is in the thyroid gland but it's actually used all over the body as a matter

[3:32:56.160 --> 3:33:14.080]  toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine all of us including myself have
[3:33:14.080 --> 3:33:21.760]  developed a normalcy bias and of course the normalcy bias is the fact that we tend to become
[3:33:21.760 --> 3:33:29.920]  adaptive or conform to the current environments we live in in ancient aztec times say 600 years
[3:33:29.920 --> 3:33:35.360]  ago before they were out of the spaniards there were daily sacrifices of men women and children to
[3:33:35.360 --> 3:33:43.520]  the gods some had their hearts chopped out some were bound and thrown to deep wells still others
[3:33:43.520 --> 3:33:52.320]  were hunted down in ritualistic sporting events like the famous bullcourt at chichin itza and
[3:33:52.320 --> 3:33:58.880]  other areas in mesoamerica i don't mean to go off into a history lesson the issue is we become
[3:33:58.880 --> 3:34:06.080]  comfortable with always having things being free and happy and open we also become comfortable
[3:34:06.080 --> 3:34:13.040]  with tyrannies that we're basically born into into a great extent we've gotten very comfortable
[3:34:13.040 --> 3:34:19.840]  watching msm lie to us and engage in giant hoaxes even if we know they're big liars we still kind
[3:34:19.840 --> 3:34:25.600]  of just accept them like a crocodile on the side of the nile river sure the crocodile
[3:34:25.600 --> 3:34:32.400]  occasionally eats children sometimes women sometimes even men but we've learned to see the 20 foot
[3:34:32.400 --> 3:34:38.320]  crocodiles just lay there happily uh in the mud because we've grown up around them we're comfortable
[3:34:38.320 --> 3:34:45.040]  with them and i catch myself laughing about how they use the word dossier concerning this latest
[3:34:45.040 --> 3:34:49.760]  fake trump stuff which is admittedly fake but the media is still running with it because they're
[3:34:49.760 --> 3:34:57.120]  already discredited what do they have to lose i could say they're dossiers that john mccain
[3:34:57.120 --> 3:35:02.080]  is a child molester now there isn't a dossier that i know i'm actually saying that but i could go
[3:35:02.080 --> 3:35:10.960]  dossier instead of dossier instead of just saying somebody claims are there some internet report or
[3:35:10.960 --> 3:35:19.040]  some recycled year and a half old garbage but if i say dossier you know there are dossiers
[3:35:19.040 --> 3:35:25.440]  and actual witnesses of barack obama and homosexual orgies i'm not bashing obama
[3:35:25.440 --> 3:35:30.720]  he's homosexual i'm bashing obama and that he's clearly blackmailed he see the truth is we're
[3:35:30.720 --> 3:35:35.440]  blackmailed by communist china saudi arabia and others a lot of globalists willfully go and get
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:40.320]  themselves uh blackmailed put themselves in compromising positions because then they
[3:35:40.320 --> 3:35:45.120]  won't be trusted by the group and they're so upset that trump doesn't have this blackmailable
[3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:50.880]  information they would have already used it obviously during the campaign so now they just put out
[3:35:50.880 --> 3:35:58.720]  recycled fake garbage and it should really illustrate to all of us how much grave danger we're in
[3:35:58.720 --> 3:36:03.040]  you know i pose this question throughout the day but i want to ask john rapaport right now
[3:36:03.680 --> 3:36:09.840]  as this live voice memo comes into him and airs live i want to ask him what does he think about
[3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:15.040]  this i mean does he agree with me or how can he elaborate that for me the big issue here is
[3:36:15.600 --> 3:36:22.720]  not even the new fake dossier dossier put out by some globalist attache and other fancy
[3:36:22.720 --> 3:36:28.400]  ten dollar words isn't it showing the recklessness of these people and the real story is what will
[3:36:28.400 --> 3:36:33.440]  they come up with next with only eight days and then what comes after that and they realize how
[3:36:33.440 --> 3:36:39.920]  they're discrediting themselves forever i mean we really are seeing crazy meltdown with globalist
[3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:45.280]  hijacked intelligence agencies who are really the foreign takeover artist claiming there's some foreign
[3:36:45.280 --> 3:36:50.160]  takeover when we're doing the opposite trying to reestablish our national sovereignty among other
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:54.400]  nations across the globe and it's that pattern that's unstoppable they're not going to be able to
[3:36:54.400 --> 3:37:00.240]  blame the russians for all of it no it's the globalist who are to blame now back to john rapaport
[3:37:00.240 --> 3:37:05.040]  with live coverage and he's the guy that coined the term fake news i'm gonna steal trump's term
[3:37:05.040 --> 3:37:12.400]  now and call it pile of garbage news or garbage news back to the man from no more fake news dot
[3:37:12.400 --> 3:37:17.360]  com i'm alex jones with info wars dot com please don't take the size for granted we're under mega
[3:37:17.360 --> 3:37:26.160]  massive attack i agree completely alex that's the point they're getting more and more desperate
[3:37:26.160 --> 3:37:32.800]  more and more reckless they're saying and doing anything uh i wrote that i expected the next
[3:37:32.800 --> 3:37:39.040]  thing would be that trump is some kind of an extraterrestrial invader and that his uh flying
[3:37:39.040 --> 3:37:44.960]  saucer landed on the mexican us border some years ago and how come they let him through
[3:37:44.960 --> 3:37:50.960]  without any papers or something like that i mean it could get to that it could get to anything
[3:37:50.960 --> 3:37:56.960]  after the latest business about the ritz carlin hotel in moscow and what trump supposedly had
[3:37:56.960 --> 3:38:07.440]  these uh hookers doing etc etc all of this stuff all of this stuff because they're losing
[3:38:07.440 --> 3:38:16.800]  they've lost and they keep on losing and they're discredited completely and it gets worse and
[3:38:16.800 --> 3:38:22.160]  worse and worse if you've been tracking if you have any memory at all as soon as the election
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:27.040]  was over it was fake news and then it was russian fake news and then it was russia influence
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:31.840]  election then it was russia influence election on the side of trump and then it was trump was
[3:38:31.840 --> 3:38:38.560]  either an unwitting or witting or blackmailed agent of putin and now here's exactly what really
[3:38:38.560 --> 3:38:47.280]  did happen of course the dossier that shows how they blackmailed him and you know they just make
[3:38:47.280 --> 3:38:54.640]  this stuff out out of nowhere right the washington post leads the way jeff bezos who owns the post
[3:38:54.640 --> 3:39:05.280]  and owns amazon has a 600 million dollar contract with the cia to do their cloud computing and he
[3:39:05.280 --> 3:39:11.920]  is objective and the washington post is objective and they don't print a conflict of interest
[3:39:11.920 --> 3:39:18.160]  statement at the beginning of every single story that even mentions the cia and says hey folks
[3:39:18.160 --> 3:39:24.800]  you know you probably shouldn't believe this story because our owner jeff bozo actually has
[3:39:24.800 --> 3:39:30.640]  a 600 million dollar contract with the cia and he's going to get more from the cia and we're
[3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:38.480]  cia connected so really why bother even reading the story let's just say it's fake news yours
[3:39:38.480 --> 3:39:45.040]  truly the editors of the washington post and that statement would proceed every single story
[3:39:45.040 --> 3:39:53.280]  that they run that even mentions the word cia i mean that would be authentic journalism of course
[3:39:53.280 --> 3:39:57.760]  it would destroy itself in the process but that's their problem not mine i don't have that problem
[3:39:58.880 --> 3:40:07.120]  i do not have that problem i was mentioning carlo slim he is now the biggest single investor in
[3:40:07.120 --> 3:40:15.280]  the new york times now you can read about him go online check him out check his background check the
[3:40:15.280 --> 3:40:22.720]  fact that one of his biographers claims that when he went to warren buffett and bill gates
[3:40:22.720 --> 3:40:28.320]  for statements about carlo slim they didn't want to talk they did not want to talk to him
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:39.280]  as if hey it's not a good idea to talk about carlos right make what you will research it
[3:40:40.080 --> 3:40:46.560]  but here's a further point why did the new york times that was sinking into so much red ink
[3:40:47.200 --> 3:40:54.160]  that they couldn't even get out why did they have to refinance the refinancing of the refinancing
[3:40:54.160 --> 3:41:01.440]  of their draining down the toilet newspaper with a guy named carlos slim from mexico
[3:41:02.800 --> 3:41:11.920]  because they couldn't get that kind of money from any investor in the us wake up folks couldn't get
[3:41:11.920 --> 3:41:19.760]  that kind of money from any investor in the us because no investor in the us thought that
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:26.160]  they were a good enough risk that tells you something doesn't it i mean come on so we have
[3:41:26.160 --> 3:41:34.480]  jeff bozo at the washington post with cia in partnership and we have carlo slim principal
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:40.320]  investor in the new york times we have david rhodes the president of cbs and his brother ben
[3:41:40.320 --> 3:41:51.440]  is deputy national security advisor to obama and this is authentic news please this is a
[3:41:51.440 --> 3:41:57.280]  fake of the fake of the fake and how much lower can they sink well we don't have to worry about
[3:41:57.280 --> 3:42:02.400]  that because they're going to show us in the coming days they're going to keep on going
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:14.400]  they're not going to stop you know it's like the compulsive obsessive maniacal lunatic gambler
[3:42:14.960 --> 3:42:23.040]  with a lot of money who walks into a casino in vegas and the more he loses the more he has to play
[3:42:24.240 --> 3:42:30.880]  the more he loses the more he has to play and the more he has to believe like it's a religion
[3:42:30.880 --> 3:42:36.080]  that he's going to get it back do you understand you know the phenomenon
[3:42:37.760 --> 3:42:41.680]  i just say here at the table a little while longer i'm sure i'm going to get it all back so
[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:49.200]  yeah let's go for it okay double down here we go yeah sure and the heart rate is increasing
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:55.520]  and the blood pressure is going crazy and he's sweating and so forth and so on you know that
[3:42:55.520 --> 3:43:01.520]  last hand i just you know okay i'm going to double again that's what they're doing
[3:43:02.800 --> 3:43:09.040]  that's what the fake major media are doing that story didn't take hold that story didn't play we
[3:43:09.040 --> 3:43:15.360]  didn't convince anybody with that one so we have to go double down tell a crazier story okay do we
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:20.560]  have one sure we have when we got this dossier that's been floating around for the last year
[3:43:20.560 --> 3:43:27.360]  let's just use it and let's say that we don't know whether it's true but we think the reader
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:32.640]  should have an opportunity to decide isn't that what the buzzfeed editor uh said what's his name
[3:43:32.640 --> 3:43:40.080]  ben smith i mean is that is that what they learn at journalism school these days now listen kitties
[3:43:40.080 --> 3:43:45.840]  when you get to be an editor in a fake news major media outlet here's the way you play it
[3:43:45.840 --> 3:43:51.280]  when you've got a story that you're desperate to release because you're already under assault
[3:43:51.280 --> 3:43:57.760]  and your reputation and your money are all going away you grab anything you can and then as an excuse
[3:43:57.760 --> 3:44:03.680]  for running with it you say well we think the reader should decide don't worry about fact checking
[3:44:03.680 --> 3:44:08.080]  don't worry about where the sources came from don't worry about any of that stuff that we were
[3:44:08.080 --> 3:44:14.320]  teaching you you know when you first came in the door so that we could impress you here's the real
[3:44:14.320 --> 3:44:21.120]  stuff you run anything you can the more horrible the better and you say let the reader decide
[3:44:22.080 --> 3:44:29.520]  that's the new principle of major media now we're just going to throw as much stuff at the wall as
[3:44:29.520 --> 3:44:39.440]  we can and hope that something please god make something stick and let the reader decide let
[3:44:39.440 --> 3:44:47.520]  the audience decide hi this is brian williams with the news tonight and we have 16 items none of which
[3:44:47.520 --> 3:44:53.360]  we can verify of course we haven't been able to verify much of anything in all the time i've
[3:44:53.360 --> 3:44:58.160]  spent here at nbc but we don't worry about that but tonight we're just going to come out and tell
[3:44:58.160 --> 3:45:05.440]  you none of this we can verify but it's up to you to decide which stories you're going to
[3:45:05.440 --> 3:45:11.360]  believe in and accept and in fact we're going to do a poll because we want to know what you're
[3:45:11.360 --> 3:45:17.760]  going to buy that we're selling so we can keep selling it to you so here are the 16 outrageous
[3:45:18.400 --> 3:45:25.040]  pieces of baloney that we're calling news that have no verification no sources nothing at all
[3:45:25.040 --> 3:45:30.080]  that could be true they could be false we don't know we don't care we're throwing them on the wall
[3:45:30.080 --> 3:45:36.960]  and we're running this fantastic poll so we want you to tell us what we're telling you tonight that
[3:45:36.960 --> 3:45:43.280]  you believe is true that's what we have to know from you so we can get a clue of what more baloney
[3:45:43.280 --> 3:45:49.520]  to slice to feed to you tomorrow because we're at the end of our rope okay folks we are at the end
[3:45:49.520 --> 3:45:57.840]  of our rope this is the subtext of major media now i mean do i have any more here in my notes
[3:45:57.840 --> 3:46:06.000]  well we have obama's farewell address which was a monument of canoodling or whatever you
[3:46:06.000 --> 3:46:12.400]  want to call it i don't know that's not the right word a con job of the highest order shall we say
[3:46:12.400 --> 3:46:18.160]  because nowhere does he mention the fact that right out of the gate as president he decided
[3:46:18.160 --> 3:46:25.840]  that jobs were not going to be a priority he had promised it the country was screaming for it back
[3:46:25.840 --> 3:46:32.960]  in 2008 if you recall and instead he went with health care you know obama care which is the most
[3:46:32.960 --> 3:46:41.520]  gigantic mess that's ever been created by federal government i think nothing about jobs well of
[3:46:41.520 --> 3:46:46.880]  course not because he's a globalist and globalists do not want job creation because that would mean
[3:46:46.880 --> 3:46:53.920]  canceling trade treaties and so forth and so on and going against the globalist agenda of torpedoing
[3:46:53.920 --> 3:47:01.520]  economies and he obama was mentored by spiggy brzezinski as soon as he was elected who was a
[3:47:01.520 --> 3:47:08.160]  partner of david brockelfeller that created the trilateral commission in 1973 which is the most
[3:47:08.160 --> 3:47:15.840]  powerful globalist force on the planet check out patrick wood and global trilaterals over
[3:47:15.840 --> 3:47:23.200]  washington that'll give you the story on that right so obama isn't going to talk about that
[3:47:23.200 --> 3:47:31.120]  major media are not going to comment on that nobody in major media like moraine dowd or some other
[3:47:31.120 --> 3:47:38.960]  very fancy editorial writer or paul krugman for the new york times are going to look into their
[3:47:38.960 --> 3:47:48.560]  dossiers and come up with you know what this guy obama has been conning us everybody in america
[3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:53.840]  including the people desperate and inner cities who wanted jobs for the last eight years because
[3:47:53.840 --> 3:48:01.040]  he said he was going to put back jobs and he hasn't the figures show it unless you want to include
[3:48:01.600 --> 3:48:08.160]  fast food restaurant jobs and part-time jobs as part of the deal he hasn't and there's got to
[3:48:08.160 --> 3:48:13.680]  be a good reason for that oh yeah there is he's a globalist they don't want jobs they don't want
[3:48:13.680 --> 3:48:20.560]  to cancel trade treaties they want more corporations to leave america and now that could be reversing
[3:48:20.560 --> 3:48:26.240]  is that really happening i mean oh my god is that really going on is it coming back our jobs
[3:48:26.240 --> 3:48:32.480]  actually coming back to america that would be a catastrophe we must not have that we must not
[3:48:32.480 --> 3:48:40.640]  have that otherwise how can we justify and explain the imposition of a globalist management system
[3:48:40.640 --> 3:48:47.120]  over the whole desperate planet how can we invoke a crisis great enough to take over
[3:48:48.160 --> 3:48:55.040]  if too many jobs come back and people you know look people have been willing to work alongside
[3:48:55.040 --> 3:49:00.000]  each other regardless of race religion creed color whatever background for a long time in america
[3:49:00.880 --> 3:49:07.520]  that's no revelation obama knows that he went back to an earlier time you know he's talking in
[3:49:07.520 --> 3:49:13.200]  a farewell address about ro jim crow is still alive in america sure okay to a degree but he's
[3:49:13.200 --> 3:49:18.400]  basically going back to an earlier time because people all over america are willing to work with
[3:49:18.400 --> 3:49:25.440]  each other if there's work if there's decent paying jobs they don't care and he knows that
[3:49:25.440 --> 3:49:34.800]  he's lying and fake media are obscuring the lies pretending that they don't exist that is what's
[3:49:34.800 --> 3:49:40.320]  happening folks that is what's happening in the country and they're getting more desperate they're
[3:49:40.320 --> 3:49:47.040]  the fake media are getting more fake that level of fake didn't work we got a sink to a lower level
[3:49:47.040 --> 3:49:54.480]  what can we do we were alligators on the edge now we have to be crocodiles under the surface and if
[3:49:54.480 --> 3:50:03.760]  that doesn't work we have to be some kind of bottom feeding crawling claw ridden hideous object on
[3:50:03.760 --> 3:50:10.720]  the ocean floor whatever level we have to sink to in order to justify our existence and just keep
[3:50:10.720 --> 3:50:15.920]  going because we're so desperate and so obsessed just keep throwing that stuff at the wall baby
[3:50:15.920 --> 3:50:23.440]  because somewhere it has to stick somewhere it has to stick and it's not it's going away it's all
[3:50:23.440 --> 3:50:30.800]  going away folks it's all going away major media are all going to be talking to themselves that's
[3:50:30.800 --> 3:50:35.520]  all they're going to be doing and everybody else is going to be getting their news from
[3:50:35.520 --> 3:50:43.040]  independent media and creating their own news that's the story John Rappaport thanks very much

[3:55:52.640 --> 3:56:00.240]  but i'm here to tell you that major media in other countries are watching what's happening here
[3:56:01.040 --> 3:56:10.240]  and they are beginning to make their own shift their own shift so somebody like me can speak
[3:56:10.240 --> 3:56:17.760]  for five minutes on sputnik news the official russian news agency that happened the other day
[3:56:17.760 --> 3:56:25.520]  how does that occur because everybody senses there's a shift going on and whether or not
[3:56:25.520 --> 3:56:32.880]  they support it or they really recognize it they want to get on board and so
[3:56:34.400 --> 3:56:38.640]  i talked for a few minutes people come to my website they say hey this guy's writing about
[3:56:38.640 --> 3:56:42.880]  a whole lot of other things they certainly have done the same thing within for wars
[3:56:42.880 --> 3:56:50.320]  and many other independent media websites media outlets that it would be considered major media
[3:56:50.320 --> 3:57:01.200]  outside the united states are beginning to give voice space room time words print to independent
[3:57:01.200 --> 3:57:10.400]  media reporters and outlets and in the process of doing that whether they intend for it to happen
[3:57:10.400 --> 3:57:19.440]  or not they really don't care what happens is people come to the websites and blogs and so forth of
[3:57:20.880 --> 3:57:25.040]  those independent reporters and they find out what else is going on there
[3:57:25.040 --> 3:57:29.440]  and they're introduced to a whole new world and level of information they hadn't encountered
[3:57:29.440 --> 3:57:41.840]  before that's what happens that's part of the revolution as well the major media lunatics
[3:57:41.840 --> 3:57:51.680]  are so confounded by their own situation now that they are losing in fact not only their sanity
[3:57:51.680 --> 3:58:00.000]  such as it ever was but their sense of confusion is mounting they just don't know what to do stay
[3:58:00.000 --> 3:58:25.840]  with us folks because we the independent media are winning see you next time
[3:58:30.000 --> 3:58:39.840]  um
