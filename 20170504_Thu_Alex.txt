[00:00.000 --> 00:17.640]  before America can be great again she must be free again you're listening to
[00:17.640 --> 00:23.920]  the Alex Jones show well we've got nine hours left in the global transmission
[00:23.920 --> 00:30.560]  30 hours that kicked off yesterday at 11 a.m. we end at 8 o'clock central time Wow
[00:30.560 --> 00:35.600]  great job crew great job callers all the great host all the great guests so much
[00:35.600 --> 00:40.040]  more coming up we have huge developments inside the power structure of the New
[00:40.040 --> 00:45.640]  World Order huge developments in France huge developments on Obama caught
[00:45.640 --> 00:50.440]  spying on thousands of Americans during the election totally illegal all this
[00:50.440 --> 00:54.320]  is coming up Al Gore's new film the details that would have been leaked on
[00:54.320 --> 01:01.000]  info wars.com but first off all Watson's new video dear black people Buzzfeed is
[01:01.000 --> 01:10.120]  once again pushing race baiting divisive crap and casual anti-white racism so a
[01:10.120 --> 01:14.680]  dude on Twitter reacted to Netflix's dear white people show with the following
[01:14.680 --> 01:18.000]  tweet imagine if there was a show called dear black people then this black dude
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.680]  called Reggie responded to that tweet with dear black people I'm sorry for our
[01:22.680 --> 01:28.520]  history of oppression and genocide this was such epic onage that Buzzfeed
[01:28.520 --> 01:35.360]  devoted an entire article to it yeah Reggie sure showed him right
[01:36.400 --> 01:40.320]  dear black people I'm sorry your skin color makes me see you as a threat yeah
[01:40.320 --> 01:43.640]  that probably has more to do with the fact that black people are way over
[01:43.640 --> 01:47.840]  represented in violent crime statistics and commit about half of homicides in
[01:47.840 --> 01:52.480]  America despite being only 13% of the population just saying so Reggie told
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.360]  Buzzfeed I was trying to help them understand how the history of this
[01:56.360 --> 02:02.000]  country shaped racism to only go one way and that the double standard lacks
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.960]  historical context right so you want to talk about historical context okay the
[02:08.960 --> 02:15.360]  very word slave is derived from slav slavic white people who were taken as
[02:15.360 --> 02:21.200]  slaves by Muslims in Spain in the 9th century for hundreds of years under the
[02:21.200 --> 02:27.240]  Barbary slave trade over a million white Christian Europeans were abducted by
[02:27.240 --> 02:32.640]  Arabs that's white people being enslaved by brown people the Barbary slave
[02:32.640 --> 02:38.080]  trade was far more brutal than the transatlantic slave trade Arabs also
[02:38.080 --> 02:43.200]  enslaved blacks and castrated young black boys so they couldn't have children
[02:43.200 --> 02:48.080]  killing many of them in the process of amputating their scrotum and penis oh
[02:48.080 --> 02:52.600]  but I don't see Buzzfeed already bitching and blaming Arabs living today for
[02:52.600 --> 02:56.520]  what their ancestors did hundreds of years ago white people were the first
[02:56.520 --> 03:01.320]  in the world to legally end slavery reformers like William Wilberforce who
[03:01.320 --> 03:06.920]  campaigned for the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 white people also literally put
[03:06.920 --> 03:11.680]  their lives on the line to conduct raids in African countries to free black
[03:11.680 --> 03:17.040]  slaves from their Arab captors hundreds of thousands of white Americans died in
[03:17.040 --> 03:22.520]  a civil war partly to end slavery there's your historical context there are
[03:22.520 --> 03:29.440]  still 46 million people enslaved in the world today the most ever in human
[03:29.440 --> 03:34.000]  history they're enslaved in countries like India China Pakistan Bangladesh as
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.480]  Pakistan and Qatar yeah you'll notice none of those are white countries there
[03:38.480 --> 03:43.600]  are also millions of black people still enslaved in Africa don't give a damn
[03:43.600 --> 03:48.320]  about that do you buzzfeed listen virtually every single racial group in
[03:48.320 --> 03:53.160]  history has been guilty of enslaving people from other racial groups or
[03:53.160 --> 03:58.320]  social casts the contemporary narrative that only white people are to blame for
[03:58.320 --> 04:04.520]  slavery is not only totally historically inaccurate it's also racist which is why
[04:04.520 --> 04:09.600]  buzzfeed and a myriad of other leftist outlets and institutions push it
[04:09.600 --> 04:14.960]  because they're racist but reverse racism doesn't exist institutional power
[04:14.960 --> 04:21.120]  the major institutions of media and cultural power in the west are almost
[04:21.120 --> 04:26.680]  completely dominated and controlled by the left the same left using
[04:26.680 --> 04:32.720]  institutional power to push anti-white racism emboldening actual white
[04:32.720 --> 04:40.480]  supremacists and black supremacists and causing more racial tension stop stop
[04:40.480 --> 04:46.400]  lecturing everyone about historical context when you have no frigging idea
[04:46.400 --> 04:54.080]  whatsoever about the true historical context of slavery by the way Paul just
[04:54.080 --> 04:57.080]  reported to me he got buzzfeed to respond to revelations that the employees
[04:57.080 --> 04:59.440]  were plotting the murder of Donald Trump or promoting it
[04:59.440 --> 05:03.840]  staunch anti-fetalist Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution fearing it
[05:03.840 --> 05:07.280]  would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that
[05:07.280 --> 05:11.160]  had created it but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty his
[05:11.160 --> 05:15.760]  warnings ignored have now come to pass he said you're not to inquire how your
[05:15.760 --> 05:20.320]  trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great and powerful people but
[05:20.320 --> 05:24.640]  how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct end of
[05:24.640 --> 05:28.640]  your government Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor
[05:28.640 --> 05:32.120]  ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be
[05:32.120 --> 05:36.440]  concealed from them today everything the government does at every level is
[05:36.440 --> 05:40.720]  concealed from us we have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our
[05:40.720 --> 05:44.360]  elected representatives are allowed to see later in life Patrick Henry looked
[05:44.360 --> 05:48.400]  back and said when the American spirit was in its youth the language of America
[05:48.400 --> 05:53.440]  was different liberty sir was the primary object today our primary concern is

[08:33.120 --> 08:36.920]  well we're 24 hours in the global transmission but then I was thinking we
[08:36.920 --> 08:41.480]  have that's new show we do from three to five lives in the nightly news comes on
[08:41.480 --> 08:45.040]  seven o'clock I talked to the crew they just said hey most of us only had three
[08:45.040 --> 08:48.400]  hours sleep let's just go right through to eight o'clock central in the nightly
[08:48.400 --> 08:55.240]  news in tonight live that comes like 34 35 hours simply amazing again I am your
[08:55.240 --> 09:00.840]  host Alex Jones info wars.com is the besieged hated sight by tyrants
[09:00.840 --> 09:06.680]  globally Prince Philip I saw this in the Daily Mail last night or yesterday
[09:06.680 --> 09:12.160]  afternoon reportedly had some type of fit there was a big emergency at the
[09:12.160 --> 09:16.240]  palace and then they announced this morning that he will be retiring from
[09:16.240 --> 09:19.160]  public life now in the next few months which means if he gets better they'll
[09:19.160 --> 09:22.920]  roll him out say bye-bye and then that's it he's definitely flown over the
[09:22.920 --> 09:27.800]  cuckoo's nest I'm sure I will by the time I'm 95 years old but if you know
[09:27.800 --> 09:34.080]  about him he was the prince of Cyprus a Greek prince but not of Greek bloodline
[09:34.080 --> 09:40.440]  he is a Transylvanian Romanian German heir to the Austrian Hungarian Empire
[09:40.440 --> 09:45.240]  even more royal than Queen Elizabeth II but she was the British bloodline that
[09:45.240 --> 09:52.040]  was German itself House of Windsor fake name or Saxe-Coburg gothers the top hat
[09:52.040 --> 09:57.120]  wearing a Nazi and he was a Nazi so was his cousin Prince Bernhard of the
[09:57.120 --> 10:03.160]  Netherlands of course the king of England before him Edward the 8th you can
[10:03.160 --> 10:09.760]  google Edward the 8th meets with Hitler was a Nazi and they the Nazis had planned
[10:09.760 --> 10:17.680]  to set up the European Union that was a plan that Hitler announced in 1939 he
[10:17.680 --> 10:22.160]  also announced it 1938 as well but officially announced it in 39 at the
[10:22.160 --> 10:28.560]  World Olympics so this goes on and on and on Hitler invented himself the
[10:28.560 --> 10:34.360]  Olympic symbol of the rings he invented the Volkswagen he drew it he designed it
[10:34.360 --> 10:40.160]  the engine everything he also designed a lot of the looks and sleek designs on
[10:40.160 --> 10:44.560]  Wolfpack submarines Hitler was a bad guy but he did when the German
[10:44.560 --> 10:49.000]  Congressional Medal of Honor iron cross first class and iron cross second
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.400]  class had like 10 different classes of those and that's why he was admired by
[10:53.400 --> 10:56.840]  the German military because he was like an Audi Murphy of World War one just
[10:56.840 --> 11:01.040]  interesting things people should know but again just search engine Edward the
[11:01.040 --> 11:06.040]  8th King of England with that all Hitler there are hundreds of photos and
[11:06.040 --> 11:09.520]  there's the Queen of England a man a few years ago as a young girl hailing
[11:09.520 --> 11:14.520]  Hiling Hitler but there is the King of England with his American wife and they
[11:14.520 --> 11:18.560]  later claimed he advocated because he had American wife no that's not why it's a
[11:18.560 --> 11:24.680]  fact there was a treaty with Germany signed in 1939 by Never Chamberlain a
[11:24.680 --> 11:30.160]  secret treaty to double down with the United States in an attack on Russia
[11:30.160 --> 11:35.320]  and that's when he broke his deal like I said 41 and launched Operation Barber
[11:35.320 --> 11:39.920]  Rosa against the Russians but the United States by then broke the secret
[11:39.920 --> 11:47.240]  treaty and so did the British broke the secret treaty the vice-fuehrer then
[11:47.240 --> 11:52.560]  Rudolph Hess parachuted in he was a fighter ace from World War one parachuted
[11:52.560 --> 11:56.920]  in from his fighter bomber over one of the main palaces with the treaty he was
[11:56.920 --> 12:02.800]  then locked up for life in the Tower of London right by London Bridge that's how
[12:02.800 --> 12:07.720]  that works so that's how deep all this goes people ask why would the British be
[12:07.720 --> 12:13.800]  on the Nazi side because right up until the end they had deals to do it until
[12:13.800 --> 12:18.920]  they basically announced a secret arrest warrant this is in mainline history
[12:18.920 --> 12:25.940]  books for the King of England because he had run off to Germany when World War
[12:25.940 --> 12:30.560]  two started and then he had to sneak back through into Spain then was brought
[12:30.560 --> 12:36.800]  back to England but had to advocate so I mean is it that amazing amazing history
[12:36.800 --> 12:40.880]  and it's all completely on record but you don't see it on Discovery Channel
[12:40.880 --> 12:45.000]  you don't see on History Channel this morning when I got up at 6 a.m. and
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.840]  turned on Fox News and started punching up info wars.com and Drudge Report.com
[12:50.840 --> 12:56.520]  as I do to monitor fake conservative news on Fox and then you look at real news
[12:56.520 --> 13:02.040]  analysis from Drudge and Info Wars you would think that an American icon George
[13:02.040 --> 13:08.640]  Washington was retiring the Duke of Edinburgh and they rolled out all these
[13:08.640 --> 13:12.880]  Brits I love Brits but just you know Brits on US TV lecturing us how great
[13:12.880 --> 13:19.040]  the Queen is and how great the her her consort the Duke of Edinburgh Prince
[13:19.040 --> 13:27.080]  Charles's father how great he is this is a guy who on live TV goes oh my
[13:27.080 --> 13:31.400]  goodness we have blacks in here I'm surprised they know how to screw in
[13:31.400 --> 13:36.400]  light bulbs of course he was best friends with Jimmy Savelle the famous
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.040]  Satanist and pedophile who liked to slit little girls' throats with the
[13:40.040 --> 13:44.240]  Prime Minister I reported that 10 years ago now it's mainstream news there he is
[13:44.240 --> 13:49.000]  in the Scottish guard regalia he couldn't stand the Queen of England that's in
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.960]  mainline history books because she was a nympho maniac demanding sex up to 20
[13:54.960 --> 14:01.080]  times a day and he called her a cow and other names he liked really racy
[14:01.080 --> 14:07.600]  sexy supermodels but good friends with the pedophile confirmed pedophile Jimmy
[14:07.600 --> 14:13.320]  Savelle who had the highest level national security royal security clearance
[14:13.320 --> 14:19.760]  up until the time he died to all of the royal palaces even above MI5 and MI6
[14:19.760 --> 14:27.800]  and the Royal Guard can't make that stuff up but but let's punch him up in the
[14:27.800 --> 14:32.440]  Scottish guard regalia he looks like what Emperor Palpatine wishes he looks
[14:32.440 --> 14:43.120]  like pure seething unabated absolute vampiric evil and that the admitted blood
[14:43.120 --> 14:47.800]  transfusions that they get from children that's admitted the Queen of England him
[14:47.800 --> 14:50.400]  the Queen mother lived up to a hundred and something with the blood
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.560]  transfusions but the old brain finally ain't working on that guy you think that
[14:55.560 --> 15:01.680]  snapper you think that little demons seen a few things 95 years old you want
[15:01.680 --> 15:04.920]  to know who the enemy is that's it right there you want to know who's at the
[15:04.920 --> 15:10.880]  bottom of the rat hole people like this in Lord Rothschilds every time about the
[15:10.880 --> 15:14.240]  Rothschilds being at the top of pyramid they go oh you're anti-semitic what
[15:14.240 --> 15:17.400]  Jews can't be at the top of pyramid Germans can't be Transylvanians it's a
[15:17.400 --> 15:22.680]  fact the Rothschilds aren't even Jewish for 200 years they've been marrying in
[15:22.680 --> 15:29.160]  to this French Merovingian slash Transylvanian slash Germanic bloodline
[15:29.160 --> 15:34.920]  and if you look at the Rothschilds they look like this guy yeah they might be
[15:34.920 --> 15:38.440]  some I think the current Rothschilds in England the Lords over there I think are
[15:38.440 --> 15:43.480]  like 12.5% Jewish last time I read a mainstream news article about it what
[15:43.480 --> 15:49.880]  they are is New World Order demons so you just think about that you look at that
[15:49.880 --> 15:54.640]  for a long time ladies and gentlemen you think about being locked up in some
[15:54.640 --> 15:58.240]  dungeon when one of these boys comes toddling in yeah he just died at a hundred
[15:58.240 --> 16:03.200]  whatever it was first Rockefeller to go past a hundred all of them back to
[16:03.200 --> 16:07.120]  John D the first had huge bets they could make it past a hundred none of them
[16:07.120 --> 16:15.520]  did it but David oh David and old David in the 30s was in Germany for years in
[16:15.520 --> 16:19.480]  army intelligence the secret commission that I've been told about by high-level
[16:19.480 --> 16:23.840]  sources and took working for the what was it AP the nice front for those boys
[16:23.840 --> 16:28.280]  taking famous photos of the Duke of Edinburgh meeting with Hitler and
[16:28.280 --> 16:37.560]  photos of Hitler early on before he even launched wars 36 37 38 old David was
[16:37.560 --> 16:42.040]  representing the family in Deutschland making big profits and Rockefeller own
[16:42.040 --> 16:46.180]  factories were not allowed to be bombed by my grandfather's both the Army Air
[16:46.180 --> 16:49.720]  Corps in World War two by the way everything I'm saying you can just
[16:49.720 --> 16:57.000]  search engine and find even mainstream next Ford Chevrolet Opel factories tank
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.880]  factories owned by the Rockefellers were not allowed to be bombed IBM
[17:00.880 --> 17:09.720]  computer factories were not allowed to be bombed yep that right there ladies
[17:09.720 --> 17:16.480]  and gentlemen is the Duke of Edinburgh marching with Adolf Alois Hitler and
[17:16.480 --> 17:28.440]  German high command isn't that just precious isn't that just delightful
[17:28.440 --> 17:37.400]  isn't that just cutie cake time but see in this modern world if your
[17:37.400 --> 17:40.840]  grandfather's thought the Nazis and the main line Nazi groups hate you more
[17:40.840 --> 17:43.760]  than anybody and David Duke says you're the enemy and all the rest of it then
[17:43.760 --> 17:50.320]  you get called a David Duke lover you get called a David Duke lover in court
[17:50.320 --> 17:58.720]  and lose your children that's how America works ladies and gentlemen because
[17:58.720 --> 18:07.120]  being informed is a crime being real is a crime reading hundreds and hundreds
[18:07.120 --> 18:11.560]  and hundreds and hundreds and I've read over 300 400 500 books just on World
[18:11.560 --> 18:16.120]  War two World War one over 20 30 on the Civil War I'm not bragging I just got
[18:16.120 --> 18:20.520]  into more than a hundred on British Naval warfare history because they were
[18:20.520 --> 18:22.800]  the ones actually wrote down their history so they have the best histories
[18:22.800 --> 18:32.680]  all intriguing stuff each page a new battle the battle of the Nile Lord
[18:32.680 --> 18:40.160]  Nelson all of it amazing but then you look on with horror when you see a Prince
[18:40.160 --> 18:46.200]  Philip and all the Queens he likes a good pea soup oh good old Prince Philip I've
[18:46.200 --> 18:52.040]  got a stack of quotes out of the London Guardian here a Prince Philip saying
[18:52.040 --> 18:58.440]  black people aren't humans all the rest of it on death he says in the event that
[18:58.440 --> 19:01.520]  I'm reincarnated I would like to return as a deadly virus to contribute
[19:01.520 --> 19:08.920]  something to solving overpopulation 1988 and of course who runs the modern
[19:08.920 --> 19:14.200]  eugenics operation same people were talking about so I've just spent 12
[19:14.200 --> 19:22.760]  minutes on this I'm gonna stop now I've got Le Pen slams macro Le Pen slams
[19:22.760 --> 19:31.160]  Macron France will be led by a woman either me or Miss Merkel because Germany's
[19:31.160 --> 19:34.240]  running the EU right now and the globalists run Germany that's actually a
[19:34.240 --> 19:42.880]  fact and the French know that so she destroys Macron she's the daughter of a
[19:42.880 --> 19:47.920]  World War two hero pair tripper in D-Day that won France's highest award and
[19:47.920 --> 19:52.480]  England's highest award and high awards from the United States and her dad was
[19:52.480 --> 19:55.720]  demonized for being a French patriot not letting the Muslims take over and it's
[19:55.720 --> 19:59.800]  got to be sweet victory for him to now see his daughter about to be president
[19:59.800 --> 20:03.440]  in these uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to
[20:03.440 --> 20:07.400]  cook food and boil water if your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove
[20:07.400 --> 20:11.120]  or cooking over an open fire then there's a much better way the Minuteman

[20:15.040 --> 20:18.800]  quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel the Minuteman stove is easy to use

[24:08.720 --> 24:13.880]  in 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty
[24:13.880 --> 24:18.040]  Mississippi we took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the
[24:18.040 --> 24:22.320]  bloody British in a town in New Orleans we fired our guns and the British kept
[24:22.320 --> 24:27.040]  becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired once more and
[24:27.040 --> 24:30.760]  they begin to run in on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[24:30.760 --> 24:36.520]  yeah they ran so fast we look down a river and we see the British come and
[24:36.520 --> 24:40.760]  they must have been a hundred of beaten on the drum they stepped so high and they
[24:40.760 --> 24:44.320]  made the bugles ring we stood beside our cotton veils and didn't say a thing
[24:44.320 --> 24:48.760]  we fired our guns and the British kept becoming there wasn't as many as there was
[24:48.760 --> 24:50.400]  we got to play it sometime but I guess we can't
[24:50.400 --> 24:54.680]  fired once more and they begin to run in on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of
[24:54.680 --> 25:01.400]  Mexico old Hickory old Hickory said we could take them by surprise if we didn't
[25:01.400 --> 25:05.480]  fire muskies till we looked them in the eye we held our fire till we see their
[25:05.480 --> 25:10.280]  faces well then we opened up a squirrel guns and really gave them well we fired
[25:10.280 --> 25:13.680]  our guns right don't fire you see the whites of their eyes
[25:13.680 --> 25:18.160]  as many as there was a while ago we fired once more and they begin to run in on
[25:18.160 --> 25:21.080]  down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[25:21.080 --> 25:23.920]  all right
[25:23.920 --> 25:28.200]  let's go ahead and get into the big exciting news even in the skewed polls
[25:28.200 --> 25:33.160]  that have been put out by the state-run media in France the Muslims running
[25:33.160 --> 25:37.840]  around burning cities killing people every night shooting police people are
[25:37.840 --> 25:43.320]  just sick of it and the media won't ever call it Islamic and just the last few
[25:43.320 --> 25:49.080]  years their tourism is down by half in the last decade it's down by 80% I've
[25:49.080 --> 25:53.600]  talked to family that's been to Paris they say you can't recognize it there's
[25:53.600 --> 25:58.080]  just people from North Africa everywhere just crapping on the side of the
[25:58.080 --> 26:02.520]  street forget the poor gypsies there's just Islamists everywhere wearing you
[26:02.520 --> 26:09.080]  know kind of gangster feline Puma outfits and cussing in everybody and it's
[26:09.080 --> 26:21.480]  just a nightmare it's falling apart the country is committing suicide that's
[26:21.480 --> 26:27.680]  globalism and so Le Pen comes out and slams Macron says France will be led by
[26:27.680 --> 26:32.440]  a woman either me or Ms. Merkel and again that's because Germany runs the EU was
[26:32.440 --> 26:36.040]  always a German project and it's not the German people they're great people it's
[26:36.040 --> 26:40.480]  the corruption you know the globalism using Germany to always control Europe
[26:40.480 --> 26:47.360]  again the EU was a Hitler project that is a uncontrovertible undisputed fact
[26:47.360 --> 26:51.040]  those are stubborn things aren't they let's go to Le Pen in the debate last
[26:51.040 --> 26:58.000]  night the reality you went to see mrs. Merkel you went to ask for her
[26:58.000 --> 27:05.040]  blessing because you planned to do nothing without her agreement it's so
[27:05.040 --> 27:09.000]  true what are you gonna do opposite mrs. Merkel you said I won't be opposite her
[27:09.000 --> 27:16.880]  I will be with her I want France to measure up to Germany let me tell you
[27:16.880 --> 27:22.040]  what happened France will be led by woman it'll be either me or mrs. Merkel
[27:22.040 --> 27:28.960]  that's the truth look at that punk now continuing where's all the feminists
[27:28.960 --> 27:31.760]  well women are reportedly gonna vote for her in record numbers and she's a
[27:31.760 --> 27:35.240]  classy lady I know folks who have known her Bob Chapman was good friends with
[27:35.240 --> 27:39.200]  her going way back in her dad and they're just good people it's just
[27:39.200 --> 27:44.480]  nationalistic free market they have on average at 80 plus percent tax there it's
[27:44.480 --> 27:47.840]  it's it's France is a great country people always make fun of France and say
[27:47.840 --> 27:51.040]  they're a bunch of whims it was the most warlike country ever until Napoleon
[27:51.040 --> 27:55.640]  killed something like half the adult male population in two giant decades long
[27:55.640 --> 28:04.840]  wars people are sick of it and France helped found this Republic and and France
[28:04.840 --> 28:10.640]  needs to be free again they need a Charles de Gaulle to bring their sovereignty
[28:10.640 --> 28:14.880]  back after World War two France didn't get its sovereignty back they didn't have
[28:14.880 --> 28:17.720]  their own nuclear weapons none of it and de Gaulle sees the airfields on their
[28:17.720 --> 28:21.880]  own military bases in a bloodless coup against NATO so the French need to do
[28:21.880 --> 28:25.720]  that again now let's go ahead and go to this clip the kiss of death Obama who
[28:25.720 --> 28:30.440]  endorsed not having Brexit that was the last straw for the Brits pulling out of
[28:30.440 --> 28:37.920]  the EU now he has endorsed Macron here it is I've always been grateful for the
[28:37.920 --> 28:41.680]  friendship of the French people and for the work we did together when I was
[28:41.680 --> 28:46.000]  president of the United States I'm not planning to get involved in many
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.400]  elections now that I don't have to run for office again but the French
[28:49.400 --> 28:53.840]  election is very important to the future of France and the values that we care
[28:53.840 --> 28:59.080]  so much about because the success of France matters to the entire world I
[28:59.080 --> 29:04.720]  have admired the campaign that Emmanuel Macron has run he has stood up for
[29:04.720 --> 29:09.200]  liberal values he put forward a vision for the important role that France plays
[29:09.200 --> 29:13.720]  in Europe and around bringing more Islamists to a better future for the
[29:13.720 --> 29:17.920]  French people total elites tax exam to people's grilling you and not their
[29:17.920 --> 29:22.400]  fears and I enjoyed speaking to me recently to hear about his independent
[29:22.400 --> 29:26.280]  movement and his vision for the future of all his independent he's anti-late I
[29:26.280 --> 29:30.440]  know that you faced many challenges and I want all of my friends in France to
[29:30.440 --> 29:35.400]  know how much I am rooting for your success because of how important this
[29:35.400 --> 29:40.840]  election is I also want you to know that I am supporting Emmanuel Macron to lead
[29:40.840 --> 29:45.880]  you forward on March people of France well that's the kiss of death right
[29:45.880 --> 29:49.600]  there unless they steal the election totally sick stay with us we're on the

[38:50.560 --> 38:55.840]  got a bunch of clips I want to get to and I've got a lot of news I want to
[38:55.840 --> 39:04.120]  cover with this big big brother front president Obama's team saw NSA intel on
[39:04.120 --> 39:09.520]  thousands of Americans during the 2016 election that is totally absolutely

[39:19.040 --> 39:22.360]  making death threats against President Trump BuzzFeeds responded to
[39:22.360 --> 39:26.640]  revelation employees joked about Trump assassination they responded to Paul
[39:26.640 --> 39:30.600]  Watson sound like more like they were planning talking about a hope he dies
[39:30.600 --> 39:35.320]  somebody ought to do it Hispanics give Trump higher approval rating than the
[39:35.320 --> 39:41.360]  rest of the U.S. yep that's a new pull out three illegal immigrants MS-13 gang
[39:41.360 --> 39:45.280]  members arrested for attempted murder in Long Island machete attack and Hispanic
[39:45.280 --> 39:47.400]  Americans that are really sick of it because they're the ones getting fed on
[39:47.400 --> 39:52.680]  by criminals that are above the law that's the wall Trump promise spicer and
[39:52.680 --> 39:56.680]  Breitbart journals clash over Mexican border wall
[39:57.640 --> 40:01.000]  yeah and I guess Breitbart was supposed to be loyal opposition so they're not
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.720]  doing that that's good and so that's why Bannon's in so much trouble he's supposed
[40:04.720 --> 40:08.400]  to rein it in you know the Frankenstein creature of conservatism that they
[40:08.400 --> 40:12.880]  don't like but the good news is Trump only has five hundred million he hasn't
[40:12.880 --> 40:16.600]  gotten the full budget passed yet he's repairing the main traffic areas that
[40:16.600 --> 40:20.400]  are already there and then getting the bids to build the new one and the media
[40:20.400 --> 40:27.840]  spinning it like he's failed only 106 days into office took them two years to
[40:27.840 --> 40:31.680]  pass Obamacare they've got a better version of the bill the last one still
[40:31.680 --> 40:35.160]  not perfect but if he could get that pass in a hundred five hundred six hundred
[40:35.160 --> 40:39.960]  seven days that's just crazy good I think it's really much about nothing to
[40:39.960 --> 40:43.160]  say oh you're only gonna repair stuff with 500 million that's what he's gotten
[40:43.160 --> 40:46.600]  passed that's what he's doing as a patch on it while he tries to get his promise
[40:46.600 --> 40:51.720]  delivered you know if we all just desert Trump cuz he's not perfect doesn't
[40:51.720 --> 40:57.040]  deliver everything like you know Christ can do on a silver platter and we're
[40:57.040 --> 40:59.760]  gonna drive him into the arms of the globalist and I can tell you from
[40:59.760 --> 41:03.920]  multiple sources that President Trump is not like being president he wanted to
[41:03.920 --> 41:07.880]  be president it was a real run but he's just so shocked by the cowardice the
[41:07.880 --> 41:10.640]  traders and people that don't want to make the country great he's tired of all
[41:10.640 --> 41:17.000]  the leakers and all the scum in his own administration that he is really bummed
[41:17.000 --> 41:26.640]  out right now not welcome Japan is very very tough and that basically accepts no
[41:26.640 --> 41:29.520]  refugees that's why they actually have no crime we're gonna look at that
[41:29.520 --> 41:34.160]  no regrets Stephen Colbert responds to firestorm over use of homophobic slur
[41:34.160 --> 41:38.320]  it's not a homophobic slur and I don't like Stephen Colbert he's funny he's
[41:38.320 --> 41:43.320]  entertaining he's got you know over a hundred riders 19 full-time ones he's an
[41:43.320 --> 41:48.720]  actor on a marionette he is a puppet that sits there and looks like he's
[41:48.720 --> 41:54.360]  super smart because he's got a seven-minute monologue he does every
[41:54.360 --> 42:00.600]  night written by a hundred people and then he has questions written to sound
[42:00.600 --> 42:06.280]  witty with the guests that come on and they rehearse those he's an actor he's
[42:06.280 --> 42:12.800]  a puppet he's lip-syncing to the music he's not real but that said he's a
[42:12.800 --> 42:17.200]  handsome guy his writers are funny he carries it out well I mean I can't help
[42:17.200 --> 42:21.080]  but like Colbert even while he's lying about me and my family and trying to
[42:21.080 --> 42:29.200]  destroy my life but he he always pushes people losing their jobs for political
[42:29.200 --> 42:36.240]  correctness but see he is an anointed one so he's allowed to say that Donald
[42:36.240 --> 42:39.080]  Trump is a holster
[42:39.720 --> 42:45.800]  provide him their Putin's sexual member now when I said that about
[42:45.800 --> 42:53.280]  Congressman Schiff serving the globalist it means derriere kisser it means
[42:53.280 --> 42:57.120]  butt kisser it doesn't mean you're bashing gay people but it's like this
[42:57.120 --> 43:01.400]  holiness that if you're a homosexual says let's use the word gay you tell me to
[43:01.400 --> 43:06.320]  heterosexual homosexual it's scientific terms I'm sick of being told what
[43:06.320 --> 43:10.160]  terms to use I don't dislike anybody but I shouldn't have to sit there like I'm
[43:10.160 --> 43:15.560]  guilty and then kiss everybody's rear end and say oh my gosh and then run around
[43:15.560 --> 43:20.960]  and call people to be burned at the stake but sit there and say that President
[43:20.960 --> 43:25.960]  Trump is on the end of Vladimir Putin's Johnson I mean that's what they're
[43:25.960 --> 43:32.320]  saying and that just means you're kissing someone's rear end yeah I mean if
[43:32.320 --> 43:41.120]  you say that Trump is Putin's butt boy it doesn't mean you're bashing gay
[43:41.120 --> 43:46.880]  people universally it means you serve that person you're on bottom is what
[43:46.880 --> 43:51.680]  that means and every gay person knows that and the media knows that and it's
[43:51.680 --> 43:58.280]  all just a cult of beating everybody over the head and turning liberal class
[43:58.280 --> 44:03.560]  people into higher society that we bow down to and I don't like it I'm sick of
[44:03.560 --> 44:08.600]  it I don't care if you're homosexual or heterosexual you don't sexualize kids
[44:08.600 --> 44:12.560]  and you leave people alone and you don't force people I'm sick of gay
[44:12.560 --> 44:16.840]  harassment is basically what it is and I don't dislike gay people I mean liberal
[44:16.840 --> 44:21.400]  establishment Hollywood gay mafia that a lot of liberals talk about that is just
[44:21.400 --> 44:28.240]  in your face and you've got a bow down to and and put up with and go along with
[44:28.240 --> 44:33.400]  you know neighborhoods wouldn't want a heterosexual pride day with naked men and
[44:33.400 --> 44:37.800]  women humping each other driving through the middle of neighborhoods
[44:37.800 --> 44:45.840]  anymore do you want a homosexual in doing I mean normal parades for the VFW or
[44:45.840 --> 44:49.960]  the military or a football team or St. Patty's Day are fun and you take the
[44:49.960 --> 44:55.480]  kids out why is a gay parade a bunch of naked men swinging their weenies around
[44:55.480 --> 45:01.200]  excuse my French and I look dude just go do it in your bedroom it's like it's
[45:01.200 --> 45:06.800]  like you go out to dinner with your friends and they keep kissing and French
[45:06.800 --> 45:10.560]  kissing at the dinner table in front of you and it's not that you're even upset
[45:10.560 --> 45:16.520]  about it it's grandstanding it's like get a room it's one thing if somebody's
[45:16.520 --> 45:18.880]  leaving and you know they kiss their girlfriend or their wife or their husband
[45:18.880 --> 45:22.000]  by or you know some of that's going on or somebody just got married but you
[45:22.000 --> 45:25.600]  everybody knows the couples you've gone out with and they start macking down in
[45:25.600 --> 45:29.080]  front of you and grabbing all over each other and it's like a show-off thing and
[45:29.080 --> 45:31.680]  the word is those are the couples that aren't doing anything you know in the
[45:31.680 --> 45:41.440]  bedroom it's the same thing you'll just be sitting there in a hotel lobby with
[45:41.440 --> 45:44.880]  your kids and two dudes are grabbing each other's rear ends they're all over
[45:44.880 --> 45:50.120]  each other French kissing in front of you as just an act of we're in your face
[45:50.120 --> 46:02.680]  and it's just like you're posing you're grandstanding you're running around hopping around trying to get
[46:02.680 --> 46:11.320]  attention for yourself and I for one I'm sick of it and when I say something
[46:11.320 --> 46:18.800]  like shift being a globalist butt boy the media says I'm being homophobic when
[46:18.800 --> 46:23.000]  if I wanted to be homophobic I would say horrible things I don't I'm a
[46:23.000 --> 46:29.400]  libertarian what my speech is is very clear and by the way Trump is not
[46:29.400 --> 46:36.680]  Putin's butt boy Trump has become the butt boy of John McCain and Lindsey Graham
[46:36.680 --> 46:45.000]  and Congressman Peter Schiff by not meeting with Putin by starting an
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.600]  escalation of conflict with Russia out of thin air when when the globalist and
[46:48.600 --> 46:52.560]  George Soros started the Ukraine war three and a half years ago Trump has
[46:52.560 --> 46:56.080]  been intimidated and bullied by his national security advisor everybody
[46:56.080 --> 47:09.360]  else into a warlike stance with Russia and so the truth is Trump is the Johnson
[47:09.360 --> 47:18.960]  holster for the warmongering neocons and Democrats Trump is the Johnson holster
[47:18.960 --> 47:24.880]  of the military industrial complex there you go now truth has been said I don't
[47:24.880 --> 47:32.040]  dislike Trump he's doing great things in economy I know he's a real guy I know
[47:32.040 --> 47:35.720]  he's bummed out but let's just get things real cobear and you watch how
[47:35.720 --> 47:39.920]  twisted they are will Jones be boycotted in taking off air after homophobic slur
[47:39.920 --> 47:45.200]  I love how cobear comes out and let's cue that up to the very start and says
[47:45.200 --> 47:49.800]  I'm not gonna apologize I'm proud of what I do do I still have my job I still
[47:49.800 --> 47:54.000]  have my job yay exactly you're gonna get everybody else fired you're gonna
[47:54.000 --> 47:57.200]  control everybody a beat everybody over the head and say they're hateful and
[47:57.200 --> 48:01.480]  they're not open well you cover up for Islam that throws gaze off buildings
[48:01.480 --> 48:07.400]  everywhere and you're gonna run your mouth constantly and then you have free
[48:07.400 --> 48:12.960]  speech but none of us do right cobear see I don't have people writing stuff
[48:12.960 --> 48:16.880]  for me the cruisers hate you see this article or hey you know here's a good
[48:16.880 --> 48:20.640]  point Zach made the point of hey look at that fancy studio Obama's got was
[48:20.640 --> 48:24.120]  $400,000 a piece of speeches getting paid off by Wall Street which he claims
[48:24.120 --> 48:27.920]  he's the anti Wall Street guy I'm not anti Wall Street I'm anti the top five
[48:27.920 --> 48:32.320]  big banks and brokerage firms that screw everybody else and shut off funding
[48:32.320 --> 48:35.240]  to the middle class and to small businesses that Trump's trying to turn
[48:35.240 --> 48:39.680]  back on so Trump really is trying to push prosperity and really trying to be
[48:39.680 --> 48:42.640]  the president that's why they hate him the special interests aren't in charge
[48:42.640 --> 48:50.000]  now but Trump's making deals with him and notice they only come after him that
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.800]  much more all right we're gonna go to break I'm gonna get to the Al Gore
[48:53.800 --> 48:58.120]  thing later and I've also got my Prometheus prediction of five years
[48:58.120 --> 49:02.600]  ago now come true with Ridley Scott that's up on info wars.com very

[49:24.000 --> 49:27.480]  terrorism and they're calling for banning cars I'm not kidding I'm not
[49:27.480 --> 49:32.080]  kidding hey life's dangerous don't have kids you know it's kind of that attitude

[54:33.720 --> 54:37.320]  them and I said what's going on why are you only ordered a few thousand of these
[54:37.320 --> 54:41.360]  at a time then it's out for two months and I said it's hard to source and then
[54:41.360 --> 54:44.480]  we have to test it has to be all California standard and then that goes
[54:44.480 --> 54:48.240]  on and that drives at the price and then you don't have enough money to buy
[54:48.240 --> 54:52.280]  5,000 bottles of this with what's left you got to get above a threshold I was
[54:52.280 --> 54:54.800]  with the accountants yesterday for like 30 minutes you got to get above this
[54:54.800 --> 54:59.200]  threshold of extra money like we keep telling you to be able to buy enough of
[54:59.200 --> 55:04.080]  it to get over that threshold then to always have it and then it'll fund you
[55:04.080 --> 55:08.320]  35 40 thousand dollars depending on the purchase of the bio PQQ alone that goes
[55:08.320 --> 55:12.920]  in it we're talking 45 bucks 50 bucks depending on the run 60 bucks a product
[55:12.920 --> 55:18.920]  in each bottle and we sell it for 130 sounds like a lot most people have 300
[55:18.920 --> 55:24.040]  400 500 600 700 percent markup in nutraceuticals I went to what was in
[55:24.040 --> 55:27.560]  the German labs US labs that doctors prescribe it's it's it's over the
[55:27.560 --> 55:31.600]  counter but not in stores because they've learned the only pay for the stuff
[55:31.600 --> 55:36.080]  of its doctor they sell for 300 400 $500 we've gone out made a formula better than
[55:36.080 --> 55:40.800]  what medical doctors are selling the same stuff but even better for a third the
[55:40.800 --> 55:45.360]  price or less okay that's DNA force don't even need to plug it because I
[55:45.360 --> 55:50.680]  can't ever keep it in and I said that's fine we're gonna sit there and
[55:50.680 --> 55:53.480]  hopefully take any backup money we get from this fundraiser this fundraiser
[55:53.480 --> 55:56.360]  sale where you just purchase great stuff at discounts we fund us and I said we're
[55:56.360 --> 55:59.600]  gonna start ordered 5,000 bottles of this so that we could keep it in stock all
[55:59.600 --> 56:04.600]  the time because if I just get this one product in stock and have everybody buy
[56:04.600 --> 56:08.640]  you know 5,000 of these every few months we could fund so much more of the
[56:08.640 --> 56:13.760]  operation info or store.com I want to hire five or six more reporters five or
[56:13.760 --> 56:16.600]  six more editors five or six more writers I want to then I got more

[1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:17.240]  is linked to a Paul Joseph Watson article I mentioned so let me just go
[1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:23.280]  ahead and cover this right now first off Buzzfeed has reportedly a hundred
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:27.880]  million dollars in debt Buzzfeed is to show how they're failing but propped up
[1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:39.000]  like the New York Times Buzzfeed had a reporter for months I've got a call on
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:43.920]  one of our old shipping department guys Matt who was a great guy who's he was
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:47.400]  getting married she they wanted to move back to Maine that's why he left he said
[1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:50.160]  he literally got like called 20 times until he was gonna follow complaint for
[1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:55.600]  harassment how much he was getting called by Buzzfeed and I read this
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:02:06.000]  article they wrote and it's literally 95% total made up crap so they had a guy
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.040]  for months doing this just to I guess make it look like it's real and then
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:16.000]  the weird little stories in there that are just totally made up but are so
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:20.120]  complex you know you even think it's real and I passed it around but people
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:25.520]  that have been there said none of this is even true the only thing true in there
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:32.160]  that I saw was that I buy people steak dinners and stuff and I'm always buying
[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:36.800]  an office lunch every week or so I just like doing it you know get catering in
[1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:43.160]  nothing fancy there was just nothing there was like I'm obsessed with Rush
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:50.360]  Limbaugh and I'm and I and I hate him and I have a fake voice I mean I've
[1:02:50.360 --> 1:02:53.320]  openly said I've criticized that Limbaugh before but I've said I hope he
[1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:56.400]  stays on air I don't want to be in the time slot up against him that's what
[1:02:56.400 --> 1:03:00.120]  GCN made me do 19 years ago and I spent money on his show and they were
[1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:03.800]  boycotting him and led a movement for people to advertise to keep him afloat
[1:03:03.800 --> 1:03:10.080]  never got to thank you for it Limbaugh before he went deaf and he sounds great
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:16.480]  for the implants he's got sounded a very smooth booming nice voice I have a
[1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:25.360]  raspy voice I've been to the I knows you know throat doctor and they said yeah you
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:29.320]  have big lesions on your larynx from screaming back when I used to scream at
[1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:34.600]  rallies without bullhorns to the point I cough up blood I didn't have a very deep
[1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:39.520]  voice wasn't wasn't a high voice but all the bullhorning and not bullhorning and
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:46.520]  screaming that I've had to go to specialists now and I've had sleep
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:51.040]  studies done too I have obviously really bad sleep that means I'm a big head big
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:55.520]  chest I've lost some weight so it's a lot better than it used to be but I was
[1:03:55.520 --> 1:03:59.200]  really bad I had oxygen like sixty four percent sometimes quit breathing quite a
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:06.440]  bit and you know you know all this and you're reading where you have a fake
[1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:11.880]  voice I mean I'm I may have to have surgery because my ragged torn up voice
[1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:16.360]  about five years ago was kind of cool now I've lost control of range and it's
[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:20.240]  getting deeper and more raspy and more torn up I'm like an eighty five year
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:33.360]  old larynx and then it said re-engineer the sound to make me gruffer I've told
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:38.640]  them CJ get ready when we come back I've told CJ who's our one of our great
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:45.120]  engineers and Wes over and over again make me less gruff and less raspy and
[1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:48.680]  Nico when he got hired was honest and said he thinks my voice is grating I've
[1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:53.160]  said that over and over again I don't like my voice some people do women
[1:04:53.160 --> 1:05:01.480]  particular but I don't like it this is my voice James Madison the father of the
[1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:05.960]  Bill of Rights wrote we're an excess of power prevails property of no sort is
[1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:10.560]  duly respected no man is safe in his opinions in his person in his faculties
[1:05:10.560 --> 1:05:14.640]  or in his possessions is there any question that we have an excess of
[1:05:14.640 --> 1:05:18.680]  power in Washington the only question is how do we contain it and how do we
[1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:23.520]  remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:27.400]  that is the ultimate concern the concentration of power the excess of
[1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:32.000]  power was always the chief concern of the founders of this country it was why
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.880]  the anti-fiddle is to pose the Constitution they believe they put
[1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:38.880]  safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power but as James
[1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:43.480]  Madison also pointed out knowledge will forever govern ignorance of people who
[1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:47.680]  mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge

[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:33.360]  transmission and then this morning ECO and others put it out you know do that
[1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:36.320]  three to five show that's beta testing and training folks to go live on radio
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:40.720]  and TV that's just Facebook and YouTube only and then we got the nightly news
[1:08:40.720 --> 1:08:44.120]  coming up let's just go right through to eight o'clock and I said you guys have
[1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:48.600]  barely slept you guys and gals but let's do it by the way Bill Nye the science
[1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:52.600]  guy came out last week on his show Bill Nye saves the world of course he's our
[1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:56.360]  savior just paying carbon taxes saying arrest people that disagree with man-made
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:00.400]  climate change well we don't agree if there's climate change we do agree we're
[1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:04.280]  just not saying most of it's man-made now they've edited his latest episode we
[1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:09.480]  have clips of that coming up I'll play that this hour where get ready for this
[1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:15.040]  ladies and gentlemen Bill Nye the science guy edited it out in the second
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:20.160]  airing of it and edited on your TVOs you let go in and do this and on your DVRs
[1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:25.680]  where they said that chromosomes determine the sex so that's that's
[1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:32.720]  transphobic to say that chromosomes create sex no it's in your mind you see
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:37.480]  so it's hurtful to say this is happening by the way my mic suddenly
[1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:41.080]  sounds different I don't normally talk about myself but we're under such attack
[1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:44.400]  we have to actually say the truth Buzzfeed who's under a lot of fire for
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:48.000]  their internal documents coming out where they were gloating and hoping that
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:52.400]  Trump would be killed their their their their leader over there had a guy for
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:59.560]  several months calling people I knew in college my first jobs trying to get
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:02.920]  somebody who didn't like me to make something up and I guess they did I mean
[1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:06.200]  I'm reading this article Alex Jones will always be Alex Jones and the only true
[1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:11.480]  thing in it is that I'm not an actor and I really believe what I say and what I
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:17.840]  do then they go on using unnamed people to make up that I didn't want Trump to
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:25.560]  be elected that I didn't want Obama to be defeated in 2012 and that my voice is
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:31.360]  fake and then I told the producers that I want to sound gruffer no I believe my
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:35.120]  voice is grating and annoying at times and I said I want to sound smoother and
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:38.960]  like I'm in the room and I've had engineers here doing that with my
[1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:43.080]  engineers and it's all on record so that's the level of lies in here that I
[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:48.000]  have a fake voice and that I'm trying to sound like Rush Limbaugh folks Rush
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:52.040]  Limbaugh before he went deaf that's politically incorrect before he became
[1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:59.360]  hearing impaired he has a great smooth booming voice I have when I get excited
[1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:04.000]  it's almost like a high-pitched low voice it's very very annoying and so I've
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  asked him to take the the raspiness out to be less gruff but am I wrong CJ one
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:15.840]  of our engineers because as soon as I came back live I was saying take the
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:20.880]  raspy gruff filter off we have a filter to block that that's actually my
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:23.760]  directive the opposite again of what BuzzFeed says just so it's all pure
[1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:27.960]  bull and but now I think my voice actually sounds different or louder in
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:32.480]  my ear is that placebo or did you just change the settings no we took a lot of
[1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:38.360]  the lower-range emphasis off which smooths out your voice there's a vocal
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:43.280]  processor on your preempt that tends to pull down the raspiness or the kind of
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:48.360]  rattle in your throat that typically comes across okay but am I wrong did
[1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:50.960]  you just change something when I came back on air yeah I took it out okay
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:53.880]  well I kind of like it like this in my own ear just actually sound like it
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:57.240]  always kind of sounds weird it sounds harsher well then maybe you shouldn't
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:11:59.960]  put the filters on I said I actually like how this sounds this is how I sound
[1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:04.280]  the point is it's not about me but they say I'm a total phony I'm an actor all
[1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:08.560]  this made-up crap my voice from yelling and screaming with bull horns and
[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:13.080]  without them I have polyps on my larynx and they they say I need to have
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:18.040]  surgery but I won't be able to speak for four weeks but they told me that it's
[1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:22.760]  getting progressively worse and then I have the again the larynx of an 80-year
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:28.520]  old man so I just love how I guess Trump being elected's fake I guess
[1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:32.760]  nationalism rising and Lapin about to be elected as fake I guess the Islamists
[1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:35.800]  launching terror attacks all over the world and calling for jihad is fake
[1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:39.400]  there's new video of Muslims in Germany saying I don't want to play this later
[1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:42.360]  I forgot to tell the crew about it I mean I didn't see it in my list here I saw
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:45.920]  this morning that they're gonna have all the German daughters and take over and
[1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:50.120]  that Christianity's over we have imams on video with the head imam of Jerusalem
[1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:55.120]  saying they are weak we will take their women on the pleasure of it and of course
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:58.080]  Matt Bracken has been pointing out there's the house of Islam and everything
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:04.440]  outside the house of Islam is the house of war and so why are the globalist
[1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:07.320]  ally with Islam we were talking about this a year ago with Bracken it sounded
[1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:11.280]  crazy he was talking about it a decade ago so as you know people like David
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:16.480]  Horowitz who I thought was crazy 15 years ago when he said the unholy
[1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:20.440]  alliance the left in Islam but now they came out in the US today associated
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:23.960]  press Reuters everywhere last week and said in the age of Trump a jib is the
[1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:28.800]  new symbol of feminism and then the next article was in the Washington Post it
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:33.960]  said we've learned to get guns and God from Russia it's Russian to have guns
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:39.640]  what I mean oh yeah the headline was guns and religion a few days ago it's
[1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:45.240]  total inversion of reality so if I want free market and guns and fast cars and
[1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:50.560]  freedom and low taxes and God fearing if I want to be God fearing if I don't want
[1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:54.640]  to be a religious freedom I'm a bad guy guns and religion how American
[1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:58.360]  conservatives grew closer to Putin's Russia there it is let's pull up the
[1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:01.080]  one where I think the headline is something like there it is how jib
[1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:07.080]  becomes symbol of resistance feminism in the age of Trump what type of kept
[1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:12.080]  brainwashed morons read stuff like that you know the moon is made of green
[1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:18.640]  swiss cheese who believes that and you have topless feminists in Berlin and
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:27.320]  DC and New York L.A. going I love the calls to prayer with their breasts
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:32.000]  hanging out you'd be put in prison or beaten or executed in minutes for that
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.480]  in most Muslim countries on wire Muslim countries 99% or a hundred percent
[1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:42.640]  like Saudi Arabia Muslim because they're not tolerant but see I'm intolerant
[1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:49.480]  totally sick reason I went off on a jag about Buzzfeed Buzzfeed responds a
[1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:53.360]  revelation employees joked about Trump assassination sounds more like you know
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:57.680]  just talking about how much they want it they responded to a poll watching info
[1:14:57.680 --> 1:15:01.800]  on that this is the group that created the wee wee gate saying that you know
[1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:08.040]  Trump is in a room with Russian hookers you know he was actually on Pluto
[1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:13.560]  having sex with a robot named Stephen Colbert none of this is real they are
[1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:22.080]  the true fake news and I love how the article keeps saying I can't handle
[1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:28.040]  criticism all I do is it criticized I love it I love constructive criticism but
[1:15:28.040 --> 1:15:30.800]  but let's get real with the crew I haven't even told him you know what I was
[1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:35.400]  gonna ask him but let's bring CJ West anybody's involved in engineering on do
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:39.240]  I encourage people to challenge me on stuff do I tell people to make my voice
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:44.720]  sound gruffer what have I really said CJ didn't even know what's going to him
[1:15:44.720 --> 1:15:49.920]  he's not there sorry I ran away to get some other work done but no you've
[1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:57.120]  never said makers said your voice on a gruffer what have I said smoother more
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:16:03.320]  like you're in the room you have that nice radio voice that's a many national
[1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:08.480]  smooth talkers have I mean I guess I could try some of talking here NPR oh
[1:16:08.480 --> 1:16:13.880]  NPR voice I didn't really so much want that but yeah I just love how there's
[1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:20.120]  these anonymous people you're saying things if you say anything to us it's
[1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:24.040]  what do you think how was that do you you've asked us will you agree what our
[1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:29.400]  thoughts are you're not telling us what to think that's for sure do I get mad
[1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:34.120]  when you give me constructive criticism no I mean I'm talking about myself all
[1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:39.080]  day it's just I'm here I think I encourage you guys and gals to jump on
[1:16:39.080 --> 1:16:42.520]  air when you want and to challenge me actually just like I challenge and I
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:45.480]  talk about myself anymore it's just that I have to because they're building a
[1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:50.000]  facsimile of Alex Jones and then lying about me everywhere and then trying to
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:54.280]  destroy who we are and then it says in there that I pressured I pressured
[1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:59.800]  Livestraw and I pressured these companies to sell it to me at $10 and I sell it
[1:16:59.800 --> 1:17:03.760]  for 50 I went and talked to Tim Fruget and Weldon Henson last night they were
[1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:08.320]  here and they go Alex we've never sold it for more than $25 we've never gotten it
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:14.840]  for 10 it's just totally made up that's what's crazy I haven't even set this up
[1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:19.280]  let's just see what Livestraw is right now and the other survival straws we've
[1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:22.280]  got it info or store.com here here let's pull up and then we're going to Matt
[1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:24.760]  Bracken I apologize for having hold but he'll go a little bit with us in the
[1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:28.200]  next hour enemiesfarnanddomestic.com best-selling author find us
[1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:33.400]  information there but this is just really really frustrating there it is
[1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:44.720]  $22.95 I mean we have to be competitive oh it's discounted it's $19.95 we've never
[1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:53.760]  sold it above he looked at the computer above $24.95 it says we sell them for
[1:17:53.760 --> 1:17:58.880]  50 that's what I mean don't you think the idiots at Buzzfeed who did were here
[1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:03.080]  for months following me around would actually go look at the website but see
[1:18:03.080 --> 1:18:07.960]  they don't care they're preying on their audience in their little bubble Matt
[1:18:07.960 --> 1:18:11.760]  Bracken we got a lot of serious news this explosion in Madrid killing a bunch
[1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:15.000]  people they say it might be a chemical plan we got TSA warns against truck
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:20.360]  ramming attacks by terrorists we've got so much big news happening with Le Pen
[1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:24.040]  the jihadis threatening to burn down France and a tattoo offensive that you've
[1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:27.880]  been predicting tell us what's front and center on your radar so we can cover it
[1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:34.080]  when we come back sure I have a thought of a new kind of analogy for where we are
[1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:39.840]  right now last year I was talking about like tsunami wave warnings and right now
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:46.080]  I think what we're seeing is a huge social tectonic plate about to rupture
[1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:50.520]  because you know in that from the 50s with Joe McCarthy being demonized
[1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:55.480]  through Walter Cronkite who was a globalist but pretending to be you know
[1:18:55.480 --> 1:19:00.720]  the most trusted man in America all the way until I guess Dan rather in Memo
[1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:05.160]  Gate was when the new media was able to push back now they can't control the
[1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:10.040]  narrative so now there are forces in two directions they can't just turn this
[1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:14.600]  country into into like Mao's China even though our college students are that

[1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:45.200]  former Navy SEAL comes highly recommended by a lot of great patriots
[1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:48.320]  I consider him a friend of mine now and I've never met him in person you can read
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:52.000]  all of his novels again a lot of stuff he couldn't put in a nonfiction this is
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:56.240]  your short segment long segment coming up so Matt get back into the parallel or
[1:24:56.240 --> 1:25:03.320]  the allegory or the example of the tectonic plates of societal systems and
[1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:09.800]  and incompatible cultural systems and religious systems colliding Matt Bracken
[1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:13.560]  yeah they're not I wouldn't say that they're actually colliding we're like
[1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:18.600]  living in parallel worlds we're living alongside each other but each in our own
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:22.320]  bubbles we're not going to change the BuzzFeed crowd and they're not going to
[1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:27.320]  change us now we're better armed and we know tactics but they control a little
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:30.040]  bit more they can still control much more of the media so they have more
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:35.280]  ability to control the national narrative but neither one of us is going to
[1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:40.640]  win so it's not about I don't see us as winning the culture war but we're what
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:46.240]  we are going to do though is build up so much pressure with our two divergent
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:50.720]  and opposite visions of what America should be that there's going to be like
[1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:56.640]  a big of slipfalt earthquake when these tectonic plates release all this
[1:25:56.640 --> 1:26:01.760]  pressure it's going to be in the form of a brutal civil war similar to say
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:07.200]  Argentina in the 70s Northern Ireland Spain in the 30s that type of a civil
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:12.000]  war where there's not really a front line as much as a war right within the
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:16.960]  society you know drive-by shootings bombings sniping by the way that's what
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:21.000]  I got it when I said more and more we're coming out of our bubbles running into
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:26.280]  each other and it's the left of the globalist calling for violence all over
[1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:32.520]  the world is there a way for us to basically get our revenge by living well
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:36.160]  and basically surviving and not being part of this is there any way to avert
[1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:41.680]  this now there's no way to avert it because as the as the left the Antifa
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:45.160]  side gets more desperate something very important that's going on is this
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:50.480]  unmasking of Antifa the reddit and 4chan you know weaponized autism guys
[1:26:50.480 --> 1:26:55.560]  are absolutely fantastic at collating all of these videos from different
[1:26:55.560 --> 1:27:00.400]  protests and putting names and criminal records on to these masked you know
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:05.480]  anarcho communists but as they become unmasked they're going to get more
[1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:09.800]  paranoid we've talked about this before it's going to be like the 60s with the
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:14.880]  SPS going underground as the weather underground these guys that are going to
[1:27:14.880 --> 1:27:17.360]  that are getting unmasked are going to say I'm not going to any more
[1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:21.720]  demonstrations I'm going to take it to the next level something happened in
[1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:26.400]  Texas last last week I think that's been vastly under-reported because it's
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:31.640]  it's super important because this is not as we as far as we can tell a Muslim
[1:27:31.640 --> 1:27:37.720]  inspired stabbing attack but a left BLM brainwashed person sure and this
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:40.400]  happened in and around the Communists and let me just add our reporters were
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:45.560]  there even got footage of him the media covered this up but the Antifa we were
[1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:48.400]  interviewing these people they were literally and I'm not being mean about
[1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:54.520]  autism but they literally were like half lobotomized seriously mentally
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:28:00.280]  retarded it seemed could hardly talked and were like zombies out of a movie and
[1:28:00.280 --> 1:28:05.040]  that was the leaders most of them couldn't talk so we say weaponized
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:09.760]  weaponized autism that's what the globalists have done well I have a I
[1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:14.840]  have a short story I wrote a couple years ago called Professor Raul X that's
[1:28:14.840 --> 1:28:20.200]  you know if you just Google it or on my website on my essays and links page but
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:25.280]  these people that are the most emotionally fragile disturbed individuals
[1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:30.920]  are the ones that will be the first to take up you know the message once you
[1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:35.600]  once and especially in the university level once you associate hate speech
[1:28:35.600 --> 1:28:41.280]  with violence it becomes in their minds completely legitimate to use actual
[1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:48.040]  physical violence against people people's ideas so for example stabbing
[1:28:48.040 --> 1:28:53.800]  white frat boys becomes a legitimate act of self-defense to people who have
[1:28:53.800 --> 1:28:57.840]  been brainwashed that's right it's a leftist jihad and then the media points
[1:28:57.840 --> 1:29:01.760]  out oh these are mental patients doing it yes they're the ones that are
[1:29:01.760 --> 1:29:06.200]  susceptible and being drug in exactly and we're going to see more of that now
[1:29:06.200 --> 1:29:10.600]  there was a story I was that somebody kicked to me this morning and and right
[1:29:10.600 --> 1:29:16.440]  go Virginia a transformer was shot and then shot the next day so that the oil
[1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:20.520]  leaked out and it seems to me like this was a test or a probe how long does it
[1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:24.720]  take to replace the transformer you know how many lights go out when we shoot one
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:31.000]  transformer there was also a stadium I forget I think New England a baseball
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  game were there let's flesh this out on the other side you're absolutely on
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:38.880]  target meanwhile every major channel TV show says kill Trump kill conservatives
[1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:43.600]  kill patriots they're not human you can see this really being hyped up so what
[1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:46.440]  do we do if they start a shooting war we'll talk about it with Matt Bracken
[1:29:46.440 --> 1:29:54.080]  straight ahead we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[1:29:54.080 --> 1:29:57.600]  GCN radio network
[1:29:59.720 --> 1:30:05.000]  duty honor country those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:10.600]  to be what you can be what you will be they are your rallying points to build
[1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:14.760]  courage when courage seems to fail to regain faith when there seems to be
[1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:19.960]  little cause for faith to create hope when hope becomes forlorn unhappily I
[1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:24.360]  possess neither that eloquence of dictation that poetry of imagination
[1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:28.880]  nor that brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean the unbelievers
[1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:33.680]  will say they are but words but a slogan but a flamboyant phrase every demagogue
[1:30:33.680 --> 1:30:38.520]  every cynic every hypocrite every troublemaker and I am sorry to say some
[1:30:38.520 --> 1:30:42.480]  others of an entirely different character will try to downgrade them even to
[1:30:42.480 --> 1:30:46.400]  the extent of mockery and ridicule but these are some of the things they do
[1:30:46.400 --> 1:30:50.440]  they build your basic character they mold you for the future roles as a

[1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:26.000]  individual right to self-defense we stand in defense of the Renaissance in the
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:35.160]  West as it is under massive globalist sustained siege we are the info war and
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:40.280]  we are now 25 hours 33 minutes of the global transmission we're gonna go
[1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:45.120]  ahead and go 30 plus hours until 8 o'clock central tonight infowars.com is
[1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:48.000]  the website that they hate they're attacking we're getting ready to launch
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:51.800]  the new websites as well that are more modern designs we have the classic
[1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:57.040]  info wars for you as well it is an act of resistance against these people when
[1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:00.920]  you spread the link infowars.com or enemies far and domestic.com and all
[1:34:00.920 --> 1:34:04.760]  of our great guests I'm gonna open the phones up at about 10 minutes on any
[1:34:04.760 --> 1:34:09.080]  topic you want to raise but mainstream media is calling for revolution now
[1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:13.760]  corporate globalist media is calling for their antifa to get violent two years
[1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:18.800]  ago Newsweek said the case for rioting and said attack white people burn
[1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:22.760]  things down it's always weird George Soros funded white people pushing this
[1:34:22.760 --> 1:34:28.280]  this is their deindustrialization program this is their plan to destabilize
[1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:33.640]  the country this is their plan to have cultural Marxism and you see the same
[1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:36.680]  thing with the Muslims in Europe it's a larger program we'll talk to Matt Bracken
[1:34:36.680 --> 1:34:43.320]  about it in a moment 800-25-99-231 800-25-99-231 is the toll-free number to
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:50.640]  join us on this Thursday the fourth day of May 2017 but on May day we saw
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:54.280]  stabbings we saw shootings we saw burnings we saw bombings we saw Muslims
[1:34:54.280 --> 1:34:59.840]  attacking they all work together that's one of the few things that I just
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:03.040]  couldn't believe that the so-called left as bad as they were would be allied
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:08.320]  with Islam when I was learning about it 20 years ago 16 years ago and the last
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:12.480]  six seven years ago you're an Islamophobe now I never supported radical
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:15.280]  Islam or orthodox Islam the things it did I just want to go blow their
[1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:20.840]  countries up and stir them up and you know take out non-radical Muslims and
[1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:23.800]  put the bad ones in which is what the globalists have done it's part of a
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:28.680]  larger plan they've opened Europe on purpose so yeah I got Muslims on the
[1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:31.920]  mind now folks because the ones that do want to be free their heretics and a
[1:35:31.920 --> 1:35:36.440]  lot of more like that but the ones running the show go watch the movie the
[1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:39.360]  promise very accurate about the Armenian genocide what happened to
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:43.960]  Muslims didn't want to play ball now we're killing all the Christians we're
[1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:47.760]  running specials throughout the day we're running some of the biggest
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:51.480]  specials in our history right now and that's how you donate during a fundraiser
[1:35:51.480 --> 1:35:56.000]  we lost basically all the extra money we had for the year that we had budgeted
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:00.920]  to fund things and fund some expansion if you're not growing you're dying against
[1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:05.000]  the globalist and I'm throwing everything I got onto this the savings the
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:08.200]  backup everything to get more talk shows launched more reporters more

[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:31.760]  know fantasy based stuff a lot of people want to only read fiction because
[1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:35.560]  reality is too hardcore for them but just like what James Wesley Rawls has
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:38.880]  woken up millions of people with his best-selling novels it's the same thing
[1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:42.640]  with our guest Matt Bracken who I know I've read two of his books I've told my
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:46.200]  crew I want to carry all those books then for store.com so let's get that done
[1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:50.360]  but go to enemiesfarnanddomestic.com he has his new novel out and we'll talk
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:53.880]  about that before he leaves us at 20 after next hour but I do want to go to
[1:38:53.880 --> 1:38:58.080]  calls at about 10 minutes I'm gonna try to give you the floor now as we've had
[1:38:58.080 --> 1:39:01.800]  some sort segments here to flesh out this revolution they're trying to
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:06.200]  engineer who the globalists are how you think we can win this thing and what
[1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:11.360]  happens if a shooting war starts and what some of the scenarios are former
[1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:16.200]  Navy SEAL counterterrorism expert Matt Bracken from enemiesfarnanddomestic.com
[1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:20.240]  kind of recap for new audiences please and then let's get into the
[1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:24.800]  information you haven't covered yet. First my new book is not out yet it will
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:29.720]  be in maybe two months it's in editing the editing phase right now but the
[1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:34.320]  cover is done a cover art is done I think that what we're going to see as
[1:39:34.320 --> 1:39:38.680]  the as the antifuzz are getting pushed back and unmasked which is gonna make
[1:39:38.680 --> 1:39:45.120]  them very desperate I think we're gonna see a false flag shooting and you know
[1:39:45.120 --> 1:39:49.360]  people say well why would you talk about something as horrible as this you
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:53.480]  know will it become a self-fulfilling prophecy and the reason that I do and
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:58.040]  it's that in my first novel it begins with somebody shooting into a stadium
[1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:05.120]  you know to precipitate a panic stampede a mass casualty terrorism act by
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:09.440]  talking about these things in advance I hope to sort of either take them off the
[1:40:09.440 --> 1:40:14.040]  table as tactics because the surprise element will be lost and if they do
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:18.760]  happen we'll be more prepared to sure but we have new people thousands tuning
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:24.760]  in literally every minute recap briefly the tectonic system going on the the
[1:40:24.760 --> 1:40:30.080]  the the globalist launch revolution that you believe is inevitable and and how
[1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:34.280]  you think that can unfold yeah the globalists are not gonna surrender after
[1:40:34.280 --> 1:40:37.640]  Brexit and Trump and we don't know what's gonna happen in the French and
[1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:41.800]  elects election next but I think that they're moving to the burn down the
[1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:46.800]  house phase which is when they absolutely have run the end of the rope
[1:40:46.800 --> 1:40:53.200]  out you know the the banks are going to collapse eventually and they don't want
[1:40:53.200 --> 1:40:59.520]  to be held responsible it's better to just precipitate a huge revolutionary
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:05.120]  era you know globally a collapse because they figure that you know they've
[1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:11.120]  got the wealth they mansions of castles fortresses stored food gold to ride out
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:15.840]  anything and even if you know half the world's population was gone they figure
[1:41:15.840 --> 1:41:19.560]  they'll be on top at the end and they'll just come back and reclaim their
[1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:22.520]  ownership and by the way we've been talking about that for a decade from
[1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:26.360]  our inside sources last three years every major publication the New Yorker
[1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:31.240]  magazine New York Times Associated Press admit the billionaires are fleeing to
[1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:35.760]  Kauai Hawaii they're fleeing to other Hawaiian islands they're fleeing to
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:41.760]  Tasmania they're fleeing to even more rural areas and in far away areas and
[1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:46.200]  and building armored fortresses and even getting private security firms don't
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:49.480]  they know those very private security firms almost universally hate their guts
[1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:52.960]  and then if everything really goes belly up they're dead I'm sorry Matt go
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:56.840]  ahead although at the top they're surrounded by yes men so I think that
[1:41:56.840 --> 1:42:01.080]  they live in very insulated bubbles and imagine being a Leonardo DiCaprio
[1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:05.320]  everybody around you is kissing your butt 24 hours a day so you know you're
[1:42:05.320 --> 1:42:09.960]  never going to get a it is seconding but that yeah these tectonic sources we
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:14.360]  now can push back we have a new media you know Info Wars is a big chunk of it
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:20.480]  that's why BuzzFeed goes after you I mean I consider it praise not a great
[1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:24.400]  a great thing but like when the Southern Poverty Law Center goes after me or you
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:28.600]  that's great you're known by your enemies if they thought you were nothing
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:31.680]  they wouldn't pay any attention to you they figure that you're becoming
[1:42:31.680 --> 1:42:34.680]  important so that's why they try sure why do you think we get back in the
[1:42:34.680 --> 1:42:38.160]  scenario they had co-bear every other big night show all the other TV channels
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:42.760]  it's still ongoing every day attacking lying spewing against me I don't think
[1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:46.720]  I'm that important I think we're a test case on how to destroy somebody I think
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:49.960]  that you are that important because you're the emerging you're the emerging
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:54.360]  of new media you know we're already talking about Fox possibly possibly
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:58.200]  breaking up for now Hannity staying aboard but I mean there could very well
[1:42:58.200 --> 1:43:03.480]  be you know break up of Fox and a new conservative television network started
[1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:07.840]  so yeah there are big things happening in media Info Wars is part of it but you
[1:43:07.840 --> 1:43:11.920]  know we're not going to win this information war it's impossible to win
[1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:15.920]  because each side is getting their information through their own filter
[1:43:15.920 --> 1:43:21.360]  they've got too many zombies so so we basically have these these two forces
[1:43:21.360 --> 1:43:25.600]  and it actually is worse than two tectonic plates because in many of our
[1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:30.840]  cities and in many of our regions we have three or more cultural and demographic
[1:43:30.840 --> 1:43:35.640]  fault lines all right so when so there's going to be a big a big rupture of the
[1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:40.080]  fault lines the big energy releases when all the buildings and bridges fall down
[1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:44.920]  and socially it'll be catastrophic so yeah we're I think we're going to see
[1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:48.680]  more of these small attacks like the knife attack in Texas but I think we're
[1:43:48.680 --> 1:43:53.280]  going to see a transformer attacks going after the grid there was it looks like a
[1:43:53.280 --> 1:43:57.520]  probe was done in Henrico, Virginia with somebody shooting a rifle at a big
[1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:02.680]  transformer two nights in a row so which which has the hallmarks to me of the
[1:44:02.680 --> 1:44:09.360]  test a stray bullet supposedly landed in a stadium that might ingraze the woman
[1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:12.640]  that might have been a trajectory test by the way that's a great way to demonize
[1:44:12.640 --> 1:44:16.840]  guns especially high caliber that people start going after infrastructure with it
[1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:21.280]  and I've right not only infrastructure but other soft targets and when a false
[1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:27.920]  flag like this is done it's typically done against an ally group of of either
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:33.320]  Islamists or leftists is these are both totalitarian ideologies that
[1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:38.520]  absolutely a hundred percent believe the ends justify the means meaning if we
[1:44:38.520 --> 1:44:43.360]  have to kill all the Christians that's okay or if or if we have to set up
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:49.680]  gulags or death you know slave labor camps that's okay so if it's very it's
[1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:54.480]  a very effective tactic to use a false flag and having to active terror blamed
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:59.680]  on your enemy I would expect it'll be an ally group of Antifa that's shot say
[1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:04.160]  first for example a woman's March it won't be Antifa shooting Antifa but it
[1:45:04.160 --> 1:45:10.200]  will be an Antifa shooting a high-high you know of an assault rifle so called
[1:45:10.200 --> 1:45:16.440]  at say a woman's March or or a you know global warming March by the way that
[1:45:16.440 --> 1:45:19.920]  all came out in the WikiLeaks that all over the country they funded women to go
[1:45:19.920 --> 1:45:24.160]  to start fights to be beaten up and that didn't work they started hiring men to
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:27.720]  separately go do the beating up on camera creating false flags they were
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:32.480]  caught in false flags yes the false flags work wars have been started over
[1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:39.320]  false flags you know the Germans did it with you know operation Hemler right so
[1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:43.800]  there are and many wars started by dictators start with a false flag now
[1:45:43.800 --> 1:45:51.080]  it's it's even more efficacious if you have a a compliant stooge media that's
[1:45:51.080 --> 1:45:55.320]  not going to dig in to the facts behind a false flag but are just going to
[1:45:55.320 --> 1:45:59.360]  trumpet and parrot it a hundred percent so I would I think that the most
[1:45:59.360 --> 1:46:06.320]  likely scenario is not a bomb bomb making requires some skill and the people
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:10.000]  that that do it are likely to leave forensic fingerprints on their
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:15.800]  computer and so forth but to shoot into a crowd and then leave literate right
[1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:20.680]  wing literature at the scene like I have in my first novel enemies foreign and
[1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:25.640]  domestic perfect it's perfect because the the national stooge me they'll jump
[1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:28.600]  right on it and then you'll be a conspiracy theorist if you question the
[1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:33.920]  official narrative right which is that a right-wing gun nuts shot at peace loving
[1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:39.160]  you know global warming marchers and you know the Antifa types and the Islamists
[1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:44.640]  both absolutely think that that is moral and valid and legitimate and let's
[1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:48.920]  expand on that now British ambassador to Syria and others said look we've caught
[1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:52.400]  the rebels launching chemical attacks on Assad at least twice four other times
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:56.600]  we're pretty sure now that we Trump hit this thing within two days or whatever
[1:46:56.600 --> 1:46:59.600]  we get they hadn't gotten rid of their chemicals we get it made Trump look
[1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:02.480]  strong at China and I and I get all the Machiavellian stuff I don't like it I
[1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:08.600]  get it but but I mean you know the ambassador said now the jihadis will
[1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:12.560]  just stage more of these and other false flags to draw us into other things so
[1:47:12.560 --> 1:47:16.600]  so what do you think in general about what happened in Syria well false flags
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:21.760]  work I mean it's it's the old you know who benefits forget the Latin for that
[1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:27.680]  T-bono but yeah so so who benefits two days after our UN ambassador is saying
[1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:33.880]  you know it looks like Assad will be you know stay in power low and behold a
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:38.960]  posed sarin bomb explodes I think that they had some kind of chemical weapon
[1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:44.400]  the rebels and just waited for a Russian airstrike to explode the bomb in the
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:49.160]  middle that the white so these this group called the white helmets you know
[1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:54.000]  they are ISIS basically ISIS propaganda camera teams you know they were the
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:58.080]  ones right on this day admitted propaganda court of ISIS absolutely and
[1:47:58.080 --> 1:48:02.760]  what a coincidence of all the Russian airstrikes in Syria they just happened
[1:48:02.760 --> 1:48:06.480]  to be there with the cameras ready to roll you know ready to go to the
[1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:10.120]  casualties so the and the you know the seven they've been caught working with
[1:48:10.120 --> 1:48:15.640]  them absolutely but if you have a compliance dudes media the 50% of the
[1:48:15.640 --> 1:48:19.480]  country that gets their meet their information from the mainstream media
[1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:23.680]  we'll never know these facts so what we have and then they're gonna try to come
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:27.960]  arrest the patriot leadership and at that point nobody's want to start an
[1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:32.120]  offensive war but at a certain point I guess the police and military we've
[1:48:32.120 --> 1:48:36.280]  woken up to a certain extent and you look at the fissures I think and I'm not
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:40.120]  calling for this I'm just saying if patriots people that are properly you
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:42.440]  know trained and vetted know what they're doing separately without the
[1:48:42.440 --> 1:48:47.360]  orders from headquarters go after the command and control of the globalist we
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:50.040]  can win this quite easily the problem is they're all going to be offshore
[1:48:50.040 --> 1:48:55.000]  directing it through adjuncts and their and their their minions that's why in
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:57.800]  an information war we've got to start publicly identifying just for
[1:48:57.800 --> 1:49:01.480]  informational purposes of course for law enforcement and for trials later
[1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:05.960]  exactly who the adjuncts and aid to camps are to the globalists who will
[1:49:05.960 --> 1:49:10.400]  stay in the operational zone of the continental us when they're trying to
[1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:14.760]  deconstruction operation and follow the money and and I hope you know I don't
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:19.440]  know this I'm just my own hunch because I have known FBI special agents in the
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:25.040]  past they seem to never make it to the high ranks the FBI pyramid is pretty
[1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:28.800]  crazy you know it's really bad at the top but mid-level and several of some of
[1:49:28.800 --> 1:49:33.120]  the most like people they're super guys and and they're patriots and they're
[1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:36.920]  very disturbed by what's going on but the information that they're collecting
[1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:41.280]  might at a later time be put on files that are distributed but if you follow
[1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:45.360]  the money from you know George Soros and groups like him yeah it's the same in
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:49.080]  Europe with these groups that are bringing the refugees in from Libya I
[1:49:49.080 --> 1:49:53.520]  mean they wait a mile offshore on ships and they have these you know hundred man
[1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:58.400]  zodiacs which they don't sell anywhere these are this is all industrialized
[1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:01.480]  funded by Soros and funded by the big foundations we're on a break I want to
[1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:05.640]  come back and play a few clubs and go to calls but we have migrants are being
[1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:09.920]  sold at open slave markets in Libya after Hillary liberated it as the song is
[1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:14.280]  calling her the butcher of Libya your new book I guess is dealing with sex
[1:50:14.280 --> 1:50:20.840]  slavery and how this is ongoing I mean this is incredible yeah it's it's you
[1:50:20.840 --> 1:50:24.760]  have to wonder are they so naive that they think we're going to replace a
[1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:29.800]  Qaddafi or an Assad you know or a Morsi in Egypt and we're going to have
[1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:34.720]  Jeffersonian democracy or you know breakout it's so naive it's all you
[1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:39.240]  always have to ask what if so if Assad's gone will it be better to have five
[1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:43.200]  different Osama bin Laden's worse Syria it'll be ten times worse by the way if
[1:50:43.200 --> 1:50:46.040]  you're a radio listener you're not watching us on TV but I say something
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:50.440]  the search the crew searches it Soros is behind the fleet he just mentioned
[1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:54.200]  chipping in millions of migrants into Italy and other countries like Greece
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:51:00.320]  and Macedonia we'll be back with Matt Bracken and T Intel straight ahead heart

[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:23.240]  red guard to the Mount Brigade and they are like zombies I understand that the
[1:55:23.240 --> 1:55:28.440]  autism anti-globalist autism brigades on reddit are people that are calling
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:31.760]  themselves autistic not in a mean way saying they have like Ashburgers and
[1:55:31.760 --> 1:55:34.280]  they're obsessed with being on the computer 20 hours a day when I talk
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:37.480]  about autism brigades I guess I'm quoting the term not in a mean way but
[1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:41.080]  saying it's like they're getting autistic youth they all pretty much fit the
[1:55:41.080 --> 1:55:45.440]  same deal and then brainwashing them into all this hate whether black white
[1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:49.920]  Hispanic they all have the same MO extremely shriveled sunken unable to

[1:57:57.320 --> 1:58:00.920]  got to do it that's the clip I wanted to play but we also have this clip that was
[1:58:00.920 --> 1:58:05.320]  on YouTube of a lady seeing a guy with a billboard on his bicycle mobile
[1:58:05.320 --> 1:58:08.960]  advertising promoting info wars and a teacher comes over she says she's a
[1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:16.040]  teacher and says I need to be killed for my views so it's not just sad little
[1:58:16.040 --> 1:58:18.960]  communists who I've talked to a lot of them they never really had a mother they
[1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:22.200]  were never breastfeed they were left in their cribs they're really lonely little

[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.840]  weren't breastfed it's just a fact and if you're not held and loved as a child
[1:58:29.840 --> 1:58:33.240]  that's I'm just telling you there's a causal connection these people are

[2:04:55.480 --> 2:05:03.240]  killing people the Constitutional Convention 1787 was held strict secrecy
[2:05:03.240 --> 2:05:06.480]  and at the end of the proceeding citizens gathered outside independence
[2:05:06.480 --> 2:05:09.680]  hall to learn what had been produced behind closed doors while Benjamin
[2:05:09.680 --> 2:05:13.160]  Franklin was leaving the hall a lady asked him well doctor what have we got
[2:05:13.160 --> 2:05:17.840]  a republic or a monarchy to which he responded a republic if you can keep it
[2:05:17.840 --> 2:05:21.080]  but today not only have we lost a republic but most people don't even
[2:05:21.080 --> 2:05:25.240]  know what a republic even is for one thing a republic is not a democracy
[2:05:25.240 --> 2:05:28.680]  republic operates under the rule law which protects individual liberties so
[2:05:28.680 --> 2:05:32.240]  that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority under a public the
[2:05:32.240 --> 2:05:35.600]  government and its citizens all by by the same laws regardless of political
[2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:39.120]  power or lack thereof democracy on the other hand only leads the mob rule
[2:05:39.120 --> 2:05:42.800]  fueled by the unrestrained whims of the public in a democracy the individual
[2:05:42.800 --> 2:05:46.200]  or any groups of individuals composing the minority have no protection against
[2:05:46.200 --> 2:05:50.080]  the unlimited power of the majority it is a case of majority over man in other
[2:05:50.080 --> 2:05:53.720]  words under democracy two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner but under
[2:05:53.720 --> 2:05:57.400]  a republic the sheep's right to life is predicted by the rule law this is Kit

[2:08:45.160 --> 2:08:49.240]  trying to pass the Obamacare repeal today in the house we'll be following that
[2:08:49.240 --> 2:08:52.960]  I want to go to your phone calls very very soon Matt Bracken he is our guest
[2:08:52.960 --> 2:08:57.480]  enemy's part of domestic.com bestselling author former Navy SEAL anti-terrorism
[2:08:57.480 --> 2:09:01.320]  expert really smart guy he's been on hold the last 10 minutes while played
[2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:05.560]  some clips of communists in Austin basically saying they want to kill
[2:09:05.560 --> 2:09:09.880]  people they need to kill people to bring in their their utopia and then a
[2:09:09.880 --> 2:09:14.120]  teacher in New Orleans just a few days ago with a fellow we've had on as a guest
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:18.720]  who goes around with a bicycle and his powers by peddling with a big jumbo
[2:09:18.720 --> 2:09:24.600]  tron TV putting up patriotic messages and people didn't just donate so he can
[2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:28.760]  go around town doing that that's been like six seven years great god so he
[2:09:28.760 --> 2:09:30.960]  told us this happened I wouldn't watch the footage he's saying no I need to be
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:35.560]  killed for brainwashing she's for free speech but I'm brainwashing when I show
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:41.120]  you USA Today last week saying women wear her jibs to stand up to Trump for
[2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:44.840]  feminism when they cut your genitals off put hoods over your heads and your
[2:09:44.840 --> 2:09:48.760]  slaves you can't drive a car and a man can rape you and then you you get
[2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:53.720]  executed for adultery that's not brainwashing I'm calling your brainwashing
[2:09:53.720 --> 2:09:58.520]  Matt Bracken watching and listening those clips what do you make of that well
[2:09:58.520 --> 2:10:03.320]  the people that get in the faces of people at these rallies they're they're
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:07.920]  the useful idiots you know they're the grunts the cannon fodder I see that
[2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:12.240]  from that first clip with the guys with the hoods in a line along the sidewalk
[2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:17.360]  somebody passed along a good useful trick it's an old hunter's trick where you
[2:10:17.360 --> 2:10:22.920]  just take a t-shirt and the neck becomes your your eye slit you tie the short
[2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:26.760]  sleeves behind your head that way you've just got a t-shirt in your backpack and
[2:10:26.760 --> 2:10:31.240]  not a balaclava so it looks better if you're stopped by the police but the guy
[2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:35.880]  that was in the picture was such an idiot that his t-shirt was inside out
[2:10:35.880 --> 2:10:42.960]  and the little tag you know little made in China tag was over his nose yes really
[2:10:42.960 --> 2:10:50.400]  pretty funny but yeah these are just their function is just to continuously
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:55.680]  strike sparks trying to to light a conflagration you know they're hoping to
[2:10:55.680 --> 2:11:00.920]  provoke a patriot into pulling out a gun something like that that's that's their
[2:11:00.920 --> 2:11:06.360]  goal is to you know create a flashpoint incident but what I fear is going to
[2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:12.080]  happen is is somebody on our side will be assassinated and within you know
[2:11:12.080 --> 2:11:16.720]  weeks after that I think that's when the Civil War will break out into a
[2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:23.160]  kinetic phase because as soon as say a figure from the new media is assassinated
[2:11:23.160 --> 2:11:30.080]  then it's going to be an open season on mainstream media propagandists and that's
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:33.200]  right and that's why that and then they say oh the president's called us the
[2:11:33.200 --> 2:11:36.520]  enemy when they're calling him the enemy it's his fault you know Wolf Blitzer
[2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:40.520]  whoever God forbid gets shot Stephen Colbert or whatever but if you expand on
[2:11:40.520 --> 2:11:43.400]  that they're the ones calling for violence they created the environment
[2:11:43.400 --> 2:11:46.520]  they're the ones pushing for Trump to be killed you know this BuzzFeed thing
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:50.240]  comes out they wanted the president dead now the Pentagon pull security clearance
[2:11:50.240 --> 2:11:58.400]  of Trump White House aide s Adam s lovinger a 12-year strategic affairs
[2:11:58.400 --> 2:12:01.680]  analyst with the Pentagon's office of net assessment has been on loan from the
[2:12:01.680 --> 2:12:05.960]  NSC since January when it was picked up at the position by the National Security
[2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:09.080]  Advisor Flynn so they're getting rid everybody that Flynn was involved in as
[2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:13.480]  well I want to go to some phone calls now with Matt Brackett but briefly any
[2:12:13.480 --> 2:12:18.520]  other points you wanted to make yeah the swamp is is winning I think that you
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:22.120]  know drain the swamp was a great sentiment and Trump came into the White
[2:12:22.120 --> 2:12:25.920]  House you know with the best of intentions but the swamp is not just
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:31.360]  surrendering you know the all the alligators and and you know vipers down
[2:12:31.360 --> 2:12:35.600]  in the high thorns are fighting back and it's not you know just even at
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:39.720]  controlling the White House with a Patriot shows how strong the deep state
[2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:44.920]  really is well sure the president's not a dictator despite the fact that the
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:49.400]  news is constantly calling him one it's truly sickening let's go ahead and start
[2:12:49.400 --> 2:12:54.800]  taking some calls from John Brendan Jesse Chris Eileen and many many others
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:13:02.960]  let's go ahead and take a call from Jesse in Tennessee the the volunteer
[2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:09.720]  state you're on the air the stars at night are big and bright deep in the
[2:13:09.720 --> 2:13:15.680]  heart of Texas go ahead brother exactly so we got Stephen Colbert on TV as one
[2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:20.600]  of these Pentagon late-night top show host and he's drudging up Putin and
[2:13:20.600 --> 2:13:26.520]  before that was Jimmy Kimmel trying to play our heart strings what do you
[2:13:26.520 --> 2:13:31.880]  think about Jimmy Fallon broadcasting for a week from a petting zoo claiming
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:37.080]  that he's got separation anxiety from Hillary well that sounds good he's
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:40.360]  also running down our healthcare system you know he's got tens of millions of
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:43.880]  dollars and claiming you know his son has his heart condition and so we all have
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:47.960]  to accept Obamacare that's a screw job it's gonna bankrupt our healthcare it's
[2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:51.640]  all just manipulating the public I'm sad his child has a heart condition it's
[2:13:51.640 --> 2:13:54.520]  just always playing on the heart strings I mean they have free health care in
[2:13:54.520 --> 2:14:00.000]  Venezuela but nobody can even get food same thing in Cuba it's always the
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:03.480]  self-image they always go after your self-image I think it's all they really
[2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:08.280]  have left the late-night talk show hosts you know and your reporters are
[2:14:08.280 --> 2:14:12.160]  outpacing the entire mainstream media you've got Rob do and Millie out there
[2:14:12.160 --> 2:14:17.080]  Millie is just running circles around these protesters it's nuts she is and
[2:14:17.080 --> 2:14:20.520]  look that's why it's so critical that all of you the listeners and viewers spread
[2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:24.560]  the articles the videos financially support us because we're the best there
[2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:28.920]  is right now doesn't mean I'm perfect my crew is awesome we're trying hard but
[2:14:28.920 --> 2:14:32.080]  we're not funded by George Soros or big corporate money we're funded by you buying
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:34.840]  great products everybody needs they're discounted right now during this
[2:14:34.840 --> 2:14:39.560]  fundraiser at infowarstore.com or triple a two five three three one three nine
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:43.480]  yeah what do you make of co-bear who always wants everybody else banned off
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:47.560]  that you know radio or TV if they make a quote homophobic statement and then
[2:14:47.560 --> 2:14:51.400]  everything becomes homophobic you know and you can't make a joke saying that
[2:14:51.400 --> 2:14:56.720]  somebody somebody's butt boy like he claimed Trump was Putin's minion it was
[2:14:56.720 --> 2:15:00.480]  saying he's subservient to him but Trump's not subservient to Putin from my
[2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:05.080]  research man I want to get your take on that he's subservient to the globalists
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:07.840]  that want us to have conflict with Russia because Russia's in conflict with
[2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:16.080]  radical Islam yeah I look at incidents like Stephen Colbert doing his sort of
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:21.000]  like the Colbert scream you know the primal scream that the the globalists
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:26.960]  are feeling a lot of pain because they no longer control the narrative and that
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:31.560]  is a source of tremendous anxiety for them so I expect them to ratchet their
[2:15:31.560 --> 2:15:38.360]  humor up into more open calls for assassination which will be like the
[2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:44.920]  professor Raul X you know parallax view type of nudging the mentally unstable
[2:15:44.920 --> 2:15:48.800]  people towards you know acts of violence sure making it palatable making it
[2:15:48.800 --> 2:15:52.320]  acceptable making it what a hero does let the guy from England that came here
[2:15:52.320 --> 2:15:56.160]  grabbed a gun tried to kill Trump other events great point let's talk to a
[2:15:56.160 --> 2:16:02.040]  caller in the great state of Idaho let's talk to John John you're on the air how
[2:16:02.040 --> 2:16:06.640]  is it going so I I actually live in the point falls area I'm here in a lot of
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:10.680]  the rhetoric what's going on with the Giovanni lawsuit a lot of their top
[2:16:10.680 --> 2:16:16.680]  shows in the area are basically ridiculing you and trying to paint a bad
[2:16:16.680 --> 2:16:21.880]  picture about info wars and yeah what we saw here in Austin is a test of that can
[2:16:21.880 --> 2:16:26.200]  the media go in and manipulate a you know a pool of people this is a new
[2:16:26.200 --> 2:16:30.960]  modern test to then try to shut somebody down but the word is that's that's not
[2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:33.960]  going to be too successful beyond seeing the local papers I mean they claim
[2:16:33.960 --> 2:16:37.480]  Shabbani isn't even basically a Muslim the owner of it he never tried to bring
[2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:41.400]  anybody even in they've been only admits he works with Soros to do it so I mean
[2:16:41.400 --> 2:16:46.680]  it's it's a big joke I'm a little concerned that you might have a hard
[2:16:46.680 --> 2:16:52.680]  time getting a fair jury that's not already been swayed well that's why
[2:16:52.680 --> 2:16:55.600]  folks seem to support us because we're not going to stop you know people think
[2:16:55.600 --> 2:17:00.480]  this is a fight one and the enemy isn't going to strike back they are
[2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:08.920]  well and then also you guys hold land making fun of you on with their own
[2:17:08.920 --> 2:17:11.600]  version of it well yeah they don't just make fun of me they admit it's a
[2:17:11.600 --> 2:17:15.480]  character to me that has fake news it plants fake stories that has bots and
[2:17:15.480 --> 2:17:19.800]  of course it's the government the media that have the bots not us and that's
[2:17:19.800 --> 2:17:22.120]  why they're coming after us yeah they've got all these TV shows you name and I
[2:17:22.120 --> 2:17:24.920]  appreciate your call and I want to make it about me that's what the audience
[2:17:24.920 --> 2:17:30.240]  understand we've been chosen as the case point to destroy you put money behind
[2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:33.280]  us you spread our articles and videos you get around their bots trying to
[2:17:33.280 --> 2:17:38.600]  block us you defeat them this info wars cannot lose though as long as I don't
[2:17:38.600 --> 2:17:43.000]  give up and you don't give up because even if we fall like the Alamo it'll be
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:47.560]  remembered in fours remember Alex Jones but I think we're going to win I mean
[2:17:47.560 --> 2:17:51.280]  we're so strong it's crazy for every attack they throw against us it's new
[2:17:51.280 --> 2:17:54.880]  Tony and physics we just end up getting that much more support back Matt
[2:17:54.880 --> 2:17:58.880]  Bracken you want to comment on that I was about you stole my thought that's
[2:17:58.880 --> 2:18:03.320]  exactly right it's like Paul Joseph Watson's new t-shirt a conservative is
[2:18:03.320 --> 2:18:07.800]  the new counterculture that these late-night comedians unless you're
[2:18:07.800 --> 2:18:13.480]  really one to lobotomize all Uber lefties it's like Soviet propaganda
[2:18:13.480 --> 2:18:19.160]  comedians making fun of Reagan I mean it just doesn't work you're there the more
[2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:22.800]  that they attack you the stronger that you get they're actually they think that
[2:18:22.800 --> 2:18:26.560]  they're applying their leverage against you but they're actually it's sort of
[2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:31.320]  like a judo move the leverage is strengthening you and I don't want to
[2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:34.120]  get to myself but they've they've they've turned I mean I was already an icon of
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:37.640]  the listeners bragging it's a dangerous position but they've really I've talked
[2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:41.880]  to high-level folks even admit it now in in in congressional hearings publicly but
[2:18:41.880 --> 2:18:45.560]  also privately they say they're scared of info wars and they say they're scared
[2:18:45.560 --> 2:18:48.880]  of our audience and the focal point in our guests so they're scared of you
[2:18:48.880 --> 2:18:52.400]  they're scared of Ron Paul and they say we're fake news internal Google documents
[2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:56.160]  because Ron Paul came on they say oh he's he's not credible no he is credible
[2:18:56.160 --> 2:19:00.760]  with the left as well so it's all double-speak but man why are they so
[2:19:00.760 --> 2:19:04.920]  horrified of info wars Matt I mean they really are horrified well they were

[2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:18.800]  turned Senator McCarthy into you know the an evil devil and succeeded at it

[2:24:16.160 --> 2:24:20.560]  the bracket if I don't agree with him it's a fact the globalists and their
[2:24:20.560 --> 2:24:25.920]  socialists and Islamist dominions have decided the course is war
[2:24:25.920 --> 2:24:31.720]  destabilization infighting racial conflict they're the ones selling it
[2:24:31.720 --> 2:24:35.360]  they're the ones doing it they're the ones spewing it with their fake
[2:24:35.360 --> 2:24:40.200]  intellectual garbage and just manipulating the poor people to actually
[2:24:40.200 --> 2:24:44.360]  celebrate I want to live in communism when our poor are the best off in the
[2:24:44.360 --> 2:24:48.080]  world we're taking more phone calls with Matt Bracken right now got a bunch of
[2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:51.560]  clips coming up in the next segment and more calls let's go ahead and talk to
[2:24:51.560 --> 2:24:55.320]  Chris in Florida you're on the year worldwide during our 30-plus hour
[2:24:55.320 --> 2:25:01.480]  global transmission against tyranny and defense of the West so the anti-fascists
[2:25:01.480 --> 2:25:06.560]  ask what could be more fascist than the usury written corporate currency
[2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:11.600]  credit system of the privately owned federal reserve that's as far from
[2:25:11.600 --> 2:25:16.960]  capitalism as you can get some of the more conscientious anti-fascists
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:23.800]  would get this point but let's not forget the Federal Reserve basically the
[2:25:23.800 --> 2:25:26.720]  same banks that set it up helped write the communist manifesto and the 10
[2:25:26.720 --> 2:25:31.760]  planks which calls for a central bank and an income tax everything we got in
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:39.880]  1913 Russia got in 1917 right and was not only the anti-fascist folks but
[2:25:39.880 --> 2:25:45.120]  also the Democrats we can all agree with a higher standard of living that the
[2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:49.520]  immigrants taking our jobs wouldn't be a concern but if we awaken them to our
[2:25:49.520 --> 2:25:53.360]  common enemy the privately owned national banks the Federal Reserve that's
[2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:58.320]  right it's the mega rich who almost to a person they want anybody else get that
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:02.240]  rich they kill you are want a global consolidation so they want failed
[2:26:02.240 --> 2:26:05.520]  ideologies to control us like communism that's a great point let me get Matt
[2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:10.760]  Braggens take thanks Chris yeah it's nothing is really new under the sun
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:14.520]  each generation thinks they're inventing this all over again but you know if you
[2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:18.400]  go back to the early part of the 20th century we saw the same thing with you
[2:26:18.400 --> 2:26:22.240]  know bankers paying Trotsky's way back to Russia helping London get back into
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:26.560]  Russia you know they they like to get in on the ground floor even with a
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:30.240]  communist regime and then by the way that's mainline history books admit
[2:26:30.240 --> 2:26:35.280]  that New Yorkers and Americans and people out of London hundreds hundred plus
[2:26:35.280 --> 2:26:39.440]  thousand fighting men who have been Russian immigrants many of Jewish went
[2:26:39.440 --> 2:26:44.560]  back to Russia and overthrew it that's a historic fact and the and people like
[2:26:44.560 --> 2:26:49.320]  Armand Hammer you know made fortunes dealing with you know these bloodthirsty
[2:26:49.320 --> 2:26:55.200]  tyrannical regimes and who was it was the right-hand man Al Gore senior right
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:26:58.520]  and as long as you get in on the ground floor you're gonna become mega wealthy I
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:02.360]  mean somewhere in North Korea there's a you know there's there are probably
[2:27:02.360 --> 2:27:06.440]  Europeans that are making out like bandits you know
[2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:11.120]  that's the only black guy I mean Russia does a lot of that stuff but Russia does
[2:27:11.120 --> 2:27:14.640]  use slave labor out of North Korea they actually import them on trains they're
[2:27:14.640 --> 2:27:17.960]  like robots and they do whatever they're told and Russia has a small border with
[2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:21.680]  them as you know in a railroad and Russia does use North Korean slave labor
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:27.480]  yeah for for October things like that there's actually a book out I forget the
[2:27:27.480 --> 2:27:33.520]  name of it a Korean who was captured by the Russians excuse me in the Second
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:37.880]  World War Korean who wound up captured by the Japanese forced into fight for the
[2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:42.600]  Japanese against the Russians captured by the Russians then captured by the
[2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:47.640]  Germans then captured by the Americans he wound up he wound up in like five or
[2:27:47.640 --> 2:27:51.120]  six different forms yeah I've read a magazine article about that book I've
[2:27:51.120 --> 2:27:57.440]  got the name of the book right but yeah it's war can be pretty funny the bedfellows but
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:28:01.720]  yeah we're in it we're in an interesting time because we're it's about 100 years
[2:28:01.720 --> 2:28:05.360]  since the Bolshevik Revolution and I think there are something to these
[2:28:05.360 --> 2:28:09.440]  cycles where it takes a certain number of generations for people to just forget
[2:28:09.440 --> 2:28:13.040]  and then think we're in we're you know we're now in a whole new phase of
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:15.520]  history that's right and for every action as you said there's an equal
[2:28:15.520 --> 2:28:18.680]  opposite reaction the globalists are trying to launch their new communist
[2:28:18.680 --> 2:28:22.040]  revolution controlled by the mega banks we're launching our counter revolution
[2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:25.080]  so all these things come at the same time you have the fake Jacob and
[2:28:25.080 --> 2:28:28.640]  communist proto-communist French Revolution that came a few years after
[2:28:28.640 --> 2:28:33.280]  our real revolution but at this time there's gonna be a real pushback you
[2:28:33.280 --> 2:28:37.920]  can have a Russian revolution without armed people they disarmed the Russians
[2:28:37.920 --> 2:28:41.720]  coming back from World War one they were disarmed the soldiers returning they
[2:28:41.720 --> 2:28:44.440]  ordered the general staff to turn their weapons in then they killed them a few
[2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:47.440]  months later then they killed the non-commissioned officers and then
[2:28:47.440 --> 2:28:51.240]  boy the rest was history and the difference is this country we've learned
[2:28:51.240 --> 2:28:56.120]  from these these sad lessons of history and and we have patriots millions of
[2:28:56.120 --> 2:28:59.760]  them I'm sure they're they're probably 20 times more American civilians they are
[2:28:59.760 --> 2:29:03.760]  15s and there are I was about to say in closing Matt let's take some time out to
[2:29:03.760 --> 2:29:07.480]  thank the forebearers to give us the right we already had it but they they
[2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:10.840]  bequeathed and actually defended it secured it they didn't give it to us
[2:29:10.840 --> 2:29:15.160]  but they helped you know crystallize it so that we would have this time bomb
[2:29:15.160 --> 2:29:20.520]  against tyranny this X caliber in the year 2017 that's what it is that's it
[2:29:20.520 --> 2:29:24.520]  that's a perfect analogy it is our X caliber they put it in the stones that
[2:29:24.520 --> 2:29:28.920]  it could be pulled out when it was needed and it might be the time now you
[2:29:28.920 --> 2:29:33.760]  know and and I think that the if I can recommend reading one of my short stories
[2:29:33.760 --> 2:29:38.400]  what I saw at the coup I think we're going to start seeing when it goes
[2:29:38.400 --> 2:29:43.080]  kinetic and we hold on do five more minutes when it goes kinetic with Matt
[2:29:43.080 --> 2:29:51.400]  Bracken straight ahead then your calls we're on the march the empires on the
[2:29:51.400 --> 2:29:57.560]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:29:59.400 --> 2:30:03.920]  prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that
[2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:07.920]  even realtor.com is writing about it but the realtors are still embarrassed to
[2:30:07.920 --> 2:30:11.080]  cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call
[2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:15.840]  uncle Travis's guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness well the
[2:30:15.840 --> 2:30:20.080]  ants may have the last laugh on the grasshoppers but the grasshoppers will
[2:30:20.080 --> 2:30:23.440]  still sing the tune if they can make money but maybe you don't have a
[2:30:23.440 --> 2:30:26.560]  Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your
[2:30:26.560 --> 2:30:30.360]  home theater into a radiation proof bunker there are still very effective

[2:33:21.640 --> 2:33:25.200]  in a moment I'll give you a little history lesson on Excalibur and the
[2:33:25.200 --> 2:33:33.920]  archetype and the Welsh slash botanic I'll be on ethos but I wanted Matt Bracken
[2:33:33.920 --> 2:33:36.920]  to be able to finish up just some other key points and I'll go right back to your
[2:33:36.920 --> 2:33:41.760]  questions but let me introduce myself I'm Alex Jones and I'm trying to fight the
[2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:46.320]  globalist satanic selfish system we've already had them introduce themselves to
[2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:49.160]  us we know what they're all about it's time we introduce ourselves to them and
[2:33:49.160 --> 2:33:54.040]  say get behind me Satan Matt Bracken of enemiesfarneddomestic.com go ahead and
[2:33:54.040 --> 2:33:58.040]  make those points about the kinetic level if we enter the kinetic realm
[2:33:58.040 --> 2:34:01.640]  because we we're already there with them calling for it their attacks their
[2:34:01.640 --> 2:34:05.440]  probing their tracking their demonization of us they're saying kill us
[2:34:05.440 --> 2:34:11.720]  we're subhuman we're demons now look at their weak throngs never involved in
[2:34:11.720 --> 2:34:15.600]  violence never involved in the execution of raw physical power those that
[2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:19.920]  generally are respected even if they're good or bad and it's almost comical to
[2:34:19.920 --> 2:34:25.720]  see them trying to enter a more chivalrous domain well it's it's that
[2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:30.280]  rather pathetic these guys wearing the masks seem like scrawny little weaklings
[2:34:30.280 --> 2:34:35.640]  but I did see a video this John Brown shooting club or whatever they call it
[2:34:35.640 --> 2:34:40.280]  you know they are getting some weapons drink like bang bang kill the cops but I
[2:34:40.280 --> 2:34:44.280]  don't I don't you know expect them to match up in any kind of tactical way but
[2:34:44.280 --> 2:34:49.160]  they don't need to what but I do expect a firearms false flag either shooting into
[2:34:49.160 --> 2:34:54.080]  a crowd of liberals or shooting a liberal media figure but once that once
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:34:58.960]  media figures are targeted media figures and I would have to also say judges
[2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:04.000]  judges that are involved in disputed court cases and I'm not saying it would
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:08.600]  be from the right or from the left but if a left-wing judge say a judge that's
[2:35:08.600 --> 2:35:13.720]  you know involved in amnesty open borders movement you're using their robe as
[2:35:13.720 --> 2:35:18.880]  their weapon as their as their means of you know achieving power when one of
[2:35:18.880 --> 2:35:22.840]  these judges is killed there'll be right-wing propaganda left some kind of
[2:35:22.840 --> 2:35:27.680]  you know like a right-wing connection then we're going to see in a back and
[2:35:27.680 --> 2:35:33.000]  forth and I once judges and media figures have to go into hiding it's
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:37.600]  going to change the completely change the nature of media in this country you
[2:35:37.600 --> 2:35:42.840]  know when when when a Stephen Colbert or an or you know and Alex Jones for
[2:35:42.840 --> 2:35:48.720]  example is taken out I see a rapid escalation and it's going to be at that
[2:35:48.720 --> 2:35:52.880]  point a sniper battle with people hunkering down and going into hiding
[2:35:52.880 --> 2:35:58.320]  then we're going to see bombs the males are harder to use for bombing anymore
[2:35:58.320 --> 2:36:01.840]  sure but how do we get around the fact that the globalists will be in control
[2:36:01.840 --> 2:36:06.520]  of most the major city police forces they're going to order them out hoping
[2:36:06.520 --> 2:36:10.080]  we get a civil war with them what do you recommend the police you've had a lot
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:12.640]  of them talk to me about this they're fully aware what's going on what do we
[2:36:12.640 --> 2:36:16.120]  do when they know it's the globalists and Soros that are launching the
[2:36:16.120 --> 2:36:19.600]  operations to try to federalize them to get them killed get them intimidated in
[2:36:19.600 --> 2:36:23.520]  the strong cities initiative under the UN and even though Trump's in still those
[2:36:23.520 --> 2:36:27.600]  programs roll forward because the deep states and rebellion what do we do when
[2:36:27.600 --> 2:36:31.440]  cops that are even bad guys have a fake warrant to come get you and take you to
[2:36:31.440 --> 2:36:34.920]  some sports stadium where communists are going to torture the hell out of you I
[2:36:34.920 --> 2:36:39.520]  mean I'm sorry I don't want to fight the cops but you know I mean if they're
[2:36:39.520 --> 2:36:42.920]  following illegal orders I have no choice but defend myself at that point
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:46.000]  we'll be in the middle of a shooting civil war and it will be more like an
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  Argentina in the 70s civil war you know with with death squads which will be some
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:56.360]  policemen off-duty or retired ex-military etc but you know it'll be
[2:36:56.360 --> 2:37:00.880]  drive-bys Molotov cocktails through the window that kind of a war it'll be very
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:04.920]  ugly and the end at that point I don't know what the media is what's going to be
[2:37:04.920 --> 2:37:07.960]  left of the media sure I don't want to brag about the conservatives and the
[2:37:07.960 --> 2:37:13.120]  patriots but I mean wouldn't you say on average they're about 20 30 40 times I
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:17.240]  don't want to exaggerate 50 times more trained more vicious more focused more
[2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:21.760]  committed with with with more will than the top of scum we're going to be
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:26.160]  fighting in this happens especially if you if you say who can who can take
[2:37:26.160 --> 2:37:32.040]  targets out at 500 yards plus if you if you're talking about you know 500 yard
[2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:37.160]  riflery then it's probably a hundred to one but it doesn't you know that so the
[2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:41.320]  the street demonstrations will probably be outlawed because they'll they'll
[2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:44.640]  attract shooters you know the street demonstrations will start to look like
[2:37:44.640 --> 2:37:49.720]  Berlin in the 1930s you know with open warfare between street battles beer hall
[2:37:49.720 --> 2:37:55.160]  push right street battles and then we're going to be into a whole new realm but I
[2:37:55.160 --> 2:38:01.600]  think that once a few high-profile media figures are assassinated then I'm not I
[2:38:01.600 --> 2:38:06.080]  can't tell what's going to happen but this this shooting of the transformers in
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:13.120]  Henrico, Virginia it everybody gets everybody with a rifle gets a veto on
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:17.680]  electricity you know and it doesn't suit many people to have the lights go out
[2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:21.880]  but enough people will say you know what I hate the people on the other side of
[2:38:21.880 --> 2:38:25.560]  the river enough I blow up that transformer their power goes down the
[2:38:25.560 --> 2:38:28.520]  people on that side of the river gonna say how come they still have their lights
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:33.760]  on transformers are so vulnerable and the tit for tat spreads from there and the
[2:38:33.760 --> 2:38:37.800]  tit for tat and at the end of the day in my biggest fear as the power goes down
[2:38:37.800 --> 2:38:44.480]  I don't focus on would it be an EMP of solar flare you know our civilization
[2:38:44.480 --> 2:38:49.960]  is based on the mutual respect and and the social compact social contract and
[2:38:49.960 --> 2:38:54.280]  that's being deliberately broken by the globalist usher in chaos and bottom line
[2:38:54.280 --> 2:38:58.680]  the only hope we have of averting this is an well-educated informed information
[2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:02.840]  warfare culture that spreads the word so aggressively we break the back of this
[2:39:02.840 --> 2:39:08.040]  and then if we go into shooting war it's essential that the globalists that
[2:39:08.040 --> 2:39:11.840]  are going to try to do this from 5,000 miles away be brought to justice by
[2:39:11.840 --> 2:39:16.480]  hooker by crook folks and so that's the bottom line if they can't be brought to
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:20.920]  justice because they're sitting in in Patagonia in a you know fortified you
[2:39:20.920 --> 2:39:27.480]  know compound tire but the the minions the downstream minions you know follow
[2:39:27.480 --> 2:39:32.600]  the money the loyal patriotic honorable FBI special agents that have these have
[2:39:32.600 --> 2:39:37.080]  this information you know they've got a save safeguard this information and then
[2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:42.400]  time get it to the Patriots because it's the it's the mid-level minions you
[2:39:42.400 --> 2:39:47.440]  know it's not these goofballs with the black masks you know these these retards
[2:39:47.440 --> 2:39:52.240]  with the black masks and we can't reach George Soros but there are all these
[2:39:52.240 --> 2:39:57.960]  levels in between who's the who's the New Zealand Loudon the New Zealand
[2:39:57.960 --> 2:40:04.520]  documenterist gosh it can't be who's done fantastic work exposing the the money
[2:40:04.520 --> 2:40:08.360]  how it flows from Soros to DNC I know he is he's the older guy does a great job
[2:40:08.360 --> 2:40:13.640]  but right but it's an it's essential that we find out all of these mid-level
[2:40:13.640 --> 2:40:16.920]  lengths you know the ones that are passing out the money the ones that are
[2:40:16.920 --> 2:40:22.600]  you know renting the halls and the transfer all these fleets of buses those
[2:40:22.600 --> 2:40:27.920]  are the guys that have to be there they will be key enemies to take out you
[2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:31.560]  without them the street thugs are nothing and the street thugs are nothing
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:34.720]  basically once it goes and let's be clear we're not trying to plan anything
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:38.440]  offensive here they're all over TV saying kill the president kill us they're
[2:40:38.440 --> 2:40:42.280]  organizing for war they're saying they're coming to kill us we have to try
[2:40:42.280 --> 2:40:46.280]  to fix things peacefully but to secure peace we have to prepare for war as well
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:52.200]  and everybody it's very important there are there are so many scenarios where
[2:40:52.200 --> 2:40:57.480]  this goes sideways you know nobody what if they kill Trump the guys got a lot
[2:40:57.480 --> 2:41:00.480]  of courage he's really out there we know they've you know compromising with
[2:41:00.480 --> 2:41:04.040]  the security I mean who believes that senior secret service agent left that
[2:41:04.040 --> 2:41:10.880]  stuff in her car exactly so I for sure and I think that the chances that of
[2:41:10.880 --> 2:41:15.400]  something like that happen it can happen and it could be some other thing that
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:20.000]  will originally be called a black swan event even though in retrospect black
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:24.320]  swans are all you know foreseeable but you people put on their blinders you know
[2:41:24.320 --> 2:41:28.320]  9-11 was foreseeable but we didn't foresee it in time all right man you got
[2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:31.480]  to come back next week just we need to put you on and by the way I'm gonna
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:34.840]  launch a bunch of roundtable shows with three people five people you name it
[2:41:34.840 --> 2:41:38.120]  and syndicate them our stations want to pick them up all over the country and I
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:40.720]  want to work with you seeing on that other able to but I'm not want to launch
[2:41:40.720 --> 2:41:43.920]  that the next couple months so we need to talk to you and a lot of other folks
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:46.880]  about doing that you wouldn't do it every day because it'd be roundtables if you
[2:41:46.880 --> 2:41:49.520]  wanted to one every day you'd be welcome to and you've got great audio great
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:53.760]  equipment you sound great we want to send you some more stuff but try to you
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:57.120]  know get you on board so let's let's let's stay in contact buddy thank you
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:00.520]  thank you thanks you had also want to set up some more command control centers
[2:42:00.520 --> 2:42:04.360]  around the country smaller sub studios in case let's just be honest case this
[2:42:04.360 --> 2:42:07.360]  one gets wiped out because there's been a don't mean physically there's a lot of
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:11.960]  stuff going on just leave it and that's the greatest form of victory is
[2:42:11.960 --> 2:42:16.520]  replication not just having children but foundations and systems that live on
[2:42:16.520 --> 2:42:21.560]  past you like X caliber which is the great mythos archetype I'm gonna go to
[2:42:21.560 --> 2:42:26.800]  Carlos I'm gonna go to Eileen I'm gonna go to Isaac Brenda and Robert before the
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:30.680]  sour ends we got a bunch of other guest hosts coming in and more since I talked
[2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:37.800]  about X caliber as an example as an allegory as a parable as a parallel let
[2:42:37.800 --> 2:42:46.440]  me go over Roland and the whole archetype of the French mythos and the
[2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:51.320]  dark tower you've got the British mythos the wealth myth you know that comes
[2:42:51.320 --> 2:42:56.320]  out of of course King Arthur that was a true person but you know went into
[2:42:56.320 --> 2:43:00.400]  myth and legend and other cultures have their mythos but but the second
[2:43:00.400 --> 2:43:07.080]  amendment is X caliber in that it's only there when you need it for defense
[2:43:07.080 --> 2:43:11.760]  against tyranny and then when you have to pull the sword there's a great
[2:43:11.760 --> 2:43:16.400]  responsibility that goes with being armed and being an armed culture because in
[2:43:16.400 --> 2:43:22.640]  those old feudal systems everybody but the nobility was disarmed that's what
[2:43:22.640 --> 2:43:27.240]  feudalism was and in fact they didn't have feudalism in the Arthurial time in
[2:43:27.240 --> 2:43:34.160]  all beyond everybody was armed and it was when the Saxons got conquered by
[2:43:34.160 --> 2:43:40.120]  the Norse in 1100 and change I want to conquer that then the true feudalism
[2:43:40.120 --> 2:43:45.000]  began under the Viking kings so you have to understand this myth goes back to
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:51.640]  when everybody was armed but to pull the sword of kingship you had to have the
[2:43:51.640 --> 2:43:56.640]  birthright and that's a spiritual birthright and so now we have this one
[2:43:56.640 --> 2:44:03.000]  of the only countries where we're still armed passed on to us by our ancestors
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:07.920]  X caliber or caliber and is the legendary sword of King Arthur sometimes
[2:44:07.920 --> 2:44:11.040]  attributed with magical powers associated with the rightful sovereignty of
[2:44:11.040 --> 2:44:17.440]  Great Britain again it's the original Welsh system sometimes X caliber in the
[2:44:17.440 --> 2:44:21.240]  sword of the stone the proof of Arthur's linears are said to be the same
[2:44:21.240 --> 2:44:26.720]  weapon and then it goes on with their Gaelic name and then there's the forms
[2:44:26.720 --> 2:44:33.120]  and etymologies of that but the reason this is important is America is hated
[2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:37.280]  by the globalists because the people that set up America believe that they
[2:44:37.280 --> 2:44:45.280]  were actually setting up the new system of human empowerment and freedom and so
[2:44:45.280 --> 2:44:50.120]  again it's that archetypal birthright of pulling the sword from the stone that's
[2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:55.000]  handed down to you but that most people walk by and you know just think of as
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:44:58.200]  myth even though it's sitting right there in the middle of the forest for all
[2:44:58.200 --> 2:45:02.520]  of us to see people can't pull it for you know generations so they just begin to
[2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:07.640]  ignore it and say no man can pull it but you've got to be pure of heart you've
[2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:11.120]  got to realize that all of you that are listeners of the show that are called to
[2:45:11.120 --> 2:45:14.560]  fight globalism and called to expose forced abortion and all these great
[2:45:14.560 --> 2:45:18.920]  tyrannies you have pulled the sword you have a relationship with Jesus Christ and
[2:45:18.920 --> 2:45:25.640]  that's your true birthright and in God's forbeance or forgiveness like the blood
[2:45:25.640 --> 2:45:31.640]  on the mantle or the blood on the door frame so the angel of death passes you
[2:45:31.640 --> 2:45:38.160]  by but you've got to pull the sword the sword is waiting many of you were born
[2:45:38.160 --> 2:45:44.320]  with this birthright you love God but you are a passerby you are not truly
[2:45:44.320 --> 2:45:51.280]  living yet because you haven't taken on the the weight of the sword you have to
[2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:55.160]  pull it and then you have to be able to hold it and then you have to be able to
[2:45:55.160 --> 2:45:58.920]  wield it and it doesn't mean you're ever going to wield it perfectly but you've
[2:45:58.920 --> 2:46:02.880]  got to be wanting to do good and not be a coward and not care what the globalists
[2:46:02.880 --> 2:46:07.760]  say about you in the media says about you and then you can swing the sword and
[2:46:07.760 --> 2:46:13.400]  that's why the globalist hate us I've been on air 22 years and info wars has
[2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:18.560]  pulled the sword of Excalibur we have the sword doesn't mean reason worthy fully
[2:46:18.560 --> 2:46:25.360]  to have the sword but I have the sword you have the sword but info wars is the
[2:46:25.360 --> 2:46:30.200]  very manifestation of pulling Excalibur from the stone and that's why the enemy
[2:46:30.200 --> 2:46:34.040]  scared because we've pulled the sword ladies and gentlemen we can barely hold
[2:46:34.040 --> 2:46:39.600]  it up right now in our journey learning to wield the power but all over the
[2:46:39.600 --> 2:46:44.800]  world the evil has intensified to such a point that good is now coming back into
[2:46:44.800 --> 2:46:49.600]  the universe back into the world back into our plane these people have gotten
[2:46:49.600 --> 2:46:53.360]  humble they have repented they have gotten in front of God at 3 a.m. and
[2:46:53.360 --> 2:46:57.880]  and and you know prayed for deliverance from this and there will be
[2:46:57.880 --> 2:47:02.600]  persecution and tribulation and bad things happening to you when you pull
[2:47:02.600 --> 2:47:08.520]  that sword but what comes bondage and enslavement and abject evil is much worse
[2:47:08.520 --> 2:47:12.560]  if you don't pull the sword and stand when I say pull the sword I mean that
[2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:18.960]  metaphysically spiritually to stand against the enemy not to ridicule those
[2:47:18.960 --> 2:47:22.720]  that try to stand against the enemy and who stumble sometimes but still try at
[2:47:22.720 --> 2:47:31.120]  the great deeds but to join us on the field Excalibur is waiting one more
[2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:35.840]  quote of Alexander Schultz and Eatzen from his Nobel Prize-winning Gulag
[2:47:35.840 --> 2:47:40.000]  Archipelago then he realized we were going the same way as time is Russia and
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:43.960]  went back to Russia to try to reform it which he had some success on Alexander
[2:47:43.960 --> 2:47:49.800]  Schultz and Eatzen who was in decades in a forced labor camp and how we burned in
[2:47:49.800 --> 2:47:56.160]  the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every security
[2:47:56.160 --> 2:48:00.960]  operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether
[2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:06.080]  he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family or of during
[2:48:06.080 --> 2:48:11.080]  periods of mass arrest as for example in Leningrad when the arrests a quarter of
[2:48:11.080 --> 2:48:15.840]  the entire city people have not simply sat there in their layers pauling with
[2:48:15.840 --> 2:48:20.720]  terror at every bang on the downstairs door at every step on the staircase but
[2:48:20.720 --> 2:48:25.040]  it understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:29.720]  downstairs hall an ambush of a half dozen people with axes hammers pokers
[2:48:29.720 --> 2:48:35.160]  whatever else was at hand the organs that's the systems the machine would
[2:48:35.160 --> 2:48:39.360]  have quickly have suffered assortments of officers in transport and not was
[2:48:39.360 --> 2:48:45.440]  standing all of Stalin's thirst for blood I added that the cursed machine would
[2:48:45.440 --> 2:48:53.840]  have ground to a halt if if we didn't love freedom enough and even more we
[2:48:53.840 --> 2:48:59.280]  had no awareness of the real situation we purely and simply deserved
[2:48:59.280 --> 2:49:03.960]  everything that happened afterward Alexander Schultz and Eatzen the Google
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:12.880]  Archipelago 1918 to 1956 the whole I read the book a whole things that well
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:19.000]  written had a lot of time to think about it decades in a forced labor camp
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:27.240]  frozen Siberia visited upon them by the company that previously founded
[2:49:27.240 --> 2:49:31.240]  Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs funded the Bolsa Revolution that's public and

[2:56:38.040 --> 2:56:41.840]  Satanism more and more I realize selfishness arrogance being on power
[2:56:41.840 --> 2:56:45.960]  trips it's disgusting it's like when you're around people on a power trip it's
[2:56:45.960 --> 2:56:49.920]  like they're a robot they're they're just sitting there with a switch thrown like
[2:56:49.920 --> 2:56:53.600]  they're a wirehead in a PKD novel just imagining how great they are it's

[2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:09.440]  proprietary product that I it's like the Excalibur that you were just talking
[2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:14.000]  about I mean it's a way that we can change the narrative we can fund and
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:18.160]  expand the info wars we can arm well send me a letter or tell me about the
[2:57:18.160 --> 2:57:23.640]  product what is it what is it well it's proprietary and but I've already sent you

[2:58:12.760 --> 2:58:15.280]  idea we should do more fun stuff like that I don't even have the crew to
[2:58:15.280 --> 2:58:19.320]  manage those contests so then properly post them all and I even have internal
[2:58:19.320 --> 2:58:22.520]  contester at the office and always seems to go sideways or something but

[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:46.800]  behind enemy lines then we're in conquered territory out here that doesn't
[3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:49.520]  mean there isn't a strong resistance and there are a million oh it's very
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:55.040]  strongly you have the producers they've got all the dumbasses indeed indeed I
[3:01:55.040 --> 3:01:59.800]  just like to say I think the battle of Berkeley is kind of shows a lot of
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:04.120]  people that but these antifa folks they can get the bottom scrapers to come out
[3:02:04.120 --> 3:02:10.480]  but when the you know when the Patriots organized they just rally so much more
[3:02:10.480 --> 3:02:14.400]  support yeah I mean nothing against 90 pound guys but you get like a couple
[3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:17.000]  hundred ninety pound guys trying to beat up a couple hundred two hundred pound
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:22.360]  guys it doesn't go too well yeah and I mean I've seen five-year-old girls that
[3:02:22.360 --> 3:02:27.200]  throw better punches than than the anti-fascist people and whether they'll
[3:02:27.200 --> 3:02:29.980]  hit somebody first and then you actually break their jaw and they scream and
[3:02:29.980 --> 3:02:34.600]  yell and call for mommy it's like dude you know sorry the average person out
[3:02:34.600 --> 3:02:39.280]  here in California the average Democrat and in people just fall into that because
[3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:43.640]  it's group think but and when it when it comes down to you know what they really
[3:02:43.640 --> 3:02:48.000]  believe they're never gonna rally behind antifa they have no support for
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:52.160]  antifa the antifa what you see of antifa is what they can get out there and
[3:02:52.160 --> 3:02:57.080]  that's it and the one the Patriots rally well it gets just larger and larger and
[3:02:57.080 --> 3:03:01.520]  look how the army of the globalists the fake leftists are just like mental
[3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:07.960]  patients that you know from a escaped mental hospital it's it's crazy it is
[3:03:07.960 --> 3:03:12.600]  it really is and I think you know it comes down to winning winning this in
[3:03:12.600 --> 3:03:18.480]  the long range comes down to culture you said it many times and culture is where
[3:03:18.480 --> 3:03:23.040]  we win the war period that's just where we win that's right I figured who it was
[3:03:23.040 --> 3:03:28.040]  that said you want to defeat the corporate structure produce art produce
[3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:32.960]  literature produce culture produce stuff that isn't cookie cutter the modern
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:38.760]  music the modern empty movies the modern just vassal nature of it through the
[3:03:38.760 --> 3:03:42.000]  medium I saw a frontline special like 20 years ago that admitted all this that
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:45.840]  the frontline was still good on PBS admitting that the corporations like
[3:03:45.840 --> 3:03:51.800]  Viacom and MTV were dumbing it down to make us dumb it was the message was the
[3:03:51.800 --> 3:03:55.240]  medium they weren't dumbing stuff down because we were dumb they were dumbing
[3:03:55.240 --> 3:03:58.520]  it down to make us dumb and I know that makes perfect sense but look at how
[3:03:58.520 --> 3:04:02.640]  that's hiding in plain view you up the message it ups the intellectual
[3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:08.120]  capacity of people you dumb it down then that's what we're dealing with exactly
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:11.960]  and you know what they did and they continue to attempt to do and they have
[3:04:11.960 --> 3:04:15.680]  not been successful I must say overall you know they've made strides but they
[3:04:15.680 --> 3:04:19.520]  have not been successful because they take trying to take away the two basis of
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:25.840]  our culture and that is Christianity and Americana and which is free market and
[3:04:25.840 --> 3:04:29.200]  all the rest of it great points I'm gonna come back and talk about a few

[3:05:06.160 --> 3:05:10.160]  consolidation of power first and then corruption it's necessary consequence
[3:05:10.160 --> 3:05:13.800]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite the 1% of the 1%
[3:05:13.800 --> 3:05:17.120]  consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in
[3:05:17.120 --> 3:05:20.560]  government unfortunately we didn't heed his advice and now living in neo-

[3:05:24.320 --> 3:05:27.640]  serve the needs of the establishment political office no longer represents
[3:05:27.640 --> 3:05:30.920]  the voice of the people but rather the initiation process politicians go
[3:05:30.920 --> 3:05:34.600]  through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy simply put we the people are
[3:05:34.600 --> 3:05:38.120]  responsible for civilization and culture yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who
[3:05:38.120 --> 3:05:41.360]  have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world we
[3:05:41.360 --> 3:05:45.080]  falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme against
[3:05:45.080 --> 3:05:48.520]  the other conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us
[3:05:48.520 --> 3:05:52.000]  realize this truth as Thomas Jefferson also said enlighten the people
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:05:55.600]  generally and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil

[3:08:22.760 --> 3:08:27.840]  White House to celebrate as House passes Republican-backed healthcare bill so in
[3:08:27.840 --> 3:08:35.160]  105 days Donald Trump has undone what took Obama two years and what we've
[3:08:35.160 --> 3:08:41.880]  labored under for six congratulations and Rand Paul who I trust who has scanned
[3:08:41.880 --> 3:08:45.080]  over the bill says it's going in the right direction has made a lot of
[3:08:45.080 --> 3:08:48.480]  changes it's not perfect but he hopes that the Senate then tweaks it before it
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:55.640]  goes back to the House in between the conference committee wow so it's a lot
[3:08:55.640 --> 3:08:59.640]  better than last version according to Rand Paul I was just reading his
[3:08:59.640 --> 3:09:03.720]  statements I was just watching him on Fox News making comments 30 seconds ago
[3:09:03.720 --> 3:09:08.120]  the House representatives finally passed the latest Republican revised
[3:09:08.120 --> 3:09:12.240]  healthcare bill to repeal and replace Obamacare GOP lawmakers finally had the
[3:09:12.240 --> 3:09:15.480]  votes they needed to pass the bill the deal will provide an additional aid
[3:09:15.480 --> 3:09:19.360]  billion to help people with pre-existing conditions pay for health insurance some
[3:09:19.360 --> 3:09:23.760]  lawmakers were heard saying yeah hey goodbye after the bill passed
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:27.120]  Republicans will be heading to the White House to celebrate the victory with
[3:09:27.120 --> 3:09:30.320]  President Donald Trump Republican lawmakers even had a case of beer
[3:09:30.320 --> 3:09:35.400]  standing by to celebrate at the Capitol a fierce debate over healthcare took
[3:09:35.400 --> 3:09:38.760]  place on the House floor as Republican lawmakers rallied support behind the new
[3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:42.560]  healthcare bill House leaders called for a vote after winning over some of the
[3:09:42.560 --> 3:09:48.920]  last-minute holdouts we will watch that let's put Trump's quote back up there
[3:09:48.920 --> 3:09:54.440]  this is a big deal because they've been trying to block Trump the Democrats and
[3:09:54.440 --> 3:09:56.960]  others have and then they got a lot of the freedom caucus to go along with this
[3:09:56.960 --> 3:10:01.080]  if victorious Republicans will be having a big press conference at the
[3:10:01.080 --> 3:10:04.920]  beautiful Rose Garden on the White House meeting after the vote and that was
[3:10:04.920 --> 3:10:08.440]  just a little while ago we've not seen his response this is so new Republican
[3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:15.400]  replacement bill passes the House now I want to hit a story that's up on info
[3:10:15.400 --> 3:10:24.240]  wars.com it's getting a lot of attention Bill Nye the science guy in the 90s had
[3:10:24.240 --> 3:10:29.040]  a TV show where he said this is science there's only two genders are chromosomes
[3:10:29.040 --> 3:10:34.320]  decided that's male and female now it doesn't mean you hate somebody that
[3:10:34.320 --> 3:10:37.640]  feels like they're a woman when they're a man or a woman who feels like they're a
[3:10:37.640 --> 3:10:46.320]  man or vice versa. Netflix edits Bill Nye episode to remove segments saying
[3:10:46.320 --> 3:10:51.240]  chromosomes to turn determine gender that was just a piece for kids explaining
[3:10:51.240 --> 3:10:56.360]  why you're a man or why you're a woman there is an assault on reality here
[3:10:56.360 --> 3:11:00.960]  there's an assault on science I saw BuzzFeed last week actually debating is
[3:11:00.960 --> 3:11:06.240]  milk racist because it's white of course the writers know that's bull they know
[3:11:06.240 --> 3:11:11.480]  it's satire themselves but for members of the brainwash cult the race-based
[3:11:11.480 --> 3:11:17.320]  cult they're meant to be programmed to accept brown paper bags as racist green
[3:11:17.320 --> 3:11:22.640]  frogs as racist all language has to be made Prasada non grata so that you can't
[3:11:22.640 --> 3:11:27.560]  communicate with the people so you shrink the the whole system now Nye comes
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:31.200]  in and says last week is episode penalize people that have more than one
[3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:35.920]  child now they've gone in because his old episodes are on Netflix and they
[3:11:35.920 --> 3:11:42.120]  like the memory hole the old Soviet Union or 1984 in fiction they have erased
[3:11:42.120 --> 3:11:48.200]  it they've taken that edit out now in the old days when Stalin killed most of his
[3:11:48.200 --> 3:11:52.680]  top people they would just airbrush them on a famous photos paint them out of
[3:11:52.680 --> 3:11:56.520]  the black and white photos and then colorize them so that's what this is now
[3:11:56.520 --> 3:12:01.720]  that's how crazy and controlling and weird they are first it's banned cartoons
[3:12:01.720 --> 3:12:05.200]  you say are little racist and then I love it when I'm in Latin America they still
[3:12:05.200 --> 3:12:09.000]  got all the great cartoons on Latin Americans don't think that's racist I
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:13.200]  think it's funny this is again cultural brainwashing that's going on let's play
[3:12:13.200 --> 3:12:19.160]  the old memory hold Bill Nye science guy now he's Bill Nye savior of the world
[3:12:19.160 --> 3:12:25.280]  like Al Gore here it is we see a lot of bell shaped curves in nature
[3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:37.960]  normal thank you for joining me on the original episode now he says it's
[3:12:37.960 --> 3:12:48.680]  malefino I'm a girl could it just as easily been a boy though because the
[3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:54.040]  probability of becoming a girl is always one in two see inside each of our
[3:12:54.040 --> 3:12:57.760]  cells are these things called chromosomes and they control whether we
[3:12:57.760 --> 3:13:06.880]  become a boy or a girl your mom has two X chromosomes in all of her cells and
[3:13:06.880 --> 3:13:12.720]  your dad has one X and one Y chromosome that is sexist before you're born your
[3:13:12.720 --> 3:13:16.280]  mom gives you one of her chromosomes and your dad gives you one of his lot crime
[3:13:16.280 --> 3:13:22.000]  mom always gives you an X lot crime dad gives you an X too then you become a
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:28.520]  girl no if he gives you his why then you become a boy see there are only two
[3:13:28.520 --> 3:13:37.080]  possibilities X X a girl or XY a boy the chance of becoming either a boy or a
[3:13:37.080 --> 3:13:42.120]  girl is always one in two a fifty-fifty chance either what crime it's like
[3:13:42.120 --> 3:13:52.200]  flipping a coin X your girl why you're a boy oh she or Z that's the original
[3:13:52.200 --> 3:13:58.880]  episode and here's the new one some people are just lucky I guess
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:12.560]  here comes Bill Nye is creepy dead Bundy serial killer vehicle and Bill Nye
[3:14:12.560 --> 3:14:17.560]  looks like a serial killer when you buy a car you have to get insurance we see a
[3:14:17.560 --> 3:14:22.720]  lot of bell shaped curves in nature here's a Netflix version they cut it
[3:14:22.720 --> 3:14:28.080]  out just ends think how creepy this is this is beyond 1984 they're waging war
[3:14:28.080 --> 3:14:47.000]  on the sex is now joining me on this is the Netflix version they just skipped
[3:14:47.000 --> 3:14:54.960]  over the whole part of the two genders this will be a day long remember you've

[3:16:55.160 --> 3:16:58.560]  through the nightly news with the big extravaganza tonight 7 o'clock central
[3:16:58.560 --> 3:17:03.440]  infowarstore.com as we fund the building of our own independent media and
[3:17:03.440 --> 3:17:07.360]  culture system that is defeating the globalist by simply challenging them
[3:17:07.360 --> 3:17:11.680]  is what they're selling is pure crap their ideologies pure garbage that's the
[3:17:11.680 --> 3:17:18.400]  ideology of zombies infowarstore.com our triple 8253 3139 now John Rappaport of
[3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:22.960]  nomorefakenews.com he's had that URL for 15 years exposing the fake news notice
[3:17:22.960 --> 3:17:25.880]  CNN doesn't want to use that term now because it keeps getting used against
[3:17:25.880 --> 3:17:30.120]  them see they think everything's a one-way street they're so used to having
[3:17:30.120 --> 3:17:33.520]  air superiority they think they're invincible you don't have air superiority
[3:17:33.520 --> 3:17:37.760]  globalist they've jumped the shark trying to shut us down but John and they
[3:17:37.760 --> 3:17:42.040]  got a lot to cover today but and but let me just ask you this why do you think
[3:17:42.040 --> 3:17:46.120]  info wars is undoubtedly even attacked more than Trump some days now my self
[3:17:46.120 --> 3:17:49.200]  lied about I don't think it's that info wars is that important I think it's all
[3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:53.080]  the guests and people we have on that are this whole family and that they're
[3:17:53.080 --> 3:17:56.560]  using us as a test case of how can they destroy somebody who's fearless and
[3:17:56.560 --> 3:18:01.680]  hopefully scare other people away but I don't see that working anymore John
[3:18:01.680 --> 3:18:04.680]  Rappaport go ahead and take over my friend and thank you for joining us thank
[3:18:04.680 --> 3:18:12.040]  you Alex and I think the answer is clear it's independent media success that
[3:18:12.040 --> 3:18:18.160]  they're terrified of terrified and I'll prove it to you as we go along in the
[3:18:18.160 --> 3:18:25.000]  remainder of this hour because when you've got strong powerful expanding
[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:31.840]  geometrically expanding independent media like info wars you've got places
[3:18:31.840 --> 3:18:38.720]  that can break stories that will expose the globalists in ways that keep them
[3:18:38.720 --> 3:18:43.120]  awake at night and I'm not just talking about the ways that we all know about so
[3:18:43.120 --> 3:18:48.880]  far I'm talking about ways that haven't even surfaced yet that haven't come up
[3:18:48.880 --> 3:18:55.200]  yet that are not in anybody's radar yet to a significant extent or enough of an
[3:18:55.200 --> 3:18:59.960]  extent that's what they're afraid of especially with info wars because I
[3:18:59.960 --> 3:19:06.080]  remember talking with Alex on the phone I think it was 2003 or two or something
[3:19:06.080 --> 3:19:11.640]  we ended up doing a show together so you look at the incredible variety of
[3:19:11.640 --> 3:19:17.840]  people that have been on the show that he's interviewed from all walks of
[3:19:17.840 --> 3:19:25.280]  investigative life and the amount of exposure has been incredible and what
[3:19:25.280 --> 3:19:29.480]  are we exposing what's being exposed what's being exposed is the false
[3:19:29.480 --> 3:19:35.720]  reality that is being painted every day by the globalist forces who intend to
[3:19:35.720 --> 3:19:40.680]  control your mind and make you believe that their version of the world and the
[3:19:40.680 --> 3:19:45.440]  universe is the only version that's what they're doing that's where they're
[3:19:45.440 --> 3:19:48.720]  going that's where they've been going for a long time John we're gonna skip this
[3:19:48.720 --> 3:19:52.200]  break and the the one at the end of the hour so you have like six seven more
[3:19:52.200 --> 3:19:55.560]  minutes here since I cut into your time today but what do you make of Forbes and
[3:19:55.560 --> 3:20:00.400]  AP and Reuters all admitting okay aspartame each your brain and okay SSRIs
[3:20:00.400 --> 3:20:03.320]  and major medical journals you wrote about it from fours this week are
[3:20:03.320 --> 3:20:08.320]  causing cranial bleeding and strokes and death you know massive increases and
[3:20:08.320 --> 3:20:11.120]  just everything we've ever talked about this was already the medical journals
[3:20:11.120 --> 3:20:15.560]  is now out there that's why they have to shut us up because people know they get
[3:20:15.560 --> 3:20:19.720]  their news here years months or days before anywhere else they get that at
[3:20:19.720 --> 3:20:25.120]  no more fake news dot com absolutely and as opposed to major media where the
[3:20:25.120 --> 3:20:28.960]  story just shows up and then sinks like a stone in one day we connected all
[3:20:28.960 --> 3:20:34.200]  together yeah we connected all together and we keep pounding on it because why
[3:20:34.200 --> 3:20:38.360]  not you know that's what a sane person does yeah because you know you have a
[3:20:38.360 --> 3:20:41.760]  cousin that's two years old when you're a kid that takes a vaccine and has a you
[3:20:41.760 --> 3:20:45.080]  know aneurysm and dies or you have another family member that takes a flu
[3:20:45.080 --> 3:20:48.680]  shot it almost dies or you have another family member you know I mean you kind of
[3:20:48.680 --> 3:20:53.000]  get pissed off about dying that's right you look around and you see half the
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:58.280]  town is burning all around you so you know the mainstream reporter says well
[3:20:58.280 --> 3:21:02.400]  let's do a piece on this for now a short piece and then we'll just forget about it
[3:21:02.400 --> 3:21:07.560]  no if you live in the town you're not going to forget about it well we all
[3:21:07.560 --> 3:21:12.440]  live in the town folks we all live in this what I'm going to talk about here
[3:21:12.440 --> 3:21:18.200]  especially the medical cartel town where intercranial hemorrhaging which
[3:21:18.200 --> 3:21:24.080]  means bleeding and dying from a highly touted anti-depressants why are you
[3:21:24.080 --> 3:21:27.280]  criticizing death town why are you criticizing death town it's like a third
[3:21:27.280 --> 3:21:31.520]  of the sponsorship a mainstream news how dare you that's right that's right you
[3:21:31.520 --> 3:21:35.720]  can't mess with our sponsors because otherwise we'll go down the toilet well
[3:21:35.720 --> 3:21:39.000]  why do you have those sponsors in the first place if they're killing people
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:42.440]  left and right have you thought about that no we don't think about that we
[3:21:42.440 --> 3:21:46.200]  just think about surviving well let me tell you something you're going down
[3:21:46.200 --> 3:21:51.920]  the drain in fours and other independent media outlets are taking over it's
[3:21:51.920 --> 3:21:55.920]  happening before your eyes and there's nothing you can do about it doesn't
[3:21:55.920 --> 3:21:59.800]  matter what you try it's going to survive and it's going to get bigger and
[3:21:59.800 --> 3:22:02.400]  bigger remember pierce Morgan they were gonna have me on three segments but as
[3:22:02.400 --> 3:22:06.320]  soon as I brought up don't blame guns mostly shooting people are on SSRI's
[3:22:06.320 --> 3:22:10.280]  they cut the interview right there I said your sponsors are selling mass
[3:22:10.280 --> 3:22:16.200]  murder pills oh I didn't see that on the interview I wonder why we got to get
[3:22:16.200 --> 3:22:19.960]  that comment I wonder if somebody still got that on a camera somewhere or we
[3:22:19.960 --> 3:22:23.600]  can find it just Google Alex Jones accuses CNN of promoting mass murder
[3:22:23.600 --> 3:22:29.600]  pills oh great wow go ahead and take over my friend okay listeners I appreciate

[3:22:34.640 --> 3:22:40.200]  through my window here I'm trying to figure out where this came from can you
[3:22:40.200 --> 3:22:48.760]  see this on the camera this came in the window a giant pigeon with a sign on it
[3:22:48.760 --> 3:22:52.920]  that said info wars brought this in the window and now it's sitting here on my
[3:22:52.920 --> 3:22:58.920]  desk it's called caveman it is a product from info wars it's part of the

[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:12.880]  around them because our numbers are increasing and theirs are in severe
[3:24:12.880 --> 3:24:19.920]  decline decline decline the only way that they survived actually during the
[3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:25.480]  election campaign was because of Trump because Trump was such a hide out of my
[3:24:25.480 --> 3:24:31.760]  hot item in the press all kinds of stations and mainstream news outlets
[3:24:31.760 --> 3:24:35.520]  began to see their ratings go up so what did they do there we got to keep
[3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:38.320]  covering Trump we got to keep covering Trump it doesn't matter what we say
[3:24:38.320 --> 3:24:45.560]  because our financial survival is on the line this is the people who bring you
[3:24:45.560 --> 3:24:51.960]  the news this is how they think this is how they think okay so let's get down to
[3:24:51.960 --> 3:24:56.080]  a few I'm going to start off with a few medical stories and then I'm going to
[3:24:56.080 --> 3:25:02.400]  build to a shattering climax here so don't go anywhere okay first of all the
[3:25:02.400 --> 3:25:10.880]  fact that I am on a media outlet at this very second that has millions of people
[3:25:10.880 --> 3:25:17.280]  listening and watching and I am going to expose major major crimes of the medical
[3:25:17.280 --> 3:25:26.320]  cartel which is long-term the most powerful cartel of the globalist cartels
[3:25:26.320 --> 3:25:31.920]  speaks to the nature of free speech no censorship and the increasing influence
[3:25:31.920 --> 3:25:39.360]  and power of info wars and other independent media outlets understand
[3:25:39.360 --> 3:25:46.560]  that the very fact that I'm sitting here doing this whereas 10 15 years ago I
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:50.120]  don't know how many people would have been listening and watching now it's in
[3:25:50.120 --> 3:25:57.280]  the millions and growing all of the time so in the last week in the last week
[3:25:57.280 --> 3:26:04.880]  mind you I've come up with this new study in England
[3:26:05.040 --> 3:26:13.180]  exposes the war on cancer this was a project 29 cancer drugs for 47 cancer
[3:26:13.180 --> 3:26:18.760]  conditions okay long-term project funded with maybe a billion dollars more
[3:26:18.760 --> 3:26:26.800]  okay so what was the result of this well it turns out nothing except poisoning
[3:26:26.800 --> 3:26:34.360]  patients more suffering more pain the most they could squeeze out of this was
[3:26:34.360 --> 3:26:39.440]  to say that it increased the survival of cancer patients we're talking about many
[3:26:39.440 --> 3:26:48.960]  many cancer patients by 3.2 months of escalated intense suffering and pain
[3:26:48.960 --> 3:26:57.880]  because of the chemo drugs that they were being given 29 drugs this is chemical
[3:26:57.880 --> 3:27:04.200]  warfare this is a war crime against the people of England I hope you folks
[3:27:04.200 --> 3:27:08.520]  living in the UK listening to this understand that that was exposed this
[3:27:08.520 --> 3:27:13.800]  week okay antidepressants SSRIs like prozac
[3:27:13.800 --> 3:27:23.440]  paxil zoloft linked to increased risk of skull bleeding interior of skull
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:30.360]  bleeding let's call that what it is they call it intracranial hemorrhage this is
[3:27:30.360 --> 3:27:37.320]  a near death death condition if a person had intracranial bleeding and
[3:27:37.320 --> 3:27:43.640]  somehow knew about it don't know how exactly they would be instructed to call
[3:27:43.640 --> 3:27:50.480]  911 immediately because death would be right around the corner so these
[3:27:50.480 --> 3:27:55.480]  antidepressants which have been hailed as the miracle drug the latest kind of
[3:27:55.480 --> 3:28:02.040]  drug to increase feeling good well-being bringing people up out of
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:06.040]  depression and all of the effects that the public has learned about over the
[3:28:06.040 --> 3:28:10.600]  years mainly due to independent media such as increased risk of suicide
[3:28:10.600 --> 3:28:17.320]  increased risk of aggressive violence like homicide now we can add to the list
[3:28:17.320 --> 3:28:26.040]  skull interior bleeding a condition causing death okay that was another
[3:28:26.040 --> 3:28:32.920]  story this week from your medical cartel from your medical cartel alright new
[3:28:32.920 --> 3:28:44.520]  drug for rare childhood disease called cln2 a rare genetic fatal childhood
[3:28:44.520 --> 3:28:53.280]  disease a new drug called brineura will be selling for $700,000 a year oh
[3:28:53.280 --> 3:29:01.120]  yeah 700,000 a year and because of their humane concern the manufacturer is
[3:29:01.120 --> 3:29:08.040]  going to give discounts which will make the average price $486,000 per year
[3:29:08.040 --> 3:29:13.120]  per patient oh well thank you so much we're down in our knees to you oh yes
[3:29:13.120 --> 3:29:20.640]  indeed we are I'm going to tell you more about this drug brineura after the break
[3:29:20.640 --> 3:29:27.840]  here but needless to say the $700,000 a year is only the beginning of what the
[3:29:27.840 --> 3:29:35.040]  scandal is all about because is this really for example a rare genetic
[3:29:35.040 --> 3:29:41.680]  disease or is it something else entirely we'll get into that as well as what
[3:29:41.680 --> 3:29:49.280]  can this drug actually do for anybody so stay with us here at info ward we're on
[3:29:49.280 --> 3:29:59.400]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:29:59.400 --> 3:30:04.760]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com today I want to talk to you about guns why we
[3:30:04.760 --> 3:30:08.880]  have them why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them and
[3:30:08.880 --> 3:30:13.320]  why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against
[3:30:13.320 --> 3:30:17.520]  it in the press I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second
[3:30:17.520 --> 3:30:21.520]  Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment this
[3:30:21.520 --> 3:30:26.520]  may be a bitter pill to swallow but the right to keep in bear arms is not an
[3:30:26.520 --> 3:30:31.400]  outdated dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Red
[3:30:31.400 --> 3:30:37.720]  Coast no it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776 the
[3:30:37.720 --> 3:30:41.280]  original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain 10 of what the
[3:30:41.280 --> 3:30:46.160]  constitutional framers termed unalienable rights the Bill of Rights came to us
[3:30:46.160 --> 3:30:51.000]  with blinders on it doesn't recognize color or class or wealth it protects not
[3:30:51.000 --> 3:30:56.000]  just the rights of actors or editors or reporters but extends even to those we

[3:34:26.080 --> 3:34:30.760]  sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour here got a little glitch there you saw
[3:34:30.760 --> 3:34:39.480]  the clip that was real that actually happened that was on CNN IS CNN we love
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:46.800]  CNN they expose themselves all the time they're into self-exposure this is not
[3:34:46.800 --> 3:34:52.320]  a mental disorder no there's no stick them attached if CNN wants to expose
[3:34:52.320 --> 3:34:58.160]  itself all the time okay fine and they just did but they didn't air that clip
[3:34:58.160 --> 3:35:02.800]  of course because there Alex was talking about well your sponsors are
[3:35:02.800 --> 3:35:06.600]  psychiatric drugs these SSRI anti-depressants that caused people to go
[3:35:06.600 --> 3:35:12.280]  out and kill other people or commit suicide it's not the guns look at the
[3:35:12.280 --> 3:35:16.720]  drugs you don't want to talk about do you know peers you don't want to talk
[3:35:16.720 --> 3:35:21.120]  about that because those are the people that are financing you and the network
[3:35:21.120 --> 3:35:28.200]  paying your weekly checks and not just CNN all over the place these people
[3:35:28.200 --> 3:35:33.440]  they're restrained they're in straight jackets even if they wanted to break out
[3:35:33.440 --> 3:35:36.600]  they couldn't because of who their sponsors are but we don't have to worry
[3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:41.800]  about that we do not have to worry about that so I was talking before the break
[3:35:41.800 --> 3:35:48.600]  about a new drug for a quote rare childhood genetic disease considered to
[3:35:48.600 --> 3:35:56.560]  be rapidly progressing and fatal okay and they call this disease cln2 okay and
[3:35:56.560 --> 3:36:03.640]  the drug that's just been approved is called brenura okay these are medical
[3:36:03.640 --> 3:36:10.300]  scandals that I just found in the last week okay now what about this drug well
[3:36:10.300 --> 3:36:19.440]  what does it do well it costs $702,000 a year per patient and the company as I
[3:36:19.440 --> 3:36:23.040]  said you mainly decided to lower the price through discounts and the average
[3:36:23.040 --> 3:36:30.680]  price will be only 486 thousand dollars patient we love you all only going to
[3:36:30.680 --> 3:36:39.800]  charge you for 86,000 per patient per year okay great fabulous now the drug
[3:36:39.800 --> 3:36:47.400]  actually does the following according to the FDA it slows down the progression
[3:36:47.400 --> 3:36:54.120]  get this a one symptom of this disease and that symptom is the inability to
[3:36:54.120 --> 3:37:00.200]  walk a child who supposedly has this disease definitely has trouble walking
[3:37:00.200 --> 3:37:04.800]  well how many episodes of having trouble walking does the child experience in a
[3:37:04.800 --> 3:37:10.000]  month or two months well we can say that this drug decreases the number of such
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:15.520]  episodes of not being able to walk that's all it does that's it that's why
[3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:20.640]  it was approved that's why it costs $702,000 a year so it doesn't cure the
[3:37:20.640 --> 3:37:24.920]  disease it doesn't even slow down the disease according to the FDA it's just
[3:37:24.920 --> 3:37:33.280]  mmm we think yeah it will decrease the number of episodes of having trouble
[3:37:33.280 --> 3:37:41.280]  walking and for that you pay $702,000 a year
[3:37:41.280 --> 3:37:50.200]  not only that not only that folks but we now look at some of the symptoms that
[3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:55.320]  the FDA lists here now get this don't go away pay attention come on use your
[3:37:55.320 --> 3:38:03.720]  brains here are some of the symptoms language delay seizures lack of
[3:38:03.720 --> 3:38:10.240]  coordination muscle twitches does that sound familiar to you in any way have
[3:38:10.240 --> 3:38:14.560]  you been paying attention to medical news over the last however many years
[3:38:14.560 --> 3:38:20.600]  those of you in the know will understand that this sounds a lot like vaccine
[3:38:20.600 --> 3:38:30.960]  damage say that again vaccine damage vaccine damage indeed he do but they're
[3:38:30.960 --> 3:38:37.160]  saying oh there's a rare genetic disease clnn2 yes that's what it is
[3:38:37.160 --> 3:38:45.880]  vaccine damage mmm well well well here's what a kid who's already suffering
[3:38:45.880 --> 3:38:52.400]  really suffering is going to be subjected to if they take this drug every
[3:38:52.400 --> 3:39:00.680]  two weeks 90 minutes in the doctor's office with an infusion port inserted in
[3:39:00.680 --> 3:39:09.720]  the child's head to receive 90 minutes of this drug brineura plus other drugs
[3:39:09.720 --> 3:39:17.160]  that the child will receive at the time every other week to reduce maybe the
[3:39:17.160 --> 3:39:22.880]  incidence of one symptom of the disease at a price tag of anywhere between
[3:39:22.880 --> 3:39:31.400]  $480,000 and $702,000 a year and this is called medical treatment okay alright
[3:39:31.400 --> 3:39:37.000]  so what have we covered here this is this week's news right alright so we talked
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:42.400]  about a new study in the UK which destroys the UK war on cancer torturing
[3:39:42.400 --> 3:39:49.800]  patients with drugs pain suffering chemo drugs that are useless maybe increase
[3:39:49.800 --> 3:39:55.080]  the lifespan 3.2 months of intense suffering price tag on the whole
[3:39:55.080 --> 3:40:00.960]  project over a billion dollars total failure okay antidepressants linked to
[3:40:00.960 --> 3:40:08.160]  internal skull bleeding conditioned death right around the corner mmm what
[3:40:08.160 --> 3:40:17.760]  else brineura this $702,000 drug for the treatment of one symptom of what
[3:40:17.760 --> 3:40:23.240]  sounds a lot like a vaccine damage yes indeed indeed you do and then we had
[3:40:23.240 --> 3:40:30.880]  this 18,000 lawsuits lining up that's 18,000 lawsuits lining up against the
[3:40:30.880 --> 3:40:39.440]  very popular blood thinning drug is Zirel toe yes 18,000 lawsuits from
[3:40:39.440 --> 3:40:45.280]  patients who have are now asserting that they've been injured very badly and the
[3:40:45.280 --> 3:40:50.680]  first lawsuit is scheduled to go off this coming week in New Orleans where the
[3:40:50.680 --> 3:40:59.320]  plaintiff Joseph Boudreaux is saying needed blood transfusions after taking
[3:40:59.320 --> 3:41:06.960]  the drug had to go to the hospital okay and had multiple heart procedures done
[3:41:06.960 --> 3:41:13.760]  in the hospital all because of taking this drug indeed you do that's a week's
[3:41:13.760 --> 3:41:21.560]  worth of medical stuff here okay now let's expand the picture what are we
[3:41:21.560 --> 3:41:28.000]  talking about the medical cartel the medical cartel what is that medical
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:33.840]  schools doctors drug companies public health agencies like the FDA the CDC
[3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:39.520]  the National Institute of Health research laboratories doctors doctors
[3:41:39.520 --> 3:41:47.120]  associations like the AMA medical journals okay getting the picture all of
[3:41:47.120 --> 3:41:54.760]  this together all of this together World Health Organization and so forth very
[3:41:54.760 --> 3:42:03.520]  very very powerful now as I've documented over the years many many times
[3:42:03.520 --> 3:42:10.440]  death and destruction emanating from the medical cartel chapter and verse the
[3:42:10.440 --> 3:42:17.400]  numbers and so on and so forth and the members of the medical cartel including
[3:42:17.400 --> 3:42:22.280]  now we can also include media medical reporters mainstream media medical
[3:42:22.280 --> 3:42:27.640]  reporters to stand by and do nothing FDA does nothing the government does
[3:42:27.640 --> 3:42:33.720]  nothing as these drugs main kill destroy lives in America in the West in
[3:42:33.720 --> 3:42:37.080]  industrialized countries in non-industrialized countries all over the
[3:42:37.080 --> 3:42:46.080]  world right and the vaccines as well with harmful toxic ingredients just like
[3:42:46.080 --> 3:42:51.640]  the drugs like from aldehyde like aluminum like mercury yes still mercury
[3:42:51.640 --> 3:43:01.440]  known poisons the medical cartel poisons the world you want a caption
[3:43:01.440 --> 3:43:08.360]  medical cartel poisons the world behind such sophisticated propaganda that
[3:43:08.360 --> 3:43:13.560]  people prefer to believe still many many many people prefer to believe that the
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:19.040]  medical cartel is an angel flying in on wings to save the planet that's quite
[3:43:19.040 --> 3:43:25.640]  inability to turn people's minds off and put them on programming to turn that
[3:43:25.640 --> 3:43:35.240]  around so here's a fact I broadcast it written about it many many times it's
[3:43:35.240 --> 3:43:40.040]  based on a completely mainstream study all the way along the line no fringe
[3:43:40.040 --> 3:43:46.440]  characters no independence even generally American Medical Association July 26
[3:43:46.440 --> 3:43:51.360]  2000 the review is called as US Health really the best in the world you can
[3:43:51.360 --> 3:43:57.920]  look it up Dr. Barbara Starfield was the author I've interviewed her at the time
[3:43:57.920 --> 3:44:03.440]  she was a revered and honored public health expert at the Johns Hopkins School
[3:44:03.440 --> 3:44:14.160]  of Public Health okay got it her conclusion and she told me that was a
[3:44:14.160 --> 3:44:20.440]  conservative estimate every year in the US the medical system kills 225,000
[3:44:20.440 --> 3:44:27.360]  people okay so let that sink into your pores and your brain and your cells and
[3:44:27.360 --> 3:44:33.600]  so forth every year in the US the medical system kills 225,000 people we're not
[3:44:33.600 --> 3:44:40.040]  even talking yet about naming millions of people but the death the death toll so
[3:44:40.040 --> 3:44:44.960]  if you do a little bit of arithmetic and you extrapolate that out to a decade
[3:44:44.960 --> 3:44:51.920]  how many medical killings are we talking about pop quiz give me three
[3:44:51.920 --> 3:44:58.520]  seconds one two three two point two five million killings per decade in
[3:44:58.520 --> 3:45:06.000]  America alone at the hands of the medical system from the drugs from errors
[3:45:06.000 --> 3:45:15.120]  in hospitals from treatment in hospitals okay break that down every year in the
[3:45:15.120 --> 3:45:22.560]  US according to this review 106,000 people killed by the pharmaceutical drugs
[3:45:22.560 --> 3:45:28.240]  alone so that would extrapolate out to 1.06 million killings per decade at the
[3:45:28.240 --> 3:45:34.680]  hands of the medical cartel poisoning in other words in the drugs poisoning in
[3:45:34.680 --> 3:45:45.520]  the drugs mainstream media cover this no hmm not at all biggest story they
[3:45:45.520 --> 3:45:51.520]  would ever cover biggest of their lives this is why all these reporters when
[3:45:51.520 --> 3:45:55.440]  they were so young and had ideals went to journals in school because some day
[3:45:55.440 --> 3:45:59.840]  I'm going to get a story that's going to provide justice across the board and
[3:45:59.840 --> 3:46:04.520]  it's going to be such a hot story at the same time that I can be deployed for
[3:46:04.520 --> 3:46:10.720]  six eight months a year two years to invade the medical cartel and every
[3:46:10.720 --> 3:46:14.720]  nook and cranny and drag people out kicking and screaming and obtaining
[3:46:14.720 --> 3:46:20.920]  confessions from them at the FDA at the CDC at NIH and doctors offices at the
[3:46:20.920 --> 3:46:26.960]  World Health Organization everywhere they will finally confess to their crimes
[3:46:26.960 --> 3:46:31.480]  and they'll say we did nothing about it we turned a blind eye you want to call
[3:46:31.480 --> 3:46:38.160]  that reckless indifference you want to call that negligent homicide I call it
[3:46:38.160 --> 3:46:42.560]  what it is when you stand by and you know this is what's happening when you
[3:46:42.560 --> 3:46:52.880]  aid and abet it that's a murder it's murder it's a mass murder that's what
[3:46:52.880 --> 3:47:02.000]  we're talking about mass murder okay so now I will try to boil down my latest
[3:47:02.000 --> 3:47:07.280]  piece at no more fake news today which was titled why isn't there a medical
[3:47:07.280 --> 3:47:17.600]  Edward Snowden and this is what I mean a consummate insider inside the medical
[3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:24.640]  cartel I'm talking about inside the pharmaceutical complex inside the CDC
[3:47:24.640 --> 3:47:31.400]  or inside the FDA inside at the inside of the inside like Snowden was at the
[3:47:31.400 --> 3:47:39.520]  NSA who collects reams of data emails memos documents you know the whole nine
[3:47:39.520 --> 3:47:44.480]  yards not talking about a doctor who left the profession because he was you
[3:47:44.480 --> 3:47:49.800]  know that's great willing to tell the truth for the first time but not talking
[3:47:49.800 --> 3:47:53.480]  about the whistleblower at the CDC William Thompson we're talking about
[3:47:53.480 --> 3:47:58.040]  somebody who is much further on the inside with data on the whole shoot
[3:47:58.040 --> 3:48:03.640]  match what I'm talking about here who steps out into the open and all of this
[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:11.600]  is published and the entire poisonous globalist medical cartel is exposed to
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:19.320]  light of day for the world the entire planet to see we have no such person we
[3:48:19.320 --> 3:48:27.920]  don't I would know if there is he still contemplating coming forward and the
[3:48:27.920 --> 3:48:33.880]  big question and screwing your brains on this folks come on why not why don't
[3:48:33.880 --> 3:48:38.760]  we have an Edward Snowden of the medical cartel and a lot of people said
[3:48:38.760 --> 3:48:42.880]  well because he knows he would be killed if he stepped out yeah well that's true
[3:48:42.880 --> 3:48:49.560]  of many areas of whistleblowers who feel that they're risking their lives and
[3:48:49.560 --> 3:48:56.880]  yet they do step forward so that argument doesn't wash sorry why don't
[3:48:56.880 --> 3:49:00.520]  they step out into the light of day well let me give you the secret and the
[3:49:00.520 --> 3:49:07.800]  answer Snowden stepped out into the light of day with at least a reasonable
[3:49:07.800 --> 3:49:12.520]  assurance if not more that there was some mainstream journalist out there who
[3:49:12.520 --> 3:49:18.640]  was going to connect with him and was going to reveal at least some of what
[3:49:18.640 --> 3:49:25.600]  he had taken from the National Security Agency but in the case of a consummate
[3:49:25.600 --> 3:49:31.880]  medical Edward Snowden there is no such guarantee because major medical
[3:49:31.880 --> 3:49:40.040]  media and major media in general will blacklist censor destroy turn a blind
[3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:48.680]  eye to and never publish chances are very high that such a really consummate
[3:49:48.680 --> 3:49:54.820]  medical inside whistleblower would never have his data all the emails the
[3:49:54.820 --> 3:49:59.760]  memos the documents that prove the collusion that they're inventing
[3:49:59.760 --> 3:50:05.720]  diseases that they're inventing poisonous cures that they're lying about
[3:50:05.720 --> 3:50:10.080]  phony epidemics in order to force people to go in for vaccinations that are
[3:50:10.080 --> 3:50:17.240]  completely unnecessary and toxic the whole deal right the whole deal the
[3:50:17.240 --> 3:50:22.960]  conspiring and all of that the documents that prove it there is a very high
[3:50:22.960 --> 3:50:28.800]  probability that no major media out that would go after and publish any of that
[3:50:28.800 --> 3:50:37.960]  and so what what is an insider of the dimensions of say a Bill Binney or an
[3:50:37.960 --> 3:50:44.840]  Edward Snowden at the NSA who's a medical cartel insider faced with the
[3:50:44.840 --> 3:50:53.120]  prospect of risking everything of his including his life against the very
[3:50:53.120 --> 3:50:59.360]  strong probability that it will never see the light of day in major media that's
[3:50:59.360 --> 3:51:09.640]  why take this one to the bank that's why we don't have a medical cartel Edward
[3:51:09.640 --> 3:51:16.360]  Snowden and that's why the Rockefeller medicine globalist medicine medical
[3:51:16.360 --> 3:51:24.480]  cartel is still standing and what is their plan and what is their agenda and
[3:51:24.480 --> 3:51:28.080]  what are they aimed to do and what are they doing as we speak if you don't
[3:51:28.080 --> 3:51:36.560]  already know they have created and they're continuing to expand a womb to
[3:51:36.560 --> 3:51:42.880]  cradle to grave system for every human on earth every human on earth will pass
[3:51:42.880 --> 3:51:53.360]  along a bleak line be diagnosed with 30 or 40 diseases disorders in the course
[3:51:53.360 --> 3:51:59.400]  of a lifetime and be treated with highly toxic poisons called medicines which
[3:51:59.400 --> 3:52:08.920]  will confuse debilitate weaken destroy maim that person meaning every human
[3:52:08.920 --> 3:52:14.480]  that's the agenda and therefore make the human population of earth that much
[3:52:14.480 --> 3:52:23.840]  more easy to control the circumstantial case is there for what I just said the
[3:52:23.840 --> 3:52:29.880]  depraved indifference the collusion to produce poisons that are called medical
[3:52:29.880 --> 3:52:35.320]  drugs that we have documented that are killing gigantic numbers and maiming
[3:52:35.320 --> 3:52:40.600]  gigantic numbers of people and this is going on and nobody in the mainstream
[3:52:40.600 --> 3:52:44.760]  not only the press but inside the medical establishment or the federal
[3:52:44.760 --> 3:52:49.240]  government of the US or any other government on earth is willing to step
[3:52:49.240 --> 3:52:54.080]  up and expose it means that we are talking about massive collusion to
[3:52:54.080 --> 3:53:04.480]  maintain this cradle to grave structure to expand it to use it to control the
[3:53:04.480 --> 3:53:11.280]  population of the planet to such a degree that they are too weak to resist
[3:53:11.280 --> 3:53:19.680]  that's the plan that's what I've been able to talk about for the last 45 50
[3:53:19.680 --> 3:53:26.680]  minutes on a media outlet called info wars that now has millions of listeners
[3:53:26.680 --> 3:53:35.720]  and viewers every day you don't think the seesaw is tilting in our direction you
[3:53:35.720 --> 3:53:42.440]  don't think that this is taking off like a rocket you don't think that the sun
[3:53:42.440 --> 3:53:50.320]  has come up on a new day because the day will come very soon if it is not already
[3:53:50.320 --> 3:53:58.640]  here where a medical Edward Snowden sitting in the middle of the medical
[3:53:58.640 --> 3:54:04.680]  cartel will know in his bones and his mind that he doesn't need the New York
[3:54:04.680 --> 3:54:10.200]  Times to publish all his documents doesn't need the Washington Post doesn't
[3:54:10.200 --> 3:54:18.760]  need CBS doesn't need the Guardian doesn't need any of that he can go to info
[3:54:18.760 --> 3:54:26.320]  wars and any number of other powerful independent media outlets that are now
[3:54:26.320 --> 3:54:33.120]  in existence who will gobble up what he has presented wholesale to the world
[3:54:33.120 --> 3:54:40.160]  where people can analyze and expose the crimes of the medical cartel for years
[3:54:40.160 --> 3:54:53.240]  and years and years to come on a daily basis that day it's already here it's
[3:54:53.240 --> 3:54:58.920]  already here and that potential percolating Edward Snowden in the
[3:54:58.920 --> 3:55:08.600]  heart of the medical cartel who according to his sacred oath to do no
[3:55:08.600 --> 3:55:14.080]  harm to aid and healing to protect and defend the Constitution of the United
[3:55:14.080 --> 3:55:22.880]  States and the liberties that it is engendering my prediction will come
[3:55:22.880 --> 3:55:33.800]  forward will perceive that he can come forward and get the exposure that he
[3:55:33.800 --> 3:55:40.680]  needs in order to present the truth that has been held away from planet earth
[3:55:40.680 --> 3:55:49.040]  about this massive medical cartel operation that includes the drugs the
[3:55:49.040 --> 3:55:56.480]  vaccines the hospitals and so on and so forth the Rockefeller modern medicine
[3:55:56.480 --> 3:56:01.640]  that kicked off early in the 20th century with the famous Flexner report that
[3:56:01.640 --> 3:56:08.280]  decided that all of the competition good bad and ugly had to be eliminated and a
[3:56:08.280 --> 3:56:14.800]  new brand of pharmaceutical medicine had to become born and it did and it
[3:56:14.800 --> 3:56:23.400]  developed and it evolved into what we have now a killing machine killing
[3:56:23.400 --> 3:56:35.520]  machine the public is going to learn and is learning as we speak key point folks
[3:56:35.520 --> 3:56:43.440]  the difference between competent medical operators doing the right thing
[3:56:43.440 --> 3:56:50.280]  picking the guy up off the street where he's just been blown apart by a car wreck
[3:56:50.280 --> 3:56:57.200]  bringing him to the hospital and putting him together through correctly applied
[3:56:57.200 --> 3:57:03.600]  medical procedures in other words acute crisis medicine that whole thing over
[3:57:03.600 --> 3:57:09.240]  there which is eminently successful when it's done well by competent people as
[3:57:09.240 --> 3:57:17.520]  opposed to slobs okay versus the long-term care scenario that I just
[3:57:17.520 --> 3:57:24.560]  laid out for you of the medical treatment over a person's lifetime we
[3:57:24.560 --> 3:57:28.000]  diagnose you with this we treat you with that toxic drug you develop new
[3:57:28.000 --> 3:57:32.920]  symptoms we diagnose those symptoms as a new medical condition that requires
[3:57:32.920 --> 3:57:37.560]  more treatment with more toxic drugs that causes more debilitating effects
[3:57:37.560 --> 3:57:41.560]  that we then diagnose as a brand new condition that must be treated with more
[3:57:41.560 --> 3:57:48.760]  and more toxic drugs and so on and so forth down the hill to severe illness
[3:57:48.760 --> 3:57:59.080]  decline and death those are two separate things and I'll close on this
[3:58:00.120 --> 3:58:07.840]  the genius of the medical cartel is the propaganda wing which confuses the two
[3:58:07.840 --> 3:58:12.400]  and blurs those two elements of the medical complex so that the public
[3:58:12.400 --> 3:58:15.640]  believes that one is like the other and the other is like the first and so on
[3:58:15.640 --> 3:58:25.120]  and so forth absolute false falsity not true I hope you've understanding your
[3:58:25.120 --> 3:58:29.800]  understanding here has been tracking with me
[3:58:29.800 --> 3:58:37.280]  this is part of the marathon to defend free speech the truth the info war
[3:58:37.280 --> 3:58:44.280]  info wars dot com to help info wars survive this is GCN the Genesis
[3:58:44.280 --> 3:59:00.600]  communications radio network
