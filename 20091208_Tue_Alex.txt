[00:44.760 --> 00:52.320]  gate fraud and another huge development today Copenhagen climate summit in
[00:52.320 --> 00:57.840]  disarray after Danish techs leak they told the third world they were going to
[00:57.840 --> 01:02.040]  be given all this money from the global taxes turns out it's all going to go to
[01:02.040 --> 01:08.480]  private central banks that was in the treaty that's what the big banks have
[01:08.480 --> 01:12.000]  been saying they were going to set up for at least 20 years but this is new
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.400]  news to the world now the summit's an even more trouble because the third
[01:16.400 --> 01:20.720]  world is finding out it's a screw job to shut down their industry they were
[01:20.720 --> 01:24.440]  sold by the same IMF and World Bank they've been robbing them for more than
[01:24.440 --> 01:28.280]  half a century that this was going to empower them and that this was going to
[01:28.280 --> 01:33.760]  be a new tax on the West no it's actually a tax by Western banks on them and
[01:33.760 --> 01:39.000]  on the people of the West this is a huge new development also investigative
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.400]  journalist at the London Telegraph climate gate Barack Obama's rule by EPA
[01:44.400 --> 01:52.360]  decree is a coup d'etat against Congress made in Britain that is the
[01:52.360 --> 01:57.440]  headline governor Jesse Ventura fresh off the premiere of his television show
[01:57.440 --> 02:04.440]  last Wednesday to record all-time ratings on true TV formally court TV will
[02:04.440 --> 02:08.440]  be joining us to talk about a host of issues until the bottom of the hour
[02:08.440 --> 02:15.600]  then Lord Christopher Monkton coming up in the second hour today from Copenhagen
[02:15.600 --> 02:23.080]  Denmark so you'll definitely want to stay with us for that this is going to be
[02:23.080 --> 02:26.640]  extremely informative and I'm lining up a bunch of other reporters to be all
[02:26.640 --> 02:31.760]  of this this week and next week in the two-week long summit or roughly two
[02:31.760 --> 02:38.400]  weeks was a 13-day long summit being held in Copenhagen Denmark so that is
[02:38.400 --> 02:45.800]  all coming up today as well also more on Senate leader Harry Reid comparing
[02:45.800 --> 02:49.800]  opponents of health care reform to supporters of slavery you don't like
[02:49.800 --> 02:54.440]  socialist government you're a racist it's the n-word has nothing to do with it
[02:54.440 --> 02:59.760]  they just inject that in there when this is actually government slavery making
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.400]  you buy insurance making you have more money taken out of your taxes for this
[03:04.400 --> 03:10.000]  whole eugenics soft kill program that is modern health care and with a 41
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.520]  billion dollar cut a year in Medicare alone that the Democrats have stripped
[03:15.520 --> 03:21.160]  out of Medicaid and Medicare even more than 41 billion total just 41 billion
[03:21.160 --> 03:26.680]  with Medicare alone so they're the ones actually raising taxes cutting services
[03:26.680 --> 03:33.320]  while meanwhile invoking race cards and slavery again they're race pimps they
[03:33.320 --> 03:39.480]  use race as a tool of division we're gonna be breaking that down today as
[03:39.480 --> 03:44.440]  well also I've gotten some emails of people in denial we have confirmed that
[03:44.440 --> 03:51.440]  around the country gun shops Walmart gun shows are demanding social security
[03:51.440 --> 03:57.440]  numbers and ID cards that they scan or record to get into gun shows and some
[03:57.440 --> 04:01.200]  gun shows are just getting the last four digits yes that is really going on and
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.520]  we're investigating that as well very very serious because it's being done
[04:05.520 --> 04:12.920]  outside of the law it's being done literally just as a form of intimidation
[04:12.920 --> 04:17.960]  by the Bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and now explosives they're
[04:17.960 --> 04:23.160]  always changing their name as they run around the nation basically intimidating
[04:23.160 --> 04:28.720]  people but when we get back from break governor Jesse Ventura will be on with

[08:25.960 --> 08:30.520]  Jesse Ventura with us until the bottom of the hour Lord Christopher Moncton
[08:30.520 --> 08:34.920]  joining us coming up 52 minutes from now from the Copenhagen Global
[08:34.920 --> 08:39.640]  Government Summit but I wanted to get the governor on and luckily I caught him
[08:39.640 --> 08:46.600]  because this is his last interview he is leaving in the next 24 hours to Mexico
[08:46.600 --> 08:52.760]  for a few months of surfing and so we are certainly honored to have him on with
[08:52.760 --> 08:58.920]  us a governor Ventura good to have you here so this is your swan song before
[08:58.920 --> 09:04.760]  you escape to Mexico hopefully actually I'm not leaving within the next 24 but I
[09:04.760 --> 09:08.800]  would tell you it will be within the next week okay cuz I talked to your wife
[09:08.800 --> 09:12.200]  and she thought you were leaving but I guess I don't know maybe she's gonna
[09:12.200 --> 09:17.720]  pack me up and we'll be out of here tonight I don't know they're usually in
[09:17.720 --> 09:26.080]  charge boy I tell you have been busy well congratulations on the television
[09:26.080 --> 09:32.200]  show being the highest rated new show in true TV history massive viewer show well
[09:32.200 --> 09:36.680]  it did well you know considering all the options out there Alex and that there's
[09:36.680 --> 09:42.940]  you know literally hundreds of stations that a viewer has to choose from they
[09:42.940 --> 09:46.760]  couldn't be happier I couldn't be happier and I want to thank your listeners
[09:46.760 --> 09:51.200]  and that because they're certainly a part of it now the key now is to keep
[09:51.200 --> 09:55.960]  the momentum rolling and hopefully the show will grow hopefully word of mouth
[09:55.960 --> 10:00.880]  will get out there and there is a buzz believe it or not and hopefully the show
[10:00.880 --> 10:05.120]  will continue to grow in viewership and that way it'll pretty much force their
[10:05.120 --> 10:09.880]  hand they'll have to redo for more and then and then we can continue our
[10:09.880 --> 10:14.920]  investigations and continue in lighting the public and asking the questions can
[10:14.920 --> 10:19.960]  we get definitive answers not always because naturally we can't put anyone
[10:19.960 --> 10:24.320]  under oath and threaten them with perjury or subpoena anybody but we
[10:24.320 --> 10:30.160]  certainly can pose the question and continue to question authority which is
[10:30.160 --> 10:35.640]  good in my opinion and hopefully get more people involved in the process and
[10:35.640 --> 10:41.680]  wake the lemmings up a little bit so did you lose the bet I mean you betted that
[10:41.680 --> 10:47.640]  the show wouldn't air with your crew or or your crew I happily lost the bet it
[10:47.640 --> 10:52.040]  was a gentleman's bet so of course there was nothing involved no material or
[10:52.040 --> 10:58.600]  monetary involvement but I happily lost the bet I never thought that I fought at
[10:58.600 --> 11:03.920]  the 11th hour someone would come in and pull the plug on this project they have
[11:03.920 --> 11:09.040]  not the first one aired of course on harp last week tomorrow night should be on
[11:09.040 --> 11:16.800]  the infamous 9-11 and you know again I defend myself by saying this I went out
[11:16.800 --> 11:21.000]  and spoke to two different three different people who are all at the site
[11:21.000 --> 11:27.920]  when it happened and within that day the other gentlemen spent 256 consecutive
[11:27.920 --> 11:33.240]  days there working and all of these interviews I do with these people tell
[11:33.240 --> 11:38.400]  a far different story than what the government told us now you then ask
[11:38.400 --> 11:42.400]  yourself the question who do you want to believe do you want to believe the
[11:42.400 --> 11:45.960]  government bureaucracy and the bureaucrats in Washington that weren't
[11:45.960 --> 11:51.280]  there or do you want to believe three people who were hands-on two of them
[11:51.280 --> 11:57.680]  surviving the attack and the other one starting that very day to spend 250
[11:57.680 --> 12:03.640]  six consecutive days at the site who do you want to believe well I'll unequivocally
[12:03.640 --> 12:11.360]  state that I believe the people I talked to well for those that don't and I
[12:11.360 --> 12:14.680]  don't want to tip the show off completely so that's why I'm kind of
[12:14.680 --> 12:20.320]  talking in generalities and not naming names sure well I you know have got a
[12:20.320 --> 12:25.920]  large idea of I mean I know the inside baseball and I think people are gonna be
[12:25.920 --> 12:32.120]  amazed when they see this tomorrow night a lot of people couldn't believe this
[12:32.120 --> 12:36.080]  would go on mainstream television they couldn't believe that you would go on
[12:36.080 --> 12:41.280]  and do the harp special and that it would be basically all from our perspective
[12:41.280 --> 12:46.280]  our point of view because the other side was so secretive and you know covered
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.000]  up what was really going on people are really amazed this is a watershed event
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.880]  to have the pro conspiracy view shown but as you said you just went out and
[12:55.880 --> 13:02.680]  searched for the truth and you've shared with me your view on what you think the
[13:02.680 --> 13:08.040]  most powerful episode of the seven episodes is do you want to tell folks
[13:08.040 --> 13:16.360]  that here on air well I'll tell you this the scariest of the seven episodes in
[13:16.360 --> 13:24.200]  my opinion is 2012 and I'll leave it at that that's the scariest one the most
[13:24.200 --> 13:29.840]  bizarre one in my opinion and again this is just my opinion is the Manchurian
[13:29.840 --> 13:37.840]  candidate episode you know and you know Alex throwing everything aside the
[13:37.840 --> 13:41.560]  shows are gonna be very entertaining they're gonna be informative and if
[13:41.560 --> 13:47.240]  people even choose not to believe them they certainly will be frightened by
[13:47.240 --> 13:52.840]  the shows because if they are true it is frightening well I've talked that's
[13:52.840 --> 13:57.600]  what the great thing was about doing these shows and again I'm amazed that
[13:57.600 --> 14:01.960]  they're on the air but you know maybe they just think that I don't have the
[14:01.960 --> 14:05.840]  credibility anymore maybe they just think that it'll be meaningless but the
[14:05.840 --> 14:12.160]  other reason I'm glad they're on the air is a hundred years from now I hope that
[14:12.160 --> 14:17.520]  people when they look back and study about now will realize that not all of
[14:17.520 --> 14:22.240]  us believed what the government said on things not all of us were of the same
[14:22.240 --> 14:28.560]  opinion as the official story and I think that's very important because to
[14:28.560 --> 14:33.200]  every story there's gonna be multiple sides to it and those multiple sides
[14:33.200 --> 14:37.680]  need to be heard and fortunately now we've got it on the record if these
[14:37.680 --> 14:42.640]  seven shows air there will at least be some type of something on the record
[14:42.640 --> 14:47.360]  pretty predominantly that indicates that not everybody believed the status
[14:47.360 --> 14:57.360]  quo well just to be clear I have had a chance to discover what is contained in
[14:57.360 --> 15:03.200]  tomorrow night's 9-11 show and I this is the one episode that I personally
[15:03.200 --> 15:08.000]  thought would probably not air and it still hasn't aired we'll see what
[15:08.000 --> 15:17.040]  obviously transpires tomorrow at 10 p.m. Eastern 9 p.m. Central but clearly I know
[15:17.040 --> 15:20.840]  a lot of people in the production crew and I know talking to you and others I
[15:20.840 --> 15:28.000]  mean that the the 9-11 show I think is the strongest and it is extremely
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.760]  extremely groundbreaking and powerful the information that is going to be aired
[15:32.760 --> 15:39.120]  for the first time in a fair way on national television well you know I've
[15:39.120 --> 15:45.880]  seen it and I stand by everything we did on it I'm proud of the fact that we did
[15:45.880 --> 15:50.720]  it you know I'm of the believer that dissensions the greatest form of
[15:50.720 --> 15:58.720]  patriotism I say that as often as I can because you know I'm a sucker for
[15:58.720 --> 16:03.840]  honesty and I'm a sucker for the truth and and I try to turn over everything I
[16:03.840 --> 16:07.760]  tend to learn it when I think that there's something suspicious and you
[16:07.760 --> 16:13.640]  know bottom line for me Alex is this we're a country that runs by the rule of
[16:13.640 --> 16:19.440]  law or at least we're supposed to and if you follow that rule of law you have to
[16:19.440 --> 16:22.360]  follow it what's it when it's convenient as well as when it's
[16:22.360 --> 16:28.920]  inconvenient and I question the fact that why how can we convict someone
[16:28.920 --> 16:35.920]  before we've even indicted them it runs contrary to everything this country
[16:35.920 --> 16:40.920]  stands for yet people are accepting this and what I'm saying is Osama bin
[16:40.920 --> 16:46.400]  Laden why has he never been indicted for 9-11 why haven't the government
[16:46.400 --> 16:51.240]  convened a grand jury presented evidence enough to the grand jury which is us
[16:51.240 --> 16:55.760]  citizens for us to bring down an indictment it happened eight years ago
[16:55.760 --> 17:02.160]  why hasn't that procedure been followed in our rule of law well you like the
[17:02.160 --> 17:07.120]  other day I was watching these hearings where that senator Graham was grilling
[17:07.120 --> 17:12.600]  Holder the Attorney General and he asked Holder he said if hypothetically you
[17:12.600 --> 17:17.480]  caught bin Laden tomorrow would you read him Miranda and here the Attorney
[17:17.480 --> 17:21.960]  General Hems and Hawes I would have looked at that senator and said
[17:21.960 --> 17:28.680]  absolutely you read him Miranda it's the rule of the land it's our laws you
[17:28.680 --> 17:33.680]  can't you can't just ignore the law because you choose to and then I would
[17:33.680 --> 17:37.960]  have looked at that senator Graham and said well senator I isn't you who
[17:37.960 --> 17:44.660]  decides who Miranda gets read to come on that's the rule of our land well
[17:44.660 --> 17:50.320]  governor Ventura Manson got Miranda read to him Alex absolutely well you
[17:50.320 --> 17:54.200]  you've also made the point in national television interviews that six of the
[17:54.200 --> 17:58.040]  ten commissioners say the 9-11 investigation was a fraud a cover-up
[17:58.040 --> 18:02.600]  farmer the head lawyer has got a book coming out saying it was all a criminal
[18:02.600 --> 18:06.800]  cover-up that the Pentagon was lying that they agreed day one to lie to the
[18:06.800 --> 18:11.600]  public I mean you've got to have your head screwed on backwards to not call
[18:11.600 --> 18:17.280]  for a true independent investigation and to have the media call us kooks for
[18:17.280 --> 18:21.480]  simply listening to what the 9-11 Commission is saying that's a fraud and
[18:21.480 --> 18:25.480]  then we have Khalid Sheikh Mohammed held for eight years they threatened to
[18:25.480 --> 18:29.440]  torture his kids he confessed to everything but killing Kennedy and
[18:29.440 --> 18:33.600]  Lincoln he confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built till three
[18:33.600 --> 18:40.040]  years after he was already arrested well Alex I don't know about that I think I
[18:40.040 --> 18:45.520]  am not that deep into that knowledge but I'll take your word on it you know
[18:45.520 --> 18:52.360]  well exactly and you start looking at this evidence and and analyzing it and
[18:52.360 --> 18:59.160]  it just doesn't add up if you know and and yet we're attacked we're told we're
[18:59.160 --> 19:05.320]  on patriotic because what we question and what's interesting and I will say
[19:05.320 --> 19:12.000]  this about the 9-11 show bear in mind the show starts off with me meeting a
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.720]  9-11 person who lost her daughter who was pregnant with their grandchild oh
[19:17.720 --> 19:23.680]  it's powerful and she's appealing to me to seek the truth well I'll tell you
[19:23.680 --> 19:29.200]  what that's good enough for me yeah I think one mother who appealed to me is
[19:29.200 --> 19:34.480]  good enough for me to go out and ask some questions no it's extremely powerful
[19:34.480 --> 19:37.840]  folks we're not gonna we're not gonna let the cat out of the bag just watch

[22:17.080 --> 22:20.720]  government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with
[22:20.720 --> 22:24.720]  private business creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country
[22:24.720 --> 22:29.160]  ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that
[22:29.160 --> 22:32.360]  is not accountable to our elected government but has also caused the

[24:15.440 --> 24:21.560]  next segment with us and then we've got Lord Moncton coming on today there
[24:21.560 --> 24:25.440]  must be some kind of way out of here from frozen Minnesota to the beaches of
[24:25.440 --> 24:30.080]  Mexico governor Ventura well I'll be getting out of here I gotta go clear my
[24:30.080 --> 24:34.440]  head out for a while Alex I don't know how you do it day in and day out I'm
[24:34.440 --> 24:39.080]  heading down there and right now like all I can think about is dunking my head
[24:39.080 --> 24:44.480]  into the ocean and shaking it you know and clearing my head out start thinking
[24:44.480 --> 24:49.440]  again about taking a deep breath of freedom which unfortunately believe it
[24:49.440 --> 24:54.240]  or not I get more of that Mexico today than I do in the United States
[24:54.240 --> 24:58.160]  Americans have been based it in tyranny until they don't even recognize
[24:58.160 --> 25:03.280]  corruption Lord Moncton was on Russian television talking about how in many
[25:03.280 --> 25:07.600]  respects they're more democratic than England now shifting gears into climate
[25:07.600 --> 25:10.680]  gate because that's something you wanted to comment on you do have a global
[25:10.680 --> 25:16.520]  warming episode coming up later that was produced you know months ago and it is
[25:16.520 --> 25:21.400]  critical and it has Dr. Tim Ball and others plus you have an incredible
[25:21.400 --> 25:25.600]  insider that we actually ferreted out for you I'm not having them on the show
[25:25.600 --> 25:30.400]  until that episode airs just because I don't want to spoil it but you have an
[25:30.400 --> 25:35.080]  insider with Maury Strong who worked for him and with him this is extremely
[25:35.080 --> 25:39.840]  powerful but the latest on climate gate where they confirm their internal
[25:39.840 --> 25:45.120]  emails from the head UN climate center fixing the numbers hiding the fact that's
[25:45.120 --> 25:50.680]  for nine years the earth has actually been cooling well you know the thing that
[25:50.680 --> 25:58.080]  really rose got my intended to go out was their solution to happen trade this
[25:58.080 --> 26:03.480]  is nothing but a shell game and Alex do we even worse than that here's what it
[26:03.480 --> 26:10.840]  is we right now pay taxes to our local government we pay taxes to our state
[26:10.840 --> 26:16.760]  government and we pay taxes to our national government this for the first
[26:16.760 --> 26:24.560]  time ever will be a tax to a world government a world tax that is
[26:24.560 --> 26:31.160]  ridiculous I think yes you know that we're now gonna face taxation from a
[26:31.160 --> 26:39.400]  world entity and that part of it is is unacceptable to me top to bottom and the
[26:39.400 --> 26:45.560]  fact that this cap and trade it does nothing to solve the problem we all
[26:45.560 --> 26:51.440]  will admit that pollution is bad we'll all admit that we the less we pollute
[26:51.440 --> 26:57.080]  this planet the better it is but when the solution that they come up with does
[26:57.080 --> 27:03.440]  not do anything to solve the pollution problem that tells me that there's a
[27:03.440 --> 27:10.120]  fraud involved and that the real reason is to make money for people and that
[27:10.120 --> 27:14.840]  that's really what got me over the top was the fact that this cap and trade is
[27:14.840 --> 27:21.560]  nothing but a shell game polluters can still pollute at the same level all they
[27:21.560 --> 27:26.440]  have to do is buy their way out of it and they're called neutral well that's
[27:26.440 --> 27:32.240]  absurd and it's ridiculous and it's just a way for people to profit well it is
[27:32.240 --> 27:36.880]  that then I want nothing to do with it you know I can't argue with the
[27:36.880 --> 27:42.200]  scientists because there's scientists on both sides of the issue and probably
[27:42.200 --> 27:46.840]  whichever way you lead you're gonna side with that scientist it's just like how
[27:46.840 --> 27:53.000]  do the buildings of 9-11 fall from fires you know you got popular mechanics
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.040]  tells the public oh yeah it can happen easy you got other scientists that say
[27:58.040 --> 28:02.400]  it's a bunch of crap and I personally can't figure out how it they could fall
[28:02.400 --> 28:06.640]  at the speed of gravity at device basic physics and you're a demolition expert
[28:06.640 --> 28:12.720]  exactly well anyway so I'm not gonna get into the argument of the scientific
[28:12.720 --> 28:17.480]  end of it I'll get into the political end of it which this cap and trade is
[28:17.480 --> 28:24.560]  pure bull top to bottom it does nothing to solve the problem and that's what
[28:24.560 --> 28:29.080]  we're gonna have lamb down our throat at this conference well that clearly tells
[28:29.080 --> 28:33.520]  me that the problem can't be that important to begin with if they won't
[28:33.520 --> 28:37.960]  even seek out a solution that would attempt to cure it well governor there's
[28:37.960 --> 28:44.080]  lots of real pollution like toxic waste overfishing but carbon dioxide I mean
[28:44.080 --> 28:48.280]  the amount that humans put out we exhale carbon dioxide the EPA's listing it as a
[28:48.280 --> 28:53.560]  toxic waste it's what plants live off of they then put off oxygen I mean it's a
[28:53.560 --> 28:57.600]  it's a fraud it's a distraction from all the real environmental problems and now
[28:57.600 --> 29:04.240]  an internal Copenhagen climate summit is in disarray after Danish text leak this
[29:04.240 --> 29:08.920]  is London Guardian the secret text of the agreement has been released where the
[29:08.920 --> 29:14.880]  taxes aren't even paid to the UN they're paid to private corporations private
[29:14.880 --> 29:21.760]  banks setting up a private global corporate government horrible and if we
[29:21.760 --> 29:29.040]  allow this to happen then we deserve what we get Alex governor Jesse Ventura
[29:29.040 --> 29:32.440]  he'll do five six more minutes with us on the other side on some other key
[29:32.440 --> 29:37.400]  issues and Lord Christopher Moncton coming up but tomorrow night the most
[29:37.400 --> 29:42.160]  powerful 9-11 information ever on mainstream television 10 p.m. Eastern
[29:42.160 --> 29:52.360]  9 p.m. Central conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura we're on the March the
[29:52.360 --> 30:01.080]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with
[30:01.080 --> 30:04.840]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[30:04.840 --> 30:08.600]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[30:08.600 --> 30:13.120]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[30:13.120 --> 30:17.320]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[30:17.320 --> 30:21.960]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[30:21.960 --> 30:25.960]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[30:25.960 --> 30:30.080]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[30:30.080 --> 30:34.040]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[30:34.040 --> 30:38.200]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[30:38.200 --> 30:42.000]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[30:42.000 --> 30:45.880]  power generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[32:05.120 --> 32:09.680]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[32:09.680 --> 32:13.160]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[32:13.160 --> 32:18.680]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[32:18.680 --> 32:23.960]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[32:23.960 --> 32:28.000]  attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[32:28.000 --> 32:33.200]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[32:33.200 --> 32:36.880]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[32:36.880 --> 32:40.400]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[32:40.400 --> 32:45.640]  check out? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[32:45.640 --> 32:51.280]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[33:26.640 --> 33:31.680]  simulcasting since the start of the show at prisonplanet.tv for viewers there
[33:31.680 --> 33:37.040]  and my new film Fall of the Republic ladies and gentlemen has an hour in the
[33:37.040 --> 33:41.320]  two hour 24 minutes on the whole climate fraud how the banks are setting up a
[33:41.320 --> 33:44.480]  private global corporate government from their own documents that's now
[33:44.480 --> 33:49.400]  mainstream news today but in a film I released a month and a half ago Fall of
[33:49.400 --> 33:53.920]  the Republic available at info wars.com. Governor Jesse Ventura I want to finish
[33:53.920 --> 33:57.720]  up with Climategate and then finally ask you what are you most upset about what
[33:57.720 --> 34:02.200]  are you most outraged with currently but with Climategate how do we have the UN
[34:02.200 --> 34:05.520]  investigate it when they're behind it how do we have the British government
[34:05.520 --> 34:08.960]  investigate when they're behind it how do we have the federal government
[34:08.960 --> 34:13.800]  investigate when they want this new taxation control grid over all human
[34:13.800 --> 34:19.360]  activity well you know it simply comes back to the fact that we we have to protest we
[34:19.360 --> 34:24.440]  have to let our elected officials know that this is unacceptable and people
[34:24.440 --> 34:28.920]  have to stand up for what they believe that in the country now ultimately can
[34:28.920 --> 34:34.600]  you prevail there's no guarantee of that but certainly I would hope our country
[34:34.600 --> 34:39.480]  still has the freedom that people are allowed to persist on an opposite few
[34:39.480 --> 34:45.120]  points and not be you know attempted to be destroyed just because they think
[34:45.120 --> 34:50.480]  something's different than the status quo says it is so if you're outraged over
[34:50.480 --> 34:55.200]  global warming and you're outraged over cap and trade let your congressmen and
[34:55.200 --> 34:59.840]  senators know that because the the biggest thing you can do is to make a
[34:59.840 --> 35:04.920]  phone call or write a letter to him trust me always remember these guys
[35:04.920 --> 35:11.040]  ultimate goal is to be reelected they're there to serve themselves they're not
[35:11.040 --> 35:15.760]  there to serve us career politicians it's just what it's called it's their
[35:15.760 --> 35:20.800]  career well they're not going to jeopardize their careers and if there's
[35:20.800 --> 35:26.440]  enough outrage voiced by the public they will then listen if there's no
[35:26.440 --> 35:31.040]  outrage trust me you're gonna get it rammed down your throat if there's no
[35:31.040 --> 35:36.000]  threat to their careers they will do whatever well they damn please well
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.280]  that's a good point it's in the news today in the Washington Post and
[35:39.280 --> 35:43.920]  Washington Times that senior Democratic leaders like senator Webb warned
[35:43.920 --> 35:49.480]  Obama on taking action in Copenhagen saying look this is red-handed fraud they
[35:49.480 --> 35:53.760]  know the earth's getting cooler they admit it's just a taxing power grab more
[35:53.760 --> 35:59.240]  documents are leaking out the system is bleeding out right now this is now being
[35:59.240 --> 36:02.880]  called the greatest scientific fraud in modern history and there's been many
[36:02.880 --> 36:08.960]  scientific frauds and the the the Democrats are now panicking saying look
[36:08.960 --> 36:13.600]  you better abandon this and now the third world countries got the secret
[36:13.600 --> 36:17.560]  documents today that it's really a tax on them to stop their development when
[36:17.560 --> 36:21.040]  they were promised Western money see they tell the third world oh you're gonna
[36:21.040 --> 36:24.680]  get to rob the West and then when really it's the big banks planning to rob them
[36:24.680 --> 36:31.040]  so this whole thing is sinking well I hope that it does you know if it don't
[36:31.040 --> 36:35.960]  like I said the best thing people to do is be vocal and active take that time
[36:35.960 --> 36:42.280]  write that letter make that phone call but let me also say this be civil with
[36:42.280 --> 36:49.840]  your phone calls no personal insults no personal attacks state your business
[36:49.840 --> 36:55.080]  state that you that what you feel and how you feel they should react to that
[36:55.080 --> 37:01.320]  but don't don't dig yourself into a hole by insulting anyone that's the worst
[37:01.320 --> 37:06.080]  thing you can do when you make contact with an elected official is throw an
[37:06.080 --> 37:11.520]  assault at them you don't want to do that but you can still be firm in your
[37:11.520 --> 37:17.400]  viewpoint now Alex moving ahead I'll tell you what's outraging me right now the
[37:17.400 --> 37:22.000]  war in Afghanistan and the fact that we're gonna put 30,000 of our troops
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.960]  in there and increase it all while this country feels no pain we if we're gonna
[37:27.960 --> 37:32.680]  go to these two wars then it's time to implement a war tax to pay for them
[37:32.680 --> 37:37.720]  imagine what we're doing Alex we're not overly sending our young men and women
[37:37.720 --> 37:42.160]  over there to die we're gonna make it so when they come home they'll get to pay
[37:42.160 --> 37:47.360]  for it for the rest of their lives because this generation doesn't have the
[37:47.360 --> 37:52.640]  courage enough to either stand up and get out of these wars or at least damn
[37:52.640 --> 37:58.960]  well pay for them if we're gonna fight them I also am outraged that a draft is
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.680]  not being reinstituted immediately you've got guys that have been over there
[38:03.680 --> 38:11.240]  for five six and seven tours of duty that's inhumane they need relief in
[38:11.240 --> 38:16.320]  implement the draft and you will see the wars not get bigger you will see them
[38:16.320 --> 38:21.760]  come to an end because when little Johnny who doesn't want to go gets drafted
[38:21.760 --> 38:27.480]  and a year later comes home in a body bag that has a powerful influence on the
[38:27.480 --> 38:33.160]  neighborhood trust me so you agree with congressman wrangle that the way to end
[38:33.160 --> 38:39.040]  wars is to have a draft and my problem with that is the new draft the National
[38:39.040 --> 38:43.800]  Compulsory Service Act and the National Service Act they have two different
[38:43.800 --> 38:48.320]  bills is going the government's going to be able to decide who gets to stay and
[38:48.320 --> 38:54.440]  who gets to go and they're going to build a domestic army where they'll get to
[38:54.440 --> 38:59.080]  be basically a little Nazi brown shirt thugs spying on their neighbors and so
[38:59.080 --> 39:07.080]  all the politico kids like George W. Bush they're going to get to be domestic
[39:07.080 --> 39:12.080]  thugs but then all the before we jump to those conclusions let's see that
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.280]  nobody has the courage to bring the draft back in the first place it's not
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.320]  gonna happen are you kidding me are you angry at Obama I mean is he really gone
[39:21.320 --> 39:26.480]  back I agree I'm angry that he would escalate that war over there after he
[39:26.480 --> 39:31.240]  told us he was getting us out because I'm an advocate of the true patriot right
[39:31.240 --> 39:36.080]  now is to bring you know I wish I had in front of me the letter that my son
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.560]  sent to me on Veterans Day talking about how we have to be diligent how we've
[39:41.560 --> 39:47.000]  dropped the ball because it's our job as the civilians to protect our military
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.800]  and we have not done a good job on that and what I mean by that is we're to
[39:52.800 --> 39:56.840]  protect them they're not to go out there and fight unless there's a direct
[39:56.840 --> 40:04.080]  national interest to us and this stuff about fighting terrorism by going over
[40:04.080 --> 40:09.240]  and invading countries and occupying the countries with our military that is
[40:09.240 --> 40:15.080]  going to do nothing to stop terrorism it's like tap-and-trade it's in fact
[40:15.080 --> 40:20.160]  it's gonna create more terrorists because if you occupy a nation they're
[40:20.160 --> 40:25.840]  gonna hate you they don't love you imagine for a minute of Hugo Chavez with
[40:25.840 --> 40:31.000]  all his money bought some land by Palm Springs and put the Venezuelan army in
[40:31.000 --> 40:37.480]  there we feel about that not too good would we well how can we go around the
[40:37.480 --> 40:44.200]  world and have our bases in 178 foreign countries and yet we're supposed to pay
[40:44.200 --> 40:48.480]  for all this we're not even paying for these wars we're gonna make the very
[40:48.480 --> 40:52.480]  children that fight the wars come back and spend the rest of their lives paying
[40:52.480 --> 40:56.600]  for them also I think that's pretty pathetic that we ought to be ashamed of
[40:56.600 --> 41:01.760]  ourselves well in closing the television show premiered last week to
[41:01.760 --> 41:08.800]  record ratings for true TV the number one new show in their history and part
[41:08.800 --> 41:14.760]  two on 9 11 to Maronite 10 p.m. Eastern 9 p.m. Central in closing Governor
[41:14.760 --> 41:22.160]  Ventura watching you as governor Maverick a true rebel a revolutionary was
[41:22.160 --> 41:26.560]  very refreshing watching the media demonize you and attack you and try to
[41:26.560 --> 41:32.240]  set you up was painful but you were a statesman you left after one term and to
[41:32.240 --> 41:37.880]  see you grow and and just get better and better and more informed and more
[41:37.880 --> 41:43.400]  libertarian more anti-globalist and to now see your TV show be a huge hit I
[41:43.400 --> 41:48.560]  certainly hope it gets picked up for a second season but as you've said many
[41:48.560 --> 41:52.120]  times off air you know you don't know until it's picked up but it certainly
[41:52.120 --> 41:55.800]  should be and everybody needs to do their job to spread the word about the
[41:55.800 --> 42:00.600]  show but we salute your spirit of liberty and as Mark Twain said in the
[42:00.600 --> 42:06.280]  beginning a patriot is a scarce man hated feared and scorned but in the end
[42:06.280 --> 42:14.080]  the timid join him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot and so a lot of
[42:14.080 --> 42:18.240]  timid people are joining the ranks thanks to your leadership Ron Paul's
[42:18.240 --> 42:23.760]  leadership and so many others and a governor have a well-earned extended
[42:23.760 --> 42:31.120]  hiatus in Mexico and surfs up have fun thank you Alex and keep up the good
[42:31.120 --> 42:36.000]  work man I don't know how you do it day in and day out but keep keep talking and
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.800]  keep disrupting the system because it's the American way we'll do it and and I
[42:41.800 --> 42:45.560]  want to between all of us we won't let the country die thanks Alex have a great
[42:45.560 --> 42:50.520]  winter you too take care all right there goes governor Jesse Ventura did I do
[42:50.520 --> 42:54.360]  the mark twain quote right I did it right on CNN in the beginning a patriot is a
[42:54.360 --> 42:59.360]  scarce man hated and feared and scorned but in time the timid join him because
[42:59.360 --> 43:03.960]  then it cost nothing to be a patriot did I did I say it right the first time and
[43:03.960 --> 43:08.760]  time the timid join him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot and Jesse
[43:08.760 --> 43:12.040]  Ventura is the real deal he's not perfect I'm not perfect none of us are
[43:12.040 --> 43:17.960]  perfect but let me tell you I know what's in this production piece I've seen
[43:17.960 --> 43:24.680]  large segments of it and I've because last time I was out in LA a month ago
[43:24.680 --> 43:31.600]  they were still editing it so I haven't seen the finished product and it's
[43:31.600 --> 43:36.800]  powerful I mean this is not Michael Moore banging on doors this is Jesse
[43:36.800 --> 43:41.840]  Ventura doing it and I believe Luke Radowski's in there too we are change
[43:41.840 --> 43:44.800]  I mean it's certainly in the footage I've seen they are I don't know they're
[43:44.800 --> 43:50.800]  gonna be in the finished finished thing that's done and airing tomorrow and who
[43:50.800 --> 43:55.600]  knows what Time Warner's doing with their hands in there but you know the
[43:55.600 --> 44:01.800]  establishment I've had reporters the last few weeks asked me you know why they
[44:01.800 --> 44:04.920]  think this Jesse Ventura show is actually going on air from our
[44:04.920 --> 44:10.560]  perspective and it's really because the establishment has lost all credibility
[44:10.560 --> 44:14.760]  they're losing viewers they know that the general public wants to know about
[44:14.760 --> 44:19.120]  the new world order and I think by putting it on true TV is entertainment
[44:19.120 --> 44:22.920]  they know it'll get ratings and they just think that well the public's already
[44:22.920 --> 44:30.240]  awake the UN's admitting world government why deny this anymore and I
[44:30.240 --> 44:36.000]  think that's what's happening here you know I have been pitched so many
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.880]  television shows I have been asked to fly to New York asked to fly to the LA I
[44:40.880 --> 44:45.120]  have been involved in TV shows I have shot pilots with huge production
[44:45.120 --> 44:54.320]  companies and then seen it not air seen it not air and so when Ventura's people
[44:54.320 --> 44:59.200]  are asking me to be a consultant on this and also be in I'm the only person that
[44:59.200 --> 45:04.240]  appears in multiple episodes four or five they're still they're still editing
[45:04.240 --> 45:10.840]  some of them so coming up in the next two weeks I should you should see episodes
[45:10.840 --> 45:15.080]  I appear in some of them a large part of other parts just a consultant and you see
[45:15.080 --> 45:24.880]  me introducing Jesse to people but it's just good to see it get on air it's like
[45:24.880 --> 45:27.720]  the Wall Street Journal came here was gonna do a cover story on me and I said
[45:27.720 --> 45:31.800]  this will never be printed if this is not a hit piece this will not be printed
[45:31.800 --> 45:35.560]  and I said did you find what you were wanting did you find the dirt you wanted
[45:35.560 --> 45:41.880]  and no not really you know you don't come in here and open a closet door and 45
[45:41.880 --> 45:47.120]  skeletons fall out on the floor things have to be invented about us and it
[45:47.120 --> 45:52.960]  really can't be done because you judge a tree by its fruits I mean how many
[45:52.960 --> 45:58.120]  people have we woken up the New World Order how many times would be an attack
[45:58.120 --> 46:04.120]  by mainstream and alternative media and even government entities a lot that's
[46:04.120 --> 46:07.640]  why I always challenge listeners don't get caught up in the end fighting the
[46:07.640 --> 46:12.400]  co-intel pro the disinformation you know you're good you know you're a patriot
[46:12.400 --> 46:17.800]  you know you're awake and aware and so instead of knitting and spending all your
[46:17.800 --> 46:23.120]  time debating different radio host or filmmakers or patriot leaders chief
[46:23.120 --> 46:27.720]  among them myself spend your time warning people about the carbon tax
[46:27.720 --> 46:32.320]  spend your time warning people about state victim disarmament gun control
[46:32.320 --> 46:36.960]  bills and federal victim disarmament bills and treaty that the gun control
[46:36.960 --> 46:40.960]  treaty with the UN Obama says he's gonna sign next year our blanket open
[46:40.960 --> 46:44.000]  borders and amnesty that will bring in the North American Union and further
[46:44.000 --> 46:49.760]  bankrupt us or forced inoculations and how dangerous the vaccines are
[46:49.760 --> 46:54.560]  warning people about the history of vaccines and the mercury and the cancer
[46:54.560 --> 47:03.560]  viruses we're gonna come back with the winner of the
[47:03.560 --> 47:09.200]  Berlin Film Festival a few years ago this is just par for the course of the
[47:09.200 --> 47:13.600]  type of short films that are shown to little kids teenagers college students
[47:13.600 --> 47:20.000]  the whole cover of YouTube is our future is being decided that Copenhagen almost
[47:20.000 --> 47:28.520]  every video on the front page is pro global government pro tax links I want
[47:28.520 --> 47:31.600]  to launch an initiative today I got Texas Monthly here interviewing me for
[47:31.600 --> 47:38.800]  what they say is probably gonna maybe a cover story but I'm gonna try to do
[47:38.800 --> 47:46.960]  several YouTube videos today today that I really about Copenhagen and all the
[47:46.960 --> 47:53.880]  fraud that's come out there in the latest on climategate but I also want to do
[47:53.880 --> 47:57.920]  one calling for people in the next week and a half while Copenhagen is going on
[47:57.920 --> 48:01.080]  the establishment of world government they're calling it the most important
[48:01.080 --> 48:05.080]  meeting in history the declaration of world government I'm calling on
[48:05.080 --> 48:08.440]  everybody to make their own YouTube videos everyone I don't care if you're
[48:08.440 --> 48:13.880]  not eloquent or if you are eloquent or if you're mediocre just get up there
[48:13.880 --> 48:19.440]  point out issues we need thousands of videos flooding YouTube YouTube has more
[48:19.440 --> 48:23.960]  video views than all other video sites combined sure it's controlled sure it's
[48:23.960 --> 48:29.720]  manipulated sure it's bad many respects but it's where the fight is with a
[48:29.720 --> 48:34.280]  Schmidt character that owns it pushing world government and promoting tyranny
[48:34.280 --> 48:39.480]  we need to take YouTube over and counter their propaganda and make videos
[48:39.480 --> 48:44.040]  about how they're engaged in a bunch of propaganda because they're whining and
[48:44.040 --> 48:48.920]  screaming and yelling all the controlled corporate press and the Fortune 500
[48:48.920 --> 48:53.880]  they're all redoubling I mean I've been watching the news and I can't believe
[48:53.880 --> 49:00.120]  how mindless and base and ridiculously off the chart if I was gonna make a
[49:00.120 --> 49:07.520]  science fiction movie about a science fiction dark satire movie about the
[49:07.520 --> 49:13.480]  ultimate propaganda state I would just go point cameras at Copenhagen and show
[49:13.480 --> 49:16.920]  that in the movie I mean they got giant billboards with little girls saying
[49:16.920 --> 49:21.600]  please I don't want to drown and images of polar bears saying they're all dying
[49:21.600 --> 49:30.320]  they're almost extinct when they've gone from 10,000 in the arctic areas to over
[49:30.320 --> 49:38.880]  45,000 their numbers are exploding like cockroaches and they're showing films at
[49:38.880 --> 49:43.280]  Copenhagen that tell school children they're all gonna die I mean this is
[49:43.280 --> 49:50.440]  ridiculous this is ridiculous and this video coming up shows humans as a
[49:50.440 --> 49:58.880]  disease spreading across the globe and then blasting off in rocket ships to
[49:58.880 --> 50:05.920]  infest the galaxy as a disease no we're not a disease Jesse Ventura is not a
[50:05.920 --> 50:11.400]  disease Ron Paul is not a disease Martin Luther King is not a disease Leonardo
[50:11.400 --> 50:15.760]  da Vinci is not a disease we are an incredible species who can produce
[50:15.760 --> 50:22.200]  amazing art and passion and love and honor and creativity and ideas and the
[50:22.200 --> 50:26.280]  globalists know that and they want to have a control over society and control
[50:26.280 --> 50:30.680]  over information to dumb us down so they can control future so they can
[50:30.680 --> 50:35.000]  control the destiny of humanity we have to rest control over the future of
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.480]  humanity from these people and let humanity really make the decision what
[50:39.480 --> 50:44.280]  we want to do from there that's why I don't like football and and and petty
[50:44.280 --> 50:48.320]  stuff because it's issues of no significance that don't matter as we're
[50:48.320 --> 50:53.120]  on this planet hurtling through intergalactic space that's what really
[50:53.120 --> 50:59.440]  matters and awaken you don't have to agree with me just awaken wake up wake
[50:59.440 --> 51:02.800]  up there's more to the world you have a mortgage and a load of other debt
[51:02.800 --> 51:06.320]  wouldn't it be great if it all just went away no more mortgage can change your
[51:06.320 --> 51:09.880]  life we paid off all of our bills all your debt including your mortgage in as
[51:09.880 --> 51:14.000]  little as nine years with no more mortgage we will have saved over three
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.280]  hundred and thirteen thousand dollars in interest payments even have more money
[51:17.280 --> 51:21.120]  left over each month it lowered our monthly payments by a little over five

[1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:42.920]  he's very angry a lot of supporters well-meaning supporters of this fraud

[1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:55.680]  Moncton in his incredible climate gate caught green-handed report that's up on

[1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:07.200]  us graciously for the rest of the hour to report on day one and two of the
[1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:10.840]  global government takeover summit the UN's calling it the most important
[1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:14.520]  summit in history YouTube says our future is being decided in Copenhagen
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:18.880]  they're pushing it Lord Christopher Moncton third Viscount of Moncton and
[1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:24.160]  Brinchley has worked at all levels of government has been a top journalist has
[1:01:24.160 --> 1:01:29.200]  a scientific organization advising governments and corporations was one of
[1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:33.520]  the chief advisors to Margaret Thatcher the list goes on and on he really needs
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:37.880]  no introduction but Lord Moncton we got a break in three minutes we'll come back
[1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:42.800]  with plenty of time to break this down but first off the climate gate blew up
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:46.960]  even bigger than I thought it would it is collapsing you are now there at the
[1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:54.040]  center of these crooks trying to declare their global hegemon tell us what's
[1:01:54.040 --> 1:01:58.280]  happening in Copenhagen well it's almost as though climate gate hadn't
[1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:03.280]  happened to be honest the vast majority of the world's mainstream media have
[1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:07.400]  still not really said what in the climate gate emails they may have
[1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:11.600]  mentioned it once or twice as the BBC have not given it anything like the
[1:02:11.600 --> 1:02:16.320]  coverage it deserves given the magnitude of the draft treaty which is
[1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:21.880]  under consideration here when I went into the conference yesterday to ask for a
[1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:25.880]  copy of the treaty I went to the UN documentation and said right I want the
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:31.480]  current draft of the negotiating text and they looked at me as though they
[1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:36.080]  were baffled you know the librarian there who had stacks of papers behind her
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:40.280]  in various languages she just looked as though she'd never heard of it so I
[1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:43.960]  insisted and it took about 10 minutes and they consulted each other over three
[1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:48.400]  or four of them arguing over it none of them would produce the document so I
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:52.440]  then did a quick interview with a passing TV camera and came back and I said
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:56.040]  look I know this treaty exists because this is what the conference is all
[1:02:56.040 --> 1:03:01.520]  about it's discarding a treaty draft and they said oh no we've got no such thing
[1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:06.480]  and I said well you have and I want it and I'm not going to be put off and if I
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:10.160]  am put off there will be an international diplomatic incident and only then
[1:03:10.160 --> 1:03:14.600]  did they produce a stack of papers two inches thick a thousand pages most of
[1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:19.520]  which was just a complete element but right at the bottom of the stack when I
[1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:25.560]  plowed my way through it I found hit the draft or the current draft of the
[1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:30.200]  treaty and once again they are desperately trying to conceal from
[1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:35.080]  everybody here the magnitude of what they're attempting to do they really are
[1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:39.840]  aiming to set up a world government they no longer use the word government in
[1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:44.040]  the treaty I think we've frightened them off that but all the institutions of
[1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:47.520]  this world government and the enormous powers it's going to be given over free
[1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:53.200]  markets to tax the American economy to the extent of two percent of GDP to
[1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:57.720]  impose a further tax of two percent on every financial transaction that could
[1:03:57.720 --> 1:04:04.360]  come to a very large GDP overall and to close down effectively the West transfer
[1:04:04.360 --> 1:04:08.400]  your jobs you're listening to this to third world countries all of that is
[1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:13.800]  still in the treaty draft even after all negotiating rounds even after that we've
[1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:21.560]  all made to try to make them rethink and even after climate change well this is
[1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:25.920]  just devastating information so this this appears to be breaking news
[1:04:25.920 --> 1:04:33.000]  because I've been doing searches every hour for the latest draft text and the
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:37.600]  media was saying it wasn't released there was this Danish text dealing with
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:43.120]  the way the taxes would be implemented we'll find out if that's the same text
[1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:47.920]  you have that's up on the London Guardian website right now but this is
[1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:52.920]  massive breaking news they're also reporting taxes on all air travel
[1:04:52.920 --> 1:04:58.720]  globally taxes on all fuel globally just a complete takeover but this
[1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:02.680]  financial tax wow this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Acola blue

[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:16.120]  we have the fraudulent climategate emails from the head UN affiliated
[1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:22.600]  climate center in East Anglia we have the fake hockey stick the lies about the
[1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:26.920]  Arctic completely melting the lies about polar bears and penguins can't swim
[1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:32.880]  I'm seeing billboards all over Copenhagen saying save the polar bears
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:36.800]  they're going to die complete fraud big billboards of little girls saying
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:43.000]  please don't let me drown the most base mindless fraudulent information
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:49.440]  Holdren saying 13-foot sea levels when the UN themselves says what 7 to 21
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:56.240]  inches and then that itself based on a fraud we have now Lord Christopher
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:09:00.720]  Monkton because he is a member of the House of Lords went in and demanded the
[1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:05.000]  latest treaty this is breaking news it has everything that was in the previous
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:09.480]  one and worse you're gonna hear this now breaking we have the Danish text leaked
[1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:13.200]  of the architecture of this global government how private corporate
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:19.200]  interest IMF World Bank will run the system not even the UN so just that's
[1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:23.200]  got the third world now reeling threatening to back out the Saudis
[1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:27.000]  are calling for investigations so much is happening I'm gonna attempt to go
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:31.360]  over all of this in the next 51 minutes with Lord Christopher Monkton again
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:35.920]  graciously joining us so I'm gonna try to just sit back sir and let you
[1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:41.560]  chronicle you're there at Copenhagen but also the good news UN climate chief
[1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:46.160]  does say hacked emails are damaging but as you said they're like the cat caught
[1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:49.480]  with the canary in its mouth going on about its business like it's no big
[1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:54.720]  deal they're trying very very hard to pretend that climate gate
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:59.040]  people who've come to the conference don't really know if it happened because
[1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:02.960]  most of the mainstream media have still really not said what's in these emails
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:07.080]  and what is happening is that the mainstream media have done themselves
[1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:11.680]  terrible damage by signing up to this climate nonsense and then by thoroughly
[1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:16.120]  refusing to admit that climate gate that happening admit how serious it was and
[1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:21.400]  simply inform their readers of what was actually in the emails and missions but
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:25.400]  while they're telling us as the Met Office did just today but today is the
[1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:30.360]  warmest decade since records began 150 years ago privately what they're
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:34.080]  saying in the emails the climate gate emails is hey look we've got a temperature
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:38.120]  which in fact has been falling and we can't explain why and it's a
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:41.560]  travesty that we can't explain why so they're saying one thing to a public
[1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:46.200]  it to maintain the scare making them rich and that's what's called fraud it's
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:50.440]  criminal fraud and on the other hand they're saying privately oh dear oh dear
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:54.120]  we can't account for the fact there's been no warming for the last 15 years when
[1:10:54.120 --> 1:10:59.160]  that is it's very serious this disconnect between what they're saying among the
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:04.720]  held privately and what they're admitting to us publicly
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:13.480]  absolutely us talking about criminal investigations Lord Moncton we have
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:17.080]  Senator Inhofe calling for it the Saudis calling for investigations and the
[1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:20.640]  Saudis have pointed out the United Nations the progenitor of this fraud
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:25.680]  they can't run the investigation no they can't because the United Nations is
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:30.120]  thoroughly compromised all this because the climate panel that it created via
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:34.040]  the United Nations environment program and the World Health Organization
[1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:37.520]  namely this intergovernmental panel on climate change which has produced four
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:43.280]  major reports on the climate those four major reports are now all under a cloud
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:48.840]  because all the major contributors to those reports the lead authors indeed
[1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:55.600]  the the lead author of the entire science report of 2007 are part of these
[1:11:55.600 --> 1:12:00.200]  emails part of this conspiracy to conceal manipulate tamper with invent
[1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:05.480]  make up and eventually destroy data when it was requested by third party
[1:12:05.480 --> 1:12:09.280]  scientists who wanted to check whether the various extraordinary claims they
[1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:13.400]  were making could possibly be true it's a very very serious matter and there's no
[1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:17.320]  way the UN can be allowed to do this I think this has got to go to district
[1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:21.080]  attorneys in the United States and it's got to go to the police and the Crown
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:24.440]  Prosecution Service in the United Kingdom it's already gone to the
[1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:28.720]  Information Commissioner because there are plainly plain admission in emails
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:33.200]  there over the years that they have been planning to avoid disclosing
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:37.120]  information to other scientists which is contrary to the scientific method as
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:41.720]  well as contrary to UK freedom of information law but the final seal on
[1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:45.400]  that freedom of information thing is the email in which one of the people
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:48.840]  concerned wrote to all the other said you must destroy all your emails related
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:54.040]  to our participation in the fourth assessment report of the United Nations
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:59.400]  Climate Panel in 2007 because we're being asked for it by another scientist
[1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:03.880]  under the Freedom of Information Act so you must destroy it that email clearly
[1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:08.680]  constitutes a serious criminal offense for which the highest possible level of
[1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:13.560]  financial penalty is allowed for by the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:16.880]  person who wrote that email who my wife's name on the air because it's not
[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:21.760]  fair to him he is now going to face criminal charges he is I think going to
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:26.880]  be indicted convicted and he won't be imprisoned because we don't imprison
[1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:29.960]  people yet for these offenses I think the law is going to have to change in the
[1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:35.280]  life but he will set the objective as will his institution to a very large
[1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:39.920]  financial penalty indeed and quite rightly so well you're a member of the
[1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:43.680]  House of Lords the upper chamber of your parliament for those that don't know
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:48.760]  Lord Christopher Moncton are you saying that the inside information that you're
[1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:53.360]  getting from government is that he will be prosecuted no because the the
[1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:58.800]  government would would be most improper if it were to involve itself any way in
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:02.400]  whether or not to prosecute somebody that is a function entirely of the
[1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:06.520]  director of public prosecutions who is a an official who has to be independent
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:10.840]  government and also I myself although a member of the House of Lords do not have
[1:14:10.840 --> 1:14:14.360]  the right to sit or vote that taken away no no I understand that I'm saying
[1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:19.880]  yeah but I'm saying you're you're saying you believe he will be charged or your
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:24.440]  I think it is I think it is certain that you'll be charged I myself together with
[1:14:24.440 --> 1:14:28.560]  Professor Fred Stinger who founded the US satellite weather service many years
[1:14:28.560 --> 1:14:33.680]  ago have written an official complaint to the information commissioner asking
[1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:37.680]  him to look into this as has one of the people who had made a freedom of
[1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:42.360]  request now the person who made that information request has been answered we
[1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:46.520]  have not yet been answered and if I don't get an answer in the next few days
[1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:50.200]  and as soon as I get back from this Copenhagen conference I will be arranging
[1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:53.200]  for questions to be put down in the House of Lords about why the information
[1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:56.440]  commissioner is doing his job and replying to his correspondence so you're
[1:14:56.440 --> 1:15:00.440]  going to demand you're going to demand justice and you and others have filed
[1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:05.320]  former complaints formal complaints and we have them red-handed talking to the
[1:15:05.320 --> 1:15:10.080]  government colluding to keep the public from getting information that should be
[1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:14.560]  public I mean that certainly is a conspiracy to engage in a cover-up
[1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:20.160]  it's worse than that it's it's also against every rule of science because
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:26.480]  the only way science can work is if people who publish results on which the
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:32.200]  largest tax increase of the largest abandonment of freedom ever can see is
[1:15:32.200 --> 1:15:36.800]  about to be negotiated here at Copenhagen they have not been sharing
[1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:41.000]  their results and their computer programs and their data with other
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  scientists so that those other scientists can check them all of this has
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:50.160]  been done behind closed doors so that they could get away with what turns out
[1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:55.720]  to be not just an information offense but also a very serious scientific and
[1:15:55.720 --> 1:16:03.920]  financial criminal fraud for which a very long sentence in prison is the
[1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:09.680]  appropriate remedy and what I have had is requests from two immensely senior
[1:16:09.680 --> 1:16:15.360]  professors one in the United States and one in Canada but I should draft for
[1:16:15.360 --> 1:16:19.080]  their complaints to the British police because they don't know how we do it
[1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:22.160]  yet they want me to just do that for them they will make sure that I've got
[1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:25.840]  all the facts correct they've both sent me a large amount of information about
[1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:29.720]  the fact in their case because they're named in these emails in the most
[1:16:29.720 --> 1:16:35.680]  uncomplementary way and it's very clear that a plot to devalue their
[1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:42.960]  scientific research by unfair and foul and dishonest me had been engaged by
[1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:47.880]  the conspirators who have been talking to each other in these emails so I will
[1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:52.400]  be going to see the police superintendent in the East Anglia
[1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:56.000]  Constabulary who is heading up the investigation into who the whistleblower
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:00.120]  is whether he should be prosecuted I can tell you from now he won't be prosecuted
[1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:04.080]  because we have legislation which allows whistleblower to bring criminal
[1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:07.280]  offense to the attention of the public in this way without suffering any
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:12.600]  penalty themselves so the whistleblower will not be prosecuted however I will be
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:17.760]  saying to the police officer that there is clear and systematic evidence of
[1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:24.080]  deliberate wide-scale fraud right across the meteorological community in
[1:17:24.080 --> 1:17:29.640]  NASA in NOAA in the University of East Anglia in Penn State University in
[1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:34.920]  universities and institutions of learning right across the world where a
[1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:39.760]  small coterie of malevolent scientists and when they come across a very nasty
[1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:42.560]  people in the way they write about everybody else that disagrees with them
[1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:47.160]  they're very nasty people they're highly politically motivated and they're very
[1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:52.840]  bad and incompetent scientists and also very vicious to anyone who dares to
[1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:58.440]  disagree and this unpleasantness is the first thing that strikes anyone who reads
[1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:03.520]  but of course I'm forced to be here at most at Copenhagen most of the people
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:07.840]  basically can't read at all as far as I could see so the idea that they would
[1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:12.120]  read these emails is is I'm thinking about well yes sir the propaganda looks
[1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:16.680]  like it's the propaganda looks like it's directed at three-year-olds pictures of
[1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:21.400]  children saying please don't let me drown but isn't it important to get these
[1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:26.720]  charges rolling while Copenhagen's going on because that will really blow up in
[1:18:26.720 --> 1:18:30.200]  the establishment space and that's why they're panicking because they know
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:34.040]  they've been engaging in all this crime earlier last week I'm sure you're aware
[1:18:34.040 --> 1:18:38.560]  of this you're always a few steps ahead of us or more or several leagues ahead
[1:18:38.560 --> 1:18:44.400]  of us it's now coming out that the UN had documents AP and Fox reported it
[1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:50.040]  where they were recruiting and directing scientists in this fraud and in this
[1:18:50.040 --> 1:18:54.440]  artificial consensus from behind the scenes so we have the United Nations
[1:18:54.440 --> 1:19:00.720]  directly in there as you know really the king rat orchestrating this of course
[1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:04.820]  there's been a lot of evidence this one of the people who is very prominently
[1:19:04.820 --> 1:19:10.400]  named in the emails indeed one of the people exchanging is the person who the
[1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:17.320]  UN called in to rewrite the 1995 second major climate assessment before they do
[1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:21.760]  these every five years you and really big reports of this is the sort of what
[1:19:21.760 --> 1:19:26.200]  the bedwetters based their case on they will the UN says this now UN said in
[1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:30.680]  1995 report this was what the scientists around a thousand of them had
[1:19:30.680 --> 1:19:36.680]  signed off on what they said was there is no huge detectable human influence on
[1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:41.760]  global temperature we can't find any we don't know when we will find where not
[1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:46.040]  there is any such thing now they said that five times a little comes one man
[1:19:46.040 --> 1:19:51.320]  at the request of the U.S. is how we know this this has the U.S. in the middle of this
[1:19:51.320 --> 1:19:56.000]  at the request of the U.S. we've got a break wrote the report we've got a break
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:01.400]  we're gonna come back with this key information straight ahead when you

[1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:15.440]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home turn members
[1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:20.480]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:25.840]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:30.760]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:35.160]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:11.960]  I was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride
[1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:23.840]  sword and pistol by my side the explosive knowledge that Lord Moncton has is
[1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:27.680]  amazing and you know I don't get guessed up here and kiss up to them when I
[1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:32.840]  read his reports his essays when I look at his documentation when I see him
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:37.600]  speak on television or radio the way he lays it out is so amazing because it's
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:42.920]  such a huge subject and today he's going right at the fraud and he was
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:46.480]  finishing up with the fraud and the criminal investigations and how it's
[1:24:46.480 --> 1:24:51.080]  premeditated fraud to establish a collectivist world government controlled
[1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:54.360]  by large financial interests that literally are setting themselves up as
[1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:58.080]  emperors of the planet and you were finishing up sir but the time we've got
[1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:04.120]  I then want to get into the fact that you went and demanded and bent the will
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:11.080]  of these of these Copenhagen UN bureaucrats to cough up the latest secret
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:17.640]  version of the treaty with taxes on money financial transfers I mean this is
[1:25:17.640 --> 1:25:22.160]  off the charts then we've I want to get your take on the propaganda on the
[1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:26.480]  ground there I want to get your take on what all the scientists are out there
[1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:30.920]  talking about how many people will die and starve to death if even a small of
[1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:36.280]  the amount of this is implemented what the biofuels has already done I mean
[1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:42.200]  this is so monstrous please continue right where would you like me to start
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:46.200]  you got it well you got cut off by the break you got cut off by the break
[1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:49.880]  getting into the fraud but I want to just saying that I have these two eminent
[1:25:49.880 --> 1:25:53.920]  professors who've asked me to put a case to the police and as soon as I get back
[1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:57.240]  from this conference I will be going to see the senior police officer the police
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:26:01.120]  superintendent in the East Anglican Sanctuary investigating this matter I
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:05.640]  will be laying their reports for him I will be asking for a two-hour briefing
[1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:10.320]  so that I can brief him on the background to this fraud because you know if
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:13.840]  you're a police officer you're not a climatologist and somebody comes in and
[1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:17.200]  says look these people are lying and they're making up data you'd never just
[1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:20.560]  believe it you need to be properly briefed I'm hoping they're going to let
[1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:25.680]  me brief them on this so that they can understand just how monstrous is the
[1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:31.200]  manufacturing of data let's just take for instance the EPA's decision to try and
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:36.600]  say that carbon dioxide is an endangerment to the to human health
[1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:41.920]  under the clean air and it's being announced it's being announced to
[1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:46.200]  coincide with Copenhagen absolutely of course it was a matter to coincide with
[1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:52.080]  Copenhagen and this is clear politicking again of the worst kind but the
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:57.800]  technical document on which that is based contains a graph lifted the UN
[1:26:57.800 --> 1:27:03.880]  document and not checked which pretends to suggest that the rate at which global
[1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:08.680]  warming is happening has been accelerating over the last hundred and
[1:27:08.680 --> 1:27:13.160]  fifty years and particularly in recent years the last thirty five years now that
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:18.840]  graph is based on a well-known scientific fraud it's a statistical fraud in
[1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:24.560]  fact called the end point fallacy where you take a stochastic data set that's
[1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:27.160]  one way you have to guess which way it's going to jump next temperature
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:31.160]  record like that you know it doesn't follow an ordered curve it jiggles up
[1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:37.040]  and down a lot and stochastic data sets like that are highly said to precisely
[1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:42.400]  the point at which you start and end your trend line and the UN has used this
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:49.080]  fact to try to convey an entirely false entirely bogus and fraudulent impression
[1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:53.960]  which has been recited over and over again by ignorant politicians that the
[1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:59.000]  rate of warming is at itself accelerating and the EPA instead of
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:05.320]  checking independently as I wrote and told it to do instead just lifted this
[1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:11.080]  material out of the UN as we now know or elitist documents without bothering to
[1:28:11.080 --> 1:28:16.960]  check it and guess who was the lead author of the part of the UN document
[1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:22.400]  which produced this bogus graph it was none other than one of the conspirators
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:27.520]  in the climate-gate scandal so we can tie all these people together in a series
[1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:33.360]  of frauds that now links in the EPA itself and because the director of the
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:38.800]  EPA did not respond she didn't even answer the submissions that I and many
[1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:44.960]  others put in she herself is now going to be invited for fraud because she's
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:49.880]  made herself part of the fraud by being warned that she was relying on
[1:28:49.880 --> 1:28:53.560]  documents that were themselves fraudulent such as this graph which is
[1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:57.720]  plainly fraudulent and we know she used it because it's in the technical
[1:28:57.720 --> 1:29:02.560]  document that she published and instead of withdrawing that putting in a
[1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:06.080]  supplementary document saying that we still believe we're right but we can't
[1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:10.400]  rely on that graph anymore she has done nothing about it she has therefore
[1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:16.240]  become part of a very serious international scientific and financial
[1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:22.400]  fraud and she will have to go and go to jail amazing Lord Moncton is this not
[1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:27.520]  as many researchers and scientists are billing it the greatest scientific
[1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:31.960]  fraud of history I mean they're going for total world government a takeover of
[1:29:31.960 --> 1:29:37.800]  the entire economy total control of society it's a fraud by design they
[1:29:37.800 --> 1:29:42.040]  weren't mistaken they knew it was a fraud answer that question on the other
[1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:45.800]  side of this quick break and then we're going to go over the treaty over what's
[1:29:45.800 --> 1:29:49.440]  happening in Copenhagen he is there and we're going to give you his official
[1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:57.000]  website we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:02.960]  radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[1:30:02.960 --> 1:30:07.240]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[1:30:07.240 --> 1:30:11.400]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[1:30:11.400 --> 1:30:15.320]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[1:30:15.320 --> 1:30:18.960]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:23.520]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:28.160]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:31.920]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:35.400]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:30:35.400 --> 1:30:39.320]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:30:39.320 --> 1:30:42.480]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:27.360]  joins us from Copenhagen Denmark an extreme demand there obviously we're
[1:33:27.360 --> 1:33:34.360]  very fortunate to have him with us here today and Lord Monkton again there's so
[1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:40.000]  many subjects to talk about I want to get into the leaked treaty that he will
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:43.720]  that you went and demanded we're able to get the latest leaked information with
[1:33:43.720 --> 1:33:47.560]  the Danish text that has the third world figuring out they're being bamboozled
[1:33:47.560 --> 1:33:52.480]  and defrauded by this gaggle of scam artist I also wanted to talk to you
[1:33:52.480 --> 1:33:58.080]  about your ideas for the troops out there to not you know get orders from
[1:33:58.080 --> 1:34:02.560]  headquarters but to go to the sound of the guns what we can do globally to
[1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:06.240]  expose and fight this fraud now that we're beginning to route them what
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:10.440]  about civil suits you have all these scientists that were persecuted that had
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:14.160]  their papers blocked you have these scientific journals that were
[1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:19.360]  intimidated that right there is a serious civil matter trying to destroy
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:24.840]  people's careers couldn't civil suits by parties defrauded or taxpayers around
[1:34:24.840 --> 1:34:29.280]  the world being defrauded by this lie isn't everyone in the world a plaintiff
[1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:34.440]  to sue the United Nations to sue East Anglia to sue the EPA to sue Goddard
[1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:40.360]  climate center I mean your take on that Lord Monkton right I think that of
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:46.200]  course anyone has the right to but what you need to do is be very careful to use
[1:34:46.200 --> 1:34:49.800]  the proper procedure that the first thing is that we're dealing here with a
[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:55.240]  criminal rather than a civil matter these people have committed crime serious
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:34:59.640]  imprisonable offenses we would you would call the felonies rather than
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:03.200]  misdemeanor there these are crimes which you can go to prison and should go to
[1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:07.400]  prison if you commit them for a very very long time particularly in view of the
[1:35:07.400 --> 1:35:11.640]  effects that these crimes are already having on poor people around the world
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:16.760]  who are being killed in large numbers by starvation as a result of policy of
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:20.000]  Western nations including the United States take in the case of the United
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:24.400]  States one third of its agricultural land out from growing food for people who
[1:35:24.400 --> 1:35:29.400]  need it and into growing totally unnecessary biofuels for clunkers that
[1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:33.480]  don't result a doubling of world food prices in the last two years result
[1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:39.120]  starvation take Haiti where they live on mud pie made with real mud costing
[1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:43.320]  three cents each pinch of butter pinch of salt you take the mud you mash it all
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:46.160]  up lay it out in the sun strives six thousand tell it to your neighbor for
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:50.960]  three cents that's what they're living on or rather dying on in Haiti now I was
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:54.760]  telling this story last year to a conference of government and opposition
[1:35:54.760 --> 1:35:58.840]  representatives in Madrid and a lady in the front row burst tears and I said I'm
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:02.560]  sorry to have offended you but it is a rather terrible thing with that I've just
[1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:07.040]  come back from Haiti now because of the doubling of world food prices they can't
[1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:11.800]  even afford the price of a mud pie and they're dying of starvation all over the
[1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:15.840]  face and she was heartbroken it's the reason I'm crying is that you're the
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:20.320]  first person in the Western world I've ever heard mentioning the plight of the
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:26.120]  poor and I'm so grateful I just can't tell you how serious this is these
[1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:30.520]  people by their scientific fraud and the financial fraud they're profiting
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:35.760]  enormously one of the documents from this this series of leaked documents is
[1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:40.120]  the complete financial account of the of the climate research unit how much
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:44.280]  grants they've had and how vast with them the amount of grants have increased
[1:36:44.280 --> 1:36:47.800]  since they began peddling the scientific and they're working with oil
[1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:53.480]  companies while people die of starvation in a dozen reasons of the world and the
[1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:58.560]  there are food riots in those reasons to hardly ever reported in any major Western
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:04.080]  news medium it is a scandal of the worst proportion our own fellow preachers are
[1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:09.920]  being killed by starvation because these people have lied and made up the
[1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:14.080]  science and hidden it so that nobody else could check sir doesn't get worse
[1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:17.880]  than that going back to the question I forgot to repose at the start of the
[1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:23.280]  break is this the greatest scientific fraud in history a and then B we also
[1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:28.160]  now have in the emails where they're meeting with Dutch Royal Shell with BP
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:34.880]  with Siemens and others saying oh they're part of our agenda this is only part of
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:39.560]  our takeover this is so wonderful can you speak to this if is this the biggest
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:45.640]  fraud scientific fraud in history a and B the collusion of Fortune 100 companies
[1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:51.000]  in the scam right let's start with that first question it follows from my last
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:57.800]  answer but a fraud on an international scale which has already killed millions
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:02.280]  by starvation is the worst fraud you could ever possibly commit with our
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:07.640]  fellow human being are dying in large numbers because of this fraud it doesn't
[1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:12.720]  get worse and then we come on to your second question just remind me of what
[1:38:12.720 --> 1:38:19.120]  that was the oil companies and and other major corporations feverishly working
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:24.960]  with the climate scammers that's right this is because they've become so
[1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:31.520]  frightened of the united front that the world's governing class has put up saying
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:34.600]  we are going to pedal with climate nonsense regardless of whether it's
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:40.080]  true but they've decided I think cravenly and I've told many of them so that if
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:43.880]  that they better just give in and belong with it and try and make as much money as
[1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:47.640]  they can out of it I think it's disgraceful I think their shareholder
[1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:51.520]  there there is a case for civil suit shareholder the companies who have done
[1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:55.920]  deals of this kind with the frauds of the UN and among the politicians and
[1:38:55.920 --> 1:39:00.760]  among scientists they do deserve to be sued by their shareholders for not
[1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:03.760]  protecting the best interests of shareholders as every director of a
[1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:09.180]  major corporation is required by law to do so I think that is indeed a
[1:39:09.180 --> 1:39:14.160]  disgrace but what I'd like to do if I may turn to what is it this draft
[1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:19.000]  treaty yes yes amount of money that they want to take from and so let me stop you
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:22.440]  let me stop you briefly for those that don't know and I've been searching every
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:27.000]  hour and checking during the breaks you are the only person and you first several
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:31.840]  months ago ferreted out the secret draft perhaps you can remind us how you were
[1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:37.040]  able to get that and then a friend of mine called Willie Sue at the Harvard
[1:39:37.040 --> 1:39:40.840]  Smithsonian Institute for Astrophysics who reads everything
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:46.200]  even that which is produced by the forces of darkness in this matter and he
[1:39:46.200 --> 1:39:50.800]  got on to the you have a obscurity when website the website of the framework
[1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:56.240]  convention on climate change conference of the party and he found what said it
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:01.040]  was a note by the secretary at but he noticed it was a much too large file
[1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:05.640]  just to be a note so he looked at the file and it was a two-page note but
[1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:11.320]  attached to it with 186 pages and that was the first draft of the tree okay
[1:40:11.320 --> 1:40:15.360]  okay let me stop you there because I thought the file did not say treaty of
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:19.000]  Copenhagen there was nothing to indicate what this was and had he not been
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:22.720]  diligent in reading everything spotting the size of the file neither he nor
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:26.200]  anybody would ever have found it and they would have been able to say if we had
[1:40:26.200 --> 1:40:30.600]  subsequently said oh well we had no idea that what the government signed up to
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:35.120]  in Copenhagen may call this the UN would have smoothed it said but it's been on our
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:41.560]  website all the time okay how they play these okay now that said again recap this
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:46.480]  is breaking here on air you have the latest version you're going to go over
[1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:51.880]  what's in it for everybody right now this is breaking information right now
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:56.440]  Lord Montyn you have the floor now what I'm going to do is to give you just that
[1:40:56.440 --> 1:41:01.320]  bit of the treaty which talks of part of the financial arrangement I have never
[1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:06.080]  seen a treat as expensive as this one for the west it's only the west that's
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:10.320]  going to pay all the third world countries have been bought so they will
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:13.040]  sign this treaty because they think they're going to get money out of it but
[1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:18.120]  it's going to cost the west a fortune here's what it says developed country
[1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:23.800]  party that's what they call countries like the United States are going to
[1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:31.120]  have to pay a tax of anything up to 2% of gross national product to give you an
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:36.080]  idea of how big that is that's half the best defense budget that's how much
[1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:41.480]  they are going to confiscate to fund this vast new government that they're
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:45.920]  setting up I haven't yet counted how many interlocked new bureaucracy there
[1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:50.160]  are to constitute this government but I think it's around 700 I'm going to try
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:55.480]  and do a more exact count later then they're going to be levied on their
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:42:01.520]  greenhouse gas emissions they're going to auction allowances to emit greenhouse
[1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:05.120]  gases if you don't buy an allowance to emit greenhouse gases you won't be
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:08.400]  allowed to admit them you could find that your local electricity company has
[1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:13.880]  to shut down because it can't afford to buy the right to emit this harmless gas
[1:42:13.880 --> 1:42:20.960]  into the atmosphere but also going to be a uniform global levy of two dollars
[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:27.800]  per tonne of CO2 for all fossil fuel emissions so that is really enormous
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:31.160]  they're going to be levies on emissions from international aviation
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:35.880]  specifically an international air passenger adaptation levy stroke green
[1:42:35.880 --> 1:42:41.360]  levy on every airfare except on journeys that go in or out of poorer
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:49.040]  countries of course there's going to be a 2% share of the proceeds on various
[1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:53.800]  kinds of UN goggles towards giving money to third world countries they're
[1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:57.480]  going to tax the money they're going to hand out there's also going to be a
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:43:03.680]  global levy on international monetary transactions that means every transfer of
[1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:08.040]  money across borders will be taxed they no longer say as they did in the
[1:43:08.040 --> 1:43:13.040]  original draft what rate that tax was at but they did mine 2% that's on top of
[1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:17.920]  the 2% tax of GDP that they're going to charge anyway there's also going to be
[1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:23.520]  get this penalties all fine for non-compliance of developed country
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:28.720]  parties at the United States etc with their emission reduction and financial
[1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:33.240]  resources commitment that means if you don't cut your economy down to size
[1:43:33.240 --> 1:43:38.360]  and cut your carbon emissions or if you don't pay the vast amounts of money that
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:42.240]  I've just read out for these various categories which admittedly some of them
[1:43:42.240 --> 1:43:46.280]  are listed as options but nevertheless we're looking at very very serious
[1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:52.680]  amounts of money then there will be a police force effectively this government
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:57.440]  will have the right for the first time ever in an international organization to
[1:43:57.440 --> 1:44:03.920]  enforce its will by imposing unlimited financial penalties on any countries
[1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:09.400]  whose performance under this treaty they don't like now I could go on and on and
[1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:13.800]  on and on because there's pages and pages there's an adaptation from the
[1:44:13.800 --> 1:44:17.680]  multilateral adaptation from solidarity from mitigation from multilateral
[1:44:17.680 --> 1:44:23.160]  climate technology a total government takeover a global government sir what
[1:44:23.160 --> 1:44:28.000]  is this total global government this is total global government but on a scale
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:33.680]  which is simply unimaginable I mean the cost of all these extra boards and
[1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:38.160]  panels and technology funds that's going to come out of general taxpayers
[1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:42.760]  money over and above the various individual financial provisions I've
[1:44:42.760 --> 1:44:48.520]  just read out we're looking at a grab for absolute power and absolute financial
[1:44:48.520 --> 1:44:54.280]  control worldwide by the UN and its associated bureaucracies and 700 new
[1:44:54.280 --> 1:44:59.600]  bureaucracies I don't know about 700 new bureaucrats about 700 new bureaucratic
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:03.520]  bodies who says how many hundreds of thousands of staff each of those will
[1:45:03.520 --> 1:45:08.120]  have briefly need an awful lot of our money to pay for all that and this is how
[1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:12.160]  they're going to get it a series of funds and this and that and the other I've
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:16.760]  never seen anything I'm global authorities over travel tracking where
[1:45:16.760 --> 1:45:24.120]  everybody goes expanding on that now we have the Danish leaked memo that they've
[1:45:24.120 --> 1:45:29.480]  been passing around and I have that draft here and it talks about this is
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:32.840]  even upsetting the some of the UN bureaucrats in the third world countries
[1:45:32.840 --> 1:45:38.360]  that the power will be held by the IMF the World Bank and other quasi private
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:43.880]  organizations so we have a private corporate structure directly looting the
[1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:50.440]  population why is this horrifying the third world totes that have since been
[1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:56.080]  taken over by the IMF and World Bank they want the UN to run everything
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:02.320]  because the UN that they now see as simply a sort of socialist cash
[1:46:02.320 --> 1:46:07.600]  generating machine a cash cow for third world countries the UN no longer serves
[1:46:07.600 --> 1:46:12.320]  any purpose except first its own enrichment and then a little bit of
[1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:16.760]  trickle down after it spent all that it wants on its own vast bureaucracies and
[1:46:16.760 --> 1:46:20.880]  you know there are 200 of those already at least 200 represented here at this
[1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:26.600]  conference unbelievable alphabet soup of acronyms for these different you know
[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:33.160]  UNEPs and WMOs and WFF this and that hundreds of them and all of that being
[1:46:33.160 --> 1:46:36.880]  paid for almost entirely by the taxpayers of the West and occasionally
[1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:41.160]  letting some money trickle down third world countries whose leaders therefore
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:46.240]  want to get this money for their own Swiss bank accounts and they look to the
[1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:51.600]  UN as simply another source of cash and so they're trying to buy the UN is
[1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:54.240]  trying to buy these third world countries by saying well we're going to
[1:46:54.240 --> 1:46:58.440]  really make the developed countries pay and the reason the third world countries
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:03.240]  are now so annoyed with the Danish draft which was simply intended to try and
[1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:06.320]  facilitate agreement but it got out into the Guardian before it had
[1:47:06.320 --> 1:47:11.480]  done its job and therefore the Guardian has rather blown the negotiations out
[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:15.920]  into the open the reason why the third world countries are annoyed about this
[1:47:15.920 --> 1:47:20.560]  is because it isn't their friend the UN that will be running things it's the
[1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:25.880]  much stiffer much more business-like World Bank and IMF now of course the
[1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:29.480]  trouble is that from the point of view of Western countries whether it's the UN
[1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:33.400]  or the World Bank and the IMF that's running this world government one
[1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:37.080]  astonishing characteristic and I've looked right through this treaty and I
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:41.120]  can confirm this is just the same as in the previous draft the word election
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:47.520]  democracy ballot vote does not appear anywhere the one thing that's quite clear
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:53.440]  is that these enormous powers of taxation and interference enormous
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:58.720]  powers of devying this and taxing that and funding the other are all going to
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:04.360]  be without any representation at all now the old principle as you know well on
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:08.960]  which the US Constitution is found is that there should be no taxation of
[1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:15.040]  any citizen unless the body taxing that citizen represents that citizen by being
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:21.040]  elected by no taxation without representation but this world climate
[1:48:21.040 --> 1:48:27.280]  body this world government is not going to be elected by anyone it's going to be
[1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:34.120]  a self-appointed self-perpetuating bureaucracy just like the EU commissars
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:38.720]  who now run the European Union and make 90% of our laws we have a parliament
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:42.560]  of course it's more or less completely redundant we might as well sir let it let
[1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:46.160]  it go to the Thames that were they're now trying to use that model and have it
[1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:52.520]  on international scale with no election no ballot no vote no right to call these
[1:48:52.520 --> 1:48:56.960]  people to account no right to question them no right to remove them no right
[1:48:56.960 --> 1:49:02.000]  to replace this so in the United Nations word-wide so when the United Nations
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:06.400]  says this is the greatest moment for world government this is the year of the
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:10.320]  establishment of global governance as the head of the EU and his mankind moon
[1:49:10.320 --> 1:49:15.920]  the head of the UN secretary general has said they really mean it and so we now
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:20.200]  stand here at the precipice you are there in Copenhagen here's the big
[1:49:20.200 --> 1:49:26.560]  question looking at this being inside of it watching it what do you predict is
[1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:32.880]  going to happen and if we lose this and they do get it ratified then we start
[1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:38.240]  fighting it at the national level what do you see happening let me tell you what
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:44.680]  worries me about all this what worries me is that this treaty has been through
[1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:49.600]  several negotiating rounds and yet although they've taken out the word
[1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:52.800]  government because I've screamed at them and you've screamed at them and everybody
[1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:57.480]  screamed at them all the mechanisms of government all the funding sources funding
[1:49:57.480 --> 1:50:03.120]  streams they call or funding windows in the latest phrase sounds very coy but
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:08.000]  actually it means ways of raiding the taxpayers all of these things are still
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:11.960]  in place and have not only survived the previous draft draft but have been
[1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:17.240]  considerably amplified so what we're looking at is I'm afraid there's no
[1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:23.000]  other way of putting this it is a worldwide conspiracy by the governing
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:29.280]  class against the government by the big boys against the little guy by the rich
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:34.600]  against the poor by the strong against the weak and if you're a little guy
[1:50:34.600 --> 1:50:40.520]  doing your honest job of work to protect and pay for your family you have good
[1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:46.200]  reason to be very frightened at this moment and if you think that our kind
[1:50:46.200 --> 1:50:51.520]  host and I have been winding each other up and frothing at the mouth about
[1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:55.680]  something that's just another global government conspiracy clear the theory I
[1:50:55.680 --> 1:51:02.040]  just have three words read the treaty as a result of the fuss I've made there
[1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:07.400]  is a chance that by now if you go on to the UN framework convention website
[1:51:07.400 --> 1:51:16.440]  I think UNFCCC.int then you may be able to find this treaty now in draft because
[1:51:16.440 --> 1:51:19.960]  I have made quite a big stink about it not being immediately available when I
[1:51:19.960 --> 1:51:25.480]  asked I think they have been shamed now into putting this up on the web it'll
[1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:29.240]  probably still quite hard to find why don't you all have a look if you if you
[1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:35.720]  doubt in any way what I've been saying to you about the magnitude and breadth of
[1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:41.800]  the scope of this treaty the powers and and the wealth that it will transfer from
[1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:48.560]  you and your country to an alien unelected communistic bureaucracy with
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:53.400]  power to control all free markets worldwide with the power to levy taxes
[1:51:53.400 --> 1:51:57.520]  on every financial transaction across the international border we're looking at
[1:51:57.520 --> 1:52:05.640]  an enormous enormous communistic government which in its sheer scale is
[1:52:05.640 --> 1:52:10.000]  disproportionate to any conceivable threat from CO2 particularly now that
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:15.520]  we know by measurement that all of the US models were wrong and CO2 is simply
[1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:20.000]  harmless it's an outrage and I'd like to tell you if I may what you should do
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:25.360]  about it as soon as you have finished listening to this program you must dive
[1:52:25.360 --> 1:52:30.000]  for the telephone and you must telephone the US Senate and you must
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:35.320]  demand to speak to your senator or to one of his senior staffers do not be
[1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:39.240]  armed off with a receptionist a switchboard operator a secretary or an
[1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:44.480]  intern you must speak to a senior staffer or to the senator himself and you
[1:52:44.480 --> 1:52:49.440]  must bring both of the senators for your state and they'll tell you on the switch
[1:52:49.440 --> 1:52:55.320]  board who those senators are and you must say the Treaty of Copenhagen shall not
[1:52:55.320 --> 1:53:01.480]  pass the more of you do this the more vigorously do it the more plainly but
[1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:07.040]  always polite you put your point to your senator and to the anti senior staff the
[1:53:07.040 --> 1:53:12.080]  more likely it is that the Senate will refuse to ratify the treaty and even
[1:53:12.080 --> 1:53:17.240]  though there are various backdoor ways by which Obama has already said via his
[1:53:17.240 --> 1:53:21.080]  staff during the election campaign that he would try to circumvent your
[1:53:21.080 --> 1:53:28.920]  constitution by going round the back and allowing the treaty to be enacted into
[1:53:28.920 --> 1:53:33.560]  domestic law by a simple majority of both houses or simply by signing it by his
[1:53:33.560 --> 1:53:38.880]  executive authority and then using his majority on the Supreme Court to say
[1:53:38.880 --> 1:53:43.080]  that that's the way the trend in law is moving and therefore we'll count that as
[1:53:43.080 --> 1:53:47.440]  though it were a valid treaty and the present Supreme Court will do that you
[1:53:47.440 --> 1:53:52.400]  know if you give it half a chance and you need to make absolutely sure that
[1:53:52.400 --> 1:53:56.600]  your senators are told this treaty shall not pass so that if any of these
[1:53:56.600 --> 1:54:00.360]  backdoor ways of pushing the treaty through against the will of the Senate
[1:54:00.360 --> 1:54:06.320]  are tried the Senate will if necessary exercise the power that it has to
[1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:10.960]  establish the impeachment of your president if he does try what his
[1:54:10.960 --> 1:54:16.360]  staff has said during his campaign for election that he would try so it's up to
[1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:22.240]  you now you only have ten days left of being a free country with the
[1:54:22.240 --> 1:54:26.760]  Constitution of your own because once he shines that treaty and with his Nobel
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:31.840]  Peace Prize and the millions of cleaning zombies screaming at Eric Copenhagen he
[1:54:31.840 --> 1:54:36.920]  will sign anything once that happens that it's bye-bye to your Constitution it's
[1:54:36.920 --> 1:54:42.920]  bye-bye to the freedom which America has long been a beacon to the world it has
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:48.360]  offered the beacon of freedom to the world now you are in immediate peril of
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:53.760]  losing that freedom however extreme what I'm saying to you may sound every word
[1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:59.000]  of it is very fire the truth that is the intention of your I'm going to call it
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:04.400]  this your Communist president and your Communist administration your Communist
[1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:09.400]  science advisor who only 25 years ago was saying that there would be such a
[1:55:09.400 --> 1:55:14.280]  global cooling caused by mankind that ice would accumulate on the Antarctic and
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:18.240]  it would tilt into the sea and cause a tidal wave bigger than any in human
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:22.200]  history wiping out all coastal communities worldwide now he says
[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:25.440]  global warming will cause exactly the same thing they were right and wipe out
[1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:28.760]  coastal communities worldwide all of this is going on these people are
[1:55:28.760 --> 1:55:33.400]  communists they do not have the best interest of you or your country at heart
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:38.760]  I would not normally speak in this way about your elected administration but
[1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:41.760]  frankly I think you were misled into believing that there was going to be
[1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:46.680]  change you could believe it this is change on a scale that is simply almost
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:52.800]  unbelievable but that is what it's like unless you use your last day of freedom
[1:55:52.800 --> 1:55:57.280]  to stop it but once this treaty goes through you can wing your senator you
[1:55:57.280 --> 1:56:01.480]  can vote him in you vote him out vote for a different president it won't make
[1:56:01.480 --> 1:56:07.040]  any difference once this treaty by your nation you will never be free never be
[1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:12.600]  from that's another key point is it is that does the latest treaty still have
[1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:16.680]  the wording that there has to be unanimous vote by all the parties to let
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:22.280]  your country leave at the moment there is no wording that allows you to leave
[1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:26.680]  unilaterally and therefore the usual provisioning international treaties
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:30.320]  under the Vienna Convention prevails which is there has to be unanimous vote
[1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:34.320]  of all other party to let you out Lord mountain any amendment that needs to be
[1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:37.920]  put into the streets but of course it's yet there despite our having graced this
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:43.040]  with previous draft Lord Christopher Moncton we know we're coming down to the
[1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:46.320]  end I want to say bye to you here at the break you've agreed that at the end of
[1:56:46.320 --> 1:56:51.000]  Copenhagen to pop back in with the final report but as you said this is a
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:55.800]  complete world government takeover from bancai moons on mouth from the head of
[1:56:55.800 --> 1:57:01.920]  the EU zone mouth this is really happening total global control grid
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:07.160]  Al Gore says it's not enough he wants even more of our money they know it's a
[1:57:07.160 --> 1:57:14.000]  fraud these are piratical thieves and we are two seconds to midnight as you have
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:19.720]  so eloquently said but the fraud has been exposed but it appears they don't
[1:57:19.720 --> 1:57:23.960]  care they're just going to go forward establishing this carbon dioxide
[1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:28.680]  dictatorship that they know that gas is involved in all human activity all life
[1:57:28.680 --> 1:57:34.600]  and by picking that gas they have a total dictatorship I mean this is the
[1:57:34.600 --> 1:57:39.400]  dawn of a new dark age with these control freaks preparing to bring us all
[1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:44.320]  in as chattel slaves and hysterical though that may sound if you think
[1:57:44.320 --> 1:57:49.080]  it does that unfortunately ladies and gentlemen if you're listening tonight
[1:57:49.080 --> 1:57:55.240]  every word of what your kind has said is regrettably true it breaks my heart to
[1:57:55.240 --> 1:58:00.680]  say it and I beg you get on to your center while you still can you only have
[1:58:00.680 --> 1:58:05.440]  10 days of freedom left already there have been scientists like James Hampton
[1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:11.920]  saying that anyone who are as I have to be put on trial and for high crimes
[1:58:11.920 --> 1:58:16.960]  against me man because I want the world free yes they want to execute no
[1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:20.760]  apologies I make they want to kill people that don't agree with them Lord
[1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:25.160]  Moncton let me say bye to you during the break I really appreciate the time fire

[2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:39.360]  full hour of this explains the banking dictatorship using carbon tax to control
[2:00:39.360 --> 2:00:43.720]  our planet Lord mocked us with us for an additional four minutes to finish his
[2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:48.520]  point and then I want to ask him about the prostitutes the caviar the jets the
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:54.440]  limos the the the open hypocrisy of these people I mean even by their own
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:01:00.680]  fraud saying carbon dioxide is this deadly poison Lord Moncton from Copenhagen finishing
[2:01:00.680 --> 2:01:04.880]  your point yes indeed in fact I was just saying god bless America because
[2:01:04.880 --> 2:01:11.000]  cheerfully say again but let's take up your point there are 12 limousine carbon
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:16.480]  emitting to drive the delegates around because it's too cold for them to walk
[2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:20.920]  to the global warming conference the nice iron is there just as most of the
[2:01:20.920 --> 2:01:24.440]  United States is blanketed in snow to a further point south when there's been
[2:01:24.440 --> 2:01:28.200]  seen in recent history or in some place in history at all here we are shivering
[2:01:28.200 --> 2:01:35.640]  in Copenhagen to 1200 gas guzzling limos 140 private jets hey I didn't even come
[2:01:35.640 --> 2:01:39.880]  in my private jet all six of them are out for service at the moment I came by
[2:01:39.880 --> 2:01:46.480]  by trade which is very carbon efficient or so we're told and when we arrived in
[2:01:46.480 --> 2:01:55.560]  Copenhagen wherever you go there are green sprayed signs saying open Hagan but
[2:01:55.560 --> 2:01:59.920]  in fact those of us who've listened to the maundering comments of the useless
[2:01:59.920 --> 2:02:05.200]  national delegates in the conference chamber are calling it open Hagan and
[2:02:05.200 --> 2:02:08.600]  of course those delegates are then rushing off down to the red light
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:12.840]  district having fun with the prostitutes exactly as you said use their limos to
[2:02:12.840 --> 2:02:18.560]  get there and I suppose we might call that group and Hagan but it is a
[2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:23.480]  disgrace what's going on it shows that what is really happening here is one
[2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:27.720]  law for the rich and one for the poor one for the governing class and one for
[2:02:27.720 --> 2:02:32.240]  the rest of it they are not cutting their carbon footprint but my goodness
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:36.080]  they're going to charge you through the nose if you don't cut yours so this is
[2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:41.920]  an asymmetrical conference here which is the governing class supported by the
[2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:46.240]  tens of thousands of teeming zombies from the environmental group
[2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:49.680]  I call them they like to shorten all their words so I'll do it they're
[2:02:49.680 --> 2:02:56.960]  in viral and these people are going to take away everything that is dear to us
[2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:02.440]  in your constitution every element and your freedom every chance of prosperity
[2:03:02.440 --> 2:03:05.920]  every chance of recovery from the present economic procession because they
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:11.000]  want control they they want and they want absolute control this is nothing
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:17.680]  less than a bureaucratic coup d'etat which is they from succeeding by the way
[2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:20.960]  there was an article in the London Telegraph today climate gate Barack
[2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:27.680]  Obama's rule by EPA decree is a coup d'etat against Congress made in Britain
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:31.080]  and and during the break you made a parallel at the last time Copenhagen
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:35.480]  had this much propaganda was when the SS were in control that's right
[2:03:35.480 --> 2:03:40.440]  everywhere there are what if they're now green instead of red white and black but
[2:03:40.440 --> 2:03:45.120]  there are banners everywhere that are deeply reminiscent of the SS and they
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:49.440]  of course occupied Copenhagen and Denmark as a whole during the war and
[2:03:49.440 --> 2:03:54.040]  Denmark to do it credit thanks to its king and the guts of its people managed
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:58.440]  to make sure that practically no Jews got sent from Denmark to the gas chambers
[2:03:58.440 --> 2:04:03.280]  because the people of Denmark stood by the Jews in the most wonderful way but
[2:04:03.280 --> 2:04:09.720]  now Denmark's leaders are among the worst offends in signing away the freedoms
[2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:15.840]  that Denmark won with the Allies during the war precisely to prevent the kind
[2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:20.400]  of sinister dictatorship alright perhaps less violent and less brutal than
[2:04:20.400 --> 2:04:23.920]  what happened under the Nazis but a dictatorship well they just kill you by
[2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:28.160]  starving you to death they just kill you like Stalin did in the Ukraine by cutting
[2:04:28.160 --> 2:04:32.800]  off your food that's right they'll be cutting off not only your food but your
[2:04:32.800 --> 2:04:36.760]  electricity you won't be able to get up to the top of your tower block because
[2:04:36.760 --> 2:04:41.160]  it won't work the elevator won't work no electricity can drive it there'll be a
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:45.360]  carbon put card so that everywhere you go shopping you'll be limited to what you
[2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:50.640]  can have Lord Moncton by fuel it's going to be a disaster unless you get on to
[2:04:50.640 --> 2:04:55.840]  your senator right after we're out of time Godspeed Godspeed sir there in
[2:04:55.840 --> 2:05:00.800]  Copenhagen thank you so much for all your time we'll be right back this is
[2:05:00.800 --> 2:05:04.280]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered
[2:05:04.280 --> 2:05:08.120]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[2:05:08.120 --> 2:05:12.400]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[2:05:12.400 --> 2:05:16.680]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[2:05:16.680 --> 2:05:21.040]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[2:05:21.040 --> 2:05:25.120]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[2:05:25.120 --> 2:05:29.680]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[2:05:29.680 --> 2:05:33.800]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[2:05:33.800 --> 2:05:37.560]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[2:05:37.560 --> 2:05:41.480]  powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks
[2:05:41.480 --> 2:05:44.320]  I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by solutions from
[2:05:44.320 --> 2:05:47.760]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[2:05:47.760 --> 2:05:53.400]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government

[2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:05.640]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[2:07:05.640 --> 2:07:11.120]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:14.880]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:19.920]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[2:07:19.920 --> 2:07:25.040]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[2:07:25.040 --> 2:07:29.000]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:33.680]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[2:07:33.680 --> 2:07:37.720]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[2:07:37.720 --> 2:07:41.400]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[2:07:41.400 --> 2:07:46.480]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[2:07:46.480 --> 2:07:53.560]  a fall of the republic yet your copy of full of the republic on DVD at infowars.com
[2:07:53.560 --> 2:08:00.720]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[2:08:05.040 --> 2:08:12.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:08:12.880 --> 2:08:20.400]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:28.400]  Alex Jones you could hear Lord Moncton literally frothing wanting to warn you
[2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:31.680]  and tell you what's in the treaties we have the first draft we now have the
[2:08:31.680 --> 2:08:35.840]  second draft global government taxes on everything the UN says it's bubble
[2:08:35.840 --> 2:08:41.280]  government reading the original treaty I knew the IMF and World Bank would run
[2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:44.600]  it all secretly and you'd pay your tax to them that's what the banker said 20
[2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:49.520]  years ago so now the third world's freaking out going well we we've been
[2:08:49.520 --> 2:08:54.080]  taught to hate the West and we've been taught that we're gonna get all the
[2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:58.040]  middle classes money but wait a minute the same banks the IMF and World Bank
[2:08:58.040 --> 2:09:03.120]  that raped our countries they're gonna have control of this we thought we were
[2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:08.480]  gonna get the power see that's how the scam works but now in the internal
[2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:14.560]  memos London Guardian reports Copenhagen climate summit in disarray after
[2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:20.440]  Danish techs leak developing countries react furiously to leak draft agreement
[2:09:20.440 --> 2:09:24.480]  that would hand more power to rich nations sideline the UN's negotiating
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:28.680]  role and abandon the Kyoto protocol this is just going to be the private
[2:09:28.680 --> 2:09:32.720]  central banks holding company fellow reserve IMF World Bank Bank of England
[2:09:32.720 --> 2:09:38.600]  Bundesbank literally raping everyone they will set the rules they will administer
[2:09:38.600 --> 2:09:43.640]  it you you think the banks are happy with 23.7 trillion they stole in the U.S.
[2:09:43.640 --> 2:09:50.080]  50 trillion worldwide plus no they want the direct power the direct
[2:09:50.080 --> 2:09:53.560]  authority as David Rockefeller said a world government run by
[2:09:53.560 --> 2:09:58.720]  international banks and now we have the internal communiques of what they're
[2:09:58.720 --> 2:10:02.760]  gonna add in the next week and a half world government this is like the
[2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:06.080]  opposite of the Declaration of Independence where the founders met for
[2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:09.880]  weeks hammering it out this is the founders of the global tyranny who set
[2:10:09.880 --> 2:10:13.480]  up this whole system got their propaganda ready already have a lot of their
[2:10:13.480 --> 2:10:18.480]  world taxes in place openly saying nations sign on to be under our
[2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:25.360]  dictatorial unelected control it's happening right now and there is Ted
[2:10:25.360 --> 2:10:29.960]  conference and all these other big and scientific conferences working with the
[2:10:29.960 --> 2:10:34.520]  media to craft the propaganda the UN admits they're running around organizing
[2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:38.880]  all this behind the scenes brainwashing your kids in public schools I mean this
[2:10:38.880 --> 2:10:44.680]  is so monstrous as Lord Moncton said and to hear his passion to know this is
[2:10:44.680 --> 2:10:48.960]  happening to know our countries are falling to this to know this is world
[2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:53.800]  government the globalist all the public telling you none of this existed so we
[2:10:53.800 --> 2:10:58.680]  couldn't build organizations to fight it when they finally brought this in but
[2:10:58.680 --> 2:11:02.240]  more leaks are coming out more documents are coming out more people are
[2:11:02.240 --> 2:11:07.080]  seeing this for the tyranny it is even inside the system and are saying no and
[2:11:07.080 --> 2:11:10.840]  you guys said you printed it for me but I couldn't find it I want that Gourvid
[2:11:10.840 --> 2:11:14.880]  all story again that's up on info wars calm that Darren that Aaron Dykes
[2:11:14.880 --> 2:11:20.960]  posted great folks in the forum found the playboy interview he did calling for
[2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:25.240]  forced population reduction one-child policies a global authority a global
[2:11:25.240 --> 2:11:29.200]  government to license same thing that's an eco science same thing that's in
[2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:33.920]  hundreds of books that these people write this is what they want they once
[2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:38.120]  you're starving to death they want you dying they see you as a parasite I
[2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:42.000]  played the winner of the Berlin Film Festival that they show kids in public
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:47.360]  schools worldwide where humans are called a disease a parasite that is what the
[2:11:47.360 --> 2:11:52.280]  elites believe but I want to play you this propaganda piece from Ted
[2:11:52.280 --> 2:11:55.760]  conference first they're talking in the conference about how they get their
[2:11:55.760 --> 2:11:59.080]  headlines right and how global warming is real and oh aren't they good and
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:01.480]  they're all a bunch of useful idiots most of them aren't involved in the
[2:12:01.480 --> 2:12:05.480]  fraud they just believe it just like Nazis believe Hitler was good or Soviets
[2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:11.160]  believe Stalin was good or Chinese believe Mao was good they were kind then
[2:12:11.160 --> 2:12:15.880]  it cuts to oh if we have tracker boxes in all your cars and track everywhere you
[2:12:15.880 --> 2:12:20.560]  go that will end traffic and save the earth and tax you and track you and
[2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:27.200]  Obama's now proposing this in the US this is happening do you heard Lord
[2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:31.400]  Monkton by stealth they're implementing at the state and regional level already I
[2:12:31.400 --> 2:12:38.120]  mean it's so incredible that's why I keep plugging fall the Republic two hour
[2:12:38.120 --> 2:12:42.480]  24-minute film a full hour of it exposes the whole climate fraud the global
[2:12:42.480 --> 2:12:46.680]  government the private tax debankers their own statements people are ready to
[2:12:46.680 --> 2:12:52.640]  see the truth get fall of the Republic on DVD today make copies of it give it

[2:13:38.800 --> 2:13:42.640]  back and start taking calls and getting in to all these I mean it's just the
[2:13:42.640 --> 2:13:47.080]  developments are so huge and the new leaked documents about how banks are
[2:13:47.080 --> 2:13:50.280]  gonna run this are so huge I mean it's old news to you but here it is mainstream
[2:13:50.280 --> 2:14:01.880]  media and we've got even clear picture here so 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231
[2:14:01.880 --> 2:14:05.360]  here's the propaganda piece
[2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:10.760]  well gore is gonna save us
[2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:22.720]  I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes
[2:14:22.720 --> 2:14:26.480]  into making the headlines you see in the paper headlines that look like this when
[2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:29.040]  they have to do with climate change and headlines that look like this when they
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:32.160]  have to do with air quality or smog they're both two branches of the same
[2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:35.920]  field of atmospheric science recently the headlines looked like this when the
[2:14:35.920 --> 2:14:39.640]  intergovernmental panel on climate change or IPCC put out their report on the
[2:14:39.640 --> 2:14:42.800]  state of understanding of the atmospheric system that report was written
[2:14:42.800 --> 2:14:47.800]  by 620 scientists from 40 countries they wrote almost a thousand pages on the
[2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:51.800]  topic and all of those pages were viewed by another 400 plus scientists and
[2:14:51.800 --> 2:14:56.680]  reviewers from 113 countries it's a big community it's such a big community in
[2:14:56.680 --> 2:14:59.480]  fact that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world
[2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:03.760]  over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that and every
[2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:06.880]  one of those scientists is in a research group and every research group studies a
[2:15:06.880 --> 2:15:10.600]  wide variety of topics for us at Cambridge it's as varied as the El Nino
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:18.280]  Oscillation all right let's stop right there the UN was caught last week the
[2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:23.400]  mainstream news we covered it here AP Fox you name it covered it they went out
[2:15:23.400 --> 2:15:29.880]  and hired socialist and communist scientists and got them to lie and now
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:34.600]  NOAA has been caught NASA has been caught the government research centers in
[2:15:34.600 --> 2:15:40.000]  Australia in Canada in England they've all been caught they just I mean they
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:44.080]  tell you polar bears can't swim folks they tell you penguins can't swim they
[2:15:44.080 --> 2:15:51.120]  tell you the Arctic melted it got bigger they just lie there's hundreds of
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:55.160]  thousands of climatologists and hydrologists and meteorologists they
[2:15:55.160 --> 2:16:02.120]  went and hired a 600 people on government payroll but it's not communism the
[2:16:02.120 --> 2:16:05.840]  low levels are communist they believe it they believe they're lying for a good
[2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:11.160]  reason it's the banks they want a monopoly don't you get it it's serfdom
[2:16:11.160 --> 2:16:17.200]  it's slavery let's just go back to her she's so sick here it is I meant to the
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:20.280]  assimilation of satellite data to emissions from crops that produce
[2:16:20.280 --> 2:16:23.800]  biofuels which is what I happen to study and in each one of these research
[2:16:23.800 --> 2:16:27.480]  areas of which there are even more there are PhD students like me and we study
[2:16:27.480 --> 2:16:30.720]  incredibly narrow topics things as narrow as a few processes or a few
[2:16:30.720 --> 2:16:34.880]  molecules and one of the molecules I study is called I supreme which is here
[2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:38.760]  the small organic molecule probably never heard of it the weight of a paper
[2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:42.880]  clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion 10 to the 21st they're gonna
[2:16:42.880 --> 2:16:47.040]  tax everything I supreme but despite its very small weight thousands of
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:50.840]  molecules just a total right here to equal the weight of all the people on
[2:16:50.840 --> 2:16:54.200]  the planet it's a huge amount of stuff it's equal to the weight of methane and
[2:16:54.200 --> 2:16:57.360]  because it's so much stuff it's really important for the atmospheric system
[2:16:57.360 --> 2:17:01.320]  because it's important for the atmospheric system we go to all lengths to
[2:17:01.320 --> 2:17:04.840]  study this thing we blow it up and look at the pieces this is the u4 small
[2:17:04.840 --> 2:17:09.840]  chamber in Spain atmospheric explosions are for things always been released by
[2:17:09.840 --> 2:17:13.440]  life and what happens in your car that things part of the atmosphere we run
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:17.440]  enormous models on supercomputers this is what I happen to do our models have
[2:17:17.440 --> 2:17:22.080]  hundreds of thousands of grid boxes of variables each on minute we know about
[2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:25.640]  those computer programs to perform our integrations copies of them dozens of
[2:17:25.640 --> 2:17:29.360]  integrations in order to understand what's happening we also fly all over
[2:17:29.360 --> 2:17:32.440]  the world looking for this thing I recently joined a field campaign in
[2:17:32.440 --> 2:17:36.320]  Malaysia there are others we found a global atmospheric watch tower there in
[2:17:36.320 --> 2:17:39.320]  the middle of the rainforest and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth
[2:17:39.320 --> 2:17:42.720]  of scientific equipment off this tower to look for ice supreme and of course
[2:17:42.720 --> 2:17:45.360]  other things while we were there this is the tower in the middle of the rain
[2:17:45.360 --> 2:17:49.320]  force from above and this is the tower from below and on part of that field
[2:17:49.320 --> 2:17:53.400]  campaign we even brought an aircraft with us and this plane the model BA 146
[2:17:53.400 --> 2:17:58.520]  which is run by fam normally flies 120 to 130 people so maybe you took a similar
[2:17:58.520 --> 2:18:02.680]  aircraft to get here today but we didn't just fly it we were flying at 100 meters
[2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:06.120]  above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule incredibly dangerous stuff
[2:18:06.120 --> 2:18:10.880]  we have to fly in a special incline in order to make measurements we hire just
[2:18:10.880 --> 2:18:17.040]  all a bunch of flim flam look I'm a heroic chick I'm like a superhero look
[2:18:17.040 --> 2:18:24.600]  science methane from cows it's evil I mean these people are taking over
[2:18:24.600 --> 2:18:31.200]  everything it's a complete sick joke their parasites they like running your
[2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:35.040]  life their control freaks don't you understand there's always people that
[2:18:35.040 --> 2:18:40.600]  want to dominate others and that's what's being set up a criminal world
[2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:45.960]  government with a couple thousand scientists hired by the UN we have their
[2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:50.080]  internal documents where they go hire people for their agenda with the big
[2:18:50.080 --> 2:18:57.160]  banks with the insurance companies with the oil companies all in this together
[2:18:57.160 --> 2:19:04.080]  now I don't know if this woman's a useful idiot but the point is a lot of
[2:19:04.080 --> 2:19:08.160]  these scientists the top scientists all the main top scientists from Holdren
[2:19:08.160 --> 2:19:14.520]  on down have been caught in the emails engaged in fraud we're gonna come back
[2:19:14.520 --> 2:19:18.360]  and finish this clip and then it goes into hey you saw that now let's talk
[2:19:18.360 --> 2:19:23.000]  about tracking your cars that'll fix traffic doesn't sound reasonable we're
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:27.960]  gonna tax you and track everywhere you go we're gonna run your life if you'll
[2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:32.480]  just let us micromanage everything you do we'll make your life wonderful we're
[2:19:32.480 --> 2:19:37.040]  the government run by big corrupt banks notice all the SWAT teams and cameras
[2:19:37.040 --> 2:19:41.200]  around you notice the CPS grabbing everybody's kids notice everybody dying
[2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:46.600]  on your street of cancer isn't it fun take the shots they're good for you and
[2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:50.920]  then they all write these internal white papers about how they want to kill us
[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:55.120]  we're gonna finish this clip then play the winner of the Berlin Film Festival
[2:19:55.120 --> 2:19:59.040]  again that shows humans as a parasite this is what they really think of you
[2:19:59.040 --> 2:20:04.680]  they want you dead or the doornail this is big John Lipscomb world government
[2:20:04.680 --> 2:20:08.880]  and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching the choices you make today
[2:20:08.880 --> 2:20:13.000]  will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow I have two
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:17.720]  solutions for you so you and your family can stay strong and free

[2:21:01.440 --> 2:21:05.800]  of control irresponsible federal deficit spending increasing the money supply
[2:21:05.800 --> 2:21:10.000]  without increasing productive output leads to inflation you get less for your
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:13.720]  money if you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future then

[2:24:08.640 --> 2:24:14.640]  calls coming up at 1-800-259-9231 I'm gonna break down all the giant
[2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:19.520]  developments more leaked documents and Lord Mockden went and got the latest
[2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:25.720]  version of the treaty financial taxes oil taxes power taxes global government
[2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:31.000]  authorities over all air travel you name it I mean it is just unbelievable
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:36.400]  criminal power grab but back to the Al Gore funded propaganda here it is
[2:24:36.400 --> 2:24:39.480]  pilots to do the maneuvering we have to get special flight clearance and as you
[2:24:39.480 --> 2:24:43.120]  come around the banks in these valleys the forces can get up to two G's and the
[2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:45.720]  scientists have to be completely harnessing in order to make measurements
[2:24:45.720 --> 2:24:49.360]  while they're on board so as you can imagine the inside of this aircraft
[2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:52.040]  doesn't look like any plan you would take on vacation it's a flying
[2:24:52.040 --> 2:24:54.480]  laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:24:59.760]  molecule we do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule and when
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:02.840]  one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:06.200]  molecule they write one scientific paper on the subject and out of that field
[2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:09.480]  campaign will probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or
[2:25:09.480 --> 2:25:13.520]  molecules and as a body of knowledge builds up it will form one subsection or
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:18.640]  one sub subsection of an assessment like the IPCC although we have others and
[2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:23.840]  each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections you can
[2:25:23.840 --> 2:25:27.760]  imagine the scale of the effort in each one of those assessments that we write
[2:25:27.760 --> 2:25:31.280]  we always tag on a summary and the summary is written for a non scientific
[2:25:31.280 --> 2:25:35.240]  audience and we hand that summary to journalists and policymakers in order to
[2:25:35.240 --> 2:25:40.200]  make headlines like these thank you very much
[2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:53.840]  traffic is a global epidemic US traffic is creating 45% of the world's air
[2:25:53.840 --> 2:25:59.000]  pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic costs 20 billion a year would you
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:03.720]  pay for cleaner air on a faster commute Stockholm put it to a vote I voted for
[2:26:03.720 --> 2:26:12.440]  it yes I voted for it I vote for it way not old enough to vote we had to do
[2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:18.760]  something in Stockholm to improve the environment and to get a better flow in
[2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:23.760]  the traffic we put a price on taking your car into the central parts of
[2:26:23.760 --> 2:26:29.200]  Stockholm and we call that congestion charges if you start a system like this
[2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:34.440]  and it doesn't work on the first day then you will be in big trouble it must be
[2:26:34.440 --> 2:26:40.480]  perfect from day one there are 18 entry gates to the city each is equipped with
[2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:45.400]  cameras pictures are taken of the rear and front license plates these pictures
[2:26:45.400 --> 2:26:49.920]  are sent to a central system that identifies the license plates and makes
[2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:54.280]  sure that the right person pays for the right passages one of the obstacles we
[2:26:54.280 --> 2:26:59.320]  overcame was the OCR the optical character reading of the license plate we
[2:26:59.320 --> 2:27:04.760]  went out IBM's global organization and the R&D centers and find a very good
[2:27:04.760 --> 2:27:08.880]  software we could use and we managed to implement it in two months time this is
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:12.760]  the heart of the system where all images and passages are being processed over
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:19.760]  99% of all pictures are correctly identified this is how it should be all
[2:27:19.760 --> 2:27:25.520]  the time behind me you can see the traffic and the clock is 6 p.m. before
[2:27:25.520 --> 2:27:28.640]  we had the congestion charging the traffic was chewing up at this time of
[2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:35.440]  the day I think it's a good idea because I think that we should take care of the
[2:27:35.440 --> 2:27:41.000]  environment in the city the traffic went down with about 22% and the air
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:45.760]  pollution was about 14% better it's a huge international interest from
[2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:51.160]  different part of the world from the United States from Latin America from
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:57.160]  China and it's really a pressure to tell people not what we are planning to do
[2:27:57.160 --> 2:28:02.280]  what what we actually have done in Stockholm I voted for it as I did not
[2:28:02.280 --> 2:28:09.680]  my husband so I did I think he is not thinking like me for the future I'm
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:14.640]  thinking for the children and the grandchildren now what does that add
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:19.960]  say that's brought to you by IBM the folks that funded the Nazis the numbers
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:25.760]  on people's arms were to be put in IBM machines it's a eugenics company oh her
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:29.120]  husband's bad he doesn't care about the children and of course they've done
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:33.120]  congestion charges in London and other places those numbers are frauds it does
[2:28:33.120 --> 2:28:37.360]  almost nothing some people don't drive anymore because they can't afford the
[2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:45.800]  three four five six seven eight twenty pounds several dollars when you convert it per mile when
[2:28:45.800 --> 2:28:50.280]  you drive at peak times now in the US they that have trouble passing this so
[2:28:50.280 --> 2:28:53.520]  with the NAFTA superhighways right outside Austin I in fact I'm intended to
[2:28:53.520 --> 2:28:58.920]  take a camera crew out there no one takes the toll road where you got to put
[2:28:58.920 --> 2:29:03.080]  the money in you don't see anybody exiting it just license plate scans you
[2:29:03.080 --> 2:29:07.520]  and sends you a bill this is going to go on all the highways all the major roads
[2:29:07.520 --> 2:29:12.440]  are to be turned into toll roads eight thousand miles of Texas roads that came
[2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:17.400]  out in the state of Texas to be paid to the private country company Centra of
[2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:24.640]  Spain this is complete fraud this is mass raping they build our society around
[2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:30.320]  cars we live in a sprawling society it's designed for that the banks bankrupt
[2:29:30.320 --> 2:29:34.000]  the society to get us under their control then they throw a wet blanket on
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:38.560]  what's left of our economy with this taxing grid and now Obama's proposing
[2:29:38.560 --> 2:29:43.440]  it but with tracker boxes in your cars not just license plate scanners this is
[2:29:43.440 --> 2:29:52.120]  the takeover and IBM the beast company is the main group behind it we're on the

[2:32:59.120 --> 2:33:09.400]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central we're here live back Sunday
[2:33:09.400 --> 2:33:13.600]  4 to 6 p.m. with the Sunday abbreviated transmission against
[2:33:13.600 --> 2:33:18.240]  tyranny you have found it the front lines against the New World Order I am
[2:33:18.240 --> 2:33:22.600]  just reeling from the information breaking today with internal memorandum
[2:33:22.600 --> 2:33:26.240]  of the private banks to take full control of the world government we
[2:33:26.240 --> 2:33:29.200]  already knew they were going to be making the money off of it and administrating
[2:33:29.200 --> 2:33:33.040]  a lot of it this is administrating the entire system this is in the London
[2:33:33.040 --> 2:33:37.120]  Guardian we're going to be covering that after I talked to Solomon PJ Mark Jim
[2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:43.760]  Kathy and others but I want to explain something two miles from where I sit is a
[2:33:43.760 --> 2:33:48.600]  toll road and when you go on it it's license plate readers and they are
[2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:53.760]  putting these in nationwide for a national driving tax for carbon they
[2:33:53.760 --> 2:33:58.520]  don't care if you don't want it they're doing it we better take our
[2:33:58.520 --> 2:34:06.240]  governments back you know the Google CEO says yeah we're surveilling everything
[2:34:06.240 --> 2:34:09.960]  you do and giving it to the government so what and we're going to do it to you
[2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:14.160]  on the streets of America we're going to track everything you do we're going to
[2:34:14.160 --> 2:34:18.360]  control everything you do we're going to shut your resources off till your bank
[2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:22.240]  rub so you got to come with your hat in your hand for government health care and
[2:34:22.240 --> 2:34:29.000]  everything else these people are so diabolical how do I get the stupid public
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:34.480]  to wake up because this is going to be done incrementally like the frog in the
[2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:38.160]  pot I'm going to go to your calls please make your point quickly because I want
[2:34:38.160 --> 2:34:42.760]  to get to the next person get everybody involved on air we've got to start
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:45.880]  getting a healthy mistrust of the government we better cut it down to
[2:34:45.880 --> 2:34:49.240]  size because it works for a bunch of corporations that can come in and put
[2:34:49.240 --> 2:34:52.960]  50 cents in the vending machine and get a million dollars back that's basically
[2:34:52.960 --> 2:34:57.960]  what they get for lobbying on average they get millions of dollars in state and
[2:34:57.960 --> 2:35:03.600]  federal international lobbying for every dollar they put in it just it's simple
[2:35:03.600 --> 2:35:10.080]  it's a giant raping of society and the stuff that Moncton dropped on us in the
[2:35:10.080 --> 2:35:14.360]  last hour it was off the charts Steve Watson Aaron Dykes Paul Watson Curt
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:19.520]  Nemo I need you guys to break down that that hour long interview hour plus and
[2:35:19.520 --> 2:35:23.480]  and just get it out in headlines so people will then go watch the video and
[2:35:23.480 --> 2:35:31.600]  listen to the audio and I'm burning with passion to do more I've got more
[2:35:31.600 --> 2:35:36.320]  international TV to do today I've got Texas Monthly here doing an interview
[2:35:36.320 --> 2:35:41.400]  and all I want to do is go do YouTube videos rallying the people because when
[2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:44.040]  I do special videos they get so much more attention than just when I do the
[2:35:44.040 --> 2:35:49.720]  show for some reason I just want to warn people I had a reporter here
[2:35:49.720 --> 2:35:54.800]  yesterday with a national publication asking me why do you care why are you
[2:35:54.800 --> 2:36:00.320]  doing this why do you think I'm doing it justice I don't want to be a slave and

[2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:52.120]  it's worse than we can even describe

[2:37:47.600 --> 2:37:50.600]  there can't understand
[2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:06.920]  you know Aaron Dix wrote an article last night when I got up at four in the
[2:38:06.920 --> 2:38:11.520]  morning I saw he just posted it so he was here at four in the morning I don't
[2:38:11.520 --> 2:38:14.040]  tell him to be here till four in the morning he gets here about noon and
[2:38:14.040 --> 2:38:16.680]  stays till four in the morning he can't leave because he knows all this stuff
[2:38:16.680 --> 2:38:21.800]  about the federal informant that set up the people trying to get him to throw
[2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:25.520]  mall off cocktails turns out they never did it weren't planning it they got six
[2:38:25.520 --> 2:38:30.000]  years in prison apiece turns out he admits he's a federal informant and
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:34.360]  it's being reported by eyewitnesses in Austin that he tried to get them to
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:41.240]  firebomb brave new books that sells my films and books and has events where
[2:38:41.240 --> 2:38:47.280]  tomorrow or two days from now that's what these witnesses are saying he admits
[2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:51.640]  he tried to set people up to do firebombs I happened to know from internal
[2:38:51.640 --> 2:39:00.600]  police sources I heard this when the firebombing of the mansion happened from
[2:39:00.600 --> 2:39:03.960]  sources and couldn't go on air with it that it was connected to the feds
[2:39:03.960 --> 2:39:08.800]  locally trying to set up brave new books and myself and now the evidence is
[2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:13.880]  coming out I mean folks I got feds on my tail the Pentagon follows me around and
[2:39:13.880 --> 2:39:17.880]  it's admitted in the newspaper you understand we're fighting for America
[2:39:17.880 --> 2:39:30.640]  and freedom you understand how real this is and I'm so focused on you know over
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:34.000]  the mansion thing I never talked about this on air we had the BATF show up
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:39.160]  here when the mansion got firebombed and then we had these informant types
[2:39:39.160 --> 2:39:45.160]  coming around trying to give us information about it and it's just a
[2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:49.680]  total operation I mean I am blessed that I'm not even in prison right now thank
[2:39:49.680 --> 2:39:55.360]  God I keep my operation small thank God I watch my butt thank God I don't commit
[2:39:55.360 --> 2:40:07.200]  any crimes that's a whole nother subject it's just these people are so evil
[2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:16.080]  ladies and gentlemen they are so evil they are so bad
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:29.000]  and I just I just don't even I mean it's insane we live in Nazi Germany in
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:33.880]  1937 and it's just getting worse and worse and worse and the same globalist
[2:40:33.880 --> 2:40:38.560]  that funded Hitler Mao Stalin on record are now planning a mass coal here in
[2:40:38.560 --> 2:40:42.320]  America and they brainwashed the cops they're trying to brainwash the
[2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:47.360]  military it is just so horrible
[2:40:59.880 --> 2:41:04.440]  I can't tell you how many times I go to a book signing or a video showing her a
[2:41:04.440 --> 2:41:08.600]  speech and these cops walk up in plain clothes and say Alex let's go blow stuff
[2:41:08.600 --> 2:41:13.880]  up and of course I say no I'm nonviolent in fact I'm gonna call the police on you
[2:41:13.880 --> 2:41:21.080]  right now then they run off to their unmarked police cars outside but they
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:25.360]  don't care if they're able to if they're able to ever get into my operation
[2:41:25.360 --> 2:41:29.440]  they will just make it up that we're doing something that they these these
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:33.520]  people are pure evil ladies and gentlemen they think of their fellow humans
[2:41:33.520 --> 2:41:37.480]  as animals they think setting people up as a joke they think it's funny look at
[2:41:37.480 --> 2:41:43.920]  Tommy Chong that's a random video generator of images from info wars com
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:48.400]  that's fate that that just came up I was just thinking about Tommy Chong two
[2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:54.040]  minutes ago Tommy Chong's sons sold pipes but yeah you could smoke marijuana
[2:41:54.040 --> 2:42:01.320]  with and for five years in one county out of Pennsylvania where it's illegal to
[2:42:01.320 --> 2:42:06.920]  sell pipes they got hundreds of orders for the pipes because it's illegal to
[2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:11.880]  ship there and they always said no so the feds got an informant took them
[2:42:11.880 --> 2:42:21.440]  years hired at the pipe factory to go in and illegally ship it to the town so
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:26.480]  they could go arrest Tommy Chong that's the type of people we are dealing with
[2:42:26.480 --> 2:42:31.840]  and the federal court said yeah the US attorney said it doesn't matter if we've
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:35.240]  sent somebody in there to ship it out still a crime that the company let that
[2:42:35.240 --> 2:42:41.680]  happen that's how criminal this government is that's how evil these
[2:42:41.680 --> 2:42:48.160]  people are and I you know what I don't even know what to say anymore about this
[2:42:48.160 --> 2:42:55.280]  it's just I don't want my children to be slaves I want to be free I want you to
[2:42:55.280 --> 2:43:03.080]  be free and so I'm bad it's that simple and I have the New World Order just
[2:43:03.080 --> 2:43:07.800]  circling me like sharks and I just trust in God so we can just keep getting the
[2:43:07.800 --> 2:43:10.520]  message out keep getting the message out and God knows how they're gonna try to
[2:43:10.520 --> 2:43:16.320]  set me up they've tried so many other things God knows ladies and gentlemen
[2:43:19.480 --> 2:43:23.720]  God knows what's gonna happen to us
[2:43:23.720 --> 2:43:35.040]  but they've got terrorist units right here in the town I live in they're
[2:43:35.040 --> 2:43:41.920]  terrorists they're not anti-terror units I caught police and Fortune 599 when
[2:43:41.920 --> 2:43:46.520]  the Fortune 500 came to Austin dressed up like anarchist attacking people
[2:43:46.520 --> 2:43:49.840]  starting fights and then I had the anarchist leaders come over and threaten
[2:43:49.840 --> 2:43:52.640]  me and I said you work for the feds don't you and they said yeah and when we
[2:43:52.640 --> 2:43:56.080]  take over we're gonna kill you Jones that wasn't the cops that was the
[2:43:56.080 --> 2:44:04.640]  foundation people working with them and they pointed up to the men up on the
[2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:08.440]  with binoculars up on top the building and this one anarchist got up my face
[2:44:08.440 --> 2:44:11.840]  or the bumping enemy goes that's right I work for those guys up there and we're
[2:44:11.840 --> 2:44:16.360]  watching you buddy and they love it they hate this country they want to bring
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:19.920]  this country down they love the power working for the government they love
[2:44:19.920 --> 2:44:25.600]  the fact they can commit crimes they love the fact that they do all this
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:38.280]  all right I said I'm going to your phone calls I just it just gives me a
[2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:42.800]  gigantic headache to be in the middle of this but at the same time it's a good
[2:44:42.800 --> 2:44:46.120]  thing we're fighting the tyranny it's a good thing we're standing up to all of
[2:44:46.120 --> 2:44:52.840]  this evil it's a good thing that we're resisting a new world order and we're
[2:44:52.840 --> 2:44:55.360]  doing the right thing and we're not backing down we're telling the truth
[2:44:55.360 --> 2:44:59.440]  and we're the good guys and we're the people that are pure and honest and pure
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:04.400]  of heart and and and are honest and the people are waking up to this tyranny and
[2:45:04.400 --> 2:45:08.040]  I just want to bring this tyranny to justice I want to get our country back
[2:45:08.040 --> 2:45:11.280]  on the right track and not let these criminals in government and corporate
[2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:14.960]  America that think they own this country rape the living daylights out of

[2:47:01.040 --> 2:47:09.440]  lungs dot com what I want to do is in the last 20 minutes of the show have Aaron
[2:47:09.440 --> 2:47:12.200]  guy because he's the one doing the deep research on this and I already knew it
[2:47:12.200 --> 2:47:21.560]  was an operation and knew that we had people showing up at the office trying
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:27.960]  to talk to us about the mansion fire and then I had a police source that warned
[2:47:27.960 --> 2:47:32.360]  me that it was an intelligence operation that was probably an inside job by the
[2:47:32.360 --> 2:47:36.680]  government to get rid of the DPS director and have a police state crack down
[2:47:36.680 --> 2:47:44.320]  further and said a Texas wouldn't go under Homeland Security control and then
[2:47:44.320 --> 2:47:48.240]  it turns out the FBI informant who I was told was an informant at the time I
[2:47:48.240 --> 2:47:51.520]  didn't really know who they were I was just told about it from sources who did
[2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:58.680]  set up the two people from Austin up in up in Minneapolis St. Paul for the RNC
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:48:03.800]  last year and it's admitted he's done NPR interviews that the people never
[2:48:03.800 --> 2:48:06.480]  were gonna firebomb he kept telling him we got a firebomb we got to be real
[2:48:06.480 --> 2:48:10.360]  activist and then the kids never showed up to do the firebombing but they still
[2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:13.960]  arrested him so basically this guy just sat around talking about it and now
[2:48:13.960 --> 2:48:18.640]  eyewitnesses in Austin are saying yeah no this guy was having meetings with a
[2:48:18.640 --> 2:48:22.840]  Palestinian guy that got murdered and thrown in the lake all gutted and
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:26.920]  tortured and then they said it was a suicide with his arms bound in the water
[2:48:26.920 --> 2:48:33.640]  that's like Gary Webb who wrote the CIA crack cocaine story shooting himself
[2:48:33.640 --> 2:48:37.080]  twice in the head and witnesses seeing you know men climbing in and out of his
[2:48:37.080 --> 2:48:39.960]  house and the media said oh yeah it's quite normal to shoot yourself twice in
[2:48:39.960 --> 2:48:44.800]  the head turns out that guy is an admitted federal informant and eyewitnesses
[2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:49.000]  are saying it needs to be a criminal investigation of this that he wanted them
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:55.920]  to firebomb brave new books what they wanted to do was get the patsies in
[2:48:55.920 --> 2:49:00.200]  there to then claim brave new books was involved if that's true and it fits in
[2:49:00.200 --> 2:49:09.560]  and I knew it was a set up at the time when when I started getting all this
[2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:13.360]  chatter and people wanting to come over to the office and I was no no no it's
[2:49:13.360 --> 2:49:16.240]  going to let anybody at the office and our location is hidden and no one has
[2:49:16.240 --> 2:49:21.840]  ever to come here and and no one is you know we do not answer the door because
[2:49:21.840 --> 2:49:25.080]  we've had people try to set us up with other stuff I mean it's dangerous folks
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:29.080]  these informants are just very sinister and because they're they're not
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:33.160]  informants they're operatives these are intelligence operations being run and
[2:49:33.160 --> 2:49:43.480]  so I called the state police about this and they sent the BATF out because I
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:50.680]  said I know you these people are here and I believe this is an inside job and I
[2:49:50.680 --> 2:49:57.640]  wanted on record that I wasn't anywhere near any of their people so the whole
[2:49:57.640 --> 2:50:01.440]  thing in Minnesota the whole thing with with the governor's mansion all of this
[2:50:01.440 --> 2:50:08.280]  interconnected guaranteed and I don't know if this particular informant as is
[2:50:08.280 --> 2:50:12.920]  being reported with the brave new books or with the or with this Palestinian
[2:50:12.920 --> 2:50:16.720]  that was killed but these are a lot of witnesses that people know at brave new
[2:50:16.720 --> 2:50:22.200]  books and I trust their reports but again the establishment doesn't want a
[2:50:22.200 --> 2:50:26.560]  little bookstore educating the public down on Guadeloupe Street and these
[2:50:26.560 --> 2:50:35.640]  eyewitnesses say this federal informant beg them to firebomb brave new books and
[2:50:35.640 --> 2:50:39.640]  so this is the type of just craziness that we're living in the middle of and
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:42.640]  then I go to in the Fed rallies and it later gets declassified the army is
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:47.120]  there watching us they want to radicalize everything politically to
[2:50:47.120 --> 2:50:51.920]  demonize anyone that is outspoken and that's why I've always said we are
[2:50:51.920 --> 2:50:59.240]  nonviolent here and do not call for violence because the system wants to
[2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:04.680]  set us up say no to government vaccinations say no to toxic overload

[2:54:12.640 --> 2:54:19.560]  okay at the end of the show I'm gonna have Aaron in with his article at info
[2:54:19.560 --> 2:54:24.520]  awards.com to break this down but but Aaron just corrected me on the MPR
[2:54:24.520 --> 2:54:30.320]  piece they admit this federal informant who set up the guys who never
[2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:34.160]  carried out a firebombing with Molov cocktails and the reports are he was
[2:54:34.160 --> 2:54:36.760]  you know telling him let's do it let's do it you know let's stand up to these
[2:54:36.760 --> 2:54:42.080]  people he comes out of New Orleans just like Lee Harvey Oswald he's in Texas in
[2:54:42.080 --> 2:54:47.280]  Austin he then is involved in brave new books he's involved with these different
[2:54:47.280 --> 2:54:50.520]  organizations and the Palestinian guy that got brutally murdered and they
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:55.000]  said was a suicide you corrected me on the MPR piece they admit he had
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:55:01.800]  infiltrated that he was a professor so I mean I'm going from memory on all this
[2:55:01.800 --> 2:55:05.000]  because this happened a year ago but Aaron yeah it's a little convoluted but
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:09.240]  in the MPR story they make it sound nice and friendly and they claim that this
[2:55:09.240 --> 2:55:14.320]  Riyadh Ahmad and his associates somehow were the terrorists and what that may or
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:18.040]  may not be based on I have no idea and they claim that he was the informant
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:22.360]  trying to bust that up and that they were trying to recruit this FBI informant
[2:55:22.360 --> 2:55:26.240]  it was probably backwards yeah but why would this FBI inform it because there's
[2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:29.640]  other eyewitnesses stepping forward why would he be trying to get locals to
[2:55:29.640 --> 2:55:34.160]  firebomb brave new books it's bizarre and the MPR piece makes no mention of the
[2:55:34.160 --> 2:55:38.640]  fact that this Riyadh Ahmad was found gagged in duct tape at the bottom of the
[2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:42.960]  lake here in Austin they called it a suicide and separately this anarchist
[2:55:42.960 --> 2:55:47.240]  witness Scott Crowe was you know I talked to his mask they called me they
[2:55:47.240 --> 2:55:51.560]  said he was gutted open sliced open tortured all his friends and associates
[2:55:51.560 --> 2:55:55.360]  believe he was murdered which seems that he'd been tortured even cut up like a
[2:55:55.360 --> 2:56:00.240]  hog but separately the anarchists was introduced by this admitted FBI informant
[2:56:00.240 --> 2:56:04.040]  and he was told these are real revolutionaries Riyadh Ahmad and his
[2:56:04.040 --> 2:56:09.040]  associates are really gonna get things done unlike the liberal anarchists so he
[2:56:09.040 --> 2:56:13.600]  was trying to provoke a tour obviously multiple groups a court you know if you
[2:56:13.600 --> 2:56:17.200]  correlate the reports anybody that walks up to you at events and says let's
[2:56:17.200 --> 2:56:21.840]  let's really blow some stuff up they're a fed and you should pull out a camera go
[2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:25.560]  to their car put it on YouTube you everybody should carry a camera just
[2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:30.080]  start videotaping them if small video cameras now put it on the web and call
[2:56:30.080 --> 2:56:33.080]  the police on them that's what I did because remember we had him showing up
[2:56:33.080 --> 2:56:36.800]  at the door going I worked at the governor's mansion I have inside stuff
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:39.800]  they're gonna say I did it how else what do you think of what I what happened
[2:56:39.800 --> 2:56:43.360]  and then other people showing up and then stuff about then I got a police
[2:56:43.360 --> 2:56:46.520]  source going yeah no no no there's informants involved with all of this
[2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:50.360]  and fire bombings planned in Austin and they're planning to set you up and
[2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:54.800]  that's why I went call the police I said uh-huh saying not doing that to me
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:58.520]  remember when the BATF was here yeah that's freaky stuff I mean I didn't even
[2:56:58.520 --> 2:57:02.320]  talk about that on air because people can't believe this secret service FBI
[2:57:02.320 --> 2:57:06.320]  minutes a routine occurrence here yeah and lover hate what the anarchists are
[2:57:06.320 --> 2:57:10.600]  doing they said for six years this was the only guy talking violence he was
[2:57:10.600 --> 2:57:14.560]  always the one trying to provocateur violence all the way back to whatever
[2:57:14.560 --> 2:57:17.960]  they were doing six years ago well let me tell you this governor's mansion
[2:57:17.960 --> 2:57:23.600]  thing and in the way that for 15 minutes the ambulances in the firetruck
[2:57:23.600 --> 2:57:28.440]  stood down and then how they claim they don't have any footage of it and then I
[2:57:28.440 --> 2:57:33.280]  went and talked to eyewitnesses down there who saw all sorts of suspicious
[2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:38.680]  stuff it's bizarre and then the stuff happens up at the RNC and it turns out
[2:57:38.680 --> 2:57:42.960]  he was just provocaturing some some entry-level anarchists called them
[2:57:42.960 --> 2:57:46.480]  weaklings and said they couldn't get the job done and that's what go to the
[2:57:46.480 --> 2:57:49.120]  monster yeah it's on record you're weaklings you're weaklings if I they
[2:57:49.120 --> 2:57:52.880]  said okay boom they had him for the conspiracy but they didn't show up that
[2:57:52.880 --> 2:57:56.280]  morning when the feds were waiting with the bottle bombs then he provocateur
[2:57:56.280 --> 2:57:59.800]  them again said are you really gonna do this and and that's what led to it he
[2:57:59.800 --> 2:58:04.160]  provocateur the whole thing if you could believe these accounts it's just and
[2:58:04.160 --> 2:58:08.200]  he's been evidently all over awesome I could hardly watch videos of him that
[2:58:08.200 --> 2:58:13.400]  you have linked in the article he looks so slimy so it's just I can't even look
[2:58:13.400 --> 2:58:18.480]  at the guy yeah I mean this is a Judas and he was all over New Orleans with the
[2:58:18.480 --> 2:58:22.520]  hurricane relief effort he was just infiltrating all these groups throughout
[2:58:22.520 --> 2:58:27.280]  Texas and Louisiana and and there's claims he was down in Venezuela
[2:58:27.280 --> 2:58:32.280]  meeting with FARC rebel leaders who want to set up a hot war guerrilla oh yeah
[2:58:32.280 --> 2:58:36.100]  this guy's got CIA written all over him doesn't he oh it's insane but he's the
[2:58:36.100 --> 2:58:40.400]  type they'll burn don't worry he'll get what he wants

[3:00:10.760 --> 3:00:16.440]  all right now I'm going to your call Solomon PJ Mark Jim Kathy and others I'm
[3:00:16.440 --> 3:00:21.240]  gonna give you the latest on climate gay giant developments there but Solomon in
[3:00:21.240 --> 3:00:26.440]  Connecticut you're on the air go ahead hey Alex how's it going I just want to
[3:00:26.440 --> 3:00:31.520]  say that God is watching over you man all the stuff that happens to you and so
[3:00:31.520 --> 3:00:36.640]  I'm just gonna get right into my points I even though they're passing all this
[3:00:36.640 --> 3:00:40.960]  this Copenhagen stuff and everything that's going on I just wanted to say
[3:00:40.960 --> 3:00:44.960]  something to the audience it's just like even though these pieces of paper are
[3:00:44.960 --> 3:00:49.400]  being signed compliance is an option it's whether or not we want to stand up and
[3:00:49.400 --> 3:00:54.360]  this is just making me so sick that these people are going around it and
[3:00:54.360 --> 3:00:58.920]  colluding and and then Al Gore going around I'm sorry I'm just getting so
[3:00:58.920 --> 3:01:04.320]  upset but people can't fight the New World Order because they fear themselves so
[3:01:04.320 --> 3:01:09.160]  I think that we're reaching a very spiritual time in our society where we
[3:01:09.160 --> 3:01:12.400]  have to go inside of ourselves and gather the strength that we need to fight
[3:01:12.400 --> 3:01:15.760]  these people because they have no strength inside themselves I mean look
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:19.080]  at them look at Rockefeller look at all these people look at Al Gore they're
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:23.920]  just fat you know self-hating people that just want to prove to themselves that
[3:01:23.920 --> 3:01:27.840]  they can run the world and if you ran up to these people in the streets they'd
[3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:32.160]  be so scared they'd be shaking in their boots so I just really want to go out
[3:01:32.160 --> 3:01:36.840]  there that is what you've got a bunch of imbred degenerate murdering control
[3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:42.360]  freaks that we just let roll over us because they're the authorities yeah it's
[3:01:42.360 --> 3:01:47.800]  it's it's crazy because the people people look at them as if they have some
[3:01:47.800 --> 3:01:52.000]  knowledge that we don't or some kind of something that we don't and and I see
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:54.880]  so many people day after day they're trying to wake up it's just they're
[3:01:54.880 --> 3:01:58.800]  scared they're scared to be themselves they're scared to go out there and tell
[3:01:58.800 --> 3:02:02.000]  everybody else what they know or what they feel about the New World Order or
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  about the Copenhagen agreement or about climate gave me in a fraud they're
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:10.720]  scared of themselves so I think that the important message is they're not going
[3:02:10.720 --> 3:02:15.680]  to win because God bless you God bless you great points Solomon thank you for
[3:02:15.680 --> 3:02:20.760]  holding PJ in the UK go ahead good evening Alex thank you very much for
[3:02:20.760 --> 3:02:23.680]  your interview at Moncton that was first-class radio thank you very much
[3:02:23.680 --> 3:02:28.080]  indeed three quick points and just the BBC are cranking up the world at the
[3:02:28.080 --> 3:02:32.240]  global warming programs today just come out on the BBC one o'clock at six o'clock
[3:02:32.240 --> 3:02:36.720]  David Shuckman their environment Shucksman and Dr. Nicky Pope the head of
[3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:40.360]  the Met of the Met Office the Weather Office saying the last ten years have
[3:02:40.360 --> 3:02:45.680]  been the warmest in history but it's admittedly a fraud CNN every channel is
[3:02:45.680 --> 3:02:49.160]  wall-to-wall into the world if we don't pass this
[3:02:49.160 --> 3:02:54.120]  mm-hmm absolutely I'm just making these points quickly but I just so your people
[3:02:54.120 --> 3:03:00.400]  will pick that up I sent you an email on us early long but the AMPR cameras we've
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:04.080]  had those here for two years tell you how sophisticated they are now police
[3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:08.240]  motorbikes can have them traffic police cars have them stationary points on
[3:03:08.240 --> 3:03:11.760]  traffic lights can have them on the London congestion charge if you don't pay
[3:03:11.760 --> 3:03:15.880]  the daily eight or twelve pounds charge within 24 hours at an electronic pay
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:20.120]  point you get the fine in the post 80 pounds so it'll get to that level of
[3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:24.000]  sophistication which is what you said they're very emotionally after that our
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:28.440]  with Lord Moncton surely the entire Patriot radio movements and newspapers
[3:03:28.440 --> 3:03:32.640]  that should get together for 10 days now and just concentrate on this co-op and
[3:03:32.640 --> 3:03:36.000]  haggle thing that's sure I'm just putting up a suggestion for those that
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:40.080]  don't know that's what I'd read it was as much as 12 pounds just to come in and
[3:03:40.080 --> 3:03:43.400]  out of the city and then now it's they're starting to put it nationwide
[3:03:43.400 --> 3:03:48.040]  Oregon California getting ready they're getting ready here to turn all the roads
[3:03:48.040 --> 3:03:53.040]  into toll roads off license plate readers this is so hellish and it tracks
[3:03:53.040 --> 3:04:00.120]  everywhere you go the big supermarkets have a NPR capability as well in case
[3:04:00.120 --> 3:04:03.480]  you drive out and don't pay for petrol they're connected to the DVS the
[3:04:03.480 --> 3:04:07.200]  National Registration Bureau and they can pick your address and get you for
[3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:11.280]  that as well if you get here they're not telling the public people just I've
[3:04:11.280 --> 3:04:15.120]  been in cars they go I wonder how it comes in the mail when you drive under
[3:04:15.120 --> 3:04:19.760]  the the camera it's it's it's reading your license plate ladies and gentlemen
[3:04:19.760 --> 3:04:26.840]  it's a Pentagon control grid yes sir apps absolutely but one other quick
[3:04:26.840 --> 3:04:29.960]  point I know it's another program you introduced Nigel Farage I worked with
[3:04:29.960 --> 3:04:33.680]  Nigel for years in short sharp very fantastic speeches are on YouTube but
[3:04:33.680 --> 3:04:37.440]  20 of them they're well worth hearing on no no we want Nigel Farage on we're
[3:04:37.440 --> 3:04:40.720]  trying to get him back how's that going with the British member of the European
[3:04:40.720 --> 3:04:44.760]  Parliament oh he's knocking hell out of them but I'll send you another email
[3:04:44.760 --> 3:04:49.400]  he does not pick him up he'll come on but I'll send you his contact yeah he's the
[3:04:49.400 --> 3:04:54.240]  head of the what's the name of the party the UK independence party yeah the head
[3:04:54.240 --> 3:04:57.560]  of the UK independence party stay there I want you to finish your point we get
[3:04:57.560 --> 3:05:03.960]  back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[3:05:03.960 --> 3:05:08.320]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[3:05:08.320 --> 3:05:12.480]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[3:05:12.480 --> 3:05:16.480]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total

[3:10:14.520 --> 3:10:21.080]  in Oregon mark you're on the air morning Alex hey buddy Alex you know I have to
[3:10:21.080 --> 3:10:26.720]  second saw second Solomon there you're your first caller I think as far as
[3:10:26.720 --> 3:10:34.760]  God's protecting you you know like 24-7 I I know that he is number one because
[3:10:34.760 --> 3:10:39.800]  you're one of the foremost truth tellers on a global level on this planet you're
[3:10:39.800 --> 3:10:45.640]  very important to him he's using you as a tool and I think you realize that and
[3:10:45.640 --> 3:10:49.280]  he's going to protect you because you pray for yourself when you have other
[3:10:49.280 --> 3:10:52.120]  people praying for you and because he would protect you anyway because he
[3:10:52.120 --> 3:10:56.320]  made you to be in the role that you're in and he's not going to let evil have
[3:10:56.320 --> 3:11:00.040]  the upper hand on you because if God hadn't been protecting you Alex you
[3:11:00.040 --> 3:11:03.680]  wouldn't even have gotten near this far and I know it's hard to see it when
[3:11:03.680 --> 3:11:07.480]  these these dark birds come circling down close around you and you can see
[3:11:07.480 --> 3:11:11.640]  them but they're doing it just for that reason to scare you and put fear in you
[3:11:11.640 --> 3:11:15.920]  but they can't do anything to you now for their own reasons but as I
[3:11:15.920 --> 3:11:19.880]  mentioned to you before it just happens to be the way that God protects you is
[3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:25.280]  the whole situation in total relative to them they just it's not the right time
[3:11:25.280 --> 3:11:29.040]  and it never will be the right time but God will let you know if there's ever a
[3:11:29.040 --> 3:11:34.200]  time to flee for your safety and you just pray for him to do that for you and
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:37.960]  he will do that and you can take heart in that you can live on from the present
[3:11:37.960 --> 3:11:42.480]  to the future and this tremendous role that you've done yeah what the New World
[3:11:42.480 --> 3:11:49.160]  Order is trying to do to Alex Jones is lie about me destroy my name from the
[3:11:49.160 --> 3:11:53.360]  mainstream media the alternative media take what I've said and done out of
[3:11:53.360 --> 3:11:57.720]  context but it doesn't matter because I'm just getting the info out for the
[3:11:57.720 --> 3:12:01.360]  people to stand up and be leaders in their own right and so that's what we're
[3:12:01.360 --> 3:12:06.840]  doing but it's you know when I see the Denver police in the Denver Post admitting
[3:12:06.840 --> 3:12:10.720]  they dressed up like anarchist and attacked other officers to demonize
[3:12:10.720 --> 3:12:16.280]  the peaceful protest so they could attack peaceful people and when I see it in
[3:12:16.280 --> 3:12:20.480]  Seattle and I see it in Genoa Italy and I see it at the G20 when they killed a
[3:12:20.480 --> 3:12:26.960]  guy just delivering newspapers and then lied about it and when I see at the SPP
[3:12:26.960 --> 3:12:30.760]  meeting last year police caught dressed up like anarchists attacking other
[3:12:30.760 --> 3:12:37.240]  officers how do they get the police to be so evil and to carry out false flag
[3:12:37.240 --> 3:12:42.640]  attacks I mean it's in the Denver Post that police dressed up like anarchist
[3:12:42.640 --> 3:12:46.720]  and attacked other police for news cameras it's in the Seattle Post
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:50.360]  intelligence sir that that happened in 99 and they hired anarchist they brought
[3:12:50.360 --> 3:12:56.680]  in it was in the major Canadian papers that the police dressed up like anarchist
[3:12:56.680 --> 3:13:00.240]  and the people noticed their boots were all the same and that the police stage
[3:13:00.240 --> 3:13:04.320]  their arrest and then the Royal Mount of Police had to admit they staged that and
[3:13:04.320 --> 3:13:10.000]  to just know that they're staging events provocaturing events setting
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:17.600]  people up lying about it I mean I remember just a few years ago Texas
[3:13:17.600 --> 3:13:22.920]  Monthly who's here by the way and the reporter that I interviewed where an
[3:13:22.920 --> 3:13:27.720]  informant went and set up 50-something innocent people just to put them in a
[3:13:27.720 --> 3:13:32.200]  private prison and made up that they had drugs and in Dallas the police
[3:13:32.200 --> 3:13:35.680]  admittedly just pull you over throw back a chalk in your car and confiscate it
[3:13:35.680 --> 3:13:40.600]  and those are just cases that are happening right around me I mean how did
[3:13:40.600 --> 3:13:45.520]  they ever get the government so criminal how did they ever get so many people to
[3:13:45.520 --> 3:13:48.760]  be part of the government and to go out and commit these type of crimes I mean
[3:13:48.760 --> 3:13:54.000]  these were like old black people in Tulia Texas in many cases with no criminal
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:58.400]  record who done nothing wrong and they just put them in the local prison they
[3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:01.840]  built the prison in Tulia they had to put somebody in it so they just set them
[3:14:01.840 --> 3:14:06.720]  up and you know to see the way these informants set up the two young
[3:14:06.720 --> 3:14:11.880]  anarchists from Austin to try to fire bomb up in Minnesota same deal I
[3:14:11.880 --> 3:14:15.480]  appreciate your call mark let's talk to Jim in New York Jim you're on the air
[3:14:15.480 --> 3:14:22.760]  go ahead yes hi Alex as is my habit every day I go through info is calm to
[3:14:22.760 --> 3:14:27.760]  get my news and there's an article I don't know if you've got a chance to look
[3:14:27.760 --> 3:14:33.960]  at the cap and traders go with sacks and then run scam and the woman in the
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:39.160]  YouTube and I'm sure you'll agree with me she she's I seems to have part of it
[3:14:39.160 --> 3:14:44.320]  right in my opinion but then she goes on to say how carbon dioxide is poison
[3:14:44.320 --> 3:14:49.360]  blah blah blah and the YouTube and my fear is that people that are new to the
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:53.560]  site that haven't followed this might you may want to look at it I don't know
[3:14:53.560 --> 3:14:59.040]  posted it but in any event they make it the wrong idea because I know your
[3:14:59.040 --> 3:15:04.160]  position I you know I went to school I learned that carbon dioxide you needed
[3:15:04.160 --> 3:15:08.880]  this for plants and to hope it's all baloney you know whether it be you know
[3:15:08.880 --> 3:15:14.200]  it's this whole thing is just one big scam whether it be health insurance the
[3:15:14.200 --> 3:15:18.960]  industrial military complex in Afghanistan or this global warming they're
[3:15:18.960 --> 3:15:23.280]  putting money in their pockets as you aptly say you know bunch of gangsters and
[3:15:23.280 --> 3:15:28.320]  they use different pretext to do it but I wouldn't want anybody miss be
[3:15:28.320 --> 3:15:31.800]  misled yeah I haven't seen the video we're talking about you know we post
[3:15:31.800 --> 3:15:37.040]  hundreds of things a day on info wars on prison planet links to articles links to
[3:15:37.040 --> 3:15:41.520]  videos so I haven't seen it and I can't comment we post a lot of stuff on there
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:45.400]  we don't even agree with you know when mankind moon wrote an editorial for the
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:49.440]  New York Times the secretary general of the UN three weeks ago calling for
[3:15:49.440 --> 3:15:53.360]  global government and saying that the carbon tax would fund the establishment
[3:15:53.360 --> 3:15:57.960]  of world government I I mean I linked to that article it doesn't mean I agree
[3:15:57.960 --> 3:16:04.400]  with mankind moon you know I'm against global government at the same time we
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:09.720]  linked to Herman von Rompuy the new head of the EU saying carbon tax is the key
[3:16:09.720 --> 3:16:12.720]  to the world government and we don't agree with him but I haven't seen this
[3:16:12.720 --> 3:16:18.240]  video but I'll check into it anything else Jim yes just quickly you have like
[3:16:18.240 --> 3:16:22.960]  things posted by poor Watson when I see that I know it's good you know that it's
[3:16:22.960 --> 3:16:28.000]  not something out of the mainstream you know this thing is like so iffy you take
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:32.280]  a look at it see for yourself what your opinion maybe maybe I'm wrong I don't know
[3:16:32.280 --> 3:16:37.920]  but she goes on to say any Linda name is and she goes on to say about this
[3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:43.240]  business about you know the carbon dioxide now dangerous she just doesn't
[3:16:43.240 --> 3:16:47.480]  agree with the cap and trade approach with Goldman Sachs and Enron you know
[3:16:47.480 --> 3:16:51.640]  which is which is all good no I hear you I'm all I look into it I appreciate the
[3:16:51.640 --> 3:16:55.080]  call Kathy and Indiana Kathy you're on the air go ahead
[3:16:55.080 --> 3:17:03.080]  hello hi hi yes I just wanted to make a comment on climate gate and I noticed she
[3:17:03.080 --> 3:17:06.960]  was talking about climate control it's not climate control it's climate gate
[3:17:06.960 --> 3:17:12.040]  and what they do is they take sales through there and they mask the sales
[3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:16.560]  with a bunch of information about molecules and it goes through a
[3:17:16.560 --> 3:17:21.360]  publishing company it's like book search and it's like Jennifer Mueller and she
[3:17:21.360 --> 3:17:25.040]  does a lot of things like that but they still millions of dollars and they
[3:17:25.040 --> 3:17:28.440]  manipulate all this stuff and it goes with all the other stuff you guys are
[3:17:28.440 --> 3:17:32.960]  talking about and it goes against Jesus and I know that the Lord told me how much
[3:17:32.960 --> 3:17:37.120]  they hurt him and he told me that they they've done all this stuff and I thank
[3:17:37.120 --> 3:17:41.200]  you Kathy I appreciate your call Dan in New Mexico you're on the air Dan go
[3:17:41.200 --> 3:17:46.720]  ahead hey Alex want to make a quick point that you know if carbon is so bad
[3:17:46.720 --> 3:17:51.840]  then why is it that the vegetation off each side of the highway is bigger than
[3:17:51.840 --> 3:17:55.200]  the rest of the vegetation out the rest of the desert you know what I'm talking
[3:17:55.200 --> 3:18:01.400]  about yes they've done studies thousands of them that plants grow faster live
[3:18:01.400 --> 3:18:07.600]  longer need less water when they have higher levels of carbon dioxide and from
[3:18:07.600 --> 3:18:11.840]  the ice core and also mud core out of the bottoms of deep lakes going back
[3:18:11.840 --> 3:18:19.640]  hundreds of thousands of years they know that carbon dioxide has been 20 times
[3:18:19.640 --> 3:18:24.040]  higher than it is now in our atmosphere there's a tiny amount of carbon dioxide
[3:18:24.040 --> 3:18:29.880]  and and all the science shows it's better when there's more unfortunately the
[3:18:29.880 --> 3:18:34.560]  small amount mainly the oceans are what are are exchanging carbon dioxide
[3:18:34.560 --> 3:18:38.280]  according to all the science the small amount that humans put out really has
[3:18:38.280 --> 3:18:42.880]  no effect either way and that the planet is carbon dioxide starved right now
[3:18:42.880 --> 3:18:49.920]  compared to other periods that have transpired over the millions of years on
[3:18:49.920 --> 3:18:55.360]  this planet the UN admits they picked carbon dioxide because they can then put
[3:18:55.360 --> 3:19:00.000]  a tax on all human activity the average human exhales five and a half pounds of
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:05.160]  carbon dioxide a day all industry puts off carbon dioxide and so they can
[3:19:05.160 --> 3:19:10.120]  confuse that with other real pollution and put a tax on it and the EPA is now
[3:19:10.120 --> 3:19:13.920]  announced they're going to list it as a toxic waste to be regulated and taxed
[3:19:13.920 --> 3:19:18.120]  and controlled and Maury strong at the United Nations is on record saying they
[3:19:18.120 --> 3:19:23.280]  want this to shut down industrial society yeah and you know that my wife
[3:19:23.280 --> 3:19:28.200]  brought a very good point if they somehow are able to effectively control
[3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:33.600]  carbon dioxide that's going to kill off the rainforest a little bit faster than
[3:19:33.600 --> 3:19:39.160]  man would admit well look they picked it because it's part of the life cycle
[3:19:39.160 --> 3:19:45.240]  sunlight water carbon dioxide oxygen is what the planet operates off of without
[3:19:45.240 --> 3:19:49.560]  any of those ingredients you miss one of those you have no life on this planet
[3:19:49.560 --> 3:19:54.960]  you've got to have those four things in abundance and they're putting a tax on

[3:24:38.120 --> 3:24:42.280]  lot of it with mocked in but not all of it on a recap a bunch of it that is
[3:24:42.280 --> 3:24:48.320]  coming up right now let's who's up next John Dennis and Indiana Dennis you're
[3:24:48.320 --> 3:24:52.520]  on the air thanks for holding thank you Alex I wanted to compliment you on a
[3:24:52.520 --> 3:24:56.640]  great job I called in part of the control grid I live in Bloomington
[3:24:56.640 --> 3:25:00.360]  Indiana which I don't mind giving my city because my local paper the Herald
[3:25:00.360 --> 3:25:05.960]  Times has put up a database on concealed carry holders yes they do that as a
[3:25:05.960 --> 3:25:10.360]  form of harassment and to set the precedent newspapers all over the
[3:25:10.360 --> 3:25:15.520]  country published concealed carry owners as a form of harassment it's it's
[3:25:15.520 --> 3:25:20.160]  horrible yeah if you I don't know if you guys have built it and put it up but
[3:25:20.160 --> 3:25:24.000]  it's the Herald Times in Bloomington is there any way I'm familiar with
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:28.840]  newspapers I mean just Google right now the term newspapers published concealed
[3:25:28.840 --> 3:25:36.320]  carry owners I mean just just just it's I've seen it hundreds of times Wow so
[3:25:36.320 --> 3:25:39.800]  unfortunately this is happening all over I mean the ratchet and the big stuff
[3:25:39.800 --> 3:25:45.680]  on us and from the grassroots up I mean it's terrible yeah let me tell the guys
[3:25:45.680 --> 3:25:50.800]  the right search term it's it's it's newspapers published names of concealed
[3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:57.240]  firearm permit owners the newspapers publish identities of gun owners
[3:25:57.240 --> 3:26:01.360]  something like that and you'll get thousands and thousands here it is
[3:26:01.360 --> 3:26:06.720]  Tennessee newspaper publishes concealed gun permit list then it just goes on and
[3:26:06.720 --> 3:26:15.080]  on and on and on 51,000 hits 51,400 hits when you do that yes it's it's horrible
[3:26:15.080 --> 3:26:19.400]  sir okay yeah I just wanted to thank you and pass that information on you Alex
[3:26:19.400 --> 3:26:24.960]  keep up thank you so much Dennis let's talk to Michael and Mass Michael you're
[3:26:24.960 --> 3:26:32.120]  on the air hey I was going Alex hey buddy I could have got a time I wanted to
[3:26:32.120 --> 3:26:37.240]  say but on a lighter note have you seen the show family guy before that's a
[3:26:37.240 --> 3:26:41.040]  cartoon isn't it yeah tell me Lord Moncton doesn't look like the character
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:48.360]  Stewie kick out of it now but I like him but I'd like to talk about words and
[3:26:48.360 --> 3:26:53.960]  terms and understanding the language because I know you say it a million
[3:26:53.960 --> 3:26:57.440]  times so people just don't get it a lot of time these people aren't lying
[3:26:57.440 --> 3:27:03.680]  they're not putting out misleading information it's just you don't speak
[3:27:03.680 --> 3:27:09.720]  English anymore and I'll go through it right so last year in October 2008 the
[3:27:09.720 --> 3:27:14.120]  government passed what they called a bailout of the banking industry right
[3:27:14.120 --> 3:27:18.760]  now from where does someone generally get bailed out from prison for criminal
[3:27:18.760 --> 3:27:22.840]  activity so if you really understood the language you would have looked at that
[3:27:22.840 --> 3:27:27.200]  and you would want well wait a minute this is completely inappropriate for
[3:27:27.200 --> 3:27:30.840]  the government to be bailing out the bankers you know they're telling us but
[3:27:30.840 --> 3:27:34.600]  it's worse than that it was a lie they gave them dictatorial power to steal
[3:27:34.600 --> 3:27:39.160]  trillions not 700 billion day one they baited and switched and said oh it's
[3:27:39.160 --> 3:27:43.240]  gonna be to unfreeze mortgages and then October 4th the day after they passed it
[3:27:43.240 --> 3:27:46.560]  they said oh we're not gonna tell you where the money's going now we're not
[3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:52.000]  gonna use it for mortgages and then Paulson sits up there the former head
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:55.840]  of Goldman Sachs and says yes I gave myself money from the bailout I'm
[3:27:55.840 --> 3:28:01.160]  allowed to I got a waiver and the senator goes as it was it was actually
[3:28:01.160 --> 3:28:06.680]  Congressman Stern of Florida says and who gave you the waiver it's in my film
[3:28:06.680 --> 3:28:12.240]  fall the Republic and he says oh the Treasury Department I gave myself a
[3:28:12.240 --> 3:28:17.120]  waiver I'm sorry go ahead I was just gonna say if the people actually
[3:28:17.120 --> 3:28:20.720]  understood the English language when they saw that you know in the headlines
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:24.320]  they would probably thought the exact same thing you thought of but you know
[3:28:24.320 --> 3:28:28.720]  like I tell people this story about you know words and terms and as soon as you
[3:28:28.720 --> 3:28:33.440]  explain it to let go well I didn't see it that way and I have to I basically have
[3:28:33.440 --> 3:28:37.080]  to say well it's because you really don't speak English anymore I mean I don't
[3:28:37.080 --> 3:28:41.160]  know what it is in 1984 if you of course you'll remember but for the
[3:28:41.160 --> 3:28:45.320]  listeners I mean what was it that there was that guy whose job it was to
[3:28:45.320 --> 3:28:49.880]  destroy the language until it was quote perfect I mean perfect according to
[3:28:49.880 --> 3:28:54.080]  who yeah that was according to that was new speak it was called new speak and it
[3:28:54.080 --> 3:28:59.240]  was in stock double plus good and they were reducing the language down so it
[3:28:59.240 --> 3:29:03.360]  would be impossible to even have a thought because from birth you would be
[3:29:03.360 --> 3:29:09.200]  given limited language so their job was to destroy the language and to boil it
[3:29:09.200 --> 3:29:14.560]  down to nothing freedom of speech imagine not being capable of speaking in the
[3:29:14.560 --> 3:29:20.560]  first place I mean they love to have that kind of situation right I don't
[3:29:20.560 --> 3:29:26.680]  know it just it just it just blows me away like immediate right people people
[3:29:26.680 --> 3:29:30.960]  talk about you know reality and what that they think is potentially real and
[3:29:30.960 --> 3:29:34.600]  you know I constantly tell people you know you don't even have to lie to the
[3:29:34.600 --> 3:29:37.600]  people anymore you know if you have control over all the information they
[3:29:37.600 --> 3:29:42.120]  get you just have to omit important details you know yeah they lie a lot by
[3:29:42.120 --> 3:29:46.720]  omission but also by spin and just flat out lying like saying polar bears are
[3:29:46.720 --> 3:29:50.920]  all dying and can't swim their numbers are exploding with the best land swimmer

[3:34:44.720 --> 3:34:51.640]  is definitely a show that everyone is going to want to hear and see this is so
[3:34:51.640 --> 3:34:56.320]  important the fight that we're facing right now as a society global
[3:34:56.320 --> 3:35:04.960]  government is here global government is now upon us and you know what I have a
[3:35:04.960 --> 3:35:11.320]  Texas monthly reporter here we've actually interviewed before I don't know
[3:35:11.320 --> 3:35:13.520]  if in the interview I'm going to argue with him about a world government
[3:35:13.520 --> 3:35:17.040]  existing or not maybe I should play for him when I played for the magazine
[3:35:17.040 --> 3:35:21.040]  reporter that was here yesterday clips of Al Gore clips of the UN had clips of
[3:35:21.040 --> 3:35:24.480]  the EU had clips of other bureaucrats calling for global government and
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:30.680]  saying Copenhagen is the funding mechanism for all of this they say
[3:35:30.680 --> 3:35:34.240]  they're here doing a profile so I guess that's not what this is about it's just
[3:35:34.240 --> 3:35:37.600]  that I'm tired of being called a conspiracy theorist when all we're doing
[3:35:37.600 --> 3:35:43.360]  is reading the documents and covering the facts here on air now a powerful
[3:35:43.360 --> 3:35:46.800]  article and we're going to contact him and get him on Gerald Warner writer for
[3:35:46.800 --> 3:35:53.760]  the London Telegraph powerful article climategate Morocco Obama's rule by EPA
[3:35:53.760 --> 3:35:58.800]  decree is a coup d'etat against Congress made in Britain and they talk
[3:35:58.800 --> 3:36:02.880]  about how the same systems in Britain and the EU are used to bypass
[3:36:02.880 --> 3:36:08.400]  parliaments and the elected legislatures the EPA now announcing they're going to
[3:36:08.400 --> 3:36:18.080]  list carbon dioxide that plants breathe as a toxic waste who needs tanks on the
[3:36:18.080 --> 3:36:20.480]  lawn when you have the environmental protection agency
[3:36:20.480 --> 3:36:26.240]  Barack Obama's use of the EPA to pressure the Senate to pass his climate
[3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:31.040]  change Nuremberg decrees shows his dictatorial mentality he wants to
[3:36:31.040 --> 3:36:34.880]  override Congress which is hostile to the climate
[3:36:34.880 --> 3:36:38.960]  gobbledygook because it's representative of the American electric
[3:36:38.960 --> 3:36:42.640]  and sideline the nation's elected senators by ruling by decree
[3:36:42.640 --> 3:36:46.880]  courtesy of the EPA this is a coup d'etat that's what i've been calling it
[3:36:46.880 --> 3:36:53.360]  for the last year this is a bloodless coup by the global governing ruling class
[3:36:53.360 --> 3:36:59.040]  against the population period that's what's happening
[3:36:59.040 --> 3:37:03.520]  that's what's going on now
[3:37:06.160 --> 3:37:10.240]  continuing to expand on this the biggest news of the day was Lord
[3:37:10.240 --> 3:37:15.200]  Moncton going to the united nations in Copenhagen and threatening them
[3:37:15.200 --> 3:37:18.720]  with the house of lords inquiry if they didn't give him the latest version of
[3:37:18.720 --> 3:37:23.600]  the Copenhagen treaty which was secret the bureaucrats buckled and gave it to
[3:37:23.600 --> 3:37:26.560]  him it has taxes on transportation a global
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:30.240]  authority over air travel a global tax on
[3:37:30.240 --> 3:37:37.920]  financial transactions this is total control 700 plus new bureaucracies
[3:37:37.920 --> 3:37:46.400]  not agents 700 new bureaucracies over every facet of our lives
[3:37:46.400 --> 3:37:50.560]  and on top of that now we have this
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:37:56.800]  london guardian story Copenhagen climate summit in disarray
[3:37:56.800 --> 3:38:01.280]  after danish tax leak now this is nothing new
[3:38:01.280 --> 3:38:05.120]  for our listeners this information is nothing for you it's all covered and
[3:38:05.120 --> 3:38:09.120]  follow the republic in detail because we have their own documents but
[3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:13.280]  the u n had lied to the third world and told them hey we're going to loot
[3:38:13.280 --> 3:38:17.200]  america and england and europe and japan for you you don't have to make any
[3:38:17.200 --> 3:38:21.360]  carbon cuts we're going to loot them and we're going to
[3:38:21.360 --> 3:38:27.040]  give all of that money to you totally made up this is the same
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:31.120]  imf and world bank whose documents got leaked in 2002
[3:38:31.120 --> 3:38:34.160]  joseph sticklets resigned and went public and exposed it
[3:38:34.160 --> 3:38:38.080]  nobel prize-winning economist how they go into countries and pay them at 30
[3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:41.440]  percent loan sharking rates not to pay the debts back
[3:38:41.440 --> 3:38:45.200]  to hand over the entire infrastructures of their countries to the imf and world
[3:38:45.200 --> 3:38:48.880]  bank so imagine their horror when they saw the
[3:38:48.880 --> 3:38:53.920]  new addendum to the secret treaty today leaked
[3:38:53.920 --> 3:38:58.800]  now listen to this developing countries react furiously to leak draft agreement
[3:38:58.800 --> 3:39:02.400]  that would hand more power to rich nations it's not the rich nations it's the
[3:39:02.400 --> 3:39:06.320]  bank sitting in our nations sidelined the un's negotiating role
[3:39:06.320 --> 3:39:11.440]  and abandoned the coyote protocol see this is going to be selective taxes on
[3:39:11.440 --> 3:39:15.120]  the west freezing development in the third world
[3:39:15.120 --> 3:39:19.600]  and paying the money it says the imf world bank and private banking subsidiaries

[3:39:55.040 --> 3:40:01.040]  for yourself the un kopenhagen climate talks are in
[3:40:01.040 --> 3:40:04.560]  disarray today after developing countries reacted furiously to leak documents
[3:40:04.560 --> 3:40:09.840]  that show that world leaders will next week be asked
[3:40:09.840 --> 3:40:13.920]  to sign an agreement that hands over power to rich countries and sidelines the
[3:40:13.920 --> 3:40:17.040]  un role in all future climate change
[3:40:17.040 --> 3:40:21.280]  negotiations the document is also being interpreted by
[3:40:21.280 --> 3:40:24.640]  developing countries is setting unequal limits on per capita carbon
[3:40:24.640 --> 3:40:27.920]  emissions for developed and developing countries
[3:40:27.920 --> 3:40:30.960]  meaning that people in rich countries will be permitted to emit nearly twice as
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:34.400]  much under the proposals what does this eugenesis
[3:40:34.400 --> 3:40:39.600]  documents say from 1977 written by john p
[3:40:39.600 --> 3:40:44.640]  holdren what does the club of rome 1991 say it is just what is the royal
[3:40:44.640 --> 3:40:48.640]  commission out of england say what does state department random 200 and by
[3:40:48.640 --> 3:40:53.680]  kissinger say they are going to shut down the carbon
[3:40:53.680 --> 3:40:57.920]  footprint of the third world for eugenics queue up
[3:40:57.920 --> 3:41:02.560]  the burlin film festival winning video that shows humans as parasites
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:06.640]  they stayed in here that they want a population reduction of at least 80
[3:41:06.640 --> 3:41:10.320]  percent and call for adding hormones to the water
[3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:17.600]  to sterilize the population now did you hear me twice
[3:41:17.600 --> 3:41:22.320]  the cuts in the third world they go to the moron third world
[3:41:22.320 --> 3:41:28.560]  and they tell them oh we're the imf and world bank that have raped you
[3:41:28.560 --> 3:41:32.640]  and they go to him and they say you're going to get all of america's money if
[3:41:32.640 --> 3:41:35.360]  you sign on to this then they actually get the text
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:39.440]  and it says oh you're going to have double the taxes
[3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:44.640]  of course of course it's feudalism it's imperium
[3:41:44.640 --> 3:41:50.720]  it's empire it's a global corporate tax for the private global government
[3:41:50.720 --> 3:41:53.840]  now don't worry you think the third world are morons
[3:41:53.840 --> 3:41:57.600]  they're geniuses compared to stupid yuppies in the west who think it's
[3:41:57.600 --> 3:42:02.160]  cute and funny and have terra pass and green pass and these stickers on their
[3:42:02.160 --> 3:42:06.880]  cars where they're already paying a a a tithe a
[3:42:06.880 --> 3:42:11.040]  indulgence like to to the church but but but to private
[3:42:11.040 --> 3:42:14.880]  corporations for carbon credits and they're already trading the carbon
[3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:18.160]  credits on the global exchanges the chicago mercantile the
[3:42:18.160 --> 3:42:23.680]  london exchange so did you hear that
[3:42:24.400 --> 3:42:27.760]  developing countries are setting unequal limits on per capita carbon
[3:42:27.760 --> 3:42:30.560]  emissions for developed and developing countries
[3:42:30.560 --> 3:42:35.120]  meaning that people in rich countries would be permitted to emit nearly twice
[3:42:35.120 --> 3:42:41.120]  as much under the proposals what did morris strong say
[3:42:41.120 --> 3:42:44.880]  i read the quotes directly yesterday here on air
[3:42:44.880 --> 3:42:48.320]  what did morris strong say like i have that list here somewhere i can read it
[3:42:48.320 --> 3:42:52.400]  again he said we must destroy the industrial societies
[3:42:52.400 --> 3:42:57.200]  and that's what the carbon tax will do destroy
[3:42:57.200 --> 3:43:01.120]  our society destroy it the third world doesn't have one yet
[3:43:01.120 --> 3:43:04.960]  this is meant to keep them from getting an industrial society
[3:43:04.960 --> 3:43:07.760]  which then they'll actually have less children if you believe that the world's
[3:43:07.760 --> 3:43:11.360]  overpopulated which is the moron common knowledge
[3:43:11.360 --> 3:43:14.560]  no there are some dirty technologies we need to phase out
[3:43:14.560 --> 3:43:17.680]  this has nothing to do with it but again you go to the
[3:43:17.680 --> 3:43:21.360]  london guardian copenhagen climate summit and disarray for danish text leak
[3:43:21.360 --> 3:43:28.320]  you click on it and then you can read the pdf
[3:43:28.320 --> 3:43:32.960]  for yourself so there you go this is a raping of the third world the so-called
[3:43:32.960 --> 3:43:38.320]  danish text a secret draft agreement worked on
[3:43:38.960 --> 3:43:42.720]  by a group of individuals known as the circle of commitment
[3:43:42.720 --> 3:43:46.960]  but understood to include uk us and denmark has been shown to a handful of
[3:43:46.960 --> 3:43:50.640]  countries since it finalized this week and it goes on
[3:43:50.640 --> 3:43:53.840]  force developing countries to agree to specific emissions cuts and measures
[3:43:53.840 --> 3:43:56.320]  that were not part of the original you in agreement
[3:43:56.320 --> 3:43:59.520]  see there are they're already expanding it it's not enough to put taxes on all
[3:43:59.520 --> 3:44:04.480]  money transfers and wire transfers and economic transactions it's not enough to
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:07.520]  create a global authority over all air travel with taxes
[3:44:07.520 --> 3:44:11.600]  it's not enough to put taxes on all beef all chicken all meat
[3:44:11.600 --> 3:44:17.680]  all fuel all heating oil it's not enough divide poor countries further by
[3:44:17.680 --> 3:44:20.640]  creating a new category of developed countries called
[3:44:20.640 --> 3:44:24.240]  the most vulnerable that means imf and world bank controlled nations they
[3:44:24.240 --> 3:44:27.600]  really want to rape weaken the un's role in handling climate
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:31.120]  finance because the un's only a fake debating society
[3:44:31.120 --> 3:44:35.280]  with the general assembly with no power it's the un security council
[3:44:35.280 --> 3:44:41.600]  and it's 15 members that obama heads that has all the power
[3:44:41.600 --> 3:44:47.440]  not allow poor countries to emit more than 1.44 tons of carbon per person
[3:44:47.440 --> 3:44:50.720]  develop country while allowing rich countries to emit
[3:44:50.720 --> 3:44:56.720]  a lot more 2.67 tons or twice that developing countries have been seen
[3:44:56.720 --> 3:45:00.320]  the text or understood to be furious that it is being promoted by rich
[3:45:00.320 --> 3:45:03.600]  countries without their knowledge and without discussion in the
[3:45:03.600 --> 3:45:06.720]  negotiations it goes on to say they're setting
[3:45:06.720 --> 3:45:12.000]  up a global environmental facility with global government power
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:15.600]  here's a london telegraph article talking about global government
[3:45:15.600 --> 3:45:25.440]  uses the term new world order and global government
[3:45:25.440 --> 3:45:28.560]  meanwhile
[3:45:28.560 --> 3:45:34.800]  meanwhile they are engaged in biblical level frauds with giant billboards tv ads
[3:45:34.800 --> 3:45:39.200]  globally with little girls in the picture please don't let me drown
[3:45:39.200 --> 3:45:42.320]  i'm going to drown sorts and eggers says san francisco
[3:45:42.320 --> 3:45:45.680]  938 feet above sea level is going to be underwater
[3:45:45.680 --> 3:45:52.800]  this is asinine baloney oh man
[3:45:55.920 --> 3:45:58.800]  you found the quotes
[3:46:01.920 --> 3:46:05.600]  yeah i don't see them there's so many quotes so many documents how do i even
[3:46:05.600 --> 3:46:10.240]  keep track of it all oh yes here are the quotes
[3:46:10.240 --> 3:46:14.320]  let me find the moray strong isn't the only hope for the planet
[3:46:14.320 --> 3:46:17.920]  that the industrialized civilizations collapse isn't it our responsibility to
[3:46:17.920 --> 3:46:22.560]  bring about that moray strong
[3:46:22.560 --> 3:46:26.080]  a massive campaign must be launched to de-develop the united states
[3:46:26.080 --> 3:46:28.640]  de-development means bringing our economic system in line with the
[3:46:28.640 --> 3:46:31.600]  realities of ecological and world resource situation paul
[3:46:31.600 --> 3:46:35.280]  early co-author of eco science with the
[3:46:35.280 --> 3:46:43.120]  white house science are calling for forcibly sterilizing you
[3:46:43.120 --> 3:46:45.840]  meanwhile there's this article from playboy
[3:46:45.840 --> 3:46:52.000]  1969 gore vidal the cousin of al gore calling for a global government for
[3:46:52.000 --> 3:46:56.560]  forced one-child policies you got to go read this
[3:46:56.560 --> 3:46:59.280]  article gore vidal endorses environmental authority
[3:46:59.280 --> 3:47:03.920]  to regulate breeding and license births how long have they worked for the plan
[3:47:03.920 --> 3:47:08.320]  that we now see unfolding globally how long have they been setting up
[3:47:08.320 --> 3:47:11.920]  this scam how long have they been pushing for this fraud
[3:47:11.920 --> 3:47:16.240]  because even people that expose them as a fraud and people that know polar bears
[3:47:16.240 --> 3:47:19.360]  numbers are expanding that the ice caps are getting bigger
[3:47:19.360 --> 3:47:23.120]  they still think they're just oh well-meaning idiot environmentalist
[3:47:23.120 --> 3:47:26.240]  no they're not well-meaning idiot environmentalist the low-level people
[3:47:26.240 --> 3:47:30.160]  are the leadership of this like queen batrix whose husband founded
[3:47:30.160 --> 3:47:34.480]  bilderberg and the world wildlife fund prince Bernhardt was a top nazi
[3:47:34.480 --> 3:47:40.800]  and eugenicist and set it up with the admitted eugenicist prince philip
[3:47:40.800 --> 3:47:45.200]  who gave interviews to mainstream newspapers
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:48.480]  and wrote the forward to the book if i was an animal
[3:47:48.480 --> 3:47:54.160]  saying he wants to come back reincarnated as a particularly deadly virus
[3:47:54.160 --> 3:47:57.280]  to kill more than 80 percent of the world's population
[3:47:57.280 --> 3:48:00.320]  what does dr eric pianca at the university of texas say
[3:48:00.320 --> 3:48:03.840]  he can't wait for airborne ebola to kill 90 percent of the world
[3:48:03.840 --> 3:48:07.760]  and we've got to kill 90 percent of the world and then his graduate students
[3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:10.960]  who are working in bio weapons labs publish his
[3:48:10.960 --> 3:48:17.200]  papers for their phd calling for killing all humans
[3:48:17.200 --> 3:48:20.720]  this is real ladies and gentlemen these people couldn't
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:26.880]  be more monstrous these people couldn't be more
[3:48:26.880 --> 3:48:30.960]  out of control these people couldn't be
[3:48:30.960 --> 3:48:33.760]  more wicked
[3:48:36.800 --> 3:48:40.800]  here's the video where they teach school children this is shown in schools
[3:48:40.800 --> 3:48:44.560]  all over the world that speak english that humans are a disease
[3:48:44.560 --> 3:48:48.320]  here it is
[3:48:49.120 --> 3:48:53.200]  our earth healthy strong and full of life but wait
[3:48:53.200 --> 3:48:58.640]  what's that you've got there it looks like you've got a case on the humans
[3:48:58.640 --> 3:49:06.400]  to be a healthy earth all of your elements must be in equilibrium
[3:49:06.400 --> 3:49:12.480]  however these parasites slaughter all of the forms of life
[3:49:12.480 --> 3:49:16.240]  guzzle your natural resources
[3:49:16.240 --> 3:49:23.520]  and poison your atmosphere

[3:49:28.720 --> 3:49:33.680]  today consuming anything that crosses their path

[3:49:42.880 --> 3:49:47.360]  so that's what the elite think of us when they're really the parasites
[3:49:47.360 --> 3:49:50.560]  meanwhile humans are incredible creatures we make many of the environments
[3:49:50.560 --> 3:49:54.320]  were in better the the planet was born in the

[3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:02.720]  more toxic waste than all human activity in 100 years if it's a big
[3:50:02.720 --> 3:50:07.120]  gaseous mount st helens type explosion
[3:50:07.120 --> 3:50:10.960]  but notice the double think oh it consumes your resources the human but
[3:50:10.960 --> 3:50:14.080]  you're also a parasite so it's double think

[3:54:55.200 --> 3:54:59.440]  planetoid going through space the sun is the main driver
[3:54:59.440 --> 3:55:03.200]  and i know most of you understand that but we've got to get out there to the
[3:55:03.200 --> 3:55:07.200]  young people and others that have been taught it's so trendy to be slaves
[3:55:07.200 --> 3:55:10.320]  it's so trendy to be taxed more to drive your car and be tracked
[3:55:10.320 --> 3:55:12.960]  it's so trendy to have home inspectors in your house
[3:55:12.960 --> 3:55:17.520]  it's so trendy to have an unelected global government

[3:55:20.720 --> 3:55:25.520]  cannot stress enough

[3:55:32.160 --> 3:55:38.240]  to have the leaked addendum to the Copenhagen global government treaty
[3:55:38.240 --> 3:55:41.840]  and to have that treaty openly state that it's meant to shut down the third
[3:55:41.840 --> 3:55:44.080]  world
[3:55:44.080 --> 3:55:51.280]  and there's another crazy article guru of science are Holdren called for
[3:55:51.280 --> 3:55:54.960]  doubling co2 emissions
[3:55:57.680 --> 3:56:02.800]  that's right he said that large amounts of it should be pumped
[3:56:02.800 --> 3:56:07.440]  in the atmosphere to stop global freezing see they try to guess
[3:56:07.440 --> 3:56:12.080]  whether we're going into a cold or hot cycle they all know as scientists that
[3:56:12.080 --> 3:56:16.880]  it's the sun driving most of it they know it's going to get hot it's going to
[3:56:16.880 --> 3:56:20.560]  get cold they know it goes through cycle so
[3:56:20.560 --> 3:56:24.160]  they try to bet and go okay we think it's about to get real cold we'll scare
[3:56:24.160 --> 3:56:29.040]  everybody and say give us global government
[3:56:29.040 --> 3:56:32.480]  and let us tax and run your lives you're going to freeze to death
[3:56:32.480 --> 3:56:35.600]  and then it starts getting hotter and they go oh give us global government let
[3:56:35.600 --> 3:56:39.440]  us tax and trace everything you're doing or
[3:56:39.440 --> 3:56:42.640]  you're going to burn up and and and the oceans is going to
[3:56:42.640 --> 3:56:46.880]  are going to massively rise and flood you and then
[3:56:46.880 --> 3:56:51.920]  it starts cooling off again and they go okay any change in climate is unnatural
[3:56:51.920 --> 3:56:58.320]  this is exactly what Aztec priest did or what Babylonian priest did a thousand
[3:56:58.320 --> 3:57:03.680]  two thousand three thousand years ago the priest or the scammer class the
[3:57:03.680 --> 3:57:09.200]  fraud class the original magicians the con artist
[3:57:09.200 --> 3:57:12.800]  they'd throw some gunpowder in a fire it would
[3:57:12.800 --> 3:57:17.840]  explode and they'd say i have magic give me the best food the best hut the best
[3:57:17.840 --> 3:57:22.240]  women and then they would map the stars and they knew that
[3:57:22.240 --> 3:57:25.920]  every certain amount of time the sun would disappear
[3:57:25.920 --> 3:57:29.840]  in an eclipse and the moon would disappear and they would have a big
[3:57:29.840 --> 3:57:34.320]  ritual and and to make everyone supplicate and and prove their worship of
[3:57:34.320 --> 3:57:36.720]  them they would say give me your firstborn i'm
[3:57:36.720 --> 3:57:40.000]  going to cut their heart out the gods demand it
[3:57:40.000 --> 3:57:43.120]  and they really knew it was psychological warfare just making people
[3:57:43.120 --> 3:57:46.560]  submit to them and sometimes the people say we're not going to give you our
[3:57:46.560 --> 3:57:50.640]  children and then they would go okay and an eclipse was coming up and they'd
[3:57:50.640 --> 3:57:55.200]  say and then everybody would see the sun
[3:57:55.200 --> 3:57:59.360]  disappear of the moon they go bring it back and he would
[3:57:59.360 --> 3:58:02.000]  say do you give me and my family complete power
[3:58:02.000 --> 3:58:05.600]  we are no longer just high priest we are now the royal dynasty
[3:58:05.600 --> 3:58:10.560]  of the toll tech kingdom they would say uh uh
