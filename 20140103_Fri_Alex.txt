[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:40.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.360 --> 00:46.000]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.400]  worldwide edition of the Alex Jones show or what I call in full Wars live we're
[00:51.400 --> 00:58.480]  gonna be here live for the next three hours and we have joining us coming up
[00:58.480 --> 01:04.000]  skull and bones a whistleblower and of course former I had a policy at the
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.360]  Department of Education Charlotte Isherby to break down Common Core and how
[01:09.360 --> 01:14.000]  that ties into the deliberate dumbing down of this country and the world and
[01:14.000 --> 01:21.720]  she is going to be joining us coming up today in the second hour for part of the
[01:21.720 --> 01:25.680]  second hour and then I'm going to get Reverend Childress on black genocide
[01:25.680 --> 01:32.680]  org who's an author and filmmaker and researcher dealing with the extermination
[01:32.680 --> 01:38.360]  of black people in this country targeted via abortion and other other systems
[01:38.360 --> 01:42.880]  and now the Democratic Party on record this has been their mission since about
[01:42.880 --> 01:49.480]  19 since about 1900 when the Klan couldn't basically annihilate black people
[01:49.480 --> 01:56.800]  by openly trying to kill them they then just posed as their friends and that's
[01:56.800 --> 02:01.920]  actually on record so you you should know that and with the culture they've
[02:01.920 --> 02:06.960]  sold to MTV and the rest of it they've done an incredibly good job in damaging
[02:06.960 --> 02:13.800]  the culture across the board not not just a so-called urban or black culture
[02:13.800 --> 02:18.840]  weaponized culture so if they can't kill you in the womb they're gonna get you
[02:18.840 --> 02:22.480]  with the chemicals the biologicals the thug gangster culture so they can put
[02:22.480 --> 02:27.120]  you in a prison so we're gonna be talking to Reverend Childress Leonard
[02:27.120 --> 02:31.720]  Childress coming up in the third hour as well and we will open the phones up
[02:31.720 --> 02:39.040]  during both those guests today my uncle did pass today at about 3 30 a.m. and
[02:39.040 --> 02:41.880]  the reason I mentioned it is a lot of you prayed for him and I appreciate he
[02:41.880 --> 02:46.360]  was a great guy one of the people was instrumental in helping wake me up to
[02:46.360 --> 02:52.600]  how the world really worked 68 years old Vietnam helicopter pilot veteran just a
[02:52.600 --> 02:57.360]  great patriot and one of the best men I've ever known you say he's a good guy
[02:57.360 --> 03:03.280]  he's a sweet person he's a smart person you literally that's the only thing that
[03:03.280 --> 03:07.720]  comes to mind when you talk about my uncle William Forrest Hammond so he's
[03:07.720 --> 03:12.560]  gone now and you got Barbara Bush in a hospital fighting basically the same
[03:12.560 --> 03:19.160]  thing it is a bacterial pneumonia that grows in the space made by the mutated
[03:19.160 --> 03:23.320]  flu virus according to a doctor Sherry Tenpenny medical doctor who has
[03:23.320 --> 03:27.080]  clinics in the US and other countries and it was incredible because I hadn't
[03:27.080 --> 03:30.080]  talked to her till she was on air yesterday and she was saying the same
[03:30.080 --> 03:35.520]  names the doctors in Texas were saying to me of the bacteria and of what they
[03:35.520 --> 03:39.680]  thought it happened so this this is directly correlated and linked to
[03:39.680 --> 03:48.000]  vaccines causing viral mutations and then the antibiotics causing mutations and
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.840]  drug resistant bacteria and most people I know that have died haven't even died
[03:54.840 --> 03:58.320]  in the last 20 years friends and family in car wrecks that used to be the number
[03:58.320 --> 04:03.120]  one cause of death and then heart attacks in cancer everybody's dying from
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.840]  hospital infections and he was sick when he finally went to the hospital with a
[04:07.840 --> 04:12.080]  mutation that developed basically out of the medical system all the evidence
[04:12.080 --> 04:15.920]  points towards it but the doctors said point blank in there they said if he can
[04:15.920 --> 04:24.560]  survive any hospital hospital pathogens you know he may live because
[04:24.560 --> 04:32.960]  he was there about a week and a half ago but my uncle my uncle after he was
[04:32.960 --> 04:35.560]  taking off the sedation and the ventilator and all the rest of it passed
[04:35.560 --> 04:39.800]  on his owner about a day so he's in a better place he's moved on to the next
[04:39.800 --> 04:45.840]  level and believe me many of us have seen it there is the next level and I
[04:45.840 --> 04:50.160]  just feel sorry for all those out there who well as the major studies show do
[04:50.160 --> 04:56.080]  not have the brain tissue density and neuron density to pick up on the other
[04:56.080 --> 05:02.760]  world Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty

[08:30.880 --> 08:38.760]  thank you so much for joining us on this live third day of January 2014 we're
[08:38.760 --> 08:42.320]  gonna be here Lord Willems the next three hours just gonna finish up talking
[08:42.320 --> 08:46.360]  about my uncle and then I'm gonna get into all of the incredibly important
[08:46.360 --> 08:52.280]  geopolitical economic Obamacare news police state news you name it it is all
[08:52.280 --> 08:56.920]  extremely important the record cold hitting much of the world right now and
[08:56.920 --> 09:03.320]  of course the UN and other organizations respond by claiming the earth just saw
[09:03.320 --> 09:08.680]  record heat which actually isn't even true but they don't care the Sun folks is
[09:08.680 --> 09:15.880]  the reason the ice caps on the Martian landscape were melting until about five
[09:15.880 --> 09:22.480]  years ago and then the Sun began to cool dramatically and is now in a record low
[09:22.480 --> 09:29.880]  level of emissions of all types and not just visible light that heats the earth
[09:29.880 --> 09:35.240]  and so that's why we're plunging into cold I don't need to be a rocket
[09:35.240 --> 09:39.160]  scientist to know the Sun is the main driver of climate on the planet but I
[09:39.160 --> 09:44.280]  have had top climatologist top physicist top astrophysicist top
[09:44.280 --> 09:50.240]  meteorologist and others on the broadcast many many times from Russia from
[09:50.240 --> 09:54.200]  England from the United States to break that down and they have the ice core
[09:54.200 --> 09:59.440]  samples that they can then reflect with the Sun cycles that they have
[09:59.440 --> 10:04.080]  registered in the last 200 years and they know what's going on the Sun on
[10:04.080 --> 10:08.480]  Monday the Sun flip polarity they believe obviously it's happened before
[10:08.480 --> 10:13.680]  this is the first time it was observed by radio telescopes and polarity didn't
[10:13.680 --> 10:23.360]  just flip the Sun flipped the Sun flipped and it sent a whole bunch of
[10:23.360 --> 10:27.240]  different types of particles at the earth that come into the atmosphere and
[10:27.240 --> 10:31.880]  then water gathers around them as they come into the atmosphere the nuclei and
[10:31.880 --> 10:36.120]  then that forms haze then clouds then rain that's why when they have big
[10:36.120 --> 10:40.920]  solar flares real astrophysicist folks that actually done the research have
[10:40.920 --> 10:48.880]  known for 100 plus years that when you have a bunch of solar flares and sun
[10:48.880 --> 10:55.800]  spots that they know even there's clear blue skies look for haze to form then
[10:55.800 --> 11:01.360]  thunder heads then rain because that's the main driver also of what goes on in
[11:01.360 --> 11:07.720]  our atmosphere is the Sun but Minnesota worst deep freeze in 20 years that's
[11:07.720 --> 11:11.560]  saying a lot where it routinely gets 40 below wind chills may hit 50 below
[11:11.560 --> 11:21.000]  blast up to 30 inches of snow in New England totals exposed skin freezes in
[11:21.000 --> 11:28.280]  15 minutes worker crushed to death by 100 foot salt pile fighting the snow
[11:28.280 --> 11:32.760]  killer chiller map dredgerport.com has that we can punch it up and click it
[11:32.760 --> 11:37.840]  New York City mayor too cold for school sun played role in cancellation
[11:37.840 --> 11:44.800]  America spent 7.45 billion fighting global warming in other countries MSNBC
[11:44.800 --> 11:56.000]  host complains of snow trolling North Arctic rescue ship stuck in ice or now
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.480]  Antarctic rescue ship is stuck in ice so it's continuing a very very serious
[12:01.480 --> 12:09.840]  situation obviously with temperatures below zero all over areas of North
[12:09.840 --> 12:16.960]  America into the north of the United United States so that's just some of the
[12:16.960 --> 12:22.360]  news on that front so they've responded by coming out and saying that it's a
[12:22.360 --> 12:27.040]  record high temperatures I'm gonna be getting into that article also the full
[12:27.040 --> 12:33.640]  horror that is Obamacare is now now setting in for the minions of it we
[12:33.640 --> 12:37.280]  have a lot of these articles up on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com right
[12:37.280 --> 12:42.640]  now daily mail they had no idea if my insurance was active or not Obamacare
[12:42.640 --> 12:48.840]  confusion reigns as frustrated patients walk out of hospitals without treatment
[12:48.840 --> 12:52.080]  see you thought you went and signed up for Obamacare but send this for two
[12:52.080 --> 12:58.080]  months you didn't sign up for it okay the only way you quote sign up for it is
[12:58.080 --> 13:02.680]  when the insurance company increases your current plan or kicks you off and
[13:02.680 --> 13:08.320]  makes you buy more here's another one Obamacare's youth expected to spike
[13:08.320 --> 13:13.520]  beginning next week and of course the the prices are set to go up the Hill
[13:13.520 --> 13:21.920]  reports data goldmine Walgreens Walmart offer free prescriptions to Obamacare
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.240]  customers for their data because if you when you enroll in Obamacare you wave
[13:26.240 --> 13:30.380]  all your rights to privacy and that's extremely valuable but only the first
[13:30.380 --> 13:35.840]  round to the insurance companies and others doctor's office CBS News reports
[13:35.840 --> 13:41.840]  spends two hours on hold with health insurer for patient surgery authorization
[13:41.840 --> 13:44.760]  that's right if you're an illegal alien you immediately go to the head of the
[13:44.760 --> 13:48.080]  line but if you have insurance now this happened to my friend who took his
[13:48.080 --> 13:52.960]  daughter with the sinus infection to the hospital I would just go to a clinic
[13:52.960 --> 13:57.400]  less killer bugs and it was he shot video of it just nothing but illegal
[13:57.400 --> 14:00.840]  aliens all being put to the front of the line he had insurance had to wait three
[14:00.840 --> 14:05.320]  hours it was double the cost that had been previously one of our crew members
[14:05.320 --> 14:09.800]  went to his regular medical doctor his general practitioner yesterday more than
[14:09.800 --> 14:14.240]  double the price couldn't see his doctor saw a assistant but what he's never
[14:14.240 --> 14:20.040]  done and basically didn't get any care so hope you enjoy that continuing
[14:20.040 --> 14:27.040]  Oregon mother I can't afford Obamacare for myself or my one-year-old son she
[14:27.040 --> 14:30.920]  could afford it before her insurance but now she can well that's part of the
[14:30.920 --> 14:36.360]  good deal I mean the wolf of the White House Obama and the globalist make the
[14:36.360 --> 14:40.920]  wolf of Wall Street and I did see the movie last night it was very well done
[14:40.920 --> 14:45.000]  but pornographic to the max the most pornographic film in a movie theater I've
[14:45.000 --> 14:52.320]  ever seen and I went to analyze it and I saw the audience laughing profusely when
[14:52.320 --> 14:56.600]  he was conning and ripping people off and getting off on it and I realized
[14:56.600 --> 15:01.680]  America loves get rich schemes they love to be conned when people get conned by
[15:01.680 --> 15:06.440]  lottery tickets or penny stocks they never stop they only get more into it
[15:06.440 --> 15:10.800]  and and and you know just it's all part of this imagineer everybody's gonna be a
[15:10.800 --> 15:15.360]  rock star everybody's gonna be a movie star everybody's gonna be a sports star
[15:15.360 --> 15:19.040]  everybody's gonna be but but nobody's gonna be a good father nobody's gonna
[15:19.040 --> 15:22.960]  be a good mother nobody's gonna go plan a garden nobody's gonna go hiking the
[15:22.960 --> 15:26.080]  woods nobody's gonna enjoy the stars and the moon at night all the beauty
[15:26.080 --> 15:30.840]  around us everyone is gonna just believe in Obama and believe in the con game and
[15:30.840 --> 15:34.520]  and then they'll just bring in new kind of oh he's gonna act as a dictator and
[15:34.520 --> 15:37.240]  take those restrictions off he put in and then of course he doesn't do that
[15:37.240 --> 15:42.200]  it's part of roping a dope it's part of just keeping it going and going and
[15:42.200 --> 15:49.960]  going and going so continuing here Harvard study Medicare actually increases
[15:49.960 --> 15:54.000]  ER visits yeah set a going to clinics that have even better medical care in
[15:54.000 --> 15:58.280]  most cases private clinics that Obamacare basically designed to shut down
[15:58.280 --> 16:02.320]  that have the chest x-rays and have the doctors and the nurse practitioners all
[16:02.320 --> 16:07.280]  the good people that's where I go and are nice clean newer facilities instead of
[16:07.280 --> 16:12.240]  doing that people literally if everyone I know people that have insurance they
[16:12.240 --> 16:19.040]  end up going to the hospital and I mean if your fingers cut off you got to go
[16:19.040 --> 16:23.000]  to the hospital the last time I went to the hospital again I just don't like
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.960]  being a second-class citizen the illegal aliens were sitting there for an
[16:25.960 --> 16:30.440]  hour just not even being checked it was just you know no-speak English nothing
[16:30.440 --> 16:34.360]  you know here's my console matricula boom you're right in I had insurance it
[16:34.360 --> 16:38.920]  was like whoa let's figure this out let's verify it for an hour let's jack it
[16:38.920 --> 16:44.040]  up let's and I was like I'm gonna lose my finger I had to threaten to sue them to
[16:44.040 --> 16:51.640]  get okay well the doctor's been here they'll attach your finger and that's the
[16:51.640 --> 16:56.120]  type of stuff that's going on this finger right here that's the type of stuff
[16:56.120 --> 17:02.320]  that's going on in this country thousands of illegal immigrants show up at DMV
[17:02.320 --> 17:06.680]  offices to obtain drivers authorization cards that's right all over the country
[17:06.680 --> 17:11.040]  California you name it the the the illegals are all being given drivers
[17:11.040 --> 17:16.400]  license and they're allowed to use that to vote because no one checks if you're
[17:16.400 --> 17:20.200]  a citizen just with an address you can vote show that's how they're gonna get
[17:20.200 --> 17:24.480]  our guns the guns are banned in Mexico and the client group coming in on a
[17:24.480 --> 17:28.140]  Mexico predominantly will vote for the Democrats or the Republicans look at
[17:28.140 --> 17:35.720]  Schwarzenegger his anti-gun when he was governor and pro open border and pro
[17:35.720 --> 17:38.840]  carbon taxes and everything else horrible so the Republicans all loved
[17:38.840 --> 17:42.360]  him they didn't care as long as they could feel good and feel like they were
[17:42.360 --> 17:46.240]  in charge it was all right and they're talking about the governor running for
[17:46.240 --> 17:50.360]  president the country will probably vote him in somewhere down the line brown

[24:32.680 --> 24:38.880]  more was my uncle William Faris Hammond who died at 3 30 a.m. this morning in
[24:38.880 --> 24:43.720]  Tyler Texas where he was at a really nice hospital with good people and I'm
[24:43.720 --> 24:46.760]  not gonna talk about this anymore after this segment I'm gonna get into all the
[24:46.760 --> 24:53.000]  drone news the Justice Department trying to block the Supreme Court's
[24:53.000 --> 25:01.000]  contraceptive mandate stay IMF paper worms of savings tax and mass ride-offs
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.320]  as West debt hits 200 year high that's just some of what we're gonna be
[25:06.320 --> 25:13.000]  breaking down here today but just getting back to my uncle it ties into so
[25:13.000 --> 25:22.640]  many things that my cousin his son got sick for a couple days and died of what
[25:22.640 --> 25:27.040]  they at first thought was flu but then said they believe was some type of
[25:27.040 --> 25:31.360]  bacterial infection in his lungs we've been talking for about a month about the
[25:31.360 --> 25:35.960]  mystery illness before it was even in the media now the former first lady
[25:35.960 --> 25:44.360]  Barbara Bush is in critical condition in a hospital with pneumonia and it's a
[25:44.360 --> 25:51.960]  cocktail of viruses and drug-resistant bacteria and there's just so much of it
[25:51.960 --> 25:55.440]  out there and talking to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny medical doctor yesterday she
[25:55.440 --> 26:00.960]  was listening on air of the mutations that the flu vaccine is actually causing
[26:00.960 --> 26:09.600]  creating new flu's and how also that's then causing infections that then create
[26:09.600 --> 26:16.480]  a space that these drug-resistant bacteria can grow in and what she was
[26:16.480 --> 26:21.840]  saying is exactly what the other medical doctors that were treating my uncle
[26:21.840 --> 26:26.320]  were saying and and no one could tell exactly what's doing all of this but
[26:26.320 --> 26:31.480]  undoubtedly if you have the number of deaths going on in Texas alone five
[26:31.480 --> 26:37.200]  years ago with the whole H1N1 hype meant to sell products and meant to get
[26:37.200 --> 26:40.080]  people to go get vaccinated with whatever else had been added to that shot
[26:40.080 --> 26:45.480]  there was a bunch of stuff in there very experimental if you had one tenth as
[26:45.480 --> 26:50.400]  many deaths then it would have been total hysteria so you know it's serious
[26:50.400 --> 26:53.800]  and you know it's bad when all the hospitals around the country are full
[26:53.800 --> 26:59.640]  not just here in Texas but this is the epicenter it seems when they're not just
[26:59.640 --> 27:06.640]  full but there's people dying in them in mass I mean we're talking about 10
[27:06.640 --> 27:11.720]  people or so in some major hospitals dying a week from this five people six
[27:11.720 --> 27:16.480]  people four people in small hospitals I mean it is serious business and it's
[27:16.480 --> 27:23.600]  barely even hit the news wires and so my children hardly ever get sick took them
[27:23.600 --> 27:30.320]  three weeks to get over this my dad was sick for a month and went and got tested
[27:30.320 --> 27:34.600]  and they couldn't find out what it was because it's a microplasm that's what
[27:34.600 --> 27:39.040]  fills in the gaps according to Sherry Tenpenny and others are these
[27:39.040 --> 27:43.200]  microscopic bacteria bacteria already microscopic but they're tiny compared to
[27:43.200 --> 27:49.960]  a regular bacteria and it it was being reported a few weeks ago when the death
[27:49.960 --> 27:54.640]  was starting to occur now there's pretty much a blackout on it so we need to
[27:54.640 --> 27:58.440]  continue to investigate that but I want to thank you all for your prayers for
[27:58.440 --> 28:02.940]  my uncle I want to thank you for your prayers for this radio show and what we
[28:02.940 --> 28:07.720]  do here I know you're going through a lot out there as well I know that we
[28:07.720 --> 28:13.320]  have some crew members here Weldon's uncle is in a hospital also Vietnam
[28:13.320 --> 28:22.040]  fighter helicopter pilot and they said that he's dying of Agent Orange and very
[28:22.040 --> 28:27.200]  similar parallels to Weldon who I had dinner with last night and with some of
[28:27.200 --> 28:33.200]  the other crew and with what's happened with my uncle and they did say with my
[28:33.200 --> 28:37.680]  uncle who never smoked hardly ever drank he'd drink a beer every once in a while
[28:37.680 --> 28:45.000]  on a hot day if he'd mowed the lawn he was a football player at LSU and also
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.800]  track a really good shape you know looked younger his body looked younger
[28:49.800 --> 28:55.760]  than my body and I'm just 40 40 next month he was 68 but when they looked at
[28:55.760 --> 28:59.760]  his heart and things and lesions on it and on some other organs they said no
[28:59.760 --> 29:05.280]  we've seen this in Vietnam veterans that's Agent Orange lesions and of course
[29:05.280 --> 29:09.320]  his first born son had holes in his heart no history of deforming our
[29:09.320 --> 29:13.320]  family thank God and they said no that that was the Agent Orange but then it
[29:13.320 --> 29:16.080]  got out of the system it was usually the first born that would happen to right
[29:16.080 --> 29:23.720]  after he got back from Vietnam my it'd be my first cousin Flint who it was a
[29:23.720 --> 29:30.280]  pretty much exactly the same age as I and he he died so just thank you Monsanto
[29:30.280 --> 29:33.960]  Monsanto that brought us Agent Orange that they knew was a death sentence and
[29:33.960 --> 29:37.480]  really a chemical weapon to kill the North Vietnamese which also blew back on
[29:37.480 --> 29:41.960]  our troops just like DU does thank you Monsanto you've you've killed so many
[29:41.960 --> 29:45.920]  members of my family and thank you for all the GMO and thank you that you

[33:43.640 --> 33:48.080]  everyone I know in the office talking to them has friends and family that can't
[33:48.080 --> 33:52.480]  breathe that have lost 20-30 pounds that have been in the hospital for weeks or
[33:52.480 --> 33:57.440]  who have been in bed for a week I mean this is some really bad pneumonia going
[33:57.440 --> 34:01.760]  around the country and again you notice there's almost no news coverage of it
[34:01.760 --> 34:07.200]  and I have been involved with two family members dying in the last month with
[34:07.200 --> 34:12.080]  this and I have talked to the doctors and they say it's a virus that comes in
[34:12.080 --> 34:18.640]  and then bacteria come in and then another virus comes in it is just a
[34:18.640 --> 34:24.680]  swarm a swarm of stuff and then when it gets into the brain it's goodbye my
[34:24.680 --> 34:33.040]  uncle's body came back but nobody home nobody home when he came back and they
[34:33.040 --> 34:36.280]  took him off the breathing assist and he died in a day and again that's the
[34:36.280 --> 34:39.320]  reason I'm talking about it is because it affects everybody Barbara Bush
[34:39.320 --> 34:45.680]  hospitalized for pneumonia in Texas and that's out of the New York Times so this
[34:45.680 --> 34:51.280]  is serious serious business ladies and gentlemen serious it's not just that it
[34:51.280 --> 34:55.600]  took out two members of my family it is killing people all over the place and
[34:55.600 --> 34:58.760]  I'll hear people in the grocery store line going my husband's in the hospital
[34:58.760 --> 35:03.240]  he can't breathe they're going to have to ventilate him and then I walk up and
[35:03.240 --> 35:07.440]  get a cup of coffee about a week and a half ago singing performance of one of
[35:07.440 --> 35:14.000]  my daughters in a ballet and the woman behind the counter was sitting there
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.280]  making coffee talking about her boyfriend who had to go to the hospital the
[35:16.280 --> 35:19.480]  night before I mean that's just what I'm hearing everywhere that's what I'm
[35:19.480 --> 35:24.240]  hearing all over the place so mystery illness big time and we know it's not
[35:24.240 --> 35:30.240]  the flu as they say but dr. Sherry timby says the flu has caused mutated
[35:30.240 --> 35:34.920]  viruses because they create a new virus and it's not properly attenuated it's
[35:34.920 --> 35:38.880]  very sophisticated information but it's just amazing to see all this
[35:38.880 --> 35:44.520]  unfolding but you've got your new obama care your new obama care to take care of
[35:44.520 --> 35:47.880]  you that's doubling and tripling prices and the people that thought they signed
[35:47.880 --> 35:52.320]  up are going in and they're not signed up or if you did have insurance now it
[35:52.320 --> 35:56.560]  takes hours to get in even if you're bleeding to death and they announced
[35:56.560 --> 36:00.920]  yesterday that the head of health and human services and the federal
[36:00.920 --> 36:04.120]  government will dictate through the computers we already knew this but now
[36:04.120 --> 36:08.760]  it's official they made the announcement that yes they will control what
[36:08.760 --> 36:14.840]  surgeries take place the doctor will put by law into the database and then the
[36:14.840 --> 36:21.480]  database will tell them what they can do how's that sound forget the patient or
[36:21.480 --> 36:25.040]  forget the family having control with the doctor in that decision-making
[36:25.040 --> 36:29.680]  process and working with the nurses and coming to that conclusion no now all
[36:29.680 --> 36:35.880]  your dad is public and obama is your doctor a eugenicist and I tell you that
[36:35.880 --> 36:40.600]  is a great deal isn't it aren't you excited about that isn't it wonderful
[36:40.600 --> 36:45.040]  to have a big government that totally enslaves you and runs your life by the
[36:45.040 --> 36:56.400]  way we showed this video last year the Air Force put out a video graphic a
[36:56.400 --> 37:06.040]  animated illustration film illustration showing a drone flying over a city and
[37:06.040 --> 37:11.600]  releasing hundreds of hunter killer robots that have a camera in them and
[37:11.600 --> 37:17.320]  also a gun and they're only about six inches long with little bat wings and
[37:17.320 --> 37:21.320]  now they've come out and announced that indeed that's what they actually have
[37:21.320 --> 37:25.440]  and that they will use this against anybody and everybody can you imagine
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.560]  the criminals that run the world when they have systems like this and it gets
[37:29.560 --> 37:34.080]  better they say they're going to deploy chemical weapons well they're already
[37:34.080 --> 37:40.920]  doing that with the chemtrails and the weather modification and it then spies on
[37:40.920 --> 37:49.600]  you and then it calls in some of the other drone swarms to then attack and
[37:49.600 --> 37:54.440]  there's actual footage in their rendering of them watching terrorists that
[37:54.440 --> 37:59.800]  is anybody that resist them and then taking them out now let's move forward
[37:59.800 --> 38:07.000]  here to the Daily Mail military drones set to get stronger chemical weapons
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.760]  because they're already preparing them with tear gas for you and your family
[38:10.760 --> 38:15.920]  with your taxpayer paid for money military drones set to get stronger
[38:15.920 --> 38:19.560]  chemical weapons and could soon make their own decisions during missions
[38:19.560 --> 38:25.360]  again four years ago the British and the United States launched drones that are
[38:25.360 --> 38:30.880]  autonomous and decide who to kill I want to make that clear that that's what's
[38:30.880 --> 38:36.440]  going on the US Department of Defense revealed its unmanned systems
[38:36.440 --> 38:42.720]  integrated roadmap setting out as technology aims and again whatever they
[38:42.720 --> 38:47.200]  tell you about in the next 25 years means they already have it its plans
[38:47.200 --> 38:53.440]  include drone bombs that can hunt in swarms that's a quote from a mother
[38:53.440 --> 38:57.880]  ship next generation unmanned aircraft will likely be equipped with better
[38:57.880 --> 39:03.720]  sensors and navigational equipment plus superior autonomous systems and in that
[39:03.720 --> 39:11.160]  same Air Force video towards the end it actually shows the drone the mini drone
[39:11.160 --> 39:15.280]  that was dropped from the swarm actually kill the man who has a rifle and then in
[39:15.280 --> 39:19.120]  law enforcement video that came out earlier this year the Paul Watson wrote
[39:19.120 --> 39:25.560]  about the drudge report and others picked up it actually showed them taking on two
[39:25.560 --> 39:30.080]  American gun owners when guns are banned and it shows two Duck Dynasty type guys
[39:30.080 --> 39:35.840]  literally in a field shelling each other a rifle and the drone of course brings
[39:35.840 --> 39:39.520]  the police in on them so this is it and you're like well the police will never
[39:39.520 --> 39:43.720]  be able to control this ladies and gentlemen the police down in Katy
[39:43.720 --> 39:50.160]  Texas got a $600,000 drone helicopter that was about eight feet long and
[39:50.160 --> 39:54.840]  crashed it on the first takeoff because just two years ago they didn't have
[39:54.840 --> 40:01.000]  proper autonomous software I bought the Parrot 2 for my son for Christmas that
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.320]  cost $300 so we can also beta test it here in the office I'm gonna put a video
[40:06.320 --> 40:11.400]  out of it today and the Parrot 2 we bought a Parrot 1 a year ago and shot
[40:11.400 --> 40:16.600]  it in the video drone shot down over Texas using an iPad to control it was
[40:16.600 --> 40:22.080]  still hard to control it my son the first time out of the box flew it for
[40:22.080 --> 40:26.160]  10 minutes and landed it safely and it's flown at 50 times until he finally
[40:26.160 --> 40:30.120]  crashed it into a tree we have to put a new propeller on it and it's a four prop
[40:30.120 --> 40:38.600]  $300 unit with HD video for $300 HD camera HD video beams it back to the
[40:38.600 --> 40:48.880]  iPad $300 and it could be weaponized right now even SPF Russian has shown a
[40:48.880 --> 40:58.280]  year ago drones that cost a few thousand dollars with automatic weapons on them
[40:58.280 --> 41:02.920]  firing and the police departments now will be able to set their target via
[41:02.920 --> 41:11.360]  face scan or address hit one button and a squadron of 15 attack bots will take
[41:11.360 --> 41:17.760]  off at current technology level for about $10,000 and they will go and kill
[41:17.760 --> 41:23.240]  everyone that they're targeting okay you have to understand this ladies and
[41:23.240 --> 41:30.600]  gentlemen this is the reality and this is the end of humanity this is why the
[41:30.600 --> 41:34.000]  globalists are so arrogant this is why they're so out of control this is why
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.440]  they don't care they have incredible life extension technologies already rolling
[41:37.440 --> 41:42.840]  out look at Dick Cheney no one used to live from what he went through having a
[41:42.840 --> 41:46.640]  bionic heart pump for two years and then getting a new heart now you look
[41:46.640 --> 41:54.040]  super healthy you're not gonna get access to that that's a big hoax that oh
[41:54.040 --> 41:58.960]  he got regular medical care that was someone incredibly compromised he was
[41:58.960 --> 42:03.680]  on a ventilator for three months still survived because of the technology they
[42:03.680 --> 42:07.800]  have they don't want you to have that and they've decided to take over
[42:07.800 --> 42:11.960]  civilization and society and if you act stupid and if you act lazy and if you
[42:11.960 --> 42:17.200]  act like you don't care they're going to win let's go to the next article on
[42:17.200 --> 42:23.640]  technology here wall climbing gecko robot could scuttle in space see the
[42:23.640 --> 42:28.160]  decision is humans aren't going to space robots are going to space and the elite
[42:28.160 --> 42:31.520]  and Google believe they're gonna merge with the machines I don't know if that's
[42:31.520 --> 42:36.560]  true or not that's their goal they have set the course for our world and our
[42:36.560 --> 42:42.760]  planet is that something you want do you want to just just just just seed the
[42:42.760 --> 42:48.160]  entire future to them so you can go watch NFL football and against the same
[42:48.160 --> 42:53.160]  wall scuttling robots that have the dual use as combat bots and this is what
[42:53.160 --> 42:59.840]  you're seeing I was told by Marines high level if colonels high level that they
[42:59.840 --> 43:06.360]  had killer robots better than what you see in the movie Terminator 15 years ago
[43:06.360 --> 43:14.400]  and then I years later saw some of what he told me about actually declassified
[43:14.400 --> 43:20.960]  partially I was told they're gonna roll out microwave guns on the backs of
[43:20.960 --> 43:25.760]  Humvees couple years later that came out I was told and then later he said and
[43:25.760 --> 43:37.000]  then there's stuff even more crazy I was told it doesn't even matter and the
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.960]  issue is this is not to keep us safe this is pointed at us this is pointed at
[43:41.960 --> 43:46.480]  controlling civilization and society you know there is some good news though in
[43:46.480 --> 43:51.040]  the culture war and we're gonna go to your phone calls television blackouts
[43:51.040 --> 43:56.400]  possible in three NFL playoff cities this weekend because they can't sell the
[43:56.400 --> 44:00.360]  tickets and then you know if they don't sell the tickets there's a blackout and
[44:00.360 --> 44:05.680]  then all the narcissist football players are begging people to buy the tickets
[44:05.680 --> 44:10.480]  let me explain something to you the country's in a depression by design
[44:10.480 --> 44:16.840]  agenda 21 is the name of the game bankrupt is by design for control a b people
[44:16.840 --> 44:21.000]  that do have money are boycotting you because of the TSA genital groping at
[44:21.000 --> 44:29.280]  the games and because of the anti-gun Obamacare promotion when you've got
[44:29.280 --> 44:34.480]  Obama who symbolizes a government with a six percent approval rating as your
[44:34.480 --> 44:41.360]  mascot and not Hank Williams junior you're going to turn people off and so
[44:41.360 --> 44:47.200]  herein lies the secret if we culturally steal ourselves I don't mean steel like
[44:47.200 --> 44:54.160]  take something away like steel make ourselves stoic and strong if we realize
[44:54.160 --> 44:57.480]  the systems corrupt and boycott everything that's anti-liberty promote
[44:57.480 --> 45:01.840]  everything that is liberty we will take America back just like we did with the
[45:01.840 --> 45:06.820]  Duck Dynasty fight when Roe v Wade went through in 73 because nobody could see a
[45:06.820 --> 45:14.440]  ultrasound now we have them the majority of people in this country were
[45:14.440 --> 45:20.240]  pro-abortion today every poll shows it's flipped 65 70 even higher with young
[45:20.240 --> 45:26.120]  people are against it we're winning the culture war despite everything the
[45:26.120 --> 45:34.400]  system is doing and it's the same thing with the NFL and they just hope we all
[45:34.400 --> 45:37.800]  become deck in it and decide the way you get ahead and that's the message of the
[45:37.800 --> 45:43.440]  wolf of Wall Street is by screwing people and it doesn't matter you know if
[45:43.440 --> 45:49.760]  you screw people you'll still win in the end and it's fun and it's cute and it's
[45:49.760 --> 45:59.240]  good and the FBI is good they came and stopped Leo Nardo de Caprio's character
[45:59.240 --> 46:05.680]  who we've looked into and of course he actually went after a billionaire in
[46:05.680 --> 46:10.000]  Alabama and screwed him and that's why the FBI was told to go after him was
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.520]  because he went after an insider he screwed rich people he targeted rich
[46:13.520 --> 46:20.240]  people and not poor people if you target poor people at penny stocks or the
[46:20.240 --> 46:24.280]  general public that's fine you don't target like the wolf of Wall Street did
[46:24.280 --> 46:28.320]  rich people and I was sitting there watching the movie last night with
[46:28.320 --> 46:33.960]  Weldon and Gucci Artie and at the end I said watch I haven't followed his story
[46:33.960 --> 46:38.200]  I know something about it let's go look it up he targeted rich people and they
[46:38.200 --> 46:42.480]  sick the FBI on him because you could steal a trillion dollars and and the FBI
[46:42.480 --> 46:45.560]  would do nothing they're told who they can go after by the Justice Department
[46:45.560 --> 46:49.280]  it's literally run by these people and we went and looked it up and there it was
[46:49.280 --> 46:53.440]  in mainline news articles that he went after a billionaire globalist in
[46:53.440 --> 46:58.440]  Alabama banker and basically ripped him off for 25 mil and they and they said
[46:58.440 --> 47:03.000]  you give me that money back or it's over and the wolf of Wall Street told him
[47:03.000 --> 47:07.480]  take a hike and you saw what happened so that's how this works that's the rules
[47:07.480 --> 47:12.800]  with the globalist is you only screw the little guys you don't touch the big
[47:12.800 --> 47:20.160]  guys it's mafia rules and that's how this stuff operates you know it's a true
[47:20.160 --> 47:24.040]  story with Bo Deedle involved in it Bo Deedle even plays himself it's amazing
[47:24.040 --> 47:28.080]  and that's how the world really works ladies and gentlemen I've been taken up
[47:28.080 --> 47:32.400]  to the top of the mountain many times that's what the establishment does and
[47:32.400 --> 47:38.000]  told the public or idiots they don't want your help they would tear you apart
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.720]  in a minute they're worse than we are as the establishment at least we run things
[47:41.720 --> 47:45.520]  to control it and you should join us if you want to try to influence things and
[47:45.520 --> 47:50.360]  have any power because you know we're not all bad and we want you to be part of
[47:50.360 --> 47:55.080]  this and people so why don't you say who did that it's happened many times you
[47:55.080 --> 47:59.040]  know if I do that as a journalist then I won't have people contact me that way
[47:59.040 --> 48:04.560]  they don't do it anymore it's been many many years since I've been offered to
[48:04.560 --> 48:08.520]  sell out to the New World Order I mean I've been contacted by some high-powered
[48:08.520 --> 48:11.680]  folks and they said if you you know just back off a little you're gonna be more
[48:11.680 --> 48:15.880]  successful and all the rest of it but I mean I'm way past that folks I'm way
[48:15.880 --> 48:20.040]  past ever even be able to think about compromising any I mean I realize that
[48:20.040 --> 48:24.360]  this system's coming down and this system's pure evil and I spiritually
[48:24.360 --> 48:28.680]  don't want to be connected to it in any way now nobody's perfect corruptions
[48:28.680 --> 48:32.000]  everywhere and you could literally kill yourself trying to you know be like
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.480]  Jesus but I'm a man I'm not perfect but I morally try to be good and there's a
[48:36.480 --> 48:39.720]  difference between trying to be morally good trying to be accurate trying to be
[48:39.720 --> 48:45.720]  right controlling your more worldly cunning side even though you want to
[48:45.720 --> 48:48.400]  defeat people that have done wrong things to you and turn on the other
[48:48.400 --> 48:51.720]  cheek which I found is very very successful if you can turn the other
[48:51.720 --> 48:56.560]  cheek and the fight doesn't really matter that always turns out better now
[48:56.560 --> 48:59.320]  if someone corners you it's a different situation we're going to go to break

[55:10.000 --> 55:16.200]  air go ahead yeah plus Alex this is an honor I was a real estate analyst at
[55:16.200 --> 55:22.680]  Tony Rescoe's bank in Chicago Barack Obama was literally a crook when he was
[55:22.680 --> 55:26.920]  a senator three years before he was elected president oh yeah that all came
[55:26.920 --> 55:31.920]  out they're total gangsters yeah go ahead right Tony Rescoe's doing a seven
[55:31.920 --> 55:35.800]  and a half year stretch right now he's about three and a half years into it so
[55:35.800 --> 55:41.560]  he's in the joint for a long time Rescoe paid 6.25 for land that was worth
[55:41.560 --> 55:46.840]  only half a million and then on that same day Obama from the same seller bought
[55:46.840 --> 55:51.400]  the mansion next door no I know that that even came out news but you're saying
[55:51.400 --> 55:56.360]  you worked at the bank and saw all that yeah no Rescoe went to jail basically for
[55:56.360 --> 56:00.920]  the exact same stuff Obama was doing and they were two ponies in the stable for
[56:00.920 --> 56:08.680]  governor or senator El Presidente by Axelrod right and Rod Bogovic is all
[56:08.680 --> 56:12.800]  in the middle of it and he's doing a big stretch 14 years Rod Bogovic is in
[56:12.800 --> 56:20.440]  Colorado right now for 14 years the FBI met with me about Obama and there was
[56:20.440 --> 56:26.000]  possibly a grand jury against Obama Obama could be in the quink right now he
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.200]  really literally could be in prison right now as opposed to living in the
[56:29.200 --> 56:34.720]  White House and that's what I met with the FBI about he took a hundred and
[56:34.720 --> 56:41.120]  twenty five thousand dollar kickback from a guy who's in prison right now well I
[56:41.120 --> 56:44.800]  know a lot of that came out and you sound credible and again I'm not saying
[56:44.800 --> 56:48.520]  all the FBI agents are bad themselves there they try to do investigations and
[56:48.520 --> 56:52.720]  they get blocked like I'm fast and furious by the guy involved in it John
[56:52.720 --> 56:58.120]  you know Attorney General Eric Holder was thinking of John P. Holdren another
[56:58.120 --> 57:02.880]  you know guy in the White House running all sorts of nasty operations and I mean
[57:02.880 --> 57:09.760]  it's well known that Chicago's Total Mafia run where is all this going now
[57:09.760 --> 57:16.200]  well I was interviewed by Jerome Corsi and the Washington Times and several
[57:16.200 --> 57:20.960]  other sources and there's really not much other than I have a key Tam lawsuit
[57:20.960 --> 57:26.920]  against the bank they were running a massive rank appearing scheme to defraud
[57:26.920 --> 57:32.120]  the FDIC and it's much bigger a lot of these banks the lapses that you're
[57:32.120 --> 57:38.760]  seeing were intentional looting of the banks including Rezco's bank you know
[57:38.760 --> 57:44.440]  Obama had to know what was going on at Rezco's bank Rezco was his best friend
[57:44.440 --> 57:49.440]  it's actually him and his wife that's right and Rezco did get what is it ten
[57:49.440 --> 57:53.600]  and a half years there it is in the Chicago Sun Times you know I'm glad you
[57:53.600 --> 57:56.920]  called in about that subject people go watch a movie like the Wolf and Wall
[57:56.920 --> 58:00.480]  Street that they say is incredibly accurate down to the smallest details
[58:00.480 --> 58:05.600]  and they go how could someone be that wild and crazy this guy's a good guy
[58:05.600 --> 58:09.960]  compared to these sharks from what I've studied no the Wolf of Wall Street got
[58:09.960 --> 58:13.320]  burned because he went after big guys and I'm not defending him he's a monster
[58:13.320 --> 58:18.080]  but compared to these people I mean they're involved in everything folks they
[58:18.080 --> 58:23.360]  get money off the kids that get taken by CPS all over the country that money goes
[58:23.360 --> 58:27.600]  through the big orphanage groups they literally are kidnappers the government
[58:27.600 --> 58:31.440]  is criminal you may live in a county or city that's not totally criminal but it

[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.920]  hank oh hello mr. jills how are you doing pretty good brother what's on your
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:47.000]  mind today oh nothing i just want to thank you for all the stuff you've done
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.640]  to wake everybody up and another thing is my father about a year ago he still
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.040]  is the cheapest security in a major courthouse out here and I told him to
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:03.320]  go to infowar.com three weeks later the whole courthouse was taken over by
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:06.600]  Homeland Security and that's who he works for now I was just wondering if you
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:11.000]  had knowledge about that sir well I know that the feds are pretty much
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.920]  outright federalizing county city states they get the county and the city to go
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.920]  along with it the state to stand down they completely take it over and in
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:25.520]  areas they control they're doing that and then you have to remember the feds
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:30.080]  themselves are run by the offshore globalists so this is an occupation but
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:36.480]  no I was not aware of your particular area oh all right well I appreciate it
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:42.240]  I just didn't know if I was a conspiracy theorist or not and thank you sir and
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:47.880]  everybody should listen to alex jones thank you bye thanks a lot buddy you

[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.800]  Lauren in California go ahead hi Alex thank you for taking my call my husband
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.280]  and I are some of those people who have lost their health insurance due to
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:15.200]  obozo care we both had policies that were affordable that had you know a
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:22.040]  $12,000 premium now the premium excuse me deductible the $12,000 deductible now
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:27.200]  the premiums have quadrupled so it's more than a house payment for both of us
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:33.120]  and each of us has a $40,000 deductible needless to say we don't have health
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.880]  insurance and they don't care that's fine now they'll just come after your bank
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.640]  account and garnish your wages and take your tax refund as they're now
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.960]  announcing doesn't that sound like affordable care act to you of course not
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.880]  yeah you know and so we just take responsibility for our health I do we do
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.200]  the Nathan Iedine you have it's a great product thank you so much for it and we
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:00.920]  see a chiropractor once a month and I have not been sick in over 20 years well
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.960]  I tell you they're trying to shut down supplements this year they've announced
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.440]  that just across the board they've already done it to a great extent in
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:11.080]  Europe under codex elementarius they are going after the chiropractors they're
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.160]  going after even clinics that have medical doctors that are staying outside
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:20.640]  the system it is a total takeover I mean we saw a case in Texas it was in the
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:27.040]  news where Humana went up 539% on a family my dad's premiums have now
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.440]  doubled mine have gone way up with Blue Cross Blue Shield I need to do a
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:37.720]  piece on that showing my own insurance and it's just such a loving thing they
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:42.040]  did for us actually it's totally sick do you think they can get away with this
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:47.800]  no no I think there's a major revolution coming and the interesting thing is I
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:53.140]  work part-time at a hospital and nobody there is happy and I talked to the
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:56.880]  little people I don't talk to the head honchos I talked to the little people
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.840]  because they're my friends and they're not happy they're always in their
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.080]  insurance and they are hospital staff well you know what the Obama
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.680]  administration MSNBC and a professor yesterday said they said that's because
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:15.080]  you're racist I mean if you're white you're the reason Obama care isn't
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:20.840]  working so do you want to apologize for people not being able to get surgery and
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:26.240]  stuff because it's your fault nope I know it isn't your fault and that's how
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:31.680]  crazy it is that they then arrogantly blame us and say it's our fault thank

[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.360]  Church basically promote abortion so there is that news I mentioned this
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.900]  yesterday but it's so important tying into the all the other news that we see
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:08.160]  feds preparing for violence targeting social security buildings $58 million
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.680]  for security just at two facilities that is such a big deal and here's why
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:19.820]  they're getting ready IMF paper warns of savings tax and mass write-offs as West
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:27.560]  debt hits 200 year high hyperinflation looming much of the western world will
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:33.320]  require defaults and savings tax and higher inflation to clear the way for
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:36.960]  recovery so they've decided to go the way of inflation as debt levels reach
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.960]  at 200 year high according to a new report by their national monetary fund
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:48.480]  and of course they're the authors of much of that so what do you what do you
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:55.840]  expect so that's just some of the news on that front we're gonna be breaking
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:01.240]  that down more coming up also we're gonna be looking at citing EU Italy
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.360]  orders journalist to promote homosexual agenda that's out of the New
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:12.040]  American magazine and Lifesite news broke it and remember Reuters reported
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:16.040]  along with AFP two days ago that they ruled that a 60 year old man can grab
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:20.920]  your 11 year old child out of the backyard and rape them and if the child
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:26.240]  tells social workers they enjoyed it it's love and you get let out of jail so
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.360]  they're coming for our kids and if you don't let them do it it's gonna be
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.400]  pedophobia and they're gonna come kill you the SWAT teams are so I'm serious
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.920]  they're banning homeschooling worldwide they're hunting down Christians it's
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:42.640]  here it's here and this is this pure evil agenda of agenda 21 which is
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.680]  basically what the Jacob and French try to do in the French Revolution the
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.200]  opposite of our revolution overthrow the family overthrow God have a nine day
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:56.840]  week change the calendar just turn loose total evil on earth that is their
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:06.080]  goal that is what they push that is what they stand for so we are going to be
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:14.320]  breaking all of this and more down today for most of the hour we're joined by
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:18.600]  Charlotte Isherby the best-selling author and it's a bit out of print but
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:21.400]  she's coming up with a smaller edition now the deliberate dumbing down of
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.440]  America it's still very thick with all these graphics and documents we sell it
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:31.160]  at infowarstore.com in the book if you want to understand why they're
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:36.840]  dumbing everybody down is close to 500 pages long she was the head of policy
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.920]  number two position at the Department of Education in the Ronald Reagan
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:46.360]  administration and she was leading educator and also her was a dad and
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.000]  grandfather been in skull and bones so she was also a kind of an insider she's
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.440]  also the lady that leaked all the stuff to Anthony Sutton that exposed skull and
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:58.960]  bones and you know also her dad and you know grandfather were good guys and
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:02.760]  everybody there was was bad in fact her dad told her about that so the whole
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.600]  point is is that there's not all bad people in the system and there's always
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.120]  time to expose what's going on but she's a whistleblower's whistleblower
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:16.640]  whistleblower and I wanted to get her on she also has a new DVD set out that we
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.440]  don't sell yet but but is available on her site we'll tell you how to get that
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:25.680]  exposing the global road to ruin through education and this is shot in 2012 2013
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:32.520]  at two conferences all educators need to see this to understanding what they've
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:36.840]  done and then she has another booklet out for educators back to basics reform or
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:42.080]  OBE skinnered international curriculum now we've gotten her on about the master
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:47.120]  plan and what's behind it where it's going but in her book she shows the
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:50.800]  government documents where they said by the time they're done with it your child
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.680]  won't be able to talk and they admit they call it brainwashing in Department
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:01.520]  of Education graphics cartoons they did just like the NSA documents came out
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:07.280]  this week where they were calling iPhone users dumb zombies and laughing at how
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:12.200]  they'd turned America in 1984 so it shows them slowly federalizing the
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:18.000]  schools and then making the kids mean and dumb down and turning it into big
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.120]  brother national information distribution center imperial international
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.600]  propaganda system that's the youth brigades our lady of the nebulant
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:29.320]  dictatorship one world global training corps and then interplanetary carbon
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:36.240]  unit reprogramming pod this is from the 80s literal biological Android look
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:42.360]  he's happy now and he's plugged into a computer show and again we're going to
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:47.880]  bring a moment her Skype just dropped but but that's the point of what's
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:55.200]  going on with this book of this material so without further ado ladies and
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.800]  gentlemen this is a total takeover 2 plus 2 equals 5 teach 5 year olds how to
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.360]  be transgender if they can get away with that they can do anything that's what
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.680]  this is the school says your child can be vaccinated against your will or have
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:12.200]  an abortion against your will this is the state taking over as MSNBC has said
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:17.440]  Ohio with bills to basically outlaw homeschooling since CPS after everybody
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:22.720]  they're coming they're coming but we can push back if we recognize they're not
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.160]  misguided liberals and they've got the Republican leadership with them and
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:32.200]  Bill Gates these are scientific takeover experts okay joining us is Charlotte
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:37.360]  thank you so much for coming on break down the basics and then get into common
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:43.760]  core for people to understand it well Alex I'm very pleased that everybody's
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:49.240]  focusing on I'm not pleased that much I think it's normal that parents would be
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:55.640]  focusing on common core and there's a lot of money out there supporting their
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:00.560]  focus from the Neoconservative Trotskyites it's a big bandwagon across
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:06.760]  the country to keep parents and teachers focused on common core we've had
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.000]  common core ever since certainly the 1970s it came out of the original goals
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.040]  which are standards right came out of the Northwest Regional Lab and that's in
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:20.600]  my little book back to basics reform actually the information there which was
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.600]  let's just point out that everything I've ever written the reason that nobody
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:30.760]  knows what happened is that everything I ever wrote was boycotted not by
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:36.160]  normally you know the leftward but by the Neoconservative Trotskyites every
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.040]  single organization in this country boycotted my back to basics reform which
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.480]  I wrote after I got myself fired from the Department of that full of
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:49.680]  documentation warning Americans of exactly what's happening now that little
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:56.000]  book only $10 and then I wrote deliberate dumbing down of America because
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.560]  that little book was boycotted people said they didn't understand it huh so then
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:07.760]  I wrote the biggie 700 pages that was boycotted but is a free download at
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.480]  deliberate dumbing down.com so there's no excuse for any American or foreigner
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:16.080]  for that matter because the foreigners know that that book is correct too I had
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.680]  a I had an interesting email yesterday from a teacher in Bosnia who asked how
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:25.200]  we could possibly get it into more languages the deliberate dumbing down
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.200]  America but anyway they boycotted boycotted then they boycotted the
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.720]  US Soviet Education Agreement information I got out they boycotted the
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:38.240]  latest a bridge version which you're selling right the deliberate dumbing
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:43.240]  down America because they don't want anybody to know that it's not common
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:49.520]  core it's unelected board it's brought about by school choice funded with your
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:54.440]  tax money they don't want anybody to know that that's the issue that is the
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.800]  issue believe it or not even I can't believe it that is going to bring our
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:05.960]  country down when private education religious education and homeschool
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:15.680]  education accepts a tax month one penny of tax money to run their schools they
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:21.040]  will be completely controlled even if they kill common core they will have to
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:27.120]  put it in anyway because they won't have any elected boards well Charlotte let me
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.920]  quantify what you just said so eloquently because as a parent I've
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:34.240]  experienced it they wreck public education federalize it globalize it
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.640]  that's the common core but they've already gotten all the private schools
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:44.520]  and most the homeschoolers to adopt common core I can't find a homeschool
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.400]  academy or a Christian school that doesn't literally have the handouts from
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.520]  Michelle Obama on what my kids should eat they've taken just like with the
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:56.400]  churches and the new freedom initiatives with the pharmaceuticals and the
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.320]  faith-based initiative they've already taken it almost all over and now they're
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:06.000]  saying they're going to hunt down the true homeschoolers go ahead oh absolutely
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.640]  and I want people they've really got to go and get this eight discs at their
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:16.480]  seven discs or videos presentations about 18 hours of videotaping of the
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:20.880]  leading we call them and most respected education researchers in the country
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.760]  over the past 50 years we had one marvelous feature come in from
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.320]  California to Maine last year who fought the planning programming budgeting
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:35.520]  management system which is really total quality management which took over all
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:41.000]  the schools of America and turned them into brainwashing factories marvelous
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.920]  gal she's still fighting and she does a beautiful presentation Mary Thompson is
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.720]  her name we have Samuel Blumenfeld dealing with the fact that all the
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.660]  Rockefeller brothers can't read because they went through they went to the
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:59.440]  Lincoln School in New York which didn't have them starting to read until they
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.120]  were probably in second or third grade and taught them the wrong way because
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:09.440]  it was all John Dewey marvelous what Blumenfeld has there my son can read
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:13.520]  when he was three so could my dad please don't tell me because I've got problems
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:18.720]  in my own family where reading is not being a chore at an early age and it
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:24.040]  should be we've got Rosa Corey came in because she's the course agenda 21
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:28.840]  we met Rosa for the first time last year and she did a wonderful we've got a
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:34.800]  wonderful presentation by Rosa we've got Kelly Nelson she absolutely blows the
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:40.600]  whistle for a good hour on the Trotsky I neoconservatives who have been behind
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:45.040]  this agenda let's explain it they wreck they federalize and wreck public
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:49.560]  schools which is the fire then they throw us into neocon corporate schools
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:53.480]  that are hell itself all by design they've wrecked the public schools now
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.680]  they're gonna move on to everything else while saying we're running from

[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.000]  Charlotte Isherby is our guest about 50 after then I'll take your phone calls that are holding
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.640]  we have another guest coming up look at the black genocide program taking place
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:23.400]  here in the US by the left particularly Quebec study concealed carry results in
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:30.520]  fewer murders these results suggest that restrictive concealed weapons laws may
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:35.240]  cause an increase in gun related murders at that level and that is the
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:40.280]  government of Quebec meanwhile you have the head of Interpol coming out a few
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.040]  months ago and saying the answer is arming the general public 2 plus 2
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:48.920]  equals 4 in the real world but in common core land affordable care act
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.000]  triples your health care and lowers your quality and lets the government share
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.720]  your data or Chicago takes all the guns crime rate goes up this is why they
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:03.600]  have to dumb you down so that common sense can be basically abolish that's
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.560]  what they talk about 1984 under Ingsock or English socialism was the plan which
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:14.920]  was a real plan by the way as part of the Fabian Socialist Eric Blair aka of
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:19.280]  course George Arwell was to restrict the language down to nothing to basically
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:25.200]  grunts or plus or minus or double plus or triple plus or triple minus just
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:30.240]  chirping like a parrot this is the Scenarian brainwashing that Charlotte
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:35.480]  is there be as a pioneer along with John Taylor Goddow and others exposing it
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:39.000]  and if you realize they've wrecked public education they're bringing in total
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.680]  increased brainwashing it's just it's gotten so crazy now here's how to dress
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:47.280]  here's how to have anal sex there's two plus two equals equals five that that's
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.520]  why people are freaking out over Common Core but then the answer they say is
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:55.080]  good is is are these Bill and Melinda Gates takeovers so Charlotte continue
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:58.960]  breaking down what's really happening well I'd like to point out for the
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.320]  people researching Common Core that in the mid 70s you know they think that what
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:07.680]  they've got is bad in the mid 70s we had health education here in Maine and it
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:13.280]  required the students to know the three types of sexual intercourse including
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:19.000]  with animals okay now let's go let's go past that folks look what you have now
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.040]  it's Marx's curriculum it's no different from what was planned in 1934 by the
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.640]  Carnegie Corporation and it's at americand deception.com the book is
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:34.640]  called conclusions and recommendations for the social studies just type the
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.800]  word conclusions in there and read that book where they say right there that the
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:44.800]  Carnegie Corporation and other tax exams foundations would use the schools to
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:50.840]  change America to a planned economy and it even talks about taking our land so
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:58.000]  wait now let's not get down and you know just focusing all our attention on
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.560]  Common Core we can't do that we've got to get into the real research and that is
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:09.120]  what the eight disc project is all about you have not only the video tech
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:13.800]  presentations of all these great people but you have written submissions from
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:20.320]  people like Ed Griffin who interviewed Norman Dodd who was told in that
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:25.440]  interview Norman Dodd was told by the Ford Foundation had Gaither that they
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.920]  were meant to use their money the tax exempt foundations to use their money
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:34.040]  to merge the United States with the Soviet Union which is exactly what is
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:38.440]  happening now because the curriculum that is going in nobody can challenge me
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:46.400]  on this is all Soviet Polytech workforce training for a global economy to spin
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:52.960]  off profits for the global elite to use your children and that is exactly what's
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:57.480]  been going on ever since the beginning of the last century tragedy and hope
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:01.960]  quickly pointed it out in tragedy and hope most important thing to remember
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:07.720]  of all once you get that in your head you got it both parties are the same at
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:13.280]  the top they have the identical agenda look when you have Lou Gershner former
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:22.760]  IBM Arndt Duncan leftist head of department event Obama and that the
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:28.480]  tax except Heritage Foundation conservative that drafted the North
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:34.600]  American free trade agreement when you have all of them on board on Common Core
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:37.720]  they say they're opposed to it but they're not because they need it for
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.160]  school choice you need school choice because those are little charter schools
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:46.320]  that are international by the way they're not new they're in Russia they're
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:51.040]  called contract schools they're in bed with the corporations the whole thing
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:55.840]  is a public-private merger you can call it whatever you want communism
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:00.760]  socialism fascism communitarianism that's what it is and it came out of the
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:05.240]  White House I'm sorry to tell you Ronald Reagan I was the liaison with the
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:09.960]  White House for public-private partnerships that was the one agreement
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:17.120]  one project that allowed the school to work agenda to move forward bringing the
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.760]  corporations into our schools to decide who's gonna do this who's gonna do that
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:26.160]  etc it had we haven't gotten into the actual workforce training yet we're
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.600]  into the brainwashing now that's Common Core out of UNESCO by the way Common
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:36.600]  Core mm-hmm okay that's where we're at all right we're gonna come back and talk
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:40.520]  more about that ladies and gentlemen but it's so essential people understand
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:43.800]  we're not an even endorsing the public schools when they were local that was a
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.920]  different thing they've taken them federalized them now they're wrecking it
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:51.200]  and giving the alternative they're tyranny we're on the march the
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:30:01.240]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network why does the United
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:05.360]  States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care why do
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.800]  we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:16.480]  autism and every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:21.560]  we eat our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:26.960]  our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff all of this has

[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.840]  the workers
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.760]  the strikers
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:25.440]  the builders
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:28.920]  these are our people
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:32.240]  who are they?
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.080]  they are the dark armies
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:38.800]  the dark murdering armies was only honor
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.160]  it was atrocity
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:45.680]  the answer to 1984
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:50.680]  is 1776
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:56.960]  more listening to the alex jimmy show
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:04.120]  going back to charlotte israbe the greatest education whistleblower ever
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:07.480]  and there she was they had a policy the department of education
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:10.000]  of course ronald reagan was just a figurehead
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.840]  but the system was there using that agenda that's why they get more done
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:17.560]  when republicans are in power for socialism and gun control
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:21.520]  than they even get when democrats are in except now with obama
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.000]  i mean i hate to think what the next one's going to be like is they've turned
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:24.920]  the office
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:27.200]  into a dictatorship but i want to ask charlotte
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:30.480]  where we're going if we don't turn this around here in a moment
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:33.720]  what's frustrating is when you've read the carney endowment documents
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:37.080]  when you've read the committee hearings from congress
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.480]  you can go to her websites they have the books for free
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.840]  including books written by globalist
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:46.360]  in one case she was offered basically unlimited millions of dollars
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:49.480]  to get to turn over a book that they were able to secure
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:52.120]  their inside connections because the globalist right these books
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.560]  that are only for top technicians
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.920]  like tragedy and hope
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:58.280]  and we're going to talk about that when we go back to her
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:00.440]  uh... but but it's all up on the sites
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.360]  where they lay it all out it's not like i know what's coming because i just
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:07.000]  had a vision at two a.m
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.520]  that's what's frustrating
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:12.360]  they literally in the eighties were saying humans will be known as carbon
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.560]  units and won't be able to talk
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.720]  if we let you live
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:20.600]  i mean these people it is so mega evil
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:24.440]  that that is hard to believe but it's all happening and by the way
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.560]  we saw the book behind the green mask that she was mentioning is interviewed
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:28.800]  in her film
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.320]  in in her eight-day set
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:33.360]  with rosa quarry and it's the best little primer breaking it down but it's
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.200]  total
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:36.560]  enslavement through the economy
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.360]  where the globalist are above the law and exempt from all their laws it is
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:44.360]  absolute discrimination of the greatest magnitude
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:48.920]  now briefly ladies and gentlemen we are running out of the proprietary pure
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.040]  nascent iodine that is just on wonders for myself my family in the thyroid
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:57.600]  that protects you from a lot of these isotopes
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:01.200]  we haven't sold out of it in a month we are basically going to be sold out of
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:03.280]  it keeps selling like it is by monday

[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.560]  going back to
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:22.160]  uh... charlotte israeli who was the head of policy
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:24.760]  department of education in the nineteen eighties
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:25.680]  and
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.800]  was able
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:29.480]  to get this information in her book
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:32.000]  the deliberate coming down of america
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.640]  that breaks down what's happening but again the globalist will use their own
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:37.560]  created crisis
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:39.120]  to bring in the solution
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:41.560]  it's not that the government-run education's good
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.240]  it's that their solution
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:45.960]  is bill along the gates foundation carney endowment
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.440]  forage foundation
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.560]  to come in
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:52.320]  and it's the same stuff that's being taught in the public schools they just
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.520]  take the best students and say aren't you lucky
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.080]  and then you pay to put your kids in a brainwashing camp
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.960]  uh... so again they wrecked the schools they know you're going to go
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.200]  to run they've got the next camp
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.480]  uh... charlotte keep breaking it down
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:10.120]  well i'd like to point out that there's going to be absolutely no there's
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:14.280]  there's no difference between what they want to put in under the
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:18.080]  charter schools that tax uh... supported private education to complete
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:20.320]  takeover of private education
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:23.480]  and destruction of the public school system
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:27.320]  because the charter schools are pulling the students out of the public school
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.000]  system
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.960]  uh... i i've never wanted to send public education i do have a lot of teachers
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:36.000]  because i know what they've what they've had to be what they've had to go through
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.840]  through the years and so much
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:41.520]  of exposing the global road to ruin education
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.560]  we have interviews with public school teachers
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.680]  that's why it makes it so special
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:51.200]  the people involved in this product of ours are not affiliated with any
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.840]  political group in this country
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:55.280]  we are all independent
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.560]  we've been working with public school teachers
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:01.440]  we have an administrator right from austin texas you know who gives out the
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:04.920]  information on what they're doing in austin with the charter schools
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:07.280]  but what i want to point out here is
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.640]  that our disk set
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.760]  has a recommendation in it
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:14.120]  exposing the global road to ruin through education which you can get it
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:15.360]  amazon
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:18.800]  or at my website click on amazon link there
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:22.400]  has the uh... one of the last disk i believe
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.680]  has a tool kit
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:26.000]  a to-do list
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.040]  what we can do to take back america now i don't know of any other product out
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.120]  there
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:36.160]  that really has a list with twenty four twenty five items on it
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.000]  it can be done
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.040]  but you're going to have to understand
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.880]  we're between a rock and a hard place
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:46.320]  the rock is really lethal
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:48.680]  that is the corporate side
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:50.200]  with the governors
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:51.680]  with the president
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.600]  with the heritage foundation
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.600]  with all of the phony trotsky i'd say by the way alex i don't believe reagan
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:00.000]  was a figurehead
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.960]  he was very deeply involved in signing the agreements for the soviet union he
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:06.200]  was in must go he did it
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:09.720]  and current the greatest educator i want to get rid of his own office in the
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:12.960]  apartment the n i e was fired by reagan
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:17.600]  i can't defend reagan on this but i don't define one single president since
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.240]  college
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.960]  i don't know i'm not saying i mean he was known as red ronnie when he was a communist before he became
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:26.960]  a supposed conservative you might charlotte mentioned to people
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:29.320]  who the trotsky i'd sorry for those that don't know

[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.600]  the neoconservative movement and took over
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:40.400]  and he was responsible for killing four million russians too if people
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:43.800]  would like to know that now in the disc set there's one
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:44.880]  flower
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:49.280]  kelly nelson from tennessee who's been researching the phony right

[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:01.760]  well yeah that that's true
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:03.280]  but what i was going to say
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:07.840]  is lea shulman the professor involved in the chicago master learning disaster
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:11.400]  which was referred to our education week is as a human
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:14.400]  uh... disaster of enormous proportions
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:19.160]  that man is working with the catholic education association
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:22.720]  to put common core into the catholic schools
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.080]  hispan

[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:29.520]  schools
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:32.400]  between nineteen seventy and nineteen eighty
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:35.280]  but charlotte let's be clear it's not a disaster as you know
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:37.600]  in the documents it is planned
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:41.920]  absolutely every single thing is planned and i hope that inner city minority
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:44.080]  people are listening to this today
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:45.640]  because they were used
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:46.600]  again
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:49.920]  they're always used the whole integration thing managed to use them
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:54.400]  and i might point out alex talking about the order you know

[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:11.160]  but i found i found another smoking gun there
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:13.560]  and he was very responsible
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:18.480]  for the black experimentation on the blacks so-called integration and all
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.520]  and uh...
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:24.120]  it's uh... absolutely amazing that
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:27.680]  that i hadn't i had not found this before and i'm so excited about it i can't
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:29.160]  remember his name right now
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:32.160]  but it is in the book it's in the uh...
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.920]  it's in one of one of the little little black books
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:39.000]  and he came after francis keppel and he was a commissioner
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.120]  and i'm looking right now for the papers on him and i can't find it
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.960]  what's important is on your website to give those out you have a lot of the
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:47.640]  books and stuff totally free
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:49.280]  including their books
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:51.760]  that they fought to not have you publish
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:54.560]  uh... online tell folks about some of those books
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.240]  well yes uh...
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:00.760]  uh... the what it actually was the recent committee hearings three thousand pages
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:01.880]  as a book yeah
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:06.520]  this committee hearings that i i bought from uh... someone who worked for the
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:10.600]  uh... intelligence committee for that committee that uh... did the
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:13.160]  investigation of the tax attempt foundations
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:17.320]  and i finally bought it but he's the one that was offered any amount of money
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.400]  by the minions of the foundations
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:21.640]  uh... for that one copy
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:24.720]  because they didn't want the american people to know what had gone on during
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:27.280]  those hearings and i mentioned earlier
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:29.800]  you know that uh... the uh...
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:32.800]  the important give the website up as we're gonna go to the site and show
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:35.040]  people on tv right now not just radio
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:38.440]  we're going to show them that document so they can go and get it because it
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:39.320]  shouldn't just
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:43.600]  sit there is so important people especially academics and educators
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:47.480]  and policy wonks should really go read their own blueprint
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:51.760]  and understand their part of the systematic destruction of the mind
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:56.800]  well i said american deception dot com and it's a you can type in dot normand
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:00.000]  dot or uh... investigation
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.760]  and the other the other important document that isn't as long
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:07.400]  is the one that the conclusions and recommendations for the social studies
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:08.560]  nineteen thirty four
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:11.200]  i call that the smoking gun
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:13.560]  that is i talked about it earlier
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.760]  i get people get bored with me
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:19.480]  that's carnegis plan to use the schools
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:21.440]  to change america's
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:24.720]  capitalist economic system and they even talk about
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:29.600]  taking our land and carnegis from that time on nineteen thirty four
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:31.720]  three five years gave money to
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:33.520]  education commission of states
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:36.320]  the national assessment okay common core people
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:39.920]  national assessment that's it that's you're dealing with
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.920]  the education commission of states
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:44.640]  the agreements with the soviet union
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:49.320]  with the carnegis agreement with the soviet academy of science
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.360]  to develop
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:52.040]  computer courseware
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:55.440]  in critical thinking which is marx's thinking by the way i've seen the
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:58.120]  calhoun reader uh... put out
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:01.000]  was about a decade ago the university of texas is using for social workers we
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.480]  showed it on air
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:06.360]  and it was bob daisy actually uh... uh... uh... brought it to me because i'm
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:07.880]  going from every one of his sons
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:11.600]  uh... was going to school to be a police officer which is now state police and
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:15.800]  uh... he so he had to read this and it said we're gonna get rid of the family
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.720]  it belongs to an arcane age i'm quoting that
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:22.320]  i mean this is the type of crazy stuff
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:25.720]  they openly say we're getting rid of the family it's bad
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:30.160]  well nobody and nobody believes that i have to point out there is no way for
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:31.920]  the american people
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:33.640]  to turn this thing around
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:36.280]  unless they have history
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:39.040]  now i did the history for them in the deliberate coming down
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.680]  and it's there it's free as a download that's good
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:44.640]  they can get the hard copy at at your site
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.840]  and it ends up
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:49.400]  the most important one we've done
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:52.000]  why would i go to the trouble
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.640]  uh... the last two years putting this together is exposing
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:57.240]  the global road to ruin
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:58.800]  through education
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:01.560]  it is definitely because it gives
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:03.880]  gives americans a toolkit
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:04.960]  to go out
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:06.800]  show these tanks
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:10.160]  to your neighbors to ministers to businessmen especially
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.800]  who have no idea they're gonna be going out of business if they don't take money
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:14.480]  from the government right
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.680]  to educate
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:17.280]  schoolteachers
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:21.160]  school pollin schoolteachers forget it all go on everybody sort of knows they
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:22.840]  were gonna teach for america
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.600]  these brainwashed
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:26.360]  college kids coming in
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.760]  to monitor on the computer okay
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:32.760]  now but go please i plead with you
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.360]  this is the last product that you'll get out of me
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:40.120]  i tried so hard with how many different publications and everything to get this
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:42.240]  word out
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:45.920]  the america you know it's good that uh... deliberate going down is a free download
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:49.240]  that's great you could go there cut past sense now but charlotte you have
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:50.480]  fought so
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:52.960]  hard you don't need to do this for the money
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:56.480]  you know you're successful business in your life in your in your late husband
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:57.440]  everything you've done
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:00.800]  you fought for it's got to be fifty years for education
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:03.760]  and you've done so much and it was for people like you they would have already
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:04.680]  won
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:08.680]  and exactly we're not saying public education in common core good
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:10.280]  they've already wrecked that
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:14.440]  now they're taking over all the other we need true local schools
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:19.520]  true local private true local public we need true local homeschooling and i've
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:20.400]  seen it
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:24.200]  you cannot find homeschooling groups you cannot find homeschooling academies
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:27.840]  you cannot find any private schools or churches we go to mega churches we go to
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:31.240]  small churches they're all preaching government doctrine i talked to the
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:33.920]  preachers they admit they're basically government stages
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:36.400]  i mean this is so deep it's so bad
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:42.240]  alice look let me point out our recommendation is to restructure rebuild
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:43.880]  the public school system
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:46.720]  because it is less lethal
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:49.720]  then what we're looking at on the other side the other side is the end of
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:51.280]  freedom for america
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:53.680]  all right well we're gonna have to have you back on the research this morning
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.600]  so much phone calls folks are coming up for two segments
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:00.800]  then another guest on the black genocide agenda
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:05.160]  the facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:08.920]  members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:13.800]  ability of the american people so why are the social engineers adding it to the
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:14.440]  water
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:18.800]  simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:23.400]  feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride on the water supply yet but

[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:12.640]  i was a highway man along the coach roads i did ride
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:17.680]  with sword and pistol by my side
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:23.600]  many a young maid lost her bobbles to my tray
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:29.280]  many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:34.720]  the master taught me in the spring of 25
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:38.720]  but i am still alive see the issue is they wreck everything
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:42.240]  and they they get control of everything and now these foundations
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:45.680]  are going to get all the property taxes
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:48.880]  which is what they've always wanted to do they socialize it and wreck it
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:52.560]  then they corporatize it and make it fascist after that's how the globalists
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:55.040]  operate they create socialism and communism
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:57.360]  things collapse and they come in and reorganize
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:02.000]  under corporatism that's not really free market and that's what they're doing
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.840]  but as for me my children are a hundred percent homeschooled
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:11.120]  and they're just done with the system because it doesn't matter where you go
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:16.000]  folks the culture is falling to evil the culture is falling to tyranny
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.360]  and i support what ron paul's doing the move towards
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.720]  true homeschooling uh and who cares if it's
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.560]  homeschools want to be accredited so they all go into an accredited program
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:28.720]  which puts you under government control and surveillance
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:31.680]  to go to a college where you're never going to get a job in the future
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:35.120]  a whole new world's coming of nanotech robots
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:38.240]  knowing how the world really works is going to be the value in the future
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:42.480]  knowing how to skin a buck run a trot line grow a garden
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:46.640]  be in the underground economy to know how to live outside the system but in it
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:49.920]  as much as you can outside the system but still in it
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:53.520]  of the system but not part of it you understand living in both worlds and
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:57.120]  it's going to be a wild time coming
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:00.480]  i mean i've just got to get an herb garden going and learn how to produce
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:03.840]  my own herbs and you name it and stockpile stuff

[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:32.480]  saying they have biological nanotech now
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:35.520]  they have other forms of nanotech where they can just literally have a drone
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:39.680]  fly over sprinkle it over it grows and the doctors then say there's
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:41.600]  something there but we can't tell what it is

[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:55.040]  hey alex hey buddy um you know i can i i can usually deal with all this
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:58.720]  police state and i'm a fine i'm thinking population and the massive
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:01.680]  you know chemical and spiritual attack going on because
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:06.640]  you know i'm awake and i can largely take care of uh myself you know and
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:09.600]  i can control what goes on but it's the targeting of small children by the
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:13.360]  brainwashing that's totally criminal right right you know i can
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:16.560]  control what i subject myself to but when i hear people like
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:20.480]  i guess it was two days ago when shawna at that last caller called in
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:24.080]  and you know her daughter comes on the phone and talks about them trying to
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:26.880]  take her daughter away and that obviously that little girl was
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:31.440]  intelligent or else they would have easily manipulated that situation
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:34.560]  but you know and people like it in fukushima you know all these people
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:37.280]  who have no chance of what's going on they have
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:41.760]  you know here's stuff like that sort of really tears at my heart you know and
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:45.120]  that's the stuff i can't really deal with no and exactly and i was telling
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.520]  that story you know the day after that happened
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:51.440]  i mean they're teaching pedophilia in the schools now they've legalized it in
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:55.280]  italy to literally have people kidnap your kids if you fight back you're a
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:58.880]  pedophob a pedophob i don't know what you call it a pervert
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:03.200]  fob a scumbag fob a child molester fob and if
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:06.320]  you're a child molester fob you're going to jail and it's like they're not just
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:10.720]  going to take our guns they're taking everything and they're coming for us
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:13.920]  and it's just political correctness you can't see anything without being
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:18.400]  crucified or you know hell you know accountable for something that
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:22.400]  that can twist any context any words well the answer is stop letting them
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:25.600]  have the moral authority and say you're a bunch of perverts sicko filth
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:29.040]  it's a badge of honor when you attack us and that's what's beginning to happen
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:33.200]  we can beat these people people have just become such spectators that we just bow
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:36.320]  to authority well when the authority is evil
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:41.360]  it is it is absolute imperative to resist it resistance to tyrants is
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:45.680]  obedience to god i agree i agree i don't i don't back down
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:48.240]  to this though when i hear people trying to single me out

[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:12.560]  they know these are really dumb people that think they're like political
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:15.760]  geniuses who just know how to call you a name
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:20.160]  and then they'll smile like they're a political scientist because they did that
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:24.320]  we need to stop bowing to these people we need to get politically aggressive i
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:28.880]  appreciate your call great points chuck in texas go ahead

[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:46.640]  different way of thinking about guns and then you see the level of fear
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:50.640]  being injected into our schools when a child points his finger in those
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:54.640]  pal no that's brainwashing the federal government is brainwashing

[02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:57.760]  but if they do end up having a ceremony or something sunday i won't be here for
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:01.040]  the four to six p.m show it'll be uh david night we don't do a lot of
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:03.680]  rebroadcasts now when i've got to go out of town
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:06.480]  david night does a great job it's good to have the breaking news
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:09.200]  and information we're going to continue with your phone calls later in the hour
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:12.880]  but chuck in texas was going to finish a brief story
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:16.320]  uh on when he went in under the new government run corporate run
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:20.080]  fraud care and what happened to him because it's all over the news that
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:23.520]  people wait two plus hours for the insurance to authorize emergency
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:27.840]  surgery and so it's just denied frustrated patients walking out of
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:32.640]  hospitals across the nation that's just some of the news breaking
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:38.080]  on that front so very very very very disgusting what's
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:42.560]  happening also there are strange glitches causing
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:46.480]  charges double mortgage payments and customers accounts
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:50.560]  uh i mean it's just going to get crazier uh obama care has been grabbing
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:53.520]  money out of people's accounts i mean they're coming this is just
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:57.840]  legalized total fraud and so we're going to go to reverend children's an
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:00.880]  expert on black genocide going on in this country
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:04.000]  i wanted to get him on to look at that in perspective
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:07.520]  with obama care and the funding of abortion and more and also the
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:11.360]  demonization of the romneys you know making a joke about them having a black
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:15.600]  baby i guess they'd rather the baby be aborted but this just shows just the
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:19.680]  the cynicalness of people like perry on msnbc who
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:22.880]  say the state runs and controls your children we're going to talk to reverend
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:27.280]  children's here in just a moment first off chuck tell your obama care story
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:30.400]  yes sir i just wanted to say that uh yeah i went i went to the emergency room
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:33.520]  under emergency conditions under emergency situation
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:36.800]  i sat there for two and a half hours and finally i told my wife let's go if i
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:39.440]  patch out or something maybe they'll see me if i'm
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:42.560]  unconscious but i went home and then they started seeing trying to send me a
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:47.520]  bill to this doctor that i never saw so i had to threaten to sue these people
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:51.360]  to make them quit sending me a bill for a doctor that i never saw
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:54.800]  so this oposo care thing is a fraud it's all fraud
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:58.720]  and uh you know i don't know what's going to take to stop it but it's clear
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:01.120]  that they're going to make war against cons people and that's exactly what
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:05.920]  they're setting out to do well my father managed partly 200 plus dental
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:10.400]  clinics fully 12 well 24 when he retired this year
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:13.840]  early because he's only 63 because he didn't want to mess with obama care he
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:17.200]  said it made everybody criminal he didn't dot an i across a t in a computer
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:20.240]  program and he said it was in he testified at the
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:25.040]  legislature in texas by the way he said it was written to bankrupt uh
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:28.080]  the small clinics and regional groups that supply the care
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:32.160]  and most of them are all getting out of it just because it is designed
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:36.560]  uh to uh not deliver care and they told him
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:40.320]  him and others but other doctors he interviewed at the state level
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:44.080]  because that's who by law has to manage these these clinics as a doctor
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:47.360]  that's kind of a good lock so it's then not some you know corporate group doing
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:49.680]  it with all the things they've been caught doing
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:53.520]  and they told him basically you work with obama you work with the democrats
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:57.360]  you play ball with us we'll leave you alone and that's how they always operate
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:01.120]  it's kind of like with um general motors five years ago in the bailout when
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:05.680]  it started they would give you someone's
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:12.000]  Chevrolet or gmc or other uh dealership under the gm bailout
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:16.080]  if you were a democratic donor in the car business
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:19.120]  and they would take it away if you were republican
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:22.480]  and they got away with it so why not triple your rates
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:26.880]  why not take kids that are 10 years old 11 years old and give them abortions
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:29.440]  without parental consent why not give inoculations without
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:33.120]  parental consent nationwide even though it's illegal the government is involved
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:37.680]  in a mass criminal orgy to set the president and take over
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:42.720]  i appreciate your call sir yeah this is the new way uh that they do things
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:46.080]  anybody who's a client of the system until it collapses
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:49.600]  illegal aliens you name it they'll get first-rate care immediately
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:53.920]  if you've got perfect insurance like happened to my buddy who's very wealthy
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:57.280]  this last weekend with his young daughter took her to the hospital because
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:00.880]  he had a fever and sinus deal i would have gone to a clinic but a lot of those
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:04.320]  were packed or closed and he shot video he said it's
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:07.440]  to be on my phone i think you may authorize me to put it out later and
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:10.320]  it was all these illegals just going right through just like god
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:14.720]  and i've had it happen to me and but the citizens black white Hispanic with
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:17.760]  insurance they had to wait it was only a few people
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:21.840]  that were citizens in there and if you had ID and stuff you were scum
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:26.080]  you're penalized when you have insurance you're penalized when you pay taxes
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:31.760]  you're marked as a schmuck as an idiot as a target as a moron
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:36.320]  okay that's what this is the globalists are above the law
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:40.560]  the illegals are above the law you're the we're the only people
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:44.080]  black white Hispanic asian i don't care you play in the system you're fair
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:47.840]  you're good they use you and we're the enemy once
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:51.840]  things collapse as well now pastor clenard
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:56.480]  Howard Childress is a prominent preacher
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:00.720]  he has the powerful website black genocide.org
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:05.760]  and he's of course written several books one of them no shepherds cry
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:10.480]  and he also has been in films and documentaries and cbn
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:14.240]  exposing that 52 percent of blacks never make it out of the womb
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:18.560]  and i've had him on before because when i've been at debates or at interviews
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:22.880]  or out in public and i run into democratic operatives
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:26.640]  who will come over mainly black and say oh it's alex jones the racist
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:30.160]  i look at him and i say you know i i'm somebody who's a libertarian constitutional
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:32.960]  christian who wants to bring people together
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:36.080]  i'm a classical liberal and thomas jefferson vane
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:40.160]  and i care about the content of how you act and what you stand for
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:43.760]  if you're an incredible mind an incredible musician a neat person
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:46.800]  i want to hang out with you regardless of what color you are
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:50.720]  and i said you know how dare you talk like that oh yeah whatever and i go hey
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:53.840]  you're the folks that push abortion are you against aborting all these black
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:56.000]  babies no they're too many black people too many
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.360]  weeds and since then you've seen abortion doctors and people one of them
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:01.920]  asians saying nobody wants these ugly black babies
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:05.280]  i have had black people working at access tv
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:10.640]  for over a decade constantly getting my face democratic operatives and say
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:14.880]  i'm sick of your anti-abortion jones who's going to adopt these black babies
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:17.760]  nappy headed blub blub blub i mean that's like a thing they would say and
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:20.720]  now you've seen videos of black saying that online
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:24.000]  and planned parenthood saying that but it's like a thing they say
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.360]  and i would always be freaked out by it i'm racist because i'm white because i
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:30.000]  don't want to chop up black babies and back then i would have a lot of
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.560]  anti-abortion people on the local show we'd go out and
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:35.920]  protest the planned parenthood and east austin mainly blacks going in
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:39.600]  and because i didn't want black women to murder their children i'm racist now
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:43.440]  you got to remember that folks i don't like obama care i'm racist
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:46.320]  and i know i've talked to children before we've interviewed him for films and
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:49.360]  things he says he's heard and seen that same thing
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:53.040]  and then you see the disdain and the hatred that the romneys would adopt a
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:56.640]  black baby instead of it being chopped up by msnbc
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:00.080]  sir i want you to talk about the black genocide agenda and where it's going
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:04.080]  under obama care in the globalist but uh i'm going from memory that you say
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:08.160]  you've heard those same type of stories can you relay that attitude or or is my
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.200]  memory wrong that when i've had you want to talk about that you've heard that
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:17.200]  exact same statement oh habitually uh for an and for an african-american
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:20.560]  preacher to make those comments and draw attention
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:25.200]  to the disproportionate amount of african-americans who are systemically
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:28.480]  being targeted even when we come up with the facts
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:32.320]  we're uncle tom's we're being used by the system
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:38.240]  uh we're flunkies where we we surrendered our devotion to african-americans
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:44.480]  it's very befuddling and confusing when we stand attempting to point to the
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:49.200]  simple fact and it's very easily proven that african-americans
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:53.040]  are being targeted by the abortion industry
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:59.120]  and the platform that they use to seduce african-americans is clearly
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:03.280]  the democratic party and some of the biggest sellouts
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:06.880]  are in the democratic party there's no question about it and
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:11.440]  i believe that basically embarrassed by that they could be bamboozled in such a
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:18.480]  way but the evidence is very clear uh 1,786 african-american
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:23.920]  children are killed each day by abortion 52 percent of all african-american
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:29.040]  pregnancies end in abortion we make up roughly 12.4 percent of the
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:33.760]  population and 36 percent of the abortions now
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:39.600]  oh so it's up from 52 percent no it's 52 percent of all african-american
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:42.640]  pregnancies end in abortion yes that's that's the last
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:46.240]  that but i was saying uh basically one third
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:50.320]  of all abortions are african-americans now
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:54.400]  to my pain but i should not have been surprised
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:58.320]  i can say to your audience i have complete evidence
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:05.440]  that the congressional black caucus knows those statistics and upon learning
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:08.880]  of them they actually caucus together
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:15.360]  to come up with talking points how to refute people like myself
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:19.760]  and the growing swelling grassroots movement
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:23.280]  of people beginning to question their politicians on
[02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:26.320]  these facts and by the way what you're talking about is they were shown
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:29.440]  mafa 21 and it turned out they knew the truth
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:33.760]  and it's and tell people about that and and more or less
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:38.960]  they were more concerned as most narcissistic politicians are about their
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:42.800]  own power about getting reelected and not
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:47.200]  offending the democratic party you gotta understand the line has been drawn in
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:50.800]  the sand here with obama care we knew it
[02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:55.760]  from the democratic convention when it was exposed they tried to take god
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:19:00.240]  out and and basically out of the platform
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:03.520]  and african-americans didn't move if anyone should have moved it should have
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:06.960]  been african-americans but the fact of the matter is
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:10.880]  what he promised planned parenthood barack obama
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:15.600]  in the freedom of choice act he hid it inside of obama care
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:22.160]  he is saying to every conscious american we control your conscience
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:26.400]  we will tell you what to pay for you will buy this
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:29.600]  and it will support the killing of a baby
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:33.440]  and you have to like it lines drawn in the sand
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:39.760]  okay and this nation is heading towards a major confrontation
[02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:43.920]  it's going to be of civil war proportion i agree stay there exactly
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:49.040]  exactly a race war because that's all they can pull
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:52.960]  mal meanwhile 50 plus million babies have been killed
[02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:57.040]  this is so evil and instead of us having a civil war against the tyrants
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:20:00.240]  they want to make it a black white civil war
[02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:03.920]  alex jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide
[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:06.640]  i'll also enjoying what i have found to be the best tasting
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:10.640]  100 organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:14.000]  my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern mexico
[02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:17.760]  where the tiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown arabica beans
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:20.800]  we have now managed to secure the sought after beans
[02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:24.560]  in a highly customized blend discover and try a bag
[02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:29.440]  of the patriot blend 100 organic coffee at info wars life dot com
[02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:34.000]  this coffee gives you a long smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.640]  and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally

[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:51.840]  what makes me sick about msnbc and harris perry and all of them is
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:55.280]  they're just monsters folks and i've been around democrats behind the
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:59.280]  scenes for years and they are the nastiest group they'll
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:01.680]  look at you black white i don't care particularly black they go
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:04.640]  there's not enough money we need to get rid of these black people these
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:09.040]  and say bad names about them and my thing is is that these idiots believe
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:14.320]  bill gates when he says kill a granny kill granny
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:18.080]  get rid of granny and then you can have 10 teachers jobs

[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:32.960]  and the globalists know this and it makes me upset reverend shoulders i'm
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:36.720]  ranting keep making your points where you were going with this clash
[02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:40.160]  where they're going to make christians pay for abortions violating the first
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:43.360]  amendment i mean it's just never going to end go ahead
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:48.480]  this is the most imposing and egregious legislation ever passed
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:55.200]  in his nation's history and it was albert einstein who said never
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:27:00.800]  surrender conscience even if the state demands it well he grew up in germany
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:04.960]  he knew what he was talking about the state is demanding your conscience
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:09.760]  right now america the state is saying we are your conscience
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:13.920]  and we make your decisions there's no such thing we determine
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:19.520]  right and wrong this is a serious time in this country and we need to wake up
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:25.760]  now you mentioned the the reporter from msnbc
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:30.960]  that made the comment about the romney child you have to understand how this is
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:36.320]  all going down what their means of seduction is
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:40.160]  they have to lay claim to the civil rights
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:43.440]  movement they have to say they're the benevolent ones
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:49.280]  they're the ones that are caring for uh the african america and they use it as
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:54.560]  a means to embarrass whites and to control white america by
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:58.320]  then calling them racists if you don't agree with them so
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:01.440]  here's a perfect example i'm talking about it was proven this past week
[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:07.360]  phil robinson god bless him duck dynasty stood up for his conviction stood up
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:13.120]  and said homosexual he was basically wrong the same sex marriage is wrong
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:18.880]  it was a gq magazine interview mainstream media said here's our chance
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:22.160]  to exert our power we're going to get them to back down
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:25.600]  here's jesse jackson you got to meet with me in 72 hours
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:29.520]  or we're going to you know insinuate we're going to boycott you thank god a and
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:35.120]  he told him to go take a hike and but yet also thank god money does speak
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:39.840]  the family stuck together so he's right back where he's supposed to be
[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:43.440]  why am i been mentioning this in the same week
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:51.600]  i repeat the same week lewis fair con the main potentate the main leader for
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:57.280]  the muslim movement in this country went to the poll pit in chicago and said
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:04.880]  homosexuals should be beheaded why wasn't there any media about that
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:09.280]  is because they didn't want to bring attention to a prominent black male
[02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:13.200]  speaking against same-sex marriage that they had no answer to because this is
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:16.720]  not the scenario they're trying to project especially they only want to
[02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:21.600]  demonize christians too and so here it right exactly
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:26.160]  anything to do with christ christian they will attack
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:29.200]  they will abuse they want to ask you why that is reverend on the other side
[02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:31.920]  then get in some of the history of black genocide that you're an expert on
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:35.600]  we'll be right back with our guests and this stuff really shakes me up folks
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:40.000]  because it's so bizarro world where you're racist if
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.600]  you don't want to kill black babies and then black people liberal black people
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:46.160]  get in your face like they want to get in a fight with you if you don't want to
[02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:49.920]  kill black people i'm not kidding i mean it's it's crazy

[02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:45.920]  lot that thought lives even after i'm
[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:52.080]  shoveled in my grave delusions mr. wordsworth delusions
[02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:56.080]  that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength
[02:33:56.080 --> 02:33:59.040]  when you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:05.280]  spittly limbs of a dream and the state has no use for your crime
[02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:09.280]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:13.280]  it's alex jones
[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:21.600]  we're now into the last 25 30 minutes of the world by transmission today
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:24.800]  i'm your host alex jones reverend childress is our guest
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:27.840]  black genocide.org pastor clenard howard
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:33.920]  children's is our guest and if you look at it they only assault christianity
[02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:36.400]  they try to take it over they try to megachurch it
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:41.200]  they try to romans 13 it they try to infregard it clergy response team it
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:44.080]  faith-based initiative it totally take it over
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:47.360]  world council of churches ecumenical all of it
[02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:50.240]  and now they've got it down to the point where
[02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:53.680]  they're going to make catholic churches Protestant churches you name it pay
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:57.200]  for abortion coverage and they've got a tax in
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:00.320]  travis county only county in texas where taxpayers
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:05.360]  pay an abortion fee so that's the type of stuff that's going on
[02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:07.680]  and it's about forcing you to do what they want
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:10.880]  look at italy just said a 60-year-old man can grab an 11-year-old out of the
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:16.160]  back of a yard and rape him and the social workers say it's love
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:20.400]  that's the actual afp headline they can teach five-year-olds how to have
[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:25.600]  bestiality you name it in public schools and again it's called
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:29.120]  it's called being being politically correct no no it's called evil taking
[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:32.560]  over and it's called assaulting everything
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:36.560]  that's good and it's the bottom of the rabbit hole i've learned is really
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:41.680]  evil people and i'm not here judging people
[02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:45.280]  that have good hearts and don't consciously try to go out and do bad
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:48.800]  stuff but these globalists get off on the bat
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:52.560]  and they want to pull down all that's good and there's a war on christianity
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:56.400]  so reverend children talk about that and why they're
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:00.080]  persecuting the christians and where you think this is going
[02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:03.200]  and why do you think they're accelerating their program with the same
[02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:06.400]  woman that made fun of mint romney's grandchild being black
[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:10.160]  in a white family uh and said you know there's nothing that you know these
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:13.520]  people are all different you know and is this racist or whatever
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:16.800]  uh dividing people and it's the same one that says the state
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:19.920]  controls your kids i mean they're really out in the open pushing the whole
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:24.160]  agenda you know unfortunately and and it's a
[02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:28.160]  deep unfortunately and it's still you know politics
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:31.520]  is perception and we still this america
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:34.720]  america still feels that the democratic party
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:39.040]  with the facilitators of civil rights and so these things that they're doing
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:42.880]  is actually to to help people and be upward and mobile
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:48.080]  and there could be nothing further than the truth and you mentioned this case
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:51.280]  in england i didn't hear that before and i'm
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:54.720]  thank god i am here because i just had the discussion
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:58.080]  that the clergy do not realize that pedophilia
[02:36:58.080 --> 02:37:02.320]  is next they're gaining this ground through the judicial
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:08.160]  tyranny on same-sex marriage pretty soon everything if you can change the
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:11.920]  definition of marriage you can change it and of course you did it with the
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:14.880]  sanctity of life the definition of what life is
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:18.800]  you can now indeed communicate that what that man
[02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:24.640]  did to that 11 year old girl is love and our society christian if you're a
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:30.400]  christian the line is drawn now if we fold on
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:35.440]  this we're done we are done and so uh i didn't
[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:39.120]  never want to come to this i never thought i'd live in america that there
[02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:43.200]  would be a day of time like this but it has come
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:49.120]  and there must be a clear message sent to this administration
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:55.360]  we will not comply plain and simple we will not comply and whatever that means
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:59.040]  we have to then just you know take the hit
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:02.720]  we are americans this is not this is unamerican
[02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:07.040]  it's unconstitutional i don't know what is in congress these days
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:11.360]  but there's certainly now we the people
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:14.800]  must galvanize we the people it has to be just like
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:18.720]  dump dynasty it pop don't go on we all don't go on
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:22.640]  that's the way it has to be right now and so they have
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:28.400]  gained uh this this this mindset that i believe only
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:32.000]  uh good people you mentioned was at the bottom of the barrel
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:37.520]  uh once again uh edmund burr all evil has to do with the tribe is for good
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:42.080]  people to say nothing and be silent all the good people now
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:45.120]  we have to take it up another level another notch
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:50.560]  we have to be vocal this the line is drawn proceed no further i believe no
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:55.360]  today today has to comply according to the judge
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:58.800]  to obamacare they have to provide these contraceptives
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:02.080]  i wouldn't do it i wouldn't do it just just don't do it
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:07.760]  you can't do it at this point well look at how they're openly trying to tell
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:11.200]  churches what they can and can't do that that's totally
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:14.320]  the soviet union i mean there's no doubt that this
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:18.400]  is illegal is socialism is coming wherever you want to call it
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:21.920]  it's a takeover i said from the beginning thank god for people like
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:26.880]  Ben Carson who's still echoing this was never about health care
[02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:31.360]  never about health care it was about control from day
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:37.520]  one it's about control it's about uh intrusion it's about being able to sort
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:41.440]  out who our enemies are of the president administration
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:47.280]  i mean this is um doubtably the we're at the threshold here and there's only
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:51.440]  one people those good people you talked about those good americans
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:55.520]  we cannot allow this you just can't comply you must
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:59.040]  we must now turn this around in such fashion
[02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:02.800]  peaceably i believe is the way to do it i am a
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:08.320]  student of dr king but there's no doubt you cannot comply to this your rights
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:12.320]  are being taken away your freedoms are being taken away
[02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:18.160]  and worst of all conscience you cannot allow government to dictate to you
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:21.120]  your conscience and whether they like it or not
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:26.000]  this is a judeo christian country judeo christian built on those christian
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:30.080]  principles that is under attack that is being stripped
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:33.200]  that is what really is at the core of all of this
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:36.960]  but that's what the mindset of which birth
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:40.160]  this country flawed yes but always remember
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:44.960]  those flaws were dealt with through the constitution into the spirit of the
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:46.720]  constitution that's right that's right the bill of
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:50.560]  rights was awesome sure it wasn't realized it still hasn't been fully
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:54.960]  realized but we know what's coming in is is classical tyranny
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:41:00.080]  not classical liberty but i mean it is a spirit of the world though it really
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:03.600]  does come down to this that they're after real christians they're
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:06.880]  after homeschoolers they're openly saying they're going to outlaw that in
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:10.080]  ohio and places i mean they're coming we've got to get on the
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:14.160]  offense now because because they're not going to back down
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:18.000]  offense offense offense we waited too long as it is
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:21.360]  they shouldn't have got to this point and um
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:24.960]  that's that's what i'm doing the march in october i'm i'm
[02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:29.200]  i will be at rallies i'll be at the walk for life san francisco
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:32.720]  i'm gonna tell you right now um that is going to be a highly charged
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:37.840]  political uh speech i give um and and there's no doubt i know they
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:41.040]  listen to my phone i'm not sure they know i'm sorry
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:44.640]  the congressional black hawk has even mentioned me my name i was very proud of
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:50.960]  that but the fact of the matter is if we do not stand up now
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:54.560]  the america as we know it will be long gone and
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:58.480]  i would not want to believe that some people would say this law cannot be
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:02.640]  repealed any law can be that's all psych warfare when the republican
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:06.800]  leadership won't get rid of it and oh it can't and oh it's it's a giant social
[02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:12.080]  takeover social engineering death panels the big banks are behind it
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:16.080]  because they want all the extra money i mean this is the end of this country
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:20.000]  and people are saying oh we can't repeal it when it's completely unpopular
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:24.320]  across the board it's all nine games we have crux in washington
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:28.720]  they have a six percent approval rating in congress they need to be arrested
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:33.840]  that this is a criminal conspiracy and if they can kill 53 million babies
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:37.680]  of course they can do secret testing on people and of course they can radiate
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:40.320]  foster children and shoot people up with syphilis
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:42.800]  and of course they can teach pedophilia in schools
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:46.400]  because we've let the crazy people that crave the power
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:52.160]  take over every level of society you know everybody my age
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:57.120]  that you may feel your time you know to retire or delay
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:03.360]  no we know the way we know what the the heart and the and the vision of the
[02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:06.560]  great visionaries of this country had for this country and you're right
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:11.040]  you know i do a piece we hold these truths to be self-evident
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:14.400]  the nation never really held that truth but one day i believe
[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:18.000]  dr king said we would hold that truth i believe
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:24.720]  right now this is a defining hour where truly you know i want to use a term
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:28.240]  take our country back or that but basically getting back
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:31.600]  to the heart of the constitution to the heart of the declaration of
[02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:34.720]  independence in it is the most powerful political
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:40.160]  document ever ever ever conceived we have to get back there
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:43.760]  demand there it is still we the people it's not
[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:47.280]  perfect but what is coming down the pike now
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:53.040]  is criminal it is not freedom it certainly isn't the vision of the
[02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:57.280]  founding fathers and we have to be more vocal we have to go to
[02:43:57.280 --> 02:44:00.720]  pta boards we have to go to our local town
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:04.480]  meetings and council meetings we certainly have to go to the legislature
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:10.640]  we have to use the uh the intimidation of we the people
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:16.240]  there's more of us than them case closed we have to use it and all of us
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:22.720]  have to step up we're losing uh i will not turn willfully
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:29.040]  uh to my grandchildren uh a nation of such of this of this caliber it would be
[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:32.800]  criminal upon me not to do everything that you're
[02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:35.840]  doing i mean reverend also look how historically
[02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:39.360]  once things get to this point things collapse it's not just going to keep
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:44.000]  rotting for a long time now all of the liberty and all the blessings
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:49.040]  are leaving the curses are coming we're being overrun uh all our basic freedoms
[02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:52.560]  are going away the prosperity is going away i mean we
[02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:56.160]  know the wages of this collectivist new world order
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:45:00.400]  our death we know the fruits of this system are not good
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:04.000]  and people like yourself unquestionably
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:07.440]  have to keep sending that message we can't assume
[02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:14.960]  people recognize that this is it 2014 probably the most important
[02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:20.960]  year of our nation's history due to the climate and we're at right now
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:29.120]  it has never been this bad and if there isn't a turnaround in 2014
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:33.040]  i don't see us recovering because we mean when we capitulated
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:39.120]  and allowed this to go on without a significant a significant of evil and
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:42.160]  certainly uh letting our voices be heard in
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:46.000]  november this is a this is extremely pivotal year
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:50.000]  anyone who believes in righteousness and the goodness
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.600]  of the of the country the constitution the declaration
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:58.080]  independence i mean anyone who holds those things dear
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:01.920]  you have to ask what level do i take this to now and whatever we've been
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:04.720]  doing is not good enough i'm talking about myself too
[02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:08.000]  whatever i've done obviously it's not good enough it's got to go to another
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:13.840]  level this this is this is war and um if indeed we
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:17.680]  are to survive it's going to take those good people you mentioned earlier
[02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:22.160]  to to to know that good will triumph if good speaks up
[02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:27.120]  if good is willing to sacrifice and go to the front line
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:31.280]  good will prevail god is still on the throne but he's waiting for the good
[02:46:31.280 --> 02:46:34.960]  people to step forward what's going to happen if we don't
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:38.880]  turn the country around i don't want to think about that i'm
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:43.200]  going to be honest with you i've never thought as i stated earlier that i would
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:48.720]  never live in a country where there is enough i mean
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:52.480]  how can you have an administration that just totally ignores
[02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:57.680]  the constitution and the declaration of the independence with impunity i mean
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:03.040]  who is challenging this this this onslaught against the rights
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:08.400]  of of its citizens and so the citizens at this point have to rise up i i can
[02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:11.840]  look at throughout history and see where this is happening in other
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:15.040]  countries once again never thinking it could happen here
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:18.880]  but i better be taking better notes on what i used to see in other nations
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:23.760]  because it is here and if we do not rise up
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:26.640]  and it's not going to be whether you're white or black
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:30.480]  it's going to be whether you are you believe in righteousness you do you
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:34.000]  believe that marriage is between one man one woman do you believe
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:37.600]  that that is a baby the sanctity of life those are the things that are going to
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:41.360]  galvanize do you believe you have the right to
[02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:46.000]  basically to believe as you choose to believe and to worship as you choose to
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:50.720]  worship do you have those rights and for what i know of the history
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:55.280]  that christianity or the trump all those why should i be in a nation that was
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:59.840]  bounded by those principles and watched them dismantle those
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:05.200]  principles and every emblem or sign of those principles without saying
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:09.040]  something it's just this is absurd and then have the public
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:12.320]  schools for those that don't know all over the country teach
[02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:16.400]  very small children kindergarten first second third grade
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:19.600]  stuff that i didn't even know about till i was 20 years old and that's in this
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:23.200]  corrupt decadent world they and teaching kids they could be a
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:26.080]  boy girl or both and you can have your own bathroom
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:29.200]  i mean that that is pedophilia that is setting the precedent
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:33.040]  that the state is gonna do what they want with your kids and they've said that
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:36.400]  why do you think they're moving so fast right now because
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:40.560]  i do see a backlash do you think they're moving fast because they see us gaining
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:44.080]  ground or why do you think they're coming out of the of the sicko
[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:49.040]  closet with the pedophilia and the the state owns your kids and
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:52.080]  we're gonna take your 11 year old to have an abortion even if you don't want
[02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:54.880]  it i mean why why are they doing this reverend
[02:48:54.880 --> 02:48:59.520]  it's so it's shockingly so i have to believe it's evil's deadline
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:06.160]  that i can't see humans being that galvanized and that's strategic it's
[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:11.040]  almost like it is pure evil as if it knows something that we don't
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:16.720]  and that we must get this nation to succumb if this nation succumbs
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:21.360]  they basically have the world if the christians in america fold
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:26.080]  they will fold they they in their minds that it will fold global it
[02:49:26.080 --> 02:49:30.880]  so we have to understand we are at that point we're at the crossroads
[02:49:30.880 --> 02:49:36.800]  i once again you you're mentioning so many fronts the schools most of your
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:41.520]  listeners i don't believe know that they are already conditioning your
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:46.480]  children for a pedophilia there's going to be a lack of identity crisis
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:50.240]  in the african-american community can you imagine how painful and how
[02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:52.720]  hurtful that's going to be when there's already
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:58.160]  70 percent of the homes do not have the the very element that got started with
[02:49:58.160 --> 02:50:02.720]  first man in the house the end and you're gonna and you think they're not
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:05.520]  gonna have a problem with the identity do you think they're not gonna have a
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:09.600]  problem with their sexuality absolutely and in the public
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:14.080]  school system feels this is the america that we are creating now
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:18.240]  it's too demonic it there's no way in the world this could be a person
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:22.640]  this is a group of people whom we probably don't ever see
[02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:27.280]  no doubt and and i i honestly believe the rollout
[02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:31.680]  was a message from god to us this is what you're agreeing to
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:36.480]  i believe that the nsa and the irs and all this being exposed thank god for
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:40.800]  snowton uh that is being exposed that is saying
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:44.560]  we are coming into a police state we will not have
[02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:49.040]  any say so and certainly they're not going to want to hear about
[02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:52.960]  our religion remember religion is the opiate of the people

[02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:24.080]  callers i'm out of time i gotta deal with some stuff with family after the
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:27.040]  show uh all right go into overdrive and take your calls
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:30.640]  i'll be back sunday 4 to 6 p.m we're gonna get a final word from reverend
[02:55:30.640 --> 02:55:35.600]  shoulders here in a moment but folks here's the deal
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:39.440]  i in my gut feel empathy when i know they're targeting black people to kill
[02:55:39.440 --> 02:55:42.720]  52 of them and then it makes me mad when they
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:46.480]  weaponize the black culture through mtv to make it anti-white
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:50.000]  everything else and to push the whole agenda i mean it's just like incredible
[02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:53.040]  it's like you're trying to save people you're trying to save yourself and then
[02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:56.000]  they're taught to hate you and then that makes white people think the blacks are
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.880]  all out to get them and that creates the hate on the other side which is divide
[02:55:58.880 --> 02:56:02.960]  and conquer and just to watch these evil people especially on msnbc
[02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:06.560]  knowingly punching buttons following playbooks
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:11.600]  makes me very very angry and i'm beyond anger because i want a civilization i
[02:56:11.600 --> 02:56:14.800]  want a future and let me tell you something folks if they can target black
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:17.360]  people with all these secret tests and aborting them
[02:56:17.360 --> 02:56:20.800]  they can do it to anybody and that's why i have empathy empathy is because in
[02:56:20.800 --> 02:56:23.680]  your gut in your spirit you know what's happening to somebody
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:26.400]  else is happening to you because you're connected to them and it's gonna
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:30.560]  end up happening to your family and so we better all come together against the
[02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:33.040]  new world order and realize barack obama
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:36.400]  is the more effective of evils he's carrying the ball
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:39.840]  for the new world order it's not that the republican leadership is good either
[02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:43.120]  notice how they're going after the tea party because it's got real people in
[02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:46.720]  it that know what's going on that's why they say it's racist because they don't
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:50.480]  want black people or anybody else to feel like they could have the american
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:53.760]  dream of a bill of rights constitution due process
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:58.160]  that's what this is about folks so i think the answer is white people need to
[02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:00.720]  go to the black neighborhoods black people need to go to the white
[02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:03.680]  neighborhoods everybody needs to start coming together
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:07.520]  for the bill of rights and constitution people organize themselves in groups
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:11.840]  we need to organize ourselves as christians and people that love justice
[02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:16.240]  final comments reverend shoulders you said that's right now that's what's
[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:18.480]  going to happen i believe that we're going to come
[02:57:18.480 --> 02:57:24.240]  based on values uh that no longer judge anyone by the cover
[02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:27.760]  scandal by the content of character and that's all we're going to have
[02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:31.520]  is the same values uh the beauty of the tea party
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:36.000]  tea party is that no one perceived it at birth out of disdain
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:40.240]  for laws that were infringing upon their rights and upon their wealth and
[02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:45.520]  prosperity uh this has to continue to grow and i'm
[02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:50.800]  questionably that i believe it'll always come from people who have a heart
[02:57:50.800 --> 02:57:54.960]  uh for the things of god i think is something that god is waiting for he
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:57:57.840]  did say if my people which are called by my name
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:03.440]  and so we have to recognize we're at that point please don't wait for 2015
[02:58:03.440 --> 02:58:07.600]  uh we have to do this this there has to be a clear
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:14.800]  clarion cry this year this year this time this season everyone in their spirit
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:20.480]  everyone in their spirit has got to realize that there's
[02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:24.240]  dread in the air and you're right we take action god will move
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:28.080]  we've got to walk out on faith historically we will get the providence
[02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:31.360]  to turn the tide god bless you sir and people can visit your
