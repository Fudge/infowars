[00:00.000 --> 00:29.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast.
[00:29.040 --> 00:34.680]  I am on the road and we just have incredible breaking news that just went live that is
[00:34.680 --> 00:38.040]  a global exclusive in conjunction with naturalnews.com.
[00:38.040 --> 00:42.440]  With Mike Adams, he's going to be co-hosting coming up the second hour of myself and Tom
[00:42.440 --> 00:43.440]  Pappard.
[00:43.440 --> 00:46.160]  He'll be the main host because I wanted to be able to really get to all this.
[00:46.160 --> 00:52.680]  New evidence emerges coronavirus bio weapon might have been a Chinese vaccine experiment
[00:52.680 --> 00:53.680]  gone wrong.
[00:53.680 --> 00:59.760]  Genes contain P-shuttle SN sequences proving laboratory origin.
[00:59.760 --> 01:02.240]  Now why is this so important?
[01:02.240 --> 01:10.280]  Well it came out a few days ago to zero head reported on Indian newspapers on one of the
[01:10.280 --> 01:15.200]  most prestigious scientific medical research centers where they use computers similar to
[01:15.200 --> 01:17.200]  CRISPR to gene edit.
[01:17.200 --> 01:22.080]  And it just came out and said this has clearly had a bunch of other viruses welded in including
[01:22.080 --> 01:24.320]  the original HIV.
[01:24.320 --> 01:29.200]  Now the control corporate media didn't come out and say, oh well let's just dispute the
[01:29.200 --> 01:30.200]  paper.
[01:30.200 --> 01:34.000]  They said zero hedge made it up basically, okay?
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.240]  And then said that zero hedge had outed scientists and doctors by writing an article about who'd
[01:40.240 --> 01:41.240]  published a paper.
[01:41.240 --> 01:45.320]  It's like, you know, outing an NFL quarterback, you know, as you talk about in their public
[01:45.320 --> 01:46.320]  figure.
[01:46.320 --> 01:49.400]  That's how they took, because they can call anything harassment with big tech.
[01:49.400 --> 01:52.280]  So you know right away there's a big expression.
[01:52.280 --> 01:57.640]  This paper is prestigious and it's a scan.
[01:57.640 --> 02:04.080]  So see science allows you to create these incredibly complex bio weapons or other systems
[02:04.080 --> 02:08.680]  and basically it's nanotechs where it is, genetic nanotech, RNA nanotech.
[02:08.680 --> 02:12.240]  But it allows other scientists to find it.
[02:12.240 --> 02:17.600]  So it basically has serial numbers on it and the excellent zero hedge article has shot
[02:17.600 --> 02:22.640]  scans of the virus, the sequencing and the pieces cut in.
[02:22.640 --> 02:27.880]  But now they found the gene sequences in it that are only used when you're splicing and
[02:27.880 --> 02:30.040]  so it's basically fingerprints.
[02:30.040 --> 02:37.920]  Now, since then in the last few hours they've come out and made the Indian Technical Institute
[02:37.920 --> 02:45.640]  pull their information, pull the paper, not even saying the paper's wrong, just the paper's
[02:45.640 --> 02:50.920]  been withdrawn because the pressure we wanted last week-wide, the U.S. government, the U.
[02:50.920 --> 02:56.160]  and others weren't sending out the gene sequence of the scan of the virus to research labs
[02:56.160 --> 03:00.200]  and places that we're trying to test for it, because if you have that you can then get
[03:00.200 --> 03:02.680]  a look at the virus and see that it's been man-made.
[03:02.680 --> 03:09.880]  So now Mike Adams is coming on, this is all breaking out there but no one's put the pieces
[03:09.880 --> 03:10.880]  together.
[03:10.880 --> 03:16.920]  And now we're now getting a really good idea that yes, what we originally thought was probably
[03:16.920 --> 03:17.920]  true.
[03:17.920 --> 03:24.120]  It got out of the lab, the CHICOMS have released the SARS same family four times, this one
[03:24.120 --> 03:25.120]  we thought got out of a lab.
[03:25.120 --> 03:28.880]  Well, yeah, it got out of the lab, they've been doing trials, just like the U.S. has
[03:28.880 --> 03:30.360]  been caught doing secret trials.
[03:30.360 --> 03:35.720]  We're a measle and MMR vaccine trials, like kill a bunch of homeless because they do it
[03:35.720 --> 03:40.760]  with disadvantaged populations that don't have a group to defend them like black Americans
[03:40.760 --> 03:46.320]  shot up with syphilis for 40-something years, being told it was vaccines, the disease experiment.
[03:46.320 --> 03:47.960]  Well, it's the same thing.
[03:47.960 --> 03:55.480]  And it looks like it was a vaccine for a whole laundry list, these big unified vaccines
[03:55.480 --> 04:00.080]  and that it is a vaccine experiment on horribly, horribly wrong.
[04:00.080 --> 04:04.640]  It wouldn't be the first time vaccines have spread disease, especially now they go, hey,
[04:04.640 --> 04:08.400]  we can gene it, these vaccines, all we want.
[04:08.400 --> 04:14.560]  We can gene at it, all these vaccines where they're live, you usually get a cut of a half
[04:14.560 --> 04:16.480]  or break them up or radiate them or kill them.
[04:16.480 --> 04:17.600]  But now, oh, it works better.
[04:17.600 --> 04:22.680]  It's live, but we've made it harmless, like the new approved Ebola vaccine was just approved
[04:22.680 --> 04:23.680]  two months ago.
[04:23.680 --> 04:27.040]  Oh, it's long, it's harmless.
[04:27.040 --> 04:28.040]  How does it mutate?
[04:28.040 --> 04:29.040]  What does it do?
[04:29.040 --> 04:30.040]  What could they implant in it?
[04:30.040 --> 04:31.040]  This is crazy.
[04:31.040 --> 04:32.040]  We're going to go to break.
[04:32.040 --> 04:33.040]  We're going to lay it out.
[04:33.040 --> 04:34.040]  This is global exclusive stuff.
[04:34.040 --> 04:58.800]  We're going to be here for just these type of months, stay with us.
[04:58.800 --> 05:05.800]  This is a high leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and
[05:05.800 --> 05:08.920]  Alex Jones of Info Wars.
[05:08.920 --> 05:15.000]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese have bought control of your media,
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.080]  but it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[05:20.080 --> 05:27.080]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings,
[05:27.080 --> 05:31.240]  which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[05:31.240 --> 05:35.880]  Anyone wants to be staged in some tax that does not blame it on Trump.
[05:35.880 --> 05:41.640]  We'll also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[05:41.640 --> 05:48.720]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out a tax and then
[05:48.720 --> 05:55.800]  blame you like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[05:55.800 --> 06:05.440]  Hey, little Cobra.
[06:05.440 --> 06:11.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[06:11.880 --> 06:35.360]  front lines of the Info War.
[06:35.360 --> 06:42.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday, transmission, and
[06:42.520 --> 06:46.600]  time to time I come on air and I say this is the biggest news we've ever reported because
[06:46.600 --> 06:49.560]  the world is getting crazier, this is a quickening.
[06:49.560 --> 06:53.480]  First time I probably said the biggest news I've ever reported was 15 years ago, then
[06:53.480 --> 06:59.320]  I'd say it every once a year, now I say it every few months and I say, but I haven't
[06:59.320 --> 07:02.520]  said this is the biggest news I've ever reported in a while.
[07:02.520 --> 07:08.080]  This is right up there and this is global exclusive on infowars.com right now and we've
[07:08.080 --> 07:15.360]  got the pieces of the puzzle and we know what's going on and this is sensational concerning
[07:15.360 --> 07:20.880]  the coronavirus and just how deadly it is and its providence where it came from and
[07:20.880 --> 07:22.800]  how bad it's going to get.
[07:22.800 --> 07:27.800]  But first, I want to just say something, I told everyone that Hillary's going to end
[07:27.800 --> 07:35.000]  up being put as the VP on somebody's ticket about two years ago or that she would run
[07:35.000 --> 07:42.440]  right before the window closed for her to be able to announce and or that Hillary would
[07:42.440 --> 07:47.120]  be in a broker convention because there'd be too many Democrat candidates and a big
[07:47.120 --> 07:50.600]  battle over it because she would control the super delegates that are still under her
[07:50.600 --> 07:51.600]  political control.
[07:51.600 --> 07:54.680]  They couldn't obviously have her be the nominee.
[07:54.680 --> 07:58.760]  They could have one of the candidates they choose, choose her as the VP because she would
[07:58.760 --> 08:02.240]  really actually be the president and there's this Hillary Clinton deep state cult that
[08:02.240 --> 08:06.320]  believes that she was going to deliver all this to her deep state cronies inside the
[08:06.320 --> 08:07.560]  system.
[08:07.560 --> 08:13.280]  Now that's all over the news, CNN, ABC News, what's up on infowars.com, zero heads, it's
[08:13.280 --> 08:14.440]  an excellent article on it.
[08:14.440 --> 08:25.480]  I told you exactly what she was going to do because I had two sources, tell me what was
[08:25.480 --> 08:31.240]  going on with her and I came on there and mentioned it some and then I got another visit
[08:31.240 --> 08:35.440]  and I was told, hey, folks want you to know this and people are always saying I work for
[08:35.440 --> 08:36.440]  the CIA.
[08:36.440 --> 08:37.440]  I don't have to do with the CIA.
[08:37.440 --> 08:40.240]  CIA is a giant consortium, all sorts of people on it.
[08:40.240 --> 08:43.600]  It's just a government interface, the national security apparatus, but it was CIA that told
[08:43.600 --> 08:49.800]  me that and they said, Hillary, you're horrible, we know you hate her and she's on the phone
[08:49.800 --> 08:53.680]  and she's in these meetings and these are the scenarios and then I would go look up the
[08:53.680 --> 09:00.600]  scenarios they told me and so I'm just telling everybody, I mean, we break so much huge massive
[09:00.600 --> 09:02.680]  stuff and that's why they want us off the air.
[09:02.680 --> 09:10.960]  It's the same thing with the situation, with what's happening with globalism and their
[09:10.960 --> 09:16.880]  plans with open borders and replacement migration and we got those documents over a decade ago.
[09:16.880 --> 09:21.920]  On so many fronts, we've been right there just because we're an outlet on air that
[09:21.920 --> 09:23.080]  will tell the truth.
[09:23.080 --> 09:28.840]  We end up getting the information from listeners and viewers and whistleblowers and corporations
[09:28.840 --> 09:31.720]  and in government and just in private life.
[09:31.720 --> 09:35.480]  It's all of us together and then in full force makes mistakes sometimes.
[09:35.480 --> 09:40.640]  We go in, try to suss things out, try to discover exactly what's going on, but we can smell
[09:40.640 --> 09:45.520]  Trump's victory a mile off and forecast that.
[09:45.520 --> 09:50.400]  So it's the fact that we're so accurate and the fact that you've supported us that really
[09:50.400 --> 09:57.040]  upsets the system because they need these hoaxes and these outrageous things they do
[09:57.040 --> 10:05.440]  to happen without anybody being able to question it because if they're going to sell you a
[10:05.440 --> 10:11.280]  bucket of horse manure and tell you it's chocolate cake, they need to gaslight you and say, no,
[10:11.280 --> 10:12.720]  no, it's really good.
[10:12.720 --> 10:13.720]  It's not bad.
[10:13.720 --> 10:14.720]  Everything's okay.
[10:14.720 --> 10:21.200]  But they need to play that giant disgusting mind trick on you and that is exactly what
[10:21.200 --> 10:22.200]  they're doing.
[10:22.200 --> 10:24.800]  Another example, and I'm not going to toot our horns, it's just a credibility issue
[10:24.800 --> 10:25.800]  for new viewers.
[10:25.800 --> 10:29.480]  Why they seem to be being demonized every day across the news is they want to inoculate
[10:29.480 --> 10:34.160]  you psychologically to not listen to us or check out what we're saying just up front.
[10:34.160 --> 10:38.280]  So that's Alex Jones and I want to be lazy and I'm going to look at what he actually
[10:38.280 --> 10:39.280]  said.
[10:39.280 --> 10:40.280]  I'm just going to believe what CNN said.
[10:40.280 --> 10:44.480]  Like what CNN says, Trump said he hates all Mexicans and they're the worst people and
[10:44.480 --> 10:47.080]  they're all criminals and scum.
[10:47.080 --> 10:48.080]  Never said it.
[10:48.080 --> 10:52.360]  I offered a million dollars on air three years ago.
[10:52.360 --> 10:57.360]  I said, if you can find that, I will give you a million dollars.
[10:57.360 --> 10:58.360]  No one could do it.
[10:58.360 --> 11:01.920]  By the way, I've paid $100,000 prizes out before.
[11:01.920 --> 11:04.280]  I mean, we do what we say we'll do.
[11:04.280 --> 11:08.880]  I offered $100,000 that I ever said there's Martian slave colonies with humans on it.
[11:08.880 --> 11:10.280]  That was all over the national news.
[11:10.280 --> 11:13.000]  Never said anything even close.
[11:13.000 --> 11:14.000]  But that's what they do.
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.000]  Here's another example.
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.880]  We exposed Fiona Hill and we exposed McMaster with direct people that had dinner with McMaster
[11:21.880 --> 11:26.560]  bragging about how he was going to destroy Trump and Trump was an idiot.
[11:26.560 --> 11:28.080]  And these people were totally blown away.
[11:28.080 --> 11:33.800]  We broke that and they came to Roger Stone in DC and said, we're going to kill you or
[11:33.800 --> 11:42.760]  put you in prison and tell that big, sweaty, red faced Texan he's going to be dead.
[11:42.760 --> 11:46.560]  And we both had dinner and said, F them, I mean, and this was serious people said you're
[11:46.560 --> 11:49.800]  dead and Roger still did the right thing.
[11:49.800 --> 11:56.400]  He's facing 20 to 52 years in prison coming up in just two weeks or so at the sentencing
[11:56.400 --> 11:57.400]  on the 20th.
[11:57.400 --> 11:58.680]  And I'm explaining something.
[11:58.680 --> 11:59.680]  We're real folks.
[11:59.680 --> 12:00.680]  And I know you know that.
[12:00.680 --> 12:06.000]  But what we're doing here is not an exercise in height or an exercise in BS.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.400]  We're really got our nose to the grindstone.
[12:09.400 --> 12:11.520]  You've seen I've been in the field with a lot of stuff.
[12:11.520 --> 12:13.560]  I'm going to be all over the country.
[12:13.560 --> 12:14.560]  Got big stuff coming up.
[12:14.560 --> 12:19.680]  Can't tell you about yet because this is such a historical point that we're all in right
[12:19.680 --> 12:20.680]  now.
[12:20.680 --> 12:28.280]  When we come back, I'm going to do my best from the engineers, from the scientists, from
[12:28.280 --> 12:36.800]  the researchers, from all the people involved to lay out what's really happening.
[12:36.800 --> 12:42.160]  But let's just right now state what we know.
[12:42.160 --> 12:53.080]  A major respected scientific computer gene sequencing college came out from India and
[12:53.080 --> 12:55.040]  India time and time again is the country.
[12:55.040 --> 12:59.200]  I'm just giving them credit that goes and test vaccines and goes, well, why is there
[12:59.200 --> 13:00.800]  cancer virus in here?
[13:00.800 --> 13:01.800]  Why is this happening?
[13:01.800 --> 13:02.920]  Why is this going on?
[13:02.920 --> 13:07.040]  And they discovered that it had HIV virus delivery system.
[13:07.040 --> 13:09.160]  That's not HIV virus.
[13:09.160 --> 13:14.520]  The HIV virus delivery system, how it gets into the white blood cells.
[13:14.520 --> 13:18.640]  But this is the delivery system welded on to a system that goes through mucous membrane.
[13:18.640 --> 13:20.640]  So it's not HIV.
[13:20.640 --> 13:22.800]  Coronavirus doesn't have HIV.
[13:22.800 --> 13:31.080]  It has its proboscis, its teeth, its sword, its dingling, I mean, how it gets the stuff
[13:31.080 --> 13:32.080]  injected into you.
[13:32.080 --> 13:33.080]  I'm sorry to use that term.
[13:33.080 --> 13:34.080]  It's just dingling.
[13:34.080 --> 13:35.960]  It's just a virus is dingling.
[13:35.960 --> 13:40.480]  So this thing has HIV is dingling, and that's just a layman's term for it.
[13:40.480 --> 13:41.480]  That's what it is.
[13:41.480 --> 13:43.560]  So we can joke about it all day, but it might kill your ass.
[13:43.560 --> 13:44.840]  And it was welded on to it.
[13:44.840 --> 13:46.040]  So it's just phonies and $3 bill.
[13:46.040 --> 13:47.320]  How long do I got to break here?
[13:47.320 --> 13:48.320]  Two minutes.
[13:48.320 --> 13:50.800]  We're sitting in our pants here, folks.
[13:50.800 --> 13:53.560]  So Mike Adams is coming up next hour.
[13:53.560 --> 13:57.320]  Now what's crazy is this has been proven.
[13:57.320 --> 13:59.400]  This is a very respected Indian Institute.
[13:59.400 --> 14:03.360]  I don't have to tell folks the Indians are got some of the high IQs out there, especially
[14:03.360 --> 14:05.080]  at mathematics and things.
[14:05.080 --> 14:06.080]  Very prestigious.
[14:06.080 --> 14:08.680]  They have been forced to withdraw the study.
[14:08.680 --> 14:15.320]  Now, remember, when this all broke, they were taken down medical sites, mainline scientists
[14:15.320 --> 14:18.400]  on Twitter, zero hedge and saying it's fake.
[14:18.400 --> 14:19.680]  There is no paper.
[14:19.680 --> 14:20.680]  The paper's fake.
[14:20.680 --> 14:24.160]  Well, the scientists came out and said, no, this is real, this is our professors.
[14:24.160 --> 14:25.160]  This is here.
[14:25.160 --> 14:30.080]  Suddenly, World Health Organization gets involved, others, China gets involved, India's neighbor.
[14:30.080 --> 14:32.360]  They just withdrew the paper.
[14:32.360 --> 14:33.360]  They didn't say it's wrong.
[14:33.360 --> 14:35.440]  They withdrew it.
[14:35.440 --> 14:36.440]  They were very conclusive.
[14:36.440 --> 14:38.680]  They're not usually conclusive in papers like this.
[14:38.680 --> 14:42.360]  They were conclusive because this is an iPhone.
[14:42.360 --> 14:44.800]  Don't need to be a scientist to know it, okay?
[14:44.800 --> 14:46.040]  This is a white piece of paper.
[14:46.040 --> 14:48.320]  Don't need to be a scientist to know it.
[14:48.320 --> 14:50.040]  When they scan it, they explain the paper.
[14:50.040 --> 14:54.880]  They say, listen, this is artificially chopped into here, and it is even part of the same
[14:54.880 --> 14:56.840]  family of viruses.
[14:56.840 --> 14:58.680]  And so this is unprecedented.
[14:58.680 --> 14:59.680]  This is insane.
[14:59.680 --> 15:06.800]  This is now the rest of the story, as old Paul Harvey would say when we come back, infowars.com,
[15:06.800 --> 15:08.280]  newswars.com.
[15:08.280 --> 15:13.560]  Since this thing broke, all the sites just asking questions about it, in fact, even before
[15:13.560 --> 15:17.640]  this broke, daily hack attacks, daily sabotage, it's happening to everybody.
[15:17.640 --> 15:20.400]  I can't even get into what's happening behind the scenes.
[15:20.400 --> 15:26.240]  We know this is huge because the effect of them trying to suppress everyone in mass
[15:26.240 --> 15:30.920]  before we even questioned it is crazy because they know this is incredibly serious.
[15:30.920 --> 15:57.760]  It's all coming up, infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[15:57.760 --> 16:03.320]  We've got three big sales going right now, and one of them has to end within a week.
[16:03.320 --> 16:08.960]  And that's ultimate fish oil for 33% off.

[16:20.760 --> 16:21.920]  how important it is.
[16:21.920 --> 16:25.800]  The UN admits two billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never
[16:25.800 --> 16:26.800]  got enough iodine.

[16:38.920 --> 16:40.880]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[16:40.880 --> 16:43.480]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[16:43.480 --> 16:44.680]  That's why people get so sick.
[16:44.680 --> 16:45.680]  That's the main reason.
[16:45.680 --> 16:48.520]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue, get higher absorption.
[16:48.520 --> 16:49.520]  It's amazing.

[16:57.960 --> 17:00.720]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for storeable foods.
[17:00.720 --> 17:03.680]  I would have storeable foods because 2020 is a very dangerous year.
[17:03.680 --> 17:05.360]  The bubble is so huge and can pop.
[17:05.360 --> 17:06.360]  I hope it doesn't.
[17:06.360 --> 17:09.480]  It's incredibly dangerous and it'll cause, well, you don't need me to tell you what'll
[17:09.480 --> 17:10.960]  happen if this giant bubble pops.
[17:10.960 --> 17:14.200]  So I've been promoting storeable foods to everybody because they're high quality.
[17:14.200 --> 17:15.360]  It's insurance you can eat.
[17:15.360 --> 17:16.600]  It lasts 25 years.
[17:16.600 --> 17:20.000]  We go out to find the very best companies that have the very best quality at the very
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.000]  lowest price.
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.840]  And that's my Patriot supply and then so that I have my own private label of their full
[17:24.840 --> 17:25.840]  spectrum of food.
[17:25.840 --> 17:30.680]  We private label it as info wars select and they are saying that they've never sold this
[17:30.680 --> 17:31.680]  much food.
[17:31.680 --> 17:35.560]  They're still able within seven to 10 days to ship it to you if you get your orders in
[17:35.560 --> 17:38.400]  on their small orders, their big orders, seven to 10 days.
[17:38.400 --> 17:42.240]  It will be shipped out to you if you get your order in now.
[17:42.240 --> 17:45.920]  But just as sure as the sun came up, it's all selling out right now.
[17:45.920 --> 17:50.360]  So get your orders in for high quality, storeable foods right now for all the reasons out there

[19:05.120 --> 19:11.240]  I'm pointing out the way forward things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work
[19:11.240 --> 19:15.880]  that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it

[19:24.400 --> 19:29.840]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[19:29.840 --> 19:31.160]  the bad halogen.
[19:31.160 --> 19:36.040]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally
[19:36.040 --> 19:43.320]  I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[19:43.320 --> 19:49.120]  We've got it back in stock X2, 40% off right now at infowarstore.com and I'm telling you
[19:49.120 --> 19:51.000]  folks, get it.

[19:55.720 --> 20:01.720]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[20:01.720 --> 20:08.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:08.720 --> 20:26.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday, February
[20:26.560 --> 20:29.680]  2nd, 2020 transmission.
[20:29.680 --> 20:35.840]  Now let me begin at the beginning and then walk through what's happened.
[20:35.840 --> 20:39.400]  And then if you add all the other little side things that are going on and the behavior
[20:39.400 --> 20:48.120]  of governments, they're really, really concerned about this coronavirus for a good reason.
[20:48.120 --> 20:49.680]  It's manmade.
[20:49.680 --> 20:54.360]  And the minute they saw it was manmade, the giant crapping fits began.
[20:54.360 --> 20:58.760]  Now you'll notice on Thursday and Friday, it was a big internet controversy.
[20:58.760 --> 21:02.640]  Like as Jones sold out, he's saying it's probably not that bad.
[21:02.640 --> 21:05.640]  No, I'm sold out to the truth.
[21:05.640 --> 21:10.360]  So obviously for shows or anybody to hype something up gets more viewers.
[21:10.360 --> 21:11.360]  I'm not going to do that.
[21:11.360 --> 21:13.000]  I have children.
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.320]  I try to tell the truth.
[21:14.320 --> 21:16.280]  I try to figure out things.
[21:16.280 --> 21:21.880]  And then when I make mistakes because I'm trying to figure out what's going on, we're
[21:21.880 --> 21:25.880]  getting lied to most of the time and I'm out here in the dark just like you are trying
[21:25.880 --> 21:26.880]  to muddle through things.
[21:26.880 --> 21:30.640]  I'm going to make mistakes and when I make mistakes, they come in with a big old magnifying
[21:30.640 --> 21:36.600]  glass and they zoom right in on every little minutia and turn it around and say we're doing
[21:36.600 --> 21:37.600]  on purpose.
[21:37.600 --> 21:39.800]  So I don't want to say I'm paralyzed.
[21:39.800 --> 21:40.800]  That's not it.
[21:40.800 --> 21:44.720]  I've been having a bunch of guests on with different views and different angles that
[21:44.720 --> 21:48.400]  I respect from different angles.
[21:48.400 --> 21:52.480]  Dr. Steve Pacinic, he's a medical doctor, a great investigative journalist who works
[21:52.480 --> 21:54.240]  on this very intensely.
[21:54.240 --> 22:01.560]  Sean Rappaport, Mike Adams, but so many other people and experts we've had on to give their
[22:01.560 --> 22:04.120]  take and give their view on this.
[22:04.120 --> 22:09.880]  And what became clear very early was this is not a normal event.
[22:09.880 --> 22:14.440]  Now, we didn't want to say this is the big one.
[22:14.440 --> 22:19.520]  The way to say it's not the big one is to say, okay, it's probably a big world health
[22:19.520 --> 22:24.800]  drill, a big world government drill because the way we've seen the Russians and the Chinese
[22:24.800 --> 22:29.880]  and the US lockstep the same propaganda and the way the talking points have been just
[22:29.880 --> 22:30.880]  the same.
[22:30.880 --> 22:37.160]  I've never seen this before and I know they have global agreements during a world pandemic
[22:37.160 --> 22:41.160]  to basically link up and all operate the same.
[22:41.160 --> 22:47.080]  And so I saw that going back over a week ago and I said, well, you all heard me talk about
[22:47.080 --> 22:48.080]  it.
[22:48.080 --> 22:49.080]  You called in.
[22:49.080 --> 22:54.200]  I said, this has got to be a hoax or a major league exaggerated because they're all in
[22:54.200 --> 22:56.640]  lockstep.
[22:56.640 --> 23:01.880]  But if it's real, they'd be in lockstep too.
[23:01.880 --> 23:07.920]  So then why would Trump for weight more than anybody to start closing down flights now he's
[23:07.920 --> 23:11.680]  doing it starting it, want to create a panic the stock market.
[23:11.680 --> 23:13.600]  That was our reason for that.
[23:13.600 --> 23:18.000]  And then we were calling around to top labs and checking the news and normally you'd have
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.920]  a scan on a virus like this that's publicly available.
[23:20.920 --> 23:24.160]  You want all the clinics around there doing testing that have the machines to test the
[23:24.160 --> 23:30.440]  virus and put it in computers do it now to be able to tell so taking days it takes hours
[23:30.440 --> 23:33.960]  and the clinics are all like, yeah, they won't give us a scan of it.
[23:33.960 --> 23:38.840]  And instead databases that would have it systems that would share it subgroups that had got
[23:38.840 --> 23:44.760]  it were suddenly being hit with giant denial of service attacks out of DC and out of Northern
[23:44.760 --> 23:51.400]  Virginia and out of China and out of South Korea and out of Germany.
[23:51.400 --> 23:54.240]  But see you can go hijack computers somewhere and do it for somewhere else.
[23:54.240 --> 23:57.760]  So that doesn't mean like somebody steals your gun and goes and kills somebody with it.
[23:57.760 --> 23:58.760]  That doesn't mean anything.
[23:58.760 --> 24:03.480]  So so we're here trying to figure this out just like you are because we've never seen
[24:03.480 --> 24:04.480]  such a lockdown.
[24:04.480 --> 24:08.080]  We've never seen such hysteria in their actual action.
[24:08.080 --> 24:11.320]  But then they're telling you, oh, it's not that big a deal on the news.
[24:11.320 --> 24:16.720]  That mix of big huge clampdown tanks in the streets equivalent China literally bodies being
[24:16.720 --> 24:21.240]  burned in mass, drones flying around, going get off the streets, you know, or you'll have
[24:21.240 --> 24:23.360]  your carbon credit cut or whatever.
[24:23.360 --> 24:29.600]  That's going on the roll out of the robots, managing people locked up in apartment buildings.
[24:29.600 --> 24:35.800]  I mean, like, like, like, like, like dreidels exterminate exterminate out of Dr. Who.
[24:35.800 --> 24:38.280]  But instead, they're not doing that.
[24:38.280 --> 24:39.600]  They're teaching you don't run.
[24:39.600 --> 24:44.160]  You are your friends, the dreidel brings you the food.
[24:44.160 --> 24:46.680]  So so we're just being, oh, dreidels are coming.
[24:46.680 --> 24:50.440]  They're going to be not right dollocks, dollocks.
[24:50.440 --> 24:54.360]  The dollocks are like exterminate, exterminate, exterminate, they're rolling around the Chinese
[24:54.360 --> 24:57.640]  hotels and apartment buildings.
[24:57.640 --> 25:01.560]  And so drones are flying around the play this next segment, barking at everyone, giving
[25:01.560 --> 25:02.560]  orders.
[25:02.560 --> 25:05.000]  And I'm like, okay, this is a giant drill.
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  But then not just this group, but other major scientific universities come out and say this
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.880]  virus doesn't look normal, doesn't look novel, like original.
[25:16.880 --> 25:17.880]  It looks like Frankenstein.
[25:17.880 --> 25:20.920]  I mean, you know, you're like, how do you know Frankenstein is Frankenstein?
[25:20.920 --> 25:22.360]  He's got stitches across his head.
[25:22.360 --> 25:24.160]  He's got stitches on his arms.
[25:24.160 --> 25:26.400]  He's made out of a bunch of different bodies.
[25:26.400 --> 25:29.280]  He's got, you know, some crazy person's brain.
[25:29.280 --> 25:31.280]  And so you see the syntheticness of it.
[25:31.280 --> 25:34.720]  And now you get this major university highly respected.
[25:34.720 --> 25:35.920]  I now went and looked this group up.
[25:35.920 --> 25:37.240]  This is what they do.
[25:37.240 --> 25:43.640]  They scan the virus and all these top scientists are listed here, people that are creating vaccines,
[25:43.640 --> 25:47.040]  people that do this for a living, they're respected, very respected.
[25:47.040 --> 25:51.920]  They go, no, this is unbelievably obviously manufactured.
[25:51.920 --> 25:54.560]  And they said it's sensational.
[25:54.560 --> 26:03.560]  It's sensational that this has got the original mother of all HIV.
[26:03.560 --> 26:09.280]  That means everything that would mutate out of it, there's hundreds of types of HIV mutations.
[26:09.280 --> 26:14.080]  So if you want to always create a vaccine to counter all HIV, you go back to the grandma.
[26:14.080 --> 26:15.200]  You go back to the big daddy.
[26:15.200 --> 26:16.600]  You go back to the grandpa.
[26:16.600 --> 26:22.360]  You go back to the original stud line, okay?
[26:22.360 --> 26:31.960]  And boom, there is the delivery part sliced out and another part sliced out of the virus
[26:31.960 --> 26:35.600]  and it's sliced in to give it teeth.
[26:35.600 --> 26:38.760]  So again, if I came through your door and full armor and a samurai sword attacking you,
[26:38.760 --> 26:40.840]  you'd know I came for a fight.
[26:40.840 --> 26:42.440]  That's what was happening.
[26:42.440 --> 26:48.240]  This virus was given a delivery system that isn't even part of its genetic background
[26:48.240 --> 26:49.880]  or what SARS has done.
[26:49.880 --> 26:56.480]  So they took a really bad, really viral, easily spread SARS coronavirus that China's already
[26:56.480 --> 26:57.480]  released four times.
[26:57.480 --> 26:59.320]  They claim being an accident.
[26:59.320 --> 27:03.040]  Really again, vaccine test they've done to see what it does in the population.
[27:03.040 --> 27:06.320]  We know that's happened with H1N1 here before.
[27:06.320 --> 27:10.200]  We know this is going on mass experimentation to see how these vaccines work.
[27:10.200 --> 27:14.840]  And so, oh, it's happened again, but then people get it and they go, what the hell?
[27:14.840 --> 27:21.520]  This has got HIV delivery system that plugs into a T lymphocyte white blood cell and injects
[27:21.520 --> 27:25.960]  itself in the protein cell membrane to get through.
[27:25.960 --> 27:30.360]  But see, this doesn't inject into a white blood cell, thank God.
[27:30.360 --> 27:34.560]  It injects through this membrane to get into your body.
[27:34.560 --> 27:37.520]  So it's meant to get in through your nose or get in through your mouth or get in through
[27:37.520 --> 27:38.800]  your eyes.
[27:38.800 --> 27:41.320]  So this is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:41.320 --> 27:42.760]  And it's heavily massive.
[27:42.760 --> 27:43.960]  What is all that point towards?
[27:43.960 --> 27:44.960]  And what now?
[27:44.960 --> 27:56.760]  The P-cell implants, the mucus, the spore, they know to get it in the body.
[27:56.760 --> 27:59.640]  So if there's nothing wrong, she just had a breast implant.
[27:59.640 --> 28:01.480]  You know, she's got a silicone on there.
[28:01.480 --> 28:05.240]  She's got a doctor's got spore.
[28:05.240 --> 28:09.240]  So it's artificial, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:09.240 --> 28:11.760]  It's chute.
[28:11.760 --> 28:18.360]  And there's new evidence that there's just front of our weapon might have been a Chinese
[28:18.360 --> 28:19.360]  vaccine experiment.
[28:19.360 --> 28:20.360]  Go wrong.
[28:20.360 --> 28:25.680]  Teams contain P-shuttle S-tickle-proving laboratory origin and big grief.
[28:25.680 --> 28:31.360]  Proven laboratory origin by having the P-shuttle S-s-s-s in gene.
[28:31.360 --> 28:32.360]  That's the big goal.
[28:32.360 --> 28:33.360]  It's the big one.
[28:33.360 --> 28:36.240]  We'll be right back to think about that.
[28:36.240 --> 28:41.240]  It's majors on the group's command going, no, it's got it's P-shuttle-s-s-n.
[28:41.240 --> 28:49.160]  So just let it out on purpose or was it a scape, was it an accident, was it a vaccine?
[28:49.160 --> 28:57.520]  We break it all down straight ahead and stay with us.
[28:57.520 --> 29:03.320]  Infoorstore.com, we have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're
[29:03.320 --> 29:05.600]  going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[29:05.600 --> 29:07.440]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it.
[29:07.440 --> 29:13.920]  This really is a game-changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super blue that's
[29:13.920 --> 29:19.040]  four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free, the adult or the children's.
[29:19.040 --> 29:22.760]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers.
[29:22.760 --> 29:23.760]  People love it.
[29:23.760 --> 29:29.120]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans
[29:29.120 --> 29:31.760]  but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[29:31.760 --> 29:37.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  ginsivitis.
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.000]  This is all proven.
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  You can make claims with this.
[29:40.000 --> 29:45.320]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the
[29:45.320 --> 29:51.360]  viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[29:51.360 --> 29:52.680]  So we're really proud of it.
[29:52.680 --> 29:53.680]  It funds the operation.
[29:53.680 --> 29:54.680]  Infoorstore.com.
[29:54.680 --> 29:58.120]  That's why we're still on air, thanks to you.
[29:58.120 --> 30:02.440]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info War, but I know you're like me.
[30:02.440 --> 30:04.360]  You don't want my thanks.
[30:04.360 --> 30:08.240]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters, and you
[30:08.240 --> 30:10.680]  want them off your back and off your children's back.
[30:10.680 --> 30:11.680]  You know what?
[30:11.680 --> 30:14.880]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[30:14.880 --> 30:21.600]  It's why Infoors has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus
[30:21.600 --> 30:27.880]  the people on taking action against the globalist, because I'm committed to a future for humanity,
[30:27.880 --> 30:29.520]  and I know you are as well.
[30:29.520 --> 30:33.320]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Info War, and I want to
[30:33.320 --> 30:37.280]  thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[30:37.280 --> 30:41.520]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at Info Wars, I want
[30:41.520 --> 30:45.680]  to thank you all because you are the Info War, and you know that's not just words, that's
[30:45.680 --> 30:47.400]  reality.
[30:47.400 --> 30:48.960]  You have made history.
[30:48.960 --> 30:51.400]  We have made history together.
[30:51.400 --> 30:57.720]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you, and I suggest you use it.
[30:57.720 --> 31:02.040]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from Info Wars.
[31:02.040 --> 31:07.720]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[31:07.720 --> 31:12.800]  corporate tyranny, has really caught hold not just here in the U.S. but worldwide, and
[31:12.800 --> 31:18.280]  President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is
[31:18.280 --> 31:19.440]  amazing as well.
[31:19.440 --> 31:24.920]  You're still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas,
[31:24.920 --> 31:29.760]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China, Trump's
[31:29.760 --> 31:35.200]  been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're
[31:35.200 --> 31:40.360]  being targeted because we are effective, and the globalists are beginning to lose their
[31:40.360 --> 31:44.960]  war against humanity in a big way, and so we're going to see some major fireworks out
[31:44.960 --> 31:50.640]  of them, but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray
[31:50.640 --> 31:51.640]  at us.
[31:51.640 --> 31:53.480]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[31:53.480 --> 31:57.720]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[31:57.720 --> 31:59.400]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[31:59.400 --> 32:01.560]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[32:01.560 --> 32:05.160]  I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you.
[32:05.160 --> 32:10.880]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads, so you
[32:10.880 --> 32:12.240]  think you don't want to hear an ad?
[32:12.240 --> 32:15.480]  I don't want to hear an ad, but here's the bottom line.
[32:15.480 --> 32:18.760]  We're barely paying the bills here, and I want to expand the face the globalists not
[32:18.760 --> 32:19.760]  contract.
[32:19.760 --> 32:20.760]  I don't want them to win.
[32:20.760 --> 32:23.680]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[32:23.680 --> 32:28.240]  We sew enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs, and we'll expand and really
[32:28.240 --> 32:29.960]  give the globalists their money.
[32:29.960 --> 32:34.520]  But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus, X2, these will change
[32:34.520 --> 32:35.520]  your life.
[32:35.520 --> 32:36.760]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[32:36.760 --> 32:38.760]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[32:38.760 --> 32:39.760]  Check it all out.
[32:39.760 --> 32:43.080]  Whatever you do, take action and know, be part of the Second American Revolution.
[32:43.080 --> 32:46.240]  Be part of Crush the Globalist, and get great products at the same time.
[32:46.240 --> 32:48.760]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[32:48.760 --> 32:50.800]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[32:50.800 --> 33:01.280]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[33:01.280 --> 33:22.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.560 --> 33:26.280]  And we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday Transmission.
[33:26.280 --> 33:31.120]  I am on the road working on major breaking news information, and I will be here throughout
[33:31.120 --> 33:34.880]  the week, but Paul Watson is going to be guest hosting, Mike Adams is going to be guest
[33:34.880 --> 33:38.560]  hosting, and we also have Tom Papert guest hosting.
[33:38.560 --> 33:47.920]  Now Mike Adams, who's been proven dead on during this whole fiasco with the coronavirus,
[33:47.920 --> 33:53.640]  is going to be on hosting the second hour Tom Papert will be popping in as well.
[33:53.640 --> 33:57.720]  And I've already gone over a lot of this, but let me just sum it up right now.
[33:57.720 --> 34:04.600]  There's a big article up on Infowars.com that shows the breaking news, and has the full
[34:04.600 --> 34:07.600]  article with the videos and all the links.
[34:07.600 --> 34:16.120]  And in the headline, it deals with the fact that the origin of the virus has been discovered.
[34:16.120 --> 34:17.120]  That's right.
[34:17.120 --> 34:18.120]  And it's man-made.
[34:18.120 --> 34:24.320]  Now, last week, one of the top Indian universities that does this scanned it with their computers,
[34:24.320 --> 34:28.160]  and they've got gene editing systems now, where they don't just, they're not able to
[34:28.160 --> 34:29.160]  scan stuff.
[34:29.160 --> 34:30.160]  They can go and do whatever they want.
[34:30.160 --> 34:33.800]  Think about the magnitude of that, and they can go on at the microscopic level and even
[34:33.800 --> 34:34.800]  change things.
[34:34.800 --> 34:40.880]  And they said, yeah, no, this is as clear as a clear blue sky.
[34:40.880 --> 34:49.040]  And this has had the HIV delivery system, the injection system.
[34:49.040 --> 34:50.040]  It's not HIV.
[34:50.040 --> 34:51.760]  I want to be clear about that.
[34:51.760 --> 34:54.520]  The media's already been trying to spend that.
[34:54.520 --> 34:55.520]  It's not HIV.
[34:55.520 --> 35:03.240]  It's like when you go to the store, and let's say you've got to take some type of injection,
[35:03.240 --> 35:04.240]  let's say like insulin.
[35:04.240 --> 35:08.760]  So you get your insulin, and you get your little needle, and an injector.
[35:08.760 --> 35:09.880]  And I know the audience knows this.
[35:09.880 --> 35:11.360]  I'm not patronizing you.
[35:11.360 --> 35:12.360]  I'm not talking down.
[35:12.360 --> 35:17.800]  There are some people that'll be panicked by this, so I want to be totally clear.
[35:17.800 --> 35:20.920]  It's not HIV and the coronavirus.
[35:20.920 --> 35:23.720]  It's the needle and plunger and injector.
[35:23.720 --> 35:27.560]  Like, it's not the mosquito.
[35:27.560 --> 35:28.560]  It's the proboscis.
[35:28.560 --> 35:31.080]  What's a mosquito's proboscis?
[35:31.080 --> 35:36.560]  It's its mouth with a needle on it, it sticks it in you, and it pumps saliva down one end
[35:36.560 --> 35:40.760]  that liquefies the blood cells so they don't clot, and then it sucks it back up.
[35:40.760 --> 35:41.960]  That's its delivery system.
[35:41.960 --> 35:42.960]  Okay.
[35:42.960 --> 35:43.960]  And that's why it burns.
[35:43.960 --> 35:50.200]  It delivers acid to liquefy your blood so it can slurp it out.
[35:50.200 --> 35:54.240]  Well, that's a delivery system on a mosquito, proboscis.
[35:54.240 --> 35:59.920]  This is the HIV virus, original, which folks believe was one of the first major engineered
[35:59.920 --> 36:00.920]  viruses before.
[36:00.920 --> 36:02.640]  That's been in Congress.
[36:02.640 --> 36:03.640]  It's come out.
[36:03.640 --> 36:04.640]  They had an autoimmune weapons program.
[36:04.640 --> 36:05.640]  That's been declassified.
[36:05.640 --> 36:10.080]  They didn't, they didn't call it HIV, so they go, well, we're not saying HIV is good.
[36:10.080 --> 36:16.160]  But there was a secret program in 1979 in New York injecting gay men with a live autoimmune
[36:16.160 --> 36:23.160]  virus that would shut down their immune system and let up pneumonia or cancer, you know, anything
[36:23.160 --> 36:27.160]  kill you because, because you're, it's not just viruses and bacteria that white blood
[36:27.160 --> 36:28.160]  cells are killing.
[36:28.160 --> 36:32.800]  I mean, when cancer is spreading, they're like, but if you wanted to kill somebody,
[36:32.800 --> 36:38.440]  you'd kill their T lymphocytes because the T lymphocyte isn't just a white blood cell.
[36:38.440 --> 36:39.440]  It's the general.
[36:39.440 --> 36:46.240]  You know, in the military, general from the front lines with his, with a star on his hat,
[36:46.240 --> 36:47.480]  that's what you want to kill.
[36:47.480 --> 36:50.880]  So this virus kills the general.
[36:50.880 --> 36:56.920]  Well, now they've welded off the exact delivery system and put it onto this.
[36:56.920 --> 37:04.000]  And now my condoms break this time and right until next hour, P shuttle SN sequence proving
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.960]  laboratory origin.
[37:05.960 --> 37:10.520]  So that's the big news here that's now coming out is that you can only have that in a laboratory
[37:10.520 --> 37:13.880]  engineered situation.
[37:13.880 --> 37:15.960]  And so this is just so huge.
[37:15.960 --> 37:21.200]  So the next question is that I should be asking myself because I mean, we're all in this together
[37:21.200 --> 37:25.360]  is, wow, was this in a vaccine test gone wrong?
[37:25.360 --> 37:26.360]  That's what Mike Adams thinks.
[37:26.360 --> 37:30.280]  And he's smarter than I am up at this stuff.
[37:30.280 --> 37:34.120]  Is it a bio weapons, some crazy group made, you know, it's not just governments that can
[37:34.120 --> 37:39.520]  do this now or corporations, I mean, there's a big corporations that this is becoming easier
[37:39.520 --> 37:40.520]  and easier.
[37:40.520 --> 37:45.000]  Some crazy eugenics lab tech like 12 monkeys that thinks there's too many people.
[37:45.000 --> 37:53.960]  That's the scenario they're most worried about because or was it and somebody got infected
[37:53.960 --> 37:56.720]  from a monkey in a test they were doing and it got off that way.
[37:56.720 --> 37:58.880]  Is it a vaccine gone wrong in a secret trial?
[37:58.880 --> 38:01.360]  They know goes on and happens.
[38:01.360 --> 38:02.760]  Is it a bio weapon that leaked out?
[38:02.760 --> 38:04.760]  Did a crazy person release it?
[38:04.760 --> 38:09.880]  I mean, those are the questions we've got a war game and then ask ourselves.
[38:09.880 --> 38:12.960]  Why is the response been so huge?
[38:12.960 --> 38:16.240]  The response has been, this is the worst thing ever.
[38:16.240 --> 38:20.120]  The PR has been, oh, it's not that big a deal, but be careful.
[38:20.120 --> 38:23.240]  And so people have really responded.
[38:23.240 --> 38:32.600]  But the articles up on info wars.com two days ago, a paper published in the bio X org journal
[38:32.600 --> 38:35.960]  presented findings that indicate that the coronavirus appeared to be engineered with
[38:35.960 --> 38:45.680]  key structural proteins close quote of HIV, the candy, some unique inserts, unique inserts.
[38:45.680 --> 38:46.680]  These aren't mutations.
[38:46.680 --> 38:54.440]  These are inserts in the 2019 in COV spike protein, the HIV one GP 120 and gag that's
[38:54.440 --> 39:00.440]  been 10 hours last few days just researching what this stuff means concluded that the engineering
[39:00.440 --> 39:08.560]  of coronavirus was such gene sequences was likely to be of a fortuitous in nature, proving
[39:08.560 --> 39:13.880]  strong scientific support for the theory that the coronavirus is an engineered bio weapon
[39:13.880 --> 39:16.640]  that escaped laboratory containment giant.
[39:16.640 --> 39:22.440]  The coverage of the paper by zero hedge led to a firestorm denials by governments, health
[39:22.440 --> 39:27.360]  authorities and CIA control media not surprisingly any suggestion that the coronavirus was engineered
[39:27.360 --> 39:31.760]  as a bio weapon had to be immediately eliminated, the prevailing panic by the establishment
[39:31.760 --> 39:36.640]  sought to blame the outbreak on mother nature bat snake seafood.
[39:36.640 --> 39:37.640]  It's fun to do that.
[39:37.640 --> 39:41.480]  This is gross eating bats and Chinese folks are great, but man, stop eating live snakes.
[39:41.480 --> 39:44.520]  You know, I mean, just, you know, second after when they beat them up, baby monkey on the
[39:44.520 --> 39:45.520]  head, eat the brains.
[39:45.520 --> 39:50.520]  It's come on, man, rather than the human beings who are playing around with deadly biological
[39:50.520 --> 39:53.160]  weapons that are designed to extinguish human life.
[39:53.160 --> 39:54.560]  Wow, that's beautifully written.
[39:54.560 --> 39:58.880]  Yeah, none of us want to see like faces of death, a little monkey chain down and they're
[39:58.880 --> 40:01.640]  beating its brains out and the woman eats the brains.
[40:01.640 --> 40:02.640]  That's the porn.
[40:02.640 --> 40:04.400]  All cultures aren't the same.
[40:04.400 --> 40:05.400]  Stop doing that.
[40:05.400 --> 40:07.720]  Everybody likes to bash Jews all day.
[40:07.720 --> 40:13.960]  They were the ones 3000 years ago in Leviticus said, Hey, let's stop putting kids in fires
[40:13.960 --> 40:19.240]  of demon gods and stop drinking blood and stop having sex with your sister and stop eating
[40:19.240 --> 40:20.240]  oysters.
[40:20.240 --> 40:21.320]  Not that oysters aren't delicious.
[40:21.320 --> 40:22.320]  Sometimes they kill your ass.
[40:22.320 --> 40:27.840]  So everybody wants to go, Oh, you idiot, crazy, you know, Chinese eating bat soup.
[40:27.840 --> 40:30.760]  It's easy to blame on that, but forget bat soup.
[40:30.760 --> 40:37.400]  You know, it's a thousand times more evil than bat soup, plus the spastic eating wings
[40:37.400 --> 40:38.400]  with hair on them.
[40:38.400 --> 40:39.400]  I mean, come on.
[40:39.400 --> 40:41.520]  That's degeneracy.
[40:41.520 --> 40:48.400]  What is bad is splicing things into genes and into RNA and then it releases and all the
[40:48.400 --> 40:52.520]  things that happen in the admitted huge history of vaccines causing damage and plagues.
[40:52.520 --> 40:56.320]  And then we're supposed to just go along with this and just cover it all up or we'll get
[40:56.320 --> 40:57.320]  censored.
[40:57.320 --> 40:59.880]  We'll get told to shut up.
[40:59.880 --> 41:01.680]  So that's really the big news here.
[41:01.680 --> 41:11.920]  And when we come back, we'll get into the bio Rx IV server on biology Cold Spring Harbor
[41:11.920 --> 41:17.600]  Laboratory and the fact that this even got published in the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
[41:17.600 --> 41:24.120]  that's the main eugenics laboratory because they're aware of all this going on P shuttle
[41:24.120 --> 41:28.800]  essence sequence proves the coronavirus pandemic was definitely engineered in the lab.
[41:28.800 --> 41:34.760]  We'll cover that when we come back and once you read the scientific findings on this report
[41:34.760 --> 41:40.320]  for you on the other side, but as we go to break, I cannot tell you enough.
[41:40.320 --> 41:45.440]  I sell high quality, storable foods because I believe we should all be prepared and be
[41:45.440 --> 41:49.960]  self-sufficient and be able to shelter in place so the virus doesn't get in our house
[41:49.960 --> 41:54.520]  or other viruses like this is why I've got guns, why I've got food.
[41:54.520 --> 41:57.920]  And I have the best nano silver the US military uses.
[41:57.920 --> 42:00.880]  We showed those restricted documents just a few days ago.
[42:00.880 --> 42:04.560]  I was authorized to by folks.
[42:04.560 --> 42:08.320]  Commerce released it to us and I'm just telling the military released to us are like big fans
[42:08.320 --> 42:12.600]  are like, Hey, Alex, you sell the only nano silver out there that we've actually secretly
[42:12.600 --> 42:16.280]  said kills the SARS virus and stuff and I'm not that's real stuff.
[42:16.280 --> 42:17.280]  I showed on air.
[42:17.280 --> 42:18.280]  That's like real.
[42:18.280 --> 42:21.160]  So I didn't jack up the price on all that you need it.
[42:21.160 --> 42:24.480]  It funds our operations to get your immune gargle in three different sizes.
[42:24.480 --> 42:27.640]  It will be sold out in a week or less and get the high quality storeable foods.
[42:27.640 --> 42:30.600]  A lot of storeable foods companies have already sold out because government's buying it all
[42:30.600 --> 42:31.600]  up.
[42:31.600 --> 42:32.600]  We're still selling it.
[42:32.600 --> 42:34.600]  They're at the same price and we're actually delivering it.
[42:34.600 --> 42:40.000]  You're my patron supply info or short.com get four week get three months and more and
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.760]  info or short.com and it's it's insurance.
[42:42.760 --> 42:45.360]  You can eat peace of mind and it funds the info war.
[42:45.360 --> 42:46.360]  Get prepared.
[42:46.360 --> 42:57.440]  Know you're ready and find the info war at three sixty when we'll be right back.
[42:57.440 --> 42:58.440]  Well, it's here.
[42:58.440 --> 43:01.240]  The year twenty twenty world governments out in the open.
[43:01.240 --> 43:04.960]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as
[43:04.960 --> 43:05.960]  the answer.
[43:05.960 --> 43:09.000]  And we've got massive huge censorship taking place.
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.720]  It's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom
[43:15.720 --> 43:19.600]  and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[43:19.600 --> 43:20.600]  Wow.
[43:20.600 --> 43:21.600]  Yes.
[43:21.600 --> 43:22.600]  Now we know we're right.
[43:22.600 --> 43:23.600]  The new world order is real.
[43:23.600 --> 43:24.600]  Satanism is real.
[43:24.600 --> 43:25.600]  The pedophile a leader real.
[43:25.600 --> 43:29.600]  But we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no, but I just
[43:29.600 --> 43:34.040]  want to make the point here one month into twenty twenty that we have never been in Kansas.
[43:34.040 --> 43:38.040]  We have never been in some small village place that didn't matter.
[43:38.040 --> 43:43.080]  I mean, we do every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've
[43:43.080 --> 43:44.640]  gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[43:44.640 --> 43:46.040]  So it's an incredible town to be alive.
[43:46.040 --> 43:48.960]  I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[43:48.960 --> 43:53.800]  But just remember your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of m four
[43:53.800 --> 43:56.040]  short dot com is critical.
[43:56.040 --> 43:58.040]  So please take action.
[43:58.040 --> 44:03.400]  Folks, once you need the food, once you need the water filters, once you need the masks,
[44:03.400 --> 44:04.720]  it'll be too late to get them.
[44:04.720 --> 44:10.280]  You got to get them now before you find that you require them for survival.
[44:10.280 --> 44:11.280]  Trust us.
[44:11.280 --> 44:13.640]  This is not something to be messing around with.
[44:13.640 --> 44:15.520]  Please go to info or store dot com.
[44:15.520 --> 44:21.240]  Make your purchase today and at least have that part of survival covered.
[44:21.240 --> 44:26.560]  The food, the time it will take for the rest of society to collapse or calm down or whatever
[44:26.560 --> 44:30.480]  the case may be the RZ air filtration mask into mesh.
[44:30.480 --> 44:31.480]  I have one of those personally.
[44:31.480 --> 44:35.280]  I've got a couple of a couple of these things off the old info wars store.
[44:35.280 --> 44:36.280]  I am prepared.
[44:36.280 --> 44:40.800]  Are you if you're not info or store dot com on sale now, everything you need to prepare
[44:40.800 --> 44:44.600]  yourself for whatever comes next, folks, it's not necessarily the disease.
[44:44.600 --> 44:46.880]  It's the panic that surrounds the disease.
[44:46.880 --> 44:50.760]  It's the collapse that the disease would bring upon that you need to be prepared for food
[44:50.760 --> 44:53.320]  will be off the shelves, the water won't be available.
[44:53.320 --> 44:55.000]  You might not even be able to leave your house.
[44:55.000 --> 44:59.280]  You got to be prepared before it comes down.
[44:59.280 --> 45:06.680]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars family of listeners and viewers that without
[45:06.680 --> 45:10.200]  you, we won't be on the air and I spent a lot of time thanking you.
[45:10.200 --> 45:14.360]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing
[45:14.360 --> 45:17.520]  the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers.
[45:17.520 --> 45:23.400]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are
[45:23.400 --> 45:25.000]  really amazing.
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.280]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air
[45:28.280 --> 45:33.040]  filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find
[45:33.040 --> 45:34.040]  out there.
[45:34.040 --> 45:39.840]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[45:39.840 --> 45:43.720]  So it's not a burden to support info wars.
[45:43.720 --> 45:50.800]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes
[45:50.800 --> 45:54.360]  your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[45:54.360 --> 45:58.600]  So visit infowarstore.com today.
[45:58.600 --> 46:03.640]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China and the food
[46:03.640 --> 46:06.320]  supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[46:06.320 --> 46:10.920]  We know the virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries and many Chinese who
[46:10.920 --> 46:15.760]  escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the United States West Coast.
[46:15.760 --> 46:20.280]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already
[46:20.280 --> 46:25.000]  run out of supplies, affordable foods because of institutional and governmental buyers.
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.920]  That's right, the rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up
[46:28.920 --> 46:30.880]  food storage at alarming rates.
[46:30.880 --> 46:35.480]  Info wars, private labels from my patriot supply and ships right out of the very same
[46:35.480 --> 46:36.480]  factory.
[46:36.480 --> 46:39.920]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to
[46:39.920 --> 46:43.480]  run out probably in a few weeks and that people need to order now.
[46:43.480 --> 46:48.720]  They want to be able to get it within seven to 10 days, but if people wait, it may end
[46:48.720 --> 46:55.120]  at being longer, but if you get your order in now at infowarstore.com, you will be secured
[46:55.120 --> 47:01.200]  to get the food within seven to 10 days.
[47:01.200 --> 47:11.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:11.200 --> 47:32.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[47:32.840 --> 47:36.120]  I'm going to be joined here by Mike Adams in about six minutes.
[47:36.120 --> 47:40.120]  He's going to take over all the wedding and the things, but this is so important that
[47:40.120 --> 47:46.600]  I'm going to jump in if I don't just turn the microphone off because he's an engineer.
[47:46.600 --> 47:50.520]  He has a bio testing and viral testing and chemical testing lab.
[47:50.520 --> 47:52.520]  He has people employed that do this.
[47:52.520 --> 47:56.960]  He is being massively demonized because he's been spot on.
[47:56.960 --> 48:00.240]  He has believed it's been released from the lab from the beginning because of the hysterical
[48:00.240 --> 48:01.440]  response.
[48:01.440 --> 48:02.800]  Governments weren't ready for this.
[48:02.800 --> 48:04.040]  They're very scared.
[48:04.040 --> 48:05.040]  And now the evidence bounds.
[48:05.040 --> 48:09.520]  It was either injected in a vaccine trial and the vaccine mutated, which is why live
[48:09.520 --> 48:13.040]  vaccines are so dangerous, just because they've done gene sequencing and believe it's going
[48:13.040 --> 48:14.560]  to be harmless.
[48:14.560 --> 48:20.560]  Again, they approved Ebola in mid-December in the U.S., and they are shooting people
[48:20.560 --> 48:24.240]  up with a live Ebola vaccine.
[48:24.240 --> 48:26.880]  Let me just say that again.
[48:26.880 --> 48:33.120]  On December 18th, if you look it up, I'm going from memory, U.S. approves Ebola vaccine
[48:33.120 --> 48:39.760]  not for trials, but for general use in December of last year.
[48:39.760 --> 48:45.480]  So I say two months ago, yes, about a month and a half ago, already in February 2nd.
[48:45.480 --> 48:50.480]  And this is just insane, totally insane.
[48:50.480 --> 48:58.800]  And so I had hoped and prayed that this was just government running a drill worldwide,
[48:58.800 --> 49:03.560]  but now they're scared because this is a live virus.
[49:03.560 --> 49:08.760]  The top research groups are saying it's been engineered, and then they're being pressured
[49:08.760 --> 49:13.840]  by the U.N. to withdraw the report and not saying why.
[49:13.840 --> 49:16.760]  It's definitely crazy.
[49:16.760 --> 49:20.440]  Under intense pressure, the authors, the original paper have now withdrawn the paper and intend
[49:20.440 --> 49:22.800]  to reverse it or don't revise it.
[49:22.800 --> 49:23.800]  Excuse me.
[49:23.800 --> 49:24.800]  They're not saying why.
[49:24.800 --> 49:25.800]  Oh, we're drawing it.
[49:25.800 --> 49:26.800]  We're not saying we're wrong.
[49:26.800 --> 49:27.800]  We're going to revise it.
[49:27.800 --> 49:32.480]  The publication that originally carried the paper now has a warning message stating this
[49:32.480 --> 49:35.680]  article has been withdrawn, clicker for the sales.
[49:35.680 --> 49:40.920]  Because Facebook fact-checkers, who don't even have viral research biology degrees,
[49:40.920 --> 49:44.680]  who aren't doctors, they say it's not true.
[49:44.680 --> 49:46.920]  Don't scare people with HIV.
[49:46.920 --> 49:48.120]  It's not HIV.
[49:48.120 --> 49:49.640]  No one said it was HIV.
[49:49.640 --> 49:56.960]  They said it's the delivery system for HIV.
[49:56.960 --> 49:59.920]  My watch isn't time, isn't us orbiting the sun.
[49:59.920 --> 50:02.400]  It just tracks it.
[50:02.400 --> 50:03.400]  They play games.
[50:03.400 --> 50:07.200]  In addition, the publisher has posted a message warning that all science papers that post
[50:07.200 --> 50:11.640]  are preliminary reports that should not be recognized as inclusive.
[50:11.640 --> 50:13.840]  Well, science is that way, period.
[50:13.840 --> 50:18.160]  You're always learning more, especially when the science establishment is panicking that
[50:18.160 --> 50:20.880]  its official narratives might be crumbling by the hour.
[50:20.880 --> 50:25.160]  No doubt the authors of the particular paper have been sufficiently threatened to revise
[50:25.160 --> 50:30.440]  their conclusions, and an update of their original paper will soon be posted effectively
[50:30.440 --> 50:32.440]  denounces everything they stated in the original paper.
[50:32.440 --> 50:34.040]  And it goes on.
[50:34.040 --> 50:39.400]  But remember, the head UN scientist said the vaccines are killing people and there's a
[50:39.400 --> 50:41.600]  cover-up back in December.
[50:41.600 --> 50:43.120]  We got the information.
[50:43.120 --> 50:44.640]  It's been out there, no coverage.
[50:44.640 --> 50:46.440]  Because if you do, you get blocked.
[50:46.440 --> 50:49.760]  And it's videos of all the head scientists saying, it's hurting people.
[50:49.760 --> 50:50.880]  It's killing people.
[50:50.880 --> 50:53.800]  These adjuvants are triggering all sorts of deaths.
[50:53.800 --> 50:55.320]  Our doctors think they're hurting people.
[50:55.320 --> 50:58.200]  They know it's a wobbly front line.
[50:58.200 --> 51:01.520]  Wobbling means next to collapse.
[51:01.520 --> 51:06.320]  Shaky, wobbly, means, you know, like a boxer.
[51:06.320 --> 51:08.600]  He's wobbly.
[51:08.600 --> 51:11.520]  I mean, their own doctors know this.
[51:11.520 --> 51:14.920]  I have to have a degree to take a two-year-old and get a shot.
[51:14.920 --> 51:16.320]  They're like, mommy, I love you.
[51:16.320 --> 51:18.840]  Can we go to the mall after this?
[51:18.840 --> 51:22.800]  Or can we go see a movie and like get the shot?
[51:22.800 --> 51:24.520]  Seeing a blood rig coming out your nose.
[51:24.520 --> 51:29.120]  It's like you're walking through Arizona in a rattlesnake bike ship.
[51:29.120 --> 51:30.680]  Are you a medical doctor?
[51:30.680 --> 51:31.920]  Are you a Venom specialist?
[51:31.920 --> 51:36.440]  No, you know your kids' legs swells up and they end up chopping their leg off because
[51:36.440 --> 51:37.440]  a rattlesnake built them.
[51:37.440 --> 51:41.880]  If you're in Africa and a King Cobra bike ship or India, you usually die in about five minutes.
[51:41.880 --> 51:47.560]  Now, do you go, oh, don't say a King Cobra kills you because you're not a doctor.
[51:47.560 --> 51:48.800]  It's like a bee stings you.
[51:48.800 --> 51:51.120]  I used to laugh at folks that had a allergic response to bees.
[51:51.120 --> 51:52.120]  Oh, yeah, right.
[51:52.120 --> 51:53.120]  I went to the hospital.
[51:53.120 --> 51:54.720]  I finally got hit by a swarm and I was like, 20.
[51:54.720 --> 51:55.720]  Now it gets stung.
[51:55.720 --> 51:56.720]  I swell up.
[51:56.720 --> 51:58.280]  I got to drink Benadryl as fast as I can.
[51:58.280 --> 52:02.200]  I actually have an EpiPen at my house, one of my car now because of it because you can't
[52:02.200 --> 52:03.200]  breathe.
[52:03.200 --> 52:04.200]  You're turning red.
[52:04.200 --> 52:05.200]  You're scratching all over your body.
[52:05.200 --> 52:09.880]  Imagine these babies being injected with dozens and dozens of shots.
[52:09.880 --> 52:12.720]  Everybody knows you can have an allergic response to that.
[52:12.720 --> 52:14.880]  The allergic response is the bare minimum.
[52:14.880 --> 52:16.320]  What else is in the shots?
[52:16.320 --> 52:17.320]  What are they hiding?
[52:17.320 --> 52:19.560]  What about the secret history?
[52:19.560 --> 52:21.800]  So Mike Adams is taking over here in a moment.
[52:21.800 --> 52:23.680]  He's going to get into all of it from start to finish.
[52:23.680 --> 52:28.560]  I'm asking him to give a whole presentation from start to finish, what we know and how
[52:28.560 --> 52:32.720]  big this is and how serious he thinks it's about to get, and then tomorrow I'll be hosting
[52:32.720 --> 52:33.720]  with Paul Watson.
[52:33.720 --> 52:35.920]  We're going to take a lot of calls.
[52:35.920 --> 52:43.000]  P.S. shuttle SN sequence proves the coronavirus pandemic was definitely engineered in the lab.
[52:43.000 --> 52:48.120]  Now setting new evidence has emerged that proves the coronavirus was definitely engineered
[52:48.120 --> 52:49.120]  in the laboratory.
[52:49.120 --> 52:52.360]  It may have been deliberately injected, the patient is part of a Chinese vaccine experiment
[52:52.360 --> 52:57.720]  gone wrong, which they again use those folks over in China as guinea pigs more than anybody.
[52:57.720 --> 53:02.520]  Don't just think it's poor folks in Appalachia, poor black folks in Alabama, do you?
[53:02.520 --> 53:07.960]  As detailed by James Lyons-Welner, MD founder of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge,
[53:07.960 --> 53:13.360]  another 57 period review publications, an analysis of the gene sequencing for coronavirus
[53:13.360 --> 53:18.600]  finds a particular, peculiar sequence called P. shuttle SN.
[53:18.600 --> 53:24.240]  This sequence is the remnant of genetic engineering sequence that was used to insert genes into
[53:24.240 --> 53:25.600]  viruses and bacteria.
[53:25.600 --> 53:30.640]  It's the fingerprint, the envelope of what it came from left on it.
[53:30.640 --> 53:33.200]  It provides irrefutable open source proof.
[53:33.200 --> 53:36.320]  See energy isn't destroyed, it's just transferred.
[53:36.320 --> 53:39.320]  So energy leaves a mark.
[53:39.320 --> 53:43.680]  They can't get rid of the fingerprints, man, they're not God, they're play God.
[53:43.680 --> 53:45.480]  Only God knows how to get rid of evidence.
[53:45.480 --> 53:49.400]  The sequence is of the remnant of the genetic engineering sequence that was used to insert
[53:49.400 --> 53:51.120]  genes into viruses and bacteria.
[53:51.120 --> 53:55.960]  It provides irrefutable open source, quote, proof that the coronavirus now circulating
[53:55.960 --> 53:59.360]  in the wind was engineered in the laboratory.
[53:59.360 --> 54:02.600]  Every lab that has the gene sequence can see this for themselves.
[54:02.600 --> 54:06.400]  It's right out in the open, that's why the US government, the Chinese won't transmit
[54:06.400 --> 54:08.120]  to the thousands of labs the code.
[54:08.120 --> 54:12.520]  Everybody's like, we want to test, we want to know, we're not giving it to you.
[54:12.520 --> 54:19.360]  Because it's got the mark on it, ladies and gentlemen, like a logo, like Budweiser, it's
[54:19.360 --> 54:23.960]  got the mark right on it, bigger than Dallas, Dallas Cowboys.
[54:23.960 --> 54:30.360]  You know that's the blue star, that silver element, or the redskins in DC, you see that?
[54:30.360 --> 54:34.640]  You know that is Seattle Seahawks, got the mark right there.
[54:34.640 --> 54:37.920]  You see some mother and father with their kids, you can tell that's their kid, it's
[54:37.920 --> 54:39.400]  got the mark right there.
[54:39.400 --> 54:44.800]  Your brain knows, that's their kid, they look just like him, it's incredible.
[54:44.800 --> 54:46.360]  Mike Adams about to take over.
[54:46.360 --> 54:50.080]  One thing we can say for certain is that the particular virus has a laboratory origin.
[54:50.080 --> 54:55.040]  Stakes Lion's Weller in a bombshell interview with Dell, big tree of the high wire, a whole
[54:55.040 --> 54:56.040]  video's up there.
[54:56.040 --> 55:00.640]  It's on infowars.com, it's on naturalnews.com, and they are hacking and trying to savage
[55:00.640 --> 55:03.760]  us with mass attacks that are bigger than we've ever had.
[55:03.760 --> 55:04.760]  And we're just used to it.
[55:04.760 --> 55:08.360]  We're like, you know what, mass attack, like soldiers that have been in war a long time,
[55:08.360 --> 55:11.120]  yeah, mortars are blowing up, there's dead bodies everywhere.
[55:11.120 --> 55:12.120]  And I don't say that that tough.
[55:12.120 --> 55:15.360]  I'm saying, I've kind of gotten where I'm punch drunk here, but I want listeners to
[55:15.360 --> 55:20.160]  know the attacks are 10 times where they've ever been, 20 times.
[55:20.160 --> 55:21.160]  It's insane.
[55:21.160 --> 55:23.320]  I can't even tell you about it on air for security reasons.
[55:23.320 --> 55:28.240]  This is the big one, from the attack we're seeing, you should get prepared, spread the
[55:28.240 --> 55:31.240]  word about these videos and articles, that's the most important thing you can do, and get
[55:31.240 --> 55:35.960]  things like the high quality nano silver immune gargle we have that's selling out, I'm still
[55:35.960 --> 55:40.280]  discounting it 40% and get the high quality, swarble food that we're ready to ship for
[55:40.280 --> 55:41.280]  my Patriot.
[55:41.280 --> 55:43.560]  They're in our computers, we drop ship right through them.
[55:43.560 --> 55:47.040]  You get it first seven to 10 days still, but within about a week, they're going to be sold
[55:47.040 --> 55:52.400]  out week and a half or so, and they're going to have to then put out two, three, four weeks.
[55:52.400 --> 55:54.680]  But if you order now, you will get the swarble food.
[55:54.680 --> 55:58.200]  People say, well, I haven't had a really smart guy and I'll say, well, why do you want food?
[55:58.200 --> 55:59.200]  Why is everybody buying it?
[55:59.200 --> 56:03.000]  Because they know, if you've got to stay in your house for a couple of weeks, while this
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.960]  thing rampages through, if it is as bad as we think, then you've got the food, you've
[56:07.960 --> 56:12.120]  got the guns, you've got the swarble water, and then your family lives, and I will tell
[56:12.120 --> 56:16.560]  you, I'm ready, and if I start seeing mass spread and all this, I'll broadcast from home
[56:16.560 --> 56:20.160]  as long as I can, because I'm not going to expose my children to this, I'm going to
[56:20.160 --> 56:23.440]  have food, I've got water, I've got solar panels, I've got it all.
[56:23.440 --> 56:26.120]  But if you don't have the money for that, understand, just have a firearm, know how
[56:26.120 --> 56:29.240]  to use it and have swarble food and water full tray.
[56:29.240 --> 56:30.560]  Mike Adams has taken over right now.
[56:30.560 --> 56:34.480]  We hope that this isn't needed, but the response shows you how serious this really is.
[56:34.480 --> 56:36.200]  Again, please take action.
[56:36.200 --> 56:38.480]  Whatever you do, your word of mouth is king.
[56:38.480 --> 56:41.320]  Tell people how you're watching and how you're listening right now and spread the work is
[56:41.320 --> 56:42.880]  what Mike Adams is about to say is critical.
[56:42.880 --> 56:45.760]  We're a minute and a half to break, but Mike Adams, take over right now.
[56:45.760 --> 56:47.320]  You are the host of the InfoWarm.
[56:47.320 --> 56:48.800]  All right, here we go.
[56:48.800 --> 56:51.120]  Thank you, Alex, for all that coverage.
[56:51.120 --> 56:55.480]  This is critical breaking news in the next hour here on Infowars.com.
[56:55.480 --> 56:59.520]  I'm going to bring you a detailed analysis of the new evidence that's emerged and give
[56:59.520 --> 57:06.200]  credit where it's due to James Lyon Weiler, who has really done a genome sequencing analysis
[57:06.200 --> 57:10.400]  of this and found really irrefutable proof that this was engineered.
[57:10.400 --> 57:14.360]  So as of today, this is 100% a manmade virus.
[57:14.360 --> 57:17.360]  There is no natural origin of this.
[57:17.360 --> 57:22.920]  Any news organization that's reporting that this is caused by bats and snakes and seafood
[57:22.920 --> 57:24.800]  markets, that's fake news.
[57:24.800 --> 57:30.800]  This is 100% manmade, laboratory origin confirmed, and I'll explain why as we continue.
[57:30.800 --> 57:34.440]  By the way, feed me the clock, guys, that would help me get to the break here.
[57:34.440 --> 57:37.800]  I don't have video at the moment, or just let me know when.
[57:37.800 --> 57:41.000]  Nevertheless, we're going to go take a break, two-minute break.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  We'll be right back.
[57:42.000 --> 57:43.200]  I'm going to get right into this.
[57:43.200 --> 57:44.920]  We're going to cover it in detail.
[57:44.920 --> 57:47.760]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show Sunday edition.
[57:47.760 --> 57:50.520]  We're seeing unprecedented orders for storable foods.
[57:50.520 --> 57:53.440]  I would have storable foods because 2020 is a very dangerous year.
[57:53.440 --> 57:55.160]  The bubble is so huge and can pop.
[57:55.160 --> 57:56.160]  I hope it doesn't.
[57:56.160 --> 57:58.160]  It's incredibly dangerous and it'll end on cause.
[57:58.160 --> 58:00.760]  Well, you don't need me to tell you what will happen if this giant bubble pops.
[58:00.760 --> 58:04.000]  So I've been promoting storable foods to everybody because they're high quality.
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.000]  It's insurance.
[58:05.000 --> 58:06.000]  You can eat.
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.000]  It lasts 25 years.
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.800]  We go out and find the very best companies that have the very best quality at the very
[58:09.800 --> 58:10.800]  lowest price.
[58:10.800 --> 58:12.280]  And that's my Patriot supply.
[58:12.280 --> 58:15.880]  And then so that I have my own private label of their full spectrum of food, we private
[58:15.880 --> 58:18.480]  label it as Imphal Wars Select.
[58:18.480 --> 58:21.360]  And they are saying that they've never sold this much food.
[58:21.360 --> 58:25.360]  They're still able within seven to 10 days to ship it to you if you get your orders in
[58:25.360 --> 58:30.280]  on their small orders, their big orders, seven to 10 days, it will be shipped out to you
[58:30.280 --> 58:32.040]  if you get your order in now.
[58:32.040 --> 58:35.720]  But just as sure as the sun came up, it's all selling out right now.
[58:35.720 --> 58:40.160]  So get your orders in for high quality, storable foods right now for all the reasons out there
[58:40.160 --> 58:41.160]  and it's insurance.
[58:41.160 --> 58:49.120]  You can eat and it funds the info war a total 360 win info war store.com info war's life
[58:49.120 --> 58:53.680]  is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[58:53.680 --> 58:58.840]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[58:58.840 --> 59:05.680]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[59:05.680 --> 59:11.560]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[59:11.560 --> 59:14.880]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[59:14.880 --> 59:19.520]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the
[59:19.520 --> 59:24.880]  fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[59:24.880 --> 59:28.560]  symptoms pollen block is natural and effective.
[59:28.560 --> 59:30.280]  It is not an antihistamine.
[59:30.280 --> 59:34.480]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[59:34.480 --> 59:40.280]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[59:40.280 --> 59:43.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[59:43.000 --> 59:51.280]  Write to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[59:51.280 --> 1:00:06.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:06.760 --> 1:00:11.640]  All right folks, sudden day, it's February 2nd, 2020.
[1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:14.640]  We know the coronavirus was man made.
[1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:18.840]  We now have confirmation from multiple sources, multiple papers.
[1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:22.580]  The cover up is underway, but we now know this is man made.
[1:00:22.580 --> 1:00:27.840]  What we don't know yet is whether it was a biological weapon that was accidentally released
[1:00:27.840 --> 1:00:29.440]  from a lab in China.
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:34.400]  That seems to be one of the likely scenarios or whether it was a vaccine experiment gone
[1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:35.400]  wrong.
[1:00:35.400 --> 1:00:42.160]  This is a new theory that has just emerged due to the research of Dr. James Lyons-Wiler
[1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:46.480]  from the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge in an interview with Del Bigtree of the High
[1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:47.480]  Wire.
[1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:48.600]  Just a bombshell interview.
[1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:51.600]  I just saw it this morning for the first time at bryteon.com.
[1:00:51.600 --> 1:00:54.000]  I know that infowars is going to be covering that.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:58.400]  Probably the video will be posted on band.video as well very soon.
[1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:05.480]  In that video, we learn that there is a gene sequence that is absolute evidence of the
[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:11.400]  tool set that virologists use to insert genetic code into the coronavirus.
[1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:15.420]  In other words, when you do the insertion via genetic engineering of this particular
[1:01:15.420 --> 1:01:21.000]  pathogen, it leaves behind a tool set, an actual code of tools.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:26.800]  It's like for example, if you walk into your den where your computer is and someone has
[1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:32.320]  smashed your computer into a thousand pieces and there's a sledgehammer on the floor, then
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:37.280]  you would have to assume that, gosh, someone took a sledgehammer to your computer.
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:41.800]  That's what's in the viral code right now, in the genomic sequence.
[1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:45.840]  Proof of the tool that was used to make the insertion, or another metaphor, it's like
[1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:52.480]  if you're walking along the beach and you stumble across books that have pages that
[1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:57.160]  have words and the words have sentences that make a grammatical sense.
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:01.720]  They spell real words in English with the alphabet.
[1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:02.720]  It's a book.
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:05.160]  Then you would say, that's man-made.
[1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:09.800]  You wouldn't say, oh, a bunch of bats and snakes and monkeys got together and had an
[1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:13.200]  orgy on a typewriter and produced this and then it got swept up on the beach, but that's
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:15.920]  what the mainstream media is telling you.
[1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:21.280]  They're saying that somehow this code, which I call now open source because it's out there,
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:23.000]  it's out there in nature.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.800]  They're saying that this code was an accident.
[1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:30.840]  Of course, they believe that about everything, about human origins, about the universe.
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:32.440]  Everything's just an accident.
[1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:33.440]  No.
[1:02:33.440 --> 1:02:34.440]  This was engineered.
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:36.680]  You could say intelligently designed.
[1:02:36.680 --> 1:02:38.880]  The coronavirus was intelligently designed.
[1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:44.040]  It was engineered by an intelligent conscious race of human beings, i.e., probably Chinese
[1:02:44.040 --> 1:02:45.040]  virologists.
[1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:48.200]  They were either building a bioweapon or they were building what they thought might be a
[1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:49.200]  better vaccine.
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:51.960]  It turned out to be a catastrophic mistake.
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:56.240]  One way or another, they allowed this to be released into the public.
[1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:58.360]  That's what we're dealing with right now.
[1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:01.800]  It's engineered, confirmed, proven.
[1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:04.600]  The entire theory that this was an accident is now blown away.
[1:03:04.600 --> 1:03:05.760]  It's irrelevant.
[1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:08.600]  Any media source reporting that is obsolete.
[1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:11.640]  They have no idea what they're talking about or they don't understand the science.
[1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:16.080]  Then again, they don't even understand that carbon dioxide feeds plants, by the way.
[1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:21.440]  Why should we expect them to understand the far more complex issue of genomics and genetic
[1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:23.840]  engineering and virology, epidemiology?
[1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:25.360]  They have no knowledge in these areas.
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:29.680]  The mainstream media is scientifically illiterate and so are the so-called fact checkers.
[1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:31.480]  They're scientifically illiterate.
[1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:36.760]  You are getting the best reporting on this right here at Infowars.com.
[1:03:36.760 --> 1:03:41.360]  This is the best reporting in the entire media, not just the independent media.
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:44.160]  By the way, Zero Hedge did a fantastic job as well.
[1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:46.160]  They got banned.
[1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:47.480]  My site, Natural News, we're covering this as well.
[1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:48.680]  Dell BigTree is doing a great job.
[1:03:48.680 --> 1:03:53.280]  They're a lot of good places, but nobody's bringing it together with the live broadcast
[1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:56.160]  and the live coverage as Infowars.com is.
[1:03:56.160 --> 1:03:59.960]  That's why I'm joining today to give you this overview.
[1:03:59.960 --> 1:04:03.200]  In one minute, we're going to take just a very short one-minute break.
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:07.920]  When we come back from that break, I'm going to go into the quotes from Dr. James Lyons
[1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:09.160]  Weiler.
[1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:14.640]  The evidence, I'm going to talk about why this is an open source bio weapon now that
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:18.640]  will be harvested by the enemies of America.
[1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:24.000]  You can bet that right now, Iran and North Korea and other nations are sending people
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:30.400]  to collect this bio weapon to get living samples and to take it home so they can study it and
[1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:34.480]  tweak it and maybe deploy it against the United States at some future date.
[1:04:34.480 --> 1:04:39.600]  This is going to be weaponized even if it wasn't intended to be because this is out
[1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:41.240]  in the open.
[1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:42.880]  It's now open source.
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:46.160]  The viral code is out there and it's not going away anytime soon.

[1:06:09.080 --> 1:06:11.400]  It's Mike Adams.
[1:06:11.400 --> 1:06:16.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:06:16.960 --> 1:06:19.680]  Breaking news updates on the coronavirus pandemic today.
[1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:25.720]  The number of infections has now really catapulted beyond 16,000.
[1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:27.600]  The number of deaths well above 300.
[1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:31.360]  And these are the official numbers from China that we know are being downplayed.
[1:06:31.360 --> 1:06:35.960]  The actual numbers, according to Hong Kong University scientists, their estimates as
[1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:40.720]  of several days ago were 75,815 infections.
[1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:45.560]  No doubt that number is probably six figures by today, according to those estimates.
[1:06:45.560 --> 1:06:51.960]  We now know, just to review, 100% certain this is a man-made virus, man-made origin.
[1:06:51.960 --> 1:06:56.920]  This was created in a laboratory because we have the evidence of the tools of insertion
[1:06:56.920 --> 1:07:03.320]  used via genetic engineering to put certain proteins into this coronavirus for some purpose
[1:07:03.320 --> 1:07:07.800]  that was deliberate and intelligent and driven by human scientists.
[1:07:07.800 --> 1:07:11.800]  We don't yet know whether it was a bioweapon or whether it was a vaccine experiment gone
[1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:12.800]  wrong.
[1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:15.560]  Either one of those scenarios is possible at this point.
[1:07:15.560 --> 1:07:18.640]  But it is not possible that this is of natural origin.
[1:07:18.640 --> 1:07:23.360]  So that is a bombshell that you hear first here at Infowars.com.
[1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:31.400]  Now, importantly, when a virus is out circulating in the wild, a virus includes its own code.
[1:07:31.400 --> 1:07:32.400]  That's what a virus is.
[1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:33.960]  It's not a living organism.
[1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:40.040]  It has fragments, sequences of DNA and RNA surrounded by proteins to help deliver it
[1:07:40.040 --> 1:07:46.160]  so it can really hijack your human cells and invade your cells and kind of turn your cells
[1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:47.520]  into a virus factory.
[1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:53.040]  So it's turning out more viruses instead of turning out human cells as it would normally
[1:07:53.040 --> 1:07:54.040]  do.
[1:07:54.040 --> 1:07:58.920]  So these are sequences that can be seen out in the public.
[1:07:58.920 --> 1:08:02.000]  I call it an open source pandemic.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:07.640]  Anyone with a genetic sequencing instrument, a gene analyzer, a gene sequencer, can take
[1:08:07.640 --> 1:08:13.880]  a sample of this and they can get the actual software print out of the gene sequences.
[1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:16.040]  They can see this for themselves.
[1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:22.120]  Any lab in the world can now run that sequence and they will be able to find the tools of
[1:08:22.120 --> 1:08:28.040]  genetic insertion, which are well known and used across virology, used across the industry.
[1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:30.360]  One of them is the P-Shuttle SN vector.
[1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:34.440]  There's also a 92% match with a SARS protein.
[1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:40.800]  SARS is a type of coronavirus, a 92% match with a protein sequence from SARS that now
[1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:48.920]  indicates this may have been a desperate effort by China to build a vaccine against SARS or
[1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:50.880]  against coronaviruses.
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:56.120]  SARS takes us back to some research from several years ago where they found that SARS vaccines
[1:08:56.120 --> 1:09:01.600]  were killing people because once you were injected with the SARS vaccine, you were then
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:04.680]  highly vulnerable to secondary infections.
[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:09.680]  In other words, if you were immunocompromised in any way or if you were an elderly person,
[1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:18.120]  you had really no ability to overcome a secondary infection and you were in fact more likely
[1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:21.120]  to be killed by that secondary infection.
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:27.760]  Well, what if they did that trying to leapfrog the world in vaccine research to cash in on
[1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:33.600]  vaccine profits and then they ran a vaccine experiment and this got out into the wild
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:37.080]  and it became more infectious than they ever anticipated.
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:40.360]  And now the world is facing a different kind of pandemic.
[1:09:40.360 --> 1:09:42.800]  A vaccine gone horribly wrong, potentially.
[1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:50.440]  This is one of the two primary theories now and that that vaccine may in fact be now weaponized
[1:09:50.440 --> 1:09:52.880]  and be killing people all across China.
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:59.400]  Now, as pointed out by Dr. James Lyons-Weiler, if that's the case, it may be less infectious
[1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:03.920]  than the bio-weapon version of this, which could be good news for the rest of the world,
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:06.000]  but it's bad news for China either way.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:10.600]  And with infections now spreading all across China and even outside of China, spreading
[1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:14.560]  to other countries outside of China, it's very bad news.
[1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:16.480]  I want to roll a video.
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:22.160]  Please start that video, the first segment, because this is Dr. James Lyons-Weiler talking
[1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:23.160]  to Dell Bigtree.
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:28.240]  See if we can roll that video and I'll jump in when he says the most important parts.
[1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:34.000]  It's the entire genome sequence of this virus and compared it to the entire genome sequence
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:37.360]  of all the other coronaviruses that we have data for.
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:43.720]  And this weird element that doesn't belong there, I found that it actually did match
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:50.920]  a vector technology that was from the, 1998 was the first time it was published in the
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:53.400]  Proceedings in the National Academy of Science.
[1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:59.880]  This vector technology is a mechanism by which molecular biologists insert new genes into
[1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:02.040]  viruses and bacteria.
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:07.480]  This vector technology is called a P-shuttle SN vector.
[1:11:07.480 --> 1:11:14.120]  Now, it's really unusual to find a vector technology sequence in a virus that's circulating
[1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:15.520]  in humans.
[1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:21.480]  And so naturally, one thing that we can say, I think for certain, is this particular virus
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:23.720]  has a laboratory origin.
[1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:28.000]  So what you're saying is this, this, this, this technology is something, I'll jump in
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:31.880]  now, but that's an interview with Dell Bigtree of the high wire and it is astonishing.
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:34.880]  We're going to, we're going to play another segment in the next segment here on the show
[1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:35.880]  as well.
[1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:41.640]  Remember what he just said, that this virus is of human origin, it's a laboratory origin.
[1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:46.080]  No question about it because the tool set is there, it's present, it's evident, it's
[1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:51.040]  part of the genomic sequence now, the tool set that was required to insert the genes.
[1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:56.640]  And anybody telling you otherwise is, is fibbing or, you know, hoaxing you.
[1:11:56.640 --> 1:12:03.680]  This is any, any qualified virologist or genomic scientists would be able to confirm this.
[1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:05.800]  But those scientists are being censored.
[1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:08.560]  But let's get to the other issue that I mentioned.
[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:13.760]  The fact that this is now out in the wild means that any radical Islamic nation in the
[1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:18.680]  world, let's say such as Iran, can go out and harvest samples of this.
[1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:24.840]  They can send 50 people to China to deliberately get infected and then return back to Iran.
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:29.200]  They can take saliva samples or blood samples from those individuals.
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:32.720]  They can then replicate the virus and put samples in the freezer.
[1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:33.880]  They can study that virus.
[1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:35.120]  They can tweak it.
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:39.240]  This just saved Iran 20 years of research on biological weapons.
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:40.880]  Same thing is true with North Korea.
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:43.840]  I haven't seen anybody in the media talking about this yet.
[1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:49.720]  We're talking about leapfrogging the biological weapons research of countries that are enemies
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:51.640]  of the United States of America.
[1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:57.240]  And here we are in America with a wide open border, an open border that anybody can just
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:12:58.480]  walk across.
[1:12:58.480 --> 1:13:01.880]  They could be a human weapon that's deliberately infected with this.
[1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:03.720]  They could be someone that's going to release it.
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:04.720]  They could have samples.
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:06.800]  They could have it in a spray bottle.
[1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:08.680]  They could have it in their own saliva.
[1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:13.120]  They could run around an airport or a subway or a mall or a movie theater, and they could
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:15.760]  spread this everywhere across America right now.
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:18.200]  It's called asymmetric warfare, folks.
[1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:23.400]  It means that a very low-budget, low-tech country can now cause mass chaos.
[1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:24.680]  They can cause mass death.
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:28.720]  They can spread a pandemic, and they don't even need really a lab.
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:33.320]  All they need to do now is just replicate the virus, which your body does naturally.
[1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:35.880]  They could use humans to do it.
[1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:39.880]  They could just collect saliva from a bunch of humans, and that would actually accomplish
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:40.880]  this.
[1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:45.200]  And then they could aerosolize that or just use simple PCR technology to replicate the
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:50.640]  gene sequences or just use some tissue that the virus would infect, such as egg yolks,
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:51.920]  for example, or whatever.
[1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:56.440]  They could build masses of bio weapons now based on this, and then deliberately release
[1:13:56.440 --> 1:14:01.400]  them in the United States, and it's unbelievably easy for them to do that.
[1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:05.800]  The reason I mention this is because we have not seen the last of this.
[1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:10.920]  Even if we beat this first wave of the pandemic coming out of China, and that is a definite
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:11.920]  possibility.
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:18.320]  The CDC put the quarantine on those people that came back, 195 Americans, two-week quarantine.
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:19.320]  That was a necessary step.
[1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:22.800]  I agree with the CDC's decision to do that.
[1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:27.640]  The CDC has been working feverishly to try to stop this infection, even as they're not
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:30.240]  telling the public the truth of how bad it is.
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:34.880]  We now have another case just confirmed in Santa Clara County, as mentioned previously.
[1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:38.840]  But we might be able to stop this first wave in the United States because of the travel
[1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:42.960]  ban on foreign nationals coming from China, which was put in place, I think, yesterday
[1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:44.440]  or the day before.
[1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:46.280]  We might be able to stop the first wave.
[1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:49.840]  But what about the terrorism wave that's coming next?
[1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:54.400]  Because enemies of America can take this, they can weaponize it, they can just replicate
[1:14:54.400 --> 1:14:59.600]  it, and they can reintroduce it into the United States in cities like Miami or New York, or
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:04.720]  they can literally walk across the border with it and just start infecting people in
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:08.760]  El Paso, Texas, or in Los Angeles or anywhere.
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:14.080]  That's how easy it is now for them to weaponize this and use it as a weapon, deploy it as
[1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:16.320]  a weapon against the United States of America.
[1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:18.200]  It's an open source bioweapon.
[1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:19.200]  It's already out there.
[1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:21.240]  The code is out there.
[1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:23.920]  No one needs to do any additional research.
[1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:27.000]  All they need to do is harvest it and replicate it and then deploy it.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:31.440]  So this is the cost of playing God with viruses.
[1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:37.920]  This is the cost of running these mad medical experiments with gene sequences, with genetic
[1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:38.920]  engineering.
[1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:45.640]  And in fact, I warned about this very thing in the year 2012 here on Infowars.com called
[1:15:45.640 --> 1:15:48.440]  Stop Out of Control Science.
[1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:55.560]  Eight years ago, I warned about this exact scenario and it's here.
[1:15:55.560 --> 1:16:01.120]  We've got three big sales going right now, and one of them has to end within a week.
[1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:06.760]  And that's ultimate fish oil for 33% off.
[1:16:06.760 --> 1:16:07.760]  It's amazing.
[1:16:07.760 --> 1:16:09.280]  Check it out for yourself.
[1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:15.520]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best-selling, Deep Earth crystals iodine, the good halogen
[1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:18.640]  that is the building block to everything in the body, and I just can't tell you enough
[1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:19.760]  how important it is.
[1:16:19.760 --> 1:16:23.640]  The UN admits two billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never
[1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:24.640]  got enough iodine.
[1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:29.840]  So just check it out for yourself, 40% off, Infowars.com and it funds the M4.
[1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:36.760]  And then vitamin D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together, super high quality, winter sun.
[1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:38.760]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:41.360]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:42.560]  That's why people get so sick.
[1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:43.560]  That's the main reason.
[1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:46.400]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue, get higher absorption.
[1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:47.400]  It's amazing.
[1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:52.240]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at Infowarsstore.com.
[1:16:52.240 --> 1:16:55.720]  Protect yourself and fund the M4 360 win.
[1:16:55.720 --> 1:17:00.760]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China, and the food
[1:17:00.760 --> 1:17:03.400]  supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:06.920]  We know the virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries.
[1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:11.800]  And many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the United States
[1:17:11.800 --> 1:17:12.800]  West Coast.
[1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:17.360]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:22.120]  run out of supplies of suitable foods because of institutional and governmental buyers.
[1:17:22.120 --> 1:17:23.120]  That's right.
[1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:27.080]  The rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming
[1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:28.080]  rates.
[1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:33.120]  Infowars, private labels from my patriot supply, and ships right out of the very same factory.
[1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:36.920]  And they called and let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:39.040]  to run out probably in a few weeks.
[1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:43.880]  And that people need to order now, they want to be able to get it within seven to ten days.
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:46.360]  But if people wait, it may end up being longer.
[1:17:46.360 --> 1:17:53.320]  But if you get your order in now at Infowarsstore.com, you will be secured to get the food within
[1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:56.360]  seven to ten days.
[1:17:56.360 --> 1:18:01.000]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate Infowars, it's
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:08.200]  because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:12.880]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans
[1:18:12.880 --> 1:18:17.720]  to not get down when they attack us, and they persecute us, and they lie about us.
[1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:22.120]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:26.120]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side, and they do what they do
[1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:32.080]  because they're slaves, because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and
[1:18:32.080 --> 1:18:33.600]  destroy the innocent.
[1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:39.520]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to
[1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:43.520]  stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:49.160]  They fear the fact that we are awake, they fear the fact that we are alive, they fear
[1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:55.880]  the fact that we love God, and that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[1:18:55.880 --> 1:19:00.120]  I want to talk about Super Silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except
[1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:04.640]  for maybe the last week and a half, and I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste
[1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:05.640]  I've ever tried.
[1:19:05.640 --> 1:19:07.680]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[1:19:07.680 --> 1:19:09.480]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[1:19:09.480 --> 1:19:15.640]  So here I am telling people, Super Silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste
[1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:20.360]  I've ever tried, and I'm 45 years old, and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste,
[1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:21.840]  and it's fluoride free.
[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:26.040]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium because after
[1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:30.640]  I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like
[1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:34.800]  rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this, it feels so good.
[1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:38.960]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:44.200]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice
[1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:58.680]  a day now because I like the way it feels.
[1:19:58.680 --> 1:20:20.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:20.320 --> 1:20:23.200]  How will we know whether the quarantines are working?
[1:20:23.200 --> 1:20:24.920]  How will we know that this is being solved?
[1:20:24.920 --> 1:20:28.600]  I'm going to give you some guidelines here, welcome back to the show, infowars.com, the
[1:20:28.600 --> 1:20:34.640]  Alex Jones show, Mike Adams from naturalnews.com, stepping in here for the last hour today, Sunday,
[1:20:34.640 --> 1:20:35.640]  February 2nd.
[1:20:35.640 --> 1:20:39.720]  I'm going to be joined by Tom Pappert from National File 2 in the next segment coming
[1:20:39.720 --> 1:20:42.440]  up, so make sure you don't go anywhere for that.
[1:20:42.440 --> 1:20:45.560]  But February 8th is going to be a key date here.
[1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:48.840]  February 8th is the pivotal date.
[1:20:48.840 --> 1:20:54.360]  If the quarantines in China are working, then it means that the spread of the virus has
[1:20:54.360 --> 1:21:01.120]  been halted since the day the quarantine was slammed down on 56 million Chinese, and that
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:03.960]  was roughly just a little bit over a week ago.
[1:21:03.960 --> 1:21:08.920]  So if you fast forward two weeks from that quarantine date, which is roughly around February
[1:21:08.920 --> 1:21:13.680]  8th, it means that if the quarantine is working and the virus has stopped spreading, then whatever
[1:21:13.680 --> 1:21:19.320]  the number of infections are on February 8th should remain the same.
[1:21:19.320 --> 1:21:21.560]  It should plateau on that day.
[1:21:21.560 --> 1:21:27.200]  So I want you to watch very carefully, that's six days away, it's next Saturday.
[1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:34.880]  If the infections have stopped growing, then we as a world community, I guess, we have
[1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:39.480]  beaten the virus, at least we've beaten it in China.
[1:21:39.480 --> 1:21:40.480]  So watch for that.
[1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:46.480]  However, if the numbers continue to grow after February 8th, then it means it is uncontained.
[1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:51.720]  It means we have a self-sustaining outbreak or series of outbreaks, a pandemic, in other
[1:21:51.720 --> 1:21:54.840]  words, that's global in its scale.
[1:21:54.840 --> 1:21:58.720]  And that seems to be the more likely case at the moment, but we'll have to wait and
[1:21:58.720 --> 1:21:59.720]  see.
[1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:04.240]  Now, what's really critical to understand about the dates and the lag time here is that
[1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:10.240]  the Wuhan region, of course, has had a massive outbreak, probably, you know, according to
[1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:13.560]  estimates by other scientists, at least 75,000 people infected.
[1:22:13.560 --> 1:22:17.560]  We know that hospitals are burying and cremating masses of bodies.
[1:22:17.560 --> 1:22:20.240]  The number of dead is not merely 300 something.
[1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:25.040]  It's probably in the many thousands, but we just don't have official confirmation yet.
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:29.480]  I guess Facebook will ban that as a rumor because Facebook is now protecting communist
[1:22:29.480 --> 1:22:31.640]  China and its lies.
[1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:35.120]  But the number of deaths is certainly greater than 300.
[1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:41.320]  Nevertheless, because of the isolation quarantine, the draconian measures that have taken place
[1:22:41.320 --> 1:22:46.680]  in the Wuhan region, we should see that region start to slow in terms of the number of new
[1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:48.960]  infections and number of deaths.
[1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:54.480]  However, another analysis that was published in the Lancet Journal, which we covered yesterday
[1:22:54.480 --> 1:23:00.560]  on natural news, also by researchers in Hong Kong, they analyzed the flight patterns of
[1:23:00.560 --> 1:23:07.280]  flights that left Wuhan airflights to other cities around China and around Asia.
[1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:13.040]  There were, I believe, about 300 different destinations that received passengers from
[1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:14.960]  all of those flights.
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:22.880]  Those flights delivered infected, symptomless carriers to all of those other cities and
[1:23:22.880 --> 1:23:25.280]  all those other regions.
[1:23:25.280 --> 1:23:31.080]  And there will be a lag time as those regions start to show the exploding outbreak, the
[1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:35.880]  self-replicating outbreaks that might be under control in the Wuhan region.
[1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:38.040]  So that's what to look for first.
[1:23:38.040 --> 1:23:41.720]  It's going to be really, if you consider Wuhan to be the first wave of the pandemic, the second
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:46.440]  wave is going to be other cities around China and other countries in the Asian region.
[1:23:46.440 --> 1:23:49.160]  Right now, Thailand and Japan have the most infections.
[1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:53.880]  Yeah, if you're watching that map that you're seeing on screen shows you all the flight patterns
[1:23:53.880 --> 1:23:54.880]  out of Wuhan.
[1:23:54.880 --> 1:23:59.000]  Wuhan is the center, the red dot in the center of that map, shows you all the different places
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:00.640]  the flights went to.
[1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:05.760]  These flights were taking place when human-to-human transmission was already known to have occurred.
[1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:10.600]  Which means that this virus has already been transplanted all across China and all across
[1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:11.600]  Asia.
[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:16.440]  The fact that we're now getting a death in the Philippines, and we're getting more cases
[1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:20.640]  in Thailand, for example, and we're seeing more cases in Hong Kong.
[1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:23.960]  It's looking like it's going to really go pandemic, you know, it's going to have an
[1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:26.920]  outbreak in Hong Kong is what looks likely.
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:33.240]  Japan, over 20 cases now, according to the last numbers, or at least 20, and Japan may
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:34.600]  be able to control it.
[1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:39.040]  Japan has good technology, Japan has a very obedient type of society.
[1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:43.240]  If any country can get it under control there, it's probably Japan and Taiwan.
[1:24:43.240 --> 1:24:47.320]  Taiwan learned a lot of lessons from SARS, and I'm being told from our own personnel
[1:24:47.320 --> 1:24:52.760]  who are in Taiwan, you know, we have an office in Taiwan, and we are a Chinese-speaking publisher,
[1:24:52.760 --> 1:24:57.440]  we're being told that Taiwan is taking amazing steps, highly organized.
[1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:02.360]  They have a massive crackdown plan, they've been able to isolate travelers, ban travelers
[1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:08.240]  from China, they've been able to get people into healthcare very quickly, and they're
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:13.840]  trying all kinds of different medications, including, by the way, HIV drugs and SARS
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:17.840]  type of drugs, which are apparently having some success in the hospitals there.
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:22.040]  That's a completely different story that I probably won't have time to cover today.
[1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:28.240]  But other countries such as Thailand or India, I have very little faith, this is my own opinion,
[1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:32.360]  I have very little faith in a country like Thailand or India being able to control this
[1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:35.160]  if it becomes out of control in those regions.
[1:25:35.160 --> 1:25:40.000]  What it means is that if any one of these countries fails, if it breaks out of containment,
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:44.520]  then this becomes a global pandemic because you can't isolate one country very easily
[1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:48.160]  in our global marketplace, in our global transportation system.
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:52.600]  And now we have cases that are being reported in certain Central and South American countries,
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:57.160]  not confirmed yet, but there was one death that occurred in the United States that the
[1:25:57.160 --> 1:25:59.960]  dead body was shipped back to Peru, I read that this morning.
[1:25:59.960 --> 1:26:05.320]  If this gets out of control in Peru or South America or any Central American nation, it's
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:07.360]  eventually going to get to Mexico.
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:11.400]  And if it gets to Mexico and starts to spread in Mexico, because again, the Mexican government
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:14.760]  can't even control the drug cartels there, you think they're going to be able to control
[1:26:14.760 --> 1:26:15.760]  a pandemic?
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:16.760]  I don't think so.
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:20.520]  If it spreads in Mexico, you're going to have a panic rush to the border of the United
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:25.240]  States, people fleeing the pandemic, but then carrying it into the United States.
[1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:27.960]  And they're going to go right to the sanctuary cities.
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:33.760]  So you're going to have infected asymptomatic carriers in this scenario, which we hope doesn't
[1:26:33.760 --> 1:26:37.040]  happen, but they're going to head right for the sanctuary cities.
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:41.200]  And you're going to have them going to San Francisco, where people are literally crapping
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:43.400]  in the streets, human feces everywhere.
[1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:48.960]  And we just have confirmation last night that the virus replicates and is found in human
[1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:49.960]  feces.
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:54.400]  So what happens when you have people in San Francisco who are infected because of the
[1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:59.760]  illegal immigrants, who themselves are infected and they're fleeing the pandemic, let's say
[1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:04.640]  in Mexico, if that situation occurs, they're going to be in San Francisco, which already
[1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:10.320]  has massive problems of needle sharing, homelessness, filth and feces in the streets everywhere,
[1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:15.520]  which gets washed into the ocean, gets swept back up onto the beaches of the West Coast.
[1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:20.240]  Now you've got coronavirus across the beaches of California, Oregon and Washington.
[1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:22.640]  And now you have no containment.
[1:27:22.640 --> 1:27:27.840]  As I've said in my own articles, a nation that cannot control its borders cannot control
[1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:30.000]  a pandemic.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:38.160]  This pandemic, if it spreads to Mexico, may be a wake up call for America's border security,
[1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:41.880]  because if we can't control our border, we are going to be overrun.
[1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:46.440]  And depending on whether this is a bio weapon or a vaccine experiment gone wrong, the fatalities,
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:51.800]  you know, according to current estimates, could be anywhere from 1% to 15%, just depending
[1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:56.080]  on how the mutations occur, what happens between now and then.
[1:27:56.080 --> 1:28:03.920]  And even the survivors suffer severe respiratory damage, scarring of lung tissue, acute cardiovascular
[1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:07.680]  damage, heart injuries that will stay with you for the rest of your life.
[1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:12.280]  Even if you survive this, you're going to be damaged and literally scarred for life
[1:28:12.280 --> 1:28:13.640]  in most cases.
[1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:15.920]  And secondary infections are a concern as well.
[1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:20.960]  That doesn't even count the logistics collapse, the chaos, the fear, you know, just the lack
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:23.880]  of supplies, the quarantines, the isolation.
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:29.800]  The CDC has already slapped down a federal quarantine order against those 195 Americans.
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:34.320]  They will not hesitate to do it against a city or town if an outbreak starts to occur
[1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:35.320]  there.
[1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:37.880]  And they frankly would not be wrong to do so.
[1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:38.880]  There's much more coming.
[1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:41.960]  We're going to be joined by Tom Pappert from National File in the next segment.
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:42.960]  So stay with us.
[1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:44.960]  This is Mike Adams here on Infowars.com.
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:51.960]  We'll be back after this break with more reporting and analysis.
[1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:51.960]  This is Mike Adams here on Infowars.com.
[1:30:44.960 --> 1:31:00.880]  This should really be easier than it is.
[1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:02.960]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:09.080]  I'm pointing out the way forward things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work
[1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:14.640]  that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:21.120]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us.
[1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:22.280]  And it's symbiotic.
[1:31:22.280 --> 1:31:27.720]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[1:31:27.720 --> 1:31:29.040]  the bad halogen.
[1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:33.920]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally
[1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:41.200]  I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago is sort of taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[1:31:41.200 --> 1:31:47.000]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at InfowarsStore.com and I'm telling you
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:53.600]  folks, get it, it's amazing, discover the benefits and it funds the Infowar a 360 win.
[1:31:53.600 --> 1:31:56.600]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[1:31:56.600 --> 1:32:03.000]  InfowarsLife.com, InfowarsLife.com, InfowarsLife.com.
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:08.680]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of InfowarsStore.com where you find the 60
[1:32:08.680 --> 1:32:13.680]  plus products where we've gone out and researched what is the best, what gives people the best
[1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:18.400]  results, we either private label it or we develop our own with top developers.
[1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:23.160]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[1:32:23.160 --> 1:32:26.160]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[1:32:26.160 --> 1:32:27.160]  It's incredible.
[1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:31.200]  So do yourself a favor, try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:35.280]  You can't lose except if you don't take action because when you buy the products, you're
[1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:40.480]  funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace and
[1:32:40.480 --> 1:32:41.480]  our action.
[1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:43.040]  But you need these products.
[1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:45.760]  That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing.
[1:32:45.760 --> 1:32:50.120]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[1:32:50.120 --> 1:32:53.800]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[1:32:53.800 --> 1:32:55.520]  We're fighting to win and we are winning.
[1:32:55.520 --> 1:33:17.040]  And thanks to you, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:17.040 --> 1:33:23.200]  More bombshell news and analysis continuing here on the info wars.com show Alex Jones
[1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:27.640]  show with the Sunday Mike Adams here going to be joined by Tom Papert national file in
[1:33:27.640 --> 1:33:28.640]  just a minute.
[1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:33.560]  We're going to go to a second clip from that interview with Dr. James Lyons Wyler with
[1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:35.120]  a Dell big tree.
[1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:37.120]  More bombshell information in this clip.
[1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:38.920]  It just blew my mind when I heard this.
[1:33:38.920 --> 1:33:40.360]  It's only about a minute.
[1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:42.360]  Listen carefully to what he says.
[1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:45.800]  He's analyzing the genomic sequence of this Corona virus.
[1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:47.480]  Go ahead and roll that.
[1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:51.680]  Where are the odds now stacked up as a scientist looking at this?
[1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:56.440]  I can say that I'm very, very certain it's not just a wild type Corona virus that happened
[1:33:56.440 --> 1:33:58.160]  to acquire this element.
[1:33:58.160 --> 1:34:03.960]  We're rolling out wild, wild virus in the woods, which means it's laboratory acquired
[1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:04.960]  somehow.
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:11.200]  It's escaped from the laboratory or it's been or the people have been vaccinated with it.
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:12.200]  And that's why it's in their bodies.
[1:34:12.200 --> 1:34:15.600]  And that's why they test positive for this particular vaccine.
[1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:20.040]  There's a huge difference in the predicted health outcome for the world if this is a
[1:34:20.040 --> 1:34:25.840]  vaccination experiment in China versus just a laboratory escape vaccine.
[1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:30.200]  The vaccination experiment, you're not vaccinated against Corona virus.
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:32.520]  People in Sweden are not vaccinated.
[1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:36.680]  People in the Africa are not vaccinated against Corona virus with that vaccine.
[1:34:36.680 --> 1:34:42.520]  So if the Chinese tried to get a jump on the vaccine market by surreptitiously running
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:48.120]  clinical trials against Corona virus and made their elderly and immunocompromised more
[1:34:48.120 --> 1:34:54.520]  susceptible to death due to subsequent infection by any Corona virus with this spike protein
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:59.240]  that's in the vaccine, then the rest of the world has a serious humanitarian issue.
[1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:02.600]  But maybe it's not, maybe it's a moderate level threat, right?
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:07.400]  And so the test of this hypothesis would be, do we see the same death rates in America?
[1:35:07.400 --> 1:35:09.560]  He's going to go into some more technical details.
[1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:13.880]  What he's saying just to summarize is that if this is a vaccine experiment that has gone
[1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:18.680]  awry, then it may not be as devastating to the world.
[1:35:18.680 --> 1:35:23.960]  Instead, he says we'll have a humanitarian crisis dealing with China, that this infection
[1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:30.120]  might be limited to China and the Asian region if it's a vaccine experiment gone bad.
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:34.040]  However, if it's a biological weapon, then all bets are off.
[1:35:34.040 --> 1:35:40.040]  It may be a global pandemic that is sort of trending in that way as we're watching the
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:41.480]  numbers and we're watching the spread.
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:45.880]  We still don't know which one of these origins is the correct explanation.
[1:35:45.880 --> 1:35:47.080]  We know it's manmade.
[1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:52.920]  We know it's not a natural accident that lined up all these proteins and DNA sequences and RNA
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:53.640]  sequences.
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:54.520]  This is manmade.
[1:35:54.520 --> 1:35:56.440]  This came out of a lab.
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:36:01.960]  Now, we are joined by Tom Papert from National File, which has done outstanding reporting on
[1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:02.120]  this.
[1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:04.840]  Tom's been a contributor to Infowars as well.
[1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:06.200]  I'm a fan of his work.
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:07.560]  Tom, what do you make of all this?
[1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:09.160]  You just watched that clip.
[1:36:09.160 --> 1:36:13.480]  Plus, all the research that you've been doing, what's your take on where we stand right now?
[1:36:14.760 --> 1:36:17.080]  Well, you know, Mike, I'm a big fan of yours as well.
[1:36:17.080 --> 1:36:18.920]  It's great to finally come on with you.
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:23.560]  Of course, I've talked to Dr. Steve Pacinac and others who, of course, have a slightly
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:24.360]  different opinion.
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:28.040]  I tend to think your analysis is more or less spot on.
[1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:29.640]  I mean, I'm not an expert like you are.
[1:36:29.640 --> 1:36:31.160]  I can't really challenge it.
[1:36:31.160 --> 1:36:31.960]  I do wonder.
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:34.360]  I mean, you watch videos like this.
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:39.640]  You break down the articles and the breaking news that you have today on the show, and
[1:36:39.640 --> 1:36:45.240]  then you see events like in Malaysia or in Thailand, where, as you said, this could be
[1:36:45.240 --> 1:36:47.720]  a giant disaster in the making.
[1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:53.640]  We have a video up at nationalfile.com of people getting off a plane ostensibly from China,
[1:36:53.640 --> 1:36:59.320]  and officials are just there spraying them down with who knows what to try and disinfect them.
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:03.720]  I mean, from my understanding, that's going to do absolutely nothing when it comes to
[1:37:03.720 --> 1:37:05.480]  stopping the spread of this virus.
[1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:07.640]  So I think it is a giant threat.
[1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:14.120]  I think the fact that the Facebook fact-checking Nazis are all over this bodes very poorly for us.
[1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:19.560]  We had a caller on the war room last week who pointed out that China is not going to risk
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:25.880]  losing billions of dollars by quarantining 60 million people unless the opposite side of that,
[1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:29.480]  the risk that they would take by not doing this quarantine is severe.
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:32.360]  So I think that this is being extremely underreported.
[1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:37.080]  I don't quite understand why here in the West, we're not making a bigger deal of it.
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:41.800]  We just had President Trump start to put people in quarantine and stop accepting people from
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:45.560]  China last week on Friday towards the end of the day.
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:47.320]  It's all kind of bizarre.
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:48.920]  I'm kind of curious, what do you think?
[1:37:48.920 --> 1:37:50.040]  I mean, go ahead.
[1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:55.720]  Well, the thing is, the communist government can only cover this up for so long.
[1:37:55.720 --> 1:37:59.000]  How many bodies can they bury before people start to notice?
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:02.600]  How many infections can they downplay before people start to notice?
[1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:06.920]  We already know that they're creating artificial scarcity in the diagnostic tests in order to
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:10.280]  avoid diagnosing people with this infection.
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:14.200]  But as this spreads, it's going to become harder and harder to cover up,
[1:38:14.200 --> 1:38:18.600]  even for the so-called fact-checkers, even for the tech media, the tech giants.
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:23.160]  Their censorship can't stop the spread of truth, which hopefully,
[1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:25.080]  the truth will spread faster than the pandemic.
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:26.120]  Otherwise, we're all in trouble.
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:26.920]  What are your thoughts?
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:29.480]  Well, I certainly think you're right.
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:33.160]  I mean, they've tried to stop the truth in many different forms, many different facets.
[1:38:33.160 --> 1:38:34.520]  That's why Bandai video exists.
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:35.800]  That's why Brighton exists.
[1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:37.640]  That's why your website is thriving.
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:38.760]  InfoWars is thriving.
[1:38:38.760 --> 1:38:43.720]  National File is thriving because people in America are not docile like the Chinese.
[1:38:43.720 --> 1:38:46.120]  I mean, it's very sad what's happened to them,
[1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:49.480]  likely as a result of living under communism for generations.
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:52.120]  There's a new report out in a British magazine,
[1:38:52.120 --> 1:38:56.680]  British newspaper that says people in Wuhan are being ordered to kill
[1:38:56.680 --> 1:39:00.920]  their dogs and cats to murder their pets because they might carry it.
[1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:03.320]  And they're just, you know, they've been bred.
[1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:06.920]  Everybody who had a rebellious gene was killed under Chairman Mao,
[1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:10.680]  so I'm sure that they're going to willingly go along with whatever the government wants.
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:16.280]  Do you see, I mean, some folks have said that China is the best place this could happen because
[1:39:16.280 --> 1:39:17.880]  of their totalitarian nature.
[1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:19.080]  Do you agree with that analysis?
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:26.440]  Well, I do agree with the sense that China is willing to stampede human rights
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:30.840]  and civil rights in order to eliminate the spread of this virus.
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:33.400]  They are killing people in the process.
[1:39:33.400 --> 1:39:36.840]  People have no access to health care options.
[1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:37.960]  They're running out of food.
[1:39:37.960 --> 1:39:41.000]  They're running out of medical supplies and fuel as well.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:44.360]  Starvation and secondary diseases are going to kick in.
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:50.280]  But China has the kind of structure and hierarchy to achieve that goal,
[1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:52.440]  even though that goal is anti-human.
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:53.560]  You know what I'm saying?
[1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:56.120]  Whereas other countries don't even have that infrastructure.
[1:39:56.120 --> 1:40:01.640]  So if this gets out of control in Thailand or India or Mexico or places like that, forget it.
[1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:03.800]  Government can't control those countries at all.
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:07.960]  In fact, Thailand's on the verge of a revolution almost every day,
[1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:11.880]  and India can't make traffic lights work without causing chaos.
[1:40:11.880 --> 1:40:15.160]  So who knows where this is going if infection is spread there?
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:18.200]  Well, you bring up such a good point about India.
[1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:22.040]  I mean, we had this study, which now has just been totally retracted.
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:25.000]  And me, as somebody who, I'm not a scientist, I'm not an expert,
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:26.840]  and that's why I'm so glad to be on with you.
[1:40:26.840 --> 1:40:30.520]  I look at this, and I'm thinking, why on earth would you retract a study
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:35.800]  that you just put out days ago, now half the medical community around the world
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:37.720]  is struggling to say, never mind.
[1:40:37.720 --> 1:40:38.680]  We reported on this.
[1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:39.880]  It seemed logical at the time.
[1:40:39.880 --> 1:40:40.680]  It seemed to make sense.
[1:40:40.680 --> 1:40:42.360]  But it's been retracted.
[1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:46.840]  So what, in your opinion, is the reason why this study is gone?
[1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:50.280]  Is it just, as you said, this is a group of people who didn't do all their homework?
[1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:51.720]  Or is there something more nefarious?
[1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:54.920]  Well, it was retracted simply because it started getting attention.
[1:40:54.920 --> 1:40:55.320]  That's it.
[1:40:55.320 --> 1:40:58.600]  You know, I've interviewed scientists who have been imprisoned
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:02.440]  because their research contradicted the official stories,
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:03.720]  and they were threatened.
[1:41:03.720 --> 1:41:05.960]  They were told, you either retract your research,
[1:41:05.960 --> 1:41:08.440]  you apologize to the scientific community,
[1:41:08.440 --> 1:41:10.520]  or we're going to prosecute you and send you to jail.
[1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:11.320]  And they did.
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:15.160]  I've interviewed many scientists, one from my film, Biosludge,
[1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:19.960]  that was threatened with being physically harmed and pulled out of his house at night
[1:41:19.960 --> 1:41:25.400]  by armed people working like a SWAT team for the EPA that said,
[1:41:25.400 --> 1:41:29.640]  don't you dare talk about viruses and biosludge and how that's not safe.
[1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:31.400]  By the way, I've got some breaking news here,
[1:41:31.400 --> 1:41:34.040]  a translation from our team in Taiwan.
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:40.440]  There was an individual who tested positive for the coronavirus in Vietnam.
[1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:44.840]  He took a flight from the United States to Vietnam,
[1:41:44.840 --> 1:41:50.520]  and there was a two-hour stop in Wuhan, that airport, on January 15th.
[1:41:51.400 --> 1:41:53.960]  January 15th, he was there for just two hours.
[1:41:53.960 --> 1:41:55.080]  He caught the virus.
[1:41:55.080 --> 1:41:57.160]  He showed no symptoms for 11 days.
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:02.200]  He checked into the hospital just three days ago in Vietnam.
[1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:08.440]  This means that the Wuhan airport was spreading this virus from at least January 15th
[1:42:08.440 --> 1:42:11.400]  to the day that that airport was locked down, the quarantine day.
[1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:15.480]  That's probably around 10 days that people were flying all over the world
[1:42:15.480 --> 1:42:17.960]  with this virus with no quarantine in place.
[1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:18.760]  That's breaking news.
[1:42:19.880 --> 1:42:21.080]  Just stunning.
[1:42:22.920 --> 1:42:25.320]  And if there's one, I mean, for my knowledge,
[1:42:25.320 --> 1:42:26.920]  it's probably the first person in Vietnam.
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:28.360]  If there's one, this is a major...
[1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:30.280]  This is what folks don't understand, I think, Mike.
[1:42:30.280 --> 1:42:35.480]  We're talking an area that's five or six different LAs crammed into one small area.
[1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:38.040]  This probably went all around the globe in that period of time.
[1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:41.160]  Yeah, exactly. And people could still be carrying it right now,
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:42.760]  incubating it in their bodies right now.
[1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:46.040]  We may not see a wave for another week or so, but we'll be back.
[1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:49.960]  You're watching InfoWars, Alice Jones' show, Mike Adams and Tom Paffert.
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:43:17.960]  We'll be back after this break.
[1:43:17.960 --> 1:43:20.760]  Yes, now we know we're right. The new world order is real.
[1:43:20.760 --> 1:43:23.160]  Satanism is real. The pedophile a leader real.
[1:43:23.160 --> 1:43:27.000]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:29.880]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020,
[1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:31.720]  that we have never been in Kansas.
[1:43:31.720 --> 1:43:35.320]  We have never been in some small, ill place that didn't matter.
[1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:39.880]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:42.280]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:43.880]  So it's an incredible town to be alive,
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:46.600]  and I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:50.440]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth,

[1:47:21.080 --> 1:47:24.520]  All right, a quote here from Dr. James Lyons-Wiler
[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:27.240]  in that interview that we played segments from earlier.
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:29.400]  Quote, in the worst case scenario,
[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:33.640]  if the vaccination strain is more highly contagious and lethal,
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:39.640]  then the 2019 NCOV, the coronavirus, novel coronavirus, could become, quote,
[1:47:39.640 --> 1:47:44.760]  the worst example of vaccine-derived contagious disease in human history.
[1:47:44.760 --> 1:47:46.680]  That's one of the emerging theories right now
[1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:50.040]  that this could be a vaccine experiment gone wrong.
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:52.920]  If you know anything about the history of medical experimentation,
[1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:54.840]  even in the United States,
[1:47:54.840 --> 1:47:59.800]  President Obama was forced to apologize for NIH-funded medical experiments
[1:47:59.800 --> 1:48:03.720]  on prisoners in Guatemala that took place in U.S. history.
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:07.800]  In fact, medical experiments against American citizens
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:11.880]  have taken place over and over again and again for over 100 years.
[1:48:11.880 --> 1:48:17.000]  Not just Tuskegee, but many other experiments involving typically African Americans,
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:20.440]  prisoners, and soldiers in the military.
[1:48:20.440 --> 1:48:24.600]  And yet now we have the tech giants conspiring with Communist China
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:27.320]  to cover all this up and protect China.
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:29.480]  And that's my first question to you in this final segment.
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:33.800]  Tom, why do we now have a high-tech industry
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:36.760]  that is going to protect Communist China
[1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:39.640]  and cover up the truth that they let this out of the bag
[1:48:39.640 --> 1:48:43.240]  and they have placed all of humanity in a perilous situation?
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:44.440]  They are lying about it,
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:47.240]  and Google and Facebook and Twitter are going to protect China.
[1:48:47.240 --> 1:48:49.080]  Why is that happening?
[1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:51.000]  Well, it is baffling on the surface,
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.400]  but obviously these people have already sold out to China.
[1:48:53.400 --> 1:48:57.960]  They think that China is going to be the eminent country in the 21st century.
[1:48:57.960 --> 1:49:00.120]  They have, many of them have moved to China.
[1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:01.400]  They have businesses in China.
[1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:03.560]  They've partnered with China because, as you know,
[1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:06.600]  and the viewers know, you cannot have a business in China
[1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:10.520]  without the Chinese government and the Communist Party essentially running it.
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:14.120]  And so then our mockingbird media at the AP
[1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:17.000]  Associated Press comes out with headlines like this.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:21.320]  Fears of a new virus trigger anti-China sentiment worldwide.
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:23.880]  A scary new virus from China has spread around the world.
[1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:27.000]  So has rising anti-Chinese sentiment.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:28.360]  I mean, that's terrible.
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:30.680]  I certainly hope that isn't happening,
[1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:33.880]  but nobody seems to be focused on the idea here
[1:49:33.880 --> 1:49:37.000]  that this thing has a rather high mortality rate.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:40.120]  It can spread even when you are not symptomatic.
[1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:43.640]  It's been in virtually every single Western country right now.
[1:49:43.640 --> 1:49:45.880]  It's only a matter of time to see if the quarantines.
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:48.040]  Some of these people are just told to self-quarantine,
[1:49:48.040 --> 1:49:49.720]  go home and don't leave for 14 days.
[1:49:49.720 --> 1:49:51.640]  Hope you have enough groceries.
[1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:52.680]  It's bizarre.
[1:49:52.680 --> 1:49:57.160]  And of course, the tech giants, they honestly, my take is,
[1:49:57.160 --> 1:49:59.240]  they think that China is going to weather this.
[1:49:59.240 --> 1:50:04.120]  As you've pointed out, Mike, if this breaks out in Central America or Africa or India,
[1:50:04.120 --> 1:50:06.280]  it's almost certainly not going to be able to weather this.
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:09.720]  If this breaks out in the United States in a place like,
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:14.680]  oh, I don't know, San Francisco, Nancy Pelosi's stomping grounds where there is feces on the ground.
[1:50:14.680 --> 1:50:17.400]  There are people who you can't tell if they're alive or dead.
[1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:19.320]  They're homeless and they're strung out on drugs.
[1:50:19.320 --> 1:50:20.760]  It's heartbreaking to see.
[1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:24.040]  But this could go absolutely insane.
[1:50:24.040 --> 1:50:27.960]  And the United States does not have our citizenry.
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:31.480]  It does not have the makeup to allow the FEMA camps.
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:33.720]  We're not going to all go into those FEMA camps willingly.
[1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:35.800]  Alex has been talking about it for 25 years.
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:38.920]  We're not going to comply if they say your city is now on a quarantine.
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:40.120]  You're not allowed to leave your house.
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:42.680]  Oh, and by the way, you got to kill your cat and dog.
[1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:44.040]  We're not going to comply.
[1:50:44.040 --> 1:50:46.440]  Whereas China, these tech giants look at China.
[1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:47.640]  They see billions of people.
[1:50:47.640 --> 1:50:49.000]  They see an emerging market.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:52.600]  They see a country that can weather the storm and where they can retreat to
[1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:57.800]  and make even more billions of dollars and continue to live their fantastic lifestyle.
[1:50:57.800 --> 1:51:03.320]  And instead of using the remnants of a capitalist system to screw over the public,
[1:51:03.320 --> 1:51:07.000]  they'll just use an out and out communist system, a mercantilist system.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:10.120]  Well, Hillary Clinton said they are fun camps.
[1:51:10.120 --> 1:51:12.920]  So you're going to have fun with the coronavirus.
[1:51:12.920 --> 1:51:16.840]  You're going to get to play dodgeball with the coronavirus in your fun camp
[1:51:16.840 --> 1:51:18.120]  enforced by the CDC.
[1:51:18.120 --> 1:51:20.920]  If this gets out of control in the United States.
[1:51:20.920 --> 1:51:23.880]  But I could see where this is going based on what you just said, Tom.
[1:51:23.880 --> 1:51:27.960]  Soon it's going to be said that if you even believe that there is a pandemic,
[1:51:27.960 --> 1:51:29.640]  then you're racist, right?
[1:51:29.640 --> 1:51:33.320]  So they're going to say that biological weapons are a conspiracy theory that
[1:51:33.320 --> 1:51:35.480]  there's there's never been a biological weapon.
[1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:39.000]  There are no bio weapons in the world and anyone who says that there has ever
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:42.200]  been a research lab anywhere ever in the history of the world.
[1:51:42.200 --> 1:51:46.120]  Well, they are obviously a conspiracy theorist spewing fake news.
[1:51:46.120 --> 1:51:48.280]  There are no bio weapons whatsoever.
[1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:49.720]  All vaccines work.
[1:51:49.720 --> 1:51:51.160]  CNN tells the truth.
[1:51:51.160 --> 1:51:55.640]  The Russians stole the election and Hillary Clinton is a beautiful goddess
[1:51:55.640 --> 1:51:58.520]  who wants to help you become a better human being.
[1:51:58.520 --> 1:51:59.320]  So there you go.
[1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:01.720]  The whole list of lies that are going to be coming our way.
[1:52:01.720 --> 1:52:04.840]  But look, I thought Trump derangement syndrome was bad.
[1:52:04.840 --> 1:52:10.200]  Looks like we're going to have pandemic denialism as the next disease affecting
[1:52:10.200 --> 1:52:13.160]  leftists all across America and around the world.
[1:52:13.160 --> 1:52:16.040]  Or as I've called it, trans-viralism.
[1:52:16.040 --> 1:52:20.040]  If you don't believe in biological reality, you make a wish and you pretend
[1:52:20.040 --> 1:52:23.960]  that you're not infected with a virus and you can change your gender too at the
[1:52:23.960 --> 1:52:24.520]  same time.
[1:52:24.520 --> 1:52:27.480]  So you can say shazam, magic wand.
[1:52:27.480 --> 1:52:31.400]  I'm a I'm a woman and I'm not infected with the coronavirus because biology
[1:52:31.400 --> 1:52:32.040]  doesn't matter.
[1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:33.640]  That's what's coming.
[1:52:33.640 --> 1:52:34.520]  That's America.
[1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:35.960]  Well, and it is.
[1:52:35.960 --> 1:52:37.320]  I mean, it's hilarious.
[1:52:37.320 --> 1:52:40.040]  But at the same time, it is so disconcerting.
[1:52:40.040 --> 1:52:41.960]  I mean, you go through this AP news article.
[1:52:41.960 --> 1:52:46.200]  They say there's racism in South Korea, the United States, Hong Kong, Europe,
[1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:50.280]  Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Japan, all of this racism.
[1:52:50.280 --> 1:52:54.120]  Mike, how can we ever recover from the greatest evil mankind has ever known
[1:52:54.120 --> 1:52:54.520]  racism?
[1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:56.600]  Meanwhile, there is a virus out there.
[1:52:56.600 --> 1:52:57.880]  And please correct me if I'm wrong.
[1:52:57.880 --> 1:52:58.760]  I honestly hope I am.
[1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:00.600]  But it sounds like 10 percent.
[1:53:00.600 --> 1:53:04.200]  I mean, if this thing worst case scenario, 10 percent of all humans could die.
[1:53:04.200 --> 1:53:06.120]  Now, that's not what's important.
[1:53:06.120 --> 1:53:07.720]  What's important is the racism.
[1:53:07.720 --> 1:53:11.640]  You cannot be racist as you die in a hospital somewhere for your body to be
[1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:13.880]  pre-made and your dogs and cats were killed a week before.
[1:53:14.920 --> 1:53:18.920]  Now, imagine if this were released by white scientists.
[1:53:18.920 --> 1:53:22.120]  The New York Times would say, see, look, white people are bad.
[1:53:22.120 --> 1:53:24.200]  White people are trying to kill everybody in the world.
[1:53:24.200 --> 1:53:28.440]  Look, all these white scientists, they released a white virus that turns your
[1:53:28.440 --> 1:53:30.440]  lungs white and it kills you.
[1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:33.240]  I mean, that if this were released by white people, it would be,
[1:53:33.240 --> 1:53:38.600]  you know, Nazism would be like Hitler combined with a virus.
[1:53:38.600 --> 1:53:43.000]  It would be, you know, swastika shaped viruses under the electron microscope.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:44.200]  It would be the worst thing ever.
[1:53:44.200 --> 1:53:48.600]  But since this came out of China, you have to lovingly accept it and be
[1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:53.560]  tolerant because you don't want to be seen as racist because this is a Chinese virus.
[1:53:54.840 --> 1:53:59.000]  Well, that's why I married a Chinese from Taiwan.
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:02.680]  I'm not racist and Taiwan's doing a great job at defending against
[1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:06.120]  this. It's not, it's not the Chinese genes.
[1:54:06.120 --> 1:54:08.280]  It's the government. It's communism that's behind this.
[1:54:08.280 --> 1:54:10.840]  It's the lies and the lack of transparency of communism.
[1:54:10.840 --> 1:54:11.800]  That's the problem here.
[1:54:13.320 --> 1:54:14.520]  You said it perfectly.
[1:54:14.520 --> 1:54:16.840]  I mean, the entire reason why this is so out of control.
[1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:20.760]  I mean, China, they have their shining cities where they build a massive city.
[1:54:20.760 --> 1:54:21.960]  Nobody even lives in it.
[1:54:21.960 --> 1:54:26.360]  But it was a great public work project that China has their industrialized parts
[1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:29.880]  of the country where, of course, you have to wear a mask even on a perfectly
[1:54:29.880 --> 1:54:33.560]  normal day where there's no viral outbreak just because the air quality is so bad.
[1:54:33.560 --> 1:54:36.520]  But a lot of China is still incredibly rural, incredibly poor.
[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:40.040]  I mean, for a lot of folks, I think you pointed out their primary source of water
[1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:41.000]  is not running water.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:43.320]  It's not from the city municipal water supply.
[1:54:43.320 --> 1:54:44.760]  It's from the Yangtze River.
[1:54:44.760 --> 1:54:48.360]  It's from, you know, running water where people, where runoff goes into,
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:50.120]  where human waste goes into.
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:52.120]  That's where they go get their cooking water.
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:54.680]  This is a very poor country and it's because of the government.
[1:54:54.680 --> 1:54:59.080]  It is because they have suffered under the yoke of communism for the longest amount of
[1:54:59.080 --> 1:55:01.480]  time in history now since the Soviet Union has gone.
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:03.880]  All these other countries have disappeared.
[1:55:03.880 --> 1:55:06.920]  So, I mean, obviously, we all know how severe this is.
[1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:09.080]  You've done an amazing job of breaking it down.
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:13.560]  What should folks be doing to prepare for, you know, you always hope for the best,
[1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:14.200]  prepare for the worst?
[1:55:14.200 --> 1:55:15.960]  What should the viewers and the listeners be doing?
[1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:17.640]  I'm glad you asked that.
[1:55:17.640 --> 1:55:19.480]  Yeah, we've got to get to solutions here.
[1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:22.280]  Number one, stay informed.
[1:55:22.280 --> 1:55:26.280]  You know, read national file, info wars, naturalnews.com, zero hedge,
[1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:27.560]  the other independent media sources.
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:29.400]  That's the only place you're going to get the truth.
[1:55:29.400 --> 1:55:31.160]  Stay informed so you know what's coming.
[1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:35.320]  Secondly, look, even if this kills, let's say 10% of the world population.
[1:55:35.320 --> 1:55:37.320]  That means nine out of 10 people survive it.
[1:55:37.960 --> 1:55:41.800]  And how hard is it to be in among those nine out of 10?
[1:55:41.800 --> 1:55:47.080]  If you support your immune function, you take good supplements, you eat healthy,
[1:55:47.080 --> 1:55:50.920]  you lay off the junk foods, you have basic fitness, do some walking.
[1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:52.760]  Come on, take care of your health.
[1:55:52.760 --> 1:55:53.880]  You can overcome this.
[1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:55.640]  People are being cured right now.
[1:55:55.640 --> 1:55:57.240]  People are overcoming this on their own.
[1:55:57.240 --> 1:55:59.960]  Some people never show any symptoms whatsoever.
[1:55:59.960 --> 1:56:02.280]  So a lot of this comes down to what is your health?
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:07.320]  If you live a sedentary lifestyle, living on junk foods and taking toxic medications
[1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:11.240]  and eating pesticides and GMOs all day, you're probably not going to have as good
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:13.560]  a survival chance as someone who lives a healthier lifestyle.
[1:56:13.560 --> 1:56:16.360]  It's just basic nutrition and biochemistry.
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:17.240]  So right there.
[1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:18.920]  And then secondly, you can protect yourself.
[1:56:18.920 --> 1:56:20.120]  You can isolate yourself.
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:21.960]  You can wash your hands.
[1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:23.320]  You can avoid crowded areas.
[1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:24.600]  You can move out of the city.
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:29.560]  You can get away from the sanctuary cities where this is likely to spread far more aggressively
[1:56:29.560 --> 1:56:30.760]  if it gets into the United States.
[1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:34.920]  So a lot of things that you can do, I'm sure that you're already doing those things as well too,
[1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:35.560]  Tom, right?
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:36.120]  Am I right?
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:37.960]  Well, absolutely.
[1:56:37.960 --> 1:56:39.560]  I mean, it's just basic common sense.
[1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:41.240]  You keep yourself healthy.
[1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:42.120]  You eat a salad.
[1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:43.560]  You get vitamin C supplements.
[1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:45.400]  You get a good iodine.
[1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:48.280]  You get the fantastic products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:53.960]  And of course, I don't think they could pull it off here in America, but should 45, 55,
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:56:58.680]  65, 65 million Americans be quarantined, you're going to want to be able to eat while that happens.
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:01.880]  And of course, you can get storeable food at InfoWarsStore.com as well.
[1:57:03.640 --> 1:57:04.840]  Well, absolutely.
[1:57:04.840 --> 1:57:10.200]  Get your supplies now because if this breaks containment in Asia, then the demand for supplies
[1:57:10.200 --> 1:57:11.960]  is going to skyrocket even more.
[1:57:12.520 --> 1:57:13.800]  But thank you for watching.
