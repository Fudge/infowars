[00:00.000 --> 00:12.860]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:12.860 --> 00:35.780]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:35.780 --> 00:42.780]  Thank you for joining us on this live September 9, 2019, Monday Global Transmission.
[00:42.780 --> 00:49.780]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here for the next four hours, Lord willing.
[00:49.780 --> 00:55.780]  Well, I talk a lot about it, especially when we start the week off each Monday, and that's
[00:55.780 --> 00:58.780]  that the great quickening is here.
[00:58.780 --> 01:08.780]  It's very clear that we're entering a storm of shockwaves that are precursors to jumps
[01:08.780 --> 01:14.780]  in human intelligence and jumps in technology that I would say is something akin to what
[01:14.780 --> 01:18.780]  Ray Kurzweil and others have talked about being the singularity.
[01:18.780 --> 01:23.780]  But they're attempting to create an artificial singularity, something that appears to be a
[01:23.780 --> 01:30.780]  singularity, a monopoly, ahead of any real singularity, which will free us to a great extent
[01:30.780 --> 01:33.780]  from their systems of control.
[01:33.780 --> 01:39.780]  Now, so much of what I've specifically word for word laid out has now come out in mainstream
[01:39.780 --> 01:40.780]  news today.
[01:40.780 --> 01:42.780]  This is just the last few days.
[01:42.780 --> 01:48.780]  This stack in front of me or a TV viewer of probably 60, 70 documents and articles of
[01:48.780 --> 01:57.780]  MIT being basically run by Bill Gates and a group behind Bill Gates carrying out genetic
[01:57.780 --> 02:01.780]  engineering, cloning, and eugenics experiments.
[02:01.780 --> 02:05.780]  In fact, I had it in here last week, and I think they cleaned it up.
[02:05.780 --> 02:10.780]  Somebody go to the office and get me eco science because that was taken out of this office
[02:10.780 --> 02:14.780]  because I asked the broadcast area to be cleaned up, and I guess they took that book out.
[02:14.780 --> 02:15.780]  Please bring it back.
[02:15.780 --> 02:23.780]  But you need to understand that this information has been out there for a long time.
[02:23.780 --> 02:29.780]  And so that's why it's becoming mainstream now, and people are really blown away by all
[02:29.780 --> 02:30.780]  of this.
[02:30.780 --> 02:41.780]  But now the Media Lab director of MIT that's been directing a lot of censorship, a lot of
[02:41.780 --> 02:47.780]  validation, a lot of control, it turns out was on the payroll of Bill Gates through
[02:47.780 --> 02:52.780]  Jeffrey Epstein, and this was after Epstein was already a convicted pedo.
[02:52.780 --> 02:55.780]  And so it shows you how deep this goes.
[02:55.780 --> 02:57.780]  But I'm going to explain this again.
[02:57.780 --> 03:03.780]  It came out in the Wall Street Journal in the ABC News and in the London Guardian 11 years
[03:03.780 --> 03:06.780]  ago when their security was breached and was exposed.
[03:06.780 --> 03:10.780]  They had this secret organization pushing depopulation and world government.
[03:10.780 --> 03:15.780]  That's Wall Street Journal reporting that, that they put out puff pieces saying how great
[03:15.780 --> 03:20.780]  it is that these billionaires want to save the earth and save all of us.
[03:20.780 --> 03:22.780]  People ask, how did I know all this?
[03:22.780 --> 03:26.780]  I was born 45 years ago when this book was published, Eco Science.
[03:26.780 --> 03:31.780]  It's a textbook for PhD and above on how to carry out world government, how to carry out
[03:31.780 --> 03:36.780]  eugenics, how to carry out sterilization with fluoride in the water.
[03:36.780 --> 03:44.780]  And this is Obama's best buddy, you know, 37 years later became the head.
[03:44.780 --> 03:46.780]  Sciences are.
[03:46.780 --> 03:48.780]  So that's who they are.
[03:48.780 --> 03:51.780]  And of course, he was a protege of the Rockefeller Foundation.
[03:51.780 --> 03:55.780]  So when we go over all of this, it's a really big deal.
[03:55.780 --> 04:01.780]  But if Trump wanted to take down the real deep state, it's a transhumanist eugenics-based cult.
[04:01.780 --> 04:03.780]  And this is exactly how he'd do it.
[04:03.780 --> 04:08.780]  It's a positive that all the stuff coming out on Epstein is being directed specifically
[04:08.780 --> 04:13.780]  not just about underage girls or other people being abused, even tortured, killed.
[04:13.780 --> 04:14.780]  That's important.
[04:14.780 --> 04:16.780]  But that's just how they compromise the scientists.
[04:16.780 --> 04:21.780]  This was a way to compromise the scientific community and bring them in to the eugenics cult.
[04:21.780 --> 04:26.780]  And this is groundbreaking research here that no one else has laid out.
[04:26.780 --> 04:29.780]  And we're giving you the answer to the entire equation.
[04:29.780 --> 04:34.780]  We can fight the New World Order on a thousand fronts and it's hundreds of big fat heads.
[04:34.780 --> 04:36.780]  You cut one off and sprouts another.
[04:36.780 --> 04:42.780]  But the heart of this giant stinking serpent is the transhumanist Luciferian cult.
[04:42.780 --> 04:46.780]  And if you're aware of that, then you don't strike it the heads.
[04:46.780 --> 04:52.780]  You fire a big spear right into its fetid stinking pump.
[04:52.780 --> 04:54.780]  We'll talk about it all on the other side.
[04:54.780 --> 04:59.780]  I mean, all that metaphorically, of course, I'm not violent.
[05:24.780 --> 05:31.780]  The answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals
[05:31.780 --> 05:38.780]  to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.
[05:38.780 --> 05:42.780]  Watch your favorite content from media personalities banned by Big Tech.

[06:22.780 --> 06:33.780]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:33.780 --> 06:37.780]  Thank you so much for joining us on this September 9, 2019 Monday.
[06:37.780 --> 06:38.780]  Global transmission.
[06:38.780 --> 06:42.780]  Let me tell you what's coming up today.
[06:42.780 --> 06:55.780]  The entire edifice, the facade of MIT and Stanford Research Institute.
[06:55.780 --> 07:08.780]  The two twin heads of the deep state transhumanist eugenics operation here in the United States are in deep trouble.
[07:08.780 --> 07:12.780]  The ruling class has an ideology.
[07:12.780 --> 07:14.780]  They have a goal.
[07:14.780 --> 07:16.780]  They have a mission.
[07:16.780 --> 07:21.780]  They believe that they are uber mention or super men.
[07:21.780 --> 07:27.780]  That wasn't invented back in the 40s by comic bookmakers here in the United States.
[07:27.780 --> 07:31.780]  The Nazis believe they were creating the super man.
[07:31.780 --> 07:37.780]  And most cultures believe that they are the super man, but they are the uber mention.
[07:37.780 --> 07:53.780]  The uber man, the ascendant man, homo sapiens supremus, or the new age dawn of the new creature.
[07:53.780 --> 08:00.780]  And now we're told that, oh, the obvious supreme being will soon be amongst us as Ray Kurzweil has said.
[08:00.780 --> 08:02.780]  He doesn't believe in God yet.
[08:02.780 --> 08:04.780]  He will become a God.
[08:04.780 --> 08:08.780]  He will always know that pride goes before the fall, doesn't it?
[08:08.780 --> 08:10.780]  But they're telling us resistance is futile.
[08:10.780 --> 08:11.780]  Lay down and die.
[08:11.780 --> 08:14.780]  You will be assimilated if you're lucky.
[08:14.780 --> 08:28.780]  Well, MIT media lab director, Joy Ito, resigns after New Yorker exposé shows he quietly worked with Epstein to cure anomalous donations from Bill and Melinda Gates, amongst others, even after he was a convicted pedophile.
[08:28.780 --> 08:37.780]  Now, when you look into this, they're all trying to act like they have no connection to Jeffrey Epstein and burning a few people who are the go betweens.
[08:37.780 --> 08:52.780]  Epstein headed up the transhumanist group inside MIT and inside Harvard and inside the Albert Einstein University and Institute in New York City.
[08:52.780 --> 08:54.780]  Now, this has been on ABC News.
[08:54.780 --> 08:56.780]  This has been on the Wall Street Journal.
[08:56.780 --> 08:58.780]  It's been in The New York Times.
[08:58.780 --> 08:59.780]  It's been the London Guardian.
[08:59.780 --> 09:05.780]  Eleven years ago, there were a few exposés on the things they were doing at this group.
[09:05.780 --> 09:07.780]  Oprah Winfrey's part of it.
[09:07.780 --> 09:08.780]  Ted Turner.
[09:08.780 --> 09:12.780]  All your usual suspects that want to depopulate the planet.
[09:12.780 --> 09:15.780]  All your Luciferian folks.
[09:15.780 --> 09:17.780]  And they even admit they're into this.
[09:17.780 --> 09:27.780]  And so they had pub pieces going, well, yes, billionaires are meeting in secret to fix world population, and they're calling it an alternate world government.
[09:27.780 --> 09:32.780]  So this was directed by Jeffrey Epstein.
[09:32.780 --> 09:46.780]  He was the nexus point between these institutions and also with Nobel laureates and with the Royal Institutes in England and in France.
[09:46.780 --> 09:52.780]  And their main job was making sure that all the major scientific groups in the world are on the same page.
[09:52.780 --> 09:55.780]  On geoengineering, that's weather modification.
[09:55.780 --> 09:59.780]  Basically terraforming when you're changing a planet from what it was to something else.
[09:59.780 --> 10:00.780]  That's beyond geoengineering.
[10:00.780 --> 10:22.780]  Terraforming, mind control, genetic engineering, cloning, animal human hybrid so that you can grow humanoids inside cows up to an adult size of 70, 80, 90 pounds to get larger organs for transplant.
[10:22.780 --> 10:37.780]  They had deals with Communist China to carry this out and I'm going to release something after the break that is totally classified that no one knows and that is going to break here on air.
[10:37.780 --> 10:48.780]  And just to show the CIA and FBI and everybody that what I'm going to say is true, I'm going to release something else highly classified on air.
[10:48.780 --> 10:53.780]  In fact, it's so dangerous, I'm going to go ahead and do it right now.
[10:53.780 --> 11:02.780]  Obama, after he was in office one year, reached out to China and they said, we want to finish the world government.
[11:02.780 --> 11:20.780]  You have begun to violate your agreement that the Rockefellers and the MacArthur and Knight Foundation and others set up with you in the agreements that were quietly signed in the 60s but that were implemented in the 70s.
[11:20.780 --> 11:25.780]  Nixon was lied to about why they were doing it, but full picture came out.
[11:25.780 --> 11:27.780]  You're not supposed to be militarily expansive.
[11:27.780 --> 11:31.780]  We run that, but you're given all industry, all rare earth minerals.
[11:31.780 --> 11:33.780]  You're given all the major deep water parts.
[11:33.780 --> 11:39.780]  You're given economic power, but then we divided up where we're then a military power, so we're dependent on each other.
[11:39.780 --> 11:49.780]  And you see that in movies like Rollerball that's based on real trilateral commission agreements where one city, there's not nation states anymore, one city runs energy globally.
[11:49.780 --> 11:50.780]  That's Houston.
[11:50.780 --> 11:52.780]  Then another city in the world runs all the military.
[11:52.780 --> 12:02.780]  Another city runs all of the high tech and then war is reduced down to champions or down to blood sport, going back to the medieval times.
[12:02.780 --> 12:11.780]  That's actually the globalist model is to collapse nation states, then have city states that are above the law controlling the impoverished masses outside of their gates.
[12:11.780 --> 12:16.780]  Then they make movies like Hunger Games in the modern context based on those books that tell you how it all works.
[12:16.780 --> 12:27.780]  So I'll do it after the break because I've thought a lot about this and I've almost released this a couple of years ago.
[12:27.780 --> 12:38.780]  And then I just happened to run into a lot of folks that have worked at Army Special Operations and in Blackwater and the CIA.
[12:38.780 --> 12:52.780]  And I was able to ask them about this over the last few years and another individual I really respect, the State Department, the CIA, a bunch of other agencies said absolutely and one of his friends worked there and saw it.
[12:52.780 --> 13:07.780]  So I'm going to go ahead and tell you something on the other side so that everybody listening understands in government that when I release this, I'm going to release something else super classified, highest level.
[13:07.780 --> 13:12.780]  What do you think the wedding ring or the engagement ring would look like with China with Obama?
[13:12.780 --> 13:18.780]  What would China do with his consort? What would he bring his lovely bride?
[13:18.780 --> 13:22.780]  I guess we're getting, we're the one catching, so we're the bride.
[13:22.780 --> 13:29.780]  What would Obama bring his buck? What would Obama bring his daddy?
[13:29.780 --> 13:34.780]  I'm going to tell you what he brought his daddy.
[13:34.780 --> 13:39.780]  And you're not going to get this. Let me explain something. This isn't macho stuff bringing this thing out.
[13:39.780 --> 13:44.780]  I'm doing this because if we're not going to meet these people that we don't start admitting just how evil they are.
[13:44.780 --> 13:59.780]  Now it came out in court transcripts that are quoted in live site news that they are keeping babies alive and harvesting their organs and Stanford Research Institutes getting their hearts while they're still beating.
[13:59.780 --> 14:01.780]  They're getting gutted on the spot.
[14:01.780 --> 14:10.780]  It gets into all this, but if you think we're doing that on American soil, which is admitted, what do you think is going on in China?
[14:10.780 --> 14:17.780]  See, China is where you go, where you do whatever you want as long as you're in with the party.
[14:17.780 --> 14:21.780]  You want to beat the maid to death or your wife? Go ahead.
[14:21.780 --> 14:28.780]  You want to stab somebody in the street? Go ahead. You can do whatever you want if you're an insider in China.
[14:28.780 --> 14:32.780]  It is the most godless, satanic place on earth.
[14:32.780 --> 14:37.780]  And we're going to tie all this together when we come back separately.
[14:37.780 --> 14:40.780]  I'm trying to expand in the face of the enemy attacks.
[14:40.780 --> 14:48.780]  2020 is obviously a critical year for us to be on air fighting for nationalism, populism and freedom and keep in trouble to straighten narrow.
[14:48.780 --> 14:53.780]  We do have to end the special today because we will sell out of the carnivore 90 digestive enzyme.
[14:53.780 --> 14:59.780]  It's so amazing and you just need to get it and find out for yourself. A 90 count costs $17.80 something cents for each bottle.
[14:59.780 --> 15:01.780]  It doesn't matter. We're only selling for like 40 bucks.
[15:01.780 --> 15:06.780]  I'm putting a free bottle with every bottle of DNA Force Plus at 50% off in there.
[15:06.780 --> 15:13.780]  It will sell out today and we'll still have DNA Force Plus at 50% off with all its amazing benefits.
[15:13.780 --> 15:16.780]  It regrows nerves. It makes your telomeres last longer.
[15:16.780 --> 15:23.780]  I'm going to say this because it's patented. PQQ, CoQ10, everything else in it is the best you're going to find anywhere.
[15:23.780 --> 15:26.780]  They sell similar formulas for $300, $400 because they're marked up seven times at medical facilities and labs.
[15:26.780 --> 15:31.780]  But other people sell $50 of PQQ when it's synthetic and not even have as strong as ours.
[15:31.780 --> 15:35.780]  Ours has the PQQ, the CoQ10, everything in it. It's an incredible deal for $74.95.
[15:35.780 --> 15:39.780]  It's our most expensive product and it almost has no markup at this price.
[15:39.780 --> 15:41.780]  But I want you to get both these products together.
[15:41.780 --> 15:47.780]  That's all I have to get in today on the free carnivore, m4store.com, m4slife.com, or triple 82533139.
[15:47.780 --> 15:51.780]  Don't forget our new video site that has all our videos in one place and works really great.
[15:51.780 --> 16:12.780]  It's band.video. Please check it out and then spread the word.
[16:21.780 --> 16:26.780]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:51.780 --> 16:56.780]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system
[16:56.780 --> 17:01.780]  that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[17:01.780 --> 17:07.780]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[17:07.780 --> 17:11.780]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[17:11.780 --> 17:14.780]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here,
[17:14.780 --> 17:21.780]  right on the east bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[17:21.780 --> 17:26.780]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[17:26.780 --> 17:28.780]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:28.780 --> 17:34.780]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:34.780 --> 17:36.780]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:36.780 --> 17:38.780]  Over a thousand dollars a year.
[17:38.780 --> 17:44.780]  And a ton of bonuses too. In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[17:44.780 --> 17:47.780]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[17:47.780 --> 17:50.780]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:50.780 --> 17:53.780]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[17:53.780 --> 17:59.780]  Alex, God bless you. I have an idea for a new info wars t-shirt instead of this is your brain.
[17:59.780 --> 18:03.780]  This is your brain on drugs. This is your brain on drugs.
[18:03.780 --> 18:08.780]  This is your brain. This is your brain on 5G.
[18:08.780 --> 18:12.780]  Showing your brain, getting frat. Then I have some comments on your supplements.
[18:12.780 --> 18:20.780]  Man, totally changed my life. I use Turboforce bodies, Albu power, Brain Force, Fish Oil, Ultra 12, Daily, X2 every several days.
[18:20.780 --> 18:28.780]  Now, what I've found is really combining them is totally synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products.
[18:28.780 --> 18:32.780]  And I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not.
[18:32.780 --> 18:35.780]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible.
[18:35.780 --> 18:42.780]  Whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[18:42.780 --> 18:50.780]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body. You take these bases together, then you have your foundation, now you can build the big strong temple.
[18:50.780 --> 18:54.780]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[18:54.780 --> 18:58.780]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical. Thank you so much. God bless you.
[18:58.780 --> 19:03.780]  And that's why we're introducing what we know is going to be a massive bestseller, Chill Force.
[19:03.780 --> 19:06.780]  Now let's look at what's in this powerful formula.
[19:06.780 --> 19:13.780]  Ashwagandha root extract, an ancient medicinal herb used for over 3,000 years to treat stress and relax the patient.
[19:13.780 --> 19:22.780]  L-theony, a special amino acid naturally found in some tea leaves. The compound has been called the stress killer because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[19:22.780 --> 19:29.780]  Gabba, an important neurotransmitter that controls functions of the body and mind, including nervous system relaxation.
[19:29.780 --> 19:32.780]  Gabba is a choice for many to help reduce anxiety.
[19:32.780 --> 19:37.780]  Rodeola rosea root extract, found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.
[19:37.780 --> 19:45.780]  This root is considered a super adaptogen and is believed to help the body in the fight against emotional, mental and physical stress.
[19:45.780 --> 19:53.780]  It's time to do what I did and take action with the Chill Force Challenge at InfoWarsLive.com.
[20:16.780 --> 20:26.780]  Is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[20:32.780 --> 20:38.780]  You want to know how deep the rabbit hole goes? I'm going to lay it out right now.
[20:38.780 --> 20:48.780]  Think about the ultra-rich of this planet, some of which have yachts as big as World War II battleships.
[20:48.780 --> 20:58.780]  They have multiple jumbo jet airplanes apiece, hundreds of giant palaces and homes, huge private islands.
[20:58.780 --> 21:07.780]  And so a lot of them get into decadence. They get into pedophilia. They get into Satanism. They get into the occult.
[21:07.780 --> 21:11.780]  Others flip out and give all their money to charity.
[21:11.780 --> 21:17.780]  But the steadfast group that stays in control is the scientific elite.
[21:17.780 --> 21:20.780]  And thousands of years ago, that would be the priesthood.
[21:20.780 --> 21:25.780]  They were just people that studied the stars and studied elements and tried to understand how matter worked.
[21:25.780 --> 21:28.780]  They were called alchemists.
[21:28.780 --> 21:34.780]  And their tinkering and playing around over thousands of years helped us codify and create the modern sciences.
[21:34.780 --> 21:44.780]  But everyone knows in culture and in reality and in fiction and in lore, you have to beware the mad scientist.
[21:44.780 --> 21:52.780]  Because they have high IQs, but a lot of them are control freaks who want to be able to dominate society.
[21:52.780 --> 22:01.780]  And they use knowledge they have about how the world works against people that do not have the knowledge.
[22:01.780 --> 22:06.780]  And there's many ways to go at this, but here's the best way.
[22:06.780 --> 22:17.780]  Bill Gates, his father that ran Planned Parenthood, Cold Springs Harbor, eugenics operations in New York,
[22:17.780 --> 22:27.780]  are themselves just frontmen for the royalty of Europe, the robber barons, the most powerful families on the planet,
[22:27.780 --> 22:37.780]  who have always believed they are elites, who believe their blood is better, and who believe that they're going to ascend basic megalomania.
[22:37.780 --> 22:45.780]  They finance, starting in the 1850s of the British crown, these royal institutes to discover genetics and how the body worked.
[22:45.780 --> 22:53.780]  And modern science came out of these elites pouring hundreds of trillions of dollars into medicine and research.
[22:53.780 --> 22:59.780]  Hundreds of trillions, if you looked at it in the aggregate, and today's numbers, probably more.
[22:59.780 --> 23:11.780]  And they see the general public as cattle, as energy, as fuel, and as material to construct their better man, their uber mention.
[23:11.780 --> 23:25.780]  And so Jeffrey Epstein was a high-level procurer and provider and a frontman to go and basically finance a lot of undercover black project,
[23:25.780 --> 23:35.780]  secret private research, into cloning, into genetic engineering and animal human hybrids.
[23:35.780 --> 23:41.780]  And China admits that they've been pioneering this, but keeping it under wraps for decades and decades.
[23:41.780 --> 23:49.780]  I mean, I remember 15 years ago it was on national Chinese television how they had cows that produced human milk through their udders
[23:49.780 --> 23:53.780]  and have had mass production to the public for over a decade.
[23:53.780 --> 24:05.780]  Years ago, military bases in the United States had goats that created spider webs in their milk to produce body armor and super ropes and other super material,
[24:05.780 --> 24:11.780]  again, for this giant global DARPA eugenics transhumanist system.
[24:11.780 --> 24:19.780]  That, again, is a breakaway civilization, straining off all of our energy, our intellect, our money, our time into it.
[24:19.780 --> 24:23.780]  For life extension for the ruling class.
[24:23.780 --> 24:27.780]  And so, of course, Epstein was involved.
[24:27.780 --> 24:41.780]  He headed up the project at Harvard, the project at MIT, and major projects, of course, through Stanford and through the Albert Einstein University.
[24:41.780 --> 24:50.780]  And so they've got a big problem on their hands because this rabbit hole goes all the way to the bottom of where this is going.
[24:50.780 --> 24:57.780]  So let me first get into this and then I'll get into the rabbit hole and the cloning and why this is such a big deal and how this is coming out.
[24:57.780 --> 25:03.780]  Because these guys all believe they're supermen, they believe that they have a right to rule, they believe they're going to find the life extension,
[25:03.780 --> 25:05.780]  they believe they're not going to die.
[25:05.780 --> 25:07.780]  David Rockefeller told people, I'm not going to die.
[25:07.780 --> 25:09.780]  He lived to 100.
[25:09.780 --> 25:15.780]  General Stubblebine, formerly headed up the army, he said he wasn't going to die because they really believed all this.
[25:15.780 --> 25:17.780]  And Stubblebine wasn't a bad guy.
[25:17.780 --> 25:20.780]  He'd been working for them before and then wasn't working for him.
[25:20.780 --> 25:27.780]  But he was charged with finding all this stuff as well in order to do it.
[25:27.780 --> 25:35.780]  So let's shift gears into another angle of this.
[25:35.780 --> 25:43.780]  China has been given our industry one side of deals, all the rarest minerals, 98% of them, all the major deep water ports, the Panama Canal,
[25:43.780 --> 25:56.780]  the giant so-called hack of the federal database of all the names opposite personnel management was another gift from Obama to the Chai comms to show them,
[25:56.780 --> 26:04.780]  hey, don't pivot, don't be military, don't break your deal to only do manufacturing and dominate that, will dominate military.
[26:04.780 --> 26:06.780]  This is the new world order plan you're breaking in.
[26:06.780 --> 26:08.780]  Well, of course, they double crossed you.
[26:08.780 --> 26:15.780]  So Obama trying to get the Chai comms to stop going into the South China Sea and stop weaponizing like they promised not to do.
[26:15.780 --> 26:18.780]  They were just given defensive nuclear weapons and all this stuff by the Clintons.
[26:18.780 --> 26:22.780]  They double crossed the other globalist group.
[26:22.780 --> 26:24.780]  Of course, it's all these scum dude.
[26:24.780 --> 26:29.780]  And so Obama said, I'll give you all our personnel's names worldwide, all the codes to everything.
[26:29.780 --> 26:32.780]  I'll order Apple and Google to move over there and build all the censorship systems.
[26:32.780 --> 26:36.780]  You'll have the code keys to all Americans' iPhones and droids.
[26:36.780 --> 26:38.780]  You'll have everything.
[26:38.780 --> 26:39.780]  Still wasn't enough.
[26:39.780 --> 26:41.780]  It was all a deeper double cross.
[26:41.780 --> 26:47.780]  But some globalists involved for the Chinese century, the communist Chinese century.
[26:47.780 --> 26:55.780]  And then by a couple of years into Obama, we stopped using black sites in Egypt.
[26:55.780 --> 27:02.780]  Obama's going to overthrow that in the Arab Spring and in Jordan in places or in Romania or Hungary.
[27:02.780 --> 27:04.780]  Those are torture facilities.
[27:04.780 --> 27:09.780]  Almost all of our real black sites, I mean the globalists, but they call them ours.
[27:09.780 --> 27:11.780]  Well, I'm talking about they was just a research laboratory.
[27:11.780 --> 27:12.780]  That's a front.
[27:12.780 --> 27:13.780]  That's a diversion.
[27:13.780 --> 27:14.780]  That's a decoy.
[27:14.780 --> 27:24.780]  We're moved to China and not just Taliban and al-Qaeda, but European citizens, U.S. citizens were taken to China.
[27:24.780 --> 27:33.780]  Into underground laboratories where the torture is beyond anything you've probably ever even heard of.
[27:33.780 --> 27:53.780]  And black water that turned into its newest names under Eric Prince, that's how Prince got his entree into his frontiers group that he has now into Africa.
[27:53.780 --> 27:59.780]  And that's how his, again, frontier groups, the new name.
[27:59.780 --> 28:18.780]  That's how they got the Chinese contract for Africa is that under the CIA, not just black water, but other contractor groups ran Chinese torture facilities inside China.
[28:18.780 --> 28:23.780]  And that's how far Obama went.
[28:23.780 --> 28:25.780]  And I'm not even blaming black water.
[28:25.780 --> 28:26.780]  Because they didn't do the torture.
[28:26.780 --> 28:29.780]  They just guarded the facilities.
[28:29.780 --> 28:33.780]  But helicopters and planes would land black boxes with people in them.
[28:33.780 --> 28:34.780]  You wouldn't even see them.
[28:34.780 --> 28:41.780]  Black cages, walled black boxes would be sent into an underground base with the chai comms.
[28:41.780 --> 28:46.780]  And then the CIA and their doctors would go in there and nobody ever came out.
[28:46.780 --> 28:51.780]  Now that's how evil Obama is, running death camps, torture camps in China.
[28:51.780 --> 28:54.780]  We got more coming up.
[28:54.780 --> 29:21.780]  You think I won't stop?
[29:21.780 --> 29:25.780]  The blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.780 --> 29:29.780]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:29.780 --> 29:31.780]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:31.780 --> 29:58.780]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[32:17.780 --> 32:22.780]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen. It's now live. Band.video.
[32:22.780 --> 32:29.780]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson banned videos.
[32:29.780 --> 32:34.780]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted.
[32:34.780 --> 32:42.780]  And we're a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored,
[32:42.780 --> 32:48.780]  free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum and the globalists.
[32:48.780 --> 32:52.780]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called Band.video.
[32:52.780 --> 32:58.780]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at Band.video.
[32:58.780 --> 33:03.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:29.780 --> 33:37.780]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host. We're live here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[33:37.780 --> 33:43.780]  And the establishment has really worked around the clock to try to get us off air and try to stop us from reaching new people.
[33:43.780 --> 33:50.780]  But because of you understanding that and supporting us and spreading the word, we are having a greater effect than ever.
[33:50.780 --> 34:02.780]  Especially with the thinking folks who are in positions of power across this country and planet, but not part of the shadow global eugenics-based state.
[34:02.780 --> 34:10.780]  Because the operating system of this authoritarian group of corporates, of fascists who use communism and socialism and things to control the public,
[34:10.780 --> 34:19.780]  but who are really corporate fascist technocrats at the end of the day, is that they use our ignorance obviously against us.
[34:19.780 --> 34:26.780]  And if we're aware of what makes them tick, then everything makes sense, then you know how to oppose them.
[34:26.780 --> 34:33.780]  You know the crimes they've committed. It has just come out in court cases in California.
[34:33.780 --> 34:49.780]  StemExpress CEO admits selling beating baby hearts intact, ladies and gentlemen, beating baby hearts intact to Stanford Research.
[34:49.780 --> 34:59.780]  And whole babies, whole eight, nine month old babies who never had their brains sucked out inside the vaginal canal, like federal and state law says they have to be.
[34:59.780 --> 35:04.780]  They get outside onto the gurney, onto the bed, they have to be adopted.
[35:04.780 --> 35:11.780]  Well, there's folks who have already paid for those livers and kidneys and paid for that blood and that skin to melt down into collagen.
[35:11.780 --> 35:21.780]  They're going to get their deliveries, just like if you called up the butcher and ordered five or six rib-eyes to cook out for the game next Sunday.
[35:21.780 --> 35:31.780]  So that's all part of the dehumanization. And that ties in to China and the human animal clones and the torture facilities and all of it.
[35:31.780 --> 35:39.780]  But the United States didn't just have illegal torture sites in Eastern Europe or the Middle East.
[35:39.780 --> 35:46.780]  They had them, ladies and gentlemen, in China under Obama. We were fully wed to China.
[35:46.780 --> 35:53.780]  China was, again, given all the code keys of the Apple phones, they were given all the systems to any company based there.
[35:53.780 --> 36:05.780]  And Apple admitted that and said in the Reuters article that, well, when you're in China, the government is in control of your company.
[36:05.780 --> 36:08.780]  That was all done under orders from Obama and the globalist.
[36:08.780 --> 36:16.780]  Well, Trump got in and that whole agenda is being reversed right now to a great extent.
[36:16.780 --> 36:21.780]  Trump is blocking Huawei and their 5G that can break into all your computers and also causes cancer in major studies.
[36:21.780 --> 36:26.780]  Even LA Times reports that. But notice Trump's going ahead with the 5G with U.S. companies.
[36:26.780 --> 36:35.780]  Notice Trump's going ahead and saying, oh, we're looking at having red flag laws that violate due process carried out by big tech.
[36:35.780 --> 36:40.780]  Where the devices in your home listen to you and they are listening to you.
[36:40.780 --> 36:51.780]  They now admit what I told you over a decade ago and we're going to report it back and take your guns or put you in a mental institution because it's not just dealing with guns.
[36:51.780 --> 36:55.780]  And here's a few headlines about that.
[36:55.780 --> 36:58.780]  Google is always listening.
[36:58.780 --> 37:05.780]  Now is watching too with the Nest Hub Max.
[37:05.780 --> 37:08.780]  And that's seen at news.
[37:08.780 --> 37:17.780]  That's the Washington Post with headlines saying that they are watching you.
[37:17.780 --> 37:24.780]  I'm going to cover that next segment.
[37:24.780 --> 37:30.780]  Washington Post comes out and says, Google is always listening.
[37:30.780 --> 37:34.780]  And now it's watching you.
[37:34.780 --> 37:36.780]  See, now it's the coming out.
[37:36.780 --> 37:40.780]  Now they're going to say, and it's for mass shootings, it's listening to you.
[37:40.780 --> 37:42.780]  It's always been listening.
[37:42.780 --> 37:47.780]  Since the first Alexis went in and the echoes went in, you know, Facebook's got one.
[37:47.780 --> 37:49.780]  Google's got them.
[37:49.780 --> 37:50.780]  Twitter's got one.
[37:50.780 --> 37:51.780]  Google's got one.
[37:51.780 --> 37:53.780]  They've all got them.
[37:53.780 --> 37:58.780]  My oh, really, CIA torture sites in communist China.
[37:58.780 --> 38:05.780]  Really, oh, really my iPhone's listening to me and creating a text file.
[38:05.780 --> 38:12.780]  Everything I say along with an audio file that's recording compressed.
[38:12.780 --> 38:18.780]  And then when your phone is in action, it's sending the compressed data.
[38:18.780 --> 38:25.660]  Not just the text files, but the entire audio files, and now the compression's gotten good
[38:25.660 --> 38:32.700]  enough that with the systems plugged into your walls, Facebook system, Amazon system,
[38:32.700 --> 38:39.540]  all their systems, the Nest, they're all watching, they're all listening, and they're creating
[38:39.540 --> 38:42.740]  that big digital algorithm file on you.
[38:42.740 --> 38:43.940]  And so it's the coming out.
[38:43.940 --> 38:44.940]  It's the emergence.
[38:44.940 --> 38:48.420]  Remember, we talked for decades about they're building it in secret, they're planning it
[38:48.420 --> 38:52.260]  in secret, they're preparing to roll it out, here's all their white papers, here's the
[38:52.260 --> 38:57.700]  admissions, here's the documents, here's where it's taking place, and at a certain point
[38:57.700 --> 39:02.460]  though they've got to emerge with all of it, and that will be the critical time to talk
[39:02.460 --> 39:09.060]  about it, that will be the critical time to expose it, not once it comes out, but before
[39:09.060 --> 39:13.660]  it comes out, so that people know the truth, because remember they denied it and said it's
[39:13.660 --> 39:20.380]  not happening and it's a conspiracy theory and it's a lie, but it wasn't a lie.
[39:20.380 --> 39:29.260]  It was in the prospectus in 2004 and 2006 of Google to shareholders that we have the
[39:29.260 --> 39:34.420]  patents with the microphones that are on board most computers, and soon they'll be ubiquitous
[39:34.420 --> 39:40.420]  and so will webcams, and we're going to watch and we're going to listen for advertising.
[39:40.420 --> 39:43.220]  And then people started to complain about it five years ago, catching them.
[39:43.220 --> 39:47.780]  You know what, it's in the terms of service, Samsung said, third parties can and will
[39:47.780 --> 39:54.820]  be listening and watching, so watch what you say.
[39:54.820 --> 39:59.700]  Remember what Eric Schmidt said ten years ago, the head of Alphabet and Google, he said,
[39:59.700 --> 40:04.820]  yeah, we're watching everything you do, you better watch what you say and what you do.
[40:04.820 --> 40:10.420]  But when he puts his girlfriend on a jumbo jet, they all wear masks so no one knows who
[40:10.420 --> 40:16.300]  the women are, because if he wants a particular Hollywood star, he'll pay her half million
[40:16.300 --> 40:21.300]  dollars to have sex, whether for the weekend, it's well known, and that's his business.
[40:21.300 --> 40:26.660]  But the point is, he doesn't like his business coming out, you see, they are all secret.
[40:26.660 --> 40:32.580]  They all can do whatever they want, but you, they told you, don't listen to that, take
[40:32.580 --> 40:39.780]  the smartphone, take the Nest system, take the Alexa in, and then the Washington Post
[40:39.780 --> 40:46.420]  has that big article cover after the break, where they're criticizing how you're being
[40:46.420 --> 40:51.340]  listened to and watched by Google, and they're not telling you that old Alexa is listening
[40:51.340 --> 40:53.340]  to you and it's coming out with video too.
[40:53.340 --> 40:58.780]  So it's all a big race, remember two years ago, Facebook came out and has a camera that
[40:58.780 --> 41:07.380]  follows you in your house, and it could send out sonar, radar, just like ten years ago,
[41:07.380 --> 41:13.780]  it can access to what it can see through your walls, Google's got a new face tracking camera
[41:13.780 --> 41:19.740]  for your home, we've got questions, isn't that just cute, Google's always listening,
[41:19.740 --> 41:30.660]  now it's watching too, with the Nest Hub Max, suddenly, in September of 2019, they're just
[41:30.660 --> 41:37.700]  like, oh, by the way, we've been watching and listening the whole time, and we're going
[41:37.700 --> 41:40.220]  to take your guns and your kids and everything else, so you better sit down, you better shut
[41:40.220 --> 41:47.660]  up, you better roll over, and then we're also going to get more into MIT, and then one of
[41:47.660 --> 41:53.220]  the main directors of it, having to step down because he's a front man for Bill Gates, not
[41:53.220 --> 41:59.940]  Jeffrey Epstein, Epstein wants to go between, it's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen,
[41:59.940 --> 42:03.700]  we're going to go to break, I want to remind everybody that we have the best cream you're

[44:59.580 --> 45:04.420]  we're introducing what we know is going to be a massive bestseller, chill force. Now
[45:04.420 --> 45:10.020]  let's look at what's in this powerful formula, Ashwagandha root extract, an ancient medicinal
[45:10.020 --> 45:15.820]  herb used for over 3000 years to treat stress and relax the patient, L-theony, a special
[45:15.820 --> 45:20.940]  amino acid naturally found in some tea leaves, the compound has been called the stress killer
[45:20.940 --> 45:25.940]  because of its powerful relaxation benefits, GABA, an important neurotransmitter that controls
[45:25.940 --> 45:31.300]  functions of the body and mind including nervous system relaxation, GABA is a choice for many
[45:31.300 --> 45:36.860]  to help reduce anxiety, rhodiola rosea root extract found in the mountainous regions of
[45:36.860 --> 45:41.840]  Europe and Asia, this root is considered a super adaptogen and is believed to help the
[45:41.840 --> 45:46.580]  body in the fight against emotional, mental and physical stress. It's time to do what
[45:46.580 --> 45:51.580]  I did and take action with the chill force challenge at emphowerslive.com.
[45:51.580 --> 46:03.460]  At Emphowerslive, we always try to bring you game changing products. Now we've already
[46:03.460 --> 46:08.460]  been promoting and selling super silver wound gel for over a year, it's a bestseller, it

[46:53.460 --> 47:02.220]  our operations, check it out today and get yours at emphowerslive.com.
[47:02.220 --> 47:26.540]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show, he never gives up, he's Alex Jones, broadcasting
[47:26.540 --> 47:38.060]  from deep in the heart of Texas, world wide.
[47:38.060 --> 47:57.620]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show, he never gives up, he's Alex Jones, world wide.
[47:57.620 --> 48:15.660]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show, he never gives up, he's Alex Jones, world wide.
[48:15.660 --> 48:40.780]  Well every night you drag me where the bright lights are found, there ain't no way to slow
[48:40.780 --> 48:47.660]  you down.
[48:47.660 --> 48:57.740]  This is all it takes to operate Google's new Nest Hub Max, just when we're starting
[48:57.740 --> 49:04.180]  to understand always listening gadgets, hey Google, now Google is branching into tech
[49:04.180 --> 49:08.700]  that's always watching too, I'm watching to post tech columnist Jeff Fowler and I've
[49:08.700 --> 49:17.180]  been testing one of these $230 Nest Hub Max devices, it's a bigger screen version of the
[49:17.180 --> 49:23.300]  Google Home Hub, which is both a smart speaker and a screen, which many people use as kitchen
[49:23.300 --> 49:28.020]  counter TVs, picture frames and smart home controllers.
[49:28.020 --> 49:32.860]  What's new is the addition of this camera and since this is Google, they're using that
[49:32.860 --> 49:35.700]  new eye in some bold ways.
[49:35.700 --> 49:41.460]  This is Google Assistant's leap into the controversial world of facial recognition.
[49:41.460 --> 49:49.420]  The camera turns the Hub Max into a baby howl 9000.
[49:49.420 --> 49:54.860]  It's a glimpse of what could come with facial recognition inside your house, if people aren't
[49:54.860 --> 49:58.140]  too turned off by the privacy implications.
[49:58.140 --> 50:01.380]  What do you get out of letting Google watch you through one of these?
[50:01.380 --> 50:03.380]  Let's try it out.
[50:03.380 --> 50:07.780]  Okay Google, video call James Pace corn silk.
[50:07.780 --> 50:14.660]  The camera can be used for basic video chats like on rival Amazon's Echo Show, but that's
[50:14.660 --> 50:16.620]  just the beginning of the story.
[50:16.620 --> 50:22.980]  If you opt in to Google's camera sensing features, the camera stays on, looking for familiar
[50:22.980 --> 50:23.980]  faces.
[50:23.980 --> 50:28.420]  When I woke up this morning, it spotted me, made a ding and started proactively showing
[50:28.420 --> 50:30.820]  me a rundown of my day.
[50:30.820 --> 50:39.100]  I didn't have to say a peep, when James walks by, he gets different information.
[50:39.100 --> 50:43.900]  Understanding that kind of context is really hard for computers and opens up possibilities
[50:43.900 --> 50:47.100]  for personalization in shared settings.
[50:47.100 --> 50:51.940]  While it's watching, the Hub Max keeps an eye out for hand-based gesture commands.
[50:51.940 --> 50:59.500]  For now, that's limited to play and pause.
[50:59.500 --> 51:00.980]  Talk to the hand robot.
[51:00.980 --> 51:06.740]  The Hub Max's camera can also serve as a Nest security camera, letting you peek in
[51:06.740 --> 51:10.380]  like a nanny cam on a stream of what's going on in your house.
[51:10.380 --> 51:15.260]  And like other Nest cameras, you can opt in to having the Hub Max send you alerts when
[51:15.260 --> 51:18.780]  it identifies familiar faces around the house.
[51:18.780 --> 51:22.380]  Alright, is that cool or just creepy?
[51:22.380 --> 51:25.660]  Okay Google, are you watching me?
[51:25.660 --> 51:29.980]  Your camera only sends video footage to Google if you have explicitly turned on the camera
[51:29.980 --> 51:32.340]  or enabled a feature that needs it.
[51:32.340 --> 51:34.780]  It's true, all of this is opt in.
[51:34.780 --> 51:37.940]  You can use a Hub Max without turning on any of these features.
[51:37.940 --> 51:42.580]  A green light turns on whenever the camera is live, broadcasting over the internet.
[51:42.580 --> 51:45.980]  And there's also a physical button you can press to cut the camera.
[51:45.980 --> 51:48.980]  But privacy is more complicated.
[51:48.980 --> 51:51.900]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[51:51.900 --> 51:59.460]  It's come out hundreds of times in court and lawsuits and in Congress that Google, Facebook,
[51:59.460 --> 52:05.620]  Twitter, Apple, none of them ever turn off location, none of them ever turn any of it
[52:05.620 --> 52:06.620]  off.
[52:06.620 --> 52:11.060]  They've been listening to you since these programs went live 20 years ago.
[52:11.060 --> 52:19.100]  Again, it's in the prospectus documents of their companies.
[52:19.100 --> 52:25.860]  You can go to infowars.com and newswars.com and type in Google documents show they're
[52:25.860 --> 52:29.580]  listening to 150 million Americans.
[52:29.580 --> 52:36.580]  Those are articles from 2004 and 2006 and you will see the articles and links to statements
[52:36.580 --> 52:41.940]  by Google to shareholders.
[52:41.940 --> 52:47.340]  But they've got a bunch of psychologists running this system and they know that if they normalize
[52:47.340 --> 52:56.820]  it and get you to adopt it and habitualize it and get in a habit of having it that you
[52:56.820 --> 52:59.620]  will then accept it.
[52:59.620 --> 53:04.260]  And so that's the plan.
[53:04.260 --> 53:07.700]  Why is all this coming out this week?
[53:07.700 --> 53:17.100]  Because infowars.com and zerohedge.com didn't just expose this decades ago.
[53:17.100 --> 53:23.580]  No ladies and gentlemen, it came out in February of this year specifically that Google is always
[53:23.580 --> 53:24.660]  listening.
[53:24.660 --> 53:28.540]  Nest security system has a second embedded microphone.
[53:28.540 --> 53:37.020]  So even the one that asks you to opt into it so that it will work doesn't tell you there's
[53:37.020 --> 53:39.740]  a second secret microphone.
[53:39.740 --> 53:46.420]  You're paying for this next system and that's only for one part of what this Trojan horse
[53:46.420 --> 53:48.340]  does.
[53:48.340 --> 53:55.340]  The main design of so-called smartphones that are more powerful than supercomputers 20 years
[53:55.340 --> 54:02.540]  ago is to know your heart rate, where you go, what you do, what the foods you eat, who
[54:02.540 --> 54:07.540]  you associate with, what your hopes, what your dreams are, whether you're sick, whether
[54:07.540 --> 54:13.140]  you're in good shape, whether you're planning on a vacation to build a total map of who
[54:13.140 --> 54:16.220]  you are and know what you're going to do before you do it.
[54:16.220 --> 54:20.100]  Remember Amazon three years ago it came out that for their prime members, they've got
[54:20.100 --> 54:25.020]  an algorithm with 99% accuracy that knows what you're going to buy before you buy it
[54:25.020 --> 54:31.820]  and already has it packaged generally days before you order it, ready, waiting for it
[54:31.820 --> 54:37.380]  to be shipped to you.
[54:37.380 --> 54:38.860]  So that's how it works.
[54:38.860 --> 54:45.740]  In a September 2006 article entitled Government Industry to Use Microphones on Computers,
[54:45.740 --> 54:50.300]  to Spile 150 Million Americans, myself and Alex Jones describe how private industry and
[54:50.300 --> 54:54.100]  eventually government is planning to use microphones and the computers of estimated
[54:54.100 --> 54:59.420]  150 million plus internet active Americans to spy on their lifestyle choices and build
[54:59.420 --> 55:04.220]  psychological profiles which will be used for surveillance and minority repike style
[55:04.220 --> 55:13.180]  invasive advertising and data mining and of course for pre-crime dealing with guns and
[55:13.180 --> 55:17.140]  your wife or your husband or all of it.
[55:17.140 --> 55:20.460]  And now there's a new phenomenon of people hacking your computer, turning the microphone
[55:20.460 --> 55:28.180]  on and then blackmailing you because they record you while you're masturbating in front
[55:28.180 --> 55:31.700]  of the computer or in bed with your wife watching porn or in bed with your boyfriend
[55:31.700 --> 55:40.100]  or whatever it is and the porn site sell the data to the hackers to then break into
[55:40.100 --> 55:45.900]  your computer, videotape you, they have your address, your name and then they contact you
[55:45.900 --> 55:50.380]  and say give me money or I'm going to release this on the dark web.
[55:50.380 --> 55:53.420]  Now most of the time they're just wanting the money and they don't even have the video
[55:53.420 --> 55:56.100]  but in some cases they do it just to follow through.
[55:56.100 --> 56:00.300]  You think it's just hackers turning off the hospitals, computer systems so people start
[56:00.300 --> 56:02.980]  dying and then demanding a million dollars?
[56:02.980 --> 56:03.980]  No.
[56:03.980 --> 56:07.900]  And guess who builds the main hacker tools, the CIA, the NSA, foreign governments, the
[56:07.900 --> 56:17.180]  Chinese and who gave the communist Chinese all the major code keys to Apple and to Google?
[56:17.180 --> 56:20.780]  Obama told those companies to do it and it's mainstream news.
[56:20.780 --> 56:24.580]  And now they've got access to everything you're doing and allow Democrats and deep
[56:24.580 --> 56:31.380]  status to plug into Chinese controlled interfaces that are in English and be given access by
[56:31.380 --> 56:37.820]  going through China into the entire US database where they can surveil people, track people,
[56:37.820 --> 56:42.700]  blackmail people, you name it and it looks like a Chinese hack.
[56:42.700 --> 56:52.660]  All that came out in the data dumps in the last two years on the Vault 7 and Vault 8
[56:52.660 --> 56:53.660]  and others.
[56:53.660 --> 57:00.780]  This is everything I'm saying is already mainstream news and declassified except the fact to put
[57:00.780 --> 57:10.700]  a cherry on top, the United States under Obama built black sites in China in coordination
[57:10.700 --> 57:19.460]  with the Chinese communists where people were taken who were kidnapped under rendition.
[57:19.460 --> 57:26.380]  Black bags put over their heads, thrown in vans, drug flown to China to underground
[57:26.380 --> 57:32.340]  facilities and never returning, think Trump might want to use that on Obama?
[57:32.340 --> 57:37.900]  When we come back, I'll tell you about what Epstein and others including Bill Gates are
[57:37.900 --> 57:38.900]  doing in China.
[57:38.900 --> 57:48.300]  You want to know, I'll give you information never released before as we accelerate.
[57:48.300 --> 57:52.820]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural that it starts
[57:52.820 --> 57:59.060]  to crack and take damage, wind, heat, water and age are tell-tale signs that it's time

[58:53.660 --> 59:00.340]  Band.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life,
[59:00.340 --> 59:07.180]  pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook and
[59:07.180 --> 59:09.180]  Twitter are still available.
[59:09.180 --> 59:10.820]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen.
[59:10.820 --> 59:12.460]  It's now live.
[59:12.460 --> 59:14.340]  Band.video.
[59:14.340 --> 59:19.660]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer,
[59:19.660 --> 59:21.460]  Paul Watson, band videos.
[59:21.460 --> 59:26.460]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted and where a growing
[59:26.460 --> 59:32.460]  list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down,
[59:32.460 --> 59:37.500]  free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood
[59:37.500 --> 59:39.500]  scum and the globalists.
[59:39.500 --> 59:41.540]  Freedom of speech has a home.
[59:41.540 --> 59:43.820]  It's called Band.video.
[59:43.820 --> 59:52.180]  America and the World is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[59:52.180 --> 1:00:01.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:03.820]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:00:03.820 --> 1:00:31.820]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:00:31.820 --> 1:00:58.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live, global Monday transmission.
[1:00:58.540 --> 1:01:00.740]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:01.740]  I want to do this.
[1:01:01.740 --> 1:01:07.780]  I want to get into all the other news that's unfolding in the world when we come back from
[1:01:07.780 --> 1:01:08.780]  break.
[1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:11.900]  And then I'll get more into Jeffrey Epstein and how this rabbit hole has turned into a
[1:01:11.900 --> 1:01:18.020]  giant black hole that is literally sucking the deep state down with it and how positive
[1:01:18.020 --> 1:01:21.460]  that is and why they hate Trump so much.
[1:01:21.460 --> 1:01:26.180]  That said, I'm getting very frustrated by Trump not taking action on big tech censorship
[1:01:26.180 --> 1:01:30.380]  and I'm getting very frustrated by him almost a week later, not saying, no, we're not going
[1:01:30.380 --> 1:01:35.660]  to have digital red flag laws run by big tech with listening devices in your house where
[1:01:35.660 --> 1:01:40.020]  they find these little microbe psychology signs.
[1:01:40.020 --> 1:01:43.380]  You don't say I'm going to kill my neighbors tomorrow with this gun and get your guns taken
[1:01:43.380 --> 1:01:44.380]  away.
[1:01:44.380 --> 1:01:45.380]  You should.
[1:01:45.380 --> 1:01:46.380]  You don't say anything.
[1:01:46.380 --> 1:01:53.020]  It's just your voice is high or angry or you're yelling and arguing a lot and then it decides
[1:01:53.020 --> 1:01:57.060]  with some algorithm created by some secret group in Silicon Valley that your guns are
[1:01:57.060 --> 1:01:58.540]  taken.
[1:01:58.540 --> 1:02:02.420]  That got rolled out that supposedly the White House is looking at that last week and then
[1:02:02.420 --> 1:02:07.580]  no response from the White House when there was a firestorm to it.
[1:02:07.580 --> 1:02:10.220]  That's incredibly dangerous as well.
[1:02:10.220 --> 1:02:15.980]  Trump then is raising considering social credit score system to determine who can buy a gun.
[1:02:15.980 --> 1:02:19.260]  And that story went super viral everywhere.
[1:02:19.260 --> 1:02:32.100]  Meanwhile, Google is always listening how it's watching too with the Nest Hub Max.
[1:02:32.100 --> 1:02:39.660]  And they're just flaunting all of this in our faces and going, gee, it's a little creepy.
[1:02:39.660 --> 1:02:44.500]  All the same text writers that knew about this a decade ago, 20 years ago, who sat there.
[1:02:44.500 --> 1:02:48.780]  I mean, I've had meetings with lots of Silicon Valley people, big engineers, whistleblowers.
[1:02:48.780 --> 1:02:50.660]  You see a lot of them on the show.
[1:02:50.660 --> 1:02:54.780]  And they're like, oh, yeah, I can't tell you because of the non-disclosures, but absolutely.
[1:02:54.780 --> 1:02:56.900]  It's just operating procedure.
[1:02:56.900 --> 1:03:03.780]  It's not like 50 dudes at Google know or 30 people at Apple or 100 people at one of these
[1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:06.100]  other outfits.
[1:03:06.100 --> 1:03:12.500]  It's system wide and they can go in thousands of people at these companies and go into your
[1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:13.500]  whole history.
[1:03:13.500 --> 1:03:21.620]  It came out that Twitter, just mainline employees there, just moderators, thousands of them,
[1:03:21.620 --> 1:03:28.060]  can just go into your private messages and read them, delete them, and they just brag
[1:03:28.060 --> 1:03:29.060]  about it.
[1:03:29.060 --> 1:03:30.060]  It's all funny.
[1:03:30.060 --> 1:03:33.780]  They're in your email, Google and Apple and all of them admit, we reserve the right to
[1:03:33.780 --> 1:03:34.780]  read your email.
[1:03:34.780 --> 1:03:38.220]  Remember 20 years ago, I told you they were reading your emails on Hotmail and Google
[1:03:38.220 --> 1:03:39.220]  Mail?
[1:03:39.220 --> 1:03:40.220]  Oh, no, they're not.
[1:03:40.220 --> 1:03:41.660]  Now they're like, yeah, you better believe.
[1:03:41.660 --> 1:03:45.540]  They're reading every word you say.
[1:03:45.540 --> 1:03:50.540]  You go and you store everything like your private diary with the biggest corporations
[1:03:50.540 --> 1:03:56.340]  in the world who now are helping authoritarian regimes round up their own people and put
[1:03:56.340 --> 1:03:59.100]  them in death camps.
[1:03:59.100 --> 1:04:03.500]  But it's okay because they're so woke and they let the homeless shoot up and poop on
[1:04:03.500 --> 1:04:04.500]  the street.
[1:04:04.500 --> 1:04:07.700]  Oh, look, I'm woke.
[1:04:07.700 --> 1:04:15.180]  I support people taking need during the anthem, oh, great, I'm woke.
[1:04:15.180 --> 1:04:17.900]  It's all coming up.
[1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:22.180]  But I want to get into the election news.
[1:04:22.180 --> 1:04:24.220]  I want to get into the economy news.
[1:04:24.220 --> 1:04:31.460]  I want to get into the DOJ is going to have to indict McCabe.
[1:04:31.460 --> 1:04:35.820]  That's what members of Congress that know what's going on are saying is getting ready
[1:04:35.820 --> 1:04:36.820]  to happen.
[1:04:36.820 --> 1:04:40.020]  There's been grand juries out on him for almost a year.
[1:04:40.020 --> 1:04:43.780]  There's so much more coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[1:04:43.780 --> 1:04:44.780]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:04:44.780 --> 1:04:48.220]  Remember, this is not a spectator sport.
[1:04:48.220 --> 1:04:52.940]  This is a situation where everybody's on the field in the arena, whether you like it or
[1:04:52.940 --> 1:04:53.940]  not.
[1:04:53.940 --> 1:04:54.940]  So please spread the word about the broadcast.
[1:04:54.940 --> 1:04:55.940]  Big decades.
[1:04:55.940 --> 1:05:10.180]  This is Savannah Hernandez for infowars.com.
[1:05:10.180 --> 1:05:15.380]  Our recent trip to Hong Kong was a new achievement for infowars.com.
[1:05:15.380 --> 1:05:20.100]  Despite being the most banned broadcast in the free world, we continue to win because
[1:05:20.100 --> 1:05:23.100]  of our great, strong, loyal audience.
[1:05:23.100 --> 1:05:29.340]  We have Dan Lyman covering infowars Europe, Paul Joseph Watson in the UK, Millie Weaver
[1:05:29.340 --> 1:05:34.900]  and Kaitlyn Bennett in the American Heartland, and from Austin, Texas, a team of reporters
[1:05:34.900 --> 1:05:39.140]  and crew ready to be dispatched wherever the story is going down.
[1:05:39.140 --> 1:05:43.340]  We are not done winning, and with your support, we will keep winning.
[1:05:43.340 --> 1:05:44.780]  We have to keep winning.
[1:05:44.780 --> 1:05:45.780]  We have to win more.
[1:05:45.780 --> 1:05:46.780]  Go to infowarsstore.com.
[1:05:46.780 --> 1:05:54.260]  You have gone to infowarsstore.com and gotten books and films, supplements, t-shirts and
[1:05:54.260 --> 1:06:06.180]  water filtration, air filtration and things you need.
[1:06:06.180 --> 1:06:10.380]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:10.380 --> 1:06:18.540]  You see, I was supposed to be off the air a couple years ago, and Hillary Clinton was
[1:06:18.540 --> 1:06:22.700]  supposed to be president right now, and they were supposed to be telling you that all your
[1:06:22.700 --> 1:06:26.340]  home devices are listening to you and your cell phones listening and watching you, and
[1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:30.660]  by the way, if you don't have one, you're not trusted, and your social credit score
[1:06:30.660 --> 1:06:36.540]  goes down and you won't be able to get on the train or we'll see a baseball game.
[1:06:36.540 --> 1:06:40.780]  That's all the admitted plan, and the people running it are these crazy billionaires who
[1:06:40.780 --> 1:06:44.860]  are transhumanists who believe they're about to merge with machines and become gods, and
[1:06:44.860 --> 1:06:48.860]  they're openly all over the news from the New York Times to NBC, saying the post-human
[1:06:48.860 --> 1:06:49.860]  era is here.
[1:06:49.860 --> 1:06:52.300]  Thank God, because humans suck!
[1:06:52.300 --> 1:06:58.540]  Oh, and then in between, trying to create animal and human clones for organ harvesting,
[1:06:58.540 --> 1:07:04.460]  which they've done, they're running child sex rings to compromise the scientific and
[1:07:04.460 --> 1:07:09.980]  technological elite to blackmail them towards that aim, and it turns out Jeffrey Epstein
[1:07:09.980 --> 1:07:12.300]  worked for Bill and Melinda Gates.
[1:07:12.300 --> 1:07:19.340]  He was their director of operations in their secret society at the Albert Einstein University
[1:07:19.340 --> 1:07:24.060]  and Institute in New York City.
[1:07:24.060 --> 1:07:28.300]  People keep asking, how did you know Epstein worked for Bill and Melinda Gates?
[1:07:28.300 --> 1:07:33.700]  Because it came out in the Wall Street Journal 11 years ago, how wonderful they are, and
[1:07:33.700 --> 1:07:37.100]  ABC News had them as superheroes with their heads on the Super Friends.
[1:07:37.100 --> 1:07:38.580]  We ought to find that clip.
[1:07:38.580 --> 1:07:42.220]  Dun dun dun dun, the Super Friends.
[1:07:42.220 --> 1:07:45.460]  Remember Ted Knight doing the voice forum back in the 70s and 80s?
[1:07:45.460 --> 1:07:53.340]  Dun dun dun dun, the Super Friends, battling the Legion of Doom, and Aquaman summons three
[1:07:53.340 --> 1:07:55.460]  giant whales.
[1:07:55.460 --> 1:07:59.300]  ABC News was praising Epstein.
[1:07:59.300 --> 1:08:01.540]  It had his name in it.
[1:08:01.540 --> 1:08:03.660]  How did you know Google was listening?
[1:08:03.660 --> 1:08:09.020]  But it said right there, to their shareholders, how did you know Epstein was involved in a
[1:08:09.020 --> 1:08:10.780]  giant cloning operation?
[1:08:10.780 --> 1:08:13.660]  It said so.
[1:08:13.660 --> 1:08:20.420]  All these old billionaires controlling trillions in assets want to live forever.
[1:08:20.420 --> 1:08:24.300]  They're mad scientists.
[1:08:24.300 --> 1:08:30.460]  And here we are, ladies and gentlemen, all these years later living under this garbage,
[1:08:30.460 --> 1:08:39.300]  and then it comes out that the MIT had, that the Media Lab was his minion and that he was
[1:08:39.300 --> 1:08:45.940]  working for Bill Gates, and now Bill Gates is trying to play dumb.
[1:08:45.940 --> 1:08:51.780]  Bill Gates is on record in a giant PR rollout specifically done to counter us.
[1:08:51.780 --> 1:08:54.100]  It was admitted.
[1:08:54.100 --> 1:08:58.420]  I was death-threaded, told you better shut up about Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[1:08:58.420 --> 1:08:59.420]  You know what, Bill?
[1:08:59.420 --> 1:09:04.460]  Go to hell, because it's where you're going, buddy, you're in a game of chicken and you're
[1:09:04.460 --> 1:09:05.460]  going to lose.
[1:09:05.460 --> 1:09:09.300]  I don't give a damn what happens, as long as you go down.
[1:09:09.300 --> 1:09:14.740]  Yeah, if you guys want to find it, go ask Rob Do.
[1:09:14.740 --> 1:09:15.740]  It's 11 years old.
[1:09:15.740 --> 1:09:16.740]  We've got it.
[1:09:16.740 --> 1:09:23.340]  It's a Super Friends intro with Bill and Melinda Gates and Ted Turner and Warren Buffett and
[1:09:23.340 --> 1:09:25.340]  Oprah Winfrey's heads on the superheroes.
[1:09:25.340 --> 1:09:27.860]  He's the one I want.
[1:09:27.860 --> 1:09:31.620]  No big deal, I was asking for it a few months ago, a few weeks ago, but someday we'll get
[1:09:31.620 --> 1:09:32.620]  it.
[1:09:32.620 --> 1:09:33.620]  No big deal.
[1:09:33.620 --> 1:09:40.460]  We probably did 15 reports on it, but continuing, ladies and gentlemen, this is what their goal
[1:09:40.460 --> 1:09:41.460]  is.
[1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:45.700]  This is what they're pushing, and it's a future and you're not in it.
[1:09:45.700 --> 1:09:52.460]  Now let me get into the other news that I'm going to hit after the break.
[1:09:52.460 --> 1:10:01.220]  Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren's secret talks ignite outrage mockery on social media.
[1:10:01.220 --> 1:10:08.100]  That's right, because they're getting ready to put Hillary Clinton on the ticket again.
[1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:11.820]  Just like you see all these other Democrats announcing now and racing right at the top
[1:10:11.820 --> 1:10:15.540]  of the charts, Hillary still intends to run.
[1:10:15.540 --> 1:10:20.780]  I told you that first, and I told you that Joe Biden's a placeholder, has had another
[1:10:20.780 --> 1:10:25.220]  stroke and can't talk, and now they're saying he must have had another stroke this weekend,
[1:10:25.220 --> 1:10:28.580]  and it's time for him to step down, and then he can't make it because he's footing his
[1:10:28.580 --> 1:10:30.580]  mouth Biden.
[1:10:30.580 --> 1:10:32.900]  His eyes are bleeding on TV.
[1:10:32.900 --> 1:10:33.900]  He's a placeholder.
[1:10:33.900 --> 1:10:38.420]  Hillary, I've talked to people that have been in her security detail where she is on the
[1:10:38.420 --> 1:10:44.620]  phone of the Democrats running the party, running the foundation, waiting, waiting like
[1:10:44.620 --> 1:10:52.220]  the big fat, bloated, dandruff-covered spider that she is to come sliding down on that fetid
[1:10:52.220 --> 1:10:59.980]  web, looking more like Emperor Palpatine every day.
[1:10:59.980 --> 1:11:04.740]  She looks like in that remake of Dracula that Keanu Reeves is in, what Dracula looks like
[1:11:04.740 --> 1:11:07.900]  before he starts getting younger.
[1:11:07.900 --> 1:11:13.860]  I mean, and again, it's not just that she's old, she radiates jack-o-lantern satanic energy.
[1:11:13.860 --> 1:11:14.860]  Right?
[1:11:14.860 --> 1:11:22.540]  When Jack Nicholson's busting through in the shining, and he says, here's Johnny, here's
[1:11:22.540 --> 1:11:23.540]  Johnny.
[1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:30.220]  I mean, she looks like that without trying because she's evil.
[1:11:30.220 --> 1:11:32.780]  That evil light shines through.
[1:11:32.780 --> 1:11:36.900]  What a monster, and the left worships her.
[1:11:36.900 --> 1:11:39.740]  They worship her.
[1:11:39.740 --> 1:11:43.940]  And then, of course, we've got Norm Patis, constitutional lawyer, famous criminal lawyer,
[1:11:43.940 --> 1:11:47.700]  all over the news constantly, all the top cases he covers.
[1:11:47.700 --> 1:11:51.660]  He is going to be in studio with us coming up the end of the hour into the third hour
[1:11:51.660 --> 1:11:54.940]  today to cover the waterfront.
[1:11:54.940 --> 1:12:00.940]  And this piece of news we're going to hit first, dim representative Clyburn, minority
[1:12:00.940 --> 1:12:08.060]  whip, and the House of Representatives, that second command, says the Bill of Rights wouldn't
[1:12:08.060 --> 1:12:10.260]  pass in today's climate.
[1:12:10.260 --> 1:12:14.740]  He admits the Democrats are coming out with the guns and free speech, and hell, the Republicans
[1:12:14.740 --> 1:12:17.180]  aren't really doing anything to defend it either.
[1:12:17.180 --> 1:12:18.420]  What an amazing admission.
[1:12:18.420 --> 1:12:24.820]  That's a Paul Joseph Watson article that needs to fill leftist, you know, inboxes.
[1:12:24.820 --> 1:12:30.420]  And it ties in with this little gem, Rahm Emanuel, Medicare for all, health care for
[1:12:30.420 --> 1:12:38.020]  migrants, untenable for dims, would bankrupt the company, the country, and is impossible.
[1:12:38.020 --> 1:12:39.020]  And we'll make them lose.
[1:12:39.020 --> 1:12:41.620]  So why are they pushing it?
[1:12:41.620 --> 1:12:43.780]  Because they want to bankrupt the nation.
[1:12:43.780 --> 1:12:46.380]  The globalists are on the globalist payroll.
[1:12:46.380 --> 1:12:48.980]  The deindustrialized plan has been there.
[1:12:48.980 --> 1:12:50.220]  This was meant to happen.
[1:12:50.220 --> 1:12:53.380]  And Trump is trying to reverse it.
[1:12:53.380 --> 1:12:54.380]  I like Trump.
[1:12:54.380 --> 1:12:55.380]  Overall, he's a good guy.
[1:12:55.380 --> 1:12:57.140]  I've been persecuted for supporting him.
[1:12:57.140 --> 1:13:04.220]  That makes me kind of pigheadedly want to still defend him all the time.
[1:13:04.220 --> 1:13:11.620]  It's kind of like I live in a neighborhood and I've already moved, starting to move.
[1:13:11.620 --> 1:13:14.060]  And the neighborhood association knows I'm Alex Jones.
[1:13:14.060 --> 1:13:17.820]  Most people are listeners in the area, but these few people harass me all the time.
[1:13:17.820 --> 1:13:20.540]  So I'm thinking about just renting the house out and actually staying there.
[1:13:20.540 --> 1:13:21.540]  But you know what?
[1:13:21.540 --> 1:13:22.540]  I don't be pigheaded.
[1:13:22.540 --> 1:13:26.460]  But it's the same kind of thing.
[1:13:26.460 --> 1:13:31.900]  And if Trump doesn't defend the First Amendment and doesn't stop all these cartels oppressing
[1:13:31.900 --> 1:13:36.180]  the people, when all the testimony in Congress shows they're lying to Congress, they are
[1:13:36.180 --> 1:13:41.700]  misleading people in elections, they're bragging they're planning to steal the elections,
[1:13:41.700 --> 1:13:44.100]  and Trump won't do anything, well, then what are we going to do?
[1:13:44.100 --> 1:13:51.740]  I'm going to cover that as well because in Russia, they've banned Google from doing push
[1:13:51.740 --> 1:13:55.620]  notifications the three days before the election.
[1:13:55.620 --> 1:13:59.180]  Because they know Google is only doing push notifications to leftists and globalists.
[1:13:59.180 --> 1:14:00.180]  That's admitted.
[1:14:00.180 --> 1:14:05.180]  But what did Professor Epstein, Robert Epstein, not Jeffrey Epstein, tell Congress, and what
[1:14:05.180 --> 1:14:06.540]  is he even giving testimony to?
[1:14:06.540 --> 1:14:07.540]  He shows the facts.
[1:14:07.540 --> 1:14:11.900]  Of course, Google and Facebook can only do push notifications to Democrats, and that'll
[1:14:11.900 --> 1:14:18.140]  be 20, 30, 40 million more votes guaranteed.
[1:14:18.140 --> 1:14:26.580]  So Google is told in Russia, don't do that, but here, Trump won't do a damn thing.
[1:14:26.580 --> 1:14:29.620]  And boy, they try to keep him all cloistered, they try to keep him all walled off.
[1:14:29.620 --> 1:14:30.620]  We're going to go to break.
[1:14:30.620 --> 1:14:36.780]  Again, I'm just going to say this quickly, DNA Force Plus is PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch
[1:14:36.780 --> 1:14:42.740]  of other factors that are patented and admitted and are certified, so you can say makes telomeres
[1:14:42.740 --> 1:14:43.740]  last longer.
[1:14:43.740 --> 1:14:46.100]  That's the same thing that's making them grow if they shrink slower.
[1:14:46.100 --> 1:14:50.860]  When the telomeres can't divide anymore, when the telomeres shrink, that's how many times
[1:14:50.860 --> 1:14:52.980]  your cells can divide, you know what happens.
[1:14:52.980 --> 1:14:53.980]  That's aging.
[1:14:53.980 --> 1:14:57.940]  So as close to the fountain users are going to find, PQQ, CoQ10, all these other cofactors
[1:14:57.940 --> 1:15:00.700]  are very expensive to get patented.
[1:15:00.700 --> 1:15:01.700]  Everybody else marks it up.
[1:15:01.700 --> 1:15:02.700]  Again, seven times.
[1:15:02.700 --> 1:15:03.700]  We only mark it up.
[1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:05.700]  100% then discount it right now.

[1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:18.220]  We're meant to be more omnivores, not so much carnivores, but I love meat, too.
[1:15:18.220 --> 1:15:19.220]  It's really great.
[1:15:19.220 --> 1:15:21.620]  Get a free bottle of that, but it's the last day to get the free bottle of that.
[1:15:21.620 --> 1:15:25.020]  It'll still be 50% off for this week, but we're close to selling out.
[1:15:25.020 --> 1:15:26.020]  More does it come.

[1:15:46.260 --> 1:15:47.260]  and viruses.

[1:17:51.700 --> 1:17:52.700]  before purchasing.
[1:17:52.700 --> 1:17:55.700]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[1:17:55.700 --> 1:17:59.340]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[1:17:59.340 --> 1:18:00.340]  I've been so busy.
[1:18:00.340 --> 1:18:04.020]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news, but it's very exciting.
[1:18:04.020 --> 1:18:06.340]  It's super silver skin cream.
[1:18:06.340 --> 1:18:10.220]  It's got all of these benefits, too many to mention, but it's revolutionary.

[1:18:58.420 --> 1:19:03.540]  It's been a year since info wars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[1:19:03.540 --> 1:19:07.660]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned and we're credited with getting Donald Trump
[1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:11.460]  elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[1:19:11.460 --> 1:19:16.060]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place
[1:19:16.060 --> 1:19:20.820]  where the censors are unable to block the signal and it's now here.

[1:19:55.620 --> 1:20:09.060]  Band.video You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:09.060 --> 1:20:25.500]  They have told us that the post-human era is here, that cyborgs will exterminate us
[1:20:25.500 --> 1:20:31.300]  soon on every major news program and running it is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[1:20:31.300 --> 1:20:35.460]  taking over for the Rockefellers with their exterminist program and you can read these
[1:20:35.460 --> 1:20:41.020]  articles about the Annenberg and the Knight Foundation and all the same groups that rule
[1:20:41.020 --> 1:20:46.540]  our country, the Eugenicists, their grandfathers funded Hitler and now they're leading the
[1:20:46.540 --> 1:20:51.860]  neoliberal system listening to us and watching us in our homes and Jeffrey Epstein headed
[1:20:51.860 --> 1:20:56.700]  up their group and they compromised many top scientists blackmailing them with underage
[1:20:56.700 --> 1:21:01.820]  girls to have a scientific dictatorship, a technocracy, then it's all coming out.
[1:21:01.820 --> 1:21:06.460]  They're totally vindicated, it's in court hearings confirmed that the abortion clinics
[1:21:06.460 --> 1:21:12.020]  are keeping babies alive and selling their organs, they cut their hearts out and deliver
[1:21:12.020 --> 1:21:15.220]  it on the spot, live babies.
[1:21:15.220 --> 1:21:22.340]  Live babies delivered to U.S. higher learning institutions, think of the power trip at Stanford
[1:21:22.340 --> 1:21:27.540]  Research when they bring the baby in and they cut its heart out right there on the spot.
[1:21:27.540 --> 1:21:34.060]  Well, we judge as the bioethicist that this creature didn't have a future and wasn't human.
[1:21:34.060 --> 1:21:39.300]  The bioethics board says this down syndrome young man needs to die, this old person needs
[1:21:39.300 --> 1:21:43.860]  to be killed because we judge the quality of life in the bioethics and we've gotten rid
[1:21:43.860 --> 1:21:46.900]  of the Hippocratic oath of Hippocrates.
[1:21:46.900 --> 1:21:52.220]  Actually found these super friends ABC Newspiece from 10, 11 years ago where they were worshiping
[1:21:52.220 --> 1:21:55.980]  the super friends and how they're having a secret meeting for a world government to
[1:21:55.980 --> 1:22:02.860]  depopulate us, yay, thank you super friends, here it is.
[1:22:02.860 --> 1:22:07.820]  The price of admission is a billion dollars and a philanthropic heart and that meets the
[1:22:07.820 --> 1:22:12.700]  pricey requirements recently held in a secret meeting and private meeting in New York City,
[1:22:12.700 --> 1:22:19.820]  ABC's John Berman has the scoop on who was there and what was going on.
[1:22:19.820 --> 1:22:23.900]  Behind closed doors on this New York campus, a secret gathering of some of the world's
[1:22:23.900 --> 1:22:28.420]  most powerful people, Gates, Buffett, Bloomberg, Winfrey.
[1:22:28.420 --> 1:22:38.620]  It was like, well, it was like the super friends.
[1:22:38.620 --> 1:22:43.220]  Together with others at the meeting, including George Soros, Ted Turner, David Rockefeller,
[1:22:43.220 --> 1:22:46.940]  they're worth more than a hundred and twenty five billion dollars.
[1:22:46.940 --> 1:22:50.340]  To have been in the room and and see this meeting of the minds really would have been
[1:22:50.340 --> 1:22:52.340]  a fascinating thing.
[1:22:52.340 --> 1:22:57.460]  That much money, that much power around one table, it begs the question.
[1:22:57.460 --> 1:22:58.620]  What were they doing?
[1:22:58.620 --> 1:23:00.380]  What were they scheming?
[1:23:00.380 --> 1:23:02.020]  Total world domination?
[1:23:02.020 --> 1:23:08.260]  This group, together for six hours, was talking about charity, education, emergency relief,
[1:23:08.260 --> 1:23:09.420]  global health.
[1:23:09.420 --> 1:23:13.260]  All my friends are philanthropic, well they probably wouldn't be my friends.
[1:23:13.260 --> 1:23:18.780]  An official at the Gates Foundation told ABCNews.com, the overwhelming reason for the meeting was
[1:23:18.780 --> 1:23:19.780]  need.
[1:23:19.780 --> 1:23:23.220]  It was the issue that galvanized everyone to participate.
[1:23:23.220 --> 1:23:29.100]  Together they've given away seventy billion dollars since 1996 and with the sagging economy,
[1:23:29.100 --> 1:23:33.420]  their help could be just what struggling charities need.
[1:23:33.420 --> 1:23:36.340]  Charities are hurting and somebody has to speak for all these charities and if they
[1:23:36.340 --> 1:23:40.380]  want philanthropy to be robust in the future in the United States, these are the people
[1:23:40.380 --> 1:23:42.260]  where you really want to be talking about it.
[1:23:42.260 --> 1:23:48.820]  The new superman and wonder woman, the super rich friends, not fighting bad guys but fighting
[1:23:48.820 --> 1:23:51.100]  for good, nonetheless.
[1:23:51.100 --> 1:23:54.820]  For Good Morning America, John Berman, ABC News, New York.
[1:23:54.820 --> 1:23:59.260]  Yes, apparently one of the things they discussed was what each of them knows about what really
[1:23:59.260 --> 1:24:03.460]  works and what doesn't work so they can concentrate their resources.
[1:24:03.460 --> 1:24:04.700]  Oh, thank goodness.
[1:24:04.700 --> 1:24:09.340]  But actually, the Wall Street Journal said they're having a secret meeting because they're
[1:24:09.340 --> 1:24:13.620]  setting up a world government and planning for depopulation.
[1:24:13.620 --> 1:24:18.260]  And then we know what they actually carry out, airborne mosquitoes carrying viruses
[1:24:18.260 --> 1:24:22.820]  to kill you, pathogens, additive vaccines to sterilize you.
[1:24:22.820 --> 1:24:28.540]  We know specifically what they do, what their in game is and what their plan is and now
[1:24:28.540 --> 1:24:34.140]  it's come out that Jeffrey Epstein was heading the group up, organizing it for them and then
[1:24:34.140 --> 1:24:39.380]  recruiting top scientists and compromising them with sex operatives.
[1:24:39.380 --> 1:24:43.260]  You don't just think spy agencies try to set people up for, you know, intelligence about
[1:24:43.260 --> 1:24:44.260]  what they're going to do politically.
[1:24:44.260 --> 1:24:50.340]  You know, it's all about missiles and viruses and secrets and codes and processors and quantum
[1:24:50.340 --> 1:24:53.660]  mechanics.
[1:24:53.660 --> 1:24:56.540]  Now it's all over the news, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:24:56.540 --> 1:24:57.540]  That's who these people are.
[1:24:57.540 --> 1:25:03.860]  Meanwhile, Hillary Rodham Clinton has been a globalist gopher in power for 40 years,
[1:25:03.860 --> 1:25:05.100]  one way or another.
[1:25:05.100 --> 1:25:09.180]  And now her and Elizabeth Warren have been meeting in secret again.
[1:25:09.180 --> 1:25:10.180]  Meeting in secret.
[1:25:10.180 --> 1:25:17.420]  When you go back to Warren Buffett and Bill Gates and all of them, you know, they were
[1:25:17.420 --> 1:25:22.780]  supposedly all worth only about 50, 60 billion back then, a piece, but now they're all worth
[1:25:22.780 --> 1:25:24.100]  over 100 billion a piece.
[1:25:24.100 --> 1:25:28.260]  You see, they put their money into tax-free foundations and they get all the profits out
[1:25:28.260 --> 1:25:30.180]  of it.
[1:25:30.180 --> 1:25:33.820]  When you're in their club, you don't pay taxes.
[1:25:33.820 --> 1:25:37.700]  Warren Buffett was the biggest recipient of the Banker bailout 2008.
[1:25:37.700 --> 1:25:40.460]  Just type it in, it's a McClatchy, even Bloomberg reported it.
[1:25:40.460 --> 1:25:45.700]  Warren Buffett, biggest recipient of 2008 bailout, 487 billion.
[1:25:45.700 --> 1:25:47.420]  Let's see if my memory serves.
[1:25:47.420 --> 1:25:50.940]  I said that ABC News report was from 11 years ago.
[1:25:50.940 --> 1:25:55.340]  You notice it was from one month shy of 11 years ago.
[1:25:55.340 --> 1:25:57.460]  Let's see if I'm right.
[1:25:57.460 --> 1:26:04.900]  Let's see if my brain is accurate because here we are, ladies and gentlemen, with this eugenics-ruling
[1:26:04.900 --> 1:26:11.860]  class of mad scientists, their grandfathers put syphilis in vaccines and gave it to black
[1:26:11.860 --> 1:26:12.860]  people.
[1:26:12.860 --> 1:26:19.300]  Their fathers gave my grandmother polio, live virus, and they told her, you got it from
[1:26:19.300 --> 1:26:21.260]  the shot one week after she took it.
[1:26:21.260 --> 1:26:24.140]  It ate most of the nerves in her body.
[1:26:24.140 --> 1:26:29.780]  She lived in 92 and was a tough lady, but she was in excruciating pain the rest of her
[1:26:29.780 --> 1:26:33.340]  life and even for a while in an iron lung in Dallas.
[1:26:33.340 --> 1:26:37.220]  Oh, and Dr. Sock knew, there's a video of his apprentice laughing.
[1:26:37.220 --> 1:26:40.540]  Well, we knew it was infected with, a lot of people got polio from it.
[1:26:40.540 --> 1:26:42.740]  A lot of people got SV40 cancer.
[1:26:42.740 --> 1:26:48.980]  About 100 million died from it, but he said, there are too many people anyways.
[1:26:48.980 --> 1:26:51.940]  It's like Sock.
[1:26:51.940 --> 1:26:54.300]  Step aside, Bayer, a member came out 15 years ago.
[1:26:54.300 --> 1:26:55.940]  I can play the newscast that if you like.
[1:26:55.940 --> 1:26:59.260]  Back then, even NBC News reported it.
[1:26:59.260 --> 1:27:03.700]  Bayer Pharmaceutical in Australia and France, it came out in court, the head executives
[1:27:03.700 --> 1:27:08.460]  knew they were putting HIV and hepatitis in all the factor A product was made from blood
[1:27:08.460 --> 1:27:12.100]  and they said, the minute, so what, we'll lose a couple hundred million if we recall
[1:27:12.100 --> 1:27:13.220]  this, but who cares?
[1:27:13.220 --> 1:27:15.860]  There are too many hemophiliacs.
[1:27:15.860 --> 1:27:19.540]  We're doing the world a favor, see survival of the fittest.
[1:27:19.540 --> 1:27:26.100]  They're using medicine to kill you and your family.
[1:27:26.100 --> 1:27:30.300]  And yes, and folks went to jail in France.
[1:27:30.300 --> 1:27:33.060]  Nobody went to jail even in Australia and nobody went to jail here.
[1:27:33.060 --> 1:27:34.460]  You know why?
[1:27:34.460 --> 1:27:36.500]  This Bayer has been given liability protection.
[1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:39.420]  You know, why don't you ever think there's any lawsuits with the vaccines because there's
[1:27:39.420 --> 1:27:41.900]  a secret fund set up in 84.
[1:27:41.900 --> 1:27:48.980]  Oh, why don't you think there's no lawsuits dealing with the cell phone radiation admittedly
[1:27:48.980 --> 1:27:53.780]  giving you cancer because the courts don't allow it because they're controlled and there's
[1:27:53.780 --> 1:28:00.020]  certain things the judges know, you don't touch this, you don't discuss this, you don't
[1:28:00.020 --> 1:28:01.020]  go there.
[1:28:01.020 --> 1:28:04.660]  Oh, and guess where you're like, how are they going to contaminate the blood at Bayer to
[1:28:04.660 --> 1:28:05.660]  begin with?
[1:28:05.660 --> 1:28:06.660]  Why would they do that?
[1:28:06.660 --> 1:28:12.940]  Oh, Hillary Clinton, one more notch on her belt and Bill, they were personally paid over
[1:28:12.940 --> 1:28:15.540]  $20 million by the company.
[1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:19.940]  They would take the blood out of state prisons in Arkansas, they would let people give blood
[1:28:19.940 --> 1:28:20.940]  even every week.
[1:28:20.940 --> 1:28:24.740]  The report looked like concentration camp guards, I had the medical doctor who exposed
[1:28:24.740 --> 1:28:25.740]  it all on the show.
[1:28:25.740 --> 1:28:30.660]  He got firebombed two days after he was on, firebombed, yeah, and they would ship the
[1:28:30.660 --> 1:28:36.780]  blood out of Arkansas knowing it all had HIV in Canada and then Bayer would make it lovingly.
[1:28:36.780 --> 1:28:42.820]  They wanted it, they wanted it, and then they'd ship it all over the world to kill all the
[1:28:42.820 --> 1:28:51.340]  hemophiliacs, kill them slowly, kill them slowly, liberally, huh, take the vaccine to
[1:28:51.340 --> 1:28:56.540]  eat the GMO, classicates good for you, Hillary loves you.

[1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:45.500]  I turn on the news.

[1:33:58.820 --> 1:34:04.300]  And oh, yeah, pedophiles run the government and yeah, we're devil worshipers and yeah,
[1:34:04.300 --> 1:34:07.100]  we're going to take your kids away from you and yeah, China is going to run the planet
[1:34:07.100 --> 1:34:13.060]  and we have human animal clones and I don't want to put up with this.
[1:34:13.060 --> 1:34:25.020]  I don't want to watch all this happen and then I see Hollywood absolutely gutting this
[1:34:25.020 --> 1:34:34.060]  nation psychically at least trying to you know, Paul Watson writes a lot of great articles
[1:34:34.060 --> 1:34:39.140]  and I sent him a trailer for this movie called Cuck about a white guy that's mad that he
[1:34:39.140 --> 1:34:40.140]  can't get a job.
[1:34:40.140 --> 1:34:44.060]  He goes out and starts killing minorities and that's Hollywood trying to spur mentally
[1:34:44.060 --> 1:34:46.140]  ill people to actually do that.
[1:34:46.140 --> 1:34:49.140]  And the truth is, you know, the white guy, it was an accurate movie.
[1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:51.500]  The black guys don't have jobs either.
[1:34:51.500 --> 1:34:54.700]  But then I told Paul and I love to death.
[1:34:54.700 --> 1:34:59.660]  I said, Hey, you know, Hollywood is actually ordering the financing.
[1:34:59.660 --> 1:35:03.340]  They're only buying films that are going to cause a race war.
[1:35:03.340 --> 1:35:07.820]  I said, you know, our fellow friend that works here, your friends with him, they actually
[1:35:07.820 --> 1:35:12.100]  like each other, this employee or this crew member, this consultant actually went over
[1:35:12.100 --> 1:35:16.940]  and just saw Paul and his girlfriend, my associate brought his girlfriend.
[1:35:16.940 --> 1:35:20.020]  They just hung out for a week, you know, over in London together.
[1:35:20.020 --> 1:35:23.060]  I'm like, if you don't believe me, you know, call him.
[1:35:23.060 --> 1:35:26.700]  I sent him to Sundance and he was there in the meetings.
[1:35:26.700 --> 1:35:30.860]  They just admitted in these big meetings, we're here to overthrow things and as much
[1:35:30.860 --> 1:35:33.340]  venom as we can and just poison America.
[1:35:33.340 --> 1:35:37.980]  Paul's like, all right, maybe I'll add it to the story.
[1:35:37.980 --> 1:35:49.220]  It's like, I just broke that there are black sites that Obama set up operating inside China
[1:35:49.220 --> 1:35:56.580]  run by U.S. contractors torturing not just Al Qaeda and ISIS people, but others.
[1:35:56.580 --> 1:36:01.020]  You understand how dangerous it is to report that you understand that's real.
[1:36:01.020 --> 1:36:08.060]  I mean, that's from people that were there.
[1:36:08.060 --> 1:36:10.380]  This is real.
[1:36:10.380 --> 1:36:16.420]  This is beyond WikiLeaks stuff and it's just, and I love Paul, but we're all too close to
[1:36:16.420 --> 1:36:17.420]  this.
[1:36:17.420 --> 1:36:24.020]  We're saying, yeah, big deal.
[1:36:24.020 --> 1:36:30.180]  And that's where they want to get us, you see, where, yeah, okay, there have been animal
[1:36:30.180 --> 1:36:35.300]  human clones for 40 years, just like Alex Jones said, big deal, well, let's see them.
[1:36:35.300 --> 1:36:36.300]  What are you doing with them?
[1:36:36.300 --> 1:36:39.060]  And don't worry about it.
[1:36:39.060 --> 1:36:41.860]  There's a total breakaway civilization.
[1:36:41.860 --> 1:36:43.340]  The future's here.
[1:36:43.340 --> 1:36:46.360]  It's not equally distributed.
[1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:52.700]  And they've got some psycho plan there running that I've reverse engineered because I only
[1:36:52.700 --> 1:36:57.020]  know what they admit is going on and it was already science fiction land 25 years ago
[1:36:57.020 --> 1:37:02.140]  when I started really discovering all this.
[1:37:02.140 --> 1:37:07.980]  I mean, it was in medical white papers and mainline grants that they had animal human
[1:37:07.980 --> 1:37:12.020]  clones 20 years before I got on air.
[1:37:12.020 --> 1:37:17.300]  That's 45 years ago.
[1:37:17.300 --> 1:37:19.820]  Can you imagine what's really going on?
[1:37:19.820 --> 1:37:24.620]  It was in white papers that they were listening to you over your scientific Atlantic cable
[1:37:24.620 --> 1:37:27.580]  boxes 23 years ago.
[1:37:27.580 --> 1:37:32.460]  I broke one open on air on my local access show.
[1:37:32.460 --> 1:37:41.660]  And then people obviously from the army physically attacked me in a parking lot two days later
[1:37:41.660 --> 1:37:46.660]  and told me I was dead next time I did it, but I beat the hell out of them too.
[1:37:46.660 --> 1:37:50.740]  I mean, you understand what we've gone through to bring you this information that they've
[1:37:50.740 --> 1:37:53.020]  ordered people to come physically attack me.
[1:37:53.020 --> 1:37:54.020]  So I shut up about it.
[1:37:54.020 --> 1:37:57.060]  I'm not shutting up about the black sightings in China.
[1:37:57.060 --> 1:38:00.500]  They better be shut down or all this crap.
[1:38:00.500 --> 1:38:03.420]  There's absolutely no bottom to this.
[1:38:03.420 --> 1:38:11.220]  This is pure evil.
[1:38:11.220 --> 1:38:12.220]  Because I don't fear any of you.
[1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:13.220]  I fear God.
[1:38:13.220 --> 1:38:14.220]  I want to be with God.
[1:38:14.220 --> 1:38:16.740]  I do not want to go with you.
[1:38:16.740 --> 1:38:20.340]  I do not want to spend eternity with my spirit rubbing up next to you.
[1:38:20.340 --> 1:38:26.820]  No way, no way, and I really feel sorry for people that are scared of evil and cozy up
[1:38:26.820 --> 1:38:29.660]  to it because they think they're getting along with the power structure and that they're
[1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:30.780]  getting some glee out of it.
[1:38:30.780 --> 1:38:32.140]  Your fools.
[1:38:32.140 --> 1:38:43.380]  There's no working with the devil ever.
[1:38:43.380 --> 1:38:47.620]  I'll just play these videos when we come back when Norm Pattis, First Amendment lawyer,
[1:38:47.620 --> 1:38:54.740]  constitutional lawyer, famous criminal lawyer, joins us in studio, Democrat rep, Claiborne,
[1:38:54.740 --> 1:38:59.900]  the Bill of Rights wouldn't pass in today's climate, which is true, and Rahm Emanuel basically
[1:38:59.900 --> 1:39:00.900]  says the same thing.
[1:39:00.900 --> 1:39:03.100]  What are they really doing there?
[1:39:03.100 --> 1:39:06.420]  Knowing that what they're doing super unpopular is they're playing good cop, bad cop, or is
[1:39:06.420 --> 1:39:07.420]  it more than that?
[1:39:07.420 --> 1:39:11.580]  Because even if you're somewhat evil, you got to know, getting rid of all these checks
[1:39:11.580 --> 1:39:14.580]  and balances is not going to end well.
[1:39:14.580 --> 1:39:20.140]  Why would we butcher America and sell it out when America could dominate the globe?
[1:39:20.140 --> 1:39:23.460]  Even if you're an evil person, America's in position for that, but see it's spiritual
[1:39:23.460 --> 1:39:30.700]  because America has been a Christian nation and a Renaissance nation has that ethos.
[1:39:30.700 --> 1:39:32.860]  It has those bona fides.
[1:39:32.860 --> 1:39:34.780]  It must be destroyed.
[1:39:34.780 --> 1:39:41.900]  It's the big spiritual prize, not power, not money, not freedom, not incredible technological
[1:39:41.900 --> 1:39:50.340]  developments, but the spirit in control of the planet wants to hurt good things.
[1:39:50.340 --> 1:39:53.420]  You know, why does this serial killer want to kidnap a three-year-old child and rape
[1:39:53.420 --> 1:39:55.260]  him and torture him and have him beg for mommy?
[1:39:55.260 --> 1:39:58.860]  That sounds like hell on earth to a normal person, but to somebody like that, that sounds
[1:39:58.860 --> 1:40:07.740]  like Beethoven's ninth using up little kids, sucking their souls out.
[1:40:07.740 --> 1:40:08.740]  That's what they do.
[1:40:08.740 --> 1:40:14.300]  And I'm going to be the top psychiatrist to the psychopaths, to the serial killers.
[1:40:14.300 --> 1:40:15.300]  They'll tell you.
[1:40:15.300 --> 1:40:16.300]  They have nightmares.
[1:40:16.300 --> 1:40:17.500]  They're tortured by demons.
[1:40:17.500 --> 1:40:20.780]  They're only alive when they're killing somebody innocent, and then it's like electricity
[1:40:20.780 --> 1:40:26.540]  and light, and they feel so good, and you have to understand, when you see a Jeffrey
[1:40:26.540 --> 1:40:31.460]  Epstein or Bill Gates or any of these people, you look at them, that's who they are, folks.
[1:40:31.460 --> 1:40:33.180]  They are gone.
[1:40:33.180 --> 1:40:34.180]  They're puppets.
[1:40:34.180 --> 1:40:40.100]  They've turned themselves over to an energy ancient and twisted and evil.
[1:40:40.100 --> 1:40:44.060]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[1:40:44.060 --> 1:40:49.420]  I'm going to come back and play those clips and get to a lot more next hour.
[1:40:49.420 --> 1:40:53.340]  But if you want to turn yourself over to these predators, be my guest, but get the hell out
[1:40:53.340 --> 1:40:57.260]  of my way, because the Bible tells you everything you need to know.
[1:40:57.260 --> 1:41:00.380]  Get behind me, Satan.
[1:41:00.380 --> 1:41:04.260]  Those are innovating, we're trailblazing, we're building.
[1:41:04.260 --> 1:41:08.260]  The devil just steals and destroys and twists and counterfeits, and we just need to get
[1:41:08.260 --> 1:41:12.500]  this satanic world government system behind us.
[1:41:12.500 --> 1:41:18.140]  Get the Clintons and then the Bushes and the Chai comms behind us, and we can do anything
[1:41:18.140 --> 1:41:21.020]  together and we will do it together.
[1:41:21.020 --> 1:41:22.540]  But you've got to know it's spiritual.
[1:41:22.540 --> 1:41:23.540]  You got to make the decision.
[1:41:23.540 --> 1:41:27.900]  The treasure's all there.
[1:41:27.900 --> 1:41:31.020]  And you won't want the treasure anymore once you get the real treasure.
[1:41:31.020 --> 1:41:32.380]  It's all tinfoil.
[1:41:32.380 --> 1:41:33.380]  It's all jokes.
[1:41:33.380 --> 1:41:34.380]  It's all crap.
[1:41:34.380 --> 1:41:37.340]  I mean, it's a weird feeling, because I used to kind of like people thinking I was tough
[1:41:37.340 --> 1:41:41.700]  or famous, or I had a little bit of ego, man, all I have is mission now.
[1:41:41.700 --> 1:41:42.700]  It means nothing.
[1:41:42.700 --> 1:41:46.740]  Hollywood, rock stars, power, money, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[1:41:46.740 --> 1:41:49.020]  But the mission means everything.
[1:41:49.020 --> 1:41:52.460]  No one in these scum can keep babies alive and sell their organs, and if they're going
[1:41:52.460 --> 1:41:54.860]  to get away with it, that keeps me up at night, man.
[1:41:54.860 --> 1:41:56.660]  They just think they're so smart.
[1:41:56.660 --> 1:41:58.380]  They think they're so committed as a good news.
[1:41:58.380 --> 1:41:59.380]  They're not so smart anymore.
[1:41:59.380 --> 1:42:00.380]  Are they?
[1:42:00.380 --> 1:42:01.380]  They're scared.
[1:42:01.380 --> 1:42:02.380]  That should be what I want them to be scared.
[1:42:02.380 --> 1:42:05.540]  See, because I don't want to hurt little children.
[1:42:05.540 --> 1:42:10.900]  I want to hurt you, and I'm going to hurt you politically.
[1:42:10.900 --> 1:42:15.180]  And I'm going to make sure at the end of the day, you don't get any more innocence to drag
[1:42:15.180 --> 1:42:20.260]  into hell with you, because we're going to knock the dust off our feet in the next phase
[1:42:20.260 --> 1:42:25.660]  of humanity, and you're going to be a memory and an example of what not to be.
[1:42:25.660 --> 1:42:30.220]  You're going to be the textbook of what evil slaves are and what we aren't.
[1:42:30.220 --> 1:42:35.460]  We're going to be right back with Norm Pattison's studio in a ton of clips, and the real transmission
[1:42:35.460 --> 1:42:37.100]  is about to begin.
[1:42:37.100 --> 1:42:42.580]  Fire up your human spirit.
[1:42:42.580 --> 1:42:43.580]  Fire up your will.
[1:42:43.580 --> 1:42:45.140]  Fire up your life force.
[1:42:45.140 --> 1:42:46.140]  Embrace life.
[1:42:46.140 --> 1:42:47.140]  Reject death.
[1:42:47.140 --> 1:42:50.660]  Feel the power God gave you.
[1:42:50.660 --> 1:42:56.260]  Feel your sails full of that air, of that spirit.
[1:42:56.260 --> 1:43:00.820]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural that it starts
[1:43:00.820 --> 1:43:02.860]  to crack and take damage.
[1:43:02.860 --> 1:43:08.300]  Wind, heat, water, and age are tell-tale signs that it's time to start taking care of your
[1:43:08.300 --> 1:43:09.300]  skin.
[1:43:09.300 --> 1:43:14.580]  With the Infra-War Super Silver Cream, you can keep your skin feeling silky smooth and

[1:43:38.060 --> 1:43:39.620]  softening calluses.

[1:47:53.940 --> 1:47:54.940]  lawyer.

[1:48:12.580 --> 1:48:13.780]  It's got the bee pollen.
[1:48:13.780 --> 1:48:15.780]  It's got the alfalfa.
[1:48:15.780 --> 1:48:19.660]  It's got all the things known for bones, ligaments, strength.
[1:48:19.660 --> 1:48:23.460]  It tastes pretty good, but if you mix it in with whey and then fruit and stuff, it tastes
[1:48:23.460 --> 1:48:24.460]  amazing.
[1:48:24.460 --> 1:48:25.460]  You mix it with milk.
[1:48:25.460 --> 1:48:30.500]  It's like ovaltine if it's mixed in with some fruit and sugar, but you have to order a lot
[1:48:30.500 --> 1:48:34.620]  of this when you do it and we are close to selling out of it.
[1:48:34.620 --> 1:48:39.020]  We're not going to probably have more because it's about a four to five month lead time
[1:48:39.020 --> 1:48:42.260]  until I'm going to reorder it as soon as we sell out that'll have the money to be able
[1:48:42.260 --> 1:48:46.820]  to reorder and we probably won't have it until I would think May of next year and a lot of
[1:48:46.820 --> 1:48:47.820]  you love bone broth.
[1:48:47.820 --> 1:48:50.460]  It's in our top five best sellers.
[1:48:50.460 --> 1:48:54.980]  There are others out there that cost 40, 50, $60 that aren't even as strong or as good
[1:48:54.980 --> 1:48:55.980]  as this.
[1:48:55.980 --> 1:48:59.860]  Now this has the turmeric in it as well.
[1:48:59.860 --> 1:49:07.140]  It's got just a lot of amazing things in it and people love it.
[1:49:07.140 --> 1:49:14.100]  Infowarstore.com has it at 50% off, $24.95 and your purchase of this makes our broadcast
[1:49:14.100 --> 1:49:15.100]  possible.
[1:49:15.100 --> 1:49:19.940]  Our ancestors knew the power of simmering down bones and joints into a super health tonic
[1:49:19.940 --> 1:49:20.940]  known as bone broth.
[1:49:20.940 --> 1:49:22.220]  Every culture did it.
[1:49:22.220 --> 1:49:26.140]  This sacred tradition was not just important ancient man, it could mean the difference
[1:49:26.140 --> 1:49:28.420]  between life and death.
[1:49:28.420 --> 1:49:32.220]  Man was in constant state of hunting and being hunted and the powerful minerals and collagen
[1:49:32.220 --> 1:49:35.540]  and bone broth were essential to the, a lot of studies show making our brains grow bigger
[1:49:35.540 --> 1:49:37.460]  and making it stronger and taller.
[1:49:37.460 --> 1:49:40.740]  Generations later we have forgotten about the ancient health secret our ancestors cherished,
[1:49:40.740 --> 1:49:43.780]  at least to grind up bones and put it into the bread.
[1:49:43.780 --> 1:49:48.460]  Remember P-5 fofum, I smell the blood of an Englishman, be he alive or be he dead, I'll
[1:49:48.460 --> 1:49:49.860]  grind his bones to make my bread.
[1:49:49.860 --> 1:49:56.140]  That's at least 600 year old nursery rhyme or story which just documents that they would
[1:49:56.140 --> 1:50:00.980]  grind up bones and put it in the bread that has all the minerals.
[1:50:00.980 --> 1:50:03.500]  That's why Infowar's life developed the ultimate bone broth formula.
[1:50:03.500 --> 1:50:07.660]  Our exclusive formula harnesses the ancient power of bone broth and cutting edge nutritional
[1:50:07.660 --> 1:50:11.740]  science to support healthy digestion, muscles, tendons and so much more.
[1:50:11.740 --> 1:50:15.300]  Ultimate bone broth comes in seven key super foods and compounds for an extremely affordable
[1:50:15.300 --> 1:50:16.300]  price.
[1:50:16.300 --> 1:50:22.540]  It's a good deal at $45 but I can tell you at $24.95 it's an amazing deal and again we're
[1:50:22.540 --> 1:50:26.660]  going to have some of the best sales ever because we're selling out of all these products
[1:50:26.660 --> 1:50:30.380]  at low prices to make sure we can even order them for next year because I can do a catch
[1:50:30.380 --> 1:50:36.260]  22 here and just, I can sell all of our inventory out and operate for a year just fine.
[1:50:36.260 --> 1:50:38.500]  But then I'd never reorder, we'd have to shut down.
[1:50:38.500 --> 1:50:41.620]  That's how close we are on the margins in this fight going on this critical election
[1:50:41.620 --> 1:50:42.620]  year.
[1:50:42.620 --> 1:50:46.220]  So get a great bone broth, try it out, see the effects for yourself, get some X2, get
[1:50:46.220 --> 1:50:50.180]  some DNA force plus 50% off, get a t-shirt, whatever, support the broadcast, sign up for
[1:50:50.180 --> 1:50:54.500]  auto-ship, get an additional 10% off of your future orders, cancel any time, a lot of other
[1:50:54.500 --> 1:50:56.580]  specials at m4store.com just know this.
[1:50:56.580 --> 1:50:58.780]  You are the patrons that make this all possible.
[1:50:58.780 --> 1:51:01.380]  It's not the sponsors, that funds the network.
[1:51:01.380 --> 1:51:03.980]  Less than 5% of our funding now is sponsorship.
[1:51:03.980 --> 1:51:05.540]  You've seen the boycotts, the attacks, all of it.
[1:51:05.540 --> 1:51:07.300]  We are direct sales to you.
[1:51:07.300 --> 1:51:08.420]  That's how we fund the operation.
[1:51:08.420 --> 1:51:09.420]  So thank you.
[1:51:09.420 --> 1:51:13.140]  You are the info war and all the devastating stuff we roll out, the fearlessness.
[1:51:13.140 --> 1:51:16.420]  That's all there because you provided the platform, so I'm very, very thankful to all
[1:51:16.420 --> 1:51:17.420]  of you.
[1:51:17.420 --> 1:51:19.420]  Well, constitutional lawyer Norm Pattis is here with us.
[1:51:19.420 --> 1:51:23.460]  He's got a lot he wants to cover, and I always kind of dive in when he's here, instead of
[1:51:23.460 --> 1:51:30.180]  letting him upfront, we haven't done any pre-talking about what he wants to cover or not much.
[1:51:30.180 --> 1:51:31.900]  Tell us, what do you want to cover in the next hour?
[1:51:31.900 --> 1:51:35.460]  Well, you know, I was listening with great attention to everything you had to say today,
[1:51:35.460 --> 1:51:38.540]  and we talked briefly this morning about talking about the threat to the Bill of Rights and
[1:51:38.540 --> 1:51:40.700]  whether it could be passed today.
[1:51:40.700 --> 1:51:42.060]  And I have my doubts.
[1:51:42.060 --> 1:51:48.140]  When I was watching you talk about the algorithms, what's going on in China, big tech, big chai
[1:51:48.140 --> 1:51:51.580]  comm, so to speak, taken over the world, I thought, yeah, absolutely.
[1:51:51.580 --> 1:51:52.580]  And let me tell you something.
[1:51:52.580 --> 1:51:56.660]  Those fights go on daily in courtrooms, and I can talk about each one of the ten amendments,
[1:51:56.660 --> 1:52:00.660]  or, well, nine of the ten amendments, with great particularity about what's going on
[1:52:00.660 --> 1:52:01.660]  in courts.
[1:52:01.660 --> 1:52:03.300]  Take a look at the First Amendment, for example.
[1:52:03.300 --> 1:52:06.380]  But before we go to the particular amendments, ask yourself the following.
[1:52:06.380 --> 1:52:09.660]  Would we even bother with the First Amendment today?
[1:52:09.660 --> 1:52:13.860]  You know, I heard you talking about Jeff Epstein in the social media lab at MIT.
[1:52:13.860 --> 1:52:19.620]  I don't know if you've had a chance yet, Alex, to read Alex Pentland's Social Physics,
[1:52:19.620 --> 1:52:22.420]  an absolutely terrifying book.
[1:52:22.420 --> 1:52:23.420]  Remember B.F.
[1:52:23.420 --> 1:52:27.540]  Skinner, who thought that freedom was an illusion, and if we only understood well enough everything
[1:52:27.540 --> 1:52:30.100]  that led to our behavior, we could engineer happiness?
[1:52:30.100 --> 1:52:33.020]  He told us that we were machines, that we didn't have souls, that we didn't have free
[1:52:33.020 --> 1:52:34.020]  will.
[1:52:34.020 --> 1:52:36.740]  And that's Pentland's dream, by harvesting big data.
[1:52:36.740 --> 1:52:41.460]  So let's remember, where is the biggest market for big data, with fewest restrictions, China?
[1:52:41.460 --> 1:52:45.220]  You can develop an algorithm that predicts what it is to make us happy.
[1:52:45.220 --> 1:52:49.540]  We've talked before about Shoshana Zuboff's book on the Age of Surveillance Capitalism.
[1:52:49.540 --> 1:52:55.420]  My fear is that we can compose an algorithm for the maximum efficient use of resources.
[1:52:55.420 --> 1:52:56.940]  There's an attack on free will.
[1:52:56.940 --> 1:53:02.180]  And put in the invisible hand, Adam Smith's invisible hand will no longer be invisible.
[1:53:02.180 --> 1:53:04.300]  It'll be Big Brother or Big Other.
[1:53:04.300 --> 1:53:07.580]  And so where do we see Big Other chipping away at our freedoms?
[1:53:07.580 --> 1:53:10.100]  The First Amendment, conformism, hate speech.
[1:53:10.100 --> 1:53:11.100]  Oh, that's right.
[1:53:11.100 --> 1:53:14.140]  They're trying to target the invisible hand that is the will of the people.
[1:53:14.140 --> 1:53:17.660]  That's why they're trying to get rid of like votes on Facebook and on Google.
[1:53:17.660 --> 1:53:20.660]  That's why Rotten Tomatoes are trying to get away from the people being able to vote what
[1:53:20.660 --> 1:53:23.300]  movies they like because it's always the opposite of what the critics say.
[1:53:23.300 --> 1:53:26.620]  They're trying to literally create a system where we're not given choice.
[1:53:26.620 --> 1:53:28.820]  They're trying to silence this network, in part.
[1:53:28.820 --> 1:53:31.780]  They're trying to silence it because they're uncomfortable with the fact that you're calling
[1:53:31.780 --> 1:53:35.940]  them out on what's going on in this country, and in courtrooms in Connecticut, in courtrooms
[1:53:35.940 --> 1:53:41.500]  in Texas, there are fights against info wars because they want info wars off the air.
[1:53:41.500 --> 1:53:45.900]  Your speech, I haven't heard a thing on the air today that ought not to be protected and
[1:53:45.900 --> 1:53:48.260]  cherished by any freedom-loving patriot.
[1:53:48.260 --> 1:53:52.180]  You're raising questions about what's going on in the country, who's pulling the strings,
[1:53:52.180 --> 1:53:54.020]  and what direction we're tending.
[1:53:54.020 --> 1:53:55.580]  Isn't that what a republic is?
[1:53:55.580 --> 1:53:58.260]  Cicero nailed it back in Roman times.
[1:53:58.260 --> 1:54:02.020]  He said a republic, a raised publica, is not just any collection of people.
[1:54:02.020 --> 1:54:06.140]  It's a people bound together with common interests and common conceptions of right.
[1:54:06.140 --> 1:54:10.300]  They're afraid of the marketplace of ideas right now, and they want to silence outspoken
[1:54:10.300 --> 1:54:11.300]  people.
[1:54:11.300 --> 1:54:13.060]  The First Amendment is under threat.
[1:54:13.060 --> 1:54:16.860]  I love the fact that you've created the new video site.
[1:54:16.860 --> 1:54:18.100]  I hadn't heard of it until the summer.
[1:54:18.100 --> 1:54:19.100]  Band.video.
[1:54:19.100 --> 1:54:20.100]  I think that's a fantastic idea.
[1:54:20.100 --> 1:54:22.460]  We need a lot more contributors, but right now it's very easy to use.
[1:54:22.460 --> 1:54:23.460]  Works like an app.
[1:54:23.460 --> 1:54:24.460]  Works on everything.
[1:54:24.460 --> 1:54:25.460]  Band.video.
[1:54:25.460 --> 1:54:26.860]  It's got Paul Watson's, My Info.
[1:54:26.860 --> 1:54:31.060]  David Nino and Shroyer, and now, of course, we're also going to have on there Firepower
[1:54:31.060 --> 1:54:32.060]  starting with Will Johnson.
[1:54:32.060 --> 1:54:36.220]  We're going to be carrying his show, starts tonight, 7-9, and we're going to have a lot
[1:54:36.220 --> 1:54:39.900]  more contributors there so people can upload other places, but know they can upload here
[1:54:39.900 --> 1:54:42.380]  when they're contributors and know that it's going to be there and not going to be taken
[1:54:42.380 --> 1:54:43.380]  down.
[1:54:43.380 --> 1:54:44.380]  Well, watch what will happen.
[1:54:44.380 --> 1:54:46.300]  There'll be an effort to take it down somehow.
[1:54:46.300 --> 1:54:49.980]  I mean, I think, you know, at the forefront right now, even in the New York Times last
[1:54:49.980 --> 1:54:53.220]  week, there were discussions about trying to change the Communications Decency Act so
[1:54:53.220 --> 1:54:59.020]  that people who stream other people's content can't restrict it based on ideas.
[1:54:59.020 --> 1:55:00.460]  You've been restricted by Facebook.
[1:55:00.460 --> 1:55:01.460]  I keep urging you.
[1:55:01.460 --> 1:55:02.700]  Bring an action against Facebook.
[1:55:02.700 --> 1:55:03.700]  You may not win it.
[1:55:03.700 --> 1:55:04.700]  Well, you're here this week.
[1:55:04.700 --> 1:55:06.340]  You're here to talk about filing suit.
[1:55:06.340 --> 1:55:07.340]  We've got Barnes coming in.
[1:55:07.340 --> 1:55:08.340]  We're getting ready to file some suits.
[1:55:08.340 --> 1:55:09.340]  So that's why you're here.
[1:55:09.340 --> 1:55:10.340]  Good.
[1:55:10.340 --> 1:55:11.340]  Let's get it done.
[1:55:11.340 --> 1:55:12.340]  Second Amendment.
[1:55:12.340 --> 1:55:14.420]  I don't think anything needs to be said to your listeners about that.
[1:55:14.420 --> 1:55:15.700]  It is under siege.
[1:55:15.700 --> 1:55:20.620]  I love the picture of over Native Americans says, give us your guns.
[1:55:20.620 --> 1:55:21.620]  We'll make you safe.
[1:55:21.620 --> 1:55:24.060]  Native Americans gave it up, and now where are they?
[1:55:24.060 --> 1:55:25.060]  They're on reservations.
[1:55:25.060 --> 1:55:26.940]  They're living on plantations.
[1:55:26.940 --> 1:55:29.820]  I didn't think there was anything to be said about the Third Amendment, but one of your
[1:55:29.820 --> 1:55:33.540]  people brought out the fact that there was recently an interesting lawsuit in Henderson,
[1:55:33.540 --> 1:55:36.300]  Nevada involving the Mitchell family.
[1:55:36.300 --> 1:55:39.900]  Police were doing surveillance of a domestic violence situation, and the police decided
[1:55:39.900 --> 1:55:43.780]  they wanted the Mitchell home to give them a vantage point to surveil what was going
[1:55:43.780 --> 1:55:45.020]  on in that target home.
[1:55:45.020 --> 1:55:46.420]  They threw them out of their own home.
[1:55:46.420 --> 1:55:50.260]  The Third Amendment said, you cannot be forced to quarter the sovereigns.
[1:55:50.260 --> 1:55:51.260]  Quarter troops.
[1:55:51.260 --> 1:55:53.300]  The state can't use your house for something.
[1:55:53.300 --> 1:55:55.900]  Now I've actually lived long enough to see a Third Amendment case.
[1:55:55.900 --> 1:55:56.900]  I forgot that case.
[1:55:56.900 --> 1:55:57.900]  I see you.
[1:55:57.900 --> 1:55:59.400]  Well, you guys put the article from Info Wars on Friday.
[1:55:59.400 --> 1:56:03.780]  It was in the Don Salas article, I think, in Michigan, a man jailed for criticizing
[1:56:03.780 --> 1:56:08.500]  judge on Facebook because the judge gave the girl to his wife.
[1:56:08.500 --> 1:56:13.100]  The baby died in his ex-wife's custody, and then he criticized the judge and they arrested
[1:56:13.100 --> 1:56:14.100]  him.
[1:56:14.100 --> 1:56:15.100]  Yeah, and there was no true threat there.
[1:56:15.100 --> 1:56:18.100]  I mean, you know, the true threat doctrine under the First Amendment says that, you know,
[1:56:18.100 --> 1:56:22.140]  if you threaten a person or create a fear that they're going to come under violence,
[1:56:22.140 --> 1:56:23.700]  you may have committed a crime.
[1:56:23.700 --> 1:56:25.900]  There's a lot to be said about that in the United States Supreme Court.
[1:56:25.900 --> 1:56:26.980]  We'll have to weigh in.
[1:56:26.980 --> 1:56:28.780]  But that wasn't even close to true threat.
[1:56:28.780 --> 1:56:33.100]  That was PC abandonment of the First Amendment's protection and vigorous speech.
[1:56:33.100 --> 1:56:37.380]  If we cannot stand in the streets, sit on the air, write letters, go to the newspapers
[1:56:37.380 --> 1:56:39.620]  and say to those who govern us, you're wrong.
[1:56:39.620 --> 1:56:40.860]  We demand better.
[1:56:40.860 --> 1:56:43.460]  If they have the right to silence us, we're done as a result.
[1:56:43.460 --> 1:56:46.300]  Well, it's like Tucker Carlson said like a year and a half ago when I started really
[1:56:46.300 --> 1:56:47.300]  getting banned.
[1:56:47.300 --> 1:56:49.780]  He said, Jones isn't being banned because what he's saying is not true.
[1:56:49.780 --> 1:56:50.780]  He's doing it.
[1:56:50.780 --> 1:56:52.700]  People are listening and it's scaring the system.
[1:56:52.700 --> 1:56:56.300]  He said, people can smell the truth and I'm not trying to brag about us.
[1:56:56.300 --> 1:57:00.600]  I'm covering all this crazy stuff that's been admitted in government, government white
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:05.900]  papers and in MIT documents and things, but isn't pop knowledge.
[1:57:05.900 --> 1:57:11.340]  But notice all of this human cloning and devices listening to you and secret societies, it's
[1:57:11.340 --> 1:57:14.380]  all becoming mainline because they can't hide it anymore.
[1:57:14.380 --> 1:57:18.140]  Well, and let's talk about the fourth of them and in privacy and surveillance in your
[1:57:18.140 --> 1:57:19.140]  own home.
[1:57:19.140 --> 1:57:22.460]  I was stunned by what I was watching on your show this morning about the various listening
[1:57:22.460 --> 1:57:27.180]  devices now tuning in on us on 1984 is today.
[1:57:27.180 --> 1:57:28.660]  The government is in our home.
[1:57:28.660 --> 1:57:29.660]  It's watching us.
[1:57:29.660 --> 1:57:30.660]  It's surveilling us.
[1:57:30.660 --> 1:57:33.700]  And there is a desire to create predictive policing.
[1:57:33.700 --> 1:57:37.220]  If you hear me engaging in an incendiary talk with my wife, maybe it'll be a knock the
[1:57:37.220 --> 1:57:38.220]  door tomorrow.
[1:57:38.220 --> 1:57:39.220]  Let's talk about that.
[1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:43.420]  Guys, print me that article about Trump considering the red flag stuff with big tech and the one
[1:57:43.420 --> 1:57:44.420]  about grabbing the dad.
[1:57:44.420 --> 1:57:46.180]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:46.180 --> 1:57:50.060]  And that's why we're introducing what we know is going to be a massive bestseller,
[1:57:50.060 --> 1:57:51.060]  chill force.
[1:57:51.060 --> 1:57:56.460]  Now let's look at what's in this powerful formula, ashwagandha root extract, an ancient
[1:57:56.460 --> 1:58:00.980]  medicinal herb used for over 3,000 years to treat stress and relax the patient.
[1:58:00.980 --> 1:58:05.340]  L-theony, a special amino acid naturally found in some tea leaves.
[1:58:05.340 --> 1:58:10.340]  The compound has been called the stress killer because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[1:58:10.340 --> 1:58:14.980]  GABA, an important neurotransmitter that controls functions of the body and mind, including
[1:58:14.980 --> 1:58:16.620]  nervous system relaxation.
[1:58:16.620 --> 1:58:19.860]  GABA is a choice for many to help reduce anxiety.
[1:58:19.860 --> 1:58:25.180]  Rodeola rosea root extract found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.
[1:58:25.180 --> 1:58:29.500]  This root is considered a super adaptogen and is believed to help the body in the fight
[1:58:29.500 --> 1:58:32.980]  against emotional, mental and physical stress.
[1:58:32.980 --> 1:58:46.940]  It's time to do what I did and take action with the Chill Force Challenge at InfowarsLive.com.
[1:58:46.940 --> 1:58:49.140]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:58:49.140 --> 1:58:50.380]  Alex, God bless you.
[1:58:50.380 --> 1:58:54.900]  I have an idea for a new Infowars t-shirt instead of this is your brain, this is your
[1:58:54.900 --> 1:58:58.540]  brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[1:58:58.540 --> 1:58:59.540]  Oh yeah.
[1:58:59.540 --> 1:59:00.540]  Showing your brain, getting fried.
[1:59:00.540 --> 1:59:03.660]  Then I have some comments on your supplements man, totally changed my life.
[1:59:03.660 --> 1:59:09.420]  I use turbo force, bodies, alpha power, brain force, fish oil, ultra 12, daily X2 every
[1:59:09.420 --> 1:59:10.420]  several days.
[1:59:10.420 --> 1:59:16.420]  Now what I've found is really combining them is totally synergistic and transcendent feeling
[1:59:16.420 --> 1:59:19.580]  that I get by combining all your products and I just want to urge all your listeners
[1:59:19.580 --> 1:59:21.540]  who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not.
[1:59:21.540 --> 1:59:25.540]  Well you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible whether it's turmeric
[1:59:25.540 --> 1:59:29.140]  or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the
[1:59:29.140 --> 1:59:31.540]  CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[1:59:31.540 --> 1:59:34.060]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[1:59:34.060 --> 1:59:38.060]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation, now you can build the big
[1:59:38.060 --> 1:59:39.060]  strong temple.
[1:59:39.060 --> 1:59:42.380]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so
[1:59:42.380 --> 1:59:45.860]  much better and then it funds the information war which is so critical.
[1:59:45.860 --> 1:59:50.140]  Thank you so much, God bless you.
[1:59:50.140 --> 2:00:01.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:00:01.820 --> 2:00:04.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:04.140 --> 2:00:09.140]  Okay the crew does an amazing job getting me all these clips and then I some days never
[2:00:09.140 --> 2:00:10.140]  get to any of them.
[2:00:10.140 --> 2:00:15.380]  Next seven were going to go through a bunch of these but the one that got me talking was
[2:00:15.380 --> 2:00:19.220]  with you this morning briefly was, I said what do you want to get into and you said
[2:00:19.220 --> 2:00:22.780]  the attack on the basic Bill of Rights, now it's going out the window and I said funny,
[2:00:22.780 --> 2:00:27.220]  let me send you this article, dim representative Claiborne, number two in the Democrats in the
[2:00:27.220 --> 2:00:32.220]  House, says the Bill of Rights wouldn't pass in today's climate, we'll play it next segment.
[2:00:32.220 --> 2:00:37.500]  But they're admitting this but then still it seems like particularly the Democrats are
[2:00:37.500 --> 2:00:43.100]  trying to get rid of the First Amendment, the Second Amendment because they see Republicans
[2:00:43.100 --> 2:00:47.420]  using the Bill of Rights for their power but the Republicans a lot historically aren't
[2:00:47.420 --> 2:00:53.940]  for parts of the Bill of Rights either and I'm seeing a lot of silence from Republicans
[2:00:53.940 --> 2:00:58.740]  and only a little bit of talk from Trump about taking action and I don't see how he wins
[2:00:58.740 --> 2:01:05.660]  the election or Republicans keep the House, which is already lost or the Senate, if something
[2:01:05.660 --> 2:01:07.980]  isn't done about big tech and it's meddling.
[2:01:07.980 --> 2:01:11.780]  I don't know if we have the will to do anything about big tech, it brings us a lot of goodies,
[2:01:11.780 --> 2:01:16.820]  a lot of toys, you look at these ads for Nest and so forth and it seems like a great magical
[2:01:16.820 --> 2:01:17.820]  world.
[2:01:17.820 --> 2:01:20.780]  You wave and there's your favorite TV show, you put your hand up the music stops, you
[2:01:20.780 --> 2:01:23.820]  put it back down, the music goes on, you want it up, you want it down, you want to move
[2:01:23.820 --> 2:01:24.820]  the camera.
[2:01:24.820 --> 2:01:29.940]  I mean we are becoming a race of digital idiots and you know life is risk, no one gets out
[2:01:29.940 --> 2:01:30.940]  of here alive.
[2:01:30.940 --> 2:01:34.140]  I don't care how much money you have, you may think you're going to live forever but
[2:01:34.140 --> 2:01:35.780]  there's nobody who's done it yet.
[2:01:35.780 --> 2:01:40.180]  The point is not to live as Plato once said, the point is to live well and living well
[2:01:40.180 --> 2:01:44.700]  means respecting human dignity and respecting one another and placing limits on the power
[2:01:44.700 --> 2:01:45.700]  of government.
[2:01:45.700 --> 2:01:50.740]  All the studies show that this big tech, smart tech is making us dumb, making us alone, giving
[2:01:50.740 --> 2:01:54.220]  us cancer, ruining our lives, stealing our time.
[2:01:54.220 --> 2:01:58.220]  All the studies show going out in nature, going and playing golf, going for a hike,
[2:01:58.220 --> 2:02:01.540]  having sex with your wife, eating good food, hanging out with friends, listening to great
[2:02:01.540 --> 2:02:02.540]  music.
[2:02:02.540 --> 2:02:07.220]  All that culture is being sucked out and now Facebook, Google, all of them have these
[2:02:07.220 --> 2:02:12.100]  systems that control and watch where now they're not even going to have knobs or controls
[2:02:12.100 --> 2:02:14.940]  on cars or anything, you just wave at a camera.
[2:02:14.940 --> 2:02:21.660]  The whole system is we're merging with cameras with AI controlling us, predatory AI with
[2:02:21.660 --> 2:02:26.700]  a so-called elite telling us we're obsolete and that this cyborg takeover, we're the last
[2:02:26.700 --> 2:02:27.700]  human generation.
[2:02:27.700 --> 2:02:31.940]  Imagine if Hitler said, this is the last human generation.
[2:02:31.940 --> 2:02:35.100]  He wasn't saying kill all humans, he just said kill some.
[2:02:35.100 --> 2:02:38.180]  This is beyond Hitler and it's liberal, it's loving.
[2:02:38.180 --> 2:02:42.900]  Well, what it is, is most of us have become surplus, I mean we need to face the possibility
[2:02:42.900 --> 2:02:47.740]  that there can be a maximum efficient distribution and production of resources with less than
[2:02:47.740 --> 2:02:48.820]  full employment.
[2:02:48.820 --> 2:02:50.900]  And what are you going to do with people who aren't employed?
[2:02:50.900 --> 2:02:53.460]  Why do we have a suicide epidemic throughout the Midwest?
[2:02:53.460 --> 2:02:56.020]  Why do we have opioid epidemics?
[2:02:56.020 --> 2:02:59.700]  We used to be digitally rectus or homo erectus, now we're digital something or other.
[2:02:59.700 --> 2:03:03.220]  I was in the airport on the flight out here yesterday watching people walking around the
[2:03:03.220 --> 2:03:04.220]  terminal doing this.
[2:03:04.220 --> 2:03:07.340]  They weren't watching where they were going, they were bumping into one another.
[2:03:07.340 --> 2:03:12.460]  And that's become our new national pastime, but you got to fight back and I quit Facebook,
[2:03:12.460 --> 2:03:17.180]  I quit Twitter earlier in the year, I missed it for a while but I haven't missed it since.
[2:03:17.180 --> 2:03:20.860]  I make an effort every day to shake the hand of at least one stranger and make some human
[2:03:20.860 --> 2:03:21.860]  connection.
[2:03:21.860 --> 2:03:25.780]  That's what the Bill of Rights was about, it was about individuals respecting one another.
[2:03:25.780 --> 2:03:28.860]  And with respect to the Fourth Amendment, it's under siege and that we no longer have
[2:03:28.860 --> 2:03:32.340]  a reasonable expectation of privacy in just about anything we do.
[2:03:32.340 --> 2:03:37.060]  And we've given to non-state actors the right to surveil us and the right to tell us what
[2:03:37.060 --> 2:03:42.820]  to invite themselves into our home and now apparently flag the government if we, according
[2:03:42.820 --> 2:03:46.100]  to some algorithm, behave in a suspicious manner.
[2:03:46.100 --> 2:03:50.220]  You talked about the red flags business that Trump spoke about last week or how about the
[2:03:50.220 --> 2:03:55.020]  social media metric in China where your access to public goods and services will depend on
[2:03:55.020 --> 2:03:56.020]  your social media.
[2:03:56.020 --> 2:04:00.660]  Well that's what this is and now it's here, the mark of the beast for Christians, big
[2:04:00.660 --> 2:04:02.580]  brother on steroids for everybody else.
[2:04:02.580 --> 2:04:05.820]  Well, unhandedly, you're the canary in the mine shaft, you're the easy target.
[2:04:05.820 --> 2:04:10.580]  They took you off Facebook and I'm surprised that anyone who cares about freedom of expression
[2:04:10.580 --> 2:04:14.780]  tolerates that because if it was you first, who is it second, who is it third, who is
[2:04:14.780 --> 2:04:15.780]  it fourth?
[2:04:15.780 --> 2:04:19.820]  Well you're right, we've already been hypnotized by the machines, we've already been habituated
[2:04:19.820 --> 2:04:24.140]  like Sean Parker used to head up Facebook, he was the number two and he said, we designed
[2:04:24.140 --> 2:04:26.100]  to be addictive and to hurt you.
[2:04:26.100 --> 2:04:29.180]  And now everyone I know, including myself a certain extent though, I'm weaning off
[2:04:29.180 --> 2:04:34.140]  of it, just can't watch a football game, can't watch tennis last night, I mean my wife wouldn't
[2:04:34.140 --> 2:04:35.140]  get off her damn phone.
[2:04:35.140 --> 2:04:39.220]  And I said, I'm going to Batman, I mean she just had the damn thing the whole time, it
[2:04:39.220 --> 2:04:43.620]  was all mindless text and this and keep crack of that, none of it means anything.
[2:04:43.620 --> 2:04:46.980]  When we come back, let's talk about the fifth, sixth and seventh amendment because there
[2:04:46.980 --> 2:04:49.180]  are more threats than we've talked about.
[2:04:49.180 --> 2:04:55.340]  That's right, Norm Patis constitutional lawyer, Par excellence is in studio.
[2:04:55.340 --> 2:04:59.740]  Band.video is the answer to censorship.
[2:04:59.740 --> 2:05:06.140]  Band.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life,
[2:05:06.140 --> 2:05:12.980]  pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook and
[2:05:12.980 --> 2:05:14.980]  Twitter are still available.
[2:05:14.980 --> 2:05:18.300]  We've launched it ladies and gentlemen, it's now live.
[2:05:18.300 --> 2:05:24.460]  Band.video, band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight
[2:05:24.460 --> 2:05:27.260]  or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos.
[2:05:27.260 --> 2:05:32.260]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted and where a growing
[2:05:32.260 --> 2:05:38.260]  list of freedom loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down,
[2:05:38.260 --> 2:05:43.300]  free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood
[2:05:43.300 --> 2:05:45.300]  scum and the globalist.
[2:05:45.300 --> 2:05:49.620]  Freedom of speech has a home, it's called band.video.
[2:05:49.620 --> 2:05:58.780]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[2:05:58.780 --> 2:06:05.500]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[2:06:05.500 --> 2:06:06.500]  the info war.
[2:06:06.500 --> 2:06:15.060]  Well, Ron manual is blocking every major Democrat candidate saying you just can't have all these
[2:06:15.060 --> 2:06:19.900]  illegals come in, everybody else can get free healthcare, free education, free home, free
[2:06:19.900 --> 2:06:20.900]  car.
[2:06:20.900 --> 2:06:22.420]  Who's going to pay for it all?
[2:06:22.420 --> 2:06:23.900]  Oh, the people they tax.
[2:06:23.900 --> 2:06:28.020]  Not the big mega corporations, they're tax exempt and offshore, but the big billionaires
[2:06:28.020 --> 2:06:33.180]  are trying to get the general public to attack, to sick the middle class and complete the
[2:06:33.180 --> 2:06:37.820]  collapse of the U.S. that's actually a Democrat party plan called clowered and pivot way down
[2:06:37.820 --> 2:06:40.820]  the capitalist system till it collapses.
[2:06:40.820 --> 2:06:43.540]  Here is Ron manual.
[2:06:43.540 --> 2:06:48.380]  We've taken a position so far and the candidates have, through the process, few have not, about
[2:06:48.380 --> 2:06:53.020]  on basically Medicare for all, which is we're going to eliminate 150 million people's healthcare
[2:06:53.020 --> 2:06:56.220]  and we're going to provide healthcare for people that just come over the border.
[2:06:56.220 --> 2:06:58.740]  That is an untenable position for the general election.
[2:06:58.740 --> 2:07:04.180]  As you know, George, I just biked around Lake Michigan nearly a thousand miles through
[2:07:04.180 --> 2:07:07.020]  Michigan and Wisconsin, two really important states.
[2:07:07.020 --> 2:07:10.780]  Nobody at a diner ran at me and said, take my healthcare away, nobody.
[2:07:10.780 --> 2:07:15.220]  This is reckless as it relates to, and you don't have to take the position to win the
[2:07:15.220 --> 2:07:20.940]  primary and you're basically literally hindering yourself for the general election.
[2:07:20.940 --> 2:07:24.180]  But he's saying don't tell him what we're really thinking, what we're planning.
[2:07:24.180 --> 2:07:25.700]  Big corporations will still run it.
[2:07:25.700 --> 2:07:30.580]  His brother helped write Obamacare once it bankrupts things in a decade or so.
[2:07:30.580 --> 2:07:34.860]  Then they have three insurance companies and then you'll have single payer, but they'll
[2:07:34.860 --> 2:07:35.860]  rape you even worse.
[2:07:35.860 --> 2:07:40.140]  So it's going to be fascism using socialism at the grassroots to control you.
[2:07:40.140 --> 2:07:42.140]  A true marriage made now.
[2:07:42.140 --> 2:07:45.220]  We'll talk about that with Norm Patis constitutional lawyer here in a moment.
[2:07:45.220 --> 2:07:46.220]  That's part one.
[2:07:46.220 --> 2:07:49.820]  Part two, this is the Democrat whip number two in the House of Representatives of the
[2:07:49.820 --> 2:07:52.580]  Democratic Party.
[2:07:52.580 --> 2:07:57.020]  Representative James Clyburn has come out and said the bill of rights wouldn't pass today.
[2:07:57.020 --> 2:08:03.060]  I believe sincerely the climate they were in today is the bill of rights.
[2:08:03.060 --> 2:08:07.820]  The first ten of members of the United States Constitution were put before the public today.
[2:08:07.820 --> 2:08:12.900]  I'm not too sure that we will hold on to the bill of rights, especially when I see what
[2:08:12.900 --> 2:08:17.100]  people are doing with the second amendment and no telling what they would do with the
[2:08:17.100 --> 2:08:18.100]  first amendment.
[2:08:18.100 --> 2:08:19.100]  You really believe that.
[2:08:19.100 --> 2:08:20.100]  That's a startling statement.
[2:08:20.100 --> 2:08:21.100]  You believe that?
[2:08:21.100 --> 2:08:22.100]  Absolutely.
[2:08:22.100 --> 2:08:25.340]  There will be strong support against the bill of rights.
[2:08:25.340 --> 2:08:30.140]  Go through the bill of rights and I tell you I run into people every day who would like
[2:08:30.140 --> 2:08:34.340]  to see so much of those guarantees uploaded.
[2:08:34.340 --> 2:08:39.940]  So you don't test stuff up in order to improve on it.
[2:08:39.940 --> 2:08:42.140]  Let's look at what's wrong.
[2:08:42.140 --> 2:08:47.500]  Let's look at what can be improved and let's go out and work together to improve these
[2:08:47.500 --> 2:08:48.500]  things.
[2:08:48.500 --> 2:08:52.620]  Not just throw things out and then say let's start over.
[2:08:52.620 --> 2:08:53.620]  No.
[2:08:53.620 --> 2:08:54.620]  No.
[2:08:54.620 --> 2:08:56.500]  We don't start over in this country.
[2:08:56.500 --> 2:08:58.740]  We correct our faults.
[2:08:58.740 --> 2:09:04.740]  I should have started the broadcast with that today because that's the number two guy in
[2:09:04.740 --> 2:09:10.620]  the House of Representatives of the Democratic Party.
[2:09:10.620 --> 2:09:15.460]  You sit there and you look at that.
[2:09:15.460 --> 2:09:17.020]  Why is he suddenly telling the truth?
[2:09:17.020 --> 2:09:19.340]  I've seen a lot of bad stuff out of that guy.
[2:09:19.340 --> 2:09:21.660]  Did he just get Jesus, Norm Pattis?
[2:09:21.660 --> 2:09:22.660]  What do you think?
[2:09:22.660 --> 2:09:24.540]  We've never been fully committed to the bill of rights.
[2:09:24.540 --> 2:09:29.140]  The country was founded on a moral compromise because of the three-fifth compromise in slavery.
[2:09:29.140 --> 2:09:32.860]  But to the degree we respect it now, I don't think people are committed to the Fifth Amendment
[2:09:32.860 --> 2:09:35.660]  rights to due process and the presumption of innocence.
[2:09:35.660 --> 2:09:37.940]  I'm representing in Connecticut photos do loads.
[2:09:37.940 --> 2:09:40.780]  A man believed to be responsible for the disappearance of his wife.
[2:09:40.780 --> 2:09:43.420]  I'll walk into a courtroom and reporters will be screaming at us.
[2:09:43.420 --> 2:09:44.660]  Why did you hurt your wife?
[2:09:44.660 --> 2:09:45.660]  Where's your wife?
[2:09:45.660 --> 2:09:46.660]  What did you do to her?
[2:09:46.660 --> 2:09:48.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, what about the presumption of innocence?
[2:09:48.500 --> 2:09:49.820]  What about a fair trial?
[2:09:49.820 --> 2:09:54.860]  I don't see jurors taking an active role or an active responsibility in deciding criminal
[2:09:54.860 --> 2:09:55.860]  cases.
[2:09:55.860 --> 2:09:59.900]  When's the last time you saw a juror raise a hand in the middle of trial and say, Judge,
[2:09:59.900 --> 2:10:03.140]  what's the penalty this man faces if we're convicting him?
[2:10:03.140 --> 2:10:06.780]  We say, we let prosecutors argue that jurors are the conscience of the community.
[2:10:06.780 --> 2:10:09.260]  We let prosecutors say that people should be held accountable.
[2:10:09.260 --> 2:10:11.340]  And then we don't let jurors know the full truth.
[2:10:11.340 --> 2:10:15.420]  We infantilize them or take the Sixth Amendment right to present a defense.
[2:10:15.420 --> 2:10:18.340]  We don't let jurors nullify the law.
[2:10:18.340 --> 2:10:21.780]  That's what freed John Peter's anger at the founding of the republic.
[2:10:21.780 --> 2:10:25.300]  We let jurors decide whether the government got the law right, whether it applied it in
[2:10:25.300 --> 2:10:26.300]  correctly.
[2:10:26.300 --> 2:10:27.980]  But they're supposed to judge the law as well as the facts.
[2:10:27.980 --> 2:10:29.180]  That's the jury nullification doctrine.
[2:10:29.180 --> 2:10:32.460]  Now, we have a case pending in the Second Circuit, the federal appellate court in New
[2:10:32.460 --> 2:10:36.100]  York City out of a Connecticut case where we're trying to get jury nullification back
[2:10:36.100 --> 2:10:37.180]  on the docket.
[2:10:37.180 --> 2:10:38.220]  And we're somewhat optimistic.
[2:10:38.220 --> 2:10:39.380]  We argued it six months ago.
[2:10:39.380 --> 2:10:40.980]  We still don't have a decision.
[2:10:40.980 --> 2:10:44.740]  If jurors are going to be the conscience of the community, then don't put blindfolds
[2:10:44.740 --> 2:10:47.060]  on them and say you can't know the truth.
[2:10:47.060 --> 2:10:50.700]  The truth may not set a client free, but it empowers a community.
[2:10:50.700 --> 2:10:54.900]  Seventh Amendment, the right to a jury trial, the doctrine of qualified immunity has made
[2:10:54.900 --> 2:10:57.620]  it very difficult to hold the government accountable in courtrooms.
[2:10:57.620 --> 2:11:01.020]  It gives judges the opportunity to throw cases out.
[2:11:01.020 --> 2:11:05.220]  Even Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are raising questions about qualified immunity.
[2:11:05.220 --> 2:11:08.940]  I think that's an issue that transcends the division between right and left.
[2:11:08.940 --> 2:11:12.940]  If we want to have a democracy, if we want to have a republic, if we want to have people
[2:11:12.940 --> 2:11:15.300]  engaged, we've got to give people power.
[2:11:15.300 --> 2:11:19.940]  And the most empowering place a person can be is on a jury in state or federal court.
[2:11:19.940 --> 2:11:22.940]  Let me ask you this question, not to bring myself into this, but I mean, it's a pretty
[2:11:22.940 --> 2:11:23.940]  big deal.
[2:11:23.940 --> 2:11:29.100]  Kostkov and Kostkov, one of the most powerful democratic law firms in the country, got Senator
[2:11:29.100 --> 2:11:31.140]  Blumenthal all over it.
[2:11:31.140 --> 2:11:35.340]  He has hearings in the Senate saying, I want Alan Schoen's totally banned from the Internet.
[2:11:35.340 --> 2:11:38.980]  He tells Google, I can still see some of him on YouTube.
[2:11:38.980 --> 2:11:42.860]  And YouTube doesn't say, well, he's a public figure, and so people get clips of him off
[2:11:42.860 --> 2:11:47.340]  a show and they make commentary.
[2:11:47.340 --> 2:11:53.620]  The Connecticut senator, senior senator, ranking senator, he says he wants me just banned period.
[2:11:53.620 --> 2:11:58.060]  Facebook has said my name, my likeness, they blur it out, even if people are being negative
[2:11:58.060 --> 2:11:59.980]  now they're even doing it.
[2:11:59.980 --> 2:12:04.820]  So the idea to unperson someone like that, and then I read how they've bankrupted Remington,
[2:12:04.820 --> 2:12:08.780]  oldest firearms manufacturer, thousands of jobs lost, and it's gone before the Supreme
[2:12:08.780 --> 2:12:14.540]  Court, because the Supreme Court of Connecticut has said that, oh yes, Remington's liable,
[2:12:14.540 --> 2:12:18.460]  even though it's a federal law saying they're not liable, well, if the Supreme Court rules
[2:12:18.460 --> 2:12:23.740]  against that, if someone kills people with a truck, then Ford is liable, or somebody
[2:12:23.740 --> 2:12:27.340]  buys a butcher knife and kills somebody illegally, then the knife maker's liable.
[2:12:27.340 --> 2:12:32.260]  I've never heard of such a thing in law.
[2:12:32.260 --> 2:12:38.420]  What is the codification of the basic fact that a company that makes something for one
[2:12:38.420 --> 2:12:42.420]  thing isn't liable for what somebody does with it another way, and then what will it
[2:12:42.420 --> 2:12:47.700]  be if the Supreme Court rules and says yes, Remington is guilty, then all of their gun
[2:12:47.700 --> 2:12:50.500]  manufacturers will basically be made to go bankrupt?
[2:12:50.500 --> 2:12:54.980]  On the Remington Sandy Hook case, there's a federal statute that says gun makers aren't
[2:12:54.980 --> 2:12:59.380]  liable for their weapons when they're used for the purposes the weapons were manufactured
[2:12:59.380 --> 2:13:00.540]  for.
[2:13:00.540 --> 2:13:04.760]  The Costco firm managed to persuade the Connecticut Supreme Court that under the Connecticut Unfair
[2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:10.140]  Trades practice, there was deceptive advertising that a weapon that had military purposes was
[2:13:10.140 --> 2:13:14.740]  sold for civilian use and that this fell outside the statutory immunity.
[2:13:14.740 --> 2:13:18.260]  The United States Supreme Court has agreed to hear that question, and I suspect they
[2:13:18.260 --> 2:13:19.780]  will reverse.
[2:13:19.780 --> 2:13:24.100]  As to Senator Blumenthal, I've got good news for you from the land of steady habits, Connecticut.
[2:13:24.100 --> 2:13:27.460]  Funny a people came up to me after he attacked you in the Congress and said, we'd rather
[2:13:27.460 --> 2:13:30.940]  hear more from Alex Jones and less from Senator Blumenthal.
[2:13:30.940 --> 2:13:36.260]  We get the government we deserve, in Connecticut we get Ichabod Crane's retarded cousin asking
[2:13:36.260 --> 2:13:42.300]  to silence you, so don't worry about Senator Blumenthal, you're doing just fine.
[2:13:42.300 --> 2:13:50.380]  Well let's go further with him though, because I mean this guy is waging war against reality.
[2:13:50.380 --> 2:13:55.100]  He said that he was in combat, there's even a New York Times article about it in Vietnam,
[2:13:55.100 --> 2:13:59.020]  when he literally had a plumb position in the Marine Corps where they send all the rich
[2:13:59.020 --> 2:14:03.420]  kids where he would get toys for tots, he was never in combat, never out of country,
[2:14:03.420 --> 2:14:08.140]  but he still, with certain audiences if a camera isn't there, will still say he's a Vietnam
[2:14:08.140 --> 2:14:09.140]  veteran.
[2:14:09.140 --> 2:14:14.300]  No, he's a veteran of the Vietnam era, who also I think once put his toe in the Harvard
[2:14:14.300 --> 2:14:18.940]  swimming pool and claimed falsely to be on the Harvard swim team.
[2:14:18.940 --> 2:14:19.940]  Senator.
[2:14:19.940 --> 2:14:21.860]  Well what he is, is he's the Brian Williams of the Senate.
[2:14:21.860 --> 2:14:25.580]  Yeah, fair enough, and he's earned the right to lie, and Connecticut voters keep returning
[2:14:25.580 --> 2:14:26.580]  him to office.
[2:14:26.580 --> 2:14:30.140]  That's why, they've not had an effective primary challenge against him, and all the time he's
[2:14:30.140 --> 2:14:33.940]  run, when he was Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, he was briefly...
[2:14:33.940 --> 2:14:36.700]  And his son is haunchoing the lawsuit against me.
[2:14:36.700 --> 2:14:40.060]  Well I wouldn't call it haunchoing, his son is briefcase carrying, Matt is a young lawyer
[2:14:40.060 --> 2:14:44.140]  of some promise, and he's been hired by the Costco firm, and he's one of the four lawyers
[2:14:44.140 --> 2:14:47.220]  who are tag teaming you.
[2:14:47.220 --> 2:14:52.100]  What's amazing to me is how the judge tells us, give us all the marketing for Sandy Hook,
[2:14:52.100 --> 2:14:54.260]  we barely ever covered it, you've been here, it doesn't exist.
[2:14:54.260 --> 2:14:55.260]  Right.
[2:14:55.260 --> 2:15:02.020]  So we know it does, and then now, when we come back, we'll briefly talk about this.
[2:15:02.020 --> 2:15:06.100]  Did you see where they said that I lost a suit for writing a book about Sandy Hook,
[2:15:06.100 --> 2:15:09.900]  that I'm not in the book, I didn't write the book, and AP won't even reverse the headline?
[2:15:09.900 --> 2:15:11.580]  I've seen a couple stories that are wrong.
[2:15:11.580 --> 2:15:14.940]  There was a story recently that you lost a Texas appeal and had to pay finances.
[2:15:14.940 --> 2:15:18.260]  I read that, and I sent you a note, I said, jeez, I'm sorry to read that, you sent me
[2:15:18.260 --> 2:15:19.260]  the ruling.
[2:15:19.260 --> 2:15:22.060]  The ruling's not even close to what the story said.
[2:15:22.060 --> 2:15:25.940]  Basically what happened is, in Texas, the judge didn't decide something quickly enough,
[2:15:25.940 --> 2:15:29.740]  your lawyers tried to get the case thrown out, they took it to the appellate court,
[2:15:29.740 --> 2:15:32.980]  the appellate court said, nah, we'll give them more time, now it goes back to the trial
[2:15:32.980 --> 2:15:34.260]  court for a ruling.
[2:15:34.260 --> 2:15:35.260]  That's it.
[2:15:35.260 --> 2:15:36.260]  Period.
[2:15:36.260 --> 2:15:37.260]  Zippo.
[2:15:37.260 --> 2:15:38.260]  You haven't lost a thing.
[2:15:38.260 --> 2:15:39.260]  Then he goes back up on appeal.
[2:15:39.260 --> 2:15:40.260]  That's exactly right.
[2:15:40.260 --> 2:15:41.260]  You haven't lost a thing.
[2:15:41.260 --> 2:15:43.900]  It's just incredible how they lied, it's done on purpose.
[2:15:43.900 --> 2:15:44.900]  Fake news.
[2:15:44.900 --> 2:15:45.900]  I now understand what it means.
[2:15:45.900 --> 2:15:48.900]  And then they have the lawyers going, we've never gotten anything from him, he won't give
[2:15:48.900 --> 2:15:49.900]  us anything in deposition.
[2:15:49.900 --> 2:15:50.900]  None of that's true.
[2:15:50.900 --> 2:15:53.820]  Let's not talk about Sandy Hook, I'll do my talking for you in court.
[2:15:53.820 --> 2:15:54.820]  All right.
[2:15:54.820 --> 2:16:00.540]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[2:16:00.540 --> 2:16:03.540]  Forget bunkers, you're not a live underground gopher.

[2:17:49.580 --> 2:18:19.420]  before purchasing, not an offer to buy or sell the security which requires an offering

[2:18:40.780 --> 2:18:43.780]  We have to keep winning. We have to win more.

[2:18:54.780 --> 2:18:56.780]  Infowars life philosophy is very, very simple.
[2:18:56.780 --> 2:18:59.780]  That's why it's been so successful and helped fund this revolution
[2:18:59.780 --> 2:19:01.780]  against the globalist thanks to your support.
[2:19:01.780 --> 2:19:05.780]  We go out and look at the industry of mother nature's bounty
[2:19:05.780 --> 2:19:07.780]  with the FDA called Supplements.
[2:19:07.780 --> 2:19:11.780]  And we look at what is the best selling, what's the highest rated,
[2:19:11.780 --> 2:19:13.780]  what people are saying they like the best.
[2:19:13.780 --> 2:19:17.780]  And then we go and make it even better with top manufacturers

[2:19:36.780 --> 2:19:41.780]  Ours, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest formula you're going to find.
[2:19:41.780 --> 2:19:46.780]  And as 2019 closes, we are selling out of it very, very quickly.

[2:19:50.780 --> 2:20:08.780]  ultimate bone broth at infowarstorelife.com.
[2:20:08.780 --> 2:20:12.780]  Certain countries have changed their dietary guidelines
[2:20:12.780 --> 2:20:15.780]  to reduce the consumption of red meat
[2:20:15.780 --> 2:20:18.780]  in light of the impact of the climate change.
[2:20:18.780 --> 2:20:25.780]  If elected, will you be supporting change in dietary guidelines?
[2:20:25.780 --> 2:20:28.780]  And then how will you plan on implementing the changes
[2:20:28.780 --> 2:20:31.780]  so that people effectively change the diets?
[2:20:31.780 --> 2:20:33.780]  Thank you for your question.
[2:20:33.780 --> 2:20:37.780]  Now, talking about meat, I had to get where I'm at today.
[2:20:37.780 --> 2:20:41.780]  Suck-off man Willie Brown, you know, he was my boyfriend, he was married, it's okay.
[2:20:41.780 --> 2:20:44.780]  But he was big, he was big.
[2:20:44.780 --> 2:20:46.780]  I had to do that to get where I am today.
[2:20:46.780 --> 2:20:51.780]  Yeah, that's why I'm on this stage trying to take away your meat and your plastic straws.
[2:20:51.780 --> 2:20:53.780]  So that's a good question.
[2:20:53.780 --> 2:20:57.780]  There's meat over here and there's meat over there.
[2:20:57.780 --> 2:21:00.780]  And we got to get through all this meat to get where we're going.
[2:21:00.780 --> 2:21:03.780]  Don't worry, we're going to take it all the way.
[2:21:06.780 --> 2:21:11.780]  Okay, folks, does that make me crazy?
[2:21:11.780 --> 2:21:16.780]  Wow.
[2:21:16.780 --> 2:21:19.780]  But it wasn't because it didn't know enough.
[2:21:19.780 --> 2:21:22.780]  I just knew too much.
[2:21:22.780 --> 2:21:25.780]  Mary Willie Brown said that's how she got it, this is the job.
[2:21:25.780 --> 2:21:28.780]  I mean, she would go in there and she would block and block folks up.
[2:21:28.780 --> 2:21:33.780]  Every time I come on this show, I'm rendered speechless by something, so, you know.
[2:21:33.780 --> 2:21:37.780]  Well, listen, I usually look at these memes before I air them,
[2:21:37.780 --> 2:21:41.780]  and I thought it was going to be her saying ban meat, which she's been calling for,
[2:21:41.780 --> 2:21:43.780]  which is now a mainline thing.
[2:21:43.780 --> 2:21:45.780]  They really just want to control it and tax it.
[2:21:45.780 --> 2:21:47.780]  And so I apologize this is a family show.
[2:21:47.780 --> 2:21:50.780]  I didn't review that, I usually review it.
[2:21:50.780 --> 2:21:52.780]  No, but let's keep on point with that.
[2:21:52.780 --> 2:21:54.780]  Space Force 7 is banned, sorry.
[2:21:54.780 --> 2:21:57.780]  But that's in keeping with the new algorithmic world.
[2:21:57.780 --> 2:22:01.780]  If we're going to have federal leadership, can't we be told how best to eat?
[2:22:01.780 --> 2:22:05.780]  And shouldn't the algorithm tell us what the ideal mix of protein and carbide?
[2:22:05.780 --> 2:22:08.780]  And then who, but see what they do is they program it like Bloomberg has said.
[2:22:08.780 --> 2:22:09.780]  He goes, I'm a technocrat.
[2:22:09.780 --> 2:22:13.780]  They program the computers, and then we do what the computers say.
[2:22:13.780 --> 2:22:18.780]  We can act like it's some magic computer in the sky that's like omnipresent and God.
[2:22:18.780 --> 2:22:20.780]  And that's the big trick of this.
[2:22:20.780 --> 2:22:21.780]  But here's the deal.
[2:22:21.780 --> 2:22:23.780]  Not everybody follows the algorithm.
[2:22:23.780 --> 2:22:27.780]  How many social media executives don't permit their children to get addicted to this stuff?
[2:22:27.780 --> 2:22:29.780]  They harvest the data, they live in the gay community.
[2:22:29.780 --> 2:22:30.780]  Oh, oh, oh, you're right.
[2:22:30.780 --> 2:22:32.780]  Bill Gates said his kids weren't allowed to have smartphones.
[2:22:32.780 --> 2:22:33.780]  No.
[2:22:33.780 --> 2:22:34.780]  Steve Jobs wouldn't let them have iPads.
[2:22:34.780 --> 2:22:36.780]  They don't want to profit off their own kids.
[2:22:36.780 --> 2:22:39.780]  They want those kids to enjoy the fruits of the new digital overlord ship,
[2:22:39.780 --> 2:22:43.780]  or the Uber mentioned, as you mentioned before, you know, absolutely right.
[2:22:43.780 --> 2:22:44.780]  So, I mean, you know, there was, you know,
[2:22:44.780 --> 2:22:47.780]  I'm glad you raised that point because we forget that they're all on record.
[2:22:47.780 --> 2:22:49.780]  They won't let their kids get anywhere near this stuff.
[2:22:49.780 --> 2:22:50.780]  No, no, no.
[2:22:50.780 --> 2:22:51.780]  Sorry.
[2:22:51.780 --> 2:22:53.780]  No, I mean, yeah, I'm still chuckling over the piece.
[2:22:53.780 --> 2:22:58.780]  But I mean, how much longer until we have an algorithm that rewards us for how we eat
[2:22:58.780 --> 2:23:01.780]  and algorithm that rewards us for penalizes us for whether we exercise,
[2:23:01.780 --> 2:23:05.780]  for example, there are discussions that insurers may use this to set rates.
[2:23:05.780 --> 2:23:06.780]  Don't get enough exercise.
[2:23:06.780 --> 2:23:07.780]  Don't eat right.
[2:23:07.780 --> 2:23:10.780]  Perhaps your automobile insurance or health insurance will go up a point or two.
[2:23:10.780 --> 2:23:12.780]  What's it have to do with automobile insurance?
[2:23:12.780 --> 2:23:15.780]  Because the algorithm says there's a de minimis risk that you may have a heart attack
[2:23:15.780 --> 2:23:16.780]  while behind the wheel.
[2:23:16.780 --> 2:23:18.780]  So you pay six bucks more.
[2:23:18.780 --> 2:23:21.780]  I mean, I don't want to be micromanaged and nickled and dime to death.
[2:23:21.780 --> 2:23:24.780]  Oh, yeah, it's like enterprise insurance started years ago,
[2:23:24.780 --> 2:23:27.780]  giving you a discount if you put a box in your car that tracks you.
[2:23:27.780 --> 2:23:29.780]  This is what the big corporates want.
[2:23:29.780 --> 2:23:31.780]  They're setting up a technocracy.
[2:23:31.780 --> 2:23:34.780]  That means government by a ruling group of technicians.
[2:23:34.780 --> 2:23:36.780]  We don't want a technological dictatorship.
[2:23:36.780 --> 2:23:37.780]  And I know the audience gets it.
[2:23:37.780 --> 2:23:41.780]  Norm Patis, you're a top criminal lawyer, constitutional lawyer, first woman lawyer.
[2:23:41.780 --> 2:23:46.780]  Why do you think all over the world governments have abandoned the egalitarian
[2:23:46.780 --> 2:23:50.780]  Western Renaissance of due process and things that have made it so safe
[2:23:50.780 --> 2:23:52.780]  and so much better than other countries?
[2:23:52.780 --> 2:23:57.780]  Why has there been it seems an abandonment of it and now a race to see who can get rid
[2:23:57.780 --> 2:24:01.780]  of all of our due process and all of our rights the fastest?
[2:24:01.780 --> 2:24:02.780]  I don't know.
[2:24:02.780 --> 2:24:05.780]  I don't see the race quite as much as I see us in the grips of technology
[2:24:05.780 --> 2:24:06.780]  that we don't understand.
[2:24:06.780 --> 2:24:08.780]  And I think there have always been a division.
[2:24:08.780 --> 2:24:11.780]  There has always been a division between haves and haves not.
[2:24:11.780 --> 2:24:12.780]  It's just growing now.
[2:24:12.780 --> 2:24:16.780]  And I think you just said it, the big tech guys even warn you and go,
[2:24:16.780 --> 2:24:17.780]  this is really dangerous.
[2:24:17.780 --> 2:24:18.780]  You shouldn't use it.
[2:24:18.780 --> 2:24:21.780]  But you know, once you plug in your brain, Elon Musk said that I will take over
[2:24:21.780 --> 2:24:24.780]  and starts laughing because he knows we can't help it.
[2:24:24.780 --> 2:24:25.780]  I don't carry a lot.
[2:24:25.780 --> 2:24:26.780]  He's like, well, I'll sell it to you then.
[2:24:26.780 --> 2:24:29.780]  They're a crack dealer saying this stuff will really mess your life up, kid.
[2:24:29.780 --> 2:24:30.780]  Here, take some.
[2:24:30.780 --> 2:24:31.780]  It's addictive.
[2:24:31.780 --> 2:24:33.780]  I think nothing addicts like success.
[2:24:33.780 --> 2:24:36.780]  And if you're generating these kind of big tech dollars and live in the dream life
[2:24:36.780 --> 2:24:40.780]  in Menlo Park or wherever these guys are living, I think it's hard to say no.
[2:24:40.780 --> 2:24:44.780]  And you have the attitude that the general public's profane and animals and dumb.
[2:24:44.780 --> 2:24:47.780]  And so you're just making it a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[2:24:47.780 --> 2:24:52.780]  In my view, the underreported story about the opioid problem isn't that Purdue Pharma
[2:24:52.780 --> 2:24:54.780]  and Company got mailed for selling it.
[2:24:54.780 --> 2:24:56.780]  Why they sell it and who bought it.
[2:24:56.780 --> 2:24:59.780]  Yeah, tell folks about that because it was in their business plan.
[2:24:59.780 --> 2:25:00.780]  They were going to hurt people.
[2:25:00.780 --> 2:25:02.780]  Well, they knew that people were going to be hurt.
[2:25:02.780 --> 2:25:03.780]  They knew that it would be over-prescribed.
[2:25:03.780 --> 2:25:05.780]  And they knew that people would become dependent.
[2:25:05.780 --> 2:25:06.780]  And they didn't care.
[2:25:06.780 --> 2:25:11.780]  And I frankly think they didn't care because you were talking earlier about reducing the population.
[2:25:11.780 --> 2:25:13.780]  I see it somewhat differently.
[2:25:13.780 --> 2:25:18.780]  I think we can reach efficiency, maximum efficient distribution of economic resources
[2:25:18.780 --> 2:25:20.780]  at less than full employment.
[2:25:20.780 --> 2:25:22.780]  What do you do with the surplus population?
[2:25:22.780 --> 2:25:25.780]  You either pension them off or you kill them.
[2:25:25.780 --> 2:25:30.780]  And when I look at the opioid epidemic and the great number of clients and family and friends of mine
[2:25:30.780 --> 2:25:32.780]  who have succumbed to it in the last decade,
[2:25:32.780 --> 2:25:37.780]  what most of these folks have in common is they didn't have a secure toehold in the economy
[2:25:37.780 --> 2:25:39.780]  or in the life that you and I take.
[2:25:39.780 --> 2:25:41.780]  Are anybody that cared about them to help them get out of it?
[2:25:41.780 --> 2:25:42.780]  That's right.
[2:25:42.780 --> 2:25:47.780]  Did you see last week or two weeks ago, they busted 25 tons of fentanyl being shipped in from China through Mexico to us
[2:25:47.780 --> 2:25:54.780]  and up to kill 10 billion, 606 million people plus if they all took a lethal dose of it.
[2:25:54.780 --> 2:25:56.780]  That's the national security crisis.
[2:25:56.780 --> 2:25:58.780]  And that's why the homelessness is exploding.
[2:25:58.780 --> 2:25:59.780]  It's not just mental illness.
[2:25:59.780 --> 2:26:04.780]  Most of these people, as you said, are on fentanyl or they're on other opiates.
[2:26:04.780 --> 2:26:06.780]  And this is incredible.
[2:26:06.780 --> 2:26:11.780]  We've recently taken a case of a doctor who was spotted on a DEA algorithm
[2:26:11.780 --> 2:26:14.780]  as having prescribed too much fentanyl.
[2:26:14.780 --> 2:26:17.780]  And now the feds are going through each one of his prescriptions
[2:26:17.780 --> 2:26:20.780]  to see which one of these people really needed it, which one of them didn't.
[2:26:20.780 --> 2:26:25.780]  It's intrusive, but it raises the larger question about the bill of rights and how serious we are.
[2:26:25.780 --> 2:26:29.780]  If you could sacrifice, let me hear your thought experiment, Alex.
[2:26:29.780 --> 2:26:35.780]  If I could tell you, if I could make you happy, healthy, and wealthy beyond your wildest dreams tomorrow,
[2:26:35.780 --> 2:26:37.780]  would you say yes to anything I had to say?
[2:26:37.780 --> 2:26:38.780]  You might.
[2:26:38.780 --> 2:26:43.780]  Suppose then you woke up with all the money, having robbed a bank, living off the interest of that
[2:26:43.780 --> 2:26:48.780]  or at least I robbed it on your behalf, strapped to a gurney in a bomb shelter with fentanyl
[2:26:48.780 --> 2:26:52.780]  or a non-lethal dose of an opioid pumped in your veins so that you're blissfully happy,
[2:26:52.780 --> 2:26:54.780]  you're entirely secure, and you're wealthy.
[2:26:54.780 --> 2:26:58.780]  You've gotten everything you wanted, but at the cost of everything you desire,
[2:26:58.780 --> 2:26:59.780]  everything that you value.
[2:26:59.780 --> 2:27:01.780]  And I think that's what we're doing here.
[2:27:01.780 --> 2:27:04.780]  I think in terms of the larger cultural thing, pluralism has gone to an extreme.
[2:27:04.780 --> 2:27:06.780]  We're afraid to talk about values.
[2:27:06.780 --> 2:27:08.780]  Everything is reduced to pathos.
[2:27:08.780 --> 2:27:10.780]  That's how we come together with giant pity parties.
[2:27:10.780 --> 2:27:16.780]  We're afraid to say to one person, your lifestyle is offensive or wrong
[2:27:16.780 --> 2:27:18.780]  because it doesn't contribute to the public wheel.
[2:27:18.780 --> 2:27:22.780]  We never had that problem, historically saying, if you don't contribute, you don't get.
[2:27:22.780 --> 2:27:26.780]  Today, everybody's entitled and we're afraid to say no to anybody and campus-
[2:27:26.780 --> 2:27:30.780]  And then those of us who do produce are constantly being attacked and being bullied
[2:27:30.780 --> 2:27:32.780]  to give more to all the little babies.
[2:27:32.780 --> 2:27:36.780]  They've now organized themselves into mind control brigades.
[2:27:36.780 --> 2:27:39.780]  Prince and princess wine a lot are running the country.
[2:27:39.780 --> 2:27:43.780]  I would appeal to your viewers to take one small step and defiance each day.
[2:27:43.780 --> 2:27:44.780]  Remember the network?
[2:27:44.780 --> 2:27:45.780]  I'm mad as hell.
[2:27:45.780 --> 2:27:46.780]  I don't want to take it anymore.
[2:27:46.780 --> 2:27:47.780]  Raise your hand in a jury.
[2:27:47.780 --> 2:27:48.780]  Say, what's going on here?
[2:27:48.780 --> 2:27:52.780]  Raise your hand when you see somebody giving a PC tirade saying, do I really care?
[2:27:52.780 --> 2:27:53.780]  Raise your hand.
[2:27:53.780 --> 2:27:54.780]  Stop submitting.
[2:27:54.780 --> 2:27:56.780]  Stop thinking you're getting brownie points.
[2:27:56.780 --> 2:28:00.780]  You know, for like all over the country, men are beating women in powerlifting
[2:28:00.780 --> 2:28:02.780]  and soccer and everything.
[2:28:02.780 --> 2:28:05.780]  And it's big, giant men running over women.
[2:28:05.780 --> 2:28:08.780]  Huge men, obviously on steroids on top of it.
[2:28:08.780 --> 2:28:12.780]  And then they're giving them all the trophies and everyone's, oh, you're so tolerant.
[2:28:12.780 --> 2:28:14.780]  You're so open, letting men come compete.
[2:28:14.780 --> 2:28:15.780]  They're men.
[2:28:15.780 --> 2:28:17.780]  They're not women.
[2:28:17.780 --> 2:28:20.780]  It's now morally suspect to be a white male.
[2:28:20.780 --> 2:28:23.780]  I would like to see you create a new show on here called The Last White Male.
[2:28:23.780 --> 2:28:28.780]  Every day that I look at the news, I see a story where somehow it's, you know,
[2:28:28.780 --> 2:28:30.780]  white male privilege has destroyed this.
[2:28:30.780 --> 2:28:32.780]  White male privilege has destroyed that.
[2:28:32.780 --> 2:28:35.780]  White male privilege is that I don't feel too privileged when I get up in the morning.
[2:28:35.780 --> 2:28:39.780]  I got to work pretty hard and yes, I suppose there are advantages that I have
[2:28:39.780 --> 2:28:41.780]  because of how I was born.
[2:28:41.780 --> 2:28:44.780]  But that's why everybody's trying to get in the country because it was western
[2:28:44.780 --> 2:28:47.780]  and it had the ethos of the Renaissance.
[2:28:47.780 --> 2:28:49.780]  But the globalists want the Renaissance gone.
[2:28:49.780 --> 2:28:51.780]  They don't want the world asking for that.
[2:28:51.780 --> 2:29:16.780]  They want it gone.

[2:30:19.780 --> 2:30:22.780]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[2:30:22.780 --> 2:30:24.780]  That's why it's so strong.
[2:30:24.780 --> 2:30:28.780]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.

[2:31:57.780 --> 2:31:58.780]  I've been so busy.
[2:31:58.780 --> 2:32:02.780]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news, but it's very exciting.
[2:32:02.780 --> 2:32:04.780]  It's super silver skin cream.
[2:32:04.780 --> 2:32:08.780]  It's got all of these benefits too many to mention, but it's revolutionary.
[2:32:08.780 --> 2:32:09.780]  It's brand new.
[2:32:09.780 --> 2:32:10.780]  People are going to love it.

[2:32:13.780 --> 2:32:17.780]  The new super silver skin cream is the best of both worlds.
[2:32:17.780 --> 2:32:19.780]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.
[2:32:19.780 --> 2:32:23.780]  Super silver skin cream is infused with patented silver salt technology.
[2:32:23.780 --> 2:32:28.780]  It's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.
[2:32:28.780 --> 2:32:31.780]  It's also loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin.

[2:33:18.780 --> 2:33:35.780]  This is CNN.
[2:33:35.780 --> 2:33:37.780]  Do you ban plastic straws?
[2:33:37.780 --> 2:33:38.780]  I think we should.
[2:33:38.780 --> 2:33:39.780]  Yes.
[2:33:39.780 --> 2:33:40.780]  I mean look, I'm going to be honest.
[2:33:40.780 --> 2:33:43.780]  It's really difficult to drink out of a paper straw when you had it.
[2:33:43.780 --> 2:33:47.780]  If you don't gulp it down immediately it starts to bend.
[2:33:47.780 --> 2:34:06.780]  These are just some of the amazing memes at memeworld.com.
[2:34:06.780 --> 2:34:09.780]  So you've got to kind of perfect that one a little bit more.
[2:34:09.780 --> 2:34:11.780]  Whatever you do though.
[2:34:11.780 --> 2:34:14.780]  Don't share memeworld.com on Facebook or whatever you do.
[2:34:14.780 --> 2:34:15.780]  It's a process.
[2:34:15.780 --> 2:34:16.780]  Don't email it.
[2:34:16.780 --> 2:34:18.780]  You certainly don't visit it.
[2:34:18.780 --> 2:34:19.780]  Memeworld.com.
[2:34:19.780 --> 2:34:25.780]  Some of the great work that Carpe Dantum is doing with so many other great people like
[2:34:25.780 --> 2:34:27.780]  Ben Garrison and so many others.
[2:34:27.780 --> 2:34:29.780]  Be sure and check it out today.
[2:34:29.780 --> 2:34:30.780]  Memeworld.com.
[2:34:30.780 --> 2:34:34.780]  Again, I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com.
[2:34:34.780 --> 2:34:38.780]  And I want to get into Google faces new antitrust probe by 50 attorney generals.
[2:34:38.780 --> 2:34:39.780]  Told you that was coming.
[2:34:39.780 --> 2:34:41.780]  They already filed a bunch of stuff last week.
[2:34:41.780 --> 2:34:42.780]  Now all 50 of them this week.
[2:34:42.780 --> 2:34:46.780]  But there's more than one way to roast a goose or skin a cat.
[2:34:46.780 --> 2:34:50.780]  They've already committed so many crimes, so much spying, so much illegal surveillance
[2:34:50.780 --> 2:34:52.780]  that if Trump wants to take action he can.
[2:34:52.780 --> 2:34:53.780]  Why hasn't he?
[2:34:53.780 --> 2:34:55.780]  We'll talk about that with constitutional lawyer.
[2:34:55.780 --> 2:34:57.780]  One of the top first amendment criminal lawyers in the country.
[2:34:57.780 --> 2:35:00.780]  Norm Pattis is here with us right now.
[2:35:00.780 --> 2:35:05.780]  But getting into something that's really scary but at the same time fun.
[2:35:05.780 --> 2:35:12.780]  Here's a short clip of a short statement by Dave Chappelle from his comedy special that
[2:35:12.780 --> 2:35:17.780]  the left is called to be removed off Netflix and that Rotten Tomatoes gave a zero.
[2:35:17.780 --> 2:35:20.780]  They only let a few people vote on it.
[2:35:20.780 --> 2:35:24.780]  And now it's backfired because exactly what Dave Chappelle says the left's doing, they're doing.
[2:35:24.780 --> 2:35:25.780]  Here it is.
[2:35:25.780 --> 2:35:28.780]  What we should be doing is shunning these people.
[2:35:28.780 --> 2:35:33.780]  Shunning, shaming these people is a statement of moral indignation that these people are
[2:35:33.780 --> 2:35:35.780]  not fit for polite society.
[2:35:35.780 --> 2:35:39.780]  I'm going to try to take everything away from you and I don't care what I find out.
[2:35:39.780 --> 2:35:42.780]  It could be today, tomorrow, 15, 20 years from now.
[2:35:42.780 --> 2:35:45.780]  If I find out, you're f***ing finished.
[2:35:45.780 --> 2:35:47.780]  They don't get to escape accountability.
[2:35:47.780 --> 2:35:51.780]  That's all of our job to hold them accountable for the rest of their lives.
[2:35:51.780 --> 2:35:53.780]  It's so entertaining.
[2:35:53.780 --> 2:35:57.780]  To make sure we don't eat meat and to make sure we don't use straws.
[2:35:57.780 --> 2:36:01.780]  But oh, the human cloning is okay and the genetic engineering and the weather modification
[2:36:01.780 --> 2:36:03.780]  and all of that's real.
[2:36:03.780 --> 2:36:09.780]  And Pat, I want to play a clip from Joe Rogan's show last week talking about this.
[2:36:09.780 --> 2:36:10.780]  I actually heard of it.
[2:36:10.780 --> 2:36:11.780]  He said, oh yeah, I saw it.
[2:36:11.780 --> 2:36:12.780]  He said it was going to cover it.
[2:36:12.780 --> 2:36:13.780]  Well, he did.
[2:36:13.780 --> 2:36:15.780]  He did cover it.
[2:36:15.780 --> 2:36:18.780]  And he's friends with Dave Chappelle.
[2:36:18.780 --> 2:36:19.780]  But there's Dave Chappelle.
[2:36:19.780 --> 2:36:21.780]  I've watched his special.
[2:36:21.780 --> 2:36:24.780]  Pretty liberal, pretty leftist, pretty divide and conquer still.
[2:36:24.780 --> 2:36:25.780]  He had all the points.
[2:36:25.780 --> 2:36:28.780]  But he said the left should allow the First Amendment.
[2:36:28.780 --> 2:36:30.780]  He said Jesse Smollett was a scammer.
[2:36:30.780 --> 2:36:31.780]  Did a really funny bet on that.
[2:36:31.780 --> 2:36:35.780]  So they only allowed a handful of Raiders on Rotten Tomatoes to rate it.
[2:36:35.780 --> 2:36:36.780]  And the Rotten Tomatoes is already known.
[2:36:36.780 --> 2:36:38.780]  You pay them, they rig the votes.
[2:36:38.780 --> 2:36:41.780]  It's fake, fake reviews.
[2:36:41.780 --> 2:36:43.780]  But they didn't want that obvious.
[2:36:43.780 --> 2:36:51.780]  So they removed the ability for people to vote and only let their critics a handful of them do it.
[2:36:51.780 --> 2:36:52.780]  Well, that backfired.
[2:36:52.780 --> 2:36:57.780]  So they opened it up and Chappelle got 99% positive.
[2:36:57.780 --> 2:37:01.780]  And they opened it up to other reviewers that got 23% for the reviewers.
[2:37:01.780 --> 2:37:06.780]  So it shows how they create these echo chambers and want to bully even Dave Chappelle.
[2:37:06.780 --> 2:37:11.780]  And now they're boycotting his comedy tour saying it's white supremacist.
[2:37:11.780 --> 2:37:13.780]  We're going to play Joe talking about that in a moment.
[2:37:13.780 --> 2:37:17.780]  But this just shows how they just want to exercise power.
[2:37:17.780 --> 2:37:19.780]  The left has become purely authoritarian.
[2:37:19.780 --> 2:37:23.780]  In a frightening kind of way, left fascism.
[2:37:23.780 --> 2:37:28.780]  And if you don't march, if your boots don't strike the pavement with the right cadence, you ain't walking.
[2:37:28.780 --> 2:37:30.780]  And that seems to be the message.
[2:37:30.780 --> 2:37:32.780]  Chappelle is a white supremacist.
[2:37:32.780 --> 2:37:33.780]  I missed that one.
[2:37:33.780 --> 2:37:34.780]  They actually said that.
[2:37:34.780 --> 2:37:35.780]  Wow.
[2:37:35.780 --> 2:37:37.780]  Well, you know, I live in the shadow of Yale.
[2:37:37.780 --> 2:37:39.780]  That's where our law office is across the street from it.
[2:37:39.780 --> 2:37:41.780]  And it is an unctuous group.
[2:37:41.780 --> 2:37:44.780]  Periodically, they'll go after professors, they'll go after students.
[2:37:44.780 --> 2:37:48.780]  We're getting ready to file a lawsuit, however, on behalf of Dr. Michael Simons,
[2:37:48.780 --> 2:37:56.780]  a world-renowned cardiologist who once had an affection for a young woman, a colleague.
[2:37:56.780 --> 2:37:57.780]  He sent her notes.
[2:37:57.780 --> 2:37:58.780]  She said she wasn't interested.
[2:37:58.780 --> 2:38:00.780]  He was suspended briefly.
[2:38:00.780 --> 2:38:01.780]  He did his time.
[2:38:01.780 --> 2:38:03.780]  He lost a position for a while.
[2:38:03.780 --> 2:38:04.780]  Then he came back.
[2:38:04.780 --> 2:38:06.780]  He was chair of the cardiology department.
[2:38:06.780 --> 2:38:08.780]  He held a major chair.
[2:38:08.780 --> 2:38:10.780]  He received recognition throughout the world.
[2:38:10.780 --> 2:38:14.780]  Yale demoted him when somebody leaked that story to the New York Times.
[2:38:14.780 --> 2:38:15.780]  Why?
[2:38:15.780 --> 2:38:17.780]  He'd already done his time.
[2:38:17.780 --> 2:38:18.780]  That's like punishing somebody.
[2:38:18.780 --> 2:38:21.780]  It's all about just raw exercise of power and creating a stampede.
[2:38:21.780 --> 2:38:22.780]  Absolutely.
[2:38:22.780 --> 2:38:26.780]  And we can't feel good enough about victims these days.
[2:38:26.780 --> 2:38:30.780]  Aristotle in the rhetoric said there were three ways to motivate people.
[2:38:30.780 --> 2:38:31.780]  Appeals to reason.
[2:38:31.780 --> 2:38:32.780]  Appeals to character.
[2:38:32.780 --> 2:38:35.780]  Appeals to pathos or pity.
[2:38:35.780 --> 2:38:37.780]  We don't have things that we agree about anymore.
[2:38:37.780 --> 2:38:39.780]  Society has broken down.
[2:38:39.780 --> 2:38:41.780]  You can't make common appeals to reason.
[2:38:41.780 --> 2:38:42.780]  We don't respect character.
[2:38:42.780 --> 2:38:43.780]  We like celebrities.
[2:38:43.780 --> 2:38:45.780]  So all that's left is pathos.
[2:38:45.780 --> 2:38:49.780]  And everybody's got to be a victim, which is Oprah's popularity, I suppose.
[2:38:49.780 --> 2:38:51.780]  Oh, she's a sickening person.
[2:38:51.780 --> 2:38:53.780]  Well, there is that.
[2:38:53.780 --> 2:38:56.780]  Is she a white supremacist, too, by the way?
[2:38:56.780 --> 2:38:58.780]  Actually, she is.
[2:38:58.780 --> 2:38:59.780]  She's a eugenicist.
[2:38:59.780 --> 2:39:05.780]  She's part of this secret Jeffrey Epstein eugenics guild with David Rockefeller and all these guys.
[2:39:05.780 --> 2:39:06.780]  I'm serious.
[2:39:06.780 --> 2:39:08.780]  You've mentioned this before, but think about it.
[2:39:08.780 --> 2:39:11.780]  We now have the ability to identify all the pairings in the human genome.
[2:39:11.780 --> 2:39:17.780]  And we're zeroing in or honing in on the various genes that make us what we are.
[2:39:17.780 --> 2:39:20.780]  We can find now how to enhance intelligence, how to eliminate certain illnesses.
[2:39:20.780 --> 2:39:22.780]  If you can do it, shouldn't you do it?
[2:39:22.780 --> 2:39:24.780]  That seems to be the argument among some.
[2:39:24.780 --> 2:39:26.780]  So let's make a better race of human beings.
[2:39:26.780 --> 2:39:32.780]  The problem is there'll only be a few people that have access to the wealth and technology to produce that, leaving the rest of the family.
[2:39:32.780 --> 2:39:33.780]  Plus, it's always backdoors.
[2:39:33.780 --> 2:39:36.780]  They're not going to give the general public the real stuff.
[2:39:36.780 --> 2:39:38.780]  And that's why you already see them last week.
[2:39:38.780 --> 2:39:42.780]  All the billionaire took the other and said, we're going to build a new home on the moon for us.
[2:39:42.780 --> 2:39:44.780]  Well, there will be a breakaway civilization.
[2:39:44.780 --> 2:39:45.780]  A breakaway civilization.
[2:39:45.780 --> 2:39:48.780]  And we are left to be in effect the digital slaves.
[2:39:48.780 --> 2:39:49.780]  It's terrifying.
[2:39:49.780 --> 2:39:55.780]  And I think that the Bill of Rights was what we started talking about, talked about giving power to the people.
[2:39:55.780 --> 2:39:58.780]  And one amendment we haven't talked about yet is the Ninth Amendment.
[2:39:58.780 --> 2:40:02.780]  The Ninth Amendment says all the power that's not given to the government, the people retain.
[2:40:02.780 --> 2:40:04.780]  Have we retained anything anymore?
[2:40:04.780 --> 2:40:07.780]  Do we have the ability to take back power in our own name?
[2:40:07.780 --> 2:40:10.780]  I think we might find out in 2020 and beyond.
[2:40:10.780 --> 2:40:11.780]  Absolutely.
[2:40:11.780 --> 2:40:14.780]  And, you know, I have some real issues with Trump.
[2:40:14.780 --> 2:40:17.780]  But I just think about what would it be like when Hillary...
[2:40:17.780 --> 2:40:19.780]  But here's the problem.
[2:40:19.780 --> 2:40:24.780]  Trump knows that Big Tech's already stole the house in the midterm.
[2:40:24.780 --> 2:40:29.780]  And we've seen with all the experts and all the facts that's come out and Big Tech's been caught bragging how they did it.
[2:40:29.780 --> 2:40:30.780]  He's doing nothing.
[2:40:30.780 --> 2:40:34.780]  And the attorney generals of the states are taking action.
[2:40:34.780 --> 2:40:39.780]  But we'll talk about this next segment, but it's not enough just to antitrust the amount of illegal data,
[2:40:39.780 --> 2:40:45.780]  the amount of lying to Congress, the way they work with other big corporations in cartels.
[2:40:45.780 --> 2:40:48.780]  This would be illegal anytime in the past.
[2:40:48.780 --> 2:40:51.780]  I mean, we broke up Microsoft just because they were too big.
[2:40:51.780 --> 2:40:53.780]  Not to mention they were messing with elections.
[2:40:53.780 --> 2:40:55.780]  No, they weren't doing that.
[2:40:55.780 --> 2:40:58.780]  So the fact that this has happened is just out of control.
[2:40:58.780 --> 2:40:59.780]  Well, I think you look...
[2:40:59.780 --> 2:41:02.780]  To me, if you look at what's going on in England and the Brexit debate,
[2:41:02.780 --> 2:41:06.780]  they're a little bit ahead of us in terms of their sense of social disintegration.
[2:41:06.780 --> 2:41:10.780]  They know they don't want to be part of the globalist structure and they want their autonomy back,
[2:41:10.780 --> 2:41:12.780]  but they want to have their cake and they want to eat it too.
[2:41:12.780 --> 2:41:17.780]  They want autonomy and they want the ease that comes of maximum global efficiencies.
[2:41:17.780 --> 2:41:19.780]  You can't have it both ways.
[2:41:19.780 --> 2:41:24.780]  And it seems to me that the political rhetoric, the way we talk about politics or legitimize authority in the country,
[2:41:24.780 --> 2:41:27.780]  is ended and we need new voices.
[2:41:27.780 --> 2:41:32.780]  When I look at the current field of candidates and candidly, I hope I don't offend you, Alex, that includes Donald Trump,
[2:41:32.780 --> 2:41:36.780]  I feel like I'm looking at Tweedledee and Tweedledum at a tap dancing conference.
[2:41:36.780 --> 2:41:39.780]  There's just nothing there that I want to do anything other than laugh at.
[2:41:39.780 --> 2:41:41.780]  I am not interested in these candidates.
[2:41:41.780 --> 2:41:43.780]  I'm interested in the quality of life that I live.
[2:41:43.780 --> 2:41:47.780]  I'm interested in good homes and education for my family, roads that work,
[2:41:47.780 --> 2:41:50.780]  a government that I can trust with limited powers and people.
[2:41:50.780 --> 2:41:54.780]  I'm telling you what's very exciting is there's big studies out that not just white people,
[2:41:54.780 --> 2:41:59.780]  but educated people and hard-working craftsmen and people are fleeing the cities
[2:41:59.780 --> 2:42:04.780]  and creating all these new little small towns and cities where people are rejecting all the computers,
[2:42:04.780 --> 2:42:07.780]  all the, I mean, they're not troglodytes either.
[2:42:07.780 --> 2:42:10.780]  There's just a major movement away from this culture of death.
[2:42:10.780 --> 2:42:15.780]  Anthropologists say that we're wired to care for a community of about 150 people.
[2:42:15.780 --> 2:42:17.780]  That's how we came up.
[2:42:17.780 --> 2:42:19.780]  We're a relatively new species.
[2:42:19.780 --> 2:42:22.780]  Our technology has exploded so much quicker than we can adapt to it.
[2:42:22.780 --> 2:42:25.780]  I think that that is an adaptive move.
[2:42:25.780 --> 2:42:26.780]  To run from it?
[2:42:26.780 --> 2:42:29.780]  To run from it, absolutely. I don't think we have any choice.
[2:42:29.780 --> 2:42:36.780]  Well, the establishment is all, all these big tech heads are running to Kauai and Tasmania and New Zealand.
[2:42:36.780 --> 2:42:37.780]  They're all running.
[2:42:37.780 --> 2:42:41.780]  Well, we've got to find a way to disrupt them where we live, not where they're running to.
[2:42:41.780 --> 2:42:43.780]  I was about to say, they set something up that's killing us.
[2:42:43.780 --> 2:42:44.780]  Right.
[2:42:44.780 --> 2:42:46.780]  And then they run from it. Like you said, their kids aren't allowed to use it.
[2:42:46.780 --> 2:42:47.780]  Does that tell you something, love?
[2:42:47.780 --> 2:42:48.780]  Unplug.
[2:42:48.780 --> 2:42:53.780]  Run, run, run to the hills. Like the Bible says in Revelation, run.
[2:42:53.780 --> 2:42:55.780]  In Ford's life philosophy is very, very simple.
[2:42:55.780 --> 2:43:00.780]  That's why it's been so successful and helped fund this revolution against the globalists. Thanks for your support.
[2:43:00.780 --> 2:43:06.780]  We go out and look at the industry of mother nature's bounty, what the FDA calls supplements.
[2:43:06.780 --> 2:43:12.780]  And we look at what is the best selling, what's the highest rated, what people are saying they like the best.
[2:43:12.780 --> 2:43:17.780]  And then we go and make it even better with top manufacturers around the United States.
[2:43:17.780 --> 2:43:20.780]  We made the strongest, most concentrated bone broth.
[2:43:20.780 --> 2:43:25.780]  You can find ultimate bone broth at infowarslife.com.
[2:43:25.780 --> 2:43:35.780]  Other leading competitors are $45, $50 or stuff that has hardly any bone broth in it is $19.95.

[2:45:12.780 --> 2:45:17.780]  One is naturally set up with grapefruit essential oils. The other is unscented.
[2:45:17.780 --> 2:45:22.780]  It's got hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, essential oils from grapefruit.
[2:45:22.780 --> 2:45:25.780]  It's got coconut oil and so much more.
[2:45:25.780 --> 2:45:31.780]  And this patented nano type of silver that has been proven to be the most effective and the best.
[2:45:31.780 --> 2:45:37.780]  It's got all these other great vitamins and compounds that are known to be wonderful for your skin.

[2:45:57.780 --> 2:46:03.780]  because we're selling out of the free bottle of carnivore digestive enzyme we give you with each purchase.
[2:46:03.780 --> 2:46:07.780]  Listers agree DNA Force Plus is one of the best formulas ever from infowarslife.com.

[2:46:20.780 --> 2:46:25.780]  PQQ, over 1,000 studies have been published on its health benefits from enhancement in short-term memory
[2:46:25.780 --> 2:46:27.780]  to improve energy and metabolism.
[2:46:27.780 --> 2:46:31.780]  Cordyceps sinensis, it is thought to be one of the most powerful adaptogens available.

[2:47:22.780 --> 2:47:28.780]  And now, we're carrying a show that he's launching Firepower with Will Johnson.
[2:47:28.780 --> 2:47:35.780]  It's about who's on fire, who is getting fired, and he's going to have a lot of big guests.
[2:47:35.780 --> 2:47:41.780]  Tom Papert's going to be co-hosting with him, and he's going to have a lot of exciting things with the show.
[2:47:41.780 --> 2:47:45.780]  He's going to go on the road some, and so we already was doing the show.
[2:47:45.780 --> 2:47:48.780]  We encouraged him. We're working with him and helping him out, but it's his show.
[2:47:48.780 --> 2:47:53.780]  He is an independent program. Firepower tonight, 7 o'clock since we're a little kickoff.
[2:47:53.780 --> 2:47:57.780]  I haven't decided if I'm going to Houston yet. I'm so busy, but our crew is going to be down there.
[2:47:57.780 --> 2:48:01.780]  Millie Weaver, Caitlin Bennett, some of the crew from here, Owen Schreuer.
[2:48:01.780 --> 2:48:05.780]  We need somebody here to run the show and be in studio for the one night debate.
[2:48:05.780 --> 2:48:08.780]  What is it this Thursday? We have all 10 of the candidates up there.
[2:48:08.780 --> 2:48:12.780]  We're going to be here covering it live. I'll probably go to Houston. I'm not sure yet.
[2:48:12.780 --> 2:48:18.780]  But speaking of firepower, here's a little one minute piece, laying it out.
[2:48:43.780 --> 2:48:45.780]  I appreciate you.
[2:48:45.780 --> 2:48:48.780]  If she's not your president, then you're an illegal resident.
[2:48:48.780 --> 2:48:54.780]  If you're pro-Americans, you're pro-Trump, then that goes against their community standards.
[2:48:54.780 --> 2:48:58.780]  I like triggering liquor, and I like triggering them with facts.
[2:48:58.780 --> 2:49:02.780]  I mean, I'm serious. You know, it's becoming an issue.
[2:49:02.780 --> 2:49:06.780]  Why do you put illegals ahead of Americans time to go?
[2:49:06.780 --> 2:49:08.780]  Don't touch me. Don't touch me.
[2:49:08.780 --> 2:49:12.780]  Because you have some idiot that went out there and did this horrific crime.
[2:49:12.780 --> 2:49:17.780]  Doesn't mean law-abiding citizens should be penalized for it.
[2:49:26.780 --> 2:49:31.780]  That's right. And they also have firepower.com, or is it firepowernews.com?
[2:49:31.780 --> 2:49:35.780]  I know he launched that site. You guys, give me that URL. We'll put that on screen.
[2:49:35.780 --> 2:49:39.780]  Thanks a lot. I'll just put it on screen for me.
[2:49:39.780 --> 2:49:43.780]  You guys got your mics jacked up. They're distorted, so I'll just put it on screen for me. Thanks.
[2:49:43.780 --> 2:49:48.780]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[2:49:48.780 --> 2:49:54.780]  Hey Alex, tell me more about band.video. That's the most exciting thing I've seen in a while. I was delighted to hear about that.
[2:49:54.780 --> 2:49:59.780]  Well, it works on all devices real good. It works like an app. It's a first-rate site we've built.
[2:49:59.780 --> 2:50:04.780]  And the video streams really well. We're going to be adding audio, download streams, and things for people that don't have good bandwidth.
[2:50:04.780 --> 2:50:10.780]  And we've added Will Johnson, Paul Watson to it. We have a lot of original reports, special reports only there.
[2:50:10.780 --> 2:50:18.780]  And then with other trusted contributors, we're going to add hundreds of other people that can then upload to it, have a home.
[2:50:18.780 --> 2:50:22.780]  So when they're posting stuff on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, a lot of it gets taken down.
[2:50:22.780 --> 2:50:28.780]  They know there's a backup of it, but they can point it. So that's why we've launched band.video.
[2:50:28.780 --> 2:50:32.780]  Is it accessible from anywhere in the country? I mean, can I get it up in LibTard, Connecticut?
[2:50:32.780 --> 2:50:39.780]  Can I get it everywhere? All right. That's great news. Absolutely. And the website for Will Johnson, again, because he's running all this, he built all this, he's doing all this,
[2:50:39.780 --> 2:50:47.780]  firepowernews.com, firepowernews.com. Ladies and gentlemen, very, very exciting.
[2:50:47.780 --> 2:50:53.780]  So tell people about firepowernews.com tonight, 7 o'clock central. Again, we're going to put a lot of energy into this.
[2:50:53.780 --> 2:51:00.780]  I know he's put a lot of energy into it. And we're just here promoting it, just like I'm promoting clownworld.com, summit.news.
[2:51:00.780 --> 2:51:05.780]  I encouraged Paul Watson years ago. I said, start your own website, start your own group.
[2:51:05.780 --> 2:51:10.780]  I said, I'll try to help you finance it. Get some camera people, get some other writers. You need to break off to your own thing.
[2:51:10.780 --> 2:51:15.780]  And then necessity happened. I said, okay, Paul, I can't afford to pay anymore.
[2:51:15.780 --> 2:51:19.780]  And so you better go get a subscribe star. You better do all this. I'm going to promote you.
[2:51:19.780 --> 2:51:26.780]  And he's doing it now. And he's about to put an ad out to hire a few camera people, some reporters, some writers and set up an office in London.
[2:51:26.780 --> 2:51:32.780]  So this isn't a joke. I mean, I've given him some money to help do it, but I'm like, that's it, kid. Been here 18 years.
[2:51:32.780 --> 2:51:39.780]  I love him to death. And, you know, that's what you do is you got to pass the baton. We intend to still be here, but we're under massive sustained attack.
[2:51:39.780 --> 2:51:47.780]  And so it's really spurred me to try to help others, build other things. That's why capitalizing this operation is so absolutely critical.
[2:51:47.780 --> 2:51:52.780]  Get your brown profits selling out for the rest of the year at 50% off. That's amazing.
[2:51:52.780 --> 2:51:56.780]  Get your fish oil. We've got the best krill oil you name it. Get your turmeric. It's amazing.
[2:51:56.780 --> 2:52:04.780]  We've also are about to sell out a DNA force plus at 50% off. You're getting that free bottle of carnivore. That's got to end the day.
[2:52:04.780 --> 2:52:10.780]  So infowarstore.com or triple A 253-3139. But whatever you do, sign up for auto ship for things like the Lake of America coffee.
[2:52:10.780 --> 2:52:16.780]  If you like it, I think you will. Or for like the Flora Tree toothpaste, you do it every month, every three months, every up to nine months.
[2:52:16.780 --> 2:52:22.780]  Cancel anytime. It's free to cancel. That way you don't forget and you support us each month. And the toothpaste comes.
[2:52:22.780 --> 2:52:29.780]  The fish oil comes. The turbo force comes. The brain force comes. Chill force is our new product. It's not a downer.
[2:52:29.780 --> 2:52:36.780]  But it's good when you've already been on a lot of natural stimulants or things like turbo force or brain force to kind of come off of or take it with it.
[2:52:36.780 --> 2:52:43.780]  I just cannot tell you how amazing chill force is. It's already got reviews at 100%. Just came out. Check it out today at infowarstore.com.
[2:52:43.780 --> 2:52:55.780]  Norm, getting back to what's happening. Google faces new antitrust probe by 50 state attorney generals looking how they've shut down markets, bought up all their competition.
[2:52:55.780 --> 2:53:01.780]  I think that's a good way to go after them, but it'll take too long. We need federal antitrust. Trump's been promising to do.
[2:53:01.780 --> 2:53:10.780]  And we also need to look at how all the illegal practices, the spying, the recording people in their homes, the selling the data, the following your location, even when you turn it off,
[2:53:10.780 --> 2:53:17.780]  the lying to Congress, the working with the Communist Chinese, putting people in gulags, doing all of this.
[2:53:17.780 --> 2:53:25.780]  We have to go after them. As Professor Robert Epstein has documented, they already stole the 2018 election.
[2:53:25.780 --> 2:53:32.780]  We should, and I don't know if we will. One of the problems with the law is that the First Amendment protects us against government action, not private action.
[2:53:32.780 --> 2:53:37.780]  But Google has become more powerful than the government, and it's an ally of the governments.
[2:53:37.780 --> 2:53:42.780]  So my view is we need to bring actions. If Congress won't do it, then let's bring these actions in court.
[2:53:42.780 --> 2:53:49.780]  Let's begin to challenge these as quasi-governmental entities behaving in a monopolistic fashion to the derogation of our rights.
[2:53:49.780 --> 2:53:57.780]  If Google is spying on me on my home, that is, and giving the information to the government, that is no less offensive to me than if the government did it itself.
[2:53:57.780 --> 2:54:06.780]  And here's a fact that many people don't know. If you look at the terms of service for Facebook, Facebook will respond to a subpoena from a prosecutor for information,
[2:54:06.780 --> 2:54:11.780]  but it will not respond to a subpoena from a defense lawyer for information.
[2:54:11.780 --> 2:54:16.780]  So not too many years ago, a judge issued an order for Facebook to produce something in a case of mine.
[2:54:16.780 --> 2:54:21.780]  I'm not sure how she was persuaded to do it, but she did. We did a subpoena to Facebook.
[2:54:21.780 --> 2:54:25.780]  They ignored the subpoena because they ignore the subpoenas of defense lawyers.
[2:54:25.780 --> 2:54:29.780]  They ignore the people while taking the people's money. We saw this order.
[2:54:29.780 --> 2:54:30.780]  That is extremely authoritarian.
[2:54:30.780 --> 2:54:32.780]  Listen, listen. It gets worse.
[2:54:32.780 --> 2:54:34.780]  And the default is for the state.
[2:54:34.780 --> 2:54:36.780]  And so we did what's called a capious warrant.
[2:54:36.780 --> 2:54:42.780]  We asked the judge for an arrest warrant for Zuckerberg, and we had it served on his home.
[2:54:42.780 --> 2:54:44.780]  We couldn't get at him. He's got too much security.
[2:54:44.780 --> 2:54:46.780]  And we tried to force the issue.
[2:54:46.780 --> 2:54:49.780]  I wanted Zuckerberg brought the court in chains.
[2:54:49.780 --> 2:54:52.780]  You're going to take my data. You're going to sell my data.
[2:54:52.780 --> 2:54:54.780]  You're going to use my data to make money.
[2:54:54.780 --> 2:54:59.780]  You're going to use my data with the government's permission and consent to attack my liberty,
[2:54:59.780 --> 2:55:02.780]  but you're not going to let me use what you take for me to defend myself.
[2:55:02.780 --> 2:55:06.780]  As far as I was concerned, that was a watershed moment.
[2:55:06.780 --> 2:55:11.780]  I crossed over to the other side on the digital divide, and I decided I am with the people
[2:55:11.780 --> 2:55:14.780]  every time and Zuckerberg is a public enemy.
[2:55:14.780 --> 2:55:17.780]  Oh, they're definitely above the law, and they engage in all this crime.
[2:55:17.780 --> 2:55:23.780]  And he called his users. He says, my users trust me, dumb efforts in an email to his colleagues.
[2:55:23.780 --> 2:55:24.780]  So here's the thing.
[2:55:24.780 --> 2:55:25.780]  He's laughing all the way.
[2:55:25.780 --> 2:55:27.780]  I am going to follow some lawsuits this week.
[2:55:27.780 --> 2:55:29.780]  You've been wanting me to do one against Facebook.
[2:55:29.780 --> 2:55:33.780]  And I understand there's a lot of cost and things going on, and you said you'd do it at cost.
[2:55:33.780 --> 2:55:37.780]  And we're going to try to launch some type of fundraiser because somebody's got to go on the offense here,
[2:55:37.780 --> 2:55:39.780]  and we've been wrong more than anybody.
[2:55:39.780 --> 2:55:41.780]  You think we have a pretty strong case.
[2:55:41.780 --> 2:55:44.780]  But really, it's big tech's race to the finish line.
[2:55:44.780 --> 2:55:48.780]  And government's being fooled, too, to give it all this power by working with it.
[2:55:48.780 --> 2:55:53.780]  You can see the AI taking everything over, and that big tech's already bigger than most governments.
[2:55:53.780 --> 2:55:56.780]  Things are totally out of whack, totally cattywampus.
[2:55:56.780 --> 2:56:00.780]  How much do you think it would cost to really prosecute this suit against Facebook?
[2:56:00.780 --> 2:56:09.780]  Well, you know, I will do it without legal fees for as long as I am able to because it is the right thing to do.
[2:56:09.780 --> 2:56:11.780]  I've been trying to get you to do it. I think you've thought about it.
[2:56:11.780 --> 2:56:13.780]  Okay, fine. Well, let's do it. Let's follow the suit.
[2:56:13.780 --> 2:56:15.780]  I mean, Barnes is getting here tomorrow. We're doing some suits.
[2:56:15.780 --> 2:56:19.780]  I know you guys are right up there at the top, so I want to fight back.
[2:56:19.780 --> 2:56:22.780]  That's great because I've got a suit in my briefcase.
[2:56:22.780 --> 2:56:26.780]  It's in the conference room, and when the show is done, I'll show it to you.
[2:56:26.780 --> 2:56:30.780]  I've shown it to you before. It needs to be filed in the Western District of Texas. Let's get it on.
[2:56:30.780 --> 2:56:32.780]  Now, I don't know if you'll succeed, okay?
[2:56:32.780 --> 2:56:36.780]  I don't know if you'll succeed anymore that when that T was thrown over in Boston Harbor,
[2:56:36.780 --> 2:56:38.780]  it changed British attitudes.
[2:56:38.780 --> 2:56:41.780]  But a fight has to start somewhere, and this is a line in the sand.
[2:56:41.780 --> 2:56:45.780]  These SOBs hurt you. They hurt your listeners. They hurt the American people.
[2:56:45.780 --> 2:56:48.780]  Well, now they're saying you can't say my name unless it's negative.
[2:56:48.780 --> 2:56:52.780]  That's like a cult. You will not say the name unless it's negative.
[2:56:52.780 --> 2:56:54.780]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[2:56:54.780 --> 2:56:57.780]  Remember the line, who is John Galt from the Ann Rand novels?
[2:56:57.780 --> 2:56:58.780]  Yes.
[2:56:58.780 --> 2:57:01.780]  I think we should now have a new motto in the restroom.
[2:57:01.780 --> 2:57:03.780]  Who the hell is Zuckerberg?
[2:57:03.780 --> 2:57:07.780]  I'd like to go into a restroom and see that scrawled everywhere. Who the hell is Zuckerberg?
[2:57:07.780 --> 2:57:10.780]  Are you watching this, Mark, when I'm standing at the urinal?
[2:57:10.780 --> 2:57:15.780]  And rather than peeing on the fly that they put in urinals, why not put a little MZ in there?
[2:57:15.780 --> 2:57:18.780]  Let's take the word of that.
[2:57:18.780 --> 2:57:22.780]  Well, I don't even want him to get, I'd like it to be who's Alex Jones, or why can't you use who is Alex Jones written?
[2:57:22.780 --> 2:57:23.780]  All right, that works.
[2:57:23.780 --> 2:57:26.780]  Well, no, of course, that thing gets me to hear the truth of what's going on.
[2:57:26.780 --> 2:57:29.780]  I thought of some offensive stuff like that, but I really support private property.
[2:57:29.780 --> 2:57:32.780]  But I got to tell you, folks, however you get the word out, Zuckerberg says,
[2:57:32.780 --> 2:57:35.780]  don't say my name in a positive light, don't promote info wars.
[2:57:35.780 --> 2:57:38.780]  You're going to let that little chicken neck piece of crap hide down with his family in Hawaii.
[2:57:38.780 --> 2:57:43.780]  Life destroys the world, happens right with you. That's an exciting fact.
[2:57:43.780 --> 2:57:45.780]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:57:45.780 --> 2:57:49.780]  Alex, God bless you. I have an idea for a new info wars t-shirt.
[2:57:49.780 --> 2:57:52.780]  Instead of this is your brain. This is your brain on drugs.
[2:57:52.780 --> 2:57:55.780]  This is your brain. This is your brain on 5G.
[2:57:55.780 --> 2:57:56.780]  Oh, yeah.
[2:57:56.780 --> 2:57:57.780]  Showing your brain, getting fried.
[2:57:57.780 --> 2:57:59.780]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[2:57:59.780 --> 2:58:00.780]  Totally changed my life.
[2:58:00.780 --> 2:58:05.780]  I use turbo force, bodies, album power, brain force, fish oil, ultra 12 daily.
[2:58:05.780 --> 2:58:06.780]  X2 every several days.
[2:58:06.780 --> 2:58:12.780]  Now, what I've found is, is really combining them is totally synergistic and transcendent
[2:58:12.780 --> 2:58:14.780]  feeling that I get by combining all your products.
[2:58:14.780 --> 2:58:16.780]  And I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them.
[2:58:16.780 --> 2:58:17.780]  I just want to say, why not?
[2:58:17.780 --> 2:58:20.780]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible,
[2:58:20.780 --> 2:58:23.780]  whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil,
[2:58:23.780 --> 2:58:27.780]  or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[2:58:27.780 --> 2:58:30.780]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[2:58:30.780 --> 2:58:33.780]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[2:58:33.780 --> 2:58:35.780]  Now you can build the big strong temple.
[2:58:35.780 --> 2:58:37.780]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them,
[2:58:37.780 --> 2:58:39.780]  it makes my life so much better.
[2:58:39.780 --> 2:58:41.780]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[2:58:41.780 --> 2:58:43.780]  Thank you so much. God bless you.
[2:59:11.780 --> 2:59:33.780]  We have to keep winning. We have to win more.
[2:59:33.780 --> 2:59:44.780]  Go to InfowarsStore.com.
[3:00:04.780 --> 3:00:08.780]  Okay, so I mentioned, we'll take a few segments,
[3:00:08.780 --> 3:00:11.780]  and then the great Joe Salante is taking over.
[3:00:11.780 --> 3:00:13.780]  Our pass is here with us.
[3:00:13.780 --> 3:00:15.780]  He's a constitutional lawyer.
[3:00:15.780 --> 3:00:17.780]  One of my great lawyers.
[3:00:17.780 --> 3:00:20.780]  Professor Epstein is right. He's proven.
[3:00:20.780 --> 3:00:22.780]  Google brags internal videos. They can steal elections.
[3:00:22.780 --> 3:00:23.780]  They can fix things.
[3:00:23.780 --> 3:00:26.780]  Russia has banned Google doing push notifications
[3:00:26.780 --> 3:00:28.780]  for three days before their upcoming election
[3:00:28.780 --> 3:00:32.780]  because they've caught them only doing it to certain candidates.
[3:00:32.780 --> 3:00:34.780]  Well, that's what Epstein's already caught him doing.
[3:00:34.780 --> 3:00:41.780]  Let's go ahead and play part of him when he visited Mr. Levin on Fox News.
[3:00:41.780 --> 3:00:44.780]  What happened in 2016, the presidential election?
[3:00:44.780 --> 3:00:51.780]  In 2016, I set up the first ever monitoring system
[3:00:51.780 --> 3:00:57.780]  that allowed me to look over the shoulders of a diverse group of American voters.
[3:00:57.780 --> 3:01:00.780]  There were 95 people in 24 states.
[3:01:00.780 --> 3:01:05.780]  I looked at politically oriented searches
[3:01:05.780 --> 3:01:09.780]  that these people were conducting on Google Bing and Yahoo.
[3:01:09.780 --> 3:01:15.780]  I was able to preserve more than 13,000 searches and 98,000 web pages.
[3:01:15.780 --> 3:01:22.780]  And I found very dramatic bias in Google search results,
[3:01:22.780 --> 3:01:26.780]  not Bing or Yahoo, just Google's favoring Hillary Clinton,
[3:01:26.780 --> 3:01:33.780]  who I supported strongly, but the point is I reported what I found.
[3:01:33.780 --> 3:01:40.780]  That level of bias was sufficient, I calculated, to have shifted over time
[3:01:40.780 --> 3:01:48.780]  somewhere between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes to Hillary
[3:01:48.780 --> 3:01:51.780]  without anyone knowing that this had occurred.
[3:01:51.780 --> 3:01:56.780]  And so how does that get accomplished, these algorithms that are changed
[3:01:56.780 --> 3:02:02.780]  and adjusted and so forth, but to have that significant of an impact,
[3:02:02.780 --> 3:02:09.780]  obviously someone or something wants someone to win and someone to lose.
[3:02:09.780 --> 3:02:14.780]  For the person who goes on Google, how is that manifested?
[3:02:14.780 --> 3:02:19.780]  Well, if you go onto Google and you type in anything that's election related,
[3:02:19.780 --> 3:02:23.780]  and that could be hundreds of things, you type in immigration,
[3:02:23.780 --> 3:02:29.780]  or you type in the wall, or you think of all the things that are related to elections,
[3:02:29.780 --> 3:02:34.780]  the point is you end up with some search suggestions that are flashed at you as you're typing.
[3:02:34.780 --> 3:02:41.780]  We now know that those search suggestions have a very, very powerful effect on people
[3:02:41.780 --> 3:02:46.780]  and that they alone can shift opinions and votes dramatically.
[3:02:46.780 --> 3:02:52.780]  And then search results appear below, and the point is if there's a bias in them,
[3:02:52.780 --> 3:02:56.780]  which means if a search result that's high up on the list,
[3:02:56.780 --> 3:03:02.780]  if that takes you to a web page that makes one candidate look better than another,
[3:03:02.780 --> 3:03:07.780]  well, if you're undecided and you're trying to make up your mind,
[3:03:07.780 --> 3:03:13.780]  what we've learned is that information posted high in Google search results
[3:03:13.780 --> 3:03:18.780]  will shift opinions among undecided people dramatically
[3:03:18.780 --> 3:03:24.780]  because people trust Google and they especially trust high-ranking search results.
[3:03:24.780 --> 3:03:28.780]  That's why 50% of all clicks go to the top two items.
[3:03:28.780 --> 3:03:31.780]  Is that what Google did?
[3:03:31.780 --> 3:03:36.780]  Well, again, I can't say what Google did, but I can tell you what we found.
[3:03:36.780 --> 3:03:44.780]  We found a very dramatic pro-Hillary-Clinton bias on Google, but not the other search engines,
[3:03:44.780 --> 3:03:50.780]  and in all 10 search positions on the first page of search results.
[3:03:50.780 --> 3:03:52.780]  That's quite dramatic.
[3:03:52.780 --> 3:03:55.780]  And Google is rigging the search results admittedly.
[3:03:55.780 --> 3:03:57.780]  We have the internal videos. Anyone can see it.
[3:03:57.780 --> 3:04:00.780]  And before they were doing it some, now it's a broken search engine.
[3:04:00.780 --> 3:04:02.780]  It's all just rigged crap at the top.
[3:04:02.780 --> 3:04:04.780]  Wow, that's just stunning.
[3:04:04.780 --> 3:04:08.780]  I don't, you know, Google is the one social media thing that I continue to use,
[3:04:08.780 --> 3:04:10.780]  and watching that makes me feel like a monk.
[3:04:10.780 --> 3:04:14.780]  Being as somewhat rigged like Google used to be, being as Google four years ago,
[3:04:14.780 --> 3:04:19.780]  you understand, we search exact headlines to info wars, or to Breitbart,
[3:04:19.780 --> 3:04:23.780]  or to President Trump's statements, WhiteHouse.gov, they're all blocked, my friend.
[3:04:23.780 --> 3:04:25.780]  Nothing but negative lies are on top.
[3:04:25.780 --> 3:04:28.780]  Why we tolerate this is an open question.
[3:04:28.780 --> 3:04:29.780]  It's a mystery to me.
[3:04:29.780 --> 3:04:32.780]  And to me, that's why we probably wouldn't support this.
[3:04:32.780 --> 3:04:35.780]  Well, it used to, whatever was most popular, got driven to the top.
[3:04:35.780 --> 3:04:37.780]  And it was the knowledge of the crowd.
[3:04:37.780 --> 3:04:41.780]  It used to, if you typed in Alex Jones, it was the top link in force.
[3:04:41.780 --> 3:04:43.780]  Now it's down three pages.
[3:04:43.780 --> 3:04:45.780]  They're rigging everything.
[3:04:45.780 --> 3:04:47.780]  And then putting the lies on top.
[3:04:47.780 --> 3:05:13.780]  Go to YouTube, type my name, and it's nothing but hit pieces.
[3:05:17.780 --> 3:05:21.780]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones, or David Knight,
[3:05:21.780 --> 3:05:24.780]  or Owen Schreuer, or Paul Watson band videos.
[3:05:24.780 --> 3:05:28.780]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted.
[3:05:28.780 --> 3:05:33.780]  And where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home
[3:05:33.780 --> 3:05:36.780]  free from being shut down, free from being censored,
[3:05:36.780 --> 3:05:42.780]  free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum, and the globlest.
[3:05:42.780 --> 3:05:44.780]  Freedom of speech has a home.
[3:05:44.780 --> 3:05:46.780]  It's called band.video.
[3:05:46.780 --> 3:05:53.780]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[3:05:53.780 --> 3:06:16.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:06:16.780 --> 3:06:42.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:06:42.780 --> 3:07:08.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:07:08.780 --> 3:07:37.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:07:37.780 --> 3:07:59.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:07:59.780 --> 3:08:27.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:08:27.780 --> 3:08:53.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:08:53.780 --> 3:09:21.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:09:21.780 --> 3:09:49.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:09:49.780 --> 3:10:17.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:10:17.780 --> 3:10:45.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:10:45.780 --> 3:11:13.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:11:13.780 --> 3:11:41.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:11:41.780 --> 3:12:09.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:12:09.780 --> 3:12:35.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:12:35.780 --> 3:13:03.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
[3:13:03.780 --> 3:13:32.780]  How many times must I tell you baby?
