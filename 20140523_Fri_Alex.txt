[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.840 --> 00:19.380]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.380 --> 00:45.160]  Texas Alex Jones you know it's really amazing how politically correct and
[00:45.160 --> 00:49.920]  dumb down the mainstream media has become the old dinosaur media and the
[00:49.920 --> 00:57.080]  people that still subscribe to its twisted ideas mark Cuban who I think of
[00:57.080 --> 01:02.120]  as a guy with a lot of courage and somebody who I know is a libertarian
[01:02.120 --> 01:08.520]  at least in the closet because I've worked with him a little bit we're gonna
[01:08.520 --> 01:14.880]  play this tape coming up later came out as you know yesterday and said we're all
[01:14.880 --> 01:19.280]  bigots at at some level we all discriminate no matter what color you
[01:19.280 --> 01:24.840]  are it's going on and he said you know if I see somebody in a parking lot with
[01:24.840 --> 01:27.600]  a hoodie over their head even though I probably shouldn't think they're
[01:27.600 --> 01:31.320]  criminal criminals sometimes dressed like that I may walk the other side of
[01:31.320 --> 01:36.200]  the street but it doesn't mean I dislike people for their color I'm
[01:36.200 --> 01:43.080]  paraphrasing it's just that we've all got to admit that we discriminate well yeah
[01:43.080 --> 01:48.120]  I mean if a motorcycle gang pulls up around you and it's the hell's angels
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.560]  and they start making comments at you you're not discriminating against them
[01:52.560 --> 01:58.760]  in a bad way to think it might be good to get out of here so if you walk in a
[01:58.760 --> 02:08.600]  restaurant and it turns out to be a rough bar one time by the San Antonio Zoo
[02:08.600 --> 02:13.880]  we were hungry after we'd gone look like a nice restaurant we pulled in we go in
[02:13.880 --> 02:18.960]  we sit down and it was a gay pickup joint and I'm not against gay people but
[02:18.960 --> 02:22.400]  it was going on in there a bunch of drunk gay guys and he said you know what
[02:22.400 --> 02:27.440]  we got a bunch of small children we're gonna go and if that would have been a
[02:27.440 --> 02:33.880]  heterosexual meat market pickup joint we would have left I mean it's just it's
[02:33.880 --> 02:37.360]  kind of like if you're going on a vacation you take your kids to a family
[02:37.360 --> 02:43.320]  friendly resort you don't try to get them into what is it called sandals I
[02:43.320 --> 02:47.600]  guess that's an adult resort I've seen the ads on TV that's discrimination those
[02:47.600 --> 02:53.920]  places discriminate say we don't want kids here I wouldn't want to be part of
[02:53.920 --> 02:59.120]  a country club that was white only or black only but they got both and if
[02:59.120 --> 03:06.000]  people want to just be around that that's their issue so let's let's let's
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.720]  get it straight I grew up in Dallas Texas and had black friends I played
[03:11.720 --> 03:15.960]  football with and baseball with and a lot of times I would go over to their
[03:15.960 --> 03:19.280]  house and some of the black folks I knew lived in middle class affluent areas
[03:19.280 --> 03:23.360]  other ones lived in what you call the ghetto and my parents I guess were so
[03:23.360 --> 03:27.160]  what you'd call open mind at the time they'd say sure son let's spend the
[03:27.160 --> 03:33.400]  weekend with your black friend in the ghetto and I'd be there and black people
[03:33.400 --> 03:37.360]  come out of their houses and say I don't like cracker asses around here you get
[03:37.360 --> 03:40.520]  out of here I'm gonna kill you so needless to say I didn't go too many
[03:40.520 --> 03:46.240]  times he'll stay in the ghetto I was being discriminated against does that
[03:46.240 --> 03:56.400]  mean that I dislike black people no because I'm not gonna blame all black
[03:56.400 --> 04:00.720]  people because I have been around racist blacks and believe me I grew up in
[04:00.720 --> 04:05.360]  Dallas Texas folks I mean there are I'd probably say at least when I grew up
[04:05.360 --> 04:12.360]  20 30% of black folks are uber racist and I mean out in the open they don't
[04:12.360 --> 04:16.160]  hide it and they're proud of it I haven't lived in Dallas since I was 16 years
[04:16.160 --> 04:20.000]  old so I don't know if it's that bad today but I go to Dallas sometimes and
[04:20.000 --> 04:27.360]  I've run into it and had the comments made to me and it's just the media acts
[04:27.360 --> 04:32.600]  like only white people are racist I gotta tell you I'm a white person and I
[04:32.600 --> 04:38.640]  know because I've been everywhere from deer camps to corporate boardrooms most
[04:38.640 --> 04:46.320]  white people are guilty self-loathing anti-white self-loathing whites self-hating
[04:46.320 --> 04:51.640]  whites it's just all a lie and the propaganda has really worked well so the
[04:51.640 --> 04:54.680]  whites are all guilty and hate themselves and they go well prove you're a good
[04:54.680 --> 04:58.280]  white turn your guns in prove you're a good white be a socialist that's what

[11:18.680 --> 11:21.520]  that because we just updated the new website design and I'm seeing some of
[11:21.520 --> 11:24.600]  those bugs is the program note so I don't have time to remember during the
[11:24.600 --> 11:28.520]  break I'll just say it now there's so much other good news of this election was
[11:28.520 --> 11:31.600]  going on yesterday we had Lord Christopher Moncton on who really is an
[11:31.600 --> 11:35.560]  important guy he's very interesting as well an inventor journalist you name it
[11:35.560 --> 11:40.400]  and scientist he helped start UKIP with Nigel Farage a fellow that's been on our
[11:40.400 --> 11:47.680]  show many times over the years UKIP makes sweeping gains across the UK and UK
[11:47.680 --> 11:53.920]  elections becomes threat to main parties Penn Power French rightist leads
[11:53.920 --> 11:59.000]  anti-EU drive and basically it's a libertarian movement through the old
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.160]  right-wing skeleton in Europe that's been compromised and you're seeing
[12:03.160 --> 12:08.640]  sweeping gains in the EU parliament by UKIP now spreading into Europe you're
[12:08.640 --> 12:13.920]  seeing sweeping gains across local elections and national elections again
[12:13.920 --> 12:18.800]  that's why the globalist in Bilderberg are obsessed with the real Ron Paul
[12:18.800 --> 12:27.000]  Alex Jones libertarian Tea Party started in 2006 or so by Ron Paul supporters
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.480]  and myself we called them Tea Party events Ron Paul rallies on record not
[12:32.480 --> 12:37.440]  taking credit here I'm telling you where it came from they began in 2007 8-9
[12:37.440 --> 12:42.720]  going out and taking over Republican and Democratic events and shouting them
[12:42.720 --> 12:49.360]  down at at press conferences and speeches the Republicans wisely the
[12:49.360 --> 12:53.000]  establishment tried to then go take it over and dominate it so that they
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.560]  wouldn't get attacked Rick Perry started saying let's succeed you know let's
[12:56.560 --> 13:00.760]  arrest everybody in the government but not actually doing what he said but
[13:00.760 --> 13:06.840]  that got the heat off of them but they were unable to fully co-opt it so now
[13:06.840 --> 13:15.960]  they're trying to kill it we're putting photos on screen from actually 2004 when
[13:15.960 --> 13:19.520]  started in Boston in San Francisco in other areas but didn't get big till
[13:19.520 --> 13:26.840]  2006 7 8 9 the point is is that I watched it all unfold at the time and they
[13:26.840 --> 13:33.960]  tried to take it over Carl Rove and all the rest of them it didn't work so now
[13:33.960 --> 13:36.880]  you've got the Republican leadership and I know I stake this people need to
[13:36.880 --> 13:41.400]  know this is the fight with the Democrats giving money against the Tea Party
[13:41.400 --> 13:50.280]  you've got attempts to bring it down but it's a very exciting that Lapin's
[13:50.280 --> 13:53.880]  daughter is storming to power I happen to know from Bob Chapman and others that
[13:53.880 --> 14:01.920]  she is a listener try to get Lapin on by the way guys speak English and Farage
[14:01.920 --> 14:07.200]  of course is a listener Farage I'm not taking credit for my show I'm saying we
[14:07.200 --> 14:12.360]  have always been at the very tip of the spear cutting edge of real libertarian
[14:12.360 --> 14:17.880]  movement worldwide so is Ron Paul obviously an even bigger way and people
[14:17.880 --> 14:21.760]  see Rand Paul hanging out with Rupert Murdoch at the Kentucky Derby and get
[14:21.760 --> 14:26.720]  freaked out by that or they see Ted Cruz surging in the polls and meeting with
[14:26.720 --> 14:32.880]  Republican leadership that's the establishment trying to meet with people
[14:32.880 --> 14:37.640]  they weren't able to strangle in their crib like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz who the
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.960]  Republican Party tried to beat both of them in the primaries so that's what's
[14:42.960 --> 14:55.040]  going on there and obviously Rand Paul and Ted Cruz are going to have to at
[14:55.040 --> 15:01.040]  least on the surface and the system knows this by the way play ball with the
[15:01.040 --> 15:06.160]  establishment to not be totally destroyed but the establishment also
[15:06.160 --> 15:09.760]  realizes they've run out of options people aren't going to buy into the
[15:09.760 --> 15:12.720]  gimmick of a woman running for president they vote for a woman if she was a
[15:12.720 --> 15:16.840]  patriot people know there's a voting fraud but if they engage in voting fraud
[15:16.840 --> 15:22.320]  there'll be a revolution and Ted Cruz is telling it like it is saying with
[15:22.320 --> 15:25.080]  Democrats want to repeal the first amendment we're gonna play that clip
[15:25.080 --> 15:30.840]  coming up so we've got a real choice to make here are we gonna let the
[15:30.840 --> 15:35.920]  Republican Party fully destroy the Tea Party or are we gonna stand up for it
[15:35.920 --> 15:43.880]  and try to get the Tea Party candidates into office across the nation and the
[15:43.880 --> 15:49.760]  answer is we need to get Tea Party candidates in in 2014 we need to see a
[15:49.760 --> 15:55.040]  total sweep ahead of the general election in two years by Tea Party
[15:55.040 --> 16:00.080]  candidates and I've always been a purist and people know that but the
[16:00.080 --> 16:03.680]  Democrats are loaded for bear and they are trying to fully get rid of the
[16:03.680 --> 16:08.320]  Republican Party so there's not even an option and they understand the main
[16:08.320 --> 16:13.720]  threat to their hegemonic power is a libertarian takeover of the Republicans
[16:13.720 --> 16:22.400]  so we've got to fulfill their greatest fears and put wind into those sails and
[16:22.400 --> 16:27.880]  understand they've got their main forces attacking the Tea Party because it's the
[16:27.880 --> 16:37.280]  main venue worldwide to defeat them the Tea Party slash UKIP movement
[16:37.280 --> 16:43.400]  worldwide are just traditionalist where you have families you get to keep a
[16:43.400 --> 16:47.720]  little bit of your money you get to have a little bit of factories and jobs I
[16:47.720 --> 16:52.800]  mean the Tea Party is not one-tenth as radical as it should be it's what the
[16:52.800 --> 16:58.680]  Democrats would have been in the 1960s or the Republicans would have been in the
[16:58.680 --> 17:05.560]  1970s or 80s but the globalists have radicalized things so much in the
[17:05.560 --> 17:11.080]  Overton window that now you've got open communism being promoted by Democratic
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.040]  members of the Congress and you've got open announcements that the family's
[17:15.040 --> 17:19.480]  evil and must be eradicated and that total socialism is the way to go and
[17:19.480 --> 17:25.440]  you've got open moves we're going to play the clip of the Democrats to end
[17:25.440 --> 17:29.920]  free speech to bring in the fairness doctrine over the internet and print
[17:29.920 --> 17:34.400]  media and to bring in a new dark age of political control because they are
[17:34.400 --> 17:38.240]  authoritarians and they're unpopular they've got to do it and they want to
[17:38.240 --> 17:43.280]  bring in unlimited illegals 30 million that are here 30 plus million more that
[17:43.280 --> 17:47.480]  are about to be here and let them bring their families in to checkmate to give
[17:47.480 --> 17:52.480]  them driver's license to vote and be given welfare to politically sink the
[17:52.480 --> 18:00.760]  ship the whole battle is being joined right now and we've got to defeat the
[18:00.760 --> 18:04.800]  radicals that are anti-gun anti-family anti-sovereignty and to the
[18:04.800 --> 18:08.040]  establishment the establishment's realizing they've now reached the point
[18:08.040 --> 18:16.400]  of the plunge do they really feel safe the Rupert Murdoch's but even the so
[18:16.400 --> 18:19.680]  called leftist establishment do you really want to overthrow the whole
[18:19.680 --> 18:23.000]  country and bring in hardcore tyranny you think you're going to be safe and a

[24:37.120 --> 24:40.660]  open the phones up the next segment right now let's go to Ted Cruz
[24:40.660 --> 24:44.880]  Democratic senators want to repeal the First Amendment I'm telling you the
[24:44.880 --> 24:50.200]  only way Ted Cruz can get the poll position from Rand Paul who at the CPAC
[24:50.200 --> 24:56.280]  poll but also Gallup polls is the leader for the Republican presidential
[24:56.280 --> 25:01.000]  nomination right now and obviously that can change down the road but Rand Paul
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.040]  is the leader in every poll Ted Cruz is next but Ted Cruz is gaining Ted Cruz is
[25:08.040 --> 25:17.160]  gaining because he is sounding more hardcore than Rand Paul and the reason I
[25:17.160 --> 25:22.320]  say this is not because I'm picking favorites even though I know the polls
[25:22.320 --> 25:27.560]  really good and no Rand Paul very well I want to see Rand Paul like the
[25:27.560 --> 25:32.040]  president that's why I don't even pressure him to come on my show and I'll
[25:32.040 --> 25:38.160]  just shut my mouth right there at that point but the polls know all this okay
[25:38.160 --> 25:43.520]  it's just they're very gentlemanly reserved people which plays well with the
[25:43.520 --> 25:51.880]  Senate and the elite but at the same time when you're faced with an incredible
[25:51.880 --> 25:55.240]  tyranny and you're faced with the Democrats wanting to end free speech
[25:55.240 --> 26:01.720]  that's what they're doing so if it sounds radical but it's true you got a
[26:01.720 --> 26:04.880]  say it I mean I go into my crew all the time and I go that headlines not
[26:04.880 --> 26:09.960]  sensational enough I don't care if it sounds like the National Enquirer this
[26:09.960 --> 26:18.400]  stuff is extreme in New York State they're moving to give 12-year-olds sex
[26:18.400 --> 26:26.920]  changes whether the parents wanted or not the headline should be state
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.320]  sexualized children pushes sex changes on them or I can't even come up with a
[26:31.320 --> 26:35.280]  headline sensational enough what are you against sex changes I saw where they
[26:35.280 --> 26:42.960]  fired some talk show host in upstate New York because they called it nut job I
[26:42.960 --> 26:48.320]  think it's a nut job that we have a state to giving sex changes to 12-year-olds
[26:48.320 --> 26:52.040]  without parental consent look if somebody thinks that our woman and that
[26:52.040 --> 26:59.000]  whatever I'm not against you I'm not obsessed with sex I'm not repressed but
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.560]  let me tell you you got a bunch of people that were repressed growing up and
[27:02.560 --> 27:07.160]  they're going to the other end of the spectrum now wanting to make me pay for
[27:07.160 --> 27:16.200]  your sex change uh-uh that'd be like if I wanted a sexual enlargement or you
[27:16.200 --> 27:21.400]  wanted it making people pay for the expensive surgery I've read they have
[27:21.400 --> 27:27.400]  those I feel like I need you know or how about I feel like I need a nose job I
[27:27.400 --> 27:32.640]  think my nose is too big I want you to pay for a $20,000 nose job I mean
[27:32.640 --> 27:37.040]  because it's sexual in nature we're discriminatory if you don't pay for it
[27:37.040 --> 27:41.280]  see how we've been guilted into all this garbage and now we're being guilted
[27:41.280 --> 27:47.200]  into giving up our free speech so they can pass laws if you don't like when the
[27:47.200 --> 27:52.160]  talk show host says about transvestites or transgender people then don't
[27:52.160 --> 27:57.440]  support their sponsors and let them know that's the first amendment way to do
[27:57.440 --> 28:05.400]  it not get them fired you people are out of control fascist let's go ahead and
[28:05.400 --> 28:10.880]  go to this club of Ted Cruz telling it like it is okay we're only going to beat
[28:10.880 --> 28:14.800]  these people by saying you're not liberal you're not progressive in a
[28:14.800 --> 28:19.960]  classical sense you people are dangerous you people are a sick cult you people
[28:19.960 --> 28:23.560]  want to take our free speech you're a danger here's Ted Cruz when you think
[28:23.560 --> 28:28.640]  it can't get any worse it does this year I'm sorry to tell you the United
[28:28.640 --> 28:35.720]  States Senate is going to be voting on a constitutional amendment to repeal the
[28:35.720 --> 28:42.640]  first amendment I am telling you I am not making this up Senator Chuck Schumer
[28:42.640 --> 28:47.760]  has announced the Senate Democrats are scheduling a vote on a constitutional
[28:47.760 --> 28:53.440]  amendment to give Congress the plenary power the unlimited authority to
[28:53.440 --> 28:59.280]  regulate political speech because elected officials have decided they don't
[28:59.280 --> 29:04.800]  like it when the citizenry has the temerity to criticize what they've done
[29:04.800 --> 29:09.240]  they don't like it when pastors in their community stand up and speak the
[29:09.240 --> 29:14.480]  truth and it makes their lives inconvenient when they're not standing for
[29:14.480 --> 29:20.000]  principle and actually that's pointed out back home and I'll note this amendment
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.440]  which has 41 Democratic senators as co-sponsors 41 Democrats have signed
[29:27.440 --> 29:31.680]  on to repealing the first amendment that's right we're gonna go to break it
[29:31.680 --> 29:37.040]  by the way that guy is such presidential material right there I mean can

[33:02.120 --> 33:30.240]  the last hundred years we've been under the dictatorship of the private
[33:30.240 --> 33:36.880]  run-for-profit fellow reserve and we've been meeting the new boss same as the
[33:36.880 --> 33:45.120]  old boss for a long time where it hasn't matter who we elect president the
[33:45.120 --> 33:51.200]  corporate enters the bureaucracy continues its operation but now the
[33:51.200 --> 33:56.400]  globalists are getting ready to fully overthrow all vestiges of freedom all
[33:56.400 --> 34:02.040]  vestiges of normal human activity and have a revolution a technological
[34:02.040 --> 34:13.760]  overwrite of humanity and so as the who said we won't get fooled again I tip my
[34:13.760 --> 34:18.920]  hat to the new constitution but with Ted Cruz Rand Paul and others I guarantee
[34:18.920 --> 34:23.560]  if they get an office the system will try to compromise them as president or
[34:23.560 --> 34:27.760]  vice president and they'll have to play some ball or be fully destroyed just
[34:27.760 --> 34:33.760]  because we're so deep into this evil and so domesticated Ron Paul has a 20-year
[34:33.760 --> 34:38.200]  plan to get us out of socialism and communism and corporatism on top of
[34:38.200 --> 34:45.800]  it but you see we're in a perfect storm or either total evil is going to take
[34:45.800 --> 34:51.040]  over and that normally happens at this point historically and cannibalism
[34:51.040 --> 34:56.920]  politically sets in and society's implode or we have a renaissance out of
[34:56.920 --> 35:04.520]  this and the West has done this more than any other cultural region we've
[35:04.520 --> 35:10.000]  also been some of the worst people in the West that's off how it is the best
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.840]  and worst it will be in a people in a group in a culture the heights and the
[35:13.840 --> 35:18.920]  lows will be found the extremes if the establishment and large swaths of it are
[35:18.920 --> 35:23.960]  concerned I can tell you makes the decision they don't want to destroy the
[35:23.960 --> 35:27.080]  family they don't want to wreck everything they want to admit there's
[35:27.080 --> 35:31.200]  covert eugenics programs going on they want to admit the technocracy is
[35:31.200 --> 35:40.280]  mentally ill and admit how much trouble we're in we can reform ourselves Russia
[35:40.280 --> 35:44.440]  isn't perfect and is basically a gangster culture a very patriotic culture
[35:44.440 --> 35:52.000]  patriotic means paternal male male-based Russia's paying people to have kids
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.760]  they're against eugenics they have topped state-run talk show hosts that talk
[35:56.760 --> 36:00.880]  about the New World Order and cancer viruses and the vaccines Russia's been
[36:00.880 --> 36:07.360]  through 90 years of hell and so there's a real need to follow Alexander
[36:07.360 --> 36:11.400]  Schultz and Eatzen there's a real need to try to reform things through
[36:11.400 --> 36:16.840]  nationalistic Russia we could reform things and be 10 times greater than
[36:16.840 --> 36:22.000]  Russia's trying to be because we haven't gone through 90 years of pure hell yet
[36:22.000 --> 36:28.280]  oh we will it'll be 20 years of technocratic hell not 90 years everything's
[36:28.280 --> 36:36.720]  compressed now in the modern age if the establishment large sections of it
[36:36.720 --> 36:43.640]  decide to be sane decide to not be nihilistic decide to not be in an
[36:43.640 --> 36:48.320]  authoritarian race to get full technocratic control so you can then
[36:48.320 --> 36:54.880]  battle each other for control of the life extension levers we can instead
[36:54.880 --> 37:01.960]  export excess population and dangerous experimental colonies off-world via free
[37:01.960 --> 37:05.680]  market and free will there'll be plenty of people that sign up to go an
[37:05.680 --> 37:15.640]  incredibly dangerous missions we can literally do anything together but we
[37:15.640 --> 37:18.920]  got to be honest about all the world works and stop hoarding the knowledge in
[37:18.920 --> 37:23.320]  the data to a tiny elite because you don't want other people involved in the
[37:23.320 --> 37:28.640]  decision-making process the decision to wall off technological development for
[37:28.640 --> 37:35.480]  only the elite will end up boomeranging back on you and I know you know that and
[37:35.480 --> 37:41.720]  your algorithms show that and I'm not saying anything's gonna be perfect but
[37:41.720 --> 37:46.600]  we have to make the decision to try to be pro-human because if pro-human
[37:46.600 --> 37:51.960]  decisions aren't put into the equation there's no way humanity will not be
[37:51.960 --> 37:58.280]  destroyed as we know it even if we try to do the right thing and be measured in
[37:58.280 --> 38:04.360]  what's happening we don't have a lot of really good options for the general
[38:04.360 --> 38:09.920]  population especially because of the decisions that have been made in a
[38:09.920 --> 38:19.520]  Western global architecture in the last 160 year plan it's so built into the
[38:19.520 --> 38:26.480]  system now that unless we try to build in algorithms and and and and
[38:26.480 --> 38:31.240]  developments that can somehow create something new out of what you've already
[38:31.240 --> 38:36.320]  set in motion the only way to describe the technological terror we're about to
[38:36.320 --> 38:41.720]  enter is pure Satanism and I'm mainly talking to the establishment right now
[38:41.720 --> 38:46.000]  if you're a new listener and owner show and I'm talking about I'm not trying to
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.080]  say I'm over your head or anything it's just that let me just put it to you this
[38:50.080 --> 38:54.480]  way you're not in Kansas anymore and you need to grow up and and and really
[38:54.480 --> 39:01.600]  realize that there's things a lot more important than the NFL and Miley Cyrus
[39:07.160 --> 39:11.720]  now I want to get into the TSA developments I want to get more into
[39:11.720 --> 39:14.960]  Ted Cruz I want to get more to Harry Reid single bomb should basically be a
[39:14.960 --> 39:25.160]  dictator I want to get into a bunch of this but right now I want to as humbly
[39:25.160 --> 39:29.080]  as I can talk about something really important that dovetails with the things
[39:29.080 --> 39:33.560]  I just covered and then just leave it at that and and and send a message to
[39:33.560 --> 39:44.640]  somebody I said about two years ago that I want to take my rule here at info wars
[39:44.640 --> 39:48.720]  calm of not in fighting with other libertarians or conservatives or
[39:48.720 --> 39:52.920]  constitutionalist even if we disagree with a lot of things people do if we
[39:52.920 --> 39:57.360]  agree with them 60 70 80% and they're not openly saying turn in the guns
[39:57.360 --> 40:01.640]  openly saying get rid of the family openly saying bring in world government
[40:01.640 --> 40:05.960]  we need to work together because the systems coming in trying to shut down
[40:05.960 --> 40:11.440]  the new media that is becoming the dominant media and my goal is to beat
[40:11.440 --> 40:18.200]  the tyrants the treasure I'm seeking what makes me tick what floats my boat is
[40:18.200 --> 40:25.400]  human liberty justice renaissance and love of God and love of innocence I'm
[40:25.400 --> 40:30.840]  not some goody two shoes either folks I just love justice I love honor I love
[40:30.840 --> 40:37.920]  being a good man and I grew up thinking everybody was like my family turned out
[40:37.920 --> 40:41.120]  people were laughing at me and thought I was a fool because I was a good man
[40:41.120 --> 40:45.760]  because I was honorable people learn to cheat ladies and gentlemen they think
[40:45.760 --> 40:51.120]  they're smart because they're cheating the truth is being honorable is all
[40:51.120 --> 40:57.040]  there is in life the truth is I can be just as evil just as wicked and then
[40:57.040 --> 41:00.760]  some than bad people because they don't have the perspective of good I can go
[41:00.760 --> 41:07.420]  beyond your evil that's called wisdom the knowledge to dominate is nothing
[41:07.420 --> 41:20.880]  compared to the wisdom to understand in the full context of what it will do but
[41:20.880 --> 41:24.000]  I've been immature I've been on air 19 years and it's certainly been a growing
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.080]  process and a train wreck so I apologize to everyone for the things I've done
[41:27.080 --> 41:35.360]  whether it's been perceived or real the reason I'm concerned about going back
[41:35.360 --> 41:46.160]  right now is because I can identify federal talking points and the fact
[41:46.160 --> 41:54.280]  that he's putting them out the way he is really says something bad and he said
[41:54.280 --> 41:59.400]  a lot of lies about me the last few months and basically is trying to tell
[41:59.400 --> 42:04.240]  radio stations not to carry my show and it's trying to damage the info wars
[42:04.240 --> 42:14.000]  operation and free speech he says I want violence he says I was behind the
[42:14.000 --> 42:21.600]  Bundy racist comments I played the clips I'm not gonna play him again he says
[42:21.600 --> 42:27.720]  that I'm Malcolm X and that he's Martin Luther King and then this represents
[42:27.720 --> 42:34.040]  what Mark Malcolm X stood for at the end Malcolm X was pretty much nonviolent
[42:34.040 --> 42:41.640]  he was always I've arrived to defend myself that's not offensive violence but
[42:41.640 --> 42:44.880]  yesterday and we got sent the clip by multiple affiliates I didn't even listen
[42:44.880 --> 42:49.000]  all of it I just I just I had the guys do me a transcript because I just can't
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.200]  listen to it quite frankly it makes me want to cry because Glenn Beck's a very
[42:53.200 --> 42:58.440]  talented smart person has so much potential there's a great actor and I
[42:58.440 --> 43:02.560]  mean that he admits he's an actor he likes to be an actor he's put on some
[43:02.560 --> 43:08.520]  great stage shows I'm not in competition with Glenn Beck and I'm not gonna
[43:08.520 --> 43:11.680]  respond to it anymore I told my crew don't attack him anymore they did a promo
[43:11.680 --> 43:15.960]  where MSNBC and CNN's attacking me saying I'm a conspiracy theorist and must
[43:15.960 --> 43:19.060]  be stopped and then we play a clip of when back saying he's a conspiracy
[43:19.060 --> 43:23.000]  theorist you know the rest of it showing the talking point I'm gonna have
[43:23.000 --> 43:28.360]  that ad taken down I'm gonna take the uber high road I'm not gonna talk about
[43:28.360 --> 43:32.280]  Glenn Beck anymore but what he did is basically say yesterday I'm gonna
[43:32.280 --> 43:37.080]  destroy the Tea Party so that when the establishment demonizes the Tea Party I
[43:37.080 --> 43:46.140]  will be blamed when in truth he's trying to lead it down a rat hole and obviously
[43:46.140 --> 43:52.800]  working for the Republican establishment and the tactics he uses are
[43:52.800 --> 44:00.840]  spending 20 minutes on a part of a segment another segment and Breitbart did
[44:00.840 --> 44:04.600]  the same thing here it here's the headline McDaniels supporter arrested
[44:04.600 --> 44:10.240]  for speaking in the Mississippi senator Thad Cochran's wife's nursing home room
[44:10.240 --> 44:13.840]  well I mean I think of the incumbents not taking care of his wife I'm not
[44:13.840 --> 44:18.080]  alleging that that's not the stuff you would want to investigate Clayton
[44:18.080 --> 44:25.000]  Thomas Kelly 28 of Pearl allegedly photographed Rose Cochran who's an
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.160]  incapacitated with progressive dementia now I don't know if it was bad what he
[44:30.160 --> 44:34.920]  did or good I don't know but this is what Southern Prairie Law Center ADL
[44:34.920 --> 44:42.200]  State Department MSNBC White House Run Media Matters do my show reaches 15
[44:42.200 --> 44:44.880]  million people it's more than that now in fact we've looked at some numbers it's
[44:44.880 --> 44:50.720]  probably 18 million a week one way or another right now okay basically half the
[44:50.720 --> 44:56.440]  population knows who I am now this shows big they can go into anybody's
[44:56.440 --> 45:02.760]  computer or Twitter or Facebook or website and most people are who are
[45:02.760 --> 45:05.400]  politically involved are going to have my stuff on their website one way or
[45:05.400 --> 45:11.200]  another they went on to basically say this guy's my reporter and I have
[45:11.200 --> 45:17.480]  reporters embedded everywhere and that info wars snuck in to the nursing room
[45:17.480 --> 45:23.080]  because on the guy's website he's got some of my videos according to Beck I
[45:23.080 --> 45:28.200]  didn't go look that's like the Marine who got a dishonorable discharge Richard
[45:28.200 --> 45:33.240]  Poplowski and Pittsburgh who shot three cops dead within two hours of him being
[45:33.240 --> 45:36.840]  arrested they had his computer and on the news they said he did it for Alex
[45:36.840 --> 45:41.640]  Jones and had someone it turned out was not his friend and didn't know him
[45:41.640 --> 45:47.000]  saying on the news he did it for Alex Jones this is a pattern so I instantly
[45:47.000 --> 45:53.240]  know how to recognize these patterns now where he's following the exact script
[45:53.240 --> 45:56.640]  that I'm gonna cause violence and when there's violence it's my fault so when
[45:56.640 --> 46:03.080]  there's a false flag I get blamed his YouTube page included videos featuring
[46:03.080 --> 46:07.880]  Alex Jones we did go to his YouTube page we couldn't find a site and on the
[46:07.880 --> 46:11.600]  side YouTube said these are recommended in fact I forgot to give that to you this
[46:11.600 --> 46:16.440]  morning go look up his YouTube and show it they're not even his videos YouTube
[46:16.440 --> 46:21.400]  because the guys politically involved as a libertarian did it displays what's
[46:21.400 --> 46:27.680]  similar that's how that works Google works that way you they own YouTube so
[46:27.680 --> 46:32.360]  so I should have made that point I'm not guilty of this I didn't go in the
[46:32.360 --> 46:44.400]  nursing room none of my crew did and Glenn Beck knows that and he went on and
[46:44.400 --> 46:48.320]  said you know no one involved in my network radio you name it needs to be
[46:48.320 --> 46:53.520]  involved with Alex Jones none of my listeners he's a bad guy and none of
[46:53.520 --> 46:56.360]  these radio stations I mean because he knows I want a bunch of the same stations
[46:56.360 --> 47:00.520]  so the stations I'm not attacking going back I mean is he your boss do I get
[47:00.520 --> 47:06.720]  turned off through the radio because he says because he's God and Glenn Beck
[47:06.720 --> 47:10.440]  really opens himself up here if he was successful and got me kicked off radio
[47:10.440 --> 47:16.560]  stations I'm not going to pursue it but it is torturous interference it's
[47:16.560 --> 47:21.600]  warfare against me and what did media matter say they would do to drudge they
[47:21.600 --> 47:26.160]  would do to Fox they would do to info wars I'm not saying Fox is perfect but
[47:26.160 --> 47:30.040]  they they lump us in together they said we're going to infiltrate we're going
[47:30.040 --> 47:35.560]  to destroy them and all I know is this guy quotes media matters quotes one
[47:35.560 --> 47:42.240]  after the next and I'm done talking about it and I have to respond when a
[47:42.240 --> 47:46.120]  show that big reaching millions you know six seven eight million a day is doing
[47:46.120 --> 47:51.040]  that I mean that's a big deal but what really concerns me is I recognize what
[47:51.040 --> 47:56.000]  it is and I don't know if he's getting fed it by the White House or if they're
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.680]  smart enough to just copy what media matters is saying and to go with
[47:59.680 --> 48:03.240]  government talking points but it really is a bad and then he goes and laughs at
[48:03.240 --> 48:07.520]  me and says no one here ever worked for the CIA and laughs when at least two of
[48:07.520 --> 48:12.480]  his senior people on record were in information warfare at the CIA and even
[48:12.480 --> 48:16.080]  names one of them and says he was never in the CIA I mean I heard like three
[48:16.080 --> 48:21.640]  minutes this I had to go out of the room folks the preying on the audience like
[48:21.640 --> 48:28.480]  they're stupid was really freaked me out I'm gonna say this I'm gonna take the
[48:28.480 --> 48:33.480]  high-rub I don't want callers calling in about this I'm gonna have that one ad
[48:33.480 --> 48:36.240]  which already meant to do this for running for a week that has glenbeck's
[48:36.240 --> 48:39.720]  voice on it call me a conspiracy terrorist those calls me dangerous and
[48:39.720 --> 48:45.280]  evil I want to take him down oh yeah and then we're gonna have a new one with
[48:45.280 --> 48:49.000]  it with it replaced with a clip of them saying Alex Jones is now in a New York
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.880]  jail or Austin jail we use one of those clips
[48:52.880 --> 49:01.600]  this is terrible news ladies and gentlemen you know I rush one ball isn't
[49:01.600 --> 49:08.040]  perfect he is an angel compared to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton Sean
[49:08.040 --> 49:12.200]  Hannity's not perfect he at least supported a free speech property rights
[49:12.200 --> 49:19.320]  movement with the Bundy's all I'm saying is if the Republicans get in and act like
[49:19.320 --> 49:23.280]  Obama or the globalist I will speak out against it but right now the Democrats
[49:23.280 --> 49:26.240]  are trying to extinct free speech in this country they're trying to totally
[49:26.240 --> 49:31.360]  take over and create a dictatorship of their party and I'll vote for him sandwich
[49:31.360 --> 49:36.800]  over them okay they're they're that dangerous they're going for everything
[49:36.800 --> 49:40.360]  they're persecuting people for their free speech to next to Susan and many
[49:40.360 --> 49:43.800]  others they're gonna come after everybody and I'll just say this in
[49:43.800 --> 49:47.840]  closing the glenbeck dude you better get over your fear because I happen to know
[49:47.840 --> 49:51.240]  from your you you were scared to death all those bodyguards I know you've been

[54:12.120 --> 54:17.320]  my analogy with libertarians and constitutionalists is like this it's
[54:17.320 --> 54:20.840]  like they're a brother I've got well I've been in a lot of fistfights with
[54:20.840 --> 54:25.360]  over the years and I don't completely agree with a lot of things but I still
[54:25.360 --> 54:32.200]  love them compared to having Jeffrey Dahmer living next door that's Obama
[54:32.200 --> 54:38.520]  and the Democrats and I'm not gonna fight with my brother over did he open
[54:38.520 --> 54:42.560]  his car door and ding my car and get in a fistfight with my brother while
[54:42.560 --> 54:49.240]  there's a guy across the street eating little kids that's what I'm trying to
[54:49.240 --> 54:52.880]  say here I mean I really have nightmares about the New World Order I
[54:52.880 --> 55:00.000]  really lay awake at night thinking how to beat them but these people are bad we
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.160]  don't want to bring in their total evil and go along with this technocratic
[55:03.160 --> 55:08.920]  system a lot of people join the New World Order because they're so scared of it
[55:08.920 --> 55:13.520]  I've talked to a lot of billionaires a lot of top engineers a lot of you know
[55:13.520 --> 55:19.920]  big company owners I mean routinely a lot of rich people live in Austin and I've
[55:19.920 --> 55:23.600]  not tried to get in these circles but I'm just always like a movie brought into
[55:23.600 --> 55:29.120]  them it's like that high women's song and our lives were like some old western
[55:29.120 --> 55:34.840]  movie desperado's waiting for a train
[55:34.840 --> 55:43.680]  want to play that song sometime today or play part of it he let me drive his car
[55:43.680 --> 55:50.800]  when he's too drunk to and he'd wink and give me money for the girls I mean
[55:50.800 --> 55:55.280]  that's literally in the establishment most of them know what's going on and
[55:55.280 --> 56:00.200]  are literally just scared to death playing ball with the technocrats on top
[56:00.200 --> 56:05.240]  and people have to stop being afraid
[56:08.720 --> 56:12.640]  because there's no future in this
[56:14.640 --> 56:20.120]  by the way they found that guy's YouTube site that Breitbart and Beck and
[56:20.120 --> 56:23.680]  others are trying to tie me to let's put it on screen we went through more than

[56:49.480 --> 56:54.120]  scrolling through we found we found Rachel Maddow and Glenn Beck on there so
[56:54.120 --> 56:58.560]  it's Rachel Maddow and Glenn Beck's fault that this guy went to nursing home
[56:58.560 --> 57:02.040]  I mean this is the type of stuff I'm going through folks and it's really

[1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:18.600]  clean and not be cluttered on the side and be a truly moderate site but we've
[1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:24.040]  tried that folks don't like it so we're gonna phase it in but info wars.com
[1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:27.440]  has been updated and if you click on one of the articles you can see what the

[1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:56.120]  and others berries in Thailand so we'll go to Barry first folks calling
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:00.480]  internationally it's open phones on this Friday it's a free-for-all any question
[1:12:00.480 --> 1:12:09.120]  any comment agree disagree wildcard Friday sometimes we have wildcard
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:12.400]  Mondays where we're just talking about whatever you want but first I want to
[1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:17.360]  get into the TSA but before I do that Ted Cruz says Democratic senators want to
[1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:21.800]  repeal the First Amendment now the bill they've introduced under Schumer we
[1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:30.080]  covered this weeks ago it puts people in the newsrooms it lets the government
[1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:36.360]  label what's media and what's not and it allows them to restrict free speech and
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:41.240]  they've got other bills and then the FCC say they're going to fairness the true
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:45.160]  fairness we have with net neutrality and bring in that neutrality net taxes all
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:49.040]  these different control systems it's all happening now and we have no hope of
[1:12:49.040 --> 1:13:01.480]  countering it no hope zero if we don't admit that it's an authoritarian take
[1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:06.080]  over that's why he continues to rise in the polls is because he's telling it
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:10.000]  like it is we're told every day don't be radical don't be extreme don't be
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:13.320]  aggressive you're going to lose politically we've gotten in the
[1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:18.760]  position we are because Liberty lovers libertarians constitutionalists have
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:24.040]  gotten so milk toast and get drowned out by the so-called liberals who are
[1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:28.360]  saying your kids belong to us hundred percent taxes we're above the law your
[1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:32.440]  races if you don't like government run healthcare that's written to screw
[1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:37.400]  everybody over financially and erase taxes on poor people and to surveil all
[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:40.960]  your medical records and give them to everybody I mean it's such a nightmare
[1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:46.320]  it's so over the top and the Republican leadership could have a slam dunk win
[1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:53.640]  running against Obamacare but Ted Cruz and Rand Paul are against it so they're
[1:13:53.640 --> 1:14:00.640]  superstars respectively set to win the Republican nomination for president and
[1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:12.240]  vice president I mean I come off like a train wreck sometimes and I'm on the
[1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:16.800]  phone with senators and Congress people calling me wanting to know my advice
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:21.960]  I'm not bragging folks I'm not going to say names here but heads of
[1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:27.040]  corporations senators you name it want to talk to me on the phone for 45 minutes
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:34.760]  at night because their top people are saying look at the algorithms of Alex
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:39.080]  Jones look at the algorithms of all this they know that the establishment knows
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:44.880]  everything's going down and they know that we know how to defeat the enemy and
[1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:49.960]  again why am I telling you the story before I go calls I'm not bragging it's
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:58.640]  like living in a Twilight Zone episode or the matrix that I'm somebody without
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:01.400]  a college education ladies and gentlemen by the way I'm proud of it I was
[1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:05.760]  already successful starting my own media operation by my own bootstraps when I
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:11.080]  was 21 years old I'm 40 now I could have gone to college I could have got a
[1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:13.400]  degree I could have gone to made a hundred thousand dollars a year I could
[1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:17.480]  have played ball with the system I made my own way my own path that's what I'm
[1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:23.240]  known for doing trailblazing but trailblazing it was more like a train
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:27.840]  wreck I just had the will to not want to be a slave and the will to fight
[1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:33.080]  tyranny and when they harass me and physically attack me and demonize me and
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:41.040]  stalked me and threatened me that only made me fight harder so I know how
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:45.600]  powerful you are a lot of you are better looking than I am smarter than I am
[1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:50.000]  better spoken than I am have better oratory skills than I have you may
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:53.520]  not think you have them because you haven't attempted to use your skills
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:58.480]  yet when you get in the arena you get stronger folks I've been in the arena
[1:15:58.480 --> 1:16:03.840]  forged in the fires of grassroots warfare against tyranny and control
[1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:10.200]  freaks and scum jellyfish everywhere for 19 years two years before that in the
[1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:15.280]  proto tea party libertarian movement I went and put out yard sides for Pat
[1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:21.120]  Buchanan I went out knocked on doors and canvassed I went out and gave
[1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:28.160]  speeches at caucuses I went out and did I tried everything I could and you know
[1:16:28.160 --> 1:16:32.200]  what it's done in 19 years change the landscape created a whole new way of
[1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:37.880]  looking at things for so many so I'm not bragging I've come face to face now
[1:16:37.880 --> 1:16:44.280]  with the fact that I have changed history because of you like a horse and
[1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:50.640]  carriage our listeners from the beginning resonated and taught me the old
[1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:54.640]  timers the veterans the patriots the engineers the government people the
[1:16:54.640 --> 1:17:01.000]  police officers gave me the intel the firefighters deputy fire chief Vic
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:05.480]  Vreeland Vietnam veteran his own right great guy took me under his wing helped
[1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:09.720]  me for a year start info wars I've told the crew get ahold of Vic Vreeland I
[1:17:09.720 --> 1:17:12.640]  think he lives in Bastrop now get ahold of him and his wife I want to take him
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:18.000]  out to dinner I want to get him in here taught me so much like my dad taught me
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:24.680]  and my grandfather's taught me and here I am after 19 years another testament to
[1:17:24.680 --> 1:17:29.480]  all of us working together we have savaged the enemy we have held back
[1:17:29.480 --> 1:17:33.560]  their plans I'm not bragging it just needs to be said how precious the info
[1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:37.800]  war is and everything we do here in my crew in my operation we're making
[1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:44.680]  history and it shows that when good men and women stand up and keep coming the
[1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:48.800]  founder of the Texas Rangers famously said a man on the wrong can't stand up
[1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:55.720]  against a man in the right who keeps on a coming you got to keep on a coming
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:03.920]  these people are cowards were fighting their scum and I have a desire to see
[1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:09.640]  them fall you have a desire to see your football team win you have a desire to
[1:18:09.640 --> 1:18:13.880]  see your son or daughter get an A-plus and test great I see these parents and
[1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:16.960]  put their kids under so much pressure to have the top grades and get into the
[1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:19.840]  best college and and their kids you know some of them make it some of them
[1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:24.080]  commit suicide others go to drugs parents you should care about your kids being
[1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:28.520]  honorable you should care about your children being healthy you should care
[1:18:28.520 --> 1:18:35.760]  about them upholding their family name and then everything else will follow you
[1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:39.960]  should be with your children at the homeless shelters if you want to raise
[1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:43.520]  them right I'm speaking to myself here right now there's a lot I need to do I

[1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:55.760]  healthy and not drink Florida water in each GMO need to be teaching them yeah
[1:18:55.760 --> 1:18:59.760]  good get good grades but the end of the day that doesn't matter what matters is
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:08.280]  is be true and be satisfied and be good and to love God and also stand up for
[1:19:08.280 --> 1:19:12.840]  yourself if parents tell their kids don't fight back kids getting more
[1:19:12.840 --> 1:19:16.880]  trouble when they get beat up if they fight back then if they lay on the
[1:19:16.880 --> 1:19:21.840]  ground and I I look at how my parents raised me and it was the opposite of
[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:26.000]  what people raise folks now and maybe it was reckless it was bad I wouldn't do it
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:30.160]  now but in the way it was good oh you want a motorcycle sure go have one you

[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:08.680]  members the Democratic Party in the Congress already cosponsoring a bill
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:13.000]  that when you read it ends the First Amendment this is authoritarianism these
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:17.440]  people are dangerous these are Kim Jong-un wannabes let's go to that clip
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:22.840]  when you think it can't get any worse it does this year I'm sorry to tell you the
[1:26:22.840 --> 1:26:29.000]  United States Senate is going to be voting on a constitutional amendment to
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:36.560]  repeal the First Amendment I am telling you I am not making this up Senator
[1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:41.520]  Chuck Schumer has announced the Senate Democrats are scheduling a vote on a
[1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:47.360]  constitutional amendment to give Congress the plenary power the unlimited
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:53.560]  authority to regulate political speech because elected officials have decided
[1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:58.680]  they don't like it when the citizenry has the temerity to criticize what they've
[1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:03.840]  done they don't like it when pastors in their community stand up and speak the
[1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:09.080]  truth and it makes their lives inconvenient when they're not standing for
[1:27:09.080 --> 1:27:17.560]  principle and actually that's right full clip full speech at info wars.com shifting
[1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:21.680]  gears the stories on the left-hand side of red report.com if you want to find it
[1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:28.400]  actress TSA Pat down gives me a head orgasm actress Molly Shannon
[1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:32.920]  characterized invasive TSA Pat downs is some kind of fetishistic sexual
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:38.480]  experience they've had rappers rockers others all say this to push it doing an
[1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:42.240]  appearance on the Colonel Brian show this week when she said that the sensation
[1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:46.400]  of a TSA agent groping her gave her a head orgasm really when they do it to
[1:27:46.400 --> 1:27:51.080]  small children is called pedophilia which Shannon explains how she opted out
[1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:54.600]  of an x-ray scanner while traveling to New York and was given the option to have
[1:27:54.600 --> 1:27:58.320]  the Pat down I shouldn't call her a witch maybe she's just ignorant to be
[1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:01.880]  conducted in public or in a private room it already felt like a spa
[1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:06.160]  experience or a massage said Shannon oh yeah it's real great well let's go ahead
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:09.880]  and actually hear from her and set me quoting her I get a kind of tingling
[1:28:09.880 --> 1:28:14.880]  sensation in my body certain I'm slow hand movements trigger it or soft voices
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:22.280]  or like a soft touch will trigger like a head orgasm really that's fantastic
[1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:27.000]  were you experiencing that when the TSA person was touching you I did yeah I
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:31.960]  get triggered a lot at the airport like I love with people if people if people are
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:36.160]  wearing plastic gloves I like when they check your like if you if you have your
[1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:38.800]  your check that you go through the luggage I like when they have the gloves
[1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:42.040]  out and they check it or I love when I get checked and they have to go through
[1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:44.800]  my luggage with the plastic gloves and they have to go through each item like
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:51.960]  methodically swiping and going through it or I just sexual it sounds sexual to
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:57.040]  me that you're getting a sexual is it you said head orgasm that's why I think
[1:28:57.040 --> 1:29:01.160]  that's my right oh my god this is being ironic is what she's really doing she
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:06.280]  doesn't like it but women especially on average decide if they're being
[1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:10.400]  suppressed not all of them but statistically to go with it and say
[1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:14.400]  they like it and it's on record women are more susceptible what's known as the
[1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:20.400]  Stockholm syndrome not bashing women's just it's a survival mechanism but see
[1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:23.920]  they're using our own survival mechanisms against us where we won't
[1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:28.280]  survive in the end but just training us how to be prisoners that story is also

[1:31:09.920 --> 1:31:13.960]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[1:31:13.960 --> 1:31:18.160]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[1:31:18.160 --> 1:31:21.880]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there

[1:35:19.460 --> 1:35:23.980]  friend what's on your mind but I just thought I'd chime in from behind the
[1:35:23.980 --> 1:35:28.420]  curtain of the military junta martial law curfew I should have thought of that
[1:35:28.420 --> 1:35:33.420]  you went under martial law two days ago in a military coup yeah oh yeah it's
[1:35:33.420 --> 1:35:37.100]  very real here right now so anyways I'm feeling pretty lonely just wanted to
[1:35:37.100 --> 1:35:43.420]  hear your voice no how's it going you know we should hit the NSA database and
[1:35:43.420 --> 1:35:47.940]  type in martial law Thailand and just show folks the articles or they'll say
[1:35:47.940 --> 1:35:51.300]  later on YouTube we made it up or they'll probably claim Thailand doesn't
[1:35:51.300 --> 1:35:57.980]  exist oh it's all over international media right now doesn't exist Obama said
[1:35:57.980 --> 1:36:02.900]  it's racist exactly exactly you don't have to be an electrical or be smart
[1:36:02.900 --> 1:36:06.460]  just say the word racist Thailand tourists advice remains unchanged despite
[1:36:06.460 --> 1:36:11.140]  military coup as country reassures travelers Bangkok is safe so so tell
[1:36:11.140 --> 1:36:18.020]  me why why you're there and what you're seeing and what's happening well there's
[1:36:18.020 --> 1:36:22.340]  military everywhere and I'm under lockdown right now I can't be out on the
[1:36:22.340 --> 1:36:28.660]  street from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. otherwise they risk arrest and detention and you
[1:36:28.660 --> 1:36:31.940]  know God knows what I mean they you know it's all like they're gonna haul me off
[1:36:31.940 --> 1:36:36.060]  to detention anyone caught out after dark will be permanently detained a lot of
[1:36:36.060 --> 1:36:41.380]  US cities are like that what's wrong with that but they did kidnap the former
[1:36:41.380 --> 1:36:46.100]  prime minister's sister and she was actually the most recent prime minister
[1:36:46.100 --> 1:36:49.980]  well you know what Romans 13 says out of context whatever the government is
[1:36:49.980 --> 1:36:56.100]  whether it's Hitler Stalin or a coup it's of God so if they if they eat her on
[1:36:56.100 --> 1:37:00.500]  the lawn it's of the Lord according to mainline churches so why don't you hit
[1:37:00.500 --> 1:37:05.820]  your knees and thank the coup I think they should do that just to prove that
[1:37:05.820 --> 1:37:11.620]  it is godly and of the Lord and and that everybody should bow to this so you
[1:37:11.620 --> 1:37:16.540]  know George Washington was a bad man for fighting the King of England of course
[1:37:16.540 --> 1:37:20.140]  then he became the government so then we worship him at that point oh wait that
[1:37:20.140 --> 1:37:24.340]  doesn't make sense I'm sorry go ahead I've been here since August and there has
[1:37:24.340 --> 1:37:27.620]  been a lot of violence but ultimately I'll just you know give you the bottom
[1:37:27.620 --> 1:37:31.380]  line I really do believe the CIA is behind this because I've listened to the
[1:37:31.380 --> 1:37:36.060]  rhetoric from both sides and and the anti-government people it started off as
[1:37:36.060 --> 1:37:41.100]  this pro-democracy thing then it changed into this anti-capitalism thing and as
[1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:45.820]  soon as that happened you know I started listening you know for the
[1:37:45.820 --> 1:37:50.980]  socialist overtones and when I started hearing more about that coming out of
[1:37:50.980 --> 1:37:55.660]  the other you know the opposition that's when I kind of had a feeling that you
[1:37:55.660 --> 1:37:59.140]  know the CIA was probably behind it and well let me ask you see you think the
[1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:05.340]  CIA is trying to put in a socialist regime yeah I do I really do and they may
[1:38:05.340 --> 1:38:09.420]  get it too because when the military coup happened I mean the military is
[1:38:09.420 --> 1:38:13.060]  talking about how fair and balanced they need to be to both side but when they
[1:38:13.060 --> 1:38:17.060]  ousted the the sitting government they handed a pretty strong victory to the
[1:38:17.060 --> 1:38:23.380]  the anti-government people which would be in my opinion the socialist crowd yeah
[1:38:23.380 --> 1:38:26.620]  they call it socialism and they just give the money to the ruling class a new
[1:38:26.620 --> 1:38:29.820]  ruling class I'll have to look into that more I know some about the internal
[1:38:29.820 --> 1:38:35.260]  politics of that more about Malaysia and places but just one time I ran into a
[1:38:35.260 --> 1:38:40.020]  lady from Thailand and she goes I hear you say Thailand not free we are free we
[1:38:40.020 --> 1:38:44.620]  have King we have Queen so maybe we should hear some for some Taiwanese and
[1:38:44.620 --> 1:38:48.820]  they can give us their take on their form of government the berry appreciate
[1:38:48.820 --> 1:38:54.860]  your call be safe over there buddy see you later buckaroo let's talk to Ben in
[1:38:54.860 --> 1:38:59.780]  California go ahead hey Alex thanks for having me on I'm a left-leaning
[1:38:59.780 --> 1:39:05.260]  libertarian here I just wanted to talk about quantum computing you can go on
[1:39:05.260 --> 1:39:09.540]  Google type in and in quantum you can see that it's been going on for seven
[1:39:09.540 --> 1:39:14.220]  years Google's had the quantum computers for many years well I don't actually
[1:39:14.220 --> 1:39:17.020]  don't know what you're talking about someone's gonna call you racist is that
[1:39:17.020 --> 1:39:22.180]  okay that's all right but you know I just I mean I just want to sound like I'm
[1:39:22.180 --> 1:39:27.140]  in charge of the conversation okay whatever show off racist diamond
[1:39:27.140 --> 1:39:33.740]  quantum is something that Google has they have the D wave computers and you
[1:39:33.740 --> 1:39:37.620]  know it's going the old guard is going to be shaken up just like the classical
[1:39:37.620 --> 1:39:42.780]  computers shook up a lot of things with the media so the you know there's
[1:39:42.780 --> 1:39:47.100]  things going on with with advanced technology that is just not being talked
[1:39:47.100 --> 1:39:51.180]  about as much I think technology in the general public's hands is bigoted and
[1:39:51.180 --> 1:39:57.500]  racist just like they're starting to ban honor student balls that's not that's
[1:39:57.500 --> 1:40:01.460]  uninclusive so I want those banned as well see I'm not even joking at this
[1:40:01.460 --> 1:40:08.700]  point you don't ever have tacos or enchiladas for dinner do you I do I love
[1:40:08.700 --> 1:40:12.580]  well that's racist do you agree that as a left-leaning person that we they should
[1:40:12.580 --> 1:40:16.540]  like fraternities having fiesta parties because I'll assure you I've been to them
[1:40:16.540 --> 1:40:19.500]  it's not about putting down Hispanics doesn't matter though someone is a
[1:40:19.500 --> 1:40:23.340]  friend I agree that there's definitely a whole racial they try to you know make
[1:40:23.340 --> 1:40:27.060]  the conversation about race to distract from the actual important issues of
[1:40:27.060 --> 1:40:30.500]  shouldn't we just there's a singularity coming the globalist say it's the end of
[1:40:30.500 --> 1:40:33.780]  humanity robots taking everything over let's not discuss that and how we're
[1:40:33.780 --> 1:40:37.540]  being displaced and the decisions been made to exterminate humanity except for
[1:40:37.540 --> 1:40:41.820]  the elite let's talk about fiesta parties where body gets drunk and has a
[1:40:41.820 --> 1:40:49.260]  good time the Spanish word for party is inherently evil just admit it no I agree
[1:40:49.260 --> 1:40:53.300]  with eighty percent of the stuff you say I do think sometimes I take an
[1:40:53.300 --> 1:40:57.380]  afternoon nap though because I like the idea of a siesta on the weekend is that
[1:40:57.380 --> 1:41:02.860]  racist you work hard you deserve to create your own but is it racist that I
[1:41:02.860 --> 1:41:07.540]  call I'll say to my family I'm gonna take a siesta am I doing that to put down
[1:41:07.540 --> 1:41:11.980]  Hispanics when I say it no well that's because you're obviously part of the
[1:41:11.980 --> 1:41:15.900]  racism and don't understand the underlying tones of you might be white
[1:41:15.900 --> 1:41:21.860]  which is an overall privilege racist class sir do you have a girlfriend or
[1:41:21.860 --> 1:41:26.980]  wife I have a wife do you want to apologize for raping her because all
[1:41:26.980 --> 1:41:30.140]  sex when a man has sex with a woman it's rape now don't you think that's
[1:41:30.140 --> 1:41:34.660]  reasonable that's being taught at all colleges right now all all establishment
[1:41:34.660 --> 1:41:38.900]  no you know it's hard to it does shades of everything you know you can't so you
[1:41:38.900 --> 1:41:42.900]  do agree you are a rapist good good that's good good well you understand
[1:41:42.900 --> 1:41:46.580]  there's shades of all arguments for all for left to right and then there's
[1:41:46.580 --> 1:41:50.100]  everything in between one of the ones you to slap her around and act like you're
[1:41:50.100 --> 1:41:56.540]  raping or is that right you know that's just a personal private matter no it's
[1:41:56.540 --> 1:42:04.300]  right it's right it's rape racist no Alex I do I do agree with you no no no
[1:42:04.300 --> 1:42:10.740]  you sound like Ember Palpatine well I don't know I I mean I just want to talk
[1:42:10.740 --> 1:42:15.380]  about the Diamond Quantum computers with the wireless technology that the
[1:42:15.380 --> 1:42:19.620]  media has used because they got like they got free licenses to use the
[1:42:19.620 --> 1:42:26.620]  spectrum and so the debate is about let's let's free up spectrum and use these
[1:42:26.620 --> 1:42:30.980]  quantum computers for the betterment of humanity okay well listen you sound like
[1:42:30.980 --> 1:42:33.540]  you know about quantum computers I know a little bit about them guys print me
[1:42:33.540 --> 1:42:36.740]  something on them so I'm not gonna know but I know about the whole super
[1:42:36.740 --> 1:42:41.220]  computer quantum computer revolution where that where the engineers can't
[1:42:41.220 --> 1:42:44.380]  even understand how the computers are designing the computers now and we're
[1:42:44.380 --> 1:42:47.820]  talking about stuff a hundred times faster every month till it's a thousand
[1:42:47.820 --> 1:42:52.220]  times ten thousand times quantum computers have been built inside diamonds
[1:42:52.220 --> 1:42:56.780]  you name it to where we can have instantaneous HD communication anywhere
[1:42:56.780 --> 1:43:00.180]  in the planet they're putting in the fiber optic we can also have total real
[1:43:00.180 --> 1:43:04.860]  time surveillance of all the smart dust and RFID systems to give them real
[1:43:04.860 --> 1:43:09.020]  searchability of the real universe nano tech the singularity is gonna be here
[1:43:09.020 --> 1:43:13.260]  much quicker than they're telling the public and again it's being designed
[1:43:13.260 --> 1:43:16.620]  towards an anti-human movement it could be designed as a human empowerment
[1:43:16.620 --> 1:43:21.700]  movement give us your take on quantum computers I'll shut up well my take is
[1:43:21.700 --> 1:43:26.660]  that they they're real they exist and yeah they keep saying they're about to
[1:43:26.660 --> 1:43:31.500]  get quantum computers but they really already have them go ahead yeah that's
[1:43:31.500 --> 1:43:35.500]  something that bothers me too is that they have them and they can probably
[1:43:35.500 --> 1:43:39.780]  use quantum cryptography to break all of the classical encryption of course
[1:43:39.780 --> 1:43:43.700]  hey they they they've got backdoors to all of it but that's admitted they've
[1:43:43.700 --> 1:43:48.460]  got energized chips they can power up from a distance with cell towers we
[1:43:48.460 --> 1:43:51.700]  told you that 15 years ago was declassified this year of course of
[1:43:51.700 --> 1:43:57.300]  course and yeah so you know I agree with that they probably have them they're
[1:43:57.300 --> 1:44:01.380]  breaking encryption and who knows if the classical internet can even sustain
[1:44:01.380 --> 1:44:05.700]  quantum computers existing that you Berkeley laboratory said they had a
[1:44:05.700 --> 1:44:10.620]  quantum internet already so it doesn't matter if they if they deploy the
[1:44:10.620 --> 1:44:16.020]  quantum because as long as we use what we're using that's our culture they'll
[1:44:16.020 --> 1:44:19.620]  just tell us oh this is dead now go to this to shut down the entire
[1:44:19.620 --> 1:44:24.300]  architecture of the organic internet that's grown with Hydra in it as well
[1:44:24.300 --> 1:44:28.180]  I mean certainly got the globalist in it we need to say no when that happens we
[1:44:28.180 --> 1:44:34.220]  don't want your new Trojan horse yeah you know they're gonna they're gonna be
[1:44:34.220 --> 1:44:38.500]  both sides to it there's factions everywhere and everybody's buying for
[1:44:38.500 --> 1:44:42.940]  some type of power and you know but I mean you say you say you believe they
[1:44:42.940 --> 1:44:47.260]  already exist I knew from memory they already had operating proto and what
[1:44:47.260 --> 1:44:50.860]  they believe are the first quantum computers two years ago and there's a
[1:44:50.860 --> 1:44:54.100]  headline government lab reveals it has operated quantum internet for over two
[1:44:54.100 --> 1:45:01.740]  years and that source is what Wall Street Journal MIT technology review do
[1:45:01.740 --> 1:45:05.860]  you wave as a company that's been around since 2007 working on the quantum
[1:45:05.860 --> 1:45:12.340]  computers but it's not mainstream look look look my dad saw CDs and CD ROM in
[1:45:12.340 --> 1:45:18.020]  68 at UT and it was in DARPA stuff that labs he was in he had assigned forms he
[1:45:18.020 --> 1:45:21.180]  couldn't talk about it I mean they didn't they said that didn't come out to the
[1:45:21.180 --> 1:45:26.300]  80s folks and we're not in Kansas I appreciate your call yeah it's their
[1:45:26.300 --> 1:45:29.460]  30 years advanced of what the public's been told that's why they're on such
[1:45:29.460 --> 1:45:33.180]  power trips right now they've already got massive live extension they already
[1:45:33.180 --> 1:45:37.060]  know how to cure almost all cancer we're not gonna get access to it in
[1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:40.260]  fact we're not gonna get access to regular health care now under Obamacare
[1:45:40.260 --> 1:45:44.060]  it's eugenics care but it doesn't matter the trendies love it so they're gonna
[1:45:44.060 --> 1:45:47.900]  roll over and die go ahead trendies take all the shots drink the fluoride and
[1:45:47.900 --> 1:45:52.340]  kill yourselves give it to your kids to the sacrament of believing in the system
[1:45:52.340 --> 1:45:59.540]  give it all to your kids just believe it at all you don't want to go into the
[1:45:59.540 --> 1:46:04.140]  future you want to die I don't want to die I don't buy it I have a right as a
[1:46:04.140 --> 1:46:08.140]  sentient being to say I don't want to be in your new old order and I'm not your
[1:46:08.140 --> 1:46:13.700]  slave and I'm gonna fight you and I'm one creature showing the power of our
[1:46:13.700 --> 1:46:17.860]  species who's already caused massive problems for the globalist and there are
[1:46:17.860 --> 1:46:23.420]  better men than I out there and better women than I so you need to take action
[1:46:23.420 --> 1:46:29.980]  okay we can't overthrow the new world order but you've got to overthrow the
[1:46:29.980 --> 1:46:36.380]  belief that you're weak the feeding this is an inside job Ethan in Missouri you're
[1:46:36.380 --> 1:46:41.900]  on the air go ahead hey how you doing Alex doing all right brother great to be
[1:46:41.900 --> 1:46:46.900]  on God bless you I love all the work you're doing I you know I'm usually a
[1:46:46.900 --> 1:46:51.780]  day behind the show I actually finished yesterday show today and I heard the clip
[1:46:51.780 --> 1:46:56.060]  of Bill Clinton on there and a lot of these political people and you know the
[1:46:56.060 --> 1:47:04.700]  some of the religious community right exactly and you know I didn't know if
[1:47:04.700 --> 1:47:10.660]  you guys were familiar with the NASDA project called Project Bluebeam yes so
[1:47:10.660 --> 1:47:16.180]  you know it's you know the honestly declassified they had aliens landing and
[1:47:16.180 --> 1:47:23.140]  Muhammad walking around in 400 foot holograms in the first desert storm that
[1:47:23.140 --> 1:47:28.460]  that's been declassified right so you know I just want to get that out there
[1:47:28.460 --> 1:47:32.300]  to people that you know these these people have crazy technology you know
[1:47:32.300 --> 1:47:36.460]  they're you know like you like you kind of hint on sometimes these people are
[1:47:36.460 --> 1:47:40.860]  demonic they're you know they're not people of God they're you know we're
[1:47:40.860 --> 1:47:44.540]  fighting a war for for souls it's not about money it's not about control no
[1:47:44.540 --> 1:47:47.860]  there's no doubt the people even if you don't believe in the spirit folks the
[1:47:47.860 --> 1:47:52.540]  technocrats running things at the top are psychopaths who enjoy hurting
[1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:59.780]  humanity exactly and you know I just wanted to be out there because you know
[1:47:59.780 --> 1:48:04.740]  I mean if something popped up in the sky and you're looking at me like wow you
[1:48:04.740 --> 1:48:09.220]  know this is this is insane but people have this kind of technology and and you
[1:48:09.220 --> 1:48:15.020]  know these these families and bloodlines go back very far and you know they're
[1:48:15.020 --> 1:48:19.380]  out to rape and pillage humanity you know they're out to take everything from
[1:48:19.380 --> 1:48:24.380]  us and you know make us slaves by the way I think it was one of the winners or
[1:48:24.380 --> 1:48:28.980]  the runners up we had a 10-minute Bluebeam video made about the New World
[1:48:28.980 --> 1:48:33.180]  Order staging alien attacks to bring in world government using a black man of
[1:48:33.180 --> 1:48:36.860]  space planes it's really a very feasible plan and it looked like something
[1:48:36.860 --> 1:48:40.260]  made by Hollywood that was part of one of our video contest see if Rob do
[1:48:40.260 --> 1:48:44.540]  remember the name of that we should repost those treasure trove of videos
[1:48:44.540 --> 1:48:48.620]  on a routine basis they're just so good there's so much native talent out there
[1:48:48.620 --> 1:48:57.500]  great points Ethan Ryan in chaos you're on the air go ahead good brother one
[1:48:57.500 --> 1:49:00.380]  thing I wanted to have a number of things that I could talk about first I
[1:49:00.380 --> 1:49:04.020]  want to simplify things so everybody can know that the war on terror is just a
[1:49:04.020 --> 1:49:09.820]  repackage modern-day version of the ancient Salem witch trials also no
[1:49:09.820 --> 1:49:13.980]  exactly it's a foggy enemy no one can defeat and then meanwhile the people
[1:49:13.980 --> 1:49:17.500]  running the trial are the ones dressing up like witches running around at night
[1:49:17.500 --> 1:49:22.580]  to scare people oh yeah cops you know I don't not all cops are bad and stuff but
[1:49:22.580 --> 1:49:26.100]  like most of them the criminals they use the cover of authorities mask their
[1:49:26.100 --> 1:49:30.140]  deceptive agendas Alex and they get away with it and they basically just
[1:49:30.140 --> 1:49:33.260]  see how much we're gonna put up with and so we'll fight back it's kind of like
[1:49:33.260 --> 1:49:36.940]  if you poke an animal into a corner with a stick and then you try to get that
[1:49:36.940 --> 1:49:40.580]  animal mad and then when the animal bites you go see look the animal was me
[1:49:40.580 --> 1:49:44.620]  needs to be controlled blah blah blah that's basically what they're doing but
[1:49:44.620 --> 1:49:48.980]  um minimum wage was another thing that you for bringing up all the economic
[1:49:48.980 --> 1:49:52.700]  news that we were getting into that kind of caught my attention because I
[1:49:52.700 --> 1:49:57.340]  actually before I studied accounting I have a radio television background as a
[1:49:57.340 --> 1:50:00.580]  board off and a DJ and all that so I know how the media spent all this stuff
[1:50:00.580 --> 1:50:06.660]  around and in conjunction with accounting what they do raising minimum
[1:50:06.660 --> 1:50:09.700]  wage is kind of like a proportional fraction if you have a pencil and a
[1:50:09.700 --> 1:50:14.260]  piece of paper I can quickly show you what this is gonna do in terms of how
[1:50:14.260 --> 1:50:17.780]  it's gonna have a ripple effect on the economy in our lives
[1:50:17.780 --> 1:50:23.860]  what is minimum wage right now Alex like 750 725 like that yes and what's
[1:50:23.860 --> 1:50:28.540]  really hurting us is inflation shutting down the economy shutting down jobs
[1:50:28.540 --> 1:50:32.420]  raising minimum wage will just accelerate inflation and will within a
[1:50:32.420 --> 1:50:39.380]  month most actuary show steal whatever money is increased in your pay but but
[1:50:39.380 --> 1:50:43.500]  it's something where they can act like they're trying to help you what's your
[1:50:43.500 --> 1:50:47.380]  take on that oh it's Ronald Reagan all over again I'm a terrifying words
[1:50:47.380 --> 1:50:50.500]  English brainers I'm from the government I'm here to help but the
[1:50:50.500 --> 1:50:54.220]  hyperinflation is kind of what you're starting to touch up on and what that is
[1:50:54.220 --> 1:50:57.980]  is whenever they eliminate enough jobs and they want finish on the other side
[1:50:57.980 --> 1:51:03.500]  Ryan then Rob Joe David Mike and others gentlemen in search of a million dollars
[1:51:03.500 --> 1:51:07.220]  smile that'll make them take notice I mean really get their attention then get

[2:01:26.220 --> 2:01:30.780]  you guys are doing well thank you on that subject we've gotten really nothing
[2:01:30.780 --> 2:01:33.660]  but rave reviews on all the products I mean I can't really even think of any
[2:01:33.660 --> 2:01:39.060]  negative reviews and it's it's simply amazing to see this happening but I'll
[2:01:39.060 --> 2:01:44.100]  be honest I got into eye and on because of radiation issues that's a side issue
[2:01:44.100 --> 2:01:50.860]  it only protects the thyroid the government does recommend it but the
[2:01:50.860 --> 2:01:55.300]  big thing is that we're deficient in iodine and it's the health effects the
[2:01:55.300 --> 2:01:59.940]  mental clarity the skin health everything is the reason I'm into nason
[2:01:59.940 --> 2:02:03.740]  iodine and then I tried to go out and find nason iodine and discovered most
[2:02:03.740 --> 2:02:08.180]  of them are an alcohol base really aren't even nason iodine we went and
[2:02:08.180 --> 2:02:12.780]  checked factories that make it they're just dumping iodine into alcohol and I
[2:02:12.780 --> 2:02:15.900]  don't want to stir up trouble or fight with people it's just not really iodine
[2:02:15.900 --> 2:02:20.340]  so we went out and or not not true nascent where it goes right in the blood
[2:02:20.340 --> 2:02:28.380]  and look the brand system we've got is proprietary nobody else has got it there's
[2:02:28.380 --> 2:02:31.780]  one lab that has it they've been putting it out for 20 years it's double the price
[2:02:31.780 --> 2:02:36.060]  half the cost you know half the size we put it out and it's great we're gonna
[2:02:36.060 --> 2:02:39.460]  keep selling survival shield we've got something coming out next week folks
[2:02:39.460 --> 2:02:46.540]  that is over a decade in the works and is unbelievable there is nothing like it
[2:02:46.540 --> 2:02:50.780]  iodine based and I mean it is unbelievable so I'm glad you brought
[2:02:50.780 --> 2:02:54.740]  that up it's gonna be a win-win it'll help operate this war wagon against the
[2:02:54.740 --> 2:02:59.980]  enemy and it just I've been taking it for about a month and quite frankly I
[2:02:59.980 --> 2:03:03.740]  wouldn't give it to children it's it's it's not as strong as the alcohol based
[2:03:03.740 --> 2:03:10.940]  stuff it's not all based but it's souped up and it's incredible I'm sorry go
[2:03:10.940 --> 2:03:15.060]  ahead yeah you know I'm gonna say I was gonna ask you for the survival shield
[2:03:15.060 --> 2:03:18.820]  the kids that can kids can take that is there any particular age well I'm not
[2:03:18.820 --> 2:03:23.900]  your physician consult your physician on anything but it doesn't have the
[2:03:23.900 --> 2:03:30.900]  alcohol in it it's pure iodine it's purple crystal iodine from 8,000 feet
[2:03:30.900 --> 2:03:35.660]  under the ground and it just goes right in the blood it doesn't be broken down
[2:03:35.660 --> 2:03:39.020]  with the body some people can't really break down the other so-called iodine
[2:03:39.020 --> 2:03:42.740]  that's why there's such big dosages of it in the pills and other forms with this
[2:03:42.740 --> 2:03:46.020]  you can take a lower dose it goes right in the blood I give it to my children
[2:03:46.020 --> 2:03:51.460]  but I mean that's your decision to make so consult the physician but there will
[2:03:51.460 --> 2:03:55.700]  be a detox in the first month so you know just consult your physician or
[2:03:55.700 --> 2:04:01.060]  healthcare provider you know I wanted to say another thing to you I travel quite
[2:04:01.060 --> 2:04:05.660]  around here I'm so I'm a business owner drive around a lot I never I never see
[2:04:05.660 --> 2:04:11.540]  anything third board with really good information would it be possible that
[2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:15.820]  you guys we could fundraise the money to put a couple billboards and fours out
[2:04:15.820 --> 2:04:19.060]  here in the city of Chicago on some of the major highways I mean it would
[2:04:19.060 --> 2:04:23.500]  boom you big time here's my problem I know billboard space is really cheap
[2:04:23.500 --> 2:04:26.220]  right now because the billboard industry's collapsed because the economy
[2:04:26.220 --> 2:04:30.420]  so bad information warfare is very effective with billboards a I don't
[2:04:30.420 --> 2:04:34.340]  have the money B then I've got to come up with the billboards make sure they go
[2:04:34.340 --> 2:04:41.460]  up and humid that make sure that's going on and engage what happens but I would
[2:04:41.460 --> 2:04:46.780]  love listeners to put up billboards for info wars whatever messages you've got
[2:04:46.780 --> 2:04:49.860]  we've had listeners do that a lot over the years that's the best way to do it
[2:04:49.860 --> 2:04:56.100]  you put it up you get the best price you make sure it's up there maybe you info
[2:04:56.100 --> 2:04:59.300]  wars is well known maybe you put your own website up with it they'll pay for
[2:04:59.300 --> 2:05:04.100]  the billboard a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine

[2:08:39.260 --> 2:08:43.420]  we're going right back to your calls I just wanted to point out that during the
[2:08:43.420 --> 2:08:49.580]  break I was looking at info wars.com and saw the mainstream media headline that
[2:08:49.580 --> 2:08:58.620]  NSA set to use the mic on your phone to listen to you even when it's off I told
[2:08:58.620 --> 2:09:05.020]  everybody that in 1996 how did I know that it was in the telecommunications
[2:09:05.020 --> 2:09:10.620]  act but cell phones have a capacitor in them where they can be remotely turned
[2:09:10.620 --> 2:09:16.140]  on and they can listen to you over the microphone even when it's off and track
[2:09:16.140 --> 2:09:22.620]  your location for the NSA and it was engineers that came to me because at one
[2:09:22.620 --> 2:09:26.660]  came to me and then more came to me once they heard me talk about it and go look
[2:09:26.660 --> 2:09:30.420]  at this look at that I mean I'd engineer show up in the parking lot of the radio
[2:09:30.420 --> 2:09:35.860]  station and rip open scientific Atlantic time-warner cable boxes that had
[2:09:35.860 --> 2:09:40.780]  microphones in them I mean that was like 15 years before they started having a
[2:09:40.780 --> 2:09:44.740]  be voice activated now they were there the whole time they said look this builds
[2:09:44.740 --> 2:09:49.420]  an algorithm it tracks everything you watch it's reported back and it took
[2:09:49.420 --> 2:09:55.780]  10 years or more till they admitted that that was going on and again I'm not
[2:09:55.780 --> 2:10:00.980]  tooting my horn I'm saying this stuff is hidden in plain view and it's so
[2:10:00.980 --> 2:10:11.820]  frustrating I remember seeing federal cases 12-13 years ago we're on Star which
[2:10:11.820 --> 2:10:18.900]  is a cell phone with satellite triangulator GPS and that they're
[2:10:18.900 --> 2:10:22.340]  listening to you in live time with that
[2:10:23.460 --> 2:10:28.860]  in fact most of the time and now they're in almost all the cars down in the
[2:10:28.860 --> 2:10:33.260]  undercarriage and then they've got a microphone snaked up hidden in the
[2:10:33.260 --> 2:10:36.180]  upholstery
[2:10:37.340 --> 2:10:41.340]  would people even care if I ripped open a truck seat and showed them a microphone
[2:10:41.340 --> 2:10:48.220]  I mean it's incredible but if you went to somebody's door and went hey mind if I
[2:10:48.220 --> 2:10:52.140]  put a microphone in your bedroom they'd be like what are you talking about I
[2:10:52.140 --> 2:10:56.380]  think I'm gonna do it that's the type of sensational thing it'll give people's
[2:10:56.380 --> 2:11:00.260]  attention and people go I'm gonna kick your butt and I'll go hey hey it's just a
[2:11:00.260 --> 2:11:03.260]  joke to illustrate the NSA is doing it do you mind siding this forum so I can
[2:11:03.260 --> 2:11:08.340]  put this on YouTube and watch I bet some people are gonna go no get out of here
[2:11:08.340 --> 2:11:13.020]  if I call the cops so you're so offended that I even joked about putting a
[2:11:13.020 --> 2:11:16.460]  camera or microphone in your house that that you're saying get off your front
[2:11:16.460 --> 2:11:21.100]  porch because I've invaded your space I've taken your time up from whatever you
[2:11:21.100 --> 2:11:27.020]  were doing you have a right to be mad at me and I did this to illustrate to you
[2:11:28.820 --> 2:11:34.580]  I did this so that you would be aware of how you're already being abused in fact
[2:11:34.580 --> 2:11:37.860]  they just found some article I was unaware of throw that up there I mean I
[2:11:37.860 --> 2:11:43.860]  was aware of this going on but I didn't know that they were admitting it that's
[2:11:43.860 --> 2:11:52.460]  the Washington Times 2013 back in June a year ago big brother alert cameras in
[2:11:52.460 --> 2:11:58.820]  the cable box to monitor TV viewers we broke that in 2005 Paul Joseph Watson
[2:11:58.820 --> 2:12:06.580]  prison plunder.com and I actually had a talk show host I know in Austin saw me
[2:12:06.580 --> 2:12:10.260]  in at a comedy event and literally walked over and said you are the biggest
[2:12:10.260 --> 2:12:15.740]  nutball on earth I know some of the stuff you talk about is true but Google
[2:12:15.740 --> 2:12:20.300]  isn't using cameras to watch you in your house and I would have people in my
[2:12:20.300 --> 2:12:25.300]  house and family would laugh at me when I would have a piece of tape over the
[2:12:25.300 --> 2:12:28.540]  camera on the computer because we had apples. Apple was the first to do that
[2:12:28.540 --> 2:12:32.780]  like 10 years ago. People don't laugh now when people are in my house workmen or
[2:12:32.780 --> 2:12:36.220]  whatever they'll see go oh I see you cover that up and I go yeah and they're
[2:12:36.220 --> 2:12:41.540]  like yeah they can watch you yeah no I do know about that also know about the
[2:12:41.540 --> 2:12:46.900]  cancer viruses and the vaccines I mean we've been under this for a long time
[2:12:46.900 --> 2:12:52.380]  folks did you get a memo cops not to drink the tap water it's got over a
[2:12:52.380 --> 2:12:56.420]  hundred deadly chemicals on average and in some cases 350 plus did you get a
[2:12:56.420 --> 2:13:00.820]  memo about glyphosates giving you prostate cancer and your wife breast
[2:13:00.820 --> 2:13:05.980]  cancer did you get a memo about cancer viruses and RNA and DNA and
[2:13:05.980 --> 2:13:10.900]  microplasm in almost all the vaccines if you don't know about it you might want
[2:13:10.900 --> 2:13:13.780]  to find out and then you'll realize murdering killers are running things
[2:13:13.780 --> 2:13:17.620]  and there's no reason to live in denial and I'm telling you the truth the whole
[2:13:17.620 --> 2:13:23.980]  truth of them but the truth so help me God if I am lying and if I'm exaggerating
[2:13:23.980 --> 2:13:27.700]  and they say you shouldn't do this but but I'll just say this I'm not I am a
[2:13:27.700 --> 2:13:32.100]  superstitious man about God but you know it touched me that I'm going to your
[2:13:32.100 --> 2:13:37.740]  calls I was at a 9-11 anniversary I think three or fourth anniversary of it at
[2:13:37.740 --> 2:13:42.580]  a big church and I just given a speech that was the fifth anniversary I just
[2:13:42.580 --> 2:13:48.380]  remember 2006 and I was on KTSA with a talk show host called the where pair a
[2:13:48.380 --> 2:13:50.820]  dad and a son have had a show for every dollar I don't know they still have it
[2:13:50.820 --> 2:13:55.500]  but it had high ratings at the time on the number one shows in San Antonio by
[2:13:55.500 --> 2:14:03.260]  50 a.m. well the first radio stations in the country I keep digressing and I was
[2:14:03.260 --> 2:14:08.100]  on there for about an hour on a cell phone out there in a back patio of the
[2:14:08.100 --> 2:14:18.140]  church and the son whatever his name was and we look up the where pair online he
[2:14:18.140 --> 2:14:21.540]  goes Alex I think you're a good man and and and don't think you're making this
[2:14:21.540 --> 2:14:25.460]  stuff up and I know you got some points but he goes they're still on the air I
[2:14:25.460 --> 2:14:29.660]  guess maybe they're not because let me tell you something you're gonna have to
[2:14:29.660 --> 2:14:34.900]  face God for what you've said and you better hope you're not wrong about this
[2:14:34.900 --> 2:14:38.420]  you better understand you're gonna stand before God one day and you know what it
[2:14:38.420 --> 2:14:42.180]  felt really good because he was warning me he's on you know this is hard to
[2:14:42.180 --> 2:14:45.620]  believe and you better not be making this stuff up I don't think you're that
[2:14:45.620 --> 2:14:49.460]  type of person so I've been on a guest on the show on issues before they agreed
[2:14:49.460 --> 2:14:54.660]  with over the years you know back from like 96 and I said no I can stand before
[2:14:54.660 --> 2:14:58.500]  God for what I've done because it's a big deal to come out and say the government
[2:14:58.500 --> 2:15:03.260]  carried out 9-11 with criminal elements and was protecting al-Qaeda you can't
[2:15:03.260 --> 2:15:12.300]  handle the truth I mean I just I'm ready I I know that I love God I know I've
[2:15:12.300 --> 2:15:16.820]  told the truth I know I've done what I needed to do I'm not on a power trip I'm
[2:15:16.820 --> 2:15:24.060]  very humble but man I don't make this stuff up you can argue with my
[2:15:24.060 --> 2:15:28.620]  interpretation all day long folks but we're in deep trouble okay and denial is
[2:15:28.620 --> 2:15:36.300]  gonna cook our goose I want to in fact I want you to get the where pair I don't
[2:15:36.300 --> 2:15:38.980]  know they have a show anymore because talk radio has been shoveled around so
[2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:43.340]  much gotta get them on all these years later and other people say we ought to
[2:15:43.340 --> 2:15:46.800]  get Michelle Malcolm on who said I was terrible for talking about 9-11 yeah
[2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:52.900]  Trey wears his name 5 p.m. to 9 a.m. or 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. this is a morning show now
[2:15:52.900 --> 2:15:59.580]  just be an afternoon and come on and I'm gonna just read where our government
[2:15:59.580 --> 2:16:03.180]  funds al-Qaeda our government's turning companies over to al-Qaeda I could show
[2:16:03.180 --> 2:16:07.420]  you all the proof now and look back in and six of the ten 9-11 commissions
[2:16:07.420 --> 2:16:12.100]  members saying it was all made up and say now now do you think I can stand
[2:16:12.100 --> 2:16:19.220]  before God by the way even if I'm wrong about some things God knows my heart and
[2:16:19.220 --> 2:16:24.020]  God knows I believe what I'm saying I got some really good news I want to get
[2:16:24.020 --> 2:16:31.220]  to the first let's go to your phone calls let's go ahead and talk to Mike in
[2:16:31.220 --> 2:16:37.900]  New York Mike thanks for holding you're on the air worldwide hello yes or go
[2:16:37.900 --> 2:16:47.460]  ahead hi yeah I would I'm from upstate New York and I would like to talk about
[2:16:47.460 --> 2:16:55.140]  the two radio holes that were just fired I think it's pretty ridiculous that you
[2:16:55.140 --> 2:17:02.860]  know they were fired because they don't think that we as taxpayers should pay
[2:17:02.860 --> 2:17:09.980]  for somebody to have a sex change I was just wondering what your thoughts were
[2:17:09.980 --> 2:17:17.820]  on that I know that you had mentioned that earlier in the broadcast today well
[2:17:17.820 --> 2:17:23.420]  I know what it is it's absolute total hardcore authoritarianism or to talk
[2:17:23.420 --> 2:17:31.100]  show host and I've got the article here in my stack to come out and to say we're
[2:17:31.100 --> 2:17:37.140]  sick of paying for people to have sex changes it's also New York State and
[2:17:37.140 --> 2:17:42.180]  others where they're set to give people 12 years old and younger sex changes a
[2:17:42.180 --> 2:17:47.980]  child isn't at the age of consent it's their parents so if an 18-year-old
[2:17:47.980 --> 2:17:52.860]  wants to trick a 14-year-old into having sex with them we call that
[2:17:52.860 --> 2:17:59.500]  pedophilia I think with somebody 17 and it's an 18-year-old come on they need
[2:17:59.500 --> 2:18:03.020]  to lower the age of 17 I mean give me a break folks how many people are 18 and
[2:18:03.020 --> 2:18:07.580]  a 17-year-old I mean that half people in this country would probably be on the
[2:18:07.580 --> 2:18:12.620]  sex registry list but undoubtedly when you go do a sex change on some kid that
[2:18:12.620 --> 2:18:16.940]  goes to social workers and says I want to have my genitals chopped off that is
[2:18:16.940 --> 2:18:21.940]  crazy that's why you can't have an adult say the child consented to sex because
[2:18:21.940 --> 2:18:26.020]  they're not of the age of consent so I believe it's a sexualization of children
[2:18:26.020 --> 2:18:30.380]  and pedophilia what's going on but yeah I'm sick of paying for abortions and
[2:18:30.380 --> 2:18:34.300]  sex changes and everything else I mean it's it's it's out of control they
[2:18:34.300 --> 2:18:39.020]  fired them but that's everybody should boycott that radio station and boycott
[2:18:39.020 --> 2:18:43.820]  that system even if you agree with people getting sex changes you should agree
[2:18:43.820 --> 2:18:46.780]  with someone's right to say they don't want to pay for people to get sex
[2:18:46.780 --> 2:18:51.300]  changes you see what I'm saying absolutely absolutely and and New York
[2:18:51.300 --> 2:18:56.980]  State is I mean I call it nothing New York because you know it your freedoms
[2:18:56.980 --> 2:19:04.140]  are completely taken away here it's super politically correct you know all
[2:19:04.140 --> 2:19:09.300]  our politicians are the most corrupt chopper wants to get rid of the first
[2:19:09.300 --> 2:19:12.740]  amendment oh yeah I mean governor Cuomo said if your pro-life or pro-gun get out
[2:19:12.740 --> 2:19:17.260]  of the state they are gangsters they are thugs they are the opposite of Thomas
[2:19:17.260 --> 2:19:23.540]  Jefferson they are absolute knuckle-dragging thugs I believe New York
[2:19:23.540 --> 2:19:28.660]  State is the headquarters for the New World Order it's just it's absolutely
[2:19:28.660 --> 2:19:38.180]  despicable you know you're right and it's disgusting one last thing and it's
[2:19:38.180 --> 2:19:43.580]  a little it's off-topic it's about your supplement I take your super male

[2:25:07.140 --> 2:25:13.980]  just absolutely amazing one other thing is and I don't know if this is
[2:25:13.980 --> 2:25:18.780]  possible doctor group supplements are so great I was wondering if maybe he could
[2:25:18.780 --> 2:25:24.500]  possibly come up with a formula specifically for ADD because there's so
[2:25:24.500 --> 2:25:29.100]  many kids and stuff that they put on all that garbage medication you know it's
[2:25:29.100 --> 2:25:33.900]  it's funny you say that we have in the works the problem is to get all the
[2:25:33.900 --> 2:25:42.220]  stuff organic with a calming system for adults and children that uses approved
[2:25:42.220 --> 2:25:48.620]  they call it FDA grass meaning it's all certified to be you know known safe herbs
[2:25:48.620 --> 2:25:53.980]  to calm people and that's coming out in a few months it's amazing that you said
[2:25:53.980 --> 2:25:57.620]  that that is exactly what we're coming out with but look I'm no medical doctor
[2:25:57.620 --> 2:26:02.300]  I'm no expert all I know is this even mainline doctors and medical doctors like
[2:26:02.300 --> 2:26:07.060]  I've had on have said like Dr. Boylock and others so much of children misbehavior
[2:26:07.060 --> 2:26:13.700]  is that they have deficiencies there's too much sugar and iodine is a hundred
[2:26:13.700 --> 2:26:17.180]  percent associated with the brain and clarity in fact privately that's what
[2:26:17.180 --> 2:26:20.220]  group says it's really for and the glands and everything and that's what
[2:26:20.220 --> 2:26:25.500]  it's done for me I was definitely iodine deficient I mean the government used to
[2:26:25.500 --> 2:26:29.540]  make you put it in the salt okay and make them spray it on crops and stuff
[2:26:29.540 --> 2:26:34.620]  now they've taken it out and America's like a bunch of zombies so absolutely
[2:26:34.620 --> 2:26:39.460]  and again Shane Steiner my good buddy from high school he was kind of laughing
[2:26:39.460 --> 2:26:42.820]  said I've tried every supplement you know most of its bowl some of it helps a
[2:26:42.820 --> 2:26:46.260]  little he goes you you really put on a supermail about telling us it just takes
[2:26:46.260 --> 2:26:50.100]  them comes back two weeks later he goes this is unbelievable I need cases of it
[2:26:50.100 --> 2:26:54.500]  cases and it just he says his whole life's gotten better and clarity and
[2:26:54.500 --> 2:27:01.220]  workouts and libido and and and his wife liked super mail but she got a month
[2:27:01.220 --> 2:27:05.060]  ago the super female it's not out till next week but she got an early beta test
[2:27:05.060 --> 2:27:08.900]  and she just well we'll see if she'll talk about it on her or if that's even a
[2:27:08.900 --> 2:27:14.540]  family show the point is is that this isn't a game everyone I know has a big
[2:27:14.540 --> 2:27:18.140]  response of super mail everyone that I know has a response with the iodine
[2:27:18.140 --> 2:27:23.060]  there may be people out there that don't I don't know them yet and all I can say
[2:27:23.060 --> 2:27:29.420]  is when I forget to not take it I feel it when I forget to not take it I feel it
[2:27:29.420 --> 2:27:33.780]  and my throat was totally shot my larynx I could hardly talk today it got

[2:33:56.300 --> 2:34:03.140]  even get to you in this hour I saw a story yesterday at CNS news dot com it
[2:34:03.140 --> 2:34:10.220]  was on drugs report comms where I found it that are that I already knew but that
[2:34:10.220 --> 2:34:14.900]  I didn't know all the details of because Obamacare has been so secretive and they
[2:34:14.900 --> 2:34:19.260]  can implement it however they want we weren't sure exactly how they would skin
[2:34:19.260 --> 2:34:27.340]  the cat and here's to the headline federal biosurveillance plan seeking
[2:34:27.340 --> 2:34:31.940]  direct access to Americans private medical records my dad managed 22 dental
[2:34:31.940 --> 2:34:36.980]  offices and also consulted and worked for a major hospital group as a manager and
[2:34:36.980 --> 2:34:43.380]  to the legislature and also testified to a bunch of other groups and consulted
[2:34:43.380 --> 2:34:48.540]  and he was telling me two years ago before it passed that it was going to do
[2:34:48.540 --> 2:34:53.020]  this and he was telling me when it passed and went through and was getting
[2:34:53.020 --> 2:34:57.460]  implemented last year what it was already doing because he was in medical
[2:34:57.460 --> 2:35:02.300]  management everything he said he said it's meant to wreck healthcare and kick
[2:35:02.300 --> 2:35:05.460]  out all the dentists and doctors so they can bring in new groups the big mega
[2:35:05.460 --> 2:35:10.540]  groups run by the HMOs are allowed to do whatever they want over bill whatever
[2:35:10.540 --> 2:35:13.860]  it's all the small and medium groups are going to be shut down persecuted
[2:35:13.860 --> 2:35:20.860]  arrested that now started this year my dad's gone by the eye out of it and he
[2:35:20.860 --> 2:35:26.620]  was making you know a nice show I'm working hard he's out of it and he was
[2:35:26.620 --> 2:35:30.180]  bringing ethical care and quality it was all about delivering the highest
[2:35:30.180 --> 2:35:35.860]  quality and and and getting people in the whole nine yards I mean he goes and
[2:35:35.860 --> 2:35:39.060]  testifies the legislature where they're you know grabbing the entire bank
[2:35:39.060 --> 2:35:43.820]  accounts of health grips and arresting people for no reason for for a tea that's
[2:35:43.820 --> 2:35:49.820]  not crossed literally he introduced the term death penalty and they use that in
[2:35:49.820 --> 2:35:54.420]  state of Texas fighting Obamacare because you do one thing wrong one thing
[2:35:54.420 --> 2:35:58.420]  you're going to jail no judge no jury you get thrown in jail your whole
[2:35:58.420 --> 2:36:03.140]  company gets seized I'm trying to get him in here as a guest sometime the point
[2:36:03.140 --> 2:36:06.820]  is I already knew about all this okay from the inside watching it
[2:36:06.820 --> 2:36:11.340]  Dr. Blaylock two years ago predicted it all here because you know he's managed
[2:36:11.340 --> 2:36:15.380]  universities and medical centers and top brain surgeon then it a lot of the
[2:36:15.380 --> 2:36:19.580]  brain surgeries that are used today and he said it all the good people are
[2:36:19.580 --> 2:36:23.620]  getting out because it's designed to where you have to be unethical and not
[2:36:23.620 --> 2:36:28.260]  give people health care or join with some big mega group who's unethical and
[2:36:28.260 --> 2:36:32.460]  overcharges but gives bad health care I mean the doctors aren't doctors anymore
[2:36:32.460 --> 2:36:37.460]  is what's about to happen their little surveillance bots so when I read this in
[2:36:37.460 --> 2:36:41.260]  CNS news though we're now seeing how it's being rolled out so we can finally learn
[2:36:41.260 --> 2:36:48.260]  more from Twyla Brays president of Citizens Council for Health Freedom CCHF
[2:36:48.260 --> 2:36:55.580]  freedom.com cchfreedom.org cchfreedom.org we'll put it up on screen for
[2:36:55.580 --> 2:37:00.380]  folks and she breaks it down and then there's the political ramifications of
[2:37:00.380 --> 2:37:04.220]  them having all your medical records and sharing them using that to then get
[2:37:04.220 --> 2:37:09.860]  into school records work records the fines the fees the IRS over it I mean
[2:37:09.860 --> 2:37:13.420]  we've seen how they've persecuted people with the federal elections commissions
[2:37:13.420 --> 2:37:20.340]  with the IRS this is a bunch of kleptocrats running our lives again
[2:37:20.340 --> 2:37:24.580]  Twyla Brays thank you for joining us president of Citizens Council for Health
[2:37:24.580 --> 2:37:29.180]  Freedom break down exactly what they're rolling out under the nightmare that is
[2:37:29.180 --> 2:37:35.300]  Obamacare well thank you so much Alex for having me the biosurveillance
[2:37:35.300 --> 2:37:44.540]  strategy actually started way back in 2002 2004 2006 one law after the next
[2:37:44.540 --> 2:37:50.940]  after 9-11 but in 2006 they said there needs to be a national security I'm
[2:37:50.940 --> 2:37:56.780]  sorry a national health security strategy and so they put that into law and
[2:37:56.780 --> 2:38:01.060]  they said that the department has to do this the Department of Health and Human
[2:38:01.060 --> 2:38:08.180]  Services so they have been working and I think I think this is why President
[2:38:08.180 --> 2:38:13.700]  Obama in the recovery act which you may recall was passed less than a month after
[2:38:13.700 --> 2:38:19.100]  his inauguration so this economic stimulus bill it mandates that all
[2:38:19.100 --> 2:38:25.220]  doctors hospitals everyone that takes care of you in any way has to have an
[2:38:25.220 --> 2:38:30.860]  electronic medical record or face penalties for Medicare and so I really
[2:38:30.860 --> 2:38:36.460]  think they have said already that this was the foundation of Obamacare so they
[2:38:36.460 --> 2:38:40.620]  needed to have this in place first they needed to have this foundation of
[2:38:40.620 --> 2:38:44.140]  computerized health data first and then they can order you to do the type of
[2:38:44.140 --> 2:38:48.460]  care they want making Obama and the socialist your doctor that's right but
[2:38:48.460 --> 2:38:55.140]  and that's true about this that the the strategy goes further so what they'll
[2:38:55.140 --> 2:38:58.380]  tell you about the strategy and we had somebody who called us and said they
[2:38:58.380 --> 2:39:02.140]  called the department and the department said it's not what you think it is and
[2:39:02.140 --> 2:39:05.620]  so she called me and said well what well who should I believe right so I
[2:39:05.620 --> 2:39:09.420]  actually read her some pieces on a strategy and it became clear to her who
[2:39:09.420 --> 2:39:14.980]  she should believe that it is this big surveillance program and it's not just
[2:39:14.980 --> 2:39:18.940]  it's surveillance in your medical records and they'll tell you it's because of
[2:39:18.940 --> 2:39:23.860]  on pandemics and bioterrorism and they they need to protect us against these
[2:39:23.860 --> 2:39:29.700]  kind of incidents but what it says is that they wanted their objectives is to
[2:39:29.700 --> 2:39:35.580]  build and sustain health resilience to strengthen and sustain individual health
[2:39:35.580 --> 2:39:41.140]  and well-being on an ongoing basis this is everybody getting a globalist
[2:39:41.140 --> 2:39:48.700]  eugenics welfare social worker right and they want to have data shared on you
[2:39:48.700 --> 2:39:55.700]  collected analyzed interpreted shared from multiple sources before during and
[2:39:55.700 --> 2:39:59.900]  after any kind of incident with negative health consequences well you know
[2:39:59.900 --> 2:40:06.900]  that is as that's as big as the world that you know this is just a a plan to
[2:40:06.900 --> 2:40:11.260]  use our medical records to track us to track our doctors to make sure we're
[2:40:11.260 --> 2:40:15.340]  healthy to find out what our behaviors are to find out you know what kind of
[2:40:15.340 --> 2:40:20.780]  food we eat and the claim it's all legal it's an it's basically an NSA total
[2:40:20.780 --> 2:40:27.140]  surveillance legalization well when you look at the roadmap when you look at
[2:40:27.140 --> 2:40:31.340]  their biosurveillance roadmap there are many documents and biosurveillance the
[2:40:31.340 --> 2:40:35.940]  strategy strategy is just one of them but the strategy incorporates the
[2:40:35.940 --> 2:40:40.500]  national biosurveillance strategy and it incorporates a biosurveillance road
[2:40:40.500 --> 2:40:46.220]  map and in the road map there's the list of all the involved agencies and one
[2:40:46.220 --> 2:40:50.340]  thing to understand about this whole initiative is it's not just human health
[2:40:50.340 --> 2:40:57.020]  it's also plant health and animal health so they want this surveillance to be
[2:40:57.020 --> 2:41:01.660]  broad-scale and they're going to come by yeah let's say that again that's part of
[2:41:01.660 --> 2:41:05.180]  the premises is part of the premises ID it's part of taking over the farms the
[2:41:05.180 --> 2:41:12.740]  branches but also your dogs and cats right yeah yeah that's correct so you
[2:41:12.740 --> 2:41:17.580]  know we we just looked at it and said you know this is huge this is part of a
[2:41:17.580 --> 2:41:21.260]  very big scheme but the interesting thing is of course they haven't yet
[2:41:21.260 --> 2:41:27.780]  accomplished it this is a strategy when we look at the GAO report from 2010 one
[2:41:27.780 --> 2:41:31.860]  of the things that they say is one it hasn't been accomplished and two the
[2:41:31.860 --> 2:41:36.580]  pieces that they have tried different biosensors you know to sense the air or
[2:41:36.580 --> 2:41:40.260]  you know to sense different environmental things out there they're all
[2:41:40.260 --> 2:41:45.140]  either ineffective or they're very limited in where they can even be and
[2:41:45.140 --> 2:41:50.100]  let's be clear it mandates and they're costly incredible but I mean you're
[2:41:50.100 --> 2:41:54.660]  talking about a total full spectrum power grab with fear mongering sensors
[2:41:54.660 --> 2:42:00.380]  put up in all the cities to create a new type of federal watch system to create
[2:42:00.380 --> 2:42:05.460]  hypochondria which they can then be the saviors of it's like a new global warming
[2:42:05.460 --> 2:42:10.460]  hooks on top of it this is this is a total takeover it's all on the basis of
[2:42:10.460 --> 2:42:15.460]  health you know anything in your office anything in your home anything in the
[2:42:15.460 --> 2:42:19.860]  air can impact your health and so when you start using health as the guys or the
[2:42:19.860 --> 2:42:25.140]  basis for these kind of things there's no end to it everything can impact your
[2:42:25.140 --> 2:42:28.580]  health including your friendships including the job you choose it's the
[2:42:28.580 --> 2:42:34.380]  ultimate mission creep right it is an amazing mission to put all based on 9
[2:42:34.380 --> 2:42:38.020]  11 and so-called protect us but it's nothing about protecting us and when
[2:42:38.020 --> 2:42:42.020]  you look at the strategy as well one of the things they advocate is that
[2:42:42.020 --> 2:42:46.940]  everyone has to have access to health insurance and health care so this is
[2:42:46.940 --> 2:42:52.580]  not only about tracking us but about making sure that we're all in the system
[2:42:52.580 --> 2:42:56.660]  it's about universal health and let me add the next cuz you're the expert on
[2:42:56.660 --> 2:43:01.580]  this go for us ma'am and again we have the head of cchfreedom.org
[2:43:01.580 --> 2:43:05.900]  president of citizens council for health freedom who I see in the wall street
[2:43:05.900 --> 2:43:09.500]  journal you name it you know digging through this monstrous bill and breaking
[2:43:09.500 --> 2:43:14.700]  it down you're covering what it does to people but but the way it goes in and
[2:43:14.700 --> 2:43:19.540]  doesn't let doctors be doctors anymore and basically turns because Obama said
[2:43:19.540 --> 2:43:23.620]  this at White House dot gov I have the article right here he said this of five
[2:43:23.620 --> 2:43:29.760]  years ago they said the VA it will be the model of Obamacare well all the
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:35.100]  veterans we've talked to say since they put this system in at the VA it is 10
[2:43:35.100 --> 2:43:41.660]  times worse right I mean when you look at the VA you should look behind it and
[2:43:41.660 --> 2:43:49.140]  see Obamacare as in this is the VA today it will be Obamacare tomorrow because
[2:43:49.140 --> 2:43:53.180]  the whole plan here with Obamacare with this file surveillance is all about
[2:43:53.180 --> 2:43:57.380]  controlling it's about controlling healthcare and when you look at the
[2:43:57.380 --> 2:44:03.660]  Obamacare bill or I'm sorry the Obamacare law you see a lot of pieces of
[2:44:03.660 --> 2:44:09.500]  control including always data because data is a tool of control we like to
[2:44:09.500 --> 2:44:13.500]  say he who holds the data makes the rules if you don't hold your data
[2:44:13.500 --> 2:44:18.180]  private they will use your data against you and clearly if they have all of this
[2:44:18.180 --> 2:44:22.260]  then they can control the doctors now I don't know if you know about what we
[2:44:22.260 --> 2:44:29.220]  call the 23 scary words in Obamacare yes tell us those 23 scary words are this
[2:44:29.220 --> 2:44:34.460]  phrase it's a tiny little phrase in Obamacare but what it does is it gives
[2:44:34.460 --> 2:44:39.740]  the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to blacklist
[2:44:39.740 --> 2:44:45.580]  any doctor from all health plans no no my dad calls it my dad calls it the death
[2:44:45.580 --> 2:44:49.820]  penalty because it just gives them imperial power to do whatever they
[2:44:49.820 --> 2:44:55.260]  want right it says if you do not as a physician or as any kind of a health
[2:44:55.260 --> 2:45:01.300]  care provider if you do not provide health care quality as defined and
[2:45:01.300 --> 2:45:05.500]  determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services she can tell every
[2:45:05.500 --> 2:45:10.260]  health plan in the entire country every insurance company in the entire country
[2:45:10.260 --> 2:45:15.060]  not to do business with you it's sudden death no judge and no jury that's it
[2:45:15.060 --> 2:45:20.980]  the North Korean level dictatorial power it is a complete shutdown and let's
[2:45:20.980 --> 2:45:25.620]  just say that you're a two-year position like you've just gotten out right
[2:45:25.620 --> 2:45:29.340]  your bill is a hundred and seventy five thousand dollars that you have to pay
[2:45:29.340 --> 2:45:36.420]  back or more slow yeah I know but we'll go with primary care and and you have to
[2:45:36.420 --> 2:45:40.420]  pay that much back and you decided to treat a patient like you decided that
[2:45:40.420 --> 2:45:45.220]  patient should be treated and you looked at that protocol on the screen and you
[2:45:45.220 --> 2:45:49.700]  said no this is never going to work I am not going to do that and you did that
[2:45:49.700 --> 2:45:54.220]  to several different patients and the department who's tracking you says you
[2:45:54.220 --> 2:45:59.140]  know this is one of those obstinate non-compliant doctors I am going to
[2:45:59.140 --> 2:46:03.860]  threaten him that no health plan will be able to contract with him and therefore
[2:46:03.860 --> 2:46:08.500]  he will be stuck listen listen the state boards in Texas have already been
[2:46:08.500 --> 2:46:11.020]  following the Obamacare even though they claim they were gonna opt out but then
[2:46:11.020 --> 2:46:16.820]  didn't and they're already using this as a precedent to have their own sudden
[2:46:16.820 --> 2:46:21.260]  death or death penalty where they just say we say you did something wrong to
[2:46:21.260 --> 2:46:27.180]  huge practices and are literally grabbing of their bank accounts yeah
[2:46:27.180 --> 2:46:31.340]  well you know this is taking all the power away from the doctor and the
[2:46:31.340 --> 2:46:37.780]  patient and that's what the whole plan here is the doctor becomes a slave as it
[2:46:37.780 --> 2:46:43.380]  were a fairly well-paid slave and the patient just becomes someone who is
[2:46:43.380 --> 2:46:48.340]  subservient to the entire system not able to access anything unless somebody
[2:46:48.340 --> 2:46:52.060]  else tells them somebody else doesn't like what their lifestyle is somebody
[2:46:52.060 --> 2:46:56.660]  else doesn't like what their disease is somebody says that meant is too expensive
[2:46:56.660 --> 2:47:03.220]  or you're too old or the child too young or you know whatever what do you expect
[2:47:03.220 --> 2:47:08.900]  to happen then as this monstrosity phases in and it's so unpopular 80% many
[2:47:08.900 --> 2:47:12.380]  polls and the Republican leadership won't get rid of it because the same
[2:47:12.380 --> 2:47:17.740]  special interest that all the Democrats on them what do you expect to happen well
[2:47:17.740 --> 2:47:24.300]  I expect that we will repeal Obamacare I expect that to happen I expect I don't
[2:47:24.300 --> 2:47:27.620]  know how it will happen but it has to happen otherwise we don't have a country
[2:47:27.620 --> 2:47:32.700]  that we can still call America as a land of the free and so we have to repeal
[2:47:32.700 --> 2:47:38.140]  Obamacare but in the meantime I think there will be a lot of people who will
[2:47:38.140 --> 2:47:43.940]  suffer they may not hit VA status right but they're already hitting narrow
[2:47:43.940 --> 2:47:48.740]  networks you know limited access to doctors doctors are already deciding to
[2:47:48.740 --> 2:47:53.180]  leave doctors are deciding not to take more Medicare patients not to take any
[2:47:53.180 --> 2:47:58.140]  Medicaid patients not to take any Obamacare patients all of these patients
[2:47:58.140 --> 2:48:02.700]  are suddenly going to figure out that they have this thing called coverage
[2:48:02.700 --> 2:48:08.660]  which is a promise without any guarantee of access and so there's just going to
[2:48:08.660 --> 2:48:13.220]  be more and more consternation and when I see things like what President Obama
[2:48:13.220 --> 2:48:18.940]  did or his administration did in the new rules that just came out the 400 and
[2:48:18.940 --> 2:48:22.980]  some page rule what they said people are calling it a bailout but it's really not
[2:48:22.980 --> 2:48:27.580]  a bailout it's really a smokescreen they're telling the health insurance if
[2:48:27.580 --> 2:48:33.140]  you'll just keep the rates of premiums low we'll find money to pay you for the
[2:48:33.140 --> 2:48:38.860]  next three years so in other words until the next president right and so until
[2:48:38.860 --> 2:48:42.220]  the next president is elected of course and I think that's because they want to
[2:48:42.220 --> 2:48:46.260]  have Democrats in power and I think they would love to turn Obamacare into
[2:48:46.260 --> 2:48:49.740]  single-payer and if they get enough consternation built they're probably
[2:48:49.740 --> 2:48:54.700]  hoping that's how they can turn the ship but we who know that freedom is the
[2:48:54.700 --> 2:48:59.300]  best way that patients can be treated the best way that doctors are free to
[2:48:59.300 --> 2:49:04.460]  find excellence and use excellence we know that we have to turn it the other
[2:49:04.460 --> 2:49:10.180]  way we have to go back to freedom we have to get people away from Medicare I'd
[2:49:10.180 --> 2:49:15.340]  like never to have a Medicare card in my life I'd like the coming generations to
[2:49:15.340 --> 2:49:19.860]  have private insurance all the way to the end of their days I prefer an
[2:49:19.860 --> 2:49:24.380]  insurance policy that starts at birth or before and it's and you don't have to
[2:49:24.380 --> 2:49:29.020]  worry about pre-existing conditions that's what we have to turn turn this
[2:49:29.020 --> 2:49:34.900]  the other way around as the American public gets more and more agitated over
[2:49:34.900 --> 2:49:39.860]  the fallout of Obamacare well when you've got it's the arrogance when you've
[2:49:39.860 --> 2:49:44.060]  got Ezekiel Emanuel who brags he helped write the bill saying it's meant to
[2:49:44.060 --> 2:49:48.500]  wreck American healthcare that's an admission of a criminal conspiracy to
[2:49:48.500 --> 2:49:52.820]  to wreck an existing system so you can run the new one and I just don't get the
[2:49:52.820 --> 2:49:57.340]  hubris of Bill Press saying it's the law it's wonderful or deluge a generous
[2:49:57.340 --> 2:50:02.900]  thing to Obama everyone loves it everyone should thank you I mean are is
[2:50:02.900 --> 2:50:06.420]  this some type of propaganda in your view or are they totally delusional well
[2:50:06.420 --> 2:50:10.900]  I was just going to say that that's the art of propaganda the art of propaganda
[2:50:10.900 --> 2:50:14.500]  of course is staying something over and over and over until people believe it
[2:50:14.500 --> 2:50:18.220]  and this of course is what they want people to believe and those who know
[2:50:18.220 --> 2:50:21.820]  that the Democrats are threatened by what's happening with Obamacare when it
[2:50:21.820 --> 2:50:27.140]  comes to the next two elections they're very much in jeopardy they want everyone
[2:50:27.140 --> 2:50:31.300]  to believe that Obamacare is the best thing that ever happened sure so it's a
[2:50:31.300 --> 2:50:36.900]  confidence game they have to say it so it's a confidence game right right but
[2:50:36.900 --> 2:50:42.300]  the reality the reality is coming and their reality cannot be stopped it's
[2:50:42.300 --> 2:50:46.580]  just a matter of when that reality comes and that reality will arrive on the
[2:50:46.580 --> 2:50:50.940]  doorsteps of every American man and woman and child well you're a top
[2:50:50.940 --> 2:50:54.260]  expert of this come back and tell us what as best you understand how bad it's
[2:50:54.260 --> 2:50:57.860]  gonna be because it's designed to wreck the country and blow up healthcare they
[2:50:57.860 --> 2:51:01.220]  admit that so how do they think they're gonna get away with it that's that's a

[2:54:08.060 --> 2:54:12.060]  and I painted my hands and my face
[2:54:16.060 --> 2:54:22.700]  I'm gonna do five minutes overdrive and try to jam in Joe, David, Tim and
[2:54:22.700 --> 2:54:26.180]  cyberbully I'll give each person one minute sorry to rich I just don't have time
[2:54:26.180 --> 2:54:32.660]  to get to you finishing up here right now with our guest while
[2:54:32.660 --> 2:54:36.180]  a braze the president of citizens council for health freedom one of the
[2:54:36.180 --> 2:54:40.100]  groups oft quoted to going over obama care I mean I've read over the sub
[2:54:40.100 --> 2:54:43.420]  sections of the bill I've seen it I see it being implemented as an employer I
[2:54:43.420 --> 2:54:46.780]  see it happening and they go on the news and say there's on a $5,000 fine per
[2:54:46.780 --> 2:54:50.860]  employee they don't get it Matt drudge is lying when it's there and starts this
[2:54:50.860 --> 2:54:57.060]  year and next year so again there is this stonewalling but I've been at the
[2:54:57.060 --> 2:55:02.140]  clinic you know when people Democrats are coming in going why is this more now
[2:55:02.140 --> 2:55:07.300]  they're like sorry it's obama care and it raised payroll taxes on poor people I
[2:55:07.300 --> 2:55:13.780]  mean it's so bad Twila that I have trouble believing they would even pass
[2:55:13.780 --> 2:55:18.420]  something like this what's wrong with them because I mean do they just think
[2:55:18.420 --> 2:55:24.540]  we're so pathetic that there's nothing we can do no I think when you want
[2:55:24.540 --> 2:55:27.940]  control you know that you have to get control of people's health would get
[2:55:27.940 --> 2:55:31.620]  control of their life and which encourages them to vote for you more
[2:55:31.620 --> 2:55:36.860]  often and so you know one of the things when we look at what to do as we look at
[2:55:36.860 --> 2:55:41.620]  obama care and we say what is it Achilles heel it has one and that's
[2:55:41.620 --> 2:55:47.020]  Achilles heel is the exchange and so whether it is the healthcare.gov or
[2:55:47.020 --> 2:55:50.540]  whether it's the one at the state level they're all part of the same national
[2:55:50.540 --> 2:55:55.120]  exchange and they are considered the heart of healthcare reform it is the
[2:55:55.120 --> 2:55:59.820]  centerpiece it is the way that the IRS will track us it's the way that they'll
[2:55:59.820 --> 2:56:04.380]  figure out our our insurance status it's the way that they'll gather money to
[2:56:04.380 --> 2:56:08.860]  keep obama care going therefore it is the way they intend to set up the system
[2:56:08.860 --> 2:56:13.660]  as a single-seller system before they move it to single-payer and so you have
[2:56:13.660 --> 2:56:18.460]  to attack the Achilles heel so that's part of our refuse to enroll campaign
[2:56:18.460 --> 2:56:23.900]  refuse to enroll.org and we have a we have a opt-out declaration we have
[2:56:23.900 --> 2:56:27.860]  sheets that for you so people like Matt Drudge are doing the right thing and
[2:56:27.860 --> 2:56:32.380]  they're just gonna pay the fines the Democrats then say doesn't exist right
[2:56:32.380 --> 2:56:36.660]  yeah but what about getting lawyers and finding the fine there are things that
[2:56:36.660 --> 2:56:41.020]  have to happen but I think we they know that they need people in the exchange and
[2:56:41.020 --> 2:56:45.100]  so our tactic is to try and keep people out of these things and even if you have
[2:56:45.100 --> 2:56:49.780]  to pay a fine you know it might be worth it for a few years until we can shut
[2:56:49.780 --> 2:56:53.020]  the thing down and shutting the thing down means shutting down the exchanges
[2:56:53.020 --> 2:56:57.380]  and shutting down the exchanges is as easy as getting people not to enroll in
[2:56:57.380 --> 2:57:02.500]  them or to disenroll once they're in there so we have refuse to enroll.org
[2:57:02.500 --> 2:57:11.540]  and we encourage people to do exactly that. And isn't it good news that their
[2:57:11.540 --> 2:57:15.700]  system has been so incredibly corrupt and out of control that most people can't
[2:57:15.700 --> 2:57:19.820]  even sign up for it to begin with I mean I've got to say it's spectacularly
[2:57:19.820 --> 2:57:24.180]  falling on its face but they just keep the cult thing going like Hitler and
[2:57:24.180 --> 2:57:29.420]  the bunker on MSNBC and CNN that everyone loves it it's perfect it's a
[2:57:29.420 --> 2:57:33.220]  conspiracy theory that it's not perfect you're racist if you don't like it like
[2:57:33.220 --> 2:57:37.620]  Senator Jay Rockefeller said I mean they seem to be doubling down on this. Well
[2:57:37.620 --> 2:57:41.820]  it's timing right if they can keep this thing going if they can find money from
[2:57:41.820 --> 2:57:45.540]  wherever even though the US House refuses to give it to them if they can get
[2:57:45.540 --> 2:57:51.220]  states to pony up money to say well you know you don't have an exchange your
[2:57:51.220 --> 2:57:55.540]  people are using our federal one and so now you have to pay us money if they can
[2:57:55.540 --> 2:57:59.980]  do that and they can just keep this thing rolling along in time to like change
[2:57:59.980 --> 2:58:04.260]  the house or you know keep Democrats in the power so that it just stays in stays
[2:58:04.260 --> 2:58:08.860]  and stays in they'll get it embedded right they want it embedded we want it
[2:58:08.860 --> 2:58:15.260]  never we want it imploded that's what we want imploded and so you know they're
[2:58:15.260 --> 2:58:20.700]  racing to get people into it we're racing to get people out of it and so you
[2:58:20.700 --> 2:58:25.060]  know it just becomes a matter of time they want all the time that they can get
[2:58:25.060 --> 2:58:29.940]  to keep it in place and we're trying to say no no no we're gonna stand up and
[2:58:29.940 --> 2:58:33.460]  this thing is going to be gone absolutely I'm not buying it I'm not
[2:58:33.460 --> 2:58:37.780]  buying it I'm not gonna pay the fee the fine I'm gonna sue the IRS and sue
[2:58:37.780 --> 2:58:41.700]  Obama personally thank you so much ma'am great job have a great weekend I'll be

[3:01:10.620 --> 3:01:17.460]  it's just he's lying about us all the time and I'm getting tired of it and it's
[3:01:17.460 --> 3:01:22.500]  government talking points I gotta tell people the truth I'm he makes fun of me
[3:01:22.500 --> 3:01:26.220]  it says there's nobody ever worked at the CIA here and it's like on the bio on
[3:01:26.220 --> 3:01:32.100]  their page I mean I just whoa freaks me out and I hope he's just scared me in a
[3:01:32.100 --> 3:01:37.140]  jerk I hope he's not an actual operative but it doesn't look good I'm just telling
[3:01:37.140 --> 3:01:42.460]  the truth I just it's bad he's gonna continue doing it I think my gut tells
[3:01:42.460 --> 3:01:46.460]  me I can't believe it that's just it's not a good thing for all of us and he
[3:01:46.460 --> 3:01:50.580]  attacks me right now folks it'll be the whole Liberty movement at Key junctures
[3:01:50.580 --> 3:01:55.180]  he bears watching let's go ahead and talk to David in Kansas you're on the air
[3:01:55.180 --> 3:02:02.660]  go ahead it's amazing that everybody that has spoken with you today agrees and I
[3:02:02.660 --> 3:02:08.780]  agree 100% with him with everything that you do thank you very much your
[3:02:08.780 --> 3:02:15.980]  products are outstanding I'm a hero billboard I wear all of your shirts that
[3:02:15.980 --> 3:02:22.340]  I got right at the moment but my question for you is in the state of Kansas the
[3:02:22.340 --> 3:02:28.900]  governor or not the governor the Attorney General has made it quite easy for a
[3:02:28.900 --> 3:02:33.580]  lot of the citizens to get their concealed carry do you think they are
[3:02:33.580 --> 3:02:40.700]  possibly doing this to find out who the true gun owners are for the people who
[3:02:40.700 --> 3:02:43.980]  have their concealed you know they like to get people in there like it's a
[3:02:43.980 --> 3:02:47.180]  privilege to have it they can revoke it later but the culture is growing so fast
[3:02:47.180 --> 3:02:52.420]  I've changed my view of concealed carry permits it's just it's helped mainline
[3:02:52.420 --> 3:02:56.620]  it maybe people feel secure to carry guns it's got its problems I know a lot
[3:02:56.620 --> 3:02:59.540]  of state reps congressmen and women and people behind the scenes that don't even
[3:02:59.540 --> 3:03:04.740]  come on the show because a listeners don't really want to hear them be it
[3:03:04.740 --> 3:03:09.300]  just gives them political trouble but there are a lot of good people in
[3:03:09.300 --> 3:03:15.540]  government in fact statistically I've said this the military is more awake in
[3:03:15.540 --> 3:03:18.300]  the public the police are more awake it's just they've got so much authority
[3:03:18.300 --> 3:03:21.620]  when they do bad stuff it's really bad it's the people at the top that are bad
[3:03:21.620 --> 3:03:25.740]  so I think the loosening of concealed carry laws is a very positive thing
[3:03:25.740 --> 3:03:29.220]  there's a lot of good people at the state level that's why the feds are moving
[3:03:29.220 --> 3:03:32.540]  to block the states
[3:03:33.380 --> 3:03:38.380]  that's I bless you brother no this is look if good people stand up and start
[3:03:38.380 --> 3:03:44.020]  saying no it's over so I appreciate your call great points Tim in Florida let's

[3:03:48.660 --> 3:03:52.740]  lot about spiritual things and yesterday I had an epiphany and I'm thinking you
[3:03:52.740 --> 3:03:56.660]  know God created heaven and earth you know what it's Satan create and I'm
[3:03:56.660 --> 3:04:01.100]  thinking you know oil they use it to take our money when oil burns it burns in
[3:04:01.100 --> 3:04:06.780]  the carbon or hydrogen monoxide which kills you water burns as hydrogen and it
[3:04:06.780 --> 3:04:10.940]  turns back into water if it's not burn or nothing else if it is and it's just
[3:04:10.940 --> 3:04:15.100]  I was trying to think of what what you know what is it that Satan creates and I
[3:04:15.100 --> 3:04:19.780]  just I just thought Satan Satan takes things that already exist twist it into
[3:04:19.780 --> 3:04:26.740]  an evil bizarro world doppelganger and what I told my wife and children about
[3:04:26.740 --> 3:04:29.700]  this last night at dinner I said you guys don't think I'm crazy for what I'm
[3:04:29.700 --> 3:04:34.300]  about to say and my wife my 16 year old looks at me and she says and they don't
[3:04:34.300 --> 3:04:38.020]  mix immediately she said that I was like wow water and oil don't mix well I'll
[3:04:38.020 --> 3:04:41.700]  tell you water powered energy be a lot better than oil I hear you brother
