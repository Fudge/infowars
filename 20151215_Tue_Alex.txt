[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Stand by Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:11.000 --> 00:12.000]  You want answers?
[00:12.000 --> 00:13.000]  So do I.
[00:13.000 --> 00:14.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:14.000 --> 00:23.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.000 --> 00:29.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this live.
[00:29.000 --> 00:35.000]  Worldwide Tuesday edition, the 15th day of December, 2015.
[00:35.000 --> 00:40.000]  We have Wayne Madsen joining us, investigative journals with big breaking news on the campaign trail.
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  Michael Springman, former head of the Jetta visa section, to deal with all the visa news,
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  how terrorists and others are being given visas into the United States coming up.
[00:49.000 --> 00:57.000]  We have California's one of its largest schools shut down today because of unspecified terrorist threat
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  that supposedly came over, that references the TV show Homeland.
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.000]  And also, New York schools are looking at shutting down right now.
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.000]  Talk about the wicked flea when none pursue.
[01:08.000 --> 01:16.000]  They open the borders up, bring in the terrorist, and then we become a basically catatonic fetal position society
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  teaching our children how to get in fetal positions and be shot in the head.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  So that is all coming up.
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  But first, John Bowne looks at the biggest salt, the middle class, the latter out of being poor,
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  so you can be independent, being destroyed.
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  President Obama's record breaking national debt.
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  Increasing Obamacare tax penalties and premiums, blue collar depleting trade deals,
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.000]  and overall Salinsky-esque tactics are demolishing the American middle class
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  as we near the finish line of Obama's two terms.
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  The only change we've experienced is a totalitarian transformation of the presidential office
[02:02.000 --> 02:10.000]  begun by his criminal counterparts that have continuously seized the throne since JFK was gunned down in Dallas.
[02:10.000 --> 02:19.000]  Breitbart reports Pew Research found that the share of American adults living in middle income households
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  has fallen from 61% in 1971 to 50% in 2015.
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  The share living in the upper income tier rose from 14% to 21% over the same period.
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  Meanwhile, the share in the lower income tier increased from 25% to 29%.
[02:38.000 --> 02:47.000]  Manufacturing accounted for 26% of employed adults in 1971, compared with 11% in 2014.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  A Gallup poll discovered that since the year 2000 through 2008,
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  10% of middle class to upper middle class of Americans transferred into the lower class.
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  62% of Americans have under $1,000 in savings.
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  Meanwhile, Obamacare will raise the penalty next year by 50% for not participating to $1,000,
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  just to make sure that anybody struggling can't get ahead.
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  So their goal has always been to eliminate the middle class, raise taxes,
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  give away their health care to poor and illegals, flood the country with immigrants,
[03:24.000 --> 03:31.000]  degrade our position abroad, do everything they can to eliminate the foundation of what supports
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.000]  the free market system, and that is the only threat to their having a permanent hold on power.
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  The goal is to keep a permanent hold on power.
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  When I grew up, I guess it was years before you grew up,
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  but we had a country of middle class families who had intact nuclear families.
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.000]  That is, the mother and father were married to each other and raising their own children in one household.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  And now, that's just the minority of people in our country.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  But the nuclear family was a self-contained economic unit.
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  They spent their own money, made their own decisions,
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  decided how they were going to raise their children.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  The now pseudo-privileged financially doomed millennial generation
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  has proclaimed the death of the American dream, according to a Harvard poll.
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.000]  Blindly throwing their collective votes towards the socialist promises of Bernie Sanders
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  out of total desperation.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  The millennial generation workforce still makes up 40% of the unemployed.
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  This generation will overtake the baby boomer generation
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  as the nation's largest living population approaching 75 million strong.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  A generation that will inherit the mind-controlling PC culture,
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  dwindling middle class numbers,
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  Obamacare penalties and rate hikes,
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.000]  and crippling student debt. If you thought the middle class was in trouble now,
[04:56.000 --> 05:25.000]  you ain't seen nothin' yet, John.
[05:26.000 --> 05:31.000]  The report states that about 95% of the students at Brooklyn's PS169
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  are either Hispanic or Asian.
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  In the assistant principal announced last month
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  that the school is changing its holiday traditions to be
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  sensitive to the diversity of our families.
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.000]  Not all children celebrate the same holidays, he added.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  And the pledge of allegiance was also ditched when the principal took office.
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.000] .com
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.000]  Globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula
[06:33.000 --> 06:37.000]  with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.

[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  and powerful calming formula out there,

[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  our latest release, Winner's Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[07:09.000 --> 07:14.000]  Winner's Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.000]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient dense plants known as lichens.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.

[07:32.000 --> 07:35.000]  The research and development took over two years,
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  but the result, as verified by independent laboratories,
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.

[07:46.000 --> 07:49.000]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood,
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[07:54.000 --> 08:00.000]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  It's never going to get any better.
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  Don't look for it. Be happy with what you got.
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.000]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.000]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.000]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  and make all the important decisions.
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  Forget the politicians.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  You don't. You have no choice.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  You have owners. They own you.
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  They own everything.
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  They own all the important land.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  They own and control the corporations.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses,
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  they've got the judges in their back pockets, and they own all the big media companies
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  They got you by the balls.
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers.
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay,
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  the longer hours to reduce benefits, the end of overtime,
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  And now they're coming for your social security money
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  You better believe it.
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  So what specifically did they do?
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage,
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  I've given to just so you understand.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.000]  A lot of money.
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  You and I are not in the big club.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  It's called the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  But I'll tell you what, they don't want.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  That's against their interest.
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.000]  That's right.
[10:01.000 --> 10:08.000]  On the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  And that's George Carlin.
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.000]  Another great intro produced by InfoWars own Darren McBreen,
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  bringing us in to this live Tuesday, the 15th day of December,
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  global broadcast.
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  Hard to believe, again, that 2015 is almost over.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  But in just 15 and a half days, it will be history.
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  We will plunge into 2016, and even more critical developments
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  will clearly unfold as we plunge into world government.
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  You see, George Carlin was talking about how the owners, the globalist,
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  wanted dumbed down mindless poor servants decades ago.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  But the decision has been made, and it's been in Wired Magazine,
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  the New York Times, the Financial Times of London,
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  books by Ray Kurzweil and articles by Bill Joy.
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  And now it's pretty much in the news every day,
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  what I was talking about 18, 19 years ago.
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  The global architects are building a planet
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  and building a world system meant to phase out
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  90 plus percent of humanity as we know it.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  Now that's the public numbers.
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  Deeper internal discussions are about exterminating all humans
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  like a few mega super elites battling for control
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.000]  of the new AI consciousness over who will become God.
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  Ray Kurzweil is an atheist.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  He says he doesn't believe in God yet.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  Now, whether you believe they're going to be able to do this or not,
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  this is their idea.
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  This is what they're pushing.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  This is what they want.
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  This is what they discuss.
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  Elon Musk is in the news, and I'm not saying he's one of the bad ones.
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.000]  He's probably one of the better elites because he's new money.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  He's saying, hey, there's going to be a third world war.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  We're probably going to kill the planet.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  We've got to get space bases now.
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  We've got to get to Mars now.
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  Headline, Elon Musk worries third world war would ruin Mars' mission.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  Buddy, the weapons the Pentagon's got now,
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  as they can't test them, might blow up the whole solar system.
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  A-bombs were developed, the idea, the formulae in 1900 by Max Planck.
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  We're not in 1900.
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  You can blow up whole cities in 1900 with the equations.
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  The equations now blow up whole solar systems.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  It's called antimatter weapons.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  And it makes a hydrogen bomb look like a tinker toy.
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  It looks like a dart gun that a five-year-old has that shoots rubber darts at the stained glass window.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  And the Air Force had mentioned they've developed antimatter weapons.
[12:56.000 --> 13:03.000]  It's kind of like Putin will leak some nuclear submarine torpedo that can take out U.S. cities.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  He'll leak it on accident last month.
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  Well, the Pentagon's leaked antimatter weapons.
[13:10.000 --> 13:16.000]  The only problem is they can't control them and they can't test them.
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  And they have equations where they think they know what they'll do.
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.000]  Now, let's go ahead and just mention what's coming up in the news today.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  I think that's probably important to do right up front.
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  Michael Springman, who headed up the U.S. Visa Department in Saudi Arabia,
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  who exposed that they were ordered to let the hijackers into the United States
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  and were told that they were CIA officers.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  Not just assets, but members of the CIA.
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  The book is Visas for Al Qaeda, CIA handouts that rocked the world.
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  We sell the book at infowarsstore.com, I would add.
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  And why is that guess so important?
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  I'll explain that in a moment.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  Then Wayne Madsen with big election news joins us in the third hour.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  Jakari Jackson will be hosting the fourth hour today and he's got a big show.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  He's developing stuff before he comes on.
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  I'll give you a rundown of what's coming up in the fourth hour.
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  Then tonight, we'll have at least three hours of live coverage.
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.000]  And I intend to be part of the coverage tonight of the final Republican debate of 2015
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  from Las Vegas, Nevada, the big showdown between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump,
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  the media hyping it like a heavyweight championship.
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  Ted Cruz has basically had a couple knockouts and a couple technical knockouts
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  and has been knocked out himself.
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.000]  And then Donald Trump has equivalent to like 20 knockouts
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  and is a heavyweight champion if you want to compare their poll numbers.
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  But they're billing Cruz as if he's surging and could beat Trump
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  because they want that to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  I like Ted Cruz overall.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  I like 95% of what he stands for.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  Same thing with Donald Trump.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  There's some things I don't like.
[15:13.000 --> 15:25.000]  But I'll tell you, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, or Donald Trump are leagues, levels, dimensions, light years better
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  than a Hillary Clinton, a Bernie Sanders, or a Jeb Bush.
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.000]  I will not vote for any of those people and I will support third-party move
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.000]  because a Hillary getting in would be better than a Jeb Bush.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  Jeb Bush gets in, everybody goes, sleepy time like sleeping beauty,
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  and the whole agenda gets rammed through and we're done.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  He's roping borders, taking our guns, you name it.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  But a lot of Republicans just want to feel like they're on a winning team.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  They will go into sleeping time.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  They will go bye-bye.
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.000]  Hillary gets in.
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.000]  She's got so much baggage, so much corruption, Benghazi, all the rest of it,
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  that she will get impeached.
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  She will get destroyed.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  I know they'll play the whole feminine card that, oh, you don't like women.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  No, I love women.
[16:11.000 --> 16:16.000]  And I love women in positions of power if they're not criminal scumbag, crazy people.
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  And Hillary Clinton is probably one of the most evil women that has ever lived.
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.000]  What she did to Libya, what she's done to so many other countries,
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  what she did with the banker bailouts, how they engineered that when Clinton was in.
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  I mean, Clinton was running around having sex with women all day and hanging out with world leaders.
[16:31.000 --> 16:32.000]  I'm not saying he was a good guy.
[16:32.000 --> 16:33.000]  It was horrible.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  But Hillary was actually in there, haunt-showing stuff.
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  Hillary was basically president when Bill was in.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  She's the one that really calls the shots, that calls for the murders,
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  that covers up the rapes, that sells the missile secrets,
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.000]  that runs the State Department with billions of dollars coming in to give dictators weapons.
[16:52.000 --> 16:58.000]  I mean, she really is anathema to anything good and decent, so that's coming up.
[16:58.000 --> 17:05.000]  Tonight, 7 o'clock central, there'll be a big link at the top of infowars.com, a big banner,
[17:05.000 --> 17:12.000]  a big, I guess, chevron or symbol or logo up in the right-hand corner that you click to
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.000]  and go to a page where there'll be a free feed of the info wars expanded.
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.000]  Nightly news, it'll go for at least three hours, probably 7 to 10 tonight.
[17:22.000 --> 17:31.000]  I intend to be doing live reports just so it has a different flair from my home office.
[17:31.000 --> 17:38.000]  During the reports, I will be Skyping in to the show to comment.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  Joe Biggs will be going over Twitter and Facebook comments.
[17:41.000 --> 17:49.000]  Sobel Darren McBreen from one of the other studios, Jakari Jackson, David Knight, Leigh Ann McAdoo and others will be in here in the studio along with Rob Dube.
[17:49.000 --> 17:56.000]  And again, it will be the debate, but we talk over it, about half of it and analyze it in live time.
[17:56.000 --> 18:03.000]  That's how we can legally and lawfully do it, is because we are not entertainment, we are news gathering.
[18:03.000 --> 18:11.000]  And we're going to be analyzing the debate, the media propaganda, the spin, the questions in live time.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  Nobody else does this.
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  7 o'clock Central Standard Time tonight.
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.000]  And we also do analysis of State of the Union, many other events, others do that.
[18:20.000 --> 18:27.000]  All right, that said, Michael Springman, who headed up the U.S. Visa Department in the main Saudi Arabian office,
[18:27.000 --> 18:34.000]  will be joining us, author and constitutional lawyer, because look at these bombshells.
[18:34.000 --> 18:42.000]  Immigration officials prohibited from looking at visa applicants, social media, where they were saying,
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.000]  I'm going to carry out a Jihad, I've been in terror training camps, I pledge allegiance to ISIS.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  Folks, that's just not true.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  They track everything our reporters do.
[18:50.000 --> 18:57.000]  We try to go cover Jihad camps, Homeland Security's there, calling our folks up and telling them exactly where they are on what highway.
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  Because they're tracking their phones in real time.
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  They're tracking the vehicles in real time.
[19:01.000 --> 19:04.000]  They're tracking the car with license plate reading cameras.
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.000]  It's total horsemen there.
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.000]  They are tracking.
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  When they say they don't track, that's a lie.
[19:10.000 --> 19:18.000]  They had FBI agents on them, the both of them two years ago, tracking them for a year, and the Justice Department almost indicted them.
[19:18.000 --> 19:24.000]  It came out in the news last week, and it was looking at criminal charges against them, basically, and shut their investigation down.
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  The White House protects these people.
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  This is part of the plan.
[19:30.000 --> 19:36.000]  U.S. visas continue to be handled by foreign contractors.
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  Wayne Madsen, infowars.com story.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  That ties in with this, the Hill story.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  Here's another one, the biggest.
[19:43.000 --> 19:51.000]  Hackers trace ISIS Twitter accounts back to Internet addresses linked the Department of Work and Pensions, the U.K. government.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  And it's not just that they're in there using them.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  That's a government front.
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  The British government runs ISIS.
[19:57.000 --> 20:25.000]  It's well known.
[20:25.000 --> 20:41.000]  U.S.

[21:59.520 --> 22:02.920]  My name is Bill Bonner and I have an important message.
[22:02.920 --> 22:08.400]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis,
[22:08.400 --> 22:10.680]  but they're about to lose control.
[22:10.680 --> 22:16.200]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined, from where
[22:16.200 --> 22:20.280]  we shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect.
[22:20.280 --> 22:25.040]  Look, I've made predictions like this before, a few years ago I warned that the housing
[22:25.040 --> 22:26.960]  prices would collapse.
[22:26.960 --> 22:31.440]  Before that I warned that dot-com companies would crash and they did.
[22:31.440 --> 22:36.200]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock
[22:36.200 --> 22:37.200]  market.
[22:37.200 --> 22:38.600]  This will affect us all.

[24:19.040 --> 24:25.680]  No fly list is a total fraud and the North Carolina governor and others are coming out
[24:25.680 --> 24:30.840]  saying the feds won't tell us where or who they're bringing in to the United States and
[24:30.840 --> 24:35.640]  then they just disappear, even the ones that don't have visas.
[24:35.640 --> 24:37.960]  This is deliberate.
[24:37.960 --> 24:39.800]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[24:39.800 --> 24:43.760]  Immigration officials prohibited from looking at visa applicants social media.
[24:43.760 --> 24:50.760]  I knew ISIS was going to be big when they let them recruit in the U.S., the U.K., Germany
[24:50.760 --> 24:54.840]  and let them fly in and out of the countries and then tried a couple of years ago to go,
[24:54.840 --> 24:58.960]  oh, Jihad fighters are actually good, we need to rehabilitate them and bring them back into
[24:58.960 --> 25:04.240]  our countries because they were trying to PR, hey, how do we bring Al Qaeda back in?
[25:04.240 --> 25:05.680]  It's our proxy army.
[25:05.680 --> 25:06.680]  How do we fool folks?
[25:06.680 --> 25:11.480]  Well, we'll just say we're going to rehabilitate them when you give them tow missiles and stinger
[25:11.480 --> 25:15.280]  missiles and the rest of it and then you bring them back, let's select groups, blow
[25:15.280 --> 25:20.440]  stuff up and then you set up bigger homeland security systems to take all of our rights.
[25:20.440 --> 25:25.760]  You declare martial law in many countries of Europe and you arrest the conservative party
[25:25.760 --> 25:29.080]  leaders like Lapin that don't want to bring them in.
[25:29.080 --> 25:33.200]  But like I said, that's coming up in the next segment because hackers trace ISIS back to
[25:33.200 --> 25:34.960]  the U.S. government.
[25:34.960 --> 25:40.280]  That is mainstream news, the U.K. daily mirror.
[25:40.280 --> 25:42.360]  Isn't that just special?
[25:42.360 --> 25:44.560]  Isn't that just cupcake cute?
[25:44.560 --> 25:52.120]  And, of course, Turkey buys the oil and the United States bombs the Syrian military bases
[25:52.120 --> 25:58.080]  and the Turks attack with artillery and then they set up there and say, oh, we're battling
[25:58.080 --> 25:59.080]  ISIS.
[25:59.080 --> 26:01.600]  Yeah, you're their air force.
[26:01.600 --> 26:04.520]  And Turkey's now been in Iraq for a week and a half.
[26:04.520 --> 26:10.000]  They've invaded Iraq, they're bombing and attacking, blowing up Iraqi military, blowing
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.000]  up Kurds.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.240]  Yeah, it's just not even in our news.
[26:13.240 --> 26:22.920]  I mean, it's in the back of the paper, just, oh, hey, Turkey invaded because with the Russians
[26:22.920 --> 26:26.960]  and the Iranians, the Iraqis are beating Al Qaeda.
[26:26.960 --> 26:28.960]  You know them as ISIS.
[26:28.960 --> 26:29.960]  Said I'd cover this next segment.
[26:29.960 --> 26:30.960]  I just start talking about it.
[26:30.960 --> 26:38.920]  I have trouble not getting into it because it is such a raging ridiculousness.
[26:38.920 --> 26:46.400]  It is so unbelievable that our government started all this, destabilized Iraq, invaded
[26:46.400 --> 26:53.080]  Syria, blew up Libya, overthrew Egypt.
[26:53.080 --> 26:57.760]  And then our allies murdered every Christian that can get their hands on and blew up hundreds
[26:57.760 --> 27:02.960]  of churches, crucified Christians upside down, burned them in public, hung them, chopped
[27:02.960 --> 27:09.160]  their heads off and threw hundreds of homosexuals off high rooftops, that's how you're supposed
[27:09.160 --> 27:15.080]  to kill them, I guess, in some Islamic idea, in front of people on TV and not a word from
[27:15.080 --> 27:20.000]  Anderson Cooper, the gay rights activists from the CIA.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.920]  He would just go, they're not about how fabulous the demonstrators were and how fabulous their
[27:24.920 --> 27:26.400]  revolution was.
[27:26.400 --> 27:29.440]  This is who our government wants to put in.
[27:29.440 --> 27:30.440]  People that throw homosexuals.
[27:30.440 --> 27:35.280]  See, I'm not supposed to say homosexual, I'm supposed to talk like Anderson Cooper tells
[27:35.280 --> 27:40.160]  me to, not say heterosexual, not say homosexual, supposed to adopt all of his language, straight,
[27:40.160 --> 27:45.760]  gay, most of Harris Perry, Darth Vader's racist, brown bags are racist.
[27:45.760 --> 27:55.080]  When all the real stuff goes on, see, ISIS executes Ken in public for being homosexual,
[27:55.080 --> 27:56.680]  including boy, age 15.
[27:56.680 --> 28:02.200]  Yeah, that's just the latest, throwing them off rooftops, that was just one little execution,
[28:02.200 --> 28:05.560]  not a word from Gloria Steinem.
[28:05.560 --> 28:09.600]  If you don't teach your five-year-old how to be a homosexual, you're against gay people,
[28:09.600 --> 28:14.040]  according to these folks, but if you want to mutilate women, blow up churches, throw
[28:14.040 --> 28:20.880]  people off, that's kind of cute.
[28:20.880 --> 28:24.680]  But then coming up, I just want to say Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year coming up,
[28:24.680 --> 28:28.400]  because I used to hear this war on Christmas stuff 10 years ago and didn't believe it,
[28:28.400 --> 28:32.000]  and now they're taking the nativity signs out of people's own yards.
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.520]  People's churches are getting sued, not just government buildings, and now New York City
[28:35.520 --> 28:41.840]  Elementary Principal bans Christmas Thanksgiving Pledge of Allegiance.
[28:41.840 --> 28:45.240]  This is being reported on by New York Daily News, you name it, with a straight face.
[28:45.240 --> 28:48.040]  We definitely can't say Christmas, you can't say it.
[28:48.040 --> 28:51.960]  See, now it's extended to your free speech, of course you can say it.
[28:51.960 --> 28:56.400]  Nothing with Christmas on it, nothing with Santa who's not even Christian.
[28:56.400 --> 29:03.080]  He's a elf, and they have, the principal has banned it, saying, you know, the foreigners
[29:03.080 --> 29:07.360]  don't like it, but they can have all their celebrations, and meanwhile, a student gets
[29:07.360 --> 29:12.840]  six months' suspension for saying black women are not high in a response to a chat board
[29:12.840 --> 29:17.360]  where reportedly black students were saying that white people were hillbillies that have
[29:17.360 --> 29:20.960]  sex with their family members and have small genitals.
[29:20.960 --> 29:25.080]  And the school actually said, blacks are allowed to say that, whites can't even respond, and
[29:25.080 --> 29:27.800]  he was suspended for 20 months.
[29:27.800 --> 29:32.680]  When they proved that, 21 months, excuse me, when they proved that it was the black students
[29:32.680 --> 29:39.640]  doing it first, they said, well they're allowed to, but your suspension is only six months.
[29:39.640 --> 29:41.240]  How do you like that?
[29:41.240 --> 29:46.520]  It's only going to get better, folks, because this country is rotting like a big fat dead
[29:46.520 --> 30:16.000]  fish in the summer heat.
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.920]  All is not lost, though.
[30:17.920 --> 30:31.640]  Some are speaking on real issues.
[30:31.640 --> 30:34.800]  Will controversial statements impact some of the candidates?
[30:34.800 --> 30:40.640]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the
[30:40.640 --> 30:49.320]  United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
[30:49.320 --> 30:55.760]  Join InfoWars this Tuesday, December 15th, starting at 7 p.m. central for another episode
[30:55.760 --> 30:58.000]  of Political Science Theater 3K.
[30:58.000 --> 31:02.480]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[31:02.480 --> 31:07.720]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[31:07.720 --> 31:10.880]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[31:10.880 --> 31:16.160]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[31:16.160 --> 31:18.680]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[31:33.800 --> 31:37.480]  the new infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.

[31:42.560 --> 31:46.760]  extracted directly from the wild herb, and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[31:46.760 --> 31:50.560]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.

[31:58.680 --> 32:03.480]  My fellow patriots, one of the things I'm most proud of is the fact that the InfoWars
[32:03.480 --> 32:08.600]  operation reaches more than 20 million people a week worldwide with a message of liberty
[32:08.600 --> 32:13.360]  and none of it is funded by major global corporations or by taxpayers.
[32:13.360 --> 32:19.560]  It's funded by free will, listeners and viewers like you who decide to visit infowarsstore.com

[32:42.840 --> 32:44.200]  on and on.
[32:44.200 --> 32:50.560]  Some discounts are as high as 50% at infowarsstore.com on top of free shipping.
[32:50.560 --> 32:56.400]  Through December 18th, at infowarsstore.com and infowarslife.com and remember, InfoWars
[32:56.400 --> 33:11.440]  is the operation that you built.
[33:11.440 --> 33:21.520]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:21.520 --> 33:26.360]  Let's be clear, I'm not saying there isn't radical Islamic terror.
[33:26.360 --> 33:32.880]  What I'm saying is it's 100% proven in disgusting detail.
[33:32.880 --> 33:40.880]  In fact, it's not 100% proven, it's 360 proven because 100% is kind of a one or two dimensional
[33:40.880 --> 33:44.400]  statement depending on how you look at it.
[33:44.400 --> 33:51.400]  We've proven that Western criminal governments are running radical Islamic terror cells worldwide
[33:51.400 --> 33:54.360]  from a 360 perspective.
[33:54.360 --> 34:00.720]  They've been caught working with Shiite terrorists back to the 1970s and before as well, but
[34:00.720 --> 34:02.720]  not not running them.
[34:02.720 --> 34:13.360]  But when you talk about Sunni, Wahhabist, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, countries like that, 100%
[34:13.360 --> 34:15.720]  Western run and controlled and funded and protected.
[34:15.720 --> 34:20.680]  In fact, again, the proper term is 360.
[34:20.680 --> 34:27.240]  The whole thing from every angle like a 3D model, the creation, the funding, the training,
[34:27.240 --> 34:31.880]  the protection, the funding of the madrasas, the opening of the doors, the blocking the
[34:31.880 --> 34:40.720]  FBI, MI6, MI5 from stopping them, going after activists and journalists that expose them.
[34:40.720 --> 34:45.600]  You want all hell to break loose, try actually investigating radical jihadis in your country.
[34:45.600 --> 34:49.720]  The feds come after you instantly.
[34:49.720 --> 34:53.640]  And they're, we apologize, we don't want to do this, but they're not going to go well
[34:53.640 --> 34:58.600]  if you keep a higher ups and said, don't look into this.
[34:58.600 --> 35:05.400]  And what has come out from the San Bernardino attacks two weeks ago?
[35:05.400 --> 35:07.320]  The feds were directly on them.
[35:07.320 --> 35:08.840]  They knew where they'd been trained.
[35:08.840 --> 35:12.520]  They knew what they were planning and they were threatened by the Justice Department and
[35:12.520 --> 35:20.800]  investigated and looked at for being fired and criminal charges.
[35:20.800 --> 35:29.040]  Two different agents with the FBI, several with another DHS agency, it's all DHS to begin
[35:29.040 --> 35:30.040]  with.
[35:30.040 --> 35:34.920]  That was in mainstream news last week and that the FBI was told to get up for the first
[35:34.920 --> 35:41.160]  two days and say there's no terror relation connection until it turned out the FBI went
[35:41.160 --> 35:45.520]  to the president and said, we are a laughing stock.
[35:45.520 --> 35:53.000]  The bombs, the training, the, the tactical gear, the witnesses, they pledged allegiance
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.280]  on Facebook to ISIS.
[35:55.280 --> 36:00.280]  We look like idiots and the president was losing all credibility and cratering in the
[36:00.280 --> 36:01.280]  polls.
[36:01.280 --> 36:06.760]  So he had to go on Sunday night and say he was going to respond to it by taking your second
[36:06.760 --> 36:11.720]  amendment away and that he would defeat ISIS.
[36:11.720 --> 36:15.200]  And then yesterday comes out and speech and goes, we will continue the same policies that
[36:15.200 --> 36:20.120]  we had before, which is doing nothing.
[36:20.120 --> 36:23.360]  So I'm going to go over this here in just a moment.
[36:23.360 --> 36:27.040]  And while all of this is happening, House Republicans are having to propose a resolution
[36:27.040 --> 36:38.880]  defending Christmas because all over the country, they're actually telling people in public
[36:38.880 --> 36:42.440]  schools and colleges, you can't have a tree in your dorm.
[36:42.440 --> 36:44.160]  You can't have one in your room.
[36:44.160 --> 36:46.160]  You can't even talk about Christmas.
[36:46.160 --> 36:47.800]  You can't hand out Bibles.
[36:47.800 --> 36:50.400]  You have no free speech, but everyone else does.
[36:50.400 --> 36:52.000]  You can't hand out constitutions.
[36:52.000 --> 36:58.480]  I have seen more than 20-plus colleges in the last year, because I see it every week
[36:58.480 --> 37:06.560]  or so, arrest students that hand out pocket constitutions.
[37:06.560 --> 37:08.520]  Everybody else is allowed to hand out whatever they want.
[37:08.520 --> 37:13.920]  If it's seen as Americana or part of the American culture, it is banned.
[37:13.920 --> 37:14.920]  People go, this is outrageous.
[37:14.920 --> 37:15.920]  It's over the top.
[37:15.920 --> 37:16.920]  It's the totalitarian.
[37:16.920 --> 37:17.920]  It's authoritarian.
[37:17.920 --> 37:18.920]  Why are they doing this?
[37:18.920 --> 37:20.400]  They're supposed to be liberal.
[37:20.400 --> 37:21.880]  They're not liberals.
[37:21.880 --> 37:25.160]  They're power grabbing.
[37:25.160 --> 37:31.840]  They're taking us a trillion miles, hoping we only battle back 500 billion.
[37:31.840 --> 37:42.040]  They'll still have us 500 billion miles down a black hole.
[37:42.040 --> 37:44.840]  They know what they're doing.
[37:44.840 --> 37:52.000]  They are a scientific military operation.
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.600]  Putin's come out and said the global warming system is a global military operation to destroy
[37:56.600 --> 38:01.400]  nation-states and bankrupt the individual for social engineering, which is exactly what
[38:01.400 --> 38:04.080]  it is.
[38:04.080 --> 38:08.320]  You are facing a scientific military operation.
[38:08.320 --> 38:13.440]  If you're unconscious of it, you will be destroyed and enslaved, dumbed down.
[38:13.440 --> 38:17.640]  But if you are aware of it and will research it, it's fantastical.
[38:17.640 --> 38:18.640]  It's incredible.
[38:18.640 --> 38:19.960]  You'll be able to defend yourself.
[38:19.960 --> 38:21.000]  You'll be informed.
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.880]  You will accelerate in life, in business, in culture.
[38:24.880 --> 38:27.320]  The coolest thing to be is awake.
[38:27.320 --> 38:31.240]  The most powerful thing to be is awake and strong and focused.
[38:31.240 --> 38:37.920]  And not a chump, not a schmuck, not an idiot, not a sucker, not a dumbo, not a dodo bird,
[38:37.920 --> 38:41.400]  not a mark.
[38:41.400 --> 38:48.040]  You see, they engineer people to think it's cool to be chumps, well, not me.
[38:48.040 --> 38:53.120]  And they can sit back on the young Turks and every other White House-connected whorehouse
[38:53.120 --> 38:58.920]  and they can sit around with all their little fancy pants, media matters and MSNBC and go
[38:58.920 --> 39:01.040]  ha, ha, ha, ha.
[39:01.040 --> 39:04.200]  That kook says the government funds ISIS, ha, ha, ha.
[39:04.200 --> 39:07.160]  That kook says fluoride's bad for you, ha, ha, ha.
[39:07.160 --> 39:10.040]  That guy says breastfeeding's good for babies, ha, ha, ha.
[39:10.040 --> 39:15.720]  That guy says plastic additives are destroying our sexuality and giving us cancer, ha, ha,
[39:15.720 --> 39:17.160]  ha.
[39:17.160 --> 39:21.040]  When the informed people out there know all I'm stating is admitted fact.
[39:21.040 --> 39:27.600]  One of the big hip-hop websites posted a video where I ran it for just a few minutes about
[39:27.600 --> 39:33.800]  the fake Rick Ross, the fat jail guard that was expert in imprisoning Black people who
[39:33.800 --> 39:38.360]  then goes around acting like a Mac Daddy up there in original gangster, which he's not
[39:38.360 --> 39:40.080]  to make gangster culture look cool.
[39:40.080 --> 39:47.160]  He's talking about killing Donald Trump and they wrote this article and folks started
[39:47.160 --> 39:50.880]  attacking me and then the majority of people came in and said, no, but Alex Jones is saying
[39:50.880 --> 39:52.360]  is absolutely true.
[39:52.360 --> 39:58.360]  And then the response on the big hip-hop site was by some people was, oh, he's a racist.
[39:58.360 --> 40:01.440]  Oh, yeah, I'm a real racist.
[40:01.440 --> 40:05.040]  That's why I sit here and talk straight to you and say, you're filled with racism, you're
[40:05.040 --> 40:09.480]  filled with tribal programming from the media, so you're distracted on the enemies that
[40:09.480 --> 40:14.680]  aren't enemies while the globalist murder you with fluoride, vaccines and abortion,
[40:14.680 --> 40:17.280]  51% of Black people.
[40:17.280 --> 40:21.180]  A racist will sit here and teach you to be racially obsessed, teach you to have a chip
[40:21.180 --> 40:25.440]  on your shoulder, teach you to want handouts, teach you how to be a gangster so you can
[40:25.440 --> 40:29.760]  be put in prison, not tell you you're being scientifically murdered.
[40:29.760 --> 40:37.760]  How pathetic and weak and stupid to sit there at someone literally trying to haul you out
[40:37.760 --> 40:43.040]  of a boiling cauldron and trying to haul everyone else out because there's a little secret.
[40:43.040 --> 40:44.320]  We're all in this together.
[40:44.320 --> 40:48.600]  We either haul each other out or we all lose everything.
[40:48.600 --> 40:52.880]  We're all basically paddling for sure, a hurricane's coming in, we're in a rowboat
[40:52.880 --> 40:57.600]  and you're bitching about me being a racist when waves are starting to lap into it and
[40:57.600 --> 41:03.400]  we don't get to shore, that hurricane's gonna kill us, you idiots.
[41:03.400 --> 41:07.160]  You like being murdered in your house slow, you like being killed, you like the state
[41:07.160 --> 41:11.760]  taking your kids over and brainwashing them, then keep watching Melissa Harris Perry who
[41:11.760 --> 41:19.720]  hates your stinking guts and she hates my stinking guts as well because that's what
[41:19.720 --> 41:21.000]  all makes us the same.
[41:21.000 --> 41:28.240]  We got red blood stinking guts and where's your heart, see that big fat parasite Rick
[41:28.240 --> 41:33.800]  Ross drinking your blood, sucking you, sucking you and your family dry and you can't even
[41:33.800 --> 41:37.600]  see it, makes you want to throw up.
[41:37.600 --> 41:50.680]  Now, continuing, briefly.

[44:08.640 --> 44:13.800]  products from some big globalist corporation that then gives the money to anti-gun groups
[44:13.800 --> 44:17.000]  or open border groups or the rest of it.
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.760]  You are voting with your dollars, voting with your currency to support an organization that's
[44:21.760 --> 44:29.520]  dedicated to viciously expose the new world order, to raise the alarm, to blow the big
[44:29.520 --> 44:38.200]  trumpet on the castle wall, to light the sentinel fires, to raise the people, the modern Paul
[44:38.200 --> 44:45.720]  Revere operation, we are the foremost horsemen in the night riding, warning the people, letting
[44:45.720 --> 44:50.080]  them know what's happening and trying to get other people to ride with us, to continue
[44:50.080 --> 44:56.680]  to ride into the land and across the world, warning people, it's equivalent of Paul Revere
[44:56.680 --> 45:03.040]  riding five, six hours of the night, his horse is exhausted, sweating all over and riding
[45:03.040 --> 45:07.840]  into a barn with waiting patriots who take that horse, put a blanket over it, give it
[45:07.840 --> 45:12.800]  water, give it grain and put Paul Revere on another big horse so he can ride right back
[45:12.800 --> 45:20.120]  into the night and continue on a mission committed.
[45:20.120 --> 45:28.160]  You are those Paul Revere's of erase, color and creed and it's time for you to take action.

[46:14.640 --> 46:22.400]  We've already mentioned that all of the LA United School District, arguably the biggest
[46:22.400 --> 46:27.560]  in the country, has been shut down today, no school, not for ice, not for floods, not
[46:27.560 --> 46:35.800]  for wildfires, but for the terrorism that is not terrorism, it's an unspecified threat
[46:35.800 --> 46:44.240]  was received, they're now saying via email mentioning the show Homeland and so whether
[46:44.240 --> 46:48.200]  this is real or not, I mean they have police all over the place, you just have the police
[46:48.200 --> 46:55.480]  on call to go in the school, you just station a cruiser, outside every school one cop's
[46:55.480 --> 46:59.600]  good enough for a couple of jihadis, I mean I'm not sitting there saying I'm the toughest
[46:59.600 --> 47:02.600]  guy around but I've had folks pull guns on me growing up Dallas, I took them away from
[47:02.600 --> 47:09.360]  them and pistol wept them twice, I'm not even going to tell one of the stories, I haven't
[47:09.360 --> 47:16.640]  told some of the stuff, it's just over the top, but I had a buddy that, I'm not going
[47:16.640 --> 47:22.200]  to get into it, the point is, believe me, I don't know where America is, that they sit
[47:22.200 --> 47:26.280]  around for 30 minutes an hour, 2 hours before they go into these schools and take action
[47:26.280 --> 47:31.200]  and they've gotten quicker about it, but I mean in the old days the UT shooter was up
[47:31.200 --> 47:35.960]  there shooting for 30 minutes or so, folks went up the tower, a citizen, an Austin cop
[47:35.960 --> 47:40.520]  and killed the guy and nowadays who knows how long somebody will be up in the tower
[47:40.520 --> 47:47.680]  like that, a crazy Marine with a giant brain tumor and so you shouldn't cancel school,
[47:47.680 --> 47:53.760]  you shouldn't live in panicked fear, that's exactly what the jihadis want.
[47:53.760 --> 48:00.120]  But look at this, hackers trace ISIS Twitter accounts back to the UK government, US visas
[48:00.120 --> 48:07.160]  continue to be handled by foreign contractors, Wayne Madsen has a story on infowars.com,
[48:07.160 --> 48:12.080]  NATO nations training recruiting jihadists, Albania and Turkey are supplying fresh troops
[48:12.080 --> 48:17.400]  for Islamic State, that's another exclusive to infowars.com but it links through to all
[48:17.400 --> 48:23.520]  the mainstream media, I mean it's admitted, Turkish Emon in the USA got $500 million in
[48:23.520 --> 48:34.400]  Texas last year alone of taxpayer money to set up radical training schools, he's got
[48:34.400 --> 48:41.600]  billions of dollars worldwide, it's just $20 billion and just in Texas he gets $500
[48:41.600 --> 48:48.880]  million a year, he has $25 billion in assets, that's a David Knight report on infowars.com
[48:48.880 --> 48:53.280]  and David Knight and others came to me about two weeks ago and said hey we want to go cover
[48:53.280 --> 48:59.600]  this, by all means, Joe Biggs, David Knight, you know, let's do it, the media won't cover
[48:59.600 --> 49:05.200]  it, let's cover it, there's finally lawsuits going on about it so maybe this will get some
[49:05.200 --> 49:10.360]  media attention to it but this is big and we started on the east coast at the different
[49:10.360 --> 49:17.400]  radical training centers but now Texas is obviously in the news with $500 million a year
[49:17.400 --> 49:25.800]  in taxpayer money, you know how much taxpayer money infowars gets, zero, zero, zero, zero,
[49:25.800 --> 49:32.040]  zero, zero, zero and you know how much the jihadis get, billions and billions and billions
[49:32.040 --> 49:39.120]  and billions, you know how many mosques Saudi Arabia opens a year in Europe, over 100 and
[49:39.120 --> 49:45.840]  now they've announced an acceleration to 200 mosques a year exporting their poorest and
[49:45.840 --> 49:54.280]  most radical to Europe with a deal with Merkel and the rest of these people and now they're
[49:54.280 --> 49:58.760]  building mosques here and again they're not exporting nice friendly Muslims that I've
[49:58.760 --> 50:05.400]  known that are moderates that their daughters have freedom, they're exporting basically
[50:05.400 --> 50:12.080]  the equivalent of, I don't want to be mean to rednecks but these are like hillbilly radical
[50:12.080 --> 50:17.160]  Muslims that are the worst, the worst.
[50:17.160 --> 50:20.520]  I mean I love how the liberals shoot their mouth all day about country people being racist
[50:20.520 --> 50:23.920]  or bad or backwards when there's some of the most hard working smart people out there,
[50:23.920 --> 50:27.680]  meanwhile you talk about backward, don't let their women come out of the house basically
[50:27.680 --> 50:37.000]  chain them up and feminists just think it is the sexiest thing since armpit hair, braiding
[50:37.000 --> 50:44.280]  their beautiful armpit hair, they just can't wait to have a, Merkel put on their head and
[50:44.280 --> 50:48.800]  I guess be back slapped have their teeth knocked out a little bit, black eye, they're like
[50:48.800 --> 50:54.680]  oh it's so liberal, oh but you see that other guy, he was wearing pants, yeah, yeah man,
[50:54.680 --> 51:00.680]  western men, I deserve everything for free, I like the radicals though.
[51:00.680 --> 51:28.680]  That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking
[51:28.680 --> 51:29.680]  about.
[51:29.680 --> 51:58.680]  That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about.
[51:58.680 --> 52:28.280]  That's what I'm talking about.
[52:29.280 --> 52:33.600]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year, just this past August
[52:33.600 --> 52:38.040]  was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River, I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn,
[52:38.040 --> 52:43.200]  he hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years, his excuse, he simply couldn't afford it,
[52:43.200 --> 52:48.200]  he wasn't a rich man by any means, at less than $107 per month, libertyoncall.org would
[52:48.200 --> 52:53.560]  have been the perfect alternative for my father, don't wait, go to libertyoncall.org right

[53:52.200 --> 54:21.200]  I start ranting, it's because I can't believe that our government has been hijacked by
[54:21.200 --> 54:28.240]  criminals, the U.K. government, the EU governments, NATO, our own top generals, like four of them
[54:28.240 --> 54:33.480]  now have come out and said we run al-Qaeda, we were ordered to run al-Qaeda, ISIS is al-Qaeda,
[54:33.480 --> 54:38.320]  95% of the rebels are al-Qaeda, they're basically all bad, this is evil, we don't want to be
[54:38.320 --> 54:42.360]  part of it, and then nothing happens.
[54:42.360 --> 54:47.880]  There is an inspector general of the Pentagon investigation now, so I guess something is
[54:47.880 --> 54:55.800]  happening, but it's cut and dry, Congress should be impeaching Hillary and Obama right
[54:55.800 --> 55:06.680]  now, here's the problem, Lindsey Graham and people like John McCain are both involved
[55:06.680 --> 55:12.640]  heavily with other Republicans in cheerleading just as bad as Obama and Hillary for arming
[55:12.640 --> 55:16.360]  and controlling ISIS, the difference is they didn't actually direct it, they're still
[55:16.360 --> 55:22.160]  guilty though, Ted Cruz two years ago said we shouldn't be al-Qaeda's air force in Syria,
[55:22.160 --> 55:27.440]  but he's still back toppling Assad, he's hedging his bet, and that's the one big problem I
[55:27.440 --> 55:32.440]  have with him because he's really smart, smarter than I am probably, probably one of the smartest
[55:32.440 --> 55:38.720]  guys when it comes to politics, one of the most informed and he knows well what he's
[55:38.720 --> 55:45.800]  doing, big strike against Ted Cruz, and I admire Ted Cruz, big strike against Donald
[55:45.800 --> 55:49.280]  Trump that he says I'll shut down parts of the internet, that's dangerous talk Donald,
[55:49.280 --> 55:59.120]  I still like him, but as much as I have problems with those two guys or Rand Paul acting all
[55:59.120 --> 56:05.720]  you know limp rested basically, I say that try to get him going, tough love, they're
[56:05.720 --> 56:12.040]  like years better than Bernie, Hillary, Jeb, I mean give me a break, the debates tonight,
[56:12.040 --> 56:20.240]  7 o'clock, live coverage, infowars.com, infowars.com forward slash show, have the live feed, infowars.com
[56:20.240 --> 56:25.560]  forward slash 2016, let's make that a link, infowars.com forward slash 2016, that isn't
[56:25.560 --> 56:31.120]  a URL yet, it will be in five minutes, that's the link to share, we'll tweet that out, and
[56:31.120 --> 56:35.960]  please help us retweet it, and I'm gonna do a bunch of Facebook mentions tonight, galvanizing
[56:35.960 --> 56:42.080]  folks to come in and watch our live coverage. Now, none of that time to get to these during
[56:42.080 --> 56:47.440]  this break, but I have Trey Gowdy, Grills DHS official on due process, Obama's undersecretary
[56:47.440 --> 56:53.360]  of the Army nominee says ISIS not contained, Obama says it is, North Carolina Governor,
[56:53.360 --> 56:58.440]  the feds don't tell us where, when, or who, we're bringing in the refugees, let's play
[56:58.440 --> 57:04.840]  that one first, this is North Carolina Governor, Pat McCrory appearing on Fox News to discuss
[57:04.840 --> 57:08.840]  some other topics, sanctuary cities, and Syrian refugees, now remember, they're gonna track
[57:08.840 --> 57:13.520]  everything you do, spy on you, put you on no fly list as a citizen with no evidence,
[57:13.520 --> 57:19.320]  no proof, just to jack with you and set the precedent for extra judicial control, the
[57:19.320 --> 57:24.360]  IRS now has gotten the law passed, where they're gonna not let you fly if you haven't
[57:24.360 --> 57:29.560]  paid your income taxes, but no judge, no jury, they just claim there's a problem, this is
[57:29.560 --> 57:36.480]  internal checkpoints, the essence of a tyranny, I mean, that is the most signified, bona fide
[57:36.480 --> 57:41.760]  one symbol, you gotta say one thing, not being able to travel, when you haven't been indicted
[57:41.760 --> 57:49.320]  or on parole, I mean, baby, that's the big daddy, that's the Godzilla of Japanese monsters,
[57:49.320 --> 57:55.600]  I mean, it's the big kahuna, it's the big red flag, it's the, it's bad, papers and an
[57:55.600 --> 58:02.840]  internal passport, yeah, and restrictions, you want it, you got it, any form of slavery
[58:02.840 --> 58:07.120]  you want, it all starts there, and here they are saying they won't tell us who these people
[58:07.120 --> 58:12.600]  are and they just disappear, because securities, all the fraud, our government is run by the
[58:12.600 --> 58:15.880]  terrorists, let's play the clip.
[58:15.880 --> 58:21.920]  You have Syrian refugees headed to North Carolina, you oppose that, but you can't stop it, correct?
[58:21.920 --> 58:25.520]  That's correct, we're not even told by the president, I think the most misinformation
[58:25.520 --> 58:30.680]  is that the federal government and Homeland Security and the president tell each governor
[58:30.680 --> 58:35.760]  when these Syrian refugees come to our state, we have no communication whatsoever, when
[58:35.760 --> 58:40.600]  they come, where they go, who they are, they'll be back, it's all fraud, it's all a scam,
[58:40.600 --> 58:44.600]  you are listening to GCN, the terrorists are getting ready to hitch, and they're going
[58:44.600 --> 58:51.200]  to take all our rights, the terrorists run the White House, when cells become toxic,
[58:51.200 --> 58:56.400]  they die early and aging sets in, no one has put together a formula that focuses directly
[58:56.400 --> 59:01.040]  on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same
[59:01.040 --> 59:07.160]  time, just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ is backed by major clinical studies, you

[59:23.200 --> 59:27.200]  probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because
[59:27.200 --> 59:28.200]  of brain force.
[59:28.200 --> 59:31.600]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives, staring

[59:42.520 --> 59:52.640]  other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[59:52.640 --> 01:00:20.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:38.240]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future, not a future
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:44.760]  that will be but one that might be, this is not a new world, it is simply an extension
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:50.960]  of what began in the old one, it has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:56.360]  the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time, it
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:02.300]  has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:08.200]  of human freedom, but like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:17.760]  iron rule, logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:23.920]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth, in his last 48 hours on earth, he's a citizen of the
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:29.840]  state but will soon have to be eliminated, because he is built out of flesh and because
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:46.160]  he has a mind, Mr. Romney Wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the twilight
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:02:03.200]  show.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.900]  giving better. Cause I just like family. I like Christmas food.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:10.760]  I like holiday food. I like pumpkin pie and cherry pie and hungry and,
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.600]  and ham and turkey and, you know, grandma and the rest of it,
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.080]  but piles of toys and everything. Even when I was a kid, it was kind of like,
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.520]  this is kind of obscene. Um,
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.740]  I'd rather, you know, go hiking or something when I was a kid.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:28.640]  But as, as I get older, I like it more and more because at least it's,
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.900]  it's family, at least it's wholesome compared to this new culture.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:36.840]  And I just get more nostalgic by the day now,
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.480]  and it brings me back to being a kid and I just love Christmas.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.440]  And the filthy scum that have taken this country over in Europe,
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.080]  over are banning Christmas carols in Italy. They're banning it in Germany.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.880]  They're telling women how to dress.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.600]  They're telling people you can't have October Fest outside. Cause you know,
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:57.200]  there's 10,000 migrants in the town of 5,000 now and they come up and say,
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.640]  you're not going to drink that beer. I mean,
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:03.800]  it's crazy to have these arrogant, stuck up, crazy people who come from these
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.960]  henpecked countries where they just suppress each other all day and make
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.040]  each other conform.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:13.120]  Then they come to our truly liberal cultures and a bunch of fake liberals
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.680]  came up with them to tell us what you words to use and how to talk and how to
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.680]  behave. I'm sick of it. I'm tired of it. I'm getting angry.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.320]  Let some jackass tell me to not have a Christmas tree in my yard or whatever.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.520]  I'm going to break your fricking nose. I'm tired of getting pushed around and I've
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:32.320]  had enough. I'm not trying to act tough.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.320]  I just have to vent sometimes because I sit here and I'll look at all this and
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.880]  our government funding and Al-Qaeda and murdering everybody.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:43.240]  And I mean, just think of the trash that we have running our country that they
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.480]  would go into stable countries and put crazies into murder all the Christians,
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.040]  much less Muslims who I care about as well. But see,
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.800]  they're targeting countries that have got Christians and that are somewhat
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.160]  secular and stable. And they are murdering everyone.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:02.280]  They get their filthy hands on with our sickening evil Hillary Clinton and
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:06.720]  Barack Obama and Holland and Merkel and Cameron.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:12.800]  Hanchoing the whole stinking mess from London funding and running.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.640]  It came out that ISIS is in fact, it isn't enough to show one article.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.280]  It's not to show a whole spectrum.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:23.760]  Do you remember a month ago, it came out that all the major ISIS video and
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:29.760]  website accounts are run by government connected secretive telecoms in Silicon
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.760]  Valley? Oh, and now it's in mainstream news that the hackers have traced ISIS
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.680]  Twitter accounts to the British government. Oh, you know, they let them fly
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.480]  wherever they want. You know, they bring them in, you know, they protect them,
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.680]  you know, they run them.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:50.480]  And then if you dare protest them in England, they arrest you and throw you
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.880]  in a pen with them to be beaten or murdered. They even let in England.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.760]  They let them get away with pouring acid on women's faces and raping children.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:05.040]  The LAPD and private security are targeting random people with stop and frisk
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:09.000]  searches on public sidewalks before the premiere of Star Wars, the force
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.200]  awakens. Police have also installed metal detectors on the sidewalks near the
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:17.800]  famous TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood, California. Someone took to
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:21.640]  Twitter to post a picture of a wookie having his bag searched. The caption
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.360]  reads, security will be tight for the latest hashtag Star Wars premiere
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:31.120]  tonight. Metal detectors have been set up. TMZ reported LAPD and private
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:35.240]  security officers are already blanketing several square blocks around the
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.480]  fame Chinese theater where the force awakens event is going down. We've
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:43.560]  learned anyone strolling through the area could be searched, frisked and even
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:48.040]  wanted with metal detectors. In other words, even people not associated with
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.880]  the event who are simply passing through a public area are subject to a
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:57.080]  warrantless search. You can find more reports on info wars dot com.

[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:22.000]  the last 2015 Republican debate here at infowars.com tonight at 7. InfoWars
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.840]  exclusive coverage of the GOP debate and in some people send us emails it's very
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:30.320]  popular hundreds and hundreds of thousands just on the streams watch. One
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:35.360]  time we had like 500,000 watch one average about 300,000 watch it live and
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:39.640]  then the refeed of it. We actually get a lot of emails though saying hey stop
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:46.480]  talking over the debate. You tune in to CNN to see the debate and to see their
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.240]  commercials and to see them cutting in. This is a presidential supposed
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:55.000]  commission. It's only being hosted by them. We are covering the debate and the
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.960]  whore media. We are covering the media event. That's how we take the feed and
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:04.960]  cover it. We could not just take their feed and have that there. We are adding
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.880]  our commentary, adding our own news pieces. We are analyzing it just like I
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:14.880]  can show presidential commercials or I can analyze clips of films. Under
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.200]  classical fair use has been checked out by the lawyers. It's very defensible.
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:21.640]  That's what we're doing. I just keep explaining it and people don't get it. So
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:25.360]  I don't want our crew to even explain that anymore tonight when people send
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.560]  tweets or emails because I think it's kind of a joke when they ask it. I think
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:33.160]  people say it maybe once at the start and maybe at the ending that we are here
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:38.760]  live analysis of the propaganda and of the candidates and of the controlled
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.480]  media because they cannot be trusted. We are going to be there adding live
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.480]  analysis and coverage kind of like Archie Bunker does at his house you know
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:52.480]  yelling at the television. That's what we're doing. We are here to expose things
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.720]  in live time in an irreverent way and that's what we do. Now I want to take
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.440]  phone calls ahead of the former head of the visa department in Saudi Arabia
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.640]  Michael Springman worked for the State Department. It came out that the CIA was
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:11.040]  handling the hijackers 15 of the 19. They were ordered to let them back in. That
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.360]  ties into all the things happening with the visas today and how they're letting
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.280]  these jihadists into the country. I'd love to hear of people from customs or
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.520]  retired customs or Border Patrol could get in to talk about this because I know
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.200]  they're good people on average some of the best but they are ordered to
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:31.760]  harass citizens but you see it all the time where a bus load or a train load of
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:35.120]  illegals comes in from all over the world. Their orders not even look at their
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:39.800]  IDs or asked for them and they let them in. A good example of what came out in
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:44.520]  the news two weeks ago. 140 plus people from Mexico and other countries out of
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:50.160]  Mexico landing at JFK and they were told don't even look at their passports or
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.920]  IDs just let them in and let them out and I played a governor earlier let's
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:59.960]  play that clip again of North Carolina on O'Reilly Factor. The feds don't tell
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.600]  us where, when or who they're bringing refugees in. Well the governor of Texas
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:09.160]  asked and was told we're not gonna tell you. Well we know there's 300 at one
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:13.520]  high school alone in Austin. Jakari Jackson went out and covered that at my
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:17.560]  alma mater Anderson High so here's that clip. But first the toll-free number to
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:24.800]  join us. First-time callers again 800-259-9231 or if you haven't called in a
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.440]  year. First time we're hadn't called in a year. I think that's a nice in-between
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:36.880]  level. 800-259-9231. 800-259-9231. Now let's go ahead and go to the North
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:42.160]  Carolina governor talking about the situation. You have Syrian refugees
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:46.600]  headed to North Carolina. You oppose that but you can't stop it correct? That's
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.840]  correct. We're not even told by the president. I think the most misinformation
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.240]  is that the federal government and Homeland Security, the president, tell
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.360]  each governor when the Syrian refugees come to our state. We have no
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:02.400]  communication whatsoever when they come, where they go, who they are.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:07.440]  And that's what our major objection is. Our local Homeland Security people
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:11.480]  who are the ones that have to respond to any emergency are not in the
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:18.040]  communication loop with the president. And now we have California
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:24.080]  schools in LA, the biggest school district in the country, shut down for an
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.840]  unspecified threat and New York's looking at shutting down. Instead of snow days, we
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:33.800]  have terror days where we learn to you know get in a fetal position. Pretty
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:42.160]  disgusting. Nathaniel in Alaska, you're on the air. Welcome. Nathaniel from Alaska, I have a
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:45.160]  few things to talk about today. Yes sir, we're not screening your call. You're live
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:51.480]  on air. Okay, fantastic. So the first thing I have to say is about the coming
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:55.640]  geopolitical alignment that I perceive coming. You were talking earlier about
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:02.440]  Muthala Ghulain and his net movement a little bit, I believe. Go ahead. Okay, so I
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.400]  have a couple ideas as to what will happen. I perceive that we
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:11.160]  may very well have a Trump presidency. And I'm very happy about that.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:18.120]  But I think it may bring upon certain problems. But like you, I am here to fight
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:23.480]  simply for what is right. And I'd rather go down with the ship if we're fighting
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:28.560]  for what is right. So what I think will happen is we'll have a Trump presidency.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:37.400]  We'll have global backlash from a lot of Islamic entities within, from around, and
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.520]  they'll be looking for a solution. That solution will be a secular Islam. A
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:46.840]  secular Islam will not be found under the current ISIS situation. I think it's a
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:52.760]  huge false flag. I think the whole ISIS thing is meant to bring in this, his
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:58.680]  met philosophy. Because if you look at the philosophy, everything on this
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:04.280]  philosophy essentially points to a solution. I think the solution may bring
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:14.760]  upon possibly some huge implications. I appreciate your call. The reason the West
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:19.080]  is bringing in radical, incompatible jihadis is because they're going to let
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.840]  them carry out terror attacks. They're then going to take all of our basic rights
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.920]  and put troops on the street corner for the gun owners, the veterans, the
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.040]  patriots who they admit it's all for. They will then false flag terror attack
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.560]  and blame it on us and try to come basically arrest the leadership of the
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:39.360]  patriot movement that are the true Americans who just want basic Americana
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.560]  July 4th, free market, private property, the right to keep their arms, the right
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:48.760]  to not be surveilled. We are the enemy. But they have to overthrow logic to get
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.120]  that done. They have to let terrorists get into the country, they have to let them
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:56.200]  attack us and then let the very people that aided them pose as our saviors,
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:02.440]  our owners, our controllers. So we're here to expose that right now and we're in a
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.320]  race against time to wake people up, especially at the state level, so the
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:12.600]  globalists can't carry this out. They're then in phase two, which Europe is
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.960]  already in, putting them under civil emergencies, banning any libertarian or
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:22.320]  conservative movements from even demonstrating or holding office to then
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:28.360]  quote, submit to Islam so that it won't attack us. And then they won't really
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.600]  submit to Islam. Once the country submits, they will then round up the more
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.920]  radical jihadis and actually deport them or imprison them or rehabilitate them
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:41.720]  so there aren't terror attacks. But anytime you then don't submit, they flip
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:46.160]  a switch and then turn the jihadis loose. So the jihadis are like a big pit
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:51.640]  bull that they use to menace the West. And you can see the chain in the hand of
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:55.640]  the globalists right down to the neck, the spike collar. You can see the
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:59.400]  globalists feeding the pit bull, you know, gunpowder, so it's crazed out of
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:03.760]  control. And they think we're so dumb, we don't see this whole situation, even
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:08.000]  though it's in the news today. Eric in West Virginia, you're on the air. Go
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.960]  ahead. Hi Alex, big, long time listener. I met you at a Bilderberg 2012 in
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:20.560]  Chantilly, Virginia about the GOP debate tonight. I was thinking, you know, I
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:25.520]  mean, considering Infowars has such a huge audience, just to show up all these
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:32.240]  other networks and their fake dog and pony show debate, how about Infowars
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:38.200]  host your own debate? Well, here's the deal. We do have 20 million viewers and
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:43.440]  listeners a week. We do have millions and millions of viewers a day. But most of
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.400]  the Republican candidates still go along with the establishment and would not
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.560]  probably come on this show. I could twist Rand Paul's arm, get him on as a
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:54.560]  guest. I could twist Ted Cruz's arm, probably get him on if I wanted to. The
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.520]  Trump people pretty much reached out to us. I wasn't even shooting that high,
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:02.120]  thinking to try to get somebody that big on, because quite frankly, it doesn't
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.080]  really even do that much for the show. I can just analyze what they're doing
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:09.000]  anyways. But it is good that Trump comes on because it shows how big this
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.040]  audience is and that he's a savvy guy and knows what he's doing. But down the
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.840]  road, I mean, I would imagine that we will have some debates of an Infowars
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:23.120]  host. I appreciate your call. Brandon in a female region, he won't say what
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.800]  state he's in. You're on the air. Go ahead, Brandon.
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:31.920]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to start out by saying the good news is, is we're
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:35.960]  winning on many fronts. I'm a college student and the average female I
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:39.920]  talked to are bitterly opposed to abortion, know that global warming, the
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.840]  total fraud, know that the police data, a total hoax. But what I wanted to
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:50.000]  talk to you today about is I was reading this morning that Delta Force
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.440]  carried out a raid against ISIS and I wanted to get your opinion if it's
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:57.560]  just a staged raid, like the Osama bin Laden raid was, or if it was real,
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.440]  it claimed that they killed a high ranking ISIS.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.360]  Sure. Sure. Is that the one a month ago or one of the Delta Force guys got
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:08.160]  killed? No, no, it was posted this morning and it said that they killed
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:13.040]  hire a tier commander in ISIS or something and they killed 12 Gehadi's
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.960]  and. Well, there's so many splinter groups in what ISIS is supposedly
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.240]  they're all obvious, all the same group. And I didn't see that new report.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:23.680]  Maybe they'll bring it into me. But Delta Force goes and kills who they're
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:28.240]  told to kill. And so who knows if who they killed is actually Wahhabi or
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:33.840]  ISIS. Delta Force is also very political and particularly nowadays will
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.240]  engage in any deception the president wants. They work for the president
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:43.080]  directly. So it's not Delta Force. It's Obama Force right now. And so quite
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:46.240]  frankly, I don't trust a word comes out of their mouths. I'm not saying the
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:52.640]  men that are in Delta Force are bad. But it's just it's just over the top
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.080]  political. So I don't believe a word of it. I mean, look, the point is our
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.240]  government created ISIS and is running it.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.600]  Still wondering what to get that special someone that has everything at ID
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.600]  stronghold. We still find that a huge percentage of people do not yet have an
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.280]  RFID blocking wallet or purse to protect them from the new and growing
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:15.360]  threat of electronic pickpocketing. That's right, even though 40% of all
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:19.920]  new chipped payment card shipped in 2014 contained a wireless interface called
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:24.400]  RFID that allows the account information to be skimmed by a thief passing near
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:28.400]  your cards. Most people are still unprotected. The good news is that ID
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:32.160]  stronghold makes luxurious leather wallets and other products that prevent
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.960]  this ID stronghold founded the entire RFID protection industry and has been

[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.960]  body extract talks about the positive effects of heart and body extract.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:26.720]  What happens with the formula heart and body extract is it's giving the body
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:31.680]  the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients so the
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:35.040]  body will heal itself. And yes, the body does have the ability to
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:39.440]  balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:43.200]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic stuff. The
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:47.040]  body is an amazing thing. It simply needs some help so it has the
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.480]  tools to heal itself. Heart and body extract gets results.

[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.600]  vegan diets could be bad for the environment. See, they're not going to let you have anything.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:25.760]  Everything you do is bad. Everything has to be taxed. Everything is evil. The government's
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:35.760]  going to save you. That ties into Star Wars, class wars. Is Mars the escape hash for the 1%?
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:42.640]  The escape hatch for the 1%? Well, the leader acting like the planet isn't going to be here
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:48.000]  soon. Whether that's true or not, it says a lot about what they think about us, doesn't it?
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:52.720]  Right now, though, let's go to Seth in Pennsylvania, James in Canada, and others.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:57.360]  Seth in PA, you're on the air. How you doing, Alex? Good, my friend.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.400]  Thanks for having me. I'm a big fan of the show. I listen and read all the time.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:10.560]  Thank you. I just have two things. The one is a question. I wanted to get your take on.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:19.920]  What are your thoughts on the three senators, Brad, Wenstrup, Ken Calvert, and Mike Pompeo?
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:24.240]  Anything that's going to come out of the investigation of them looking into SENTCOM,
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:31.440]  of Obama Doctrine, the record saying that they were containing ISIS and all that?
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:37.120]  You know, I'm glad you raised that because there was a headline in an article at infowars.com
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:46.640]  yesterday that dealt with the fact that there is a Pentagon Inspector General investigation
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:52.480]  of the fixed intelligence to say that ISIS wasn't a threat. But the media is spinning it
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:57.120]  that the investigation is about that. It's really about the government arming ISIS.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:01.680]  And that's what these generals have come out and talked about. So, yes, we need to really focus
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:09.680]  on this. This is potentially a thousand times worse than Watergate or even Whitewater. You know,
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:17.040]  ripping off some properties. That's nothing compared to turning whole countries over to Al-Qaeda,
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.960]  calling in a new name, having our military aid them, lying to the American people.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:24.960]  And the fact that we've had all these generals go public and analysts go public,
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:30.640]  and now we have senators investigating it, it's just ultra massive. And I need to go around to all
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.880]  my reporters and all my investigative journalists and my anchors and say, listen, you can cover
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:39.120]  whatever you want because you've all got great instincts. I like what you cover. I mean, I'm
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:47.840]  very, very hands off around here. But we need to make this a major, major, major priority because
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:52.960]  I see so many headlines on info wars that get it right. You know, Western governments caught funding
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:58.960]  ISIS. Russia says West running ISIS. Russia says Turkey buying ISIS oil. It's all admitted.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:03.520]  But those headlines aren't even hardcore enough. I see some headlines that we run that are like,
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:09.840]  U.S. underestimated ISIS. That's kind of the spin. They need to underestimate Jack Squat.
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:13.680]  It started coming out that our government was funding it. Our own military said they wouldn't
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:19.440]  be part of it. So everything else has been an obfuscation, a muddying of the water, a smokescreen
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:25.440]  to confuse everyone. Hillary said, oh, Benghazi and ISIS is fog of war. No, it's not. You witch.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.840]  The fog's coming out of your broomstick, lady. You're running the whole stinking thing. We got
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:36.080]  you locked on target. You understand politically. All we got to do is I have you now. And it's
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:42.800]  goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. We have you. The generals are going public. It's so huge. It's so big.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:48.080]  It's so bonkers. And I've been living with this for so long. I don't even cover it properly.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:56.320]  Hey, what is my problem? Telling you, we're going to take this done. These pieces of murdering
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:00.560]  filth think they can just run around and kill everybody in front of us and run Al Qaeda and
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.760]  run terror attacks and let the jihadis in. And we don't do anything. We're going to do something
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:10.560]  about it. We're going to get out of our trance. We're going to get involved. We're going to expose
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:19.280]  it. Appreciate your call. I mean, that's what this comes down to people is we're in a trance
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:25.200]  and we don't care. And so am I. Well, I'm breaking out of the trance. It's sensational that criminals
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:31.280]  have hijacked our government. It is sensational that we're not doing anything about it.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.480]  It's sensational. They're trying to teach five year olds how to be trannies. It's sensational.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.960]  They're trying to forcibly inoculate us. It's sensational. They got the NSA surveilling everything
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:46.880]  we do, but won't tell governors and don't know where the refugees crawling with Al Qaeda and
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:52.800]  ISIS are going. It's sensational. This criminal government, this occupied government, this
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:59.520]  criminal group has hijacked this nation 110%. And my theatrics are theatrics. They're real.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:04.240]  What I'm doing right now getting angry and mad is real. It's me not controlling myself.
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:10.560]  So it's 90% real. As a man, I could control myself and not get angry on air and have a heart attack
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:15.360]  or maybe get mad at somebody in traffic. I don't. I let it out here on air. I leave it here on the
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:21.440]  field. It's just real. It's real. I'm mad, but I'm letting myself do this so that people get what's
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:28.240]  going on. Understand you murdering terrorist guilt that put fluoride in our water, try to bring
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:32.720]  damage our kids and try to teach kids two plus two equals five and the debt limits don't raise
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:37.520]  debt limits. And then we didn't build our businesses, you pieces of murdering filth. We're better than
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:42.080]  you. And we're going to break the conditioning and the sleeping giant is going to take you down,
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:51.920]  globalist. Do you understand the spirit of liberty is rising. We're on the march, the empires on the
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:30:04.320]  run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Another GOP debate is upon us. A time to see how much
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:09.200]  attention will be allotted to establishment candidates who are dragging in the polls. These
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:13.840]  are Republican governors. They don't give any credit to the free market. They don't give any
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:19.520]  credit to the entrepreneur. All is not lost, though. Some are speaking on real issues,
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:25.680]  but if you're not going to respond in a no fly zone strategy, what would yours be? The first thing
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:32.880]  I would do is I wouldn't arm our enemies. I wouldn't arm ISIS. Will controversial statement
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:38.320]  impact some of the candidates? Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:46.160]  of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:54.080]  what the hell is going on. Join Info Wars this Tuesday, December 15th, starting at 7 p.m. Central

[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:40.160]  When the enemy comes, he will never be heard. He'll blow your mind and not say a word.
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:46.160]  That's what the culture, it's what the GMO, it's what the creeping death of the open
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:52.800]  borders and the radical Islamists, oring in is all about. The incremental conquering through
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:58.320]  organized controlled crisis of not just the West, but the entire world.
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:12.720]  But as the sleeping giant awakens, the criminal class that's infested many areas of government
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:21.040]  corporations attempt to expand their control and bully us into submission. Thank you so much

[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:24.880]  that are being spewed down our throats. Now, the whole visa controversy that's been coming out
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:31.120]  the last few weeks after the attacks in San Bernardino that left 14 dead has really been
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:35.760]  coming to a head. And then even more came out today, even though I've been working for about a week
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:42.480]  to get Mr. Springman on the broadcast. MichaelSpringman, MichaelSpringman.com
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:46.640]  served as the United States government as a diplomat with the State Department's foreign
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:50.560]  service while postings in Germany, India and Saudi Arabia and also worked with the U.S.
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:55.280]  Commerce Department. He left federal service and currently practices law in the Washington,
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:04.160]  D.C. area, MichaelSpringman.com. That's two ends. And he came out for 9-11 and talked to his colleagues
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:10.320]  who were openly told, you're going to let, and he's told the story before us on his recapping,
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:13.840]  he's getting a new slip today, these people in that have these terrorist backgrounds and he said,
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:17.280]  well, we're not going to do that. They said, well, they work for the CIA basically, so we've been ordered
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:25.600]  to. And now we see, and of course this was back in 2001, 2002, he exposed all this. Now we see
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:30.800]  everything he talked about confirmed in spades every day. And his book exposes the whole situation,
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:35.280]  we'll tell you about the title of that as well and put that up on screen, Visas for Al Qaeda,
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:44.240]  CIA handouts that rock the world. And that book is available at infowarstore.com and
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.560]  better bookstores and Amazon and the rest of it as well. And sure, you're awake,
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:52.160]  but what about your friends and family? Buy on the book, give it to them, support
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:58.240]  patriots and heroes that tell the truth like Mr. Springman. Now, Dub tell that with the British
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:03.280]  headline today out of the mirror, hackers trace ISIS Twitter accounts back to British government.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:10.480]  What about the Associated Press a couple of months ago? All of ISIS's main internet accounts,
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:17.120]  their servers based at shadowy government connected group in Silicon Valley.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:23.120]  Here's another one, US visas continue to be handed out by foreign contractors,
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:28.880]  infowarstore.com, Wayne Madsen that joins us in the next hour, former of the NSA immigration
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:33.520]  officials prohibited from looking at visa applicants, social media, the hill.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:41.840]  Oh, they know all about us. NATO nations training recruiting jihadist. We have the former head of
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.480]  defense intelligence coming out two months ago and saying they were ordered to fund and create the
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:54.640]  ISIS group consciously Turkish E-moms USA network of schools to be investigated 500 million a year
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:00.960]  in taxpayer money just in Texas alone 1000 schools worldwide. Maryland man accused of
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:07.200]  receiving 9000 from ISIS to carry out attack on American soil, Washington Post. And then this
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:14.240]  story right over here dealing with folks with gas poison gas caught coming into Switzerland.
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:20.880]  All these jihad attacks, what would the less be thinking on a war torn Syria to be bringing in
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:26.800]  almost exclusively Sunnis many of which are fake, not Syrians fake passports upwards of 80% the EU
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:31.280]  admits allowing them in and then not letting governors even know who they are and letting
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:36.320]  them disappear. Is this for plausible deniability when there are terror attacks that will be used
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:41.520]  to take our basic freedoms restrict internet freedom? What is the game plan? We have the
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:46.880]  expert here to give his view on what's happening. I mean, when you talked about what you exposed
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:52.000]  14 years ago, Mr. Springman, it was sensational but documented. I mean, I want to say you are
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  quintupled verified certified confirmed. Now, though, it's so naked. What do you make of this?
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:08.320]  Well, I'm flabbergasted. Every time I look at an article on the visas for these two people out in
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:17.040]  California, I get a different story. They keep saying that, well, it was a K one fiance visa.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:24.960]  And then you read, well, yeah, it's a K one fiance visa, but they've been married in Saudi Arabia.
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:32.000]  And it just doesn't track if you were married in Saudi Arabia or anywhere else, you don't get a
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:39.920]  fiance visa. You get an immediate relative visa and you have to apply for it with a petition for
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:48.800]  the alien relative. It's more paperwork. And even the K one visa requires you to go into great detail
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:55.680]  about your background, both the American citizen and the foreign national. They asked for things
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:02.160]  like, are you a terrorist? Do you plan to come to America and engage in terrorism? Have you
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:07.920]  contributed to terrorist organizations? And what were your parents' names and where did they live
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:13.200]  and what were their addresses and phone numbers and what is your identity card number and so forth?
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:18.400]  So there's plenty of information available for the Central Intelligence Agency,
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:23.360]  which does these background checks abroad. And for the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:30.640]  which does them in the United States and could well do it abroad, since they have a FBI special
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:37.280]  agent, a legal attaché at nearly every embassy in the world. So I am just thrown by all of this.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:43.360]  It looks like somebody gave a wink and a nod to pass this woman into the United States.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:51.200]  And I don't know how they did it. If you get married abroad, even in a Muslim contract marriage,
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:42:00.320]  where you're not really married until you have the actual wedding ceremony, that's registered,
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:07.040]  at least in Saudi Arabia it is, and any cursory check of their background would turn this up.
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:12.080]  So they'd say, no, you're eligible for a K one. Mr. Sprayman, let me expand on that while we
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:15.760]  fix your camera briefly. Just tilt it down a little bit if you can, sir. Thank you for joining us
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:22.320]  via video Skype or not just radio folks, but also simulcasttelevisioninfowars.com forward slash show.
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:28.880]  While we have him do that, I want to bring up New York Daily News, CBS News, two weeks ago,
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:35.520]  a plain load of 150, but I see these stories every few weeks, comes in out of Mexico, lands,
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.400]  no one's checked at customs, no IDs are checked, they're just allowed to come right out on the
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:46.560]  street. Now, this is now being done, quote, where Mexico with the Border Patrol, quote, completes
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:51.680]  the smuggling process. That's a quote from senior Border Patrol agents. We broke that news a year
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:56.960]  ago, where we were told by Border Patrol to go to a spot in Texas, and they were loading them
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:01.040]  on the buses with no ID, giving them vouchers to go wherever they wanted,
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:07.280]  to Democrat Party operations, basically. And I'm nonpartisan, but that's who was behind this.
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:12.400]  I mean, how do you do that and then have a police state and take all our rights and have
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:19.120]  surveillance, but then actually bring folks in from drug-torn and war-torn and terror-torn areas
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:23.360]  and just march people through, sir? I mean, doesn't this disqualify the entire war on terror?
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:24.720]  It sure does.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:32.480]  So please continue elaborating on that, because it's so brazen. What are they thinking? How dumb
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:39.280]  do they think we are? Oh, let's say they do a great job of getting it through the media. All
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:44.960]  you hear is how wonderful this is, how wonderful these people are for the United States. We can't
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:50.240]  send these people back because they would be sent back to a terrible country, and yet they throw
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:57.120]  all of the regulations and laws out the window to bring in people with really strange backgrounds.
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:03.120]  I talked to a lot of Europeans, a lot of Latin Americans, a lot of Asians, and it seems like the
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:08.640]  more professional, no criminal records have real reasons to be here. They're really married to an
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:14.720]  American. They really have a job. It's so hard when you try to submit and do it right. But if you
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:20.800]  are with some fake ID or don't even have one, I've witnessed people just let through. This is bizarre.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:27.440]  Yeah, I know people who had God's own time with immigration when they had a legal benefit to
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:34.720]  which they were entitled, and immigration lost their papers or delayed the situation, confused
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:42.240]  them with a Tongan from the South Pacific with a different alien number. It's just the people who do
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:48.720]  it the right way and who pay lots of money to immigration and to attorneys to get them to
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:55.280]  the process, they're screaming mad, and it's Arabs to Ukrainians. They cannot understand what the
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:00.720]  American government is doing. In fact, a lot of the folks that have contacted me freaked out over the
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:08.480]  migrant waves are Middle Easterners, are Europeans, are Russians, you name it, but a lot of them are
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:13.360]  Muslims, and they say, no, we totally agree. It's hard for us as citizens to go back and forth. We
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:19.040]  could arrest because we're Muslims, but then we just watch people literally from Saudi Arabia just
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:23.280]  flooding in when most Arab countries don't like Saudi Arabia, because they know that's the country
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:29.200]  that exports jihadis to kill them. I mean, why is our government allied with the bad guys? I mean,
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:34.080]  I'm the one saying that 80, you agree. How does it tie into the 28 pages and what you went through?
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:44.240]  It all hangs together, and the more explanations the government gives, the stranger it gets.
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:50.000]  I had a client one time who had been half her life in the United States. She worked for a high
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.440]  security company, but she was an Arab and a Muslim, and every time she came into the United States
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:02.560]  from a business trip abroad, she was harassed. And when she filed for citizenship, it took
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:08.480]  a trip to federal court to get the government's attention, and even in that case, the judge
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:16.080]  dismissed the matter saying this shouldn't be in court. In fact, I had a client send me a note
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:24.080]  from the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. They produced a study that
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:31.680]  said Muslims need not apply, and for five megabytes, it went on to talk about how there was a
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:38.480]  distinct US government policy to delay or deny benefits for immigration to Arabs and Muslims.
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:42.880]  But they will then bring in people from war-torn zones,
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:47.680]  chopped full of former combatants. What do you think the government's thinking
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:51.280]  when these groups start blowing stuff up and shooting people as they've already begun in
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:56.800]  Europe and here? And then we turn out that the FBI was on Malik and her husband for two years,
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:02.080]  blocked. I mean, it really is bizarre. I mean, my reporters went up to upstate New York to report
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:07.920]  on Islamaberg and some of these reported Jihad training centers, and they literally
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:11.280]  had Homeland Security column tracking them in live time, knew right where they were via their
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:17.440]  cell phones, knew who had gone, even though we had announced it, and told them we're tracking you,
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:23.760]  and you're not here to stir up trouble, are you? So when you're actually going and investigating
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:29.120]  real groups that have been connected to real things, it's a no-go. But then if you are a real
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:33.440]  doctor, say, from Egypt with no criminal record, you're an archeologist, and you try to come over
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:37.680]  here to move here, even visit your family, then you get arrested. I mean, it just makes no sense.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:44.080]  Yeah. Oh, exactly. I mean, I, uh, Michele Trasodowski and his global research site up in Canada
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:49.440]  very kindly put up an article I had written about the Paris attacks. And the thrust of the
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:57.040]  article was that the idea was to move Muslims and Arabs and all sorts of other people out of the
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:03.920]  Middle East and from elsewhere into Europe to create dissension and hostility and to try and
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:09.440]  drag the Europeans into a war in the Middle East. So far, the Germans have been out of it. The
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:15.280]  French were not too deeply into it, and the British weren't. Yet, within a couple of weeks of this
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:20.320]  happening, the Germans send warships to the Mediterranean, the French send an aircraft
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:28.240]  carrier. They start bombing Syria and Iraq. The British go back into bombing, and they're putting
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:34.480]  restrictions on people's civil liberties in France. So it's a way of getting these people
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:41.120]  into fighting the evil Muslims and the evil Arabs without just showing up proof that there are such
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:46.480]  people. And they do it because of social and geopolitical illiteracy. Just like Saudi Arabia
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:51.360]  is involved in attacking us on 9 11. We attack Iraq. They're our enemy that's secular and not
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:55.680]  working with them. Same thing here. The German, everybody's now saying, get rid of Assad. It's
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:01.840]  his fault. There's refugees. When he didn't start the civil war, the, the EU, NATO, the US, Turkey,
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:07.680]  Israel, they're all Saudi Arabia. Number one, all involved. And then they think we're so dumb.
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:12.240]  Now we've got to remove Assad because of the refugee crisis that our own governments caused.
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:18.720]  Exactly. And the, the amazing thing with all of this is that nobody questions it.
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:26.560]  That you've got all of these things happening. They want to bring thousands of refugees to the
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:32.560]  United States. Yet I've had clients who were married to American citizens and who couldn't get into
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:36.560]  the United States, even though they'd work for the American government into Iraq. They had to
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:43.200]  check and check and check their background for years. But if you're just a jihadi, I mean,
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:46.560]  that's why almost all these guys are military aged men. A lot of them have been confirmed to be
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:51.840]  part of the invasion. Yeah. So what do you think the end game is? Take our liberties,
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.880]  like you said, set up a police state out of the crisis and then end up attacking countries that
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:02.400]  are actually fighting the very same jihadis. Exactly. I mean, you had Saudi Arabia, they've
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:10.640]  announced an RIT this morning that these people are putting together a boarding nation alliance
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:15.760]  to fight ISIL. And the countries that the Saudis have rounded up are basically the
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:21.040]  organizations and countries and governments that are supporting ISIL, that are giving me
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:26.720]  the money to them so they can buy weapons to destroy Syria and other countries in the region.
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:35.280]  It's beyond belief. It makes 1984 look like a child's comic book. And it's because of political
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:38.400]  ignorance, folks, that they can get away with this. The problem is there's a large minority
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:43.840]  worldwide that understands the exact divide and conquer strategy and our own military is investigating
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.800]  it. The Pentagon has an investigation going. Generals are going public. The system has a
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:52.880]  big problem. This, I think, is starting to unravel. We're going to ask Michael Springman,
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:58.000]  a big 9-11 whistleblower, if he thinks it is unraveling and what we can do to reverse these war crimes.
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:28.880]  and obvious storage systems of the past. Find out more at cobertcabinets.com. That's cobertcabinets.com.

[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:30.160]  let them know why. It is essential in an info war to fight George Soros and all the globalist money
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:35.760]  with your money, even a little amounts of it. And your word of mouth will change the world.
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:41.680]  We'll change what the neocons and the controlled left and all these groups are up to. The newest
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:47.120]  stories up on infowars.com, British governments now pointing to Saudis as Islamic state posts
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:51.760]  are discovered on government IP addresses. No folks, it's come out. The British government,
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:55.920]  probably more than anybody, when it comes to actual logistics, has always been running the
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:01.360]  Saudi Arabian terror groups. They set them up over 100 years ago with the first king of Saudi
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:08.080]  Arabia. They created Saudi Arabia. Go watch Lawrence of Arabia. They go and take over Syria in that
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:14.640]  movie because it's a true story, but they make them the good guys. Caravan raiders, actual
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:22.240]  hardcore criminals, pirates, thuggies. They're basically thuggies. The House of Saud probably
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:28.000]  isn't even Saudi Arabian. Some evidence shows they're connected to the ancient spice trade
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:33.520]  all the way to India and are actually thuggy. And I'm not joking. Look up what a thuggy is.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:39.120]  They did operate in Saudi Arabia, by the way, all the way through Iran, all the way into India.
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:44.480]  They kill you and bury you and your family after they rob you. Now, let's continue here
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:49.920]  with Mr. Springman. Feds ignored Islamic terror threat before San Bernardino to focus on right-wing
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:55.200]  radicals. Numerous DHS FBI reports downplayed or completely omitted Muslim jihadists.
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:58.880]  Mr. Springman, in this little segment in five minutes of the next hour, I'm going to let you
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:03.200]  go because you're a busy man, constitutional lawyer, michaelspringman.com. What are points you'd
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:07.200]  like to make or areas you'd like to get into? Because I've kind of been covering the waterfront
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:12.080]  here. My only other question is, where do you see this going? Is it unraveling?
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:19.280]  Well, it depends on what you define as unraveling. The American terror program,
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:27.120]  support for fanatics, recruitment of fanatics, arming of fanatics, that unfortunately seems to
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:34.400]  be increasing. And the American people are paying a price, money that goes into this to support this
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:40.480]  forever war, and to support fanatics around the world, prevents Americans from having their
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:46.880]  bridges rebuilt, from having their roads rebuilt, from having their water systems rebuilt,
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:53.040]  and you wind up with water main breaks, pieces of bridges landing on people's windshields,
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:59.680]  and so on. So I don't think it's going to get any better. And I am not really optimistic that
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:06.880]  there will be anybody coming out of the woodwork in America to say enough is enough
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:13.200]  is time to put an end to this. What happens, unfortunately, is you have these special interest
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:19.280]  groups and the big money that are supporting people like Barry Obama and Hillary Clinton and
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:27.120]  others. And it's basically two branches of the same permanent ruling party that may differ on
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:33.600]  my minor details. But certainly, when you're talking about war abroad, support for terrorism,
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:38.960]  allow crazies into the United States, but keep out doctors, lawyers, and so forth,
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:44.480]  who have the legitimate right to come here and who have a legitimate claim to immigration benefits.
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:51.840]  I think it's the sixth system. And nobody wants to reform it. They want to make changes to give
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:58:00.240]  amnesty to who knows what. Where does it go from here? Because it's bipartisan, the West,
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:04.160]  working with these radical jihad groups. And so that's why they keep wanting to cover it up,
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:11.600]  but it's still coming out. I know it's it's astonishing that they've kept the lid on so long.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:18.320]  And, you know, more than 20 years later, I had yet to find out why I was officially fired by
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:23.360]  the State Department. They shut down the first freedom of information act request as a threat
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:29.360]  to national security. And the second one, they simply shut it down saying the State Department
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:35.600]  shreds visa applications every year when, in fact, they don't. Wow. And the cover up now gets bigger
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:39.360]  and bigger and has more holes in it than Swiss cheese. Third hour coming up. One more seven
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:45.360]  with Springman then. We've got one thing only joining us. Wayne Madsen, stay with us. We got
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:57.520]  breaking news. And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:03.280]  a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus. All of our
[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:08.400]  children are hit with modern mind control, television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars,
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:13.680]  you name it. Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily
[01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:18.880]  by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:23.520]  dangerous psychotropic drugs. Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:27.600]  the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take. We worked with the
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:31.840]  leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:37.440]  affordable and powerful calming formula out there. Introducing child ease with herbs and calming
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:42.800]  extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great. Obtain
[01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:49.280]  your child ease today at infowarslife.com. That's child ease exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:54.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:54.400 --> 02:00:19.520]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:29.200]  Amazing steel guitarist. Might be the best. I don't know, Weldon Henson's
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:33.520]  guy plays for some of the biggest bands out there. They say he may be.
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:39.280]  We're going to come back from break. Dr. Kevin West, Virginia, James in Canada,
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:44.080]  who's been holding first Jerry, Michael and others. Mr. Springman is our guest,
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:49.520]  MichaelSpringman.com. And he's one of many people fired who got in trouble or you name it for trying
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:55.440]  to keep radical jihadis in who were connected to Al Qaeda and others. And his book is visas for Al
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:00.080]  Qaeda. And now we learn they were protecting the husband and wife team from San Bernardino.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:04.480]  I mean, what does the government get? Well, they think we're so dumb, they don't get the
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:08.400]  blame for bringing them in. They'll get more armored vehicles, more checkpoints, more drones,
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:16.480]  more of our freedoms. I agree with Springman's analysis. Other points on this, what do you
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:20.720]  think we can do, Mr. Springman, just keep heat on them? Congressional investigations, I have this
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:25.920]  story, sent common investigation war on Syria, not the Islamic State. And you read the story at
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:32.000]  infowars.com, it's got links, even the Daily Beast and the House Armed Services Committee
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:38.240]  admitting, okay, our government ran ISIS, we want to know why. I mean, it's very positive
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:45.840]  that at least this is now being looked at. Well, I think if the way out, if we can get a way out,
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:54.560]  is to get people in Congress who are not afraid to take the point on this and to build a fire
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:59.840]  under the executive branch and the judicial branch saying, enough is enough, we want full
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:05.600]  and complete disclosure. And one very good way they can do it is simply have a parade of congressmen
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:14.560]  go in and look at the concealed and still secret 28 pages in the September 11th report on
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:21.040]  intelligence failures and simply memorize a paragraph or a couple of sentences and get
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:25.600]  on to the floor of the House or the Senate and saying, this is what I saw in that reading room
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:31.600]  and put it out on the air, put it out in print and see what happens from this. Well, we've had a
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:35.920]  few of them on here like Walter Jones and it says Saudi Arabia consciously at the highest levels
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:40.160]  ran the attacks. Our government knew from the beginning stood down on purpose, basically
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:45.360]  complicit, it is bombshell information, it is trees and proven. And people say, oh, it's worse
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:51.040]  than that. We know, but we have them in their own report. I mean, so if that comes out, it all comes
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:56.000]  out. Yeah, and they've got to start doing this. I mean, Dennis can finish you with the question
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.280]  this, but he's been gerrymandered out of Congress by the Democrat branch of the permanent party.
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:09.440]  And the people we've got in the past, for example, we had the church report that really
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:12.960]  went to town on the intelligence services. And we need people like that again.
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:17.600]  Well, this time it's our own intelligence services coming out saying it's all fraud or
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:22.480]  military saying it. It's not usually the military, you know, having to try to stop wars, usually
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:26.480]  they're trying to start it at least in the past. That shows how corrupt our lead are that we
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:29.200]  actually have a lot of generals doing the right thing now, which is unprecedented.
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:34.320]  Yeah, it is. I mean, we need more people like Spedley Butler from the 1930s.
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:39.200]  Well, I mean, the folks right on the show there need to know that all these yes men and women are
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:43.920]  really creating a climate of absolute and complete tyranny. MichaelSpringman.com. Briefly,
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:48.400]  tell folks about the book. I mean, I read the book. It's extremely powerful. You learn a lot.
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:53.120]  Everybody should buy it and donate it after they read it to the library so that more people read it.
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:04:00.640]  Yeah, great. Thank you. The basis of the book is it's 250 pages of my own personal experience
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:06.240]  with the Department of State and with the legal system trying to find out why I have
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:13.840]  been fired, coupled with two years of research on what I call the Arab Afghan Legion, the terrorist
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:19.840]  that the United States recruited for the war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union, who were
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:26.160]  then transformed or rebranded into al-Qaeda. And when that got old, they turned them into
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:33.680]  ISIL. And it's the same crowd of fanatics. I talked to Colonel Anthony Shaffer, U.S. Army, retired.
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:41.200]  He said that, yeah, the same guys that are in Iraq now fighting are the same people we recruited
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:46.880]  for Afghanistan. Former Senator Mike Gravel from Alaska. You've got a lot of amazing people who
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:50.880]  are out of time. Michael Springman, have a great holiday and Christmas coming up. MichaelSpringman.com,
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:57.920]  the book, Vicious for Al-Qaeda, available at infowarstore.com. Get it today. We'll be back.
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:27.360]  the news site. No angels. We can't even have a star because it can represent a religious system
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:32.480]  like the Star of David. The report states that about 95 percent of the students at
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:39.280]  Brooklyn's PS 169 are either Hispanic or Asian. And the assistant principal announced last month
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:44.640]  that the school is changing its holiday traditions to be sensitive to the diversity of our families.
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:50.560]  Not all children celebrate the same holidays, he added. And the pledge of allegiance was also
[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:56.720]  ditched when the principal took office. You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:26.160]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:30.960]  can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs. Working with my

[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:06.880]  on our side day in and day out exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:12.720]  globalist and we're starting to see big effects. And the word is getting out. The globalist want
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:18.240]  to make us dependent and as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach. Ammunition
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:24.000]  food and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the info war and our enemies
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:30.160]  admit they're losing the info war. We are in an information war and we are losing that war. With
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:35.760]  this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalist
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:42.000]  or government. We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old fashioned way with pure free market

[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:12.880]  Yeah, we live in on the
[02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:31.360]  I know we have loaded phone lines. The toll for a number to join us is 800 259 92 31.
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:35.680]  We're going to go to Kevin, James and a few have been holding the longest and we're getting Wayne
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:40.400]  Madsen investigative journals on the line. We'll be with us in about five minutes to break down
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:47.680]  major breaking news on campaign 2016 that he's been ferreting into also the open funding
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:55.360]  of radical g hon groups. He has written about that for info wars.com and a lot more and we've
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:00.560]  really reached that damn breaking moment when you've got the former head of sent com and other
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:09.360]  generals and inspector general investigations in the Pentagon, not about fixed intelligence.
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:14.000]  That's what the media spinning. It's about the fact that our government is backing al-Qaeda,
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:20.320]  al-Nusra, ISIS, same group, same organization, same culture. It's kind of like we have the army,
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:26.480]  navy, marines and air force. Well, they have al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, ISIS, is it's all the same
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:33.440]  black flags, same Saudi Arabian garbage, same crazed radical Sunni trash that kills other Sunni
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:39.920]  Shiites, Alawites, Christians. I mean, it is the expansionist fascist version of Islam.
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:46.080]  Hands down, no debate. So why does our elite think they can use them to come in and take over?
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:51.520]  Let them come in and attack us here and then take our freedoms. So Wayne Madsen is going to get
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:55.840]  into all of that and other breaking news that he's been investigating. He does also report
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:01.120]  for info wars.com and two of his reports are on the site today. But let's go to
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:05.360]  Kevin in West Virginia, then James in Canada. Kevin in West Virginia, thanks for holding her on the
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:11.680]  year. Hey, Alex, how are you doing? Good, my friend. Go ahead. Um, this is my thoughts.
[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:21.680]  Mr. Obama, step down, step down, quit being a criminal and face the American public and take
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:28.720]  it like a man. Well, if Obama falls and all the criminals around him fall, including all the
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:34.160]  neocon Republicans that have been working with him as well. But we have reached that point where
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:39.440]  how far can they go to come into 30 States and say, we're going to bring in radical, dangerous
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:44.560]  refugees, many of them foreign fighters. We're not going to even let them have IDs or passports and
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:49.520]  they can just disappear. And we won't tell state homeland security or local police or state police
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:55.040]  where they are. But oh, we're following everything you do as citizens and watching you. I mean,
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:11:02.160]  this is really showing America that the police state is for us, uh, not for actual threats
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:08.160]  that are outside the country. It does show the war on terror is a complete fraud. New headline
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:13.520]  info wars.com feds ignore Islamic terror threat before San Bernardino to focus on right wing
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:19.920]  radicals had the just department group tried to prosecute investigate the FBI agents and others
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:25.840]  that were investigating the husband and wife team. So pretty amazing. What else do you have to say,
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:35.440]  Kevin? Um, I agree with you 100%. I just feel that Obama needs to step down as law as well
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:41.040]  as the right, the leaders of the right on the right of the Republicans. You're criminal. We have
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:48.240]  you in our sights. We've got you. I agree. Every group that means Lindsey Graham. That means people
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:54.240]  like John McCain. Uh, that means, uh, people like, uh, Jeb Bush that's been supporting it, but not
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:59.440]  actually in government. Uh, and others need to be investigated. And we've got Hillary quarterbacking
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:03.760]  it at the state department. Obama heavily involved. There is a larger master strategy
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:09.200]  and it hinges on us being completely mindless, completely ignorant, geopolitically, culturally,
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:14.800]  and not knowing it just like 9 11. The Saudis are involved. Our government covers up. We blame
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:20.400]  Iraq. They're arch enemy. Now we blame Syria for the refugees that are attack cost. I mean,
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:25.840]  it's just incredibly cut and dry and only someone with their eyeballs gouged out,
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:30.240]  their ears, drums gouged out and their tongue cut out could not see what's happening or smell
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:34.560]  what's happening. Thank you, Kevin. James and Canada, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:40.800]  Oh, hi. Hello. Yes, sir. Go ahead. Okay. Hey, just quickly for all the Minnesotans,
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:44.400]  we got about six inches of ice up here in Winnipeg on the Red River and Lake Winnipeg's
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:49.360]  almost frozen. So you can fish right away. Just two points. I think you guys should really check
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:53.600]  out the new season of South Park. You have that snippet of the family guy episode. South Park
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:58.320]  season totally destroyed the PC narrative. It's a really great television. I don't normally watch
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:03.360]  South Park, though I've got to admit that the cayenne West gay fish thing is pretty good.
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:08.640]  And I like a little bit of cayenne pepper on my eggs. So I do watch that. Folks, I know his name
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:14.480]  is not cayenne. It's a joke. People say it's to Kanye. Oh, really? Butcher names on purpose.
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:20.000]  So expanding on that is one of my little jokes I do. I have seen a couple episodes of it. I mean,
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:25.360]  there's so much cussing. I can't let my kids watch it. But still, they kind of act like it's okay at
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:31.120]  the end. So I think it's kind of a mixed message. But yes, it is pretty hilarious. I've seen two
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:35.920]  episodes where Caitlyn Jenner is always running people over and it's beautiful and it's stunning
[02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:40.960]  and it's brave and you got the PC police principle. It's beating everyone up in a total tyrant and,
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:46.400]  you know, totally oppressive and they're using it to oppress people. So yes, it is dead on when it
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:52.720]  comes to that, but it's not strong enough in how dangerous it is. I appreciate your point on anything
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:57.600]  else. Well, yeah, just the last episode, I think really codifies what you were saying. But yeah,
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:02.240]  my last point is for all the Americans, get on the conservative bandwagon like your former
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:06.960]  guest from yesterday, Tommy said, we totally missed the conservative bandwagon up here in Canada.
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:10.960]  We elected the son of the worst socialist ever. Get into our government, you know,
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:14.320]  purely through those just the total bad persons look them up. But yeah,
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:18.320]  get on this conservative bandwagon. Trump won't be a constitutionally libertarian president,
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:22.960]  but he is damn better than anything else you guys are going to have. I appreciate your call, James.
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:28.240]  Look, look, when Bush was in power and the Patriot Act and the tyranny and the NSA,
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:33.680]  I was constantly attacking him and the Democrats coming after our guns. Now,
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:37.840]  if the Democrats were in power now doing all this, which they are, I would be against them.
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:41.600]  If the Republicans were in power, which they're not right now, I would be against them.
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.400]  And I'm against all the rhinos and neocons and, you know, John Boehner types.
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:53.120]  But the system is coming after the Tea Party. The system is coming after the Real Tea Party.
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:57.040]  They tried to coopt it. They tried to demonize it. They say Homeland Security is for it.
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:02.960]  Yet they are afraid of a libertarian movement, at least getting some type of debate going in
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:08.880]  the House and in the Senate, in the Congress. And their entire defense is set around Republicans
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:15.280]  and Democratic donors at the top giving money to defeat basically the Ron Paul type movement in
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:20.480]  Congress. And you got a Rand Paul, you got a Ted Cruz trying to act like they're the heirs to that.
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:23.920]  I hope they are. They're better than Hillary Clinton. They're not perfect. You got a Donald
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:29.360]  Trump who I don't completely trust, but overall has one of the better shots of winning. He's
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:33.120]  being demonized for saying things that Jimmy Carter did. Jimmy Carter stopped, you know,
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:37.120]  certain Muslim groups from coming in and kick people out of the country during that whole
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:42.560]  situation until they fixed the problem with the visas and the rest of it. He's right in my view.
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:47.520]  It's not that radical of a statement. What is radical is not screening any of these people,
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:52.000]  letting them come in, knowing they're going to have some attackers, then taking our freedoms.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:57.920]  That is a false flag. And joining us to discuss this is Wayne Madsen,
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:03.120]  one of the longest NSA whistleblowers out there. He did it back when they didn't lock you up for it,
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:07.360]  like Obama does. He's also written for some of the biggest publications in the country.
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:12.160]  And he formerly was in anti-submarine warfare in the Navy, then in the National Security Agency,
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:18.720]  running actually a whole division of internal security. And he's exposed the fact that they
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:25.840]  now use the NSA mainly to spy on government employees who might blow the whistle and on journalists.
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:30.800]  And believe me, we've experienced that here where I can be anywhere and they cops just call me up
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:35.920]  or my reporters get called up and they know exactly where we are, where we're driving
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:40.800]  through the cell phones without a warrant. What are you doing up there investigating
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:44.640]  Islamabad? We know you're at the corner of such, such, such, such. Well, how do you know that?
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:50.640]  We just know. There's some concerns you might be violent. Oh, but the Jihad
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:56.800] ville openly connected the past to serious stuff. They're okay. You see, and oh, nobody can track
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:01.600]  them. And oh, the governors don't know where they're going. They just release them. I'm going to skip
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:07.520]  this network break here. There's only one because I want to be able to give Wayne Madsen more time.
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:11.360]  Wayne, there's a lot of big news. You're about to break the day on 2016. A lot of big stuff
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:16.400]  happening. But overall, what do you think the big strategy is flooding Europe, flooding the US,
[02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:21.120]  doing no screening, letting plane loads of people from Latin America land and just walk through
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:27.440]  in front of everyone? I mean, is this just rubbing our noses in it? This this La La land or is it
[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:32.800]  the breakdown of government? What is Obama thinking for two days ordering the FBI to say
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:39.200]  San Bernardino wasn't terror? It finally blows up in his face. He's got to go on TV. The Russians
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:42.960]  are exposing the whole narrative that our government and others are running ISIS. That's
[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:48.720]  blowing up. I mean, are we seeing the collapse of the narrative here with top generals coming out
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:53.840]  saying we were ordered to run Al Qaeda and ISIS? I mean, these are devastating announcements being
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:59.840]  made and and huge investigations in Congress starting up and inspector general investigations.
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:03.840]  This looks like something that could really bring down a large wing of the globalist.
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:08.000]  Where do you see this going? What's the inside baseball up on Capitol Hill? Wayne Madsen?
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:13.520]  Well, I think what's going on and you mentioned what's going on on the southern border with
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:23.120]  again, it's this George Soros led operation to basically destabilize not only Europe,
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:30.320]  but also now Central America, the Caribbean. Soros is the social media that he has a lot
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:36.240]  of say and is now being used to convince a lot of Cubans. Look, there's relations with the US,
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:40.480]  go to Ecuador, go to Central America and make your way to the United States.
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:46.640]  Because guys like Marco Rubio, of course, will welcome you with open arms and you'll get a credit
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:54.160]  card, food stamps, driver's license, nirvana in America. The same thing is playing out in Europe,
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:19:00.720]  of course, where Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, basically did the same thing and
[02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:05.120]  she's in lockstep with Soros. He says Europe can take millions and millions of more
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:15.280]  migrants from Muslim countries and she's rewarded with Time Magazine making her person of the year.
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:21.200]  I mean, Time Magazine is an obvious and has been for a long time has been a CIA operation,
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:26.400]  going back to the mighty world, it's her days of Frank Wissner and George.
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:31.920]  Let me briefly inject to just back you up on that. They admit that the Nobel Prize is now a joke
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:36.400]  giving Henry Kissinger and Al Gore and others that even the committee admits they've made mistakes.
[02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:40.560]  It's too late and you've now used it as toilet paper. It is now a joke. It's like giving a
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:46.720]  Pulitzer Prize to, you know, an Obama speechwriter about Obamacare being free. It's a fraud and so
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:51.360]  yeah, Time Magazine is an admitted fraud with almost no circulation. So aren't they just putting
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:58.560]  final nails in their own coffin? I would hope so. I mean, as far as Merkel wearing that as a badge
[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:04.560]  of honor, being named person of the year by Time, Adolf Hitler was named twice a man of the year
[02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:11.680]  by Time Magazine. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't, if I were a Frau Merkel, I'd call her house
[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:17.840]  Frau Merkel because this lady, you know, I mean, she's obviously been inserted. She's not qualified
[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:25.520]  to run a German beer hall, let alone a country. But this is the, these are the kinds of people,
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:32.880]  the Soros of the world and these other democracy engineers quote unquote, they like to see the
[02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:38.480]  people that carry their water. And she's declared civil emergency and ban protests all over Germany.
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:43.440]  I mean, she is kind of Hitler. Yeah, not only that, but you know, remember we were told that
[02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:49.840]  there was no such thing as Sharia zones. You know, and they said, oh, that's a fantasy that that
[02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:56.400]  fake site called snopes.com said, oh, no, that's, that's a fake story. Well, in Germany, there are
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:03.040]  Sharia police zones now where these Sharia cops are coming up to Germans on the street,
[02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:09.680]  native Germans and telling them how to dress women, how to dress. And there was a big
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:19.920]  Bruhaha, you know, during Oktoberfest in Munich with some of these Sharia guys telling Germans to
[02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:25.840]  not drink in their presence. So, so who gets in trouble when a, when a beer mug goes over the
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:34.880]  head of one of these Sharia boys, you find the Germans are charged with hooliganism and xenophobia.
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:40.720]  And that's, that's what's playing out all through Europe now. They've got a huge problem over there.
[02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:50.480]  And public health problem. They've got these radical cells. I have a story up today about 10
[02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:58.240]  towns in Albania and the radical mosques have under the nose of NATO. Albania is a NATO country.
[02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:05.680]  And what under the nose of the Turks, another NATO country had been recruiting jihadists to go fight
[02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:14.080]  in Syria and Iraq. And this is all done from NATO countries. So here we go. This is what's going on.
[02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:23.920]  What is it about the kleptocratic left and the right wing that works with them
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:27.040]  that they really do seem like they want to bankrupt and wreck the West? I mean,
[02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:33.280]  why would you want to bring in third world radical Sunni populations that can't even get
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:37.840]  along with each other? I mean, they're not bringing in non radical Muslim groups that
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:43.840]  integrate quite nicely. Our government has a long term policy of wrecking secular governments,
[02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:49.200]  whether it be Mohammed Mosaddek or Gaddafi or Saddam Hussein, they demonize them and then
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:52.720]  lionize the most demonic groups you can imagine like Saudi Arabia.
[02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:59.440]  That's right. We've already had in German migrant camps rioting breaking out between
[02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:07.440]  Afghans who have been really radicalized under the Taliban and al-Qaeda and more moderate Syrian
[02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:16.480]  refugees, moderate as in quotes, because there's degrees of moderation among these migrants
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:22.960]  coming from these countries. But yeah, we're seeing it play out. So I mean, Syrians and Afghans have
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:28.400]  never really had to mix in their own countries, but they're being forced to live with each other
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:33.840]  in these camps in Germany. And of course, rioting is breaking out because the Syrians don't really
[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:41.840]  think the real radical Afghans are their cup of tea. Why are we seeing so many leftist and
[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:48.880]  feminist groups and others worshiping and making it sexy radical Islam and MSNBC? I'm having more
[02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:54.960]  and more of their pundits wearing headdresses, hijabs on television. What's the whole point of
[02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:59.280]  that when radical Islam is the most oppressive force against women I think we've ever seen?
[02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:07.200]  Yeah, it's to push this multiculturalism. The idea is that the migrants shouldn't become like
[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:15.200]  Germans or French or Danes or Swedes or Norwegians, that those countries should respect these 13th
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:23.440]  century rituals and this culture that these migrants are bringing into these democratically
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:29.600]  advanced countries in Europe and also in North America. But yeah, you're right. It's part of the
[02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:38.240]  Soros and this other agenda because what Soros does is he actually thrives on chaos. Chaos is
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:44.160]  good for him. I've written this. He makes the perfect James Bond villain because he's everywhere
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:54.800]  around the world. And so when he backs somebody like this Eurovision winner, this Conchito Wurst,
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:25:05.040]  which is an Austrian crossdresser with a beard and a breast. I mean, this is the type of person
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:11.840]  that people like Soros hold up as examples. That and Femin and this other group of women,
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:18.960]  and I won't mention their name. Again, they talk about women's rights yet. One of their
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:25.920]  their their most hallowed singing groups is this group of women. They were really trial
[02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:36.480]  ups who use as part of their name a crude and crass name for female anatomy. Well, it's purely
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:43.440]  to destabilize culture. Soros admits that he told 60 minutes 15 years ago. He said, I'm not ashamed
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:50.320]  of what I did. Rounding people up for Nazi Germany. It made me survive. Yeah. Yes. And he's been
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:57.200]  backing all of Obama's initiatives and he'll be back. He's backing Hillary. He was behind the scenes
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:03.920]  during Bill Clinton's administration and he's there under Obama. And if Hillary Clinton's
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:11.760]  elected president, he'll be right there still practicing his political alchemy. Wayne Madsen
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:16.480]  Wayne Madsen report.com joins us. He's also an author. You can find his books there. He also
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:21.840]  is a reporter, roving reporter from full wars.com. Now, I want to go to phone calls in the next
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:28.160]  segment, cover some other issues, 800-259-9231 is the number any subjects find because Wayne can
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:33.440]  speak to all of them. But other areas you're looking into some of the other stories. And I know
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:37.200]  you're looking at some of the latest sex scandals with some of the candidates. You're looking at
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:42.160]  some other big issues. What are some of those topics you're about to tell us about? Well,
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:47.600]  Marco Rubio's got to be one of the luckiest guys in the world because just as it was getting ready
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:53.680]  to break about his extramarital affair with a lobbyist, a well-known lobbyist in Washington,
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:27:00.160]  Donald Trump, of course, makes this comment about Muslims. And it's all over, of course,
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:10.240]  the news cycle. And I was looking into this Rubio report. And so was the mainstream media.
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:17.920]  But then, of course, Trump, his comments, no pun intended, trumped the Rubio story. Now,
[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:25.120]  I find it interesting that all of a sudden the Tampa Bay Times and other newspapers are running a
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:32.000]  report about Rubio's brother-in-law being a well-known convicted international narcotics
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.240]  dealer. Well, this is actually an old story. Yeah. I mean, that means he fits in nicely with the
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:41.360]  Bushes and the Clintons then. Oh, absolutely. Look, you know, if there were journalists down in
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:47.200]  Miami at the Miami Herald that were like the old-time journalists, Marco Rubio would have never
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:54.080]  gotten elected to the school board or a dog catcher. Because I'm thinking about the old-time
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:28:00.720]  journalists were like Rottweilers. When they would sink their teeth into a corrupted candidate
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:06.720]  or politician, they wouldn't let go. Now, these were old school people. These journalists sometimes
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:12.640]  kept the flasks whiskey in their desk drawer. But, you know, they got the job done. And we don't have
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:21.760]  that. You turn on these 24 by 7 news channels and you think you're at some sort of wine and cheese
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:28.880]  party for a bunch of members of the ACLU and PETA and... Yeah, you're going to think you're one
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:33.760]  of these wine tasting deals where they discuss body parts sales and the rest of it. Absolutely.
[02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:39.840]  I mean, Rubio, do you think this could bring him down or is even a contender now?
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:49.120]  Well, I think, you know, the deal on Rubio is he's come out as the establishment candidate.
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:54.640]  Now, the word is that it's Jeb Bush and Carl Rove that are behind going after Rubio. Remember,
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:59.360]  Jeb said, look, he's now a fair game. They used to be buddies, but Jeb said he's fair game. So,
[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:07.680]  I guess in Bush's mind that if he can bring down Rubio, he'll pick up all the Rubio supporters.
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:13.840]  Yeah, the Florida. The Florida people. But a lot of people in Florida do not like Jeb Bush. So,
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:18.000]  I don't think the Rubio supporters will go... Well, that's right. In fact, Jeb said about
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:22.000]  December 15th, Trump would be done months ago. That hasn't happened. I want to come back and
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:26.160]  ask you your take on Trump, your real view on him. Don't, I mean, don't mince words. Obviously,
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:31.360]  you wouldn't. But, I mean, is he good? Is he bad? Is he a mix? I want to get Wayne Madsen's view on
[02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:38.160]  Trump and Ted Cruz as well as he takes the lead in Iowa ahead of the big CNN debate tonight,
[02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:42.800]  seven o'clock central. We're going to be covering it live, play by play, from the

[02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:05.600]  The LAPD and private security are targeting random people with stop and frisk searches
[02:30:05.600 --> 02:30:10.880]  on public sidewalks before the premiere of Star Wars, The Force Awakens. Police have also installed
[02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:16.880]  metal detectors on the sidewalks near the famous TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood, California.
[02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:22.080]  Someone took to Twitter to post a picture of a Wookiee having his bag searched. The caption reads,
[02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:26.720]  security will be tight for the latest hashtag Star Wars premiere tonight. Metal detectors
[02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:33.920]  have been set up. TMZ reported, LAPD and private security officers are already blanketing several
[02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:39.120]  square blocks around the famed Chinese theater where the Force Awakens event is going down.
[02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:43.840]  We've learned anyone strolling through the area could be searched, frisked and even wandered
[02:30:43.840 --> 02:30:49.680]  with metal detectors. In other words, even people not associated with the event who are simply passing
[02:30:49.680 --> 02:31:09.680]  through a public area are subject to a warrantless search. You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:07.680]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak. We think just let me think.
[02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:13.040]  Even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way.
[02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:18.000]  It's Chancellor Sutler. Damn it. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used
[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:24.640]  in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words are for the means to meaning
[02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:32.240]  and for those who will listen, the enunciation of the truth. There is something terribly wrong
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:35.920]  with this country, isn't there? You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You told me
[02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:41.040]  every television in London. Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and depression.
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:45.360]  And where once you had the freedom to object and don't think and speak as you saw fit,
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:49.600]  you now have senses and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:56.160]  subjecting your submachine. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well, certainly there are those
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:01.920]  who are more responsible than others. They will be held accountable. But again, truth be told,
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:08.720]  if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it.
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:15.840]  I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror and disease. There were a myriad of problems
[02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:22.400]  which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:28.160]  and in your panic you turned to the now high Chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order,
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:33.200]  he promised you peace. And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:46.800]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:55.680]  sides has come. We are the resistance. We are the Info War. I'm Alex Jones, your host, Wayne
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:59.840]  Madsen, InfoWars.com investigative journalist. He's writing shot done with us. I want to go to
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:05.280]  James and Marcus and Steve and Mike and Dion and others here in about 5, 10 minutes. I want to
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:11.280]  continue with the news and analysis with Wayne Madsen. First off, this operation, being able to
[02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:17.360]  send Wayne Madsen out at the CIA air base in Arizona, being able to send our reporters to
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:22.800]  Switzerland to report on Bilderberg, being able to send our reporters to the RNC and DNC coming up
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:28.560]  this year and next year to be able to send our reporters out to cover the radiation on the West
[02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:33.840]  Coast first years ago, which they now admit mainstream news is exactly as we said. So many
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:39.920]  times we force stories out into the dinosaur media and that's really our job. You can see my
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:45.360]  talking points, my points becoming mainstream. We're having a big effect. Thanks to you,
[02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:50.800]  the world now knows criminals run our government and they're running Al Qaeda and others and allowing
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:56.560]  them to attack us. Hillary and Jeb are in deep trouble and of course that's not all info wars,
[02:35:56.560 --> 02:36:03.360]  it's many other groups and organizations. But we are a radicalizing force. The truth is we've been
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:08.800]  very on our back. We've been very lazy. We've been into trance as a people. We've had it pretty good
[02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:14.640]  and now as tyranny comes in, folks are starting to wake up. So when I say I'm here to radicalize you,
[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:18.480]  I'm just here to get you awake and taking action and the globalists see that as radical because
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:25.200]  they truly are radical criminals usurping and enslaving us. And to fund ourselves, I've had to
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:30.480]  be inventive. I've had to discover what people really want. I've had to research what I really like.
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:37.200]  I've gone through a lot to get sponsors to fund this operation, to try to pay our people a good
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:42.880]  wage so they can be focused and take care of their families. No one else has been able to build
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:47.840]  a media operation outside of big establishment money. And even the biggest radio shows in this
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:55.920]  country that are on 600 stations don't have one, one, 15th, because I know the numbers, of our
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:37:01.200]  budget. And we live in a place where it's not very expensive in Texas. Let's help us do this as well.
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:06.720]  I could have maybe 15, 20 employees in New York or LA. We've got 50 and we've got contractors and
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:11.600]  we've got reporters and researchers and customer service and, you know, legal and accounting and
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:17.120]  we do it all by the book. And we're exponentially reaching more people and we're trying to hire
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:24.640]  more folks like and bring Wayne Madsen on and others. So infowarstore.com, you know when you buy

[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:42.560]  in the fight against tyranny. We don't get MPR money, 450 million a year of taxpayer. We don't

[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:55.920]  funding. They say we didn't build our operation. The people built this operation. I built this
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:00.400]  operation. People's love of liberty built this. How dare these government funded institutions
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:04.880]  sit there and say you didn't build something. You didn't pass that test. You didn't play that song.
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:09.600]  You didn't write that poetry. You didn't plant that garden. You didn't go make those lunches at
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:14.800]  school. You didn't work on that car. You didn't fix that tooth. You didn't fix that broken leg.
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:19.920]  You didn't write that article. You didn't go work at the checkout line killing your feet for 12 hours.
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:29.040]  I'm sick of it. Info wars was built by we the people. We the people are where the real change
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:35.360]  starts. Not the fake globalist change with more tyranny. So infowarstore.com free shipping until

[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:09.600]  Wayne Madsen, I always say this to guests and especially with you. I've been all over the
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:13.520]  board. I've covered some topics I wanted to get into. I want to go to some calls with you, but
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:17.200]  what else is big? What else are you working on? What's the next big shoe to drop?
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:22.960]  And just overall, how are things going for the new world order right now? The Syria situation,
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:26.240]  I've got to really be proud of what Russia's been doing with the moral high ground.
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:29.120]  It looks to me like the globalists are not doing too well.
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:37.200]  Well, it's, you know, Russia militarily intervening in Syria basically was their drawing
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:44.160]  the line in the Syrian sand saying, look, we saw what you did with Libya. That's now a failed state.
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:52.240]  We saw what you did with Iraq. That's a failed state. We saw what you did in our own backyard
[02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:58.480]  in Ukraine. And now that's a failed state. And they just said, that's it. We aren't going to
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:04.400]  put up with it anymore. They basically finally called out Erdogan, the Turkish president for
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:14.160]  what he really is. He's a neo Ottoman empire, neo Seljuk emperor. He wants to restore the old
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:23.920]  Muslim caliphate. And of course, ISIS is, they're his shock troops in Syria and Iraq to carry this
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:35.360]  out. So now there's been some military confrontations between Russia and Turkey. And I think if
[02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:45.280]  NATO wants to back a neo Islamist Ottoman member state and try to and have article five invoke,
[02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:52.240]  like, you know, a Russian altercation with the Turkish military as if the Russian, you know,
[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:58.160]  shot an American plane out of the sky, I think a lot of members of NATO are going to say, no,
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:07.600]  we didn't sign up to go to war for an egomaniac, a sociopath like Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:11.760]  president. So it has been over the top, how the Russians released all the satellite data,
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:17.680]  the proof of thousands of trucks coming across to his son getting the oil. Turkey now going into
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:23.120]  Iraq, threatening Putin, threatening to blow up their ships in the Mediterranean. This is
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:31.280]  extremely arrogant behavior. Yeah. And I think now we see John Kerry in Moscow and he's, remember,
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:36.080]  we tried to freeze out Russia. Now we're going hand in hand to the Russians. The Russians are
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:41.040]  going to say, we'll talk to you, but it's going to be on our terms, not on, not on the terms of
[02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:48.000]  people like Victorian Newland, this neocon in the State Department that's been trying to not only
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:53.760]  overthrow, well, she was involved in the overthrow of the Ukrainian democratically elected president,
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:57.200]  but she's involved in trying to cause problems in Russia itself.
[02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:04.480]  What do you make of just the over the top moves of former top generals,
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:12.000]  like the head of Defense Intelligence and others coming out and going, look, we created al-Qaeda,
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:16.400]  ISIS, we're running this in Syria, we were ordered to by the president, it's conscious,
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:20.080]  it's bad, we shouldn't be doing it. And the media trying to spin that and now
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:26.800]  these investigations, I mean, am I underestimating or overestimating how huge this is?
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:32.960]  It's big when you have people that are being fired from their jobs in the military because of
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:40.240]  what they, and you know, the general Flynn you're talking about, the former commander of the Defense
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:44.720]  Intelligence Agency, you know, he didn't say anything while he was on active duty. He said this
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:51.840]  afterwards and I would just hope that in the future, these individuals would come back in
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:57.280]  government in positions of authority and we should be getting rid of, we shouldn't even have people
[02:43:57.280 --> 02:44:02.640]  like Ashton Carter, he's a bureaucratic pencil sharpener. I was about to say, I'm not one of
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:07.760]  these guys that says let generals run everything and elect a bunch of generals, but at the same time
[02:44:07.760 --> 02:44:13.760]  to see the military being restraining Obama from wanting to start wars, wanting to back ISIS more
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:19.520]  openly. I'm not trying to make the military the heroes, but they have been the restraining force
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:25.200]  to a great extent. That's really scary. Well, I understand what's at stake. If we go to war
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:32.560]  on behalf of these Turks against Russia, you know, we're going to have some real problems where
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:37.920]  it's not, you know, it's not 100 body bags coming back, think in terms of 10,000,
[02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:47.600]  hundreds of thousands potentially. And, you know, being on the precipice of possible nuclear war
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:52.400]  is a radicalized Islamic government in Turkey worth all that.
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:56.880]  Yeah, also Turkey can de-Christianize a country, kill hundreds of thousands of Christians,
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:45:01.200]  blow up every church they find. Why would our elite want to do something like this
[02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:05.280]  to a country that did nothing to us? Why would they want to set Qaddafi up after eight years of
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:09.360]  him investing in Europe, doing whatever he was told, getting rid of his weapons, letting the West
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:14.480]  in, letting all the U.S. companies come in, and then they literally bring in Al Qaeda and set him
[02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:19.840]  up and murdering. And then Hillary makes jokes about it. Yeah, and you know, our good friends
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:26.960]  of Saudis pulled it fast when yesterday they announced the formation of like a 36 member
[02:45:26.960 --> 02:45:32.320]  country Islamic military alliance. Now a lot of these countries are in Africa and they have as
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:39.280]  many Christians living there as they do Muslims. And I think this is just a means by the Saudis
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:46.560]  to try to introduce yet more radical jihadists into countries like Senegal and the Ivory Coast
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:52.960]  and Gabon and spread the influence of Boko Haram, because whatever the Saudis say,
[02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:57.920]  you got to look at the opposite. And I was actually happy that not only Donald Trump said,
[02:45:57.920 --> 02:46:05.200]  you know, the Saudis and the Turks are backing ISIL, but he said there's other countries doing it
[02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:11.520]  as well. He didn't name the other one. But he said I can't get into it because I have business
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:16.880]  dealings. I think it's pretty clear the other country he mentioned was Israel. And I just wish
[02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:23.120]  he would get his facts right about the people celebrating 9-11 in North Jersey were not Muslims.
[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:28.400]  They were in and there weren't a lot of them, but they were in key locations. They were Israeli
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:34.720]  citizens, Mossad agents, dressed up as Arabs. That's that's what I found when I spent two months
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:37.760]  in that area. And not only we've talked to some of the police officers, that's what they thought.
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:40.800]  But over in the Middle East, there was some celebrating and their has been celebrating,
[02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:44.800]  you know, at the sports stadiums and stuff. But you are right about that being a mixed
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:48.400]  mixed situation. Probably what a psychological warfare operation.
[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:52.400]  Yeah, when they were caught, they were caught with money. They were caught with Arab dress. They were
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:57.920]  they were caught with traces of explosives in their vans. They used a moving system,
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:04.080]  urban moving systems vans. So that they were the ones who were seen at Liberty State Park,
[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:10.640]  dressed as Arabs celebrating. They that same group was caught later on that afternoon and they all
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:15.760]  the FBI and the police confiscated their Israeli passports.
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:19.920]  Wow, super heavy. Donald Trump overall, what do you think about him? I want to go to some calls.
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:27.600]  You know, it's very rare we see these populist candidates catch fire. I remember 1968, we saw
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:33.600]  it with George Wallace, who started to really not only have an impact in the south, he had the south,
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:40.720]  but he started to make an impact up north. People may not remember, but he won in northern primaries.
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:47.120]  He won northern primaries like he was doing well in Indiana. He was doing well in Pennsylvania.
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:52.400]  He won Maryland. Of course, it was after he was shot. He did well in Wisconsin. He did well in
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:58.720]  Massachusetts. These are not, so these were not his natural constituencies, but people wanted
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:05.120]  to hear his populist message. We saw it again with Ross Perot in 92. Again, somebody who had a lot
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:12.320]  of money at his disposal, like Trump does. His message started to catch on, but then we had
[02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:19.200]  him pull out of the race. He was running around 33% as an independent, and then he accused George
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:24.640]  HW Bush of trying to sabotage his family, and he pulled out, and that was the end of his campaign.
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:34.400]  I would suspect that many of the people were seeing, or many of the symptoms of this country
[02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:40.160]  where we see Trump getting a lot of support, were also manifested in the support for Perot
[02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:48.720]  in 92, and Wallace in 68, because people fed up with the two major parties, and it's the same
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:53.920]  people. You want Bush, you want Clinton. Oh, if you don't want them, well, maybe we'll bring back
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:59.760]  Romney. Oh, how about Lindsey Graham? I mean, these people, we've seen him.
[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:04.560]  What do you particularly yourself think about Trump, and where do you, in your gut, think he's
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:11.440]  going? Well, I think he's playing the spoiler, like we see with a lot of these populist candidates.
[02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:18.640]  We'll see what happens. I mean, there's already talk of a brokered convention. That's the gray
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:24.960]  beards in the Republican Party, the elitists talking about maybe picking a candidate behind closed
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:30.560]  doors in Cleveland. And having the delegates all vote for it? Yeah, I would imagine in that case,
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:35.600]  we'll see Trump walk out, maybe declare he's going to run as an independent. It might be kind
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:40.960]  of late in the game to get on ballots. It's very hard, for example, in Virginia and Texas to get
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:48.400]  on ballots for presidential races, but we may see something like that occur. I don't think he's
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:54.880]  going away, even though people like Bush and some of these others would like to see him go away.
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:50:00.640]  Right. Doesn't Trump have an ace of spades card that if he does leave the third party
[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:04.880]  from the Republicans, if they try to steal the nomination from him, that that would probably
[02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:11.200]  ensure Hillary won? Yeah, he'll play the same spoiler role that a row played in 92. There's
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:16.640]  another thing about Trump. You know, he's been vetted by the tabloids ever since the 80s. I
[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:22.240]  remember seeing articles about Trump in People Magazine with all that, you know, his celebrity
[02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:27.680]  status. So the celebrity focused media and the tabloids have pretty well vetted him. We know
[02:50:27.680 --> 02:50:33.280]  about all his ex-wives and all that. So there's nothing more there, in my opinion, that can be
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:37.840]  discovered. So he is the ace of spades in this election. He will decide it probably. Yeah, not
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:42.960]  like Rubio where his, you know, the high heel shoes are dropping all over on Rubio right now
[02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:50.240]  and his family is passed and not only involved in drug dealing, but also in maybe one of his
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:57.680]  brother-in-law's, the guy he worked for, the drug cartel leader may have also an ATS agent.
[02:50:57.680 --> 02:51:02.800]  Wow, let's stay there coming back with calls. Winter has just begun and are you already tired

[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:26.400]  In California at movie theaters, but all over the country, and George Lucas came out and said,
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:32.000]  don't bring toy guns. A lot of the Star Wars folks do that. It's super nerdly. I almost want to get
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:37.120]  into it because it's so stupid. And just, you know, don't bring the toy guns or stormtrooper
[02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:42.640]  outfits, I guess. And so talk about a nation going into bondage and cowardice and slavery.
[02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:47.680]  They bring in the radicals, they let them attack us, and then they're going to have police with
[02:54:47.680 --> 02:54:51.680]  metal detectors all over the place. This was the plan with Homeland Security more than a decade
[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:55.840]  ago, was to have checkpoints everywhere. And now they're starting out with the Viper teams and more.
[02:54:56.560 --> 02:55:01.120]  Joe Biggs with reports of strange activities at public schools, state of emergency has been
[02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:05.120]  declared in Michigan because children have high amounts of lead in their blood. Gun grabbers are
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:10.320]  pushing no fly to a buy. Joe Biggs will be sitting in with him as one of his guests. That's all
[02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:14.320]  coming up in the fourth hour. I'm going to do five minutes to the next hour to take your calls
[02:55:14.320 --> 02:55:18.640]  with investigative journalist Wayne Madsen. Of course, I'm Alex Jones and I'll be part of the
[02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:24.640]  live coverage tonight with the crew that'll be here. I'll be at home covering the 2016 election,
[02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:32.640]  the final Republican debate of 2015 tonight from seven and beyond central at info wars news.com,
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:40.400]  free video feeds at info wars.com. Right now, let's go to who is up first. Let's talk to Steve in
[02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:48.240]  Canada. You're on the air with Wayne Madsen. Go ahead. Well, hello, Alex. Hello, my friend. Yeah.
[02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:51.760]  Thank you very much for taking my call. I just want to say congratulations on everything you're
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:55.760]  doing. It's very good. But my question to you, you kind of touched on it a little bit there is
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:56:01.360]  I'm just curious why our military just you're not sorry, your military are military, everything,
[02:56:01.360 --> 02:56:05.360]  but why they don't why they go along with everything? Well, because you get toward
[02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:09.280]  Marshall, they're murdered if you've been a bunch of generals under Clinton got shot in the head or
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:13.040]  shot in the chest in their offices. So they've been firing them, removing them. It's a big deal
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:16.800]  to have them retire and then come out and say the government ordered us to run al-Qaeda.
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:22.000]  Then it's up to us to get the system in trouble. But but I agree, we need more military as Steve
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:27.040]  Pachinic said last week, you know, to do the right thing and say no. Following orders is not a
[02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:33.120]  suicide pack for the country. Great point, Steve. Comment on that, Wayne Madsen. Well, you know,
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:40.000]  leadership is in short supply in many cases in the military. But some of our greatest military
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:45.440]  leaders were those who actually did not follow orders. And some of them were court marshals,
[02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:52.160]  some of them got in trouble for their actions. But but yeah, you see a lot of brown noses today,
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:59.520]  especially in the senior positions in the military. And but it's nice to see when a general Flynn
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:07.840]  does come out and say, look, you know, this policy is crazy. We're supporting the enemy here.
[02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:12.640]  And the generals also need to be scaring all these slimy Harvard lawyers and hedge fund people
[02:57:12.640 --> 02:57:16.800]  that are complete gamblers, degenerate, crazy gamblers. Hey, you're not going to gamble with
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:21.680]  nuclear war with the Chinese and the Russians. No, you're not going to do it scum. Stop it. Stop it.
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:28.000]  Right. Not all these generals are put through like General Petraeus Ivy League schools where they
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:33.120]  become basically, you know, the same thing as what you find in the neocon think tanks,
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:38.960]  only they're wearing uniforms with a bunch of stars on their shoulders or colors. So
[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:44.400]  there are some flag rank officers that came up the normal way and they don't put up with this.
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:49.600]  I wish there were more of them. But unfortunately, it's the military like everything is political.
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:53.120]  That's right, because we're not Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia. We don't run around starting
[02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:58.480]  giant wars. Right. I mean, it needs this in America is not perfect, folks, but it's really
[02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:02.640]  crazy right now. Thank you for those points. Excellent points. Matt and Colorado got about
[02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:07.120]  a minute. We'll answer your question after the break. Go ahead. Hello, Alex. Thank you for all
[02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:14.960]  you do. Just a quick question for you and Wade Madsen. If Donald Trump does not get in to be
[02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:20.480]  the president and it does end up being Hillary Clinton backed by Bernie Sanders to be vice
[02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:26.080]  president, do you think we still have a fighting chance or do you think we're done for as a nation?
[02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:30.160]  We're going to break in 20 seconds. That's a great question. I'll have you come back to that.
[02:58:30.160 --> 02:58:34.560]  Wayne, what do you think? You know, I did not hear the question. For some reason,
[02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:38.480]  the audio didn't get sent over to you on that call. We'll come back. I'll ask you the question.
[02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:42.240]  Are we screwed if Hillary and Bernie get in? Are they the worst? Where do you see that going?
[02:58:42.240 --> 02:58:48.000]  We'll be back in four. Visit gcm.infowars.com forward slash show. Jakari's coming up.

[03:00:20.880 --> 03:00:24.080]  About five minutes, I'm getting up. Gari's coming in here in the war room. You won't be in the
[03:00:24.080 --> 03:00:29.040]  situation room today. We're gearing up for tonight's coverage. Wayne Madsen's our guest.
[03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:34.320]  Who is worse? A Jeb Bush or a Hillary candidacy? What happens if Hillary gets in? I mean,
[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:38.560]  I'm telling you, Wayne, I'm not supporting Bush or Hillary. I think Hillary'd be better, though,
[03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:42.320]  because she's already got so much even more corruption than Jeb. I think we could take
[03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:47.600]  her down quicker. In my gut, I think Hillary would be better than Jeb because she's more
[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:54.320]  defeatable. What do you think? Well, they're both bad news. I remember Hillary, of course, about
[03:00:54.320 --> 03:01:01.760]  Gaddafi. We saw he died, and then we got that cackling hen thing. I don't know if the country can
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:06.560]  put out with four to eight years of her cackling. Actually, actually, electing the Wicked Witch of
[03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:12.240]  the East? Yeah, yeah. I mean, maybe somebody should throw some water on her and see if she melts.
[03:01:12.240 --> 03:01:20.000]  But anyway, no, I mean, yeah, it's bad on both sides. I mean, you know, everybody's talking
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:24.560]  about Hillary, but can you imagine Bill Clinton's going to be back in the White House with nothing
[03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:32.160]  to do? I fear for every intern in the White House because he'll just be running around as the first
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:39.120]  spouse. God only knows what could happen in the White House then. By the way, I have one more
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:45.920]  piece here that I wanted to mention to you when it's silly. China is now buying Canadian air bottles
[03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:52.320]  with pressurized mountain air from Canada and actually breathing it because the smog is so bad
[03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:56.400]  in China. But under global warming, they want us to cut our carbon even though we're clean.
[03:01:56.400 --> 03:02:01.760]  This is literally out of space balls. Can we cue up the space balls clip? Bottles of Canadian fresh
[03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:10.080]  air, a hot sales item in China. I mean, China has gotten so incredibly, so incredibly polluted
[03:02:10.080 --> 03:02:14.400]  that their rivers are catching on fire. So you talk about fiction becoming reality. Here's the
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:37.920]  clip from space balls. It's Perry air. Perry air. And then he goes on to deny that there's any
[03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:44.640]  problem with the air. But that is actually a classic clip. What do you make of that, Wayne Madsen?
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:50.000]  I remember it was people say that it was ludicrous the thought of buying water, bottled
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:54.480]  water. They say, well, you know, I drink out of the tap and now we know we can't do that anymore.
[03:02:55.920 --> 03:03:00.800]  So what would be next selling air? Yeah, here's an example of it.
[03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:08.160]  But, you know, yeah, this is, you know, in China, I was there a couple of years ago,
[03:03:08.160 --> 03:03:12.160]  I happened to be there. Fortunately, when they did not have this small problem,
[03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:19.520]  but when they have it, it's pretty awful. And China and Saudi Arabia, of course,
[03:03:20.320 --> 03:03:27.200]  were really reluctant to go along with this agreement in Paris because they were fearful of
[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:33.520]  their own sovereign ability to make decisions. Absolutely. But you talk about ludicrous in
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:38.640]  space balls, they have ludicrous speed and then plaid speed, which is faster than warp speed.
[03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:45.520]  Right, right. I mean, I think a lot of this is, it's incredible. I mean, who would have
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:52.000]  ever predicted somebody selling air? But then again, I remember when people said it was ludicrous to
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:57.920]  sell bottled water. Well, I don't have time to do their callers, Marcus, Harvey, others. I guarantee
[03:03:57.920 --> 03:04:02.480]  a jikari wants to talk to you, try to get to everybody. But the fourth hour is now basically
[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:08.640]  here. And so I'm going to punch out Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com. Give us your next pitch
[03:04:08.640 --> 03:04:11.120]  or where you want to go, what you want to cover. I want to kind of put you out there
[03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:15.440]  on the campaign trail some RNC DNC. We just start getting you credentialed or you can do that
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:19.440]  through your own system if you'd like. But we'd have a meeting soon about what you're going to
[03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:22.800]  be doing here for the election. And thank you so much for the great articles that appear,
[03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:26.720]  basically four or five times a week at info wars.com that you're right for us, Wayne.
[03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:33.760]  Yes, Rubio's next. All right, my friend, thank you so much. All right, jikari Jackson is going
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:37.600]  to be coming in here into the hot seat. It is hot as the polar bears been sitting here.
[03:04:38.160 --> 03:04:43.360]  And then we are going to continue on until tonight, seven o'clock central with info wars
[03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:51.280]  nightly news and the live coverage of the final debate of the Republicans in 2015 from a beautiful
[03:04:51.280 --> 03:05:03.600]  Las Vegas, Nevada. Let's get ready to rumble. Another GOP debate is upon us. A time to see
[03:05:03.600 --> 03:05:08.800]  how much attention will be allotted to establishment candidates who are dragging in the polls.
[03:05:08.800 --> 03:05:13.440]  These are Republican governors. They don't give any credit to the free market. They don't give
[03:05:13.440 --> 03:05:19.360]  any credit to the entrepreneur. All is not lost, though. Some are speaking on real issues.
[03:05:19.360 --> 03:05:24.320]  But if you're not going to respond to a no fly zone strategy, what would yours be?
[03:05:24.880 --> 03:05:28.720]  The first thing I would do is I wouldn't arm our enemies. I wouldn't.
[03:05:31.120 --> 03:05:36.400]  Will controversial statements impact some of the candidates? Donald J. Trump is calling for a
[03:05:36.400 --> 03:05:44.160]  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives
[03:05:45.040 --> 03:05:52.240]  can figure out what the hell is going on. Join info wars this Tuesday, December 15th,

[03:08:08.960 --> 03:08:14.560]  Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now.
[03:08:14.560 --> 03:08:19.440]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the
[03:08:19.440 --> 03:08:24.080]  important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea
[03:08:24.080 --> 03:08:31.760]  that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you.
[03:08:32.960 --> 03:08:38.320]  They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations.
[03:08:38.320 --> 03:08:41.840]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, and city halls.
[03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:45.600]  They've got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they
[03:08:45.600 --> 03:08:50.400]  control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:58.400]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines
[03:08:58.400 --> 03:09:03.120]  and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay,
[03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:07.440]  the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that
[03:09:07.440 --> 03:09:12.640]  disappears the minute you go to collect it. And now they're coming for your social security money
[03:09:12.640 --> 03:09:19.680]  so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street. It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[03:09:19.680 --> 03:09:25.360]  And you said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[03:09:25.360 --> 03:09:30.240]  You better believe it. So what specifically did they do? If I ask them, if I need them,
[03:09:30.240 --> 03:09:34.720]  you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to just so you understand a lot of money.
[03:09:34.720 --> 03:09:40.320]  You and I are not in the big club. The owners of this country know the truth.
[03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:44.720]  It's called the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:50.640]  But I'll tell you what they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens capable
[03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:55.360]  of critical thinking. They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[03:09:55.360 --> 03:10:00.480]  They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their interest. That's right.
[03:10:00.480 --> 03:10:05.440]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:10:11.840 --> 03:10:17.280]  All right. And welcome back to the Alex Jones show, Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs here in studio.
[03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:21.600]  And we're going to talk about many things in our hour here. We're going to take calls a little bit
[03:10:21.600 --> 03:10:26.560]  later. We're going to talk about gun grabbers, you know, pushing the no fly, no buy list, many other
[03:10:26.560 --> 03:10:30.320]  things. But first, as I have Joe Biggs here in studio, we're going to talk about some things that are
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:36.320]  going on in our nation's schools. And one of them is a new article from David Knight, Turkish
[03:10:36.320 --> 03:10:42.400]  E-Moms, USA Network of Schools to be investigated as part of a lawsuit. The Turkish government has
[03:10:42.400 --> 03:10:47.600]  filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania against the powerful Turkish Islamic clerk. I believe the name is Gulen.
[03:10:48.320 --> 03:10:52.880]  The lawsuit alleges that Gulen issued orders from within the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania,
[03:10:52.880 --> 03:10:58.240]  directing his well-placed religious followers residing in Turkey to launch a targeted campaign,
[03:10:58.240 --> 03:11:03.840]  a persecution using a network of loyal state officials, police, prosecutors, judges, and so
[03:11:03.840 --> 03:11:10.240]  forth in Turkey willing to do his bidding. But the kicker about this is, while Gulen's network
[03:11:10.240 --> 03:11:14.960]  of influence in Turkey is allegedly based on infiltration of police and the judiciary,
[03:11:15.520 --> 03:11:19.520]  the rest of the world is influenced by his schools. And the estimates are that they have
[03:11:19.520 --> 03:11:25.920]  about 300 schools in Turkey, 1,000 worldwide. In the United States, they have about 146 taxpayer
[03:11:25.920 --> 03:11:31.760]  funded charter schools as of September 2014. And they just opened up one here in Austin as well.
[03:11:31.760 --> 03:11:38.080]  So if you go to the actual article and watch the video that's linked in there,
[03:11:38.080 --> 03:11:41.360]  David Knight actually talks about that school that they just opened here.
[03:11:41.360 --> 03:11:45.280]  I mean, there's a lot of these places that are popping up. We were doing this investigation of
[03:11:45.280 --> 03:11:53.200]  the American Caliphate. The Islamberg is not just a commune where they house Muslims. It's also
[03:11:53.200 --> 03:11:57.840]  a Quranic Institute where they teach this kind of stuff. From the outside looking in,
[03:11:57.840 --> 03:12:02.480]  it might look like a peaceful thing that's going on where everyone's just kind of happy and they're
[03:12:02.480 --> 03:12:07.280]  learning. But that's all you can say is from the outside looking in. Not many people can go into
[03:12:07.280 --> 03:12:11.600]  these places and actually go in and investigate and find out what's really going on. So it's
[03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:16.800]  interesting. It's something that will add to our list when we are continuing this investigation of
[03:12:16.800 --> 03:12:21.760]  the American Caliphate and actually dig into this deeper and see if we can find out what's going on
[03:12:21.760 --> 03:12:27.040]  with this school. And as Joe alluded to, David did do a report about this video report so you
[03:12:27.040 --> 03:12:31.840]  can find that linked in the article. Now, Biggs, I saw this article the other day and I really
[03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:37.760]  wanted to get your opinion on it. And the headline is parent school at odds over teens flag photo.
[03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:42.480]  And we can pull it up here so we can show all of our viewers. I'll describe it to our listeners
[03:12:42.480 --> 03:12:48.480]  who are listening on the radio. Basically, this is a high school student. A lot of times for your
[03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:51.920]  senior pictures, they allow you to get a professional photographer to take your own pictures and all
[03:12:51.920 --> 03:12:57.360]  of that. And the young lady, she's having controversy. It's not because of what she's wearing
[03:12:57.360 --> 03:13:02.080]  because a lot of times we see like the kids, they wear something that's provocative or whatever.
[03:13:02.080 --> 03:13:07.600]  She's very nicely dressed, nothing sticking out, nothing sensational about it. But as you
[03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:12.240]  can see, she's standing in front of a very large American flag that is so large it actually hits
[03:13:12.240 --> 03:13:18.320]  the floor and she is standing on the flag. And the school's reason for banning this photo is
[03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:23.680]  because she's actually standing on the American flag. So, Joe Biggs, as a military man, a combat
[03:13:23.680 --> 03:13:30.960]  veteran, what say you about this yearbook photo? I mean, is it actually a large American flag or
[03:13:30.960 --> 03:13:35.600]  is this just some kind of backdrop? You know, if it's an actual American flag, then yeah, you know,
[03:13:35.600 --> 03:13:38.960]  that's, that kind of goes against, that's disrespectful in a sense, yeah. But I mean,
[03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:43.920]  if it's like a wallpaper or something and you're using that to have a patriotic background,
[03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:48.560]  I can understand that. But at the same time, it's just like, I can't get mad about the Black Lives
[03:13:48.560 --> 03:13:52.880]  Matter movement going out and burning flags and standing on them and then not getting mad at her
[03:13:52.880 --> 03:13:56.720]  if that's an actual flag. So, if that's an actual flag, then yeah, I think I have a problem with it.
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:13:59.760]  But if it's just used as a backdrop, I think that's a little different. If it's just
[03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:05.760]  some paper, like some random cloth, it's actually not a flag. I think it was a flag. You know,
[03:14:05.760 --> 03:14:09.440]  it's just a short article, but I think it was an actual flag. But okay, so basically, if it's just
[03:14:09.440 --> 03:14:12.960]  some type of paper, it's a backdrop. Yeah, I mean, if it's something you printed out and made
[03:14:12.960 --> 03:14:17.200]  something, it's not an actual flag that you buy, it's got the little, the hooks that go up and all
[03:14:17.200 --> 03:14:22.160]  of that. If it's not an actual flag, then whatever, who cares? I mean, but if it was an actual flag,
[03:14:22.160 --> 03:14:28.160]  I wouldn't like that. I mean, I'm not going to call into the school and ban the photo. But I mean,
[03:14:28.160 --> 03:14:32.480]  but I mean, as someone who fought for this country and someone who really cares deeply
[03:14:32.480 --> 03:14:36.800]  about the country and what it means and what I want it to be, yeah, I mean, I think that's kind
[03:14:36.800 --> 03:14:41.360]  of disrespectful. All right. And the hits keep on coming. That was in Massachusetts. And now we
[03:14:41.360 --> 03:14:46.800]  have a story from New York and a principle is banning Christmas as we've seen many, many times
[03:14:46.800 --> 03:14:51.840]  before. But now they're even banning the Pledge of Allegiance. Joe Bix, they're banning the Pledge
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:14:56.640]  of Allegiance. Yeah, I read when that happened, that was extremely ridiculous. I mean, that's the
[03:14:56.640 --> 03:15:02.320]  country we're living in nowadays, where we can't even have pride in our own nation.
[03:15:03.280 --> 03:15:07.120]  We can't, we're a Christian country, we're a country founded on Christianity.
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:13.680]  And then we can't even say the Pledge of Allegiance in our country. That'd be like me going to Mexico
[03:15:13.680 --> 03:15:16.960]  and tell them they can't say their thing or in a Canada or something like that. They're going to
[03:15:16.960 --> 03:15:22.400]  slap me upside the face and tell me to get the hell out of here and go back to America. So how
[03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:26.960]  dare them? But I just read the update. They actually, it just popped up on Twitter a minute ago before
[03:15:26.960 --> 03:15:32.640]  we came in here. They're actually allowing Christmas trees to come back and the celebration of
[03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:35.840]  Christmas along with the Pledge of Allegiance. They didn't see anything about Thanksgiving though.
[03:15:37.120 --> 03:15:40.640]  It's so funny me. Could we see in all these stories, Biggs? I believe it was in California,
[03:15:40.640 --> 03:15:43.680]  they were telling the kids that couldn't wear American flag tears. They didn't see good a mile,
[03:15:43.680 --> 03:15:47.920]  yeah. All this type of stuff. And just like you said, if you go to some foreign country and tell
[03:15:47.920 --> 03:15:51.440]  them not to wave their flag, I think they'd have a pretty big issue with it. Yeah, I'm pretty sure
[03:15:51.440 --> 03:15:56.080]  if I went to Belgium and I said, hey man, your flag offends me, you need to take that down.
[03:15:56.080 --> 03:16:00.720]  Instead, I need you to raise my flag. I need you guys to be more tolerant of me and stop
[03:16:00.720 --> 03:16:04.400]  speaking your gibberish, start speaking English because I don't understand you. They're going
[03:16:04.400 --> 03:16:07.680]  to backhand me and tell me to get the hell out of there and go back to America. Which is why I
[03:16:07.680 --> 03:16:13.040]  don't understand why people understand that here in our country, where a country founded on Christianity,
[03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:18.480]  you either need to assimilate, you need to be an American. Anybody could just move somewhere
[03:16:18.480 --> 03:16:21.760]  and say there's something. No, it takes more than that. You've got to conform to our ways,
[03:16:21.760 --> 03:16:25.840]  you have to work it, be an American. So you get a job, once you do something, that's what it means.
[03:16:26.400 --> 03:16:30.480]  And I was thinking about this because just like we're talking about the flags and the
[03:16:30.480 --> 03:16:34.160]  Pledge of Allegiance and all this, I was watching some fights. I'm not a big UFC guy,
[03:16:34.160 --> 03:16:39.280]  but I was watching some fights on this past Saturday. And the thing that everybody does,
[03:16:39.280 --> 03:16:42.240]  or a lot of the fighters do once they win the fight, they'll come out with their flag. They
[03:16:42.240 --> 03:16:45.920]  come from Brazil, they come from Mexico, or wherever, and they jump up there with their flag,
[03:16:45.920 --> 03:16:51.520]  and they celebrate. All these people who are offended by flags, I have this idea, go to a UFC
[03:16:51.520 --> 03:16:56.800]  fight. And if you're that offended by somebody's flag, hop the guardrail, jump into the ring and
[03:16:56.800 --> 03:17:01.200]  tell that guy to drop his flag. And then when you regain consciousness, you tell me if that was
[03:17:01.200 --> 03:17:04.720]  worth your time. That's what I think people need to do if they're really offended.
[03:17:04.720 --> 03:17:09.120]  Because it's a thing of pride, though. That's the whole thing about the flag. It represents
[03:17:09.120 --> 03:17:13.920]  more than, it's not just a piece of cloth. It represents the people who died for the values,
[03:17:13.920 --> 03:17:21.440]  it to died for what that country represents. That flag is a representation of what we as Americans
[03:17:21.440 --> 03:17:26.960]  want to portray out and what we believe in. That's right. Even though the country has gone to complete
[03:17:26.960 --> 03:17:34.560]  and total, you know, I still want it to represent more than what it looks like now to the outside
[03:17:34.560 --> 03:17:38.960]  looking in. That's why I see a lot of patrons that are fighting for this country and standing up and
[03:17:38.960 --> 03:17:44.640]  saying, you know what, enough is enough. Fly the American flag. Play Christmas music. Who cares?
[03:17:44.640 --> 03:17:49.600]  Yeah. Now, something that I think is very un-American, we have many people pushing for this no-fly,
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:54.240]  no-gun buy list. I'm sure you've heard about this. And jumping on this, not surprising,
[03:17:54.240 --> 03:18:01.840]  are Chuck E. Schumer and Governor Cuomo. Cuomo, however you pronounce it. And they're jumping
[03:18:01.840 --> 03:18:05.920]  on the bandwagon, saying that if you are in a no-fly list, you can't buy a gun. But we've documented
[03:18:05.920 --> 03:18:09.920]  several, several times of the fallacies of the no-fly list, you know, little eight-year-old
[03:18:09.920 --> 03:18:14.880]  Boy Scouts not being on loud planes. And to be clear, the Boy Scouts aren't on the fly list,
[03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:19.200]  no fly list. It's somebody with a similar name or a birthday or a place of origin.
[03:18:19.200 --> 03:18:22.720]  For example, I was just a GT distributor. This will store up the place where I usually go and look
[03:18:22.720 --> 03:18:26.800]  at guns that you showed me to or get all my cool tactical gear. And there was a police officer
[03:18:26.800 --> 03:18:31.600]  in uniform trying to buy a gun. He was told no because his name when they came back is similar
[03:18:31.600 --> 03:18:35.920]  to another guy with warrants in California. He has the exact same name. So they declined it and
[03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:40.320]  blocked it and said no. And he had to wait and then file something to get that. And this is
[03:18:40.320 --> 03:18:43.760]  the whole thing with the no-fly list. It's completely and totally ridiculous. This came in
[03:18:43.760 --> 03:18:48.480]  the wake of the San Bernardino shootings, the massacre, the terrorist attack. Neither one of
[03:18:48.480 --> 03:18:53.920]  them were on the no-fly list. So where in the hell did this idea come from all of a sudden?
[03:18:53.920 --> 03:19:00.400]  Once again, Obama uses a horrible situation and use it to exploit his own agenda. That's
[03:19:00.400 --> 03:19:04.720]  something he's been looking for to happen. So he can go, okay, now let's go ahead and push this.
[03:19:04.720 --> 03:19:09.040]  Just like with the Umpgall Community College shooting an organ. He took that and used that to
[03:19:09.040 --> 03:19:13.600]  push for gun control. Now he's using this to push for this no-fly thing. And like you said,
[03:19:13.600 --> 03:19:18.480]  anybody can get put on it because of the similarity of a name or the fact that you just get thrown on
[03:19:18.480 --> 03:19:22.480]  by accident or maybe a silent accident. Maybe there's this whole secret list and they just don't
[03:19:22.480 --> 03:19:27.440]  like certain people based off of your Facebook posts. And the thing about it is they've recently
[03:19:27.440 --> 03:19:31.840]  changed it to where now you can fight it. I'm not sure how successful those fights have been.
[03:19:31.840 --> 03:19:35.360]  Probably not too. But you know, it used to be like you got put on it and you had no idea how
[03:19:35.360 --> 03:19:40.560]  you got on it, what was going to happen next. So we'll have more on this. Is that Alex Jones
[03:19:40.560 --> 03:19:46.560]  sneaking into the studio? Loud coverage tonight, 7 o'clock central. Tell your friends and family,

[03:24:43.440 --> 03:24:48.240]  Now I'm going to take a call now. We see a gentleman, Joe Biggs, point this out to me. Marcus
[03:24:48.240 --> 03:24:52.480]  has been holding for well over an hour so we don't want to keep you waiting any longer. Marcus,
[03:24:52.480 --> 03:24:58.480]  go ahead with your thought or question. Yeah, my question is concerning basically
[03:24:58.480 --> 03:25:04.720]  the election tonight or the GOP election tonight. And so what I've seen on TV, they're basically
[03:25:04.720 --> 03:25:14.960]  ridiculing crews about him and his carpet bombing statement about destroying ISIS. And my question
[03:25:14.960 --> 03:25:21.120]  to you guys is what do you think or what do you believe has the best plan in defeating ISIS with
[03:25:22.080 --> 03:25:27.200]  as far as the whole GOP can see go? I'm going to say Lindsey Graham because he just wants to blow
[03:25:27.200 --> 03:25:31.440]  up the whole universe. Oh yeah, I mean, I mean, that's someone who wants to just bomb everything.
[03:25:31.440 --> 03:25:35.360]  But I mean, militarily speaking, I mean, he could carpet bomb stuff. And I mean,
[03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:41.120]  I was reading some articles my special operations buddies put out. It takes more than just bombing
[03:25:41.120 --> 03:25:45.680]  a whole bunch of buildings. Yes. Especially when our government, I was reading articles earlier
[03:25:45.680 --> 03:25:49.840]  today, they know where these propaganda sites are, where these guys are running social media over
[03:25:49.840 --> 03:25:54.480]  there. They won't bomb them. So if they bomb something, what are they going to be bombing?
[03:25:55.200 --> 03:26:00.480]  And on top of that, when you bomb, say if they went in there and just bomb the entire area,
[03:26:00.480 --> 03:26:03.520]  all the people who survived, you've created a whole another generation of people.
[03:26:03.520 --> 03:26:06.480]  Of enemies, yeah. Of enemies who are going to want to go in. You've got to go in there and you've
[03:26:06.480 --> 03:26:10.320]  got to attack the money. You've got to take that money away. You've got to stop that from happening
[03:26:10.320 --> 03:26:14.400]  so they can't grow any further. Then you've got to go in. This all has to be done strategically.
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:19.440]  You can't just do it with bombs and bullets. I mean, that works essentially in some ways.
[03:26:19.440 --> 03:26:24.000]  But this is an idea. It's just like they could come in and bomb America. But guess what? America
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:28.160]  will prevail because America is an idea, a way that we believe and we're going to go. And it's
[03:26:28.160 --> 03:26:32.240]  the same thing with these guys. They're willing to die and fight for this idea. So you can bomb
[03:26:32.240 --> 03:26:35.760]  them to hell and back. But at the end of the day, you're just going to create more people
[03:26:35.760 --> 03:26:38.960]  who want to stand up and they're going to be angrier and they're going to hate us for the rest
[03:26:38.960 --> 03:26:43.920]  of their lives. Well, thank you so much, Marcus. Let's move on now to Mark in California. Now,
[03:26:43.920 --> 03:26:47.680]  Wayne Madsen has left us, but you're welcome to go ahead and make your statement, Mark.
[03:26:49.600 --> 03:26:55.440]  Yes, sir. I would like to ask if Wayne Madsen knew Michael Aquino because he was the former head
[03:26:55.440 --> 03:27:03.760]  of the NSA. And I was hoping maybe you could ask him and talk about this guy because he's a
[03:27:03.760 --> 03:27:09.200]  devil worshiper there in San Francisco. Very, very despicable man. As a matter of fact, if I had to
[03:27:09.200 --> 03:27:15.680]  put my finger on the most wicked man that's living, it'd be either him or David Rockefeller.
[03:27:15.680 --> 03:27:22.560]  And there's wondering if Wayne Madsen actually, I know he knows about him because he was the
[03:27:22.560 --> 03:27:29.040]  top dog. And if he knew anything about him, because he was friends with Anton LaVe.
[03:27:30.160 --> 03:27:38.240]  And Anton LaVe started the church of Satan in San Francisco. And when Oprah interviewed Michael
[03:27:38.240 --> 03:27:44.400]  Aquino, the former head of the NSA, there were like 800 people that called the FBI and said that
[03:27:44.400 --> 03:27:52.960]  they didn't ask him as a child. Hi, Michael Aquino. And it was a, you can Google it, you know. Yeah,
[03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:56.800]  I believe you on that one. As far as Wayne, like I said, he has left us, but
[03:27:56.800 --> 03:28:00.160]  you don't have that information on. Yeah, well, yeah, we definitely pass that on. And hopefully,
[03:28:00.160 --> 03:28:05.600]  maybe next time he's done, we can ask him that question. Let's go on to, is that Harvey in Florida?
[03:28:05.600 --> 03:28:14.640]  Yes, this is Harvey in Florida. Hello, Kikari and Joe Biggs. How's it going?
[03:28:14.640 --> 03:28:20.800]  Yeah, I wanted to talk to Wayne Madsen, but they were talking, him and Alex were talking about
[03:28:21.440 --> 03:28:26.000]  how the military generals are like cowards and they don't get involved with saying anything
[03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:32.480]  to stop them anything. And I want to bring up Bradley Manning, who was like the braver soldier
[03:28:32.480 --> 03:28:39.680]  in my memory for getting that classified information, the emails and the information on the state
[03:28:39.680 --> 03:28:44.960]  department and passing it on to Julian Assange. Now, what they did to that poor guy, they tortured
[03:28:44.960 --> 03:28:53.360]  him for two years. Then they tried him in a kangaroo court in Virginia. I think it was in
[03:28:53.360 --> 03:29:03.600]  Virginia there at Fort, whatever that name is, what he's going to say is located over there. This
[03:29:03.600 --> 03:29:09.920]  guy, like he went into the gulag, he disappeared. They said he was gay and they gave him a girl's
[03:29:09.920 --> 03:29:16.320]  name and all this crap. What do you two gentlemen think about that? Joe, you were in the military.
[03:29:16.320 --> 03:29:20.320]  I'd like to get your take on it because to me, he's the braver soldier we had.
[03:29:20.320 --> 03:29:27.520]  I don't share the same sentiments in a sense. I mean, when you go about something like that,
[03:29:28.400 --> 03:29:32.000]  you can put people's lives at danger when you're releasing things like that.
[03:29:32.000 --> 03:29:37.280]  But that's just from a soldier's standpoint. I mean, not being in that situation. And when
[03:29:37.280 --> 03:29:40.880]  someone leaks something, you don't have to worry about dying. And then I do out there on the ground.
[03:29:40.880 --> 03:29:44.240]  It's a little different. All right. Well, thank you so much. We'll come back right after this
[03:29:44.240 --> 03:29:52.000]  break with more calls on the Alex Jones show. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.880 --> 03:29:55.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:29:59.680 --> 03:30:05.360]  A New York City principal has banned Christmas in the Pledge of Allegiance, reports EAG News.
[03:30:05.360 --> 03:30:10.160]  The new principal has also eliminated Thanksgiving. Despite clear notice from the city's Department
[03:30:10.160 --> 03:30:14.800]  of Education, allowing for holiday themes and symbols, the New York Post writes,
[03:30:14.800 --> 03:30:19.680]  we definitely can't say Christmas. Nothing with Christmas on it. Nothing with Santa.
[03:30:19.680 --> 03:30:25.520]  A local PTA president told the news site, no angels. We can't even have a star because it can
[03:30:25.520 --> 03:30:31.920]  represent a religious system like the star of David. The report states that about 95% of the
[03:30:31.920 --> 03:30:38.480]  students at Brooklyn's PS 169 are either Hispanic or Asian. And the assistant principal announced
[03:30:38.480 --> 03:30:43.840]  last month that the school is changing its holiday traditions to be sensitive to the diversity of
[03:30:43.840 --> 03:30:50.000]  our families. Not all children celebrate the same holidays, he added. And the Pledge of Allegiance
[03:30:50.000 --> 03:31:09.680]  was also ditched when the principal took office. You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[03:32:06.320 --> 03:32:12.240]  to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[03:32:12.240 --> 03:32:17.440]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control. Television, music, fast food, GMOs,
[03:32:17.440 --> 03:32:22.080]  sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being
[03:32:22.080 --> 03:32:27.520]  hammered daily by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down,
[03:32:27.520 --> 03:32:31.760]  and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs. Working with my team, we set out to
[03:32:31.760 --> 03:32:35.760]  find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like
[03:32:35.760 --> 03:32:40.160]  and take. We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for
[03:32:40.160 --> 03:32:44.800]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there. Introducing
[03:32:44.800 --> 03:32:50.640]  Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients

[03:32:56.320 --> 03:33:14.240]  exclusively at infowarslife.com. President Obama's record-breaking national debt.
[03:33:14.800 --> 03:33:20.480]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt.
[03:33:20.480 --> 03:33:23.600]  Increasing Obamacare tax penalties and premiums,
[03:33:23.600 --> 03:33:28.880]  blue-collar depleting trade deals, and overall salinsky-esque tactics,
[03:33:28.880 --> 03:33:34.560]  are demolishing the American middle class as we near the finish line of Obama's two terms.
[03:33:34.560 --> 03:33:39.600]  The only change we've experienced is the totalitarian transformation of the presidential
[03:33:39.600 --> 03:33:45.920]  office begun by his criminal counterparts that have continuously seized the throne since JFK
[03:33:45.920 --> 03:33:54.560]  was gunned down in Dallas. Breitbart reports Pew Research found that the share of American
[03:33:54.560 --> 03:34:03.520]  adults living in middle income households has fallen from 61% in 1971 to 50% in 2015.
[03:34:03.520 --> 03:34:10.640]  The share living in the upper income tier rose from 14% to 21% over the same period. Meanwhile,
[03:34:10.640 --> 03:34:18.560]  the share in the lower income tier increased from 25% to 29%. Manufacturing accounted for 26%
[03:34:18.560 --> 03:34:26.480]  of employed adults in 1971 compared with 11% in 2014. A Gallup poll discovered that since the
[03:34:26.480 --> 03:34:32.880]  year 2000 through 2008, 10% of middle class to upper middle class of Americans transferred
[03:34:32.880 --> 03:34:42.400]  into the lower class. 62% of Americans have under $1,000 in savings. Meanwhile, Obamacare
[03:34:42.400 --> 03:34:50.640]  will raise the penalty next year by 50% for not participating to $1,000 just to make sure that
[03:34:50.640 --> 03:34:56.560]  anybody struggling can't get ahead. So their goal has always been to eliminate the middle class,
[03:34:57.280 --> 03:35:01.920]  raise taxes, give away their health care to poor and illegals, flood the country with immigrants,
[03:35:01.920 --> 03:35:08.400]  degrade our position abroad, do everything they can to eliminate the foundation of what
[03:35:08.400 --> 03:35:14.720]  supports the free market system and that is the only threat to their having a permanent hold on
[03:35:14.720 --> 03:35:20.320]  power. The goal is to keep a permanent hold on power. When I grew up, I guess was the years
[03:35:20.320 --> 03:35:27.520]  before you grew up, but we had a country of middle class families who had intact nuclear
[03:35:27.520 --> 03:35:32.720]  families. That is the mother and father were married to each other and raising their own
[03:35:32.720 --> 03:35:39.360]  children in one household. And now that's just the minority of people in our country.
[03:35:40.080 --> 03:35:46.240]  But the nuclear family was a self-contained economic unit. They spent their own money,
[03:35:46.240 --> 03:35:49.280]  made their own decisions, decided how they were going to raise their children.
[03:35:49.840 --> 03:35:55.280]  The now pseudo-privileged financially doomed millennial generation has proclaimed the death
[03:35:55.280 --> 03:36:00.640]  of the American dream according to a Harvard poll, blindly throwing their collective votes
[03:36:00.640 --> 03:36:07.040]  towards the socialist promises of Bernie Sanders out of total desperation. The millennial generation
[03:36:07.040 --> 03:36:13.760]  workforce still makes up 40% of the unemployed. This generation will overtake the baby boomer
[03:36:13.760 --> 03:36:20.560]  generation as the nation's largest living population approaching 75 million strong.
[03:36:20.560 --> 03:36:26.800]  A generation that will inherit the mind-controlling PC culture, dwindling middle class numbers,
[03:36:26.800 --> 03:36:32.400]  Obamacare penalties and rate hikes, and crippling student debt. If you thought the middle class
[03:36:32.400 --> 03:36:37.680]  was in trouble now, you ain't seen nothing yet. John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[03:36:39.680 --> 03:36:44.560]  Another fantastic report there from John Bowne. And that's the thing as we're watching this video
[03:36:44.560 --> 03:36:48.400]  with all the college students. If you're listening on the radio, he had several college students
[03:36:48.400 --> 03:36:53.840]  featured in that video. You have all these people who are coming out of school with massive amounts
[03:36:53.840 --> 03:36:59.200]  of debt and not a whole lot of prospects for jobs in the future. A lot of these guys,
[03:36:59.200 --> 03:37:04.320]  and including that happened to myself for a standard period of time, you get out of school
[03:37:04.320 --> 03:37:08.400]  and then you just go work some job. You go work at IHOP. You go work at Denny's. You go work at
[03:37:08.400 --> 03:37:12.000]  Walmart or someplace like that, just trying to make your ends meet. And then eventually maybe
[03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:16.560]  there's some type of pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but you still have the debt attached to
[03:37:16.560 --> 03:37:21.040]  it. Now what we're going to do for the remainder of our program is to intersperse your calls
[03:37:21.040 --> 03:37:24.720]  with the videos. We just played a video. We're going to open up the phone lines. The number to
[03:37:24.720 --> 03:37:34.000]  call in is 800-259-9231. Once again, that is 800-259-9231. You can speak on any topic by
[03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:38.800]  do remind our viewers that Wayne Matson has left us. So if you have questions for him,
[03:37:38.800 --> 03:37:43.520]  you just have to call back on another day. But let's go ahead and go to James in Washington.
[03:37:43.520 --> 03:37:52.960]  Go ahead, James. Hey guys, how you doing? Doing good yourself? Pretty good, man. Hey Joe Biggs,
[03:37:52.960 --> 03:37:57.200]  once I got blessed, man, you remind me of my best friend, Mike. You're like a brother.
[03:37:57.200 --> 03:38:00.640]  You're like a brother. I'd like to hang out with up there if you ever come up in Seattle.
[03:38:01.440 --> 03:38:05.360]  Well, Joe Biggs left us too. I guess I should have mentioned that as well. But I'm sure he can
[03:38:05.360 --> 03:38:10.400]  hear you and he appreciates your call. Thank you so much, James. All right, so we took one call
[03:38:10.400 --> 03:38:16.000]  there. Let's go ahead and go to another video. This is Trey Gowdy. And Trey Gowdy is grilling DHS
[03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:21.440]  officials on due process oversight and reform committee. Because yeah, we have all these DHS
[03:38:21.440 --> 03:38:26.080]  guys that we're talking about guys on no fly list, no gun by list. We've also seen, I believe it was
[03:38:26.080 --> 03:38:32.160]  72 people from DHS on the no fly list. I wonder how seriously that's going to be enforced. So if
[03:38:32.160 --> 03:38:37.520]  the guys are ready, we can go ahead and run that clip. Let me ask you another question about the
[03:38:37.520 --> 03:38:44.000]  terrorism list. What process is afforded a US citizen, not someone who's overstated visa,
[03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  not someone who crossed the border without permission, but an American citizen,
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:52.880]  what process is currently afforded an American citizen before they go on that list?
[03:38:58.080 --> 03:39:04.560]  I'm sorry. There's not a process afforded the citizen prior to getting on the list. There is
[03:39:04.560 --> 03:39:10.640]  a process. Should someone feel they aren't duly placed on? Yes, there is. And when I say process,
[03:39:10.640 --> 03:39:17.920]  I'm actually using half of the term due process, which is a phrase we find in the Constitution,
[03:39:17.920 --> 03:39:24.560]  that you cannot deprive people of certain things without due process. So I understand Mr. Goode's
[03:39:24.560 --> 03:39:30.000]  idea, which is wait until your right has been taken from you and then you can petition the
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:35.280]  government to get it back. I understand that that's his idea. My question is, can you name
[03:39:35.280 --> 03:39:41.120]  another constitutional right that we have that is chilled until you find out it's chilled,
[03:39:41.120 --> 03:39:46.240]  and then you have to petition the government to get it back? Is that true with the First Amendment?
[03:39:48.320 --> 03:39:53.600]  So there are strict criteria before. That's not my question, ma'am. That is not my question. My
[03:39:53.600 --> 03:40:00.720]  question is what process is afforded a United States citizen before that person's constitutional
[03:40:00.720 --> 03:40:07.040]  right is infringed? Then he's fine when doing it with the Second Amendment. My question is,
[03:40:07.040 --> 03:40:15.760]  how about the first? How about we not let them set up a website or a Google account? How about
[03:40:15.760 --> 03:40:20.960]  we not let them join the church until they can petition government to get off the list?
[03:40:20.960 --> 03:40:26.960]  How about not get a lawyer? How about the Sixth Amendment? How about you can't get a lawyer
[03:40:28.480 --> 03:40:34.160]  until you petition the government to get off the list? Or my favorite, how about the Eighth Amendment?
[03:40:34.960 --> 03:40:39.920]  We're going to subject you to cruel and unusual punishment until you petition the government
[03:40:39.920 --> 03:40:46.480]  to get off the list. Is there another constitutional right that we treat the same way for American
[03:40:46.480 --> 03:40:54.480]  citizens that we do the Second Amendment? Can you think of one? And she sits there.
[03:40:54.480 --> 03:40:57.440]  Can you think of one? I don't have an answer for you, sir.
[03:40:59.040 --> 03:41:05.520]  That was awesome. I really enjoyed that great job. You, Trey Gowdy, grilling these guys because,
[03:41:05.520 --> 03:41:09.920]  yeah, that's what it is. What I was talking about with Biggs early on, this no-fly,
[03:41:09.920 --> 03:41:13.760]  no-gun buy list and all these other watch lists they have people on. At the time,
[03:41:13.760 --> 03:41:17.280]  you don't even know that you're on it until you get stuck at the airport or some other thing.
[03:41:17.280 --> 03:41:20.800]  Then you have to petition. And as you can see right there, what's the petition process? What are
[03:41:20.800 --> 03:41:25.200]  you supposed to do? A lot of times they don't have an answer. Once again, the number to call in
[03:41:25.200 --> 03:41:34.160]  800-259-9231. That is 800-259-9231. Let's go ahead and talk to Luke and Washington. Go ahead, Luke.
[03:41:36.320 --> 03:41:39.440]  Hi. Thank you for having me on here. Thank you.
[03:41:39.440 --> 03:41:46.320]  So I'm on YouTube right now and I see the Alex Jones channel and I see that Melissa Harris
[03:41:46.320 --> 03:41:51.280]  Perry called Star Wars film racist. And I think that just shows kind of where our country is
[03:41:51.280 --> 03:41:59.120]  really going. Every film in the future is probably just going to, if it displays a black man or a
[03:41:59.120 --> 03:42:03.760]  black woman getting killed, it's going to be claimed as racist. That's when Melissa Harris Perry is
[03:42:03.760 --> 03:42:10.560]  going to just try and claim every future film that shows any black man, any black woman getting
[03:42:10.560 --> 03:42:19.600]  killed is a racist film. And that's just a joke. Well, I hear what you're saying because I believe
[03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:22.720]  what she was referring to, like it was a long clip. We played it yesterday. I'm not going to play it
[03:42:22.720 --> 03:42:27.040]  again. But she was talking about, you know, how Darth Vader was evil until he became white. He
[03:42:27.040 --> 03:42:30.880]  took off the Darth Vader suit and became white, even though if you go watch episode three, you
[03:42:30.880 --> 03:42:34.320]  know, Anakin's evil and killing a bunch of kids in the library, but I guess that doesn't mean
[03:42:34.320 --> 03:42:39.520]  anything. And I also saw an interview with James Earl Jones done several years ago. He was talking
[03:42:39.520 --> 03:42:45.360]  about when he got cast for the film because you can go watch DVD bonus features of the actor in
[03:42:45.360 --> 03:42:49.040]  the suit saying the lines. He doesn't sound intimidating at all. I'm sure he's a fantastic
[03:42:49.040 --> 03:42:54.240]  actor, but he doesn't have that James Earl Jones type of voice. So James Earl Jones was saying
[03:42:54.240 --> 03:42:59.440]  that, yeah, George Lucas wanted a voice that was darker, not racially darker, but just darker,
[03:42:59.440 --> 03:43:03.520]  more intense, more intimidating than what we saw there. But yeah, I hear what you're saying there,
[03:43:03.520 --> 03:43:07.760]  Luke. I think there is going to be a lot of people who just is like anything, you know, if a black
[03:43:07.760 --> 03:43:11.360]  person is a villain in a movie, they'll say it's racist or whatever. So I definitely understand
[03:43:11.360 --> 03:43:15.040]  what you're saying right there. Let's go ahead and go back to another clip now.
[03:43:15.040 --> 03:43:21.120]  We have Obama's undersecretary of the army nominee, secretary of the army. And he's talking about
[03:43:21.120 --> 03:43:26.560]  ISIS is not contained because we've seen Obama previously state that ISIS was the JV team,
[03:43:26.560 --> 03:43:30.800]  that they're not a threat. He's releasing guys from Guantanamo Bay, saying that they're no
[03:43:30.800 --> 03:43:34.800]  longer threat low level threats. Is this going to be another thing that blows up in this face?
[03:43:34.800 --> 03:43:39.280]  I don't know, but let's go take a look at this clip by all people, not Lindsey Graham, who's a
[03:43:39.280 --> 03:43:43.360]  John McCain coming out to this guy. And I got my own views about John McCain. You know, he's out
[03:43:43.360 --> 03:43:48.400]  there hanging out with the Al Qaeda rebels saying that I know these guys. I know them so well,
[03:43:48.400 --> 03:43:52.800]  you know, I've gone over there and met with them and somebody out here is Alex Jones.
[03:43:52.800 --> 03:43:58.320]  Ah, sorry. It's live teleprompter media. Jukari is kicking butt. I cannot wait till tonight
[03:43:58.320 --> 03:44:01.760]  when you guys are hosting the news. I'll be part of it with you. You got huge debate coverage
[03:44:01.760 --> 03:44:05.440]  coming up about to do a Facebook mentions coming up about 10, 15 minutes, Jukari.
[03:44:05.440 --> 03:44:08.080]  All right. You've done a wonderful job this year. Some of the viewers and listeners
[03:44:08.080 --> 03:44:11.600]  about to go sign your Christmas bonus check, Jukari. That is awesome. Yeah, there you go.
[03:44:12.640 --> 03:44:17.920]  All right, let's let's go ahead and go to this clip. And this is Mr. Murphy, the undersecretary.
[03:44:17.920 --> 03:44:25.840]  Well, thank you all. Carson Murphy, is ISIS contained?
[03:44:28.240 --> 03:44:32.880]  Well, Senator, I'm not currently, as you know, in government, but let me tell you
[03:44:33.680 --> 03:44:38.480]  what I know from my personal perspective, Mr. Chairman. When you look at things like the
[03:44:38.480 --> 03:44:45.120]  Russian airliner. Start out by saying yes or no. I would say no, because Mr. Chairman,
[03:44:45.120 --> 03:44:48.720]  when you look at things like the Russian airliner, when you look at things like the
[03:44:48.720 --> 03:44:52.080]  Paris attack, which killed civilians, when you look at things like the ice,
[03:44:52.080 --> 03:44:56.800]  ISIL-inspired attack in California, when you look at ice operations currently in Ramadi
[03:44:57.520 --> 03:45:05.040]  and Mosul, I'm concerned as we all are concerned. And we must, and I think Secretary Carter
[03:45:05.040 --> 03:45:09.520]  and General Milley have said that we must accelerate our prosecution in the war against
[03:45:09.520 --> 03:45:15.360]  ISIL immediately. And if confirmed, Mr. Chairman, I will do just that to make sure we take the fight
[03:45:15.360 --> 03:45:20.720]  to them. And yes, I do agree that ISIS is a threat and they need to be dealt with. The
[03:45:20.720 --> 03:45:26.400]  issue that very few people are talking about outside of Rand Paul is that we keep funding ISIS.
[03:45:26.400 --> 03:45:30.480]  We keep funding Al Qaeda. Everybody wants to go blow them up, but nobody wants to cut off the
[03:45:30.480 --> 03:45:35.520]  funding and make them an easier target to attack. Let's go ahead and talk to Larry in Michigan. Go
[03:45:35.520 --> 03:45:47.040]  ahead, Larry. Larry? Okay, I guess we lost Larry there. Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[03:45:47.040 --> 03:45:54.640]  Go ahead, Tim. Hey, Jerry, how you doing? Doing good, sir, yourself? Good. Hey, isn't it funny how
[03:45:54.640 --> 03:46:02.400]  when Trump made that statement about the illegals or the bringing in the jihadis that all those
[03:46:02.400 --> 03:46:05.760]  people in there and they're established to come out against them? Well, doesn't that just go to
[03:46:05.760 --> 03:46:12.880]  show how much they don't represent us when his polls go up? Well, the issue is, you know,
[03:46:12.880 --> 03:46:18.640]  like I said, I'm not a fan of everything Trump says and does. But, you know, going back to the
[03:46:18.640 --> 03:46:22.640]  old Rand Paul example, you know, everybody wants to come out and say, let's bomb ISIS, but nobody
[03:46:22.640 --> 03:46:27.040]  wants to talk about the root of the problem, saying that we're funding ISIS. Like I haven't heard
[03:46:27.040 --> 03:46:31.600]  people haven't heard Trump really talk about that either. So I'm not so much on the Trump campaign.
[03:46:31.600 --> 03:46:35.120]  I do hear what you're saying that anytime he says something, they do seem to attack him more than
[03:46:35.120 --> 03:46:40.560]  they would a Hillary Clinton or a, you know, Bernie Sanders, a character like that. So I hear
[03:46:40.560 --> 03:46:47.280]  some of what you're saying, but I'm not completely on the Trump bandwagon. And, you know, after
[03:46:47.280 --> 03:46:52.400]  right after that happened, Obama, come on, said, you know, we gotta, you know, somebody on off,
[03:46:52.400 --> 03:46:56.320]  no fireless should not be able to buy a gun when this guy wasn't even on. These guys weren't even
[03:46:56.320 --> 03:47:02.800]  on an off fire. That is correct. Yeah. And it shows you they just keep grasping at straws. And,
[03:47:02.800 --> 03:47:06.800]  you know, even with the Boston bombing, you had a, you know, pressure cooker filled with all types,
[03:47:06.800 --> 03:47:10.240]  you know, nails, whatever else was in there. And then they'd use that to try to ban guns.
[03:47:10.240 --> 03:47:15.040]  You know, it's just a complete lunacy. They'll use any example they can to come after guns,
[03:47:15.040 --> 03:47:19.600]  even though as we all know, they themselves are surrounded by bodyguards and have all that stuff
[03:47:19.600 --> 03:47:25.120]  going on them. Well, thank you so much for calling in. Let's go back to another clip. We have Obama
[03:47:25.120 --> 03:47:30.640]  defending his Guantanamo policy, calling for the release of low level detainees and downplaying
[03:47:30.640 --> 03:47:36.160]  the threat. As we already referenced earlier in the show, Obama used to say that ISIS was the JV
[03:47:36.160 --> 03:47:41.600]  team and not to be, you know, any concern to anybody. We're just going to air drop in grenades and
[03:47:41.600 --> 03:47:45.600]  then have our, you know, colonels and generals or whoever, the guy made the statement that
[03:47:45.600 --> 03:47:50.240]  one crate or one pallet of grenades isn't going to defeat the U S military. Yes, I do agree it's
[03:47:50.240 --> 03:47:54.400]  not going to defeat the United States military. Let's kill a whole bunch of unarmed civilians
[03:47:54.400 --> 03:47:57.520]  out there in Syria. Let's go ahead and look at this clip from Obama.
[03:47:58.720 --> 03:48:06.160]  Well, first of all, just in terms of Guantanamo policy generally, I am absolutely persuaded as
[03:48:06.160 --> 03:48:14.640]  are my top intelligence and military advisors that Guantanamo is used as a recruitment tool for
[03:48:14.640 --> 03:48:19.840]  organizations like ISIS. And if we want to fight them, then we can't give them these kinds of excuses.
[03:48:19.840 --> 03:48:28.560]  In terms of any kind of return to the fight by people who are released by ISIL, keep in mind that
[03:48:29.840 --> 03:48:35.280]  between myself and the Bush administration, hundreds of people have been released and
[03:48:35.920 --> 03:48:40.960]  the recidivism rate, we anticipate. We assume that they're going to be out of
[03:48:42.240 --> 03:48:47.200]  four or five, 600 people that get released, that a handful of them are going to be
[03:48:47.200 --> 03:48:55.840]  embittered and still engaging in anti-U.S. activities and trying to link up potentially
[03:48:55.840 --> 03:49:03.040]  with their old organizations. The judgment that we're continually making is, are there individuals
[03:49:03.040 --> 03:49:09.520]  who are significantly more dangerous than the people who are already out there who are fighting?
[03:49:09.520 --> 03:49:15.680]  What do they add? Do they have special skills? Do they have special knowledge that ends up
[03:49:15.680 --> 03:49:24.000]  making them a significant threat to the United States? And so the bottom line is,
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:30.480]  is that the strategic gains we make by closing Guantanamo will outweigh
[03:49:32.240 --> 03:49:37.760]  those low-level individuals who have been released so far.
[03:49:38.960 --> 03:49:42.960]  All right, so there you go, President Obama with his latest statement or one of his
[03:49:42.960 --> 03:49:47.040]  later statements. Let's go and talk to Nick in Michigan. Go ahead, Nick.
[03:49:49.280 --> 03:49:53.200]  I do, I'm a big fan, big fan of Joe's too. Oh, thank you.
[03:49:54.960 --> 03:49:59.520]  I just got something to say to veterans and people in the military that have gotten out,
[03:49:59.520 --> 03:50:04.480]  it's still your duty to support and defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States,
[03:50:05.200 --> 03:50:11.440]  specifically the Second Amendment. Everybody that is trained and can legally own firearms should
[03:50:11.440 --> 03:50:16.400]  and I have a question for Joe. Is he still right there? Oh, no, he stepped out.
[03:50:17.760 --> 03:50:21.440]  Oh, okay. All right. Well, that's it. Then I was going to ask him of my,
[03:50:21.440 --> 03:50:26.240]  I have a little brother who's looking to join the Marine Corps. I was wondering if Joe has any
[03:50:27.040 --> 03:50:32.800]  advice to give to him. Okay. Well, I'm sure you can find him on Twitter. He's a very social butterfly,
[03:50:32.800 --> 03:50:36.720]  Rambo Biggs on Twitter and you can ask him your questions there. Thank you so much,
[03:50:36.720 --> 03:50:40.320]  Nick. We're going to break now. We'll be back. Don't forget the debates coming up tonight,
[03:50:40.320 --> 03:50:42.320]  live coverage starting at 7 p.m. Central.
[03:51:00.560 --> 03:51:07.280]  My name is Don Wiscan. In 1994, I lost my 60 year old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:07.280 --> 03:51:13.040]  In 1977, my 44 year old brother was found dead in his apartment. He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:13.040 --> 03:51:18.000]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed. 21 days later,
[03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:23.040]  my 53 year old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital. He waited too long.
[03:51:23.040 --> 03:51:28.960]  In June that same year, I almost joined them at 42. What did I do? I took a seven herb formula I
[03:51:28.960 --> 03:51:34.000]  now call extendivite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle,
[03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:39.120]  and valerian. Based on German studies of natural medicine, extendivite is designed to clear block
[03:51:39.120 --> 03:51:44.480]  arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system. To get your extendivite,
[03:51:44.480 --> 03:52:01.920]  call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website, heartdrop.com. We have been fighting this war tirelessly,
[03:52:01.920 --> 03:52:06.720]  with you at our side, day in and day out, exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal
[03:52:06.720 --> 03:52:12.240]  operations of the globalists, and we're starting to see big effects. And the word is getting out.
[03:52:12.240 --> 03:52:17.280]  The globalists want to make us dependent, and as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on
[03:52:17.280 --> 03:52:22.480]  its stomach. Ammunition, food, and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the
[03:52:22.480 --> 03:52:28.640]  Info War, and our enemies admit they're losing the Info War. We are in an information war,
[03:52:28.640 --> 03:52:34.080]  and we are losing that war. With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the
[03:52:34.080 --> 03:52:39.120]  decision to refuse any money from globalists or government. We are funding our crusade against
[03:52:39.120 --> 03:52:45.440]  tyranny the old fashioned way, with pure free market, free will capitalism. Visit infowarstore.com

[03:54:11.840 --> 03:54:16.800]  Jakari Jackson. This is the final segment of the Overdrive Hour. And before we get to our
[03:54:16.800 --> 03:54:21.040]  topics here, I want to remind you about the great specials in the InfoWars shop. Right now,

[03:54:41.280 --> 03:54:46.640]  about things like water filtration systems? Because besides the Harvard studies saying that
[03:54:46.640 --> 03:54:50.480]  they lower your IQ when you have things like fluoride in the water, and then you go to the
[03:54:50.480 --> 03:54:54.480]  city council meeting and the mayor gives you the finger. We now have this new article coming
[03:54:54.480 --> 03:55:00.000]  out of Flint, Michigan, where they have so much lead in the water that it's giving kids sicknesses
[03:55:00.000 --> 03:55:04.960]  and they've declared a state of emergency. And this says, according to the World Health Organization,
[03:55:04.960 --> 03:55:10.000]  that affects children's brain development, resulting in reduced IQs, behavioral changes,
[03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:16.000]  and shortening of attention spans, and increased antisocial behavior. The article goes on to say
[03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:21.040]  the proportions, the proportion of infants and children with above average levels of lead in
[03:55:21.040 --> 03:55:25.840]  their blood has nearly doubled since the city switched from the Detroit water system to using
[03:55:25.840 --> 03:55:33.040]  the Flint River as their water source in 2014. So this is why it's important to have clean,
[03:55:33.040 --> 03:55:37.040]  pure water. You don't want to get things like dental fluorosis. You don't want your kids to
[03:55:37.040 --> 03:55:41.680]  have lead poisoning. Because you think about the old saying, it must be something in the water.
[03:55:41.680 --> 03:55:47.280]  You would usually reserve that when you see some big, strong, muscly football guys running around,
[03:55:47.280 --> 03:55:51.760]  running guys over. That must be something in the water. Now when you see some sick kid who's
[03:55:51.760 --> 03:55:54.480]  rolling around in a wheelchair, I'm not trying to be funny, I'm being dead serious,
[03:55:54.480 --> 03:55:58.560]  when you have some very elderly person who's suffering from these ill effects,
[03:55:58.560 --> 03:56:02.240]  then you say, oh, there's something in the water. And there is. You definitely need to have a clean
[03:56:02.240 --> 03:56:07.040]  water source to drink from. So let's go ahead and finish up with our call. So here we'll go to
[03:56:07.040 --> 03:56:17.200]  Shelly, and that is in New Hampshire. Go ahead. Hi. Thank you. I just recently finished watching
[03:56:17.200 --> 03:56:23.760]  the Kate Griggs videos on YouTube, the title of the video, the Ex-Villuminati White Hellball,
[03:56:23.760 --> 03:56:28.800]  or something like that. And I was just wondering if you had seen those videos, and
[03:56:28.800 --> 03:56:36.880]  I have not. Go ahead. She was married to a colonel in the Marine Corps, George Griggs,
[03:56:36.880 --> 03:56:43.680]  and she just, I mean, what she exposes is so incredible, and I was just wondering if maybe Joe
[03:56:43.680 --> 03:56:51.280]  had heard about her. I mean, she just talks about crazy rituals and killings and satanic
[03:56:51.280 --> 03:56:56.960]  stuff, and I just didn't know if you had seen the four videos on YouTube. No, I have not seen
[03:56:56.960 --> 03:57:01.760]  those, but, you know, I can believe stories like that do happen. We've seen guys like Jimmy Savelle
[03:57:01.760 --> 03:57:05.440]  and, you know, all the weird stuff that goes on at Bohemian Grove. There are definitely people
[03:57:05.440 --> 03:57:10.560]  who are into that kind of, you know, weird stuff. I'm not exactly sure how far those tapes go that
[03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:14.240]  you're referring to, but I can't believe that people do stuff like that. Thank you so much,
[03:57:14.240 --> 03:57:22.960]  Shelly. Let's go on to Thomas in Texas. Go ahead. Hello? Yes. Hey, sir. So I was, I
[03:57:23.520 --> 03:57:27.680]  called her, brought up earlier about South Park, this current season of South Park, how they're
[03:57:27.680 --> 03:57:33.520]  using PC, and they're really describing how PC is being used as a weapon. Have you,
[03:57:33.520 --> 03:57:37.040]  you watched South Park at all? Have you seen the season? I don't watch South Park regularly.
[03:57:37.040 --> 03:57:41.840]  Every now and then we'll post one of the clips on the site. Like I saw the Safe Space one, they had
[03:57:41.840 --> 03:57:46.960]  like Steven Seagal and Vindy's on some, and, you know, I get the point that they're trying to make.
[03:57:46.960 --> 03:57:53.600]  Yeah. So I'm aware of them. Yeah. There was a point where they actually completely broke it down
[03:57:53.600 --> 03:58:00.320]  where PC is actually being used as a weapon to bring in ISIS. And I think it's great that Comedy
[03:58:00.320 --> 03:58:06.480]  Central, yeah, they have been a weapon of deception where they, they had the article
[03:58:06.480 --> 03:58:10.480]  Making Fun of Info Wars with Michael Jackson on the move. And then they had
[03:58:11.440 --> 03:58:18.640]  Obama on The Daily Show talking about with John Stuart about putting gun owners in FEMA camps.
[03:58:18.640 --> 03:58:22.640]  He's got to do it soon. But yes, well, thank you so much. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Thomas,
[03:58:22.640 --> 03:58:27.120]  we are out of time. I want to remind everybody about our debate coverage coming up tonight
[03:58:27.120 --> 03:58:31.360]  live right here in the studio. 7 p.m. Central, myself, Joe Biggs, David Knight,
[03:58:31.360 --> 03:58:57.680]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, the rest of the crew, you don't want to miss it. Stay tuned for that.
