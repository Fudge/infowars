[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:16.000]  radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:16.000 --> 00:22.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, here we go. It is Friday, June 6, 2008. I am not Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:27.000]  I am subbing in for Alex Jones. Today, I think it's my last day. Alex will be back on Sunday,
[00:27.000 --> 00:32.000]  and we've got huge Builderburg news. I mean, massive Builderburg news. Let's just start off
[00:32.000 --> 00:39.000]  before we even get into that with Obama and Hillary meeting in D.C. The night that the conference
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  starts to kick off. Everybody's there. All of a sudden, they're meeting at their house in D.C.
[00:43.000 --> 00:51.000]  Yeah, right. So here's what went on. The elites are in town. Hillary is conceded.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  There's a big sit-down. And I'm going to bet dollars to donuts. You're going to get your Obama
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  hill dog ticket. I really think so. Maybe not. I could be wrong. But boy, did they choose a hell
[01:02.000 --> 01:10.000]  of a time to have a meeting in D.C. or place in D.C. All right. Now, the Builderburg conference
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  has been blown up so much. I guess the Marriots get a bunch of calls. They don't know what to do.
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  So this is what they did. They put a spin on what the Builderburg conference was going to be covering
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  by actually putting out their first ever official press release that I know of. Ridiculous.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  I couldn't make this stuff up. You go to businesswire.com. Totally legit site. Has a good Alexa rating
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  everything else. I checked it out myself to make sure this wasn't a hoax from somebody.
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.000]  Let's just read it. Coming out of Chantilly, Virginia. The 56th Builderburg meeting will be held
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  in Chantilly, Virginia, USA from the 5th to 8th of June, 2008. The conference will deal mainly
[01:46.000 --> 01:53.000]  with a nuclear-free world. See? It's good they're having this conference. Wait. Cyberterrorism
[01:53.000 --> 01:59.000]  and we're going to get into that big time. Cyberterrorism. Oh my God. Africa, Russia,
[01:59.000 --> 02:07.000]  finance, protectionism, US-EU relations. See? Now it's US-EU relations. It's not.
[02:07.000 --> 02:15.000]  Oh, man. European Union, baby. You better believe it. Afghanistan and Pakistan, of course.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  Oh, I like how Pakistan's on the table. That's nice. Maybe Escalon's right. We're going to
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  be talking to Daniel Escalon, by the way, at 1.30. Jesse Benton's coming up in a half
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  an hour. We're going to play him a little video because we have Amy Allen of MTV.
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  This is a big show, folks. Of course, Alex is going to be calling in from Builderburg.
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  Approximately 140 participants will attend. That's 125 members. Then there are 15 buddies
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  that they bring in. There might be a few more. Remember they got iPods in Builderburg, 2008.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  We went over that yesterday. That's really nice. The DOJ bought it before him. In other
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.000]  words, we bought it before him with our tax dollars. Great.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  Of whom about two-thirds come from Europe. About two-thirds of these guys are from Europe
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.000]  and the balance from North America, of course. About one-third is from government and politics,
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  and two-thirds are from finance, industry, labor, education, and communications. The meeting
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.000]  is private in order to encourage frank and open discussions. In other words, it's private
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.000]  because you don't get to know so they can plot against you, the American citizen. This
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  should be an open forum. If it was legit, it would be an open forum. This is garbage.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  Builderburg takes its name from the hotel in Holland where the first meeting took place
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  in May of 1954. That pioneering meeting grew out of the concern expressed by leading citizens
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  on both sides of the Atlantic, that Western Europe and North America were not working together
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.000]  closely as they should on common problems of critical importance. When it first started,
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  it didn't exist. Even 10 years ago, it didn't exist. It was just something people talked
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.000]  about, Cooke's. Now it does exist, and now they set policy there. It's totally illegal.
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  Jones has gone over this, but it is a violation of the Logan Act. It's treason. You can't
[04:02.000 --> 04:10.000]  go over US foreign and domestic policy with people from other nations with other interests,
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  and these are the heads of industry folks. In fact, we already have the Builderburg list.
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  We're going to go over some of the people that are meeting there right now. I mean, this
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  is just incredible that they can't even keep it under wraps, so they're trying to put a
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.000]  positive spin on it. It's garbage. It was felt that regular, off-the-record discussions would
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  help create a better understanding of the complex forces and major trends affecting
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  western nations in the difficult post-war period. We're going to read the rest of this
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  on the other side. Alex is going to be calling in. It is the Alex Jones Show. I'm Jason
[04:38.000 --> 05:04.000]  Hermes. LooseChange901.com.
[05:04.000 --> 05:10.000]  The Builderburg put their objective being world domination. For thousands of years, their
[05:10.000 --> 05:16.000]  dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream
[05:16.000 --> 05:24.000]  of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  entire New World Order agenda. Builderburg is making great progress for the world government.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  They're after power. That's their happenings.

[05:53.000 --> 05:57.000]  Wake up, Protestant America. There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join
[05:57.000 --> 06:02.000]  church and state. This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics and Protestant denominations will
[06:02.000 --> 06:06.000]  form one huge political voting block. Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship
[06:06.000 --> 06:10.000]  and morality by legislation. Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience. History and the Bible proved to them that
[06:14.000 --> 06:19.000]  these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate. It must be our love of God
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.000]  and of country that prompts or constrains us. This will change the character, not civil
[06:23.000 --> 06:28.000]  enforcement. From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome,
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  religious intolerance resulted. This union would go directly contrary to the great
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  principles of our nation. America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.000]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late. The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[06:41.000 --> 06:47.000]  Jesus is coming soon for free materials call 888-211-1715 or write the Bible says
[06:47.000 --> 06:55.000]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee 37771. More than 700 chemicals have been found
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  in our drinking water and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.000]  media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine,
[07:12.000 --> 07:18.000]  lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.000]  comes first. Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.000]  shower filter normally $49 for our special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[08:18.000 --> 08:34.000]  This weekend a lot of policy is going to be set and these 125-140 elites are in the upper
[08:34.000 --> 08:42.000]  echelon. Most of them are pretty high up and what they'll do is disperse their
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000]  agenda this summer at the Bohemian Grove when there's about 3,000 attendees and
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  they'll do this in a compartmentalized style. A lot of people who are in the Bohemian
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  Grove obviously aren't all hardcore pagans and Satan worshippers and into mystic
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  Babylonian nonsense but at the upper echelons they are and through this 140
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.000]  they'll disperse the agenda to this 3,000 who will then disperse it to their
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  minions and so on only giving each of them part of the picture and that's how it
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  works. So let's get back into this. They're now saying the Cold War has now
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  ended but in practically all respects there are more not fewer common problems
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  from trade to jobs, from monetary policy to investment, from ecological challenges
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  to the task of promoting international security. Yes so David Rockefeller should
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  be there to groom everybody obviously. It's a good thing we have this
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  Bilderberg meeting. It is hard to think of any major issue in either Europe or
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  North America whose unilateral solution would not have repercussions for the
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  other. Thus the concept of a European American forum has not been overtaken
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  by time. The dialogue between these two regions is still even increasingly critical.
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  Bilderberg is critical. We need Bilderberg. No they need Bilderberg so they can work
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.000]  behind the scenes and have the media totally black out what their agenda is
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  going to be for the next 12 months. God. What is unique about Bilderberg as a
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  forum is the broad cross-section of leading citizens that are assembled for
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  nearly three days of informal and off-the-record discussion about topics of
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  current concern especially in the fields of foreign affairs and the international
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  economy. The strong feeling among participants that in the view of the
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  differing attitudes and experiences of the western nations there remains a clear
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  need to further develop an understanding in which these concerns can be
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  accommodated. The privacy of the meetings which has no purpose other than to
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.000]  allow participants to speak their minds opens and openly and freely. Yeah so
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  they can say you know what I think we should kill 50% of the population.
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  You know what let's release biological weapons. Let's do that. I'm glad I can
[10:48.000 --> 10:54.000]  say that openly because the media is not going to cover me. Disgusting. Let's
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.000]  talk about the chip. Let's start chipping people. You know what Mexico I was
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.000]  pretty happy with that decision to get rid of passports and start chipping
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  people from Guatemala who want to come in legally. Oh you didn't hear about that?
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  It's only on once on CNN on Lou Dobbs when he was out for the night. We'll play
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  that clip later. Yeah that's right. That was back in January they were
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  starting to make that decision. But it's behind closed doors. There's no other
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  reason than to speak openly. It's because these guys aren't elected to fit. Look
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  some of them are elected officials. Some of them are cabinet members. Most of
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.000]  them are the heads of business and industry and we're going to go over some
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  names. Let me just tell you some straight up names who are there right now.
[11:34.000 --> 11:40.000]  Condi Rice is there okay. Paul Wolfowitz is there. Those are two names you know.
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  Now occasionally they have to bring other people in. That's why the CEO of Google
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  is there. Yeah don't be evil. That used to be their slogan. It'll probably still be
[11:48.000 --> 11:54.000]  their slogan only it's bull. Caught them censoring our videos God.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  In short Bilderberg is a small flexible informal and off the record
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  international forum in which different viewpoints can be expressed and mutual
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  understanding enhanced. See this is what me and G. Edward Griffin were talking about
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  yesterday in the last hour. Listen to the language. The positive spin. It all sounds
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  really nice doesn't it. Oh we're there for your own good. It's garbage.
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  Bilderberg's only activity is its annual conference at the meetings. No
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  resolutions are proposed nonsense. No votes taken nonsense and no policy
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  statements issued. Well yeah they don't issue any policy statements there you're
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  right. They keep it kind of hidden and they disperse the policy statements for
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  later. Since 1954 55 conferences have been held. The names of the participants
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000]  are made available to the press. That's not true. That's not true at all.
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  Jim Tucker for 30 plus years has had to get the names from inside sources. Now
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  they're being made available to the press. Participants are chosen from their
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  experience their knowledge and their standing. All participants attend
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  Bilderberg in a private and not an official capacity. See they try to cover their
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  own ass there again saying well these guys aren't really representing the
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  organizations they own and run. They're there for them.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  There will be no press conference. A list of participants is available by
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  phone request and I'm not going to go out the phone number because we already
[13:18.000 --> 13:24.000]  have the list. So let's look at this. Again the CEO of Google and remember
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  we talked about cyber terrorism. They're going to be talking about that. Well
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  they're already running war games where anti-globalist hackers. Yeah that's
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  right. Anti-globalist hackers not terrorists. People that are against
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.000]  globalism shut down the infrastructure of the government. Come on. The only
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.000]  way they would do that is if you encroached on their freedoms. If you
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  tried to round us up in camps in the nice little FEMA camps you built and
[13:48.000 --> 13:51.000]  it would probably be a totally orchestrated event where some of their
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  assets because you know the government loves to do that. You know these
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  hacker guys most of these guys are good guys but the ones that are really really
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  good at it and do end up getting caught and usually end up getting recruited
[14:01.000 --> 14:06.000]  by our intelligence services. They'd be fools not to. These guys know code like
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  the back of their hand. They can write a bunch of stuff. They can tell you how
[14:09.000 --> 14:15.000]  things get hacked. A lot of these guys get recruited. Common knowledge. But
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  they'll set them up as the next terrorist because that means the population
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  at large anybody could be a hacker. Anybody who knows how to use a computer.
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.000]  God forbid. And it's also another great excuse to bring in internet too where
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.000]  we'll all be forced to thumb scan on our little keyboard to make sure it's us
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  and then we'll get on the internet and they'll be about you know maybe 10 to 20
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  main sites owned by corporations and universities and then they'll have the
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.000]  little sub domain pages. And if we're good little slaves and we have the content
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  that they like they'll let us post there but if we're not they'll just pull it.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  Gone. I mean Google. Google you used to be good. You used to have a top 100. You
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  used to show the statistics of your videos. Okay now you can't even see how
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  many people have viewed it. They did that on purpose folks. Not only can't you see
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  how many people have viewed it but they took away the embed feature for most
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  videos after a certain point you can't embed them. What's up with that. You know
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  it was so much easier when I could just embed all the loose changes everywhere
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  but they made it more difficult. Thank you Google. And really it just
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  disgusts me that a fledgling corporation that came up from nothing that became
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  the second biggest internet site. I think Yahoo beats it and that's it. And they
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.000]  really it's probably the it's tough to say. I'd say it's close to the biggest
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  site of all time. And they start out with a slogan of don't be evil while they're
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  they're evil. They're attending this little conference and they're making big
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  time decisions about you and I. And let's just let's go through some of these guys
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  alright. Let's see at a Belgium we have the vice chairman of something I can't
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.000]  pronounce Etienne Davagon. Let's see we've got Joseph Ackerman the chairman
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  of the management board and group of executive committees of the Deutsche
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  Bank. Everybody knows about the Deutsche Bank. So the Deutsche Bank's in the house
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.000]  that's nice. John Adams is the associate deputy minister of national defense and
[16:09.000 --> 16:15.000]  chief of communication security in Canada. He's there. That's nice. Let's
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  see. We have Fawad Ajahami the Middle East studies program. We've got somebody
[16:21.000 --> 16:26.000]  from the Johns Hopkins University Institute over there. We've got Keith B.
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  Alexander of the National Security Agency in the US. That's nice. He'll go well
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  with Condi. Who knows what they got planned for her. She's probably got another
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  cabinet spot. People have talked about her for VP. But I think that would be
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  suicide for anybody. I don't think they could put her on a ticket. Come on. Nobody
[16:42.000 --> 16:49.000]  likes her. God. Let's see. We got the chairman of Evercore partners out there.
[16:49.000 --> 16:55.000]  We got the minister of foreign affairs out of Turkey. Let's see. You know a lot
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  of people have attended these things. I mean we have you know former prime
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  ministers of the UK. Tony Blair was there. Gordon Brown went there. Obviously
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  Bill Clinton attended the Bilderberg meeting. He's actually admitted to it
[17:07.000 --> 17:12.000]  now. Well I don't know why the press doesn't cover it. We played that clip yesterday too.
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.000]  I don't know why the press doesn't. I've been there in 15 years. He knows why
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.000]  the press doesn't cover this thing because it's not to be covered folks. It's not
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  to be talked about. It's not to be spoken about. And they're giving out a limited
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  I can't believe they put out a press release but they have I guess they have
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.000]  to because there's so many people outside. It can no longer be hidden. And I'm
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  I'm wondering how they're going to spend this Obama Hillary meeting. They've
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  already spun it to say it was at her DC home and probably had nothing to do
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  with Bilderberg. But I taped a bunch of news for Alex last night and we'll see
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.000]  what they said. I mean Gurgans all the top political guys are on there and
[17:51.000 --> 17:54.000]  they were already had to sit down with Obama about the meeting with Hillary.
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.000]  He's like yeah it's going to be the biggest decision in my campaign. And I've
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  always said that I'm going to spend a lot of time deciding on who's going to be
[18:02.000 --> 18:10.000]  my running mate if that's the case. Really? Oh Tom Dashals. Oh Tommy D.
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.000]  I didn't realize Tom Dashals victim of the anthrax attacks back in two thousand
[18:15.000 --> 18:24.000]  and one is there. Well now. Huh. That's crazy. Tom I just lost a little bit of
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  respect for you buddy. Not that I had much. You know because it's a controlled
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  left-right paradigm but I figured you might be one of the semi-good guys.
[18:32.000 --> 18:37.000]  I mean this guy's a former U.S. Senator and Senate majority leader. Wow.
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  So he's over there. But you notice how he's not in office right now. See these
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.000]  these guys still maintain a lot of their power and a lot of their influence
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  through the special interest that support them and through the big business
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  that they've become a part of. You know we don't have a government for and by
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.000]  the people. Let me say it again we don't have a government for and by the people
[18:57.000 --> 19:03.000]  checks and balances are gone. You know the 80 to 140 thousand dollars a year
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.000]  that these public officials in the upper echelons in other words Senate and
[19:07.000 --> 19:11.000]  Congress that they make is nothing and that's nothing to them.
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.000]  They all they're all millionaires. Sometimes billionaires in big business
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  working with the very same people that put them in office. I mean I guess it's
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.000]  kind of fascism light. But it's really not that light anymore.
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.000]  Oh the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is there too.
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  Timothy Gettner. No it's just great. So glad they're having this private
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.000]  meeting for all of us. It's wonderful. It's the Alex Jones show Infowars.com
[19:40.000 --> 19:56.000]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments. Do you realize that with all
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  presently accepted methods you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  are mostly fighting to survive the treatment. Do you realize that mutilating
[20:05.000 --> 20:10.000]  surgery burning and the poisoning of your entire system are totally
[20:10.000 --> 20:16.000]  unnecessary. But now it's cancer's turn to die with lace med inks patented
[20:16.000 --> 20:21.000]  methodology without cutting bleeding drugs or damaging radiation. We can

[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  For years Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  He's been branded by special interest groups as Dr. Noel refusing to bend his values.
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  Ron Paul is running for president. The ideas of strong currency ending the war
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  defending the Constitution and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.000]  As a thank you GCNLive.com might as resources and I would like to send you a free copy
[22:36.000 --> 22:41.000]  of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook. Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[22:41.000 --> 22:48.000]  Again, that's 800-686-2237. I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  That's 800-686-2237. Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[23:02.000 --> 23:07.000]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system,
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  protect a complete fuel system treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition,
[23:16.000 --> 23:21.000]  improving mileage and only one tank full. Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction,
[23:21.000 --> 23:27.000]  but it extends the life of your engine. Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline it's time to take action.
[23:27.000 --> 23:32.000]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment,
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  which is a $12.95 value free.
[23:35.000 --> 23:44.000]  Call 0888-UseSFR1. That number again is 0888-UseSFR1 or check them out online at OilCompanySecret.com.
[23:44.000 --> 24:02.000]  That's OilCompanySecret.com. Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back and it's safe for all cars. Act now.
[24:02.000 --> 24:14.000]  Back it is the Alex Jones show. And you know Henry Kissinger's in the house at Bilderberg. You betcha. George Schultz, Richard Perl, what's up? Queen of Spain, Queen of the Netherlands.
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  That's right, Queen Beatrix is there too. Awesome.
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.000]  So they're all going to get together all the head of the European Central Banks there with the head of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.
[24:23.000 --> 24:30.000]  We even got the governor of Kansas is out there too. Awesome. But David Rockefeller, you know, you know David's there.
[24:30.000 --> 24:38.000]  Gotta love it. George Schultz is there. Henry Kissinger. Yeah, Kissinger, he's a really good guy. Wanted war criminal in many countries.
[24:38.000 --> 24:47.000]  No, he's really good. I'm glad that he's having secret beatings with the upper echelons of power in both North America and Europe. That's good.
[24:47.000 --> 24:56.000]  Because they're all just there. They're not representing anybody. They're not representing their interests, which are big business and consolidation of power and globalization.
[24:56.000 --> 25:03.000]  They'd never be doing that. No press conference, but a press release. I guess that's more than we've ever gotten before.
[25:03.000 --> 25:11.000]  I guess that they realize now that this information is going to come out. The list comes out every year. They might as well just put it out there.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  I mean, they're already getting iPods for everybody from the DOJ. That's right, Department of Justice buying iPods for the elite.
[25:17.000 --> 25:31.000]  Our tax dollars giving Bilderberg 2008 engraved iPods to people like Condoleezza Rice, who is pretty responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions.
[25:31.000 --> 25:40.000]  Good job, America. We rock. We totally and completely rock.
[25:40.000 --> 25:47.000]  The real question is, are we going to step up? I know there's a lot of people outside of Bilderberg, but we're going to make this a huge story in the next week.
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  Are we going to put this on every single blog we can? Are we going to dig it? I know the dig. Barry Brigade is out there.
[25:53.000 --> 25:58.000]  We're going to throw it up on the Huffington Post. Is Raw Story going to do an article? Is Counterpunch going to do an article?
[25:58.000 --> 26:06.000]  Is Op-Ed going to do an article? Well, I'll tell you where the best articles are going to be barred on and the ones that you have to repost in those places on the comments board.
[26:06.000 --> 26:15.000]  They're going to be at infowars.com, prismplanet.com, and for prismplanet.tv subscribers, remember, we have the final hour, which is going to be with Amy Allen.
[26:15.000 --> 26:25.000]  I only wish it was in studio. You can watch that on prismplanet.tv for about 15 cents a day, which is a great deal.
[26:25.000 --> 26:37.000]  You can get all of Alex Jones's movies, his weekly access show, and get my documentaries, lose changes up there. It's a total deal. You help support this network.
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.000]  I know I was supposed to give the money bomb total today, but I haven't talked to Alex yet and I don't have a final number.
[26:43.000 --> 26:52.000]  I think with all the checks and all the donations, I believe we did hit around $250,000 or maybe a little bit less.
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.000]  But that's going towards a new network. We need your support here, and hopefully we're going to put that on Dish TV.
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  We've got to reach the masses. Al Gore has his little network over there on current TV, which is a cool little network.
[27:03.000 --> 27:10.000]  They don't censor much over there. The only problem is that Al Gore owns it, and it's all this green agenda, too, so they put a lot of propaganda on there.
[27:10.000 --> 27:19.000]  But there's a lot of good anti-war stuff. They don't really censor much of it. I'm a big fan of it, and anybody can be their own journalist, which is what I've always encouraged people to do.
[27:19.000 --> 27:31.000]  If you don't like the way the system is, if you can't stand what's happening in this country, if you have a tough question to ask a member of Congress, a member of the Senate,
[27:31.000 --> 27:40.000]  a member of the United States Cabinet, a member of Homeland Security, a member of an intelligence agency, these spokespeople, these talking heads,
[27:40.000 --> 27:49.000]  a member of the supposed, quote-unquote, mainstream media that's supposed to be protecting us, the Sean Handys, the Bill O'Reilly. Let's not give the left a pass, either.
[27:49.000 --> 27:57.000]  You need to get out there. You need to become the media. There's no more excuse. It's unbelievable how cheap a camcorder is.
[27:57.000 --> 28:06.000]  If you went on eBay right now, and you got a first or second generation DV cam, which is already pretty small, you probably got it for like $150, $200, maybe less.
[28:06.000 --> 28:15.000]  Tapes are $10, and then it's just the will, the motivation to go to an event, the motivation to have some spine, to stand up for what you believe in.
[28:15.000 --> 28:23.000]  And then you post it on YouTube, and you might only get 10 hits at first. You might get 1,000 hits the second time. You might get 100,000 hits eventually.
[28:23.000 --> 28:31.000]  It's all about believing that you can change the system. Ron Paul believed he could change the system, and from what I've seen, he's helped do that.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  You know, a lot of people want to dog him out at this point, and I'm not going to be one of them. We're going to have Jesse Benton, by the way, on.
[28:37.000 --> 28:47.000]  He's a campaign manager coming up after the break. I mean, he's a bestselling author with a nonfiction book with Manifesto in the title.
[28:47.000 --> 28:54.000]  And everybody's trying to ignore him. He raised more money than any other Republican candidate in the race.
[28:54.000 --> 29:01.000]  He's a true American hero. He wants to get us out of Iraq. He wants to get us out of Afghanistan. He wants smaller government.
[29:01.000 --> 29:07.000]  He wants a currency that's going to be worth something. Wow, what a concept.
[29:07.000 --> 29:15.000]  He believes in, you know, gold and silver and hard assets, and he believes in personal responsibilities and freedom.
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  Well, that's what I believe in, too.
[29:17.000 --> 29:22.000]  So on the other side of the break, we're going to be having Jesse Benton. Remember, we have Daniel Estalon coming up.
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  We also have Amy Allen, and we're going to be taking your calls after Jesse Benton, so call on in.
[29:27.000 --> 29:53.000]  This is Alex Jones, so I am Jason Burmes, Infowars.com.

[32:11.000 --> 32:20.000]  Here's the story. New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed Internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.

[33:11.000 --> 33:22.000]  Alright folks, we are back. And unfortunately, we couldn't get ahold of Jesse Benton. We get it wrong every once in a while. Sometimes we have a little problem contacting people.
[33:22.000 --> 33:29.000]  But that's alright. Because I want to play a little bit of music from the Flowbots. We've got a big segment here we're going to be taking your calls.
[33:29.000 --> 33:39.000]  But, you know, we had the Flowbots on, I think, two weeks ago now. They just rocked the house on Leno. This is the type of positive music. And Amy Allen's, you know, badass too. We're going to play her video.
[33:39.000 --> 33:46.000]  I was going to play it for Jesse Benton, but apparently we might not have him on. Oh, too sad. Anyway, they rocked the house on Leno last night.
[33:46.000 --> 33:53.000]  I think the whole album has a great message. Maybe a little bit left leaning, but I think that these guys can be pushed into the right direction.
[33:53.000 --> 34:00.000]  And kind of at the end, what do I play? Do I play We Are Winning? Or do we play Rise? Maybe we'll play both of them today.
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.000]  I'm going to start off with We Are Winning because it is a cool track and I hope you enjoy.
[34:06.000 --> 34:24.000]  Remember, this is the Alex Jones show and you can check out all the latest Bilderberg information over at infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.000]  Private gangsters sit down to plan an after-score program.
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.000]  A religious fanatic posts footage of an interfaith service project.
[34:47.000 --> 34:55.000]  A group of teenage boys watches a video of a father playing catch with his son.
[34:55.000 --> 35:08.000]  An adult film star paints thumbnail portraits of elderly couples, fully clothed and smiling. A record executive records them all, his apology.
[35:08.000 --> 35:18.000]  A policeman makes reverse 911 calls, instructing residents to take to the streets. The patriarch reports for duty.
[35:18.000 --> 35:28.000]  She's wearing an orange jumpsuit and holding a ticket sign. She's ashamed of her birthplace, but retreat is not an option.
[35:28.000 --> 35:35.000]  Women and children, front line, fog on, tune in, stand and be counted, move in, station in the belly of the boat.
[35:35.000 --> 35:40.000]  So watch your backs, there's no civilians, women, children, front lines, listen.
[35:40.000 --> 35:54.000]  Consider this a distant early morning, the fires imminent pollution, gathering dark particles, funneling through smoke stacks, airwaves, bandwidth, disinformation, too bad, check the labels, delete the virus, alert the masses.
[35:54.000 --> 36:00.000]  Butterfly wing crosswinds send black hawks toward hurricane survivors.
[36:00.000 --> 36:11.000]  Roses sprout from empty lots and sidewalk cracks. Pacifist gorillas move undetected through concrete jungles.
[36:11.000 --> 36:23.000]  New forms are beginning to take shape. Once occupied mines are activating, people are waking up. The insurgency is alive and well.
[36:23.000 --> 36:31.000]  Rise of the full-bought fortune calls the new American insertion. The battle ensures the foundations of the world order.
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.000]  And certainly lies and sin resists, refusals and fornications. Direct love once to the trenches.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  Sooner or more, trouble into fortresses, clashes to problem level.
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  Broken porcelain, rust and platinum, burn blood stains from decompressed diamonds.
[36:46.000 --> 36:56.000]  Hair of the battle, dry into braille studded armor. We are building up a new world. Do not sit highly by. Do not remain neutral.
[36:56.000 --> 37:03.000]  Do not rely on this broadcast alone. We are only as strong as our signal.
[37:03.000 --> 37:12.000]  There is a war going on for your mind. If you are thinking, you are winning. Resistance is victory.
[37:12.000 --> 37:23.000]  Defeat is impossible. Your weapons are already in hand. Reach within you and find the means by which to gain your freedom.
[37:23.000 --> 37:32.000]  Fight with tools. Your fate and that of everyone you know depends on it.
[37:32.000 --> 37:38.000]  That's right folks. Fight with tools. Man, I love that album. That is We Are Winning.
[37:38.000 --> 37:43.000]  And I think it really speaks to what we are going through right now. We need to stand up.
[37:43.000 --> 37:50.000]  Don't rely on this broadcast alone. Check out the actual source material that we source in every single one of our articles.
[37:50.000 --> 37:57.000]  See past the spin. Start your own network. Do your own radio show. Get on the streets.
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.000]  Join truthaction.org. Start your own chapter of We Are Change. If you are a student, join student scholars.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  There is so much we can do.
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  These are the people that are doing what the mainstream media should be doing.
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.000]  The problem is that the mainstream media is at this meeting.
[38:11.000 --> 38:17.000]  Google is huge. Think about that. The head of Google is here with the head of the Federal Reserve in New York.
[38:17.000 --> 38:23.000]  David Rockefeller of Chase, Bankman, Manhattan. David Rockefeller folks. Come on.
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  Kissinger. George Schultz. He has been going for years. I think he is a member of the Grove.
[38:28.000 --> 38:36.000]  He is one of those guys that will help set policy here and then go to the Grove and kind of dispense all that to everybody else.
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  It's really nice of them. Richard Perl. He is a real criminal.
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.000]  Yep, sure is. Big time criminal. Criminally.
[38:43.000 --> 38:49.000]  I said I would take your call. Let's take Cliff in Louisiana. Cliff, are you there?
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.000]  You with me, Cliff? No, maybe you dropped.
[38:54.000 --> 39:03.000]  We will keep moving on. Let's go to Tony in Indiana. Tony with me. This is just terrible.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  Can you hear me? Yeah. How are you doing? Good, man.
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.000]  I have two ideas for fighting the New World Order and I want to see what your thoughts are. Let's hear it.
[39:11.000 --> 39:16.000]  First one, I think we need some sort of registry or database so that people can go on.
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  I know we have to do this the right way, but people can go on and register and say,
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  if I commit suicide, kind of like the DC Madame thing, I will never commit suicide.
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  If something happens to me, look into it.
[39:27.000 --> 39:32.000]  And then the second idea is for a documentary and I'm very curious to see your thoughts on this.
[39:32.000 --> 39:39.000]  Everybody talks so much about how there's natural cures to healing cancer and diseases like that.
[39:39.000 --> 39:46.000]  If we can get somebody who has cancer, get them on tape going into three or four different western medical doctors saying,
[39:46.000 --> 39:53.000]  maybe chemotherapy, you need radiation or you're going to die, and then track them through a natural healing course.
[39:53.000 --> 39:59.000]  Watch them get better and then help open people's eyes to see that radiation and chemotherapy aren't the only answer.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  What do you think of those two ideas, ma'am?
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.000]  Well, I think that they're good ideas. Obviously, you can put together a website for the first one, no problem.
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  And the second one is obviously going to take a lot of work.
[40:09.000 --> 40:15.000]  Making a movie is no easy task and especially making a movie with somebody who may be terminally ill
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.000]  is going to be extremely difficult. That's a great idea. You have to will it to happen, though.
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.000]  See what you can do to work forward and press on, man.
[40:23.000 --> 40:29.000]  If that's your idea, maybe you need to start making some contacts that will have the time to put together a project like that.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  I'm definitely thinking about it. The only thing that makes me nervous about the database is if it gets in the wrong hands,
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  then the government can look at the database and have a list of them.
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  We're all public anyway, man. There's no doubt about it.
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.000]  MySpace and Facebook and all that other stuff, we've given away so much information at this point.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  It's almost negligible. I thank you for the call.
[40:47.000 --> 40:52.000]  We do have Jesse Benton on the line, Ron Paul's campaign manager. Jesse, how are you?
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  I'm doing very well. How are you?
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  Good. So why don't you tell us what the latest with the campaign is?
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  Obviously, Ron Paul is still in the race but is taking kind of a back seat.
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  A lot of people are asking if he may have a presence at the RNC.
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  What's going to happen in the future for the campaign?
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  Glad you're asking me this. We have some pretty exciting news.
[41:11.000 --> 41:18.000]  We have just come to contract with Space to hold a rally in Minneapolis.
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  It's going to be really big. We're going to be able to have thousands and thousands of people at this rally.
[41:22.000 --> 41:30.000]  We're going to have it on Tuesday, September 2nd in St. Paul around the Republican National Convention.
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.000]  I'm sure a lot of the listeners out there are going to be very interested in attending.
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.000]  We're going to be releasing more information about this officially early next week.
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.000]  So please stay tuned on exact logistics, but we're really excited.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  Actually, this is the first outlet that I've shared this information with.
[41:47.000 --> 41:54.000]  Excellent. And you know, Ron Paul, number one New York Times bestseller now with his nonfiction book,
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  Ron Paul Revolution and Manifesto.
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.000]  And that's just incredible to me on so many levels.
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.000]  Number one, that first of all, somebody who was knocked out of the race and ignored by the media on purpose
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  is able to have a number one New York Times bestseller.
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  But number two, it's a nonfiction book with the word Manifesto in it.
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.000]  And that's incredible alone, but he's kind of been blacked out in the mainstream media.
[42:17.000 --> 42:23.000]  Normally you would see him on Oprah and every other talk show, but he's only done some sparse media.
[42:23.000 --> 42:32.000]  Well, you know, I wouldn't say we've been blacked out, but having gotten the attention that we think that Ron deserves.
[42:32.000 --> 42:40.000]  But I think you make a great point that this book is making it impossible for people to ignore Ron if they've been trying to.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  You know, this is our entering our sixth week in the top 10 New York Times bestseller list.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  It was number one for a week.
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.000]  And that's just pretty amazing that a political book is selling so well.
[42:51.000 --> 42:57.000]  You know, there's a lot of supporters are buying books, but this book is a great vehicle to introduce your friends
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  and your coworkers to the idea of liberty.
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  It's a very digestible book.
[43:02.000 --> 43:09.000]  It's written to be able to share with, you know, just kind of a common person on the street that doesn't have time to,
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  or the inclination at this point to sit around and read, you know, huge volumes by Ludwig von Mises.
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.000]  You know, this is a really great tool and I would encourage people to, if you haven't gotten a copy of it,
[43:20.000 --> 43:23.000]  read it and then share it with your friends and your family.
[43:23.000 --> 43:24.000]  Absolutely.
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.000]  And we have Alex on the line from Chantilly, Virginia.
[43:28.000 --> 43:29.000]  Alex, what's the latest?
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.000]  Okay.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  We found an area in the hotel that has been backed by the conference rooms.
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  Most hotels in acre or two or three or four off the road.
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.000]  We found a little spot that's on the wing where they're having the conference rooms.
[43:40.000 --> 43:41.000]  So we walked through it yesterday.
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.000]  Richard and Haas, the president of the CFR just walked out through the woods.
[43:44.000 --> 43:50.000]  Folks got videoed and my file was recognized and they zoomed in and said, yeah, it's Richard and Haas.
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  So I'm going to bullhorn them right now and I'll let you get back to your guest and later I'll call them with a full report.
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.000]  Here we go.
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.000]  I'm going to bullhorn them right now, Jason.
[43:55.000 --> 43:56.000]  All right.
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.000]  All right.
[43:57.000 --> 44:03.000]  There is Alex Jones at the Bilderberg conference and they actually put out a press release this year, folks.
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.000]  I couldn't believe it, but if you go to businessworld.com, there's a contact number.
[44:06.000 --> 44:13.000]  The full list of attendees is already out there and Alex is going to be calling in through the day.
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.000]  And Jesse, I was just wondering if you were aware of this girl named Amy Allen.
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  She's an MTV personality.
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  She had a big hit with this song called Revolution.
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  Have you heard this about this girl?
[44:23.000 --> 44:24.000]  I have.
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  I'm a fan and Dr. Paul is really flattered, too.
[44:28.000 --> 44:37.000]  And we're actually probably going to reach out to her and see if she's interested in having a playing a part in September if her schedule is great.
[44:37.000 --> 44:44.000]  So we can ask her today. She's on the air at two o'clock and we got her for a full hour and I'm pretty excited about it, too.
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.000]  The unofficial Ron Paul Revolution video is just tremendous.
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  Oh, I think so, too.
[44:49.000 --> 44:58.000]  We need to look and think about how we can reach different people with the message of individual freedom and liberty.
[44:58.000 --> 45:05.000]  And I think that she's absolutely a tremendous way to reach younger people, people that haven't turned on to our ideas yet.
[45:05.000 --> 45:10.000]  She's so talented and her music is really timely and popular.
[45:10.000 --> 45:19.000]  And she's just a great way to, again, reach out to people that, especially the under 30 crowd, that maybe haven't listened yet.
[45:19.000 --> 45:20.000]  Absolutely.
[45:20.000 --> 45:26.000]  And that's what I'm all about, too, these separate avenues of waking people up to the fact that our government doesn't really work anymore,
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.000]  that we don't have checks and balances anymore.
[45:30.000 --> 45:38.000]  And that, you know, the media is only paying attention to a couple of candidates and really pushing them no matter what the people actually want.
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  You know, they're in the business of censorship and blinding the masses.
[45:42.000 --> 45:49.000]  But, you know, Ron Paul is now focusing on keeping his congressional seat so he can fight the battles on the House floor, correct?
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  Well, he secured his House seat.
[45:51.000 --> 46:01.000]  We had a contested primary on May 4th and Ron won 71% of the vote and a Democrat has not filed a run against him in the fall,
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  so he's got a clear path.
[46:03.000 --> 46:10.000]  You know, I guess what Ron is just focusing on is building an organization for the future.
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  You know, so much has been accomplished through this campaign.
[46:13.000 --> 46:19.000]  It's just been tremendous and amazing to see all the hard work and the grassroots across the country.
[46:19.000 --> 46:25.000]  And, you know, we need to realize that the campaign was step one in the revolution.
[46:25.000 --> 46:32.000]  You know, step two is going to be continuing on, organizing at the grassroots level and, you know, electing other candidates,
[46:32.000 --> 46:38.000]  identifying other leaders, getting other candidates elected to state office, to the House of Representatives,
[46:38.000 --> 46:46.000]  and at the same time holding, you know, elected politicians to speak to the fire and saying, hey, we actually want you to obey the Constitution.
[46:46.000 --> 46:51.000]  So we know that Ron is not interested in a third-party run for the presidency,
[46:51.000 --> 46:59.000]  but I'd kind of like to get your take on Jesse Ventura's comments that he would love to run with Ron Paul as his vice president
[46:59.000 --> 47:05.000]  or possibly he as his vice president or vice versa, you know, because he shares a lot of the same beliefs.
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.000]  First of all, have you heard these comments?
[47:07.000 --> 47:12.000]  And what do you think of Jesse's latest book, You Know, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me?
[47:12.000 --> 47:19.000]  I have not read Mr. Ventura's book yet, Governor Ventura. I know that, you know, Governor Ventura is certainly a charismatic guy.
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.000]  And, you know, I think that he and Ron would have a lot to talk about.
[47:23.000 --> 47:33.000]  You know, I think that having a leader like him, somebody who's outspoken and charismatic, would be outstanding for our country.
[47:33.000 --> 47:39.000]  And, you know, I'm sure that there's lots of room to work together.
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  Well, I hope that they do get together and at least talk about some issues like that.
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  We have Alex. I guess we don't have Alex. Alex is in and out.
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  He's so busy over there at Chantilly, Virginia right now.
[47:48.000 --> 47:54.000]  But yeah, I hope they sit down and, you know, maybe if they can't, you know, get into political office together, you know,
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  start a new organization, start a new website.
[47:56.000 --> 48:03.000]  Just keep getting people aware because, you know, Jesse Ventura has a certain celebrity about him even before he was governor
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  and then after he was governor, almost a super celebrity about him.
[48:06.000 --> 48:13.000]  And it really seems like the masses really gravitate towards that kind of pop culture personality.
[48:13.000 --> 48:18.000]  And Jesse Ventura, to me, is one of the better pop culture personalities.
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  Yeah, I think you have a great point.
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.000]  And, you know, something that a lot of people have to realize is that the people that are really engaged, the activists,
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  we're not like everybody else.
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  You know, I think we spend a lot more time thinking about politics and issues than the average person.
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  The average person is out there.
[48:33.000 --> 48:38.000]  And, you know, I think they realize that something's wrong with our country and maybe we're not headed in the right direction.
[48:38.000 --> 48:45.000]  But, you know, they're going to get the majority of their news and information just from, you know, 10 seconds, 30 seconds soundbites on the evening news.
[48:45.000 --> 48:53.000]  So you're right, reaching out through pop culture and embracing people that way, bringing people into the revolution that way
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  is the way that we really have to think about going.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  Absolutely. And, you know, again, that's what we need to do, people.
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.000]  We have to make it appealing because to people like Jesse Benton and myself, these issues are primary.
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.000]  They're what we wake up and think about.
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  It's what we research. We go over paperwork every day.
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  This isn't even secondary or even third in most people's lives.
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  You know, first things first is usually people's family.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  Second thing is their job.
[49:18.000 --> 49:19.000]  Third thing is their mortgage.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  Fourth thing is their car payment.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  And then it's being cool and watching their sports team.
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  And we really need to change that because if you truly do want to protect your family,
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  if you truly do want to live in a first world nation in the next 10 to 20 years,
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  you have to wake up to these issues.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  The dollar has been devalued so much.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  Gas prices have gone up so much.
[49:38.000 --> 49:43.000]  And I just cannot believe that they're actually rationing certain foods in New York, but it's happened.
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  I cannot believe it, but over in BJs and another Sam's Club,
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  you can only get like three bags of rice at each time you go to the store.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  That's insane to me. This is America.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  We should be able to purchase whatever we want.
[49:55.000 --> 49:59.000]  I think the country is headed in a dark place, Jesse.
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.000]  And I'd just like to get your take on where do you think the country is going now
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  that we're going to have these two mainline candidates, McCain and Obama, as our president?
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  Well, I think that America is very much headed down the wrong path.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  And that's why Dr. Paul ran for the presidency.
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  He sees the path that we're headed on.
[50:18.000 --> 50:27.000]  I think that we see with a crashing dollar and with a military that's stretched to its end.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  So we need to change path.
[50:29.000 --> 50:34.000]  And the great thing is we've got the wonderful document, the Constitution, the United States of America.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  Our answers lie there.
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.000]  And if we just follow the Constitution, we can light this ship, but we need to start now.
[50:40.000 --> 50:54.000]  I'm with you. It's Infowars.com.
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[51:05.000 --> 51:11.000]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[51:11.000 --> 51:15.000]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[51:15.000 --> 51:20.000]  In the Infowar, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[51:54.000 --> 52:00.000]  Another untold story here it come.
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  Another untold story here it come.
[52:04.000 --> 52:09.000]  Another untold story that you have not been told from.
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  Another untold story dot com.
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  Have you ever heard of the pioneer story in the 1800s called Blood River?
[52:19.000 --> 52:27.000]  Most today have not been told that story, but there was a day everyone was told and told the story of Blood River.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  At least in South Africa anyway.
[52:30.000 --> 52:36.000]  They were white South African pioneers of Dutch Africana stock called the Boers.
[52:36.000 --> 52:44.000]  460 of them that had to circle their slow moving oxen powered wagon train because they knew they could not outrun Shaka.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  Shaka was coming.
[52:46.000 --> 52:51.000]  Coming with 30,000 bloodthirsty, warring, raping, killing warriors.
[52:51.000 --> 52:58.000]  They were a well trained, victorious, warring tribe called the Zulus led by a military genius of his own right called Shaka.
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  30,000 of them against 460.
[53:01.000 --> 53:06.000]  When the battle ended, the river literally ran red with the stain of blood.
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  And when it was all over, 12,000 laid lifeless.
[53:10.000 --> 53:16.000]  12,000 Zulus, but not one of the 460 were injured.
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  How could this be? How could it happen?
[53:19.000 --> 53:23.000]  Will it happen that the Boers did something just prior to the battle?
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  Something that caused something else to happen in the sky.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  It's all quite a story.
[53:28.000 --> 53:31.000]  Hear it at another untold story dot com.

[53:57.000 --> 54:00.000]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[54:04.000 --> 54:07.000]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[54:07.000 --> 54:12.000]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[54:15.000 --> 54:19.000]  The ring of fire, the ring of fire.
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.000]  It is the Alex Jones show, June 6th, 2008, end of the week.
[54:24.000 --> 54:31.000]  And Alex is out in Chantilly, Virginia at the Bilderberg conference.
[54:31.000 --> 54:37.000]  I just popped it on and will probably be showing that during the final hour of the show,
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.000]  which is broadcast via TV at prisonplanet.tv.
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  We're with Jesse Benton.
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.000]  Jesse, where can people get the latest information on Ron Paul?
[54:46.000 --> 54:51.000]  You just broke this news about a Minneapolis gathering Tuesday, September 2nd.
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  It would be great if you'd get Amy Allen there.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  But where can people get the updates?
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.000]  Do we not have Jesse anymore?
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  Well, that's all right now.
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.000]  That's okay.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  I guess people just Google it.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  We'll just move on, I guess, because this We Are Changed stuff is big.
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  I'm looking at a screen and there's Rob.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  I can see about 20 people there.
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  And really, they're just trying to film all the cars that are coming in and out.
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.000]  It is such good news to know that the alternative media is getting a voice,
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  that this is getting out there.
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  In the respect, there's Alex Bullhorning.
[55:29.000 --> 55:36.000]  I'm sure he's going to be calling back in at the top of the hour to Bullhorn even more.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  Man, this is just good stuff.
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  They had to put out a press release this year, people.
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.000]  Think about that.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  They had to put out a press release.
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  Not only does Bilderberg exist, now they're healthy for us.
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  And they word it in such a manner that they're all there of their own accordance,
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  and it's kind of like a little party.
[55:53.000 --> 56:00.000]  We have to keep it secret and private so we can talk openly about killing and enslaving you.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  But we're good.
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.000]  Remember, the conference will deal mainly with nuclear-free world,
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  cyber-terrorism, Africa, Russia, and finance.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  Okay, we do have Jesse Benton back.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  Jesse, where can people find the latest on Ron Paul?
[56:15.000 --> 56:20.000]  Obviously, you just broke this story about the Minneapolis gathering on Tuesday, September 2nd.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  When can we see a post about that?
[56:22.000 --> 56:29.000]  Well, we're going to have a new website that's going to launch next week that's going to have that kind of information.
[56:29.000 --> 56:36.000]  It's going to be campaign for Liberty.org, www.campaignforliberty.org.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  So early next week, people should start to tune in and look for an announcement.
[56:40.000 --> 56:46.000]  We're going to have an announcement about what we're doing in Minneapolis and about some plans moving forward,
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  about how we can all work together to keep this revolution going.
[56:49.000 --> 56:54.000]  So again, campaign for Liberty.org and look for that to go live early next week.
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.000]  Jesse, how did you originally get involved in not only the Ron Paul campaign,
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  but the Patriot movement in general?
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.000]  Was this something you were always interested in or was there just a point in time
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.000]  when something didn't feel right and you just started to do research?
[57:06.000 --> 57:09.000]  What was it that triggered you to get so involved in these politics?
[57:09.000 --> 57:15.000]  Well, I've always been, I was a little bit of a conservative movement hack for a while
[57:15.000 --> 57:21.000]  and I worked for some Republicans and some pretty prominent conservative movement groups.
[57:21.000 --> 57:27.000]  I always liked what they said about limited government and personal freedom,
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  but just the more that I got educated, the more that I read,
[57:30.000 --> 57:36.000]  I realized that a lot of Republicans aren't really backing this up with action.
[57:36.000 --> 57:42.000]  So I formed my own consulting group and I was just working for some really great groups,
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  the American Conservatives Fence Alliance, the Liberty Coalition,
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.000]  and was able to just work for projects that I felt passionately about.
[57:49.000 --> 57:53.000]  And in the beginning, the campaign was a client to mine.
[57:53.000 --> 57:58.000]  They needed some help getting set up when they had just two people working,
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  just Justin Lamb and Kent Snyder.
[58:00.000 --> 58:05.000]  So I was the third person who started doing some work and it fit real well and I really enjoyed it.
[58:05.000 --> 58:11.000]  So campaignforliberty.com and that's going to be up in the next week or so, Jesse?
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  Yeah, campaignforliberty.org, although I think the campaignforliberty.com will work too.
[58:15.000 --> 58:18.000]  Awesome. Alright, Jesse, thank you so much for your time.
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  Campaign manager for Ron Paul. Thank you, man.
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  We're going to be back with Alex Jones bullhorning. It is the Alex Jones show.
[58:24.000 --> 58:29.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:29.000 --> 58:34.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[58:37.000 --> 58:42.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  It's now and ever.
[58:44.000 --> 58:54.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[58:54.000 --> 59:02.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:02.000 --> 59:09.000]  For the first time in history, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[59:09.000 --> 59:18.000]  It is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:25.000 --> 59:29.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[59:39.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  Blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  On the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back and we have Alex on the line. He was just bullhorning.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  I'm looking at a live picture of him with a bullhorn over at wearchange.org.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  And this is just incredible. There's about 25 people with him. It looks like.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  And there's security. They got little golf carts. I'm sorry, golf carts.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  And Alex, are you with me?
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  Alright, yep, yep, we got it. Here we go.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  Eight, nine years ago, you would never see this in the media. You would never hear this in the media.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  The media wouldn't admit this existed. The billimbers wouldn't be forced to put out a press release as they were today.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  But now they are, because I've been going on coast to coast day and the last three nights with 16 million listeners, exposing this to the entire world.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  To the entire world. What's going on here?
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  And we're broadcasting live right now to YouTube, to hundreds of thousands of people.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  And we're broadcasting to millions over the GCN Radio Network.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  That's the technology right now. Millions on the radio listing. And we're streaming video out on the web.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  To hundreds of thousands.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  We are not your slaves. We are not your property.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  We have the courage to stand up against you. And yes, we know your murderers. Yes, we know you have giant hit teams.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Yes, we know your death threats mean not to come here. But who is here? And if you kill me, you only make the movement for liberty and humanity stronger.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  Your death threats, Billiburg, will not stop us from coming here peacefully.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  We had State Department guns and FBI goods coming into our hotel rooms, coming up to our offices, coming up to the restaurants, and asking us if we were planning anything violent.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  We have a history of liberty, a history of freedom and nonviolence. It's the Billiburg group that has a history of blowing the hell out of ancient civilizations.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  They are the murderers. They are who are dangerous, not us. It's the criminals who are protecting that are dangerous, not us.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Yeah, I don't appreciate all the guns you've had coming up, asking us questions, but guns go into people's houses.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  You're too cowardly to do it here. You follow people home to their homes in Virginia and try to intimidate them with a little kid.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Well, you don't. And come out of it all. We don't. You're the criminals.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Let's talk about criminals. I mean, David Rockefeller, Queen Beatrix, and others. Not sure what we're talking about here.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  And we are here as free humanity, standing up against your tyranny for eternity.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Yeah!
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, it is incredible. Technology is great. I mean, we're live at Bilderberg with Alex Jones.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  They've pressured them so much, and Alex has been on coast to coast the last few nights that they had to put out a press release saying,
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  everything's OK. We're really good. You know, it's only private because we want to be able to talk openly and candidly.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  Yeah, openly and candidly about enslaving us, about killing us, about forming unions that erode our sovereignty. It's unbelievable. Alex, are you there?
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  We are goodhearted. We know a lot of you have been misled and deceived. The American public has been deceived for a long time.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  We've been awoken from our slumber by the horrors of 9-11, the horrors that have followed in the trial of 9-11.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  It's not too late for many of you to come over to the side of what's good and right and defend the liberty and the freedom of the Constitution of the United States of America.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  You swore an oath to that. You swore an oath to the truth about life and beneath that, not to the executive. You swore an oath to the defendant of all values.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  Once again, folks, we are live from Bilderberg. The criminals are being bullhorned. The truth is rising. This is the Alex Jones show.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  This is cutting edge. This is where it's at. That's why you need to go to infowars.com. You need to go to prismplanet.com because we've got the info.

[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  Hi folks, we are back and they are out there bullwarning Kissinger, Bernacke, Condoleezza Rice, Wolfowitz, Richard Pearl, the CEOs of Google, the heads of the Deutsche Bank, David Rockefeller.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  They're all there folks and it's only through this broadcast, The Alex Jones Show, that you're going to get cutting edge info like this.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  Alex, are you with us? No, we don't have Alex?
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  Yes, we're on the earth.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  It would be so easy for you to just admit to the crimes you've committed.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  It would be so easy for you to come out and be heroes like so many have been doing.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  We've had prime ministers and presidents and the president of Czechoslovakia coming out.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  We have seen so many people.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  Scott McClellan's come out of the White House and told us what we already hear from documents that they lied, lied about it all.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  They wanted the oil and no good weapons contracts, 3 trillion of them.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  Just like people inside the Clinton government exposed the crimes.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  It's both parties are controlled.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  Robin Cook was about to be prime minister. He spoke up the murdering just a few months ago for Gordon Brown.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  So he could come out and give us no order speeches.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  That's another point I want to make.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  I know it's dangerous coming and confronting you.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  I know you're mass murderers.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  I know you're a sadistic psychopath who enjoyed killing innocent people.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  And I know the only reason you haven't killed me, Alex Jones, is because you're afraid it'll give too much attention to what we're doing.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  It'll water the tree of liberty in your life.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  If you strike us down, we only become more powerful.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  I hit the head of the Kissinger group who was in the Washington Post a month ago with the headline,
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Lay Rule, admitting that you guys run the planet.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  And we called him up to have him on as a guest. He said, oh, yeah, Mr. Jones, I want to come on and counter you.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  We all know who you are.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  So with the police here that think I'm just saying that, I don't know.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  These guys all know who we are. They all know we're hot on their tail.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  So just point off a part of Alex Jones in the middle, you can hear the radio interview.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  Where they admit they run things and laugh about it.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  Some of these people even come on my show and admit what they're engaged in and what they're doing.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  I can't be closed.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Absolutely.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  We're going to go to Dylan Abrie now to let him do some bullhorn landscapes.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  We can watch this live, we are change.org.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  People are winning the Info War right now, hundreds, if not thousands of people
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Look at this shit, it's bullhorn, folks.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:58.560]  that's happening right now on WeAreChanged.org. There's a live video going on right now. Even
[1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:05.200]  though you rule in secrecy, even though you've come in black tinted cars, we will still expose
[1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:11.600]  you wherever you go at book signings, at any other event we will expose you all over the
[1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:17.360]  internet, and we have been doing so. We started in New York City, and now there's over 50
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:24.160]  chapters worldwide, confronting criminal scum everywhere you go. You can't hide. Trump will
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:31.120]  prevail. Your secrecy will fail, and there will never be a new world order. Freedom will prevail,
[1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:36.880]  and national sovereignty will prevail. Thank you, Luke Redalsky. I was calling Jason
[1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:41.120]  Ramis on everything for some reason. My brain's so scrambled here. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:45.840]  again, you just heard from Luke Redalsky, who about a year and a half ago started WeAreChanged,
[1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:51.200]  chapters all over the world, citizen activists, 9-11 truth, all these groups, because make no
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:59.280]  mistake, these guys wrote policy reports decades ago about staging terror attacks and blaming it
[1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:05.760]  on domestic populations they want to enslave by launching wars. Google Operation Northwoods.
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:12.640]  You'll get ABC News, Baltimore Sun, AP, headline, U.S. Government Plan to Terrorize Cities
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:18.080]  as Pre-Tex for War, but the plan got discovered and they canceled it. What was the Operation
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:23.120]  Northwoods plan? And don't laugh, ladies, because why would I like to laugh at everything? Some of
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:28.640]  you may actually go Google Operation Northwoods. You'll be on ABC News. You both go to the
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:32.320]  Library of Congress, they have the copies of the plan. The government wanted to hijack
[1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:38.240]  jets, plumber, remote control, crash-jump, plane taxis, prevent attacks in D.C., sniper attacks,
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:44.640]  and blame it on political dissidents. The government has been hijacked. The government
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:52.400]  is run by criminals. The people inside here, some of them, have helped carry out attacks
[1:12:52.400 --> 1:13:00.080]  against Serbia, against Iraq. Millions are dead. They used to play uranium all over the world.
[1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:07.440]  They have committed absolutely amazing crimes. They have committed huge crimes.
[1:13:07.440 --> 1:13:12.640]  There is a global crime syndicate meeting right now inside that building.
[1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:19.280]  Parks, criminals, many of them that come to the events have a risk-warrant form and scores of
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:28.160]  nations. And they're all violating the Logan Act. Anyone in there meeting with federal officials
[1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:37.840]  to discuss policy without express authorization are engaging in crime, are engaging in very,
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:45.520]  very serious crimes. And everybody aiding on a betting medium are accessories to violating
[1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:52.560]  the Logan Act. Accessories to felons. Now, the cops out here on the edge, they don't really know
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:57.280]  what's going on. They're just on the block of roads. They're not violating the law. But the
[1:13:57.280 --> 1:14:04.960]  FBI, the diplomatic service of the State Department, are all violating federal law. And they
[1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:14.800]  show how well they are doing it. And I want to laugh about it. Hillary Clinton got fined not
[1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:22.160]  $100,000, not $200,000, but $300,000 for going to one of these and violating the Logan Act.
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:28.880]  Just couple, Hillary Logan Act, you can read the news articles from 10 years ago. This is
[1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:36.880]  it's funny. Felonies are being committed right now. You are guarding international criminals
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:44.880]  that are meeting in that building. International criminals violating the Logan Act and you are
[1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:55.280]  in there protecting them right now as they buy and sell our politicians.
[1:14:55.280 --> 1:14:59.280]  You know who came up with the European Union in 54, Bilderberg Group? You may be seeing those.
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:06.000]  You know who came up with the attack on Serbia? Bilderberg Group. Make sure you know. We forced
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:15.600]  it out. You know who put Bernanke in? These guys. That's what that seems like you don't know. We just
[1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:23.440]  got Bernanke. That was her. Chairman just pulled in. That little criminal. And they get better
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:38.880]  here with this. Goodbye. He is on the list. Bernanke is there and he just got him on camera.
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:45.520]  Yes. That was our chairman. The private bank that arms our country and is surpassing our currency
[1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:49.120]  so their private interest can buy it up. So he just came out according to Bill and I. I don't have a
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:16:03.760]  truth. But see, he's not federal so he can do it. He's not violating the Logan Act. He's a private
[1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:10.560]  bank chairman. The private bankers must love being able to get you all the currency and the
[1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:16.800]  union public here is federal and doesn't even know it's private. This country is owned and
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:29.280]  run by a murdering mafia. Bernanke! You are a criminal Bernanke! Bernanke! Stop destroying the
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:36.560]  courts are you criminal? You're not going to be able to stop Ron Paul whenever he questions you
[1:16:36.560 --> 1:16:41.920]  in the House Banking Committee you little crook. I'm going to call the Congressman once we can
[1:16:41.920 --> 1:16:47.600]  find you've been here. I'm going to send him video stills and maybe he'll pull him up on C-Span and
[1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:54.400]  I'll MSNBC and question why you are an international crime syndicate meeting. That's right. We'll have
[1:16:54.400 --> 1:17:04.000]  you started before the House Banking Committee you little dirtbag criminal! You are a criminal Bernanke!
[1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:10.720]  You are a disgusting, un-American piece of trash! You make me sick!
[1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:21.760]  Well there you have it folks. Alex Jones out in front of Chantilly, Virginia,
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:26.400]  the Marriott Hotel at the Bilderberg Group. They had to put out a press release because of all the
[1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:30.560]  press that he has brought attention to. I mean there was no way around it. They had to release
[1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:35.520]  this list because they knew it was going to be released anyway. It's just unbelievable. Wish we
[1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:41.520]  get Alex online to comment on some of the members on the list. The fact that Hillary Clinton and
[1:17:41.520 --> 1:17:47.200]  Obama magically met in DC on the first night. Isn't that great? They have their first little
[1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:53.120]  secret meeting and it just happens to be right where the Bilderberg Group is in DC. It's just a
[1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:58.800]  coincidence. I'm sure, right? There's no way that they were actually meeting with members of the
[1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:04.480]  Bilderberg Group like maybe Kissinger, who was a main advisor of the Bush administration, probably
[1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:10.960]  still is, behind the scenes of course. David Rockefeller, Buddy Buddy with George Pataki in 2006.
[1:18:10.960 --> 1:18:16.720]  You can watch that in Endgame. Makes me sick. Ben Bernanke, who was just being screened at
[1:18:16.720 --> 1:18:20.480]  head of the Federal Reserve right now, the chairman, destroying this country,
[1:18:20.480 --> 1:18:26.640]  bringing down the dollar, eviscerating the housing market. I mean, it's disgusting.
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:33.120]  And now they're putting out press releases, letting us know that they're our masters and
[1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:37.360]  they're going to meet in secret and it's a good thing. And that's why there's no press conference
[1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:42.080]  and that's why there's no coverage and that's why there's no open public forum for everybody to
[1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:46.560]  listen to what kind of policy they're trying to set because they're setting policy that is not
[1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:51.600]  good for us, that does not have our best interests at heart. In fact, probably our worst interest
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:55.760]  at heart. It's policy that's going to bring in the North American Union. It's policy that's going
[1:18:55.760 --> 1:19:01.280]  to turn this country into a second world nation. Aren't you worried? Aren't you upset? Aren't you
[1:19:01.280 --> 1:19:10.160]  outraged? I am. George Schultz, Richard Perle, Paul the Demon Wolfowitz. That's right. Assistant
[1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:15.920]  Secretary of Defense, Paul the Demon Wolfowitz. He's no good. He's garbage. Okay. It's total
[1:19:15.920 --> 1:19:24.160]  garbage. In fact, he did like a little speech, which who was in front of West Point? You will be
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:31.920]  surprised. Courage and surprise. New Pearl Harbor right before 9-11. Very, very, very interesting.
[1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:47.840]  It's the Alex Jones show. We'll be back after this. Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.com.
[1:19:51.200 --> 1:19:55.920]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes the

[1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:55.120]  Gold. It's like nothing else on earth. From the Romans through the Renaissance,
[1:20:55.120 --> 1:21:01.280]  from the industrial age to the space age, gold has weathered the test of time. For 6,000 years,
[1:21:01.280 --> 1:21:05.680]  gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth. According to the World Gold Council in the U.S.
[1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:11.280]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high. The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the
[1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:17.280]  common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day. Midas Resources is
[1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:22.000]  proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and

[1:21:51.120 --> 1:21:56.240]  It is now time to rein in evil and bring them to justice. Through the authority that has been
[1:21:56.240 --> 1:22:02.080]  delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers. The number of the mounted troops was 200
[1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:07.120]  million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S. Though the people of the U.S. where their
[1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:11.760]  numbers and influence are strongest have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing
[1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:17.040]  them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over. They are called
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:23.600]  Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order. They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:28.560]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built over the
[1:22:28.560 --> 1:22:33.200]  centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the
[1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:38.560]  masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind. We will undo through the authority that has now
[1:22:38.560 --> 1:22:49.520]  been delegated to us. Visit our website at UnveilingThem.com. That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G-Them.com, the message of his kingdom.

[1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:19.040]  on the local police. They sent out to Guard Bilderberg and the Marriott Hotel at Bilderberg.
[1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:23.680]  Write this very instant. You can go to the live stream at WeAreChange.org. While he's doing that,
[1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:28.320]  I'm going to take my first caller of the day. Let's go to Rocco in North Carolina. Rocco,
[1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:34.880]  are you with us? Hi, yes, I am. Hey, Jason, I had a quick question. You mentioned Morgan Reynolds.
[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:40.000]  I found some of his articles helpful, and I was surprised you had mentioned that you thought he
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:45.520]  might be an Asian because he was in a terastorm. What was the deal? Well, he didn't, but when they
[1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:50.080]  first cut that terastorm, he wasn't around talking about cartoon planes and space beams, man.
[1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:54.640]  He's totally changed. Yeah, absolutely. He went off the deep end with people like,
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:58.640]  you know, it's really funny because even some people in the movement get behind on this. I
[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:02.880]  remember the first time I met David Gray Griffin in his home. He did a lot of the
[1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:09.120]  fact checking on loose change, final cut, and he suggested we go and interview Judy Wood.
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:15.040]  And I said, Mr. Griffin, with all due respect, Judy Wood is talking about Kiebler Elves as the
[1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:20.320]  World Trade Center towers. And she's talking about space beams and no planes, sir. And he's like,
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:24.480]  really? And I'm like, yeah, you should see her last few articles from the last couple months.
[1:25:24.480 --> 1:25:29.120]  And he did. And he was like blown away and, you know, disassociated himself with her,
[1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:34.080]  which he should, you know, and Morgan Reynolds was another one of these guys that came out with
[1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:38.320]  pretty solid information, had been a member of the Bush administration. And then all of a sudden,
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:43.760]  he's talking about cartoon planes on Foxman. And that is, come on, give me a break. If there's
[1:25:43.760 --> 1:25:47.360]  anything that's going to discredit this 9-11 truth movement, it's cartoon planes, bro.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:51.840]  So there's been certain individuals like that that evidently were
[1:25:52.400 --> 1:25:57.360]  Yeah, they get on a new show. They get on a new show and they sound okay the first or second time.
[1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:00.560]  And then by the third or fourth time when they've made a name for themselves in this
[1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:05.120]  movement, all of a sudden they're off the bandwagon, man. And it's there to discredit us. It's there
[1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:09.520]  to make us look awful. And it's unfortunate because, you know, a lot of the information he does talk
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:14.400]  about in Terror Storm is real, but that's what Cointel Pro does. They give you about 80% good
[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:19.920]  information. And then the other 20% is there to pollute the water to, you know, put the turd in
[1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:24.320]  the punch bowl. Yeah, that's terrible. What happened to the individual that wrote the terror
[1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:30.480]  timeline, which inspired 9-11 press for truth? Paul Thompson? Yeah. He's still around. He just
[1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:35.920]  helped out, I think, in their own words documentary, a follow-up to the other one you were just
[1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:40.160]  discussing, press for truth. And he's still around. I see him every once in a while on an
[1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:44.800]  interview. I think that he helps update that cooperativeresearch.org website as well.
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:49.040]  But does he outright state state he believes is an inside document?
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:55.200]  He's one of those soft guys, man. I mean, obviously, I enjoy his work. It's a great tool to actually
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:27:01.920]  look into things. But at the same time, you know, we need people to stand up and just outright say
[1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:06.000]  the truth. And you know what? Like I was talking to Jesse Benton, we have to bring people in from
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:10.960]  different avenues. So I respect his decision to kind of stay on the fence and just report
[1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:15.600]  all that other stuff. But anybody with a half a brain that looks at this information knows right
[1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:20.240]  away that, you know, there's more going on. Right. I think with certain people, I mean,
[1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:24.240]  it took me some time, but I agree. But there's no evidence with him that that he's an agent or
[1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:28.320]  anything. No, no, no, no. You know what? I've met a lot of these, you know, quote unquote,
[1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:33.280]  lie hop guys. And I don't want to name any names with a couple guys that rub me the wrong way.
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:36.480]  For instance, but this is a couple years ago, they may have changed their position. I remember
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:41.520]  being outside of the Chicago event, the first real 911 truth event, and somebody was talking to me
[1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:45.280]  about the control demolition of one and two. And they were trying to tell me that it was mafia
[1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:50.080]  built and it was built under code. And I was just like, look, man, there's no way that the official
[1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:55.200]  version of now and the third official version, because first it was a pancake. Second, it was
[1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:59.040]  the steel melted and we're still waiting for the final report on seven, right? Yeah, absolutely.
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:04.160]  And then the third one was Oh, well, it was so hot in there was somewhere between 1500 and 1800
[1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:09.920]  degrees. So the steel weakened, it didn't melt. Now again, 1500 and 1800 degrees in the impact
[1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:14.720]  hole is impossible. Let me say it again, it is impossible. The firefighters two minutes before
[1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:18.960]  the building collapsed were in the impact hole. They said they could knock the fire down with two
[1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:24.080]  lines. Let me tell you something, human beings don't hang out in 1500 degree temperature. They
[1:28:24.080 --> 1:28:30.160]  don't hang out in half. You know, that's like going into a broiler. So these guys that say that,
[1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:35.360]  that that's the end all be all the evidence directly contradicts it. I still wonder what the
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:40.400]  final explanation by NIST will be for seven. It'll be fire. They didn't even look at some floors,
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:44.240]  man. All you had to do was listen in on that. I'm serious. All you had to do was listen in on
[1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:49.440]  that phone call where Richard Gage was actually lucky enough to get into that. And all the,
[1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:54.080]  all the regular guys, the guy, I think his name is Sondar or something or other for NIST. And he
[1:28:54.080 --> 1:28:59.440]  was the guy that told popular mechanics that 25% of the building was scooped out. Okay, that's the
[1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:04.240]  equivalent. Let me, let me explain that to people. This is a 47 story skyscraper. One fourth, very
[1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:11.840]  simple math is over 12 stories. That is its own large building. It is a own large steel structure.
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:16.320]  It's absolutely ludicrous. We have video and photographs that prove the contrary. Rocco,

[1:33:24.240 --> 1:33:30.400]  out in Chantilly, Virginia right now built Bullhorning Bilderberg remember Bernacke, Kissinger,
[1:33:30.400 --> 1:33:38.320]  Schultz, Perl, Wolfewitz, Rice, Rockefeller, Queen of the Netherlands, Queen of Spain
[1:33:38.880 --> 1:33:45.360]  and many many more had a Google is over there right now okay remember cyber terrorism is on
[1:33:45.360 --> 1:33:49.680]  the agenda this year they want to regulate that internet really really bad cyber terrorism
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:55.280]  what a joke is that going to be the next new fear mongering they're going to get our internet
[1:33:55.280 --> 1:34:01.280]  they're going to make us all terrorists all right let's keep taking calls let's go to John
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:08.480]  in Ohio Johnny with me yes uh you know these um Bilderbergers are all sharks but uh
[1:34:08.480 --> 1:34:17.280]  Wolfewitz, Perl, Rice uh as even Jim Tucker and others I've read on uh globalresearch.ca
[1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:24.160]  these are the uh mad dog sharks these are the rabbit sharks uh actually trying in the feeding
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:30.080]  frenzy to cut out the other sharks from the contracts uh in in Iran and Iraq that was the
[1:34:30.080 --> 1:34:34.800]  first thing after the uh invasion of Iraq that they did as they canceled the contracts that
[1:34:34.800 --> 1:34:39.920]  would have been put into effect as the support for those murderous sanctions were were lifted uh
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:45.360]  in Europe so I think what we've got to do and I really appreciated Alex uh not just simply
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:51.120]  talking about the existence and the meeting of Bilderberg but this split this apparent split for
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:57.520]  the first time because these guys are such mad dogs in this American section of the Bilderberg
[1:34:57.520 --> 1:35:03.120]  that they are going to bring the whole house down apparently with this uh mad war against uh
[1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:09.280]  Iran and I think that uh you know we we uh this is what is the burning screaming issue that should
[1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:16.480]  be shouted in bullhorn right now that we uh must avoid any kind of a world war provoking attack
[1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:20.960]  against Iran this is the issue they're discussing in there the whole issue is on the
[1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:26.560]  edge of the cliff teetering back and forth and I think that uh we we're here the the democrats
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:34.400]  the republicans Obama Hillary our total absolute uh uh unbended knee stooges for the Israeli
[1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:38.480]  war markers well what do you think of the fact that they're actually they actually had their
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:43.280]  secret meeting in dc last night uh on the night that the uh conference was kicked off
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:49.440]  there's something going on there but I'm I'm not uh I'm not going to rely on anything except
[1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:58.080]  total fealty by Obama Hillary and McCain towards a war with Iran um you know about Obama talks
[1:35:58.080 --> 1:36:03.840]  about we'll have a talk yeah talk uh to uh submit capitulate give up your your independence in any
[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:08.160]  country talks to and they say we can't do anything with them now we've got to bomb them there's no
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:14.000]  difference because they've all gone on pilgrimage isn't sacrosan abs at ashes to the apex lobby
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:18.880]  to pledge their fealty to any warmongering crime that israel wants to do itself or to
[1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:24.960]  or to uh as a junior partner with us there we can't rely on them all right john i i thank you
[1:36:24.960 --> 1:36:29.520]  for the call i gotta jump to the next caller but i'm with you and uh you know obviously these guys
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:34.480]  are are just puppets and uh you know obama sounds good he's a really good speaker hillary's not a
[1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:39.040]  bad speaker either they're both both very intelligent individuals but it's going to be more of the same
[1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:43.920]  and uh it's not good it's not good that they're meeting with the elites right now their little
[1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:49.440]  secret meeting last night i guarantee you builder burgers were indeed there let's go to kevin in
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:55.600]  canada kevin are you with us well how you doing good i just want to say um basically uh we're trying
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:00.960]  to uh fight the fight also out here um the few of us that have gone on to our few these international
[1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:06.160]  cast and uh we're trying to basically just do refeeds of alex jones and uh different ideas
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:10.640]  just sharing information i explained to people uh asking questions like when did you vote for this
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:14.000]  north american union you know we're trying to get them to see the obviousness of the situation
[1:37:14.640 --> 1:37:18.000]  and uh a guy in the group had a great idea he decided to have a little side call
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:23.440]  and he called until uh today and he asked to speak to david rockerfeller and he he got through
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:28.160]  and he actually just spoke to the gentleman and uh it's very scary when you talk to a 93 old gentleman
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:33.520]  that sounds so kind and nice because uh it was exactly what he sounded like uh he didn't make a
[1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:38.320]  fool of himself he asked them nice questions uh in a decent way i should say he didn't ask
[1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:44.240]  nice questions he's asking about uh you know the fact that uh you know you basically run the world
[1:37:44.240 --> 1:37:48.720]  and as many of us are worried about this and you know didn't misrepresent himself or anything like
[1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:53.840]  that and it's just amazing because uh now the media is covering it but it seems like he's very
[1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:58.480]  accessible well the thing is that the the veil has been pulled back and uh just the fact that they
[1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:02.080]  put out a press press release and they're acting like they've always put out a press release this
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:07.200]  is the first press release i've ever seen from the builder bear group but with increasing scrutiny
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:11.680]  with the fact that they've been on cnn international now that there have been numerous specials
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:16.720]  regarding the subject uh the fact that there's a couple hundred people that were outside of the
[1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:21.600]  hotel yesterday i think really pushed them into a corner to say all right what do we do now
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:25.760]  we can't just totally and completely black it out let's try to put some sort of a positive
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:30.240]  spin on this thing and they're like there will be no press conference this is all in private
[1:38:30.240 --> 1:38:35.440]  but it's for the good of humanity when in fact i i don't think it's for the good of humanity do you
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:39.600]  kevin well i truly i truly believe the press conference or the press release is somewhat to
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:43.920]  do with the phone call today actually um he had mentioned that uh there's two correspondents there
[1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:49.520]  uh didn't mention alex jones by name and jim talker but basically he started to seem like there's
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:53.520]  a little bit of pressure as he was going on when the world's a leader getting together and sharing
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:57.680]  ideas which is the way he he said it basically just said that they're just sharing ideas of course
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:02.160]  that's how they spun it in the uh press press release they're sharing ideas no policy set
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:06.640]  there total nonsense thanks for the call kevin let me break it down one more time all right
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:12.320]  this is 125 to 140 of some of the most powerful people in the world they will set an agenda this
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:18.480]  weekend and then this summer in another month uh as they've put some of the instruments into place
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:22.240]  they'll go to the bohemian grove the majority of these people and then they will disperse their
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:27.040]  agenda to others it's called compartmentalization everybody only gets to see a part of the picture
[1:39:27.040 --> 1:39:32.720]  and remember there's about 3000 attendees and guests at bohemian grove so they'll disperse
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:37.280]  their agenda to those elitists those lower level elitists that are there and then they'll disperse
[1:39:37.280 --> 1:39:44.320]  their agenda to their co-workers to their assistants to their uh business projects and so on to their
[1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:51.280]  defense contractors to their military industrial complex cronies all right let's jump to joe in

[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:16.800]  and read it i just thought that that was interesting all right um especially since we've uh i've heard
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:21.280]  at least on npr that oil prices were expected to come down but that's completely different from what
[1:40:21.280 --> 1:40:28.160]  i'm calling in for today um yesterday i found an article on yahoo finance it's under news and
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:33.440]  opinion it was kind of hidden and it talks about the bill bergen announcing a 2008 conference

[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:34.160]  businesses they're working for and the nations that they represent this is truly the upper echelons
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:40.480]  of the the elite both in europe and in this country in fact i'm sure i know i forwarded it
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:46.080]  to pertanimo before this radio broadcast so there should be stories with the list of the builder
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:51.920]  burgers over at info wars dot com and prism planet dot com sir okay one more thing and i'm going to go
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:58.240]  have do you guys have any opinion about um the new age and what they're going to do for the new age
[1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:04.000]  you know i mean they are press you know pushing this you know new religion type movement where
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.160]  they're trying to move people away from christianity and personally you know i'm not trying to
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:12.240]  disappoint all the listeners i don't act like i have all the answers i i don't subscribe to a
[1:42:12.240 --> 1:42:18.080]  certain religious philosophy but it does seem like they want to pull in this one world religion they
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:23.360]  love the kooky like ray aliens and what they do and all these different sex and nuts because they
[1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:28.160]  get to test things out from uh test things out on the number one and number two they get to
[1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:34.320]  acclimate pop pop culture and popular society to these ideas of separate religious organizations
[1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:38.320]  and really you know bring people away from the traditional uh religion of christianity in this
[1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:42.160]  country and those who are you know think they're true christians you know also think that george
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:47.680]  bush is a true christian probably at the bohemian grove and i used his tools by the 700 club and
[1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:52.080]  all these other guys and i'm sure at one point those very same preachers are going to push some
[1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:55.760]  sort of new religious movement you know after all they don't believe what they're preaching they
[1:42:55.760 --> 1:43:01.440]  believe in the almighty dollar and the elite they serve man okay all right very good all right thanks
[1:43:01.440 --> 1:43:06.960]  joe oh by the way oil rises more than seven dollars to new record high all right wow great
[1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:11.360]  thanks guys thanks man all right let's go to starvos in canada starvo so you're with me
[1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:17.920]  hello hey yes hey jason you're doing a great job on behalf of alex thank you you're very welcome
[1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:22.560]  i'm calling here from uh canada and i'd like to talk about a couple of things uh the first of
[1:43:22.560 --> 1:43:29.520]  which uh is a yahoo group which is called uh bush did 9 11 it is a phenomenal site it has a lot of
[1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:35.520]  links and uh free videos and books on it so we just search the yahoo groups uh bush did 9 11
[1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:42.560]  and you'll find it uh the second thing is about this north american union um people have to understand
[1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:48.960]  that this is a new political entity that's being created and when you have a new political entity
[1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:54.160]  being created the ones who are creating it are going to have a blank slate carte blanche
[1:43:54.160 --> 1:43:57.440]  to do whatever they want they're going to write whatever legislation they want
[1:43:57.440 --> 1:44:03.760]  and they're going to enforce it however they want so the constitution declaration of independence
[1:44:03.760 --> 1:44:08.240]  bill of rights are going to be totally wiped out throughout the window it's just like what
[1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:12.080]  they're doing with the e you it started with trade agreements now they're building a constitution
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:17.040]  it's all about eroding sovereignty it's all about bringing in a north american union with canada
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:23.520]  the united states and mexico at the helm yeah that's correct and uh also that's why uh the uh
[1:44:23.520 --> 1:44:29.200]  some toronto on 9 11 truth movement over here in canada is having a demonstration against that
[1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:35.840]  on june 14th between 1 and 4 p.m so people up here in uh in toronto or the greater toronto area
[1:44:35.840 --> 1:44:40.240]  can come out it's going to be at queen's park and we're going to have a large number of speakers
[1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:45.600]  demonstrating against us and uh publicly telling uh everybody why this is not a good idea and that
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:50.080]  this is very very dangerous excellent way to stay active star was i got to jump to the next
[1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:54.400]  caller that's what we all need to do we need to get active we need to you know organize these
[1:44:54.400 --> 1:44:58.880]  things we need to share information you know i'm one of those guys that likes to make videos i like
[1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:03.440]  you to take those videos make copies and hand them out to people to have screenings to show
[1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:08.320]  people this information to get active to become a luke ridowski i mean luke ridowski one of the
[1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:15.040]  most amazing human beings i've ever come across on this earth i mean a young guy getting out there
[1:45:15.040 --> 1:45:19.600]  with a bullhorn finding a way to shantilly virginia folks this guy's got a lot on his plate he's a
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:24.640]  young young person trying to go to college okay he's trying to defeat the globalists
[1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:31.120]  in their grand master plan to bring in what they like to call people like kissinger people
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:36.000]  like brown people like blare people like bush people like chainie they like to call it the new
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:42.400]  world order it is their term for it all right let's jump to art in kansas art are you with me
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:48.080]  hi jason how are you i wish you had your own show well you know i used to have my own show on gcm
[1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:53.120]  uh weekly i used to do five nights a week on and off it's awfully tough to keep up with and i don't
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:58.880]  have all this cool equipment myself the cool equipment makes the show just a little bit better
[1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:04.320]  uh-huh uh that list that bill the burger list i don't think that's gonna list everybody oh i
[1:46:04.320 --> 1:46:09.280]  know it is it's got all of them i guarantee i'll tell you what it doesn't have it'll probably have
[1:46:09.280 --> 1:46:14.640]  tenor well hold on it'll it'll probably won't have the tenor 15 guests that they're going to meet
[1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:19.360]  with in other locations right yeah i'm with you there and you know that's what i said uh in the
[1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:23.600]  past two days on the run up i said you know they're having this in chantilly virginia it gives them
[1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:31.360]  an awful great access to military insiders uh you know congressional insiders political insiders
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:36.080]  that normally wouldn't go and then last night the report comes out all over the mainstream media
[1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:41.520]  that hillary and obama have met and what are the chances they're meeting in dc no they're not on the
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:46.320]  list but read in between the lines folks there's a reason they're meeting in dc and it's because the
[1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:52.320]  billderberg conference is there how about michelle obama she's cfr she's absolutely cfr but so is
[1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:57.200]  obama i mean obama goes out there and says well i'm not cfr but have i spoke in front of them
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:02.400]  of course have i attended their meetings of course so he's a cfr as they get you know he's
[1:47:02.400 --> 1:47:07.840]  married to a member of the organization he speaks before the organization he attends conferences
[1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:12.160]  with the organization he knows damn well what the council on foreign relations is
[1:47:12.160 --> 1:47:17.440]  and it's just unfortunate that he's so charismatic and such a good speaker people are gonna be sold
[1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:22.800]  on this snake oil salesman in the same respect they were sold on clinton in the 90s because he
[1:47:22.800 --> 1:47:28.160]  carries himself well and we've had eight years of somebody who doesn't somebody who says dumb things
[1:47:28.160 --> 1:47:34.400]  of some people on somebody who's so uh publicly inept the argument is that him and his administration
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:39.520]  couldn't uh couldn't at all carry out 9-11 and i don't think bush could have but his administration
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:43.920]  parts of it you know people like wolf wits people like cheney people like rice people like rumsfeld
[1:47:43.920 --> 1:47:48.480]  you bet they could and his brothers oh absolutely jeb bush is a lot smarter than he is so is neil
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:53.600]  bush that's it you know i'm i'm with you i mean jeb bush declares martial law in the days before
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:48:00.240]  9-11 in florida knowing his brother is going to be in florida on 9-11 you know neil bush running
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:05.520]  security at dullas airport and the world trade center prior to 9-11 i mean what are the shot
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:10.000]  what are the chances right uh-huh yeah it's all it's all very mysterious to me but people you

[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:04.480]  turn it's just amazing out here it's like tropical ly hot though i'm at 100 percent humanity let's
[1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:08.320]  get your take on the fact that they put out a press release this year and they actually gave away
[1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:15.200]  the list well you see their jim zucker says and that's you're basically my take on it but he confers
[1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:22.080]  and concurs is that we've exposed them we've totally blown them wide open but the big issue is
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:27.840]  they put a press release out it has a way to say yeah we're public but then none of the newspapers
[1:55:27.840 --> 1:55:34.640]  our magazines will report on it and just a quick uh directive to curtain them on paul watchin and
[1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:38.960]  all them a lot of people are telling us they're emailing photos that they've taken videos still
[1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:44.080]  they've taken videos i need to get to make sure we scour through all the emails that are coming in
[1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:47.840]  maybe get into errands emails and others to make sure that we're getting all the photos up
[1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:53.920]  on prismplanet.com on info wars.com i don't have to tell people how important it is that the stories
[1:55:53.920 --> 1:55:58.080]  paul watchin has written and the curd have written need to be emailed out to everybody
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:03.440]  we're the only media here we're here covering it in 95 degree 100 percent humanity i'm not
[1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:06.800]  complaining i'm just saying we're out here really busting our butts to get this footage
[1:56:07.360 --> 1:56:12.880]  uh and we want everybody to uh you know really spread the word about what's happening out here
[1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:17.360]  and the developments uh that have been taking place and we also want everybody to think coast
[1:56:17.360 --> 1:56:22.160]  to coast stand because other than this radio show and genesis network which is on quite a few
[1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:27.440]  mfm stations obviously coast to coast is a lot bigger they have been having me on each night
[1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:31.760]  the last three nights it's not with the last night uh monday i mean tuesday wednesday and

[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:43.600]  and that has really given us a lot of protection because we had them pull a fire alarm on us
[1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:51.040]  we had them threaten to arrest us uh we had uh fpi guys come in diplomatic security services come in
[1:56:51.040 --> 1:56:55.360]  and uh and try to get us to say we're gonna do violent things they have announced themselves

[1:59:56.360 --> 2:00:13.880]  All right folks, we're out of the command center in Austin, Texas right now. Alex Jones
[2:00:13.880 --> 2:00:18.760]  is in Chantilly, Virginia. Builder, we're 2008. We just had him on the line. Do we have
[2:00:18.760 --> 2:00:34.000]  Philly 9-11 Truth with us right now? Yeah, this is Nick Carrangio of Philly 9-11 Truth.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:38.520]  Hey Jason, how you doing? Great man, why don't you give us an update on what's going down
[2:00:38.520 --> 2:00:39.520]  in Chantilly.
[2:00:39.520 --> 2:00:43.520]  All right, yeah, here at Ground Zero, Chantilly, Virginia with the Builderburg Conference. We
[2:00:43.520 --> 2:00:48.520]  just had a sighting of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. We went around to the front of the MassLarge,
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:52.880]  that method of, you know, organization, we were able to capture the Fed chair as he exited
[2:00:52.880 --> 2:00:58.160]  the Builderburg Conference. And Phil Figueroa is actually the fellow who captured it. He
[2:00:58.160 --> 2:01:01.360]  got a pretty exclusive shot, so I'm going to let him take it from here, what he thinks
[2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:02.360]  about it all.
[2:01:02.360 --> 2:01:03.360]  All right.
[2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:04.680]  Hey, buddy, Jason, how you doing?
[2:01:04.680 --> 2:01:05.680]  Great man, how are you?
[2:01:05.680 --> 2:01:12.000]  Good man, I'm Phil Figueroa from Philly 9-11 Truth and I was just, I was staying before.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:16.760]  I was staying behind. On the side entrance, everybody went to the front entrance and also
[2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:23.640]  when I see a police escort, there's two black, some of these in the back cars. And then I
[2:01:23.640 --> 2:01:29.320]  was just, I had my camera focus and then on the back seat of the first black car was Bernanke.
[2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:34.160]  And I was like, wow, it's Bernanke. I was like, whoa. And yeah, he was on his black
[2:01:34.160 --> 2:01:38.520]  very, and he had his tinted windows, like he had some, you know, real gall, like, just
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:39.520]  a man.
[2:01:39.520 --> 2:01:43.960]  Yeah, he's the guy who was killing our country through, you know, devaluing the currency.
[2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:44.960]  I mean,
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:48.480]  They're all blinging out. I mean, did you hear about the fact that the Department of
[2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:54.440]  Justice purchased 125 iPods to ship there with Bilderberg 2008? It's unbelievable.
[2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:55.440]  Unbelievable.
[2:01:55.440 --> 2:01:59.960]  Unbelievable. I have public money. I mean, that's nuts. But him being here and him showing
[2:01:59.960 --> 2:02:03.160]  his face, I mean, he has a police escort. You think, you know, he's working for the
[2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:07.880]  government, but no, he's, you know, working for the private federal reserve. And, you
[2:02:07.880 --> 2:02:11.520]  know, he just shows where his true allegiances are. And that's to the international bankers,
[2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:14.080]  you know, that runs this country and the world.
[2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:18.280]  So, I mean, it's real bad. And he doesn't even, like, he just has a gall, no tinted
[2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:23.040]  windows. I mean, yesterday we saw a bunch of people, they're, you know, cowards, you
[2:02:23.040 --> 2:02:26.760]  know, with their tinted windows and they're having their, their coats cut on the hangers
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:31.120]  in the back, covering their faces. We're in the newspaper, but not this guy. I mean,
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:35.040]  I don't know if he got, got worried that most of us were in the front.
[2:02:35.040 --> 2:02:40.720]  I think that's what it was. And then yeah, I was, I was with some guys from AFP. And
[2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:46.320]  I think they got some good shots of him too. But, um, yeah, that was it. It was, it was
[2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:47.320]  not.
[2:02:47.320 --> 2:02:51.680]  Yeah, man. It's pretty incredible. The turnout there, you know, yesterday I saw a bunch of
[2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:57.120]  people there. I saw like 25 people there while Alex was bullhorning right now. The live stream
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:03.000]  is back up over at we are change.org. You can see Luke Radowski and Rob Jacobson outside
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:07.640]  of outside of the Bilderberg meeting and his sweltering heat. And it's just so good to
[2:03:07.640 --> 2:03:12.240]  know that we have at least pushed the mainstream media into admitting that there is a Bilderberg
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:16.880]  conference, that it is secret. They're admitting that it, it's, it's secret, but it's, it's
[2:03:16.880 --> 2:03:21.880]  also there can be open and candid about our enslavement and not have to have any repercussions
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:25.800]  whatsoever. Why don't you speak to that, the privacy of this meeting and the fact that,
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:29.680]  you know, there's little to no chance that any of the, the policy that's discussed will
[2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:31.280]  come out in an open forum.
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:38.080]  Yeah, it's, it's really unbelievable. I mean, I guess we are changed. Got, got a video of
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:40.560]  Bill Clinton that you were talking about the other day. I was, I was listening to you and
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:45.200]  you were saying, you know, how he basically admitted that they, that they were negotiating
[2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:50.320]  NATO policy before he got to the Bilderberg meeting, you know, and by the way, the head
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:56.400]  of NATO security is there right now. He is on the list. Of course he is. You know, and
[2:03:56.400 --> 2:04:01.520]  Jim, and Jim Tucker actually, I guess he got a press release from Newswire. That's like
[2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:05.520]  on press, like they don't usually do that type of stuff. And they had businesswire.com,
[2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:09.200]  businesswire.com. Yeah. They had this press release and it's just unbelievable. They talk
[2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:13.240]  about how they're going to be talking about a nuclear free world, cyberterrorism, Africa,
[2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:14.240]  Russia.
[2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:17.120]  Yeah, cyberterrorism. Exactly. They're, they're, they're confronting us now.
[2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:21.640]  Yeah. Yeah. We're the cyber terrorists because we're the ones reporting this in a live and
[2:04:21.640 --> 2:04:26.120]  open forum to the world. We're doing the journalist job. Unfortunately,
[2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:31.200]  the people that control the journalists are inside that very meeting right now. This is
[2:04:31.200 --> 2:04:36.120]  the Alex Jones show. We will be back after these messages, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.

[2:08:09.800 --> 2:08:15.320]  We are going to be posting some of that over at Infowars.com and PrismPlanet.com. Do I
[2:08:15.320 --> 2:08:20.040]  still have Philly 9-11 Truth with me? Yeah, definitely. Yes, Phil here. So you guys have
[2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:24.560]  done some pretty amazing work outside of this. One of the ones that stands out in my mind
[2:08:24.560 --> 2:08:28.760]  is your Bob Graham confrontation. Oh, that was great. Yeah, Nick got them on that real
[2:08:28.760 --> 2:08:33.840]  good. I wish you guys would send that to us. I'd love to put that in my new film. I talk
[2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:38.840]  a lot about the connection between the ISI, Bob Graham, Porter Goss. I'm going to be
[2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:46.240]  back. Yeah, that was great. That was my only criticism of Loose Change. The new one was
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:51.040]  that it didn't go into that aspect more. But there was only so much you could put in there.
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:56.520]  Yeah, exactly. It's a two hour plus movie. I'm glad to hear you're making another one
[2:08:56.520 --> 2:09:01.120]  though. That's good. Yeah, well we're trying to go into how this was financed, how it was
[2:09:01.120 --> 2:09:05.440]  carried out, who were the patsies, what role did everybody play because obviously there
[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:11.960]  was a lot of compartmentalization going on. And that's what the Pakistani ISI was there
[2:09:11.960 --> 2:09:17.520]  to do. They were there to fund the hijackers through our allies to cause plausible deniability
[2:09:17.520 --> 2:09:22.720]  between our intelligence agencies and theirs. Yeah, let me put Nick on so we can talk about
[2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:28.600]  the Bob Graham confrontation. Absolutely. All right, here he is. Yeah, well, quick run
[2:09:28.600 --> 2:09:33.360]  through the Bob Graham confrontation. Besides challenging him about several of the 9-11
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:37.160]  whistleblowers, of course, we brought up Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer and Stabella Edmonds,
[2:09:37.160 --> 2:09:42.320]  which he denied any knowledge of. Specifically, we brought up the issue that he received pre-9-11
[2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:48.040]  intelligence about R.G. Abbas, a supposed operative of Osama bin Laden. That was the
[2:09:48.040 --> 2:09:52.840]  Randy Glass information? Right, Randy Glass, who basically was working as an undercover
[2:09:52.840 --> 2:09:58.760]  arms salesman with the ATF. Yeah, there was even an MSNBC special on the whole entire
[2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:03.280]  thing. Yeah, the story should have gone supernova in the mainstream media.
[2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:09.360]  Obviously, we know how they're killed very quickly. So I challenge Senator Bob Graham
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:13.720]  because he's the one. He's another Florida senator. I can't remember his name. Porter
[2:10:13.720 --> 2:10:18.000]  Goss. And they were both meeting with the head of the ISI and they are the co-chairs
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:21.840]  of the initial congressional investigation. A lot of people don't know that the lead Democrat
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:26.480]  on that was also Nancy Pelosi. So you can't expect her to want to reinvestigate 9-11 when
[2:10:26.480 --> 2:10:32.600]  she was part of the original congressional coverup where 27 pages were redacted. Definitely.
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:38.800]  But here's the thing, Randy Glass had more than just paper transactions. He sent communicates,
[2:10:38.800 --> 2:10:43.760]  but also he met with Graham in person and he has the wire, the video actually, of that
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:48.400]  conversation. So I mean, that's in his back pocket. I don't know if and when Randy Glass
[2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:52.400]  will release that. Well, I hope he does. I mean, we were already waiting almost seven
[2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:56.920]  years for the truth. I mean, that may be the only security. I mean, it's difficult to think.
[2:10:56.920 --> 2:11:00.480]  Yeah, you know, I don't want to come down on people. I don't know the entire situation.
[2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:06.840]  But yeah, in challenging Graham on that issue, it's like he bring it up that he received
[2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:11.760]  the pre 9-11 infill that RG boss is plotting to, you know, destroy the World Trade Centers.
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:16.600]  And again and again, you have Glass pleading with them saying, are you, what are you doing
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:22.240]  to follow up with this information? And his staffer Charlie yawns, affirms that, yes,
[2:11:22.240 --> 2:11:27.640]  the senator is taking action. And then a few months later, 9-11 transpires. And ever since
[2:11:27.640 --> 2:11:34.680]  then, Graham has denied ever receiving Glass prior to the September 11. Eventually he did
[2:11:34.680 --> 2:11:39.040]  say that he received them after the attacks. But now he's even rescinded that completely.
[2:11:39.040 --> 2:11:43.560]  He denied any knowledge whatsoever of Randy Glass or that issue. Absolutely. He asked
[2:11:43.560 --> 2:11:48.040]  to deny it because once he says that he knows about it, he becomes a little bit more criminally
[2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:54.000]  culpable. And he's obviously hiding a lot. Right. He's a total, he's a total shield for
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:58.120]  the September 11 criminals, whatever they may be. One of the more apologetic shields
[2:11:58.120 --> 2:12:00.880]  I'll give him that. So what's the plan for tonight?
[2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:04.480]  I'll give you what the, well, real quick, yeah, another, another apologetic show we
[2:12:04.480 --> 2:12:10.960]  just got friggin, um, um, Richard, yeah, Richard A. Clark, excuse me. We just got him the other
[2:12:10.960 --> 2:12:17.240]  day. We brought up W1999, the internal memorandum that was circulating within the FBI and CIA.
[2:12:17.240 --> 2:12:22.880]  Mufaz bin Laden, the, the, the, the, the, the, the calling agents off of whammy, the
[2:12:22.880 --> 2:12:29.880]  world assembly of Muslim youth. And, uh, eventually used, uh, again, up until 2001 to basically
[2:12:29.880 --> 2:12:34.640]  stop the investigations, like what we saw with Colleen Rowley, Robert Wright, uh, Harry
[2:12:34.640 --> 2:12:39.880]  Salmon, all these investigations getting killed. It's part of the W1999 issue. Uh, Greg Palace,
[2:12:39.880 --> 2:12:43.640]  of course, did the research into that. He has the document. He's only given about two pages
[2:12:43.640 --> 2:12:48.200]  from what I can see on the internet. But what we do know of it, it's pretty much, it's conducive
[2:12:48.200 --> 2:12:53.160]  to the whole September 11th conspiracy, of course. Um, so we can't, we can, he denied any knowledge,
[2:12:53.160 --> 2:12:58.960]  whatsoever, the W1999 issue. He also denied any knowledge whatsoever of Stabell Edmund,
[2:12:58.960 --> 2:13:03.200]  although he was, uh, you know, the terrorism star at that point in time in 2002. So he's,
[2:13:03.200 --> 2:13:06.640]  he's obviously, although he's the one that said, we failed you and he takes the onus
[2:13:06.640 --> 2:13:12.040]  on himself and sort of play case and, you know, ossifies the, the, the families in general
[2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:17.120]  public. Yeah. He's a total, he's a total, uh, show yet again. And, um, we have to, we
[2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:21.080]  have to keep the pressure on him and he's on tour with his new book, your government failed
[2:13:21.080 --> 2:13:25.040]  you. You hear that folks? You want to get involved? You want to be part of the media?
[2:13:25.040 --> 2:13:29.800]  Go to his book signing. Ask him a tough question. Just go, go on to Google right now and just
[2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:34.240]  type book signing and you will find Richard Clark. You will find Richard Haas. You will
[2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:38.680]  find all, all of these criminal elitists that we're seeing today here at the Bilderberg
[2:13:38.680 --> 2:13:42.640]  conference. Didn't see those two former ones I mentioned, but you certainly are seeing
[2:13:42.640 --> 2:13:47.520]  enough. I mean, there's, there's sketchy reports of, of, uh, Paul Wolfowitz. No, Wolfowitz
[2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:51.640]  is there. He's on the list. Wolfowitz is there. Condoleezza Rice is there.
[2:13:51.640 --> 2:13:55.840]  I haven't read the list out of yet, but what we, what we did see yesterday was definitely
[2:13:55.840 --> 2:14:01.560]  heavy guards armed entourage police escorts. Um, and would look to, look to be, because
[2:14:01.560 --> 2:14:05.720]  one of them was purportedly holding a desert eagle, which you cannot, you know, possess
[2:14:05.720 --> 2:14:11.600]  in the United States from what I understand. Israeli or Mossad connection, most likely.
[2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:15.040]  So what are the, what are the plans for tonight? What are you guys doing this evening at the
[2:14:15.040 --> 2:14:17.240]  Bilderberg conference? We're going to be, we're going to be here until 10 o'clock. I encourage
[2:14:17.240 --> 2:14:23.880]  every single person that's in the 100, um, let's say 400 miles and make the drive, make
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:26.880]  the drive, come out here, take the flight. If you have to, we're going to be here until
[2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:30.240]  Sunday. They're going to be leaving. And of course we're going to catch them, you know,
[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:31.880]  scaring away back to their whatever.
[2:14:31.880 --> 2:14:36.680]  Like the cockroaches they are. All right, man. I thank you guys for the call on the update.
[2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:40.640]  I'm going to jump to some other callers, but uh, you'll keep, keep us updated and keep
[2:14:40.640 --> 2:14:44.920]  up the great work out here. We'll have more chores a week in proceeds. All right. Thank

[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:48.560]  about how they are rationing food in some stores in New York. This is a serious matter.
[2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:53.000]  You can only get three bags of rice over at Sam's club and over at BJ's. This is tragic.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  I can't believe I live in a country now where I can't get everything I need for purchase
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:00.720]  rationing food. Think about that. It's really scary. So go to eFoods Direct. The only sure
[2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:04.560]  thing about the future is that there is no sure thing. Storing food for your family is
[2:16:04.560 --> 2:16:08.880]  one of the most prudent actions you can take. No one knows what counter will affect the

[2:16:35.880 --> 2:16:40.200]  in this segment to take some callers. Remember Daniel Estalon will be on at half past the
[2:16:40.200 --> 2:16:43.440]  hour. We're going to talk about these Bilderberg developments, the fact they put out a press
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:47.960]  release, the fact that the attendee list is there. What he thinks is now on the agenda
[2:16:47.960 --> 2:16:53.800]  with that attendee list leaking all the latest stories over at infowars.com right now. Let's
[2:16:53.800 --> 2:17:02.240]  jump to John in Missouri. Let's go to Chris in Florida. Chris, are you with me?
[2:17:02.240 --> 2:17:06.480]  Yes, in a few seconds. Okay. Are you with me?
[2:17:06.480 --> 2:17:07.480]  Yes.
[2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:13.560]  Okay. Good job. I just want to let you know that you're getting better. I want to make
[2:17:13.560 --> 2:17:19.560]  sure that you know that you're getting better. And I want to make sure that somebody lets
[2:17:19.560 --> 2:17:25.360]  you know that. All right. But I wanted to, on a lighter note, let you know that something
[2:17:25.360 --> 2:17:33.760]  that these talk show hosts do, do have Freudian flips, you could say, O'Reilly had on his
[2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:40.200]  show a little while ago, a couple weeks ago. I saw him where he was mentioning that 20
[2:17:40.200 --> 2:17:45.200]  of you on YouTube is surfaced where he was very angry 20 years ago.
[2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:47.200]  Well, I watched it on Inside Edition.
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:50.800]  I think you were swearing and all that. And he said he would show it on his show, but
[2:17:50.800 --> 2:17:59.360]  he can't due to contractual agreement. And it's a kind of flip-flop.
[2:17:59.360 --> 2:18:05.400]  One let you know, you know, that this rate and empire is so easily discredited. And I
[2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:10.760]  want to encourage people to call talk shows more often because there are so many of us
[2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:16.040]  in such few of them. And it's so easy to get through them on these talk shows that we can
[2:18:16.040 --> 2:18:20.560]  easily discredit these propaganda and bring them to justice more quickly.
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:27.600]  Well, that is the Mark Dice model. And I want to also bring your attention to something
[2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:34.280]  that I think is very widely ignored. And that's that. In the LA Times about two or three weeks
[2:18:34.280 --> 2:18:38.800]  ago, if you want to look at Babylon and beyond, I don't know if you've seen that Major General
[2:18:38.800 --> 2:18:46.520]  Kevin Berger have reported that out of 20,000 pieces of ammunition and inordinates and that
[2:18:46.520 --> 2:18:51.280]  kind of thing, nothing had been identified as coming from Iran.
[2:18:51.280 --> 2:18:52.280]  Had you seen that?
[2:18:52.280 --> 2:18:56.440]  No, I haven't. But, you know, they're trying to set up Iran. There's no doubt about it.
[2:18:56.440 --> 2:19:00.040]  In my mind, although Estalon may disagree, we got to let you go. Your phone connection
[2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:05.280]  is just awful. And it's clicking in and out. That's all right. Let's jump to another phone
[2:19:05.280 --> 2:19:09.160]  call. Let's go to Joe and Edmonton. Joe, you with me?
[2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:15.320]  Hi. Am I on the air? Yes, you are. Okay. Hi, Jason. Thanks for taking my call. Two
[2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:23.880]  things here. I got one of these criminal scumbag leak coming to my city coming to the Shaw

[2:24:01.400 --> 2:24:07.200]  Alright folks, we're back at the Alex Jones show. Builder 2008. This is the top of the
[2:24:07.200 --> 2:24:10.200]  online coverage. The coverage are going to get nowhere else. This is where we tell you
[2:24:10.200 --> 2:24:17.080]  who's there, why they're there. We have live reports from there, which nobody else has.
[2:24:17.080 --> 2:24:21.280]  And if you go to wearchange.org right now, you'll see Rob Jacobson, one of the great
[2:24:21.280 --> 2:24:26.600]  employees over here at infowars.com, responsible for a lot of the editing of Alex Jones's great
[2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:31.360]  films including 9-11 Truth Rising, the 9-11 Chronicles coming up. I think we're going
[2:24:31.360 --> 2:24:35.160]  to be releasing that on the net on July 4th. It's very exciting. The DVD is being mastered
[2:24:35.160 --> 2:24:41.240]  as we speak. And Rob is just a great person, great patriot. And we hope to hear from Alex
[2:24:41.240 --> 2:24:44.560]  Jones at the bottom of the hour. Hopefully we'll have Estalon in the next segment. We'll
[2:24:44.560 --> 2:24:48.120]  see what happens. But right now we're talking to Joe at Edmonton and he's talking about
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:53.960]  telling people to confront some of these scums. So who's coming to your town?
[2:24:53.960 --> 2:25:02.920]  Okay. Hang on to the seat of your pants here, Jason, because this piece of garbage, this
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:08.840]  pathetic piece of dog vomit, the kindest words that I can find for this clown, William Jefferson
[2:25:08.840 --> 2:25:15.720]  Clinton, 42nd President of the United States. Come here to Edmonton. He's going to be speaking
[2:25:15.720 --> 2:25:21.080]  here in Edmonton, Alberta at the Shaw Conference Center. Two weeks from today on the 20th of
[2:25:21.080 --> 2:25:30.120]  June from 12 o'clock noon to 1.30, then he travels 200 miles south to Calgary to speak
[2:25:30.120 --> 2:25:38.720]  in Calgary. I don't know where about what venue in Calgary, but likely... But anyway...
[2:25:38.720 --> 2:25:42.480]  Well, the bottom line is we need some truth squads out there. We need some tough questions
[2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:46.600]  asked. He was just confronted on Bilderberg yet again and he was asked, why isn't the
[2:25:46.600 --> 2:25:51.120]  media at Bilderberg? And he just, I don't know, I haven't been there in 15 years. I suspect
[2:25:51.120 --> 2:25:56.040]  he's been there sooner than 15 years ago. And I'll denial denial. Absolutely. And his
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:26:01.080]  wife... A lot of these big political celebrities talk. I'll tell you right now, his wife probably
[2:26:01.080 --> 2:26:05.420]  met with Bilderberg's last night. There's no way it's a coincidence that her and Obama
[2:26:05.420 --> 2:26:10.960]  get together for their first meeting after she says that she's out of the race in DC
[2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:15.640]  on the night the Bilderberg conference starts. Give me a break. That's like lightning striking
[2:26:15.640 --> 2:26:21.240]  five times in the same place. Also too, Jason, can I just weigh in with one more quick comment
[2:26:21.240 --> 2:26:27.520]  that I'll go here? Right here, up in my neck of the woods, here in Alberta, we have been
[2:26:27.520 --> 2:26:35.920]  basking in an economic boom thanks to the high price of oil over the past few years.
[2:26:35.920 --> 2:26:43.240]  And for me, it really frustrates me personally trying to wake up a brain dead Alberta citizenry
[2:26:43.240 --> 2:26:49.240]  who, you know, they got to think, what can I... I don't know really where to start.
[2:26:49.240 --> 2:26:54.800]  Well, let me tell you what you can do, man. You've got to just get information that you
[2:26:54.800 --> 2:26:58.040]  know you want to share with people. People don't read much anymore. Unless you sit them
[2:26:58.040 --> 2:27:02.560]  down and you put them in front of a television, they're God, okay? They're not going to buy
[2:27:02.560 --> 2:27:06.600]  into it. And that's why you need to get copies of these movies. You can download them for
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:09.560]  free if you can't afford them. We encourage you to make copies. But you've got to make
[2:27:09.560 --> 2:27:13.200]  it fun. You've got to say, oh, let's have a dinner party. Invite five of your friends
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:17.200]  and maybe sit them down and just say, oh, you know, let's throw this in and see what happens.
[2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:20.480]  Maybe play some cards while you're watching it. You're going to catch someone's interest.
[2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:24.280]  You know, you've got to bring it in in a positive light. And you know, I know it's not the easiest
[2:27:24.280 --> 2:27:29.440]  thing in the world. I've been doing it now for six years. And it's tough waking people
[2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:33.400]  up. But slowly but surely, I've gotten a lot of people to come around, my friends, my family,
[2:27:33.400 --> 2:27:37.760]  the people most important to me, complete strangers. I mean, we need to share this information.
[2:27:37.760 --> 2:27:42.160]  We need this info war to get into the next year. I thank you for the call, Joe. Let's
[2:27:42.160 --> 2:27:48.600]  go to Leaf in New York City. Leaf, are you with us? Hey, Jay, how you doing? Good man.
[2:27:48.600 --> 2:27:54.760]  How are you? I'm good. Before you mentioned something about the New World religion. Sure.
[2:27:54.760 --> 2:27:59.800]  I wanted to give you a heads up as to what exactly that was. I work in downtown New York
[2:27:59.800 --> 2:28:04.360]  and about a block from where I work is an organization called Lucius Trust. They have
[2:28:04.360 --> 2:28:09.160]  heard of them. Of course. They were started as the Lucifer Trust in the 1920s by Alipay
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:14.120]  Bailey. I actually went there because I saw their name so many times. It's a really weird
[2:28:14.120 --> 2:28:19.200]  place. The place does not look like it belongs on Wall Street where it is. It used to be
[2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:24.520]  the Lucifer Trust, by the way, for those that don't know. Yeah. And I got a bunch of pamphlets
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:29.680]  from there. A lot of the titles are things like the new group of world servers, the new
[2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:35.880]  world religion, the reappearance of Christ, things on meditating together with two other
[2:28:35.880 --> 2:28:39.960]  people to create these things called triangles. And the thing that really set me off about
[2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:44.960]  them was they recently had their conference in New York, and they have three major festivals
[2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:50.240]  every year. One's in New York, one's in London, and one's in Geneva. What kind of religious
[2:28:50.240 --> 2:28:56.480]  organization meets in the financial capitals of the world? I mean, it's just ridiculous,
[2:28:56.480 --> 2:29:02.280]  and it's a really strange place. And they are occultists. It's an occult, esoteric mystery
[2:29:02.280 --> 2:29:08.160]  school. They straight up say that they are, in fact, part of the United Nations. They
[2:29:08.160 --> 2:29:10.760]  have United Nations stuff all over the inside of their office.
[2:29:10.760 --> 2:29:14.720]  Oh, they're totally one worlders, man, and you're dead on, man. They're pagans. They're
[2:29:14.720 --> 2:29:18.400]  into this Luciferian religion. It's do as thou wilt, and they're trying to usher it
[2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:22.440]  in. They're trying to break down society. I thank you for the call, Leif. Hopefully,
[2:29:22.440 --> 2:29:25.960]  we'll have Escalon on the other side. If we don't, we'll be taken. More calls. Alex will
[2:29:25.960 --> 2:29:30.680]  be calling in at the bottom of the hour. And remember, we got Hot Ass Amy Allen, MTV's
[2:29:30.680 --> 2:29:35.920]  Amy Allen coming in for the final hour. This is the Alex Jones show. I'm Jason Bermas,
[2:29:35.920 --> 2:29:44.920]  PrismPlanet.com. We're on the march, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN

[2:29:50.280 --> 2:29:56.880]  shampoo, soap, or detergent? How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes,
[2:29:56.880 --> 2:30:01.920]  and more? Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients.
[2:30:01.920 --> 2:30:06.240]  Most of which are synthetic. Hi, this is Alex Jones. I was shocked when I discovered I could
[2:30:06.240 --> 2:30:10.640]  be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath,
[2:30:10.640 --> 2:30:15.040]  headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes. Now, compare a cowbell

[2:30:55.560 --> 2:31:01.480]  dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Bilderberg, but they're
[2:31:01.480 --> 2:31:07.560]  objected to be world domination. For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they
[2:31:07.560 --> 2:31:13.800]  hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[2:31:13.800 --> 2:31:21.360]  is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is
[2:31:21.360 --> 2:31:26.880]  blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:31:26.880 --> 2:31:30.520]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea.
[2:31:30.520 --> 2:31:33.640]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's

[2:33:29.640 --> 2:33:34.520]  one of the best 9-11 Truth organizations locally that I know of. They keep pumping out the
[2:33:34.520 --> 2:33:41.120]  hits. If you want to make a difference, TruthAction.org, WeRChange.org. In fact, let's go to the
[2:33:41.120 --> 2:33:47.040]  live WeRChange feed. As soon as I'm going to hit the button, it's not broadcast. Literally
[2:33:47.040 --> 2:33:53.880]  my fingers on the button, and they cut the broadcast. Unbelievable. It's live radio folks,
[2:33:53.880 --> 2:33:58.320]  so you move along to get along. Remember, coming up in a half an hour, we did confirm
[2:33:58.320 --> 2:34:03.080]  we are going to have Amy Allen. That means I'm going to play a little Ron Paul Revolution
[2:34:03.080 --> 2:34:09.840]  song for you. It's Top Notch, kids. I hope you enjoy. Let's go to Leon in Texas. Leon,
[2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:16.320]  you're on the air live. Howdy. I was listening to you guys talking about the collapse of
[2:34:16.320 --> 2:34:24.360]  the Twin Towers yesterday. I think there's a clue that you have overlooked. Let's hear
[2:34:24.360 --> 2:34:32.840]  it. Well, before these things fell down, there
[2:34:32.840 --> 2:34:39.120]  was a bunch of New York Police Department helicopters circling them. Sure. They give
[2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:45.440]  off that little flash right before the tower goes down. They were trying to assess the
[2:34:45.440 --> 2:34:53.720]  possibility of evacuating people, and they decided that it was impractical. In the meantime,
[2:34:53.720 --> 2:35:11.280]  they took video tapes of the floors where the airliners struck. These video tapes are
[2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:15.760]  pretty striking. Are we talking about the video tapes of the woman in the impact zone
[2:35:15.760 --> 2:35:22.720]  waving and that sort of thing? No, no. She was on a different floor. What we're talking
[2:35:22.720 --> 2:35:28.360]  about is that they're looking straight. They got their video cam pointed straight into
[2:35:28.360 --> 2:35:37.360]  the impact floor, and it's quite hot in there. I mean, it's not like diesel fuel hot. It's
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:42.960]  quite hot. Where is this video? I've never seen it.
[2:35:42.960 --> 2:35:47.640]  Well, I've seen stills from it. Well, where can I find this stuff? Because I've never
[2:35:47.640 --> 2:35:53.280]  seen any of this stuff. White hot, huh? Again, I've seen just about everything. I've gone
[2:35:53.280 --> 2:35:59.600]  through every live news feed from that day until 9.13. That's available from ADC to
[2:35:59.600 --> 2:36:03.880]  CDN. Still from one of the major books on the 9.11 thing.
[2:36:03.880 --> 2:36:09.800]  Well, I would say send it out to erinainfulwars.com or get at me at jasonatloose.com.
[2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:14.480]  Now, wait a minute. Now, check it out. Wait a minute. Now, you might think this would
[2:36:14.480 --> 2:36:26.480]  prove that there was a thermite or something like that on that floor. But I don't think
[2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:27.480]  it does.
[2:36:27.480 --> 2:36:31.440]  Well, again, I can't really comment because I haven't seen the pictures. Obviously, you
[2:36:31.440 --> 2:36:36.440]  think the official version is what happened when we see the Scribs go on 20 and 40, 60
[2:36:36.440 --> 2:36:41.120]  floors below the impact. We have molten metal that is unexplainable, and we have people inside
[2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:45.160]  that impact hole two minutes before the towers actually collapse, and that's confirmed by
[2:36:45.160 --> 2:36:49.040]  the NYFD. They say they can knock it down with two hand lines.
[2:36:49.040 --> 2:36:57.320]  The body of the plane itself is 110 tons of aluminum. If that burns, it's like burning
[2:36:57.320 --> 2:37:00.280]  300 tons of coal on one floor.
[2:37:00.280 --> 2:37:04.400]  Once again, they're in the impact hole. There's no doubt about it. They're in the impact hole.
[2:37:04.400 --> 2:37:08.720]  They're up there. They're in the, I think it was like the 72nd, 73rd floor, and they
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:13.000]  say they can knock the fires out with two hand lines. You can't survive in white hot
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:14.640]  heat if you're a human being.
[2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:16.440]  Those people weren't talking from there.
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:17.440]  Yes, they were.
[2:37:17.440 --> 2:37:19.360]  They were talking from the middle lobby.
[2:37:19.360 --> 2:37:23.560]  Sorry. Sorry, you're wrong. They're on that floor. It's in loose chain, second edition.
[2:37:23.560 --> 2:37:27.040]  It's confirmed. Go check it out for yourself. I'm going to let you go because you've got
[2:37:27.040 --> 2:37:31.320]  a lot of misinformation, man. They're in the impact zone. They're not in the lobby. Come
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:34.920]  on, the lobby.
[2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:37.440]  You can knock out little fires with a little hand line.
[2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:40.720]  Well, yeah. Well, because it was a little fire. They're in the impact zone.
[2:37:40.720 --> 2:37:44.480]  It's not a little fire where the fire actually hit.
[2:37:44.480 --> 2:37:49.320]  I gave you your little soapbox. Send me the pictures. I'll take a look at it. I think it's
[2:37:49.320 --> 2:37:54.160]  nonsense. Again, these people are in the impact zone. Let's jump to Mark in Georgia. Mark,
[2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:55.160]  are you with us?
[2:37:55.160 --> 2:37:57.440]  Yes, I am. God bless you, sir.
[2:37:57.440 --> 2:37:58.440]  Thank you.
[2:37:58.440 --> 2:38:05.560]  Let's see. First, for those that, I appreciate Alex's view that we don't want to get into
[2:38:05.560 --> 2:38:08.880]  a bunch of religious dogmatism. Like I like to say, if you love me as your brother in
[2:38:08.880 --> 2:38:13.600]  Christ, please show me where I'm wrong. We're all wrong about something. Do you love Jesus
[2:38:13.600 --> 2:38:15.720]  dot org letter U?
[2:38:15.720 --> 2:38:20.120]  I read this book about a year ago called The Synagogue of Satan. I've dealt with people
[2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:24.760]  who, you know, it's like, I think you're a sycophant, and if you thought I was paying
[2:38:24.760 --> 2:38:30.680]  him a compliment, as a no, you don't understand. You're not engaging your brain. That's what
[2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:35.040]  I'm saying, huh? That's what sycophant means as a person who accepts things at face value
[2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:39.760]  without checking them out. And that, you know, it's like, the thing is, this book is spelled
[2:38:39.760 --> 2:38:45.160]  out the lineage of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, that they're Ashkenazi, and
[2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:50.360]  he explains, you know, in Judaism, you got to have a proper legitimate matriarchal lineage.
[2:38:50.360 --> 2:38:56.120]  These people don't have a legitimate, you know, a person can proselytize into the faith,
[2:38:56.120 --> 2:39:00.560]  and their descendants are considered to be full-fledged Jews. But the thing is that,
[2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:06.480]  basically, I try to point people out that there's a site called Jews Not Zionist that
[2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:13.240]  fully concur that basically Zionism and Judaism are exactly opposite in so many respects.
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:19.960]  Judaism says, you treat your fellow man whether he's a believer in the Jewish faith or not
[2:39:19.960 --> 2:39:26.800]  with the same fairness and justice, regardless. And Zionism says, basically, it's basically
[2:39:26.800 --> 2:39:33.680]  militant hegyonymy, and basically oppression and provocaturing, and...
[2:39:33.680 --> 2:39:38.760]  Well, let me speak to that just for one second, because a lot of people, you know, obviously,
[2:39:38.760 --> 2:39:42.920]  they try to associate the Patriot movement, the Nile and Truth movement with anti-Semitism,
[2:39:42.920 --> 2:39:47.680]  and any time that you bring up Israel as a bad guy, in which many cases they are, they
[2:39:47.680 --> 2:39:52.440]  automatically say Jew. Well, number one, in the United States, you don't refer to everybody
[2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:56.360]  as a Christian, okay, even though that is the dominant religion. Okay, just because
[2:39:56.360 --> 2:40:03.480]  you live in Israel does not mean you are a Jew. And just because you're born of a Middle
[2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:07.760]  Eastern descent that happens to be, quote-unquote, Jewish, doesn't mean you follow that religion.
[2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:12.000]  So I think that that's just a terrible term. I think when you're criticizing the Israeli
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:15.920]  government or the Mossad, you need to say that by name. And I think that there is a
[2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:21.480]  total difference between what Zionism is, which was the creation and prolonging of Israel
[2:40:21.480 --> 2:40:28.200]  and all this agenda in the Middle East from Judaism. I'm a New York man, and when I went
[2:40:28.200 --> 2:40:33.640]  to college, half of the students were Jewish descent, had a bar mitzvah, the whole thing.
[2:40:33.640 --> 2:40:37.720]  These people aren't part of some kind of plot to take over the world. They're not inherently
[2:40:37.720 --> 2:40:42.640]  evil. They're people like you and me, and they're following the religion that their
[2:40:42.640 --> 2:40:49.720]  parents put upon them. And I hate the confusion. I hate all of the anti-Jew stuff. It's garbage.
[2:40:49.720 --> 2:40:56.440]  Yeah, because it's one of those things where, and the thing I try to be clear is when people
[2:40:56.440 --> 2:41:02.720]  hear this mistaken idea that in Islam and the Muslim world, they refer to America as
[2:41:02.720 --> 2:41:06.200]  the Great Satan, it's like, no, they're not even referring to the government as the Great
[2:41:06.200 --> 2:41:11.200]  Satan. They're referring not merely to the political figures that are up at the top
[2:41:11.200 --> 2:41:16.440]  of the apparent pyramid. They're referring actually more to the people behind the scenes.
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:22.200]  Well, there's that great revelations quotation right before they go over the Mark of the
[2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:26.720]  Beast that our leaders will pose as Christians and actually be into the occult, and it's
[2:41:26.720 --> 2:41:30.880]  all in the same paragraph. It's unbelievable to me. I thank you for the call mark. I'm
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:36.480]  going to try to jump over to the Bilderberg group. Matt LaPasic is doing a little bullhorning,
[2:41:36.480 --> 2:41:38.600]  so let's hit the button, and hopefully it works. Let's go.
[2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:47.120]  It goes inside the building as a deny that this conference even exists. How do they do
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:52.120]  that? Why do they do that? And who are they working for? They're not working for your
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:55.960]  family. They're not working for my family. They're not working for the United States
[2:41:55.960 --> 2:42:01.360]  of America. My name is a nuisance for which this country was founded on. They're working
[2:42:01.360 --> 2:42:08.440]  towards a world order, a situation of power. Today, this country stands in front of a
[2:42:08.440 --> 2:42:14.360]  manager. Our country stands a threat of the North American Union and the security and
[2:42:14.360 --> 2:42:21.760]  prosperity agreements that threaten to manage all what's over powers. Today, the European
[2:42:21.760 --> 2:42:27.840]  Union is nearly completed with the president's rating and the final onslaught introducing
[2:42:27.840 --> 2:42:34.600]  the new European Union presidential superstate. And there you have it, live from Bilderberg.
[2:42:34.600 --> 2:42:38.040]  Remember, you can get that video feed over at wearchange.org. We're probably going to
[2:42:38.040 --> 2:42:43.560]  be playing some of that in the final hour with Amy Allen. Let's take one more phone
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:47.680]  call, and then I'm going to try to play this Amy Allen video. Let's go to Renee. Renee,
[2:42:47.680 --> 2:42:52.600]  you're live on the Alex Jones show. Well, before I get to my point, I just am just
[2:42:52.600 --> 2:42:59.080]  a little suspicious. I am suspicious that I just don't think it's a coincidence that
[2:42:59.080 --> 2:43:08.280]  little hottie, Amy Allen, was scheduled when you were supposed to, Jason. I'll admit,
[2:43:08.280 --> 2:43:14.960]  I did luck out. I think that was your plan. Hey, I don't book the guests, but I'll take
[2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:20.200]  them when I get them. She looks a lot better than Willie Nelson. I would have to agree
[2:43:20.200 --> 2:43:28.600]  with you there. But I think one thing that we have to get rid of, to ever have a chance
[2:43:28.600 --> 2:43:35.240]  of getting the whole system clean, is all these perks that the government workers get.
[2:43:35.240 --> 2:43:40.800]  The thing is, to me, it's not... Oh, did we just lose her? That's unfortunate, because
[2:43:40.800 --> 2:43:44.740]  she seemed like she had a lot of good things to say, but I have to agree with her. A lot
[2:43:44.740 --> 2:43:52.160]  of people are drawn into the government sector because of the benefits, because they're not
[2:43:52.160 --> 2:43:57.080]  going to have to worry about their dental, their health, their family's health, and that
[2:43:57.080 --> 2:44:01.760]  makes them good little servants. They don't want to question the status quo. They don't
[2:44:01.760 --> 2:44:04.640]  want to have to go to the private sector, where they're going to probably have to take
[2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:09.280]  a decrease in pay, and a decrease in benefits, and struggle a little more. They're willing
[2:44:09.280 --> 2:44:15.160]  to take on that fascism. I got some more callers, but before we go to the callers, let's do
[2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:19.320]  it, because we got Alex coming up in the bottom of the hour, and then Amy probably doesn't
[2:44:19.320 --> 2:44:23.560]  want to hear her own song again. But here it is, the video, the unofficial video for
[2:44:23.560 --> 2:44:30.560]  Ron Paul Revolution.
[2:44:53.560 --> 2:45:15.560]  We don't want no war no more to bring our boys home to our shores. We don't want big government
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:33.560]  no more to bring our boys home to our shores. We don't want no war no more to bring our
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:56.560]  boys home to our shores. We don't want no war no more to bring our boys home to our shores.
[2:45:56.560 --> 2:46:06.560]  We don't want no war no more to bring our boys home to our shores. We don't want to
[2:46:06.560 --> 2:46:27.560]  bring our boys home to our shores. We don't want no war no more to bring our boys home
[2:46:27.560 --> 2:46:52.560]  to our shores. We don't want no war no more to bring our boys home to our shores. We don't
[2:46:52.560 --> 2:47:08.560]  want no war no more to bring our boys home to our shores. We don't want no war no more
[2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:23.560]  to bring our boys home to our shores. We don't want no war no more to bring our boys home
[2:47:23.560 --> 2:47:41.560]  to our shores. We don't want no war no more to bring our boys home to our shores.
[2:47:41.560 --> 2:47:56.560]  We don't want no war no more to bring our boys home to our shores. We don't want no
[2:47:56.560 --> 2:48:17.560]  war no more to bring our boys home to our shores.
[2:48:17.560 --> 2:48:27.560]  I see my film Loose Change on college campuses. I talked at high schools and colleges more
[2:48:27.560 --> 2:48:31.560]  than any other place. And I've even talked to the middle schools. The young people know
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:36.560]  what's going on. That's where it's big. And we need to motivate them to get involved in
[2:48:36.560 --> 2:48:40.560]  government, to learn what the three branches are again, to look for checks and balances.
[2:48:40.560 --> 2:48:44.240]  for checks and balances all right let's take another caller before we end this
[2:48:44.240 --> 2:48:47.280]  segment let's go to chris and florida chris you with me
[2:48:47.280 --> 2:48:50.560]  yes i am what's up chasen how you doing good man how you doing

[2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:32.800]  but we were in the thing and they asked us to stop filming them it was him and
[2:49:32.800 --> 2:49:36.160]  david dunbar and i approached them prior to the
[2:49:36.160 --> 2:49:39.040]  thing i gave my card i said you know i'd love to interview you guys for the final
[2:49:39.040 --> 2:49:42.000]  cut you know a representative popular mechanics and they took my card blah blah

[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:54.000]  was blown away he's looking at me he can't believe what i'm saying to him
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:57.520]  and then by the second segment he actually turned to me and he said you
[2:49:57.520 --> 2:50:01.760]  know i was not prepared for you guys to be as well spoken
[2:50:01.760 --> 2:50:05.840]  and and prepared for this thing he's like i'm quite surprised

[3:01:10.240 --> 3:01:13.680]  and it's so much of a turnout that the bill diver actually put out their first
[3:01:13.680 --> 3:01:18.240]  press release ever today and it's a paragraph long we read it
[3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:21.760]  earlier and of course they're they're meeting in secret for our good
[3:01:21.760 --> 3:01:25.440]  amy it's not it's not the plan nothing bad and they say well there's not going
[3:01:25.440 --> 3:01:29.280]  to be a press conference and the only reason that they're meeting secret is
[3:01:29.280 --> 3:01:33.760]  so they can talk openly and honestly now why can't they talk openly and honestly
[3:01:33.760 --> 3:01:36.800]  about policy that's going to be passed in this country
[3:01:36.800 --> 3:01:42.080]  uh in front of the american people yeah and why i mean and why is it just so i
[3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:44.560]  mean this is amazing that they're doing a press release and
[3:01:44.560 --> 3:01:47.520]  what just a few days ago hillary had no idea what
[3:01:47.520 --> 3:01:51.920]  anyone is talking about exactly yeah exactly hillary doesn't know
[3:01:51.920 --> 3:01:54.960]  what bill derberg is she's been confronted on the couple of times her
[3:01:54.960 --> 3:01:58.480]  husband has admitted to going they even released the list this year
[3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:01.120]  and uh let me name off some of the people that have been confirmed
[3:02:01.120 --> 3:02:05.600]  of course ben brunacky uh federal uh reserve chairman is there
[3:02:05.600 --> 3:02:09.760]  then we have david rockefeller like we always do paul wolffowitz condi rice is
[3:02:09.760 --> 3:02:14.000]  there officially uh tom dash yeah tom dash it is nauseating
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:17.520]  it really is nauseating that people that are even supposed to be on the quote
[3:02:17.520 --> 3:02:20.000]  unquote other side of the spectrum like dashel
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:23.920]  former senate house majority leader for the democrats is there you know it just
[3:02:23.920 --> 3:02:26.480]  proves again and again and again that these two
[3:02:26.480 --> 3:02:30.240]  collude behind closed doors they're going to have this big meeting
[3:02:30.240 --> 3:02:34.240]  of 125 to 140 people we're going to pay for their iPods
[3:02:34.240 --> 3:02:38.240]  i don't know if you saw that story yeah i yeah we're going to pay for their ipod
[3:02:38.240 --> 3:02:41.040]  i just want to know what music they're listening to i mean is it just
[3:02:41.040 --> 3:02:44.640]  hopefully it's your music or like what are they listening to
[3:02:44.640 --> 3:02:49.040]  it's probably pretty satanic hardcore uh anyway so they're going to have this
[3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:51.840]  meeting and uh this weekend with with these people
[3:02:51.840 --> 3:02:54.560]  now in a month they're going to get together at the bohemian grove
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:57.200]  where there's three thousand of these people and then they're going to
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:01.520]  dispense their agenda throughout those three thousand people through compartmentalization
[3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:04.880]  and then they're going to dispense to their minions and so on with
[3:03:04.880 --> 3:03:08.880]  only a partial part of the picture being known to each of these people
[3:03:08.880 --> 3:03:12.240]  and again they're deciding what's going to happen in our country
[3:03:12.240 --> 3:03:16.000]  for the next 12 months and it's tragic to me it's tragic to me that more people
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:19.120]  don't know it and that's exactly why i wrote this
[3:03:19.120 --> 3:03:23.200]  song is because i you know in talking to people they just
[3:03:23.200 --> 3:03:27.440]  don't know they just don't know about boulderberg they don't know
[3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:31.280]  about the global elites and the and the fact that they want to take
[3:03:31.280 --> 3:03:35.120]  our sovereignty and our constitutional rights and they they literally have the
[3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:38.000]  agenda of the north american union people don't know
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:42.640]  at all and it's just like it's so frustrating and it's also
[3:03:42.640 --> 3:03:46.960]  it's devastating to watch our country just sort of being brought to its knees
[3:03:46.960 --> 3:03:50.960]  systematically yeah through incrementalization so what what woke
[3:03:50.960 --> 3:03:54.720]  amy allen up what what was it that that have you been doing this for years have
[3:03:54.720 --> 3:03:57.120]  you always looked into this was there a certain
[3:03:57.120 --> 3:04:00.480]  film or book or television show um no i've always
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:07.120]  i've always um even going way back to um high school i actually spoke at a
[3:04:07.120 --> 3:04:11.040]  on t-span really to in front of congress
[3:04:11.040 --> 3:04:14.800]  about the decriminalization of marijuana i've always sort of been
[3:04:14.800 --> 3:04:18.960]  um an activist and want and wanting to um
[3:04:18.960 --> 3:04:21.760]  create change you know and and get people to wake up
[3:04:21.760 --> 3:04:27.280]  but um when i was on a lecture record um what really sort of
[3:04:27.280 --> 3:04:30.560]  was interesting was i would pose questions about political questions
[3:04:30.560 --> 3:04:32.640]  about things that were going on hold that thought because we have to go to
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:35.760]  break we have amy allen start a revolution we'll be back

[3:06:54.160 --> 3:06:57.840]  that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are

[3:08:31.680 --> 3:08:35.120]  your time with electoral records and uh what set you off there Amy
[3:08:35.120 --> 3:08:40.400]  well um what happened was is you know i'm being on a major label is they
[3:08:40.400 --> 3:08:44.800]  really i mean they threaten me with um
[3:08:44.800 --> 3:08:47.360]  not talking about politics and they basically said like we're not going to
[3:08:47.360 --> 3:08:50.720]  release the record if you continue and this is i'd start a revolution if i
[3:08:50.720 --> 3:08:54.480]  could get up in the morning right and what happened was is that because i had
[3:08:54.480 --> 3:08:58.560]  the word revolution in my title my song is a lot of
[3:08:58.560 --> 3:09:02.800]  people that would go on my message board and talk about revolution and right
[3:09:02.800 --> 3:09:07.920]  after 9-11 the cia called my record company and said
[3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:12.080]  you have to take her message board down or she has to either stop talking about
[3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:18.000]  what's going on or um using the word revolution um or
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:22.720]  um or else i mean i don't even know what the threat was so total censorship
[3:09:22.720 --> 3:09:26.160]  huh total censorship total censorship so i got a call from my
[3:09:26.160 --> 3:09:29.280]  my label saying you have to stop being political we got a call from the cia and
[3:09:29.280 --> 3:09:33.840]  i was just like blown away i couldn't believe it i was like really
[3:09:33.840 --> 3:09:38.160]  you know and so that really so as soon as my record label folded
[3:09:38.160 --> 3:09:41.920]  um you know i thought that you know doing the wrong paul song was just
[3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:45.120]  that should release for me because i you know i could finally like say what i
[3:09:45.120 --> 3:09:49.200]  wanted to say without you know uh what effectively censored you for
[3:09:49.200 --> 3:09:52.480]  almost five years oh well yeah well they wouldn't they would
[3:09:52.480 --> 3:09:56.480]  not let me sign with another label they held me you know hostage
[3:09:56.480 --> 3:10:00.320]  obviously very very talented and that's probably why they don't want this type
[3:10:00.320 --> 3:10:03.040]  of message to get out to the masses and it's through
[3:10:03.040 --> 3:10:06.800]  song and pop culture that we really are able to wake up the most amount of
[3:10:06.800 --> 3:10:12.400]  people exactly and it was and i'm so happy um that
[3:10:12.400 --> 3:10:16.000]  you know the videos had the response that it's had that you know we just
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:19.920]  basically you know we just had to do it you know when we watched um
[3:10:19.920 --> 3:10:24.880]  lucian who um the producer of the song uh were really good friends and we just
[3:10:24.880 --> 3:10:28.880]  sat there and watched uh freedom from freedom to fascism together and
[3:10:28.880 --> 3:10:32.400]  we watched uh parts of zeitgeist and we were just like you know what are we
[3:10:32.400 --> 3:10:36.880]  going to do and we're sitting there in our in um in our house and um we just
[3:10:36.880 --> 3:10:40.240]  looked at each other like gosh i wish there was just something we could do
[3:10:40.240 --> 3:10:43.360]  and there was silence and then we just looked at each other and just laughed
[3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:46.560]  and we're like let's do it let's do it right now let's just write a song
[3:10:46.560 --> 3:10:50.480]  right now and because there's just no there was no other choice it's like we
[3:10:50.480 --> 3:10:54.480]  had to say something so everybody in that video pretty much worked for pro bono
[3:10:54.480 --> 3:10:58.000]  and it's an awesome video by the way oh thank you yeah that what happened we
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:02.960]  what we realized is that um you know i live in west hollywood big gay community
[3:11:02.960 --> 3:11:07.280]  and um a lot of my friends are gay almost all my friends are gay guys
[3:11:07.280 --> 3:11:10.320]  and um if you're watching the mainstream media
[3:11:10.320 --> 3:11:13.600]  you know they'll tell you that you know that the gay communities for
[3:11:13.600 --> 3:11:17.280]  hillard clinton and that's it that just wasn't the case
[3:11:17.280 --> 3:11:21.200]  um and that's just not the case because they there's a huge
[3:11:21.200 --> 3:11:25.440]  gay community for ron paul because they knew they understand
[3:11:25.440 --> 3:11:29.680]  you know they want freedom just as much as you know the next person
[3:11:29.680 --> 3:11:32.560]  um and they knew they could get married and there'd be so many more rights
[3:11:32.560 --> 3:11:34.720]  because the government would stay out of religion
[3:11:34.720 --> 3:11:38.320]  which is what marriage is religious absolutely less government intrusion in
[3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:41.680]  their lives exactly and so pretty much everyone
[3:11:41.680 --> 3:11:44.800]  worked on the video was just super in the ron paul and they're like let's do it
[3:11:44.800 --> 3:11:47.600]  let's go we got you know with cinematographers and
[3:11:47.600 --> 3:11:51.680]  lighting we got free everything because everyone wanted to help get the message
[3:11:51.680 --> 3:11:56.160]  out and it was just so refreshing and and just an awesome awesome display
[3:11:56.160 --> 3:11:58.560]  and then you're also friends with the suicide girls because they make a
[3:11:58.560 --> 3:12:02.880]  little bit of an appearance too right well i host um i'm not a suicide girl
[3:12:02.880 --> 3:12:07.520]  but i host uh a show um on indy 1031 called that suicide
[3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:12.880]  girls radio and um and uh so i get a chance to say
[3:12:12.880 --> 3:12:17.440]  you know a lot of my uh take down the new world order
[3:12:17.440 --> 3:12:22.240]  on uh on uh on the on the radio show what's that on fm yeah one of three point
[3:12:22.240 --> 3:12:26.480]  one fm excellent angela killer but uh the suicide girls
[3:12:26.480 --> 3:12:30.960]  i mean they're you know i had to compete with the the the hip hop
[3:12:30.960 --> 3:12:36.080]  hip hop music videos um no i'm kidding i i wanted to have the suicide girls on
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:39.600]  there because they're like punk rock and hey a little sex appeal never hurts
[3:12:39.600 --> 3:12:43.600]  right the sex appeal get people's attention you know because uh you know
[3:12:43.600 --> 3:12:46.720]  you know people are a little dumb down these days if i you know
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:50.160]  show a couple of cute girls and bikinis maybe they'll listen to my message about
[3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:54.640]  the boulder burger group but um but yeah they're punk rock
[3:12:54.640 --> 3:12:57.600]  and um they you know the owner of the suicide girls
[3:12:57.600 --> 3:13:01.120]  um had you know bikinis made up that says you know
[3:13:01.120 --> 3:13:04.320]  ron paul uh you know suicide girls love ron paul like
[3:13:04.320 --> 3:13:07.440]  just had him made him up just you know for free just because
[3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:11.200]  they're all you know he's about smaller government and they're about you know
[3:13:11.200 --> 3:13:14.400]  they're just you know ron paul is the punk rock candidate
[3:13:14.400 --> 3:13:19.760]  and he's he is the voice of the people who really want real freedom you know
[3:13:19.760 --> 3:13:22.960]  yeah no i'm absolutely with you in fact you know i just got down to austin
[3:13:22.960 --> 3:13:26.400]  texas uh a little less than two months ago for the very first time
[3:13:26.400 --> 3:13:30.560]  and i'm from new york and although there was a big you know ron paul movement
[3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:35.120]  in my community in new york i never expected to come down here and just see
[3:13:35.120 --> 3:13:39.520]  ron paul on all these cars i saw young people wearing ron paul
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:42.880]  uh t-shirts with ties on i i mean i was just shocked
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:46.240]  that that many people especially younger people you know like
[3:13:46.240 --> 3:13:50.880]  ut kids uh knew that ron paul was the only candidate that was going to offer
[3:13:50.880 --> 3:13:54.400]  freedom the only candidate that was going to get us out of iraq and i ran the
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:56.800]  only candidate that was going to limit government
[3:13:56.800 --> 3:13:59.840]  and the only candidate that's not a globalist
[3:13:59.840 --> 3:14:04.560]  yeah with the cfr agenda and you know that i mean the war on drugs
[3:14:04.560 --> 3:14:10.560]  and that's just been a huge issue for me for many years i just think it's so
[3:14:10.560 --> 3:14:14.960]  ridiculous no i'm with you there have you seen american drug war yet
[3:14:14.960 --> 3:14:18.880]  no oh you've got to see american drug war it's done it's done by kevin booth
[3:14:18.880 --> 3:14:23.120]  who used to manage comedian uh bill hicks but it's got tommy chong we had him
[3:14:23.120 --> 3:14:26.320]  on the program a couple times in the last few weeks
[3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:30.160]  and uh it's also got selly castillo who helped run the drugs for this government
[3:14:30.160 --> 3:14:34.880]  into this country uh they got jack arpaio uh they also have barry mccaffrey
[3:14:34.880 --> 3:14:39.120]  it's just a very well documentary that really peels back the layers on how we
[3:14:39.120 --> 3:14:42.400]  ship in the drugs and then we prosecute the users
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:46.960]  and we have them work for slave slave labor wages in our privatized prisons
[3:14:46.960 --> 3:14:50.320]  exactly i couldn't put it better thank you
[3:14:50.320 --> 3:14:54.000]  exactly i'm i'm going to first of all love bill hicks just have to say that
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:56.720]  but um american drug war will definitely check that out
[3:14:56.720 --> 3:14:59.840]  definitely have to it's an excellent movie it's got a great cover we uh
[3:14:59.840 --> 3:15:03.600]  actually carry it over at info wars dot com for the listeners and i think that
[3:15:03.600 --> 3:15:06.400]  it might even be posted over at prismplanet.tv
[3:15:06.400 --> 3:15:09.280]  uh go check it out so so what's the future for amy allen are you going to put

[3:15:11.200 --> 3:15:16.880]  record label i mean i'm sure i i'm definitely not going to um
[3:15:16.880 --> 3:15:20.720]  be a slave to any record company i'm starting my own company and just releasing
[3:15:20.720 --> 3:15:25.920]  it releasing my music on my own um that's just the best way to do it i mean

[3:16:32.640 --> 3:16:35.680]  just like a small company that we formed for scott and amy
[3:16:35.680 --> 3:16:39.200]  but that's just for that particular record but my
[3:16:39.200 --> 3:16:43.920]  my particular record label uh is just um
[3:16:43.920 --> 3:16:48.880]  is is is not named yet so well i hope you come up with a good name because
[3:16:48.880 --> 3:16:53.120]  it's great music it's a great message and uh you know actually california is one
[3:16:53.120 --> 3:16:56.080]  of the more active places that you know i spent a little time out in hollywood
[3:16:56.080 --> 3:16:59.600]  myself and i went out to the big hollywood protest
[3:16:59.600 --> 3:17:02.560]  last summer there's a lot of awake minds out there
[3:17:02.560 --> 3:17:07.520]  uh maybe a little left-leaning i guess but as we expose them more as globalist
[3:17:07.520 --> 3:17:10.000]  i mean even in your song you're talking about the verichip
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:12.640]  uh you've been talking about the mark of the beast which i found shocking you
[3:17:12.640 --> 3:17:15.920]  know the 666 the fact that these people are into weird stuff like
[3:17:15.920 --> 3:17:20.640]  numerology and paganism and their bohemian grove club but what really
[3:17:20.640 --> 3:17:24.320]  does scare me is that the verichip is very real
[3:17:24.320 --> 3:17:27.360]  and uh just a few weeks ago one of the people that likes to
[3:17:27.360 --> 3:17:31.040]  go after loose change and debunk loose changes on the forums all the time
[3:17:31.040 --> 3:17:34.560]  he is a military guy and he got called into the
[3:17:34.560 --> 3:17:37.360]  the office and he said all right you got to go for a checkup and he wasn't due
[3:17:37.360 --> 3:17:40.240]  for one for five years he checks out in the checkup and then all
[3:17:40.240 --> 3:17:43.840]  of a sudden they stamp his thing with rfid and uh the next
[3:17:43.840 --> 3:17:46.960]  thursday he had to take the chip and he had no choice it was either that
[3:17:46.960 --> 3:17:49.920]  or get court marshaled and go to military prison
[3:17:49.920 --> 3:17:54.400]  um you know i wish i was making this stuff up
[3:17:54.400 --> 3:17:58.320]  i know i'm not and yeah no this is one of the debunkers and
[3:17:58.320 --> 3:18:02.000]  even he was really disturbed by it and about half the people that normally
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:05.440]  attack us and would have gone after us just kind of stopped posting all
[3:18:05.440 --> 3:18:09.200]  together uh because my producer kori roe uh who
[3:18:09.200 --> 3:18:12.560]  is a former soldier who was both in afghanistan and iraq
[3:18:12.560 --> 3:18:15.680]  had just given a speech after one of our screenings about how they were
[3:18:15.680 --> 3:18:20.400]  chipping soldiers and it's not just soldiers i mean back in 2004 we had
[3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:23.040]  members in the mexican government about 140 of them
[3:18:23.040 --> 3:18:27.280]  take chips in their arms for security reasons and now mexico is proposing
[3:18:27.280 --> 3:18:31.440]  getting rid of their passport for other south americans uh basically if you live
[3:18:31.440 --> 3:18:35.200]  in guatemala and below you're going to have to take an rfid chip
[3:18:35.200 --> 3:18:38.880]  to get into mexico it's the it's the curb illegal immigration
[3:18:38.880 --> 3:18:42.880]  and whenever they're forcing us to take chips i i think it's it's time to wake
[3:18:42.880 --> 3:18:46.320]  up any seriously i mean there's certain jobs that you
[3:18:46.320 --> 3:18:49.600]  you know that you can't even get unless you get chipped

[3:27:48.000 --> 3:27:52.480]  hillary clinton magically met last night in dc when the builder bird conference

[3:27:56.800 --> 3:28:00.880]  over television yesterday barack was on a sit-down interview
[3:28:00.880 --> 3:28:04.320]  over on anderson cooper 360 talking about how it was going to be the most
[3:28:04.320 --> 3:28:07.920]  important decision he's ever made and you know for the last six months i've been
[3:28:07.920 --> 3:28:11.840]  saying look it's going to be an obama hillary ticket or a hillary obama
[3:28:11.840 --> 3:28:15.520]  ticket uh with john edwards maybe being the vice president for either
[3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:19.600]  if that falls through but you know these are their top two dogs and i feel like
[3:28:19.600 --> 3:28:22.640]  they wanted hillary clinton a little bit more
[3:28:22.640 --> 3:28:26.000]  but they'll take you know cfr obama just because
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:29.680]  he is a slick speaker people are getting behind him they are fooled
[3:28:29.680 --> 3:28:33.440]  because of his rhetoric he hasn't said anything you know he hasn't said
[3:28:33.440 --> 3:28:36.960]  anything he hasn't said i'm coming we're getting out of iraq he hasn't said

[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:51.200]  loyal to our country i mean that that just doesn't even seem to be an issue
[3:28:51.200 --> 3:28:55.520]  that people aren't even bringing up it's like he's not loyal to our country

[3:29:03.360 --> 3:29:07.520]  our country i mean i don't know maybe that's crazy but i'm thinking maybe a
[3:29:07.520 --> 3:29:10.800]  president who believes in the bill of rights in the constitution
[3:29:10.800 --> 3:29:15.120]  and wants smaller government and wants oversight and wants checks and balances

[3:32:47.240 --> 3:32:53.600]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[3:32:53.600 --> 3:32:57.520]  a war on for your mind.
[3:32:57.520 --> 3:33:01.120]  There truly is a war on for your mind right now.
[3:33:01.120 --> 3:33:03.840]  Every day, every day you turn on that television.
[3:33:03.840 --> 3:33:07.080]  They are pumping disinformation into your brain.
[3:33:07.080 --> 3:33:10.880]  They're telling you buy, buy, buy, pay no attention to the men behind the curtain.
[3:33:10.880 --> 3:33:15.680]  Well, the men behind the curtain are being exposed right now at Bilderberg 2008 and it's
[3:33:15.680 --> 3:33:21.160]  thanks to people like Alex Jones, who's a personal hero of mine, a good friend.
[3:33:21.160 --> 3:33:22.160]  God bless him.
[3:33:22.160 --> 3:33:23.480]  Luke Rudowski and others who are out there.
[3:33:23.480 --> 3:33:25.120]  I saw Dave Cahill was out there.
[3:33:25.120 --> 3:33:30.640]  He's an amazing musician, Abbey from 9-11 Truth in LA.
[3:33:30.640 --> 3:33:33.160]  Just a lot of people showed up this year and it's great.
[3:33:33.160 --> 3:33:35.200]  We forced him to put out a press release.
[3:33:35.200 --> 3:33:40.880]  We're talking to Amy Allen, who in her own right is quite the patriot, an amazing singer.
[3:33:40.880 --> 3:33:44.160]  She's got the Ron Paul Starter Revolution song.
[3:33:44.160 --> 3:33:48.480]  When can people expect new material outside of this Scott and Amy project?
[3:33:48.480 --> 3:33:52.600]  Well, I'm actually recording it.
[3:33:52.600 --> 3:33:56.960]  I've written all the songs, so I'm recording it now and they're recording process.
[3:33:56.960 --> 3:33:57.960]  Very soon.
[3:33:57.960 --> 3:33:58.960]  Excellent.
[3:33:58.960 --> 3:34:01.240]  In the next couple of months or so.
[3:34:01.240 --> 3:34:02.240]  Awesome.
[3:34:02.240 --> 3:34:03.640]  Let's get some callers, Amy.
[3:34:03.640 --> 3:34:07.440]  Let's go to Joe in Chicago because it seems to be on topic.
[3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:08.440]  Joe, are you with us?
[3:34:08.440 --> 3:34:09.440]  Hello.
[3:34:09.440 --> 3:34:10.440]  How are you doing, Joe?
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:11.440]  Doing pretty good, Jason.
[3:34:11.440 --> 3:34:12.440]  How's it going?
[3:34:12.440 --> 3:34:13.440]  Good.
[3:34:13.440 --> 3:34:19.480]  Hey, before I had a couple of questions for Amy, I had one thing that I wanted to tell
[3:34:19.480 --> 3:34:25.440]  you is obviously I'm here in Chicago, you know, Obama country and I was watching local
[3:34:25.440 --> 3:34:26.440]  TV last night.
[3:34:26.440 --> 3:34:32.200]  I don't know if it was WGN or WBBM, one of the local stations here, but somebody was
[3:34:32.200 --> 3:34:38.520]  asking, well, you know, where's the whole, you know, party for the Obama thing?
[3:34:38.520 --> 3:34:43.720]  And they were talking to one of his staff and he had said that Obama is in Virginia.
[3:34:43.720 --> 3:34:44.720]  Yeah.
[3:34:44.720 --> 3:34:46.240]  Oh, no, it's all over the news.
[3:34:46.240 --> 3:34:47.240]  He's in D.C.
[3:34:47.240 --> 3:34:51.960]  He met Hillary Clinton last night supposedly in her D.C. home on the night that Bilderberg
[3:34:51.960 --> 3:34:54.360]  kicked off in Chantilly, Virginia.
[3:34:54.360 --> 3:34:57.320]  There's no doubt that members of the conference were there at that meeting.
[3:34:57.320 --> 3:34:58.320]  Can you break?
[3:34:58.320 --> 3:34:59.320]  Of course.
[3:34:59.320 --> 3:35:00.320]  Yeah.
[3:35:00.320 --> 3:35:01.320]  Unbelievable.
[3:35:01.320 --> 3:35:02.320]  Yeah.
[3:35:02.320 --> 3:35:05.160]  But hey, I'm just very pleased to be able to talk to both of you.
[3:35:05.160 --> 3:35:07.440]  Jason, you've got some awesome works.
[3:35:07.440 --> 3:35:13.840]  Amy, I don't even have words for you because your music is just awesome, I really have
[3:35:13.840 --> 3:35:14.840]  to say.
[3:35:14.840 --> 3:35:15.840]  Oh, thank you so much.
[3:35:15.840 --> 3:35:16.840]  Thank you.
[3:35:16.840 --> 3:35:17.840]  Thank you.
[3:35:17.840 --> 3:35:18.840]  Thank you.
[3:35:18.840 --> 3:35:19.840]  Yeah, definitely.
[3:35:19.840 --> 3:35:23.160]  I mean, I just got, it was really funny because I actually got turned on to you believe it
[3:35:23.160 --> 3:35:28.120]  or not by through infowords.com if you could believe that.
[3:35:28.120 --> 3:35:31.720]  And I watched the video on Rumpal Revolution, I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm like, this has got
[3:35:31.720 --> 3:35:35.680]  an incredible productions, got a great hook, incredible synth bass line.
[3:35:35.680 --> 3:35:39.360]  I'm like, this is seriously what we need.
[3:35:39.360 --> 3:35:46.080]  We need somebody who's got incredible talent that is a celebrity that is able to get this
[3:35:46.080 --> 3:35:48.280]  message out to the people.
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:51.080]  Because I mean, that's kind of like how I got involved with this.
[3:35:51.080 --> 3:35:55.360]  And now if we can only, because of the fact that you had all this information on your
[3:35:55.360 --> 3:35:59.480]  MySpace page, and we were getting other people that are getting more interested in this and
[3:35:59.480 --> 3:36:02.920]  it's breaking wide open, and I think that's really great what you're doing and the way
[3:36:02.920 --> 3:36:08.800]  that you took a stand against Electra and what they were trying to do to you, I think
[3:36:08.800 --> 3:36:10.640]  that is just appalling.
[3:36:10.640 --> 3:36:11.640]  Well, thank you.
[3:36:11.640 --> 3:36:12.640]  I mean, it is different.
[3:36:12.640 --> 3:36:18.520]  I mean, there's not too many artists that are putting their career on the line to stand
[3:36:18.520 --> 3:36:24.640]  up for what they believe in politically, but it wasn't even the choice that I had.
[3:36:24.640 --> 3:36:26.120]  It was just I had to do it.
[3:36:26.120 --> 3:36:30.400]  I was like, I don't even care if it's not the smartest business move or the best move
[3:36:30.400 --> 3:36:31.400]  my career.
[3:36:31.400 --> 3:36:32.400]  People have to know.
[3:36:32.400 --> 3:36:36.200]  And if it means that I sell less records, still be it.
[3:36:36.200 --> 3:36:41.840]  It's just people have to know because they can't just stand by and let our country get
[3:36:41.840 --> 3:36:42.840]  to the knees.
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:43.840]  Thank you, Joe.
[3:36:43.840 --> 3:36:44.840]  That's awesome.
[3:36:44.840 --> 3:36:45.840]  Thank you for the call, Joe.
[3:36:45.840 --> 3:36:46.840]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:36:46.840 --> 3:36:47.840]  We can't let this nation crumble.
[3:36:47.840 --> 3:36:52.480]  And it's just great that you've stepped up to do that, Amy, and you are going to wake
[3:36:52.480 --> 3:36:55.160]  up a lot more people that wouldn't normally be woken up.
[3:36:55.160 --> 3:36:59.040]  Again, pop culture is the way, I mean, how many people were brought into 9-Eleven Truth
[3:36:59.040 --> 3:37:00.240]  through Rosie O'Donnell?
[3:37:00.240 --> 3:37:03.680]  How many people were brought into 9-Eleven Truth through Charlie Sheen that would have
[3:37:03.680 --> 3:37:06.720]  never, ever, ever taken a look at this information?
[3:37:06.720 --> 3:37:07.720]  All right.
[3:37:07.720 --> 3:37:10.200]  On topic, let's go to Rick in Ohio.
[3:37:10.200 --> 3:37:11.520]  Rick, are you with us?
[3:37:11.520 --> 3:37:12.520]  No?
[3:37:12.520 --> 3:37:13.520]  Did we drop Rick?
[3:37:13.520 --> 3:37:14.520]  Hi.
[3:37:14.520 --> 3:37:15.520]  How are you doing?
[3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:16.520]  Hey, how are you doing, Rick?
[3:37:16.520 --> 3:37:17.520]  Interesting show.
[3:37:17.520 --> 3:37:18.520]  Thanks.
[3:37:18.520 --> 3:37:24.400]  I wanted to bring up something that's on topic, but perhaps something a lot of your listeners
[3:37:24.400 --> 3:37:26.880]  haven't thought about.
[3:37:26.880 --> 3:37:32.280]  In most respects, I'd have to say I support Ron Paul, like I'm assuming both of you do
[3:37:32.280 --> 3:37:36.840]  from listening to the last 10 minutes here.
[3:37:36.840 --> 3:37:41.000]  But I'm a real animal lover as well.
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:45.880]  Anyone who's had a cat or a dog or any kind of pet.
[3:37:45.880 --> 3:37:50.600]  I would imagine most decent people are.
[3:37:50.600 --> 3:37:55.960]  One thing I Googled was the presidential candidates and animal rights.
[3:37:55.960 --> 3:38:04.840]  Much to my dismay, what I found was that the three tools in the election at this point,
[3:38:04.840 --> 3:38:14.000]  you know, Obama, Hillary, and McCain actually have either perfect or very good animal rights
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:15.000]  voting histories.
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:17.120]  Well, let me speak to that for a second.
[3:38:17.120 --> 3:38:18.120]  Ron Paul doesn't.
[3:38:18.120 --> 3:38:19.120]  Well, all right.
[3:38:19.120 --> 3:38:22.600]  First of all, I think Ron Paul is not only about human rights, but he's about saving
[3:38:22.600 --> 3:38:23.600]  this country first.
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:26.360]  And that's why maybe animal rights take a secondary nature.
[3:38:26.360 --> 3:38:28.720]  Secondly, these globalists love animal rights.
[3:38:28.720 --> 3:38:35.000]  Peter Singer, who is a total one-worlder, talks like animals are better than people.
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:36.200]  And I just don't believe that, man.
[3:38:36.200 --> 3:38:39.800]  I'm here to say, if humanity, I'm sorry, but animals come second.
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:43.760]  You know, I feel like those people, their hearts are in the right place, but we have
[3:38:43.760 --> 3:38:49.760]  so many real issues from the Federal Reserve, from the gas prices, to imperialism in the
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:53.080]  Middle East, to the police state at home, that animal rights is just going to have to
[3:38:53.080 --> 3:38:54.080]  take a backseat.
[3:38:54.080 --> 3:38:55.720]  I thank you for the call.
[3:38:55.720 --> 3:38:56.720]  What do you think, Amy?
[3:38:56.720 --> 3:38:57.720]  I mean, I agree.
[3:38:57.720 --> 3:38:58.720]  We have to prioritize.
[3:38:58.720 --> 3:39:05.320]  I mean, the fact is, is that we don't have, you know, if we don't have our country, you
[3:39:05.320 --> 3:39:11.440]  know, then what if someone else is, you know, we're going to have a North American Union,
[3:39:11.440 --> 3:39:14.960]  if we're all going to be chipped, if, you know, we don't have it right to trial.
[3:39:14.960 --> 3:39:15.960]  Like dogs.
[3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:16.960]  I mean, I just, I want to prioritize.
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:18.960]  I mean, there's just, we have to prioritize.
[3:39:18.960 --> 3:39:21.640]  It's like, I feel like we're in a state of emergency.
[3:39:21.640 --> 3:39:22.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:39:22.640 --> 3:39:27.640]  And we had Jesse Benton on, who is the chair of Ron Paul's campaign.
[3:39:27.640 --> 3:39:32.240]  He announced today that they're going to be having something going on in Minneapolis
[3:39:32.240 --> 3:39:34.560]  on September 2nd, a Tuesday.
[3:39:34.560 --> 3:39:37.480]  And I also mentioned them to you, and they were very well aware of your work.
[3:39:37.480 --> 3:39:38.840]  They wanted to thank you.
[3:39:38.840 --> 3:39:41.000]  And they're a huge fan of the song.
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:42.840]  They were telling me they would love to have you go out there.
[3:39:42.840 --> 3:39:47.000]  I know you're a busy girl, but I hope that you do get in touch with Ron Paul and Jesse
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:51.120]  Benton and work something out because, you know, you are a strong voice.
[3:39:51.120 --> 3:39:55.720]  You're a pop, you know, this is popular culture and we're trying to bring, you know, the youth,
[3:39:55.720 --> 3:40:00.200]  the older crowd, everybody together to realize, you know, it's code red.
[3:40:00.200 --> 3:40:01.200]  This is the time.
[3:40:01.200 --> 3:40:02.200]  Yeah.
[3:40:02.200 --> 3:40:03.200]  Yeah.
[3:40:03.200 --> 3:40:10.480]  I would love to, I was telling your producer that I'd love, I'd love if Alex played the
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:13.600]  Ron Paul song over the bullhorn at the Bilderberg.
[3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:16.800]  Well, I'll call him after the show and I'll definitely, maybe we can get that live on
[3:40:16.800 --> 3:40:17.920]  the We Are Change feed.
[3:40:17.920 --> 3:40:22.600]  By the way, WeAreChange.org has a live video and audio feed of Bilderberg right now.
[3:40:22.600 --> 3:40:28.320]  There's about 15 or 20 people around Alex, you know, Matt LaPasic, Luke Radowski, Aaron
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:30.600]  Dykes, writer for Jones Report.
[3:40:30.600 --> 3:40:32.200]  Just a ton of awake people.
[3:40:32.200 --> 3:40:33.200]  It's so good to see.
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:34.200]  All right.
[3:40:34.200 --> 3:40:35.200]  Let's jump to yet another caller.
[3:40:35.200 --> 3:40:36.800]  Let's go to Corey in California.
[3:40:36.800 --> 3:40:37.800]  Corey, are you with us?
[3:40:37.800 --> 3:40:38.800]  Hey.
[3:40:38.800 --> 3:40:39.800]  Hello.
[3:40:39.800 --> 3:40:40.800]  Hi.
[3:40:40.800 --> 3:40:41.800]  This is Rick in Ohio.
[3:40:41.800 --> 3:40:42.800]  I think you got our names switched around there.
[3:40:42.800 --> 3:40:43.800]  Oh, okay.
[3:40:43.800 --> 3:40:44.800]  All right.
[3:40:44.800 --> 3:40:45.800]  Okay.
[3:40:45.800 --> 3:40:49.800]  But on his call, I need to address, he mentioned the animal rights and the voting.
[3:40:49.800 --> 3:40:50.800]  Okay.
[3:40:50.800 --> 3:40:57.200]  First off, let me try to explain something to him if I can do it well.
[3:40:57.200 --> 3:41:02.280]  This is like PETA, the PETA people, the environmentalist people.
[3:41:02.280 --> 3:41:05.240]  A lot of people get involved in this because it sounds good.
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:07.920]  It sounds like you're going to help the animals.
[3:41:07.920 --> 3:41:10.440]  You're going to help the environmentalist.
[3:41:10.440 --> 3:41:16.080]  But all it really gets down to is the CFR-funded front groups, is all they are, they're trying
[3:41:16.080 --> 3:41:22.520]  to elicit you as a useful idiot to support further restrictive legislation against you,
[3:41:22.520 --> 3:41:23.520]  the people.
[3:41:23.520 --> 3:41:27.400]  And that's the reason Ron Paul doesn't vote for his scams because he knows a scam when
[3:41:27.400 --> 3:41:28.400]  he sees one.
[3:41:28.400 --> 3:41:34.160]  Well, did you see the website that ABC, we did a story about this last week, ABC linked
[3:41:34.160 --> 3:41:39.680]  to this quote unquote child's website called planetslayer.com and it was all about your
[3:41:39.680 --> 3:41:40.680]  carbon footprint.
[3:41:40.680 --> 3:41:45.120]  They're getting ready to tax you for breathing, how much gas you use, how many cars you own,
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:46.120]  how much energy you use.
[3:41:46.120 --> 3:41:47.680]  They're going to actually tax that.
[3:41:47.680 --> 3:41:51.640]  And they were saying that your carbon footprint was less than that of a pig.
[3:41:51.640 --> 3:41:52.640]  The pig deserved to live.
[3:41:52.640 --> 3:41:57.000]  And they literally showed a small baby pig and a big pig and how much their carbon footprint
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  was.
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:01.760]  And they said, by the time that you had used your carbon footprint up, you'd be a whopping
[3:42:01.760 --> 3:42:05.200]  14 months old and there was a pool of blood in the middle.
[3:42:05.200 --> 3:42:07.480]  They quickly pulled that website.
[3:42:07.480 --> 3:42:09.160]  But you know, we know what the agenda is.
[3:42:09.160 --> 3:42:10.160]  It's more control.
[3:42:10.160 --> 3:42:11.560]  It's another tax.
[3:42:11.560 --> 3:42:12.960]  And it's absolutely ridiculous.
[3:42:12.960 --> 3:42:14.600]  Al Gore is not your friend either, folks.
[3:42:14.600 --> 3:42:17.280]  I thank you for the call.
[3:42:17.280 --> 3:42:19.600]  Let's see if we can get Corey in California.
[3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:21.000]  Is he on the line?
[3:42:21.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  Corey?
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  No?
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:24.000]  All right.
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  How about Frank in Ohio?
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:26.000]  Yeah.
[3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:27.000]  Corey, we got Corey.
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  All right.
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  Corey, what's your question?
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:30.000]  Hey, what's up, Jason?
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:31.000]  No.
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:37.240]  I was at Bilderberg last night and then I come up on a Bilderberg press release.
[3:42:37.240 --> 3:42:38.240]  Yeah.
[3:42:38.240 --> 3:42:39.240]  Yeah.
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:40.240]  We've read it on air today.
[3:42:40.240 --> 3:42:41.240]  Can you believe that?
[3:42:41.240 --> 3:42:42.240]  I mean, I was in shock.
[3:42:42.240 --> 3:42:44.360]  I was in shock too this morning when I actually got into it.
[3:42:44.360 --> 3:42:49.200]  I actually went and did a Google search of the past 24 hours on Stories on Bilderberg.
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:52.480]  Someone emailed me the press release, but the list was already out.
[3:42:52.480 --> 3:42:53.960]  And yeah, they're just announcing it.
[3:42:53.960 --> 3:42:54.960]  We're your global masters.
[3:42:54.960 --> 3:42:56.160]  You don't deserve to know what's going on.
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:42:58.200]  It's going to be a private meeting.
[3:42:58.200 --> 3:42:59.280]  No thank you press.
[3:42:59.280 --> 3:43:00.280]  You're already on the inside.
[3:43:00.280 --> 3:43:01.600]  So we'll tell you what to write.
[3:43:01.600 --> 3:43:03.240]  Has anyone called this number?
[3:43:03.240 --> 3:43:04.240]  Yeah.
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:05.240]  Yeah.
[3:43:05.240 --> 3:43:06.240]  A lot of people have called it number.
[3:43:06.240 --> 3:43:07.740]  Steven Lee or whoever is putting this out.
[3:43:07.740 --> 3:43:09.680]  It's the American Friends of Bilderberg.
[3:43:09.680 --> 3:43:12.760]  It's actually an organization that I just learned about.
[3:43:12.760 --> 3:43:14.600]  Aaron Dykes enlightened me on it last week.
[3:43:14.600 --> 3:43:17.960]  I didn't think that Bilderberg had any friends outside the organization.
[3:43:17.960 --> 3:43:18.960]  Oh, they're not my friend.
[3:43:18.960 --> 3:43:19.960]  That's for sure.
[3:43:19.960 --> 3:43:20.960]  Yeah.
[3:43:20.960 --> 3:43:21.960]  American Friends of Bilderberg.
[3:43:21.960 --> 3:43:23.960]  It's all part of the language and the nomenclature.
[3:43:23.960 --> 3:43:29.000]  They want to make you think that America supports Bilderberg when the vast majority don't even
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:30.640]  know what it is.
[3:43:30.640 --> 3:43:32.560]  Amy, what are some solutions?
[3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:37.400]  Obviously, we've been talking about bringing it up at parties and trying to get into the
[3:43:37.400 --> 3:43:38.400]  popular culture.
[3:43:38.400 --> 3:43:40.720]  But what else can we do?
[3:43:40.720 --> 3:43:49.760]  The way I look at it is when I got really deep into my research and just completely immersed
[3:43:49.760 --> 3:43:55.040]  myself in just research and study and everything that Alex would say, he always says, if you
[3:43:55.040 --> 3:43:56.200]  don't believe me, go research it.
[3:43:56.200 --> 3:43:57.200]  Go find it out.
[3:43:57.200 --> 3:43:58.200]  Go look at the documents.
[3:43:58.200 --> 3:43:59.200]  I did that.
[3:43:59.200 --> 3:44:00.200]  And I really got into it.
[3:44:00.200 --> 3:44:07.840]  And what I found was, well, I couldn't sleep ever because I was just so upset and distressed
[3:44:07.840 --> 3:44:10.200]  about everything.
[3:44:10.200 --> 3:44:14.480]  But what I realized was it's truly a spiritual battle.
[3:44:14.480 --> 3:44:15.920]  It's not just a political battle.
[3:44:15.920 --> 3:44:18.920]  I mean, I feel that it is the spiritual battle.
[3:44:18.920 --> 3:44:26.120]  So what we can do is do what I believe what God created us to do.
[3:44:26.120 --> 3:44:29.560]  So if you're a good writer, blog, write a book.
[3:44:29.560 --> 3:44:32.840]  If God made you a good speaker, speak the truth.
[3:44:32.840 --> 3:44:33.840]  Speak to people.
[3:44:33.840 --> 3:44:36.320]  If you're a good organizer, organize.
[3:44:36.320 --> 3:44:38.200]  Your politician, run for office.
[3:44:38.200 --> 3:44:39.800]  You sing, write a song.
[3:44:39.800 --> 3:44:41.880]  But we all have to play our role.
[3:44:41.880 --> 3:44:48.400]  We all have to do what God made us do or created us to do.
[3:44:48.400 --> 3:44:53.200]  And if we all do our parts, we can turn this around.
[3:44:53.200 --> 3:44:54.200]  Absolutely.
[3:44:54.200 --> 3:44:59.280]  And each of us have great power from within.
[3:44:59.280 --> 3:45:01.080]  And we just need to harness that power.
[3:45:01.080 --> 3:45:03.120]  We have to say, you know what, I've had enough.
[3:45:03.120 --> 3:45:04.720]  What can I contribute?
[3:45:04.720 --> 3:45:07.320]  And that's why I make documentary films.
[3:45:07.320 --> 3:45:09.200]  That's why I blog about the subject.
[3:45:09.200 --> 3:45:11.400]  That's why I do this radio show.
[3:45:11.400 --> 3:45:15.480]  It's because we have to reach these people by any means necessary.
[3:45:15.480 --> 3:45:21.520]  And I don't see anybody in the so-called establishment stepping up and saying these things.
[3:45:21.520 --> 3:45:25.240]  We had a couple people kind of hinting at the truth, you know, Dennis Cassinages and
[3:45:25.240 --> 3:45:26.240]  all that bad.
[3:45:26.240 --> 3:45:30.040]  And I liked what Mike Ravel had to say 90% of the time.
[3:45:30.040 --> 3:45:35.360]  But they're not out there every day, you know, trying to get this to the masses.
[3:45:35.360 --> 3:45:36.360]  And that's what we need.
[3:45:36.360 --> 3:45:40.960]  We need more and more people to say, all right, it's time to step up.
[3:45:40.960 --> 3:45:42.720]  It's time to share this information.
[3:45:42.720 --> 3:45:44.160]  It's time to take our country back.
[3:45:44.160 --> 3:45:48.840]  And I hope that Ron Paul has that march on Washington he talked about some months ago.
[3:45:48.840 --> 3:45:50.760]  Hopefully the next time we have Jesse Benton on.
[3:45:50.760 --> 3:45:58.160]  And it's time to not be to stop the brainwashing of it, you know, not cool to talk about it.
[3:45:58.160 --> 3:46:01.240]  Like, it is cool, you know, and it is cool to talk about it.
[3:46:01.240 --> 3:46:05.160]  It's cool to talk about politics and what's going on in mainstream media and the fact
[3:46:05.160 --> 3:46:09.200]  that they're completely, they're not reporting, you know, they're rooting for Canada.
[3:46:09.200 --> 3:46:10.200]  Yeah, no one with you.
[3:46:10.200 --> 3:46:11.200]  And you know what?
[3:46:11.200 --> 3:46:12.200]  You're right.
[3:46:12.200 --> 3:46:13.600]  It's time to make it cool again to be informed.
[3:46:13.600 --> 3:46:14.600]  Yes.
[3:46:14.600 --> 3:46:19.600]  You know, it shouldn't be the time that everybody goes and reads the tabloid rags about Britney
[3:46:19.600 --> 3:46:23.880]  Spears and how she's gained 20 pounds and she's on five different medications and shaved
[3:46:23.880 --> 3:46:24.880]  her head.
[3:46:24.880 --> 3:46:25.880]  I don't care.
[3:46:25.880 --> 3:46:26.880]  It means nothing to my life.
[3:46:26.880 --> 3:46:30.800]  You know, Paris Hilton's latest sex tape, yeah, it's great for a laugh.
[3:46:30.800 --> 3:46:33.920]  But other than that, I don't know why it's on every single network.
[3:46:33.920 --> 3:46:37.360]  You know, Jesse Ventura made a great point when Anna Nicole Smith died.
[3:46:37.360 --> 3:46:38.360]  Who cares?
[3:46:38.360 --> 3:46:39.360]  Okay.
[3:46:39.360 --> 3:46:43.320]  She was a reality TV star after she was a train wreck and a Playboy model.
[3:46:43.320 --> 3:46:47.280]  It doesn't affect my life, but most people don't even know.
[3:46:47.280 --> 3:46:51.960]  I would say most people couldn't pick out five names on this Bilderberg list when a
[3:46:51.960 --> 3:46:54.720]  lot of them are part of the U.S. administration, you know.
[3:46:54.720 --> 3:47:00.560]  A lot of them have been making decisions like Henry Kissinger for almost half a century.
[3:47:00.560 --> 3:47:02.240]  I mean, that's scary to me.
[3:47:02.240 --> 3:47:03.520]  It's totally scary.
[3:47:03.520 --> 3:47:09.600]  And what's, you know, when I put out this song, there's so many, there's so much support
[3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:10.600]  for the song.
[3:47:10.600 --> 3:47:14.080]  There was so much love and I was actually astonished at the support.
[3:47:14.080 --> 3:47:17.760]  It was on, like, the front page of Dig, you know, several times, and then Dig would pull
[3:47:17.760 --> 3:47:18.760]  it.
[3:47:18.760 --> 3:47:20.280]  Well, they got the berry regret there.
[3:47:20.280 --> 3:47:22.160]  How dare you tell the truth on Dig?
[3:47:22.160 --> 3:47:25.720]  They actually, the funny thing about that is the guy from Dig joked about how he went
[3:47:25.720 --> 3:47:29.320]  to Bohemian Grove with his, with his dad, I think, last year.
[3:47:29.320 --> 3:47:31.160]  That's on YouTube.
[3:47:31.160 --> 3:47:33.960]  It's just like, yeah, you know, I go to these elitist meetings and we're going to bury
[3:47:33.960 --> 3:47:38.880]  your stories and we're going to act like prisonplanet.com and infowars.com are the onion and they're
[3:47:38.880 --> 3:47:39.880]  not real.
[3:47:39.880 --> 3:47:40.880]  Right.
[3:47:40.880 --> 3:47:45.480]  It's absolutely ludicrous, but we just got to keep, you know, pressing and using, using
[3:47:45.480 --> 3:47:47.320]  the mainstream against itself, I guess.
[3:47:47.320 --> 3:47:48.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:47:48.320 --> 3:47:52.440]  And what I was going to say is that I was getting, you know, some really, some of the
[3:47:52.440 --> 3:47:57.680]  negative comments are not negative, but some of the posts were, um, would say things like,
[3:47:57.680 --> 3:48:03.400]  oh, come on, Amy, you know, uh, has the Patriot Act really affected you personally?
[3:48:03.400 --> 3:48:12.560]  And it would just make me so mad because the Patriot Act has so, so much affected me personally.
[3:48:12.560 --> 3:48:18.120]  Um, that I can't even, you know, I just couldn't, I can't even tell you, but basically went
[3:48:18.120 --> 3:48:26.120]  down to my bank and because of the Patriot Act, um, I couldn't get an ATM card.
[3:48:26.120 --> 3:48:32.160]  Literally, they said due to the Patriot Act, we cannot give you my, my strip on my, um,
[3:48:32.160 --> 3:48:34.520]  my card is broke and it wasn't working.
[3:48:34.520 --> 3:48:39.400]  So I was like, well, I need to get, you know, a ATM card with a symbolic Mastercard visa.
[3:48:39.400 --> 3:48:42.960]  And there was all this drama and they're like, you know what, because you don't, you know,
[3:48:42.960 --> 3:48:46.760]  you don't do this, this, this and this and this, there's like a list of five things you
[3:48:46.760 --> 3:48:48.640]  could be a potential terrorist.
[3:48:48.640 --> 3:48:51.320]  So we can't, we can't issue you another one.
[3:48:51.320 --> 3:48:55.400]  Well, I imagine you also fly pretty frequently in the hoops you have to jump through at the
[3:48:55.400 --> 3:48:58.720]  airport to get on a plane or just absolutely ludicrous.
[3:48:58.720 --> 3:48:59.720]  No water bottles.
[3:48:59.720 --> 3:49:00.720]  Come on.
[3:49:00.720 --> 3:49:01.720]  Yeah.
[3:49:01.720 --> 3:49:05.920]  Oh, the terrorists are going to use liquid bombs to blow us all up.
[3:49:05.920 --> 3:49:07.280]  Give me a break.
[3:49:07.280 --> 3:49:09.320]  The only time they ever get weapons through, there's a drill.
[3:49:09.320 --> 3:49:10.640]  I had a good buddy of mine.
[3:49:10.640 --> 3:49:11.640]  He was in the military.
[3:49:11.640 --> 3:49:16.120]  Uh, he got out right before nine, 11, he didn't end up having to go overseas, but he went
[3:49:16.120 --> 3:49:18.720]  into security over at LaGuardia airport.
[3:49:18.720 --> 3:49:22.280]  He was in the TSA work there for like five years and he would tell me how it works.
[3:49:22.280 --> 3:49:26.560]  He's like, look, in the last five years I worked here, we never had one real terrorist
[3:49:26.560 --> 3:49:27.560]  threat.
[3:49:27.560 --> 3:49:31.960]  Like every time that weapons or quote unquote explosive materials were snuck in, it was
[3:49:31.960 --> 3:49:33.080]  part of a drill.
[3:49:33.080 --> 3:49:37.920]  They would bring it in piece by piece and they would run teams and squads against different
[3:49:37.920 --> 3:49:39.400]  checkpoints and areas.
[3:49:39.400 --> 3:49:43.400]  And he was telling me how they could get them in, but not one real terrorist threat in one
[3:49:43.400 --> 3:49:45.240]  of the biggest airports in the world.
[3:49:45.240 --> 3:49:50.720]  Yet he would say every three to six months, they'd run one of these drills, Amy.
[3:49:50.720 --> 3:49:52.360]  Pretty shocking stuff.
[3:49:52.360 --> 3:49:53.360]  Yeah.
[3:49:53.360 --> 3:49:55.560]  We got one final segment coming up with you, Amy.
[3:49:55.560 --> 3:49:57.960]  Is there any other message that you want to get out there?
[3:49:57.960 --> 3:50:01.200]  You want to talk to the people you want to let people know where they can find, you know,
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:02.200]  Amy Allen stuff?
[3:50:02.200 --> 3:50:07.800]  Well, they can, um, once again, the name is called A I M E E A L L E N.
[3:50:07.800 --> 3:50:11.480]  They can go to my, my space, my space.com back slash Amy Allen.
[3:50:11.480 --> 3:50:19.160]  Um, I have a radio show every Sunday on Indie 103.1 FM in Los Angeles, suicide girls radio.
[3:50:19.160 --> 3:50:26.120]  We talk a lot about, um, the issues, uh, it on the 22nd, June 22nd, we're having a debate,
[3:50:26.120 --> 3:50:31.800]  a global warming debate, uh, where, um, I call it a, this dwindle in a forest and a
[3:50:31.800 --> 3:50:32.800]  lie.
[3:50:32.800 --> 3:50:36.440]  And, uh, we've got some UCLA panelists that are, you know, hold right there.
[3:50:36.440 --> 3:50:40.000]  It's info wars.com, prisonplanet.com, it's the Alex Jones show.
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:46.280]  Final segment up next.
[3:50:46.280 --> 3:50:49.480]  If you're an adult male, you need to listen to this information.
[3:50:49.480 --> 3:50:53.580]  By the age of 60, half of all men have a prostate related problem.
[3:50:53.580 --> 3:50:58.720]  In the past, many men have turned to saw Palmetto to support prostate health, but now there's
[3:50:58.720 --> 3:51:00.200]  something much better.
[3:51:00.200 --> 3:51:05.720]  It's called beta prostate beta prostate contains 3000 times more healthy plant sterols than
[3:51:05.720 --> 3:51:07.320]  ordinary saw Palmetto.
[3:51:07.320 --> 3:51:11.480]  In fact, you'd have to take a hundred saw Palmetto capsules to get the same benefits
[3:51:11.480 --> 3:51:13.560]  of one dose of beta prostate.
[3:51:13.560 --> 3:51:18.120]  It's guaranteed to provide noticeable support even if you're already having prostate related
[3:51:18.120 --> 3:51:19.120]  health issues.
[3:51:19.120 --> 3:51:23.360]  Now you can get Roger Mason's beta prostate formula through this special offer.
[3:51:23.360 --> 3:51:27.960]  And if you call now, you'll learn how to get a free bottle of beta prostate with your order.
[3:51:27.960 --> 3:51:29.920]  Feel a difference or your money back.

[3:51:42.680 --> 3:51:50.800]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes the
[3:51:50.800 --> 3:51:56.920]  long awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two hour film that completely
[3:51:56.920 --> 3:51:59.400]  destroys the official fable forever.
[3:51:59.400 --> 3:52:03.680]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[3:52:03.680 --> 3:52:08.480]  family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[3:52:08.480 --> 3:52:10.400]  crime are brought to justice.
[3:52:10.400 --> 3:52:13.920]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[3:52:13.920 --> 3:52:18.360]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change
[3:52:18.360 --> 3:52:21.680]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[3:52:21.680 --> 3:52:27.200]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.

[3:52:31.120 --> 3:52:36.200]  films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds
[3:52:36.200 --> 3:52:37.200]  of other titles.
[3:52:37.200 --> 3:52:40.160]  We're in a no holds bar information war.
[3:52:40.160 --> 3:52:41.160]  This is our weapon.
[3:52:41.160 --> 3:52:48.720]  And PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[3:52:48.720 --> 3:52:53.040]  Once America was led by real politicians, now politicians in the US, city, county,
[3:52:53.040 --> 3:52:56.080]  state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[3:52:56.080 --> 3:52:58.960]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[3:52:58.960 --> 3:53:02.360]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels
[3:53:02.360 --> 3:53:03.360]  in history.
[3:53:03.360 --> 3:53:06.320]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[3:53:06.320 --> 3:53:09.520]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[3:53:09.520 --> 3:53:13.440]  Food riots and bread lines occur daily in 30 nations and not only is that list growing,
[3:53:13.440 --> 3:53:14.560]  but it's headed this way.
[3:53:14.560 --> 3:53:18.680]  Survival enterprises are massive distributors of the highest quality long term storage foods.
[3:53:18.680 --> 3:53:22.400]  Mountain House freeze dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon, spices,
[3:53:22.400 --> 3:53:23.520]  cheese, fruit, and more.
[3:53:23.520 --> 3:53:25.400]  We have tons of food in stock now.

[3:54:08.160 --> 3:54:21.080]  We'll be back with you on Monday.
[3:54:21.080 --> 3:54:24.680]  You can check out the refeed of this broadcast over at infowars.com.
[3:54:24.680 --> 3:54:27.240]  We're going to be replaying all four hours.
[3:54:27.240 --> 3:54:29.800]  Some powerful stuff we had Jesse Benton on.
[3:54:29.800 --> 3:54:33.640]  Of course, this conversation with Amy Allen has been extraordinary.
[3:54:33.640 --> 3:54:35.800]  Alex has checked in several times from Bilderberg.
[3:54:35.800 --> 3:54:38.120]  We had Luke Radowski, Rob Jacobson.
[3:54:38.120 --> 3:54:41.200]  We had Philly 9-11 Truth, just another power pack show.
[3:54:41.200 --> 3:54:44.920]  And in the beginning of the first hour, we went over, I'd say, about 25 to 30 of the
[3:54:44.920 --> 3:54:49.480]  members that are at the Bilderberg conference as we speak, deciding our fate.
[3:54:49.480 --> 3:54:52.400]  And we went over the press release, the first press release ever.
[3:54:52.400 --> 3:54:53.400]  Good.
[3:54:53.400 --> 3:54:55.840]  They can read over the press release while they listen to the iPods we bought them.
[3:54:55.840 --> 3:54:57.240]  That's just wonderful.
[3:54:57.240 --> 3:55:00.640]  Amy, you have a show over in LA.
[3:55:00.640 --> 3:55:03.480]  You're putting out a new album independently.
[3:55:03.480 --> 3:55:05.160]  Can we expect you on tour anytime soon?
[3:55:05.160 --> 3:55:07.240]  Are you going to be traveling around, performing?
[3:55:07.240 --> 3:55:08.240]  Yeah.
[3:55:08.240 --> 3:55:12.600]  After I record the album, I'm going to, of course, I'm going to be touring the city
[3:55:12.600 --> 3:55:13.600]  near you.
[3:55:13.600 --> 3:55:19.400]  And just shining my light, just speaking the truth wherever I can.
[3:55:19.400 --> 3:55:28.480]  On the radio show, on my blogs, in my music, I find that literally just being inundated
[3:55:28.480 --> 3:55:33.080]  with the lies and mainstream media, and just when I watched what they did to Ron Paul and
[3:55:33.080 --> 3:55:36.680]  just not cover him at all, it literally devastated me.
[3:55:36.680 --> 3:55:45.520]  To the point where I had to just really attach myself to the real freedom that I was searching
[3:55:45.520 --> 3:55:50.840]  for, which is God, the real freedom, the true freedom that I have found.
[3:55:50.840 --> 3:55:56.320]  And I had to turn off my TV, I had to stop watching the news because it was killing me.
[3:55:56.320 --> 3:55:58.480]  It was just killing me.
[3:55:58.480 --> 3:56:04.360]  So I can get it out there, I can release what has happened and what is happening not only
[3:56:04.360 --> 3:56:10.760]  to America, but spiritually to the world, through my music, and that's my assignment.
[3:56:10.760 --> 3:56:15.200]  Well, you're one of the most well-rounded, well-educated guests we've ever had on this
[3:56:15.200 --> 3:56:20.540]  show, especially if you're going to be throwing a debate up on the 22nd, rebuking the global
[3:56:20.540 --> 3:56:21.540]  warming line.
[3:56:21.540 --> 3:56:25.240]  No one's saying that climate doesn't change, the earth doesn't go through cycles, but they're
[3:56:25.240 --> 3:56:29.840]  trying to say that we've destroyed the ozone layer and now we have to pay for it, literally
[3:56:29.840 --> 3:56:30.840]  pay for it.
[3:56:30.840 --> 3:56:32.600]  We literally have to pay for it.
[3:56:32.600 --> 3:56:35.320]  We're going to have to pay for the air we breathe, the house we live in, the cars we
[3:56:35.320 --> 3:56:37.880]  own, and it's going to be carbon credits.
[3:56:37.880 --> 3:56:43.360]  I'm so glad Al Gore is out there for the other side with Leo DiCaprio and all these celebrities
[3:56:43.360 --> 3:56:46.160]  telling us about another global Armageddon.
[3:56:46.160 --> 3:56:51.960]  Yeah, that people are the cause of all of our problems.
[3:56:51.960 --> 3:56:53.840]  Of course, yeah, people have to go.
[3:56:53.840 --> 3:56:56.200]  They don't like the fact that there's six and a half billion of us.
[3:56:56.200 --> 3:56:59.920]  They'd rather cut that number down quite significantly.
[3:56:59.920 --> 3:57:04.000]  I want you to think about that, folks, six and a half billion people.
[3:57:04.000 --> 3:57:09.400]  Some people have discussed they want half a billion as the population, maybe even a
[3:57:09.400 --> 3:57:10.400]  billion.
[3:57:10.400 --> 3:57:13.800]  Are you going to be lucky enough to be the one out of six?
[3:57:13.800 --> 3:57:15.200]  Probably not.
[3:57:15.200 --> 3:57:17.960]  If you are lucky enough to be the one out of six, who says that you're not going to
[3:57:17.960 --> 3:57:22.160]  be in their little FEMA camps that Halliburton built for them and they move their company
[3:57:22.160 --> 3:57:24.600]  to Dubai?
[3:57:24.600 --> 3:57:26.640]  It's gone well beyond the pale.
[3:57:26.640 --> 3:57:30.280]  Have you by chance seen that, I know the Flowbots are pretty popular right now, they're
[3:57:30.280 --> 3:57:31.280]  all over.
[3:57:31.280 --> 3:57:32.440]  Have you seen their music video yet?
[3:57:32.440 --> 3:57:33.440]  No.
[3:57:33.440 --> 3:57:38.040]  Oh man, we had them on a couple of weeks ago just because I came across the music video
[3:57:38.040 --> 3:57:39.040]  and I showed it to Alex.
[3:57:39.040 --> 3:57:41.800]  I had them on for an hour, but it shows people are waking up.
[3:57:41.800 --> 3:57:43.840]  It's total anti-police state stuff.
[3:57:43.840 --> 3:57:50.960]  I want people to check out Amy Allen, that's A-I-M-E-E, A-I-M-E-E Allen, and she's got a
[3:57:50.960 --> 3:57:53.440]  MySpace website and a radio show.
[3:57:53.440 --> 3:57:55.840]  Amy, any last words?
[3:57:55.840 --> 3:58:00.600]  Well, thanks for being with us, she's been an awesome guest and this has been just a
[3:58:00.600 --> 3:58:02.280]  great week for me, remember?
[3:58:02.280 --> 3:58:06.560]  The reef feeds over at infowars.com, the money beyond 240 grand folks, we're going to try
[3:58:06.560 --> 3:58:09.080]  to make it 250, keep it open this weekend.

[3:58:44.080 --> 3:58:47.880]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up, it is essential that
[3:58:47.880 --> 3:58:51.880]  patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order
[3:58:51.880 --> 3:58:52.880]  master plan.
