[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.853]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, here we go!
[00:00:04.853 --> 00:00:06.175]  It is Friday, June 6, 2008.
[00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:07.436]  I am not Alex Jones.
[00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:07.876]  I am
[00:00:22.577 --> 00:00:23.818]  Subbing in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:25.459]  Today, I think, is my last day.
[00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:28.160]  Alex will be back on Sunday, but we got huge Bilderberg news.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.781]  I mean, massive Bilderberg news.
[00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:37.705]  Let's just start off, before we even get into that, with Obama and Hillary meeting in D.C.
[00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:40.086]  the night that the conference starts to kick off.
[00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:41.187]  Everybody's there.
[00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:43.088]  All of a sudden, they're meeting at their house in D.C.
[00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:44.829]  Yeah, right.
[00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.530]  So here's what went on.
[00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.991]  The elites are in town.
[00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:50.912]  Hillary has conceded.
[00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:57.337]  There's a big sit-down, and I'm gonna bet dollars to donuts you're gonna get your Obama Hilldog ticket.
[00:00:57.337 --> 00:00:58.458]  I really think so.
[00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.298]  Maybe not.
[00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:01.038]  I could be wrong.
[00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:04.879]  But boy, did they choose a hell of a time to have a meeting in D.C.
[00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.820]  Her place in D.C.
[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.080]  All right.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.961]  Now, the Bilderberg Conference has been blown up so much.
[00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:13.561]  I guess the Marriott's getting a bunch of calls.
[00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:15.241]  They don't know what to do.
[00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.862]  So this is what they did.
[00:01:16.862 --> 00:01:17.562]  They put a spin
[00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:25.387]  On what the Bilderberg Conference was going to be covering by actually putting out their first ever official press release that I know of.
[00:01:25.387 --> 00:01:28.149]  Ridiculous.
[00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.150]  I couldn't make this stuff up.
[00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.551]  You go to businesswire.com.
[00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:31.432]  Totally legit site.
[00:01:31.432 --> 00:01:33.353]  It has a good Alexa rating and everything else.
[00:01:33.353 --> 00:01:36.736]  I checked it out myself to make sure this wasn't a hoax from somebody.
[00:01:36.736 --> 00:01:37.817]  Let's just read it.
[00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:39.138]  Coming out of Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:01:39.138 --> 00:01:44.142]  The 56th Bilderberg meeting will be held in Chantilly, Virginia, USA from the 5th to 8th of June, 2008.
[00:01:45.777 --> 00:01:48.539]  The conference will deal mainly with a nuclear-free world.
[00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.001]  See?
[00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:52.422]  It's good they're having this conference.
[00:01:52.422 --> 00:01:55.444]  Wait, cyber-terrorism, and we're gonna get into that big time.
[00:01:55.444 --> 00:01:56.925]  Cyber-terrorism.
[00:01:56.925 --> 00:01:58.486]  Oh my god.
[00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:02.949]  Africa, Russia, finance, protectionism, US-EU relations.
[00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:03.509]  See?
[00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.771]  Now it's US-EU relations.
[00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:10.714]  It's not, uh... Oh man, European Union, baby.
[00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:12.312]  You better believe it.
[00:02:12.312 --> 00:02:15.493]  Afghanistan and Pakistan, of course.
[00:02:15.493 --> 00:02:17.194]  Oh, I like how Pakistan's on the table.
[00:02:17.194 --> 00:02:17.675]  That's nice.
[00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:18.815]  Maybe Estelon's right.
[00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:22.817]  We're going to be talking to Daniel Estelon, by the way, at 1.30.
[00:02:22.817 --> 00:02:24.939]  And Jesse Benton's coming up in a half an hour.
[00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.180]  We're going to play him a little video because we have Amy Allen of MTV on.
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.201]  This is a big show, folks.
[00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:32.663]  And of course, Alex is going to be calling in from Bilderberg.
[00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:33.223]  All right.
[00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:35.985]  So approximately 140 participants will attend.
[00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:37.366]  That's 125 members.
[00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:39.487]  And then there are 15 buddies that they bring in.
[00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:41.099]  There might be a few more.
[00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.421]  Remember, they got iPods in Build-A-Bird 2008.
[00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:45.642]  We went over that yesterday.
[00:02:45.642 --> 00:02:46.542]  That's really nice.
[00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:47.763]  The DOJ bought them for them.
[00:02:47.763 --> 00:02:50.064]  In other words, we bought them for them with our tax dollars.
[00:02:50.064 --> 00:02:51.505]  Great.
[00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:53.967]  Of whom about two-thirds come from Europe.
[00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:56.028]  About two-thirds of these guys are from Europe.
[00:02:56.028 --> 00:02:58.389]  And the balance from North America.
[00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.810]  Of course.
[00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.132]  About one-third is from government and politics.
[00:03:02.132 --> 00:03:06.594]  And two-thirds are from finance, industry, labor, education, and communications.
[00:03:06.594 --> 00:03:07.735]  The meeting is private.
[00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:11.450]  In order to encourage frank and open discussions.
[00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.992]  In other words, it's private because you don't get to know.
[00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:20.454]  So they can plot against you, the American citizen.
[00:03:20.454 --> 00:03:21.695]  This should be an open forum.
[00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:23.636]  If it was legit, it would be an open forum.
[00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:24.396]  This is garbage.
[00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:30.718]  Bilderberg takes its name from the hotel in Holland where the first meeting took place in May of 1954.
[00:03:30.718 --> 00:03:42.605]  That pioneering meeting grew out of the concern expressed by leading citizens on both sides of the Atlantic that Western Europe and North America were not working together as closely as they should on common problems of critical importance.
[00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:45.087]  You see, when it first started, it didn't exist.
[00:03:45.087 --> 00:03:47.608]  Even ten years ago, it didn't exist.
[00:03:47.608 --> 00:03:51.251]  It was just something people talked about, kooks.
[00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:54.052]  And now it does exist, and now they set policy there.
[00:03:54.052 --> 00:03:54.973]  It's totally illegal!
[00:03:56.334 --> 00:03:59.355]  You know, Jones went over this, but it is a violation of the Logan Act.
[00:03:59.355 --> 00:04:00.675]  It's treason!
[00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:01.115]  Okay?
[00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:05.476]  You can't go over U.S.
[00:04:05.476 --> 00:04:10.298]  foreign and domestic policy with people from other nations with other interests.
[00:04:10.298 --> 00:04:11.658]  And these are the heads of industry, folks.
[00:04:11.658 --> 00:04:12.938]  In fact, we already have the Bilderberg list.
[00:04:12.938 --> 00:04:16.519]  We're going to go over some of the people that are meeting there right now.
[00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.721]  I mean, this is just incredible that they can't even keep it under wraps, so they're trying to put a positive spin on it.
[00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:22.201]  It's garbage.
[00:04:22.822 --> 00:04:33.327]  It was felt that regular, off-the-record discussions would help create a better understanding of the complex forces and major trends affecting Western nations in the difficult post-war period.
[00:04:33.327 --> 00:04:34.908]  We're going to read the rest of this on the other side.
[00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:36.228]  Alex is going to be calling in.
[00:04:36.228 --> 00:04:37.489]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:38.549]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:39.290]  LooseChange911.com.
[00:04:54.003 --> 00:04:55.425]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:58.227]  A new world order.
[00:04:58.227 --> 00:04:59.208]  In the near future.
[00:04:59.997 --> 00:05:02.598]  The Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:05.959]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:08.740]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.921]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:19.244]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.714]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:27.714 --> 00:05:31.116]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:54.612]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[00:05:54.612 --> 00:05:58.294]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[00:05:58.294 --> 00:06:04.338]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[00:06:04.338 --> 00:06:08.400]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.883]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[00:06:13.143 --> 00:06:17.828]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:21.872]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[00:06:21.872 --> 00:06:24.494]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[00:06:24.494 --> 00:06:29.800]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.463]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[00:06:33.463 --> 00:06:36.046]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[00:06:36.226 --> 00:06:39.007]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[00:06:39.007 --> 00:06:40.928]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling!
[00:06:40.928 --> 00:06:42.508]  Jesus is coming soon!
[00:06:42.508 --> 00:06:45.709]  For free materials call 888-211-1715 or write The Bible Says, Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771.
[00:06:52.762 --> 00:06:56.283]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:06:56.283 --> 00:07:01.684]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:07:01.684 --> 00:07:06.825]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:17.948]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:07:18.348 --> 00:07:24.132]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:07:24.132 --> 00:07:30.397]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:07:30.397 --> 00:07:31.437]  What about you?
[00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:33.439]  Order your KDF shower filter normally.
[00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:37.462]  Forty nine dollars for a special price of only thirty nine ninety nine with free shipping.
[00:07:37.862 --> 00:07:41.826]  Call the Berkey Guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[00:07:41.826 --> 00:07:47.171]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[00:07:53.878 --> 00:07:59.424]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:04.060]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.342]  And I just want to point out again, the Bilderberg is being so exposed.
[00:08:07.342 --> 00:08:09.984]  They put out this press release we're in the middle of.
[00:08:09.984 --> 00:08:11.245]  The list is already out.
[00:08:11.245 --> 00:08:14.347]  Alex is going to be calling in from the conference in Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:08:14.347 --> 00:08:20.832]  Remember, Barack Obama and Hill Dog, Hillary Clinton, met last night, supposedly at her house in D.C.
[00:08:20.832 --> 00:08:22.153]  It might have been at her house in D.C.
[00:08:22.153 --> 00:08:24.594]  with a couple of Bilderberg attendees coming in.
[00:08:24.594 --> 00:08:26.956]  Let me break down how this is going to work.
[00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:29.818]  Now, this weekend, a lot of policy is going to be set.
[00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:39.162]  And these 125, 140 elites or so are in the upper echelon, not the uppermost, but most of them, some of them are in the uppermost.
[00:08:39.162 --> 00:08:48.969]  Most of them are pretty high up, and what they'll do is they'll disperse their agenda this summer at the Bohemian Grove when there's about 3,000 attendees, and they'll do this in a compartmentalized style.
[00:08:48.969 --> 00:08:59.516]  A lot of people who are in the Bohemian Grove obviously aren't all hardcore, you know, pagans and Satan worshippers and into, you know, mystic Babylonian nonsense, but at the upper echelons they are.
[00:09:00.493 --> 00:09:08.818]  And, uh, through this 140, they'll disperse the agenda to this 3,000, who will then disperse it to their minions and so on, only giving each of them part of the picture.
[00:09:08.818 --> 00:09:09.578]  And that's how it works.
[00:09:12.188 --> 00:09:13.549]  So, let's get back into this.
[00:09:13.549 --> 00:09:29.458]  They're now saying the Cold War has now ended, but in practically all respects, there are more, not fewer, common problems from trade to jobs, from monetary policy to investment, from ecological challenges to the task of promoting international security.
[00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:32.700]  Yeah, so David Rockefeller should be there to groom everybody, obviously.
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.681]  It's a good thing we have this Bilderberg meeting.
[00:09:35.183 --> 00:09:43.870]  It is hard to think of any major issue in either Europe or North America whose unilateral solution would not have repercussions for the other.
[00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:50.395]  Thus, the concept of a European-American forum has not been overtaken by time.
[00:09:50.395 --> 00:09:54.638]  The dialogue between these two regions is still, even increasingly, critical.
[00:09:55.216 --> 00:09:56.437]  Bilderberg is critical.
[00:09:56.437 --> 00:09:57.998]  We need Bilderberg.
[00:09:57.998 --> 00:10:04.923]  No, they need Bilderberg so they can work behind the scenes and have the media totally black out what their agenda is going to be for the next 12 months.
[00:10:04.923 --> 00:10:06.304]  God.
[00:10:06.304 --> 00:10:20.734]  What is unique about Bilderberg as a forum is the broad cross-section of leading citizens that are assembled for nearly three days of informal and off-the-record discussion about topics of current concern, especially in the fields of foreign affairs and the international economy.
[00:10:21.226 --> 00:10:21.366]  Yeah.
[00:10:21.366 --> 00:10:23.327]  So they can say, you know what?
[00:10:23.327 --> 00:10:24.929]  I think we should kill 50% of the population.
[00:10:24.929 --> 00:10:25.429]  You know what?
[00:10:25.429 --> 00:10:26.490]  Let's release biological weapons.
[00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:26.950]  Let's do that.
[00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.071]  I'm glad I can say that openly.
[00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:53.410]  Because the media is not going to cover me.
[00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:54.171]  Disgusting.
[00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:55.311]  Let's talk about the chip.
[00:10:55.311 --> 00:10:56.372]  Let's start chipping people.
[00:10:56.372 --> 00:10:57.132]  You know what?
[00:10:57.132 --> 00:10:58.333]  Mexico?
[00:10:58.333 --> 00:11:06.317]  I was pretty happy with that decision to get rid of passports and start chipping people from Guatemala who want to come in legally.
[00:11:06.317 --> 00:11:07.477]  Oh, you didn't hear about that?
[00:11:07.477 --> 00:11:11.079]  It's only on once on CNN on Lou Dobbs when he was out for the night.
[00:11:11.079 --> 00:11:13.020]  We'll play that clip later.
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:13.801]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:16.422]  That was back in January they were starting to make that decision.
[00:11:17.284 --> 00:11:18.404]  But it's behind closed doors.
[00:11:18.404 --> 00:11:21.805]  There's no other reason than to speak openly.
[00:11:21.805 --> 00:11:23.226]  It's because these guys aren't elected officials.
[00:11:23.226 --> 00:11:24.386]  Look.
[00:11:24.386 --> 00:11:25.726]  Some of them are elected officials.
[00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:27.807]  Some of them are cabinet members.
[00:11:27.807 --> 00:11:31.508]  Most of them are the heads of business and industry, and we're going to go over some names.
[00:11:31.508 --> 00:11:34.329]  Let me just tell you some straight-up names who are there right now.
[00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:36.049]  Condi Rice is there, okay?
[00:11:36.049 --> 00:11:37.410]  Paul Wolfowitz is there.
[00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.270]  Those are two names you know.
[00:11:40.905 --> 00:11:42.766]  Now, occasionally they have to bring other people in.
[00:11:42.766 --> 00:11:44.888]  That's why the CEO of Google is there.
[00:11:44.888 --> 00:11:46.209]  Yeah, don't be evil.
[00:11:46.209 --> 00:11:47.750]  That used to be their slogan.
[00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.893]  It'll probably still be their slogan, only it's bull.
[00:11:50.893 --> 00:11:54.575]  Caught them censoring our videos, God.
[00:11:54.575 --> 00:12:04.062]  In short, Bilderberg is a small, flexible, informal, and off-the-record international forum in which different viewpoints can be expressed and mutual understanding enhanced.
[00:12:04.062 --> 00:12:07.905]  See, this is what me and G. Edward Griffin were talking about yesterday in the last hour.
[00:12:07.905 --> 00:12:09.246]  Listen to the language.
[00:12:09.246 --> 00:12:10.147]  The positive spin.
[00:12:10.714 --> 00:12:13.117]  It all sounds really nice, doesn't it?
[00:12:13.117 --> 00:12:14.678]  Oh, we're there for your own good!
[00:12:14.678 --> 00:12:16.740]  It's garbage!
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.424]  Bilderberg's only activity is its annual conference.
[00:12:20.424 --> 00:12:22.727]  At the meetings, no resolutions are proposed.
[00:12:22.727 --> 00:12:23.828]  Nonsense.
[00:12:23.828 --> 00:12:24.849]  No votes taken.
[00:12:24.849 --> 00:12:25.770]  Nonsense.
[00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.792]  And no policy statements issued.
[00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:29.934]  Well, yeah, they don't issue any policy statements there.
[00:12:29.934 --> 00:12:30.695]  You're right.
[00:12:30.695 --> 00:12:33.458]  They keep it kind of hidden, and they disperse the policy statements for later.
[00:12:34.495 --> 00:12:38.298]  Since 1954, 55 conferences have been held.
[00:12:38.298 --> 00:12:40.939]  The names of the participants are made available to the press.
[00:12:40.939 --> 00:12:42.960]  That's not true.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.341]  That's not true at all!
[00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:48.964]  Jim Tucker, for 30 plus years, has had to get the names from inside sources.
[00:12:48.964 --> 00:12:50.765]  Now they're being made available to the press.
[00:12:50.765 --> 00:12:54.367]  Participants are chosen from their experience, their knowledge, and their standing.
[00:12:54.367 --> 00:12:59.110]  All participants attend Bilderberg in a private and not an official capacity.
[00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.393]  See, they try to cover their own ass there again, saying, well, these guys aren't really representing
[00:13:03.854 --> 00:13:10.801]  The organizations they own and run, they're there for them.
[00:13:10.801 --> 00:13:12.642]  There will be no press conference.
[00:13:12.642 --> 00:13:15.425]  A list of participants is available by phone request.
[00:13:15.425 --> 00:13:19.489]  And I'm not going to give out the phone number because we already have the list.
[00:13:19.489 --> 00:13:20.550]  God.
[00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.131]  So let's look at this.
[00:13:22.131 --> 00:13:23.853]  Again, the CEO of Google.
[00:13:23.853 --> 00:13:26.636]  And remember, we talked about cyber terrorism.
[00:13:26.636 --> 00:13:27.757]  They're going to be talking about that.
[00:13:27.757 --> 00:13:29.138]  Well, they're already running war games.
[00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:39.713]  Where anti-globalist hackers, yeah that's right, anti-globalist hackers, not terrorists, people that are against globalism, shut down the infrastructure of the government.
[00:13:39.713 --> 00:13:40.814]  Come on.
[00:13:40.814 --> 00:13:44.255]  The only way they would do that is if you encroached on their freedoms.
[00:13:44.255 --> 00:13:48.536]  If you tried to round us up in camps, in the nice little FEMA camps you built.
[00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:53.778]  And it would probably be a totally orchestrated event where some of their assets, because you know the government loves to do that.
[00:13:53.778 --> 00:13:57.659]  You know, these hacker guys, most of these guys are good guys, but the ones that are really, really good at it,
[00:13:58.234 --> 00:14:03.895]  And do end up getting caught and usually end up getting recruited by our intelligence services.
[00:14:03.895 --> 00:14:05.035]  They'd be fools not to.
[00:14:05.035 --> 00:14:06.636]  These guys know code like the back of their hand.
[00:14:06.636 --> 00:14:08.316]  They can write a bunch of stuff.
[00:14:08.316 --> 00:14:10.477]  They can tell you how things get hacked.
[00:14:10.477 --> 00:14:12.057]  A lot of these guys get recruited.
[00:14:12.057 --> 00:14:15.198]  It's common knowledge.
[00:14:15.198 --> 00:14:20.679]  But they'll set them up as the next terrorist because that means the population at large, anybody could be a hacker.
[00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:22.679]  Anybody who knows how to use a computer.
[00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:23.639]  God forbid.
[00:14:23.639 --> 00:14:26.180]  And it's also another great excuse to bring in the internet too.
[00:14:27.148 --> 00:14:32.612]  Where we'll all be forced to thumb scan on our little keyboard to make sure it's us.
[00:14:32.612 --> 00:14:39.016]  And then we'll get on the internet and there'll be about, you know, maybe 10 to 20 main sites owned by corporations and universities.
[00:14:39.016 --> 00:14:42.178]  And then they'll have the little subdomain pages.
[00:14:42.178 --> 00:14:46.321]  And if we're good little slaves and we have the content that they like, they'll let us post there.
[00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:48.342]  But if we're not, they'll just pull it.
[00:14:48.342 --> 00:14:49.323]  Gone.
[00:14:49.323 --> 00:14:49.803]  I mean, Google...
[00:14:50.529 --> 00:14:51.529]  Google, you used to be good.
[00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:52.250]  You used to have a top 100.
[00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.231]  You used to show the statistics of your videos.
[00:14:55.231 --> 00:14:57.171]  Okay, now you can't even see how many people have viewed it.
[00:14:57.171 --> 00:14:59.032]  They did that on purpose, folks.
[00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:04.714]  Not only can't you see how many people have viewed it, but they took away the embed feature for most videos.
[00:15:04.714 --> 00:15:06.674]  After a certain point, you can't embed them.
[00:15:06.674 --> 00:15:08.415]  What's up with that?
[00:15:08.415 --> 00:15:13.897]  You know, it was so much easier when I could just embed all the loose changes everywhere, but they made it more difficult.
[00:15:13.897 --> 00:15:16.317]  Thank you, Google.
[00:15:16.317 --> 00:15:17.678]  And really, it just disgusts me.
[00:15:19.722 --> 00:15:26.864]  That a fledgling corporation that came up from nothing, that became the second biggest internet site, I think Yahoo beats it and that's it.
[00:15:26.864 --> 00:15:30.164]  And they really, it's probably, it's tough to say.
[00:15:30.164 --> 00:15:34.425]  I'd say it's close to the biggest site of all time.
[00:15:34.425 --> 00:15:38.266]  And they start out with a slogan of don't be evil, well they're evil.
[00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:43.067]  They're attending this little conference and they're making big time decisions about you and I.
[00:15:44.228 --> 00:15:47.571]  And let's just, let's go through some of these guys, alright?
[00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:54.475]  Let's see, out of Belgium, we have the Vice Chairman of something I can't pronounce, Etienne Davigon.
[00:15:54.475 --> 00:16:00.960]  Let's see, we've got Joseph Ackerman, the Chairman of the Management Board and Group of Executive Committees of the Deutsche Bank.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.841]  Everybody knows about the Deutsche Bank!
[00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:05.343]  So the Deutsche Bank's in the house, that's nice.
[00:16:05.343 --> 00:16:11.567]  John Adams is the Associate Deputy Minister of National Defense and Chief of Communication Security in Canada.
[00:16:11.567 --> 00:16:11.968]  He's there!
[00:16:13.148 --> 00:16:14.889]  That's nice.
[00:16:14.889 --> 00:16:15.550]  Let's see.
[00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:20.453]  We have Fawad Aljahami, the Middle East Studies Program.
[00:16:20.453 --> 00:16:24.676]  We've got somebody from the John Hopkins University Institute over there.
[00:16:24.676 --> 00:16:29.719]  We've got Keith B. Alexander of the National Security Agency in the U.S.
[00:16:29.719 --> 00:16:30.580]  That's nice.
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.961]  He'll go well with Condi.
[00:16:31.961 --> 00:16:32.981]  Who knows what they got planned for her?
[00:16:32.981 --> 00:16:34.762]  She's probably got another cabinet spot.
[00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:39.245]  People have talked about her for VP, but I think that would be suicide for anybody.
[00:16:39.245 --> 00:16:41.147]  I don't think they could put her on a ticket.
[00:16:41.147 --> 00:16:42.327]  Come on.
[00:16:42.327 --> 00:16:43.028]  Nobody likes her.
[00:16:43.922 --> 00:16:45.862]  God.
[00:16:45.862 --> 00:16:48.783]  Let's see, we got the chairman of Evercore Partners out there.
[00:16:48.783 --> 00:16:53.204]  We got the Minister of Foreign Affairs out of Turkey.
[00:16:53.204 --> 00:16:54.405]  Let's see.
[00:16:54.405 --> 00:16:56.385]  You know, a lot of people have attended these things.
[00:16:56.385 --> 00:17:02.087]  I mean, we have, you know, former Prime Ministers of the UK.
[00:17:02.087 --> 00:17:02.867]  Tony Blair was there.
[00:17:02.867 --> 00:17:04.427]  Gordon Brown went there.
[00:17:04.427 --> 00:17:06.708]  Obviously, Bill Clinton attended the Bilderberg meeting.
[00:17:06.708 --> 00:17:07.968]  He's actually admitted to it now.
[00:17:08.493 --> 00:17:10.574]  Well, I don't know why the press doesn't cover it.
[00:17:10.574 --> 00:17:12.435]  We played that clip yesterday, too.
[00:17:12.435 --> 00:17:16.337]  I don't know why the press doesn't... I haven't been there in 15 years!
[00:17:16.337 --> 00:17:18.078]  He knows why the press doesn't cover this thing.
[00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:21.120]  It's because it's not to be covered, folks.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.201]  It's not to be talked about.
[00:17:22.201 --> 00:17:24.502]  It's not to be spoken about.
[00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:32.346]  And they're giving out a limited... I can't believe they put out a press release, but I guess they have to because there's so many people outside.
[00:17:32.346 --> 00:17:33.347]  It can no longer be hidden.
[00:17:34.437 --> 00:17:38.399]  And I'm wondering how they're going to spin this Obama-Hillary meeting.
[00:17:38.399 --> 00:17:40.280]  They've already spun it to say it was at her D.C.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.062]  home and probably had nothing to do with Bilderberg.
[00:17:44.062 --> 00:17:48.865]  But I taped a bunch of news for Alex last night and we'll see what they said.
[00:17:48.865 --> 00:17:54.788]  I mean, Gergens, all the top political guys are on there and they already had a sit-down with Obama about the meeting with Hillary.
[00:17:54.788 --> 00:17:58.130]  He's like, yeah, it's going to be the biggest decision of my campaign.
[00:17:59.321 --> 00:18:05.706]  And I've always said that I'm going to spend a lot of time deciding on who's going to be my running mate, if that's the case.
[00:18:05.706 --> 00:18:07.307]  Really?
[00:18:07.307 --> 00:18:11.270]  Oh, Tom Daschle's a- Oh, Tommy D!
[00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:17.635]  I didn't realize Tom Daschle, victim of the anthrax attacks back in 2001, is there.
[00:18:17.635 --> 00:18:19.276]  Well now.
[00:18:19.276 --> 00:18:20.977]  Huh.
[00:18:20.977 --> 00:18:23.679]  That's crazy.
[00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:26.121]  Tom, I just lost a little bit of respect for you, buddy.
[00:18:26.121 --> 00:18:26.862]  Not that I had much.
[00:18:27.568 --> 00:18:32.471]  You know, because it's a controlled left-right paradigm, but I figured you might be one of the semi-good guys.
[00:18:32.471 --> 00:18:33.891]  I mean, this guy's a former U.S.
[00:18:33.891 --> 00:18:37.113]  Senator and Senate Majority Leader.
[00:18:37.113 --> 00:18:37.733]  Wow.
[00:18:37.733 --> 00:18:41.115]  So he's over there, but you notice how he's not in office right now.
[00:18:41.115 --> 00:18:51.501]  See, these guys still maintain a lot of their power and a lot of their influence through the special interests that support them and through the big business that they've become a part of.
[00:18:51.501 --> 00:18:54.082]  You know, we don't have a government for and by the people.
[00:18:54.082 --> 00:18:55.283]  Let me say it again, we don't have
[00:18:55.652 --> 00:18:57.714]  A government for and by the people.
[00:18:57.714 --> 00:18:59.935]  Checks and balances are gone.
[00:18:59.935 --> 00:19:09.983]  You know, the $80,000 to $140,000 a year that these public officials in the upper echelons, in other words, Senate and Congress, that they make is nothing.
[00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:11.924]  That's nothing to them.
[00:19:11.924 --> 00:19:19.730]  They're all millionaires, sometimes billionaires in big business, working with the very same people that put them in office.
[00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.454]  I mean, I guess it's kind of fascism lite, but it's really not that lite anymore.
[00:19:25.524 --> 00:19:30.829]  Oh, the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's there too.
[00:19:30.829 --> 00:19:32.190]  Timothy Gettner.
[00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.931]  No, it's just great.
[00:19:33.931 --> 00:19:35.873]  So glad they're having this private meeting for all of us.
[00:19:35.873 --> 00:19:37.454]  It's wonderful.
[00:19:37.454 --> 00:19:38.595]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:39.917]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:39.917 --> 00:19:41.278]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:55.168 --> 00:19:57.850]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:07.319]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:14.405]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:15.126 --> 00:20:21.113]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.113 --> 00:20:31.905]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:32.686 --> 00:20:33.006]  I think so.
[00:20:54.181 --> 00:20:57.023]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:20:57.023 --> 00:20:58.584]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:20:58.584 --> 00:21:00.745]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:21:00.745 --> 00:21:02.646]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:02.646 --> 00:21:04.127]  The late, great USA.
[00:21:04.127 --> 00:21:05.888]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:21:05.888 --> 00:21:12.932]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:21:53.462 --> 00:21:55.983]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[00:21:55.983 --> 00:21:58.624]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[00:21:58.624 --> 00:22:02.305]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[00:22:20.572 --> 00:22:22.872]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[00:22:22.872 --> 00:22:24.853]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[00:22:24.853 --> 00:22:31.134]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[00:22:31.134 --> 00:22:38.116]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[00:22:38.116 --> 00:22:39.056]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[00:22:39.056 --> 00:22:39.916]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:48.324]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[00:22:48.324 --> 00:22:48.705]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.705 --> 00:22:50.308]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.461]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[00:22:57.461 --> 00:23:02.182]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[00:23:02.182 --> 00:23:07.464]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[00:23:07.464 --> 00:23:18.687]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[00:23:18.687 --> 00:23:21.048]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[00:23:21.468 --> 00:23:23.508]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[00:23:23.508 --> 00:23:24.429]  Let's face it.
[00:23:24.429 --> 00:23:27.249]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[00:23:27.249 --> 00:23:35.270]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.571]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:23:37.571 --> 00:23:40.691]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:23:40.691 --> 00:23:44.752]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:23:44.752 --> 00:23:46.913]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:23:46.913 --> 00:23:49.293]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:23:49.773 --> 00:23:51.394]  And it's safe for all cars.
[00:23:51.394 --> 00:23:51.815]  Act now.
[00:23:51.815 --> 00:24:02.503]  You're back.
[00:24:02.503 --> 00:24:04.684]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:04.684 --> 00:24:07.847]  And you know Henry Kissinger's in the house at Bilderberg.
[00:24:07.847 --> 00:24:08.507]  You betcha.
[00:24:08.507 --> 00:24:09.248]  George Shultz.
[00:24:09.248 --> 00:24:09.968]  Richard Perle.
[00:24:09.968 --> 00:24:10.929]  What's up?
[00:24:10.929 --> 00:24:12.190]  Queen of Spain.
[00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.331]  Queen of the Netherlands.
[00:24:13.331 --> 00:24:13.671]  That's right.
[00:24:13.671 --> 00:24:15.553]  Queen Beatrix is there too.
[00:24:15.553 --> 00:24:15.833]  Awesome.
[00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:18.850]  So they're all going to get together.
[00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:23.011]  Oh, the head of the European Central Bank's there with the head of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.
[00:24:23.011 --> 00:24:24.291]  We've got the, what's that?
[00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:26.412]  The governor of Kansas is out there too.
[00:24:26.412 --> 00:24:26.712]  Awesome.
[00:24:26.712 --> 00:24:30.713]  But David Rockefeller, you know, you know, David's there.
[00:24:30.713 --> 00:24:31.553]  Gotta love it.
[00:24:31.553 --> 00:24:33.213]  George Shultz is there.
[00:24:33.213 --> 00:24:34.914]  Henry Kissinger.
[00:24:34.914 --> 00:24:35.594]  Yeah, Kissinger.
[00:24:35.594 --> 00:24:36.614]  He's a really good guy.
[00:24:36.614 --> 00:24:38.274]  Wanted war criminal in many countries.
[00:24:38.274 --> 00:24:39.495]  No, he's really good.
[00:24:39.495 --> 00:24:46.016]  I'm glad that he's having secret meetings with the upper echelons of power in both North America and Europe.
[00:24:46.016 --> 00:24:46.476]  That's good.
[00:24:47.961 --> 00:24:48.962]  Because they're all just there.
[00:24:48.962 --> 00:24:50.583]  They're not representing anybody.
[00:24:50.583 --> 00:24:55.926]  They're not representing their interests, which are big business and consolidation of power and globalization.
[00:24:55.926 --> 00:24:58.968]  They'd never be doing that.
[00:24:58.968 --> 00:25:00.749]  No press conference, but a press release.
[00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:03.331]  I guess that's more than we've ever gotten before.
[00:25:03.331 --> 00:25:08.494]  I guess that they realize now that this information is going to come out.
[00:25:08.494 --> 00:25:09.755]  The list comes out every year.
[00:25:09.755 --> 00:25:11.236]  They might as well just put it out there.
[00:25:11.236 --> 00:25:13.958]  I mean, they're already getting iPods for everybody from the DOJ.
[00:25:14.619 --> 00:25:34.072]  That's right, Department of Justice, buying iPods for the elite, our tax dollars, giving Bilderberg 2008 engraved iPods to people like Condoleezza Rice, who is, you know, pretty responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions.
[00:25:34.072 --> 00:25:36.073]  Good job, America, huh?
[00:25:36.073 --> 00:25:37.614]  We rock.
[00:25:37.614 --> 00:25:40.196]  We totally and completely rock.
[00:25:41.095 --> 00:25:43.017]  The real question is, are we going to step up?
[00:25:43.017 --> 00:25:46.820]  I know there's a lot of people outside of Bilderberg, but are we going to make this a huge story in the next week?
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.981]  Okay?
[00:25:47.981 --> 00:25:50.223]  Are we going to put this on every single blog we can?
[00:25:50.223 --> 00:25:50.883]  Are we going to dig it?
[00:25:50.883 --> 00:25:52.585]  I know the Digberry Brigade is out there.
[00:25:52.585 --> 00:25:54.527]  Are we going to throw it up on the Huffington Post?
[00:25:54.527 --> 00:25:56.368]  Is Raw Story going to do an article?
[00:25:56.368 --> 00:25:58.290]  Is Counterpunch going to do an article?
[00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.712]  Is Op-Ed going to do an article?
[00:26:00.712 --> 00:26:06.297]  Well, I'll tell you where the best articles are going to be, bar none, and the ones that you have to repost in those places on the comments board.
[00:26:06.297 --> 00:26:07.898]  They're going to be at InfoWars.com,
[00:26:08.186 --> 00:26:15.168]  PrisonPlanet.com and for PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers remember we have the final hour which is going to be with Amy Allen.
[00:26:15.168 --> 00:26:33.633]  I only wish it was in studio and you can watch that on PrisonPlanet.tv for about 15 cents a day which is a great deal again you know you get all of Alex Jones's movies, his weekly access show, and get my documentaries, loose changes up there.
[00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:36.774]  I mean it's a total deal you help support this network
[00:26:37.651 --> 00:26:42.915]  And, uh, I know I was supposed to give the Money Bomb total today, but I haven't talked to Alex yet, and, uh, I don't have a final number.
[00:26:42.915 --> 00:26:52.022]  I think it's... With all the checks, and, uh, all the donations, I believe we did hit around $250,000, or maybe a little bit less.
[00:26:52.022 --> 00:26:54.404]  But that's going towards a new network.
[00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:57.546]  We need your support here, and hopefully we're gonna put that on Dish TV.
[00:26:57.546 --> 00:26:58.807]  We gotta reach the masses.
[00:26:58.807 --> 00:27:03.391]  You know, Al Gore has his little network over there on Current TV, which is a cool little network.
[00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:04.772]  Uh, they don't censor much over there.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:10.262]  The only problem is that Al Gore owns it, and it's all this green agenda too, so they put a lot of propaganda on there.
[00:27:10.262 --> 00:27:12.563]  But there's a lot of good anti-war stuff.
[00:27:12.563 --> 00:27:14.303]  They don't really censor much of it.
[00:27:14.303 --> 00:27:19.245]  I'm a big fan of it, and anybody can be their own journalist, which is what I've always encouraged people to do.
[00:27:19.245 --> 00:27:34.371]  If you don't like the way the system is, if you can't stand what's happening in this country, if you have a tough question to ask a member of Congress, a member of the Senate, a member of the United States Cabinet, a member of Homeland Security,
[00:27:35.376 --> 00:27:36.997]  A member of an intelligence agency.
[00:27:36.997 --> 00:27:40.180]  You know, these spokespeople, these talking heads.
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.103]  A member of the supposed quote-unquote mainstream media that's supposed to be protecting us.
[00:27:44.103 --> 00:27:46.285]  You know, the Sean Hannity's, the Bill O'Reilly's.
[00:27:46.285 --> 00:27:49.148]  Let's not give the left a pass either.
[00:27:49.148 --> 00:27:49.728]  Okay?
[00:27:49.728 --> 00:27:51.149]  You need to get out there.
[00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:52.931]  You need to become the media.
[00:27:52.931 --> 00:27:53.912]  There's no more excuse.
[00:27:53.912 --> 00:27:56.654]  I mean, it's unbelievable how cheap a camcorder is.
[00:27:56.654 --> 00:27:57.895]  If you went on eBay right now,
[00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.713]  And you got like a first or second generation DV cam, which is already pretty small.
[00:28:02.713 --> 00:28:06.675]  You probably got it for like $150, $200, maybe less.
[00:28:06.675 --> 00:28:08.916]  Tapes are $10.
[00:28:08.916 --> 00:28:15.480]  And then it's just the will, the motivation to go to an event, the motivation to have some spine, to stand up for what you believe in.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.702]  And then you post it on YouTube.
[00:28:17.702 --> 00:28:19.943]  You know, you might only get 10 hits at first.
[00:28:19.943 --> 00:28:21.644]  You might get a thousand hits the second time.
[00:28:21.644 --> 00:28:24.126]  You might get a hundred thousand hits eventually.
[00:28:24.126 --> 00:28:26.267]  It's all about believing that you can change the system.
[00:28:26.267 --> 00:28:28.028]  Ron Paul believed he could change the system.
[00:28:28.769 --> 00:28:31.751]  And from what I've seen, he's helped do that.
[00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:35.094]  You know, a lot of people want to dog him out at this point, and I'm not going to be one of them.
[00:28:35.094 --> 00:28:37.175]  We're going to have Jesse Benton, by the way, on.
[00:28:37.175 --> 00:28:40.738]  He's a campaign manager coming up after the break.
[00:28:40.738 --> 00:28:48.264]  I mean, he's a best-selling author with a nonfiction book with manifesto in the title.
[00:28:48.264 --> 00:28:50.085]  And everybody's trying to ignore him.
[00:28:50.085 --> 00:28:54.468]  He raised more money than any other Republican candidate in the race.
[00:28:54.468 --> 00:28:55.529]  He's a true American hero.
[00:28:56.052 --> 00:28:57.413]  He wants to get us out of Iraq.
[00:28:57.413 --> 00:28:59.254]  He wants to get us out of Afghanistan.
[00:28:59.254 --> 00:29:01.255]  He wants smaller government.
[00:29:01.255 --> 00:29:04.878]  He wants a currency that's going to be worth something.
[00:29:04.878 --> 00:29:07.840]  Wow, what a concept!
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:15.264]  He believes in, you know, gold and silver and hard assets, and he believes in personal responsibilities and freedom.
[00:29:15.264 --> 00:29:17.706]  Well, that's what I believe in, too!
[00:29:17.706 --> 00:29:19.707]  So, on the other side of the break, we're going to be having Jesse Benton.
[00:29:19.707 --> 00:29:22.249]  Remember, we have Daniel Escalon coming up.
[00:29:22.249 --> 00:29:23.209]  We also have Amy Allen.
[00:29:23.209 --> 00:29:25.431]  We're going to be taking your calls after Jesse Benton, so
[00:29:26.178 --> 00:29:26.678]  Call on in.
[00:29:26.678 --> 00:29:27.619]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:27.619 --> 00:29:28.639]  I am Jason Bermas.
[00:29:28.639 --> 00:29:44.189]  Infowars.com.
[00:29:44.189 --> 00:29:45.569]  We're on the march.
[00:29:45.569 --> 00:29:48.091]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.091 --> 00:29:50.833]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.650 --> 00:30:00.792]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?

[00:30:53.607 --> 00:31:06.758]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:31:06.758 --> 00:31:17.826]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:31:17.826 --> 00:31:20.048]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose,
[00:31:21.209 --> 00:31:22.970]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:29.114]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:33:11.199 --> 00:33:13.640]  All right folks, we are back!
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.882]  And unfortunately we couldn't get a hold of Jesse Benton.
[00:33:15.882 --> 00:33:18.483]  You know, we do, uh, we get it wrong every once in a while.
[00:33:18.483 --> 00:33:22.885]  Sometimes we have a little, uh, problem contacting people.
[00:33:22.885 --> 00:33:24.126]  But that's all right.
[00:33:24.126 --> 00:33:24.947]  Because, uh, you know what?
[00:33:24.947 --> 00:33:27.328]  I want to play a little bit of music, uh, from the Flo-Bots.
[00:33:27.328 --> 00:33:28.088]  We got a big segment here.
[00:33:28.088 --> 00:33:29.109]  We're going to be taking your calls.
[00:33:29.708 --> 00:33:32.829]  But, uh, you know, we had the Flo-Bots on, I think, two weeks ago now.
[00:33:32.829 --> 00:33:34.550]  Uh, they just rocked the house on Leno.
[00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:37.931]  This is the type of positive music, and Amy Allen's, you know, badass too.
[00:33:37.931 --> 00:33:39.272]  We're gonna play her video.
[00:33:39.272 --> 00:33:42.833]  I was gonna play it for Jesse Benton, but apparently we might not have him on.
[00:33:42.833 --> 00:33:44.294]  Aw, too sad.
[00:33:44.294 --> 00:33:46.355]  Anyway, they rocked the house on Leno last night.
[00:33:46.355 --> 00:33:48.516]  I think the whole album has a great message.
[00:33:48.516 --> 00:33:53.718]  Maybe a little bit left-leaning, but I think that these guys can be pushed into the right direction.
[00:33:53.718 --> 00:33:55.258]  And, uh, kind of it ends.
[00:33:55.258 --> 00:33:55.858]  What do I play?
[00:33:55.858 --> 00:33:57.059]  Do I play We Are Winning?
[00:33:57.631 --> 00:33:58.953]  Or do we play Rise?
[00:33:58.953 --> 00:34:00.575]  Maybe we'll play both of them today.
[00:34:00.575 --> 00:34:06.402]  I'm gonna start off with We Are Winning because it is a cool track and I hope you enjoy.
[00:34:06.402 --> 00:34:13.131]  Remember this is the Alex Jones Show and you can check out all the latest Bilderberg information over at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[00:34:37.259 --> 00:34:42.062]  Rival gangsters sit down to plan an after-school program.
[00:34:42.062 --> 00:34:47.386]  A religious fanatic posts footage of an interfaith service project.
[00:34:48.304 --> 00:34:55.488]  A group of teenage boys watches a video of a father playing catch with his son.
[00:34:55.488 --> 00:35:03.653]  An adult film star paints thumbnail portraits of elderly couples, fully clothed and smiling.
[00:35:03.653 --> 00:35:07.676]  A record executive records a demo of his apology.
[00:35:08.876 --> 00:35:15.681]  A policeman makes reverse 911 calls, instructing residents to take to the streets.
[00:35:15.681 --> 00:35:18.503]  A patriarch reports for duty.
[00:35:18.503 --> 00:35:23.386]  She's wearing an orange jumpsuit and holding a picket sign.
[00:35:23.386 --> 00:35:28.289]  She's ashamed of her birthplace, but retreat is not an option.
[00:35:28.289 --> 00:35:32.352]  Women and children, front line, mark on, tune in, stand and be counted.
[00:35:33.123 --> 00:35:37.745]  Butterfly wing crosswinds send black hawks toward hurricane survivors.
[00:36:00.603 --> 00:36:05.646]  Roses sprout from empty lots and sidewalk cracks.
[00:36:05.646 --> 00:36:11.229]  Pacifist guerrillas move undetected through concrete jungles.
[00:36:11.229 --> 00:36:14.471]  New forms are beginning to take shape.
[00:36:14.471 --> 00:36:17.633]  Once-occupied minds are activating.
[00:36:17.633 --> 00:36:20.375]  People are waking up.
[00:36:20.375 --> 00:36:23.737]  The insurgency is alive and well.
[00:36:23.737 --> 00:36:27.719]  Rise of the full-blown force across the new American insurgency.
[00:36:29.326 --> 00:36:29.646]  We're good.
[00:36:45.318 --> 00:36:52.481]  We are building up a new world.
[00:36:52.481 --> 00:36:54.802]  Do not sit idly by.
[00:36:54.802 --> 00:36:56.943]  Do not remain neutral.
[00:36:56.943 --> 00:37:00.204]  Do not rely on this broadcast alone.
[00:37:00.204 --> 00:37:02.905]  We are only as strong as our signal.
[00:37:04.443 --> 00:37:07.665]  There is a war going on for your mind.
[00:37:07.665 --> 00:37:10.807]  If you are thinking, you are winning.
[00:37:10.807 --> 00:37:13.008]  Resistance is victory.
[00:37:13.008 --> 00:37:15.290]  Defeat is impossible.
[00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.532]  Your weapons are already in hand.
[00:37:18.532 --> 00:37:24.196]  Reach within you and find the means by which to gain your freedom.
[00:37:24.196 --> 00:37:26.297]  Fight with tools.
[00:37:26.297 --> 00:37:30.620]  Your fate and that of everyone you know depends on it.
[00:37:33.169 --> 00:37:34.130]  That's right, folks.
[00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:36.031]  Fight With Tools.
[00:37:36.031 --> 00:37:36.972]  Man, I love that album.
[00:37:36.972 --> 00:37:38.993]  That is, we are winning.
[00:37:38.993 --> 00:37:42.195]  And, uh, I think it really speaks to what we're going through right now.
[00:37:42.195 --> 00:37:43.156]  We need to stand up.
[00:37:43.156 --> 00:37:45.237]  You know, don't rely on this broadcast alone.
[00:37:45.237 --> 00:37:50.581]  Check out, you know, the actual source material that we source in every single one of our articles.
[00:37:50.581 --> 00:37:52.022]  You know, see past the spin.
[00:37:53.177 --> 00:37:54.478]  Start your own network.
[00:37:54.478 --> 00:37:56.019]  Do your own radio show.
[00:37:56.019 --> 00:37:57.020]  Get on the streets.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.681]  Join TruthAction.org.
[00:37:58.681 --> 00:38:00.503]  Start your own chapter of We Are Change.
[00:38:00.503 --> 00:38:02.064]  If you're a student, join Student Scholars.
[00:38:02.064 --> 00:38:04.426]  There's so much we can do.
[00:38:04.426 --> 00:38:04.726]  Okay?
[00:38:04.726 --> 00:38:10.891]  These are the people that are doing what the mainstream media should be doing, but the problem is the mainstream media is at this meeting.
[00:38:10.891 --> 00:38:12.072]  Okay?
[00:38:12.072 --> 00:38:13.093]  Google's huge!
[00:38:13.093 --> 00:38:13.773]  Think about that.
[00:38:13.773 --> 00:38:20.018]  The head of Google's here with the head of the Federal Reserve in New York, David Rockefeller of Chase Bank Manhattan.
[00:38:20.018 --> 00:38:22.120]  I mean, David Rockefeller, folks.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:22.440]  Come on.
[00:38:23.607 --> 00:38:26.628]  Kissinger, George Shultz, he's been going for years.
[00:38:26.628 --> 00:38:28.229]  I think he's a member of the Grove, too.
[00:38:28.229 --> 00:38:36.312]  So he's one of those guys that'll help set policy here and then go to the Grove and kind of dispense all that to everybody else.
[00:38:36.312 --> 00:38:37.613]  It's really nice of them.
[00:38:37.613 --> 00:38:39.193]  Richard Perle, he's a real criminal.
[00:38:39.193 --> 00:38:40.234]  Yep, sure is.
[00:38:40.234 --> 00:38:41.854]  Big-time criminal.
[00:38:41.854 --> 00:38:43.435]  Criminale.
[00:38:43.435 --> 00:38:47.137]  Alright, I said I'd take your call, so let's take Cliff in Louisiana.
[00:38:47.137 --> 00:38:49.457]  Cliff, are you there?
[00:38:49.457 --> 00:38:51.298]  You with me, Cliff?
[00:38:51.298 --> 00:38:52.719]  No, did he?
[00:38:52.719 --> 00:38:53.319]  Maybe he dropped.
[00:38:53.809 --> 00:38:57.270]  All right, we'll keep moving on.
[00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:00.030]  Let's go to Tony in Indiana.
[00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:01.891]  Tony, with me?
[00:39:01.891 --> 00:39:02.691]  Oh, this is just terrible.
[00:39:02.691 --> 00:39:03.231]  Can you hear me?
[00:39:03.231 --> 00:39:04.051]  Yeah.
[00:39:04.051 --> 00:39:04.791]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:39:04.791 --> 00:39:05.531]  Good, man.
[00:39:05.531 --> 00:39:09.692]  Hey, I've got two ideas for fighting the New World Order, and I want to see what your thoughts of them are.
[00:39:09.692 --> 00:39:10.553]  Let's hear it.
[00:39:10.553 --> 00:39:15.694]  All right, first one, I think we need some sort of registry or database so that people can go on.
[00:39:15.694 --> 00:39:22.195]  And I know we've got to do this the right way, but people can go on and register and say, I will never commit suicide, kind of like the DC Madam thing.
[00:39:22.734 --> 00:39:24.214]  I will never commit suicide.
[00:39:24.214 --> 00:39:27.055]  If something happens to me, look into it.
[00:39:27.055 --> 00:39:32.576]  And then the second idea is for a documentary, and I'm very curious to see your thoughts on this.
[00:39:32.576 --> 00:39:39.197]  Everybody talks so much about how there's natural cures to healing cancer and diseases like that.
[00:39:39.197 --> 00:39:51.919]  If we can get somebody who has cancer, get them on tape going into three or four different Western medical doctors saying, you need chemotherapy, you need radiation, or you're going to die, and then track them through a natural healing course.
[00:39:52.597 --> 00:39:58.741]  Watch them get better and then help open people's eyes to see that, you know, radiation and chemotherapy aren't the only answer.
[00:39:58.741 --> 00:39:59.982]  What do you think of those two ideas, man?
[00:39:59.982 --> 00:40:01.423]  Well, I think that they're good ideas.
[00:40:01.423 --> 00:40:08.248]  Obviously, you can put together a website for the first one, no problem, and the second one is obviously going to take a lot of work.
[00:40:08.248 --> 00:40:16.294]  You know, making a movie is no easy task, and especially making a movie with somebody who may be terminally ill would be extremely difficult.
[00:40:17.134 --> 00:40:18.255]  You know, that's a great idea.
[00:40:18.255 --> 00:40:19.976]  You know, you have to will it to happen though.
[00:40:19.976 --> 00:40:23.458]  So, you know, see what you can do to work forward in it and press on, man.
[00:40:23.458 --> 00:40:29.121]  I mean, if that's your idea, maybe you need to start making some contacts that'll have the time to put together a project like that.
[00:40:29.508 --> 00:40:30.449]  I'm definitely thinking about it.
[00:40:30.449 --> 00:40:36.795]  The only thing that makes me nervous about the database is if it gets in the wrong hands, you know, then the government can look at the database and have a list of all of it.
[00:40:36.795 --> 00:40:38.437]  We're all public anyway, man.
[00:40:38.437 --> 00:40:39.398]  There's no doubt about it.
[00:40:39.398 --> 00:40:45.484]  I mean, with MySpace and Facebook and all that other stuff, we've given away so much information at this point, it's almost negligible.
[00:40:45.484 --> 00:40:46.705]  I thank you for the call.
[00:40:46.705 --> 00:40:50.469]  We do have Jesse Benton on the line, Ron Paul's campaign manager.
[00:40:50.469 --> 00:40:51.870]  Jesse, how are you?
[00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:52.691]  I'm doing very well.
[00:40:52.691 --> 00:40:53.011]  How are you?
[00:40:54.255 --> 00:40:56.677]  So why don't you tell us what the latest with the campaign is.
[00:40:56.677 --> 00:41:00.420]  Obviously Ron Paul is still in the race but is taking kind of a backseat.
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:04.523]  A lot of people are asking if he may have a presence at the RNC.
[00:41:04.523 --> 00:41:07.185]  What's going to happen in the future for the campaign?
[00:41:07.185 --> 00:41:09.287]  Well, I'm glad you're asking me this.
[00:41:09.287 --> 00:41:11.268]  We have some pretty exciting news.
[00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:13.210]  We have just come to contract.
[00:41:13.852 --> 00:41:17.755]  With space to hold a rally in Minneapolis.
[00:41:17.755 --> 00:41:18.795]  It's going to be really big.
[00:41:18.795 --> 00:41:22.618]  We're going to be able to have thousands and thousands of people at this rally.
[00:41:22.618 --> 00:41:26.120]  And we're going to have it on Tuesday, September 2nd in St.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.763]  Paul around the Republican National Convention.
[00:41:30.363 --> 00:41:30.663]  Excellent.
[00:41:30.663 --> 00:41:34.787]  And you know, Ron Paul, number one New York Times bestseller now with his non-fiction book, Ron Paul Revolution Manifesto.
[00:41:56.272 --> 00:41:58.693]  And that's just incredible to me on so many levels.
[00:41:58.693 --> 00:42:07.399]  Number one, that, uh, you know, first of all, somebody who was knocked out of the race and ignored by the media on purpose is able to have a number one New York Times bestseller.
[00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:11.801]  But number two, it's a nonfiction book with the word manifesto in it.
[00:42:11.801 --> 00:42:16.884]  And, you know, I mean, that's incredible alone, but he's kind of been blacked out in the mainstream media.
[00:42:16.884 --> 00:42:21.507]  Normally you would see him on Oprah and every other talk show, but he's only done some sparse media.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.664]  Well, you know, I wouldn't say we've been blacked out.
[00:42:28.413 --> 00:42:39.936]  I haven't gotten the attention that we think that Ron deserves, but I think you make a great point that this book is making it impossible for people to ignore Ron if they've been trying to.
[00:42:39.936 --> 00:42:44.016]  This is entering our sixth week in the Top Ten New York Times Best Seller list.
[00:42:44.016 --> 00:42:50.698]  It was number one for a week, and that's just pretty amazing that a political book is selling so well.
[00:42:50.698 --> 00:42:55.639]  A lot of supporters are buying books, but this book is a great vehicle to introduce
[00:42:56.099 --> 00:42:56.580]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:43:08.649 --> 00:43:08.969]  Absolutely.
[00:43:08.969 --> 00:43:10.450]  And we have Alex on the line from Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:11.531]  Alex, what's the latest?
[00:43:29.853 --> 00:43:33.555]  Okay, we found an area in the hotel that has to be backed by the conference rooms.
[00:43:33.555 --> 00:43:36.837]  Most hotels are an acre or two or three or four off the road.
[00:43:36.837 --> 00:43:41.440]  We found a little spot that's on the wing where they're having the conference rooms, so we walked through it yesterday.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.042]  Richard N. Haas, the president of the CFR, just walked out through the woods.
[00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:45.843]  Folks got video of him.
[00:43:45.843 --> 00:43:48.725]  I thought I was recognizing him, and they zoomed in and said, yeah, it's Richard N. Haas.
[00:43:48.725 --> 00:43:53.328]  So I'm going to bullhorn them right now, and I'll let you get back to your guests, and later I'll call in with a full report.
[00:43:53.328 --> 00:43:53.668]  Here we go.
[00:43:53.668 --> 00:43:55.229]  I'm going to bullhorn them right now, Jason.
[00:43:55.229 --> 00:43:55.529]  All right.
[00:43:56.647 --> 00:44:02.893]  Alright, there is Alex Jones at the Bilderberg Conference, and they actually put out a press release this year, folks.
[00:44:02.893 --> 00:44:06.676]  I couldn't believe it, but if you go to businessworld.com, there's a contact number.
[00:44:06.676 --> 00:44:13.121]  The full list of attendees is already out there, and Alex is going to be calling in through the day.
[00:44:13.121 --> 00:44:17.565]  And Jesse, I was just wondering if you were aware of this girl named Amy Allen.
[00:44:17.565 --> 00:44:19.347]  She's an MTV personality.
[00:44:19.347 --> 00:44:21.569]  She had a big hit with this song called Revolution.
[00:44:21.569 --> 00:44:22.670]  Have you heard about this girl?
[00:44:23.488 --> 00:44:28.233]  I have, and I'm a fan, and Dr. Paul's really flattered, too.
[00:44:28.233 --> 00:44:37.102]  And we're actually probably going to reach out to her and see if she's interested in having her playing a part in September, if her schedule's free.
[00:44:37.102 --> 00:44:38.564]  Well, we can ask her today.
[00:44:38.564 --> 00:44:43.409]  She's on the air at 2 o'clock, and we got her for a full hour, and I'm pretty excited about it, too.
[00:44:43.409 --> 00:44:46.532]  The unofficial Ron Paul Revolution video is just tremendous.
[00:44:47.553 --> 00:44:49.154]  Oh, I think so, too.
[00:44:49.154 --> 00:44:57.976]  We need to look and think about how we can reach different people with the message of individual freedom and liberty.
[00:44:57.976 --> 00:45:05.839]  I think that she's actually a tremendous way to reach younger people, people that haven't turned on to our ideas yet.
[00:45:05.839 --> 00:45:09.840]  She's so talented, and her music is really timely and popular.
[00:45:19.245 --> 00:45:37.735]  Absolutely, and that's what I'm all about too, these separate avenues of waking people up to the fact that our government doesn't really work anymore, that we don't have checks and balances anymore, and that the media is only paying attention to a couple of candidates and really pushing them no matter what the people actually want.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:49.483]  They're in the business of censorship and blinding the masses, but Ron Paul is now focusing on keeping his congressional seat so he can fight the battles on the House floor, correct?
[00:45:49.483 --> 00:45:51.644]  Well, he's secured his House seat.
[00:45:51.644 --> 00:46:02.947]  We had a contested primary on May 4th, and Ron won 71% of the vote, and a Democrat has not filed to run against him in the fall, so he's got a clear path.
[00:46:02.947 --> 00:46:05.468]  I guess what Ron is focusing on is
[00:46:07.428 --> 00:46:10.271]  Building an organization for the future.
[00:46:10.271 --> 00:46:13.234]  So much has been accomplished through this campaign.
[00:46:13.234 --> 00:46:21.401]  It's just been tremendous and amazing to see all the hard work in the grassroots across the country.
[00:46:21.401 --> 00:46:25.264]  We need to realize that the campaign was step one in the revolution.
[00:46:25.264 --> 00:46:29.348]  Step two is going to be continuing on, organizing at the grassroots level,
[00:46:29.768 --> 00:46:30.189]  I think so.
[00:46:45.777 --> 00:47:05.065]  Now, we know that Ron is not interested in a third-party run for the presidency, but I'd kind of like to get your take on Jesse Ventura's comments that he would love to run with Ron Paul as his vice president, or possibly he as his vice president, or vice versa, you know, because he shares a lot of the same beliefs.
[00:47:05.065 --> 00:47:10.167]  First of all, have you heard these comments, and what do you think of Jesse's latest book, you know, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me?
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:15.185]  Well, I have not read Mr. Ventura's book yet, Governor Ventura.
[00:47:15.185 --> 00:47:19.270]  I know that Governor Ventura is certainly a charismatic guy.
[00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:23.251]  You know, I think that he and Rahm would have a lot to talk about.
[00:47:23.251 --> 00:47:35.797]  I think that having a leader like him, somebody who's outspoken and charismatic, would be outstanding for our country.
[00:47:35.797 --> 00:47:38.938]  I'm sure that there's lots of room to work together.
[00:47:38.938 --> 00:47:42.260]  Well, I hope that they do get together and at least talk about some issues like that.
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.860]  We have Alex up.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.001]  I guess we don't have Alex.
[00:47:45.001 --> 00:47:46.241]  Alex is in and out.
[00:47:46.241 --> 00:47:48.602]  He's so busy over there at Chantilly, Virginia right now.
[00:47:48.602 --> 00:47:49.803]  But yeah, I hope they sit down.
[00:47:50.267 --> 00:47:58.271]  You know, maybe if they can't, you know, get into political office together, you know, start a new organization, start a new website, just keep getting people aware.
[00:47:58.271 --> 00:48:06.455]  Because, you know, Jesse Ventura has a certain celebrity about him even before he was governor, and then after he was governor, almost a super celebrity about him.
[00:48:06.455 --> 00:48:14.158]  And it really seems like the masses really gravitate towards that kind of pop culture personality.
[00:48:14.158 --> 00:48:18.060]  And Jesse Ventura, to me, is one of the better pop culture personalities.
[00:48:18.823 --> 00:48:28.370]  Yeah, I think you have a great point, and something that a lot of people have to realize is that the people that are really engaged, the activists, we're not like everybody else.
[00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:32.173]  I think we spend a lot more time thinking about politics and issues than the average person.
[00:48:32.173 --> 00:48:45.564]  The average person is out there, and I think they realize that something's wrong with our country, and maybe we're not headed in the right direction, but they're going to get the majority of their news and information just from 10-second, 30-second soundbites on the evening news.
[00:48:46.184 --> 00:48:46.524]  You're right.
[00:48:46.524 --> 00:48:56.188]  Reaching out through pop culture and embracing people that way, bringing people into the revolution that way, is the way that we really have to think about going.
[00:48:56.188 --> 00:48:59.509]  Absolutely, and again, that's what we need to do, people.
[00:48:59.509 --> 00:49:04.791]  We have to make it appealing, because to people like Jesse Benton and myself, these issues are primary.
[00:49:04.791 --> 00:49:07.552]  They're what we wake up and think about.
[00:49:07.552 --> 00:49:09.052]  It's what we research.
[00:49:09.052 --> 00:49:10.653]  We go over paperwork every day.
[00:49:10.653 --> 00:49:13.534]  This isn't even secondary or even third in most people's lives.
[00:49:14.352 --> 00:49:16.393]  First things first is usually people's family.
[00:49:16.393 --> 00:49:18.075]  Second thing is their job.
[00:49:18.075 --> 00:49:19.475]  Third thing is their mortgage.
[00:49:19.475 --> 00:49:20.896]  Fourth thing is their car payment.
[00:49:20.896 --> 00:49:23.138]  And then it's being cool and watching their sports team.
[00:49:23.138 --> 00:49:33.225]  And we really need to change that because if you truly do want to protect your family, if you truly do want to live in a first world nation in the next 10 to 20 years, you have to wake up to these issues.
[00:49:33.225 --> 00:49:35.806]  The dollar has been devalued so much.
[00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:37.768]  Gas prices have gone up so much.
[00:49:37.768 --> 00:49:41.990]  And I just cannot believe that they're actually rationing certain foods in New York.
[00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.871]  But it's happened.
[00:49:42.871 --> 00:49:43.672]  I cannot believe it.
[00:49:43.672 --> 00:49:44.152]  But over in
[00:49:44.532 --> 00:49:45.813]  We're good to go.
[00:50:07.987 --> 00:50:15.493]  Well, I think that America is very much headed down the wrong path, and that's why Dr. Paul ran for the presidency.
[00:50:15.493 --> 00:50:27.261]  You know, he sees the path that we're headed on, and I think that we see, you know, a crashing dollar, and with a military that's stretched to its end.
[00:50:27.261 --> 00:50:29.383]  So, you're right, we need to change paths.
[00:50:29.383 --> 00:50:34.026]  And the great thing is, we've got the wonderful document, the Constitution of the United States of America.
[00:50:34.026 --> 00:50:35.047]  Our answers lie there.
[00:50:35.667 --> 00:50:40.193]  And if we just follow the Constitution, we can wipe this shit, but we need to start now.
[00:50:40.193 --> 00:50:40.654]  I'm with you.
[00:50:40.654 --> 00:50:41.375]  It's InfoWars.com.
[00:50:53.939 --> 00:50:55.900]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:59.522]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:50:59.522 --> 00:51:01.984]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:51:01.984 --> 00:51:05.006]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:51:05.006 --> 00:51:10.749]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:51:10.749 --> 00:51:14.652]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:51:14.992 --> 00:51:20.195]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:51:55.630 --> 00:52:00.271]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:52:00.271 --> 00:52:03.012]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:52:04.636 --> 00:52:06.978]  Have you ever heard of the pioneer story in the 1800s called Blood River?
[00:52:06.978 --> 00:52:14.786]  Most today have not, have not been told that story, but there was a day everyone was told and told the story of Blood River.
[00:52:27.702 --> 00:52:30.547]  At least in South Africa, anyway.
[00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:35.354]  They were white South African pioneers of Dutch Afrikaner stock called the Boers.
[00:52:36.652 --> 00:52:44.558]  460 of them that had to circle their slow-moving oxen-powered wagon train because they knew they could not outrun Shaka.
[00:52:44.558 --> 00:52:46.099]  Shaka was coming.
[00:52:46.099 --> 00:52:50.802]  Coming with 30,000 bloodthirsty, warring, raping, killing warriors.
[00:52:50.802 --> 00:52:59.247]  They were a well-trained, victorious, warring tribe called the Zulus, led by a military genius of his own right called Shaka.
[00:52:59.247 --> 00:53:01.509]  30,000 of them against 460.
[00:53:01.509 --> 00:53:05.952]  When the battle ended, the river literally ran red with the stain of blood.
[00:53:06.612 --> 00:53:11.435]  And when it was all over, 12,000 laid lifeless.
[00:53:11.435 --> 00:53:16.458]  12,000 Zulus, but not one of the 460 were injured.
[00:53:16.458 --> 00:53:17.559]  How could this be?
[00:53:17.559 --> 00:53:19.140]  How could it happen?
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:23.282]  Well, it happened that the Boers did something just prior to the battle.
[00:53:23.282 --> 00:53:26.324]  Something that caused something else to happen in the sky.
[00:53:26.324 --> 00:53:27.865]  It's all quite a story.
[00:53:27.865 --> 00:53:31.207]  Hear it at AnotherUntoldStory.com.
[00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:32.428]  AnotherUntoldStory.com.

[00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:50.855]  Another untold story dot com.
[00:53:56.977 --> 00:53:57.957]  Don't worry.
[00:53:57.957 --> 00:53:59.978]  This show is documented.
[00:53:59.978 --> 00:54:03.180]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:07.101]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:07.101 --> 00:54:11.723]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:54:11.723 --> 00:54:13.624]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:54:18.974 --> 00:54:27.159]  It is the Alex Jones Show, June 6, 2008, end of the week, and Alex is out in Chantilly, Virginia at the Bilderberg Conference.
[00:54:27.159 --> 00:54:30.701]  In fact, there is a live feed over at wearechange.org right now.
[00:54:30.701 --> 00:54:39.766]  I just popped it on and will probably be showing that during the final hour of the show, which is broadcast via TV at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:54:41.539 --> 00:54:42.560]  We're with Jesse Benton.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.682]  And Jesse, where can people get the latest information on Ron Paul?
[00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:50.806]  You just broke this news about a Minneapolis gathering Tuesday, September 2nd.
[00:54:50.806 --> 00:54:52.627]  It would be great if you get Amy Allen there.
[00:54:52.627 --> 00:54:56.851]  But where can people get the updates?
[00:54:56.851 --> 00:55:00.473]  Do we not have Jesse anymore?
[00:55:00.473 --> 00:55:01.014]  Well, that's alright.
[00:55:01.014 --> 00:55:02.395]  No, that's okay.
[00:55:02.395 --> 00:55:04.857]  I guess, you know, people just Google it.
[00:55:04.857 --> 00:55:07.078]  You know, we'll just move on, I guess.
[00:55:07.078 --> 00:55:08.620]  Because this We Are Change stuff is big.
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:10.221]  I'm looking at a screen and
[00:55:10.908 --> 00:55:33.076]  You know there's there's Rob and I think about I can see about 20 people there and really they're just trying to film all the cars that are coming in and out and it is such good news to know that you know the alternative media is getting a voice that this is getting out there in the in the respect there's Alex bullhorning I'm sure he's going to be calling back in at the top of the hour to bullhorn even more.
[00:55:35.846 --> 00:55:37.607]  Oh man, this is just good stuff.
[00:55:37.607 --> 00:55:40.568]  You know, they had to put out a press release this year, people.
[00:55:40.568 --> 00:55:41.469]  Think about that.
[00:55:41.469 --> 00:55:44.130]  They had to put out a press release.
[00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:47.932]  Not only does Bilderberg exist, now they're healthy for us.
[00:55:47.932 --> 00:55:53.074]  And they word it in such a manner that they're all there of their own accordance and it's kind of like a little party.
[00:55:53.074 --> 00:56:00.578]  We have to keep it secret and private so we can talk openly about killing and enslaving you.
[00:56:00.578 --> 00:56:01.058]  But we're good.
[00:56:02.031 --> 00:56:10.258]  Remember, the conference will deal mainly with nuclear-free world, cyber-terrorism, Africa, Russia, and finance.
[00:56:10.258 --> 00:56:12.299]  Okay, we do have Jesse Benton back.
[00:56:12.299 --> 00:56:15.302]  Jesse, where can people find the latest on Ron Paul?
[00:56:15.302 --> 00:56:20.106]  Obviously, you just broke this story about the Minneapolis gathering on Tuesday, September 2nd.
[00:56:20.106 --> 00:56:21.387]  When can we see a post about that?
[00:56:22.054 --> 00:56:29.200]  Well, we're going to have a new website that's going to launch next week that's going to have that kind of information.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:35.966]  It's going to be www.campaignforliberty.org.
[00:56:35.966 --> 00:56:40.470]  So early next week, people should start to tune in and look for an announcement.
[00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:43.093]  We're going to have an announcement about what we're doing in Minneapolis.
[00:56:44.834 --> 00:56:59.586]  Jesse, how did you originally get involved in not only the Ron Paul campaign, but the Patriot movement in general?
[00:56:59.586 --> 00:57:05.751]  Was this something you were always interested in, or was there just a point in time when something didn't feel right and you just started to do research?
[00:57:05.751 --> 00:57:08.353]  What was it that triggered you to get so involved in these politics?
[00:57:09.581 --> 00:57:30.115]  Well, I've always been, I was a little bit of a conservative movement hack for a while, and I worked for some Republicans and some pretty prominent conservative movement groups, and I always liked what they said about limited government and personal freedom, but just the more that I got educated, the more that I read.
[00:57:30.775 --> 00:57:36.279]  I realize that, hey, a lot of Republicans aren't really backing this up with action.
[00:57:36.279 --> 00:57:49.067]  So I formed my own consulting group, and I was just working for some really great groups, the American Conservative Defense Alliance, the Liberty Coalition, and was able to just work for projects that I felt passionately about.
[00:57:49.067 --> 00:57:53.450]  And in the beginning, the campaign was a client of mine.
[00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:54.670]  They needed some help getting set up.
[00:57:56.311 --> 00:57:59.354]  Just two people working, Justine Lamb and Ken Snyder.
[00:57:59.354 --> 00:58:04.718]  So I was the third person that started doing some work, and it fit real well, and I really enjoyed it.
[00:58:04.718 --> 00:58:07.220]  So it took off from there.
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:11.723]  So campaignforliberty.com, and that's going to be up in the next week or so, Jesse?
[00:58:11.723 --> 00:58:16.307]  Yeah, campaignforliberty.org, although I think campaignforliberty.com will work, too.
[00:58:16.307 --> 00:58:16.587]  Awesome.
[00:58:16.587 --> 00:58:18.949]  Alright, Jesse, thank you so much for your time.
[00:58:18.949 --> 00:58:20.310]  Campaign manager for Ron Paul.
[00:58:20.310 --> 00:58:20.850]  Thank you, man.
[00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:22.772]  We're going to be back with Alex Jones.
[00:58:22.772 --> 00:58:24.333]  Bullhorny, it is the Alex Jones Show!
[00:58:34.796 --> 00:58:39.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:44.424]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.424 --> 00:58:45.826]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:45.826 --> 00:58:48.668]  A new world order.
[00:58:48.668 --> 00:58:49.569]  In the near future.
[00:58:50.467 --> 00:58:53.149]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[00:58:53.149 --> 00:58:56.371]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.371 --> 00:58:59.153]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:59.153 --> 00:59:02.336]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:02.336 --> 00:59:09.661]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:12.684 --> 00:59:18.148]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.148 --> 00:59:21.451]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:21.451 --> 00:59:24.574]  The Oval Bureau is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:24.574 --> 00:59:25.735]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:25.735 --> 00:59:26.535]  They're not after money.
[00:59:26.535 --> 00:59:27.796]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:27.796 --> 00:59:28.417]  They're after power.
[00:59:28.417 --> 00:59:29.938]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:59:41.446 --> 00:59:46.569]  You have been warned.
[00:59:46.569 --> 00:59:48.971]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.971 --> 00:59:51.733]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:05.282]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back and we have Alex on the line.
[01:00:05.282 --> 01:00:06.582]  He was just bullhorning.
[01:00:06.582 --> 01:00:14.064]  I'm looking at a live picture of him with a bullhorn over at wearechange.org.
[01:00:23.567 --> 01:00:25.488]  And, uh, this is just incredible.
[01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:28.429]  Uh, there's about 25 people with him, it looks like.
[01:00:28.429 --> 01:00:31.790]  And, uh, there's security, they got little golf courts.
[01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:33.330]  Uh, I'm sorry, golf carts.
[01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:34.591]  And, uh, Alex, are you with me?
[01:00:34.591 --> 01:00:36.051]  Yeah, I'm good.
[01:00:36.051 --> 01:00:38.672]  Standing up against American law... Alright, yep, yep, we got it.
[01:00:38.672 --> 01:00:39.072]  Here we go.
[01:00:39.072 --> 01:00:39.913]  Jason, it's Richard.
[01:00:39.913 --> 01:00:40.713]  Alex, we're on the air.
[01:00:40.713 --> 01:00:45.475]  Eight, nine years ago, you would never see this in the media.
[01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.535]  You would never hear this in the media.
[01:00:47.535 --> 01:00:49.356]  The media wouldn't admit this existed.
[01:00:50.273 --> 01:00:54.037]  The Billionaires wouldn't be forced to put out a press release as they were today.
[01:00:54.037 --> 01:00:55.939]  But now they are!
[01:00:55.939 --> 01:01:04.148]  Because I've been going on coast-to-coast AM the last three nights with 16 million listeners exposing this to the entire world!
[01:01:04.148 --> 01:01:06.971]  To the entire world!
[01:01:06.971 --> 01:01:07.953]  What's going on here?
[01:01:08.544 --> 01:01:17.229]  And we're broadcasting live right now to YouTube to hundreds of thousands of people, and we're broadcasting to millions over the GCN radio network.
[01:01:17.229 --> 01:01:19.471]  That's the technology right now!
[01:01:19.471 --> 01:01:29.697]  Millions on the radio listening, and we're streaming video out on the web to hundreds of thousands.
[01:01:29.697 --> 01:01:34.179]  We are not your slaves!
[01:01:34.179 --> 01:01:38.302]  We are not your property builders or criminals!
[01:01:39.761 --> 01:01:44.523]  We have the courage to stand up against you, and yes, we know you're murderers.
[01:01:44.523 --> 01:01:46.843]  Yes, we know you have giant hit teams.
[01:01:46.843 --> 01:01:50.485]  Yes, we know you've death-threatened me not to come here, but I'm here!
[01:01:50.485 --> 01:01:59.467]  And if you kill me, you'll only make the movement for liberty and humanity stronger!
[01:01:59.467 --> 01:02:04.009]  Your death threats, Bilderberg, will not stop us from coming here peacefully!
[01:02:07.133 --> 01:02:17.257]  We had State Department goons and FBI goons coming into our hotel rooms, coming up to our offices, coming up to us at the restaurants, and asking us if we were planning anything violent.
[01:02:17.257 --> 01:02:19.318]  We have a history of liberty!
[01:02:19.318 --> 01:02:21.519]  A history of freedom and nonviolence!
[01:02:21.519 --> 01:02:27.042]  It's the Bilderberg group that has a history of blowing the hell out of ancient civilizations!
[01:02:27.042 --> 01:02:28.602]  They're the murderers!
[01:02:28.602 --> 01:02:29.983]  They're the dangerous!
[01:02:29.983 --> 01:02:31.024]  Not us!
[01:02:31.024 --> 01:02:33.625]  It's the criminals you're protecting that are dangerous!
[01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:34.085]  Not us!
[01:02:35.327 --> 01:02:42.271]  Yeah, I don't appreciate all the guns you've had coming up asking us questions, but guns go into people's houses.
[01:02:42.271 --> 01:02:44.032]  You're too cowardly to do it here.
[01:02:44.032 --> 01:02:50.456]  You follow people home to their homes in Virginia and try to intimidate them in front of their little kids.
[01:02:50.456 --> 01:02:53.057]  Well, you don't intimidate us!
[01:02:53.057 --> 01:02:53.558]  We do!
[01:02:53.558 --> 01:02:56.739]  You're the criminals!
[01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:59.801]  I'm not talking about criminals.
[01:02:59.801 --> 01:03:02.803]  I mean David Rockefeller, Queen Beatrix, and others.
[01:03:04.246 --> 01:03:05.747]  That's what we're talking about here!
[01:03:05.747 --> 01:03:11.452]  And we are here, as free humanity, standing up against your tyranny, FOR ETERNITY!
[01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:40.801]  You know, it's only private because we want to be able to talk openly and candidly.
[01:03:40.801 --> 01:03:47.764]  Yeah, openly and candidly about enslaving us, about killing us, about forming unions that erode our sovereignty.
[01:03:47.764 --> 01:03:48.864]  It's unbelievable.
[01:03:48.864 --> 01:03:50.045]  Alex, are you there?
[01:03:50.045 --> 01:03:50.985]  We're good-hearted.
[01:03:50.985 --> 01:03:53.947]  We know a lot of you have been misled and deceived.
[01:03:53.947 --> 01:03:56.448]  The American public has been deceived for a long time.
[01:03:56.448 --> 01:04:03.271]  We've been awoken from our slumber by the horrors of 9-11, the horrors that have followed in the trail of 9-11.
[01:04:04.509 --> 01:04:14.255]  It's not too late for many of you to come over to the side of what's good and right and defend the liberty and the freedom of the Constitution of the United States of America!
[01:04:14.255 --> 01:04:15.575]  You swore an oath to that!
[01:04:15.575 --> 01:04:19.878]  You swore an oath to the principles that were behind and beneath that!
[01:04:19.878 --> 01:04:21.339]  Not to the executive!
[01:04:21.339 --> 01:04:28.503]  You swore an oath to defend and uphold the values... Once again, folks, we are live from Bilderberg.
[01:04:28.503 --> 01:04:30.644]  The criminals are being bullhorned.
[01:04:30.644 --> 01:04:31.945]  The truth is rising.
[01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:33.844]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:33.844 --> 01:04:34.785]  This is cutting edge.
[01:04:34.785 --> 01:04:35.685]  This is where it's at.
[01:04:35.685 --> 01:04:38.327]  That's why you need to go to InfoWars.com.
[01:04:38.327 --> 01:04:40.649]  You need to go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:40.649 --> 01:04:42.510]  Because we've got the info.

[01:04:43.991 --> 01:04:44.991]  I am Jason Bermas.
[01:04:44.991 --> 01:04:47.553]  MySpace.com slash Jason Bermas.

[01:06:01.163 --> 01:06:02.925]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:07:03.123 --> 01:07:03.603]  We're good to go.
[01:07:21.297 --> 01:07:22.358]  We're good to go.
[01:07:50.785 --> 01:07:56.166]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:56.166 --> 01:07:59.887]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:59.887 --> 01:08:12.689]  Right, folks, we are back and they are out there bullhorning Kissinger, Bernanke, Condoleezza Rice, Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, the CEOs of Google, the heads of the Deutsche Bank, David Rockefeller.
[01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:19.410]  They're all there, folks, and it's only through this broadcast, the Alex Jones Show, that you're going to get cutting-edge info like this.
[01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:20.090]  Alex, are you with us?
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:22.880]  No, we don't have Alex?
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.801]  Yes, we're on the air.
[01:08:23.801 --> 01:08:25.501]  Here we are, we're on the air.
[01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:30.382]  It would be so easy for you to just admit to the crimes you have committed!
[01:08:30.382 --> 01:08:35.484]  It would be so easy for you to come out and be heroes!
[01:08:35.484 --> 01:08:37.184]  Like so many have been doing.
[01:08:37.184 --> 01:08:42.606]  We've had prime ministers and presidents and the president of Czechoslovakia coming out.
[01:08:42.606 --> 01:08:51.068]  We have seen so many people, Scott McClellan's come out of the White House and told what we already hear from documents, that they lied, lied about it all.
[01:08:51.618 --> 01:08:53.940]  They want to do oil, and no big weapons contracts.
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:56.562]  Three trillion of them.
[01:08:56.562 --> 01:09:01.445]  It's like people inside the Clinton government exposed to crimes.
[01:09:01.445 --> 01:09:03.907]  It's both parties are controlled.
[01:09:03.907 --> 01:09:06.048]  Robin Cook was about to be Prime Minister.
[01:09:06.048 --> 01:09:08.010]  He spoke up, they murdered him.
[01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.231]  Just a few months ago for Gordon Brown.
[01:09:10.231 --> 01:09:12.473]  So he could come out and give his no order speeches.
[01:09:12.473 --> 01:09:17.396]  That's another point I want to make.
[01:09:17.396 --> 01:09:19.658]  I know it's dangerous coming in and confronting him.
[01:09:20.350 --> 01:09:22.371]  I know you're mass murderers.
[01:09:22.371 --> 01:09:27.034]  I know you're sadistic psychopaths who enjoy killing innocent people.
[01:09:27.034 --> 01:09:38.821]  And I know the only reason you haven't killed me, Alex Jones, is because you're afraid it'll get too much attention to what we're doing, and it'll water the tree of liberty, and you're right!
[01:09:38.821 --> 01:09:42.963]  If you strike us down, we'll only become more powerful!
[01:09:42.963 --> 01:09:48.466]  I had the head of the Kissinger Group, who was in the Washington Post a month ago, with the headline,
[01:09:50.299 --> 01:09:53.380]  Admitting that you guys run the planet!
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.180]  And we called him up to have him on as a guest.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:58.141]  He said, oh yeah, Mr. Jones, I want to come on and counter you.
[01:09:58.141 --> 01:09:59.541]  We all know who you are!
[01:09:59.541 --> 01:10:08.983]  So for the police here to think I'm just saying that and don't know, these guys all know who we are, they all know we're hot on their tail, so just pipe.
[01:10:08.983 --> 01:10:15.244]  We're off the car with Alex Jones in the Google, you can hear the radio interview, where they admit they run things and laugh about it!
[01:10:15.859 --> 01:10:26.789]  Some of these people even come on my show and admit what they're engaged in and what they're doing.
[01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:27.990]  It is incredible.
[01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.530]  Yes.
[01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:30.532]  We're gonna go to Dylan Avery now.
[01:10:30.532 --> 01:10:32.454]  Let him do some bullhorning, Jason.
[01:10:32.454 --> 01:10:32.814]  Alright.
[01:10:32.814 --> 01:10:36.297]  All right, yeah, and you can watch this live over at wearechanged.org, folks.
[01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:44.497]  The people here, the true patriots, are winning the Info War!
[01:10:44.497 --> 01:10:52.161]  Right now, hundreds if not thousands of people are watching live video of this happening right now!
[01:10:52.161 --> 01:10:58.384]  On WeAreChange.org, there's a live video going on right now!
[01:10:58.384 --> 01:11:00.846]  Even though you roll in secrecy!
[01:11:00.846 --> 01:11:03.207]  Even though you come in black tinted cars!
[01:11:03.735 --> 01:11:13.548]  We will still expose you wherever you go at book signings, at any other event, we will expose you all over the internet and we have been doing so!
[01:11:14.198 --> 01:11:22.164]  We started in New York City, and now there's over 50 chapters worldwide confronting criminal scum everywhere you go!
[01:11:22.164 --> 01:11:23.646]  You can't hide!
[01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.047]  Trump will prevail!
[01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:26.748]  Your secrecy will fail!
[01:11:26.748 --> 01:11:29.390]  And there will never be a new world order!
[01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:31.252]  Freedom will prevail!
[01:11:31.252 --> 01:11:33.654]  And national sovereignty will prevail!
[01:11:33.654 --> 01:11:36.136]  Thank you, Luke Rudowsky.
[01:11:36.136 --> 01:11:39.418]  I was calling Jason Verma, for some reason my brain's so scrambled here.
[01:11:39.418 --> 01:11:41.220]  All right, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:11:42.068 --> 01:11:50.674]  Again, you just heard from Rick Rodowsky, who about a year and a half ago started We Are Change, chapters all over the world, citizen activists, 9-11 Truth, all these groups.
[01:11:50.674 --> 01:12:03.402]  Because make no mistake, these guys wrote policy reports decades ago about staging terror attacks and blaming it on domestic populations they want to enslave or launching wars.
[01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.944]  Google Operation Northwoods.
[01:12:05.944 --> 01:12:08.786]  You'll get ABC News, Baltimore Sun, AP.
[01:12:09.747 --> 01:12:10.327]  Headline!
[01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:10.587]  U.S.
[01:12:10.587 --> 01:12:14.629]  government plan to terrorize cities as pretext for war.
[01:12:14.629 --> 01:12:17.150]  But the plan got discovered and they canceled it.
[01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:19.471]  What was the Operation Northwood's plan?
[01:12:19.471 --> 01:12:22.933]  And don't laugh, lady, because the lawyer there likes to laugh at everything.
[01:12:22.933 --> 01:12:25.994]  Some of you may actually go Google Operation Northwood.
[01:12:25.994 --> 01:12:27.035]  You'll be on ABC News.
[01:12:28.234 --> 01:12:31.136]  You don't go to the Library of Congress, they have the copies of the plan.
[01:12:31.136 --> 01:12:41.465]  The government wanted to hijack jets, flambe, remote control, crash jump, plane taxi, prevent attacks in D.C., sniper attacks, and blame it on political dissidents.
[01:12:41.465 --> 01:12:43.967]  The government has been hijacked!
[01:12:43.967 --> 01:12:47.510]  The government is run by criminals!
[01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:54.575]  The people inside here, some of them, have helped carry out attacks against Serbia, against Iraq,
[01:12:55.566 --> 01:12:57.047]  Millions are dead!
[01:12:57.047 --> 01:12:58.929]  They've used up all the uranium!
[01:12:58.929 --> 01:13:00.210]  All over the world!
[01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:04.714]  They have committed absolutely amazing crimes!
[01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:07.577]  They have committed huge crimes!
[01:13:07.577 --> 01:13:13.522]  There is a global crime syndicate meeting right now inside that building!
[01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.764]  Arch-criminals!
[01:13:15.764 --> 01:13:19.807]  Many of them that come to the events have arrest warrants for them in scores of nations!
[01:13:19.807 --> 01:13:21.509]  And they're all
[01:13:23.564 --> 01:13:25.245]  Violating the Logan Act.
[01:13:25.245 --> 01:13:36.871]  Anyone in there meeting with federal officials to discuss policy without express authorization are engaging in crime.
[01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:40.653]  Are engaging in very, very serious crimes.
[01:13:40.653 --> 01:13:47.997]  And everybody aiding and abetting them are accessories to violating the Logan Act.
[01:13:47.997 --> 01:13:50.078]  Accessories to felonies.
[01:13:51.223 --> 01:13:53.764]  Now, the cops out here on the air, they don't really know what's going on.
[01:13:53.764 --> 01:13:54.925]  They're just on the block of roads.
[01:13:54.925 --> 01:13:57.606]  They're not violating the law.
[01:13:57.606 --> 01:14:09.631]  But the FBI, the diplomatic service from the State Department, are all violating federal law, and they show all will, they are doing it.
[01:14:09.631 --> 01:14:12.633]  And I want to laugh about it.
[01:14:12.633 --> 01:14:14.954]  Hillary Clinton got fined not $100,000, not $200,000.
[01:14:18.354 --> 01:14:22.898]  It was $300,000 for going to one of these to violate the Logan Act.
[01:14:22.898 --> 01:14:25.300]  Just Google, Killing Logan Act.
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.542]  You can read the news articles from 10 years ago.
[01:14:28.542 --> 01:14:30.544]  This isn't funny!
[01:14:30.544 --> 01:14:34.347]  Felonies are being committed right now!
[01:14:34.347 --> 01:14:41.012]  You are guarding international criminals that are meeting in that building.
[01:14:41.012 --> 01:14:46.457]  International criminals violating the Logan Act, and you are in there protecting them right now!
[01:14:48.795 --> 01:14:55.479]  As they buy and sell our politicians.
[01:14:55.479 --> 01:14:57.740]  You know who came up with the European Union in 54?
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.580]  Bilderberg Group.
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:14:58.960]  BBC News.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:03.323]  You know who came up with the attack on Serbia?
[01:15:03.323 --> 01:15:04.283]  Bilderberg Group.
[01:15:04.283 --> 01:15:05.564]  Mainstream News.
[01:15:05.564 --> 01:15:08.225]  We forced it out.
[01:15:08.225 --> 01:15:10.106]  You know who put Bernanke in?
[01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:10.707]  These guys.
[01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:12.007]  That's the fedsies if you don't know.
[01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:13.248]  We just got Bernanke?
[01:15:17.423 --> 01:15:19.885]  Federal Reserve Chairman just pulled in!
[01:15:19.885 --> 01:15:22.948]  That little criminal!
[01:15:22.948 --> 01:15:27.353]  Can they get video of this?
[01:15:27.353 --> 01:15:30.075]  Who got it?
[01:15:30.075 --> 01:15:30.856]  I gotta have it now.
[01:15:30.856 --> 01:15:31.296]  That's it.
[01:15:31.296 --> 01:15:32.017]  That's it.
[01:15:32.017 --> 01:15:33.559]  Just get it up fast.
[01:15:33.559 --> 01:15:35.521]  You take that trigger.
[01:15:35.521 --> 01:15:36.381]  He is on the list.
[01:15:36.381 --> 01:15:37.462]  Bernanke is there.
[01:15:37.462 --> 01:15:39.805]  And they just got him on camera.
[01:15:39.805 --> 01:15:41.106]  Federal Reserve Chairman.
[01:15:41.727 --> 01:15:45.689]  A private bank that owns our country and is surpassing our currency.
[01:15:45.689 --> 01:15:47.250]  So their private interest can buy it up.
[01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:50.191]  So he just came out and quoted the point.
[01:15:50.191 --> 01:15:57.114]  I don't have a truth.
[01:15:57.114 --> 01:15:58.315]  Let's see.
[01:15:58.315 --> 01:16:01.616]  He's not federal, so he can ship it.
[01:16:01.616 --> 01:16:03.017]  He's not violating the LOGAC.
[01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:06.218]  He's a private bank chairman.
[01:16:06.218 --> 01:16:09.900]  The private bankers must love being able to issue all the tariffs they want quartered.
[01:16:10.467 --> 01:16:15.751]  And the idiot volunteers several and doesn't even know it's private.
[01:16:15.751 --> 01:16:20.454]  This country is owned and run by a murdering mafia.
[01:16:20.454 --> 01:16:22.616]  Bernanke!
[01:16:22.616 --> 01:16:26.419]  You're a criminal, Bernanke!
[01:16:26.419 --> 01:16:27.460]  Bernanke!
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:30.502]  Stop destroying the currency, you criminal!
[01:16:30.502 --> 01:16:38.768]  You're not going to be able to stop Ron Paul whenever he questions you and the House Banking Committee, you little crook!
[01:16:39.898 --> 01:16:41.619]  I'm going to call the Congressman.
[01:16:41.619 --> 01:16:53.284]  Once we confirm you've been here, I'm going to send him video stills, and maybe he'll pull them up on C-SPAN, and I'll MSNBC and question why you were at an international crime syndicate meeting.
[01:16:53.284 --> 01:16:54.085]  That's right!
[01:16:54.085 --> 01:17:00.268]  We'll have you stood up before the Health Security Committee, you little dirtbag criminal!
[01:17:00.268 --> 01:17:04.210]  You are a criminal, Bernanke!
[01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:08.892]  You are a disgusting, un-American piece of trash!
[01:17:09.798 --> 01:17:15.822]  You make me sick!
[01:17:15.822 --> 01:17:18.603]  Well, there you have it, folks.
[01:17:18.603 --> 01:17:24.627]  Alex Jones out in front of Chantilly, Virginia, the Marriott Hotel at the Bilderberg Group.
[01:17:24.627 --> 01:17:28.589]  They had to put out a press release because of all the press that he has brought attention to.
[01:17:28.589 --> 01:17:30.010]  I mean, there was no way around it.
[01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:34.093]  They had to release this list because they knew it was going to be released anyway.
[01:17:34.093 --> 01:17:35.373]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:17:35.373 --> 01:17:39.516]  Wish we could get Alex on the line to comment on some of the members on the list.
[01:17:40.254 --> 01:17:43.935]  The fact that Hillary Clinton and Obama magically met in D.C.
[01:17:43.935 --> 01:17:44.935]  on the first night.
[01:17:44.935 --> 01:17:46.355]  Isn't that great?
[01:17:46.355 --> 01:17:52.896]  They have their first little secret meeting and it just happens to be right where the Bilderberg Group is in D.C.
[01:17:52.896 --> 01:17:54.797]  It's just a coincidence.
[01:17:54.797 --> 01:17:55.837]  I'm sure.
[01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:56.817]  Right?
[01:17:56.817 --> 01:18:05.959]  There's no way that they were actually meeting with members of the Bilderberg Group, like maybe Kissinger, who was a main advisor of the Bush administration, probably still is.
[01:18:05.959 --> 01:18:06.919]  Behind the scenes, of course.
[01:18:07.643 --> 01:18:11.105]  David Rockefeller, buddy-buddy with George Pataki in 2006.
[01:18:11.105 --> 01:18:12.906]  You can watch that in Endgame.
[01:18:12.906 --> 01:18:14.546]  Makes me sick.
[01:18:14.546 --> 01:18:16.887]  Ben Bernanke, who's just being screamed at.
[01:18:16.887 --> 01:18:19.529]  Head of the Federal Reserve right now, the chairman.
[01:18:19.529 --> 01:18:20.649]  Destroying this country.
[01:18:20.649 --> 01:18:22.710]  Bringing down the dollar.
[01:18:22.710 --> 01:18:25.511]  Eviscerating the housing market.
[01:18:25.511 --> 01:18:27.973]  I mean, it's disgusting!
[01:18:27.973 --> 01:18:35.156]  And now they're putting out press releases letting us know that there are masters, and they're gonna meet in secret, and it's a good thing!
[01:18:35.825 --> 01:18:37.466]  And that's why there's no press conference.
[01:18:37.466 --> 01:18:39.128]  And that's why there's no coverage.
[01:18:39.128 --> 01:18:44.613]  And that's why there's no open public forum for everybody to listen to what kind of policy they're trying to set.
[01:18:44.613 --> 01:18:47.915]  Because they're setting policy that is not good for us.
[01:18:47.915 --> 01:18:49.977]  That does not have our best interests at heart.
[01:18:49.977 --> 01:18:52.800]  In fact, probably our worst interests at heart.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.042]  It's policy that's going to bring in the North American Union.
[01:18:55.042 --> 01:18:59.285]  It's policy that's going to turn this country into a second world nation.
[01:18:59.285 --> 01:19:00.026]  Aren't you worried?
[01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:00.987]  Aren't you upset?
[01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:03.309]  Aren't you outraged?
[01:19:03.309 --> 01:19:03.529]  I am.
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:08.982]  George Shultz, Richard Perle, Paul the Demon Wolfowitz.
[01:19:08.982 --> 01:19:09.882]  That's right.
[01:19:09.882 --> 01:19:12.703]  Assistant Secretary of Defense, Paul the Demon Wolfowitz.
[01:19:12.703 --> 01:19:13.704]  He's no good.
[01:19:13.704 --> 01:19:14.684]  He's garbage.
[01:19:14.684 --> 01:19:15.445]  Okay?
[01:19:15.445 --> 01:19:16.545]  He's total garbage.
[01:19:16.545 --> 01:19:19.647]  In fact, he did like a little speech.
[01:19:19.647 --> 01:19:23.328]  Which, who was in front of, uh... I think it was West Point.
[01:19:23.328 --> 01:19:25.429]  You will be surprised!
[01:19:25.429 --> 01:19:27.010]  Courage and surprise!
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.245]  New Pearl Harbor right before 9-11.
[01:19:30.245 --> 01:19:31.969]  Very, very, very interesting.
[01:19:31.969 --> 01:19:33.232]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:33.232 --> 01:19:34.274]  We'll be back after this.
[01:19:34.274 --> 01:19:35.838]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:20:04.471]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:20:04.471 --> 01:20:15.539]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:20:15.539 --> 01:20:17.881]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose
[01:20:18.942 --> 01:20:20.683]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:20:20.683 --> 01:20:26.826]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:20:26.826 --> 01:20:32.229]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:42.035]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[01:20:42.455 --> 01:20:45.078]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:20:45.078 --> 01:20:51.083]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:20:51.083 --> 01:20:51.884]  Gold.
[01:20:51.884 --> 01:20:53.405]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:20:53.405 --> 01:20:59.691]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:20:59.691 --> 01:21:03.495]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:03.855 --> 01:21:05.797]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:05.797 --> 01:21:08.218]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:08.218 --> 01:21:16.324]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:21:16.324 --> 01:21:22.449]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family.
[01:21:22.649 --> 01:21:23.049]  Let's do it!
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:55.061]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:21:55.061 --> 01:22:00.103]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:22:00.103 --> 01:22:05.565]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:05.565 --> 01:22:16.048]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:16.548 --> 01:22:20.950]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:23.730]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:27.292]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:22:27.292 --> 01:22:39.796]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[01:22:40.616 --> 01:22:53.541]  Are you tired of raised eyebrows and shrugging shoulders?
[01:22:53.541 --> 01:22:55.882]  Hi, I'm Director William Lewis.
[01:22:55.882 --> 01:23:01.924]  Have you ever tried to convince your neighbor or loved one that serious problems exist within our own government?
[01:23:01.924 --> 01:23:07.026]  If you said yes, then you know how hard it is to effectively get your message across.
[01:23:07.026 --> 01:23:09.547]  Now, the American people have a new tool in their arsenal.
[01:23:10.236 --> 01:23:13.398]  Let me introduce you to my latest documentary.
[01:23:13.398 --> 01:23:23.224]  Washington You're Fired was designed to be an educational tool for alerting Americans to current and pending legislation that affects the daily lives of everyone in this country.
[01:23:23.224 --> 01:23:32.370]  It's a cry for justice and for change with a very simple blueprint for correcting our mistakes, taking back our government, and restoring our Constitution.

[01:24:10.223 --> 01:24:11.044]  Alright, we are back.
[01:24:11.044 --> 01:24:12.284]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:12.284 --> 01:24:20.346]  Alex is out there bullhorning the local police they sent out to guard Bilderberg and the Marriott Hotel at Bilderberg right this very instant.
[01:24:20.346 --> 01:24:23.146]  You can go to the live stream at wearechange.org.
[01:24:23.146 --> 01:24:26.067]  While he's doing that, I'm going to take my first caller of the day.
[01:24:26.067 --> 01:24:28.147]  Let's go to Rocco in North Carolina.
[01:24:28.147 --> 01:24:29.167]  Rocco, are you with us?
[01:24:29.167 --> 01:24:30.888]  Hi, yes I am.
[01:24:30.888 --> 01:24:32.468]  Hey Jason, I had a quick question.
[01:24:32.468 --> 01:24:33.508]  Sure.
[01:24:33.508 --> 01:24:35.029]  You mentioned Morgan Reynolds.
[01:24:35.029 --> 01:24:37.309]  I found some of his articles helpful.
[01:24:37.819 --> 01:24:42.623]  And I was surprised you had mentioned that you thought he might be an Asian because he was in Terror Storm.
[01:24:42.623 --> 01:24:44.185]  What was the deal?
[01:24:44.185 --> 01:24:50.590]  Well, he didn't, but when they first cut that Terror Storm, he wasn't around talking about cartoon planes and space beams, man.
[01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:51.891]  He's totally changed?
[01:24:51.891 --> 01:24:52.992]  Yeah, absolutely!
[01:24:52.992 --> 01:24:58.677]  He went off the deep end with people like, you know, it's really funny because even some people in the movement get behind on this.
[01:24:58.677 --> 01:25:02.020]  I remember the first time I met David Ray Griffin in his home.
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:04.783]  He did a lot of the fact-checking on Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:25:05.649 --> 01:25:09.251]  And he suggested we go and interview Judy Wood.
[01:25:09.251 --> 01:25:16.656]  And I said, Mr. Griffin, with all due respect, Judy Wood is talking about Keebler elves as the World Trade Center towers.
[01:25:16.656 --> 01:25:19.918]  And she's talking about space beams and no planes, sir.
[01:25:19.918 --> 01:25:20.838]  And he's like, really?
[01:25:20.838 --> 01:25:24.661]  And I'm like, yeah, you should see her last few articles from the last couple of months.
[01:25:24.661 --> 01:25:25.241]  And he did.
[01:25:25.241 --> 01:25:30.744]  And he was like blown away and, you know, disassociated himself with her, which he should, you know.
[01:25:30.744 --> 01:25:33.746]  And Morgan Reynolds was another one of these guys that came out with
[01:25:34.244 --> 01:25:35.345]  Pretty solid information.
[01:25:35.345 --> 01:25:37.326]  Had been a member of the Bush administration.
[01:25:37.326 --> 01:25:40.789]  And then all of a sudden, he's talking about cartoon planes on Fox Man.
[01:25:40.789 --> 01:25:42.830]  And that is... Come on.
[01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:43.571]  Give me a break.
[01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:48.394]  If there's anything that's going to discredit this 9-11 truth movement, it's cartoon planes, bro.
[01:25:48.394 --> 01:25:53.818]  So, there's been certain individuals like that that evidently were... Yeah, they get on a news show.
[01:25:53.818 --> 01:25:57.181]  They get on a news show, and they sound okay the first or second time.
[01:25:57.577 --> 01:26:03.098]  And then by the third or fourth time when they've made a name for themselves in this movement, all of a sudden they're off the bandwagon, man.
[01:26:03.098 --> 01:26:13.000]  And it's there to discredit us, it's there to make us look awful, and it's unfortunate because, you know, a lot of the information he does talk about in Terror Storm is real, but that's what COINTELPRO does.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:20.902]  They give you about 80% good information, and then the other 20% is there to pollute the water, to, you know, put the turd in the punch bowl.
[01:26:20.902 --> 01:26:22.162]  Yeah, that's terrible.
[01:26:22.162 --> 01:26:26.683]  What happened to the individual that wrote the Terror Timeline, which inspired 9-11 Press for Truth?
[01:26:27.091 --> 01:26:29.012]  Are you talking about Paul Thompson?
[01:26:29.012 --> 01:26:29.352]  Yeah.
[01:26:29.352 --> 01:26:30.273]  He's still around.
[01:26:30.273 --> 01:26:38.717]  He just helped out, I think, with the In Their Own Words documentary, a follow-up to the other one you were just discussing, Press for Truth, and he's still around.
[01:26:38.717 --> 01:26:41.118]  I see him every once in a while on an interview.
[01:26:41.118 --> 01:26:45.501]  I think that he helps update that cooperativeresearch.org website as well.
[01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:49.103]  Does he outright state he believes there's an inside job there?
[01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:51.204]  No, he's one of those soft guys, man.
[01:26:51.204 --> 01:26:53.765]  I mean, obviously, I enjoy his work.
[01:26:53.765 --> 01:26:55.286]  It's a great tool to actually
[01:26:56.275 --> 01:26:57.657]  Look into things.
[01:26:57.657 --> 01:27:02.481]  But at the same time, you know, we need people to stand up and just outright say the truth.
[01:27:02.481 --> 01:27:03.402]  And you know what?
[01:27:03.402 --> 01:27:07.066]  Like I was talking to Jesse Benton, we have to bring people in from different avenues.
[01:27:07.066 --> 01:27:11.911]  So I respect his decision to kind of stay on the fence and just report all that other stuff.
[01:27:11.911 --> 01:27:18.097]  But anybody with a half a brain that looks at this information knows right away that, you know, there's more going on.
[01:27:18.661 --> 01:27:20.122]  Right, I think with certain people.
[01:27:20.122 --> 01:27:21.784]  I mean, it took me some time, but I agree.
[01:27:21.784 --> 01:27:24.987]  But there's no evidence with him that he's an agent or anything.
[01:27:24.987 --> 01:27:26.208]  No, no, no.
[01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:26.808]  You know what?
[01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:34.075]  I've met a lot of these quote-unquote lie-hop guys, and I don't want to name any names, but there were a couple guys that rubbed me the wrong way, for instance.
[01:27:34.075 --> 01:27:35.056]  But this is a couple years ago.
[01:27:35.056 --> 01:27:36.177]  They may have changed their position.
[01:27:36.177 --> 01:27:37.358]  I remember being outside of
[01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:54.390]  The Chicago event, the first real 9-11 truth event, and somebody was talking to me about the controlled demolition of 1 and 2, and they were trying to tell me that it was mafia built and it was built under code, and I was just like, look man, there's no way that the official version of now, and the third official version, because first it was a pancake,
[01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:56.290]  Second, it was the steel melting.
[01:27:56.290 --> 01:27:58.371]  And we're still waiting for the final report on 7, right?
[01:27:58.371 --> 01:27:59.151]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:59.151 --> 01:28:02.152]  And then the third one was, oh, well, it was so hot in there.
[01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:05.713]  It was somewhere between 1,500 and 1,800 degrees, so the steel weakened.
[01:28:05.713 --> 01:28:06.613]  It didn't melt.
[01:28:06.613 --> 01:28:11.494]  Now, again, 1,500 and 1,800 degrees in the impact hole is impossible.
[01:28:11.494 --> 01:28:12.154]  Let me say it again.
[01:28:12.154 --> 01:28:13.314]  It is impossible.
[01:28:13.314 --> 01:28:15.535]  The firefighters, two minutes before the building collapsed,
[01:28:15.755 --> 01:28:16.395]  We're good to go.
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:38.242]  I still wonder what the final explanation by NIST will be for Seven.
[01:28:51.267 --> 01:28:58.990]  I think his name is Sondar something or other for NIST and he was the guy that told Popular Mechanics that 25% of the building was scooped out.
[01:28:58.990 --> 01:29:00.351]  Okay, that's the equivalent.
[01:29:00.351 --> 01:29:01.511]  Let me let me explain that to people.
[01:29:01.511 --> 01:29:03.632]  This is a 47-story skyscraper.
[01:29:03.632 --> 01:29:07.413]  One-fourth, very simple math, is over 12 stories.
[01:29:07.413 --> 01:29:09.274]  That is its own large building.
[01:29:09.274 --> 01:29:12.015]  It is its own large steel structure.
[01:29:12.015 --> 01:29:13.136]  It's absolutely ludicrous.
[01:29:13.136 --> 01:29:13.776]  We have video.
[01:29:14.256 --> 01:29:16.077]  And photographs that prove the contrary.
[01:29:16.077 --> 01:29:17.438]  Rocco, I thank you for the call.
[01:29:17.438 --> 01:29:18.519]  We're going to come back.
[01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:20.100]  More Bilderberg with Alex Jones.
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:22.261]  And we're going to keep taking your calls, folks.
[01:29:22.261 --> 01:29:23.322]  I'm Jason Burmess.
[01:29:23.322 --> 01:29:24.222]  It's my final day.
[01:29:24.222 --> 01:29:25.903]  I thank you all for having me, by the way.
[01:29:25.903 --> 01:29:27.224]  InfoWars.com.
[01:29:27.224 --> 01:29:28.825]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:29:41.141 --> 01:29:45.068]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.068 --> 01:29:47.752]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:52.512 --> 01:29:56.916]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[01:29:56.916 --> 01:29:59.059]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[01:29:59.059 --> 01:30:04.424]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about a simple technology you can have right now.
[01:30:04.424 --> 01:30:08.888]  Gas Freedom is a do-it-yourself, affordable, practical, free energy device.
[01:30:08.888 --> 01:30:13.293]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[01:30:14.394 --> 01:30:15.174]  We're good to go!
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:39.000]  That's right.
[01:30:51.055 --> 01:30:53.016]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:30:53.016 --> 01:30:56.638]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:30:56.638 --> 01:30:58.700]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:02.122]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:31:02.122 --> 01:31:07.865]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:31:07.865 --> 01:31:11.768]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:31:12.108 --> 01:31:17.311]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:32:00.372 --> 01:32:08.781]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:22.732]  Alright folks, we're back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.732 --> 01:33:26.175]  I am Jason Burmess and Alex is out in Chantilly, Virginia right now.
[01:33:26.175 --> 01:33:40.426]  Bill Bullhorning, Bilderberg, remember Bernanke, Kissinger, Schultz, Pearl, Wolfowitz, Rice, Rockefeller, Queen of the Netherlands, Queen of Spain, and many, many more.
[01:33:40.426 --> 01:33:43.369]  Head of Google is over there right now.
[01:33:43.369 --> 01:33:43.649]  Okay?
[01:33:44.172 --> 01:33:46.213]  Remember, cyber-terrorism is on the agenda this year.
[01:33:46.213 --> 01:33:48.473]  They want to regulate that internet really, really bad.
[01:33:48.473 --> 01:33:50.674]  Cyber-terrorism!
[01:33:50.674 --> 01:33:51.554]  What a joke.
[01:33:51.554 --> 01:33:53.815]  Is that going to be the next new fear-mongering?
[01:33:53.815 --> 01:33:55.475]  They're going to get our internet!
[01:33:55.475 --> 01:33:58.336]  They're going to make us all terrorists!
[01:33:58.336 --> 01:34:00.237]  Alright, let's keep taking calls.
[01:34:00.237 --> 01:34:02.157]  Let's go to John in Ohio.
[01:34:02.157 --> 01:34:03.858]  John, are you with me?
[01:34:03.858 --> 01:34:09.100]  Yes, you know, these Bilderbergers are all sharks, but the buffaloes, pearl, rice,
[01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:19.836]  As even Jim Tucker and others I've read on globalresearch.ca, these are the mad dog sharks.
[01:34:19.836 --> 01:34:29.903]  These are the rabbit sharks actually trying in the feeding frenzy to cut out the other sharks from the contracts in Iran and Iraq.
[01:34:29.903 --> 01:34:38.609]  That was the first thing after the invasion of Iraq that they did is they canceled the contracts that would have been put into effect as the support for those murderous sanctions were
[01:34:39.048 --> 01:34:40.488]  We're lifted in Europe.
[01:34:40.488 --> 01:35:03.954]  So I think what we've got to do, and I really appreciate it, Alex, not just simply talking about the existence and the meeting of Bilderberg, but this split, this apparent split for the first time, because these guys are such mad dogs in this American section of the Bilderberg that they are going to bring the whole house down, apparently, with this mad war against Iran.
[01:35:03.954 --> 01:35:04.574]  And I think that
[01:35:05.359 --> 01:35:17.787]  You know, this is what is the burning, screaming issue that should be shouted and bullhorned right now, that we must avoid any kind of a World War-provoking attack against Iran.
[01:35:17.787 --> 01:35:23.531]  This is the issue they're discussing, and the whole issue is on the edge of the cliff, teetering back and forth.
[01:35:23.531 --> 01:35:30.396]  And I think that we hear the Democrats, the Republicans, Obama, Hillary, are total, absolute
[01:35:31.395 --> 01:35:36.196]  There's something going on there, but I'm not going to rely on anything except total fealty by Obama, Hillary, and McCain towards war with Iran.
[01:35:56.281 --> 01:36:07.830]  You know, Obama talks about, we'll have a talk, to submit, capitulate, give up your independence in any country he talks to, and they say, we can't do anything with them, now we've got to bomb them.
[01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:21.521]  There's no difference because they've all gone on pilgrimages in Cyclops and Ashes to the APEC lobby to pledge their fealty to any warmongering crime that Israel wants to do itself or to act as a junior partner with us.
[01:36:22.183 --> 01:36:23.744]  We can't rely on them.
[01:36:23.744 --> 01:36:25.604]  Alright, John, I thank you for the call.
[01:36:25.604 --> 01:36:28.585]  I've got to jump to the next caller, but I'm with you.
[01:36:28.585 --> 01:36:31.306]  Obviously, these guys are just puppets.
[01:36:31.306 --> 01:36:33.067]  Obama sounds good.
[01:36:33.067 --> 01:36:34.047]  He's a really good speaker.
[01:36:34.047 --> 01:36:35.308]  Hillary's not a bad speaker either.
[01:36:35.308 --> 01:36:39.709]  They're both very intelligent individuals, but it's going to be more of the same.
[01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:41.330]  It's not good.
[01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:43.650]  It's not good that they're meeting with the elites right now.
[01:36:43.650 --> 01:36:48.292]  Their little secret meeting last night, I guarantee you Bilderbergers were indeed there.
[01:36:48.292 --> 01:36:50.093]  Let's go to Kevin in Canada.
[01:36:50.093 --> 01:36:50.733]  Kevin, are you with us?
[01:36:51.343 --> 01:36:52.144]  Hello, how are you doing?
[01:36:52.144 --> 01:36:53.485]  Good.
[01:36:53.485 --> 01:36:58.068]  I just wanted to say, basically we're trying to fight the fight also out here.
[01:36:58.068 --> 01:37:11.698]  There's a few of us that have gone on to a few of these international casts, and we're trying to basically just do refeeds of Alex Jones and different ideas, just sharing information, explaining to people, asking them questions like, when did you vote for this North American Union?
[01:37:11.698 --> 01:37:14.841]  You know, trying to get them to see the obviousness of the situation.
[01:37:14.841 --> 01:37:16.882]  And a guy in the group had a great idea.
[01:37:16.882 --> 01:37:18.083]  He just had a little side call.
[01:37:18.752 --> 01:37:23.013]  And he called Chantilly today, and he asked to speak to David Rockefeller, and he got through.
[01:37:23.013 --> 01:37:25.173]  And he actually just spoke to the gentleman.
[01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:32.195]  And it's very scary when you talk to a 93-year-old gentleman that sounds so kind and nice, because that's exactly what he sounded like.
[01:37:32.195 --> 01:37:34.455]  He didn't make a fool of himself.
[01:37:34.455 --> 01:37:38.056]  He asked him nice questions in a decent way, I should say.
[01:37:38.056 --> 01:37:39.096]  He didn't ask him nice questions.
[01:37:39.096 --> 01:37:45.978]  He was asking about the fact that, you know, you basically run the world, and not as many of us are worried about this.
[01:37:47.184 --> 01:37:49.925]  I didn't misrepresent myself or anything like that.
[01:37:49.925 --> 01:37:54.427]  It's just amazing, because now the media is covering it, but it seems like he's very accessible.
[01:37:54.427 --> 01:38:02.090]  Well, the thing is that the veil has been pulled back, and just the fact that they put out a press release, and they're acting like they've always put out a press release.
[01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:14.135]  This is the first press release I've ever seen from the Bilderberg Group, with increasing scrutiny, with the fact that they've been on CNN International now, that there have been numerous specials regarding the subject, the fact that
[01:38:14.588 --> 01:38:18.150]  There's a couple hundred people that were outside of the hotel yesterday.
[01:38:18.150 --> 01:38:21.752]  I think really pushed them into a corner to say, all right, what do we do now?
[01:38:21.752 --> 01:38:24.133]  We can't just totally and completely black it out.
[01:38:24.133 --> 01:38:27.054]  Let's try to put some sort of a positive spin on this thing.
[01:38:27.054 --> 01:38:28.895]  And they're like, there will be no press conference.
[01:38:28.895 --> 01:38:32.457]  This is all in private, but it's for the good of humanity.
[01:38:32.457 --> 01:38:35.339]  When in fact, I don't think it's for the good of humanity.
[01:38:35.339 --> 01:38:35.779]  Do you, Kevin?
[01:38:36.508 --> 01:38:41.672]  Well, I truly believe the press conference, or the press release has somewhat to do with the phone call today, actually.
[01:38:41.672 --> 01:38:44.014]  He had mentioned that there's two correspondents there.
[01:38:44.014 --> 01:38:55.863]  He didn't mention Alex Jones by name and Jim Tucker, but basically it started to seem like there was a little bit of pressure as he was going on when the world's elite are getting together and sharing ideas, which is the way he said it.
[01:38:55.863 --> 01:38:57.284]  Basically, he just said that they're just sharing ideas.
[01:38:57.284 --> 01:39:00.347]  Well, of course, that's how they spun it in the press release.
[01:39:00.347 --> 01:39:02.348]  They're sharing ideas, no policy set.
[01:39:02.348 --> 01:39:03.229]  They're total nonsense.
[01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:04.210]  Thanks for the call, Kevin.
[01:39:04.210 --> 01:39:05.611]  Let me break it down one more time.
[01:39:06.124 --> 01:39:11.207]  Alright, this is 125 to 140 of some of the most powerful people in the world.
[01:39:11.207 --> 01:39:21.253]  They will set an agenda this weekend, and then this summer, in another month, as they've put some of the instruments into place, they'll go to the Bohemian Grove, the majority of these people.
[01:39:21.253 --> 01:39:23.374]  And then they will disperse their agenda to others.
[01:39:23.374 --> 01:39:25.055]  It's called compartmentalization.
[01:39:25.055 --> 01:39:27.336]  Everybody only gets to see a part of the picture.
[01:39:27.336 --> 01:39:28.617]  And remember, there's about 3,000 attendees and guests.
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:31.981]  At Bohemian Grove.
[01:39:31.981 --> 01:39:44.211]  So they'll disperse their agenda to those elitists, those lower-level elitists that are there, and then they'll disperse their agenda to their co-workers, to their assistants, to their business projects, and so on.
[01:39:44.211 --> 01:39:49.755]  To their defense contractors, to their military-industrial complex cronies.
[01:39:49.755 --> 01:39:51.836]  Alright, let's jump to Joe in Philly.
[01:39:51.836 --> 01:39:52.377]  Joe, are you there?
[01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:53.330]  I'm here.
[01:39:53.330 --> 01:39:53.990]  How you doing?
[01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.350]  Good, man.
[01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.971]  How you doing?
[01:39:54.971 --> 01:39:56.471]  Doing pretty good.
[01:39:56.471 --> 01:40:01.032]  First of all, I just want to say, if you notice, I don't know if you've been following the news about the oil prices.
[01:40:01.032 --> 01:40:02.292]  They jumped today already.
[01:40:02.292 --> 01:40:05.113]  What'd they jump to?
[01:40:05.113 --> 01:40:06.433]  I'm not exactly sure.
[01:40:06.433 --> 01:40:07.473]  I just saw it.
[01:40:07.473 --> 01:40:07.914]  Over 140?
[01:40:07.914 --> 01:40:09.734]  I don't know.
[01:40:09.734 --> 01:40:10.154]  I don't know.
[01:40:10.154 --> 01:40:11.174]  I just saw a headline.
[01:40:11.174 --> 01:40:12.495]  Didn't click on the headline and read it.
[01:40:12.495 --> 01:40:14.875]  I just thought that that was interesting.
[01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:19.756]  Especially since I've heard, at least on NPR, that oil prices were expected to come down.
[01:40:19.756 --> 01:40:22.317]  But that's completely different from what I'm calling in for today.
[01:40:23.565 --> 01:40:27.088]  Yesterday, I found an article on Yahoo Finance.
[01:40:27.088 --> 01:40:28.729]  It's under News and Opinion.
[01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:29.950]  It was kind of hidden.
[01:40:29.950 --> 01:40:33.634]  And it talks about the Bilderberg announcing a 2008 conference.
[01:40:33.634 --> 01:40:42.162]  And it says for, and this is for press only, because I already called, you can, a list of participants is available by phone request at area code 703818.
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:46.280]  3-6-4-7.
[01:41:01.690 --> 01:41:02.290]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:05.792]  I've read names off it today, but I mean, we've got, let's go over some of them.
[01:41:05.792 --> 01:41:18.617]  Executive Committee at Deutsche Bank, we have Chase Manhattan's David Rockefeller, Bernanke is there, head of the Federal Reserve, Tom Daschle is there, Condi Rice is there, Paul Wolfowitz is there, Richard Perl is there, George Shultz is there, the head of Google.
[01:41:19.386 --> 01:41:38.231]  Is there a Queen of Spain, Queen of the Netherlands, and many, many others that we don't really know the names of that familiarly, but if you look at the businesses they're working for and the nations that they represent, this is truly the upper echelons of the elite, both in Europe and in this country.
[01:41:38.231 --> 01:41:48.113]  In fact, I'm sure I know I forwarded it to Kurt Nemo before this radio broadcast, so there should be stories with the list of the Bilderbergs burgers over at InfoWars.com.
[01:41:49.293 --> 01:41:51.675]  Okay, one more thing and I'm going to go.
[01:41:51.675 --> 01:41:58.999]  Do you guys have any opinion about the new age and what they're going to do for the new age?
[01:41:58.999 --> 01:42:06.423]  I mean they are pushing this new religion type movement where they're trying to move people away from Christianity.
[01:42:07.663 --> 01:42:09.304]  I'm not trying to disappoint all the listeners.
[01:42:09.304 --> 01:42:11.226]  I don't act like I have all the answers.
[01:42:11.226 --> 01:42:14.408]  I don't subscribe to a certain religious philosophy.
[01:42:14.408 --> 01:42:17.911]  But it does seem like they want to pull in this one-world religion.
[01:42:17.911 --> 01:42:26.977]  They love the kooky like Ray Aliens and what they do and all these different sects and nuts because they get to test things out on them, number one.
[01:42:26.977 --> 01:42:34.843]  And number two, they get to acclimate pop culture and popular society to these ideas of separate religious organizations and really
[01:42:35.370 --> 01:42:43.438]  You know, bring people away from the traditional religion of Christianity in this country, and those who are, you know, think they're true Christians, you know, also think that George Bush is a true Christian.
[01:42:43.438 --> 01:42:43.558]  Right.
[01:42:43.558 --> 01:42:44.559]  Probably at the Bohemian Grove.
[01:42:44.559 --> 01:42:44.959]  Right.
[01:42:44.959 --> 01:42:53.708]  And they're used as tools by the 700 Club and all these other guys, and I'm sure at one point those very same preachers are gonna push some sort of new religious movement.
[01:42:53.708 --> 01:42:55.830]  You know, after all, they don't believe what they're preaching.
[01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:58.673]  They believe in the almighty dollar and the elite they serve, man.
[01:43:00.490 --> 01:43:01.010]  Very good.
[01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.971]  Alright, thanks Joe.
[01:43:01.971 --> 01:43:05.492]  Oh, by the way, oil rises more than $7 to new record high.
[01:43:05.492 --> 01:43:06.073]  Alright, man.
[01:43:06.073 --> 01:43:07.113]  Wow, great.
[01:43:07.113 --> 01:43:07.693]  Thanks, guys.
[01:43:07.693 --> 01:43:08.334]  Thanks, man.
[01:43:08.334 --> 01:43:10.475]  Alright, let's go to Starvos in Canada.
[01:43:10.475 --> 01:43:12.315]  Starvos, are you with me?
[01:43:12.315 --> 01:43:12.836]  Hello?
[01:43:12.836 --> 01:43:13.556]  Hey, yes.
[01:43:13.556 --> 01:43:16.257]  Hey, Jason, you're doing a great job on behalf of Alex.
[01:43:16.257 --> 01:43:17.178]  Thank you.
[01:43:17.178 --> 01:43:17.998]  You're very welcome.
[01:43:17.998 --> 01:43:22.180]  I'm calling here from Canada, and I'd like to talk about a couple of things.
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:26.502]  The first of which is a Yahoo group, which is called Bush Did 9-11.
[01:43:27.661 --> 01:43:36.629]  It is a phenomenal site, it has a lot of links and free videos and books on it, so you just search the Yahoo Group's Bush Day 9-11 and you'll find it.
[01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:41.113]  The second thing is about this North American Union.
[01:43:41.113 --> 01:43:53.825]  People have to understand that this is a new political entity that's being created, and when you have a new political entity being created, the ones who are creating it are going to have a blank slate, carte blanche,
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:55.480]  To do whatever they want.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:00.541]  They're going to write whatever legislation they want, and they're going to enforce it however they want.
[01:44:00.541 --> 01:44:06.843]  So, the Constitution, Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, are going to be totally wiped out.
[01:44:06.843 --> 01:44:07.783]  They're out the window.
[01:44:07.783 --> 01:44:09.364]  It's just like what they're doing with the EU.
[01:44:09.364 --> 01:44:12.264]  It started with trade agreements, now they're building a constitution.
[01:44:12.264 --> 01:44:13.765]  It's all about eroding sovereignty.
[01:44:13.765 --> 01:44:20.026]  It's all about bringing in a North American Union with Canada, the United States, and Mexico at the helm.
[01:44:20.026 --> 01:44:21.266]  Yeah, that's correct.
[01:44:21.266 --> 01:44:22.667]  And also that's why the
[01:44:23.627 --> 01:44:31.916]  Some Toronto 9-11 truth movement over here in Canada is having a demonstration against that on June 14th between 1 and 4 p.m.
[01:44:31.916 --> 01:44:36.562]  So people up here in Toronto or the greater Toronto area can come out.
[01:44:36.562 --> 01:44:41.607]  It's going to be at Queen's Park and we're going to have a large number of speakers demonstrating against this and
[01:44:42.458 --> 01:44:47.640]  Publicly telling everybody why this is not a good idea, and that this is very, very dangerous.
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.121]  Excellent.
[01:44:48.121 --> 01:44:49.261]  Way to stay active, Star Wars.
[01:44:49.261 --> 01:44:50.442]  I gotta jump to the next caller.
[01:44:50.442 --> 01:44:51.742]  That's what we all need to do.
[01:44:51.742 --> 01:44:52.743]  We need to get active.
[01:44:52.743 --> 01:44:54.683]  We need to, you know, organize these things.
[01:44:54.683 --> 01:44:56.344]  We need to share information.
[01:44:56.344 --> 01:44:58.585]  You know, I'm one of those guys that likes to make videos.
[01:44:58.585 --> 01:45:07.389]  I'd like you to take those videos, make copies, and hand them out to people, to have screenings, to show people this information, to get active, to become a Luke Radowsky.
[01:45:07.389 --> 01:45:11.951]  I mean, Luke Radowsky, one of the most amazing human beings I've ever come across on this Earth.
[01:45:13.564 --> 01:45:17.607]  I mean, a young guy getting out there with a bullhorn, finding a way to Chantilly, Virginia.
[01:45:17.607 --> 01:45:19.349]  Folks, this guy's got a lot on his plate.
[01:45:19.349 --> 01:45:22.311]  He's a young, young person trying to go to college, okay?
[01:45:22.311 --> 01:45:34.581]  He's trying to defeat the globalists in their grand master plan to bring in what they like to call people like Kissinger, people like Brown, people like Blair, people like Bush, people like Cheney.
[01:45:34.581 --> 01:45:37.203]  They like to call it the New World Order.
[01:45:37.203 --> 01:45:39.705]  It is their term for it.
[01:45:39.705 --> 01:45:41.747]  All right, let's jump to Art in Kansas.
[01:45:41.747 --> 01:45:42.567]  Art, are you with me?
[01:45:42.567 --> 01:45:43.168]  Hi, Jason.
[01:45:43.496 --> 01:45:44.177]  How are you?
[01:45:44.177 --> 01:45:46.098]  I wish you had your own show.
[01:45:46.098 --> 01:45:49.241]  Well, you know, I used to have my own show on GCN weekly.
[01:45:49.241 --> 01:45:51.363]  I used to do five nights a week on and off.
[01:45:51.363 --> 01:45:56.328]  It's awfully tough to keep up with and I don't have all this cool equipment myself.
[01:45:56.328 --> 01:45:58.790]  The cool equipment makes the show just a little bit better.
[01:46:00.129 --> 01:46:04.211]  Uh, that list, that Build-A-Burger list, I don't think that's going to list everybody.
[01:46:04.211 --> 01:46:05.011]  Oh, no, it is.
[01:46:05.011 --> 01:46:05.971]  It's got all of them.
[01:46:05.971 --> 01:46:06.792]  I guarantee it.
[01:46:06.792 --> 01:46:08.452]  I'll tell you what it doesn't have.
[01:46:08.452 --> 01:46:10.933]  It'll probably have 10 or... Well, hold on.
[01:46:10.933 --> 01:46:16.055]  It'll probably won't have the 10 or 15 guests that they're going to meet with in other locations.
[01:46:16.055 --> 01:46:16.415]  Right.
[01:46:16.415 --> 01:46:20.677]  Yeah, I'm with you there, and you know, that's what I said in the past two days on the run-up.
[01:46:20.677 --> 01:46:22.818]  I said, you know, they're having this in Chantilly, Virginia.
[01:46:22.818 --> 01:46:27.280]  It gives them an awful great access to military insiders,
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:29.241]  How about Michelle Obama?
[01:46:29.241 --> 01:46:29.821]  She's CFR.
[01:46:50.814 --> 01:46:53.016]  She's absolutely CFR, but so is Obama.
[01:46:53.016 --> 01:46:57.338]  I mean, Obama goes out there and says, well, I'm not CFR, but have I spoken in front of them?
[01:46:57.338 --> 01:46:57.719]  Of course.
[01:46:57.719 --> 01:46:59.280]  Have I attended their meetings?
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:00.140]  Of course.
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:02.041]  So he's as CFR as they get.
[01:47:02.041 --> 01:47:04.563]  You know, he's married to a member of the organization.
[01:47:04.563 --> 01:47:06.504]  He speaks before the organization.
[01:47:06.504 --> 01:47:09.306]  He attends conferences with the organization.
[01:47:09.306 --> 01:47:11.888]  He knows damn well what the Council on Foreign Relations is.
[01:47:12.368 --> 01:47:16.552]  And it's just unfortunate that he's so charismatic and such a good speaker.
[01:47:16.552 --> 01:47:23.939]  People are going to be sold on this snake oil salesman in the same respect they were sold on Clinton in the 90s because he carries himself well.
[01:47:23.939 --> 01:47:32.087]  And we've had eight years of somebody who doesn't, somebody who says dumb things, of somebody who's so publicly inept.
[01:47:32.087 --> 01:47:34.809]  The argument is that him and his administration couldn't
[01:47:35.899 --> 01:47:45.023]  Couldn't at all carry out 9-11, and I don't think Bush could have, but his administration, parts of it, you know, people like Wolfowitz, people like Cheney, people like Rice, people like Rumsfeld, you bet they could.
[01:47:45.023 --> 01:47:46.103]  And his brothers.
[01:47:46.103 --> 01:47:46.624]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:47:46.624 --> 01:47:48.144]  Well, Jeb Bush is a lot smarter than he is.
[01:47:48.144 --> 01:47:49.285]  So is Neil Bush.
[01:47:49.285 --> 01:47:50.025]  That's it.
[01:47:50.025 --> 01:47:50.825]  You know, I'm with you.
[01:47:50.825 --> 01:47:59.289]  I mean, Jeb Bush declares martial law in the days before 9-11 in Florida, knowing his brother is going to be in Florida on 9-11.
[01:47:59.289 --> 01:48:03.871]  You know, Neil Bush running security at Dulles Airport and the World Trade Center prior to 9-11.
[01:48:04.881 --> 01:48:06.662]  I mean, what are the chances, right?
[01:48:06.662 --> 01:48:07.503]  Uh-huh.
[01:48:07.503 --> 01:48:11.626]  Yeah, it's all very mysterious to me, but people, you know, want to turn a blind eye.
[01:48:11.626 --> 01:48:13.067]  They want to turn on the playoffs.
[01:48:13.067 --> 01:48:14.208]  You know, it's the finals.
[01:48:14.208 --> 01:48:16.169]  Also, Edwards is Bilderberg.
[01:48:16.169 --> 01:48:16.650]  Oh, big time.
[01:48:16.650 --> 01:48:18.511]  He's gone twice now, publicly.
[01:48:18.511 --> 01:48:20.913]  And you mentioned our Governor Sebelius?
[01:48:20.913 --> 01:48:21.953]  Oh, you're in Kansas?
[01:48:21.953 --> 01:48:23.515]  Yeah, she went there last year.
[01:48:23.515 --> 01:48:24.275]  She's here this year.
[01:48:24.275 --> 01:48:25.136]  She's on the list today.
[01:48:25.136 --> 01:48:28.618]  Yeah, and she's an abortion-loving Catholic.
[01:48:28.618 --> 01:48:29.139]  There you go.
[01:48:29.139 --> 01:48:30.720]  And they go hand-in-hand, apparently.
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:32.121]  Art, I thank you for the call.
[01:48:32.734 --> 01:48:56.559]  This is the Alex Jones Show, folks, and if you want to see a live feed, I think it's down right now, but over at wearechange.org, they are broadcasting from time to time, and although now is not one of those times, I think they have the first 25 minutes of their broadcast over there, so you can just click on that, and that's Alex Jones, Luke Radowski, and others in the 9-11 Truth Movement bullhorning Bilderberg.
[01:48:56.559 --> 01:48:59.300]  Bullhorning what are our globalist masters.
[01:48:59.813 --> 01:49:21.447]  The people who are plotting against us, who want to control us, who want to enslave us, who want to further turn us into this consumerist culture of morons, of Neanderthals, of people who cannot contemplate what is truly going on, what the true political paradigm is of corporate military-industrial complex.
[01:49:21.447 --> 01:49:22.347]  That's what it is.
[01:49:22.347 --> 01:49:26.370]  It's a corporate military-industrial complex interest for globalization.
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:27.841]  That's what it is.
[01:49:27.841 --> 01:49:29.201]  It is not right and left.
[01:49:29.201 --> 01:49:30.742]  It is not Republican and Democrat.
[01:49:30.742 --> 01:49:32.804]  It is not conservative and liberal.
[01:49:32.804 --> 01:49:44.371]  Those are all terms, nomenclature, to get you accustomed to one or the other, to get you accustomed to a false choice, to a lie, to nonsense.
[01:49:44.371 --> 01:49:54.057]  We're going to be having Daniel Estillan on, by the way, in about 50 minutes, at half past the hour on one, and he's going to give his take on the list that's leaked, the press conference.
[01:49:54.057 --> 01:49:55.297]  Of course, he is the author of
[01:49:56.414 --> 01:49:56.714]  That's right.
[01:50:09.963 --> 01:50:10.643]  You're fired.
[01:50:10.643 --> 01:50:12.425]  We're carrying to all of Alex's films.
[01:50:12.425 --> 01:50:17.368]  We're carrying, of course, Loose Change, The Final Cut, and Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[01:50:17.368 --> 01:50:27.555]  And, uh, if you're interested in my point of view, I throw up a little blog over at loosechange911.com or you can get at me at myspace.com slash Jason Bermas, B-E-R-M-A-S.
[01:50:27.555 --> 01:50:32.198]  But if you want the final hour live video feed, you gotta be a prisonplanet.tv member.
[01:50:32.198 --> 01:50:34.039]  And believe me, folks, it's worth it.
[01:50:34.039 --> 01:50:34.680]  We're gonna be back.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.641]  Hopefully Alex will be calling in from Bilderberg 2008.
[01:50:43.211 --> 01:50:43.753]  We're good.
[01:50:51.707 --> 01:51:02.454]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seemed so difficult.
[01:51:02.454 --> 01:51:12.281]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:51:12.281 --> 01:51:13.042]  Drinking water?
[01:51:13.542 --> 01:51:15.203]  Now that's something I can handle.
[01:51:15.203 --> 01:51:20.885]  The guys at Snyder Health took the time to explain all of the different options and help me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[01:51:20.885 --> 01:51:32.991]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great!
[01:51:32.991 --> 01:51:35.632]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.
[01:51:40.014 --> 01:51:44.881]  They offer a full 30-day money-back guarantee and free shipping, so there's absolutely no risk.
[01:51:44.881 --> 01:51:47.725]  You can visit them on the web at SnyderHealth.com.
[01:51:47.725 --> 01:51:51.590]  That's S-N-Y-D-E-R-Health.com.
[01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:52.912]  It is a big idea.
[01:51:54.051 --> 01:51:55.812]  A New World Order.
[01:51:55.812 --> 01:52:00.693]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:52:00.693 --> 01:52:03.534]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:52:03.534 --> 01:52:06.315]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:52:06.315 --> 01:52:09.496]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:52:09.496 --> 01:52:16.818]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:52:19.852 --> 01:52:25.296]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:52:25.296 --> 01:52:29.158]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:52:29.158 --> 01:52:31.720]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:32.901]  Most people have no idea.
[01:52:32.901 --> 01:52:33.681]  They're not after money.
[01:52:33.681 --> 01:52:34.962]  They have all the money they need.
[01:52:34.962 --> 01:52:35.943]  They're after power.
[01:52:35.943 --> 01:52:37.084]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:54:13.074 --> 01:54:14.715]  My boys rage against the machine.
[01:54:14.715 --> 01:54:17.377]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:17.377 --> 01:54:20.980]  And Alex is out there at Bilderberg bullhorning and getting in their face.
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:21.620]  We got the list.
[01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:22.621]  We got the press release.
[01:54:22.621 --> 01:54:24.162]  It's unbelievable.
[01:54:24.162 --> 01:54:25.684]  They're being exposed.
[01:54:25.684 --> 01:54:26.845]  Alex Jones is with us.
[01:54:26.845 --> 01:54:29.967]  Alex, just incredible work down there.
[01:54:29.967 --> 01:54:31.448]  Brothers, it's been amazing.
[01:54:31.448 --> 01:54:38.173]  And I wanted to tell you that Philly 9-11 Truth, there's more coming in and out.
[01:54:38.173 --> 01:54:38.714]  It's incredible.
[01:54:39.406 --> 01:54:43.289]  They got Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke going out, right guys?
[01:54:43.289 --> 01:54:43.909]  I've seen the video.
[01:54:43.909 --> 01:54:45.210]  I've blown up his face on the video.
[01:54:45.210 --> 01:54:46.170]  Yeah, he's on the list.
[01:54:46.170 --> 01:54:48.412]  He's on the official list sitting in front of me, sure.
[01:54:48.412 --> 01:54:51.234]  So, Fed Chairman Bernanke on video.
[01:54:51.234 --> 01:54:52.194]  We just got that.
[01:54:52.194 --> 01:54:54.436]  And here are the guys.
[01:54:54.436 --> 01:54:56.257]  Here come more with police escorts.
[01:54:56.257 --> 01:54:57.278]  It's just wild.
[01:54:57.278 --> 01:55:00.099]  Yeah, there's a big setup coming down about to turn.
[01:55:00.099 --> 01:55:01.100]  It's just amazing out here.
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:02.961]  It's like tropically hot, though.
[01:55:02.961 --> 01:55:04.462]  I mean, 100% humidity.
[01:55:04.462 --> 01:55:08.765]  Let's get your take on the fact that they put out a press release this year and they actually gave away the list.
[01:55:10.071 --> 01:55:19.437]  Well, you see, Jim Tucker says, and that's basically my take on it, but he confers and concurs, is that we've exposed them.
[01:55:19.437 --> 01:55:21.278]  We've totally blown them wide open.
[01:55:21.278 --> 01:55:24.300]  But the big issue is they put a press release out.
[01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:30.664]  It has a way to say, yeah, we're public, but then none of the newspapers or magazines will report on it.
[01:55:30.664 --> 01:55:37.508]  And just a quick directive to Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson and all them, a lot of people are telling us that they're emailing photos.
[01:55:37.950 --> 01:55:39.111]  But they've taken video stills.
[01:55:39.111 --> 01:55:40.592]  They've taken videos.
[01:55:40.592 --> 01:55:44.274]  I need to make sure we scour through all the emails that are coming in.
[01:55:44.274 --> 01:55:49.197]  Maybe get into Aaron's emails and others to make sure that we're getting all the photos up.
[01:55:49.197 --> 01:55:51.739]  On PrisonPlanet.com, on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:51.739 --> 01:55:58.283]  I don't have to tell people how important it is that the stories that Paul Watson has written and that Kurt have written need to be emailed out to everybody.
[01:55:58.283 --> 01:55:59.884]  We're the only media here.
[01:55:59.884 --> 01:56:03.366]  We're here covering it in 95 degree, 100% humidity.
[01:56:03.366 --> 01:56:04.026]  I'm not complaining.
[01:56:04.026 --> 01:56:06.828]  I'm just saying we're out here really busting our butts to get this footage.
[01:56:07.938 --> 01:56:16.243]  And we want everybody to, you know, really spread the word about what's happening out here in the developments that have been taking place.
[01:56:16.243 --> 01:56:36.876]  And we also want everybody to thank Coast to Coast AM, because other than this radio show and Genesis Network, which is on quite a few MNFM stations, obviously Coast to Coast is a lot bigger, they have been having me on each night, the last three nights, it's not only the last night, Monday, I mean Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, now Friday tonight, with a little five and ten minute reports in the first hour.
[01:56:38.218 --> 01:56:54.408]  That has really given us a lot of protection because we had them pull a fire alarm on us, we had them threaten to arrest us, we had FBI guys come in, diplomatic security services come in and try to get us to say we were going to do violent things.
[01:56:54.408 --> 01:56:59.772]  They have announced themselves, the State Department Diplomatic Security Services, at two people's homes have given us their names, interviews.
[01:56:59.772 --> 01:57:02.893]  Remember the guy a week and a half ago that posted a real good video of inside the hotel?
[01:57:03.962 --> 01:57:06.423]  And the other guy that posted the video driving around inside?
[01:57:06.423 --> 01:57:07.063]  Yep.
[01:57:07.063 --> 01:57:11.544]  They got their plate numbers and came to their houses in front of their kids and threatened them.
[01:57:11.544 --> 01:57:15.265]  So I mean, these are just nice families.
[01:57:15.265 --> 01:57:17.465]  No First Amendment anymore, Alex.
[01:57:17.465 --> 01:57:22.367]  Well, that's what this is all about in this country now, is our military, our police, our marines.
[01:57:22.367 --> 01:57:24.007]  I forgot that part.
[01:57:24.007 --> 01:57:27.388]  We've talked to at least eight different witnesses, and through the woods I saw guys in camo.
[01:57:27.853 --> 01:57:29.294]  They weren't police uniforms.
[01:57:29.294 --> 01:57:48.080]  They looked like Marine uniforms, but some of the guys I talked to who we've interviewed and who we've confirmed, don't even forget Richard, we've got to go get more interviews with them, who tried to drive in Marines, you know, first police, then feds, Secret Service types, and then Marines come up with their guns and say, boy, we'll take you down to Military Brig in Virginia and you'll never be seen again.
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:54.702]  So we actually have Guantanamo Bay type threats going on right now here.
[01:57:54.702 --> 01:57:56.743]  So it's not fun.
[01:57:57.903 --> 01:58:03.565]  But at the same time, it is exhilarating and empowering to be standing up against this tyranny.
[01:58:03.565 --> 01:58:06.746]  Guys, 9-11 Philly Truth!
[01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:10.328]  Here, introduce yourself to Jason Mermis and tell folks about what you saw in Bernanke.
[01:58:10.328 --> 01:58:11.568]  Both of you guys were really well spoken.
[01:58:11.568 --> 01:58:13.589]  Please repeat what you said earlier.
[01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:14.749]  Alex, let's get them on the other side.
[01:58:14.749 --> 01:58:20.111]  It's the end of the segment and I want to get your take on the Obama and Hillary meeting over in D.C.
[01:58:20.111 --> 01:58:22.172]  It's the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.com.

[02:00:09.927 --> 02:00:12.748]  Alright, folks, we're out of the command center in Austin, Texas.
[02:00:12.748 --> 02:00:16.249]  Right now, Alex Jones is in Chantilly, Virginia.
[02:00:16.249 --> 02:00:16.809]  Bilderberg, 2008.
[02:00:16.809 --> 02:00:18.449]  We just had him on the line.
[02:00:18.449 --> 02:00:20.150]  Do we have Philly 911 Truth with us right now?
[02:00:21.058 --> 02:00:23.279]  Yeah, this is Nick Horangio filling out 11 Truth.
[02:00:23.279 --> 02:00:24.360]  Hey, Jason, how you doing?
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:24.780]  Great, man.
[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:28.282]  Why don't you give us an update on what's going down in Chantilly?
[02:00:28.282 --> 02:00:28.902]  All right, yeah.
[02:00:28.902 --> 02:00:32.904]  Here at Ground Zero, Chantilly, Virginia, with the Bilderberg Conference.
[02:00:32.904 --> 02:00:36.486]  We just had a sighting of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.
[02:00:36.486 --> 02:00:47.491]  We went around to the front of the mass larger body of the group, and instead of taking the entire group, we left a few stay-behind operatives, sort of like Gladio, just kind of being outposts.
[02:00:47.491 --> 02:00:49.192]  And luckily, through that method of
[02:00:49.696 --> 02:00:54.098]  In an organization, we were able to capture the Fed Chair as he exited the Bilderberg Conference.
[02:00:54.098 --> 02:00:58.099]  And Phil Figueroa is actually the fellow who captured it.
[02:00:58.099 --> 02:01:02.040]  He got a pretty exclusive shot, so I'm going to let him take it from here, what he thinks about it all.
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:03.021]  Alright.
[02:01:03.021 --> 02:01:04.501]  Hey, Jason, how you doing?
[02:01:04.501 --> 02:01:05.041]  Great, man.
[02:01:05.041 --> 02:01:05.982]  How are you?
[02:01:05.982 --> 02:01:06.522]  Good, man.
[02:01:06.522 --> 02:01:07.802]  I'm Phil Figueroa.
[02:01:07.802 --> 02:01:09.723]  I'm from Philadelphia Truth.
[02:01:09.723 --> 02:01:14.325]  And I was staying behind on the side entrance.
[02:01:14.325 --> 02:01:15.645]  Everybody went to the front entrance.
[02:01:16.215 --> 02:01:29.466]  And all of a sudden I see a police escort, there's two black limousines in the back, cars, and then I was just, I had my camera focused, and then on the back seat of the first black car was Bernanke.
[02:01:29.466 --> 02:01:30.967]  And I was like, wow, it's Bernanke.
[02:01:30.967 --> 02:01:32.088]  I was like, whoa.
[02:01:32.088 --> 02:01:39.113]  And yeah, he was on his Blackberry, and he had his tinted windows, like he had some, you know, real gall, like, just... He's a man.
[02:01:39.113 --> 02:01:42.576]  Yeah, he's the guy who's killing our country through, you know,
[02:01:43.212 --> 02:01:46.535]  Well, they're all blinging out.
[02:01:46.535 --> 02:01:51.940]  I mean, did you hear about the fact that the Department of Justice purchased 125 iPods to ship there?
[02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:53.422]  Yeah, I heard about that yesterday.
[02:01:53.422 --> 02:01:55.063]  It's unbelievable.
[02:01:55.063 --> 02:01:56.024]  Unbelievable.
[02:01:56.024 --> 02:01:56.665]  Public money?
[02:01:56.665 --> 02:01:57.786]  I mean, that's nuts.
[02:01:57.786 --> 02:02:02.010]  But him being here and him showing his face, I mean, he has a police escort.
[02:02:02.010 --> 02:02:06.774]  You think he's working for the government, but no, he's working for the private Federal Reserve.
[02:02:07.362 --> 02:02:14.006]  And, you know, he just shows where his true allegiances are, and that's to the international bankers, you know, that run this country and the world.
[02:02:14.006 --> 02:02:16.008]  So, I mean, it's real bad.
[02:02:16.008 --> 02:02:18.770]  And he doesn't even, like, he just has the gall, no tinted windows.
[02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:30.517]  I mean, yesterday we saw a bunch of people there, you know, cowards, you know, with their tinted windows, and they're having their coats cut on the hangers in the back, covering their faces, reading the newspaper, but not this guy.
[02:02:30.517 --> 02:02:35.120]  I mean, I don't know if he got word that most of us were in the front.
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:36.021]  I think that's what it was.
[02:02:37.921 --> 02:02:43.983]  Yeah, I was with some guys from AFP and I think they got some good shots of him too.
[02:02:43.983 --> 02:02:46.144]  But yeah, that was it.
[02:02:46.144 --> 02:02:47.964]  It was nuts.
[02:02:47.964 --> 02:02:50.405]  Yeah man, it's pretty incredible the turnout there.
[02:02:50.405 --> 02:02:52.306]  You know, yesterday I saw a bunch of people there.
[02:02:52.306 --> 02:02:55.487]  I saw like 25 people there while Alex was bullhorning.
[02:02:55.487 --> 02:02:59.908]  Right now, the live stream is back up over at wearechange.org.
[02:02:59.908 --> 02:03:02.789]  You can see Luke Radowski and Rob Jacobson outside.
[02:03:04.109 --> 02:03:14.197]  Outside of the Bilderberg meeting and his sweltering heat, and it's just so good to know that we have at least pushed the mainstream media into admitting that there is a Bilderberg conference, that it is secret.
[02:03:14.197 --> 02:03:22.443]  They're admitting that it's secret, but it's also there can be open and candid about our enslavement and not have to have any repercussions whatsoever.
[02:03:22.443 --> 02:03:30.790]  When you speak to that, the privacy of this meeting and the fact that, you know, there's little to no chance that any of the policy that's discussed will come out in an open forum.
[02:03:31.604 --> 02:03:33.045]  Yeah, it's really unbelievable.
[02:03:33.045 --> 02:03:35.407]  I mean, I guess we are changed.
[02:03:35.407 --> 02:03:39.490]  I got a video of Bill Clinton that you were talking about the other day.
[02:03:39.490 --> 02:03:49.677]  I was listening to you and you were saying, you know, how he basically admitted that they were negotiating NATO policy before he got to the Bilderberg meeting, you know.
[02:03:49.677 --> 02:03:52.620]  And by the way, the head of NATO security is there right now.
[02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:54.741]  He is on the list.
[02:03:54.741 --> 02:03:56.342]  Of course he is.
[02:03:56.342 --> 02:04:01.106]  And Jim Tucker, actually, I guess he got a press release from Newswire that's like
[02:04:01.596 --> 02:04:02.876]  Yeah, Cyberterrorism exactly.
[02:04:02.876 --> 02:04:03.777]  They're confronting us now.
[02:04:17.401 --> 02:04:22.923]  Yeah, yeah, we're the cyber terrorists because we're the ones reporting this in a live and open forum to the world.
[02:04:22.923 --> 02:04:24.703]  We're doing the journalist's job!
[02:04:24.703 --> 02:04:30.825]  Unfortunately, the people that control the journalists are inside that very meeting right now.
[02:04:30.825 --> 02:04:32.345]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[02:08:02.398 --> 02:08:03.660]  Alright, folks, we are back.
[02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:04.741]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:04.741 --> 02:08:10.389]  I am Jason Bermas, and remember, you can see this live feed over at Bilderberg at wearechanged.org.
[02:08:10.389 --> 02:08:15.216]  We're going to be posting some of that over at, I think there's a mirror, over at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:08:15.216 --> 02:08:17.379]  Do I still have Philly911Truth with me?
[02:08:17.379 --> 02:08:18.040]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:08:18.482 --> 02:08:19.262]  Yes, Phil here.
[02:08:19.262 --> 02:08:19.883]  Oh, that was great.
[02:08:19.883 --> 02:08:21.264]  Yeah, Nick got him on that real good.
[02:08:21.264 --> 02:08:21.924]  Oh, definitely.
[02:08:21.924 --> 02:08:22.684]  Yeah, that's great.
[02:08:41.363 --> 02:08:45.504]  That was my only criticism of loose change.
[02:08:45.504 --> 02:08:50.885]  The new one didn't go into that aspect more, but there was only so much you could put in there.
[02:08:50.885 --> 02:08:51.926]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:08:51.926 --> 02:08:53.526]  I mean, it's a two-hour plus movie.
[02:08:53.526 --> 02:08:54.806]  I hear you.
[02:08:54.806 --> 02:08:56.727]  I'm glad to hear you're making another one, though.
[02:08:56.727 --> 02:08:57.407]  That's good.
[02:08:57.407 --> 02:09:07.990]  Yeah, well, we're trying to go into how this was financed, how it was carried out, who were the patsies, what role did everybody play, because obviously there was a lot of compartmentalization going on.
[02:09:08.857 --> 02:09:12.258]  And, uh, you know, that's what the Pakistani ISI was there to do.
[02:09:12.258 --> 02:09:20.500]  They were there to fund the hijackers through our allies to cause plausible deniability between our intelligence agencies and theirs.
[02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:24.281]  Yeah, let me put Nick on so we can talk about the Bob Graham confrontation.
[02:09:24.281 --> 02:09:25.221]  Absolutely.
[02:09:25.221 --> 02:09:26.901]  Alright, here he is.
[02:09:26.901 --> 02:09:30.682]  Yeah, well, uh, quick run through the Bob Graham confrontation.
[02:09:30.682 --> 02:09:38.284]  Besides challenging him about several of the 9-11 whistleblowers, of course, we brought up Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer and Isabelle Edmonds, which he denied any knowledge of.
[02:09:38.737 --> 02:09:43.864]  Specifically, we brought up the issue that he received pre-911 intelligence about R.G.
[02:09:43.864 --> 02:09:47.730]  Abbas, a supposed operative of Osama bin Laden.
[02:09:47.730 --> 02:09:49.653]  That was the Randy Glass information?
[02:09:49.653 --> 02:09:53.779]  Right, Randy Glass, who basically was working as an undercover arms salesman.
[02:09:54.742 --> 02:09:59.227]  Yeah, there was even an MSNBC special on the whole entire thing.
[02:10:10.814 --> 02:10:19.801]  He and another Florida Senator, I can't remember his name, Porter Goss, and they were both meeting with the head of the ISI and they are the co-chairs of the initial congressional investigation.
[02:10:19.801 --> 02:10:31.970]  A lot of people don't know that the lead Democrat on that was also Nancy Pelosi, so you can't expect her to want to reinvestigate 9-11 when she was part of the original congressional cover-up where 27 pages were redacted.
[02:10:31.970 --> 02:10:32.550]  Definitely.
[02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:33.371]  But here's the thing.
[02:10:33.371 --> 02:10:36.693]  Randy Glass had more than just paper transactions.
[02:10:36.693 --> 02:10:38.034]  He sent communiques,
[02:10:38.762 --> 02:10:39.183]  I hope so.
[02:10:56.523 --> 02:11:02.568]  Yeah, you know, I don't want to come down on people, I don't know the entire situation, but yeah, I'm with you on that.
[02:11:02.568 --> 02:11:08.473]  In challenging Graham on that issue, it's like, you bring it up that he received the pre-9-11 intel that R.G.
[02:11:08.473 --> 02:11:18.501]  Abbas is plotting to destroy the World Trade Centers, and again and again, you have Glass pleading with him, saying, what are you doing to follow up with this information?
[02:11:18.501 --> 02:11:23.585]  And his staffer, Charlie Younts, affirms that yes, the Senator is taking action.
[02:11:24.082 --> 02:11:34.005]  And then a few months later, 9-11 transpires, and ever since then, Graham has denied ever receiving Glass prior to September 11th.
[02:11:34.005 --> 02:11:39.026]  Eventually, he did say that he received them after the attacks, but now he's even rescinded that completely.
[02:11:39.026 --> 02:11:42.687]  He denied any knowledge whatsoever of Randy Glass or that issue.
[02:11:42.687 --> 02:11:51.009]  Absolutely, he has to deny it, because once he says that he knows about it, he becomes a little bit more criminally culpable, and he's obviously hiding a lot.
[02:11:51.587 --> 02:11:56.349]  Right, he's a total shill for the September 11th criminals, whomever they may be.
[02:11:56.349 --> 02:11:59.211]  One of the more apologetic shills, I'll give him that.
[02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:01.552]  So what's the plan for tonight?
[02:12:01.552 --> 02:12:06.535]  Well, real quick, yeah, another apologetic shill we just got.
[02:12:06.535 --> 02:12:09.916]  Richard A. Clark, excuse me.
[02:12:09.916 --> 02:12:11.617]  We just got him the other day.
[02:12:11.617 --> 02:12:16.980]  We brought up W1999, the internal memorandum that was circulating within the FBI and CIA.
[02:12:17.685 --> 02:12:20.966]  Mufasa Bin Laden, the Bin Laden brother-in-law?
[02:12:20.966 --> 02:12:39.294]  Calling agents off of WAMI, the World Assembly of Muslim Youth, and eventually used again up until 2001 to basically stop the investigations, like what we saw with Colleen Rowley, Robert Wright, Harry Samet, all these investigations getting killed as part of the W199I issue.
[02:12:39.294 --> 02:12:41.254]  Greg Pallas, of course, did the research into that.
[02:12:41.254 --> 02:12:42.155]  He has the document.
[02:12:42.155 --> 02:12:42.875]  He's only given about
[02:12:43.175 --> 02:12:50.920]  Two pages from what I can see on the internet, but what we do know of it, it's pretty much, it's conducive to the whole September 11th conspiracy, of course.
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:55.022]  So he denied any knowledge whatsoever of the W1999 issue.
[02:12:55.022 --> 02:13:02.827]  He also denied any knowledge whatsoever of Sabel Edmonds, although he was, you know, the terrorism czar at that point in time in 2002.
[02:13:02.827 --> 02:13:09.851]  So he's obviously, although he's the one that said, we failed you, and he takes the onus on himself and sort of placates and, you know, ossifies
[02:13:11.237 --> 02:13:15.319]  Yeah, he's a total show yet again.
[02:13:15.319 --> 02:13:17.040]  I'm with you on that.
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:18.501]  We have to keep the pressure on him.
[02:13:18.501 --> 02:13:21.363]  And he's on tour with his new book, Your Government Failed You.
[02:13:21.363 --> 02:13:22.144]  You hear that, folks?
[02:13:22.144 --> 02:13:23.264]  You want to get involved?
[02:13:23.264 --> 02:13:25.006]  You want to be part of the media?
[02:13:25.006 --> 02:13:26.547]  Go to his book signing.
[02:13:26.547 --> 02:13:27.727]  Ask him a tough question.
[02:13:27.727 --> 02:13:31.350]  Just go on to Google right now and just type book signings.
[02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:32.691]  And you will find Richard Clarke.
[02:13:32.691 --> 02:13:34.112]  You will find Richard Haass.
[02:13:34.112 --> 02:13:39.215]  You will find all of these criminal elitists that we're seeing today here at the Bilderberg Conference.
[02:13:39.531 --> 02:13:43.113]  I didn't see those two former ones I mentioned, but we certainly are seeing enough.
[02:13:43.113 --> 02:13:47.034]  I mean, there's sketchy reports of Paul Wolfowitz.
[02:13:47.034 --> 02:13:48.095]  No, Wolfowitz is there.
[02:13:48.095 --> 02:13:48.795]  He's on the list.
[02:13:48.795 --> 02:13:51.576]  Wolfowitz is there, Condoleezza Rice is there.
[02:13:51.576 --> 02:13:58.760]  I haven't read the list as of yet, but what we did see yesterday was definitely heavy guards, armed entourage, police escorts.
[02:13:59.628 --> 02:13:59.988]  I don't know.
[02:14:22.155 --> 02:14:22.856]  400 miles.
[02:14:22.856 --> 02:14:23.776]  Make the drive.
[02:14:23.776 --> 02:14:24.416]  Make the drive.
[02:14:24.416 --> 02:14:25.037]  Come out here.
[02:14:25.037 --> 02:14:26.137]  Take the flight if you have to.
[02:14:26.137 --> 02:14:27.658]  We're going to be here until Sunday.
[02:14:27.658 --> 02:14:31.800]  They're going to be leaving and of course we're going to catch them scurrying away back to their whatever nest.
[02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:33.901]  Like the cockroaches they are.
[02:14:33.901 --> 02:14:35.122]  Alright, man.
[02:14:35.122 --> 02:14:36.723]  I thank you guys for the call and the update.
[02:14:36.723 --> 02:14:38.463]  I'm going to jump to some other callers.
[02:14:38.463 --> 02:14:41.625]  Keep us updated and keep up the great work.
[02:14:41.625 --> 02:14:44.547]  We'll have more reports as the weekend proceeds.
[02:14:44.547 --> 02:14:45.287]  Alright, thank you brother.
[02:14:45.629 --> 02:14:48.851]  There it is, Bilderberg, 2008, live from Chantilly, Virginia.
[02:14:48.851 --> 02:14:53.014]  You're only going to get it on this radio broadcast, the Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:53.014 --> 02:14:58.018]  And this show is made possible through our sponsors, such as Enerfood.
[02:14:58.018 --> 02:15:02.521]  We all know that stress weakens your mind, inhibiting your ability to focus on the things that truly matter.
[02:15:02.521 --> 02:15:03.662]  Fight back with Enerfood.
[02:15:03.662 --> 02:15:07.025]  Practically every one of us up here are absolutely addicted to this stuff.
[02:15:07.025 --> 02:15:08.466]  It is really all over the office, folks.
[02:15:08.806 --> 02:15:10.186]  And for all the best reasons.
[02:15:10.186 --> 02:15:16.168]  Enerfood is nature's 100% all-natural organic superfood with no GMOs, fillers, or sweeteners.
[02:15:16.168 --> 02:15:20.749]  Just 20 power-packed ingredients that will sharpen your mind and give you the energy you need.
[02:15:20.749 --> 02:15:22.889]  You get everything you need for less than a dollar a day.
[02:15:22.889 --> 02:15:26.230]  Go to www.enerfood.com.
[02:15:26.230 --> 02:15:30.371]  That's www.enerfood.com or go to www.infowars.com and click on the banner.
[02:15:30.971 --> 02:15:34.093]  The number is 1-866-762-9238.
[02:15:34.093 --> 02:15:39.675]  That's 1-866-762-9238.
[02:15:39.675 --> 02:15:43.157]  And our other huge sponsor, our largest sponsor, is of course eFoodsDirect.
[02:15:43.157 --> 02:15:47.459]  And I talked earlier about how they are rationing food in some stores in New York.
[02:15:47.459 --> 02:15:48.539]  This is a serious matter.
[02:15:48.539 --> 02:15:52.261]  You can only get three bags of rice over at Sam's Club and over at BJ's.
[02:15:52.261 --> 02:15:53.081]  This is tragic.
[02:15:53.081 --> 02:15:57.083]  I can't believe I live in a country now where I can't get everything I need for purchase.
[02:15:57.083 --> 02:15:57.804]  Rationing food.
[02:15:57.804 --> 02:15:58.344]  Think about that.
[02:15:58.724 --> 02:15:59.284]  It's really scary.
[02:15:59.284 --> 02:16:00.304]  So go to eFoodsDirect.
[02:16:00.304 --> 02:16:03.265]  The only sure thing about the future is that there is no sure thing.
[02:16:03.265 --> 02:16:06.886]  Storing food for your family is one of the most prudent actions you can take.
[02:16:06.886 --> 02:16:10.967]  No one knows what can or will affect the functioning of society or food distribution.
[02:16:10.967 --> 02:16:13.287]  With StorFood, you eliminate that worry.
[02:16:13.287 --> 02:16:18.689]  Our biggest sponsor, eFoodsDirect, is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the United States.
[02:16:18.689 --> 02:16:20.949]  There are no expert... experts, guys.
[02:16:20.949 --> 02:16:23.310]  Be prepared and give eFoodsDirect a call at 1-800-409-4209.
[02:16:25.691 --> 02:16:29.294]  5633 or click on the huge banner over at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:16:29.294 --> 02:16:34.938]  That's the number 1-800-409-5633 eFoodsDirect.
[02:16:34.938 --> 02:16:37.360]  Alright, we got some time in this segment to take some callers.
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:40.543]  Remember, Daniel Estillan will be on at half past the hour.
[02:16:40.543 --> 02:16:51.792]  We're going to talk about these Bilderberg developments, the fact they put out a press release, the fact that the attendee list is there, what he thinks is now on the agenda with that attendee list leaking all the latest stories over at InfoWars.com.
[02:16:53.654 --> 02:16:57.096]  Let's jump to John in Missouri.
[02:16:57.096 --> 02:17:00.739]  Let's go to Chris in Florida.
[02:17:00.739 --> 02:17:02.220]  Chris, you with me?
[02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:05.001]  Yes, give me two seconds.
[02:17:05.001 --> 02:17:06.322]  Okay, are you with me?
[02:17:06.322 --> 02:17:07.683]  Yes.
[02:17:07.683 --> 02:17:08.404]  Okay, good job.
[02:17:08.404 --> 02:17:12.566]  I just want to let you know that you're getting better.
[02:17:12.566 --> 02:17:17.049]  I want to make sure that you know that you're getting better.
[02:17:17.049 --> 02:17:20.071]  And I want to make sure that somebody lets you know that.
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:32.667]  But I wanted to, on a lighter note, let you know that these talk show hosts do have Freudian flips, you could say.
[02:17:32.667 --> 02:17:43.033]  O'Reilly had on his show a little while ago, a couple weeks ago, I saw him, where he was mentioning that Dio on YouTube has surfaced, where he was
[02:17:43.686 --> 02:17:45.286]  Very angry 20 years ago.
[02:17:45.286 --> 02:17:47.327]  I watched it on Inside Edition.
[02:17:47.327 --> 02:17:48.987]  He was swearing and all that.
[02:17:48.987 --> 02:17:53.328]  And he said he would show it on his show, but he can't due to Count Dracula.
[02:17:53.328 --> 02:17:57.129]  I mean, due to contractual agreements.
[02:17:57.129 --> 02:17:58.349]  It's just kind of flipped up.
[02:17:58.349 --> 02:18:13.313]  I want to let you know, you know, that this, um... Well, what you're referring to is this, uh... It's so easily discredited, and I want to encourage people to call talk shows more often because there are so many of us and such few of them, and it's so easy to get through them.
[02:18:13.994 --> 02:18:20.818]  On these talk shows that we can easily discredit these propagandists and bring them to justice more quickly.
[02:18:20.818 --> 02:18:23.120]  Well, that is the Mark Dice model, and I totally agree.
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:32.805]  I want to also bring your attention to something that I think is very widely ignored, and that's that in the L.A.
[02:18:32.805 --> 02:18:40.190]  Times about two or three weeks ago, if you want to look at Babylon and beyond, I don't know if you've seen that Major General Kevin Berger
[02:18:40.694 --> 02:18:51.260]  I have reported that out of 20,000 pieces of ammunition and ordnance and that kind of thing, nothing had been identified as coming from Iran.
[02:18:51.260 --> 02:18:52.821]  Have you seen that?
[02:18:52.821 --> 02:18:55.183]  No, I haven't, but you know, they're trying to set up Iran.
[02:18:55.183 --> 02:18:58.465]  There's no doubt about it in my mind, although Estalán may disagree.
[02:18:58.465 --> 02:18:59.145]  We've got to let you go.
[02:18:59.145 --> 02:19:02.827]  Your phone connection is just awful, and it's clicking in and out.
[02:19:02.827 --> 02:19:03.548]  That's all right.
[02:19:03.548 --> 02:19:05.609]  Let's jump to another phone call.
[02:19:05.609 --> 02:19:08.291]  Let's go to Joe in Edmonton.
[02:19:08.291 --> 02:19:08.751]  Joe, are you with me?
[02:19:09.963 --> 02:19:11.304]  Hi, uh, am I on the air?
[02:19:11.304 --> 02:19:12.585]  Yes, you are.
[02:19:12.585 --> 02:19:14.086]  Okay, uh, hi, uh, Jason.
[02:19:14.086 --> 02:19:15.227]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:19:15.227 --> 02:19:15.368]  Sure.
[02:19:15.368 --> 02:19:16.749]  Two things here.
[02:19:16.749 --> 02:19:27.077]  Um, I got, uh, one of these, uh, criminal scumbag elite coming to my city, uh, coming, uh, to, um, the Shaw Conference Center here at Edmonton, uh, come Friday, June the 20th.
[02:19:27.077 --> 02:19:29.219]  He's gonna speak for about an hour and a half.
[02:19:29.219 --> 02:19:30.020]  Well, hold on.
[02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:31.021]  Let's, let's wait to the other side.
[02:19:31.021 --> 02:19:32.682]  You let us know who this criminal is.
[02:19:32.682 --> 02:19:36.926]  It's the Alex Jones Show live, Bilderberg, 2008 coverage, InfoWars.com.
[02:19:48.968 --> 02:19:52.791]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[02:19:52.791 --> 02:19:56.933]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[02:19:56.933 --> 02:20:03.738]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[02:20:03.738 --> 02:20:06.620]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:16.422]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[02:20:16.422 --> 02:20:21.084]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[02:20:21.084 --> 02:20:24.184]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[02:20:24.184 --> 02:20:30.306]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers and more.
[02:20:30.646 --> 02:20:37.034]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with OxySilver.

[02:21:48.772 --> 02:21:50.733]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:21:50.733 --> 02:21:54.355]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:21:54.355 --> 02:21:56.817]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:21:56.817 --> 02:21:59.838]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:21:59.838 --> 02:22:05.582]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:22:05.582 --> 02:22:09.484]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:22:09.824 --> 02:22:15.026]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[02:24:05.260 --> 02:24:07.921]  This is the top of the line coverage.
[02:24:07.921 --> 02:24:09.342]  The coverage you're gonna get nowhere else.
[02:24:09.342 --> 02:24:12.603]  This is where we tell you who's there, why they're there.
[02:24:12.603 --> 02:24:16.946]  We have live reports from there, which nobody else has.
[02:24:16.946 --> 02:24:30.412]  And if you go to wearechange.org right now, you'll see Rob Jacobson, one of the great employees over here at Infowars.com, responsible for a lot of the editing of Alex Jones' great films, including 9-11 Truth Rising, the 9-11 Chronicles, coming up.
[02:24:30.951 --> 02:24:32.992]  I think we're going to be releasing that on the net on July 4th.
[02:24:32.992 --> 02:24:34.053]  It's very exciting.
[02:24:34.053 --> 02:24:36.515]  The DVD is being mastered as we speak.
[02:24:36.515 --> 02:24:42.739]  And Rob is just a great person, a great patriot, and we hope to hear from Alex Jones at the bottom of the hour.
[02:24:42.739 --> 02:24:44.480]  Hopefully we'll have Estalon in the next segment.
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:45.741]  We'll see what happens.
[02:24:45.741 --> 02:24:51.625]  But right now we're talking to Joe at Edmonton, and he's talking about telling people to confront some of these scums.
[02:24:51.625 --> 02:24:53.907]  So who's coming to your town?
[02:24:53.907 --> 02:24:55.968]  Okay.
[02:24:55.968 --> 02:24:59.751]  Hang on to the seat of your pants here, Jason, because this
[02:25:00.359 --> 02:25:14.911]  This piece of garbage, this pathetic piece of dog vomit, the kindest words that I can find for this clown, William Jefferson Clinton, 42nd President of your United States, coming here to Edmonton.
[02:25:14.911 --> 02:25:23.838]  He's going to be speaking here in Edmonton, Alberta, at the Shaw Conference Center, two weeks from today, on the 20th of June, from 12 o'clock noon to 1.30.
[02:25:23.838 --> 02:25:25.859]  Then he travels 200 miles south to Calgary.
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:31.305]  To speak in Calgary.
[02:25:31.305 --> 02:25:35.898]  I don't know where about what venue in Calgary, but likely...
[02:25:38.566 --> 02:25:41.248]  Well, the bottom line is we need some truth squads out there.
[02:25:41.248 --> 02:25:42.609]  We need some tough questions asked.
[02:25:42.609 --> 02:25:47.493]  He was just confronted on Bilderberg yet again, and he was asked, why isn't the media at Bilderberg?
[02:25:47.493 --> 02:25:50.655]  And he just, I don't know, I haven't been there in 15 years.
[02:25:50.655 --> 02:25:54.058]  I suspect he's been there sooner than 15 years ago.
[02:25:54.058 --> 02:25:55.339]  Denial, denial, denial.
[02:25:55.339 --> 02:25:59.262]  You know, that's how a lot of these big political celebrities talk.
[02:25:59.262 --> 02:26:00.523]  I'll tell you right now, his wife
[02:26:00.743 --> 02:26:02.684]  Probably met with Bilderbergers last night.
[02:26:02.684 --> 02:26:13.551]  There's no way it's a coincidence that her and Obama get together for their first meeting after she says that she's out of the race in DC on the night the Bilderberg conference starts, okay?
[02:26:13.551 --> 02:26:14.531]  Give me a break.
[02:26:14.531 --> 02:26:17.653]  That's like lightning striking five times in the same place.
[02:26:17.653 --> 02:26:22.116]  Also too, Jason, can I just weigh in with one more quick comment, then I'll go here?
[02:26:22.116 --> 02:26:23.297]  Sure.
[02:26:23.297 --> 02:26:26.899]  Right here up in my neck of the woods, here in Alberta, we have been
[02:26:27.734 --> 02:26:28.515]  I think so.
[02:26:46.866 --> 02:26:49.610]  What can I... I don't know really where to start, you know?
[02:26:49.610 --> 02:26:53.175]  Well, let me tell you what you can do, man.
[02:26:53.175 --> 02:26:55.998]  You gotta just get information that you know you want to share with people.
[02:26:55.998 --> 02:26:57.360]  People don't read much anymore.
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:01.406]  Unless you sit them down and you put them in front of a television, they're God, okay?
[02:27:01.866 --> 02:27:03.488]  They're not going to buy into it.
[02:27:03.488 --> 02:27:05.710]  And that's why you need to get copies of these movies.
[02:27:05.710 --> 02:27:07.591]  You know, you can download them for free if you can't afford them.
[02:27:07.591 --> 02:27:08.973]  We encourage you to make copies.
[02:27:08.973 --> 02:27:09.974]  But you've got to make it fun.
[02:27:09.974 --> 02:27:11.895]  You've got to say, oh, let's have a dinner party.
[02:27:11.895 --> 02:27:17.080]  Invite five of your friends and maybe sit them down and just say, oh, you know, let's throw this in and see what happens.
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:18.581]  Maybe play some cards while you're watching it.
[02:27:18.581 --> 02:27:20.423]  You're going to catch someone's interest.
[02:27:20.423 --> 02:27:22.685]  You know, you've got to bring it in in a positive light.
[02:27:22.685 --> 02:27:24.787]  And, you know, I know it's not the easiest thing in the world.
[02:27:24.787 --> 02:27:25.468]  I've been doing it now.
[02:27:26.122 --> 02:27:44.577]  for six years and it's tough waking people up but slowly but surely I've gotten a lot of people to come around my friends my family the people most important to me complete strangers I mean we need to share this information we need this info war to get into the next year I thank you for the call Joe let's go to Leaf in New York City.
[02:27:44.577 --> 02:27:46.358]  Leaf, are you with us?
[02:27:46.358 --> 02:27:48.300]  Hey Jason, how are you doing?
[02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:49.561]  Good man, how are you?
[02:27:49.561 --> 02:27:50.221]  I'm good.
[02:27:50.221 --> 02:27:53.324]  Before you mentioned something about the new world religion
[02:27:54.045 --> 02:27:54.405]  Sure.
[02:27:54.405 --> 02:27:58.267]  I just wanted to give you a heads up as to what exactly that was.
[02:27:58.267 --> 02:28:04.009]  I work in downtown New York and about a block from where I work is an organization called Lucius Trust.
[02:28:04.009 --> 02:28:05.030]  You may have heard of them.
[02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.950]  Of course.
[02:28:05.950 --> 02:28:09.952]  They were started as the Lucifer Trust in the 1920s by Alasdair Bailey.
[02:28:09.952 --> 02:28:13.373]  I actually went there because I saw their name so many times.
[02:28:13.373 --> 02:28:14.534]  It's a really weird place.
[02:28:14.534 --> 02:28:18.255]  The place does not look like it belongs on Wall Street where it is.
[02:28:18.255 --> 02:28:21.657]  It used to be the Lucifer Trust, by the way, for those that don't know.
[02:28:23.166 --> 02:28:45.755]  And I got a bunch of pamphlets from there, and a lot of the titles are things like, The New Group of World Servers, The New World Religion, The Reappearance of Christ, things on meditating together with two other people to create these things called triangles, and the thing that really set me off about them was they recently had their conference in New York, and they have three major festivals every year.
[02:28:45.755 --> 02:28:48.876]  One's in New York, one's in London, and one's in Geneva.
[02:28:49.406 --> 02:28:54.792]  What kind of religious organization meets in the financial capitals of the world?
[02:28:54.792 --> 02:29:00.078]  I mean, it's just ridiculous, and it's a really strange place, and they are occultists.
[02:29:00.078 --> 02:29:02.741]  It's an occult esoteric mystery school.
[02:29:03.325 --> 02:29:08.048]  They straight up say that they're not, they are in fact part of the United Nations.
[02:29:08.048 --> 02:29:10.930]  They have United Nations stuff all over the inside of their office.
[02:29:10.930 --> 02:29:13.692]  They're totally one-worlders, man, and you're dead on, man.
[02:29:13.692 --> 02:29:14.632]  They're pagans.
[02:29:14.632 --> 02:29:16.374]  They're into this Luciferian religion.
[02:29:16.374 --> 02:29:18.535]  It's do as thou wilt, and they're trying to usher it in.
[02:29:18.535 --> 02:29:20.196]  They're trying to break down society.
[02:29:20.196 --> 02:29:22.017]  I thank you for the call, Leif.
[02:29:22.017 --> 02:29:23.698]  Hopefully we'll have Escalon on the other side.
[02:29:23.698 --> 02:29:25.700]  If we don't, we'll be taking more calls.
[02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:27.661]  Alex will be calling in at the bottom of the hour, and remember,
[02:29:28.502 --> 02:29:32.664]  We got hot-ass Amy Allen, MTV's Amy Allen, coming in for the final hour.
[02:29:32.664 --> 02:29:34.465]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:34.465 --> 02:29:39.088]  I'm Jason Burmess, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:29:39.088 --> 02:29:40.489]  We're on the march.
[02:29:40.489 --> 02:29:43.010]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:43.010 --> 02:29:45.711]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:48.902 --> 02:29:52.004]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:29:52.004 --> 02:29:57.527]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:29:57.527 --> 02:30:03.230]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:04.711]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:04.711 --> 02:30:13.736]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:30:14.036 --> 02:30:15.878]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[02:30:15.878 --> 02:30:20.083]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[02:30:49.164 --> 02:30:50.585]  It is a big idea.
[02:30:50.585 --> 02:30:53.386]  A new world order.
[02:30:53.386 --> 02:30:54.327]  In the near future.
[02:30:55.211 --> 02:30:58.275]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:30:58.275 --> 02:31:01.118]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:31:01.118 --> 02:31:03.901]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[02:31:03.901 --> 02:31:07.085]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:31:07.085 --> 02:31:14.413]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:31:17.426 --> 02:31:22.870]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:26.272]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:31:47.388 --> 02:31:47.534]  Yeah.

[02:32:54.961 --> 02:32:55.401]  To Big John!
[02:32:55.401 --> 02:32:56.562]  You know what I need out there?
[02:32:56.562 --> 02:32:59.324]  I need a Big John, a Big Adam, a Big Tom, a Big Alice, a Big Betty.
[02:33:18.789 --> 02:33:20.132]  To start becoming the media.
[02:33:20.132 --> 02:33:22.156]  To start standing up for what they believe in.
[02:33:22.156 --> 02:33:23.018]  To go to Bilderberg.
[02:33:23.018 --> 02:33:24.742]  We got a few of those people over there.
[02:33:24.742 --> 02:33:26.987]  We got some big Philly time over there.
[02:33:26.987 --> 02:33:27.748]  By the way, Philly 9-11 truth is, uh...
[02:33:29.542 --> 02:33:32.644]  One of the best 9-11 truth organizations locally that I know of.
[02:33:32.644 --> 02:33:34.886]  They just keep pumping out the hits.
[02:33:34.886 --> 02:33:38.508]  And if you want to make a difference, truthaction.org, wearechange.org.
[02:33:38.508 --> 02:33:42.971]  In fact, let's go to the live We Are Change feed.
[02:33:42.971 --> 02:33:43.111]  Ah!
[02:33:43.111 --> 02:33:46.393]  As soon as I'm going to hit the button, it's not broadcast.
[02:33:46.393 --> 02:33:51.417]  I mean, literally, my finger's on the button, and they cut the broadcast.
[02:33:51.417 --> 02:33:52.177]  Unbelievable.
[02:33:52.177 --> 02:33:54.419]  Well, it's live radio, folks, so you just gotta...
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:55.981]  You move along to get along.
[02:33:55.981 --> 02:34:04.246]  Remember, coming up in a half an hour, we did confirm we are going to have Amy Allen, so that means I'm going to play a little Ron Paul revolution song for you.
[02:34:04.246 --> 02:34:06.928]  It's top-notch, kids, and I hope you enjoy.
[02:34:06.928 --> 02:34:09.410]  Let's go to Leon in Texas.
[02:34:09.410 --> 02:34:11.091]  Leon, you're on the air live.
[02:34:11.091 --> 02:34:11.591]  Howdy!
[02:34:11.591 --> 02:34:23.840]  I was listening to you guys talking about the collapse of the Twin Towers yesterday, and I think there's a clue that you have overlooked.
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:24.460]  All right, let's hear it.
[02:34:26.161 --> 02:34:38.429]  Well, before these things fell down, there was a bunch of New York Police Department helicopters circling them.
[02:34:38.429 --> 02:34:42.391]  Sure, and they'd give off that little flash right before the tower goes down, right?
[02:34:42.391 --> 02:34:52.237]  And they were trying to assess the possibility of evacuating people, and they decided that it was impractical.
[02:34:52.237 --> 02:34:55.099]  But in the meantime, they took videotapes
[02:34:56.463 --> 02:35:03.290]  of the floors where the airliner struck.
[02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:06.313]  Okay.
[02:35:06.313 --> 02:35:12.599]  And these videotapes are pretty striking.
[02:35:12.599 --> 02:35:17.243]  Are we talking about the videotapes of the woman in the impact zone waving and that sort of thing?
[02:35:17.243 --> 02:35:17.804]  No, no.
[02:35:17.804 --> 02:35:19.005]  She was on a different floor.
[02:35:21.363 --> 02:35:30.327]  But, you know, what we're talking about is that they're looking straight, you know, they got their video cam pointed straight into the impact floor.
[02:35:30.327 --> 02:35:33.949]  And it's white hot in there.
[02:35:33.949 --> 02:35:36.991]  I mean, it's not like diesel fuel hot.
[02:35:36.991 --> 02:35:40.132]  It's white hot.
[02:35:40.132 --> 02:35:41.513]  Where is this video?
[02:35:41.513 --> 02:35:42.794]  I've never seen it.
[02:35:42.794 --> 02:35:45.895]  Well, you know, I've seen stills from it.
[02:35:45.895 --> 02:35:47.096]  Well, where can I find this stuff?
[02:35:47.096 --> 02:35:48.737]  Because I've never seen any of this stuff.
[02:35:48.737 --> 02:35:49.457]  White hot, huh?
[02:35:50.638 --> 02:35:52.960]  I mean, again, I've seen just about everything.
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:59.285]  I've gone through every live news feed from that day until 9-13 that's available from ABC to CBS.
[02:35:59.285 --> 02:36:03.948]  It's still from one of the major, you know, one of the major books on 9-11, I think.
[02:36:03.948 --> 02:36:12.175]  Well, I would say send it out to erininfowars.com or get at me at jasonatlewisjones911.com and I'll check it out.
[02:36:12.175 --> 02:36:13.256]  Wait a minute.
[02:36:13.256 --> 02:36:16.338]  Now, you might think this would prove that there was
[02:36:19.195 --> 02:36:25.840]  Yeah, you know that there was a thermite or something like that on that floor.
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:27.041]  But I don't think it does.
[02:36:27.932 --> 02:36:30.915]  Well, again, I can't really comment, because I haven't seen the pictures.
[02:36:30.915 --> 02:36:33.857]  Obviously, you think the official version is what happened.
[02:36:33.857 --> 02:36:46.648]  When we see the squibs going 20 and 40, 60 floors below the impact, we have molten metal that is unexplainable, and we have people inside that impact hole two minutes before the towers actually collapse, and that's confirmed by the NYFD.
[02:36:46.648 --> 02:36:49.450]  They say they can knock it down with two handlers.
[02:36:49.450 --> 02:36:54.695]  The body of the plane itself is 110 tons of aluminum, and if that burns,
[02:36:55.532 --> 02:37:00.016]  Yeah, you know, it's like burning 300 tons of coal on one floor.
[02:37:00.016 --> 02:37:02.058]  Well, once again, I mean, they're in the impact hole.
[02:37:02.058 --> 02:37:03.139]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:37:03.139 --> 02:37:04.300]  They're in the impact hole.
[02:37:04.300 --> 02:37:04.881]  They're up there.
[02:37:04.881 --> 02:37:11.047]  They're in the, I think it was like the 72nd, 73rd floor, and they say they can knock the fires out with two hand lines.
[02:37:11.047 --> 02:37:14.510]  You can't survive in white-hot heat if you're a human being.
[02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:16.372]  Those people weren't talking from there.
[02:37:16.372 --> 02:37:16.752]  Yes, they were.
[02:37:16.752 --> 02:37:19.415]  They were talking from the middle lobby.
[02:37:19.415 --> 02:37:19.695]  Sorry.
[02:37:20.123 --> 02:37:21.024]  Sorry, you're wrong.
[02:37:21.024 --> 02:37:22.185]  They're on that floor.
[02:37:22.185 --> 02:37:23.547]  It's in loose chain second edition.
[02:37:23.547 --> 02:37:24.347]  It's confirmed.
[02:37:24.347 --> 02:37:25.388]  Go check it out for yourself.
[02:37:25.388 --> 02:37:28.311]  I'm gonna let you go because you've got a lot of misinformation, man.
[02:37:28.311 --> 02:37:29.493]  They're in the impact zone.
[02:37:29.493 --> 02:37:31.214]  They're not in the lobby.
[02:37:31.214 --> 02:37:32.035]  Come on.
[02:37:32.035 --> 02:37:32.596]  The lobby!
[02:37:34.875 --> 02:37:37.956]  You can knock out little fires with a little hemline.
[02:37:37.956 --> 02:37:40.697]  Well, yeah, well, because it was a little fire there in the impact zone.
[02:37:40.697 --> 02:37:43.239]  It's not a little fire where the fire actually hit.
[02:37:43.239 --> 02:37:46.600]  All right, Leon, hey, I gave you your little soapbox.
[02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:47.881]  You know, send me the pictures.
[02:37:47.881 --> 02:37:48.941]  I'll take a look at it.
[02:37:48.941 --> 02:37:49.922]  I think it's nonsense.
[02:37:49.922 --> 02:37:51.462]  Again, these people are in the impact zone.
[02:37:51.462 --> 02:37:53.943]  Let's jump to Mark in Georgia.
[02:37:53.943 --> 02:37:55.144]  Mark, are you with us?
[02:37:55.144 --> 02:37:56.205]  Yes, I am.
[02:37:56.205 --> 02:37:57.305]  God bless you, sir.
[02:37:57.305 --> 02:37:58.886]  Thank you.
[02:37:58.886 --> 02:37:59.306]  Let's see.
[02:37:59.306 --> 02:38:01.507]  First, for those that, you know,
[02:38:02.652 --> 02:38:12.818]  I appreciate Alex's view that we don't want to get into a bunch of religious dogmatism, like I like to say, if you love me as your brother in Christ, please show me where I'm wrong, because we're all wrong about something.
[02:38:12.818 --> 02:38:15.800]  Do you love Jesus dot org letter U?
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:31.489]  I read this book about a year ago called The Synagogue of Satan, and people, I've dealt with people who, you know, it's like, I think you're a sycophant, and if you thought I was paying him a compliment as a no, you don't understand, you're not engaging your brain, is what I'm saying, huh?
[02:38:32.017 --> 02:38:50.243]  That's what sycophant means, is a person who accepts things at face value without checking them out, and that, you know, it's like, the thing is, this book just spells out the lineage of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, that they're Ashkenazi, and he explains, you know, in Judaism, you got to have a proper, legitimate, matriarchal lineage.
[02:38:50.243 --> 02:38:59.507]  These people don't have a legitimate, you know, a person can proselytize into the faith, and their descendants are considered to be full-fledged Jews.
[02:38:59.507 --> 02:39:00.407]  But the thing is that,
[02:39:01.451 --> 02:39:13.314]  Basically, I try to point people out that there's a site called JewsNotZionist that fully concur that basically Zionism and Judaism are exactly opposite in so many respects.
[02:39:13.314 --> 02:39:24.616]  Judaism says you treat your fellow man, whether he's a believer in the Jewish faith or not, with the same fairness and justice regardless.
[02:39:24.616 --> 02:39:30.898]  And Zionism is basically militant hegemony and basically oppression
[02:39:31.691 --> 02:39:49.221]  Well, let me speak to that just for one second, because a lot of people, you know, obviously, they try to associate the Patriot movement, the 9-11 Truth movement, with anti-Semitism, and any time that you bring up Israel as a bad guy, in which many cases they are, they automatically say Jew.
[02:39:49.221 --> 02:39:56.024]  Well, number one, in the United States, you don't refer to everybody as a Christian, even though that is the dominant religion.
[02:39:56.024 --> 02:40:00.767]  Just because you live in Israel does not mean you are a Jew, and just because you're born
[02:40:01.383 --> 02:40:26.091]  of a uh... of a middle eastern descent that happens to be quote-unquote jewish doesn't mean you follow that religion so i think that that's a just a terrible term i think when you're when you're criticizing the israeli government of the massad you need to say that by name i think that it if there is a total difference between what zionism is which was you know the creation and prolonging of israel and all this agenda in the middle east from judaism you know i i mean exactly and
[02:40:26.602 --> 02:40:33.544]  And, uh, you know, I go to- when I went to college, uh, you know, half of the students were, you know, Jewish descent, you know, had a bar mitzvah, the whole thing.
[02:40:33.544 --> 02:40:36.804]  These people aren't part of some kind of plot to take over the world.
[02:40:36.804 --> 02:40:38.465]  They're not inherently evil.
[02:40:38.465 --> 02:40:44.206]  You know, they're people like you and me, and they're following, you know, the religion that their parents put upon them.
[02:40:44.206 --> 02:40:45.566]  And I- I hate the confusion.
[02:40:45.566 --> 02:40:47.147]  I hate all of the- I agree.
[02:40:47.147 --> 02:40:48.847]  The- the anti-Jew stuff.
[02:40:48.847 --> 02:40:50.267]  It's- it's garbage.
[02:40:50.267 --> 02:40:52.508]  And- Yeah, because- yeah, it's- it's one of those things where
[02:40:53.343 --> 02:41:06.986]  And the thing I try to be clear is, like, when people hear this mistaken idea that in Islam and the Muslim world they refer to America as the Great Satan, it's like, no, they're not even referring to the government as the Great Satan.
[02:41:06.986 --> 02:41:15.608]  They're referring not merely to the political figures that are up at the top of the apparent pyramid, they're referring actually more to the people behind the scenes
[02:41:16.368 --> 02:41:28.155]  You know, it's like... Well, there's that great Revelations quotation, right before they go over the Mark of the Beast, that our leaders will pose as Christians and actually be into the occult, and it's all in the same paragraph.
[02:41:28.155 --> 02:41:29.515]  It's unbelievable to me.
[02:41:29.515 --> 02:41:30.836]  I thank you for the call, Mark.
[02:41:30.836 --> 02:41:34.538]  I'm going to try to jump over to the Bilderberg Group.
[02:41:34.538 --> 02:41:38.080]  Matt Lepacek is doing a little bullhorning, so let's hit the button and hopefully it works.
[02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:38.480]  Let's go!
[02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:44.283]  ...goes inside the building and denies that this conference even exists!
[02:41:44.283 --> 02:41:45.224]  How do they do that?
[02:41:45.859 --> 02:41:47.480]  Why do they do that?
[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:49.760]  And who are they working for?
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:51.141]  They're not working for your family!
[02:41:51.141 --> 02:41:53.421]  They're not working for my family!
[02:41:53.421 --> 02:41:56.402]  They're not working for the United States of America!
[02:41:56.402 --> 02:42:00.723]  Or any of the notions on which this country was founded on!
[02:42:00.723 --> 02:42:03.524]  They're working towards a world order!
[02:42:03.524 --> 02:42:05.205]  A centralization of power!
[02:42:05.205 --> 02:42:08.926]  Today this country stands in threat of a merger!
[02:42:09.810 --> 02:42:10.870]  And there you have it.
[02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:12.231]  Live from Bilderberg.
[02:42:12.231 --> 02:42:16.851]  Remember, you can get that video feed over at wearechange.org.
[02:42:16.851 --> 02:42:20.132]  We're probably going to be playing some of that.
[02:42:39.281 --> 02:42:42.603]  Well, before I get to my point, I just am just a little suspicious.
[02:42:42.603 --> 02:42:45.385]  I am suspicious that I just don't think it's a coincidence that little hottie Amy Allen
[02:43:02.133 --> 02:43:02.413]  Uh-huh.
[02:43:02.413 --> 02:43:07.718]  Was scheduled when you were sub-hosting, Jason.
[02:43:07.718 --> 02:43:09.339]  I'll admit, I did luck out.
[02:43:09.339 --> 02:43:11.721]  I really lucked out.
[02:43:11.721 --> 02:43:13.503]  I think that was your plan.
[02:43:13.503 --> 02:43:17.046]  Hey, I don't book the guests, but I'll take them when I get them.
[02:43:17.046 --> 02:43:19.508]  She looks a lot better than Willie Nelson.
[02:43:19.508 --> 02:43:21.990]  I would have to agree with you there.
[02:43:21.990 --> 02:43:30.437]  But I think one thing that we have to get rid of, if you ever have a chance of getting the whole system clean,
[02:43:31.192 --> 02:43:35.276]  Is, um, all these perks that the government workers get.
[02:43:35.276 --> 02:43:39.679]  The thing is, to me, it's not that... Oh, did we just lose her?
[02:43:39.679 --> 02:43:44.644]  Oh, that's unfortunate, because she had a lot of, she seemed like she had a lot of good things to say, but I have to agree with her.
[02:43:44.644 --> 02:43:58.756]  A lot of people are drawn into, uh, the, uh, the government sector because of the benefits, because they're not going to have to worry about their dental, their health, their family's health, and that became, makes them good little servants.
[02:43:59.392 --> 02:44:01.573]  You know, they don't want to question the status quo.
[02:44:01.573 --> 02:44:08.914]  They don't want to have to go to the private sector, where they're going to probably have to take a decrease in pay, and a decrease in benefits, and struggle a little more.
[02:44:08.914 --> 02:44:11.395]  They're willing to take on that fascism.
[02:44:11.395 --> 02:44:20.697]  So, I got some more callers, but before we go to the callers, let's do it, because we got Alex coming up in the bottom of the hour, and then Amy probably doesn't want to hear her own song again.
[02:44:20.697 --> 02:44:25.438]  But here it is, the video, the unofficial video for Ron Paul Revolution.
[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:42.344]  We don't want no war no more.
[02:45:08.129 --> 02:45:09.410]  We're good to go.
[02:45:38.309 --> 02:45:40.670]  We're not gonna give up the fight.
[02:45:40.670 --> 02:45:42.090]  Rock on!
[02:45:42.090 --> 02:45:47.812]  Start a revolution and break down illegal institutions.
[02:45:47.812 --> 02:45:49.732]  Booyah!
[02:45:49.732 --> 02:45:51.653]  Booyah!
[02:45:51.653 --> 02:45:58.795]  Patriot Act took our liberties and there's no judge, no jury.
[02:45:58.795 --> 02:45:59.215]  Booyah!
[02:45:59.215 --> 02:46:06.437]  Dropping off the phones, breaking down our doors, waging all the people a civil war.
[02:46:06.437 --> 02:46:07.157]  Booyah!
[02:46:07.657 --> 02:46:10.619]  We're not gonna give up the fight.
[02:46:10.619 --> 02:46:12.541]  Start a revolution!
[02:46:37.745 --> 02:46:41.327]  We haven't followed the Constitution, and that's what we ought to be doing.
[02:46:41.327 --> 02:46:45.628]  The system that we have today is ripping off the middle class and the poor.
[02:46:45.628 --> 02:46:53.052]  Can you imagine how great a nation we'd have if we didn't have the Federal Reserve System printing all this money?
[02:46:53.052 --> 02:46:54.512]  Rock-Po!
[02:46:54.512 --> 02:46:56.853]  Save our constitutional rights!
[02:46:56.853 --> 02:46:58.314]  Rock-Po!
[02:46:58.314 --> 02:47:02.175]  When they're gonna give up the fight?
[02:47:02.175 --> 02:47:03.116]  Rock-Po!
[02:47:03.116 --> 02:47:03.676]  Start a revolution!
[02:47:16.256 --> 02:47:18.832]  Star Revolution!
[02:47:57.090 --> 02:47:57.891]  Awesome video.
[02:47:57.891 --> 02:48:02.735]  I cannot wait to have Amy Allen on the program in about 15 minutes.
[02:48:02.735 --> 02:48:04.116]  Just killer.
[02:48:04.116 --> 02:48:08.760]  You know, she got the Suicide Girls in there, for those who know what that is, another group of hot chicks.
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:11.042]  Just another way to reach the masses.
[02:48:11.042 --> 02:48:12.663]  You know, I played a Flo-Bot song.
[02:48:12.663 --> 02:48:15.105]  Because this is about bringing the youth into this.
[02:48:15.105 --> 02:48:18.047]  We're the only ones that have really stepped up hardcore.
[02:48:18.047 --> 02:48:18.968]  Let's be honest about it.
[02:48:19.854 --> 02:48:23.316]  I see my film, you know, loose change on college campuses.
[02:48:23.316 --> 02:48:27.519]  I talk at high schools and colleges more than any other place.
[02:48:27.519 --> 02:48:30.481]  And I've even talked to a couple middle schools folks.
[02:48:30.481 --> 02:48:33.722]  You know, the young people know what's going on.
[02:48:33.722 --> 02:48:35.323]  You know, that's where it's big.
[02:48:35.323 --> 02:48:42.127]  And we need to motivate them to get involved in government, to learn what the three branches are again, to look for checks and balances.
[02:48:42.127 --> 02:48:44.709]  Alright, let's take another caller before we end this segment.
[02:48:44.709 --> 02:48:46.010]  Let's go to Chris in Florida.
[02:48:46.010 --> 02:48:46.550]  Chris, are you with me?
[02:48:47.403 --> 02:48:48.084]  Yes, I am.
[02:48:48.084 --> 02:48:48.704]  What's up, Jason?
[02:48:48.704 --> 02:48:49.365]  How are you doing?
[02:48:49.365 --> 02:48:49.705]  Good, man.
[02:48:49.705 --> 02:48:50.666]  How are you doing?
[02:48:50.666 --> 02:48:51.326]  Good, good.
[02:48:51.326 --> 02:48:52.087]  You're doing a great job.
[02:48:52.087 --> 02:48:52.347]  Oh, thank you.
[02:48:52.347 --> 02:48:53.689]  This is a real exciting time.
[02:48:53.689 --> 02:48:55.830]  A real exciting time.
[02:48:55.830 --> 02:49:02.356]  I think you're absolutely right about the youth getting involved, and we are stepping up, and I feel real excited about all this.
[02:49:02.356 --> 02:49:12.505]  I've always wanted to ask, when I saw loose change debates, popular mechanics, if you could give a little bit of a behind-the-scenes, what went on there?
[02:49:12.836 --> 02:49:13.096]  Sure.
[02:49:13.096 --> 02:49:14.957]  With the guy that was right next to you sitting next to you.
[02:49:14.957 --> 02:49:15.338]  James Meggs.
[02:49:15.338 --> 02:49:17.179]  He seemed real nervous.
[02:49:17.179 --> 02:49:20.601]  Well, I'll tell you what, Jimmy Meggs, in fact, there's a little video up there.
[02:49:20.601 --> 02:49:26.405]  I don't want to say it's the, actually it's the 9-11 2006 video, I'm pretty sure.
[02:49:26.405 --> 02:49:29.987]  Dylan posted it, you can see some Louder Than Words videos on the run up to that.
[02:49:29.987 --> 02:49:32.489]  But we were in the thing and they asked us to stop filming them.
[02:49:32.489 --> 02:49:34.290]  It was him and David Dunbar.
[02:49:34.290 --> 02:49:41.094]  And I approached them prior to the thing, I gave them my card, I said, you know, I'd love to interview you guys for the final cut, you know, a representative of Popular Mechanics.
[02:49:41.094 --> 02:49:42.335]  So they took my card, blah, blah, blah.
[02:49:43.308 --> 02:49:51.694]  Now, in between commercial breaks, after the first segment, when I'd actually gotten to talk, you know, the first segment, like, this guy was blown away.
[02:49:51.694 --> 02:49:54.156]  He's looking at me, he can't believe what I'm saying to him.
[02:49:54.156 --> 02:50:04.243]  And then by the second segment, he actually turned to me and he said, you know, I was not prepared for you guys to be as well-spoken and prepared for this thing.
[02:50:04.243 --> 02:50:06.044]  He's like, I'm quite surprised.
[02:50:06.044 --> 02:50:09.846]  And I'm like, you know, I'm sitting here trying to save the country, man, and you know you're lying.
[02:50:09.846 --> 02:50:11.948]  I mean, you obviously saw the animosity on my face.
[02:50:12.700 --> 02:50:13.580]  You jumped.
[02:50:13.580 --> 02:50:17.602]  Oh man, you know, and I wish I was just a little bit more calm.
[02:50:17.602 --> 02:50:19.383]  I think I came across better on the radio.
[02:50:19.383 --> 02:50:20.923]  Oh, you came across great, bro.
[02:50:20.923 --> 02:50:24.425]  Well, thanks, man, than I did on television, because I did get a little aggravated.
[02:50:24.425 --> 02:50:28.887]  But man, you know, these are the guys that are propagating for our government.
[02:50:28.887 --> 02:50:32.788]  And until we get the truth about 9-11, bro, we're never going to have change in this country.
[02:50:32.788 --> 02:50:34.189]  I thank you so much for the call, Chris.

[02:54:32.065 --> 02:54:47.209]  I'm watching the live video feed right now and they got a big banner that says only evil is done in secret and Luke Rudowsky, Aaron Dykes, Alex Jones and about 20 plus other people are down there and Alex is on the line with an update.
[02:54:47.209 --> 02:54:47.789]  Alex Jones.
[02:54:48.621 --> 02:54:50.143]  Hey guys, yeah, pull up.
[02:54:50.143 --> 02:54:53.468]  Go down there and park in that area right before it.
[02:54:53.468 --> 02:54:56.792]  There's like a office building right before down there, about 200 yards.
[02:54:56.792 --> 02:54:58.194]  Park there, okay?
[02:54:58.194 --> 02:54:59.376]  Okay, see ya.
[02:54:59.376 --> 02:55:01.118]  More people arriving, but I'm assuming live.
[02:55:01.118 --> 02:55:02.260]  Yes, we are live, sir.
[02:55:02.867 --> 02:55:11.017]  Well, listen, I'll be back on coast-to-coast AM tonight with a quick 10-minute report, 5-10-minute report, and I'll do live reports in probably on George Butler, Saturday night on Genesis.
[02:55:11.017 --> 02:55:15.863]  And I just really appreciate the five-star job you've done while I've been out of town.
[02:55:15.863 --> 02:55:19.987]  And let's just go ahead and end the Bilderberg coverage live here with some boring.
[02:55:19.987 --> 02:55:21.529]  What, we got about three minutes left, Burmese?
[02:55:21.529 --> 02:55:21.970]  You got it.
[02:55:22.981 --> 02:55:30.905]  Now, I've told everybody here, they've got incredible telephoto pictures of all these world leaders, but everybody's been so busy and so tired at night, they haven't been uploading them.
[02:55:30.905 --> 02:55:33.827]  So everybody who has photos, videos, get them up.
[02:55:33.827 --> 02:55:34.768]  Get them on YouTube.
[02:55:34.768 --> 02:55:35.528]  Get them on Flickr.
[02:55:35.528 --> 02:55:36.929]  Get them on MySpace.
[02:55:36.929 --> 02:55:40.931]  Get them out to everybody now, so that this information has its full effect.
[02:55:40.931 --> 02:55:44.533]  Everybody, this is the three or four days when people all over the world will pay attention.

[02:55:52.057 --> 02:55:53.278]  We need massive reportage.
[02:55:53.278 --> 02:55:55.198]  It's been totally insane.
[02:55:55.198 --> 02:55:57.860]  We've got to get all this material out right now.
[02:55:57.860 --> 02:56:00.881]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to take the show out here with the bullhorning.
[02:56:00.881 --> 02:56:01.321]  Here we go.
[02:56:01.321 --> 02:56:02.422]  Just hold that up.
[02:56:02.422 --> 02:56:08.184]  All right.
[02:56:08.184 --> 02:56:10.345]  You New World Order trash!
[02:56:10.345 --> 02:56:14.908]  You think I like having to risk my life to come here and confront you?
[02:56:14.908 --> 02:56:20.090]  You think I like having to put up with all your criminal spooks trying to set us up?
[02:56:20.990 --> 02:56:24.692]  You think I don't know you got thousands of killers working for you?
[02:56:24.692 --> 02:56:27.173]  I know you're murdering scum!
[02:56:27.173 --> 02:56:28.773]  That's why I hate you even more!
[02:56:28.773 --> 02:56:33.515]  For all the crimes and things that you do to humanity!
[02:56:33.515 --> 02:56:42.019]  And then I've got to put my name, my blood, my oath, my treasure, 110% against you!
[02:56:42.019 --> 02:56:44.780]  I feel like you've robbed a lot of my life!
[02:56:44.780 --> 02:56:49.382]  When I committed myself 13 years ago to fight the New World Order!
[02:56:49.382 --> 02:56:49.762]  Back off!
[02:56:50.683 --> 02:56:51.964]  Quit pushing!
[02:56:51.964 --> 02:56:54.766]  Turn your police state off!
[02:56:54.766 --> 02:56:56.547]  Stop poisoning the water!
[02:56:56.547 --> 02:56:58.088]  Stop poisoning the air!
[02:56:58.088 --> 02:57:04.092]  Stop carrying out eugenics operations against the people of this planet!
[02:57:04.092 --> 02:57:13.578]  You keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and humanity knows you're the enemy of freedom, and they can't be pushed anymore!
[02:57:16.906 --> 02:57:25.272]  All over the place, mainstream news that you thought you owned and controlled is reporting how you put cancer viruses in the vaccines, HIV in the smallpox shots.
[02:57:25.272 --> 02:57:27.174]  It's all over the news now.
[02:57:27.174 --> 02:57:28.975]  You can't stop it.
[02:57:28.975 --> 02:57:30.676]  You can't shut down the internet either.
[02:57:30.676 --> 02:57:35.880]  The people already have a taste of free information, real information, alternative information.
[02:57:35.880 --> 02:57:38.962]  They want to make up their own minds.
[02:57:38.962 --> 02:57:41.784]  Your mainstream media is falling apart!
[02:57:41.784 --> 02:57:45.087]  The alternative media is exploding!
[02:57:46.306 --> 02:57:48.647]  And you are destined to be defeated!
[02:57:48.647 --> 02:57:55.150]  You are destined for your new world order to go down in a big way!
[02:57:55.150 --> 02:57:58.251]  We have had it with your new world order!
[02:57:58.251 --> 02:58:02.473]  We've had it with your criminal activities and your shadow government!
[02:58:02.473 --> 02:58:04.774]  And we want you to leave us and our families alone!
[02:58:04.774 --> 02:58:08.415]  And stop murdering people!
[02:58:08.415 --> 02:58:11.296]  There it is folks, Alex Jones live from Bilderberg.
[02:58:13.487 --> 02:58:15.108]  We'll be back after these messages.
[02:58:15.108 --> 02:58:16.309]  It is the Alex Jones Show.

[02:58:17.529 --> 02:58:18.730]  Or, I'm sorry, Amy Allen.
[02:58:18.730 --> 02:58:19.990]  Why'd I call her Lee?
[02:58:19.990 --> 02:58:21.471]  Smokin' hot, Amy Allen, by the way.

[02:58:52.186 --> 02:58:56.009]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:58:56.349 --> 02:59:03.232]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[02:59:32.808 --> 02:59:38.132]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[03:00:00.646 --> 03:00:07.580]  All right folks, it is the fourth hour in this historic broadcast live from Bilderberg Group 2008.
[03:00:07.580 --> 03:00:09.705]  Alex Jones has just done an amazing job.
[03:00:09.705 --> 03:00:11.208]  We just left you with some bullhorning.
[03:00:11.778 --> 03:00:14.621]  But we have an amazing guest with us right now.
[03:00:14.621 --> 03:00:16.143]  She has an incredible voice.
[03:00:16.143 --> 03:00:19.627]  She's been on MTV with her song Revolution.
[03:00:19.627 --> 03:00:22.791]  I guess they kind of nixed her album though, which kind of sucks.
[03:00:22.791 --> 03:00:26.555]  And of course she has the unofficial Ron Paul one that we just played.
[03:00:26.555 --> 03:00:28.838]  She's smoking hot too, guys.
[03:00:28.838 --> 03:00:29.979]  It is Amy Allen.
[03:00:29.979 --> 03:00:31.521]  Thank you for joining us, Amy.
[03:00:31.521 --> 03:00:32.402]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:00:33.101 --> 03:00:35.964]  Great, and I just gotta tell you, I love your message.
[03:00:35.964 --> 03:00:42.390]  I became aware of you about, I don't know, two or three weeks ago, when someone posted your video on my MySpace page.
[03:00:42.390 --> 03:00:43.431]  And I mean, you talk about a lot.
[03:00:43.431 --> 03:00:46.174]  I mean, you talk about the Bilderberg Group and that song.
[03:00:46.174 --> 03:00:49.917]  I do talk about the Bilderberg Group, and nobody else seems to be talking about it.
[03:00:49.917 --> 03:00:52.340]  I mean, Alex Jones does, which, you know, is awesome.
[03:00:52.340 --> 03:00:53.561]  I'm a huge fan.
[03:00:53.561 --> 03:00:54.142]  Oh, excellent.
[03:00:54.142 --> 03:00:56.544]  Well, did you just hear Alex bullhorning at Bilderberg?
[03:00:57.524 --> 03:00:58.466]  No way!
[03:01:16.189 --> 03:01:17.890]  And it's a paragraph long.
[03:01:17.890 --> 03:01:19.191]  We read it earlier.
[03:01:19.191 --> 03:01:22.112]  And of course, they're meeting in secret for our good, Amy.
[03:01:22.112 --> 03:01:24.393]  It's not the plan to do anything bad.
[03:01:24.393 --> 03:01:26.775]  And they say, well, there's not going to be a press conference.
[03:01:26.775 --> 03:01:31.397]  And the only reason that they're meeting in secret is so they can talk openly and honestly.
[03:01:31.397 --> 03:01:38.481]  Now, why can't they talk openly and honestly about policy that's going to be passed in this country in front of the American people?
[03:01:40.433 --> 03:01:44.654]  Yeah, and why is it just so... I mean, this is amazing that they're doing a press release.
[03:01:44.654 --> 03:01:49.376]  What, just a few days ago, Hillary had no idea what anyone was talking about?
[03:01:49.376 --> 03:01:50.196]  Exactly.
[03:01:50.196 --> 03:01:50.916]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:01:50.916 --> 03:01:52.857]  Hillary doesn't know what Bilderberg is.
[03:01:52.857 --> 03:01:54.938]  She's been confronted on it a couple of times.
[03:01:54.938 --> 03:01:56.518]  Her husband has admitted to going.
[03:01:56.518 --> 03:02:01.259]  They even released the list this year, and let me name off some of the people that have been confirmed.
[03:02:01.259 --> 03:02:03.060]  Of course, Ben Bernanke, a federal
[03:02:03.727 --> 03:02:12.875]  Uh, Reserve Chairman is there, then we have David Rockefeller like we always do, Paul Wolfowitz, Condi Rice is there officially, uh, Tom Daschle.
[03:02:12.875 --> 03:02:14.117]  It's just nauseating.
[03:02:14.117 --> 03:02:23.465]  It really is nauseating that people that are even supposed to be on the quote-unquote other side of the spectrum like Daschle, uh, former Senate House Majority Leader for the Democrats, is there.
[03:02:23.465 --> 03:02:29.971]  You know, it just proves again and again and again that these two collude behind closed doors, they're gonna have this big meeting,
[03:02:30.511 --> 03:02:32.694]  Of 125 to 140 people.
[03:02:32.694 --> 03:02:33.956]  We're gonna pay for their iPods.
[03:02:33.956 --> 03:02:35.578]  I don't know if you saw that story.
[03:02:35.578 --> 03:02:36.559]  Yeah, I did.
[03:02:36.559 --> 03:02:38.121]  Yeah, we're gonna pay for their iPods.
[03:02:38.121 --> 03:02:39.843]  I just want to know what music they're listening to.
[03:02:39.843 --> 03:02:41.185]  I mean, is it just the player?
[03:02:41.185 --> 03:02:42.306]  Hopefully it's your music.
[03:02:42.306 --> 03:02:43.788]  Or like, what are they listening to?
[03:02:44.841 --> 03:02:47.102]  It's probably pretty satanic, hardcore.
[03:02:47.102 --> 03:03:09.132]  Anyway, so they're gonna have this meeting, and this weekend with these people now, in a month, they're gonna get together at the Bohemian Grove, where there's 3,000 of these people, and then they're gonna dispense their agenda throughout those 3,000 people, through compartmentalization, and then they're gonna dispense it to their minions and so on, with only a partial part of the picture being known to each of these people.
[03:03:09.132 --> 03:03:12.994]  And, again, they're deciding what's gonna happen in our country for the next 12 months.
[03:03:14.014 --> 03:03:14.934]  And it's tragic to me.
[03:03:14.934 --> 03:03:17.915]  It's tragic to me that more people don't know.
[03:03:17.915 --> 03:03:19.655]  And that's exactly why I wrote this song.
[03:03:19.655 --> 03:03:24.737]  It's because I, you know, in talking to people, they just don't know.
[03:03:24.737 --> 03:03:26.497]  They just don't know about Bilderberg.
[03:03:26.497 --> 03:03:37.020]  They don't know about the global elites and the fact that they want to take our sovereignty and our constitutional rights and they literally have the agenda of the North American Union.
[03:03:37.020 --> 03:03:38.780]  People don't know at all.
[03:03:38.780 --> 03:03:42.161]  And it's just like, it's so frustrating and it's also
[03:03:42.765 --> 03:03:48.827]  It's devastating to watch our country just sort of being brought to its knees systematically.
[03:03:48.827 --> 03:03:50.147]  Yeah, through incrementalization.
[03:03:50.147 --> 03:03:51.847]  So what woke Amy Allen up?
[03:03:51.847 --> 03:03:54.748]  What was it that... Have you been doing this for years?
[03:03:54.748 --> 03:03:55.848]  Have you always looked into this?
[03:03:55.848 --> 03:03:59.689]  Was there a certain film or book or television show?
[03:03:59.689 --> 03:04:08.792]  No, I've always, even going way back to high school, I actually spoke on C-SPAN.
[03:04:08.792 --> 03:04:09.012]  Really?
[03:04:09.600 --> 03:04:13.001]  Hold that thought, because we have to go to break.
[03:04:13.001 --> 03:04:14.821]  We have Amy Allen, start a revolution.
[03:04:14.821 --> 03:04:16.722]  We'll be back after this.
[03:04:16.722 --> 03:04:17.062]  Infowars.com.
[03:04:45.677 --> 03:04:47.657]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:04:47.657 --> 03:04:51.258]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:04:51.258 --> 03:04:53.718]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:04:53.718 --> 03:04:56.759]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:04:56.759 --> 03:05:02.500]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:05:02.500 --> 03:05:06.401]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[03:05:06.741 --> 03:05:11.926]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[03:05:45.587 --> 03:05:51.428]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[03:05:51.428 --> 03:05:56.509]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[03:05:56.849 --> 03:06:02.213]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[03:06:02.213 --> 03:06:08.138]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[03:06:08.138 --> 03:06:14.363]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[03:06:14.363 --> 03:06:17.866]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[03:06:18.126 --> 03:06:22.947]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[03:06:22.947 --> 03:06:24.008]  Do your part.
[03:06:24.008 --> 03:06:26.628]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[03:06:26.628 --> 03:06:35.831]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[03:06:45.322 --> 03:06:48.845]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:06:48.845 --> 03:06:54.250]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:06:54.250 --> 03:06:59.415]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:06:59.415 --> 03:07:10.545]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:07:10.925 --> 03:07:16.708]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[03:07:16.708 --> 03:07:22.972]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:07:22.972 --> 03:07:24.012]  What about you?
[03:07:24.012 --> 03:07:26.014]  Order your KDF shower filter normally.

[03:07:51.397 --> 03:07:53.198]  All right, folks, we are back.
[03:08:09.895 --> 03:08:15.196]  At the Command Center in Austin, Texas, I am Jason Burmess, subbing in for Alex Jones at the moment.
[03:08:15.196 --> 03:08:26.740]  I want to remind everybody to go to InfoWars.com and pick up some of the videos, make copies, hand them out, get Terror Storm, get Martial Law, get my film, Loose Change 2nd Edition or Loose Change Final Cut.
[03:08:26.740 --> 03:08:29.580]  Make copies, hand them out, we need to wake up the masses.
[03:08:29.580 --> 03:08:35.202]  And we were talking about your time with Elektra Records and what set you off there, Amy?
[03:08:35.202 --> 03:08:35.622]  Well, um...
[03:08:36.613 --> 03:08:46.121]  What happened was, being on a major label, they really threatened me with not talking about politics.
[03:08:46.121 --> 03:08:49.204]  And they basically said, we're not going to release the record if you continue.
[03:08:49.204 --> 03:08:51.526]  And this is, I'd start a revolution if I could get up in the morning.
[03:08:51.526 --> 03:08:52.127]  Right.
[03:08:52.127 --> 03:09:02.596]  And what happened was, because I had the word revolution in my title of my song, there's a lot of people that would go on my message boards and talk about revolution.
[03:09:02.596 --> 03:09:03.156]  And right after 9-11,
[03:09:04.420 --> 03:09:10.045]  The CIA called my record company and said, you have to take her message board down.
[03:09:10.045 --> 03:09:19.793]  She has to either stop talking about what's going on or, um, using the word revolution, um, or, um, or else.
[03:09:19.793 --> 03:09:21.254]  I mean, I don't even know what the threat was.
[03:09:21.254 --> 03:09:22.856]  Total censorship.
[03:09:22.856 --> 03:09:23.156]  Huh?
[03:09:23.156 --> 03:09:24.057]  Total censorship.
[03:09:24.057 --> 03:09:24.877]  Total censorship.
[03:09:24.877 --> 03:09:28.280]  So I got a call from my, my label saying, you have to stop being political.
[03:09:28.280 --> 03:09:30.922]  We got a call from the CIA and I was just like blown away.
[03:09:30.922 --> 03:09:32.023]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:09:32.023 --> 03:09:32.804]  I was like, really?
[03:09:33.962 --> 03:09:50.952]  You know, and so that really, so as soon as my record label folded, um, you know, I thought that, you know, doing the Ron Paul song was just such a release for me because I, you know, I could finally, like, say what I wanted to say without, you know, uh... So they, what, effectively censored you for almost five years?
[03:09:50.952 --> 03:09:54.394]  Oh, well, yeah, well, they wouldn't, they would not let me sign with another label.
[03:09:54.394 --> 03:09:56.015]  They held me, you know, hostage.
[03:09:56.596 --> 03:10:07.725]  You're obviously very, very talented, and that's probably why they don't want this type of message to get out to the masses, and it's through song and pop culture that we really are able to wake up the most amount of people.
[03:10:07.725 --> 03:10:08.186]  Exactly.
[03:10:08.186 --> 03:10:18.414]  And I'm so happy that, you know, the videos had the response that it's had, that, you know, we just basically, you know, we just had to do it.
[03:10:18.414 --> 03:10:22.738]  You know, when we watched Lucien, who is the producer of the song,
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:33.062]  We're really good friends, and we just sat there and watched Freedom from Freedom to Fascism together, and we watched Parts of Zeitgeist, and we were just like, you know, what are we gonna do?
[03:10:33.062 --> 03:10:40.424]  And we were sitting there in our house, and we just looked at each other like, gosh, I wish there was just something we could do.
[03:10:40.424 --> 03:10:41.924]  And there was silence.
[03:10:41.924 --> 03:10:44.564]  And then we just looked at each other and just laughed, and we're like, let's do it.
[03:10:44.564 --> 03:10:45.525]  Let's do it right now.
[03:10:45.525 --> 03:10:46.965]  Let's just write a song right now.
[03:10:47.768 --> 03:10:50.048]  Because there's just no, there was no other choice.
[03:10:50.048 --> 03:10:52.089]  It's like we had to say something.
[03:10:52.089 --> 03:10:56.450]  So everybody in that video pretty much worked for pro bono, and it's an awesome video by the way.
[03:10:56.450 --> 03:10:56.970]  Oh, thank you.
[03:10:56.970 --> 03:11:05.591]  Yeah, what we realized is that, you know, I live in West Hollywood, big gay community, and a lot of my friends are gay.
[03:11:05.591 --> 03:11:07.471]  Almost all my friends are gay, guys.
[03:11:07.471 --> 03:11:14.933]  And if you're watching the mainstream media, you know, they'll tell you that, you know, that the gay community is for Hillary Clinton.
[03:11:14.933 --> 03:11:16.933]  And that just wasn't the case.
[03:11:17.970 --> 03:11:29.157]  And that's just not the case, because there's a huge gay community for Ron Paul, because they understand, you know, they want freedom just as much as, you know, the next person.
[03:11:29.157 --> 03:11:36.681]  And they knew they could get married and there'd be so many more rights, because government would stay out of religion, which is what marriage is, religious family.
[03:11:36.681 --> 03:11:39.343]  Absolutely, less government intrusion in their lives.
[03:11:39.343 --> 03:11:45.206]  Exactly, and so pretty much everyone who worked on the video was just super into Ron Paul, and they're like, let's do it, let's go.
[03:11:46.371 --> 03:11:56.293]  Cinematographers and lighting, we got free everything because everyone wanted to help get the message out and it's just so refreshing and just an awesome, awesome display.
[03:11:56.293 --> 03:12:00.734]  And then you're also friends with the Suicide Girls because they make a little bit of an appearance too, right?
[03:12:00.734 --> 03:12:10.756]  Well, I host, I'm not a Suicide Girl, but I host a show on Indie 103.1 called Suicide Girls Radio.
[03:12:10.756 --> 03:12:13.577]  And so I get a chance to say, you know, a lot of my
[03:12:14.833 --> 03:12:15.634]  I don't know.
[03:12:32.555 --> 03:12:34.517]  No, I'm kidding.
[03:12:34.517 --> 03:12:38.039]  I wanted to have the Suicide Girls on there because they're like punk rock.
[03:12:38.039 --> 03:12:40.361]  Hey, a little sex appeal never hurts, right?
[03:12:40.361 --> 03:12:45.785]  Sex appeal gets people's attention, you know, because people are a little dumbed down these days.
[03:12:45.785 --> 03:12:52.690]  If I show a couple of cute girls in bikinis, maybe they'll listen to my message about the Bilderberg Group.
[03:12:52.690 --> 03:12:57.313]  But yeah, they're punk rock, and the owner of the Suicide Girls
[03:12:58.864 --> 03:13:00.425]  Yeah, no, I'm absolutely with you.
[03:13:00.425 --> 03:13:05.909]  In fact, I just got down to Austin, Texas a little less than two months ago for the very first time, and I'm from New York.
[03:13:28.103 --> 03:13:37.194]  And although there was a big, you know, Ron Paul movement in my community in New York, I never expected to come down here and just see Ron Paul on all these cars.
[03:13:37.194 --> 03:13:41.300]  I saw young people wearing Ron Paul t-shirts with ties on.
[03:13:41.300 --> 03:13:47.127]  I mean, I was just shocked that that many people, especially younger people, you know, like UT kids,
[03:13:47.657 --> 03:13:59.904]  I knew that Ron Paul was the only candidate that was going to offer freedom, the only candidate that was going to get us out of Iraq and Iran, the only candidate that was going to limit government, and the only candidate that's not a globalist.
[03:13:59.904 --> 03:14:08.830]  Yeah, with the CFR agenda and, you know, the war on drugs has just been a huge issue for me for many years.
[03:14:08.830 --> 03:14:12.052]  I just think it's so ridiculous.
[03:14:12.052 --> 03:14:12.672]  No, I'm with you there.
[03:14:12.672 --> 03:14:13.933]  Have you seen American Drug War yet?
[03:14:15.101 --> 03:14:17.523]  Yeah, you gotta see American Drug War.
[03:14:17.523 --> 03:14:21.705]  It's done by Kevin Booth who used to manage comedian Bill Hicks.
[03:14:21.705 --> 03:14:26.508]  But it's got Tommy Chong, we had him on the program a couple times in the last few weeks.
[03:14:26.508 --> 03:14:31.091]  And it's also got Selly Castillo who helped run the drugs for this government into this country.
[03:14:31.691 --> 03:14:33.672]  They got Jack Arpaio.
[03:14:33.672 --> 03:14:34.972]  They also have Barry McCafferty.
[03:14:34.972 --> 03:14:47.177]  It's just a very well documentary that really peels back the layers on how we ship in the drugs, and then we prosecute the users, and we have them work for slave labor wages in our privatized prisons.
[03:14:47.177 --> 03:14:48.938]  Exactly.
[03:14:48.938 --> 03:14:49.758]  I couldn't put it better.
[03:14:49.758 --> 03:14:50.639]  Thank you.
[03:14:50.639 --> 03:14:51.539]  Exactly.
[03:14:51.539 --> 03:14:53.040]  First of all, I love Bill Hicks.
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:54.780]  I just have to say that.
[03:14:54.780 --> 03:14:56.461]  American Drug War, we'll definitely check that out.
[03:14:56.903 --> 03:14:57.824]  Definitely have to.
[03:14:57.824 --> 03:14:58.564]  It's an excellent movie.
[03:14:58.564 --> 03:14:59.345]  It's got a great cover.
[03:14:59.345 --> 03:15:02.988]  We actually carry it over at InfoWars.com for the listeners.
[03:15:02.988 --> 03:15:06.731]  And I think that it might even be posted over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:15:06.731 --> 03:15:07.392]  Go check it out.
[03:15:07.392 --> 03:15:08.893]  So what's the future for Amy Allen?
[03:15:08.893 --> 03:15:10.134]  Are you going to put out a new album?
[03:15:10.134 --> 03:15:11.895]  Are you going to sign with a new record label?
[03:15:11.895 --> 03:15:14.057]  I mean, I'm sure... No.
[03:15:14.057 --> 03:15:18.901]  I am definitely not going to be a slave to any record company.
[03:15:18.901 --> 03:15:23.765]  I'm starting my own company and just releasing my music on my own.
[03:15:23.765 --> 03:15:25.066]  That's just the best way to do it.
[03:15:26.044 --> 03:15:30.667]  We, um, I released an independent, um, album called Scott and Amy.
[03:15:30.667 --> 03:15:35.490]  And it just won best punk song of the year, a song I wrote called Miss America.
[03:15:35.490 --> 03:15:42.695]  And, um, and, uh, just, uh, we finished that and, um, now I'm just doing solo, solo work.
[03:15:42.695 --> 03:15:46.037]  Um, just my own material, gonna release it myself.
[03:15:46.037 --> 03:15:49.659]  Not gonna have any label tell me what I can say, what I can't say.
[03:15:49.659 --> 03:15:52.301]  And, um, it's a big, it's a big relief, you know?
[03:15:52.594 --> 03:15:57.238]  No, that's amazing, and it is through art and song that we're going to reach the masses.
[03:15:57.238 --> 03:15:59.080]  It's Scott and Amy, and people can download that.
[03:15:59.080 --> 03:16:00.100]  They can go get a heart.
[03:16:00.100 --> 03:16:02.162]  How do they get that out?
[03:16:02.162 --> 03:16:05.705]  Well, Amy, for the listeners, is called A-I-M-E-E.
[03:16:05.705 --> 03:16:11.790]  And Scott and Amy, you can get that on iTunes.
[03:16:11.790 --> 03:16:17.375]  And Amy Allen's MySpace, you can get the Ron Paul song for free.
[03:16:17.375 --> 03:16:18.256]  So I'm just giving it away.
[03:16:18.256 --> 03:16:20.057]  I just want the message to get out there.
[03:16:20.057 --> 03:16:20.858]  They can buy it.
[03:16:21.326 --> 03:16:23.207]  Or they can get it for free, like whatever they want.
[03:16:23.207 --> 03:16:28.609]  Yeah, well I hope people do support you because, what is it, Sidetracked Records is your new company?
[03:16:28.609 --> 03:16:42.294]  No, Sidetracked Records is independent, just like a small company that we formed for Scott and Amy, but that's just for that particular record, but my particular record label is just...
[03:16:47.050 --> 03:16:54.555]  Well, I hope you come up with a good name, because it's great music, it's a great message, and, you know, actually California is one of the more active places.
[03:16:54.555 --> 03:17:00.278]  You know, I spent a little time out in Hollywood myself, and I went out to the big Hollywood protest last summer.
[03:17:00.278 --> 03:17:09.724]  There's a lot of awake minds out there, maybe a little left-leaning, I guess, but as we expose them more as globalists, I mean, even in your song you're talking about the Verichip,
[03:17:10.180 --> 03:17:10.781]  I don't know.
[03:17:22.006 --> 03:17:22.046]  Uh...
[03:17:52.518 --> 03:17:54.559]  You know, I wish I was making this stuff up.
[03:17:54.559 --> 03:17:55.440]  I know.
[03:17:55.440 --> 03:17:55.880]  I'm not.
[03:17:55.880 --> 03:17:56.561]  Unbelievable.
[03:17:56.561 --> 03:18:05.847]  Yeah, no, this is one of the debunkers and even he was really disturbed by it and about half the people that normally attack us and would have gone after us just kind of stopped posting altogether.
[03:18:06.317 --> 03:18:06.477]  I don't
[03:18:23.166 --> 03:18:23.446]  Seriously.
[03:18:23.446 --> 03:18:26.568]  I mean, there's certain jobs that you can't even get unless you get chipped.
[03:18:50.851 --> 03:18:52.512]  I mean, where does it end?
[03:18:52.512 --> 03:19:01.775]  And the thing that really just killed me is that when you bring it up to people, they just write it off as insane.
[03:19:01.775 --> 03:19:03.775]  It's like, no, go look for yourself.
[03:19:03.775 --> 03:19:05.096]  Go do the research.
[03:19:05.096 --> 03:19:09.117]  Go find out for yourself what I'm talking about.
[03:19:09.117 --> 03:19:16.920]  And then, you know, the response is always like, you know, if I'm at a party or hanging out, people are like, you know, the rules are you don't talk about politics and you don't talk about religion.
[03:19:17.836 --> 03:19:18.517]  Alright, fine.
[03:19:18.517 --> 03:19:21.381]  Can we just throw those rules out the window for, like, five seconds?
[03:19:21.381 --> 03:19:24.426]  Because right now, our country is being taken from us.
[03:19:24.426 --> 03:19:26.308]  Yeah, those rules need to go.
[03:19:26.308 --> 03:19:29.292]  I hear that all the time, and you need to reach out when you can.
[03:19:29.292 --> 03:19:31.355]  We're gonna be back after this with Amy Allen.
[03:19:31.355 --> 03:19:33.719]  It is the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[03:19:48.681 --> 03:19:52.066]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[03:19:52.066 --> 03:19:56.912]  They get closer and closer and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[03:19:56.912 --> 03:19:59.396]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?
[03:19:59.396 --> 03:20:03.461]  Tebowtech specializes in non-lethal self-defense products for you and your family.

[03:20:47.748 --> 03:20:49.190]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:20:49.190 --> 03:20:55.236]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[03:20:55.236 --> 03:20:56.057]  That's right.
[03:20:56.057 --> 03:20:58.660]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[03:20:58.660 --> 03:21:05.828]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[03:21:06.388 --> 03:21:14.514]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:21:14.514 --> 03:21:19.998]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[03:21:19.998 --> 03:21:25.822]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:25.822 --> 03:21:30.325]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[03:21:30.325 --> 03:21:30.605]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:30.605 --> 03:21:32.427]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[03:21:35.669 --> 03:21:38.151]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:38.151 --> 03:21:40.713]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:40.713 --> 03:21:47.719]  It is a big idea.
[03:21:47.719 --> 03:21:50.541]  A new world order.
[03:21:50.541 --> 03:21:55.425]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:21:55.425 --> 03:21:58.248]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:21:58.248 --> 03:22:00.430]  Put their objective being world domination.
[03:22:01.035 --> 03:22:04.198]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[03:22:04.198 --> 03:22:11.526]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:22:14.554 --> 03:22:19.998]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:22:19.998 --> 03:22:23.380]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:22:44.514 --> 03:22:45.755]  Yeah.
[03:22:45.755 --> 03:22:49.557]  Cardivite is probably the most misunderstood supplement today.
[03:22:49.557 --> 03:22:56.042]  Cardivite is packed full of vitamins at cell level to help your whole body function like it used to.
[03:22:56.042 --> 03:23:02.826]  Today's diet is lacking in the trace minerals and nutrients our body needs to maintain our good health.
[03:23:02.826 --> 03:23:08.550]  Get the toxins and heavy metals out and allow your body to do the job God intended.
[03:23:09.210 --> 03:23:13.892]  Made for the heart, carbide helps in so many other ways.
[03:23:13.892 --> 03:23:19.935]  So order your 4-month special of either the capsules or tincture for just $125 plus shipping and handling.
[03:23:19.935 --> 03:23:20.975]  Call 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:23:20.975 --> 03:23:22.636]  That's H-E-A-R-T-D-R-O-P dot com.
[03:23:34.341 --> 03:23:35.262]  That toll-free number?
[03:23:35.262 --> 03:23:35.342]  1-877-928-8822.
[03:23:35.342 --> 03:23:36.444]  Cartevite.
[03:23:36.444 --> 03:23:37.886]  Circulation for life!
[03:24:01.630 --> 03:24:06.031]  Alright folks, we're back at the Alex Jones Show and I'm watching a live feed from Bilderberg right now.
[03:24:06.031 --> 03:24:07.832]  They have the entire place taped off.
[03:24:07.832 --> 03:24:09.473]  They have no trespassing signs.
[03:24:09.473 --> 03:24:11.453]  They have private property signs.
[03:24:11.453 --> 03:24:13.714]  Alex just got done with another bullhorning session.
[03:24:13.714 --> 03:24:17.095]  Hopefully he'll be joining us in the final hour with a call-in.
[03:24:17.575 --> 03:24:21.198]  We're going to be taking your calls in about 10-15 minutes, hopefully, on topic.
[03:24:21.198 --> 03:24:26.381]  But right now we're talking to Amy Allen, who had her album suppressed by the CIA, folks.
[03:24:26.381 --> 03:24:29.123]  Believe it or not, the CIA said, no dice.
[03:24:29.123 --> 03:24:31.465]  We can't let you put this album out.
[03:24:31.465 --> 03:24:34.987]  God forbid people think for themselves, Amy.
[03:24:34.987 --> 03:24:38.930]  Well, the CIA, they just said that they didn't want me talking about revolution.
[03:24:38.930 --> 03:24:42.453]  They didn't want me talking about politics after 9-11.
[03:24:42.453 --> 03:24:43.814]  And which I just thought was astounding.
[03:24:43.814 --> 03:24:47.036]  But the record label folded right after that, so I don't think
[03:24:48.064 --> 03:24:50.166]  Well, it was definitely from CIA pressure.
[03:24:50.166 --> 03:24:53.328]  Yeah, the whole label went down, you know?
[03:24:53.328 --> 03:24:55.850]  I just thought it was karma.
[03:24:55.850 --> 03:24:57.031]  That is karma, you're right.
[03:24:57.031 --> 03:25:02.255]  You know, you bow down to these globalist masters of yours and it's not going to be good for you.
[03:25:02.255 --> 03:25:11.162]  That's why, you know, when people, like you said, you know, you're at a party and everybody's like, oh man, just shut up, just have a beer, play some beer pong, this and that.
[03:25:11.162 --> 03:25:17.066]  It's like, listen, we're not going to be able to do this for much longer if you don't wake up immediately.
[03:25:17.066 --> 03:25:17.126]  Yep.
[03:25:18.027 --> 03:25:20.888]  And figure out that you need to be a part of the local government.
[03:25:20.888 --> 03:25:22.228]  You need to be your own media.
[03:25:22.228 --> 03:25:23.609]  You need to put this information out.
[03:25:23.609 --> 03:25:25.129]  You need to tell your family.
[03:25:25.129 --> 03:25:29.031]  Because they've been able to destroy this economy in the last, you know, seven years.
[03:25:29.031 --> 03:25:31.091]  The dollar has gone way down.
[03:25:31.091 --> 03:25:32.492]  We're below Canadian currency.
[03:25:32.492 --> 03:25:35.393]  It's absolutely unbelievable.
[03:25:35.393 --> 03:25:37.434]  They've blown up the price of gas.
[03:25:37.434 --> 03:25:40.695]  And now, I can't believe it, but they're literally rationing food in New York.
[03:25:40.695 --> 03:25:44.136]  You can only buy three bags of rice over at BJ's and Sam's Club.
[03:25:44.136 --> 03:25:47.517]  You know, I thought I lived in a free country where I could buy as much as I needed.
[03:25:48.760 --> 03:25:49.640]  Unbelievable.
[03:25:49.640 --> 03:25:52.041]  Yeah, what happened to the free market economy we were all promised?
[03:25:52.041 --> 03:25:53.382]  It's anything but.
[03:25:53.382 --> 03:25:58.303]  I mean, the apathy is really, I mean, the biggest disease of all.
[03:25:58.303 --> 03:26:06.906]  I mean, it's just like, people just, the, I mean, it's really unbelievable that people just don't care.
[03:26:06.906 --> 03:26:08.707]  They're like, Barack Obama, you know?
[03:26:08.707 --> 03:26:10.347]  Just, sure, real change, you know?
[03:26:10.347 --> 03:26:13.668]  Change, it's like, you really know what you're voting for.
[03:26:13.668 --> 03:26:15.829]  Like, he voted for the Patriot Act.
[03:26:16.723 --> 03:26:18.443]  He's voting to take away our freedoms.
[03:26:18.443 --> 03:26:21.544]  Like, why are you getting behind this guy's CFR?
[03:26:21.544 --> 03:26:26.065]  Like, you know, it's just people... He's a slick talker.
[03:26:26.065 --> 03:26:33.727]  He's a slick talker and this consumerist culture of mall rats, uh, you know, I think he's gonna save him because he has a slogan called, Change We Can Vote For.
[03:26:33.727 --> 03:26:37.168]  Amy, I'm gonna, I'm gonna play some of Alex live bullhorning right now.
[03:26:37.168 --> 03:26:39.108]  He's bullhorning one of the members.
[03:26:39.108 --> 03:26:39.848]  Hold on one second.
[03:26:43.610 --> 03:26:50.556]  Ultramaster vehicle.
[03:26:50.556 --> 03:26:57.882]  Well listen, when your mom and dad die prematurely of cancer, and what half your family has, because that's their plan, we have their documents, just remember that I didn't tell you.
[03:26:57.882 --> 03:26:59.023]  I don't know, it's funny.
[03:26:59.023 --> 03:27:00.524]  But it won't be funny.
[03:27:00.524 --> 03:27:06.269]  People born, who are born in 2000 and after, won't live as long as their parents.
[03:27:06.269 --> 03:27:07.270]  Because of these people.
[03:27:07.270 --> 03:27:09.312]  We have all the documents on it.
[03:27:09.312 --> 03:27:10.573]  Heard about AIDS being engineered?
[03:27:10.573 --> 03:27:11.854]  Well, they're not just going to kill the black people.
[03:27:13.107 --> 03:27:18.209]  State Department, Memorandum 200.
[03:27:18.209 --> 03:27:22.150]  Royal Commission on Population.
[03:27:22.150 --> 03:27:23.230]  All of you need to learn about it.
[03:27:23.230 --> 03:27:25.051]  That's their main agenda in there.
[03:27:25.051 --> 03:27:27.771]  Getting a world government to kill you and your family.
[03:27:27.771 --> 03:27:29.832]  I know it's funny now, but it won't be when you're dying.
[03:27:30.305 --> 03:27:31.266]  Well, there you go.
[03:27:31.266 --> 03:27:33.407]  And Alex is educating some of their minions.
[03:27:33.407 --> 03:27:35.128]  They just walked away.
[03:27:35.128 --> 03:27:40.031]  And it is exciting times when they're forced to put out the list without Jim Tucker getting it.
[03:27:40.031 --> 03:27:42.112]  They realize the list is going to be leaked.
[03:27:42.112 --> 03:27:44.853]  It is exciting times when they're putting out a press release.
[03:27:44.853 --> 03:27:51.377]  And I don't know if you've heard this, but did you hear that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton magically met last night in D.C.
[03:27:51.377 --> 03:27:55.139]  when the Bilderberg Conference was kicked off in D.C.?
[03:27:55.139 --> 03:27:56.400]  No, I didn't know that.
[03:27:56.400 --> 03:27:58.101]  Yeah, they were all over television yesterday.
[03:27:58.101 --> 03:27:59.882]  Barack was on a sit-down interview.
[03:28:00.780 --> 03:28:01.300]  We're good to go.
[03:28:22.705 --> 03:28:27.370]  But they'll take, you know, CFR Obama just because he is a slick speaker.
[03:28:27.370 --> 03:28:28.712]  People are getting behind him.
[03:28:28.712 --> 03:28:31.154]  They are fooled because of his rhetoric.
[03:28:31.154 --> 03:28:32.376]  He hasn't said anything.
[03:28:32.376 --> 03:28:33.857]  You know, he hasn't said anything.
[03:28:33.857 --> 03:28:34.998]  He hasn't said, I'm coming.
[03:28:34.998 --> 03:28:36.140]  We're getting out of Iraq.
[03:28:36.140 --> 03:28:39.083]  He hasn't said, you know, homeland security is out of the picture.
[03:28:39.083 --> 03:28:43.367]  He's going to keep the same bureaucracies that have been created by this administration.
[03:28:43.367 --> 03:28:44.809]  And he's going to continue this agenda.
[03:28:45.925 --> 03:28:48.587]  And shouldn't we have a president that's loyal to our country?
[03:28:48.587 --> 03:28:52.511]  I mean, that just doesn't even seem to be an issue that people aren't even bringing up.
[03:28:52.511 --> 03:28:54.833]  It's like, he's not loyal to our country.
[03:28:54.833 --> 03:29:00.177]  I mean, even his church says, you know, talked about having loyalty to Africa.
[03:29:00.177 --> 03:29:04.121]  It's like, well, shouldn't we just have a president that's loyal to our country?
[03:29:04.121 --> 03:29:10.226]  I mean, I don't know, maybe that's crazy, but I... I'm thinking maybe a president who believes in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[03:29:10.939 --> 03:29:15.222]  And wants smaller government, and wants oversight, and wants checks and balances.
[03:29:15.222 --> 03:29:16.824]  I'm thinking Ron Paul!
[03:29:16.824 --> 03:29:18.885]  I'm thinking Ron Paul, too.
[03:29:18.885 --> 03:29:19.265]  Exactly.
[03:29:19.265 --> 03:29:21.968]  We're going to take your calls with Amy Allen on the other side.
[03:29:21.968 --> 03:29:23.389]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:23.389 --> 03:29:24.409]  I am Jason Bermas.

[03:29:51.287 --> 03:29:56.491]  Prices on food are getting so high, warehouses are installing security systems and guards.
[03:29:56.491 --> 03:30:00.393]  You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food.
[03:30:00.393 --> 03:30:08.358]  We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford it, or there will be no food at any price.
[03:30:08.358 --> 03:30:12.361]  We can't grow enough of our own food, even with genetically altered trash.
[03:30:12.361 --> 03:30:15.343]  It will give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered food.
[03:30:16.440 --> 03:30:20.664]  They think God didn't get it right, so Monsanto had to step in.
[03:30:20.664 --> 03:30:24.508]  If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay.
[03:30:24.508 --> 03:30:25.729]  We won't tell.
[03:30:25.729 --> 03:30:26.029]  Call 800-409-5633.

[03:32:53.068 --> 03:32:55.351]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:32:57.429 --> 03:33:00.970]  There truly is a war on for your mind right now.
[03:33:00.970 --> 03:33:01.751]  Every day.
[03:33:01.751 --> 03:33:06.973]  Every day you turn on that television, they are pumping disinformation into your brain.
[03:33:06.973 --> 03:33:08.954]  They're telling you, buy, buy, buy.
[03:33:08.954 --> 03:33:11.255]  Pay no attention to the men behind the curtain.
[03:33:11.255 --> 03:33:19.658]  Well, the men behind the curtain are being exposed right now at Bilderberg 2008, and it's thanks to people like Alex Jones, who's a personal hero of mine, a good friend.
[03:33:20.609 --> 03:33:23.471]  And God bless him, Luke Rudowski and others who are out there.
[03:33:23.471 --> 03:33:25.052]  I saw Dave Cahill was out there.
[03:33:25.052 --> 03:33:27.233]  He's an amazing musician.
[03:33:27.233 --> 03:33:30.536]  Abby from 9-11 Truth in LA.
[03:33:30.536 --> 03:33:33.137]  Just a lot of people showed up this year and it's great.
[03:33:33.137 --> 03:33:35.079]  It forced them to put out a press release.
[03:33:35.079 --> 03:33:39.361]  We're talking to Amy Allen, who in her own right is quite the patriot.
[03:33:39.361 --> 03:33:40.802]  An amazing singer.
[03:33:40.802 --> 03:33:44.004]  She's got the Ron Paul, Start a Revolution song.
[03:33:44.004 --> 03:33:47.927]  When can people expect new material outside of this Scott and Amy project?
[03:33:49.183 --> 03:33:51.365]  Well, I'm actually recording it.
[03:33:51.365 --> 03:33:54.667]  I've written all the songs, so I'm recording it now.
[03:33:54.667 --> 03:33:55.788]  I'm in the recording process.
[03:33:55.788 --> 03:33:57.309]  So, very soon.
[03:33:57.309 --> 03:33:59.210]  Excellent.
[03:33:59.210 --> 03:34:01.451]  In the next couple months or so.
[03:34:01.451 --> 03:34:01.731]  Awesome.
[03:34:01.731 --> 03:34:03.493]  Alright, let's take some callers, Amy.
[03:34:03.493 --> 03:34:07.375]  Let's go to Joe in Chicago, because it seems to be on topic.
[03:34:07.375 --> 03:34:09.036]  Joe, are you with us?
[03:34:09.036 --> 03:34:09.356]  Hello.
[03:34:09.356 --> 03:34:10.977]  How are you doing, Joe?
[03:34:10.977 --> 03:34:11.858]  Doing pretty good, Jason.
[03:34:11.858 --> 03:34:12.518]  How's it going?
[03:34:12.518 --> 03:34:12.699]  Good.
[03:34:15.322 --> 03:34:26.566]  Before I had a couple questions for Amy, I had one thing that I wanted to tell you is obviously I'm here in Chicago, you know, Obama country, and I was watching local TV last night.
[03:34:26.566 --> 03:34:37.630]  I don't know if it was WGN or WBBM, one of the local stations here, but somebody was asking, well, you know, where's the whole, you know, party for the Obama thing?
[03:34:38.368 --> 03:34:43.971]  And they were talking to one of his staff, and he had said that Obama is in Virginia.
[03:34:43.971 --> 03:34:46.131]  Yeah, oh no, it's all over the news!
[03:34:46.131 --> 03:34:47.212]  He's in D.C.
[03:34:47.212 --> 03:34:50.073]  He met Hillary Clinton last night, supposedly in her D.C.
[03:34:50.073 --> 03:34:54.255]  home, on the night that Bilderberg kicked off in Chantilly, Virginia.
[03:34:54.255 --> 03:34:57.576]  There's no doubt that members of the conference were there at that meeting.
[03:34:57.576 --> 03:34:59.657]  Give me a break, of course!
[03:34:59.657 --> 03:35:01.858]  Yeah, unbelievable.
[03:35:01.858 --> 03:35:05.240]  But hey, I'm just very pleased to be able to talk to both of you.
[03:35:05.240 --> 03:35:07.581]  Jason, you've got some awesome works.
[03:35:07.581 --> 03:35:07.781]  Amy,
[03:35:08.796 --> 03:35:14.299]  I don't even have words for you, because your music is just awesome, I really have to say.
[03:35:14.299 --> 03:35:15.860]  Oh, thank you so much!
[03:35:15.860 --> 03:35:17.381]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[03:35:17.381 --> 03:35:18.081]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:35:18.081 --> 03:35:27.986]  I mean, I just got, it was really funny, because I actually got turned on to you, believe it or not, by, through Infowars.com, if you could believe that.
[03:35:27.986 --> 03:35:34.109]  And I watched the video on Ron Paul Revolution, I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm like, this has got an incredible production, it's got a great hook,
[03:35:34.508 --> 03:35:35.708]  Incredible Synth Baseline.
[03:35:35.708 --> 03:35:39.310]  I'm like, this is seriously what we need.
[03:35:39.310 --> 03:35:47.833]  We need somebody who's got incredible talent that is a celebrity that is able to get, you know, this message out to the people.
[03:35:47.833 --> 03:35:50.994]  You know, because, I mean, that's kind of like how I got involved with this.
[03:35:50.994 --> 03:36:02.298]  And now, if we can only, you know, because of the fact that you had all this information on your MySpace page, and we're getting other people that are getting more interested in this, and it's breaking wide open, and I think that's really great what you're doing.
[03:36:02.697 --> 03:36:10.802]  And the way that you took a stand against Elektra and what they were trying to do to you, I think that is just appalling.
[03:36:10.802 --> 03:36:11.903]  Well, thank you.
[03:36:11.903 --> 03:36:23.850]  There's not too many artists that are putting their career on the line to stand up for what they believe in politically, but it wasn't even a choice.
[03:36:25.347 --> 03:36:26.388]  I had to do it.
[03:36:26.388 --> 03:36:31.213]  I don't even care if it's not the smartest business move or the best move of my career.
[03:36:31.213 --> 03:36:32.233]  People have to know.
[03:36:32.233 --> 03:36:36.898]  And if it means that I sell less records, so be it.
[03:36:36.898 --> 03:36:42.403]  People have to know because they can't just stand by and let our country get to its knees.
[03:36:42.967 --> 03:36:44.448]  Thank you, Joe.
[03:36:44.448 --> 03:36:45.368]  Thank you for the call, Joe.
[03:36:45.368 --> 03:36:46.088]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:36:46.088 --> 03:36:55.092]  We can't let this nation crumble and, you know, it's just great that you stepped up to do that, Amy, and, you know, you are going to wake up a lot more people that wouldn't normally be woken up.
[03:36:55.092 --> 03:36:56.753]  Again, pop culture is the way.
[03:36:56.753 --> 03:37:00.174]  I mean, how many people were brought into 9-11 Truth through Rosie O'Donnell?
[03:37:00.174 --> 03:37:06.817]  How many people were brought into 9-11 Truth through Charlie Sheen that would have never, ever, ever taken a look at this information?
[03:37:06.817 --> 03:37:10.099]  Alright, on topic, let's go to Rick in Ohio.
[03:37:10.099 --> 03:37:10.679]  Rick, are you with us?
[03:37:12.475 --> 03:37:13.856]  No, did we drop Rick?
[03:37:13.856 --> 03:37:14.576]  Hi, how are you doing?
[03:37:14.576 --> 03:37:16.097]  Hey, how are you doing, Rick?
[03:37:16.097 --> 03:37:17.418]  Interesting show.
[03:37:17.418 --> 03:37:18.558]  Thanks.
[03:37:18.558 --> 03:37:26.843]  I wanted to bring up something that's on topic, but perhaps something a lot of your listeners haven't thought about.
[03:37:26.843 --> 03:37:36.688]  In most respects, I'd have to say I support Ron Paul, like I'm assuming both of you do, from listening to the last ten minutes here.
[03:37:36.688 --> 03:37:39.550]  But, you know, I'm a real animal lover as well.
[03:37:40.788 --> 03:37:44.351]  Anyone who's had a cat or a dog or... I got two myself.
[03:37:44.351 --> 03:37:48.633]  Yeah, I would imagine most decent people are.
[03:37:48.633 --> 03:37:55.718]  And one thing I googled was the presidential candidates and animal rights.
[03:37:55.718 --> 03:38:06.706]  And much to my dismay, what I found was that the three tools in the election at this point, you know, Obama, Hillary and McCain,
[03:38:07.660 --> 03:38:14.967]  Actually have either perfect or very good animal rights voting histories.
[03:38:14.967 --> 03:38:16.928]  Well, let me let me speak to that for a second.
[03:38:16.928 --> 03:38:18.049]  And Ron Paul doesn't.
[03:38:18.049 --> 03:38:18.890]  Well, all right.
[03:38:18.890 --> 03:38:26.197]  First of all, I think Ron Paul is not only about human rights, but he's about saving this country first, and that's why maybe animal rights take a secondary nature.
[03:38:26.197 --> 03:38:28.719]  Secondly, these globalists love animal rights.
[03:38:28.719 --> 03:38:30.861]  Peter Singer, who is a total one-worlder,
[03:38:31.385 --> 03:38:36.226]  You know, talks like animals are better than people, and I just don't believe that, man.
[03:38:36.226 --> 03:38:37.647]  I'm here to save humanity.
[03:38:37.647 --> 03:38:39.808]  I'm sorry, but animals come second.
[03:38:39.808 --> 03:38:53.972]  You know, I feel like those people, their hearts are in the right place, but we have so many real issues from the Federal Reserve, from the gas prices, to imperialism in the Middle East, to the police state at home, that animal rights is just going to have to take a backseat.
[03:38:53.972 --> 03:38:55.612]  I thank you for the call.
[03:38:55.612 --> 03:38:57.453]  What do you think, Amy?
[03:38:57.453 --> 03:38:59.513]  I mean, I agree we have to prioritize.
[03:38:59.513 --> 03:39:01.114]  I mean, the fact is that if we don't have
[03:39:01.890 --> 03:39:12.781]  Um, you know, if we don't have our country, you know, then, uh, what if someone else is, uh, you know, we're going to have a North American Union if we're all going to be chipped.
[03:39:12.781 --> 03:39:14.863]  If, um, you know, we don't have a right to a trial.
[03:39:14.863 --> 03:39:16.345]  Like dogs.
[03:39:16.345 --> 03:39:17.946]  I mean, I just, I want to prioritize.
[03:39:17.946 --> 03:39:19.668]  I mean, there's just, we have to prioritize.
[03:39:19.668 --> 03:39:22.110]  It's like, I feel like we're in a state of emergency.
[03:39:22.110 --> 03:39:22.691]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:39:22.691 --> 03:39:24.633]  And we had Jesse Benton on who is the, uh,
[03:39:25.219 --> 03:39:34.448]  The chair of Ron Paul's campaign, he announced today that they're going to be having something going on in Minneapolis on September 2nd, a Tuesday.
[03:39:34.448 --> 03:39:37.490]  And I also mentioned them to you and they were very well aware of your work.
[03:39:37.490 --> 03:39:40.153]  They wanted to thank you and they're a huge fan of the song.
[03:39:40.413 --> 03:39:41.034]  Yeah, I would love to.
[03:40:05.771 --> 03:40:13.577]  Telling your producer that I'd love if Alex played the Ron Paul song over the Bullhorn at the Bilderberg.
[03:40:13.577 --> 03:40:15.218]  Well, I'll call him after the show.
[03:40:15.218 --> 03:40:17.881]  Maybe we can get that live on the WeAreChange feed.
[03:40:17.881 --> 03:40:22.504]  By the way, WeAreChange.org has a live video and audio feed of Bilderberg right now.
[03:40:22.504 --> 03:40:25.927]  There's about 15 or 20 people around Alex.
[03:40:25.927 --> 03:40:30.450]  Matt Lepacek, Luke Radowski, Aaron Dykes, writer for Jones Report.
[03:40:30.450 --> 03:40:31.091]  Just a ton of
[03:40:31.411 --> 03:40:33.452]  Awake people, it's so good to see.
[03:40:33.452 --> 03:40:34.892]  All right, let's jump to yet another caller.
[03:40:34.892 --> 03:40:36.832]  Let's go to Corey in California.
[03:40:36.832 --> 03:40:38.233]  Corey, are you with us?
[03:40:38.233 --> 03:40:39.313]  Hey, hello.
[03:40:39.313 --> 03:40:40.133]  How you doing, man?
[03:40:40.133 --> 03:40:41.094]  This is Rick in Ohio.
[03:40:41.094 --> 03:40:43.134]  I think you got our names switched around there.
[03:40:43.134 --> 03:40:43.934]  Oh, okay, all right.
[03:40:43.934 --> 03:40:49.556]  Okay, but on his call, I need to address, he mentioned the animal rights and the voting.
[03:40:49.556 --> 03:40:56.257]  Okay, first off, let me try to explain something to him, if I can do it well.
[03:40:56.257 --> 03:40:58.358]  This is like PETA.
[03:40:59.216 --> 03:41:23.002]  The PETA people, the environmentalist people, a lot of people get involved in this because it sounds good, it sounds like you're going to help the animals, you're going to help the environmentalists, but all it really gets down to is these CFR-funded front groups, is all they are, they're trying to enlist you as a useful idiot to support further restrictive legislation against you, the people,
[03:41:23.522 --> 03:41:28.185]  And that's the reason Ron Paul doesn't vote for these scams, because he knows a scam when he sees one.
[03:41:28.185 --> 03:41:47.075]  Well, did you see the website that ABC, we did a story about this last week, ABC linked to this quote-unquote child's website called planetslayer.com, and it was all about your carbon footprint, they're getting ready to tax you for breathing, how much gas you use, how many cars you own, how much energy you use, they're going to actually tax that.
[03:41:47.555 --> 03:41:51.597]  And they were saying that your carbon footprint was less than that of a pig.
[03:41:51.597 --> 03:41:52.618]  The pig deserved to live.
[03:41:52.618 --> 03:41:57.561]  And they literally showed a small baby pig and a big pig and how much their carbon footprint was.
[03:41:57.561 --> 03:42:03.024]  And they said, by the time that you had used your carbon footprint up, you'd be a whopping 14 months old.
[03:42:03.024 --> 03:42:05.165]  And there was a pool of blood in the middle.
[03:42:05.165 --> 03:42:07.226]  They quickly pulled that website.
[03:42:07.226 --> 03:42:09.087]  But, you know, we know what the agenda is.
[03:42:09.087 --> 03:42:09.988]  It's more control.
[03:42:09.988 --> 03:42:11.448]  It's another tax.
[03:42:11.448 --> 03:42:13.009]  And it's absolutely ridiculous.
[03:42:13.009 --> 03:42:14.750]  Al Gore is not your friend either, folks.
[03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:15.591]  I thank you for the call.
[03:42:17.535 --> 03:42:19.596]  Let's see if we can get Cory in California.
[03:42:19.596 --> 03:42:21.076]  Is he on the line?
[03:42:21.076 --> 03:42:22.197]  Cory?
[03:42:22.197 --> 03:42:23.357]  No?
[03:42:23.357 --> 03:42:25.217]  All right, how about Frank in Ohio?
[03:42:25.217 --> 03:42:25.678]  Yeah.
[03:42:25.678 --> 03:42:26.018]  Oh, Cory.
[03:42:26.018 --> 03:42:26.538]  We got Cory.
[03:42:26.538 --> 03:42:27.978]  All right, Cory, what's your question?
[03:42:27.978 --> 03:42:29.199]  Hey, what's up, Jason?
[03:42:29.199 --> 03:42:37.301]  No, I was just Googling Bilderberg last night, and then I come up on a Bilderberg press release.
[03:42:37.734 --> 03:42:38.114]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:42:38.114 --> 03:42:39.215]  We've read it on air today.
[03:42:39.215 --> 03:42:40.136]  Can you believe that?
[03:42:40.136 --> 03:42:40.797]  I mean, I was in shock.
[03:42:40.797 --> 03:42:41.317]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:42:41.317 --> 03:42:44.480]  I was in shock, too, this morning when I actually got into it.
[03:42:44.480 --> 03:42:49.044]  I actually went and did a Google search of the past 24 hours on stories on Bilderberg.
[03:42:49.044 --> 03:42:52.347]  Someone had emailed me the press release, but the list was already out.
[03:42:52.347 --> 03:42:53.869]  And, yeah, they're just announcing it.
[03:42:53.869 --> 03:42:54.830]  We're your global masters.
[03:42:54.830 --> 03:42:56.271]  You don't deserve to know what's going on.
[03:42:56.271 --> 03:42:58.213]  It's going to be a private meeting.
[03:42:58.213 --> 03:42:59.214]  No thank you press.
[03:42:59.214 --> 03:43:01.836]  You're already on the inside, so we'll tell you what to write.
[03:43:01.836 --> 03:43:03.718]  Has anyone called this number?
[03:43:03.718 --> 03:43:03.978]  Yeah!
[03:43:04.352 --> 03:43:07.655]  Yeah, a lot of people have called the number.
[03:43:07.655 --> 03:43:09.636]  It's the American Friends of Bilderberg.
[03:43:09.636 --> 03:43:12.658]  It's actually an organization that I just learned about.
[03:43:12.658 --> 03:43:14.640]  Aaron Dykes enlightened me on it last week.
[03:43:14.640 --> 03:43:17.982]  I didn't think that Bilderberg had any friends outside of the organization.
[03:43:17.982 --> 03:43:19.664]  Well, they're not my friend, that's for sure.
[03:43:19.664 --> 03:43:21.685]  Yeah, American Friends of Bilderberg.
[03:43:21.685 --> 03:43:23.927]  It's all part of the language and the nomenclature.
[03:43:23.927 --> 03:43:29.231]  They want to make you think that America supports Bilderberg when the vast majority don't even know
[03:43:29.771 --> 03:43:35.676]  Well, the way I look at it is, I mean, when I got really deep into, you know, into my research and just pretty much just
[03:43:48.536 --> 03:43:53.557]  I completely immersed myself in just research and study and everything that Alex would say.
[03:43:53.557 --> 03:43:57.798]  You know, he always says, you know, if you don't believe me, go research it, go find it out, go look at the documents.
[03:43:57.798 --> 03:44:00.559]  And I did that, you know, and I really got into it.
[03:44:00.559 --> 03:44:04.560]  And what I found was, well, the A, I couldn't plead.
[03:44:04.560 --> 03:44:04.800]  Ever.
[03:44:04.800 --> 03:44:10.061]  Because I was just so upset and distressed about everything.
[03:44:10.061 --> 03:44:14.422]  But what I realized was that it's truly a spiritual battle.
[03:44:14.422 --> 03:44:15.923]  It's not just a political battle.
[03:44:15.923 --> 03:44:17.343]  I mean, I feel that it is
[03:44:17.884 --> 03:44:18.865]  The spiritual battle.
[03:44:18.865 --> 03:44:26.088]  So, you know, what we can do is do what I believe what God created us to do.
[03:44:26.088 --> 03:44:28.389]  So if you're a good writer, blog.
[03:44:28.389 --> 03:44:28.969]  You know, write.
[03:44:28.969 --> 03:44:29.550]  Write a book.
[03:44:29.550 --> 03:44:31.831]  If God made you a good speaker, speak.
[03:44:31.831 --> 03:44:32.491]  Speak the truth.
[03:44:32.491 --> 03:44:33.352]  You know, speak to people.
[03:44:33.352 --> 03:44:35.673]  If you're a good organizer, organize.
[03:44:35.673 --> 03:44:38.094]  If you're a politician, you know, run for office.
[03:44:38.094 --> 03:44:39.735]  If you sing, write a song.
[03:44:39.735 --> 03:44:41.836]  But we all have to play our role.
[03:44:41.836 --> 03:44:46.538]  We all have to do what God made us do, or, you know, created us to do.
[03:44:47.333 --> 03:44:53.896]  And if we all do our part, you know, we can turn this around, you know?
[03:44:53.896 --> 03:44:59.119]  Absolutely, and you know, each of us have great power from within.
[03:44:59.119 --> 03:45:01.040]  And we just need to harness that power.
[03:45:01.040 --> 03:45:02.360]  We have to say, you know what?
[03:45:02.360 --> 03:45:02.981]  I've had enough.
[03:45:02.981 --> 03:45:04.581]  What can I contribute?
[03:45:04.581 --> 03:45:07.183]  And you know, that's why I make documentary films.
[03:45:07.183 --> 03:45:09.044]  That's why I blog about the subject.
[03:45:09.044 --> 03:45:11.305]  That's why I do this radio show.
[03:45:11.305 --> 03:45:11.765]  It's because
[03:45:12.859 --> 03:45:21.284]  We have to reach these people by any means necessary, and I don't see anybody in the so-called establishment setting up or stepping up and saying these things.
[03:45:21.284 --> 03:45:36.172]  You know, we had a couple people kind of hinting at the truth, you know, Dennis Kucinich isn't all that bad, and I liked what Mike Revell had to say 90% of the time, but they're not out there every day, you know, trying to get this to the masses, and that's what we need.
[03:45:36.172 --> 03:45:40.395]  We need more and more people to say, all right, it's time to step up
[03:45:40.856 --> 03:45:42.657]  It's time to share this information.
[03:45:42.657 --> 03:45:44.298]  It's time to take our country back.
[03:45:44.298 --> 03:45:48.780]  And I hope that Ron Paul has that march on Washington he talked about some months ago.
[03:45:48.780 --> 03:45:51.201]  Hopefully the next time we have Jesse Benton on.
[03:45:51.201 --> 03:45:56.084]  And it's time to not be, to stop the brainwashing of it.
[03:45:56.084 --> 03:45:58.325]  You know, not cool to talk about it.
[03:45:58.325 --> 03:45:59.606]  Like, it is cool, you know?
[03:45:59.606 --> 03:46:01.046]  And it is cool to talk about it.
[03:46:01.046 --> 03:46:08.370]  It's cool to talk about politics and what's going on in the mainstream media and the fact that they're completely, they're not reporting, you know, they're rooting.
[03:46:09.142 --> 03:46:09.983]  Yeah, no, I'm with you.
[03:46:09.983 --> 03:46:10.784]  And you know what?
[03:46:10.784 --> 03:46:11.384]  You're right.
[03:46:11.384 --> 03:46:14.087]  It's time to make it cool again to be informed.
[03:46:14.087 --> 03:46:14.408]  Yes.
[03:46:14.408 --> 03:46:24.198]  You know, it shouldn't be the time that everybody goes and reads the tabloid rags about Britney Spears and how she's gained 20 pounds and she's on five different medications and shaved her head.
[03:46:24.198 --> 03:46:25.399]  I don't care.
[03:46:25.399 --> 03:46:26.700]  It means nothing to my life.
[03:46:26.700 --> 03:46:30.104]  You know, Paris Hilton's latest sex tape, yeah, it's great for a laugh.
[03:46:30.664 --> 03:46:33.886]  But other than that, I don't know why it's on every single network.
[03:46:33.886 --> 03:46:35.667]  You know, Jesse Ventura made a great point.
[03:46:35.667 --> 03:46:38.229]  When Anna Nicole Smith died, who cares?
[03:46:38.229 --> 03:46:38.749]  Okay?
[03:46:38.749 --> 03:46:43.352]  She was a reality TV star after she was a train wreck and a Playboy model.
[03:46:43.352 --> 03:46:45.093]  It doesn't affect my life.
[03:46:45.093 --> 03:46:53.498]  But most people don't even know... I would say most people couldn't pick out five names on this Bilderberg list when a lot of them are part of the U.S.
[03:46:53.498 --> 03:46:54.278]  administration.
[03:46:54.278 --> 03:46:54.799]  You know?
[03:46:54.799 --> 03:46:59.582]  A lot of them have been making decisions like Henry Kissinger for almost half a century.
[03:47:00.609 --> 03:47:02.149]  I mean, that's scary to me.
[03:47:02.149 --> 03:47:03.450]  It's totally scary.
[03:47:03.450 --> 03:47:10.151]  And when I put out this song, there's so much support for the song.
[03:47:10.151 --> 03:47:14.352]  There was so much love, and I was actually astonished at the support.
[03:47:14.352 --> 03:47:18.973]  It was on the front page of Dig several times, and Dig would pull it.
[03:47:18.973 --> 03:47:20.233]  Well, they got the Berry Brigade there.
[03:47:20.233 --> 03:47:22.094]  How dare you tell the truth on Dig?
[03:47:22.094 --> 03:47:28.455]  The funny thing about that is the guy from Dig joked about how he went to Bohemian Grove with his dad, I think, last year.
[03:47:30.200 --> 03:47:31.101]  That's on YouTube.
[03:47:31.101 --> 03:47:40.125]  It's just like, yeah, you know, I go to these elitist meetings and we're going to bury your stories and we're going to act like PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com are the onion and they're not real.
[03:47:40.125 --> 03:47:40.365]  Right.
[03:47:40.365 --> 03:47:47.709]  You know, it's absolutely ludicrous, but we just got to keep, you know, pressing and using, using the mainstream against itself, I guess.
[03:47:47.709 --> 03:47:48.509]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:47:48.509 --> 03:47:57.474]  And what I was going to say is that I was getting, you know, some really, some of the negative comments, or not negative, but some of the posts were, would say things like,
[03:47:58.047 --> 03:48:03.211]  Oh, come on, Amy, you know, has the Patriot Act really affected you personally?
[03:48:03.211 --> 03:48:16.660]  And it would just make me so mad, because the Patriot Act has so, so much affected me personally, that I can't even, you know, I just couldn't, I can't even tell you.
[03:48:16.660 --> 03:48:25.486]  But basically, I went down to my bank, and because of the Patriot Act, I couldn't get an ATM card.
[03:48:27.034 --> 03:48:33.860]  Literally, they said, due to the Patriot Act, I cannot give you... My strip on my card is broke.
[03:48:33.860 --> 03:48:34.721]  And it wasn't working.
[03:48:34.721 --> 03:48:39.305]  So I was like, well, I need to get, you know, an ATM card with a symbol, like MasterCard Visa.
[03:48:39.305 --> 03:48:41.246]  And there was all this drama, and they're like, you know what?
[03:48:41.246 --> 03:48:47.932]  Because you don't do this, this, this, and this, and this, there's like a list of five things, you could be a potential terrorist.
[03:48:48.567 --> 03:48:51.312]  So, we can't issue you another one.
[03:48:51.312 --> 03:48:58.665]  Well, I imagine you also fly pretty frequently and the hoops you have to jump through at the airport to get on a plane are just absolutely ludicrous.
[03:48:58.665 --> 03:48:59.606]  No water bottles?
[03:48:59.606 --> 03:49:00.708]  Come on.
[03:49:00.708 --> 03:49:00.889]  Yeah.
[03:49:02.353 --> 03:49:06.535]  Oh, the terrorists are gonna use liquid bombs to blow us all up!
[03:49:06.535 --> 03:49:07.255]  Give me a break!
[03:49:07.255 --> 03:49:09.376]  The only time they ever get weapons through, there's a drill.
[03:49:09.376 --> 03:49:10.597]  I had a good buddy of mine.
[03:49:10.597 --> 03:49:12.037]  He was in the military.
[03:49:12.037 --> 03:49:14.158]  He got out right before 9-11.
[03:49:14.158 --> 03:49:18.720]  He didn't end up having to go overseas, but he went into security over at LaGuardia Airport.
[03:49:18.720 --> 03:49:22.262]  He was in the TSA, worked there for like five years, and he would tell me how it works.
[03:49:22.262 --> 03:49:27.284]  He's like, look, in the last five years I worked here, we never had one real terrorist threat.
[03:49:27.284 --> 03:49:28.865]  He's like, every time that weapons
[03:49:29.378 --> 03:49:30.018]  Pretty shocking stuff.
[03:49:52.313 --> 03:49:52.953]  Yeah.
[03:49:52.953 --> 03:49:55.514]  We got one final segment coming up with you, Amy.
[03:49:55.514 --> 03:49:57.835]  Is there any other message that you want to get out there?
[03:49:57.835 --> 03:49:58.955]  You want to talk to the people?
[03:49:58.955 --> 03:50:02.496]  You want to let people know where they can find, you know, Amy Allen stuff?
[03:50:02.496 --> 03:50:07.498]  Well, they can, um... Once again, the name's spelled A-I-M-E-E-A-L-L-E-N.
[03:50:07.498 --> 03:50:11.719]  They can go to my MySpace, myspace.com backslash Amy Allen.
[03:50:11.719 --> 03:50:19.102]  Um, I have a radio show every Sunday on ND103.1 FM in Los Angeles, Suicide Girls Radio.
[03:50:19.102 --> 03:50:20.002]  We talk a lot about
[03:50:20.883 --> 03:50:31.888]  Um, the issue, uh, on the 22nd, June 22nd, we're having a debate, a global warming debate, uh, where, um, I call it this dwindle in a farce and a lie.
[03:50:31.888 --> 03:50:32.648]  Yeah, that's good.
[03:50:32.648 --> 03:50:38.771]  We've got some UCLA panelists that are, you know... Hold it right there, it's InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:50:38.771 --> 03:50:40.912]  It's the Alex Jones Show final segment, up next.
[03:50:46.229 --> 03:50:49.410]  If you're an adult male, you need to listen to this information.
[03:50:49.410 --> 03:50:53.531]  By the age of 60, half of all men have a prostate-related problem.
[03:50:53.531 --> 03:51:00.133]  In the past, many men have turned to saw palmetto to support prostate health, but now there's something much better.
[03:51:00.133 --> 03:51:01.773]  It's called beta-prostate.
[03:51:01.773 --> 03:51:07.294]  Beta-prostate contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary saw palmetto.
[03:51:07.294 --> 03:51:13.196]  In fact, you'd have to take a hundred saw palmetto capsules to get the same benefits of one dose of beta-prostate.
[03:51:13.476 --> 03:51:19.198]  It's guaranteed to provide noticeable support even if you're already having prostate related health issues.
[03:51:19.198 --> 03:51:23.279]  Now you can get Roger Mason's Beta Prostate Formula through this special offer.
[03:51:23.279 --> 03:51:27.801]  And if you call now, you'll learn how to get a free bottle of Beta Prostate with your order.

[03:51:29.822 --> 03:51:30.542]  Here's how to order.
[03:51:30.822 --> 03:51:32.724]  Call now to order Beta Prostate.

[03:51:34.986 --> 03:51:35.266]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[03:51:46.169 --> 03:51:59.320]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[03:51:59.320 --> 03:52:03.164]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[03:52:03.504 --> 03:52:10.388]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[03:52:10.388 --> 03:52:13.789]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[03:52:13.789 --> 03:52:21.693]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[03:52:31.078 --> 03:52:37.320]  On films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[03:52:37.320 --> 03:52:39.941]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[03:52:39.941 --> 03:52:45.263]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[03:52:48.624 --> 03:52:50.965]  Once, America was led by real politicians.
[03:52:50.965 --> 03:52:56.047]  Now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[03:52:56.047 --> 03:52:58.748]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[03:52:58.748 --> 03:53:03.030]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:06.071]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[03:53:06.071 --> 03:53:09.412]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[03:53:09.412 --> 03:53:14.274]  Food riots and breadlines occur daily in 30 nations, and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.
[03:53:14.474 --> 03:53:18.537]  Survival Enterprises are master distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.
[03:53:18.537 --> 03:53:23.479]  Mountain House freeze-dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon, spices, cheese, fruit, and more.
[03:53:23.479 --> 03:53:25.321]  We have tons of food in stock now.

[03:53:41.851 --> 03:53:42.271]  Call now.
[03:53:45.987 --> 03:53:49.629]  We don't need no education.
[03:53:49.629 --> 03:53:52.590]  We don't need no thought control.
[03:54:04.221 --> 03:54:09.383]  No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
[03:54:09.383 --> 03:54:10.923]  They do need to leave those kids alone, man.
[03:54:10.923 --> 03:54:13.364]  Because they're brainwashing them every day.
[03:54:13.364 --> 03:54:16.645]  This is the final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:16.645 --> 03:54:18.145]  And Alex will be back with you on Monday.
[03:54:18.145 --> 03:54:19.766]  I know you guys have put up with me most of the week.
[03:54:20.775 --> 03:54:25.098]  But you can check out the refeed of this broadcast over at InfoWars.com.
[03:54:25.098 --> 03:54:27.159]  We're going to be replaying all four hours.
[03:54:27.159 --> 03:54:28.200]  Some powerful stuff.
[03:54:28.200 --> 03:54:29.761]  We had Jesse Benton on.
[03:54:29.761 --> 03:54:33.444]  Of course, this conversation with Amy Allen has been extraordinary.
[03:54:33.444 --> 03:54:35.745]  Alex has checked in several times from Bilderberg.
[03:54:35.745 --> 03:54:38.087]  We had Luke Rudowsky, Rob Jacobson.
[03:54:38.087 --> 03:54:39.368]  We had Philly 9-11 Truth.
[03:54:39.368 --> 03:54:41.089]  Just another power-packed show.
[03:54:41.089 --> 03:54:46.933]  And in the beginning of the first hour, we went over, I'd say, about 25 to 30 of the members that are at the Bilderberg conference.
[03:54:47.513 --> 03:54:49.633]  As we speak, deciding our fate.
[03:54:49.633 --> 03:54:52.654]  And we went over the press release, the first press release ever.
[03:54:52.654 --> 03:54:55.474]  Good, they can read over the press release while they listen to the iPods we bought them.
[03:54:55.474 --> 03:54:58.295]  That's just wonderful.
[03:54:58.295 --> 03:55:00.575]  Amy, you have a show over in LA.
[03:55:00.575 --> 03:55:03.396]  You're putting out a new album independently.
[03:55:03.396 --> 03:55:05.196]  Can we expect you on tour anytime soon?
[03:55:05.196 --> 03:55:06.916]  Are you going to be traveling around, performing?
[03:55:06.916 --> 03:55:13.378]  Yeah, after I record the album, I'm going to, of course, I'm going to be touring in a city near you.
[03:55:13.378 --> 03:55:15.378]  And just, you know,
[03:55:16.306 --> 03:55:24.010]  Shining my light, just speaking the truth wherever I can, on the radio show, in my blogs, in my music.
[03:55:24.010 --> 03:55:45.781]  You know, I find that, you know, literally just being inundated with the lies from the mainstream media, and just when I watched what they did to Ron Paul, and just not cover him at all, it literally devastated me to the point where I had to just really, you know, attach myself to the real freedom that I was searching for.
[03:55:46.514 --> 03:55:50.758]  Which is God, you know, the real freedom, the true freedom that I have found.
[03:55:50.758 --> 03:55:56.144]  And I had to turn off my TV, I had to stop watching the news, because it was killing me.
[03:55:56.144 --> 03:55:58.426]  Like, it was just killing me.
[03:55:58.426 --> 03:56:08.496]  So I can get it out there, I can release, you know, what has happened and what is happening, not only to America, but spiritually to the world, you know, through my music.
[03:56:09.537 --> 03:56:11.398]  That's my assignment.
[03:56:11.398 --> 03:56:21.286]  Well, you're one of the most well-rounded, well-educated guests we've ever had on this show, especially if you're going to be throwing a debate up on the 22nd rebuking the global warming line.
[03:56:21.286 --> 03:56:29.532]  No one's saying that, you know, climate doesn't change, the Earth doesn't go through cycles, but they're trying to say that we've destroyed the ozone layer and now we have to pay for it.
[03:56:29.532 --> 03:56:30.513]  Literally pay for it.
[03:56:30.513 --> 03:56:31.834]  We literally have to pay for it.
[03:56:32.393 --> 03:56:32.833]  I don't think so.
[03:56:50.532 --> 03:56:51.333]  Of all of our problems.
[03:57:20.956 --> 03:57:23.578]  You know, and then they move their company to Dubai.
[03:57:23.578 --> 03:57:26.539]  So, you know, it's gone well beyond the pale.
[03:57:26.539 --> 03:57:30.522]  Have you, by chance, seen that, uh, I know the Flowbots are pretty popular right now, they're all over.
[03:57:30.522 --> 03:57:32.863]  Have you seen their music video yet?
[03:57:32.863 --> 03:57:33.523]  No.
[03:57:33.523 --> 03:57:39.487]  Oh man, you really have, we had them on a couple weeks ago just because I came across the music video and I showed it to Alex.
[03:57:39.487 --> 03:57:41.748]  Had them on for an hour, but it shows people are waking up.
[03:57:41.748 --> 03:57:43.869]  It's total anti-police state stuff.
[03:57:43.869 --> 03:57:46.010]  I want people to check out Amy Allen, that's A-I-M.
[03:57:47.910 --> 03:57:53.595]  E-E-A-I-M-E-E-Alan, and she's got a MySpace, a website, and a radio show.
[03:57:53.595 --> 03:57:55.757]  Amy, any last words?
[03:57:55.757 --> 03:57:57.799]  God bless America, and thank you for having me.
[03:57:57.799 --> 03:57:58.880]  Well, thanks for being with us.
[03:57:58.880 --> 03:58:01.522]  She's been an awesome guest, and this has been just a great week for me.
[03:58:01.522 --> 03:58:04.025]  Remember, the refeed's over at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:04.025 --> 03:58:05.266]  The Money Bomb, $240,000, folks.
[03:58:05.266 --> 03:58:07.688]  We're gonna try to make it $250,000.

[03:58:38.004 --> 03:58:41.606]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:58:41.606 --> 03:58:44.067]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:58:44.067 --> 03:58:47.109]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:58:47.109 --> 03:58:52.852]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:58:52.852 --> 03:58:56.754]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
