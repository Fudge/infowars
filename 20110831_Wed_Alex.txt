[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:30.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.560 --> 00:38.800]  it is Wednesday the 31st day of August 2011 and we are going to be here live for
[00:38.800 --> 00:44.800]  the next three hours Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer will be joining us to
[00:44.800 --> 00:49.360]  give us his breakdown on what he thinks is happening in Libya and Syria coming
[00:49.360 --> 00:54.200]  up in about 30 minutes from now and then the one the only congressman Ron Paul
[00:54.200 --> 00:59.080]  will be joining us coming up at the bottom of the next hour that could be
[00:59.080 --> 01:03.840]  fluid with all the things going on in Congress but he's scheduled coming up in
[01:03.840 --> 01:09.680]  T-minus one and a half hours from now we are also going to be opening the phones
[01:09.680 --> 01:15.160]  up during the entire third hour of the broadcast today and off and on in the
[01:15.160 --> 01:22.400]  first two hours obviously we have a huge amount of news and information to cover
[01:22.400 --> 01:27.560]  here I think the most important thing I'm going to probably get in today get
[01:27.560 --> 01:35.360]  into today well really two big issues well maybe three issues I was sitting
[01:35.360 --> 01:38.840]  here before I went live I've been up since 5 a.m. getting ready for this
[01:38.840 --> 01:46.560]  radio show today trying to grasp what's unfolding the Congressional Black
[01:46.560 --> 01:50.480]  Caucus has come out and said tea partiers are racist that want to lynch
[01:50.480 --> 01:55.600]  black people that's an actual quote invoking racial division and race war
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.680]  and branding the Tea Party and the ideas of the Tea Party as racist so an
[02:01.680 --> 02:06.840]  absolute poison pill it's like Al Gore saying if you don't support paying
[02:06.840 --> 02:13.120]  carbon taxes to him you're a racist that that it's akin to supporting racism to
[02:13.120 --> 02:18.680]  not support paying carbon taxes Al Gore Barack Obama Lord Rothschild and other
[02:18.680 --> 02:24.400]  so it's more divide and conquer see that's one reason we can't have more
[02:24.400 --> 02:27.680]  immigrants come to this country I mean they're here they're coming the most
[02:27.680 --> 02:31.720]  open country in the world is because when they get here they're not taught
[02:31.720 --> 02:35.800]  about the American dream they're taught about division and balkanization by the
[02:35.800 --> 02:39.800]  government and the dinosaur corporate whore media so that they can then play
[02:39.800 --> 02:45.080]  us off against each other that's the issue that's the problem all over the
[02:45.080 --> 02:48.840]  country in Arizona Texas California schoolchildren in most cases who are
[02:48.840 --> 02:54.000]  Hispanic cannot wear when one case in San Francisco an old Navy shirt that has
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.760]  an American flag on it old glory absolutely is seen by the illegal
[02:58.760 --> 03:02.960]  aliens as an enemy and I've asked Hispanics to call in on the show and I
[03:02.960 --> 03:06.360]  said is this not true they've called in and said no there's a large portion of
[03:06.360 --> 03:09.920]  people from Mexico that don't even want to see the American flag but I'm supposed
[03:09.920 --> 03:14.320]  to go oh great let's just adopt all the policies of Mexico in that narco
[03:14.320 --> 03:20.200]  terrorist state and let's bring in more people who see the American flag and go
[03:20.200 --> 03:25.920]  into convulsions now again that's not most Hispanic Americans incredibly
[03:25.920 --> 03:30.680]  smart hard-working patriotic people but that's the real world of what's taught
[03:30.680 --> 03:34.480]  in Mexican schools what's taught in US universities what I was taught at
[03:34.480 --> 03:40.520]  Anderson High School by my art class and my history class teacher who by the
[03:40.520 --> 03:45.040]  way were as white as the driven snow this is all part of this culture of
[03:45.040 --> 03:49.720]  everybody fighting with each other so Tea Party says let's cut taxes cut
[03:49.720 --> 03:53.160]  government let's restore the Constitution Bill of Rights the Realty
[03:53.160 --> 03:58.000]  Party under Ron Paul and I've watched him for almost four years on MSNBC say
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.520]  it's racist and then you don't like government-run healthcare you're racist
[04:01.520 --> 04:06.520]  and they just invoke this stuff because ladies and gentlemen it works to people
[04:06.520 --> 04:09.880]  that are kind of halfway listening oh man that guy was talking about getting
[04:09.880 --> 04:14.400]  rid of the fellow reserve that that's code for wanting to lunch black people it
[04:14.400 --> 04:19.040]  doesn't make any sense when you're conscious and and paying attention but
[04:19.040 --> 04:21.760]  when you're just kind of halfway listening this is what the social
[04:21.760 --> 04:27.000]  engineers are counting on we have that news also top NASA climate scientist
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.320]  arrest at the White House he's the same guy that endorses a book calling for a
[04:30.320 --> 04:36.160]  post-industrial United States the head of the Goddard Space Center the big news
[04:36.160 --> 04:42.600]  you want to actually save children and women and talk about Hispanics there's a
[04:42.600 --> 04:48.040]  major eugenics operation that's being launched against Mexicans I'm gonna tell
[04:48.040 --> 04:53.560]  you about that when we come back and if you actually want to save people period
[04:53.560 --> 04:58.240]  you better listen when we come back stay with us
[04:59.240 --> 05:03.240]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:03.240 --> 05:07.560]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.560 --> 05:11.960]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how
[05:11.960 --> 05:16.240]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[05:16.240 --> 05:20.560]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[05:20.560 --> 05:24.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[05:24.640 --> 05:29.200]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.200 --> 05:33.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.320 --> 05:37.320]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[05:37.320 --> 05:41.120]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.120 --> 05:43.840]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[08:32.360 --> 08:36.920]  coming up at the bottom of the next hour congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to
[08:36.920 --> 08:42.120]  join us to talk about the economy the election the attacks that he's under
[08:42.120 --> 08:46.720]  because he's been criticizing the fact that FEMA is in control of every
[08:46.720 --> 08:51.480]  emergency situation in the United States that is not their federal role we'll
[08:51.480 --> 08:55.800]  talk about Rick Perry it's now a merge something I didn't even know I thought I
[08:55.800 --> 09:00.600]  knew about everything with Rick Perry not only is Rick Perry the former chief of
[09:00.600 --> 09:06.280]  staff in Texas for the presidential campaign the first time around in 88 or
[09:06.280 --> 09:10.840]  Al Gore not only is he a man who wants to give forced inoculations of a
[09:10.840 --> 09:16.720]  vaccine no to kill and main people that no other country in the world you know
[09:16.720 --> 09:21.320]  basically will accept not until now I'm getting that in a moment not only did he
[09:21.320 --> 09:25.000]  hand over our roads or attempt to hand over 8,000 miles of our roads he was
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.560]  successful with some of them to a foreign Spanish slash Australian company to
[09:29.560 --> 09:36.360]  basically loot the public's pocketbook to use existing roads not only did he go
[09:36.360 --> 09:41.680]  to Bilderberg group meeting not only did he pledge to not run and then break that
[09:41.680 --> 09:45.760]  pledge as we told you he would he is now reportedly the front runner were being
[09:45.760 --> 09:50.440]  told with Ron Paul right behind him who no doubt he would be the admitted
[09:50.440 --> 09:54.760]  leader of the Republican pack if the establishment wasn't running the sigh up
[09:54.760 --> 09:59.880]  that he can't win now it has come out and Rick Perry is defending it very proud
[09:59.880 --> 10:05.640]  of it Rick Perry camp defends 1993 that's three years after he switched to
[10:05.640 --> 10:10.120]  Republican supporting Hillary care and the letter and the public statements
[10:10.120 --> 10:14.520]  have now been dug out of him praising Hillary care when almost every
[10:14.520 --> 10:19.760]  Republican in the nation was violently opposed to socialist single pair
[10:19.760 --> 10:25.480]  takeover of the health care system in this country to to a national health
[10:25.480 --> 10:32.000]  care British style service her her proposal was even worse than the
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.920]  Obamacare which is really admittedly the Massachusetts plan engineered by Mitt
[10:37.920 --> 10:42.600]  Romney so the two supposed main front runners were told Ron Paul's number three
[10:42.600 --> 10:45.680]  but they always ignore him many polls number one or number two but he's
[10:45.680 --> 10:53.200]  undoubtedly number three in the race in incredible move from where he was three
[10:53.200 --> 10:56.720]  and a half years ago could be the president but they run this mantra even
[10:56.720 --> 11:00.040]  when he was on Cavuto yesterday Cavuto said oh I really love you but too bad
[11:00.040 --> 11:04.600]  you can't win too bad you can't win you just kept saying that and giggling I mean
[11:04.600 --> 11:09.840]  right there just slapping Ron Paul upside the face while you're smiling while
[11:09.840 --> 11:16.640]  he did it and just look at Mitt Romney just look at Rick Perry I mean I've got
[11:16.640 --> 11:22.240]  to say I don't like Mitt Romney but he is better than Rick Perry Rick Perry is a
[11:22.240 --> 11:30.520]  political chameleon who makes slick Willie look like a amateur and people
[11:30.520 --> 11:34.760]  deserve what they get if they belly up to the bar just like I did with Obama and
[11:34.760 --> 11:39.800]  go with the establishment golden person and that is what Rick Perry is he is the
[11:39.800 --> 11:43.640]  golden boy and they are putting him out there saying he's the second coming of
[11:43.640 --> 11:47.720]  Ronald Reagan everybody better look out we'll talk about that with Ron Paul
[11:47.720 --> 11:52.360]  coming up and and Rick Perry and Romney are trading barbs at each other
[11:52.360 --> 11:57.280]  calling each other career politicians but it wouldn't even be an issue of
[11:57.280 --> 12:00.760]  Europe politician it was a statesman and done a good job and stood up for the
[12:00.760 --> 12:04.400]  Constitution there's very few of those of course Ron Paul is not a career
[12:04.400 --> 12:11.840]  politician he was a successful family practice doctor and also person who a
[12:11.840 --> 12:19.520]  medical doctor who attended to the birthing of babies but these guys is
[12:19.520 --> 12:23.280]  not just that they're career politicians it is that they are super
[12:23.280 --> 12:31.000]  uber establishment types so we're going to be going over that report today also
[12:31.000 --> 12:38.320]  Paul Watson is set to have his report filed a report we worked on together
[12:38.320 --> 12:43.600]  this morning he is set to have this file the next 10 minutes so when I come back
[12:43.600 --> 12:49.480]  in the next break I can get into this because it affects so many facets of
[12:49.480 --> 12:56.960]  society and is a true illustration of just how corrupt the system has gotten
[12:56.960 --> 13:04.640]  report on man who faces life sentence for recording cops that's Kurt Nemo's
[13:04.640 --> 13:09.440]  headline about it but we have the newscast that we're going to be playing a
[13:09.440 --> 13:15.640]  clip from and in the report the reporter says yes it is illegal to film
[13:15.640 --> 13:24.200]  police in public and this man is facing 70 plus years a total of 75 years in
[13:24.200 --> 13:30.560]  prison for videotaping the police and Kurt's report is good in fact it's
[13:30.560 --> 13:35.680]  excellent but Watson's report that I work with him on this morning that's
[13:35.680 --> 13:39.680]  coming to the pages of prisonplanet.com and info wars.com the
[13:39.680 --> 13:44.800]  next five to ten minutes deals with the fact that this is a hoax and it
[13:44.800 --> 13:50.680]  illustrates how we have a government for and by hoaxing everything is more and
[13:50.680 --> 13:58.280]  more shifting into a just brazen hoaxes because the more bold something is the
[13:58.280 --> 14:03.760]  more wild and insane it is the more people have trouble dealing with it and
[14:03.760 --> 14:10.920]  basically basically processing it so that is coming up in the next segment
[14:10.920 --> 14:14.560]  I forgot to ask the guys with the video list you guys do have that that news
[14:14.560 --> 14:22.880]  report on the man facing 70 plus years and in prison for videotaping the police
[14:22.880 --> 14:28.480]  in public we do have that yeah I sent it a bunch okay well we'll get that it's
[14:28.480 --> 14:41.640]  it's it's it's okay we do we do have that report okay I am yeah here it is so
[14:41.640 --> 14:48.840]  we're gonna be covering that and and analyzing the propaganda now the next
[14:48.840 --> 14:57.360]  story is our top story and I want people to listen to me very carefully I know
[14:57.360 --> 15:02.440]  that a lot of folks listen to talk radio is kind of background chatter but I want
[15:02.440 --> 15:07.480]  you to stop what you're doing if you can and I want you to listen to me very
[15:07.480 --> 15:15.600]  very very carefully because we're dealing with the lives and the health and
[15:15.600 --> 15:25.120]  the reproductive futures of tens of millions of people and if you are
[15:25.120 --> 15:33.720]  Hispanic particularly and have family in Mexico you absolutely must contact them
[15:33.720 --> 15:43.640]  and must warn them you must do everything you can to reach out to them I'm not
[15:43.640 --> 15:48.960]  just here on air saying this we have written probably more than a hundred
[15:48.960 --> 15:53.760]  news articles about this I have interviewed it's got to be more than 20
[15:53.760 --> 16:01.920]  medical doctors scientists endocrinologist you name it on this subject
[16:01.920 --> 16:15.360]  alone in the last five years since 2006 so I'm begging you to listen to me this
[16:15.360 --> 16:26.120]  is a life and death situation modern armies do not generally attack unless
[16:26.120 --> 16:32.360]  it's a nation being taken down with military force the globalist most of
[16:32.360 --> 16:36.240]  their operations are carried on by stealth sodium fluoride in the water
[16:36.240 --> 16:40.920]  radioactive isotopes mined out of the same phosphate limestone put in water
[16:40.920 --> 16:46.920]  supplies in 71% of the United States on record that's now mainstream news but
[16:46.920 --> 16:52.160]  they just report it like it's no big deal GMO crops with added genetic traits
[16:52.160 --> 16:58.200]  that produce chemicals and different hormones to reduce fertility cause
[16:58.200 --> 17:02.440]  cancer organ failure don't believe me genetically modified crops linked to
[17:02.440 --> 17:07.480]  cancer organ failure reduced fertility misfeeding all a proven to do it
[17:07.480 --> 17:12.880]  knowingly put in most plastics and in most printer ink newspapers printouts at
[17:12.880 --> 17:19.360]  your office receipts yet we are all under attack now listen to me carefully
[17:19.360 --> 17:27.640]  well I'm about to get to the new news you remember how every month or so you
[17:27.640 --> 17:31.440]  hear in them just the back of the newspaper seat in the back of the
[17:31.440 --> 17:34.120]  newspaper kind of hear it on the television while you're cooking dinner
[17:34.120 --> 17:40.440]  that the US apologizes or the UN apologizes for accidentally shooting
[17:40.440 --> 17:43.840]  kids up with live polio vaccine and killing and maiming a bunch of them
[17:43.840 --> 17:47.600]  every major country in the world but they operate in third-world nations where
[17:47.600 --> 17:57.440]  they can get away with it Pakistan Nigeria Paraguay Nicaragua El Salvador
[17:57.440 --> 18:03.720]  Peru you constantly see it and then they have big medical firms do the test and
[18:03.720 --> 18:09.560]  say oh yes this was added to the vaccine it has been it has come out over and
[18:09.560 --> 18:14.400]  over and over again giving prisoners giving children syphilis telling them
[18:14.400 --> 18:17.880]  it's another vaccine these people have been caught doing this I want you to
[18:17.880 --> 18:28.440]  listen to me carefully the Gardasil vaccine is a modified live cancer virus
[18:28.440 --> 18:37.520]  the insert for it only says that it covers six of the thousands of different
[18:37.520 --> 18:42.480]  human papilloma viruses that's one of the most rare forms of fatal cancer
[18:42.480 --> 18:51.440]  cervical cancer very rare normally and debilitated people in the trials in 2006
[18:51.440 --> 18:56.800]  there were many deaths just type trials of Gardasil deaths you'll get mainstream
[18:56.800 --> 19:01.320]  news mainstream medical reports other countries did trials and then said you

[24:04.680 --> 24:12.520]  I hear the train come it's rolling around the bed and now we know the system
[24:12.520 --> 24:17.000]  has backdoored sterilence cancer triggers into most of the major GMO
[24:17.000 --> 24:26.080]  crops killing the honey bees you name it look it up for yourself and we know
[24:26.080 --> 24:30.200]  that this Gardasil shot they could only get the US and one or two other
[24:30.200 --> 24:34.640]  countries out of over 180 nations to approve it and start pushing it on
[24:34.640 --> 24:38.760]  children then they lie and say it's the law you've got to take it and Mexico is
[24:38.760 --> 24:44.280]  doing the same thing Mexico plans to administer the vaccine against human
[24:44.280 --> 24:48.440]  papillomavirus which can cause cervical cancer to all girls we're getting next
[24:48.440 --> 24:54.560]  year the country's health ministry said yesterday beginning in 2012 the HPV
[24:54.560 --> 24:57.960]  vaccine will be part of the normal course of shots and they just add more
[24:57.960 --> 25:02.600]  more more then we get more more health problems and vaccines are linked to
[25:02.600 --> 25:07.840]  kidney failure general vaccines just look it up just type in vaccines linked to
[25:07.840 --> 25:11.800]  kidney failure vaccines linked to Alzheimer's I mean it's incredible how
[25:11.800 --> 25:17.280]  deadly they are because they're just pumping all this stuff into you everyone
[25:17.280 --> 25:23.280]  at the age of nine will be inoculated and they admit that deaths from
[25:23.280 --> 25:27.360]  cervical cancer have dropped 47% in the country over the past two decades there
[25:27.360 --> 25:32.720]  was still 13.4 cases for every hundred thousand women last year it is one of the
[25:32.720 --> 25:37.880]  rarest forms of cancer you got a hundred something million people there and
[25:37.880 --> 25:43.880]  4,200 women supposedly died from it and then the vaccine itself causes all
[25:43.880 --> 25:50.600]  sorts of health problems and again when it kills you again if a vaccine's
[25:50.600 --> 25:54.680]  killing a percentage of people you better believe it's dangerous French news
[25:54.680 --> 25:59.920]  agency reporting on this Mexican health authorities hope that by making HPV
[25:59.920 --> 26:03.320]  vaccine universal they can cut the mortality rate from this type of cancer
[26:03.320 --> 26:07.800]  50% for women under the age of 25 and it goes on to say it's sexually
[26:07.800 --> 26:16.960]  transmitted it's warts ladies and gentlemen and I've seen other studies
[26:16.960 --> 26:21.360]  that these type of viral infections you can pull this up that when you have this
[26:21.360 --> 26:24.720]  type of viral infection it lowers your chances of getting a whole bunch of
[26:24.720 --> 26:28.600]  different types of cancer and the scientists believe that it actually
[26:28.600 --> 26:36.160]  augments your immunity you can pull that up they're not sure why but most cancer
[26:36.160 --> 26:42.520]  they have known for 80 years and kept from the public is viral is viral my
[26:42.520 --> 26:45.880]  dad worked at MD Anderson in high school because he was top of his class was
[26:45.880 --> 26:49.120]  sent there on science programs over the summers and then he worked there in
[26:49.120 --> 26:53.560]  college some and they were there injecting rats with cancer was declassified
[26:53.560 --> 26:59.480]  the CIA in the 60s had an injectable fast-acting cancer program the issue here
[26:59.480 --> 27:05.720]  is that this vaccine is extremely dangerous and now they're gonna try to
[27:05.720 --> 27:09.080]  force it on everybody down in Mexico and then now there's all these other
[27:09.080 --> 27:13.760]  vaccines coming out and now they're trying to force HPV on boys in the US
[27:13.760 --> 27:19.640]  and it costs hundreds of dollars per shot hundreds and hundreds what was it
[27:19.640 --> 27:24.520]  get the three shots it's almost $500 but see the Mexican government will fit
[27:24.520 --> 27:29.480]  the bill and then you see the elites obsessed with population reduction and
[27:29.480 --> 27:34.400]  many vaccines have been associated with again loss of fertility particularly
[27:34.400 --> 27:40.760]  when they add a hormone that's needed to complete pregnancy and to there's other
[27:40.760 --> 27:44.680]  hormones they add that are needed to complete being able to have your child
[27:44.680 --> 27:49.200]  and carry it through term that they add to tetanus shots and other vaccines so
[27:49.200 --> 27:54.880]  the body then has an autoimmune response to the hormone that's been bound to the
[27:54.880 --> 27:59.280]  tetanus and now the woman can't have children and the body actually attacks
[27:59.280 --> 28:05.600]  the glands that release that hormone that kicks in in that particular case at
[28:05.600 --> 28:12.080]  the second trimester and causes a 100% spontaneous miscarriage and also causes
[28:12.080 --> 28:14.880]  very serious health problems in the women and if you don't believe me just
[28:14.880 --> 28:19.180]  type in UN caught adding sterilization a hormone to tetanus shots and you'll get
[28:19.180 --> 28:25.320]  mainstream news 96 97 98 you'll get times of India the African different
[28:25.320 --> 28:29.000]  African countries did test and it turned out the UN had a program using over a
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.880]  hundred different companies to produce the vaccines over that decade that was
[28:33.880 --> 28:36.800]  generally the local payoff as they'd come and use that country's vaccine
[28:36.800 --> 28:40.480]  production give them the breakdown about to make it they would produce it so the
[28:40.480 --> 28:45.360]  hormone wasn't added by accident so I'm here to tell you it's not that I'm not
[28:45.360 --> 28:49.440]  saying that some vaccines it was a particularly deadly disease and it was
[28:49.440 --> 28:53.680]  rampant and you take the risk of the vaccine to not get polio or whatever
[28:53.680 --> 28:58.080]  the case is but they're coming out with AIDS vaccines a bowl of vaccines
[28:58.080 --> 29:03.600]  cancer vaccines all of this and you notice cancers off the charts I was on

[35:30.440 --> 35:33.000]  didn't have that authority just like here in the US they don't but it started
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.520]  with Rick Perry saying it was the law and you had to he's now apologized for that
[35:36.520 --> 35:41.200]  and a day late a dollar short a lot of dead girls behind him blue Rockwell called

[36:22.800 --> 36:29.360]  told to stand down and he joins us now to break down the latest geopolitical
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.720]  developments operation darkheart.com is where you can find his latest best-selling
[36:33.720 --> 36:36.680]  book it's so good to have you here with us today Colonel
[36:36.680 --> 36:40.280]  thanks for having me Alex good to be back on leave in a while absolutely so much is
[36:40.280 --> 36:47.280]  happening I've got my questions but out of the gates what what is what B is under
[36:47.280 --> 36:50.560]  your saddle well you know I'm glad you brought up the whole Libya thing and
[36:50.560 --> 36:55.520]  this is one of the peculiar things where I think we are just totally out to
[36:55.520 --> 36:58.640]  lunch and what's really going on I think and then we being the American public
[36:58.640 --> 37:01.840]  for two reasons first I don't know if you're aware of this but there's been a
[37:01.840 --> 37:07.240]  there's a meeting in Paris this week with businesses global businesses and a
[37:07.240 --> 37:12.520]  lot of the Libyan rebels looking at how to carve up the the outcome of the Libyan
[37:12.520 --> 37:15.320]  conflict and keep in mind we don't even have a constitution area yet you've got
[37:15.320 --> 37:18.880]  folks already trying to make business deals with the rebels and of course we
[37:18.880 --> 37:24.000]  don't even know who's doing what so you know when you look at that fact and you
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.200]  look at the fact that we've spent a billion dollars now I know that in terms
[37:27.200 --> 37:31.280]  of the budget it's not significant but you know a billion dollars would go a
[37:31.280 --> 37:35.920]  long way to fix a lot of bridges make a lot of road to then relieve a lot of
[37:35.920 --> 37:40.040]  folks who are having a hard time with the economy right now so this has all
[37:40.040 --> 37:44.920]  been done in the name of the White House and I was just over talking to some
[37:44.920 --> 37:49.560]  some staff some congressional staff on this very issue last week Alex the
[37:49.560 --> 37:54.440]  Congress has never seemed received a single report on what the Pentagon is
[37:54.440 --> 37:57.520]  doing who they're giving the intel to and according to the Pentagon and their
[37:57.520 --> 38:02.120]  most recent reports from last week they have been they have given 70 to 60 to
[38:02.120 --> 38:06.840]  70% of the Intel which has driven the NATO attacks against rebel target or
[38:06.840 --> 38:11.760]  against Gaddafi's targets well who exactly authorized this because Congress
[38:11.760 --> 38:16.120]  never did this and most strikingly and I've been talking to Bruce fine Bruce
[38:16.120 --> 38:20.360]  you might know wrote a lot of books on constitution the Constitution lawyer
[38:20.360 --> 38:25.520]  stated without any any equivocation that the president is now in violation
[38:25.520 --> 38:29.440]  of something called the anti-deficiencies act and that's within
[38:29.440 --> 38:33.200]  order within title 31 of the US code which basically says if Congress gives
[38:33.200 --> 38:36.760]  you money to do something you cannot arbitrarily decide you're going to do
[38:36.760 --> 38:40.640]  something else with it in the case of Libya there's been no obligation or
[38:40.640 --> 38:45.160]  approval of any obligation for funds to go against the Philippine conflict so and
[38:45.160 --> 38:48.360]  no matter who you are right or left we should all be concerned about the fact
[38:48.360 --> 38:53.120]  that there is no interest in following what I think most would argue the rule
[38:53.120 --> 38:59.160]  of law and the constitutional basis that requires you know a give-and-take an
[38:59.160 --> 39:02.680]  oversight system within our government well I'm glad you brought this up
[39:02.680 --> 39:06.760]  Colonel that was actually one of the things I wanted to raise Ron Paul of
[39:06.760 --> 39:09.800]  course is called the constitutional lawyer mr. Fine you know the top
[39:09.800 --> 39:14.640]  constitutional lawyer in the country he's been on this show and said this is
[39:14.640 --> 39:18.160]  impeachable it's completely unconstitutional I know you're still
[39:18.160 --> 39:23.000]  in the military so you obviously can't go that far but when Congress went
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.760]  to Obama four and a half months ago and said look we'll give you the
[39:27.760 --> 39:31.280]  money in the authority but you've got to go to us he said and put a letter out
[39:31.280 --> 39:35.760]  and said I don't need Congress I have the UN and I'm doing this quote for the
[39:35.760 --> 39:39.240]  credibility of the UN and it does add incredible credibility it says our
[39:39.240 --> 39:43.440]  president takes his orders from them I mean the Congress makes wars you know
[39:43.440 --> 39:47.080]  you're a commissioned officer Congress gives the orders the president then
[39:47.080 --> 39:51.600]  executes it as the executive but the board of directors who are elected by us
[39:51.600 --> 39:56.240]  use is the house is the Senate right we now have a super Congress now the
[39:56.240 --> 40:00.360]  spending and cutting bills don't come from house members it just comes from a
[40:00.360 --> 40:04.520]  12-member super committee with the president the 13th head I mean so this
[40:04.520 --> 40:08.240]  is a constitutional crisis and but you just brought something of that I didn't
[40:08.240 --> 40:12.680]  even I saw a blurb but I'd forgotten to cover so I guess for lack of a better
[40:12.680 --> 40:15.440]  term I didn't know because I never covered it you have a tree falls and
[40:15.440 --> 40:20.480]  nobody hears it didn't make a sound and that's that Congress isn't even being
[40:20.480 --> 40:24.200]  given intelligence right on this giant North African operation that's
[40:24.200 --> 40:28.200]  incredible right and I think the American public needs to really take notice of
[40:28.200 --> 40:32.200]  this and again I did the person I talked to is actually his member he works for
[40:32.200 --> 40:36.120]  is a member of the House Armed Service Committee who should be briefed and
[40:36.120 --> 40:40.880]  and this is where there's huge problems and it's not and again like you
[40:40.880 --> 40:43.320]  mentioned Alex it's not like the president wouldn't have gotten
[40:43.320 --> 40:47.640]  authorization or wouldn't have got money he just chose to not not to deal with it
[40:47.640 --> 40:51.160]  and say what I'm doing is not a war now and I think about the logic here that
[40:51.160 --> 40:54.240]  he's using because by by President Obama's logic and the way they're
[40:54.240 --> 40:59.520]  approaching this you could use a nuclear weapon on a country and say I'm not
[40:59.520 --> 41:03.520]  really war because we didn't have boots on the ground so that's how insane the
[41:03.520 --> 41:07.320]  premise of the policy is that you could actually use an incredible amount of
[41:07.320 --> 41:11.160]  deadly force against any given target on the planet and basically say that's not
[41:11.160 --> 41:14.160]  really war because we didn't put boots on the ground well Colonel Colonel this
[41:14.160 --> 41:18.920]  is Caesar crossing the Rubicon that led to the end of the Roman Republic and
[41:18.920 --> 41:23.560]  and Obama's lawyers know exactly what they're doing the Pentagon lawyers as
[41:23.560 --> 41:26.840]  you know came to him and said you can't do this and he said I'll do whatever I
[41:26.840 --> 41:31.040]  want so this is brazen and being consciously done talking to other
[41:31.040 --> 41:38.000]  military brass who you speak with are they concerned about this yeah the whole
[41:38.000 --> 41:43.440]  I've spoken to several retired generals who have worked in a variety of
[41:43.440 --> 41:47.760]  administrations and and you might find this this ironic but one of the
[41:47.760 --> 41:52.400]  administrations which I was told had that the greatest interest in listening
[41:52.400 --> 41:55.920]  to generals was actually President Clinton Clinton would actually bring
[41:55.920 --> 41:59.400]  folks in and talk to them that they disagreed with policy from what I'm
[41:59.400 --> 42:05.160]  hearing Alex that's not going on now it essentially is a send mode only it
[42:05.160 --> 42:08.600]  basically you take the policy you try to figure it out and you move forward with
[42:08.600 --> 42:11.760]  it that's about it and if you have concerns then the concerns are really
[42:11.760 --> 42:16.280]  not welcome and this is a dangerous trend because we as officers are trained
[42:16.280 --> 42:20.040]  to give our best judgment and if it's in it and if our judgment is it's not a
[42:20.040 --> 42:23.400]  good idea we need to be able to tell you that and we're not telling you that to
[42:23.400 --> 42:26.040]  be disloyal we're telling you because there's reasons why you need to be
[42:26.040 --> 42:32.960]  cautious well it's more than dangerous it is absolute 100% tyranny it is 200
[42:32.960 --> 42:39.720]  proof evil and if a president's crazy and doesn't want to listen to the
[42:39.720 --> 42:42.840]  military that's one thing is the commander in chief but he's only the
[42:42.840 --> 42:46.960]  commander in chief once Congress gives him the green light to execute their
[42:46.960 --> 42:51.400]  declaration of war or their authorization to use force as you know so this is
[42:51.400 --> 42:55.840]  this is a complete departure from the Constitution and we're seeing it on the
[42:55.840 --> 42:59.440]  power of the purse we're seeing them implement gun control regulations
[42:59.440 --> 43:04.400]  outside of law we're seeing it done with carbon taxes with power plants we're
[43:04.400 --> 43:08.560]  seeing a health care law selectively enforced this for all intents and
[43:08.560 --> 43:13.540]  purposes has transitioned into what you could call a dictatorship a stealth
[43:13.540 --> 43:20.080]  dictatorship but nonetheless a dictatorship as you mentioned Alex
[43:20.080 --> 43:22.720]  there's ways there's things in the American public domain that they can see
[43:22.720 --> 43:26.640]  this first off and I don't care how you feel about the the the Protection of
[43:26.640 --> 43:32.200]  Marriage Act but the idea is if it's a law I'd say the Justice Department is
[43:32.200 --> 43:35.800]  obligated to enforce that law to include going and fighting for it in court
[43:35.800 --> 43:39.520]  that's one of the things that the Obama administration just said you know we
[43:39.520 --> 43:43.240]  don't like this we're not going to enforce it on the military side your
[43:43.240 --> 43:47.080]  points are super well taken I've spoken I don't know if you all knew that you do
[43:47.080 --> 43:51.400]  this I debated that representative Paul on the John Stossel show about two
[43:51.400 --> 43:55.560]  about three months ago and four months ago in March and we talked about a lot
[43:55.560 --> 43:59.640]  of these same issues and he and I agree on a great number of issues and one of
[43:59.640 --> 44:03.880]  which is the constitutionality the need of Congress to actually do its risk
[44:03.880 --> 44:07.440]  its duties and the two things that Congress must do especially the house
[44:07.440 --> 44:11.120]  only the house can can do the appropriate basically put together bills
[44:11.120 --> 44:14.520]  which appropriate money at the spending bills begin in the house it's long and
[44:14.520 --> 44:17.160]  it's got it's got to stay like that the whole idea of a super committee and I've
[44:17.160 --> 44:20.200]  heard the representative Paul say this he doesn't see whether there's any legal
[44:20.200 --> 44:23.680]  constitutional grounds for the super committee to exist and I gotta tell you
[44:23.680 --> 44:26.560]  I've talked to Bruce Fine Bruce does the same thing it's just there's just
[44:26.560 --> 44:31.720]  nothing there that allows us to happen and the other point obviously is whenever
[44:31.720 --> 44:36.040]  you spend money you've got to have clear and compelling justification to do that
[44:36.040 --> 44:41.080]  and I just don't think we're getting our money's worth regarding that and when
[44:41.080 --> 44:44.040]  we look at this Alice one of the things I'd like to bring up as an oversight
[44:44.040 --> 44:47.640]  issue is the fact that anytime and let's look at this from the mic mark the
[44:47.640 --> 44:52.720]  mic the mic I'm sorry the macro to the micro and our big scheme of things we
[44:52.720 --> 44:58.520]  use military force deadly force all the time as a tool of national will and when
[44:58.520 --> 45:03.360]  you look at the micro when you look at a policeman on the street having to do
[45:03.360 --> 45:07.400]  something to support a law anytime he uses deadly force there's an
[45:07.400 --> 45:11.400]  investigation there's there's basically every full review process that says was
[45:11.400 --> 45:15.680]  this officer justified in using military you know deadly force well the
[45:15.680 --> 45:20.480]  problem is we never look at the national equivalent of an officer using deadly
[45:20.480 --> 45:24.760]  force we constantly use military operations military capabilities
[45:24.760 --> 45:30.080]  without understanding three things first was it legal was it was it the right
[45:30.080 --> 45:34.440]  call to make based on the intel I think we would all agree that despite what
[45:34.440 --> 45:37.840]  president vice president cheney says now I don't believe the Intel was ever
[45:37.840 --> 45:40.960]  there to justify an Iraqi invasion that's the message and I was on the
[45:40.960 --> 45:44.480]  inside of the time I this stuff they're talking about now I never saw I didn't
[45:44.480 --> 45:48.440]  Saddam Hussein was never quote-unquote a proliferator of weapons he may have been
[45:48.440 --> 45:51.120]  interested or interested in but he wasn't proliferating so you got to look at
[45:51.120 --> 45:54.600]  the Intel second thing you got to figure out that if the Intel justified
[45:54.600 --> 45:58.920]  your actions did you did you create the appropriate response to the threat and
[45:58.920 --> 46:03.480]  third and most importantly what is the outcome did did it did your use of
[46:03.480 --> 46:08.040]  military force achieve a specific goal or objective that is in the best interest
[46:08.040 --> 46:13.440]  of our nation's policy if I you know is this what we should do and and so if
[46:13.440 --> 46:17.040]  it's good enough for a copy cop to be looked at with a great deal scrutiny for
[46:17.040 --> 46:21.280]  use of deadly force I don't know why we don't do it at the national level well
[46:21.280 --> 46:25.440]  continuing it's always in every case in history as you know as a military
[46:25.440 --> 46:30.480]  officer who studied history and when leaders start amassing all the power
[46:30.480 --> 46:34.840]  into themselves especially the power of the purse and the power of force that is
[46:34.840 --> 46:39.760]  when the big alarms go off and and I'll just say it if you read the definition
[46:39.760 --> 46:45.160]  of treason and then high treason it is working with a foreign power to undermine
[46:45.160 --> 46:52.120]  the system of government of the nation of which you serve and and that's the
[46:52.120 --> 46:56.400]  basic definition of of not just treason but high treason because high treason is
[46:56.400 --> 47:01.360]  if you're in a position of power and trust and if sworn an oath and you lower
[47:01.360 --> 47:06.360]  the drawbridge for the enemy to come in now Obama says to Congress when they
[47:06.360 --> 47:10.000]  sue him when they were buffing when everything and when they offer him the
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.320]  money in the power when it's because that's their you know their job he says
[47:14.320 --> 47:18.080]  I don't need you puts a letter out saying I do this for the credibility of the
[47:18.080 --> 47:24.920]  UN I'm sorry that is not only treason it is the definition of high treason to
[47:24.920 --> 47:31.360]  undermine the the legitimate government and transfer the power through fraud to
[47:31.360 --> 47:37.880]  a foreign entity away from the elected government of the Republic as you said
[47:37.880 --> 47:41.520]  he could use nuclear weapons now and say the UN told him to there I mean I mean
[47:41.520 --> 47:45.200]  it's even worse if he was power grabbing he would still be an American
[47:45.200 --> 47:49.080]  dictator and that it would be it would be treasonous now he's doing it and saying
[47:49.080 --> 47:53.680]  I do it under a foreign entities auspices if this is not high treason
[47:53.680 --> 47:56.840]  nothing is well I have to think that I have heard several of the congressmen
[47:56.840 --> 48:01.240]  talk about the issues representative Kacinich has talked about this and as
[48:01.240 --> 48:06.400]  you you know several congressmen have actually sued president Obama over the
[48:06.400 --> 48:10.240]  very issue you're talking about there's now court action saying president Obama
[48:10.240 --> 48:14.440]  has failed to to support the requirements of his office relating to war
[48:14.440 --> 48:19.040]  powers and and things of that nature so what I'm concerned about is that the
[48:19.040 --> 48:22.440]  American public doesn't seem to be looking at this with any any sort of
[48:22.440 --> 48:28.000]  fervor I mean the fact that we have it I don't care how they argue the fact that
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.000]  we've only got aircraft involved and frankly between you and me I Alex I've
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.840]  heard that we've got guys on the ground doing things to support I've talked to
[48:35.840 --> 48:41.200]  the Army soldiers by name there's at least 50 dead U.S. Army alone that have
[48:41.200 --> 48:44.400]  been brought into the receiving center in the last four and a half months their
[48:44.400 --> 48:49.560]  special forces all over the place commanding right the the the jihadis
[48:49.560 --> 48:53.280]  and so this is the deal I don't understand why the American people are
[48:53.280 --> 48:56.320]  the only ones who are being kind of kept in the dark here I mean everybody you
[48:56.320 --> 48:59.840]  know one of my sources was a foreign national who told me about boots on the
[48:59.840 --> 49:03.560]  ground being there and Libya now imagine this a foreign national a former
[49:03.560 --> 49:07.880]  Libyan senior official tells me that he knows we got boots on the ground so
[49:07.880 --> 49:10.880]  apparently the jokes of the American people because they're the only ones who
[49:10.880 --> 49:14.840]  are not being told the full truth about what's going on and again you know I you
[49:14.840 --> 49:20.080]  could have we should have a debate about any use of our our national
[49:20.080 --> 49:24.440]  capabilities that be that military be that the State Department I mean yes
[49:24.440 --> 49:26.720]  we're letting in erupting and just get right to the heart of matters I want to
[49:26.720 --> 49:29.440]  come back and hit a few other issues with you but I'm glad you brought this up
[49:29.440 --> 49:34.600]  I understand you're a commissioned officer you still serve and and so
[49:34.600 --> 49:38.280]  obviously you're not going to say it's treason or high treason but you come
[49:38.280 --> 49:40.800]  back and say it's up to the American people to wake up and start having a
[49:40.800 --> 49:43.920]  debate about this I don't hear you disagreeing I just want listeners
[49:43.920 --> 49:47.720]  understand if this is happening in plain view and if the government gets away
[49:47.720 --> 49:52.120]  with this if the executive gets away with this then the sky is the limit your
[49:52.120 --> 49:57.080]  comment absolutely I mean this is we've seen this on several issues relating to
[49:57.080 --> 50:01.800]  how the government is amassing power and in this case the executive branch
[50:01.800 --> 50:07.600]  primarily at the center of this Congress has to be the thing that says
[50:07.600 --> 50:12.920]  enough is enough and this is where I can I just don't understand how we don't
[50:12.920 --> 50:16.960]  have a Congress actually drawing the line in the same thing this far if you go
[50:16.960 --> 50:20.600]  this far we're gonna have to do something to impede on to me this is far

[54:33.680 --> 54:38.460]  is the headline man faces life in prison for recording police and what's
[54:38.460 --> 54:43.400]  scary about this talk about lawlessness 12 states now will put you in jail or
[54:43.400 --> 54:48.160]  attempt to give you film police in public even at a city council meeting and
[54:48.160 --> 54:52.440]  that's in the news report he's facing life in prison and the prosecutor and
[54:52.440 --> 54:56.760]  people said we want to teach people a lesson now understand this is not
[54:56.760 --> 55:01.120]  wiretapping this is not what the statute says but people have been sent to jail
[55:01.120 --> 55:05.960]  for this most of these get thrown out but in 12 states the cops don't care they
[55:05.960 --> 55:10.620]  will waste taxpayer money and ruin somebody's life just to try to create a
[55:10.620 --> 55:14.400]  chilling effect so people won't videotape police and that is bonafide
[55:14.400 --> 55:19.520]  naked tyranny at its worst right there so we're gonna be breaking that down more
[55:19.520 --> 55:23.760]  in the next hour lieutenant colonel Anthony Schaefer best-selling author
[55:23.760 --> 55:27.800]  researcher led the big unit that could have killed bin Laden you've seen those
[55:27.800 --> 55:33.280]  reports it's confirmed 10 years ago before 9-11 and here he is today and
[55:33.280 --> 55:36.840]  of course he exposed able danger and so much more has a lot of courage and he
[55:36.840 --> 55:40.600]  says we can say here on air but you heard him earlier getting into the
[55:40.600 --> 55:47.120]  power grab that's happening let's talk about these reports in Asia times LA
[55:47.120 --> 55:53.920]  times how Al Qaeda got to rule Tripoli his name is Abdel Hakim Belhaj and he
[55:53.920 --> 56:01.520]  reportedly brags and his cohorts brag that they've been in Iraq and that it's
[56:01.520 --> 56:05.680]  confirmed that they are Al Qaeda assets and it's not just a contingent that the
[56:05.680 --> 56:10.160]  main group now getting funding and being protected in the majority of the
[56:10.160 --> 56:14.320]  areas they've taken that the main group that's emerging as who is going to lead
[56:14.320 --> 56:19.960]  the government and in a test would not offer to give back the guy that bombed
[56:19.960 --> 56:23.720]  the Pan Am plane who lied about dying of cancer and obviously it isn't dead I
[56:23.720 --> 56:26.680]  mean that's another big symbol they said they're bringing in Sharia law the
[56:26.680 --> 56:30.560]  bags are going back on the heads the same things happening in Egypt they're
[56:30.560 --> 56:34.400]  gonna kick out a sod put G hotties in I mean what's going on here colonel I
[56:34.400 --> 56:38.560]  think we we have been dealing with the situation with a great deal of naive
[56:38.560 --> 56:42.720]  Dave I think I this story you're talking about regarding the Al Qaeda guys this
[56:42.720 --> 56:46.320]  has been mainstream media I mean I know Fox covered the fact that these guys had
[56:46.320 --> 56:50.240]  clear and direct links with Al Qaeda so I'm not quite sure again what what we're
[56:50.240 --> 56:55.280]  missing here and several folks to include folks on the hill took to task
[56:55.280 --> 56:59.840]  Senator McCain when he went over there and said these guys are all right by me
[56:59.840 --> 57:03.160]  if it just doesn't make sense the other thing about you have to understand
[57:03.160 --> 57:07.760]  about this Alex is these guys Al Qaeda guys are very persistent they have a
[57:07.760 --> 57:11.040]  plan it out of a viewer saw the old battle battles from the new battles for
[57:11.040 --> 57:14.320]  Galactica reimagined you know it's kind of like the pylons they got a plan to
[57:14.320 --> 57:18.680]  move in forward with them they're not going to stop but here's the issue give
[57:18.680 --> 57:22.680]  them Afghanistan after the end of the Soviet deal now give them Libby and all
[57:22.680 --> 57:27.400]  that money what why this is where we have to be smarter about how we use our
[57:27.400 --> 57:30.960]  resources we can't be everywhere constantly therefore we have to be very
[57:30.960 --> 57:33.720]  careful about how we deal with this we don't have to be physically everywhere
[57:33.720 --> 57:38.120]  to deal with I know but the colonel look the panic that you say doesn't make
[57:38.120 --> 57:41.400]  sense use them against the Soviets use them against the Serbs use them to take
[57:41.400 --> 57:44.560]  our liberties here at home it actually makes perfect sense they've got to give
[57:44.560 --> 57:49.160]  Al Qaeda a new base and so they can blow them up in five years I don't know
[57:49.160 --> 57:53.200]  about that I'm not sure if not into that strategy but I do know that we've been
[57:53.200 --> 57:57.320]  ignoring things which are obvious and one of the things we didn't take into
[57:57.320 --> 58:01.920]  account with Iraq is that Iraq turned out to be a hugely successful training
[58:01.920 --> 58:05.520]  ground for Al Qaeda yeah we we need to roll them back a little bit but first
[58:05.520 --> 58:08.280]  you know one of the things about Iraq we haven't won there yet I don't think
[58:08.280 --> 58:11.760]  people understand that is still a major comment but that's what you just you
[58:11.760 --> 58:14.960]  know you're right for those that don't know most of these jihadis that are
[58:14.960 --> 58:18.600]  admitted Al Qaeda are veterans of eight years in Iraq right and they make
[58:18.600 --> 58:23.720]  comments like I hate Americans but I also hate Qaddafi what is this well you
[58:23.720 --> 58:27.160]  know the West hates Qaddafi so much they're gonna give Libya to Al Qaeda
[58:27.160 --> 58:31.040]  stay there back in one minute search you can really flesh this out for us but I
[58:31.040 --> 58:34.600]  mean I've got to give my rights up because Al Qaeda is hiding under my table
[58:34.600 --> 58:37.960]  but then meanwhile I got to hear about Al Qaeda or freedom fighters we'll be right
[58:37.960 --> 58:40.240]  back
[58:42.360 --> 58:48.840]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:51.080 --> 58:55.880]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[58:55.880 --> 59:01.400]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[59:01.400 --> 59:04.880]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in
[59:04.880 --> 59:09.480]  this influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[59:09.480 --> 59:14.760]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[59:14.760 --> 59:19.320]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[59:19.320 --> 59:24.000]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.040]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[59:28.040 --> 59:31.720]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[59:31.720 --> 59:36.760]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[59:36.760 --> 59:42.880]  a fall of the Republic get your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at info
[59:42.880 --> 59:48.320]  wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet
[59:48.320 --> 01:00:05.400]  dot TV. Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Big
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:12.240]  brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:19.760]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:27.080]  Alex Jones. He's the author of Operation Darkheart excellent book some of it got
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.200]  excised by the Pentagon I don't want you reading it. Lieutenant Colonel Anthony
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.520]  Schaefer during the one-minute break he was getting into look how fast triple he
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.000]  fell US troops involved we're in the dark. Wolfowitz is the engineer of this
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.360]  you got the floor in the last five minutes Colonel take it away. One of my
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.680]  credible sources tell me all back that the real the real power that pushed us
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.000]  into this conflict was with two notable figures one was the Samantha Powers one
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.960]  of the notable advisors to President Obama and then also a shadowy figure
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.440]  which I was kind of surprised to hear about but I when you look at it I guess
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.920]  it makes perfect sense as Paul Wolfowitz apparently the two of them got
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:06.480]  together did a memo which basically said hey we need to do something here and I
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.720]  think most folks understood going in that the humanitarian guys for the whole
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:15.000]  thing was a total sham and so when you look at it and then you think that for
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.480]  your audience to consider here is you know we've been watching this war for
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:22.400]  months and you know we've been seeing these rebels who can barely even you
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.840]  know shoot naked 47 the right way without you know killing themselves and
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:32.480]  and all of a sudden they grow efficiency and are able to storm
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.760]  triply and take it over so what's wrong with this picture I mean if you guys can
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.880]  see some of this in the shadows of the press if you look at look at it very
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:44.840]  carefully there's been a rumor now that certain special operations units of
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:49.760]  both the British and possibly US were actually advised these guys helping him
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.560]  to organize so when you look on the face of it you really do come to see that
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.240]  there's no way the rebels could have self-organized moved in rapidly and
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.200]  taken over the size of the city the complex with the complexity of
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:05.440]  the triply without some level of help and so again this is where I'm concerned
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.680]  I think everybody well sir it's now confirmed that a whole bunch of special
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.800]  forces from other Arab nations the French the British the US the night
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.680]  landing and there's been videos and photos released of Anglos up there
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:23.360]  firing anti-tank guns and other systems so there's now no doubt that they were
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:30.000]  used there yeah well I think we've got to be smarter and I mean I don't know why
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  we're not thinking this through and maybe we're not maybe we're focusing on
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.960]  thinking this or maybe there's something I don't understand but from a military
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.920]  perspective from looking at the situation from a military perspective
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:43.280]  there's two key things first if we really wanted to get this done we should
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.880]  have done it and in a month with one armored brigade going and cutting through
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.040]  and being done and frankly we would have killed less of it would have died by a
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.040]  stake in taking direct action if you if you go in and then this goes to the
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:57.360]  Colin Powell comment that the George Bush if you break it you own it or we broke
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.640]  it and we're not willing to own up to the fact that we've made we've made
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.160]  situation bad secondly and more importantly Alex is the fact that we
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:07.440]  really don't know what's going to happen next and sometimes I hate to say this
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.280]  and so our friends may get on me for this but sometimes a devil you know is
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.800]  actually better than the devil you don't Gaddafi was a lot of things but if
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.120]  nothing else he kind of stayed out of the world the world's way he did gave
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.640]  goofy long speeches of the UN but for the most part he kind of knew what you
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.640]  were dealing with well he'd also rolled over seven years ago gave up the WMDs
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:32.200]  started investing his money in Western banks this sends a signal you come out
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.160]  of the cold we're going to betray you right and this is where I think this
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.320]  and of course we we ignore the fact that it and we should we should have done
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.480]  something years ago if we're going to do something against him based on the
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.680]  things he did regarding Walker be in the bombings of the disco bombings in
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.960]  Germany what I said we waited all this time and now all of a sudden we're upset with
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.120]  him it doesn't pass the common sense test and this is where I think there's
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.880]  some other things that the American people need to be demanding that Congress
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.080]  look into this this this screams for investigation Alex it really does well
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:03.680]  now you talk about you break it you own it they admit most the country no power
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.640]  water right and it's a big population that was you know living in the
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:12.840]  industrialized system and reportedly it is descending into it a humanitarian
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:17.440]  nightmare the very thing they claim the war was for exactly that I said that I
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.480]  said that a week ago on one of the programs on cable I said we will see a
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.840]  key at descending the chaos because no one's really in charge and because of

[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.600]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.840]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:16.120]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:20.480]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.560]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:29.080]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:33.240]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:37.200]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:24.520]  okay Ron Paul is scheduled later in the hour we were gonna get Bernard von
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:29.160]  Notaus on in the next hour that we're able to get him now so we've got him and
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:34.560]  then in the third hour I'm going to get into forced Gardasil shots coming to
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:40.280]  Mexico and all the carnage that it's left in its wake here in the US we're
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:44.040]  also gonna get into Rick Perry it's now emerging was a big Hillary care supporter
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:48.880]  and gave speeches and wrote letters and said oh yes we must have socialism so
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.520]  that means mainline Republicans there's nothing more they love than getting
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.960]  getting conned so they're gonna line up for that big time of course they can
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.440]  vote for Obamacare Mitt Romney they'll probably they like that too the worst
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:04.120]  the candidate and the more they lie to them they just love it so we're gonna be
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:10.520]  talking about that as well coming up with Ron Paul also continuing here with
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:15.400]  the news we're gonna look at what's happening in the economy a jam-pack
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:18.360]  transmission
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:29.880]  lined up for you today now six months ago Bernard von Notaus who for decades
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:36.720]  ran the Royal Hawaiian Mint and who also then 14 years ago or 14 plus now set up
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:43.800]  the Liberty dollar and it's an open silver and gold back system that does
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:48.800]  not masquerade as a federal reserve note or the defunct US dollar haven't had
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:53.280]  that since the fellow reserve took over except for a brief time when JFK reissued
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.960]  greenbacks five billion dollars of them he was going to issue 50 billion it says
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:02.560]  US note has a red stamp on it his five dollar bills can find him in any coin
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:07.320]  shop usually for about 10 15 bucks you won't actually see the last time we had
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:11.880]  actual dollars in this country was 1963 and you know the bankers didn't like
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.800]  that too much so he issued silver and gold rounds or coins there are hundreds
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:21.400]  of companies out there over the years thousands that have commissioned coins at
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:26.920]  different mints I mean there's Ron Paul coins there's university coins there's
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:32.080]  military coins you see the ads constantly I mean my entire life on TV
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.560]  especially on you know Saturday and Sunday you see coin ads up there from
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:42.480]  this meant or that meant or companies find a sunken ship with 10,000 ounces
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.720]  of silver and they strike them into new coins with the with the image of the ship
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:51.440]  on it I mean you see those ads I mean I've ordered them myself and when they
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.440]  convicted him because of a pet jury and by the way they're convicted people of
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.480]  film and police in public it's not easy dropping and later courts overthrow it
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:04.960]  but they can get juries to to to send a child to the gas chamber for or not
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.760]  brushing their teeth I mean they can get a jury because of these prosecutors
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:13.640]  play on their ignorance to do anything and 98% of people are convicted in
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.800]  federal federal court because these are kept juries they don't really rotate
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.440]  it's just one group of normally criminals that sit on them so it might not
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:26.280]  have been ignorance they allow informants to come in and lie knowingly I
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:33.800]  mean it's very dangerous so Bernard Von Knowhouse didn't take it like a joke
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.320]  he said this is ridiculous I'm not worried he went in they convicted him
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:41.760]  even the AP's own analysis we're going to him the day after it said this is
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.920]  crazy we've checked the law this isn't counterfeiting federal reserve notes or
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:49.240]  anything it's silver and gold coins there's all these other companies and in
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:54.080]  their statement they said this is the FBI Charlotte division from the US
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.520]  attorney it says attempts to undermine legitimate currency of this country it's
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:02.280]  what the Federal Reserve's done are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:06.800]  well that's what the Federal Reserve is yeah terrorist US Attorney Tomkins said
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.280]  in an announcing the verdict while these forms of anti-government activities
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:13.840]  do not involve violence they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:17.640]  and present danger to the economic stability of our country she added we
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.680]  are determined to meet these threats through infiltration disruption and
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:26.000]  dismantling of organizations which seek to challenge the legitimacy of our
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.920]  democratic form of government or democratic now the this is what I've
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:37.800]  got Mr. Knowhouse on about I wanted to fill you in now the secret service has
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:42.160]  announced and and and coin world is an ad has reported on it so as info wars
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:47.800]  com feds may seize liberty dollars that yes the coins are illegal to even hold
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.480]  even if it's for educational purposes just like I they're now saying Gibson
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:56.760]  guitars or any other wooden furniture firearms that could have now be an
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.800]  endangered tree if you can't prove when you bought it they're gonna start
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:06.560]  swat teaming you and it's beginning so gold silver coins wood firearms wooden
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:11.080]  guitars I mean it's on thousands of arrests or raids dozens of times I've
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:15.480]  seen when they've arrested people selling lemonade Amish being raided the
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:20.120]  people being arrested or fine for having garage sales it's on you don't have
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:25.120]  gardens in your yard it's on it's on the depressions here and you are not going
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.640]  to be self-sufficient you're not going to have an alternative currency but the
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.560]  good news is they may have hurt this guy and made him a martyr for now but like
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:39.360]  a phoenix seven states have passed or passing laws to bring in silver so this
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:44.880]  idea it's time has come and no army can stop it and so we are joined by Bernard
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.160]  von Notal sir thank you so much for joining us Alex it's always a pleasure
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.440]  to visit with you well tell us about how you've been doing waiting for
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.600]  sentencing six months from their lordships and their kangaroo imperial
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.520]  court and what you make of their statement that your coins themselves are
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:09.960]  are our counterfeit well I've been I've been holding up pretty well Alex even
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:14.400]  though it's been almost a half a year since I was convicted and I still don't
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:19.080]  know when I'm going to be sent which is probably still months away but you know
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:25.040]  I've been wiling away working on my pet projects but I am particularly incensed
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:31.800]  and alarmed by the recent article that coin world just announced that Liberty
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:36.960]  dollars may be subject to seizure this is a gross expansion on a part of the
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:43.160]  government and I don't think they really realize what they're sticking their
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:48.360]  male member female member into quite frankly right now you know and what and
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:54.280]  by that you're here this is the they're ruling their statement their kangaroo
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:03.640]  largesse their administrative law which you know does come out of the well the
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.680]  end that you don't eat with they are saying that all gold and silver is
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:14.080]  illegal well no they're just saying Liberty dollars may be seized now no I
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:17.840]  know but the way they've written it saying silver and gold coins are
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:21.160]  counterfeit that could be expanded out into everything the way I read it it's
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:26.640]  very dangerous well I I can I agree that it's dangerous but they're not saying
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.400]  that gold and silver coins because after all the United States meant makes gold
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:35.320]  and silver coin now no but I but but they're saying your coins could be
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:39.960]  subject to seizure that sets the precedent for all of them well it's a
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:44.560]  dangerous slope I forgive you that Alex but you know the Liberty dollar was
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:50.720]  unique in its design its mission everything about the Liberty dollar and
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:56.600]  it was also unique this article by coin world came out at exactly the same time
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:01.640]  that I was actually in Charlotte appearing in court asking for an
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:06.680]  extension to find an attorney to represent me during my sentencing hearing
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:12.080]  so well a lot of interesting things the biggest part here Alex and the reason I
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.600]  see the government doesn't understand the implications of what they're saying
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:23.000]  is is that when they when they raided sunshine they confiscated Liberty dollars
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:31.200]  they seized 170,000 ounces of silver that's a shitpot full of silver Alex
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:37.760]  that's a lot of silver but in reality because the vast majority of Liberty
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:43.560]  dollar supporters did not trust the government it did not believe that the
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:49.920]  government wouldn't come in and fees the property 90% of all Liberty dollars
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:57.800]  were never we're in species form we're we fill people's orders so that means
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:05.640]  that the 170,000 that they sees is only 10% okay and the vast majority of the
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:12.920]  1.7 million Liberty dollars are out there in circulation in millions of
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:17.280]  people's hands I mean this is why the distribute when you think about 1.7
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.080]  million ounces that doesn't take into consideration the fractional because we
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:28.080]  had halves and quarters and two-fifths one-fifths one-twentieth so I would
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:34.120]  gather Alex that there is probably about two million at least two million
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:38.440]  Liberty dollars that are out there floating around so if they're going to
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:42.400]  go out there and start trying to collect that wow they're really going to have
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.560]  their job cut out for now well you know they don't care they don't have to
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.280]  arrest every Amish farmer they don't have to arrest every lemon-stayed owner
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:56.600]  they like again it's about doing brazen crazy things to just get us to accept
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:01.800]  that well my pimp beats me put cigarettes out on me I mean this is this is
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:08.320]  about exercising their will on us this is about hiking their leg on us well I
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:13.160]  I certainly agree with you there Alex that they're used gross intimidating
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:18.640]  tactics okay but the thing is is what they're already doing is driving the
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.760]  price of Liberty dollars even higher than what they were on eBay and other
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:29.040]  different sites that handle Liberty dollars I got a report from one of our
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:36.400]  supporters who said that he saw a 1l copper on eBay for $70 for Pete's
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:42.200]  takes Alex it's astronomical what Liberty dollars are going for and we were
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.280]  just trying to help the government find their way to issue a value-based
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:50.520]  currency well my question is if they say you're counterfeiting are they going to
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:55.840]  go after the seven states that are starting to issue silver well the state
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:00.040]  have a long ways to go before they get to that point to be honest with you
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:06.720]  Alex and if Nevada is any example when they took it to the attorney general
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:11.560]  when when the state's people in Nevada took it to their attorney general he
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:18.040]  immediately poof poof the whole thing and it cost and it suddenly died yes
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.560]  there's a lot of rhetoric about states rights issuing something like this but
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:28.000]  states cannot issue any gold and silver coins that's there they're specifically
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.160]  barred from that from the Constitution now could they go to a third party could
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.800]  they allow a different currency to be used could they accept a golden silver
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.760]  currency to be used to pay taxes yes they could do that I mean after all they
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:44.680]  are using those dreaded depreciating federal reserve though
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:48.640]  Bernard von Note house stay there I want to come back and talk about your case

[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:26.040]  Bernard Vaughn note house is our guest what do you think of the way that this
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:30.040]  blew up in their face I mean even mainstream media said it was crazy that
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:35.480]  you were convicted for minting silver and gold coins and criticizing the
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:41.840]  Federal Reserve I mean you you clearly were not masquerading as their masquerading
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:47.000]  counterfeit currency well that's an understatement Alex I'm certainly not
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.560]  been masquerading you know I was on tour for 12 years speaking all across the
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.880]  United States there's a lot of different events in terms of providing a
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:02.280]  solution to the government I thought that we were being helpful to the
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:07.120]  government because obviously they lost their way they had their head up in a
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:12.320]  dark foul spot place and that they needed some assistance so I thought the
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:16.600]  Liberty dollar was going to be well-received and actually Alex to be
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:21.280]  honest with you it was very well received by the government for the first
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:27.680]  let's see seven or eight years I mean a lot of prominent government officials
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.560]  replied to the government that the Liberty dollar was legal I appeared on
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:37.320]  the learning channel special along with the Federal Reserve and US Mint and
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:42.160]  Department of Bureau and printing and so I mean it was no secret about what I
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:47.200]  was doing Alex but evidently they really got their nose out of joint somewhere
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:53.880]  between April the 18th when coin world ran an article saying that Liberty
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:26:00.120]  dollars were legal to collect and that came directly from the Department of
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:08.360]  Treasury and tell like yesterday when they issued that new article from
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:14.400]  coin world saying that Liberty dollars may be confiscated is amazing turn of
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:18.520]  events here Alex so it looks like they're trying to get their federal
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:22.600]  regulations in line with your fake conviction because now they realize
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:26.720]  wow we convicted somebody on something that isn't illegal so they think I
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.840]  guess retroactively they could have the Treasury flip-flop and say well we said
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:35.080]  you could have these but now you can't and so you're convicted of something
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:40.880]  that wasn't yet their regulation yeah I mean you know a government flip-flopping
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:46.600]  is nothing new Alex you know these are people that you can't cross that's
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.840]  why we have these nice adjectives to describe our favorite government you
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.880]  know there's no doubt about that but the thing is is that they're putting a lot
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:27:00.240]  of people at risk right now because as I mentioned there's somewhere around two
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:04.480]  million Liberty dollar pieces out there and I'm not talking about the paper
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:10.440]  certificate I'm just talking about in gold silver and platinum species form so
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:13.960]  I don't know where the government's gonna go with this the latest word in coin
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:18.520]  world when they contacted the Secret Service was well we'll get back to you
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:23.280]  in a few weeks in other words they're gonna think what the hell is going on
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:27.560]  here and hopefully they'll come to their senses and they'll realize that there
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:33.440]  was nothing illegal about the Liberty dollar well the word is because you also
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:38.000]  had the paper currency redeemable in gold and silver and copper that they
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.120]  wanted to raid and hope that you didn't have the reserves versus the paper you
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:45.480]  had out there that's actually what the fellow reserve does for every dollar
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:49.480]  gets put in a bank they can loan out 10 but unfortunately you actually had the
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:54.280]  reserves and more and so they had to make something else up on you where is
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:28:00.400]  all that gold and silver now well we almost had the government bring that
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:06.040]  into court of course we're talking about nine tons Alex of gold
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:12.320]  which is a huge pile but unfortunately when the when the judge found out that
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:18.120]  it's being stored in Texas and we were in North Carolina he said well that's a
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:24.160]  long ways to go just to see the big pile of gold and silver you know so they
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:29.840]  talked about getting videos of it and this and that and that never materialized
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:35.080]  but along the short of it is Alex is yes we did have a hundred percent backing
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:39.720]  we actually had more silver they confiscated though I don't know 30 or
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:45.280]  40 extra thousand ounces on top of the silver that they confiscated that are
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:49.320]  backing up the certificates now remember the certificates are not illegal the
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:53.280]  government has acknowledged in writing at the United Statesman has acknowledged
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:58.000]  in writing that the certificates are not illegal so the people who have the
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.520]  certificates still have a barf I claim even after I go to jail or go to prison
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:11.400]  a barf I claim to recover the the least of value if not the gold and silver if
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:17.320]  those are still classified as contraband so they wouldn't be returned but the
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:21.840]  government would have to give you fair market value for everything that you're
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.320]  holding in the either the paper or digital liberty dollar certificate

[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:25.400]  into it congressman what do you make of the super congress and the fact that
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:32.840]  congress was not able to even be involved in the Libya operation well of
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:38.760]  course to me it's an outrage first super congress is some some new fangled
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:42.560]  invention by the people who couldn't solve the problems up there and weren't
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:45.880]  willing to cut anything so they're just going to pick 12 people who are supposed
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:50.480]  to you know pick out the things to really cut so I have no confidence that
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:54.680]  they'll achieve anything and even if they did it be risky because why should we
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:58.160]  turn the whole Congress over to 12 individuals to make these decisions so
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.800]  I don't anticipate that they're going to come up with a solution if they did
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:07.880]  they'll probably be raising taxes and they probably won't cut any money away
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:12.360]  from some some of this militarism going on there they haven't even been brave
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:17.000]  enough to cut the money from Libya so I don't expect a whole lot to happen from
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:23.280]  that super congress congressman is there any recourse with Obama telling
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:28.120]  Congress I don't need your authority to go to war in Libya I have the UN giving
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.320]  me of the authority and I quote do this for their credibility I mean it are we
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:35.480]  just gonna I guess sit here collectively I mean I know you've been
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:40.480]  fighting it and just allow the power of the person the power of war to more and
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:45.120]  more move to the executive I'm afraid that people aren't going to demand it
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:49.240]  and the Congress won't respond and there's a few of us you know the file
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:53.720]  sued and we try to fight it and vote against the funding but we never get the
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:58.600]  majority but you know it's not like it's brand new I know this is an outrage
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:02.640]  but you know it's pretty much what's been going on since Truman Truman actually
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:08.200]  you know did that on Korea and of course we still are spending money on Korea so
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.920]  on at that time they would come a president would come and get token
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.960]  approval they never get a declaration of war it's just a token approval to do
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:19.920]  what I want if I want to fight a war I can and Congress is expected to finance
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:25.680]  it so we've we've given up a lot over the last hundred years and I think the
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:31.400]  responsibility of the Congress to be the final decision-maker on going to war
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:35.440]  that's been long gone lost but that's one of the things we've all been fighting
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:42.480]  for is try to restore that principle to our country recently shifting into
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:46.680]  monetary issues you had Bernanke on the hot seat you said is gold money and he
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:51.120]  said no it's not to their their counterfeit fellow reserve notes are now
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:55.400]  we've seen two weeks ago on meet the press the former head of the fellow
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:58.680]  reserve Greenspan I'm sure you saw it say hey we're not going to default we'll
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:03.600]  just print money but isn't that a form of default that's that inflation tax you've
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:07.360]  been talking about and another way of cheating people that have have bought the
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.360]  treasuries I mean it's it's looking more and more like Hitler and his bunker to
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:18.400]  watch the fellow reserve giggling about what they're doing yeah once the
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:23.160]  country gets this indebted they never pay their bills they can't work their way
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:26.920]  out theoretically we could you know if we did all the things necessary but in
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:34.480]  reality countries don't and especially if you end up over 40% of the money you
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:39.600]  need to operate if you have to borrow it is at a point almost of no return so
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:45.280]  they have to liquidate the debt first they won't admit we're in bankruptcy
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:50.000]  because they've been able to pawn it off in the American taxpayers by raising
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.440]  tax and then playing the currency and borrowing around the world but we
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:59.480]  literally are bankrupt so the debt has to be liquidated and it is true we won't
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:05.520]  default on the debt in the sense that they they won't pay off the holders of
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:09.920]  bonds they'll always be paid off just like the holders of the obligations for
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:13.760]  Social Security will always send the check but what they don't have control on
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:18.480]  is the value of that money they sent matter of fact it is a deliberate policy
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:24.720]  of the Fed and Bernanke has essentially admitted this that the only way we can
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:28.640]  get out of this is inflation some of the some of the liberal economists are
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:32.960]  saying what what this economy really needs is an inflation rate of about six
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:38.360]  percent and so he's actually they're actually encouraging the inflation in
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:44.360]  order for the real debt to go down obviously if your dollar loses 50% in
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:49.800]  purchasing power your real debt goes down 50% so 50% inflation which they're
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:55.000]  liable to get the real debt goes from 14 down to 7 but the real problem is
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.960]  is everybody doesn't suffer equally some people suffer more some people
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:03.280]  actually benefit and the middle class generally gets wiped out and if they
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:08.120]  want to aim for five ten or fifteen or thirty percent inflation they don't have
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:11.600]  control of it it may turn into a hundred percent inflation and it'll get out of
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.440]  control and that's what I think is our greatest danger right now
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:19.240]  congressman has been said by a lot of pundits that you're a prophet I think
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:23.320]  Al Sharpton even said that in it they can't deny that basically everything
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:28.000]  you've talked about has now come true and they say Ron Paul's on a mission he's
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  certainly educating people so at least they're admitting that you are in a war
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.120]  of ideas and that you're trying to change the course of history and I would
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:40.480]  say successfully doing that when loser draw but but getting some into the
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:44.280]  campaign even when you were on Neil Cavuto yesterday or a few days ago I
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:48.400]  saw it on YouTube last night not sure when he kept saying too bad you can't
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:52.880]  win I sure love you too bad you can't win so it was kind of a back slap in a
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:56.960]  smiley way I'm not attacking Cavuto but but the issue is in every poll I've seen
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:00.520]  I watch it you've been number one number two or number three for the last six
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:07.080]  months and you you win the New Hampshire straw poll you get a technical tie even
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:10.800]  when they're buying the votes in Iowa and they put out this hoax that you can't
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:17.200]  win but then meanwhile and this is what I want you to speak to you've got Romney
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:21.880]  who's the Obamacare author his model it's now come out that not only was Perry
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:26.960]  the campaign manager in Texas for Gore but that now we learned in 93 he gave
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:32.560]  speeches and wrote letters endorsing Hillary care worse than Obamacare and
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:37.520]  forced Gardasil shots sir so I know you're a gentleman but it all hinges in
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:41.200]  my political opinion you can correct me if I'm wrong you have much greater
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:47.320]  gravitas than I on you going after these people because they are basically like
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:52.040]  Obama but they look more like Ronald Reagan I mean what do you say about these
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:58.060]  two establishment hacks that the system is exalting as our you know as our new
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:40:02.440]  leader but generally over the years I've allowed their policies to speak for
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:07.120]  themselves and their policies are now feeling wholesale that's why our voice
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:12.880]  is growing in strength and credibility because everything they say and do and
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:16.560]  advocate is is a total failure whether it's the war they fight or the printing
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:20.400]  of the money or running up these debts and and all these proposals for the
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.400]  bureaucracy I mean just think of the size of government over the last the
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:28.480]  growth of the government over these last 50 years it's been horrendous so I think
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:34.200]  that that is such glaring evidence that you all know I don't you know I don't
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:38.560]  you know rally the thought of just really accusing of all sorts of things
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:43.600]  because they're all to blame and it's bigger than one person I understand but
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:47.680]  those are the guys that they're selling your voters mainline Republicans
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:52.520]  libertarians conservatives I mean Rick Perry has gone from doubling you know the
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:57.080]  size of Texas government in 10 years to to saying basically that he's you know
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:02.120]  I'm the real Ron Paul I'm Rick Perry and you know the Federal Reserve is almost
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:06.080]  treacherous for treasonous I mean he's trying to become you so what do you say
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:10.280]  to that but I think that people have to realize and look at his record when they
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:14.800]  look at his record they know that he's a flip-flopper I mean how can what he say
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:19.440]  be much different than what Romney has done with his medical care system up in
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:27.520]  Massachusetts and you're right Barry has endorsed Hillary's program but the
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:32.360]  American people you know I guess the one reason why it seems so obvious to me
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:36.560]  why does anybody even have to lecture people why don't they just wake up and
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.800]  look at history and investigate a little bit but I think more and more is
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:46.960]  coming out I you know I I think Barry you know is gonna be a very very
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:53.360]  formal politician and he may well walk off with it but it's the sad state of
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.320]  affairs if the people don't wake up and look at their records you know how can
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:04.120]  they be so happy about like you like you said he was a chairman for Al Gore in
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:09.940]  Texas in what 1980 1988 handing roads over to Center of Spain
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:14.400]  Bilderberg group meetings forced inoculations I mean the fact is he's
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:19.160]  doing all this stuff now not just in 93 praising Hillary what person in their
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:24.520]  right mind would support Hillary care I mean I was I was 18 years old when they
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:29.520]  were trying to ram through her 17 and I knew it was bad when I was 17 so right
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:34.760]  there it shows he's got major judgment problems people in Washington I've known
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:39.720]  for years and those generally who run for the presidency the only thing that
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:45.360]  motivates them is power and it's it's not sound ideas it's not freedom and
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:51.040]  they're they're locked in on this power struggle both parties of this way the
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:56.120]  parties pretend they're different and they have different rhetoric but you know
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:00.960]  regardless of which which parties in control they end up doing the same
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:05.920]  thing so it's it's only the power and the and the bill and the ability to
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:09.800]  provide special benefits to those special interests that put them in the
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.840]  power yes sir the reason why things are so different today is we're bankrupt and
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:19.320]  that's why this is all going to come to an end so the big question is who's
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:24.400]  going to pick up the pieces now and who's going to lead the charge away from
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:28.240]  the drift where we have gone to you know in the last really hundred years whether
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:34.440]  it's foreign policy or monetary policy IRS and and they and if they had all
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:38.360]  these things have gone on for a long time I think it's coming to an end yes sir
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:45.320]  and that's why what we're doing now all of us you know it's so important and I
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:48.400]  think their failures are going to speak for themselves if that's going to be
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:54.800]  this their failures are shouting I'm very loud about how poorly their ideas
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.920]  are working we've only got about four minutes left with you sir so I want to
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.280]  move quickly here obviously when you say he may well walk away with it you are
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:06.640]  within striking distance if we can just expose the hoax that is Rick Perry and
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:11.480]  then the other minion met Romney you are going to have it sir and it's perfect
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:15.800]  timing or the man of the hour God is literally you know given you to us that
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:18.800]  you've been right all these years never compromised right as America is
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:23.000]  collapsing here you are with the constitutional tried and true common
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:29.400]  sense solutions but if you do lose you still win by educating people but but
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:34.800]  you say that you're gonna go home after this when you're when your term is up
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:38.960]  if you don't win the presidency if you don't win the presidency and leave sir
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:43.360]  are you still gonna write and speak I wouldn't know what to do if I didn't do
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:47.760]  that I've always thought that I've always done the same thing with I'm in
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:53.160]  office or out of office or whatever and the goals have always been the same the
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:57.880]  elected position has generally been secondary but one thing is if you're in
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:02.360]  the business of trying to change the course of a country you can do a much
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:06.280]  better job if you're in office and obviously you as president I can do a
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:12.040]  much better job than if I'm just looking for a format and wondering where I'll
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:17.840]  go next so no I it's more or less out of my hands I just do what I have to do
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.400]  and we'll see how things come out so we'll still be able to have you pop in
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:25.720]  from time to time even if you do retire I'm gonna be around you are you are
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.640]  awesome sir final questions here because this is why I know you're so real not
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:34.200]  just that you don't compromise and not just your perfect constitutional voting
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:37.720]  record I hope everybody gets behind you campaign for liberty as well all the
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:43.240]  other great candidates a donate at Ron Paul 2012 comm knock on doors get
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:48.360]  involved in your party precincts become a delegate Ron Paul can win and will win
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:51.800]  if we get behind him he's put his hat in the ring and is pouring his heart and
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:56.880]  soul out it's up to us to get behind Ron Paul or wish later by gnashing our
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:00.400]  teeth that we would have but sir in closing last year at a campaign for
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:04.160]  liberty event you talked about a coup in America you said the CIA's been caught
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:08.360]  shipping drugs in we've had a coup in America I want you to specifically because
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:12.560]  I got a lot of questions about that to this day what you exactly meant by that
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:19.400]  well what I imagine if you pin me down in the literal sense of what a coup
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:25.040]  generally is probably not quite that but for the CIA to really be running the
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:29.800]  show I was referring to the CIA at the time because it's so secretive it's
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:34.960]  somewhat like the secrets of the Federal Reserve in finances it's so hard to find
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:40.280]  out what's going on but the CIA is involved in war there they they are
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:46.160]  involved in military activity they pick targets from Langley and in the
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:50.320]  Alexandria you know in Virginia they can shoot missiles to any spot in the
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:54.000]  world generally killing a lot of people they shouldn't be killing and missing the
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.720]  ones they're trying to target so therefore it is totally secret that
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:03.200]  this is even out of you know out of the realm of what Obama does when he says
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:07.480]  well I'm going in and I'm gonna be with NATO and I'm gonna start bombing Libya I
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:14.880]  think this is a very serious and now we have the DOD person that portrays going
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:20.840]  over the CIA and then the CIA head going over to the military is it's such a
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:26.520]  mixed deal that we don't know exactly what's happening but I know the CIA has
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:30.000]  been involved in so many elections around the world they pick and choose
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.640]  dictators I'm sure they're and I don't think there's any doubt they're very much
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:38.040]  involved in these revolutions going on in the Mediterranean and we're just out
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:43.080]  trying to pick dictators so I don't I just don't like all this secrecy and
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:47.640]  government out of the control of the people who are responsible well
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:50.560]  Congressman we've got to let you go I want to ask you one last question and
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:55.760]  just remind folks to get behind Ronnie Ron Paul 2012.com speaking of FEMA you've
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:59.280]  been criticized for saying we don't need FEMA but all they do is confiscate guns
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:03.160]  at Katrina that's really not the federal government's job I guess but you were
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:08.640]  asked by reporter Robert Wannick a few weeks ago in Iowa about the HR 645
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:12.520]  National Emergency Centers Establishment Act and you said yeah that's their goal
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:16.320]  they're setting up the stage for violence in this country no doubt about it
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:22.520]  responded Paul sir in conclusion what did you mean by that who are they well
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:30.120]  I'm not even sure I recall that exact conversation but you know the FEMA's in
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:37.000]  charge of all emergency so whether it's a natural disaster or whatever they're
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.440]  in charge of our land their land planners their economic planners and
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:46.960]  they're planning for anti-provision and they I think the
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:51.480]  establishment of people in Washington both Republicans and Democrats know
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:56.760]  history just like we do that you can have breakdown of law and order so the
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:02.480]  people unfortunately will be begging for for a stabilization and they'll be
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:05.880]  inviting the federal government to come in to stabilize things so I think they're
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:10.160]  making plans along those lines to how how they take care of a problem when
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:13.760]  there's a breakdown of law and order and they'd like that power grab that's
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:19.120]  that's their goal it's all about power congressman Ron Paul Ron Paul 2012.com
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:23.400]  sir thank you so much for spending time with us okay good to talk to you good
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:28.480]  to talk to you there goes congressman Ron Paul ladies and gentlemen and I
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:33.440]  always feel guilty when I call up and get them on the show because I have to
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:39.160]  know how hard he's working but there he was and that was definitely a powerful
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:46.760]  interview wow that is the real deal perfect constitutional voting record you
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:51.760]  claim you're an American you claim you stand for America that's it in fact I
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:56.960]  really have to agree I admire Ron Paul more than anybody else out there alive
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:01.960]  unless come at my dad or somebody or my grandpa's but politically he's it and if
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:06.600]  you want founding father material who was it Le Rockwell said we haven't had
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:12.720]  something like this since the time of Jefferson he has never compromised he
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:21.000]  works 18 hours a day admittedly sleeping less than six hours he might take off
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.560]  I've been told a lot of folks that know him more than I one and a half maybe two
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:32.680]  days a month all the rest of the time stoic research radio interviews all he
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:36.800]  does is exercise for one hour in the morning he doesn't even hardly eat
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:43.360]  anything I've been at events with Ron Paul's he doesn't eat he barely sleeps
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:48.120]  and you can see it in his face like you got to pray for that guy I mean that's
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:51.360]  why he gets demonized and attacked and the Co until pro says he's not real

[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:11.880]  I just learned something during the break with one of the guys back there in
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:18.440]  the shipping office his parents live in lake jackson three doors down from the
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:24.360]  polls that's one of those subdivision slash rural areas backing up on folks
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:30.480]  little pieces of property and he says he was out there he said just a few weeks
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:36.280]  ago and it was hundred something degrees and there's Ron Paul mowing the
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:41.760]  yard and doing stuff in the garden and everything he's just a regular guy who
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:46.360]  milk cows and then of course had a milk around his little kid got up every day at
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:51.480]  3 30 in the morning and went and did it and he's just old line america what's
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:57.240]  left of it and a doctor so disciplined dedicated knowing there's a mission
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:01.820]  literally pouring out his whole essence guys will you pull up the teddy
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:06.480]  Roosevelt quote teddy Roosevelt quote in the arena and then put it on screen I
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:10.640]  want to read that on air you know it is it doesn't matter about the critics
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:15.640]  people that never actually do anything and just sit back and throw stones people
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:20.240]  like Ron Paul what matters is the man in the arena and you may not win every
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:24.080]  time but as long as you're doing right in the end you'll be an example to others
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:28.520]  who are going to win and it doesn't matter one way or the other Ron Paul win
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:35.520]  loses or draws if he wins we probably get this country back faster but if he
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:41.200]  loses the ideas are there and ideas are bulletproof and it's called the man in
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:45.160]  the arena it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:50.280]  strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:54.480]  credit belongs to the man who was actually in the arena whose face is marred
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:56:03.200]  by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errors and whose short
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:08.680]  comings come short again and again it's so far away I can't read it so we'll
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:13.280]  just print it later and I'll read it but again I'm gonna try it again here we go
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:18.240]  it is not them critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:22.280]  stumbles like I just did or where the doer of deeds could have done them better
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:26.560]  the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:33.040]  marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:38.400]  again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:42.960]  but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows the great
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:48.480]  enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:53.440]  the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst to
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:58.360]  be fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:04.840]  be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat thanks
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:10.440]  for putting that on the screen for me guys listen I know I'm standing up for
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:14.000]  what's right I know my nightly news show isn't gonna be as slick as other people's

[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:13.840]  the devil a raccoon will probably beat beat you the smallest chimpanzee you'll
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:17.840]  beat the biggest UFC fighter you know why because they're not looking for
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:22.560]  trouble folks but you corner one they don't have a governor that will turn it
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:29.280]  loose and tear your face off and we've got to politically get into that area of
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:35.200]  our guts and our mind where we don't play games anymore where we're not afraid
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:40.240]  to tell it like it is and come right out with it the time for playing games and
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:45.560]  holding back what we say and what we believe is over old-timers all those
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:48.600]  old-timers are get off my land and don't trust the government they're
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:52.920]  backwards now they weren't backwards ladies and gentlemen they lived in the
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:56.000]  real world and came from people that lived in the real world where if you
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.360]  made mistakes you didn't live it's this modern society with all its great
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:06.480]  attributes at the end of the day and the final equation when the curtain falls
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:12.880]  makes us weak and it makes us like lambs the slaughter the complexity of
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:21.400]  society the complexity of civilization is something that tyrants can hide
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:29.800]  behind it's something that evil can live under like roaches and now the roaches
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:33.960]  feel so powerful they're telling us get out of our house or to shine their
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:39.440]  little roach feet I'm not doing it okay and I've got some news I'm going to
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:46.920]  cover when we come back briefly as fast as I can a on all over the country a
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:52.120]  phenomenon that really illustrates just how dire our straits are the police
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:56.000]  arresting people that film them at city council meetings and on street corners
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.800]  and one guy's facing life in prison I've seen charges where it's 15 years 20
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:06.800]  years and thought it was bad this guy's facing life in prison and the article
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:10.720]  said 75 but actually I looked at the charges and other news reports life it
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:14.400]  did you know these 40 somethings they estimate you know as he's 40 that they
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:21.520]  estimate he'll die so they're saying 75 on the life in prison and they admit
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:27.000]  the newscast you know the the newscaster really believes or maybe he's lying to
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:30.040]  people but I think it got looks like you know he's a mainline person doesn't
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:33.200]  even know what which end is up that you don't film police but the fact that the
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:38.880]  cops know the law and they know that they're going and bamboozling the
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:42.320]  juries to send innocent people to prison let me tell you're dealing with some
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:48.340]  real criminals and this guy shouldn't just have the charges dropped all the
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:53.160]  people that file them are criminals the criminals ain't to be brought to justice
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:57.560]  nothing worse than government oppressing people

[02:08:53.240 --> 02:09:01.200]  report today by Paul Joseph Watson that is also linked at drudgereport.com
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:09.040]  in the middle column man faces life in jail for recording police now this
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:16.520]  article is so important that I again do not have words to describe it so I hope
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:23.720]  that everyone is listening very very carefully to me please listen to me when
[02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:27.240]  you see an article like this you automatically even if you don't know
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:34.520]  the law say that sounds crazy so then you read deeper demand film police in
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:43.520]  public and you know that there's no perception of privacy in public that's
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:47.200]  how the government videotapes us with cameras that's how the police have squad
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.640]  car cameras that's how police most police wear microphones or even small
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:57.640]  cameras on their ties or on their shirt is it wiretapping when they come up to
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:03.240]  you is it wiretapping when you're at the beach and shoot some video that's
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:08.800]  recording audio of people walking down the beach no you're in a public place
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:13.760]  when you see tourist videotaping down a street do you run over and say I'm
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:21.520]  calling the police you're wiretapping no the answer is no and I've read these
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:26.560]  wiretapping statutes in the 12 states where they are arresting and convicting
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:33.040]  people in most cases it gets thrown out or it gets thrown on appeal but the
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:40.240]  point is they are convicting people when it's not a wiretapping statute the
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:47.080]  statute is in a private place recording someone without their consent and
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:52.600]  normally it's mafia run areas like Connecticut New York Illinois where they
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:57.240]  do not want people to be able to tape them they don't want to be caught in all
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:04.240]  of their corruption now from Maryland to Illinois all over the place every day
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:10.760]  now I see articles where people are being arrested I saw a case in Maryland
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:15.240]  where the guys 200 yards away police are beating people the police march over
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:23.640]  beat him and take him to jail and charge him and he was facing felony
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:29.920]  wiretapping now it got thrown out of court later but the point is they were
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:35.680]  trying to put that guy in jail I see cases now where people have surveillance
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:39.440]  on their own business or home cops come for whatever reason you go to jail
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:43.920]  because you have a camera I've seen cases where citizens videotape other
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:48.240]  citizens in one case in a town where they the police give citizens radar guns
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:53.360]  they videotape that the cops came on the people's property and arrested them for
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:58.120]  wiretapping so I know you've seen it in your newspaper it's happening in 12
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:06.400]  states and those 12 states have very evil police does that mean all of them
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:12.960]  are evil no but the the prosecutors the bosses the police chiefs are extremely
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:19.240]  evil it is beyond Soviet tyranny in the Soviet Union if you were somebody caught
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:22.560]  with a camera or something just in general public and most people were
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:25.280]  allowed to have cameras and who were videotaping something they might take
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:29.600]  it away same thing in other third-world countries I know American tourists that
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:32.560]  we've interviewed that have been to North Korea and are allowed to videotape
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:35.080]  certain areas they've been caught in areas they're not supposed to be they
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:40.840]  just take it away in America you videotape police in public in fact in
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:45.680]  some of these cases that the that this newscast covers at city council meetings
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:51.600]  and the cops beat somebody up and then turn in one of these reports to three
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:57.680]  people taping them and arrested all of them and charge them with felony
[02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:03.560]  wiretapping you're in a city council public building cameras all around it's
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:09.640]  on local television local cable in this particular case we've got here and the
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:16.040]  cops arrest three people I mean this these people this is worse than North
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:23.880]  Korea okay now what's incredible is they go and actually throw the book at
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:29.840]  people go to these kept moron juries have the judge tell them yes the statute
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:34.000]  says this well the statute goes on to say but not in public if there's a
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.240]  perception there's no perception of privacy they just ignore that and say
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:43.000]  this is wiretapping illegal wiretapping and some people are being convicted I
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:47.320]  found some cases I wrote part of some Watson he says in here you know they've
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:50.680]  thrown out all the charges well in the cases he found I've seen cases we're
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:56.120]  gonna have those added where you do go to jail if you're a poor person don't
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:14:00.840]  know your rights and you don't know how you get convicted to appeal it it's over
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:05.080]  you're going to jail and see the cops don't care if this is getting thrown out
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:10.080]  in these 12 states over and over again in most cases and then poor people that
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:13.360]  can't defend themselves are actually going to jail they don't care it is a
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:19.280]  brazen cold-blooded attack on the First Amendment and free speech to chill it to
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:25.400]  the bone I see cases now every few days specifically with people being arrested
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:29.280]  when a cop comes up to their car their wife starts videotaping it on an iPhone
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:33.480]  or droid and the cops says what are you doing videotaping me and they say well
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:39.160]  we're just taping the the this encounter and and one of the tapes he said
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:44.080]  that's it your anti-law enforcement seeing his crazy mind why you don't like
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:47.280]  me because you're taping this I'm gonna go ahead and get you out put you in
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:51.400]  handcuffs and he takes the guy's wife to jail you've seen these cases on the
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:58.000]  news I mean this is cuckoo crazy but then it's not a rogue cop he gets them
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.600]  down to the department it goes to the prosecutor you get released from jail
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:12.120]  and then you end up going to trial member lion County Kentucky Kelly rushing
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:20.120]  Kelly rushing this is now seven years ago six and a half years ago I got calls
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:24.560]  from listeners going hey I've been arrested I was handing out your videos
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:29.720]  to state police and I will well what was on the tape well a Ron Paul speech
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:33.560]  called neocond and then your film wrote a tyranny and they've charged me for
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:38.760]  both the Ron Paul speech and you and I was like send me some proof well about a
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:44.000]  week later comes in the mail the lion County newspaper I showed it on air
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  somewhere around here and they were with a straight face Kelly rushing and it
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:53.280]  turned out great family there for over a hundred years well known business owners
[02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:57.480]  he was just like hello officer I'd like to give you this video about what's
[02:15:57.480 --> 02:16:01.920]  happening in America the cop a couple days later comes in arresting and laughs
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:07.320]  at him and calls his wife and says I got the VHS bandit VHS tape still around
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:13.400]  then and then I even I still couldn't believe it I called the judge and I said
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:16.400]  are you judge says he goes yes you're calling me at home I says I already goes
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:20.640]  yeah he was a southern gentleman but obviously a tyrant and I said are you
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:24.560]  really about to have a trial for handing videos on he was well I can't talk
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:28.240]  about it but yes it's next week and they went in and put on a whole two-day
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:34.560]  trial had a jury there and they said no to both counts of threatening police and
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:40.280]  the cop got on the thing and said I find this video threatening I mean this guy
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:46.720]  looked at Kelly rushing like he wasn't even a human a nice friendly guy pulling
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:50.880]  up to police and others going hello officer I want you know about how we can
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:57.280]  save America and these guys watch videos that freak them out freak them out
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:03.480]  because the truth hurts and they go and arrest him and have a trial now that's
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:10.080]  my issue here is that they're taking children and arresting parents for
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:13.800]  spanking them every day in this country when there's no log and spanking
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:17.440]  children check it out they're taking children every day for not
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:21.600]  inoculating children when there's no law you ask how do they do that they've
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:25.920]  got juries ladies and gentlemen that will do whatever they're told in many
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:31.120]  areas and they've got family courts set up as racial hygiene eugenics courts
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:36.200]  about 95 years ago give or take who would order sterilization it's just a
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:40.160]  judge they're not real courts that's where we get family courts they didn't
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:43.840]  exist before you had a real jury had to be that proof of something that's how
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:47.760]  they're doing this and it's a lawless criminal government but I want to say
[02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:50.120]  something to police officers where I come back by this clip and go to your
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:54.880]  calls listen the Bill of Rights and Constitution is there to protect you
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:58.560]  just like us and the fact is it was just a few months ago nine states doing
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:02.240]  this now it's 12 states doing it and that's in the newscast coming up like
[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:07.880]  part of it all things at info wars.com local NBC affiliate there in the area
[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:16.200]  where this happened in Illinois but imagine this guy is facing life in
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:21.360]  prison and the prosecutor is running around in the news saying yes we're
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:26.240]  going to put him in jail for life and feels good about that man even if you're
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:30.360]  a soulless monster I don't know if you are but it sounds like it do you want
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:38.280]  that bad luck I mean you reap what you sow I'm God fearing folks you may not
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:41.960]  believe in God but I've seen a lot in my life let me tell you when you do bad it
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:48.480]  comes back on you I mean I don't know how a prosecutor could could could sit
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:54.960]  there in some well-known businessman 41 year old no criminal record nice clean
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:19:00.760]  cut guy videotapes police and they're trying to put him in jail for life I
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:05.960]  mean that's immoral on so many fronts and then I read where the average
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:11.520]  sentence for a murderer is something like 14 years and they serve seven but
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:15.080]  you know they're gonna keep him in there for decades and this poor guy didn't
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:18.640]  even know his rights and he's like well I guess I'm gonna be going to prison for
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:25.000]  life I don't see how in America they do this but I didn't know it was a law just
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:32.520]  the people Paris for lack of knowledge it isn't the law why do you think in 38
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:35.600]  states the police know yes it's your right to videotape just don't interfere
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:40.200]  in police activity stay back 20 feet cop can say that all day long but you can't
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:45.400]  you can't just well you're what's your wife doing taping me you're going to
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:49.720]  jail lady and then you get there the prosecutors like absolutely let's send
[02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:55.200]  them to prison folks this is the essence of tyranny if police in 12 states will
[02:19:55.200 --> 02:20:02.640]  do this God help us even when they know it's being thrown out most cases Alex

[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.840]  lot of this possible so I want to commend and thank you we're all doing this
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:27.960]  together now getting back to the police I'm gonna come back in the next long
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:32.240]  segment and go to David Thomas J Pat Frank and others that are patiently
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:40.440]  holding I want to get this article out to everybody and there's six guys in the
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:44.080]  little town by the name of Michael Allison and we've tried them and a bunch
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:47.120]  of them are unlisted numbers so we're trying to get this gentleman on the
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:52.600]  show so we can help him and advise him and say sir there's no perception of
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:58.080]  privacy in public the police know that they falsely charged you the
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:03.160]  prosecutor knows this this is asinine but the jury is going to be kept if you
[02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:07.480]  get a public defendant they work for the system they're going to put you in jail
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:12.560]  this is a big deal the system knows they're engaging in crime they're so
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:17.400]  scared of cameras they want to scare people not to videotape them they want
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:21.440]  to use that against us not the other way around and so sir not only should the
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:27.040]  charges be dropped but you need to deal with the civil rights lawsuit you need
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:32.280]  to call for criminal investigation state police whoever that's like asking
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:37.120]  Satan to investigate in Illinois but the point is you've got to go after these
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:41.920]  people politically they are willing to put you in jail for the rest of your
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:47.760]  life in a cell and make the taxpayers pay for it when they know filming in
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:51.720]  public is not illegal let's go to part of this newscast here it is
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:57.520]  75 years behind bars a prison sentence that long is rarely handed down and
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:02.880]  it's usually just for murderers or rapists but a local man faces 75 years
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:07.400]  in prison for a non-violent crime what he's accused of doing is something many
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:13.840]  people have done but most don't realize it's actually illegal it's not what
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:21.080]  you're witnessing is now against the law in some states also becoming illegal
[02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:27.160]  as well as this these infamous scenes are being banned in more and more
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:32.240]  states the police and these recordings are not necessarily the ones breaking the
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:37.360]  law people recording the police recording audio of law enforcement
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:41.800]  without their consent is considered a crime in a dozen states including
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:49.160]  Illinois that sounds like a plot in a movie to call what I did crime is
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:53.400]  ridiculous Michael Allison publicly recorded law enforcement in Robinson
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:58.720]  Illinois now he's charged with five felonies with up to 15 years in prison
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:04.240]  for each count that's a total of 75 years if convicted the 75 years in
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:09.320]  prison and and it's it's just so unbelievable Allison could spend the
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:13.880]  rest of his life behind bars the 42 year old is out on bail preparing to
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:18.760]  stand trial the crime he's accused of eavesdropping this doesn't make any
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:26.000]  sense and the for for one thing the statute has its written can be
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.520]  interpreted any which way Illinois is one of the states applying old eavesdropping
[02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:34.280]  and wiretapping statutes to new technologies like cell phones or
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:39.080]  anything else that records audio those laws technically make it illegal to
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:43.680]  record on-duty law enforcement officials without can't hear anymore the
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:50.120]  penalty on duty law enforcement officials all these little titles and the
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:53.360]  rest of it they know full well and I've read the Illinois statute because I've
[02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:59.000]  sent reporters up there by the way they know full well that that is over a
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:05.080]  phone line or in a private building without their knowledge and obviously if
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:09.960]  you're taping someone at a city council like he did or you're taping cops on the
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:14.280]  street or when they could pull you over and their video taping you it is
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:22.160]  asinine and they know full well that it is illegal what they're doing to go a
[02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:27.640]  lot of a jury to to put a statute against somebody that isn't written for
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:33.840]  what you're doing is totally illegal now they also imply in the statute it's
[02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:37.480]  only illegal to film cops in public no the way they're interpreting it it's
[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:42.840]  anybody you can't videotape with audio going anybody anywhere including a
[02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:48.040]  football game according to these guys they want to put law-abiding citizens
[02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:54.800]  in prison to intimidate us we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones

[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:52.200]  phone calls David in Florida thank you for holding sir we've we've had Devon
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:56.920]  at no-tow son Ron Paul major presidential contender and of course
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:02.760]  Colonel Schaefer quite a transmission today yes it is um mr. Jones I'm calling
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:08.400]  in because this morning I was looking to 106.5 FM out of Mobile Alabama and their
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:12.000]  guest talked about how just like you said Rick Perry campaign for Al Gore and
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:18.840]  that also something new about how it just came out that he was like a
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:23.800]  supporting Nancy Gorsi well it's worse than that yes of course her as well
[02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:28.360]  back in even her San Francisco days I did see a report on that but the big one
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:33.560]  that I just raised with Ron Paul was Hillary care he actually gave speeches
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:38.240]  wrote letters went public bought his agriculture commissioner at the time of
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:41.320]  the daily caller actually broke this I didn't even know this I mean I knew he
[02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:48.200]  was a hardcore global warming supporter of Al Gore presidential manager in
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:55.240]  Texas didn't become a republic until 90 but then was in some reports you know
[02:36:55.240 --> 02:37:01.200]  somewhat anti-gun pro open border here's an example of Rick Perry he got an
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:06.600]  award five years ago I have it on video in fall not fall the republic it's another
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:13.960]  film battle for the republic that's a 16 minute mini documentary extra on the
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:19.160]  hind end of in game and of course in game ends with Rick Perry going to
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:22.600]  Bilderberg and us saying he's gonna run for president and how he's a globalist
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:26.760]  and look out again that film's been out almost four years now ladies and gentlemen
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:31.960]  talk about being evergreen and this into a fox gave him an award for in-state
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:35.920]  tuition for illegals something somebody from Oklahoma or Tennessee or
[02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:40.760]  Mississippi Louisiana in a bordering state wouldn't even get and going along
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:45.880]  with sanctuary cities so then this year in the legislature going for to run
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:53.720]  for president he then had his people introduce ending sanctuary city laws and
[02:37:53.720 --> 02:38:01.200]  then killing in himself behind the scenes just like TSA now that is snake
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:06.800]  like and so yes here's the article Rick Perry camp defense 1993 Hillary care
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:13.880]  praise and they've come out and said that yes we we did support Hillary and
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:18.480]  it's got links to his letters and the speeches and all of it so a big Hillary
[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:22.600]  Clinton supporter remember 93 with Rush Limbaugh saying this is the greatest
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:27.120]  evil ever and everything meanwhile Rick Perry was running around supporting it
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:31.520]  but Rush Limbaugh endorses him oh but you'll vote for Mitt Romney instead oh
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:38.000]  Obamacare author I mean it doesn't get any worse than these two also what I'm
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:43.360]  really one to call about is so I called in and I said how that guess his
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:47.640]  information was factual and that how Rick Perry it was a global agenda that he
[02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:53.160]  supposed to be a fake Ron Paul and it's the whole plan to push Paul aside and so
[02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:57.760]  I said you know that the college would hear or listeners would hear that you
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:04.200]  know they need to learn who the who pulls the strings and that because you
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:07.480]  know that this agenda you know I said corporate fascists had threatened our
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:12.520]  U.S. sovereignty anyway so last thing I want to say is a caller called in after
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:17.400]  me and I hope you can get this wrong Paul he says he likes a few things wrong
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:22.120]  Paul talks about I believe him but he said that he feels it's the supporters
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:27.400]  of wrong Paul is the reason why it turns people off on Paul's message because
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:32.280]  they call and speak about how there is a global conspiracy that was his word
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:36.760]  of conspiracy they always say that they always try to attack Paul by the
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:41.600]  awake American people there is a global government it's in the open now calling
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:46.440]  for global carbon taxes and VAT and these these mainline conservatives have
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:52.880]  been fed on a steady diet of fake conservatism and fake constitutionalism
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:56.600]  where they want Rick I mean I've heard him I don't care if he supports Hillary
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:00.760]  I love Rick Perry he's the new Ronald Reagan they feel like they've bought into
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:05.480]  a winner and so they oh they're telling him he's the he's gonna win well I'm
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:09.520]  gonna be I'm gonna support him you know I think if anything makes news and I
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:13.440]  don't almost don't want it to of the Ron Paul interview was his statement about
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:18.320]  well Rick Perry might just walk away with it you know Ron Paul really can't
[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:24.560]  win but but he Paul sees how they're just putting him out there and listen I've
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:28.880]  been to Republican events before and when I was trying to support Pat Buchanan
[02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:33.800]  back in the mid 90s I guess even in the early 90s and I mean some of these
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:39.120]  people they're like weird sycophants who think Republican politicians are like
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:44.440]  rock stars and they just grovel around and think it's cool to compromise well
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:47.200]  they've compromised this country right into a rat hole I appreciate your call
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:53.040]  David I mean that's what they've done and they like it that he supported
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:59.800]  Hillary they like it that they support carbon taxes
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:06.400]  Mitt Romney they like it that he worked for Al Gore they think that's cute they
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:13.400]  like to get hurt they like to fail they like to sycophant around and that's why
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:17.400]  Ron Paul is like almost laughing it's like well that's who they want okay I
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:21.880]  mean he knows where this country's going it's like okay because Ron Paul knows in
[02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:25.480]  the end everything he's gonna has talked about he's already coming true and the
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:28.480]  rest of it's gonna come through and it's like okay you want to run off the side
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:44.200]  of a cliff I mean Thomas in California welcome yes how you doing good I called
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:51.120]  the I actually sent you an article from alternate and another one from reader
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:56.760]  supported news they both said one was exposing the Ron Paul progressives can
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:01.760]  support and the other one said treat Ron Paul with extreme caution and the last
[02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:07.440]  sentence of the article said is there a progressive willing to join that fold and
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:13.160]  then my response to that was yes whether you like it or not Ron Paul is a single
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:17.520]  candidate willing to confront those entities destroying our country like the
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:23.800]  Fed the military industrial complex and the disastrous trade issues etc and then
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:28.200]  every president who took on the banks before had been assassinated like Kennedy
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:34.480]  Lincoln Jackson Garfield and that we are under attack under with a very dark
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:39.200]  element within our government and at least two or three elements outside of
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:44.000]  our government that have global domination in their sights and that Obama
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  has turned out to be our worst enemy and some kind of Trojan horse for the GOP
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:57.280]  and that basically I just went on to cite my arguments about Ron Paul but
[02:42:57.280 --> 02:43:02.400]  within that within the other responses there is at least 80% of progressives
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:07.720]  and liberals that were supporting Ron Paul in that in the responses well see
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:12.280]  that's because a there's probably 50 different types of quote progressives
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:17.360]  there's the communist globalist corporates controlling people go
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:21.360]  corporates communist yeah they created to control people George Soros type that
[02:43:21.360 --> 02:43:25.960]  gives that term a bad name you can call me a classical liberal that's called an
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:30.600]  extreme right-winger today all these terms mean nothing the point is yes in
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:34.720]  national polls they've had scores of them Ron Paul beats Obama that's one of
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:38.800]  the questions I don't have time to get to more than any other GOP candidate and
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:41.880]  it's because a lot of people that don't even totally agree with all of his
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:46.080]  policies and ideas because they're ignorant they still like the fact that
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:50.480]  he does what he says he'll do and as a principled person so yes I've seen that
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:54.120]  on the quote liberal or progressive websites that they like Ron Paul he
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:58.520]  really will in the wars he really will try to you know I mean everybody
[02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:01.920]  realizes now this government doesn't work for us and so even a lot of liberals
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:05.520]  are now out buying guns they're you know they're starting to get more into
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:10.240]  reality and but again when they thought they were about to win something they
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:13.520]  supported Obama and didn't look at who backed him it's the same thing with
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:17.080]  conservatives oh we're about to beat Obama with Rick Perry not looking at
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:20.280]  what they're about to get guy bought and paid for by the same interest I mean
[02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:25.440]  it's so elementary and those people you know it's like Tom Hartman when I was
[02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:31.120]  attacking Bush he would have me on a show and come on this one and and
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:34.280]  understood I was outside the left-right paradigm soon as Obama gets in starts
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:38.320]  attacking me I go on his TV show he makes fun of me and says extreme right
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:42.440]  winger and I go Tom you know these terms mean nothing I want to rule a law in a
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:46.840]  Constitution and he just it was just like was hateful about it and tried to
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:52.080]  make stuff up and it's like man these are political operatives for the
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:57.920]  Democrats and the Republicans and we've it sounds good to have big government to
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:02.600]  help people but it'll never get delivered because the special interest
[02:45:02.600 --> 02:45:07.800]  will steal it that's the nature of man it's why it doesn't work that's why we
[02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:11.240]  need a constitutional Republic I don't agree with anarchists who say no
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:17.360]  government but look most of these modern people cannot stand up to the founders
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:21.320]  that's why they attack the founders because the system is scared of them you
[02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:26.320]  are a rock star then if you could use bigger words have better arguments
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:31.160]  better information better philosophy and could speak more languages and could
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:35.080]  invent more things most the founding fathers were inventors they're
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:39.400]  discovering how to channel electricity and stuff I mean back then it was about
[02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:45.560]  really being smart that those were the rock stars then so if we honored that
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:50.400]  today we would be a different society and kids would want to be the rock star
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:55.440]  inventor now they know how to sell us somebody that dribbles a ball or hits a
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:46:01.800]  golf ball as the heroes and so our society's falling apart the globalists
[02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:07.320]  know how to craft and control reality but again they the fact that Ron Paul
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:10.720]  really is the front-runner they've got a few fake polls showing Rick Perry is
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:14.200]  number one shows why the system so scared it's just amazing even get Ron
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:20.560]  Paul on the show and I appreciate your call anything else Thomas no thank you
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:27.040]  very much thank you I appreciate your call look you when you're talking to a
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:30.160]  mainline conservative idiot or a mainline liberal idiot you gotta go
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:36.520]  listen the same big banks are financing both the Obama and his main Republican
[02:46:36.520 --> 02:46:40.960]  challengers the whole systems against Ron Paul you come on I mean you're not

[02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:23.320]  mass thanks for holding hey Alex thanks for taking my call thank you
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:27.360]  hey I've been a long-term listener I just got my fine finally got my present
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:32.240]  planet TV subscription I talk about you with my friends all the time and on a
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:36.920]  air I have a Christian radio show and I had a question about the New World Order
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:41.080]  I have conversations with friends and they say that there's no point in
[02:47:41.080 --> 02:47:45.640]  fighting the New World Order because you know as a Christian read the New
[02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:49.200]  Testament it says that there's gonna be you know what kind of proff side of the
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:54.000]  New Testament that is gonna be a world-world government and you know that
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:57.480]  the Satanic system the anti-crisis gonna rise up might as well just let it
[02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:00.360]  happen because you know it's and I'm like what I was wondering what your opinion
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:05.400]  was on that well I've you absolutely that's something that I talk a lot about
[02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:11.280]  even if Armageddon is preparing to take place it is our responsibility to
[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:16.800]  aggressively fight evil and corruption and you gobble say you know I don't know
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:21.440]  you I mean if you're a Christian and follow of that system then how can you go
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:25.600]  along with it how can so many mainline Christians make fun of Ron Paul talking
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:30.080]  about global government when that's what the Bible teaches see it's a
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:37.120]  schizophrenic denial now the truth is that if you really read the Bible and
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:44.120]  it's clear I don't get into arguments about it it says that after Christ
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:48.080]  returns the angel ties up the devil throws him in the pit Christ reigns for
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:53.120]  thousand years it's that when Christ returns the dead rise and joining that's
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:49:00.000]  there there isn't a rapture before all of this so it's this ultimate cop-out and
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:03.320]  Germans thought they were gonna be rapture under Hitler Chris Christians
[02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:07.120]  under Pol Pot Chinese always think they're gonna be raptured did did did
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:11.480]  people get raptured the disciples getting crucified and hung upside down and
[02:49:11.480 --> 02:49:18.280]  boiled an oil did no no see this is a giant cop-out and was sold but for the
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:25.120]  secular folks they sell 2012 they say oh in 2000 Planet X is coming and then 2003
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:30.200]  and then 2006 and I get emails I know that July 15th of this year you're gonna
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:34.280]  be in a bunker and your government you know that Planet Zupal or something's
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:41.000]  coming and then then it's Ellen and there's something comment now go look at
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:44.240]  the track of it and it's a little bit of comment no big deal you know it's just
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:49.280]  constant and then as soon as Ellen and doesn't kill us in October then it'll
[02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:53.640]  be a new comment just like Thundar the barbarian on TV for kids in the 80s was
[02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:57.400]  pre-programming them and all these end-of-the-world Al Gore movies don't
[02:49:57.400 --> 02:50:02.520]  pay him carbon taxes all the cities are destroyed by rising water if the
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:06.360]  psychological warfare chiefs learned that if you teach people it's the end of
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:10.880]  the world they're gonna lay down and take it why did the Aztecs even though they
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:17.960]  outnumbered the Spanish conservatively 500 to 1 there in Mexico City where their
[02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:21.840]  big temple complex was I mean a couple hundred Spaniards show up with a couple
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:28.000]  cannons and they had a prophecy about the end of the world and a metal man
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:32.440]  coming and so the guys in metal armor showed up and they just went crazy and
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:36.560]  started running off cliffs and gave up and said you're God and fell down in
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:40.720]  front of them for a while then figured out they weren't God and you know by
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:46.120]  then the disease had spread the smallpox and wiped most of them out but but
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:50.480]  again that's all it is it's a self-fulfilling prophecy they got it for
[02:50:50.480 --> 02:50:54.400]  secular people they got it for Christians she was like why did you not
[02:50:54.400 --> 02:50:58.600]  care so here in the world anyways then you sit out of the game of life it's a

[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:28.760]  all right let's jam in some more phone calls here had in New Jersey thanks for
[02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:33.840]  holding welcome hi Alex um first off I want to state that I am a run Paul
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:39.600]  supporter but I've noticed that you've acknowledged in past broadcast that like
[02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:45.080]  an arm populace kid successfully resist like a foreign or domestic standing
[02:54:45.080 --> 02:54:50.440]  army using asymmetric warfare and guerrilla tactics and obviously keep
[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:55.160]  criminals from thriving so I'm just wondering why you don't support a
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:54:59.160]  private property anarchism that Mary Rothbard and other philosophers
[02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:08.480]  advocate for well number one in the type of position that we're in now and the
[02:55:08.480 --> 02:55:16.200]  way society's operating to even sit there and discuss pure anarchy you know
[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:21.160]  isn't even in the real world I mean what what would China do what would Russia do
[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:24.920]  the problem is it has to be a philosophy that spreads worldwide then in
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:29.160]  increments you move towards more and more liberty there's always going to be
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:33.200]  gangs that bound together and then the anarchist will have a corporation or a
[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:37.440]  group that then deals with them well exactly and you're back to square one
[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:44.840]  you've got to have local control and you can have anarchy in a rural area if
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:49.400]  people are generally culturally similar and have the same code of ethics and are
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:54.160]  heavily armed because people will then spontaneously get together to defend
[02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:58.480]  others it does work in rural areas it does not work in the society and the
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:03.880]  system we've got today speaking of violence 90% of war is information and
[02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:10.280]  moral high ground if the minute there was some armed uprising the globalist
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:13.440]  would go out and commit a bunch of massacres it's on the books that's their
[02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:18.400]  plan to then blame it on us it'd be a bunch of school kids strung up with
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:21.880]  their guts hanging out on the news and they would say that we did it they
[02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:27.080]  probably show a Morph video of me doing it okay so the point is there's some
[02:56:27.080 --> 02:56:34.720]  very childlike statements out of some of the anarchist that I hear sometimes they
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:38.440]  don't understand the scientific level of tyranny we're dealing with I just want
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:41.760]  to get the cancer viruses out of the vaccines and point out it's not the law
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:46.240]  you got to take them or that you can film cops I mean I'm dealing with with the
[02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:50.440]  overrunning of the emplacement swinging my musket and there's guys up on the
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:53.560]  parapet going and we will have perfect systems of you know
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:57.440]  philosophizing and I'm like swing in my musket around and they're going and then
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:01.640]  it'll be perfect pure anarchy well let me debate that with you my good friend
[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:05.200]  oh that's Alex does not understand the subtleties of the anarchical
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:10.960]  capitalism structures of the structure and I'm like just full-on you know
[02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:17.160]  absolute war with the globalist you got to deal with the globalist and and so
[02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:22.800]  it's yeah I just see a lot of arguments by the pure anarchy people that don't
[02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:27.200]  live in reality so someday if we got rid of most government and got back to
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:31.600]  constitutional system and we educated everybody and that worked maybe we can
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:35.320]  start testing it well these states vote to be in total anarchy dissolve everything
[02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:41.040]  let's see what happens there you know and now do you see what I'm saying there buddy yeah but
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:44.760]  you have many countries now I mean there you know if they take Switzerland or
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:48.680]  there's actually an area of Mexico right now that has completely overthrown the
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:52.240]  Mexican government an entire state that has been without government for years
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:59.360]  now yeah and those states are absolute absolute abject hell holes of lawlessness
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:05.600]  and poverty and starvation and I'm not saying the government brought that or
[02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:09.000]  that government would bring something good they had bad corrupt government and
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:13.480]  now it's it's out of the equation and it's degenerated even more you've got
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:18.920]  to go towards higher orders of liberty you don't go from abject dumbed down
[02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:26.320]  masses into a structure of liberty it's a process as Ron Paul has said I mean
[02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:31.120]  comprende on that pat oh yeah I mean but then you have countries like Switzerland
[02:58:31.120 --> 02:58:35.680]  to don't get attacked by their neighbors well no that's a sovereign nation they
[02:58:35.680 --> 02:58:41.560]  got all sorts of rules there that's not anarchy stay there we're doing overdrive
[02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:53.720]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today hundreds of nations have
[02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:58.440]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[02:58:58.440 --> 02:59:02.960]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug
[02:59:02.960 --> 02:59:07.240]  from underneath the Americans at home I've turned menace influence on our
[02:59:07.240 --> 02:59:11.440]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[02:59:11.440 --> 02:59:16.680]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[02:59:16.680 --> 02:59:21.800]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell
[02:59:21.800 --> 02:59:26.120]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[02:59:26.120 --> 02:59:30.320]  Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[02:59:30.320 --> 02:59:34.000]  Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does
[02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:40.040]  care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic yet
[02:59:40.040 --> 02:59:45.520]  your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com or watch it online
[02:59:45.520 --> 02:59:54.040]  right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. Coast to coast direct
[02:59:54.040 --> 03:00:01.560]  from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network
[03:00:01.560 --> 03:00:15.960]  look Pat I want to go to at least Frank because he's been holding a real long
[03:00:15.960 --> 03:00:19.920]  time and I'm probably gonna get to the other collars I got to most of you
[03:00:19.920 --> 03:00:23.880]  though I apologize as as as normal at the end of the transmission while we
[03:00:23.880 --> 03:00:28.000]  extended for you but I could have a debate about anarchy and really state
[03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:33.240]  my position on it it's uncharted territory the examples of anarchy I've
[03:00:33.240 --> 03:00:39.840]  seen have been road warrior-esque I mean really we did have a form of anarchy
[03:00:39.840 --> 03:00:46.280]  you know in this country it's called the wall-wall West and but you talk about
[03:00:46.280 --> 03:00:49.880]  Switzerland and in talking about anarchy you're talking about a sovereign
[03:00:49.880 --> 03:00:53.840]  country they actually have a lot of rules there but the people have agreed to
[03:00:53.840 --> 03:01:00.440]  institute those for their mutual prosperity that's a lot different than
[03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:04.920]  what you're talking about as the founders said only a moral people can have
[03:01:04.920 --> 03:01:10.560]  liberty and that's been proven I mean let me tell you something as bad as the
[03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:15.840]  police are as out of control as they get you know there's times that you want
[03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:18.600]  them and then there's the problem of they don't want you to be able to arm
[03:01:18.600 --> 03:01:23.920]  yourself so you so that they're the monopoly of power I believe in the sheriff
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:28.080]  I mean why don't cities make deals with sheriff's departments where they're
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:32.000]  elected and accountable and nothing's perfect but getting off into a debate
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:37.680]  here with you Pat you're raising Switzerland as an example of anarchy
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:42.360]  no but the reason that neighbors don't attack Switzerland is not because they
[03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:45.680]  have a government it's because the entire populace is armed and Hitler would
[03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:48.480]  never invade there because he knew he couldn't defeat them it's also a good
[03:01:48.480 --> 03:01:55.040]  place to stash his cash yeah but but I agree with you and it's actually the
[03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:59.080]  Swiss model that's the Dutch model that's our model and so I would like to
[03:01:59.080 --> 03:02:03.080]  move towards liberty it's just that it's a process so I don't think we
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:07.400]  disagree Pat I appreciate your call Frank in Texas you're on the air welcome
[03:02:07.400 --> 03:02:13.520]  hey Alex just a quick few quick things you know talking about anarchy but there
[03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:18.200]  was a scientific compassionate application of anarchy I'd be all for
[03:02:18.200 --> 03:02:22.480]  that but then you would just see the same I think the same kinds of corrupt
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:26.560]  behaviors that you see on larger levels within the government and everything
[03:02:26.560 --> 03:02:32.680]  like that I am a Ron Paul supporter and the thing about Ron Paul is that I don't
[03:02:32.680 --> 03:02:36.600]  think he could ever really I don't think he could get the nomination you know
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:42.760]  that's the frustrating thing for me but get this if he doesn't win don't be
[03:02:42.760 --> 03:02:48.760]  crestfallen don't be depressed he's winning by injecting real issues and
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:52.760]  growing the liberty movement it is resistance that's victory it's like
[03:02:52.760 --> 03:02:58.000]  lifting weights or jogging I mean you've got to put yourself through stress and
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:03.240]  take the field to grow and to master anything and that's why Ron Paul yeah I
[03:03:03.240 --> 03:03:07.040]  told him privately and on air I said we're drafting you by the way we got a
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:10.360]  couple new Ron Paul t-shirts out where he's support us a little bit mainly get
[03:03:10.360 --> 03:03:15.560]  the word out about Ron Paul effect let me show folks that and as you put to
[03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:19.560]  support the info war and get the word out about Ron Paul and that's save the
[03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:25.120]  Republic Ron Paul 2012 and on the back it's got the American flag and legalized
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:31.720]  freedom available at the info wars calm video bookstore slash apparel area and
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:38.720]  you can help spread the word that way and but again I mean if the Republicans
[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:42.720]  don't give him the nomination even if he won that's our fault because we didn't
[03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:48.160]  go in and take over all the delegates I just hope that Jesse Ventura is on the
[03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:52.040]  other side of that ticket to be Ron Paul Jesse Ventura 2012 that'd be pretty
[03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:56.560]  sick you know Ron Jesse Ventura is a great guy and a man of principles and I
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:04:00.600]  really respect him and I'm friends with him but I don't think Ron Paul would
[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:05.520]  have Jesse Ventura on his ticket probably if you really if you get down to
[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:13.720]  brass tacks because he disagrees with a few of Ron Paul's positions and Ron
[03:04:13.720 --> 03:04:20.640]  Paul is 100% no compromise 100% it's like folks that say put Dennis
[03:04:20.640 --> 03:04:25.680]  Cassinage Dennis Cassinage is somewhat principled he bowed to the socialist
[03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:29.280]  government take over health care as he got a ride on Air Force one lost a lot
[03:04:29.280 --> 03:04:32.600]  of respect I disagree with Cassinage on a lot of issues but the fact that he's
[03:04:32.600 --> 03:04:39.400]  normally principled makes me respect him in a field of other miscreants but
[03:04:39.400 --> 03:04:42.960]  Ron Paul would never have Dennis Cassinage is running me that's the
[03:04:42.960 --> 03:04:48.280]  opposite of what he believes in all right folks we'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m.
[03:04:48.280 --> 03:04:54.680]  central don't forget we're about 26 27 hours out on the launch of info wars
[03:04:54.680 --> 03:04:58.800]  nightly news tomorrow 7 p.m. central please spread the word prison wanted on
[03:04:58.800 --> 03:05:02.840]  TV
