[00:00.000 --> 00:24.740]  We are now beginning to hear criticism bubble up on all sides of this event about the initial
[00:24.740 --> 00:27.280]  slow response by the police.
[00:27.280 --> 00:30.560]  When I got out of my car yesterday in Charlottesville for the first time at about 10.30 yesterday
[00:30.560 --> 00:35.040]  morning, you knew this was a bad scene and that bad things were going to be happening
[00:35.040 --> 00:40.720]  because people were congregating at Lee Park, at Emancipation Park, wearing helmets, body
[00:40.720 --> 00:43.840]  armor, carrying big, heavy sticks.
[00:43.840 --> 00:46.760]  Nobody was intent upon peace here from either side.
[00:46.760 --> 00:49.560]  People were intent on causing havoc and causing damage.
[00:49.560 --> 00:54.040]  And even as wounded were being brought out of the park, the police were sitting idly by.
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.800]  I was standing by a cordoned off area where the police had set up as a staging area.
[00:58.800 --> 01:02.600]  The state police had set up and they said, you can come in here, this is a safe area.
[01:02.600 --> 01:07.560]  But when the tear gas started to fly, thrown by protesters, the police themselves began
[01:07.560 --> 01:08.560]  to evacuate that.
[01:08.560 --> 01:10.920]  I asked the guy who was in charge, he said, where are you going?
[01:10.920 --> 01:12.280]  He said, we're leaving.
[01:12.280 --> 01:13.280]  It's too dangerous.
[01:13.280 --> 01:20.440]  They had an opportunity to nip this thing in the bud and they chose not to.
[01:20.440 --> 01:30.800]  That's Doug McKellway reporting Saturday exactly what Millie Weaver and our camera crew reported.
[01:30.800 --> 01:34.000]  In fact, we even have the police at a distance.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.360]  You can hear him saying we've been told to stand down.
[01:37.360 --> 01:48.080]  You can also see police laughing as our crew is pepper sprayed by the anti-white, anti-America,
[01:48.080 --> 01:54.360]  so-called anti-fa, George Soros scum force.
[01:54.360 --> 02:01.120]  Now that said, the people playing in this whole white nationalist thing are morons.
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.560]  In my view, marching out there into the middle of this, you know you're going to give George
[02:05.560 --> 02:11.480]  Soros the media the target they need, especially in Democrat controlled cities where the police
[02:11.480 --> 02:14.920]  are going to stand down.
[02:14.920 --> 02:19.840]  And then you're going to be attacked and then the media is going to say that you attacked,
[02:19.840 --> 02:25.840]  even though 99% of the violence until the car crashes out of the people, terribly, is
[02:25.840 --> 02:32.560]  by the frothing, screaming, insane Soros people who are busted all over the country.
[02:32.560 --> 02:35.640]  We've got video of that confirming it.
[02:35.640 --> 02:38.800]  It's crazy.
[02:38.800 --> 02:43.760]  And that's what they want is violence in this country to divide people along racial lines
[02:43.760 --> 02:44.760]  even more.
[02:44.760 --> 02:46.360]  Look at the headlines on Drudge.
[02:46.360 --> 02:53.360]  Police stand down, that's the New York Times, blamed for Virginia chaos.
[02:53.360 --> 02:54.440]  We were there.
[02:54.440 --> 02:59.160]  Our reporter was told, you got to get out of here.
[02:59.160 --> 03:03.000]  We've been ordered to, quote, stand down.
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.800]  You just heard the Fox News reporter say, he was told by the police, it's too dangerous.
[03:07.800 --> 03:11.760]  We're leaving.
[03:11.760 --> 03:14.120]  Well they did more than leave.
[03:14.120 --> 03:18.960]  They had our people, our reporters, kettled.
[03:18.960 --> 03:25.680]  And then forced everyone down through the fences to be attacked by the antifa who can
[03:25.680 --> 03:26.680]  hardly talk.
[03:26.680 --> 03:29.800]  I mean, I've been at their events, you've seen countless footage, we've shot others
[03:29.800 --> 03:30.800]  of shot.
[03:30.800 --> 03:36.560]  You might have witnessed yourself in person screaming, howling, just kind of their noise
[03:36.560 --> 03:41.200]  they just make on autopilot with F bomb, F bomb, F bomb.
[03:41.200 --> 03:47.760]  They see M4s, they go into mad hysteria and start screaming, F you white, F you white,
[03:47.760 --> 03:53.520]  F you white, when they're white, mental patients.
[03:53.520 --> 04:02.200]  I mean, they're like the mere image of the most mindless KKK person you could ever see.
[04:02.200 --> 04:06.440]  And they pepper sprayed Millie and Gavin, they attacked a Hill reporter.
[04:06.440 --> 04:11.480]  The Hill is one of the most venomous anti-Trump publications in the world.
[04:11.480 --> 04:17.280]  In fact, the woman they attacked is normally frothing anti-Trump and she tells them that.
[04:17.280 --> 04:21.920]  Like I saw the footage yesterday, we never played it though, if you just type in Hill
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.960]  reporter punched by anti-racist protesters, what they call them.
[04:26.960 --> 04:33.600]  And they stomper on the ground because she's a clean cut woman.
[04:33.600 --> 04:38.040]  If you don't look like you've been on meth for 10 years, basically since you were born,
[04:38.040 --> 04:42.080]  a lot of the antifa look like 10 year old methods or 14 year old methods.
[04:42.080 --> 04:47.760]  If you don't look like you were getting meth in your body, in your mommy's tummy, in utero,
[04:47.760 --> 04:53.040]  and that you have been used as toilet paper by Satan, you will be attacked with these.
[04:53.040 --> 04:59.800]  Go there right back, stay with us.
[04:59.800 --> 05:05.360]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called
[05:05.360 --> 05:11.960]  Stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without
[05:11.960 --> 05:13.960]  warrants.
[05:13.960 --> 05:19.320]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments
[05:19.320 --> 05:26.280]  into signing nondisclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[05:26.280 --> 05:31.120]  Just to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal
[05:31.120 --> 05:36.320]  authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting
[05:36.320 --> 05:42.760]  information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[05:42.760 --> 05:47.760]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[05:47.760 --> 05:58.600]  This is Darren McBreen, and I invite you to join the resistance, Infowars.com.
[05:58.600 --> 06:03.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[06:03.000 --> 06:07.720]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[06:07.720 --> 06:09.240]  to detoxify the body.
[06:09.240 --> 06:14.120]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[06:14.120 --> 06:19.320]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[06:19.320 --> 06:22.400]  associated with detoxifying the body, and it supports the Info War.
[06:22.400 --> 06:24.680]  It is a classical 360 win.
[06:24.680 --> 06:29.160]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[06:29.160 --> 06:33.840]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[06:33.840 --> 06:34.840]  get.
[06:34.840 --> 06:38.040]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[06:38.040 --> 06:43.080]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[06:43.080 --> 06:48.280]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[06:48.280 --> 06:51.000]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.280]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[06:54.280 --> 06:58.880]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield, InfowarsLife.com.

[08:26.000 --> 08:41.160]  Saturday morning, by 11.30, I was already here central time, and within five minutes
[08:41.160 --> 08:47.140]  of the news picking up, the race riot that ended up killing one person, injuring dozens
[08:47.140 --> 08:49.480]  in Charlottesville, Virginia.
[08:49.480 --> 08:59.960]  Within five minutes, President Trump tweeted out that he was decrying an absolutely repudiating
[08:59.960 --> 09:00.960]  racism.
[09:00.960 --> 09:08.080]  He then made a statement and went further saying we should love each other and respect
[09:08.080 --> 09:15.320]  each other and feel the love in the room as he was already at a press conference scheduled
[09:15.320 --> 09:20.360]  for the multi-racial crowd of veterans.
[09:20.360 --> 09:21.860]  Didn't matter.
[09:21.860 --> 09:27.080]  Throughout the day and yesterday and today, they said Trump never repudiated it because
[09:27.080 --> 09:32.080]  he said both sides came looking for trouble.
[09:32.080 --> 09:33.560]  And that's absolutely true.
[09:33.560 --> 09:40.880]  So I'm going to show you the tweet time stamped a little bit past noon Eastern.
[09:40.880 --> 09:44.080]  I mean, this thing was just getting started then.
[09:44.080 --> 09:50.800]  I was on the phone with my reporters, with Millie Weaver and Gavin, who were there.
[09:50.800 --> 09:55.640]  They were the first to report with a live feed.
[09:55.640 --> 09:59.120]  As it happened that the police said, we've been ordered to stand down.
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.320]  This is an unlawful assembly, civil emergency declared.
[10:04.320 --> 10:09.400]  And our reporters reported live that they were ordered and marched by the police through
[10:09.400 --> 10:17.040]  the gauntlet of the Soros communists is really what they are.
[10:17.040 --> 10:20.200]  Now you look at Drudge Report today.
[10:20.200 --> 10:23.920]  Why they call us fake news is because we're so on target.
[10:23.920 --> 10:31.200]  New York Times police stand down, blame for Virginia chaos.
[10:31.200 --> 10:41.840]  Here is Fox News clip with a Fox News reporter, Doug McKellway, on the ground, seeing exactly
[10:41.840 --> 10:44.200]  what we said and what Millie Weaver said.
[10:44.200 --> 10:52.200]  And the point is, is that the New York Times, Newsweek, Raw Story, the Washington Times,
[10:52.200 --> 10:57.400]  all the usual suspects, establishment Republicans or afters as well, came out and said, oh,
[10:57.400 --> 10:59.520]  Jones claims there was a stand down.
[10:59.520 --> 11:04.080]  Jones claims that that then allowed this to happen and was a type of false flag.
[11:04.080 --> 11:08.640]  Jones claims that Soros is finding these groups.
[11:08.640 --> 11:12.480]  Jones is so kooky, all of it has now come out.
[11:12.480 --> 11:16.960]  And I'm just pointing out that we had reporters there.
[11:16.960 --> 11:23.240]  You can watch the videos and see it for yourself and see the police say it and see the police
[11:23.240 --> 11:27.920]  laugh when our reporters are attacked or Hill reporters.
[11:27.920 --> 11:30.600]  A New York Times reporter was there.
[11:30.600 --> 11:36.600]  She saw people attack and said that anti-fault was just as bad as the white supremacists.
[11:36.600 --> 11:40.360]  Well, I'm not defending the white supremacists, but we have all the live footage.
[11:40.360 --> 11:47.520]  They were 10 times worse until the guy ran the people over, which was absolutely horrible.
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.080]  But she's being called a Nazi and they're calling for her firing on Twitter.
[11:51.080 --> 11:52.960]  I've got those articles.
[11:52.960 --> 11:54.080]  She was there.
[11:54.080 --> 11:56.360]  She saw other reporters beat up.
[11:56.360 --> 11:58.080]  She saw people beat up.
[11:58.080 --> 11:59.640]  There's even Mother Jones.
[11:59.640 --> 12:02.560]  Police stood by as mayhem mounted in Charlottesville.
[12:02.560 --> 12:10.560]  We told you, just like eight days before, the former deputy director of the CIA and former
[12:10.560 --> 12:18.920]  deputy director of the FBI, Phil Mudd, top CNN analyst, counterterrorism analyst says,
[12:18.920 --> 12:24.920]  we're going to kill the president.
[12:24.920 --> 12:30.840]  Did I get a Newsweek retraction saying, okay, Alex Jones was dead on, but Newsweek knows
[12:30.840 --> 12:36.120]  full well that in the rant I did that they edited down and only took clips out of to
[12:36.120 --> 12:42.040]  make a video that I gave specifics of where they were saying it in quadruplicate.
[12:42.040 --> 12:47.560]  In that very breakdown, I gave four major leaders saying, we're getting ready to remove
[12:47.560 --> 12:53.320]  him and we're not talking about impeachment, sudden removal, physical removal, neutralization.
[12:53.320 --> 12:59.120]  Again, I don't want to make this about, see, I was right here, see, I was right there.
[12:59.120 --> 13:03.400]  You need to know why we're under attack because if our talking points get picked up early,
[13:03.400 --> 13:08.360]  so the folks finding out we're right a week later, a month later, a year later, 10 years
[13:08.360 --> 13:11.760]  later, the globalists don't have a hope or a prayer because I'm not that smart.
[13:11.760 --> 13:22.640]  Their operations are very key word, form you like, form you like.
[13:22.640 --> 13:25.840]  Looks like in the comedy movie, television nights, he makes his buddy always block the
[13:25.840 --> 13:32.880]  other car so he wins, he goes, shake and bake, form you like, you do this, you lose, I win.
[13:32.880 --> 13:37.320]  Form you like means all you need to add is milk to this pancake mix.
[13:37.320 --> 13:41.520]  It's already got the eggs, the flour, everything else is in there.
[13:41.520 --> 13:45.520]  You just add milk, stir it up, shake and bake.
[13:45.520 --> 13:50.680]  So I'm sitting here watching formulas, reading WikiLeaks where they say we're going to hype
[13:50.680 --> 13:57.000]  racial division, worldwide, religious division, Muslim against Muslim, Shiite against Sunni,
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.640]  Catholic against Orthodox, Jew against Arab, vice versa, and we're going to use that to
[14:02.640 --> 14:13.480]  control everybody so that when I see the very usual suspects doing it and carrying it out,
[14:13.480 --> 14:16.000]  I know what's going to happen.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.440]  I'm not smart.
[14:20.440 --> 14:24.880]  When I go fishing and I throw in an orange worm and I don't catch a bass, I go to another
[14:24.880 --> 14:25.880]  worm.
[14:25.880 --> 14:28.720]  Wow, they're biting on purple worms today with green tails.
[14:28.720 --> 14:30.360]  It's little things like that in life.
[14:30.360 --> 14:32.200]  Like, I'm going to put out supplements.
[14:32.200 --> 14:36.560]  I'm going to go find the biggest, best, highest quality, highest rated companies and get them
[14:36.560 --> 14:38.240]  to private label for me.
[14:38.240 --> 14:42.840]  That way I learn everything that they've done over 30, 40 years, get all their credibility,
[14:42.840 --> 14:45.560]  get all their quality under my name.
[14:45.560 --> 14:46.560]  Wow.
[14:46.560 --> 14:50.920]  And then the New York Times, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed wonders why our supplements
[14:50.920 --> 14:56.320]  are some of the top sellers in the country now and funding a revolution because I went
[14:56.320 --> 14:57.320]  to the quality.
[14:57.320 --> 15:00.200]  Now, I'm going to stop right there.
[15:00.200 --> 15:06.200]  It's just very frustrating to know we're right and to know we can stop these people.
[15:06.200 --> 15:12.200]  Julian Assange came out and said, you know, I wonder why the media is not covering that
[15:12.200 --> 15:18.360]  that our government funded white supremacists to actually burn down hundreds of buildings,
[15:18.360 --> 15:24.320]  kill thousands of people, shoot police by the hundreds and overthrow the elected government
[15:24.320 --> 15:26.520]  four years ago in Ukraine.
[15:26.520 --> 15:34.280]  And then they put in a Nazi government that actually hiles Hitler.
[15:34.280 --> 15:37.640]  The vice president, but it's beyond Hitler.
[15:37.640 --> 15:44.640]  They show women with electric bolts shooting out of their fingers.
[15:44.640 --> 15:50.520]  And then the leaders get up and literally say, hail their party and do the fascist salute.
[15:50.520 --> 15:56.440]  That's who our government put in, but because it's Obama doing it, it's cute.
[15:56.440 --> 16:00.160]  See, they got real Nazis in Ukraine folks.
[16:00.160 --> 16:05.080]  The West was occupied by the Germans in World War II because they invited them in.
[16:05.080 --> 16:08.040]  The East is mainly Orthodox and Russian.
[16:08.040 --> 16:11.160]  The West is Protestant and Christian.
[16:11.160 --> 16:13.720]  And so they invited the Nazis in.
[16:13.720 --> 16:27.280]  Well, our government overthrew the Ukrainian government and actually put real Nazis in.
[16:27.280 --> 16:30.160]  And that's what Assange is pointing out.
[16:30.160 --> 16:36.840]  He's saying, you think 50 white nationalists bumbling around and then Soros people show
[16:36.840 --> 16:39.640]  up and death ensues.
[16:39.640 --> 16:42.120]  This is just the media hyping us for division.
[16:42.120 --> 16:47.520]  If our government cared about fighting racism, it wouldn't have put literal, Hile Hitler
[16:47.520 --> 16:53.280]  Nazis in power overthrown a government.
[16:53.280 --> 17:00.320]  So reporter McKellway police were called off when violence started.
[17:00.320 --> 17:01.440]  They said, we're leaving.
[17:01.440 --> 17:04.280]  It's too dangerous.
[17:04.280 --> 17:07.000]  Here's the New York Times saying the same thing.
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.280]  Riot police open up the flashbang grenades and pepper spray as anti-fascist protesters
[17:11.280 --> 17:18.280]  who hit them with silly string as thousands gather in cities across America in solidarity.
[17:18.280 --> 17:22.000]  Yeah, the media mainstream media always makes the anti-fossil and good guys.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.080]  They throw urine, they throw feces, they throw bottles at you and all over the country they
[17:26.080 --> 17:29.400]  got beat up or arrested because there wasn't anybody there for them to protest.
[17:29.400 --> 17:34.920]  They came out to protest the police because remember, that's how the government started
[17:34.920 --> 17:39.960]  all these riots in the last five, six years funding Justice Department protests to go
[17:39.960 --> 17:44.840]  out and blame the police every time there's a questionable shooting and to make the anti-police
[17:44.840 --> 17:51.520]  stuff an anti-white thing to foment this giant race-based movement to then stir up what's
[17:51.520 --> 17:57.040]  left of white nationalists and people to get them back out on the streets to have a replay
[17:57.040 --> 17:59.720]  of the 1960s.
[17:59.720 --> 18:03.560]  And if you play along with this, if you're a white nationalist or a black nationalist
[18:03.560 --> 18:09.520]  or any of you people, you're morons.
[18:09.520 --> 18:18.920]  Now, let's go over some of this.
[18:18.920 --> 18:22.720]  This show for TV viewers, huge exhibit of fake news.
[18:22.720 --> 18:23.720]  This is CNN.
[18:23.720 --> 18:26.400]  I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[18:26.400 --> 18:32.860]  Here is the CNN headline, Saturday evening, Trump once again fails to condemn the alt-right
[18:32.860 --> 18:35.440]  white supremacist.
[18:35.440 --> 18:39.760]  Here is the tweet he put out, oh, they also had articles saying he responded slowly.
[18:39.760 --> 18:45.360]  He gave a press conference within two hours incredibly fast and he tweeted while it was
[18:45.360 --> 18:54.320]  going on, 12.19 noon, I mean, the thing started at like 11.30 Eastern.
[18:54.320 --> 18:57.480]  So there you go, Trump once again fails to condemn.
[18:57.480 --> 18:59.120]  Here's his actual tweet.
[18:59.120 --> 19:04.400]  We must all be united and condemn all that hate stands for.
[19:04.400 --> 19:07.080]  There is no place for this kind of violence in America.
[19:07.080 --> 19:10.440]  Let's come together as one.
[19:10.440 --> 19:11.720]  That's a Martin Luther King statement.
[19:11.720 --> 19:16.560]  A modern antifa, university statement is, whites are inherently bad, Western journalism
[19:16.560 --> 19:21.240]  is bad, culture is bad, free market is bad, kill the whites, don't let the whites go
[19:21.240 --> 19:23.920]  to school, whites are inherently bad.
[19:23.920 --> 19:28.800]  If your last name is Lynch, you're in trouble because that reminds us of lynching, change
[19:28.800 --> 19:34.800]  the names of buildings from Lynch, attack words, attack mother and father, attack families,
[19:34.800 --> 19:36.040]  attack culture.
[19:36.040 --> 19:41.200]  It's just a bunch of people wanting power, running around, finding new things to be upset
[19:41.200 --> 19:42.200]  about.
[19:42.200 --> 19:50.520]  So here's CNN caught in massive, massive, massive, massive fake news and the very same
[19:50.520 --> 19:57.080]  CNN said, Jones claims the police stood down, Jones claims Soros funds these groups, Jones
[19:57.080 --> 19:59.480]  claims that the antifa is hateful.
[19:59.480 --> 20:05.240]  In fact, they had the Homeland Security spokesman on CNN Sunday.
[20:05.240 --> 20:09.760]  I played the clip yesterday on the Sunday show and he was saying, well, obviously both
[20:09.760 --> 20:13.920]  groups came looking for trouble, but we condemn all the hate, we condemn the white supremacist
[20:13.920 --> 20:19.080]  and the host goes, Jake Tapper, he goes, you don't condemn the white supremacist and just
[20:19.080 --> 20:27.400]  kept saying it, saying it like his viewers are crazy because they're just totally beside
[20:27.400 --> 20:32.680]  themselves wanting racial and cultural division.
[20:32.680 --> 20:38.640]  So there's their fake news and of course it was George Soros' birthday on Saturday.
[20:38.640 --> 20:40.280]  We should add that.
[20:40.280 --> 20:41.280]  Here's Julian Assange.
[20:41.280 --> 20:48.400]  Julian Assange asked why the US said nothing when Obama supported Ukrainian neo-Nazis.
[20:48.400 --> 20:53.160]  Julian Assange is a bigger picture behind America's hypocrisy and double standards.
[20:53.160 --> 20:54.160]  They use race.
[20:54.160 --> 20:55.800]  It's not double standards.
[20:55.800 --> 21:01.200]  They're using cultural differences, religious, ethnic, geographic.
[21:01.200 --> 21:05.360]  It's standard Roman divide and conquer.
[21:05.360 --> 21:06.600]  So that's some of the news on that front.
[21:06.600 --> 21:18.200]  I wanted to show you what Paul said last year on November 22nd, just right after the election.
[21:18.200 --> 21:20.600]  He said there are two alt-rights.
[21:20.600 --> 21:25.480]  One is more accurately described as the new right, that that's the name or the real right.
[21:25.480 --> 21:29.880]  These people like to wear, make America great hats, create memes and have fun.
[21:29.880 --> 21:33.000]  They include whites, blacks, Asians, Latinos, gays, everyone else.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.240]  These are the people who helped Trump win the election.
[21:35.240 --> 21:41.320]  The other faction likes to fester in dark corners of subreddits and obsess about Jews,
[21:41.320 --> 21:44.200]  racial superiority and all Hitler.
[21:44.200 --> 21:46.080]  This is a huge fringe minority.
[21:46.080 --> 21:47.880]  They have no impact on the election.
[21:47.880 --> 21:52.400]  Guess which faction the media is giving all the attention to.
[21:52.400 --> 21:54.960]  And that sums every bit of it up.
[21:54.960 --> 22:01.840]  If you want a Rosetta Stone, a key to understand this, what are they going to do when they
[22:01.840 --> 22:05.680]  tried to say the Tea Party was racist and tried to make minorities feel like they couldn't
[22:05.680 --> 22:08.160]  be part of free market and prosperity.
[22:08.160 --> 22:09.880]  They failed under Trump.
[22:09.880 --> 22:15.200]  They sent mobs of people, women and minorities, it's in the WikiLeaks, to try to get beat
[22:15.200 --> 22:17.800]  up on camera to make Trump look racist.
[22:17.800 --> 22:20.160]  It didn't fully work.
[22:20.160 --> 22:24.560]  Record numbers of Hispanics and blacks voted for Trump and the system goes, what are we
[22:24.560 --> 22:25.560]  going to do?
[22:25.560 --> 22:28.680]  We're going to invoke race as hardcore as we can.
[22:28.680 --> 22:34.040]  And if Donald Trump divorced his wife and married a black lady, if Donald Trump would
[22:34.040 --> 22:39.680]  have shot the guy that ran over the poor lady in Charlottesville, they would have said the
[22:39.680 --> 22:43.480]  caliber of the gun wasn't big enough or something.
[22:43.480 --> 22:48.600]  And that's a statement from Mike Huckabee on Fox.
[22:48.600 --> 22:49.600]  We'll play that clip later.
[22:49.600 --> 22:50.840]  It's totally true.
[22:50.840 --> 22:54.680]  The article's up on infowars.com.
[22:54.680 --> 22:56.120]  So that's what they're doing.
[22:56.120 --> 22:59.880]  And we've got all that linked up on the new site we've launched that loads really quick
[22:59.880 --> 23:00.880]  and is really clean.
[23:00.880 --> 23:03.720]  We're about to add a lot of new features to it very, very soon.
[23:03.720 --> 23:09.600]  And that's news wars, newswars.com, chronicling the ongoing news wars.
[23:09.600 --> 23:12.600]  A lot of content there that's exclusive.
[23:12.600 --> 23:16.520]  The New Yorker magazine came out over the weekend and said that they are planning to
[23:16.520 --> 23:21.040]  forcibly remove Trump in the next two months, exactly as they've been saying in other statements.
[23:21.040 --> 23:23.040]  But this is more crystallized.
[23:23.040 --> 23:30.520]  And the article is up on newswars.com, it is an exclusive article and is very, very important.
[23:30.520 --> 23:34.200]  Newswars.com is a lot less of a big site.
[23:34.200 --> 23:36.520]  That is, it's not as graphic, it's more clean.
[23:36.520 --> 23:37.520]  It loads very, very quickly.
[23:37.520 --> 23:40.840]  We're going to redesign info wars similar to this in the near future.
[23:40.840 --> 23:41.840]  But there is newswars.com.
[23:41.840 --> 23:47.440]  We're also going to launch a meme site that'll have contributors, but also a big posting
[23:47.440 --> 23:49.440]  area for you on the front page.
[23:49.440 --> 23:54.760]  A little bit of post right to the front page and feeds of our own memes and material and
[23:54.760 --> 23:55.760]  comedy.
[23:55.760 --> 23:58.760]  I'm going to really not have any comedy on this broadcast because the media always takes
[23:58.760 --> 23:59.760]  it and says it's serious.
[23:59.760 --> 24:03.720]  I'm going to have to start doing it under, I think, even a gnome diploma or a pen name
[24:03.720 --> 24:08.600]  so that we can have the comedy, have the satire, but be totally clear that it's on a whole
[24:08.600 --> 24:10.400]  separate platform.
[24:10.400 --> 24:12.320]  Comedy will be done there.
[24:12.320 --> 24:14.240]  Pure seriousness will be done here.
[24:14.240 --> 24:18.640]  You notice I used to do comedy maybe once every couple of weeks, I don't do it anymore
[24:18.640 --> 24:24.080]  because there's a lot of really dumbed down people and the media takes it and then says
[24:24.080 --> 24:26.520]  that this is what we really believe.
[24:26.520 --> 24:30.320]  And I understand they're not going to stop doing that, but it'll be even clearer that
[24:30.320 --> 24:36.200]  it's all on that platform and I'll be doing it under pure characters in costume so that
[24:36.200 --> 24:40.000]  it's very hard for them to misrepresent it to their victim viewers.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.920]  If you are a mainstream TV viewer or reader, you are a victim.
[24:43.920 --> 24:45.080]  They are victimizing you.
[24:45.080 --> 24:49.120]  They are predatory, again, their own WikiLeaks admit all of that.
[24:49.120 --> 24:55.280]  Meanwhile, we're all fighting over the complete synthetic garbage of a couple hundred black
[24:55.280 --> 24:59.960]  people being possibly killed wrong every year by police.
[24:59.960 --> 25:03.660]  We have thousands being killed every year by other black people in Chicago and nothing
[25:03.660 --> 25:05.160]  being said about it.
[25:05.160 --> 25:09.400]  And again, they took all that, made it racial, made it that white people wanted to kill black
[25:09.400 --> 25:15.360]  people, exploded the myth, created incredible class division in America, and then wonder
[25:15.360 --> 25:21.760]  why tiny groups of white people began behaving like the brainwashed leftist whites that are
[25:21.760 --> 25:25.680]  communists trained at the universities who know what they're doing.
[25:25.680 --> 25:28.560]  They teach in the classes how they're doing it.
[25:28.560 --> 25:35.180]  They're invoking racial consciousness in the minority groups for racial conflict.
[25:35.180 --> 25:43.360]  They are the ultimate, David Duke couldn't do one one hundredth of what CNN and MSNBC
[25:43.360 --> 25:44.360]  have done.
[25:44.360 --> 25:49.600]  Just like they funded the Arab Spring, they pushed that, they pushed the Ukraine overthrow
[25:49.600 --> 25:51.840]  using Nazis.
[25:51.840 --> 25:53.480]  They know they're doing it.
[25:53.480 --> 25:58.160]  They're a hundred percent, Jake Tapper, all these people know.
[25:58.160 --> 26:00.560]  They sit in meetings, they've got scripts.
[26:00.560 --> 26:05.600]  They're hardcore evil, evil, evil people.
[26:05.600 --> 26:08.720]  And you've got to understand that.
[26:08.720 --> 26:09.720]  It's the bottom line.
[26:09.720 --> 26:13.680]  And they're trying to invoke this because North Korea can launch missiles at any time
[26:13.680 --> 26:14.680]  at Guam.
[26:14.680 --> 26:15.680]  Trump could respond.
[26:15.680 --> 26:16.680]  It could go to nuclear war.
[26:16.680 --> 26:20.320]  Top analysts are in the news today saying this could be the beginning of World War III
[26:20.320 --> 26:24.360]  and Russia and China need to get behind the US striking North Korea because North Korea
[26:24.360 --> 26:27.760]  is genuinely out of control now.
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.200]  The Rothschilds helped set up modern China, helped us put Mao Zedong in.
[26:32.200 --> 26:38.200]  Now Lord Rothschild, richest man on earth, has come out and said North Korea needs regime
[26:38.200 --> 26:39.200]  change.
[26:39.200 --> 26:42.360]  Elite Makers speaks out on US-North Korean conflict.
[26:42.360 --> 26:49.480]  Now I don't want to sit and agree with Lord Rothschild, but I mean Kim Jong-un has nuclear
[26:49.480 --> 26:56.720]  weapons, has missiles, and is completely out of his mind.
[26:56.720 --> 26:57.880]  Kim Jong-il was not.
[26:57.880 --> 26:58.880]  His father was not.
[26:58.880 --> 27:03.840]  This is a real rogue regime that we appeased that our governments gave nuclear weapons
[27:03.840 --> 27:04.840]  to.
[27:04.840 --> 27:11.560]  The Clintons, again, you know about evil, nuclear weapons, missiles to deliver it, that's the
[27:11.560 --> 27:17.320]  globalist who caused the Arab Spring that killed over a million people, the globalist
[27:17.320 --> 27:19.240]  who is funding and financing all this.
[27:19.240 --> 27:26.200]  I want to go out to break before we have this flotilla of amazing guests today with a clip
[27:26.200 --> 27:36.960]  of reporter for Fox News, Doug McKellway, breaking down exactly what Millie Weaver and our reporters
[27:36.960 --> 27:41.360]  reported in the video we saw and what we covered first on Saturday and Sunday.
[27:41.360 --> 27:43.280]  Now here's the difference.
[27:43.280 --> 27:46.040]  He was there live, reported this too.
[27:46.040 --> 27:51.720]  Fox is as bad as CNN and MSNBC now, pushing the narrative, acting like the white supremacists
[27:51.720 --> 27:55.360]  started it all, acting like anti-far, a bunch of angels.
[27:55.360 --> 27:59.000]  When I watched that Saturday and Sunday, it was shocking.
[27:59.000 --> 28:04.040]  Now they're not as bad today because people didn't buy it, but this is real deception
[28:04.040 --> 28:08.720]  and they tried to act like the president didn't care because he pointed out that both sides
[28:08.720 --> 28:09.720]  were being bad.
[28:09.720 --> 28:14.320]  And I just showed you CNN saying he would not condemn it.
[28:14.320 --> 28:20.920]  When word for word, he condemned all hate and all racism, word for word, and they won't
[28:20.920 --> 28:25.480]  and he said it in his statement, but they would have edited pieces saying, look, he
[28:25.480 --> 28:27.360]  never said it and only show part.
[28:27.360 --> 28:30.800]  That is incredible deception.
[28:30.800 --> 28:33.320]  That is unprecedented lying.
[28:33.320 --> 28:35.040]  That is dangerous.
[28:35.040 --> 28:36.240]  They are bad people.
[28:36.240 --> 28:44.000]  They're not just ha ha CNN, you know, the idiots, they're evil, they're liars, they are systematically
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  evil.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.440]  Let's go to the clip.
[28:47.440 --> 28:52.920]  We are now beginning to hear criticism bubble up on all sides of this event about the initial
[28:52.920 --> 28:55.480]  slow response by the police.
[28:55.480 --> 28:58.920]  When I got out of my car yesterday in Charlottesville for the first time at about 10.30 yesterday
[28:58.920 --> 29:03.240]  morning, you knew this was a bad scene and that bad things were going to be happening
[29:03.240 --> 29:08.640]  because people were congregating at Lee Park, at Emancipation Park, wearing helmets, body
[29:08.640 --> 29:11.920]  armor, carrying big, heavy sticks.
[29:11.920 --> 29:14.800]  Nobody was intent upon peace here from either side.
[29:14.800 --> 29:19.200]  People were intent on causing havoc and causing damage and even as wounded were being brought
[29:19.200 --> 29:22.040]  out of the park, the police were sitting idly by.
[29:22.040 --> 29:26.760]  I was standing by a cordoned off area where the police had set up as a staging area.
[29:26.760 --> 29:29.040]  The state police had set up and they said, you can come in here.
[29:29.040 --> 29:30.480]  This is a safe area.
[29:30.480 --> 29:35.400]  But when the tear gas started to fly thrown by protesters, the police themselves began
[29:35.400 --> 29:36.400]  to evacuate that.
[29:36.400 --> 29:38.720]  I asked the guy who was in charge said, where are you going?
[29:38.720 --> 29:40.080]  He said, we're leaving.
[29:40.080 --> 29:41.080]  It's too dangerous.
[29:41.080 --> 29:45.600]  They had an opportunity to nip this thing in the bud and they chose not to.
[29:45.600 --> 29:49.080]  They stood down and that's the only truthful officer for us all.
[29:49.080 --> 29:59.440]  The Empires on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.440 --> 30:03.160]  What exactly is political correctness and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[30:03.160 --> 30:07.480]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government
[30:07.480 --> 30:09.320]  uses to control public opinion.
[30:09.320 --> 30:13.400]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda,
[30:13.400 --> 30:18.560]  but to also ensure that your government created viewpoint also influences others in ripple effect.
[30:18.560 --> 30:20.960]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[30:20.960 --> 30:25.000]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple, and over
[30:25.000 --> 30:28.520]  time we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[30:28.520 --> 30:31.760]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[30:31.760 --> 30:35.600]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying
[30:35.600 --> 30:40.600]  to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth, such as
[30:40.600 --> 30:42.120]  global warming, for example.
[30:42.120 --> 30:46.720]  Then the establishment suppresses any counterarguments through their agenda by calling critics kooky,
[30:46.720 --> 30:51.280]  nut jobs, racists, or in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[30:51.280 --> 30:55.920]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at infowars.com, PrismPlanet.tv,
[30:55.920 --> 30:57.800]  and our YouTube channel, Resistance Moves.
[30:57.800 --> 30:59.360]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[30:59.360 --> 31:01.240]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[31:01.240 --> 31:03.240]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:03.240 --> 31:06.120]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:06.120 --> 31:12.160]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:12.160 --> 31:17.120]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[31:17.120 --> 31:22.080]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[31:22.080 --> 31:27.200]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[31:27.200 --> 31:28.920]  you can to purify your air.
[31:28.920 --> 31:33.920]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:33.920 --> 31:36.920]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[31:36.920 --> 31:39.120]  The general public doesn't.
[31:39.120 --> 31:43.080]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:43.080 --> 31:46.680]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:46.680 --> 31:50.240]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[31:50.240 --> 31:53.440]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:53.440 --> 31:59.280]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today in M4WareStore.com.

[32:18.280 --> 32:21.920]  when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[32:21.920 --> 32:27.080]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like OQ10,
[32:27.080 --> 32:31.920]  systematic enzymes, NAR, lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many others.
[32:31.920 --> 32:37.160]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies, and just one batch of

[32:56.400 --> 32:57.400]  That's M4WareStore.com.
[32:57.400 --> 32:58.400]  Don't know much about history.
[32:58.400 --> 32:59.400]  Don't know much about biology.
[32:59.400 --> 33:00.400]  Don't know much about a science book.
[33:00.400 --> 33:01.400]  Don't know much about the French I took.
[33:01.400 --> 33:25.400]  But I do know that I love you, and I know that if you loved me too, world around the
[33:25.400 --> 33:32.720]  poor this would be.
[33:32.720 --> 33:36.400]  Don't know much about geography.
[33:36.400 --> 33:37.400]  Don't know much about trigonometry.
[33:37.400 --> 33:41.360]  Don't know much about George Soros and racial destabilization, do you?
[33:41.360 --> 33:46.040]  Don't know much about being a schmuck or being con or being a sucker, being a duke, being
[33:46.040 --> 33:50.320]  a useful idiot, being a pawn, being a minion.
[33:50.320 --> 33:54.160]  By the way, Fox News has caught it at another press conference.
[33:54.160 --> 33:55.160]  They just said it during the break.
[33:55.160 --> 34:01.480]  I was getting some extra coffee and they were saying this gives him a chance to come out and actually condemn the racism
[34:01.480 --> 34:05.320]  He didn't do that last time even Fox was just doing
[34:05.800 --> 34:09.880]  What CNN did when he clearly condemned it is that we should love each other and
[34:10.760 --> 34:12.760]  We should come together and
[34:13.560 --> 34:19.160]  That he condemns all racism. I showed you the tweets. I've played the video for TV viewers
[34:19.160 --> 34:25.240]  Here it is. This is CNN headline Trump once again fails to condemn the alt-right white supremacist CNN
[34:25.880 --> 34:29.240]  Right here. This is 12 19 in the middle of the melee
[34:29.560 --> 34:35.480]  We all must be united and condemn all that hate stands for there is no place for this kind of violence in America
[34:35.720 --> 34:37.720]  Let's come together as one
[34:39.560 --> 34:44.120]  I cannot think of a better statement than that and that very same CNN article
[34:44.120 --> 34:51.560]  They play an edited clip of him only saying violence on both sides and not saying I condemn racism of any kind
[34:51.800 --> 34:54.040]  And we almost come together. They even edit that
[34:55.160 --> 34:58.680]  They are so despicable, but even fox which is
[35:00.200 --> 35:05.080]  The globals are taken over so they have you know, they've they're getting rid of everybody at fox
[35:05.640 --> 35:10.360]  You can see it on the shows. They are just very quickly now turning into CNN
[35:10.360 --> 35:12.360]  I
[35:12.600 --> 35:15.960]  Walked in this morning and airman bring was just shaking his head and he said you want to see fox now
[35:15.960 --> 35:19.480]  And I said no, I've been watching and he goes. It's incredible. It's as bad as CNN
[35:20.200 --> 35:22.280]  But they're still like people like hannah dear
[35:24.040 --> 35:30.760]  People like Doug McKellway that will actually tell you what they saw just like we reported the police said
[35:30.840 --> 35:32.280]  We've been ordered to stand down
[35:32.280 --> 35:38.200]  You've got to leave and then forced our reporters through the gauntlet. We reported that it's even barely on the audio
[35:38.200 --> 35:44.680]  There's all the screaming you can hear the cops telling me we ever that the videos up on info wars calm and what is time magazine?
[35:44.680 --> 35:48.840]  What is news week? What is the washington time say they say i'm a liar
[35:49.720 --> 35:55.400]  The police didn't stand down. Oh the mayor michael singer. He didn't stand down. Oh
[35:55.960 --> 35:59.000]  Alex has a conspiracy theory that people stand down
[35:59.880 --> 36:05.560]  Remember in baltimore, maryland. It came out the police were ordered to stand down to get the riots going
[36:05.560 --> 36:12.440]  Then another person dies in custody and then there's more riots and then they were ordered to stand down in all these different cities
[36:13.080 --> 36:19.240]  That are democrat control so they can get the riot going so they can give antifa a chance to feel emboldened
[36:19.480 --> 36:24.600]  To be more violent nationwide and to let them know you can attack people and nothing will happen
[36:25.640 --> 36:27.640]  until somebody
[36:27.640 --> 36:29.640]  Drives a car into the crowd
[36:29.640 --> 36:34.280]  Is what they did right? Absolutely not. Is it right to hit somebody in the head with a bike?
[36:34.280 --> 36:36.280]  Lock that can kill them. No
[36:36.840 --> 36:42.840]  Is it synthetic? I don't know but the whole atmosphere the whole background is
[36:43.560 --> 36:45.560]  synthetic
[36:45.560 --> 36:53.240]  And it's all selling the idea should we allow assemblies anymore of the alt right and they take the term alt right that hillary and
[36:53.240 --> 36:55.240]  Podesta created nine months ago
[36:56.600 --> 37:00.280]  And call everybody that supports freedom and low taxes and sovereignty
[37:00.280 --> 37:05.000]  And who cares about our veterans and who cares about religious freedom who doesn't want radical islam taking over
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.040]  That's the alt right. She says and then they define alt right as the nazis
[37:12.040 --> 37:17.000]  And we predicted that was coming and that's exactly what they're doing and it's how they operate
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.080]  Let's play a clip from doug mckelway. Who was there?
[37:21.720 --> 37:27.560]  I think in causing damage and even as wounded were being brought out of the park the police were sitting idly by
[37:27.560 --> 37:33.560]  I was standing by a cordoned off area where the police had set up as a staging area the state police had set up and they said
[37:33.560 --> 37:35.560]  You can come in here. This is a safe area
[37:35.560 --> 37:43.560]  But when the tear gas started to fly thrown by protesters, the police themselves began to evacuate that I asked the guy who was in charge said
[37:43.560 --> 37:50.280]  Where are you going? He said we're leaving. It's too dangerous. They had an opportunity to nip this thing in the bud and they chose not to
[37:51.080 --> 37:53.080]  So that's right after the riot started
[37:53.080 --> 37:58.200]  We're still ongoing. That's right when trump had already tweeted saying he absolutely decries any form of racism
[37:58.200 --> 38:01.800]  We've all got to come together. We've got to love each other because none of us say
[38:02.200 --> 38:07.400]  You know racism is bad if you're not going to be racist if you're going to be racist just be racist and just be that way
[38:08.200 --> 38:09.720]  But if you're going to
[38:09.720 --> 38:17.720]  Come together love each other and love our good attributes and love our cultures and come together about what we stand for and what we produce
[38:18.680 --> 38:20.680]  As I've said a thousand times
[38:20.680 --> 38:24.760]  If you've got the best taste in food, I don't care if you're black Asian Hispanic white
[38:25.560 --> 38:30.680]  If you got good food and you're nice, I'm gonna come over there. It's like I don't care what color you are. You good-looking woman
[38:30.680 --> 38:35.240]  You're nice. I'm not married. Whatever. I the beauty comes in all shapes and sizes and colors
[38:35.720 --> 38:40.040]  But if you've got a chip on your shoulder and attitude problem, I don't like you care. What color you are?
[38:41.960 --> 38:46.600]  It's the same thing for music. I like white music black music fusion music
[38:46.600 --> 38:52.680]  I don't like the way wild sound and kind of new modern Arabic music sounds mixed in with the old-fashioned and the new
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  That's some wild stuff
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.960]  I got one of those channels on my uh on my iPhone. I'll be listening to weird Middle Eastern music
[39:00.920 --> 39:05.960]  Kurdish music because I like it, but I don't want to be told. I'm inherently back as I'm white
[39:06.440 --> 39:13.720]  That's complete racism and that's what's pushed on the colleges to create the white backlash to create the segregation
[39:13.720 --> 39:21.080]  To create the Balkanization to create the control. Let's put it back on screen again. Fox news CNN. They're all getting ready for another speech
[39:22.120 --> 39:26.760]  Trump could come out and say, you know, he wants to execute anybody that's uh, no, he's
[39:27.720 --> 39:29.720]  He's he's talking now. Let's go to the president for
[39:30.600 --> 39:38.600]  Companies are moving back to the United States and bringing many thousands of jobs. He hijacks their race baiting to bring us together around the economy
[39:39.240 --> 39:41.240]  There's to be better
[39:41.240 --> 39:43.240]  Million jobs
[39:43.480 --> 39:45.480]  Since I took office
[39:46.120 --> 39:48.120]  We will be discussing
[39:48.200 --> 39:52.120]  Economic issues in greater detail later this afternoon. I love how he hijacks it
[39:52.120 --> 39:56.520]  But based on the events that took place over the weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia
[39:57.400 --> 40:00.680]  I would like to provide the nation with an update
[40:01.720 --> 40:06.760]  On the ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence
[40:06.760 --> 40:10.520]  That was witnessed by everyone
[40:11.160 --> 40:14.520]  I just met with fbi director christopher ray
[40:15.320 --> 40:17.480]  An attorney general jeff sessions
[40:18.120 --> 40:22.120]  The department of justice has opened a civil rights investigation
[40:22.920 --> 40:26.120]  Into the deadly car attack that killed one innocent
[40:27.080 --> 40:29.080]  american
[40:29.080 --> 40:31.080]  And wounded 20 others
[40:31.640 --> 40:33.640]  To anyone who acted criminally in this case
[40:33.640 --> 40:37.640]  To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence
[40:38.440 --> 40:40.920]  You will be held fully accountable
[40:41.960 --> 40:43.960]  Justice will be delivered
[40:44.920 --> 40:46.920]  As I said on saturday
[40:47.160 --> 40:51.000]  We condemn in the strongest possible terms
[40:51.560 --> 40:55.320]  This egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence
[40:55.960 --> 40:59.160]  It has no place in america
[40:59.640 --> 41:02.120]  And as I have said many times before
[41:02.120 --> 41:04.120]  No matter the color of our skin
[41:04.680 --> 41:07.080]  We all live under the same laws
[41:07.720 --> 41:11.400]  We all salute the same great flag
[41:12.360 --> 41:17.160]  And we are all made by the same almighty god
[41:18.600 --> 41:21.880]  We must love each other show affection for each other
[41:22.360 --> 41:25.880]  And unite together in condemnation of hatred
[41:26.440 --> 41:28.440]  Bigotry and violence
[41:28.440 --> 41:31.720]  We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty
[41:32.280 --> 41:34.280]  That bring us together as americans
[41:35.080 --> 41:37.080]  Racism is evil
[41:37.240 --> 41:41.240]  And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs
[41:41.480 --> 41:43.480]  Including the kkk
[41:43.720 --> 41:45.720]  Neo-nazis white supremacists
[41:46.360 --> 41:48.360]  And other hate groups
[41:48.360 --> 41:52.360]  That are repugnant to everything we hold dear as americans
[41:53.160 --> 41:56.120]  We are a nation founded on the truth
[41:56.120 --> 41:58.680]  That all of us are created equal
[41:59.320 --> 42:01.320]  We are equal in the eyes of our creator
[42:02.040 --> 42:04.040]  We are equal under the law
[42:04.600 --> 42:08.600]  And we are equal under our constitution
[42:09.400 --> 42:12.600]  Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  Strike at the very core of america
[42:16.200 --> 42:18.200]  Two days ago a young american woman
[42:18.760 --> 42:20.760]  Heather Hayer was tragically killed
[42:21.720 --> 42:23.720]  Her death fills us with hatred
[42:23.720 --> 42:25.720]  And we send her family our thoughts
[42:26.360 --> 42:28.360]  Our prayers and our love
[42:29.160 --> 42:31.160]  We also mourn
[42:31.160 --> 42:35.160]  The two virginia state troopers who died in service to their community
[42:35.160 --> 42:37.160]  Their commonwealth and their country
[42:37.800 --> 42:41.000]  Troopers jay cullen and berkbates
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.960]  Exemplify the very best of america
[42:44.520 --> 42:46.520]  And our hearts go out to their families
[42:46.520 --> 42:50.520]  Their friends and every member of american law
[42:50.520 --> 42:54.520]  Enforcement
[42:55.320 --> 42:59.240]  These three fallen americans embody the goodness and decency
[42:59.960 --> 43:01.960]  Of our nation
[43:01.960 --> 43:03.960]  In times such as these
[43:03.960 --> 43:07.640]  America has always shown its true character
[43:08.120 --> 43:10.120]  Responding to hate with love
[43:10.760 --> 43:16.360]  Division with unity and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice
[43:16.360 --> 43:20.760]  As a candidate i promise to restore a law and order to our country
[43:21.320 --> 43:26.120]  And our federal law enforcement agencies are following through on that pledge
[43:27.160 --> 43:35.160]  We will spare no resource in fighting so that every american child can grow up free from violence and fear
[43:35.640 --> 43:42.120]  We will defend and protect the sacred rights of all americans and we will work together
[43:42.120 --> 43:51.720]  So that every citizen in this blessed land is free to follow their dreams in their hearts and to express the love
[43:52.280 --> 43:53.640]  and joy
[43:53.640 --> 43:55.400]  in their souls
[43:55.400 --> 43:56.680]  Thank you
[43:56.680 --> 43:59.960]  God bless you and god bless america. Thank you very much
[44:03.800 --> 44:10.360]  All right, that was president trump alive at the white house, uh for the first time hearing from him specifically calling out
[44:10.360 --> 44:11.560]  Go back
[44:11.560 --> 44:17.960]  The kkk neo nazis saying we must unite against hatred bigotry and violence
[44:18.680 --> 44:22.280]  It was unexpected that these remarks would be coming from the white house so quickly
[44:23.000 --> 44:27.000]  He said he said hate on all sides last time he had to mention every group
[44:27.480 --> 44:31.720]  So that's had to keep spinning and even fox see right before they went on he hasn't condemned it
[44:31.880 --> 44:37.640]  He didn't condemn it. So so we've got uh, it's the lies of these people, but here's the big takeaway
[44:37.640 --> 44:44.680]  And this isn't rhetoric. This isn't think about this the mayor the dirt bag globalist social engineer
[44:45.320 --> 44:49.480]  Literally under soros and hillary's control 80 of the town voted for hillary
[44:50.280 --> 44:52.280]  michael singer
[44:52.680 --> 44:54.680]  Ordered the police stand down
[44:55.080 --> 44:57.080]  And the blood is on his hands
[44:57.800 --> 45:03.800]  And the police who a lot of times aren't the villain folks say they are the villain. They were villains at the
[45:03.800 --> 45:12.280]  Inauguration I was there watching women and children and men beat up by tens of thousands of thugs at the entrances to the mall
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  I couldn't get in for hours
[45:17.880 --> 45:20.280]  And the police sat there and watched it
[45:21.480 --> 45:24.280]  Because they were run by the democrat dirt bags
[45:25.000 --> 45:30.440]  So yeah, the police are definitely bad in democrat cities. They are 100 bad
[45:30.440 --> 45:36.360]  And that's been my experience. It's always democrat cities where the cops are drug dealers and corrupt like chicago
[45:36.520 --> 45:38.520]  Not all of them, but a lot of them
[45:38.600 --> 45:40.600]  And it's the same thing in these dirt bag towns
[45:41.240 --> 45:48.040]  Where the big city machine runs things the police stand down. They let the thug communist attack people. It's what they do
[45:49.240 --> 45:52.760]  And they're despicable that mayor is despicable
[45:53.880 --> 45:59.880]  Even in seattle when the antifa attacked the cops, they did something antifa even attacked cops in charlotte charlottesville
[45:59.880 --> 46:01.640]  They did nothing
[46:01.640 --> 46:03.640]  They followed their criminal orders
[46:04.600 --> 46:11.640]  And it's despicable to protect and a a group that calls for their own murder
[46:14.760 --> 46:21.000]  See the police are being used as pawns and all this like they're the reason there's racism in america or that cops inherently are all bad
[46:21.080 --> 46:23.560]  When most of them are just working a job a tough job
[46:24.680 --> 46:26.360]  But I tell you
[46:26.360 --> 46:33.160]  It's true. I've been in these democrat cities and I've witnessed it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
[46:34.120 --> 46:36.520]  And that virginia state trooper thing is real weird
[46:37.240 --> 46:42.760]  How do you know some antifa anti cop groups didn't shoot that helicopter out of the sky with a machine gun or something?
[46:42.840 --> 46:48.200]  And it's being covered up because they want to use this as much as they can to demonize the libertarian
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.640]  constitutional movements nationwide and worldwide now milley weaver's been holding for 15 minutes because we had that
[46:53.640 --> 46:57.240]  Trump announcement we're going to go to her in just a moment, but first off

[48:02.760 --> 48:04.760]  And that we have the very best deal in the world
[48:05.160 --> 48:11.160]  Buzzfeed tried to attack us and said totally clean california standards and we sell the number one
[48:11.640 --> 48:13.640]  b12 in the world
[48:13.640 --> 48:21.340]  Their analysis had to admit okay, it's true. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[48:22.360 --> 48:28.120]  Excuse me. It's hilarious. They didn't know that part. So they said this is the best b12 example 35 dollars
[48:28.280 --> 48:34.520]  There's this just pure b12 totally clean, but it should be uh, you know a lot less when ours was 1776 and theirs was 35
[48:34.600 --> 48:39.880]  The exact same one private labeled by us. Oh boy, that's delicious. The irony of that is incredible

[54:54.520 --> 54:57.440]  updates and Millie Weaver all right shotgun with this little bit in the
[54:57.440 --> 55:00.760]  next hour mr. Haban all right shotgun in the next hour as well we've got a
[55:00.760 --> 55:05.960]  flotilla of guests but Millie totally vindicated Fox News reporter was there
[55:05.960 --> 55:10.640]  he said the police were ordered to stand down that they are responsible for not
[55:10.640 --> 55:15.640]  doing their duty I mean it's their duty to do that they didn't obviously because
[55:15.640 --> 55:18.760]  the Democrat mayor ordered them to this has been the ongoing pattern in
[55:18.760 --> 55:22.680]  Democrat cities you got pepper sprayed Gavin got pepper sprayed now they're
[55:22.680 --> 55:26.080]  trying to blame Trump saying he didn't respond strong enough I think he
[55:26.080 --> 55:31.160]  certainly did and they're they're guilty of fake news yet again well you know
[55:31.160 --> 55:37.040]  Alex I'm 100% convinced now after hearing the mainstream media coverage
[55:37.040 --> 55:44.400]  hearing Trump's response to it that this 100% was a deep-state operation it was
[55:44.400 --> 55:49.160]  essentially a trap now I'm sure the original people who planned this unite
[55:49.160 --> 55:56.600]  the right rally protest had did so with with a good intention so to speak and I
[55:56.600 --> 56:01.520]  do think some of the more extremist elements on the right kind of hijacked
[56:01.520 --> 56:08.000]  that jumped on board but all in all the mayor the government officials the
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.000]  police the mainstream media was hyping this event up prior to it even happening
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.680]  encouraging elements on the extreme left to come out antifa black lives matter
[56:17.680 --> 56:22.920]  and it was essentially a trap because as soon as the police and everyone were
[56:22.920 --> 56:26.520]  there the police stood down they didn't do their job they did not keep the piece
[56:26.520 --> 56:31.960]  it almost reminded me of that movie the purge because it was all out anarchy and
[56:31.960 --> 56:37.720]  could you imagine if a city mayor just decided I just decided to say that the
[56:37.720 --> 56:42.000]  police can stand down all today and all crime can be committed and we're just
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.840]  gonna stand out and watch it that's essentially what they did here at this
[56:45.840 --> 56:51.720]  protest and it was pretty terrifying and I will say this you know the media is
[56:51.720 --> 56:58.560]  saying and blaming all of the violence on the right side on the alt right side
[56:58.560 --> 57:05.760]  and the racist bigot white supremacist but in actuality I was there a lot of
[57:05.760 --> 57:11.200]  people that were there witnessed that the antifa came out and they committed a
[57:11.200 --> 57:16.440]  violence now the people on the alt right side they had big some of them had
[57:16.440 --> 57:22.600]  bigoted views and people on the new right or Trump supporters have all said
[57:22.600 --> 57:25.760]  that this is horrible we do not agree with racism we do not agree with their
[57:25.760 --> 57:29.880]  beliefs but all in all this is just being used to try and demonize Trump
[57:29.880 --> 57:35.680]  supporters and demonize republicans and people that are on the right or slightly
[57:35.680 --> 57:39.800]  right of center so that they can continue this narrative of right wing
[57:39.800 --> 57:45.120]  homegrown terrorism and that's really what this is all about it's just going
[57:45.120 --> 57:50.280]  to be a way to infringe on our right to peaceful protest as you can see in
[57:50.280 --> 57:54.680]  Seattle they were able to have a protest there and it didn't get out of hand why
[57:54.680 --> 57:58.880]  because the police stepped in and they did their jobs if you watch the the
[57:58.880 --> 58:04.080]  retaliation protests the march against hate and Nazis in Seattle that happened
[58:04.080 --> 58:09.920]  the day after Charlottesville you can see that it was for the most part contained
[58:09.920 --> 58:13.920]  because the police did their jobs they didn't stand down they didn't allow chaos
[58:13.920 --> 58:19.600]  to happen and the antifa were clashing violently with the police spraying them
[58:19.600 --> 58:24.240]  with silly spray in their riot gear mass so that they couldn't see and they in
[58:24.240 --> 58:28.240]  turn then got pepper sprayed by the police because they were trying to go and
[58:28.240 --> 58:32.080]  attack absolutely you can say the police in Charlottesville basically aided
[58:32.080 --> 58:37.920]  we're about to go to break but basically aided the rioters we'll be back
[58:37.920 --> 58:46.320]  you are listening to GCN visit GCNlive.com today
[58:48.400 --> 58:52.760]  as most of you already know I am a voracious consumer of news and
[58:52.760 --> 58:56.960]  information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research I
[58:56.960 --> 59:01.480]  came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[59:01.480 --> 59:06.040]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do
[59:06.040 --> 59:11.000]  today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they
[59:11.000 --> 59:15.880]  were hunting killing and then processing and so I set out to develop caveman but
[59:15.880 --> 59:21.280]  to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood

[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:14.880]  the alex jones show because there is a war
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:24.760]  well desperate elites they control the populations they cause division standard
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:29.640]  British Empire Roman Empire operation Millie Weaver was there with our
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.920]  intrepid camera man Gavin other observations about what you witnessed
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.520]  Millie now that they confirm that the police were ordered to stand down in
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:44.200]  Charlottesville, Virginia well basically one of the observations there is that
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.840]  you could see that the people on the alt-right United Rally side brought a lot
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:55.040]  of shields and whatnot and things to block themselves with whereas the antifa
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:01.160]  brought cases full of water balloons filled with urine feces paint gels
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.920]  pepper spray tear gas canisters they brought things to throw at them to
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:10.720]  attack them with and that's kind of what happened all in all I'm not saying
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.960]  that there weren't scuffles there weren't fights of course fights break out you
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.480]  couldn't pepper spray someone in the face and then their friends are going to
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:20.640]  attack you that's what happened but the police stood down so that it could
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.360]  happen so that they could use this violence that went down to say that it
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.600]  was all the people on the alt-right it was all these white supremacists white
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.600]  nationalists so that then you could then blame it all on Trump supporters and
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:40.320]  that's why Trump had to then inevitably come out and condone the so harshly he
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.720]  condoned the people on the alt-right whereas he didn't make much mention out
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.960]  of antifa and the Black Lives Matter groups that were actually going out
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:52.440]  there to create that situation and I do believe that these groups are backed and
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:58.440]  paid for by George Soros and this is all a way to try and create a an extremist
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.800]  movement on the alt-right and to have some of these alt-right groups continue to
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:07.440]  have these protests so that they can then play into the narrative by having
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:13.160]  these hate groups come out attack them police stand down allow the fighting to
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.680]  continue then only blame all the violence on the alt-right so the smartest
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.680]  solution here would be simply you know I get that you want to have these these
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:26.800]  protests I get that it is your right to have these protests but I would say
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:32.240]  really and truly try to refrain from some of these protests and rallies for a
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:37.080]  little while because they are literally using these protests and rallies to
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.320]  demonize the right and to demonize from supporters and of course you have deep
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:48.400]  state operatives you have FBI CIA you have paid protesters agitators going to
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.320]  try to make sure that it goes their direction because what happened the
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:55.480]  mainstream media covered it and they don't make any mention of antifa the
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.280]  Black Lives Matter going out and attacking they make only mention of the
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:05.640]  people who were then there fighting back and you're right that's exactly what's
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:10.200]  happening here and the left gets turned lose to attack kill police attack whites
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:15.000]  everywhere say whites deserve to die countless knockout game deaths you name
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.320]  it and then white people see that and think well we're really under attack on
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.880]  a racial basis I guess the white supremacists were right we better go
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:26.520]  join them that's the manipulation and then they have these Democrat party
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:32.280]  cities where the police stand down so they can have a more explosive event and
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.160]  as you pointed out the antifa comes out with the weapons with the clubs with the
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:42.360]  tear gas with it and then the white nationals they have their shields and
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.800]  I'm not saying the white nationals are good clearly though they're not the ones
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:50.120]  that initiated the violence and then you have the police standing down and then
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:54.120]  ordering you and the press to go back through the antifa and letting them
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:59.040]  attack you actually aiding and abetting through the mayor's action the violence
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.120]  of the death so I believe that Michael singer should be charged with the murder
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.040]  as a co-conspirator with the individual that ran her over I think Michael
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.520]  singer is part of a capital murder operation and premeditatedly new
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:15.680]  violence would come and is a guilty of capital murder and should be tried and
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:22.000]  should be sent to death row exactly because he allowed for chaos to ensue and
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.280]  anarchy to to go on he could have been danger the whole city this could have
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:30.920]  become a nationwide chain reaction of idiots killing each other white black I
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:35.000]  don't care what color you are stop it stop being idiots we're being hit with

[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:19.480]  hear criticism bubble up on all sides of this event about the initial slow
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:23.640]  response by the police when I got out of my car yesterday in charlesville for the
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:28.400]  first time about 10 30 a morning you knew this was a bad scene and that bad
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.280]  things were going to be happening because people were congregating at lee
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:37.240]  park at emancipation park wearing helmets body armor carrying big heavy sticks
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:42.240]  nobody was intent upon peace here from either side people were intent on causing
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.960]  havoc and causing damage and even as wounded were being brought out of the
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:51.280]  park the police were sitting idly by I was standing by a cordoned off area where
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.160]  the police had set up as a staging area the state police has set up and they
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.160]  said you can come in here this is a safe area but when the tear gas started to
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.920]  fly thrown by protesters the police themselves began to evacuate that I
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.680]  asked the guy who was in charge said where are you going he said we're
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.880]  leaving it's too dangerous they had an opportunity to nip this thing in the
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:16.760]  bud and they chose not to and that's the Fox reporter getting it right Doug

[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:42.960]  wars we have CNN yesterday they're still saying it that's the talking point
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:50.040]  Fox News it's the talking point once again Trump condemns once again Trump
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.120]  fails to condemn the alt-right white supremacists once again when did he
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:10:01.480]  when did he not do it the first time oh cuz he only condemned David Duke like
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:05.040]  20 30 times back in the 90s and again and again and again they wanted to force
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.760]  him into an issue to condemn David Duke because he had to condemn black
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:13.760]  supremacists when they say something I mean how is it him every time something
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.760]  happens he's supposed to he gave a press conference within like an hour and a
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:20.200]  half of this happening Saturday and they said oh that wasn't quick enough but
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:25.880]  while it was going on at 12 19 Eastern it was going on at 11 you know 19 central
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:33.520]  it was over by you know 12 30 or so we must we must all be united and condemn
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.400]  all that hate stands for there's no place for this kind of violence in
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.000]  America let's come together as one then he said no matter what color you are we
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.840]  all got to love each other they turned that into he didn't condemn it till he
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:53.120]  came out particularly and said okay KKK whoever was there horrible people then
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.720]  they'll say he never said it will probably say again just like I did with
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:01.040]  the whole David Duke thing is why won't you condemn it he would be in press
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:06.200]  conferences and condemn it three times in 15 minutes and then they'd come back
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.960]  and say why haven't you condemned it and he just said you're getting a sound bite
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:14.120]  for seeing and fake news I just said it two minutes ago and finally they backed
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:20.680]  off but you can see that's the same old bag of tricks Gary Haven successful
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:25.360]  Texan billionaire founder of Curves and many other businesses big philanthropist
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.480]  guy that helped break the news with our reporters last year flying in a day after

[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.880]  about six months later in a big report by the Associated Press he's the
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.480]  producer of the hit film a Marageddon that yours truly is in that's focused on
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.520]  dark skies events that oh guys can you reprint me that article from last week

[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.960]  important angles on what's going on and you've helped spur a national debate
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.320]  about these dark sky events we're gonna cover more Millie's gonna have some
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.480]  final comments in a moment but you'll be co-hosting with me today the next few
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.680]  hours we have a lot of their guests on but what do you want to tackle first the
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.360]  the president's new response saying I will unequivocally love each other don't
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.240]  be racist come together I condemn these racist groups and he did what they wanted
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:47.360]  he didn't condemn the anti-fog communist and their violence he went so far as to
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.440]  go okay just the you know just the white nationalist they're bad we condemn it
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:55.920]  which is them really bullying him into that when previously he gave the real
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:59.640]  statement both sides are dumb they're bad racism is bad condemning all let's
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.640]  love each other let's get the economy going let's move forward he tried to
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:07.680]  neutralize it all they don't want that they want CNN to have him but they're
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.080]  not gonna stop now they're gonna keep saying you didn't condemn you didn't
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.120]  condemn he'll say I just condemned again he'll have to have press conference
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:19.240]  after press conference Gary yeah let's start there you know the kind of the
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:24.120]  hidden message here is when Trump made his statement he did not simply go after
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:29.320]  the so-called white supremacists he said he was inclusive because he saw
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:35.840]  what Millie has been talking about he saw these antifa violent probably
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:42.440]  bust in Soros funded people and to Trump's credit he had the courage to
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.920]  include them in his statement and of course that's what set him up for them
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.600]  to go after him so I really commend Trump for having done that by the way
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:56.080]  Miller you've done a spectacular job on covering this in the courage you have to
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:00.760]  walk into that that crowd is amazing and the one thing I want to I want to add
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:06.000]  to this is what Trump needs to do it is to order the Justice Department to to
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.280]  follow the money you know Soros is probably paid for these people he
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.200]  admittedly pays for all the groups yeah and it's easy to find because you know
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.880]  you can go if that Millie's gonna have a report out today with Gavin they're
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.520]  actually caught the same faces as other parts of the country yes crisis actors
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:25.480]  have been funded to be there now that's easy to establish the reports gonna show
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:30.360]  that excellent I didn't even know you okay yeah yeah one step ahead of us well
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:35.400]  if he can show that link guess what George Soros needs to be charged in a
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:41.520]  rested for sedition that's where this thing needs to go I want Millie to
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.960]  speak to that because first they hire him for these riot control drills the
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.560]  cops don't know the antifa was being trained at those paid like $300 a day in
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:55.720]  many cases as crisis actors they learn how to hit attack fight they drill then
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:59.360]  they're bust out they're sent out to kind of lead and agitate folks that just
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.760]  kind of show up on their own yeah and so that's what you've got is this this a
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:07.720]  domino effect but undoubtedly Trump was on target we have the mayor admittedly
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.600]  ordering a stand down we have the police confirming they were ordered to stand
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.920]  down that's anarchy a dereliction of duty that's aiding and abetting this and
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.560]  that's what Trump's talking about so I think they should go for the death
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:23.160]  penalty for the guy that ran over the lady and then they should also call for
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.920]  criminal charges on the mayor and the police chief and and have an
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.760]  investigation on who ordered the stand down to declare anarchy in that town
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:37.320]  and I'm serious when the mayor is found guilty being part of murder one aiding
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:41.280]  and abetting situation he knew it caused murder I believe he should be given the
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:46.000]  punishment after the jury declares that he's guilty of capital murder yes and
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:52.160]  Trump needs to actually tell the rest of the story and explain it instead he's
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:57.000]  backed down and he's gone on defense again he needs to go on offense he has a
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.880]  truth on the side and there's plenty of evidence and so what the media is gonna
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:05.040]  be gonna be shooting him down anyway at least the American people will be able
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:09.760]  to step in defending because we'll know what's really going on it's just
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.280]  incredible he came out and said I totally condemn all forms of racism it's
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.240]  horrible we should love each other we should come together but both sides
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.960]  came looking for a fight it all needs to be investigated of course it needs to be
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.960]  investigated when you're given a speech two hours after it happened and people
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:28.400]  are you know still bleeding I mean again we finally got a president that
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:35.720]  doesn't just go with whatever CNN tells him to say yeah and in Trump he steps
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.600]  out with one foot like the statement on this and then he backs up and goes on
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:45.040]  defense he needs he needs to forget trying to please these people and step
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:50.560]  out there that's what got him elected and why he's not doing that nails a fall
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:54.080]  it's because that all over the White House they're saying Bannon leads these
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.840]  people Bannon's criticizing McMaster Bannon doesn't run anything at
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:01.680]  Breitbart it's been the organic research about McMaster being in the Soros
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:06.480]  group and trying to sabotage things that organically my listeners were saying
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:11.680]  day one back in April why aren't you on McMaster more why aren't you defending
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:15.480]  Flynn more and I said I don't know let's wait and see it was the listeners that
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:19.840]  do the research it was the 4chan people it was the autistic army and that's not
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.560]  bashing autistic kids if you're a new listener that's what they call themselves
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:26.080]  because they're like Ashburgers it fighting on the internet and digging up
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.920]  info they're like geniuses and and they found all this and it was true but they're
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:35.760]  using that against Bannon right now and he may be out by the end of the week the
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.400]  word is he's on a razor's edge right now that's not high because they're
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:43.240]  they're convincing Trump that it's Bannon that's leaking all this
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:49.080]  information to I remember saying this on the phone to some sources just a few
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:54.200]  weeks ago I said listen if scaramucci has all this info they're gonna get mad at
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.320]  him for leaking if he's the leak investigator they're gonna turn it
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.520]  around we've got to learn that info from the Patriots in the White House to
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.800]  fight the globalist is not a leak that is news but they're gonna label it as
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:10.200]  leaks and they got scaramucci that way and now they're going well look the
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:14.040]  alt-right knows all this it must be Bannon I've never gotten anything from
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:18.960]  Bannon on my phone other than you know keep it up brother you know we're gonna
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:22.720]  restore the Republic you appreciate your work that's all I get and that's all
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.600]  he'll do and the president on the phone when I get a chance to talk to him it's
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.440]  the same thing it's all being recorded so you know we're all operating on our
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.400]  own out here ladies and gentlemen go ahead but you know I you're a great
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:42.280]  resource is the leader in the the alternative media if you've not been
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:48.600]  reached out to from Bannon then that's that's evidence to me that no I've got
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:53.200]  Bannon's phone number right here and he'll just respond with oh hey we're
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.720]  fighting hard hope you're doing well brother that's it he will not respond
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:59.320]  when hey what's going on here hey are you ever gonna have a press conference
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:03.320]  ever gonna give an interview hey I'd like to get you on no response since the
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:08.400]  campaign other than friendly little things so that's all that goes on since
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:12.640]  he has been you know last few months the campaign and then and then president
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.400]  elect he's not giving anyone information zero you know later on when we talk
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:22.680]  about to this North Korea thing I I'm gonna give you some insight that that's
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:28.520]  unique that I think will help explain the deep state and and their agenda and
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:34.880]  how the deep state itself is being trapped by the North Korea program but
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:37.960]  I make sure to hear what Millie has to say we're gonna finish up with Millie
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:41.640]  final comments from her straight ahead and I don't want to bash Karen Lucci but
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:46.240]  he's telling the president you were dumb to give a real answer no that's what
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.120]  makes the country love you the president should double down and go after the
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:55.320]  race is white supremacist but also after Soros yeah tell the truth tell us our
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:00.080]  economy how about our banking system our president has stated we are sitting on a

[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:28.400]  Gary was telling me an amazing story about some of his personal friends that
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:33.880]  are real close to Trump and into the spiritual life of Trump which I've been
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.960]  told some of the same stories this is powerful it's coming up start of the
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.040]  next segment we're gonna play his response that was live about 30 minutes
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:44.160]  ago that the media is trying to spin that oh wasn't enough you know decrying
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:48.960]  the racism well it's just crazy it's like this benchmark where they're the
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:53.920]  boss you're guilty and you've got to decry David Duke 50 times 25 times isn't
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:58.680]  enough it's so transparent and that's why George Soros and others have hyped
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:03.440]  up racial divide in this country Millie weaver you and Gavin where are you now
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:07.320]  where are you going next and other observations about what we've witnessed
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:13.200]  well right now we're in Ohio we're continuing on our next stop is actually
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:17.520]  gonna be in Pittsburgh for the March on Google at Google headquarters and we
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.400]  will be also talking to people and getting their stories for the flyover
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.720]  America series but I just wanted to say one quick thing on Charlottesville now
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.280]  when I say that I believe that deep state was involved in this and that it was
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:32.280]  run by deep state I'm not saying that I think it was a false flag I'm not saying
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:36.040]  that I think that there were crisis actors that were getting hurt or not you
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.560]  know pretending to get hurt I said that this looks like the deep state was
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:45.520]  involved in it because it looked like it was a huge set up in order to demonize
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:49.040]  the right exactly they created the atmosphere they created the hype they've
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.120]  been pushing for it billions of dollars spent the last eight years coordinated
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.720]  police step stand down just like they've done in Maryland and other areas they
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:01.320]  stand down to make it as bad as possible and it turns out the Justice
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:05.560]  Department of Clinton and Obama and others continue to do this so we know
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:09.160]  there's a major history of this millie and the stand down you first reported is
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:15.000]  confirmed exactly and it was just to create anarchy so that you would have
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.360]  Antifa throwing things and what's the natural reaction when your you know
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.240]  bottles are getting thrown at people well they're gonna some of them are
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:25.840]  gonna pick them up and throw them back and then that's all they need to try and
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:30.040]  justify look see they're the violent ones they're the ones acting out demonize
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:34.160]  the alt-right demonize them do you condemn them do you disavow them Trump
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:38.800]  and then kind of get that that whole narrative going that you have homegrown
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:43.640]  terrorism on the alt-right whereas they don't want to mention Antifa and how
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:50.160]  Antifa literally came trained militarized doing warlike maneuvers you know
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.000]  they bring coolers and you think oh it's to stay hydrated no it's filled with
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.240]  water balloons filled with feces urine just discussing things that will pop and
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.160]  explode on people and water bottles filled with the same substances you
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.680]  think oh look they're bringing silly spray like they did in Seattle well they
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:11.120]  were silly spraying the riot cops so that their masks were covered and they
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:14.920]  could then mess with their line of sight you think oh look they're linking arms
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:18.320]  and singing see they're just trying to be peaceful with what it looks great for
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.320]  me but in reality it's the block people from getting back into where their
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:27.640]  medic started to wash the spray the pepper spray off of their face so they
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:32.240]  know how to I mean whoever is orchestrating this is very smart and
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:37.720]  they know exactly what they're doing and they're they train them a train of
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:43.040]  it's been in the news at these socialist camps they have in Oregon Illinois it's
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:46.320]  in my film police state to the takeover and what you're saying Millie is
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:52.920]  absolutely what's happening first they designate everyone who likes Trump is
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:55.840]  the alt-right because you don't just say all conservatives are racist they've
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:59.160]  already tried that it didn't work they okay we all calling all conservatives
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:05.080]  racist isn't working let's just call them alt-right then isn't a new definition
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:09.400]  the Democrats will own it and control it then we'll claim that all of Trump's
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.680]  new supporters are racist have a few racist events and then connect that to
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:19.600]  Trump himself so this is all semantical games they're playing exactly and my
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.160]  my problem with just coming out and jumping on the bandwagon and
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:29.280]  saying you know bad you know white nationalist bad white supremacist which
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:33.400]  your views are stupid I'll say that you guys are dumb for buying into the
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:37.720]  narrative and you're looking at your paradigm the larger manipulation is
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.040]  the key and then we ask ourselves what's coming next we sorrow spent over a
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:45.800]  million dollars on this and others spent millions they've been getting this race
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:48.880]  war going for a long time as I said we kick off at the end of the summer it's
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:54.760]  here so what comes next so what comes next is they want retaliation they want
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:58.840]  more people to hold these of alt-right rallies so that they can then stage it
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:02.840]  create violence and blame it only on the alt-right all I have to say is don't be
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:08.680]  stupid don't buy into that get smart sue use petitioning use your means through
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:13.920]  paper use the courts use the system go out there and become politically active
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.320]  don't fall into the narrative because they are gonna use this to demonize
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:21.840]  Trump at the end of the day and that is all what this is about I agree Trump needs
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:25.440]  to throw the book at anybody that was violent on both sides they need to
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.560]  execute the guy that ran the folks over and then they need to have the Justice
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.640]  Department indict Michael Schinger for aiding and abetting I guarantee his
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:35.880]  emails have got him with the Soros people this to stand down all we have them if we
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.160]  move against them Trump must go on the offense Millie Weaver can't wait to see

[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:33.840]  lines of the info war let's play part of Trump's second statement which the
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:38.280]  media is now saying isn't enough they're already editing it they're already
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:42.080]  saying Trump declares racism is able to med pressure over Charlottesville all
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:46.840]  he's ever said for 40 years in public life is unify people bring people
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:51.880]  together getting in double ACP awards decrying David Duke dozens of times on
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:56.600]  TV before even ran for president then they would say he hadn't decried him you
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:59.920]  know wait till on the weekend David Duke had said something and Trump wasn't
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:03.880]  paying attention and say oh you need to respond he didn't respond today he's for
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:08.480]  David Duke just like they said oh it's been hours he hasn't responded about
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:13.080]  Charlottesville he tweeted and he said all racism is bad it was all right here
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:17.080]  and then he condemned it but they ran fake news that he didn't so he tweeted
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:21.120]  about it he gave a speech now another speech that's three times I think he's
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:25.400]  kind of falling into their trap because now they're saying get rid of Bannon and
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.560]  he's behind it all when when Bannon's not behind all the attacks on McMaster
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:34.400]  that's a fact we're gonna talk to Mike Cernovich who's always got the inside
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:38.400]  intel with the medium and of course all the other great work he's doing by
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:42.400]  selling author just popping in for like 10 minutes and then we've got Diamond
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:47.520]  and Silt coming on and so much more Gary Haven writing shotgun with us but we
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:51.960]  want to start with you in a moment but just your overall breakdown of this and
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:55.880]  then after Cernovich leaves us I want to get into the real spiritual side of
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:59.160]  Trump that nobody knows about very good let me let me mention a couple of
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.240]  things first of all this is the same old same old you know they're getting us to
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:08.520]  caught up in the chatter Trump good Trump bad and we've got to be careful not to
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:14.320]  waste our time and energy on this thing look Trump is a is the hope we have
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:19.800]  even though he's struggling he's the real deal and all of this is this
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:24.280]  nonsense about him the attacks on him whether it's rushing collusion or this
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:30.200]  or whatever we're gonna see next week it's just nonsense the ultimate goal
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:35.440]  here for for the people that to control the media that the the deep state the
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.840]  people that are in power is to create chaos you know out of chaos they they
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:44.800]  plan to acquire order and power and so that's the end game and they've been
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:48.720]  more and more open about it American people are waking up thanks a lot to
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:53.120]  to you Alex what you've done we just have to step back and say okay who's
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.320]  benefiting from this where's this going and spend our time on the things
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:00.880]  that are important we need to get along with each other you know we've got
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:05.840]  black brothers and sisters that that that love each other and in us and we
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:10.680]  should work together and not let them separate us and buy into this nonsense
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:16.320]  so everybody needs to calm down and just just call the media for the corruption
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:20.720]  and the lies that they're doing to perpetrate this nonsense in support
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.840]  Trump and encouraging and what Trump needs to do is is instead of putting one
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:29.160]  foot in the water you know and then pulling it out quickly as soon as he
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:32.840]  gets a little shock to it he should go all in you know he's got nothing to lose
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:37.280]  right now he needs to go all in and explain what's going on in the media in
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:41.600]  the American people and he's got the white supremacist morons and you got the
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:46.280]  cop-killing antifa groups funded by Soros all but they stir up a fight and
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:50.200]  the police with the Democratic mayor orders a stand down and innocent people
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:54.440]  get hurt and killed you know the Nazis are bad Soros is bad and by the way
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:58.160]  Soros is a former Nazi collaborator Julian Assange came out and said why
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.400]  don't they care that our government under Obama funded the overthrow the
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:05.040]  Ukrainian government and put Nazis in charge absolutely this is claimed that
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:09.680]  Trump said Nazi when the whole Democrat governments run by Nazis run by a real
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:13.680]  Nazi is incredible it's extraordinary you know I don't want to get off topic but
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:20.560]  530 representatives in the Congress voted to extend and broaden the sanctions
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:27.800]  on on Russia based on Russian collusion in the election which the 75%
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:33.160]  Americans know is nonsense but some polls are hired 30 of 535 of the Congress
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:37.280]  thought punishing which is an act of war by the way these sanctions against
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:40.800]  Russia was a good idea yeah our representatives are bought and paid for
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.720]  and Trump needs to be honest about that as well I want to go to North Korea with
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:48.240]  you Mike Cernovich of course he's an introduction coming up in early
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.600]  September he's launching his own broadcast daily taking off at 3 o'clock
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.680]  central and he's gotten a bunch of powerful new articles he sent me one
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:58.960]  this morning I'm gonna pull up here in a second on screen for viewers I'll give
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:02.000]  you the headline where he kind of lays out a menu of what the current battle
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.920]  what's coming next what his sources are saying everybody knows he really
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:09.160]  understands what's happening it's also a filmmaker producer the new film being
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:13.680]  produced is hoax the media's war on truth so so we get into the White House
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:18.600]  battle first what's happening with the riots obviously staged condoned and
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:22.440]  allowed just incredible that even Fox is admitting there was a stand down order
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.600]  our reporters witnessed it or the North Korea thing what do you want to tackle
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:30.760]  first Mike Cernovich I mean there's so much to talk about I think Trump's
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:35.480]  statement is a good starting off point because it shows how dishonest the media
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:40.080]  is Trump did everything they wanted him to do and now they're going oh well it
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.680]  wasn't good enough you should have done this you should have taken questions
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:47.720]  there they're not honest people so Trump is losing his way whoever's telling him
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:52.120]  to dance like a puppet for the media is giving a bad advice because they take
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.200]  that as weakness his first statement was love each other come together all
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:59.600]  racism is bad but both sides came looking for a fight we need to investigate
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.240]  this and look the New York Times admit there was an order for a stand down that
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:07.520]  is incredible I mean that we had a stand down in Maryland where there was beating
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:11.120]  people the black lives matter that's criminal Cernovich what do you think
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:15.840]  should be done well yeah they actually sent the alt-right guys into and as you
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.400]  know I have no love for those guys they hate you but they sent them into kill
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:24.320]  zones so I've actually investigated what had happened and I watched every stream
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:29.600]  so here's what happened the alt-right people had a permit the Antifa did not
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:35.920]  the police demanded that the alt-right people disperse because Antifa were
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:40.080]  committing violence and rioting but the police didn't go after Antifa instead
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:44.640]  they sent the alt-right guys into these choke points where they were attacked and
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:49.320]  it was like melee warfare again just like the Battle of Berkeley and then of
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:52.760]  course violence is always ratcheted up there were people in the streets with
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:58.520]  baseball bats and Antifa you had massive fighting on both sides but this is a
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:02.080]  law enforcement if I were the father of the daughter who was murdered I would
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:06.000]  definitely be suing the the police department and the mayor and everything
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.960]  you're a successful lawyer in your own right I mean I'm no lawyer but this is
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:14.360]  cut and dry they ordered to stand down the cops admitted it they made people
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:17.520]  marks through the gauntlet to put the two sides together they were ordered to
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.960]  stand down and make this thing explode yes and we've seen this happen this
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:26.880]  happened at a San Jose Trump rally has happened in a Chicago there's a whole
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:30.920]  pattern of this which the fake news media doesn't want to cover the stand-down
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:35.120]  order orders our par for the course and in fact that's why those alt-right guys
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:38.920]  would go into the events wearing shields and helmets and things because by the
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:43.840]  way they're just in the ACLU it turns out also called the police and confirmed
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:48.280]  it they're not even hiding that they stood down Mike what do you think exactly
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:52.960]  and the ACLU would tweet it out that it was on both sides the violence was in
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:58.480]  Tifa a woman journalist was actually assaulted yesterday by Antifa these
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:02.560]  left-wing feral roving mobs that of course the fake news media will never
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.040]  call out or disavow they're always counter protesters right they'll never
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:10.480]  name who they are so we live in such a dishonest world and this is what happened
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:13.760]  with Jeff Sessions and the reason that's why I want to talk about it first is
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:18.600]  just to set the framework for the world which is that you can never show
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:23.680]  weakness you can never apologize you can never placate or appease the media you
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:28.520]  have to always double down and this is a bad thing for society because they're
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:31.960]  never gonna say oh you know because you've done that Alex before where you
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:36.040]  tried to say oh you know I I got that story wrong here I'm gonna retract it
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:40.480]  and then they go this proves that Alex Jones is a conspiracy they keep
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:44.200]  misrepresenting that before I was ever attacked I corrected because it's the
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.000]  right thing to do then they lie and put out fake quotes of me repeating what I
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.680]  didn't say so they take it as the weakness because they're so stupid and
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:55.720]  think that must be the target point yeah right and now they're even trying to
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:00.000]  say they're trying to accuse you of anti-Semitism when you I just read
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.720]  Cher blue and Soros is going after again you've always said you have no time for
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:08.960]  this nonsense and now they're claiming that you're talking about Jewish stuff
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:13.680]  and anti-Jewish stuff they're really dirty hey Mike tell me this how does
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:17.560]  Trump handle this what does he do in the media to counter this what do you think
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:23.160]  well Trump made a his statement today was didn't move the ball downfield what
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:29.880]  you have to do is you say I disavow the KKK I disavow the Nazis and I
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:36.120]  call upon the media and the Democrats to disavow the Scali shooting the family
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:41.320]  research council shooting all I call on them to join our pledge to disavow all
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:44.880]  political violence and then that is how you prevent them that's how you have to
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:48.560]  counter punch you always have to be aggressive even when you're kind of
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:52.360]  doing what they want and that was his big mistake is he should have said I
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:56.840]  demand we all join a joint because who's against the pledge against violence so
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:01.040]  now you've taken the high road and you're forcing the enemy to assume your
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:05.200]  frame but instead he went into the frame of the enemy and he got ambushed and as
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:09.080]  you can see they're just shooting at him even more you know when his first
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.920]  statement actually was consistent with what you just said he said all groups
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:17.200]  that were involved but then he backed up you know after they came after him
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.640]  by the way I watched his press event here a few minutes ago he did a great
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:26.360]  job on it but he's backpedaling now instead of being on on the offense he's
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:31.520]  going to defense that quickly what do you think of that well he has statement
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:36.280]  on Saturday wasn't good because you have to identify the enemy by name you
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:41.080]  can't make a vague proclamation about both sides you would have to say I call
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:45.160]  on you Alex Jones and I did this we completely flipped Megan Kelly and all
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:49.840]  those lunatics on their their heads because we said we disavow all political
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:54.720]  violence by anybody who reads us or watches us we therefore call upon Jay
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:59.520]  Taper, CNN, Brian Stelter, Megan Kelly, we call upon them to stop promoting the RMT FOD
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:03.920]  covering up their violence yeah right let me add this since you mentioned it
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:07.880]  since you mentioned it I pointed out that when I would go protest the Klan and
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:12.240]  KKK that clearly sometimes it came out they were federal agents and sometimes
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:16.200]  that it was Southern primary law center groups and ADL and Jewish groups and it
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:19.840]  be Jewish guys you know that don't look very Aryan but you know look kind of
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:24.320]  like Howard Stern type guys you know doing it and just like they caught the guy
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:28.680]  attacking the Jewish cemeteries and synagogues and he was a Jewish left-wing
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:32.520]  guy now they edited that out okay you know it's like saying if they said a
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:35.840]  black guy did something and I said well I saw a white guy running from the scene
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:39.480]  it wouldn't be that I was being racist against white saying it looked like a it's
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:44.240]  just crazy and over and over again they caught leftist Jewish groups just like
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:48.640]  earlier this year they wanted Trump to decry attacks on Jewish centers like he
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:53.320]  was involved in it so he said okay I decry it but it could be stays and went
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:58.000]  oh my gosh it was fake they caught the left-wing Jewish guy who admitted to
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.320]  doing it with accomplices so I'm talking about Jewish groups going out as
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:05.880]  white supremacists posing as them they've been caught over and over again
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:09.040]  the ADL has been caught the Southern primary law center has been caught and
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:14.000]  then they play this game like like I'm just making that up I just I just love
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.920]  it I love it I love it call me anti-semitic I don't care your liars
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.360]  it's like calling Trump anti-semitic when his family's married into Jews I don't
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:25.120]  care nothing against Jews in general it's all edited Alex Jones accuses KK
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:29.040]  members of being Jewish actors from Seinfeld look they've been quotes on
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:32.960]  each word to put them together if you're seeing a real quote folks it's like
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:35.940]  quotes and then seven eight nine words and then a quote it's not one word
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:41.240]  quotes one word quote one word quote or two words quote I mean this is
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:44.160]  incredible because they don't want to put the part in there where I give the
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:47.800]  examples of where it's in the news but don't worry we'll do special reports on
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:53.120]  that now you guys pull up a Jewish leftist Jewish man arrested and attacks
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.800]  on Jewish cemeteries just as Trump said just as Trump said you want to comment
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:03.000]  on that Cernovich well hate crime hate crime hoaxes are actually very common and
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.680]  of course the Southern Poverty Law Center does have white non-Jewish people who
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:11.000]  staged these events too which of course of course we've all called out false
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.400]  flags on you know people of all races religions genders and everything like
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:20.400]  that and so what they want to do though is and this is what I've learned is what
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:24.200]  they want to do is they try to make it sound like you're criticizing all Jewish
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:29.880]  people which are clearly not you're only criticizing agent provocateurs which we
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:33.880]  criticize white people all the time too that doesn't mean he's trying to
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:40.080]  overthrow Israel we're not what do you think about it enemy so what else was
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:44.200]  named by Israel as an enemy of the state what right that's what I why does
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:48.960]  nobody ever want to talk about that what why and also too why are the very
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:53.880]  strong powerful right wing Jewish voices in America silenced by the fake news
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:57.440]  media they're very very powerful right wing Jewish voices and the media
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:01.400]  pretends like they don't even exist I think that's anti-Semitic I think that
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:05.680]  they should hear from very strong-minded right wing Jews who are opposed to
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:12.040]  Soros and other things and call this out you know they're they're quiet for a
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:15.520]  lot of reasons I think it's interesting that George Soros has a warrant out for
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:22.320]  his arrest in Russia other areas I mean we I would encourage Trump to to have his
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:29.080]  Justice Department charge Soros with sedition he's clearly guilty of it you
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:33.880]  can follow the money and in his his attempt to disrupt the peace and to
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:38.920]  violate the laws of this country I mean it as clear as can be and in what a
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:43.160]  message would that send to you know to the enemies of this Constitution and in
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:48.840]  our in our sovereignty if he had Soros arrested of course that leads us to the
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:53.080]  Clinton crime family and a few other things exactly this country has been
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:57.880]  a fight for its life Sarnovich and you're gonna be with us the whole next
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:00.840]  hour because I want to get into your dark sky scenarios I want to get into the
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.200]  background of folks you know they actually pray and meet with Trump and
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:07.000]  talk to him on the phone almost daily and you know really how christian he
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.280]  really is this is powerful stuff coming up just briefly and the two minutes we've
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.600]  got left Mike Sarnovich the big fight going on inside the White House blaming
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:20.800]  Bannon for this the the power struggle what you're in tell yeah they're trying
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:25.840]  to frame me so actually Chuck Todd on Meet the Press read one of my tweets to
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:30.220]  HR McMaster but you probably never heard about that because who watches Meet
[01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:35.440]  the Press anymore but Chuck Todd read my tweet to McMaster and then Chuck Todd
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:40.200]  goes he called me a self-described leader of the alt-right when in fact I
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:43.840]  have never called myself leave the alt-right you don't even say the term
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:46.600]  alt-right you're saying is they're gonna connect you to racist you've been
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:49.840]  saying for since the term came out nine months ago that you're not part of it
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:54.600]  exactly so what they're trying to do is they realize that McMaster does have a
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:59.640]  lot of problems a Sheldon Adelson's group Zionist Organization of America has
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:05.000]  consistently come out against HR McMaster so they're freaking out within the
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.080]  White House and they go what do we do well let's frame Sarnovich for being
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:13.160]  part of these alt rodents as I call them and then we'll try to make anything
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:17.680]  that he says seem like it's less true it's the usual dirty tricks playbook
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:22.280]  that we know how to do all the time but it shows how McMaster is leaking to the
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:26.800]  press because all these mainstream media outlets and the including share blue and
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:31.320]  George Soros websites are defending him cares defended him the Muslim
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:36.000]  Brotherhood has defended him everybody at the ADL has defended him the SPLC has
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.880]  defended him CNN has defended him everybody who wants Trump to fail is
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:44.880]  defending Trump so now they're trying to smear me and frame me for the whole
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:48.120]  power structure you need is defending McMaster clearly showing he is the bad
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:51.200]  guy and you're the first guy I heard that really along with my listeners
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:56.080]  singled him out said this is the bad guy yeah exactly that was the big
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.960]  underreported story he flew under the radar and so with the media now they're
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:05.280]  trying to frame banning for whatever I do banning but I don't do anything for
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.880]  banning he's never given me any kind of instruction and moreover if he did they're
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:13.840]  there these people they're lunatics also conspiracy theorists I've even said you
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:18.160]  and I we don't even talk and we should talk Paul and I don't talk none of us
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:21.640]  talk on the right because we're all so independent and free-minded that we
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:24.600]  don't coordinate on anything and we should coordinate more and that's
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:28.320]  probably why the left is so much stronger than we are in many ways is
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.560]  because they are organized and we're all kind of on exactly do you think they're
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:36.240]  gonna be able to get banning out every day in that White House anything can
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:40.960]  happen so on any given day who knows what could happen every day that banners
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:45.280]  in there is a good day for America but I it's hard to predict things out from

[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:25.560]  North Korea thing that's coming up the next hour we're gonna get hopefully
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:30.240]  right now into some of the background and some of the national pastors that he
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:33.000]  knows her friends with Trump in the private meetings they've had I've gotten
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.600]  some of this info similarly I know that private conversations the president
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:41.040]  but I'm not gonna get into those this is pretty powerful info just briefly
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:46.800]  where listeners supported Buzzfeed tested our supplements have found they were
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:51.320]  totally clean but tried to lie and say but we overcharge not knowing the very
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:54.920]  company that they had had tested other supplements and then was selling them
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:58.360]  recommending it as the best vitamin B12 in the country when that's who we
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:05.880]  private label from so we're called the Buzzfeed special but now the Buzzfeed
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:09.280]  pieces gone they're writing derivative pieces that are even more deceptive so
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:12.080]  they're trying to shut us down so when you fund us you're getting high quality
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:14.800]  products in front of the tip of the spear so I'm combining last month's
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:21.280]  specials with this month's 1776 specials and calling it the Buzzfeed special
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:25.560]  brain force 55% off survival shield x2 which you really need if there's a

[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:33.440]  it's great not just the radioactive item it blocks the chlorine bromide
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:37.800]  fluoride you name it survival shield x2 they said we tested it it's pure iodine
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:42.200]  it's not sodium iodine it's not potassium iodide or iodate it's just pure
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:46.040]  iodine acting like that's a bad thing they know full well it's super hard to
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:50.680]  get the deep earth crystals totally pure in the gaseous form and then put it
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:55.600]  safely into palm oil they know this is proprietary it's so hilarious super blue

[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:15.520]  obviously some of these ramps stopped selling because they're going to sell
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:20.040]  out x2 because a lot of folks are buying it because of the nuclear war threat
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:23.840]  you know iodine's good iodine's flying off the shelves all over the country
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.440]  research engine that iodine flying off the shelves CBS news you name it we've
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:32.440]  also again got the iodine in the toothpaste and of the mouthwash really

[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:48.640]  we've ever had I keep saying this is a big one this is a big one this is the
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:52.520]  biggest because I combine two and I love to make fun of Buzzfeed and folks are
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:55.640]  really responding so thank you for the support we're trying to expand the face
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:58.760]  the globalist you know as we get you know reporters in almost every big event
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:02.160]  now we're hiring more reporters more crew and they're great people so thank you
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:05.280]  all for the support Gary this is a short segment but in the next and then a
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:08.640]  little bit of the next we're going to get into Trump the spirituality but just
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:12.760]  finishing up with economic warfare the way they're coming after us we keep
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:15.720]  winning but it is a little disconcerting they don't stop and they're
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:20.600]  turning it up yeah I tell you I think times getting short right now and the
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:25.760]  whole North Korea thing is is really staged you know FDR said that nothing
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:29.960]  happens by accident so right now they've kind of sucked Trump into this trap
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:34.840]  where there is no good outcome and after the break we'll talk about the
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:39.800]  ultimate lid on this trap that we need to warn President Trump about and the
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:44.800]  interesting thing is the deep state who normally is orchestrating these things
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:50.720]  is going to be a victim of what's it going to be happening which I think is
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:54.880]  particularly interesting so how much time do we have left I'm writing a note
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:58.800]  here to name this segment a warning an emergency warning to President Trump on
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:02.920]  North Korea or should we name this segment North Korea is a globalist trap
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:08.400]  for Trump deep state trap yeah except it's not the deep state that are
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:14.080]  creating this trap which would normally be the case I this is a trap that is
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:18.160]  going to trap the deep state into something that they really don't want so
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:21.520]  they think it's a trap and that's why I noticed the head Kingpin Lord Rothschild
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:25.520]  has actually come out and said this isn't Trump's fault North Korea is out of
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:29.980]  control we need to back off or need to do a regime change so I'll find out what
[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:34.120]  the really smart guy Gary Haven as I say in 70 seconds please tell friends and

[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:27.400]  jones okay crack this nut for us on north korea that will come back and get
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:33.000]  into the behind-the-scenes trops christianity okay North Korea obviously
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.440]  has been the big story on the news for the last couple of weeks and for good
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:41.200]  reason alright first of all let me get a little background on the same I made a
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:44.880]  movie called a married getting a couple years ago and I wrote the script along
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:50.200]  with Mike Norris Chuck Norris's son and in the movie we depicted what I call the
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:54.560]  greatest threat to the United States and that was the fact that North Korea has
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:58.480]  two satellites that circle our country twice a day right across the center of
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:03.400]  the country at the optimum altitude for something called a super EMP or an
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:08.920]  electromagnetic pulse and what that means is that that North Korea has the
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:14.560]  ability to detonate this device and according to two congressional studies
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:21.160]  that if they detonated this EMP device that electronics all across the country
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:25.440]  would be fried now what does that mean it means there's no electricity there's
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:29.680]  no internet there's no water there's no grocery distribution there's no gas
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:35.960]  distribution and two congressional studies concluded that 90% of Americans
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:40.000]  would die within 12 months now I thought this was a pretty important thing for
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.960]  the American people to know and I'd realized that the mainstream media was
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:47.680]  not talking about this they were literally withholding this information
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:53.720]  and our Congress which had the power to pass laws to harden the grid and protect
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:59.080]  us from this very real threat had done nothing and in fact they were bought and
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:03.440]  paid for and silent on this issue and and I wanted to do something about it so
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:10.200]  I became an expert on EMP so suddenly here we are dealing with North Korea in
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:16.640]  the threat of ICBMs and and nobody is talking about the real threat which is
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:20.840]  an EMP you know on Thursday last week I went to the New York Times and I read
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:25.640]  every story on North Korea that had been written over the previous week to see if
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:30.200]  anybody in the mainstream media was talking about or warning the American
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:36.040]  people about EMP and it was so silent on the subject I realized that of course is
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:42.360]  by design so what is it that that's going on with Trump right now well you
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:49.400]  know he has been kind of prodded and and sucked into this trap where because of
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:55.840]  his his blustering he's gonna have to do something if Kim Jong-un does something
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:01.480]  provocative for example Kim Jong-un threatened to detonate these nuclear
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:07.480]  devices somewhere near Guam not over Guam but somewhere near it was Trump's
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:11.320]  gonna gonna have to back that up with something his options none of them are
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:17.240]  good they include maybe a strategic new you know maybe hitting some of these
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:21.040]  weapons that are on this on the border of Seoul by the way I've been to Seoul I've
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:26.840]  got 400 curves in Korea and I saw I've been there multiple times they're very
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:32.000]  vulnerable to you know to this maniac across the deal so what's Trump gonna
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:39.600]  do and and who benefits from the verge of World War three well first of all the
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:43.720]  deep state which now has encircled Trump with his three generals they control
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:49.880]  all access to Trump they are part of a group that profit from war and you know
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:53.520]  they want us in Syria they want to spending tax dollars to fund their
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:57.440]  their war machine in the military industrial complex we all he relies
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:02.240]  really owns Congress at this point in time and of course the corporatists and
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:06.560]  I'm talking about pharmaceutical companies and big ag and big oil and
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:11.600]  of course let's not forget big banks they all you know have this globalism
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:17.800]  move that that will enrich them but let's not forget there's actually another
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:24.200]  paradigm above even the globalist and they're the alumnus you know the
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:30.760]  alumnus have a different agenda they want America to diminish they want America
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:34.720]  to to get out of the way because we're the only thing standing and that's why
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:37.840]  they want to take out Trump they don't want to make America great again so we
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:41.200]  come back finish up on this diamond and silver joining I want to finish up on
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:44.920]  Korea and why you think it's a trap they're setting up for Trump but it's a
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:48.160]  trap actually they're going to be caught in stay with us we'll be back with

[02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:01.560]  five years doing more and more research I came across the fact that the elite
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:06.240]  establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many
[02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:10.600]  cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors
[02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:15.120]  sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:19.240]  processing and so I set out to develop caveman but to not just have

[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:25.240]  shilts they don't need any introduction everybody loves them and these ladies
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:29.240]  been big supporters of Trump all along now they're trying to compare Trump to
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:33.720]  these idiots these morons these scumbag white supremacist and people and the
[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:37.160]  other communist cop killer groups that are there and Trump saying yeah both
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:41.040]  sides are bad we shall love each other and they they spun that so he came back
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:46.160]  out I said yeah specifically the white supremacist they said that's not good
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:49.320]  enough it just like the David Duke they can do it a hundred times it's not gonna
[02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:51.680]  be enough but the reason I originally been trying to get them on the last week
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:55.200]  that's perfect to have them on now to talk about this interview is Google
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:59.080]  YouTube is censoring them admittedly cutting off the revenue 90% they've done
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:03.400]  it to us and what do they say they say they say extremist or bigoted or
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:06.920]  hateful well we're trying to bring everybody together but that's what
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:11.640]  they're doing is saying anybody that supports Trump is a racist show diamond
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:16.880]  and silk rip YouTube say 95% demoted and again they're not just doing YouTube to
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:20.080]  make money but the point is that's discriminatory if they don't let gay
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:23.280]  people get a cake baked there's a lawsuit okay whatever but what about
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:27.320]  YouTube saying if you are a conservative or libertarian you're bad we're gonna
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:30.680]  talk to them here in just one moment and Gary Haven's riding shotgun billionaire
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:34.320]  founder of curves patriot filmmaker finish up your North Korea because I'm
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:38.280]  gonna ask them about that too about the trap the globalist the deep state the
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:43.600]  alumnus are trying to set for him so the end game of this is Trump's gonna be
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:48.160]  faced with several bad choices and when he responds is he's gonna have to do
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:52.800]  because of all the blustering he's done the secret weapon that North Korea has
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:59.200]  is this EMP that I was talking about this electromagnetic pulse and and if
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:04.880]  and when they detonate that thing and 90% of Americans are at risk for dying
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:08.960]  Trump is gonna get the blame and that's what they have in mind and he had to
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:13.840]  remember the the the the say that because they had an emergency black sky event
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:18.320]  they've never done last week preparing for this that got almost no coverage yeah
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:22.680]  and you know they always tend to have a false flyer excuse me a drill whenever
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:26.280]  weird things happen exercise and isn't that interesting that they got one for
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:29.800]  that as well but if the end game this is what's so fascinating about this the
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:34.920]  deep state that wants war and in corporatism is is going to lose on this
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:39.760]  one because the ultimate power the alumnus are the ones that are going to
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:43.000]  bring America down get us out of the way so that they can have their true
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:49.200]  global order which is a communist world government ran by dictators or an oligarchy
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:54.760]  made up of them so what is the solution what can Trump do to avoid this he can
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:11:00.520]  shoot down those satellites today just and I know you're getting a message the
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:03.520]  president today on that and we're just gonna leave it at that but that's
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:07.640]  actually super smart because they're already threatening to fire missiles
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:14.280]  maybe with nukes on them at Guam or Hawaii Kauai or Alaska Anchorage Alaska or
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:17.720]  Chicago Illinois they can hit all of them if that guy say he's doing this he's
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:21.120]  got weapons up in space we've got missiles that can shoot down satellites
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:25.120]  absolutely and they've threatened that maybe they've got nukes on board to
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:30.800]  cause an EMP jacketed in the right alloy to cause you know a larger EMP we need
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:34.240]  to shoot those down immediately and Trump needs to know that he's been set up
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:38.120]  on this and even his deep state people that are giving him advice think that
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:41.520]  this is gonna lead to more war or that they profit from he's gotta shoot him
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:45.320]  down that's the Trump card they hold over him and no one will even know what
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:47.880]  happened to him that's the great way I mean we've got satellite killers in
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:51.680]  space no one will even know we can kill them from space yeah easiest can be now
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:55.360]  I'm watching the faces of our these lovely ladies that are about to be on
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:59.680]  here and I think we're terrifying them would that be accurate no I know they're
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:02.880]  pretty upbeat pretty on target but yeah hey they stand up against the liberal so
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:06.920]  they'll do it but seriously diamond and silk diamond and silk calm don't need to
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:10.560]  tell folks who you ladies are but you know we see the economy 4 trillion the
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:15.600]  stock market 400 billion new jobs 69% down with felons not coming across the
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:22.880]  border the veterans getting better care get 25% more visits in all the all the
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:26.760]  new factories getting built all the great things happening out of the carbon
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:31.080]  tax out of the TPP Trump's done so much for the media says he's done nothing in
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:35.920]  fact he's a KKK member and in fact I am and you are all bigots and we're not
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:39.400]  allowed to even have our YouTube channels Paul Watson's having his band but
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:42.480]  you ladies are talking about a class action suit let me tell you I'm looking
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:45.920]  to join that then because I've been saying I'm not a litigious person but
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:48.760]  we're getting discriminated that's real discrimination well people act like
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:52.680]  they're got to open and free platform and then they use you and use your videos
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:57.080]  and YouTube the you in it the lawyers have said Congress has said congressman
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:02.080]  Warbockers talk to lawyers this is a total civil rights violation not giving
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:05.980]  us service and letting Al Qaeda have websites on YouTube but they can't so
[02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:09.640]  diamond and silk you ladies are here thank you for joining us thank you for
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:14.680]  having us to lay it out what's happening well you know you to stop the
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:19.840]  monetization of our videos the other day about 95% saying it's not suitable for
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:23.960]  all advertisers now we're in good standard with you to we've been in good
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:28.080]  standard for the past two years the past two years they had us monetize not all
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:32.280]  of a sudden they have stopped the monetization on those videos the deal
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:36.880]  is is that we talk about the president we are lowering his supporters to the
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:41.160]  president we talk about his agenda now you're telling us that we're in good
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:46.720]  standards with YouTube but what you speak is controversial so no advertisers
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:53.440]  want to advertise around you well how can why is YouTube deciding what the
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:58.320]  advertisers should be advertising around why not let the advertisers pick and
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:02.840]  choose based on demographic exactly so this is clearly discrimination prejudice
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:06.640]  and bias that's right and it won't be tolerated and it's a breach of their
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:10.880]  contract that's right because we signed a term in agreement when you click on the
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:14.800]  term of service when you click on the button that was you was agreeing to
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:19.040]  their terms of service that's right and though they are a private organization
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:24.280]  they are open to serve the public that's right okay and they allowed us that
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:28.960]  platform but we built that platform one subscriber at a time that's right with
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:34.840]  over 16 million views so you two have some explaining to do very fast yeah you
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:40.000]  know I I asked who was afraid a minute ago I'm afraid now I would not want to
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.560]  be totally right though because of course they always advertise they were a
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:49.720]  utility open for everybody to get everybody there now they're selectively
[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:53.080]  banning basically anybody who's a libertarian anybody who's conservative
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:57.080]  they're banning people with cat channels that are popular they don't want
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:02.440]  anybody in there that's crazy now you guys are the only thing you've done
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:06.920]  that's offended them is be a Trump supporter is that right well as far as
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:10.880]  I can see because that's all we talk about is President Trump his agenda what
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:15.640]  he's doing but we try to do it in a comical way so people can laugh while
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:19.920]  we're exposed to be clear that they're being banned and being cheated because
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:22.760]  they're so popular with millions and millions of views on each of their
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:25.440]  videos hundreds of thousands on the little ones it's because they're so
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:30.240]  upbeat and positive that they are being banned right and keep in mind that they
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:33.600]  also have a block button if you don't want to hear what diamond silk have to
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:36.960]  say don't come to our channel right if you come to our channel and you listen
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:40.120]  you say I don't like what they're saying then go to another channel you don't
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:44.440]  have to be on our channel because our subscribers for you too to take a
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:49.080]  manipulate the system and not allow our subscribers to know when we have dropped
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:53.480]  the video that is wrong they have breached their contract and somebody's
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:56.880]  gonna have to do something about let's be clear you upload a video and then they
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:16:01.000]  change the contract later I mean it is getting bad then they let the leftist
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:04.200]  get on there and talk about killing people calling for violence I mean
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:09.080]  they're out of control so what's happened to you in in the context how do you tie
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:13.520]  it into antifa the cop killer groups out stirring up racial divides everywhere
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:17.600]  they're a bunch of racist idiots and then a bunch of other racist idiots show
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:22.600]  up bad things happen we all to cry it Trump decries it in a tweet in a speech
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:27.120]  and they say he didn't specifically name the groups it took me a couple hours
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:30.640]  even figure out who those groups were I've never it's like groups saying they're
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:34.120]  all right but they're in some south thing I don't even know what these groups
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:38.040]  are and then now it's Trump's fault again what do you say about that well
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:43.320]  first of all stop blaming our president for these crazy ignorant groups with
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:47.160]  these ignorant ideology or whatever they're spewing the hate that they're
[02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:52.720]  spewing you know who I blame for all of this I blame the mayor of Charlottesville
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:58.000]  who knew that a hate group was coming and did not prepare for it or did not
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:02.560]  protect his citizens that has nothing to do with the president of the United
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:06.400]  States that's right the president of the United States address the issue he came
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:11.320]  back out today and addresses again and called them by their names right any of
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:14.840]  those groups that was down there creating violence the Justice Department is
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:18.720]  going to be dealing with you because at the end of the day we have a person
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:22.840]  that's dead and we have several people that's been injured all because of hate
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:27.240]  and exactly and the mayor now admits they ordered a stand-down mayor Michael
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:30.520]  Singer and by all the laws I've read the police said we've been ordered to stand
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:34.200]  down when they could have stopped it and that and they made everybody march
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:38.360]  together to actually stir it up which they caught Obama doing remember the
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:42.080]  Justice Department in Maryland in places why do you think they want to do
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:46.440]  something like that well you know they want to create havoc and divine they
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:50.120]  love it when people are bickering because all of that stuff play out on
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:54.760]  television and that's how the very fake news make their money because you know
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:18:00.320]  their ratings are dropping and it's so sad that we are being put against each
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:06.720]  other but you know what people got to understand slavery the KKK and all of
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:11.080]  these other movements were driven and deemed and they all come from the
[02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:14.720]  Democratic Party they are the ones started all of this food that's right
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:19.600]  but it's time to put a stop stop to it because it will not be tolerated in our
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:23.360]  country what it's sounding like and then looking like is that it's the same
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:28.360]  script but different math that's right the KKK running around with a white
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:32.480]  sheet but you also got another group that's got their hands tied up in black
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:36.720]  and black gear that's right so it's still I mean it's all they go out and do
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:39.920]  racial attacks trying to get people to them who are white do the racial attacks
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:43.640]  I always love how it's mainly white people screaming all this anti-white
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:47.600]  stuff trying to get a race war going and then it's Soros funded it's ridiculous
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:53.160]  so obvious no it's very obvious and it's so sad and it's sad that people let
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:56.840]  other people use them like that that's why we have to get a handle on it you
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:02.240]  know we're two black women and we get hate all day we people throw race we're
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:07.760]  with they're always being very very very racist towards us and if you don't
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:11.280]  believe us all you have to do is go look at our wall of shame and dying in silk
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:16.320]  dot com and are you talking about mainly leftist saying racist things to you say
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:20.160]  absolutely they say racist things to us all the time go on our page go on our
[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:25.880]  website okay so racism have to be stopped from exactly let me say this
[02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:29.280]  thing ladies we got to go to break when I come back I'll talk about our lawsuit
[02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:32.840]  I'm serious I want to sue Google and YouTube for discrimination against us
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:37.000]  they've cut us down by almost 90% as well I guess it's more with you I don't
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:40.000]  want to sue but I need to sue for everybody's first amendment so I'd like
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.920]  to talk about if you get the right lawyer or whatever helping fund your

[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:20.200]  by the way behind the scenes we have guests coming on the show and when
[02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:23.840]  those people say they're even coming on the show anti-fab the Democrats
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:28.480]  everybody calls them emails them and says we're gonna we're gonna ruin your
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:31.960]  life we're gonna go after your family we're gonna shut you down we're gonna
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:36.200]  say horrible things about you don't even go on my show as if that hurts me I
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:38.960]  consider all day by myself and talk it's just interesting to talk to other
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:43.400]  people it just shows how we're all being terrorized and these ladies with
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:47.400]  hundreds of millions of views all over national television they're loved by
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:51.640]  people they're entrepreneurial they're just I'd call them a right-wing or left
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:57.480]  wing just let's have prosperity let's be positive and 95% of their revenue gone
[02:24:57.480 --> 02:25:03.640]  first they did 60% against us last year then it was 75 now it's over 90 we're
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:07.200]  bringing in you know hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars into
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:11.320]  this show and be able to fund ourselves off YouTube that's basically all gone I
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:15.440]  mean it's it's it's less than 10% but we've got other ways to fund ourselves
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:20.840]  but next is total censorship and that's already happening so I do because I was
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:23.000]  talking to Gary Havener in the break and he you know he runs stuff in over a
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.160]  hundred countries we have to sue them because what they're doing is wrong it's
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:31.720]  racketeering we must stand and we got to start suing the Antifa we got to start
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:35.920]  suing these these these people who want to you know push things don't go out and
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:38.680]  fight with them in the streets don't go out you know fight with a white
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:42.400]  supremacist idiots either it's time to do things legally through the system
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:47.480]  diamond and silk ladies lay it out for folks I agree with you yes go ahead on
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:51.120]  unless we may have to go ahead and sue that's right because these are you know
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:56.200]  listen we have been victimized this is bias and this is clearly discrimination
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:26:00.760]  that's right tell me I can't talk about my president and if I do I'm going to
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:04.520]  withhold something from you that's not fair to us because we built that
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:07.800]  platform that's right I don't believe that YouTube thought this all the way out
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:11.240]  and thought this all the way through in every business have a right to regulate
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:15.640]  but they do not have a right to discriminate and terminate and manipulate
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:20.680]  in order to dominate that they don't have a right to do that right sorry Gary
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:24.040]  lost his audio for a minute but I could hear you they were saying they have a
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:27.720]  right to regulate things but not to discriminate they don't have a right to
[02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:32.520]  discriminate and timidate or manipulate just to dominate right don't have a
[02:26:32.520 --> 02:26:38.280]  right to do that and guess what YouTube is a social media platform social media
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:42.480]  platform is people that get on the platform with creative creative it's
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:46.440]  like a telephone imagine if somebody was on the telephone with you telling you
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:51.680]  what to talk about I mean this is beyond North Korea but but one thing in
[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:55.440]  YouTube policy it doesn't tell you that you have to be liberal to sign up that's
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:26:59.560]  right it doesn't tell you so the deal is is you're trying to shut down my
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:03.040]  concern they're lying exactly they're lying in their rules they're saying
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:06.360]  they're open and free but if you're not a mainline establishment liberal you're
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:12.160]  not welcome that's exactly what I see that's how we feel that's how YouTube is
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:16.840]  making us feel because we're black we're conservative we're republicans and we
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:20.720]  are lower supporters to the president and now it's a problem well I'm looking
[02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:25.640]  into the best discrimination antitrust lawyers and I'm giving you my
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:30.520]  commitment that we're going to find the lawyers I'm going to sue them I would
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:33.840]  like you to join me as plaintiffs Paul Watson is going to be involved as well
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:38.200]  because we need to get this out in court we need to this is bullying this is the
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:42.520]  shutdown of free speech and I mean this is so unamerican this is so dangerous
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:48.200]  yeah you know there's plenty plenty of precedent for this power lines that run
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:52.720]  across the country pipelines you know these infrastructures that that serve
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:57.600]  the community in a good cable television is another previous example they have
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:01.960]  got to have the ability to provide services to everyone not to be not
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:09.120]  monopolistic so this is a violation of certainly of monopoly laws that exist in
[02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:14.120]  this country and we have Google and YouTube openly previously saying that
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:18.200]  and arguing that so they could have a monopoly we have them that you're
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:23.200]  liberally doing this they are openly doing this here and what we're telling our
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:26.320]  people is to go to our YouTube channel the viewers view and subscribe to us and
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:30.480]  a special thank you to everybody that is contributing to us through PayPal at

[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:38.840]  YouTube won't monetize you we will they love our strong voices and they love
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:42.320]  the fact that we tell it like it is and we're not afraid to tell it like it is
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:47.160]  and YouTube you're gonna hear from diamond oh yes exactly and then the
[02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:50.400]  anti-fibre target your your your PayPal but you just got to fight through that
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:53.640]  and file suit there I had PayPal about seven years ago try that with us and I
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:56.880]  got the lawyers involved and it's because hey you know what I'm allowed to
[02:28:56.880 --> 02:29:00.680]  eat your restaurant I'm falling the laws I'm allowed to use your bathroom I
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:04.400]  mean it really does come down to a civil rights movement doesn't it that's
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:08.480]  right because our civil rights have been encroached upon even our political
[02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:12.640]  rights you know and we have you can't do that it's discrimination and it's
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:16.160]  finding that's right and I think they're trying to cut off voices yeah if we cut
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:19.000]  that's right because they can't debate us they can't debate us diamond and

[02:32:52.320 --> 02:33:05.760]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:09.360]  lines of the info war
[02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:25.040]  well Jason Kessler was the leader of the white nationalist rally that he called
[02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:31.400]  uniting the right I'll tell you point blank I don't agree with what he did I
[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:36.640]  think you walked right into a trap but the media will then act like this guy
[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:39.760]  satan incarnate but then if you got black nationalist and Hispanic nationalist
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:43.600]  groups that are saying kill all the white people and they're teaching that at
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:46.760]  universities and towards sorrows and others are pushing that and they're
[02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:50.480]  saying you don't have no whites on the campus day that's going to create this
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:54.840]  white backlash I'm worried about cancer rates going up in everybody I'm worried
[02:33:54.840 --> 02:33:58.320]  about the big studies out that the flicker rate on these modern light bulbs
[02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:01.320]  are frying our brains that was in mainstream news yesterday I told folks
[02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:05.080]  about with engineers 20 years ago I'm worried about humanity making it
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:09.720]  together but also understand the left has created racial identity politics that
[02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:15.400]  they're using cheating against the open free society and the system that the
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:19.200]  United States basically established and set up and also get to sit there and
[02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:25.560]  experience as the social contract is broken classical racism the opposite of
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:28.480]  what Martin Luther King talked about where the media says it's about what
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:33.560]  color you are not about the character your deeds so there's that argument yes
[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:37.200]  but and there's the argument from the minorities that they've had races who
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:42.920]  step to them so they should be racist the point is it's being manipulated why
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:46.840]  aren't we talking about the police that stood down and the mayor that ordered it
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:50.840]  why aren't we talking about sorrows funding all these anti-white anti-
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:55.480]  American groups so I've got the media out there saying that you know Mike
[02:34:55.480 --> 02:34:59.160]  Cernovich is Jason Kessler even though they fight with each other all day and
[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:03.040]  that he's the leader of the alt-right or that Paul Watson is Paul Watson rightly
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:08.320]  said we're the new right or the new libertarian movement a lot of people are
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:11.560]  classical liberals that don't like the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton I
[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:15.400]  tweeted an image this morning of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Hillary a real
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:19.440]  photo of just that where they look like conniving evil witches then you read the
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:23.160]  WikiLeaks it's the worst stuff you could ever imagine how to create racial
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:29.360]  divide how to keep people desperate so yes mr. Kessler has his right to march
[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:34.880]  and the police stood down and so who's the bigger center here the guy that
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:37.720]  thinks folks are out to get white people so he's joining with white people I
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:41.120]  think it's misguided I think it's you know wrong I think it's playing into the
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:45.160]  larger global trap but it's tribalism it's an old human instinct it's what the
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:49.280]  race is blacks in his panics and others you go to any prison it's segregated a
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:53.760]  long race this is a reality but what about the police that were ordered to
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:58.160]  stand down are they being looked at what about the mayor and then he tried to
[02:35:58.160 --> 02:36:01.480]  march or go speak at the courthouse yesterday we're gonna play that footage
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:07.040]  and the police let him get beat up and attacked yet again and the media acted
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:12.400]  like they'd started it they'd done it yet again so in these Democrat cities
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:17.720]  they're not letting people have their free speech let's start it over with some
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:41.000]  audio here is Jason Kessler trying to speak here it is
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:55.080]  they're teaching at the university's white genocide now because they've gone pure
[02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:59.640]  race let's keep rolling in here this is from NBC but the point is I'm not gonna
[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:04.520]  then go join with that that then put me in our groups to control us they're
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:08.640]  trying to start a civil war to ban free speech to ban public gatherings they're
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:13.640]  doing it on YouTube they're giving it exciting music look here's the police
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:21.640]  look at the police there watching as this happens and then finally they tackle
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:26.480]  some woman that attacks this virtue signaling lady wow and the police get
[02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:31.320]  them out but they didn't do that in Charlotte but but notice it was state
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:36.400]  police that were there state police had to come in you know Gary Haven we just
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:40.520]  had such a fun time talking to diamond and silk there and I can just purely
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:44.000]  praise them free market want to make America great Christian ladies love
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:47.480]  Trump it feels so good to have that solidarity why can't we just come
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:50.440]  together and have that solidarity instead of just getting in our groups and
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:54.200]  letting Soros a true Nazi collaborator control us yeah you know we better
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:58.480]  figure this out because that's the only hope we have as a nation you know Alex
[02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:03.160]  you're not both Christians and we're called to love each other and and you
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:07.400]  know you see the love in those woman's faces that were our guest early earlier
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:13.000]  we are united together for free speech for freedom for our families and we've
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:17.040]  got to be focused on that and you gotta realize the enemy out there you know
[02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:22.600]  they create control in order at chaos and this is all by design I tell you what
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:28.000]  so obvious now that you got almost blind and not to no offense to blind people to
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:33.320]  not see that this is by design you know I'm interested in what Jason Kessler was
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:37.920]  about you know I saw a little bit of the motive for example pulling down the
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:43.840]  statue of Robert E. Lee and I understand what that's about but we really
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:48.240]  didn't get a clear message from from their organization in their their intent
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:52.720]  and then he said it wasn't about being racial but when you got I mean you know
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:56.080]  then was the KKK welcome there then I mean let's find out from him because
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:39:00.760]  regardless if he doesn't have a right to free speech nobody does in the media so
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:04.800]  anti-free speech they'll run headlines Jones defends white nationalist free
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:09.160]  speech and I defend the new back Panther Party that is says kill all the white
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:12.600]  people as long as you know I don't support him saying that but they have
[02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:17.920]  the right to rally but he's been attacked yet again Jason Kessler Jason Kessler
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:21.560]  net the organizer of the biggest thing in the country in the world right now you
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:24.880]  think nuclear war with North Korea matter but no not that it's all about
[02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:30.460]  this so Jason Kessler what's the latest okay look Alex what I tried to do was
[02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:35.120]  organize the chaotic element and sometimes politically incorrect elements
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:39.520]  of the alt-right into a civil right movement for white people because I felt
[02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:44.840]  like the time had come that we needed to have it was our opening step perfect no
[02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:48.360]  it wasn't but what happened was there was a coordinated attack by this
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:54.400]  establishment to defame us and to defame President Trump by association this is
[02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:58.920]  like Clarence Thomas talked about decades ago this is a high-tech lynching
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:04.960]  and I urge people not to feed into what the establishment is trying to pull on
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:10.080]  me trying to pull on the alt-right you need to have a fair assessment we have
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:14.040]  put our word out there from the beginning this was not a neo-nazi rally it
[02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:18.080]  was not even a white nationalist rally even though I did invite some people
[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:24.320]  who do identify as a white nationalist what this rally was about was number one
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:29.000]  standing up for these monuments because it was just the Robert E. Lee statue
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:32.560]  which is being taken down they took down Christopher Columbus at Pepperdine
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:37.000]  University they removed the bust of the white founders at King's College of
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:41.960]  London because it wouldn't be sensitive and let me say this then they've got to
[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:46.640]  take down the pyramids because some of them were built by slaves that's what
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:51.520]  I'm saying but it's only being used as a cudgel to attack white people these
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:58.280]  historical errors like slavery or perhaps wars of conquest these are things
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:03.400]  that everybody did but a historical revisionist are only using it no no the
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:06.960]  leftist the globalists have turned it into an anti-white thing to use that as a
[02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:11.280]  political bully to make the voting block of white submit to the cultural
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:13.880]  tyranny now if you don't submit your kid being taught I'd have sex when they're
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:17.960]  five by the pedophile lobby you know you're anti-gay I mean I understand how
[02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:22.240]  they extend it out I'm saying the federally run I mean you understand
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:25.800]  that half the people in white nationalist groups are feds the Southern
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:29.400]  Poverty Law Center has been caught running Elohim City white supremacist
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:32.280]  compounds I mean did you know you know about the Jewish guy that got caught
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:36.520]  attacking Jewish cemeteries they were blaming on Trump supporters I mean all
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:41.240]  I'm saying is they use all this and all these old images of guys in you know
[02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:45.480]  white nationalist symbols and stuff as a way to project that onto Trump that's
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:48.920]  actually trying to bring the country together yeah those were false flags
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:56.120]  Alex like this Nazi Tuastika that was put out there in the media I never saw
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:01.120]  anybody with that and I explicitly told people do not bring KKK do not bring
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:06.000]  Nazi symbols them to this rally that is not what we are about people who did that
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:12.480]  stuff did it in defiance of my orders but yet they are always gonna pick out
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:17.720]  some people like that who are not listening who maybe are misguided or
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:21.000]  whatever and uses to smear everybody there were a lot of people who were just
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:25.600]  normal Trump supporters normal Confederate heritage American heritage
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:30.200]  supporters I swear to God if you looked in that part before they disperse us
[02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:35.480]  and forced this chaos there were you know like elderly people in there you
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:40.440]  know just waiting to hear some speeches Kessler Kessler let me ask you this are
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:44.160]  you part of any foundations have you ever worked for the feds were you part of
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:50.920]  Occupy were you an Obama supporter at one time I supported Obama I regret it
[02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:56.960]  now I did not see the air of my ways until about two years ago when the
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:01.080]  shootings started happening and they were blaming everything on the racist
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:05.400]  police at that time and I knew that the crime statistics were off I felt like a
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:10.840]  lot of the other identity politics stuff with pushing the gender wage gap so that
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:15.160]  that was all if I knew it was and and towards the end of Obama's presidency I
[02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:20.520]  could see that he had conceded the White House to very radical left-wing cultural
[02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:26.160]  Marxist identity people who hated whites who hate men who ate Christians so yes
[02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:30.360]  I've had a change of heart just like our president don't you understand the cut
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:33.680]  out here and can we pull up the guy I remember was about six months ago Trump
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:37.000]  said I don't know these Jewish center if that's real they may be fake and they
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.400]  said oh you hate Jews then turn out it was a liberal young Jewish man doing it
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:43.840]  we can pull those articles up former journalists arrested charged with threats
[02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:47.200]  against Jewish facilities attacking them and of course he had worked for the
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:52.280]  intercept so there you go and I'm telling you I'm gonna dig all the old
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:55.960]  videos up and shove it down raw story everybody else's throats they're saying
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:43:59.960]  I'm anti-Semitic now because I said I've gone out to rallies and later KKK
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:03.480]  leaders turned out to be federal informants and turned out to be leading
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:07.760]  KKK groups and then they had Jewish groups literally like they got it from
[02:44:07.760 --> 02:44:13.160]  leftover stuff from Raiders the Lost Ark actual SA Nazi uniforms and it was
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:17.240]  clearly and it came out that that's what that was it was fake so I'm gonna put it
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:20.400]  all together again if everybody and prove that and they go oh you're saying
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:24.280]  Jews are Nazis no I'm saying some leftist groups you know Anglo's black
[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:28.840]  white Hispanic Jewish they go out and do false flags most these attacks are false
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:33.240]  flags and so I'm saying here you are a well-spoken guys for to occupy that's
[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:37.800]  deep globalist liberal ideology then you're part of Obama support and then
[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:42.080]  suddenly you realize you can't beat the nationalist patriot movement that's gonna
[02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:47.160]  bring everybody together with the leftist ideology that is racist against
[02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:51.560]  minorities and wants to control them you couldn't defeat them that way and so you
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:56.200]  went and set all this up and it was all perfectly ready and timed and meant to
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:01.840]  cause this to try to bring down Trump no absolutely not I am a Trump supporter
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:05.920]  I've been a right-wing person for about two years I'm not your traditional
[02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:09.720]  conservative but like I said just like Donald Trump I was a Democrat at one
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:14.840]  time and I moved over people have a change of opinion as far as the occupy
[02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:19.080]  stuff I was interested in that at the time I was never one of the anti-fra
[02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:24.280]  or people but I did see that there was a globalist elite there is a wealthy 1%
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:29.600]  class that has been extracting a lot of things from the bottom the rest of the
[02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:34.680]  country and while I totally disavowed the occupy movement and the leftist I do
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:40.320]  think that there is a concentration of elite power in the government and in the
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:45.120]  mega corporations and so forth which are working with each other to hold down
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:51.280]  everyday Americans so I still have this very much distrust of power I'll say
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:55.320]  this usually the foundation operatives will they usually leftist they will not
[02:45:55.320 --> 02:45:59.040]  come on the show that's that's one struck it was not strike that isn't there
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:02.880]  that he's not really a Fed or his word Soros or a Carnegie endowment or a deep
[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:07.040]  state or an FBI informant but just like Hal Turner and so many others nine times
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:11.800]  out of ten I called him a federal guy forever and it came out in his email he
[02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:15.680]  was a Fed he went to prison came out in federal court he was a Fed I want to
[02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:20.240]  warn you Kessler particularly if you are a Fed they're going to burn you in the
[02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:25.280]  end so you're in great danger I'm not Alex don't spread stuff like that without
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:30.480]  evidence come on man like at that press conference yesterday I went by myself
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:34.920]  because I didn't want to endanger other people other people who worked with me
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:41.240]  are you know they're having their jobs threatened with a Democrat mayor the
[02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:45.880]  threat you should be the emails and the phone calls that I get nonstop day and
[02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:51.320]  night threatening my life threatening my family's lives and I walked through a
[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:55.640]  crowd about a hundred antifa and black lives matter to get to that press
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:59.560]  conference yesterday I was ready to die Alex I was ready to die for what I
[02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:03.800]  believed in and I thought somebody was gonna stab me or shoot me and I in
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:09.920]  nobody in their right mind would ever ever ever go into a situation like what
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:13.800]  I went into yesterday where I didn't have police protection and risk their life
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:17.760]  if you know I've got a hand to it nobody's denying nobody's denying there
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:21.160]  aren't a bunch of crazies out there and I'm not accusing you of being a Fed sir
[02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:26.760]  what I'm saying is do you recognize that nine times out of ten or more the
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:32.440]  attacks on Jewish sinners black churches dormitories it always turns out to be
[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:37.840]  leftist doing it and we keep catching the the right-wing groups being led by
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:43.480]  the left well absolutely there are those false flag elements all the time I don't
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:49.160]  know that the leadership of movements are really leftist co-conspirators as you
[02:47:49.160 --> 02:47:53.520]  say but certainly I've seen a lot of articles on Breitbart for instance got
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:56.880]  a great job of cataloging all these times when they say that there's a
[02:47:56.880 --> 02:48:05.040]  supposed hate attack where like there's the poop swastika that was on the the
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:18.600]  glass of that it's almost totally fake to find a real KKK member that can
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:22.720]  actually talk or get out of their mother's trailer is very rare I mean
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:27.840]  every major group that gets you know in trouble is led by a Fed and so I'll tell
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:32.360]  you I'll give you an example of that Alex right when I started to unite the
[02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:37.280]  right rally they knew the powers to be knew that this was too powerful movement
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:40.800]  and they wanted to fame us with federal informants and there are those people
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:47.000]  out there so the same damn day that my rally was announced a KKK rally was
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:51.760]  announced for July 8th and we looked into this guy we said who is this supposed
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:57.200]  to KKK guy because everybody like you say told me that the KKK are all federal
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:49:01.200]  informants and so forth so we looked into this guy's name is Chris Barker he's
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:05.840]  the leader of the Loyal White Knights and he is a federal informant and I said
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:09.920]  to myself what in the world why is this man coming out here and trying to
[02:49:09.920 --> 02:49:13.760]  spiral it because they're trying to create and make it racial that's what
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:17.400]  the left's trying to make it racial and you don't beat it by making it racial you
[02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:20.400]  beat it by making it economic and spiritual and unity but Gary you got
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:25.720]  questions yeah Jason Kessler do you have an opinion of who was driving that
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:34.760]  car I can only say that what the the city did when they forced people out of
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:40.560]  that park that way created a atmosphere of chaos I'm watching these videos I
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:45.760]  don't know who this guy is or what his native motivations are but my instinct
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:51.840]  is as I'm seeing this guy slowly pulling through this road he doesn't seem like
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:56.120]  he he's like gunning it from the beginning then people take some bats or
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:00.360]  some other implements to it and maybe this guy freaked out had a flight or
[02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:06.240]  flight either got scared or he got angry really quickly and he drove and when
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:10.560]  he did he hit these people then there were all these folks who were obviously
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:15.640]  waiting around the area smashing it with baseball bats well but he was white
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:18.600]  so he deserved it see that's where I get mad at all the at all the racists
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:22.360]  and killing white folks that attack whites if they see him whites do get
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:25.400]  attacked all over the country driving through these riots and drug out even
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:29.160]  killed the media just shuts it down and at first they were saying his car was
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:32.560]  attacked he panicked and did it now they're saying that's not the case he
[02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:37.040]  doesn't look like because of political pressure just like when the Muslims do
[02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:42.360]  this stuff and they try and cover for them this is Jason Kessler Muslims have
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:47.440]  never done anything Muslims have never committed a single crime now you stop

[02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:37.440]  getting on our knees and praying and look coming together that's what I'm but
[02:54:37.440 --> 02:54:40.800]  sure they're filling all these other groups full of racism sure minorities we
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:45.560]  just as racist as any you know white grand dragon and the left wants that to
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:49.280]  put us under their control does that mean people shouldn't respond to it all I
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:55.080]  know is they're trying to shut me off with with you know Tom Brokaw going on
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:59.880]  TV saying Alex Jones is a quote unalloyed that means total racist that
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:03.440]  doesn't hurt me because that's an old race bait or using rates to control
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:07.440]  people for 45 years on air he's a joke he's a lie he discredits himself but
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:10.640]  they need this narrative to work they've been saying all the Republicans are
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:14.120]  racist for years if you want to cut tatches you're racist if you don't want
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:19.760]  Obamacare you're racist and so they need this they need this race for they need
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:25.400]  this crisis they need this division I say we shouldn't give any far the type
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:28.720]  of situations they want but then I get we're seeing folks have their first
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:32.640]  amendment eradicated like when he got attacked for a second time yesterday
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:37.600]  mr. Kessler so that's a question for seeing in the rest of them do you Jason
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:42.200]  Kessler have a first amendment it doesn't seem like I do anymore and that's a
[02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:45.980]  very big problem Alex about federal court judge ruled that the city of
[02:55:45.980 --> 02:55:49.360]  Charlottesville was discriminating against me and unite the right based on
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:54.080]  the content of our speech even the ACLU who completely disagrees with us on
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:58.840]  everything else fought for us and won that case in court and yet people are
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:03.840]  surprised when this violence breaks out because the city of Charlottesville
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:07.960]  refused to protect the rally they hated what we had to say so much that they
[02:56:07.960 --> 02:56:11.880]  were willing to create violence they were willing to get people killed to
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:16.240]  shut it down and I want people to take a long view on this thing I know right
[02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:22.400]  now this is very hot though the left executed a a successful hit but they
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:28.680]  really messed up to get it done there is collusion between the Charlottesville
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:33.240]  city government and I believe Terry McCollough and we are going to be
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:37.200]  raising money for a legal defense we're going to make sure all of this gets
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:41.840]  investigated I want if anybody in the Trump administration is listening mr.
[02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:47.200]  Sessions whoever the real civil rights abuses happen against the attendees of
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:53.240]  our rally also happen to the reporters from info or is the hill women being
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:59.360]  attacked I mean we need to focus in on why is the MSM protecting the anti-fascum
[02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:03.440]  but you forget the debate about who's good who's bad the government at a
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:07.640]  criminal level is pushing this and Jason Kessler I agree with you on that but I
[02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:13.200]  think that you should have a unity rally against racism period racism against
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:18.360]  whites blacks Hispanics everybody and ask everybody to come together and that
[02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:22.400]  would be world-changing news if you had KKK guys coming and taking their rubs
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:26.600]  off who were real KKK that didn't really exist and apologizing and the black
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:30.680]  nationalist apologizing and realizing George Soros is the enemy that would be
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:33.120]  the answer and that's how we're going to move forward because the globalist I
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:37.480]  think that's a bit idealistic and naive I mean every time Republican try and take
[02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:40.640]  the moral high ground and say we're not going to play into the identity politics
[02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:45.720]  the NAACP the Al Sharpton's the world keep acts extracting blood from us and
[02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:49.480]  blood from us and blood from us there has to be somebody who is willing to stay
[02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:53.280]  nothing against the other groups of people they have a right to exist they
[02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:58.040]  have a right to have liberties but white people need defenders too well I'm not
[02:57:58.040 --> 02:58:01.120]  saying that there shouldn't be groups and organizations that you know say that
[02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:03.720]  whites have a right to heritage and culture and they're trying to extinct it
[02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:07.040]  the globalist want to extinct all real cultures they can override with a
[02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:11.960]  synthetic globalism but you see I'm saying you should have a rally bring
[02:58:11.960 --> 02:58:17.440]  everybody together who calls for a peace rally and have people just accept
[02:58:17.440 --> 02:58:21.280]  each other as humans and say I will honor you and appreciate you and then of
[02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:24.440]  the racist minority groups don't want to come that's their problem you then have
[02:58:24.440 --> 02:58:29.000]  the moral high ground Jason Kessler I challenge you to have that rally please
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:33.200]  keep checking in with us I appreciate you having the courage to join us and you
[02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:37.400]  have courage to do the anti-fossil control they won't come on we'll be right

[03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:29.960]  the car came in it was all choreographed then you got a guy who was the anti-fub
[03:00:29.960 --> 03:00:37.160]  Obama supporter occupied total Soros funding he now is the leader of the
[03:00:37.160 --> 03:00:41.120]  white nationalist I don't know I was talking to Gary during the break saying
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:45.480]  this looks bad and then you had that Soros's birthday and now the media is
[03:00:45.480 --> 03:00:51.080]  all lined up to go crazy the mystery of evil that's it nothing happens by
[03:00:51.080 --> 03:00:55.760]  coincidence this is very very well orchestrated event including the
[03:00:55.760 --> 03:01:00.200]  suspicious killing that had to take place to bring this up to the to the
[03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:05.000]  international news level in the in the level of hate that the mainstream media
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:08.960]  has been able to generate out of this whole thing so right at the worst part
[03:01:08.960 --> 03:01:14.440]  of the end of the big hot dirty summer yep big dirty black summer and we were
[03:01:14.440 --> 03:01:20.200]  warned you know by them that this summer was going to be the summer of eat
[03:01:20.200 --> 03:01:23.640]  something like that remember at the beginning the summer summer rage summer
[03:01:23.640 --> 03:01:27.840]  rage and I'm suppose taking so long here it is they're not that quick in there
[03:01:27.840 --> 03:01:30.760]  they're quick but not that way that is happening by accident there we have so
[03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:36.040]  we've had at least the end of the summer a true rage event soccer making up for
[03:01:36.040 --> 03:01:39.680]  lost ground I'm sick of somebody shoots my with a gun that I'm responsible or
[03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:43.440]  some white guy runs money over I'm responsible now if you're part of the
[03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:46.840]  same church the same mosque the same ideology you're calling for it and then
[03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:49.440]  somebody at your church or Moscow somebody with well then you are part of
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:53.520]  it but just to say that oh one person got killed it's the alt-right fall it's
[03:01:53.520 --> 03:01:57.360]  the police and the mayor for they are they're paid they have a duty they've
[03:01:57.360 --> 03:02:01.920]  sworn an oath derelictional duty that mayor needs to go to present and I
[03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:06.080]  take in George Soros needs to be investigated and I believe charged with
[03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:11.000]  sedition for organizing and funding this for the purpose of creating this
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  violence between people that old bastard needs to get his due and we have a
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:21.200]  president that's just the man to do it you know this guy may be real though
[03:02:21.200 --> 03:02:25.360]  because so many of the leftists that are anti-racist I find behind the scenes
[03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:28.720]  they kind of flip back and forth and say racist stuff it's like a dual thing
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:32.120]  those are guilty about it so they want to play both sides it's more like a
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:38.680]  opportunistic thing and then some folks you know get into the left thing they
[03:02:38.680 --> 03:02:41.560]  want to do right and they they see how racist the left is and they go I'll
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:45.240]  just join the other side because they were already kind of racially based
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:49.520]  yeah whereas I'm just based on what you do and what you stand for now it's
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:54.920]  peculiar you know seeing his face and in in listening what we'd actually see his
[03:02:54.920 --> 03:02:59.680]  face but on the video and when he went yesterday to the to the press event it
[03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:07.160]  was attacked interesting set of events but you can't swing a stick at a white
[03:03:07.160 --> 03:03:11.960]  supremacist meeting and not hit a fit yeah that's true all right you're

[03:05:53.720 --> 03:05:58.400]  more research I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully
[03:05:58.400 --> 03:06:02.560]  aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better
[03:06:02.560 --> 03:06:07.040]  nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[03:06:07.040 --> 03:06:11.240]  of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and so I
[03:06:11.240 --> 03:06:16.440]  set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated bone broth from

[03:08:09.360 --> 03:08:14.760]  I was honestly shocked we all know about fake news we all know how fake news
[03:08:14.760 --> 03:08:19.920]  works we've all seen it in real time we know about the people like Jake Tapper
[03:08:19.920 --> 03:08:24.880]  and the likes of Don Lemon but I really couldn't believe it when I saw the New
[03:08:24.880 --> 03:08:30.480]  York Times and the Washington Post and all of television media over the weekend
[03:08:30.480 --> 03:08:35.640]  saying President Trump is yet to disavow racial violence in Charlottesville
[03:08:35.640 --> 03:08:40.400]  even though he put put out multiple tweets literally multiple tweets and
[03:08:40.400 --> 03:08:46.080]  yet they still claimed that that had not happened it was truly something to
[03:08:46.080 --> 03:08:52.000]  behold fake news. Now I'm about to be joined by VJ Chokalingam and I want to
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:56.400]  be clear with all of the race baiting stuff and going on this is not why he's
[03:08:56.400 --> 03:09:02.080]  on the show in fact he's actually an expert in this field VJ Chokalingam you
[03:09:02.080 --> 03:09:07.600]  may have heard his story the author of almost black I got into medical school
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:13.800]  by saying I was black I lied now VJ is also he is in the admissions industry so
[03:09:13.800 --> 03:09:17.760]  he has a background in this VJ thank you so much for joining us today. It's a
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:23.920]  pleasure to be on. So first for starters let me ask you what motivated you to
[03:09:23.920 --> 03:09:28.320]  pretend to be black to get into medical school what was the motivating factor?
[03:09:28.320 --> 03:09:34.880]  Sure back in 1999 I was a hard-partying college frat boy and I started to
[03:09:34.880 --> 03:09:39.360]  freak out about my own chances of getting into medical school and after
[03:09:39.360 --> 03:09:43.440]  especially after all my Indian American friends I got rejected so it happens to
[03:09:43.440 --> 03:09:47.200]  be that I studied statistics at the University of Chicago so I looked at the
[03:09:47.200 --> 03:09:50.560]  data that was published by the American Association of Medical Colleges and I
[03:09:50.560 --> 03:09:54.960]  came to a really odd conclusion which is that it was a lot easier for me to get
[03:09:54.960 --> 03:10:00.600]  in as a black American than as an Asian American I'm in I'm a dark-skinned South
[03:10:00.600 --> 03:10:04.520]  Indian as you can you can see if you look at me so I came up with the scam of
[03:10:04.520 --> 03:10:09.440]  shaving my head trimming my eyelashes and applying joining the organization of
[03:10:09.440 --> 03:10:12.800]  black students and applying to medical school as an African-American and
[03:10:12.800 --> 03:10:19.360]  despite the fact that I had a very low 3.1 GPA I managed to get waitlisted
[03:10:19.360 --> 03:10:22.600]  Washington University and the University of Pennsylvania those are the third and
[03:10:22.600 --> 03:10:26.040]  fourth best medical schools in the country as well as getting into St.
[03:10:26.040 --> 03:10:30.840]  Louis University School of Medicine in Missouri despite the fact that my 3.1
[03:10:30.840 --> 03:10:37.240]  GPA was dramatically lower than their average of 3.7 so I suspect you know I
[03:10:37.240 --> 03:10:40.720]  discovered that it was a lot easier to get into a top college or graduate school
[03:10:40.720 --> 03:10:47.080]  as as an African-American than it is as an Asian-American. Now were you shocked or
[03:10:47.080 --> 03:10:51.120]  were you worried at all that they might come back at you and look into your
[03:10:51.120 --> 03:10:54.480]  background or were you worried that somebody might say you're fudging these
[03:10:54.480 --> 03:10:58.600]  reports or what were your thoughts on that yeah the climax of the book is
[03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:02.560]  actually in a medical school interview where they actually confronted me about
[03:11:02.560 --> 03:11:07.600]  lying about my race and my response was I don't want to talk about my ethnic
[03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:12.240]  background I want to talk about my qualifications to be a physician which I
[03:11:12.240 --> 03:11:17.680]  think is the entire point of my book you know you shouldn't judge people based
[03:11:17.680 --> 03:11:21.040]  upon their race which is what the colleges and university are doing right
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:25.720]  now and I know that as an admissions consultant for interview SOS.com here in
[03:11:25.720 --> 03:11:30.560]  Los Angeles is that you know race is an important factor in college and
[03:11:30.560 --> 03:11:33.960]  university and graduate school admissions including medical school and it
[03:11:33.960 --> 03:11:37.960]  shouldn't be. And the priorities here is what you're saying I would agree with you
[03:11:37.960 --> 03:11:42.200]  is that the priorities should be do you meet the standards do you have the
[03:11:42.200 --> 03:11:46.280]  capabilities are you the best it's not about what skin color you have or this
[03:11:46.280 --> 03:11:49.600]  that or the other thing or the politics involved it's are you the most qualified
[03:11:49.600 --> 03:11:54.640]  and that's what you're saying the system is is not measuring people with that
[03:11:54.640 --> 03:11:58.920]  stick. I mean I want to point out you know it is basically the way that
[03:11:58.920 --> 03:12:02.320]  affirmative action works and a lot of people don't know that is very simple
[03:12:02.320 --> 03:12:06.080]  okay all of the data wherever it's available on university admissions shows
[03:12:06.080 --> 03:12:09.280]  that it's hardest to get into college or graduate school as an Asian American
[03:12:09.280 --> 03:12:13.720]  it's slightly easier to get in it's second hardest as a white person it's
[03:12:13.720 --> 03:12:18.000]  third hardest as a Hispanic and it's easiest as an Asian American I'm sorry
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:24.240]  as an African American for example a kid who applied to medical school in 2015
[03:12:24.240 --> 03:12:29.720]  with a 3.1 GPA and 31 MCAT score had an 18% chance of admission as an Asian
[03:12:29.720 --> 03:12:41.480]  American 36% as a white American 56% as a Hispanic and 76% as a black American so
[03:12:41.480 --> 03:12:46.720]  it's a heck of a lot easier to get into college or grad school as an African
[03:12:46.720 --> 03:12:51.600]  American than it is as a Asian American but it's also harder for white people
[03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:55.120]  as well well and again you're not just saying this because you had the
[03:12:55.120 --> 03:12:59.840]  experience you wrote the book almost black but you also are in the admissions
[03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:03.880]  industry you know about this stuff I'm just curious is anyone else VJ that you
[03:13:03.880 --> 03:13:07.160]  work with does anyone else have the same concerns is anyone else raising this
[03:13:07.160 --> 03:13:12.240]  awareness does anybody else even care our president cares our president cares
[03:13:12.240 --> 03:13:18.360]  a lot you know President Trump famously you know criticized President Obama and
[03:13:18.360 --> 03:13:24.000]  Senator Elizabeth Warren for exploiting and supporting Harvard's racist
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:28.860]  affirmative action policies President Trump famously called Senator Elizabeth
[03:13:28.860 --> 03:13:34.080]  Warren Pocahontas because she pretended to be a Native American in order to
[03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:37.260]  improve her chances of getting a faculty position at the University of
[03:13:37.260 --> 03:13:41.280]  Pennsylvania and Harvard so this is an issue our president is very concerned
[03:13:41.280 --> 03:13:45.080]  about and recently you've cited the New York Times article the New York Times
[03:13:45.080 --> 03:13:49.440]  tries to portray it as a you know a white versus black issue but the truth is
[03:13:49.440 --> 03:13:53.520]  the people who are hurt the most by affirmative action ironically are Asian
[03:13:53.520 --> 03:13:59.240]  Americans and the lawsuit that Attorney General Sessions is looking into is is
[03:13:59.240 --> 03:14:03.760]  to end affirmative action at top universities by potentially cutting off
[03:14:03.760 --> 03:14:07.960]  their federal funding it's my belief that President Trump will end affirmative
[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:12.920]  action like Lincoln ended slavery and the way he's gonna do that is by
[03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:17.520]  appointing conservative anti-affirmative action Supreme Court judges and by using
[03:14:17.520 --> 03:14:21.640]  the Department of Justice to force the universities either end their racist
[03:14:21.640 --> 03:14:25.840]  affirmative action policies or give up their federal funding yeah you mentioned
[03:14:25.840 --> 03:14:29.680]  the Supreme Court Justice he nominated and got Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme
[03:14:29.680 --> 03:14:32.880]  Court I've got another story today I'm gonna cover this later Trump has also
[03:14:32.880 --> 03:14:38.120]  quietly appointed a hundred other new judges to lifetime positions but you
[03:14:38.120 --> 03:14:40.920]  know it's funny you brought up Elizabeth Warren and how she faked being a
[03:14:40.920 --> 03:14:44.760]  Native American to get into school what was the name of her book that she wrote
[03:14:44.760 --> 03:14:49.200]  do you remember that oh she didn't write a book she genuinely was trying to
[03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:52.520]  scam the system and then lied about it I'm sorry I'm sorry Vijay I was
[03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:56.880]  remembering that you wrote the book almost black with your experience so you
[03:14:56.880 --> 03:15:01.120]  know it's but it's more than that a lot of people do that you know Harvard
[03:15:01.120 --> 03:15:05.200]  recently like to brag about how they have 51% minority for the first time in
[03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:08.440]  their history but like they're having like a parade to celebrate but they
[03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:11.560]  don't realize you got a few you can't forget about what we call the Pocahontas
[03:15:11.560 --> 03:15:15.000]  factor or the point you think that that's actually something that's
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:19.360]  happening more often than we think oh my I'm not you know you would know Elizabeth
[03:15:19.360 --> 03:15:23.760]  Warren and me are not the only ones we're the ones who got caught you know
[03:15:23.760 --> 03:15:27.800]  revealed that fact well you wrote a book you know I'm still waiting for her to
[03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:32.400]  publish her book yeah no I mean she that's but that's why we that's why we're
[03:15:32.400 --> 03:15:35.720]  so fortunate to have such a great president with the courage to confront
[03:15:35.720 --> 03:15:40.520]  with this type of racism well it's amazing you come on I do I do want to
[03:15:40.520 --> 03:15:44.360]  mention you know I'm wearing my UCLA shirt right now I dropped out of medical
[03:15:44.360 --> 03:15:50.880]  school at at St. Louis University in Missouri subsequently got my MBA at UCLA's
[03:15:50.880 --> 03:15:55.280]  Anderson School of Management UCLA is a school that doesn't practice affirmative
[03:15:55.280 --> 03:15:58.880]  action in admissions I discovered that it's possible to have a great
[03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:04.400]  educational experience with a divert class of Asian Americans whites blacks
[03:16:04.400 --> 03:16:09.160]  and Hispanics without practicing racial discrimination in the world so in
[03:16:09.160 --> 03:16:13.000]  admissions so you know I kind of want to kind of convey the point to all of your
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:17.440]  listeners out there that affirmative action racism is not critical to a good
[03:16:17.440 --> 03:16:22.200]  education shocking now you come on and you're supportive of President Trump here
[03:16:22.200 --> 03:16:26.680]  today you've got a sister I think that might not be so supportive as there's
[03:16:26.680 --> 03:16:32.560]  some family family politics that go on there so you know I as I put up post on
[03:16:32.560 --> 03:16:35.840]  the cover of my book my sister said this this book will be shame on the family
[03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:41.280]  now recently you know she has a new baby on the way and you know I've come to
[03:16:41.280 --> 03:16:45.560]  the realization I'm gonna say no comment because you know I certainly don't you
[03:16:45.560 --> 03:16:49.800]  know I don't want any to say say or do anything that could be controlled as
[03:16:49.800 --> 03:16:53.440]  negatively towards my sister's child so I'll just leave it at that she
[03:16:53.440 --> 03:16:57.240]  disagrees with me on this issue she believes that she benefited from the
[03:16:57.240 --> 03:17:02.280]  affirmative action program at NBC I also remember when she got rejected from
[03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:07.160]  Harvard she cried so you know it's important for us to realize that
[03:17:07.160 --> 03:17:11.120]  affirmative action hurts people as well as you know it hurts people a lot
[03:17:11.120 --> 03:17:14.400]  when they're applying to college and graduate school including my sister and
[03:17:14.400 --> 03:17:18.680]  other members of my family as well you know it's amazing this affirmative
[03:17:18.680 --> 03:17:22.200]  action thing is something that most people probably don't think about they
[03:17:22.200 --> 03:17:25.480]  don't realize that it could be affecting their day-to-day lives it could be
[03:17:25.480 --> 03:17:29.880]  affecting the futures and it's something that most people don't talk about yeah
[03:17:29.880 --> 03:17:33.160]  you know I want to bring this up I want to give a good piece of advice as I
[03:17:33.160 --> 03:17:36.400]  mentioned I'm an admissions consultant for interview SOS calm here in Los
[03:17:36.400 --> 03:17:40.200]  Angeles and I want to give advice a piece of free advice as an admissions
[03:17:40.200 --> 03:17:46.320]  consultant to all of your listeners out there and that is do not disclose your
[03:17:46.320 --> 03:17:51.040]  race if you're Asian-American or white ever there's always there's almost
[03:17:51.040 --> 03:17:55.880]  always an option to not disclose your race don't disclose it because it can be
[03:17:55.880 --> 03:18:00.840]  shown to decrease your chances of finding a job or getting into college or
[03:18:00.840 --> 03:18:05.000]  graduate school so there's never any reason to disclose your race if you're
[03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:09.080]  an Asian-American or white just declined to say it now have you dealt with
[03:18:09.080 --> 03:18:12.960]  people that come to you for advice and you give them that advice how do they
[03:18:12.960 --> 03:18:18.040]  take it they just they follow it they just say you know what I'm just gonna
[03:18:18.040 --> 03:18:22.240]  not refuse to disclose my race all right well you know what's gonna happen now
[03:18:22.240 --> 03:18:27.360]  is they're gonna come after you and say how racist you are you know I'm trying
[03:18:27.360 --> 03:18:32.680]  to fight a system of legalized racism that we call affirmative action it's
[03:18:32.680 --> 03:18:37.320]  important to realize that affirmative action is a is a racial classification
[03:18:37.320 --> 03:18:41.080]  system that changes your chances of admission to college or graduate school
[03:18:41.080 --> 03:18:48.320]  it is the very definition of racism and we're very fortunate to have a
[03:18:48.320 --> 03:18:52.240]  president who is committed to appointing justices who will end this type of
[03:18:52.240 --> 03:18:59.960]  racism but more broadly you know Martin Luther King famously said that black
[03:18:59.960 --> 03:19:06.800]  supremacy is as bad as white supremacy and you know to discriminate against a
[03:19:06.800 --> 03:19:11.720]  white man or an Asian man is as bad as discriminating against a Hispanic or an
[03:19:11.720 --> 03:19:16.640]  African-American and I'm glad that we have a president who believes in that
[03:19:16.640 --> 03:19:22.160]  who believes that all forms of racism are wrong when President Trump says he's
[03:19:22.160 --> 03:19:26.080]  the least racist person that's because he believes it's as wrong to
[03:19:26.080 --> 03:19:29.720]  discriminate against a white person as it is to discriminate against the
[03:19:29.720 --> 03:19:34.240]  Hispanic or black and most people are over the entire racism thing anyway
[03:19:34.240 --> 03:19:38.680]  that's just a media perpetuated lie to get us to go into civil war thank you
[03:19:38.680 --> 03:19:42.960]  for much for joining us VJ almost black is the book he exposes affirmative
[03:19:42.960 --> 03:19:50.160]  action in schools folks it's been said any society is only three missed meals
[03:19:50.160 --> 03:19:55.000]  away from chaos those times may be near think about it our country faces
[03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:58.320]  multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea
[03:19:58.320 --> 03:20:02.360]  social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and
[03:20:02.360 --> 03:20:05.920]  city shutdowns and a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid
[03:20:05.920 --> 03:20:10.120]  vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack when the chaos
[03:20:10.120 --> 03:20:13.520]  from any one of these threats arises the government knows it can't provide
[03:20:13.520 --> 03:20:17.920]  during a widespread national emergency that's why you need your own plan for

[03:20:58.320 --> 03:21:02.480]  aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better
[03:21:02.480 --> 03:21:06.960]  nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[03:21:06.960 --> 03:21:11.280]  of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and so I

[03:26:10.520 --> 03:26:12.920]  because I want to hear what everybody thinks about Charlotte I don't know if
[03:26:12.920 --> 03:26:20.080]  we've really heard from from you the listeners out there yet so 1-800-259-9231
[03:26:20.080 --> 03:26:26.160]  1-800-259-9231 what do you think about everything that happened this weekend
[03:26:26.160 --> 03:26:32.160]  we know what the backdrop is but but where do you think it goes so what you
[03:26:32.160 --> 03:26:36.480]  have though is you have an actual civil war going on in the deep state there's
[03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:39.680]  a real civil war in the White House there's a real power struggle in
[03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:48.000]  Washington and it's all about the globalist new world order either coming
[03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:52.880]  to fruition or being stopped and so there's a huge civil war going on right
[03:26:52.880 --> 03:27:00.280]  now in Washington DC but what you have is a bunch of LARPers now you might not
[03:27:00.280 --> 03:27:05.960]  know what a LARP is LARPing is live action role-playing and I will give my
[03:27:05.960 --> 03:27:10.880]  my boss Rob do credit for this he's he's actually called this out first all of
[03:27:10.880 --> 03:27:17.080]  these protesters are LARPing they don't actually have anything in real life that
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:22.360]  gives them fulfillment they aren't part of a team they aren't part of a group
[03:27:22.360 --> 03:27:28.560]  they don't have anything so they latch on to these things like a Richard Spencer
[03:27:28.560 --> 03:27:33.480]  white supremacy march and they think that now that they're grabbing a torch in
[03:27:33.480 --> 03:27:37.600]  unity with these white people that they're told that they're being you
[03:27:37.600 --> 03:27:42.080]  know pushed out of society cast out now they're LARPing they're actually out
[03:27:42.080 --> 03:27:46.960]  they're thinking they're part of some white nationalist some Nazi movement
[03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:55.720]  no no that's not real it's totally fake it's all made up and Richard Spencer I
[03:27:55.720 --> 03:28:01.160]  mean folks I shouldn't have to come on here and denounce white supremacy I
[03:28:01.160 --> 03:28:04.080]  shouldn't have to come on here and announce the KKK I shouldn't have to
[03:28:04.080 --> 03:28:09.920]  come on here and denounce Nazis duh like duh humanity has already denounced
[03:28:09.920 --> 03:28:15.040]  these groups okay these are we already know this is the scummest of the scum
[03:28:15.040 --> 03:28:20.040]  but but they keep look they keep bringing it back up and trying to
[03:28:20.040 --> 03:28:23.840]  legit trying to make it legitimate again when really all of these people are
[03:28:23.840 --> 03:28:29.280]  LARPing there is no real KKK though there is no real Nazi party all you have
[03:28:29.280 --> 03:28:34.400]  is LARPers pretending that they're doing this so there's a real civil war going
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:39.120]  on everybody knows it and so the LARPers go out in the streets that have
[03:28:39.120 --> 03:28:41.680]  nothing else to do and actually think that this is how they're getting
[03:28:41.680 --> 03:28:47.800]  involved in the civil war so most of these people are just LARPers but
[03:28:47.800 --> 03:28:55.240]  speaking of white supremacy where is the marches against the Clintons white
[03:28:55.240 --> 03:29:00.760]  supremacy Hillary and Bill Clinton are above the law Chelsea Clinton gets money
[03:29:00.760 --> 03:29:04.040]  from the Clinton Foundation to pay for her weddings where's that white
[03:29:04.040 --> 03:29:12.760]  supremacy you realize that Antifa is made up of probably 90 percent white
[03:29:12.760 --> 03:29:20.560]  people they are also above the law so you want to look for white supremacy look
[03:29:20.560 --> 03:29:25.720]  no further than the Clintons and look no further than Antifa a domestic terrorist
[03:29:25.720 --> 03:29:30.040]  group that gets a riot in the streets of America burn American flags and not even
[03:29:30.040 --> 03:29:35.160]  get arrested there's your white supremacy the Clintons and Antifa so let's take

[03:30:51.640 --> 03:30:55.360]  needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing especially for our children the
[03:30:55.360 --> 03:31:00.720]  artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune
[03:31:00.720 --> 03:31:05.400]  systems the same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure
[03:31:05.400 --> 03:31:10.040]  groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze
[03:31:10.040 --> 03:31:14.160]  whether it's your home or office you owe it to yourself your co-workers your
[03:31:14.160 --> 03:31:18.720]  family your children to the best job you can to purify your air the elite are
[03:31:18.720 --> 03:31:22.480]  masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that
[03:31:22.480 --> 03:31:27.120]  mitigate or avoid most toxic effects themselves the general public doesn't
[03:31:27.120 --> 03:31:31.600]  the Alexa pure breeze will be a steal at three hundred four hundred five hundred
[03:31:31.600 --> 03:31:36.080]  dollars one of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean this is
[03:31:36.080 --> 03:31:39.280]  a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older
[03:31:39.280 --> 03:31:43.760]  more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is
[03:31:43.760 --> 03:31:51.960]  so revolutionary today in fullwarstore.com thousands of years ago there was a
[03:31:51.960 --> 03:31:57.160]  basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the
[03:31:57.160 --> 03:32:02.320]  warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years
[03:32:02.320 --> 03:32:07.520]  ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had
[03:32:07.520 --> 03:32:13.000]  drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent
[03:32:13.000 --> 03:32:17.960]  weapons for quiet war. Pathenogens added to the food and water to the lining of
[03:32:17.960 --> 03:32:22.800]  plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our
[03:32:22.800 --> 03:32:26.680]  journey towards death. I personally counter this onslaught with
[03:32:26.680 --> 03:32:33.240]  Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to
[03:32:33.240 --> 03:32:38.720]  create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human
[03:32:38.720 --> 03:32:42.960]  body discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today it's time for us to
[03:32:42.960 --> 03:32:47.120]  take our bodies back in our own hands and it starts at inforwarslife.com with
[03:32:47.120 --> 03:33:01.240]  Anthroplex you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with
[03:33:01.240 --> 03:33:11.320]  Owen Troyer. You know what happens when you ingest fluoride your entire life you
[03:33:11.320 --> 03:33:18.560]  become a professional larper on the streets of America it's honestly just
[03:33:18.560 --> 03:33:25.320]  it really does just explain everything folks these people have no lives they
[03:33:25.320 --> 03:33:31.360]  have no way to express their energies and their emotions they've probably never
[03:33:31.360 --> 03:33:37.360]  had a lover it's really just sad it's really just sad but you know it's
[03:33:37.360 --> 03:33:43.600]  amazing how these things work themselves out because to call it God call it
[03:33:43.600 --> 03:33:48.760]  Providence call it karma call it the universe whatever you want to call it it
[03:33:48.760 --> 03:33:53.680]  really is amazing however all these things work at themselves out first of
[03:33:53.680 --> 03:34:00.000]  all this weekend when all this is going on is George Soros's birthday so a nice
[03:34:00.000 --> 03:34:05.160]  little juicy birthday present for George Soros a white nationalist march with
[03:34:05.160 --> 03:34:13.280]  torches oh oh oh and by the way I'm just did anyone does anyone else notice folks
[03:34:13.280 --> 03:34:17.960]  if you don't think this entire weekend was a setup I'm just I'm just I'm just
[03:34:17.960 --> 03:34:25.120]  sorry who was Richard Spencer coordinating with because CNN had all of
[03:34:25.120 --> 03:34:28.680]  their all of the liberal media had their cameras ready to go for this thing did
[03:34:28.680 --> 03:34:32.280]  you notice that did you notice how they had the sky shots they had all the
[03:34:32.280 --> 03:34:36.960]  angles they knew where they were marching folks this was a coordinated event
[03:34:36.960 --> 03:34:41.000]  and you think it's just a coincidence the very next day is the unite the right
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:52.280]  rally and I'm sure and I'm sure that the is that video is that above footage
[03:34:52.280 --> 03:34:59.440]  video so this is actually amazing this is another thing I mean if I need like
[03:34:59.440 --> 03:35:04.880]  50 hours in a day just to try to dissect all this folks I have people
[03:35:04.880 --> 03:35:08.600]  sending me videos saying that they saw I'm not even gonna get into it I'm not
[03:35:08.600 --> 03:35:13.560]  even gonna get into it okay the whole thing was a setup it's clearly obvious
[03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:18.520]  and if you don't think for one second that the big news here that no one is
[03:35:18.520 --> 03:35:24.760]  talking about is the two dead police officers from the downed helicopter
[03:35:24.760 --> 03:35:30.280]  why is this not being talked about why is this not the biggest story how in the
[03:35:30.280 --> 03:35:37.200]  hell did a police helicopter crash I'm sure that's just a coincidence just like
[03:35:37.200 --> 03:35:41.520]  George Soros' birthday as a coincidence do you remember Aaron Black you may
[03:35:41.520 --> 03:35:47.240]  remember the name Aaron Black folks DNC operative admitted how it was him that
[03:35:47.240 --> 03:35:51.560]  shut down the the Trump rally in Chicago admitted it was him that started
[03:35:51.560 --> 03:35:58.360]  that violence Bob Kramer remember him remember Hillary's Donald duck you
[03:35:58.360 --> 03:36:02.200]  remember those project Veritas videos if you don't think that's the exact same
[03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:05.000]  thing that happened this week and in Charlottesville you're not paying
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:10.400]  attention Alex what do you say well I was just about to say I mean I'm in there
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:13.400]  watching you all we get stuff ready for the nightly news and things and other
[03:36:13.400 --> 03:36:19.080]  programs were done and I listen to you you're absolutely on target that we
[03:36:19.080 --> 03:36:22.760]  forget all the admitted stuff they've been caught doing we have to compile all
[03:36:22.760 --> 03:36:27.600]  the false flags all the fake stuff all the WikiLeaks the you know Jewish guy
[03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:32.240]  attacking the Jewish Center is how Trump was right and just all of that to just
[03:36:32.240 --> 03:36:35.840]  come show people the history of this this is what Soros has been setting up
[03:36:35.840 --> 03:36:39.320]  then it's on his birthday and then the helicopter goes down and all this
[03:36:39.320 --> 03:36:43.080]  weirdness this thing is his phonies and three dollar bill and then you have the
[03:36:43.080 --> 03:36:48.120]  exact same type of protest in Ukraine with the torches funded by Soros
[03:36:48.120 --> 03:36:53.160]  happened in America and Leanne McAdoo is actually going to be interviewing Lee
[03:36:53.160 --> 03:36:59.360]  Stranahan about this later yeah so it's the same Soros groups
[03:36:59.360 --> 03:37:06.480]  so wait Alex hold on a second it's not like it's not like Steve Scalise got
[03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:11.080]  shot by James Hodgkins in a radical left-wing terrorist it's not like what
[03:37:11.080 --> 03:37:14.120]  was the guy's name Clayton Carter I think in Pennsylvania that shot his
[03:37:14.120 --> 03:37:17.600]  neighbor who had anti-Trump signs in his yard the mainstream media didn't cover
[03:37:17.600 --> 03:37:22.520]  that at all didn't even mention that did you notice that shot and killed him in
[03:37:22.520 --> 03:37:27.040]  front of his wife two bullets to the head had anti-Trump signs in his yard
[03:37:27.040 --> 03:37:35.920]  kills his GOP neighbor and it's all the rights fault even though Aaron Black
[03:37:35.920 --> 03:37:40.360]  caught red-handed admitting he stages violence Steve Scalise shot by a
[03:37:40.360 --> 03:37:46.360]  Bernie Sanders voter it's just ridiculous and then listen listen we've
[03:37:46.360 --> 03:37:49.960]  done a hiatus on the Nautilus and I said how it is I'm like we're coming back
[03:37:49.960 --> 03:37:53.880]  news crew to do now not just gearing up for next week shows everybody's to
[03:37:53.880 --> 03:37:57.480]  compelate all the false flags you know them all put them into a video and say
[03:37:57.480 --> 03:38:01.040]  you know proof that they stage these events and shove that down their dirty
[03:38:01.040 --> 03:38:04.360]  throats that's why they want to stop YouTube and Facebook because we show
[03:38:04.360 --> 03:38:08.080]  what they are that's right that's why you need to share these links tell your
[03:38:08.080 --> 03:38:12.280]  friends and family point now the Soros is a Nazi and that same torch yep and then
[03:38:12.280 --> 03:38:19.000]  the guy leading it is a Democrat Obama supporter yeah Kessler yeah who's in
[03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:26.360]  with the the Occupy Wall Street it's just too obvious and I honestly my
[03:38:26.360 --> 03:38:30.240]  my thing with Kessler is I think he's more a useful idiot if anything my
[03:38:30.240 --> 03:38:34.120]  analysis would be right now I don't know if he is a true operative I think that
[03:38:34.120 --> 03:38:36.640]  there are clearly operatives at play here though I think that that's
[03:38:36.640 --> 03:38:41.600]  undoubtedly so yeah I mean well that's not like we have the WikiLeaks or the
[03:38:41.600 --> 03:38:46.120]  Project Veritas videos admitting any of this though and by the way here in
[03:38:46.120 --> 03:38:50.720]  racist America it's funny how quickly we forget that it wasn't even a year ago
[03:38:50.720 --> 03:38:55.440]  has a conscience so they beat us over the head with this race crap all day well
[03:38:55.440 --> 03:38:59.520]  you can't go to China if you're not rich and not Chinese you can't go to these
[03:38:59.520 --> 03:39:03.280]  Muslim countries if you're not a Muslim we're the open country and I'm sick of
[03:39:03.280 --> 03:39:08.280]  the damn lies of the parasitic filthy Soros so-called left they're a bunch of
[03:39:08.280 --> 03:39:12.600]  fascist real Nazis well it's not like we've ever had a black president oh oh
[03:39:12.600 --> 03:39:16.720]  yeah it's funny how we just cast Obama aside like Obama never happened
[03:39:16.720 --> 03:39:26.280]  America never had a black president tell us how you really feel Alex let's go
[03:39:26.280 --> 03:39:29.080]  to the phone calls we've got people want to call in about this let's start with
[03:39:29.080 --> 03:39:33.520]  Cassie in Arkansas calling in on Charlottesville go ahead Cassie
[03:39:33.520 --> 03:39:39.880]  hello I just want to let you know am I on yep okay I just want to let you know
[03:39:39.880 --> 03:39:43.160]  that I was born in Charlottesville and I just want to tell you right every time
[03:39:43.160 --> 03:39:47.760]  I go there I get nauseous because it's just not run properly and it's dangerous
[03:39:47.760 --> 03:39:51.400]  it's not that it's a rough area it's a very it's a very nice little town you
[03:39:51.400 --> 03:39:57.160]  have monotone stuff but you just have the authorities and the local leaders and
[03:39:57.160 --> 03:40:03.360]  the governor Virginia they they just do not care they allow like did you know
[03:40:03.360 --> 03:40:07.560]  that the governor called in the National Guard and had them stand down and the
[03:40:07.560 --> 03:40:16.360]  police so are you saying that it's political leadership or law enforcement
[03:40:16.360 --> 03:40:20.960]  leadership or a combination of the two it's a boat and just makes the city not
[03:40:20.960 --> 03:40:25.840]  safe it is not and I've lived in rough areas but and it's not that charged those
[03:40:25.840 --> 03:40:30.320]  rough areas just that the leadership makes it not safe well I got to tell you
[03:40:30.320 --> 03:40:35.000]  the same thing and you know it's tough not to get twisted in the middle of
[03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:40.280]  this thing in the middle of this cyclone and and not wind up on someone's side
[03:40:40.280 --> 03:40:43.960]  but I saw the same thing when I was covering Ferguson in St. Louis the police
[03:40:43.960 --> 03:40:49.480]  tactics used were miserable the police tactic used only escalated things and
[03:40:49.480 --> 03:40:52.360]  again the police are not my enemy I'm not trying to be upset with the police
[03:40:52.360 --> 03:40:57.720]  99% of those guys are just taking orders but there is definitely something to be
[03:40:57.720 --> 03:41:01.880]  said about the way these things are handled whether it be because they
[03:41:01.880 --> 03:41:05.080]  trying to be politically correct or whether it be that they really want to
[03:41:05.080 --> 03:41:08.960]  see some violence whatever the case is they're not handling these things right
[03:41:08.960 --> 03:41:13.480]  and it seems to be there's no learning curve it doesn't matter how many times
[03:41:13.480 --> 03:41:17.080]  we have to see this happen it doesn't matter if it's Charlotte it doesn't
[03:41:17.080 --> 03:41:20.440]  matter if it's Maryland it doesn't matter if it's Ferguson it doesn't matter if
[03:41:20.440 --> 03:41:25.480]  it's Charlottesville all these places we never learn the the tactics never
[03:41:25.480 --> 03:41:31.920]  change and somehow somehow Antifa just still gets to operate I don't know go
[03:41:31.920 --> 03:41:36.920]  ahead Cassie yesterday they broke off the area so they wouldn't replace it they
[03:41:36.920 --> 03:41:41.960]  wouldn't let Antifa get near the right wingers so you know why doesn't that
[03:41:41.960 --> 03:41:45.840]  happen in Charlottesville I even have it but this is what I'm saying if you look
[03:41:45.840 --> 03:41:50.720]  if you look at the images from Seattle you it was either Portland or Seattle
[03:41:50.720 --> 03:41:54.520]  probably both places happens all the time you have a line of police and then
[03:41:54.520 --> 03:41:58.840]  you have protesters what these people aren't pro they're LARPers they're
[03:41:58.840 --> 03:42:04.600]  LARPers you have LARPers that are out there spraying like confetti or silly
[03:42:04.600 --> 03:42:11.080]  string at police officers spitting at them throwing objects at them I mean
[03:42:11.080 --> 03:42:16.200]  again I'm not for police violence I don't want a police state you think I you
[03:42:16.200 --> 03:42:20.440]  think you don't think I grew up just like everyone else that hated police
[03:42:20.440 --> 03:42:23.520]  didn't stand didn't like me and harassed by police from this there the other
[03:42:23.520 --> 03:42:29.520]  thing we all have that same instinct but the police are not the enemy and I
[03:42:29.520 --> 03:42:33.560]  don't understand how the police aren't looked at as some of the most tolerant
[03:42:33.560 --> 03:42:37.640]  people in America when they're literally getting spat on having things thrown at
[03:42:37.640 --> 03:42:43.680]  them silly string sprayed in their face by LARPers how are they not deemed the
[03:42:43.680 --> 03:42:48.560]  most tolerant people they what what I would do if I was those police officers
[03:42:48.560 --> 03:42:52.240]  that I got sprayed with silly string I would take I would literally take my
[03:42:52.240 --> 03:42:56.680]  uniform off and put it down and say spray me now you little punk ass you know
[03:42:56.680 --> 03:43:02.880]  what thank you for the call Cassie let's go to Steven in Florida go ahead
[03:43:02.880 --> 03:43:10.120]  Steven yeah hey good afternoon hey I want to say first of all to all the
[03:43:10.120 --> 03:43:15.440]  wonderful media people out there like John Oliver and the others who have
[03:43:15.440 --> 03:43:20.800]  tried to defame Alex for all the products you guys carry I don't care
[03:43:20.800 --> 03:43:26.760]  what you people say I use them they work and I'm gonna continue to and I'm gonna
[03:43:26.760 --> 03:43:31.520]  continue to tell my friends about the products you enforce life because
[03:43:31.520 --> 03:43:37.040]  they're second to none so thank you Alex and Dr. Group and all the others out
[03:43:37.040 --> 03:43:41.560]  there who promote those you know speaking of that speaking of that as
[03:43:41.560 --> 03:43:47.600]  we're as we're as we're giving much much needed appreciation to the media out
[03:43:47.600 --> 03:43:52.640]  there like John Oliver and MSNBC and CNN and Van Jones as we're giving them
[03:43:52.640 --> 03:43:59.000]  that the appreciation that they deserve I find it so ironic I find it more
[03:43:59.000 --> 03:44:05.400]  ironic than anything else in the history of my life that you have the women's
[03:44:05.400 --> 03:44:11.120]  march and liberal media out here blaming the right for the death of Heather
[03:44:11.120 --> 03:44:17.360]  Hayer or Heather Hire the the woman who died because of the the car attacker the
[03:44:17.360 --> 03:44:25.080]  the the nut job and they don't even see how it's their fault they don't even get
[03:44:25.080 --> 03:44:30.160]  it they blame everyone else except themselves they're out here telling you
[03:44:30.160 --> 03:44:34.000]  Trump is racist they're out here telling you that Trump care is gonna kill your
[03:44:34.000 --> 03:44:38.720]  grandma they're out here telling you that Trump is a Russian they're out here
[03:44:38.720 --> 03:44:42.720]  telling you a bunch of racist bigots white supremacists elected Trump a bunch
[03:44:42.720 --> 03:44:48.160]  of Russian bots they're telling you all these lies about Hillary so literally
[03:44:48.160 --> 03:44:57.960]  lying all day long propaganda hundred percent and poor Heather buys it poor
[03:44:57.960 --> 03:45:05.000]  little Heather and her fluoridated mind falls for the fake news and she goes out
[03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:09.280]  on the streets and she actually thinks she's protesting racism she actually
[03:45:09.280 --> 03:45:12.680]  thinks she's protesting the Russian president she actually thinks she's
[03:45:12.680 --> 03:45:18.600]  protesting something substantial a struggle that's what they said they
[03:45:18.600 --> 03:45:24.480]  said we will continue the struggle that Heather died for the struggle that
[03:45:24.480 --> 03:45:29.720]  Heather died for was a struggle between fake news and reality and I feel sad
[03:45:29.720 --> 03:45:34.160]  that heller Heather fell for fake news and went out there and protested and
[03:45:34.160 --> 03:45:38.760]  ended up dead because of the very fake news that the fake media perpetuated so
[03:45:38.760 --> 03:45:42.680]  all the fake media out there including the women's march on Twitter pointing
[03:45:42.680 --> 03:45:46.440]  your finger at Trump supporters pointing your finger at right-wingers saying
[03:45:46.440 --> 03:45:50.160]  it's their fault that that Heather died you need to look in the mirror and ask
[03:45:50.160 --> 03:45:55.560]  yourself why was she out there to begin with why was he marching because you
[03:45:55.560 --> 03:46:04.280]  told her to based on lies did you have something else Stephen yeah you know I
[03:46:04.280 --> 03:46:09.000]  hate to say this and this is gonna sound insensitive but thinking about what
[03:46:09.000 --> 03:46:14.520]  you were just saying about Heather I really believe that this poor woman as
[03:46:14.520 --> 03:46:19.960]  she's become a victim of basically her own foolishness but she's the poster child
[03:46:19.960 --> 03:46:26.120]  for what I see coming in America you know the control you know the controllers
[03:46:26.120 --> 03:46:32.520]  they want to refer to people like her and Antifa BLM etc as useful idiots what
[03:46:32.520 --> 03:46:36.040]  these people don't realize is they're going to downgrade them when they're
[03:46:36.040 --> 03:46:41.500]  done with their usefulness to useless feeders and then turn them into soil
[03:46:41.500 --> 03:46:44.800]  agree that's the next level down the road that's the next level down the road but
[03:46:44.800 --> 03:46:48.080]  your your prior point to that is absolutely spot-on we've seen this
[03:46:48.080 --> 03:46:52.600]  coming Alex Jones has been saying this for years they're gonna set up the
[03:46:52.600 --> 03:46:56.400]  all they're gonna set up the quote unquote right wing they're gonna set up
[03:46:56.400 --> 03:47:00.040]  the conspiracy theorist they're gonna set up the Patriots they're gonna set up
[03:47:00.040 --> 03:47:03.520]  the whole thing and blame it on them even though it was their propaganda that
[03:47:03.520 --> 03:47:06.800]  started at the entire time we've been telling you that for years thank you for
[03:47:06.800 --> 03:47:11.480]  the call Stephen let's go to Pete who's also in Florida go ahead Pete thank you
[03:47:11.480 --> 03:47:17.080]  for taking my call I was gonna comment specifically on the police and their
[03:47:17.080 --> 03:47:24.960]  their conduct years ago I actually was a Nazi and in Chicago and I'm here to
[03:47:24.960 --> 03:47:30.520]  tell you when we had rallies in Market Park or Daily Center Plaza the Chicago
[03:47:30.520 --> 03:47:38.560]  police would have a line three officers deep in between us and the protesters
[03:47:38.560 --> 03:47:43.240]  and in fact protesters would have to heave stuff over the police line to get
[03:47:43.240 --> 03:47:50.200]  to us and if if anyone on either side did or said anything to the police that
[03:47:50.200 --> 03:47:53.400]  was inappropriate let me tell you something the Chicago police took
[03:47:53.400 --> 03:48:00.160]  action immediately immediately well we know about the new political correct
[03:48:00.160 --> 03:48:05.200]  nature of police but so you're saying that you you obviously weren't an
[03:48:05.200 --> 03:48:10.440]  actual Nazi you're saying you were a larping Nazi and you guys had marches
[03:48:10.440 --> 03:48:13.680]  or something and the police protected you from getting assaulted I'm sorry I'm
[03:48:13.680 --> 03:48:19.440]  not fully understanding this well take the rally at Daily Center Plaza we were
[03:48:19.440 --> 03:48:25.200]  out there in uniform and most of us in Nazi uniform yeah I had to carry shields
[03:48:25.200 --> 03:48:30.280]  and wear a helmet because stuff would come flying over the line at us no I'm
[03:48:30.280 --> 03:48:36.000]  not a Nazi anymore but let's be clear about that I was back then but not not
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:41.800]  anymore well you never were you were a larping just like they are now
[03:48:41.800 --> 03:48:44.580]  yeah I thank you for the call I understand your point I got other
[03:48:44.580 --> 03:48:48.880]  callers to get to but the point is that the police don't they don't take
[03:48:48.880 --> 03:48:52.760]  common-sense tactics like they used to folks that's that's that's the true
[03:48:52.760 --> 03:49:01.120]  point there let's now go to William in Massachusetts go ahead William hi
[03:49:01.120 --> 03:49:06.920]  I'll just call him because actually in Massachusetts we got another rally going
[03:49:06.920 --> 03:49:12.280]  on here freedom of speech rally I think Joe Biggs is gonna be there yeah
[03:49:12.280 --> 03:49:18.000]  apparently there's like a lot of people getting together see but you notice that
[03:49:18.000 --> 03:49:23.200]  a free speech rally that's inclusive a free speech rally that's inclusive that
[03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:27.600]  doesn't play identity politics a march on Google that's inclusive there's no
[03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:33.600]  identity politics there hmm well wonder what the difference is yeah I don't know
[03:49:33.600 --> 03:49:36.960]  it's that they're there they're already labeling it as like a white nationalist
[03:49:36.960 --> 03:49:40.640]  get together the mayor boss yeah and that's the point that Millie was making
[03:49:40.640 --> 03:49:45.120]  earlier you just really you try to have any political march like that that's how
[03:49:45.120 --> 03:49:48.800]  they're gonna that's how they're going to bastardize it unless you I mean even
[03:49:48.800 --> 03:49:53.600]  even a free speech rally they're bad they're gonna bastardize it I know I
[03:49:53.600 --> 03:49:57.000]  didn't miss shutting down I mean it's pretty much I feel like there's just a
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:50:03.280]  big operation here they're using the shutdown free speech all the other well
[03:50:03.280 --> 03:50:07.280]  that's their goal it's you know free speech is one of our our rights here so
[03:50:07.280 --> 03:50:11.040]  they got to take that away from us thank you for the call we'll take a couple
[03:50:11.040 --> 03:50:18.200]  more calls on their side but he brought up future protests so I will bring this
[03:50:18.200 --> 03:50:22.960]  up to you apparently there's already a new another rally being planned in

[03:54:13.760 --> 03:54:20.380]  they published that story okay I guess that makes sense and then you have
[03:54:20.380 --> 03:54:26.860]  media liberal media also telling you that if you are protesting Trump now
[03:54:26.860 --> 03:54:31.460]  that your life is in danger even though multiple people have been shot by

[03:55:49.380 --> 03:55:54.740]  Lydia Wheeler Trump quietly putting his stamp on the courts. President Trump has
[03:55:54.740 --> 03:55:57.820]  been quietly making lifetime appointments to fill more than a hundred
[03:55:57.820 --> 03:56:02.540]  vacancies on federal courts across the country. Five judges confirmed including
[03:56:02.540 --> 03:56:08.820]  Neil Gorsuch another 30 pending and 123 seats left for Trump to fill folks this
[03:56:08.820 --> 03:56:16.020]  is so key oh yeah you didn't think that Scalia just happened to die and then they
[03:56:16.020 --> 03:56:21.340]  drained his body of fluids and didn't do a proper examination on that to you
[03:56:21.340 --> 03:56:24.540]  don't think they were trying to swing the Supreme Court with the assumed
[03:56:24.540 --> 03:56:28.660]  victory of Hillary Clinton and the appointment no no no I'm sure that that
