[00:51.840 --> 00:55.440]  the bottom of the hour colonel six he's been a caller to the show and made a lot of predictions

[01:26.840 --> 01:33.680]  level as we told you it would we've been positioned for decades into total bankruptcy the Federal
[01:33.680 --> 01:39.040]  Reserve first used us as a base of operations to give them military and political muscle globally
[01:39.040 --> 01:44.520]  now they're killing the golden goose because they're done with us it's a scorched earth policy
[01:44.520 --> 01:52.840]  bringing us deeper into financial tyranny and then we have no me prince who of course herself

[02:04.520 --> 02:11.880]  latest developments in the economy and then of course dr. Steve Patshina is going to be coming
[02:11.880 --> 02:19.800]  on because I want to get his view on the Navy SEAL situation I don't know what his views are
[02:19.800 --> 02:24.040]  going to be just like I didn't know what his view would be when I called him up to get him on
[02:24.040 --> 02:28.440]  about the Norway shooting even though some of you disagree with his views and I think overall
[02:28.440 --> 02:34.080]  I don't concur with everything he's saying when I call up a guest to get the perspective I don't
[02:34.080 --> 02:38.040]  call up say what's your view and then if they don't agree with me well I'm just not going to have
[02:38.040 --> 02:43.840]  you on now I have them on to genuinely see what they have to say and so you can see what they
[02:43.840 --> 02:48.880]  have to say and so we can debate it and discuss it that's why sometimes you'll see divergent views
[02:48.880 --> 02:56.560]  and ideas here this is not a radio show where we just continually read from some same sheet of
[02:56.560 --> 03:03.200]  music kind of like a neocon radio or mainline liberal radio where it's just the same show day
[03:03.200 --> 03:11.680]  after day same ideas reading from the same sheet of music like it's some type of mantra or a yogi
[03:11.680 --> 03:18.800]  chant that's not happening here on this transmission we've got some other good news in all the bad
[03:18.800 --> 03:25.600]  news Al Gore talked to the Aspen Institute big globalist think tank and it was documented by
[03:25.600 --> 03:31.520]  press that was allowed in that he completely blew up and said that their whole fraud of global carbon
[03:31.520 --> 03:38.080]  taxes and the rest of it is basically destroyed and you've got the Rasmussen poll out last week
[03:38.080 --> 03:43.760]  where 69% of Americans believe scientists have been paid to basically lie well they've been caught
[03:44.320 --> 03:51.600]  lying under government funding so very excited exciting news there from Mark Moreno that climate
[03:51.600 --> 03:57.360]  depot that's up at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and I want to get Mark on later in the week if we
[03:57.360 --> 04:03.440]  can to go over some of that because it shows no matter how big these frauds are and they're
[04:03.440 --> 04:09.600]  going to keep going ahead with it but it's limping it's on fire it's bleeding out but a dead elephant
[04:09.600 --> 04:13.440]  being dropped on you can still take you out so they're not going to stop but we're definitely
[04:13.440 --> 04:18.400]  slowing them down and having victories we can do this on the war on terror fraud we can do this when
[04:18.400 --> 04:22.560]  they tried to push torture and get us to accept torture is good nobody really bought it so they
[04:22.560 --> 04:28.640]  had to stop that at least on the surface the Federal Reserve is incredibly unpopular over
[04:28.640 --> 04:36.240]  80% and most polls wanted abolished or at least audited we're winning the info war as Hillary

[10:19.440 --> 10:25.920]  mean lbj was the complete boss but obviously the cia being ordered by the president and
[10:25.920 --> 10:31.920]  they would use the guy that had run hit teams in scores of other third world and first world
[10:31.920 --> 10:40.720]  nations of course they would use their best field commander e howard hunt but uh they've
[10:40.720 --> 10:46.400]  now released the tapes early which was very smart to do explosive jackie o tapes reveal how she
[10:46.400 --> 10:54.160]  believed linden beans johnson killed jfk and had a fair with movie star and that's the report out of

[11:06.000 --> 11:12.160]  and its cover-ups others close to johnson also indicated the texan was complicit in the assassination
[11:12.160 --> 11:16.800]  yeah i've i've interviewed madeline duncan brown who was his admitted mistress for decades and who
[11:16.800 --> 11:22.640]  she had an illegitimate son by uh continues who died quickly of cancer by the way the former
[11:22.640 --> 11:28.240]  first lady the late uh jackie kennedy and also believed johnson and a cabal of texas tycoons
[11:28.240 --> 11:32.640]  were involved in the assassination of her husband according to report posted today in the daily mail
[11:33.280 --> 11:39.920]  secret tapes recorded by historian arthur slesinger the icon uh soon after the assassination
[11:39.920 --> 11:45.440]  revealed the widow's beliefs that the vice president had colluded with southern businessmen
[11:45.440 --> 11:52.240]  to kill kennedy in dallas on november 22nd 1963 lee harvey oswald was part of a larger conspiracy
[11:52.240 --> 11:57.360]  she said and that information is now coming out and we have the rest of the report uh at info
[11:57.360 --> 12:05.120]  wars dot com former first lady jackie fingers johnson and texas tycoons in jfk uh assassination
[12:05.120 --> 12:13.440]  and of course uh the kernel fletcher proudy who was the black ops liaison uh with the cia of
[12:13.440 --> 12:19.680]  course also wrote a book detailing that it was uh exactly those groups with the military industrial
[12:19.680 --> 12:27.600]  complex that did kill uh jfk who signed an executive order to pull us to begin pulling
[12:27.600 --> 12:32.800]  troops out of vietnam uh to begin abolishing the private federal reserve and issue lincoln green
[12:32.800 --> 12:37.520]  backs he did a bunch of other things and they said well we're just going to kill you he also
[12:37.520 --> 12:44.560]  went after the mafia he went after everybody um i'm not even saying that jfk was an angel or that
[12:44.560 --> 12:50.480]  bobby was an angel uh but the facts are certainly now uh beginning to come out on that front but
[12:51.120 --> 12:59.360]  turnall six webster tarpley nomi prins dr steve pechenick uh they're all coming up today here
[12:59.360 --> 13:06.320]  in the special broadcast okay it's one thing to know that if you lay on the railroad tracks
[13:06.320 --> 13:10.160]  and the five o'clock train comes by there's a good chance that the train isn't going to have
[13:10.160 --> 13:17.680]  time to stop and run over you it's another thing to actually see the country run over by the train
[13:18.800 --> 13:25.840]  and that has now happened and uh the country can still be rescued it can still be salvaged
[13:26.720 --> 13:34.480]  but it's going to take identifying the culprits of uh the pickle that we're in we are going
[13:34.480 --> 13:42.160]  into planned controlled receivership and demolition now our economic experts said this in 99 on the
[13:42.160 --> 13:46.640]  show when they got rid of the glass deagle act when the trillions thousands of trillions now
[13:46.640 --> 13:51.600]  and derivatives were sold the world when your pension funds and your government investments and
[13:51.600 --> 13:56.720]  your private investments were all tied to it through duplicitous fraud by the six big megabanks
[13:57.840 --> 14:02.400]  and just as you've seen in greece this is you've seen in ireland just as you've seen in many other
[14:02.400 --> 14:09.040]  countries the very same players very same families very same banks have positioned this i mean you
[14:09.040 --> 14:12.880]  don't sell this fraud and then not have the politicians in your pocket or you go to jail
[14:14.320 --> 14:18.800]  but by getting their people in the last few decades and all the regulatory positions in european
[14:18.800 --> 14:22.240]  and uh the u.s and canada australian new zeal and it's all the same
[14:23.280 --> 14:29.120]  by getting their politicians into power and and their former employees in as finance ministers
[14:29.120 --> 14:36.000]  of every major government england ireland scotland germany france
[14:38.080 --> 14:48.320]  greece it's all jp morgan goldman sacks bank of america um city group wells fargo and a few others
[14:50.640 --> 14:53.120]  and of course all of those banks heavily Rothschild owned
[14:54.320 --> 14:58.640]  nm rothschild heavily involved as well but overall there's less than 10 major players and
[14:58.640 --> 15:04.320]  they're all interconnected and there's six big horsemen uh that are up front and and then a few
[15:05.200 --> 15:13.600]  spinoffs this is economic warfare we are being conquered they sold you that we're going into
[15:13.600 --> 15:18.960]  this implosion because of 14 and a half trillion dollars of debt well depending on whose numbers
[15:18.960 --> 15:24.480]  you look at whether it's bloomberg's 27 trillion we haven't got new numbers in a year uh or the
[15:24.480 --> 15:29.680]  latest congressional reports where they finally admitted okay 16 trillion uh to foreign and private
[15:29.680 --> 15:38.000]  banks 16 trillion 27 trillion whatever the point is there's your entire national deficit right there
[15:39.040 --> 15:42.800]  now they're telling us raise taxes cut benefits
[15:45.520 --> 15:52.000]  and that will fix the global too big to fail crisis which is 1.5 quadrillion
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.120]  and i know i beat this horse every day because it's the same problem it was yesterday and last
[15:59.120 --> 16:04.880]  month and a year ago it is mathematically impossible to pay it back a b we don't owe it
[16:05.600 --> 16:11.760]  and c the very fraudsters that have positioned us uh into this situation
[16:13.920 --> 16:16.080]  the very fraudsters that have positioned us
[16:16.080 --> 16:28.800]  are now posing as our saviors and it's either us or them so we we're we're reaching the the critical
[16:28.800 --> 16:33.360]  juncture they had to have the quote debt deal which had nothing to do with raising the debt limit a
[16:33.360 --> 16:40.640]  routine operation to smoke screen that the deal itself was the big issue and that's in the news
[16:40.640 --> 16:43.920]  today that i'm going to get to the reports where the bankers are bragging that they
[16:43.920 --> 16:47.680]  hid this thing in plain view and then it's a total takeover and they're setting up a new
[16:47.680 --> 16:54.000]  marshal plan domestic receivership bank deposes the saviors through the rural councils and the
[16:54.000 --> 16:59.920]  rest of it to take over the towns the cities the counties the states that are now having
[16:59.920 --> 17:06.000]  their debt downgraded as well exactly as we told you now remember in 2002 it's not hard to tell you
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.520]  this it's not a crystal ball the imf world bank documents 2000 plus pages got leaked right at the
[17:11.520 --> 17:18.080]  time joseph sticklets left magically he says he didn't leak them and then giggles uh the Nobel prize
[17:18.080 --> 17:24.080]  winner for economics right when that is those documents got released the bbc greg palestine
[17:24.080 --> 17:29.040]  others reported they're they are imploding the third world by design economic hitmen they're
[17:29.040 --> 17:35.600]  going to do it in the west next and so for 11 years i have known the plan i have warned you
[17:36.160 --> 17:41.440]  i've done everything i could some enough for these monopoly men to create unlimited trillions
[17:41.440 --> 17:46.960]  that for themselves they get to buy up they infect all the other instruments financial
[17:46.960 --> 17:53.040]  instruments so they can destroy the economy then they're flush with the fiat instruments and can
[17:53.040 --> 17:59.760]  buy it all up this is war against the middle class i saw bumper sticker this morning that said
[18:00.720 --> 18:03.920]  i'm i'm glad at least the war on the middle class is going well
[18:03.920 --> 18:14.320]  well or at least the war on the middle class is going well now here is the financial news you
[18:14.320 --> 18:21.680]  know gold's over 1700 even though we're in a depression in the real economy with inflation
[18:21.680 --> 18:27.520]  laid on top of it it's so bad the inflation so bad that even though the system is trying to use
[18:27.520 --> 18:34.720]  a depression in the real economy to hide the massive inflation in the fiat economy in the
[18:34.720 --> 18:43.840]  parasite economy gas is exploding food is exploding silver gold every commodity is
[18:43.840 --> 18:49.200]  going up up up up up up up up up up up but because the white house tells you there's no inflation
[18:49.200 --> 18:55.520]  everything's fine the washington times democrats seek to pin credit downgrade on tea party and
[18:55.520 --> 19:03.520]  they go over what i covered yesterday the talking point in the ap the nbc's meet the press all of
[19:03.520 --> 19:08.240]  them it was everywhere as we told you they would do they're saying now it's not the federal reserve
[19:08.240 --> 19:13.600]  it's not oldman sacks it's not the thousand plus trillion in garbage they created it's not the
[19:13.600 --> 19:18.960]  welfare state it's not the the military industrial complex with trillions a year it's none of that
[19:19.840 --> 19:25.120]  it's the tea party and the tea party is led by a bunch of establishment republicans
[19:25.120 --> 19:29.840]  but they began under the ron paul movement and do want to get rid of the federal reserve our pro
[19:29.840 --> 19:35.680]  second amendment and do want to cut the new world order down to size so you are going to be scapegoated
[19:35.680 --> 19:40.000]  for the financial system and the terror attacks they're going to stage you can see all the scripting
[19:40.000 --> 19:45.840]  there when we come back dollar to be discarded by world china raised rating agency said china

[34:44.800 --> 34:52.720]  end up happening and i told you last week when mitch mcconnell mr. super congress the globalist
[34:52.720 --> 35:00.480]  republican came out and said hey this is a victory for the tea party that's like hanging an albatross
[35:00.480 --> 35:07.520]  around your neck that's like giving you credit for what jeffrey dommer did and so that was the
[35:07.520 --> 35:12.400]  frame up and now they were all over the sunday news shows everywhere i got scores of emails saying
[35:12.400 --> 35:18.080]  hope you're glad alex we've lost our credit rating we lost our credit rating in reality a decade ago
[35:18.880 --> 35:25.520]  this country has had a private banking cartel running into the ground since 1913 and they
[35:25.520 --> 35:30.720]  positioned us now to fully bankrupt the states the counties the cities the federal government
[35:30.720 --> 35:36.560]  so we can go under receivership that's why there's always unlimited you know millions of dollars for
[35:36.560 --> 35:42.880]  studies with shrimp on treadmills and bridges to nowhere it's all about bankrupting this country
[35:42.880 --> 35:48.080]  while giving themselves the contracts so they transfer the money to themselves on the front end
[35:48.080 --> 35:54.000]  with the contracts and the insider sweetheart deals and then when you go belly up they loan you
[35:54.000 --> 36:00.720]  your bailout money back to you at a higher interest rate and of course they're now i told you weeks
[36:00.720 --> 36:05.520]  ago i said we're going to lose the credit downgrade in the next few months then we'll start going from
[36:05.520 --> 36:14.560]  triple a to double a plus to double a right down to c they're gutting this country and they're just
[36:14.560 --> 36:19.840]  testing blaming it on the american people getting you to buy into the guilt and and blaming their
[36:19.840 --> 36:27.440]  enemy libertarian conservative constitutionalist that's the only group that halfway knows what's
[36:27.440 --> 36:32.560]  going on who doesn't like the fellow reserve who wants a second amendment who wants national sovereignty
[36:32.560 --> 36:38.080]  the system loves the well-meaning bleeding heart democrats that believe that polar bears
[36:38.080 --> 36:44.320]  can't swim and algore loves them they absolutely love people that want to live on government
[36:44.320 --> 36:49.840]  assistance and and and are basically hopeless because then they can give them the forced
[36:49.840 --> 36:55.920]  inoculations take their kids away from them they do not like people that want to be left alone and
[36:55.920 --> 37:03.120]  who are self-sufficient you know the country music song hank williams jr country boy can survive you

[40:14.400 --> 40:19.040]  detail all this but call your friends and family they're not going to hear this on any other radio
[40:19.040 --> 40:23.440]  show nationally that i know of i wish it was everywhere you're not going to hear the full
[40:23.440 --> 40:29.840]  scoop on what's going on anywhere they're rearranging deck chairs on the lucetania on the titanic
[40:29.840 --> 40:40.560]  okay now shifting gears into the entire situation with the navy seals going down over the weekend
[40:41.920 --> 40:48.640]  30 plus dead on board 20 plus seal team six it was and we have this posted it was reported by
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.840]  pakistani news multiple witnesses they got on the helicopter it lifted off and blew up didn't hit the
[40:53.840 --> 41:01.440]  wall okay so they're going to need and that's what our military sources told us as well not just
[41:01.440 --> 41:07.200]  callers like colonel six who's given us very good intel before so they need to cover up their death
[41:07.200 --> 41:12.640]  i said could they have just tagged the names on to a national guard helicopter and said they died
[41:12.640 --> 41:17.840]  there and colonel six said no he's talked to some of the family people and colonel six called us he
[41:17.840 --> 41:23.440]  corrected me he's right i looked it up four months before macrystal stood down when there was no news
[41:23.440 --> 41:28.720]  about it he said he's going to be brought down in a scandal you watch colonel six has now told me who
[41:28.720 --> 41:35.680]  he is and i've gone and looked it up he's been involved um he's now quote out of the military
[41:35.680 --> 41:41.120]  but still works for them we'll just leave it at that and uh he's here to give us information
[41:41.120 --> 41:46.240]  on that front but also have some other sources saying the same thing now we had another helicopter
[41:46.240 --> 41:51.520]  go down today nato helicopter crash lands and first they said that it had been shot down
[41:51.520 --> 41:56.880]  uh we're going to be uh discussing that with colonel six as well but colonel six break down
[41:57.440 --> 42:04.480]  exactly what uh this particular woman who's related to one of the dead seals told you told you
[42:05.360 --> 42:11.600]  the scuttlebud is and what the seals are saying and why they would want to get rid of them that uh
[42:12.480 --> 42:18.880]  in the beginning the ones that were killed in pakistan all of the seals that were aboard that
[42:18.880 --> 42:26.960]  helicopter one helicopter out of three were killed that was roughly a little more than half of
[42:27.840 --> 42:36.560]  that particular group now seal team six is back up a little bit it's made up of four squadrons
[42:36.560 --> 42:49.600]  okay and each uh squadron as uh each team has a three 40 man troop and you take five man operational
[42:50.560 --> 42:58.480]  troop uh guys to do a deal so you got twenty two on this one you got four four uh
[42:58.480 --> 43:07.040]  uh operational man um groups there what the deal is is that there has been some talk among the
[43:07.040 --> 43:16.160]  wives uh and other relatives saying we are going to go to the press and tell that we know
[43:17.280 --> 43:25.120]  how this was done and that it was not done the way they said that there was no bin Laden being
[43:25.120 --> 43:34.800]  taken there was no um him being taken to see him being buried and that their loved ones died
[43:35.600 --> 43:44.160]  uh in a accident or actually not an accident but in a way other than what's been reported
[43:44.720 --> 43:54.640]  what pushed it over the edge was that the other half of that particular squadron mixed in with
[43:54.640 --> 44:01.280]  a few other guys from another squadron to make it look good the rest of them were killed in
[44:01.280 --> 44:07.520]  this crash that happened the other day and there's something I want to point out about this first of
[44:07.520 --> 44:13.600]  all they're not going to be in a National Guard helicopter those helicopters they use are navy
[44:13.600 --> 44:19.120]  helicopters or army helicopters depending on which which they have available by that time
[44:19.120 --> 44:26.560]  they are secured at all times you know Batman is not going to take off after the joker without
[44:26.560 --> 44:32.080]  his batmobile you know he's not going to roll out and say you know hey six of them usually are 74
[44:32.080 --> 44:41.440]  boats wagging to go chase the joker no so they have the specially made uh helicopters you remember
[44:42.160 --> 44:48.000]  the reason that the pakistanians and the chinese ones that get a good look at that tail section
[44:48.000 --> 44:55.120]  that was let them back to stand because it was unusual so their helicopters are modified for
[44:55.680 --> 45:03.120]  their missions and um that for none of that picks together uh well here's what i'm getting from
[45:03.120 --> 45:09.360]  bogrom airbase when special ops has an operation no one knows so would never get reported and it
[45:09.360 --> 45:14.320]  did within minutes and that's what the other trips are saying if anything went wrong or happened
[45:14.320 --> 45:18.720]  or if these guys got killed the news would never know and they go on to say sometimes it takes
[45:18.720 --> 45:23.520]  years for people to be told that seals were killed and that's been confirmed they go on to say this
[45:23.520 --> 45:28.640]  is from our sources uh and guys don't don't show a shot of the shed i'm not sure if i want to publish
[45:28.640 --> 45:35.520]  this yet uh quote it hit the news just before as bodies were being cleaned up and identified
[45:35.520 --> 45:41.680]  which again they don't do the base goes on blackout to give time to notify families uh and they just
[45:41.680 --> 45:48.960]  go on to say that the whole obl thing uh it was reportedly that they took his body out by ospreys
[45:48.960 --> 45:53.840]  which are marine helicopters they don't have those in afghanistan it's unlikely they have flown those
[45:53.840 --> 45:59.840]  all the way from wherever uh just for a body and it goes on shinooks rarely travel full of people
[45:59.840 --> 46:06.640]  they have to hold equipment and packs and gear so uh why was it full the shinook special ops uses
[46:06.640 --> 46:12.080]  gatling guns on the sides of the shinooks don't so no one should have been able to get close enough
[46:12.080 --> 46:19.120]  to rpg it uh and it goes on to say it is possible to hold 36 souls not 38 is that true you can only
[46:19.120 --> 46:24.160]  hold 36 and they're saying 38 we're on that helicopter when you're running over 30 you're
[46:24.160 --> 46:31.120]  running uh in dangerous territory because that's true you're gonna have a door gunner on most of
[46:31.120 --> 46:37.440]  those missions and plus let me just back up when uh when the first when the first mission that went
[46:37.440 --> 46:43.680]  down and and uh in pakistan so when they suppose it got been a lot there never should have been
[46:43.680 --> 46:51.520]  a mention of who captured it secondly that should have been a mention of where obama was going to
[46:51.520 --> 46:57.440]  go to meet them that's that you know sign put a sign here this is where you can find
[46:57.440 --> 47:03.120]  special uh special forces troops now you've got the i think it was 101st airborne out of there
[47:03.120 --> 47:08.480]  and uh some special forces guys from syringes groups and so forth because they obviously are not out
[47:08.480 --> 47:16.000]  of the uh army base they're got four groups they got nine active duty seal teams they got four
[47:16.000 --> 47:23.440]  in the cordoba california four i think in north folk and they got one that's made up of um guys
[47:23.440 --> 47:30.480]  that are former seals that want to stay active in the subway so with so be a active duty in one
[47:30.480 --> 47:38.480]  reserve on east coast that should have never been debauched and just like uh the cia the only reason
[47:38.480 --> 47:44.960]  that we know that johnny mike span was the one one of the cia agents that was killed uh when the
[47:44.960 --> 47:50.720]  first man the point is like dr pacinic says he's run major operations worldwide including killing
[47:50.720 --> 47:57.280]  leaders and major european countries the minute they come out and tell you a story immediately
[47:57.280 --> 48:01.600]  you know it's staged because real operations you'll never hear about it that's it you know i
[48:01.600 --> 48:07.600]  was telling yesterday they say jump i say run okay they say add i think it's okay because
[48:08.480 --> 48:16.720]  one you land you land wrong for a lie when he said that he was i'm glad to meet the guys that uh
[48:16.720 --> 48:25.120]  uh that had done this okay then that told me that the rest of them were in trouble when i got this
[48:25.120 --> 48:31.200]  call the other night wait a minute i think you said yesterday was it on air off air that you said
[48:31.200 --> 48:36.080]  watch for more of them to start dying and i but but and now another helicopter they tried to shoot
[48:36.080 --> 48:40.400]  down today but we don't know who was on board well yeah i don't know i hadn't even seen that part
[48:40.400 --> 48:46.480]  and i heard now what i heard on radio was it was a hard landing yeah uh and i would think that this
[48:46.480 --> 48:52.960]  this would be following uh too closely unless there were dangerous but do you remain up into
[48:52.960 --> 48:56.800]  two other groups into two groups rather than another group but let me stop you're right there
[48:56.800 --> 49:02.400]  what what what are the sources with the seals telling you because last night you said that
[49:02.400 --> 49:07.280]  they were already getting ready to go public and that's what this uh killing was about right
[49:07.280 --> 49:14.160]  well this this killing this this this last kill yeah they were gonna go in public and say that
[49:15.040 --> 49:20.880]  there was no bin Laden picked up none of that other none of that stuff ever ever went down okay
[49:20.880 --> 49:26.880]  and they kind of held off on that when this other killing went down the other day that was
[49:26.880 --> 49:32.800]  distraught at both the cameras back then you had killed the entire team everybody's husband
[49:32.800 --> 49:38.560]  everybody's uncle everybody's nephew and damn it now's the time to come forward because if you don't
[49:38.560 --> 49:45.920]  they're gonna build again and uh we're grieving our hearts are broken they're giving us a check
[49:45.920 --> 49:51.920]  instead of our husbands and our sons and so forth it ain't gonna go we cannot let it happen to them
[49:51.920 --> 49:56.320]  so it won't happen to other ones well let me stop you right there for folks that are doubting this
[49:56.320 --> 50:01.680]  they murdered five of the members of Jessica Lynch's team because they they were coming out
[50:01.680 --> 50:07.280]  saying it was all a fable and made up for PR they murdered Pat Tillman over this stuff I mean people
[50:07.280 --> 50:13.040]  need to understand that this is done routinely if there's a big psi op rollout and troops aren't
[50:13.040 --> 50:18.640]  playing along this is standard procedure presentation I've been intelligence for the better part of
[50:18.640 --> 50:26.480]  25 years this is a rough and tumble game okay you uh if I if I if I'm out of a mission and I get

[50:52.960 --> 50:58.960]  it's too many operators own that to know okay well that's right they rarely do that from what I've

[55:25.840 --> 55:31.680]  the military uh have actually well i think i guess i'm already saying it for you well there's not this i
[55:31.680 --> 55:37.280]  mean it's just not you know put up on book boards and on on posters that you walk in the units
[55:37.280 --> 55:43.840]  but there are individuals that know uh about my blog and i have a radio show it's um before
[55:43.840 --> 55:50.000]  it's news dot com radio you go to before it's news dot com and the radio show is called agent in
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.160]  place you click on it you can listen to the past episode and by the way there there have been people
[55:56.160 --> 56:01.360]  behind the scenes trying to come after you now and trying to trying to i mean they are getting upset
[56:01.360 --> 56:04.640]  by what you're doing but you were telling me that some of the generals and folks are aware of what
[56:04.640 --> 56:08.720]  you're doing and that uh not everybody inside the military is happy about what's going on in fact
[56:08.720 --> 56:14.400]  you were telling me a lot of people are awake well yeah a lot of people are awake and i get a lot of
[56:14.400 --> 56:22.000]  love where to go you know just passing by somebody as long as the guy that i report to
[56:22.800 --> 56:27.680]  says you know you you haven't you haven't taken this over or you haven't gone too far or anything
[56:27.680 --> 56:32.400]  like that then i don't have any problems i don't care what other people think but but
[56:32.400 --> 56:39.600]  now i'm gonna tell you something nine percent of people uh are supportive of it they uh i have
[56:39.600 --> 56:46.400]  this thing called his stats on my uh on my blog you know and that that shows you where uh people
[56:46.400 --> 56:55.680]  are logging on from and camp with june uh paris island the uh air force academy let me expand on
[56:55.680 --> 57:02.240]  that what percentage of the military is starting to wake up to the new world order uh roughly 80
[57:02.240 --> 57:11.920]  percent because the deal you see this is the whole thing everybody knows and uh that for instance
[57:12.880 --> 57:22.000]  they will not tell you but it is a fact and you can check it out that roughly 75 percent now get this
[57:22.560 --> 57:30.880]  of the unit of each unit that's been to or has been to or is in epic and stand now roughly
[57:30.880 --> 57:37.280]  similar between 50 and 75 percent of the unit's members are hooked on opium they're hooked on
[57:37.280 --> 57:44.320]  opium alice so when they get back to east dallas and all they got is heroin they got opium
[57:44.320 --> 57:50.560]  you get it with a knife the milk just comes out you lick it off to the off the uh the off the knife
[57:50.560 --> 57:55.120]  and boom you're gone they're not gonna be able to get there when you get back here okay so they're
[57:55.120 --> 58:00.560]  gonna be breaking the promises doing all kinds of oxycontin and all type of stuff it's gonna be real
[58:00.560 --> 58:04.560]  problematic but let me make one other point that there's very sell you in this whole deal
[58:05.360 --> 58:16.320]  the story is being told now is that they left to go uh back up a ranger team but you do not
[58:16.320 --> 58:24.080]  see one such operating group to go with the other one okay if there is trouble then you need to send
[58:24.080 --> 58:33.600]  like uh 100 200 guys okay to go and help take care of situations uh it doesn't make sense and then
[58:33.600 --> 58:39.280]  what they said is that they uh the rangers stay there we're gonna be back in one minute okay
[58:44.560 --> 58:48.640]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[58:48.640 --> 58:57.840]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance
[58:57.840 --> 59:03.520]  to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[59:03.520 --> 59:09.680]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are
[59:09.680 --> 59:16.000]  calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[59:16.000 --> 59:21.760]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[59:21.760 --> 59:26.880]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner

[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:13.040]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:22.000]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:33.200]  all right i've got to get into the financial news and other world news colonel six is our guest
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:40.880]  and i don't know how much i can say but but he gave me a lot of um proof of who he is yesterday and
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.880]  and some of the things he's been involved in he probably doesn't want to even get into that
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.600]  on air uh but but but but finishing up you were bringing up the fact that normally there's not
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:54.800]  this many people together on one helicopter the fact that it's the biggest one-day loss in the
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:00.320]  nine-plus year war almost ten-year war coming up on that in october of this year so three or four
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:06.880]  months from now uh all of this uh you know really stinks to high heaven and then you have the pakistani
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:12.640]  tv with credible witnesses saying it lifted off it blew up we know that a helicopter did explode
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.760]  and you know and we know the whole bin laden rate is a ridiculous fable buried at sea fake
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:24.080]  situation room photos i mean that's all come out but that's really bold of this establishment
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:30.240]  if they really would wipe out the other half of the seal team uh but but you're saying you have
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:35.920]  talked directly to these family members and that they were already talking about going public and
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:40.960]  that that's why they had to be taken out that's right they were they were talking among themselves
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:48.000]  and it had been heard by someone outside of their group that they're outside of the team but maybe
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.320]  another team member who was concerned that this information was going to get that they were going
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:59.360]  to do something to uh blow the cover on it and that person may have said something to someone
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:06.240]  else i don't know exactly how it goes but they had decided that they were going to hold back
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.440]  and wait for a better time to do it and see you know see how if it was going to come out from
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:18.400]  somewhere else because dr robert hid on it so quick after it happened and then uh general
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:25.680]  goon came on and and came right behind him with the exact same thing another thing he had looked at
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:32.480]  afghanistan has been in in consultations or negotiations with the Taliban because on four
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:38.640]  occasions carzai has asked united states to leave they told him that they were beginning to get
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:44.240]  become like a occupying force he told him that uh when kids they killed up a bunch of kids a group
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:49.920]  of people that had like eight kids in it that he didn't want any more apologies he said you know
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:57.760]  at one point nato get out so each time that this is happening i think what happened is uh
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:03.360]  they came back at him kind of like the bobby and johnny johnny kennedy deal
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.960]  they killed his brother it was a big time dope dealer i mean you know so it wouldn't be a great
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.960]  loss to the world but it would be a great loss to president carzai and i saying like hey you know
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.120]  that your brother that could have been you so yeah people are waking up because people
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:26.000]  understand really what this is everybody in the marine course from me with uh smelly brother
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:33.200]  he's saying that war is a racket okay and that makes us and and it's those racketeers
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:38.720]  what you have to understand is like i said this is a rough and tumble game people there is no
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:46.080]  reset button all right and so you have to take everything as it comes okay you have them tell you
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:52.080]  when they come out and tell you a cover story like this and it has so many holes in it and you
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:57.760]  just have to wait for the for the other shoe to drop the other shoe has dropped now they're going
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:03.040]  to get in touch with uh the gentleman i told you i'm about to join the air and uh but mr harsh okay
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:09.680]  uh i gave him the number and i have for mr harsh i don't know if it's i haven't tried to call him
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.160]  myself but uh apparently they got through to him because she did i thought she had any problems
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:20.480]  give me a call back i'd help her try to uh pull up on that this is going to break pretty soon okay
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:28.640]  because uh like i said you've had these people have had uh and really don't even know the numbers
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:35.840]  because if you got uh the numbers don't die you know colonel six i'm going to get into the economy
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.960]  but do two more minutes was on the other side i want to come back because the new yorker just
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.440]  last week put out a puff piece about the bin laden thing i know cy hersh pulled a surprise winner
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.920]  i've talked to him before but he says he'll come on the show and never does i know he's exposed

[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.520]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.560]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:20.160]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:25.280]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:30.560]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.200]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from

[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:14.320]  well i have sources known to me sources that are unknown but have given us good information in the
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:21.360]  past at fort bragg fort hood i do not have any sources uh other than well i guess i do have a
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:27.520]  couple sources with the navy seals but they're all retired but these operations are all mixed
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:37.360]  in together and no one in the army uh no one in the marine corps uh no one is is buying the official
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:44.800]  story that the biggest one-day loss just so happened to be people from seal team six um
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:48.400]  which was part of the same group that read the bin laden compound i mean statistically
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:55.600]  statistically when the seals are such a small part of the overall force of what seventy plus
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.880]  thousand not even counting contractors in afghanistan that they would be the biggest one day loss is
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:06.640]  very hard to believe it statistically boggles the mind but that it would be from the same unit
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:13.840]  and then you've got the whole bin laden story that is just beggars the mind that is so ridiculous i
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:18.800]  mean the minute i saw that situation room photo on that sunday night the way they released it to
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.800]  dominate news coverage for the week and hillary with her hand over her mouth i mean you know when
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:28.160]  a photo staged it it looked like they got them all scripted the men all acting tough turned out that
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:34.000]  was fake they weren't watching there wasn't a firefight the helicopter blew up on and on and on
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.640]  the media called it flawless execution you know the helicopter blowing up that's real real flawless
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:48.000]  this whole thing is ridiculous and now uh kernel six who told us about mcrystal and libya before it
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.480]  happened uh oh that's a separate issue but i want to finish up with the seals uh and the families uh
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.600]  and there's and and they're saying they're going to reach out uh let me tell you they need to do a
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:04.720]  press conference right now in fact i'm even creeped out even even being somewhere close to this this
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.120]  is very creepy kind of like when i warned the dc madam a couple months before she got killed i
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:13.040]  said you better go public now and she said no and i said well say you're never going to commit
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:17.760]  suicide she said never and i even talked to her her condo manager she was good friends with she
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.000]  said men were following her she was worried she was getting documents to her mother and they killed
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.440]  her the hunger in her mother shed uh they don't play games and we got her handwriting i was sent
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:34.240]  her lease was not even the same handwriting uh and i had florida detectives and people calling me
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.120]  and that was creepy and weird but the whole point here is the detectives said there were no foul
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:45.840]  plague yeah i don't need to talk to you guys it's obvious what team you're on here uh so so all of
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.960]  this is happening i mean this is a dangerous situation colonel six are you familiar with
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.880]  jessica lynch and how five of the survivors were murdered in a two week period when they started
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.280]  speaking out saying she hid in fear none of this is true when they were using it as pr to get women
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:09.440]  to join the military yes i am yeah i'm i'm very familiar with that um and some other situations
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:15.280]  like i said it's almost a situation was one that came across my desk to uh do some looking into
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:22.560]  which is how i got in behind my crystal okay and so then we know what happened on that but let me
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:27.200]  just make one other point yeah these people this this woman didn't just up and call me either okay
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:34.080]  there's about six pence that she had to jump in order to find out uh to get me to call her back
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:40.720]  okay and i want to let me know who you are about my blast on so forth i found that out real quick
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:47.840]  and then i said you know how can i help you you know and i said that uh i would you know advise
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:53.360]  you that's what i think i would advise you to get you call a press conference immediately or get in
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:12:00.880]  touch with uh the curses on the first i could think of uh that we look at i should uh or uh build
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:06.240]  girth i should put it on girth i don't have his number anymore but somebody that's going to get
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:12.800]  this out there that has a lot of credibility and it's going to just say you know hey this is what
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:19.120]  happened i mean you know what happened is what happened you can you can dress up the doctor
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:27.120]  look like a zebra but it's going to be he's going to uh still break and for them to come out and do
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:34.800]  this type of thing is what is waking up the members of uh today's military they're jacking them they
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:40.880]  didn't jack them around on the way that their pensions are going to be uh paid out to them like
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:47.200]  you said they've taken the the insurance money that they were supposed to have had and given them
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:53.600]  checks that when they try to cash the checks they're they're bad checks and uh well it's a contract
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:59.760]  when they cash the check it voids all the money they were going to get so you know all these other
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:04.480]  things and then you got people to say well we back the troops okay well if you back the troops
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.280]  you know we i don't like to whoever i back the troops you can't do both friends it's like they
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:15.760]  were saying we're going to establish a no fly zone in order to establish a no fly zone you must start
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:21.920]  a war that's the only way to do it i mean you don't just throw a net over that's my next question what
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:27.520]  what's the word then is you you talk to her and others i mean how how many people are planning
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:32.160]  to go public do we have any idea and and and what are they going to say you know investigate what
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:37.360]  the the shoot down to this helicopter she uh i actually when i talked with her there was two
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:43.920]  other women there and they gave me the impression there was at least a dozen okay and what they're
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:49.760]  going to do is they're going to come out and they're going to say basically that some of them had
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:54.000]  relatives uh and mostly his husband's i'm just gonna think he's come out and say that
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:04.160]  husbands that were uh in six team six that uh were killed in uh the operation in pakistan
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:09.600]  and that other members that were in the other two helicopters they know that there was no
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:15.600]  been lots of those are the guys that went back and uh you just kind of kept it on her just for a
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.480]  minute but then you know two people can keep a secret who went on the dead so they start talking
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:27.040]  anyone about the other maybe the basketball game or in the gym or something like this anyway well
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.240]  that's my next point is that it was the family that came out on tillman and then it did turn out
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:37.680]  he wasn't fighting al-qaeda he was murdered the the army zone corner wouldn't lie said that he'd
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.240]  been murdered and then now it all came out that he'd sent letters home was going to go public so
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:47.360]  they they killed him and it's the same thing with jessica lynch they were going to use her for pr
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.480]  they told her to lie she said okay i'll do it and then finally she came out and said okay it's all a
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:57.200]  lie or they were going to kill her and then say oh the poor hero died in a car wreck but they'd
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:02.160]  already killed the other folks that were speaking out why are they so bold i mean if the pentagon
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:08.080]  and the people that run this keep getting caught killing people who get in the way of their public
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.960]  relations propaganda then i mean i mean if they really did kill these seals which it looks like
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:19.040]  they did these people are crazy because if they can't cover up the murder of pat tillman
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.240]  or jessica lynch's unit they're not going to be able to cover this up no but it's just like
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:32.000]  jimmy henderson acts as a mother's love you know when you you get to a certain point where you don't
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:41.280]  care if it's covered up or not i tell you what what you're gonna need to do is prove it okay now
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:48.160]  how are you gonna prove it and i mean take it into a court and and have the elements of uh
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:53.920]  evidence and so forth to actually prove uh wrong for death or wherever you want to go for it
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:59.200]  it's gonna be damn near impossible so so so even if they're gonna get caught they don't care
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.200]  because the only thing they couldn't deal with is the credibility of the navy seals themselves
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.680]  going public now their wives want to run around and say they were killed that'll just be ignored
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:11.280]  kind of like even the pat tillman thing they couldn't have him standing here saying we're
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:17.120]  growing opium uh even if it came out they killed him at least pat tillman who has all this credibility
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:22.480]  can't do it colonel six great points colonel six dot com with two x's we'll continue to check in with

[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:49.520]  22 and a half percent nationwide and their analysis 33 percent in california and that was
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:58.000]  in november of last year that's 60 minutes 60 minutes cbs has to admit 30 plus percent

[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:20.000]  of everything one of my crew was out shopping for houses out in the country and a couple of the houses
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.600]  they went and looked at had recently in separate neighborhoods in the country had their the guts
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:32.160]  stolen out of them okay i'm i'm ranting the point is ladies and gentlemen keep your guns locked and
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:36.400]  loaded and watch your kids and lock your cars when you're driving around there's all sorts of
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.720]  robberies intensifying and the news is not going to tell you and they're cutting back on police
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:49.440]  ted it is so incredible to see gold it's 1700 and 12 dollars it went as high as you said it's 1720
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:26:01.520]  i mean that it's up 49 dollars today was up was up 57 dollars i mean this is unbelievable but of
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:06.560]  course they've signaled what do you make of allen greenspan and i have the quote here the video is
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:12.560]  up on info wars dot com ted i'll read the exact quote here i'm trying to find it where he said
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:18.160]  we're not worried we'll never default because we'll just print money that is a default the bankers get
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:23.280]  first use of before it's devalued but then they pass it on to us that is that is a hyper inflationary
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:28.720]  statement if i ever saw one it sure is and especially coming from allen greenspan i don't
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.520]  know if you've read his stuff from way back when he was in college i mean he knows he must be thinking
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:40.240]  we're idiots if he thinks he hung out he hung out with iron rand and ron paul people he wrote books
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:45.200]  about the new world order and they came and hired him like anakin skywalker becoming darth vader
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:51.840]  here c nbc the united states can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.720]  so there is zero possibility of default said greenspan on mbc's meet the press but that's what
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:01.920]  the chinese and ron paul and everybody have said that that is another default you just pay them a
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:07.200]  monopoly money ted so the whole world's freaking out it is it's it's worse than a default it's
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:12.480]  going to kill anybody out destroy anybody that saved their money people that are retired and
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:18.080]  living off of the retirements are going to go broke and that's because they've invested all the global
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:22.880]  financial instruments with derivatives if we don't pull the derivatives out we have no hope do we ted
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.440]  no you're right alex it's just it's it's a house of cards no matter where you turn
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.600]  that's why you know if we raise the debt limit it's going to be a problem we don't raise the
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:36.640]  debt limit it's going to be a problem alan greenspan at least is being honest hey look we're not
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:40.960]  going to default we're going to print as much money as it takes in order to solve this problem
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:46.240]  at least they're being honest all right might as well might as well button the hatches absolutely
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:51.200]  now here's the goodness ted when they artificially plunged gold and silver three months ago bought a
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:56.640]  horde of it a dragon's horde he sold out of that but as it's been going back up he's buying buying

[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.040]  You ain't seen nothing yet
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.040]  No
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.040]  You ain't seen nothing yet
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:15.080]  They're not gonna stop we're gonna look like Argentina
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:21.240]  70 years ago, it was still the wealthiest country in the Western Hemisphere per capita
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:27.120]  Wealthier than the United States as rich as an Argentine was the saying
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:31.680]  Many Americans set sail as young men to go down there and make their fortune. Well
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:39.960]  They are an absolute third-world hellhole now completely robbed. Ted Anderson was down there on his honeymoon. Oh
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:45.160]  I don't know it was a year or two years ago, and he said he saw good-looking families
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:49.240]  I mean good-looking families living in doorways everywhere
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:56.800]  No, but not not drunken lazy people. These are folks living in doorways and then and then working at
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:01.160]  $1 a day taking an incredibly rich intelligent population
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.320]  Destroying them
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:11.000]  Destroying them. This is what the oligarchs do. We're gonna be talking to Webster Tarpley who predicted all of this with absolute precision
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:14.080]  The austerity you've got to watch the Obama deception
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:17.440]  You've got to get that film from two and a half years ago and get it out to everybody

[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.200]  We're shattering the controlled left-right paradigm right now
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:36:00.120]  We're gonna do a special report tonight 7 p.m. At prison planet dot TV in the live show area

[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:54.120]  stations now
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:58.680]  Going to doctor of history is also an economist Webster griffin Tarpley
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:04.280]  If you have not watched Obama deception and fall the Republic two films. I made back-to-back we
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:11.840]  We predicted everything Obama would do that film was basically done when he got elected or when he's got sworn in it came in
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.240]  It came out like a month
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.200]  After he got sworn in
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:25.400]  It's it's more powerful than when we made it because of Webster Tarpley and other economists like George Humphrey
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:32.880]  Laying out exactly what was going to happen. This is like you're running the Titanic at full steam right towards a iceberg
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:39.440]  You know, it's not going to be good and the oligarchs have figured out this rationale of austerity is sexy
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:44.000]  Post-industrial world. They plan the whole thing out green span says don't worry
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.840]  We'll just print our way out of this. He told CNBC that that means hyperinflation on one end
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:52.480]  But if you don't print
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:39:00.480]  Uh, then the economy stalls. So what do you do? Well, you you continue to print money and you have zero credit
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:05.840]  Zero interest total credit to the population real businesses. You don't just hand
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:10.000]  Hundreds of trillions of dollars over to the globalists to do whatever they want
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:12.360]  And so that's what's happening
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:19.800]  Everything is going into the hands of the banking cartel that engineered this and just like Greece just like Ireland the more we bail them out
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:23.120]  The more money we give to the zombie banks the worst things get
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:27.640]  And again, the economy is in an absolute freefall route right now
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:31.160]  I'll be giving you those numbers as we talked to dr. Tarpley here
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:35.880]  China is saying it's the end of the dollar. The world is moving away from the dollar quickly
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:42.920]  They're talking about now that the downgrades beginning that the US is basically technically defaulting and
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:48.040]  They're reporting that hundreds of cities towns counties states
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:51.960]  Dozens of states are on the verge of going completely bankrupt
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:57.200]  But this is all fraudulent bankruptcy because 90 plus percent of the debt is
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:05.800]  Induced debt that we were signed on to by the Goldman Sachs JP Morgan mafia that put their politicians in
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:09.320]  In the House Senate and of course the Obama administration
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:12.600]  Bush passed the baton over to them
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:19.240]  And so no one is really debating the elephant in the room except for people like dr. Tarpley and we predicted it all
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:25.800]  100% said within two to three years. This would happen in Obama deception fall of the republic here
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:29.280]  We are two and a half three years later Webster Tarpley. Thank you for joining us
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:36.680]  I'm not doing too good. I live here. I love my family. I'm watching these criminals sit up there
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:42.320]  Geithner saying we you know, we would never lose our triple a rating knowing full well once they got the super congress in
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:46.360]  They were going to bring us deeper into receivership Tarpley. Welcome. Thank you
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:51.800]  Well, this is what we will be talked about. It's a depression. It is a breakdown crisis
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:58.440]  It's a disintegration of the entire system not just the collapse of prices, but institutions that cease to exist
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.720]  All over the place
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:06.640]  Right now. There's a there's a whiff of panic, right? It just crashed through four hundred minus four hundred on the Dow
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:11.200]  Let's go back to last week. We had this crisis around the debt ceiling
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:16.560]  I regarded this crisis as totally unnecessary reckless irresponsible
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:21.920]  We had a lot of wild talk from any logs about how the US could default. It wouldn't matter
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:29.120]  That is very foolish the the US Treasury securities are the bedrock of the economy of this entire planet
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:35.440]  It's not a good system. I don't like this system, but I wouldn't say junk the system and then go off the cliff
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:41.520]  I don't think that that's good policy. So what happened last week was this fear about the US default
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:46.040]  Drove a lot of people to dump government bonds around the world
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:51.920]  That would be especially Italian bonds because Italy had been under attack since about July 11th
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:57.680]  Spanish bonds and other bonds along with US bonds to some extent, but not that much
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:03.560]  The money then flowed into Switzerland Japan and Germany driving up their
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:10.840]  Currencies and making their exports harder to buy not good for these countries either. They're very very worried about it
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:15.240]  So we had a situation where Italy and Spain were big targets
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:19.520]  Now we've also got this European August vacation break
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:26.520]  The volumes in the in the bond markets of Italy Spain are quite low at this time of year a perfect occasion
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:33.760]  for the hedge fund hyenas and the zombie bankers to come in and attack using credit default swaps
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:39.240]  The Europeans had a chance last year to outlaw credit default swaps when Germany
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:43.560]  Sure below the finance minister talked about it. They decided not to do that
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:49.000]  They also talked about having a a Tobin tax a turnover tax on these finance oligarchs
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:55.520]  They didn't do that so they were sitting there pretty much exposed to the attack and that then got these Spanish and
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:43:00.040]  And Italian bonds going down that in turn raises the issue
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:06.760]  Well, maybe the euro will blow up and then of course the dollar might fall might also blow up in some combination
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:12.440]  What you then saw was a lot of European banks were going to the brink if you look at
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:16.960]  Comet Spank of Germany you look at Societies in the Hall of France
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:21.720]  Barclays of Britain and some others these banks are under a lot of pressure
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:25.960]  They're a lot of a lot of European institutions are dumping US stocks
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:30.000]  And they're also dumping futures contracts in the oil market
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.480]  The reason that oil is going down has a lot to do with with the fact that that price is mostly speculation
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:40.560]  And when the when the speculators get in trouble, they got to liquidate their positions to get into cash
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:45.560]  So that's sort of that the technical side of it now in the middle of this
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:47.920]  standard and pours
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:54.960]  The fact that this institution even exists today is a tribute to the impotence of the whole
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:44:02.000]  What can we say criminal justice system? They have been transferred by the big banks who basically set these groups up
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:06.480]  They've been transferred the power of Congress actually rating itself
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:11.120]  So it creates the false idea that that that oligarchical bankers
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:19.320]  Set the destiny and the credit and faith of your country. Are they not really the true dictators now of our country?
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:25.680]  S&P Moody's and others who are made up of a revolving door of the big six zombie bank
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:31.400]  Executives exactly I was thinking this morning when I heard that the standard and pours was making
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:37.160]  Ultimatums again to the United States standard reports this morning says we may downgrade you again
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:42.640]  So watch out and we demand immediate fiscal action. In other words, we demand genocidal budget cuts
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:50.200]  My god, they demand shock therapy never cut the trillions the bankers are stealing never prosecute themselves for the derivatives fraud
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:55.800]  Cut your social security and again, it's a fiat economy. It is a dependency economy
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:02.360]  But once you're into that, it's the only economy you have even as Ron Paul has said you'd have to phase out of this stuff over decades
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:08.880]  You cut all of these good all of these safety nets out. We will go into a total roadwarrior
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:10.440]  depression
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:12.880]  instantly with riots in the streets with
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:20.160]  45 to 50 million people on food stamps and what is S&P and others saying there's openly saying slash it all
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:26.320]  Which is known as the IMF riot in their own documents where they want the riots to begin to further cause
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:35.080]  The absolute destruction of any institution so the banks can then come in behind it and literally set up mercenary warlords and fully conquer us
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:40.240]  I would say my feeling this morning was the ratings agencies are acting like Hitler
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:46.600]  They're basically Hitler used to say this is my last territorial demand in Europe and that's NP says well
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.880]  This is my last demand for genocidal austerity for this month
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:54.640]  It's time to fight back the United States is under attack
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:57.080]  That's the only way to look at this. This is not political
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:03.760]  The gesture by S&P is completely political and these if the other ratings agencies now
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:08.480]  We've got two more damocles swords. We've got fish and we've got mooties. What are they going to do?
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:13.080]  I think it's time to investigate these entities. What are their conflicts of interest?
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:16.880]  How many of them are shorting US Treasury bonds?
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:20.920]  How many of them have relatives who are shorting insider trading?
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:27.840]  Treasury bonds exactly insider trading if those guys that you saw from S&P on all the television shows yesterday
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:32.760]  If that if they were talking about stocks if they were telling you to buy a stock
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:39.200]  Then they'd have to put up a chart that says does this analyst own the stock the relatives own the stock?
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:42.840]  Do they provide services? Are they shorting all the rest of this stuff?
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:47.560]  Somehow these people seem to be above the law S&P runs wild
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:53.080]  They the Treasury and I think they're right. Geithner says they made a two trillion dollar error
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:57.280]  If they make a two hundred two trillion dollar error, where's the accountability?
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:01.200]  What are they going to say too bad if you lost your life savings? We're sorry
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:07.680]  But that's just a dance they're doing Geithner's totally controlled by the very same crew as you know Webster expanding on that
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:12.880]  But he's telling you the truth that they have their analysis is worthless. I'm just think back to 2008
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:21.680]  Those same ratings agencies the three that we're talking about they were giving triple A ratings to every piece of
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:30.160]  Toxic derivative junk in Wall Street up until five seconds before what the ultimate bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers or what?
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:31.680]  Yeah, that was the sucker play now
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.040]  They're in the implosion angle and that leads me to my next question three weeks ago
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:41.880]  You talked because you read Italian to speak Italian that that they were that they were subpoenaing Moody's and
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.000]  SNP in Italy now
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.680]  We read last Friday that they did raid them and so you're saying that's the same thing here raid their hind ins now
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:56.960]  Yes, exactly get get the get the FBI going get the get the Department of Justice the secret service
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:59.800]  I think still works for the Treasury or could
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:07.560]  There's got to be an immediate investigation and the only way to do that is you've got to determine is there a criminal conspiracy going on
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:09.720]  involving
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:15.400]  various hedge fund operators who are in collusion with these with these agencies and by the way Webster
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:21.640]  This is a big deal for those that don't know. This is one of the biggest things we've seen in decades
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:25.520]  The fact that for the first time in modern history, we're being downgraded
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:29.520]  That means now that it's going to spread as a contagion to states
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:37.720]  Counties and cities and already has so the very same hedge fund hyenas can now loan these counties and states and cities back
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:41.920]  a citizen banker bailout money at exorbitant interest prices
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:42.920]  They're driving it
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:48.800]  This is basically a conspiracy to raise the interest rates in other words to gouge the American people more
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:51.680]  Right now here in the Washington area, right?
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:58.000]  Everybody in Virginia and Maryland is waiting because we were told already by the ratings agencies that if the US
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:03.120]  Treasury debt is downgraded since Virginia and Maryland depends so much on the federal budget
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:08.040]  Because of the the nature of the regional economy that the Maryland and and
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:11.240]  Virginia bonds will also be downgraded. I think they're both
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.320]  AAA but what are we talking about the current situation is a dictatorship
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:19.160]  It looks like this at the top of the dictatorship
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:26.600]  We have the the the triumvirate of SNP, Fitch and Moody's and they they hand down their decisions
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:30.320]  They say we demand four trillion of genocidal budget cuts
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:36.400]  We demand more budget cuts then those orders are going to go to the 12 tyrants
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:39.840]  That's the super committee or the super congress
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:45.640]  I call them the 12 tyrants a good term drawn from Greek and Egyptian history the 12 tyrants
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:51.840]  And we're getting some some word about who they might turn out to be the 12 tyrants are going to report around
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:55.040]  Thanksgiving and then between Thanksgiving and December
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:58.920]  Christmas basically the Congress is going to be forced to vote on this
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:04.760]  This is modeled on the BRAC the base realignment and closing committee although. It's a
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:10.400]  Qualitatively a different level of operations because this is not running the entire economy
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:14.840]  Yeah before it was just they were deciding what bases to close now
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:20.360]  This is all the spending and cutting bills not coming out of the house and individual members
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:26.200]  It's coming out of the committee of 12 with Obama as the 13th right and this will be a secret committee
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:31.440]  You know in Venice in Venice they had the Council of 10 right the Council of 10 was the hated and feared
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:34.560]  Secret intelligence agency of the Venetians
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:41.000]  This is now the Council of 12 and the idea is that they're going to come up with their list of genocidal budget cuts
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.920]  And it'll be taken to leave it look at what the BRAC did last week
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:47.200]  We had a tragic event here in Washington DC
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:54.360]  Walter Reed Army Hospital, which was the best facility in the world if you had
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:51:01.400]  Paraplegics coming in people who had lost arms legs limbs in the various wars
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:08.440]  It's a tragedy of course, but Walter Reed Army Hospital had developed the best the very best team in the world in terms of
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:15.120]  Getting those guys back on costasus recovery now that that entire hospital has been shut down
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:19.160]  It's destroyed they say they're moving it to Bethesda Naval Medical Center
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:25.080]  It just won't be the same and it also means that there's one fewer hospital in the district of Columbia
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:30.600]  Where the district has been losing hospitals continuously now what the 12 tyrants are going to do
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:36.960]  They will do the same thing to the US economy that the BRAC did to Walter Reed Army Hospital
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:40.040]  And it is an imagine what the lobbyists will do
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:47.760]  Imagine the power and we're already seeing Obama give healthcare waivers to his friends and G's exempt from carbon taxes
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:51.880]  Imagine the power this gives the oligarchy now
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:56.400]  They're not having to buy off 500 members of the House and Senate of the Congress now
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:01.800]  They just go to 12 super tyrants and now we learn it was never about raising the debt limit
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:06.240]  It was all about getting this agreement for the crisis that they were about the stage
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:10.400]  I think it's it's imperative now that that legal action
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:17.960]  Emerge against these these these entities the United States of America is the most powerful modern state
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:22.240]  The United States could reach out and crush these agencies like cockroaches
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:29.080]  Simply using the you know the well-known track record look look what they did in but instead their operatives run the government
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:33.800]  So they're they're taming the giant we are now kneeling to the one inch goblin
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:41.120]  That is you know that is the New World Order and we're being taught and the Chinese are getting to buggy whippison talk about
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:46.320]  How the dollars dead and it's all part of our humiliation. Yeah, I would also say on this
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:54.160]  It's time to stand up for the United States Putin says the United States is a parasite. This is wrong. I'm sorry Putin think again
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:58.520]  Wall Street is a parasite, but if you look at the US economy
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:05.760]  Let's just look at US food production the US family farm the grain and the corn that the US produces
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:10.520]  Is the basis of the entire world food market? It's the only thing that's preventing
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:17.440]  Zones of the world from going into absolute famine and genocide. So let's not overdo it on the US
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:21.360]  Parasitism Wall Street is a parasite. There's no doubt about that
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:26.400]  But there's also a productive economy here, which we could Wall Street is the parasite that's grown
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:32.320]  Globally powerful from sucking our blood. It's the too big to fail instead of it telling us that we
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:37.820]  Are bankrupt and we are scum and and jumping on this global bandwagon
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:40.740]  We have to expose that they are the parasites
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:47.600]  The other thing is the Chinese now there is this ratings agency, which is sort of a fly-by-night operation
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:52.080]  I don't know what it is. Is it a tongue? Is it a branch of the People's Liberation Army?
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:57.640]  I don't know who they are. I don't care about I don't like their ratings agencies any more than I like the ones here
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:02.400]  It's time for China to butt out of the internal affairs of the United States
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:09.200]  I don't want to hear advice from the Chinese about what kind of genocidal budget cuts we need to have no, sorry
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:15.480]  And those crybabies they should think now if if they went into the market and bought US Treasury bonds
[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:21.160]  You know very well if you buy a bond in the market, it's a marketable bond. It goes up and down it fluctuates
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:26.040]  You can't come crying to sell I made an investment and then it went down too bad
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:29.360]  That was a very well by bad-mouthing the investment
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:35.720]  They're only devaluing their previous investment and that's what's so scary about this as the US goes under
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:42.240]  If people think Greece is sucking Europe down if the US goes under we are looking at a total worldwide
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:49.320]  Depression again, I would not blame Greece. This is not Greece. This is an attack by the hedge fund hyenas
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:54.640]  Organized in a conspiratorial meeting in a Manhattan townhouse. The Webster. I wasn't blaming Greece
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:55:00.200]  I'm saying if people think Greece and the bankers robbing it is causing problems in Europe
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:05.200]  Imagine what the US going under would look like. Okay now just in terms of that Italian judge, right?
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:11.240]  Ruggiero, he's he's doing things now the Greek speaking of the Greeks the Greeks have just banned
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:15.920]  Short-selling in the Athens stock market for the next two months
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:22.880]  This is the way with the future and it was when you're attacked by speculators and their ratings agencies in this whole cabal of
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:27.240]  Financial interest you got to fight back the modern state has to fight back
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:31.120]  One of the things you could say is isn't
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:35.720]  S&P and aren't these ratings agencies really a super national institution?
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:41.680]  Could the United States not defend itself using something like the trading with the enemy act?
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:47.360]  I've talked about the need to start a new tea party and the TVA in my tea party is
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:52.400]  trading with the enemy act which allows you to then say look we're being attacked
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.480]  the our
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:56:01.520]  Markets and our our economic life. By the way, this is something bombs bombs can't even do. It's so destructive
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:05.920]  They are attacking us the people that triple a rated known crud
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:11.240]  Totally run by the megabanks are now doing this so they can prey upon us even more
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:18.160]  It is absolutely the Federal Reserve is an enemy operation. This whole thing is an outside financial
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:25.560]  Paramilitary takeover and I say arrest all of them right now for sedition and attempted overthrow of this country
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:28.920]  I think that's what it is. We are we are just
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:34.680]  The country is under attack and at that point you've got to essentially do what you need to do now
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:42.200]  The other thing is what what may these characters be be be be preparing next we have the following situation Greece
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:49.280]  Portugal and Ireland are already receiving European bailouts from this crazy fund
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:54.960]  Very misguided fun should not have been done, which is our money again, but then we get blamed for everything
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:57:01.200]  Well, yeah, I don't know if that's not quite so clear cut, but it's a it's a it's a lunatic policy
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:06.960]  But this means that that the speculators have turned away from the original trio of Greece
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:08.640]  spectacular
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:13.480]  Portugal and Ireland at least for the moment they had been lifted and shifted to
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:19.920]  Italy and Spain starting on July 11th, especially with Italy and then crescendo last week
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.320]  At the moment
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:26.240]  They seem to be looking as one guy on CNBC was saying this morning
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:33.720]  The sharks the hedge fund hyenas are looking for new victims and who might that be the probable
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:40.160]  Sequence is something like this first comes Belgium of the northern European countries
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:48.320]  The one with the most vulnerable bond markets is Belgium and again if there are any Belgian government officials listing in guys
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:51.160]  ban credit default swaps now
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:56.840]  Ban shorting of your government bonds and you will protect yourself after Belgium
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:03.960]  France and now you're striking at the very heart of the European Union the French German
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:12.120]  Relations, so if the French come under this attack, I think even even with a with a no-good-nick like saw cozy in power
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:16.560]  Something is gonna have to give and with somebody in Europe is gonna have to say
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:22.720]  Are we just gonna sit here and be raped or are we gonna fight back and we'll see right?
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:27.640]  They may lie down play dead roll over whatever it is or they may fight back in the web sir
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:34.440]  Thanks the form of the band on credit default swaps do five more minutes with us ahead of know me friends joining us

[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:28.720]  I mean, I'm not just up here saying we're in deep trouble
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:34.560]  You know because it's fun to do on radio. I mean this is this is happening worse and faster than I thought I
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:41.440]  Want to have you back up in the next few days to do a whole hour on on what's happening and also solutions
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:47.800]  But briefly in the time we've got left Webster, I know that you are a learned man who I respect
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:49.680]  And I've done a lot of research myself
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:54.000]  So I know bona fide when I see it and I believe a lot of your solutions
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:58.880]  Once we've gotten to this collective of system, you know, there's only one way to extricate yourself out
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:04.080]  And that isn't pay everything to the bankers. I get all that but they're not gonna do what you've said
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:06.440]  They're not gonna do what other economists have warned about they're not gonna do it
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:10.260]  Dr. Roberts talks about with truly investing in domestic production
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:15.380]  That's not happening. So with the runaway crazies. We've got running things
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:21.060]  And bankers who said they want to implode this country to consolidate it. Where are they taking us?
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:26.220]  Where are we gonna be next week a month from now a year from now if we don't change course?
[02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:28.580]  Well, I would say first of all on the euro side
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:30.380]  there's gonna be a
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:32.380]  concerted attempt to
[02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:36.580]  Escalate the euro crisis between now and the end of the month of August because again
[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:40.780]  This is the month when everybody in southern Europe be it Italy Spain
[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:47.540]  Bavaria right anyplace that's Catholic by about August 15th. They shut down just about completely
[02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:54.980]  Germany somewhat the same thing even in the northern parts. They have very low volumes in these bond markets perfect time
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:03:00.900]  For the hedge fund IE is from New York and London to come in and make their attacks using credit default swap
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:07.140]  So look for the the attack on the euro will escalate and again Belgium and then France and then it's
[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:13.260]  At the point that France comes under attack out people realize this is indeed a world economic depression
[02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:21.020]  That's their side now on the US side. Remember the depression comes in three waves right 1921 1929 is a crash
[02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:28.520]  1931 a European banking crisis then it comes back to the US as a terminal banking panic 1932
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:32.840]  1933 so we're now in the second wave of the current depression
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:37.800]  But you can already see what the third wave or whatever it's going to be called the third wave looks like
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:45.800]  Banking crash here. Take a look at the bank stocks today as you say led by Bank of America with
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:49.240]  These other places Jenworth city bank
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:55.400]  Look at those European banks I mentioned before but in particular the US ones and the British ones
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:02.480]  Look for something dramatic to happen there. Who is the next Lehman brothers? Who is the next Bear Stearns?
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.880]  There are lots of candidates again
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:13.240]  Just pick up any any website about the the bank stocks and the super congress has the power to give them more zombie bank bailouts now
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:17.040]  Right. Well, we the other thing is why is this happening now?
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:24.040]  One of the things is the Obama stimulus rotten as it was still had some effect and QE to rotten
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:28.920]  As that was these popped up the the zombie banks and the hedge fund hyenas now
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:33.880]  The stimulus is over the QE to is over and they're confronted with the fact that we're in it
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:39.880]  We're still in the depression. The other thing is the dark Frank Finregg was supposed to solve these problems
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:43.880]  The dark Frank Finregg from a year ago is an absolute obscene joke
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:47.000]  It didn't do anything time to go back and have a real Finregg
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:51.360]  But all right Webster doing thank you. We're gonna have you back up in the next few days
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:55.120]  I'll have jaren talk to you right now about when is a good time to get on for a full hours
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:05:01.120]  We can also take some calls. No me friends coming up and continue to look at this stock market plunge. That's happening right now
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:06.200]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:11.400]  This is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:14.720]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:21.360]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:26.160]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:31.440]  Full the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:36.320]  Hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:42.720]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to?
[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:46.560]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C.
[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:54.720]  We have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of full of the republic on dvd at info wars.com

[02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:09.040]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:17.040]  He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family
[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:24.640]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is he's usually right. You see he predicted the collapse of GM
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:32.000]  Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest small owner general growth properties. In fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:37.680]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet

[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:13.120]  My friends
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.480]  I can barely contain myself right now
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:31.200]  If you go to drudgeraport.com you can read a detailed report that paul joseph watson put out
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:37.120]  This morning. It's posted right up in the right hand breaking news corner of drudgeraport.com
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:39.120]  From info wars.com
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:41.360]  Polster americans are pre-revolutionary
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:46.880]  Just 17 percent believe u.s. Government has consent of the governed
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:53.600]  Well, they know that you're awake. That's why they just transferred the power to the super congress the austerity congress
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:58.080]  12 members with obama with a veto a 13 member council
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:00.800]  And they've got pat caddell
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:08.160]  Polster at rasmussen other major polls. I don't just believe one poll. We've got a whole index of polls showing the same numbers are worse
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:15.920]  Summers lowest nine percent approval rating the results of this survey indicate that americans are now pre-revolutionary. That's a quote
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:20.560]  Says polster pat caddell who described the outcome of the poll as
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:23.440]  unprecedented
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:28.960]  This conclusion follows caddell's observation last november that a sea of anger is churning amongst americans
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:35.040]  Who want to take their country back and that the nation stood on the brink of pre-revolutionary movement?
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:38.240]  Now here's the deal. We've got to get the left and the right
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:44.160]  And libertarians to everybody to go wait a minute. It's not about obama the puppet as much as it's fun to hate him
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:47.760]  It's not about the puppet george w. Bush as much fun as it is to hate him
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:53.520]  It looks like a demon acts like a demon you got to get past these people to the big megabanks
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:58.240]  And and the derivatives that they got us in europe sign on to that we don't know
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:02.560]  Now look our 14 and a half trillion dollar deficit easy to deal with
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:07.840]  They're trying to tell us it's about pension funds and social security. We're a rich country
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:13.680]  We're fiscally solvent and the spin golly trick here is
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:20.080]  For the bankers to get us to sign on to 1.5 quadrillion 600 trillion the washington post says is the us share
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:23.040]  Get us to sign on to this
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:29.040]  And then make us think it's all about the 14 and a half trillion that we actually have spent
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  It's a joke the zombie banks are the problem and they're going to hold us all hostage now joining us for the next 20 minutes
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:38.320]  Or so is nomi prince
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:41.840]  Journalists best-selling authors. You got a new book coming out in october. We'll have her on
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:46.800]  Before becoming a journalist and nomi couldn't watch what she was doing is seeing anymore
[02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:53.200]  So she left she worked on wall street as a managing director at golden sacks and running the international analytics group at
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:56.160]  Bear Stearns in london. She was analyzing the big spectrum
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:59.520]  So she was piloting a star destroyer for these people
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:09.520]  And she joins us now nomi prince not naomi. No me in omi prince dot com links up on info wars dot com
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.280]  and
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:15.920]  I want to get her view on the super congress on the hypocritical rating agency
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:20.640]  She's got an article out into that title. I want to get her view on where we're going because for my research
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:22.800]  This is a planned
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:28.320]  Implosion, but it's a black hole so giant they've created that it may suck them in with it
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:31.360]  Like bank of america plunging in the stock right now
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:37.120]  This could be the beginning of a major route. Could this be bigger than 2008 nomi. What say you?
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:44.720]  Well, we've talked about this and I continue to say we have never since 2008 been in any kind of a recovery
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:48.640]  This has all been going on and down behind the scenes and also
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:53.680]  Right out in in public view. We don't have a handle on
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:12:01.360]  All of the assets all this toxicity all the debt everything that was created by the banking system in the run up to 2008
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:04.640]  official crisis and since then that is still
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:07.920]  globally dispersed and
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:15.440]  And declining and degrading the global economy as we speak so the there's a couple things going on here
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:20.960]  And and it's the rating agency coming in and downgrading is one aspect of many things going on
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:24.560]  But the bottom line here is that banks created a mess
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:30.080]  Thanks profited from the mess and yes, some might go down and some might have their stocks go down
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:32.080]  But they made a whole lot of money on the run up
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:38.720]  They can position themselves to short or to not value the securities that are still on their books because they counting
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:43.680]  The financial accounting standards board says they don't have to and all sorts of other tricks
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000]  Meanwhile, they are floated
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:53.120]  By the government by the federal reserve by a whole lot of subsidies that we have no control over we don't vote for
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.400]  And that is how they continue to thrive and do what they're doing with no repercussions
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:06.080]  We feel the repercussions and in today's mess in the dow is just just one aspect of so many repercussions that we've been feeling
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:08.240]  And we'll continue to feel
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:15.280]  Well very well said no me so so where are we going from here now?
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:18.400]  From your expert
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:21.920]  A position of research and knowledge. Where are we right now?
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:28.000]  I think right now we're we're in the middle of a massive global downfall and that's because
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:32.160]  For one thing if you don't fix problems, they don't go away
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:37.120]  They only the only group of people who think they might go away if they're not focused on fixing them are
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:41.360]  The people in washington as you rightly stated. It doesn't matter what party they're from
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:50.560]  It doesn't matter who selected which treasury secretary. It doesn't matter who's who's even running the fed. It's it's a concerted denial of
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:57.520]  Today's problems definitely and problems that that we're merging and today's problems and today's a debt for example
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.640]  Uh, the four trillion dollars of extra debt that have been created in just the last two and a half years
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:06.320]  as you rightly said have not been created because we had to save social security
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:12.960]  Or because uh, you know, we're we're giving too much away to workers and we're helping the labor economy and and we're creating jobs
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:18.720]  That that that's obviously clearly not what has been going on with the debt that's been created and and it's interesting
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:24.000]  I I someone actually I think one of your listeners sent this to me. I'm not sure there's a u.s. National debt
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:28.880]  Infographic at the White House's website the links on my site. I'll send it to you
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:34.480]  But they have 3.6 trillion dollars worth of debt created in the last few years that they label
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:37.040]  economic and technical changes
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:39.920]  Say no, I know
[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:44.400]  It's laughable and by the way that doesn't include we do know that there was a stimulus package
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:52.160]  Um, that was an 800 billion package. That's not in that 3.6 trillion right the 3.6 trillion. It's just laughable, you know
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:54.720]  general
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:15:00.640]  Uh, unaccountable behind it type of of moniker for basically saying we gave a lot of stuff to the banks
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:06.720]  Um, we printed a lot of money to really flow what was going on as we talked about on your show last time the banks for
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:10.160]  example hold 1.6 trillion dollars of treasury bonds that they
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:17.120]  They basically got from the treasury gave to the fed receive interest from the fed doing absolutely nothing of any kind of
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:20.880]  Productivity for the u.s. Economy or any individual in the united states or globally
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:23.840]  That's just that's just one number of that 3.6 trillion
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:30.400]  That's just 1.6 trillion of it and it goes well look at the look at the big six megabanks record bonuses record profits
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:34.640]  But at the end of the day, how are they going to operate when their parasite economy?
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:40.960]  Has destroyed what's left of the real economy and I guess they say it's better to reign in hell than serve in heaven
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:45.680]  Because most the experts we talked to know me they say that we've really been
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:51.440]  In a depressionary spiral for three years and that this is going to deliver us on the course
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:57.760]  We're on into a real depression and that they've set up this super congress to be able to do whatever they want during a crisis
[02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:02.640]  What do you think about uh, that you know the term depression a and b super congress?
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:06.160]  Well, you know, the term depression is definitely viable. I
[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:09.200]  I've used it as well and um, you know how
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:13.600]  Um the back in the early part of last century before world war one
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:16.000]  They called the first world war the great war, right?
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  And then we have the the great depression
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:23.440]  And then by the time we got to world war two world war the great war became world war one and we had world war two
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:27.280]  And in that respect we are in great depression two because
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:29.920]  We have no
[02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:35.600]  Way out of where we're at but the fact is the hole is so deep and it's unfortunate
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:41.840]  It's sad and and there could have been things to have been done along the way to mitigate of the problem that were just simply ignored
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:45.600]  By washington by global leaders by global central banks
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:52.160]  Because they weren't actually either recognizing or in fact they were sustaining the banking system
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:57.040]  The private banking system that was really funneling debt into the economy toxic debt
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:02.960]  High-rated debt that allowed it to be dispersed. So the the rating agency is going back to what's just happened today
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:08.800]  We're definitely a part of this puzzle. They didn't rate certain bad debt certain bad assets triple a
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:15.060]  They wouldn't have been dispersed and sold throughout the global economy bringing whole cities and municipalities
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:18.160]  Intention funds down with them. They were they were labeled
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:23.920]  Wrong and and there's been no accountability for that and it's the same lack of accountability that's created
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:27.360]  This downrope file because it's if what is sustaining
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:35.920]  Municipalities, what's sustaining local towns? What's sustaining local pension funds? What's the staining local workers isn't real
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:42.400]  Um, then as much as anyone can work as much as anyone can attempt to find jobs to that's right
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:46.720]  We've invested our whole economy in a planned Ponzi scheme fraud
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:49.760]  And now the Ponzi scheme operators are saying go down with us
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:56.160]  Let us rule you or you won't even get 10% of what you invested and we've got to just decide to cut bait
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:58.720]  I want to talk about how we go after these people with you
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:05.680]  Know me Prince former managing director at Goldman Sachs here in just a moment, but first I wanted to play this clip of Geithner
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:12.720]  Uh over the weekend saying hey, uh, or well the the clip was reared over the weekend saying two months ago
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:15.280]  We're not going to lose our triple a rating. Here it is
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:19.440]  Thank you. Mr. Secretary. Thanks for joining Fox business
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:25.520]  Is there a risk that the united states could lose its triple a credit rating? Yes or no?
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:27.600]  No risk of that. No risk. No risk again
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:32.560]  If you look if you listen carefully now, you see the leadership of the united states of america the president
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:38.000]  That's enough now. This is the same guy who said it was no danger of even a recession when we've been in a depression
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:40.640]  And uh, he's now running around
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:45.280]  Uh, uh saying that this is the quote greatest recession. No me
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:53.120]  Yeah, I mean that that comment. I think the rest of that clip does he he goes from no chance to absolutely
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:57.040]  I think the term was also thrown in there at the end of that clip. I was I was I was watching it on
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:03.440]  On television. I think that's the same guy and and and that's and anyway, it's not even just tim geithner
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:09.280]  It's what tim geithner represents. He just happens to be in a very powerful position to to really hurt us
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:16.000]  Um, he's the same guy who labeled the 3.6 trillion of extra debt that they've created under the last few years economic and technical changes
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:20.480]  It's it's that same denial that same. No, we don't have a problem
[02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:25.200]  Yeah, this debt is just created because we're in a rough spot. You know, we're in a recession
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:28.960]  If people aren't making as much money. No, it's not the money that's coming in
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:36.160]  To the treasury department and yes, there can be tax changes people can at the top pay their fair share corporations can stop
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:39.120]  No, but the problem is we've been tied into a fake black hole
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:43.040]  Exactly that that's the point and the way that they've been attempting
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:48.320]  Um, not that they've been actually trying to fix this black hole is to make it blacker and deeper
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:54.080]  And and and and that doesn't that that can't end there. They're not looking at the problem properly
[02:19:54.400 --> 02:20:00.240]  Um, well, let's look at it properly. No, let me start interrupting. Let's look at it properly on the other side. Stay where this will be right back

[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:42.800]  guest best-selling author
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:46.720]  She's got a new book coming out in october black
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:51.520]  Tuesday a novel by no me friends will definitely have her back up for that
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:57.680]  She has another article ratings agency hypocrites s and p downgrade carries a large dose of irony
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:05.280]  Since the extra debt the u.s. Has piled on recently came courtesy of s and p's moronic toxic asset ratings
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:11.760]  They could call it moronic, but it did help the banks make trillions of fraudulent dollars and take over society
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:15.360]  So is it is it really moronic? No me
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:17.600]  um, yeah, that's a
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:22.720]  That's a good term. It's it's uh, it's certainly diabolical moronic or some sort of combination
[02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:28.960]  It's it's the s and p of course gets paid by these banks to rate the assets they rate they get paid by size
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:34.720]  They get paid by number of deals. So the more uh bad assets that banks can manufacture
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:40.000]  The more money s and p gets you know, so they they don't get money from the earth treasury department
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.440]  Which might be why they downrated them
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:45.040]  But the point is they were definitely a part of this entire scheme
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:50.720]  They they they were like the stamp of approval on you know, if they were in a car manufacturer situation
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:55.680]  They'd be stamping an approval on the cars that have no brakes and and they would say oh, that's fine. So in that respect
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:26:00.640]  Um, you know, they're definitely a part of this entire scheme in a bad way
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:04.080]  And there's a difference between being cunning and being wise
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:06.080]  They're definitely cunning, but they are
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:09.680]  Kind of like the farmer who killed the golden goose in the four minutes. We have left. No me
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:13.200]  I've got two questions for you and i'm going to sit back and give you the floor on me
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:18.640]  Because I really want your perspective if we don't turn things around and let these people run us into the black hole
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:22.560]  What will our future look like and what do you expect to unfold?
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:28.480]  Versus what are solutions and ideas you have to extricate ourselves from this emergency?
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:34.080]  Well, if we if we don't turn this around and it's not looking like Washington at this point has those solutions
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:37.760]  Then i'll get to those we we are continuing to spiral downwards
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:44.320]  The the the assets that were manufactured the debt that relies on them not just in the united states, but but throughout the globe
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:46.880]  Can't go away
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:52.240]  Because they are in this situation where banks can cover themselves. They can get
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:57.600]  Central banks to print money they can act as the go-between and receive
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:04.880]  Debt and get interest on that debt and keep going because the focus of the central banking system is
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:09.280]  To allow banks to float as they are their stock might go down on any given day
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:13.440]  But the bigger banks because they are so infused in this system
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:19.040]  Continue to do well continue five and don't forget they can short they can be on the other side of positions
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:23.680]  There's a lot of things that they can do that the average individual can't do you can't short your life
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:28.960]  You know you can't short your job banks can be on either side of a lot of these financial mechanisms
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:34.160]  And and that's how the bigger ones survive the more places they are the more focus and influence they have
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:39.440]  The more they survive. I'm sorry about the flip side of that the global economy continues to deteriorate because nothing of
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:42.880]  Actual value is being put into a trading value
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:49.840]  GDP of which a portion is debt and the other portion is profits coming off of paper
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:58.240]  Revenues from from a banking system or from the corporations that they sponsor. That's not real productivity. That's not really sustaining an economy
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:00.000]  and unless
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.560]  The the combination of political leaders and financial banking leaders
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:11.520]  Seize this and actually kind of flaps these banks into place and and takes away their ability to infiltrate
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:15.440]  The financial markets and the whole global economic system in the way that they have
[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:19.760]  Things are going to continue to spiral down, you know, you go back to the crash in 1929
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:26.560]  What spawned the first great depression there was a situation then where six banks also controlled a lot and got a lot of support
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:32.160]  From a different kind of a fed that's certainly from a different form of a government and we're able to survive the same six banks
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:38.000]  Survived today in different forms. That's what we're dealing with a very small group of very influential banks that are everywhere
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:42.000]  That will continue to drive the economy down unless there's something in place on the other side
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:44.400]  What can be put in place on the other side?
[02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:50.400]  Will to slap them into place for number one will to break up the banks will to break up their hold
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:53.120]  Will to break up the amount of leverage and debt they can create
[02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:59.600]  On the back of no value and infiltrate throughout the system more checks on what types of products they are
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:04.720]  pushing throughout the global system an awareness on the part of
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:07.600]  towns and cities and municipalities and
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:10.640]  Impensions funds to not buy things
[02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:16.960]  They don't understand to not make to not create a situation where workers who think that they have a stable nest ag
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:23.760]  Say it, you know, basically drop into their retirement because they can't control what's being put into and how it's being invested
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:28.080]  And I think from the get-go instead of creating all this debt to slow the banking system
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:32.560]  What the what the White House calls economic and technical change debt that should have been used
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:36.880]  To really help the job market to really help people
[02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:43.680]  Absolutely deliver it. Yeah, Bernanke wasn't dropping money out of a helicopter. He was delivering it to the foreign bankers. Tell me friends

[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:43.200]  Okay, going now to dr. Steve Pachennick with our audience been listening to him now here for
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:49.280]  Nine and a half years since he was first on with us and said that bin Laden had already died and it was all staged
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:51.280]  I then had other sources that confirmed that
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:56.800]  He then of course resurfaced on the show, which we were glad to hear about because I wrote stories about him
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:35:59.760]  A few months ago with the may day may 1st
[02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:06.560]  Bin Laden raid and I got him on today to briefly give us his take on the navy seals his shootdown situation
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:13.280]  But then get into the state of the economy and the politicians we've gotten where he sees this country going because last time
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:17.440]  He was on the interview was over and he had wanted to get into that and I want to get his perspective
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:21.920]  I talked to him during the break and I said, what's your view and you said? Well, they fly a lot of missions. It's dangerous
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:24.240]  I don't think this is a false flag
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:27.200]  And I respect that opinion my my
[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:32.080]  Smell test here is that the same unit
[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:37.680]  You know from the same unit a group raiding the bin Laden thing. We know that's totally phony
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:42.640]  A lot of us predicted that if it was phony you'd start seeing people dying in crashes
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:48.000]  Either where they just tagged their names on to crashes that actually happen or whether they actually kill them in crashes
[02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:51.840]  Uh, and you've got the fact that it's the biggest one day loss of life
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:54.880]  In this close to ten year war and it is the seals
[02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:56.880]  the very
[02:36:56.880 --> 02:36:58.880]  The whole thing is very very suspicious
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:04.880]  For me because if the I mean if they're saying the seals were there and and and you know gave bin Laden cement shoes
[02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:08.240]  And the whole official story turned out to be as phony as a three dollar bill
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:13.840]  Then you've got to then investigate this and and ask where they pulling a pat tillman
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:17.680]  Getting rid of some people that were going to speak out and we have gotten that
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:22.160]  Uh, unconfirmed scuttle, but uh dr. Pachennick good to have you on with us today
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:29.600]  Well, it's a pleasure always to be on I think at this point. I think one of the things I do work informally with
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:34.320]  Uh people who are in the special forces and I have a great respect for them
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:37.120]  I've worked with them for some 20 to 30 years
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:39.680]  different areas from Panama
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:41.280]  the Middle East
[02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:44.000]  uh all over the world and um
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:52.720]  I think what your public has to understand there are times that really the special forces is a very elite unit
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:56.880]  I mean they they really are elite in many ways their language capacity
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:02.480]  Their ability to be inserted surgically into an area and be extracted out very quickly
[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:04.960]  That's an even very successful
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:09.120]  The fact that there are stories that the Osama bin Laden issue was
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:17.120]  Uh, they didn't kill Osama bin Laden. He was already dead. But the point was there was a an extraction done at that area
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:20.800]  I said they they basically did go in and out. They've been going in and out of
[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:25.760]  Pakistan and in Afghanistan for a long while now the issue here is
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:31.040]  You know, what is the problem in the united states? Why is it that we have a very hard time?
[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:37.600]  understanding what the credibility is for the US military and the US government and that is because the US government has
[02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:42.720]  Repeatedly lied to us in this particular case. You do have individuals who have been killed
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:50.000]  They were not killed uh by the military. They have been killed in assignments. Basically, I can explain to you that
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:58.480]  The special forces, which is not only consisting of seals that consist of Delta Rangers and other units, which I will not go into
[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:04.320]  Really worse 365 days a year. I mean you have to understand what that means
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:08.240]  That means that these guys are continuously going in in the helicopter
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:14.000]  They're going into areas that are exceedingly dangerous and terrain that is very very difficult
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:18.560]  Both to get into and get out of uh, and basically in many ways
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:25.840]  They're the only forces that can handle insurgents who will really appear and disappear in in matters of seconds of minutes
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:31.200]  And they are supported at times with helicopters that are in different
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  configurations in this case
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:39.680]  They had to bring in a large number of special forces some of whom were seals
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:42.240]  I'm sure the other ones were rangers in there and other
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:46.960]  Groups and I won't identify and they were shot down now
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:49.680]  The credibility of the story
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:54.720]  Blends itself to some questions of you know, is this possible if it's not possible?
[02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:58.160]  But I'll give you an example where I live in south florida
[02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:02.960]  You have an obituary on the slain navy seal who lived in south florida
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:09.680]  Now if the military is going to go to the extent of telling you exactly who slain which units were involved
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:15.760]  That's a lot of credibility. They're putting on the line to say that the american public that this is real now
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:18.880]  It's a tragedy that our men are getting killed
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:25.200]  But it's a greater tragedy if the military thinks that they're going to continuously create stories
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:31.360]  That are not credible and at this point I would say, you know, let us slain our credibility
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:34.720]  To the military and give them the benefit of the doubt
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:40.320]  But what this means to the military as they're listening to me is that you have to be very careful
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:47.120]  Of what your narrative is going to be because there's a major issue that's involved here in terms of the military
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:55.360]  And that issue is because of the timing I can understand why the american public is questioning this episode the timing
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:41:04.880]  It seems very serendipitous that it comes right to the degrading of our bond and our ability to pay for military salaries
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:08.880]  And to pay for the military industrial complex. That's number one
[02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:13.040]  That would be what we call an s1 question in the intelligence community
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:20.000]  That is why would a story like this come out at this particular point in time when we're not able to use government
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:25.040]  To pay out even for the faa or social security of medicare
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:29.680]  And the answer is if I were in the military and I wanted to create a narrative
[02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:33.360]  I'm not saying they are doing the narrative, but if I wanted to create a narrative
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:39.360]  I would say in the military in Afghanistan in iraq if I were that senate bill in that mecca million
[02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:43.200]  I would say, you know what we're going to create a crash and we're going to glorify
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:49.840]  The task of some of our soldiers in order to remind the american public who's really not behind this war
[02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:57.200]  That we need an allocation of money and by the way do not attempt to decrease our budget, which is really
[02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:02.080]  Directed this episode as a narrative and I'm not saying that's what they've done
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:06.400]  But if that's what I would think of if I were involved in the military and I needed a budget
[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:11.760]  Resurrection I would direct this episode really to congress and to the senate
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:16.720]  Because the military has every congressman and senator in their pocket
[02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:20.960]  And that held hostage right now to a military industrial complex
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:29.280]  And what's happening is that the insurgency doctrine worked for a certain amount of time when betrayers developed it
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:35.200]  There was nothing new and betrayers general patrice admitted. This was not something that was developed
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:39.440]  Suddenly didn't know though. This has been around for hundreds if not thousands of years
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:46.480]  We use counterinsurgency in the revolutionary war. We've used counterinsurgency in the lage who we used it in vietnam
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:52.400]  So the doctrine itself has become what we call reified. It's become something of a
[02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:58.400]  Doctrine that everybody now believes in the military is the only solution to dealing with insurgency
[02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:00.160]  The answer is no
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:05.680]  It is not the only solution and it cannot be the only solution because as much as we might want to get rid of
[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:10.000]  Extremism or terrorism that's not feasible and it's not possible
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:14.400]  As I said years ago terrorism is a tactic not a strategy
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:19.600]  And what's happening now is we have three and four star generals who may be invested
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:23.040]  In maintaining that strategy of counterinsurgency
[02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:30.720]  And they believe that the best way up the career ladder is to basically reify the concept of counterinsurgency
[02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:36.160]  Well patrice was brought over to the CIA. You have channels now who are three and four stars
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:39.280]  But more importantly what this story has highlighted for me
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:44.400]  And in talking to some of the junior officers that we have a major disconnect
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:49.600]  Between the captains lieutenants the majors can see your officers
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:53.600]  And what do I mean by that the flag officers meaning the colonels
[02:43:53.600 --> 02:44:00.800]  The brigadier generals the major generals lieutenant generals are really a serious problem for our military
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:06.720]  There's a problem of careerism that's coming in that is made our military
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:13.200]  I'm very vulnerable to another war that is for the first time we've chosen this war and we've we've
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:16.240]  Impulcated and we've put in and placed in
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:21.040]  Soldiers into two different areas iraq and afghanistan
[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:29.280]  And overall from a strategic point of view the wars have not been successful in iraq. We have not built a civil society
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:31.280]  It's basically
[02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:37.680]  Disorganized any junior officer will tell you that and at danis dan we have not been able to stop the taliban
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:40.160]  We've put in carze who's gonna corrupt
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:45.440]  He was on the cia payroll as I remembered him was put in by zalmi halazad
[02:44:45.440 --> 02:44:53.760]  I wanted the neotons, and it has been totally a failure. So from the point of view of the final military doctrine
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:55.360]  This is not worked
[02:44:55.360 --> 02:45:01.200]  And basically the only solution to this is to have a strong enough president which unfortunately we do not have
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:07.200]  a strong enough secretary of state to withdraw the entire military from iraq and
[02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:13.040]  Afghanistan as we have much greater issues that are involved here right now
[02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:17.760]  We're involved in mexico. Unfortunately the cia and the special forces
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:24.560]  They made a public announcement are going into mexico and private contracts is to deal with the narcotics problem
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:26.480]  Which is on our southern border
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:32.640]  We have another major issue and that is the expansion of the soviet union and the proxies as well as china
[02:45:32.720 --> 02:45:38.560]  So we have to be prepared at the level of the junior levels the captains the natures
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:44.480]  Lieutenant's to be able to afford them a military structure, which is not based on careerism
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:49.040]  But it's based on their dedication to honor glory in our country
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:56.240]  And that's not happening many of our junior officers are leaving the military because they don't see an upward path
[02:45:56.880 --> 02:45:59.920]  to a career where they can be uh
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:07.040]  Reimbursed for the courage and the dedication that given to dr. Pachennik. That's my that's my next
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:12.000]  I just gave one sense for the the careerism leaves into the military industrial complex
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:17.600]  That is we've got three and four star generals who are serving in public companies
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:21.280]  And private companies which are making an absolute fortune
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:30.320]  Which are creating a burden on our budget and the congressmen and senators are afraid to take down this military industrial complex
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:35.760]  As president isan harrow warned us this complex has been completely
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:44.240]  Consolidated to cost us hundreds of billions of dollars or not increase our security factor. Well, sure
[02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:51.440]  But I mean that's my point. I wanted to ask you where is it all going when when the generals and colonels reportedly are in these lavish
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:53.600]  pleasure
[02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:55.280]  Rooms, you know
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:47:01.040]  On their private, you know fancy military jets and then the rest of the troops now are are are
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:05.680]  You know flying on planes with broken toilets and and and fleas all over. I mean
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:10.160]  I'm sure you've seen the reports where everything's rotting where they're taking the death benefits of troops
[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:13.200]  I mean, there's an attitude by the ruling class in america
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:19.520]  That this country isn't going to be here soon. So just get everything you can we've always had corruption
[02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:21.760]  But now it is a psychopathic
[02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:25.360]  Uh short term almost nihilistic
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:30.400]  Craziness, you know, it's not even a calculating corruption
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:35.760]  It's just a wild fiddle while roam burns. I want you to comment on
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:41.040]  On that and then where you see this country going if there isn't a reversal of this
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:48.320]  Well, I see the country going into where we are right now and in freefall and entropy and and the the basic issue
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:51.520]  Is what she said let me go back to the military what this highlighted
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:58.640]  Was the fact that the retired generals and animals could hire back as mentors consultants to s a i c
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:00.640]  to dying the corp
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:02.080]  to
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:07.840]  All the 128 bandits for money that are absolutely absorbed. I mean there's one general
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:10.960]  I know of who makes nine hundred and twenty thousand dollars
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:19.200]  As a consultant to the company then makes another hundred and sixty thousand as a as a mentor, which means that they
[02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:26.800]  Basically teaching our military what should it shouldn't be done and then gets other benefits attention
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:29.200]  So basically we have to break this up
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:36.400]  Who is we it's congress in the senate they're not strong enough to do it the president is not strong enough to do it
[02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:43.040]  It has to come from the people through the media social media through organizations to say look
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:46.960]  More money to the military now does not mean better security
[02:48:47.360 --> 02:48:52.560]  What's happening now is our junior officers are very dissatisfied with our senior leadership
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:57.280]  And one of the things that we did not do after the vietnam war what we did do
[02:48:57.280 --> 02:49:03.200]  Well, I was in the vietnam war and other wars is that we got rid of the incompetent battalion and brigade commanders
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:08.560]  And we literally got rid of them one of my jobs was to come in and see who was effective
[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:13.760]  Who was not if they weren't effective at the brigade at battalion level they were let they were thrown out
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:19.440]  That's not happening. They're going up to three and four star levels where in fact
[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:25.840]  It's hurting us very seriously in terms of recruiting our junior officers and keeping them there
[02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:31.360]  And we have a sociopathy that's built into the military now where they need to maintain
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:35.680]  Their pensions and lavish lifestyles. You said how do we stop that?
[02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:39.040]  This president is not strong enough to stop it number one
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:41.280]  He's never served in the military number two
[02:49:41.680 --> 02:49:47.760]  He really is intimidated by our generals in the military industrial complex and three he's supported by it
[02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:53.840]  Who's strong enough? Well, the only people who could be strong enough is somebody similar to an eisenhower
[02:49:54.240 --> 02:49:59.920]  Who had been commander-in-chief of armed forces understood our military understood their
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:06.800]  Wily ways and how they build up the military industrial complex. We don't have that if you look at the field right now in republicans
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:12.320]  There's a great article today in the under new york times, which I don't often out, but I know the gentleman
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:18.720]  Uh, uh, mr. Huntsman and pasted a huntsman who claims that he can run our country and he knows how to do it
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:22.480]  He's a Mormon happens to be Mormon was the governor in Utah a nice man
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:30.000]  Uh, very quiet. He wants civility, but in fact, he's not very confident. He was in my ambassador when I was in Singapore
[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:33.280]  I was involved in the commiteroos and creating a
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:41.440]  An agreement and taking down the forces in that in cambodium. I would say he was really not effective as an ambassador in Singapore
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:47.600]  Then his father got him into a job which raked and then got him a job in china and taiwan
[02:50:47.680 --> 02:50:51.280]  I'm sure he donated money, but uh dr. Pachinic. We've got a break
[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:54.560]  We're gonna break we're gonna come right back with dr. Pachinic on the other side

[02:53:01.600 --> 02:53:06.400]  Question can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our minds
[02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:10.560]  author jose calazzo answers yes in his two new books
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:18.160]  America's New Slavery for more than 13 years author jose calazzo has been trying to prove that the u.s
[02:53:18.320 --> 02:53:25.040]  Government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology known as fmri
[02:53:25.440 --> 02:53:29.680]  Functional magnetic resonance imaging and there is proof that it exists
[02:53:30.080 --> 02:53:36.640]  America's New Slavery explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security
[02:53:36.640 --> 02:53:42.880]  Who has access to it? How is it being used? Does America's salvation rest in this technology?
[02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:49.840]  These and many other questions are answered in America's New Slavery the new books by jose calazzo

[02:53:52.640 --> 02:53:55.120]  amazon.com and borders.com
[02:53:55.120 --> 02:54:06.560]  America's New Slavery all Americans should be concerned
[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:22.960]  As I said folks
[02:54:23.680 --> 02:54:27.520]  I'll be back tonight 7 o'clock at prison planet dot tv in the new studio
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:30.720]  It's an info or special report not the nightly news report
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:34.640]  But a special report on the aftermath of the stock market plunging dr.
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:38.400]  Pachinic will obviously have you back up to take calls the next few weeks and get into more details
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:44.480]  But what are you getting at with these republican candidates? I mean you're saying that that none of them are that good
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:49.200]  Ron Paul's talked about bringing the troops home from the wars, but I guess you think he's
[02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:52.160]  Doesn't have what it takes
[02:54:52.160 --> 02:54:57.280]  Well, no, I think Ron Paul with all due respect. He's a physician. He's been there 20 years in congress time
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:01.520]  He's talking about libertarian theories, but he's receiving a paycheck every week, you know
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:06.800]  Basically, he lives a lifestyle that contradicts his own statements what I really were looking for
[02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:11.360]  I'm looking for a leader who's coming forth. That's not president of the republican ticket
[02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:13.040]  It's not possible
[02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:17.120]  And I'm addressing this to Fred Malick and Roger Ailes and those who make
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:23.920]  The determination and I'm saying to Fred Malick get rid of Huntsman get rid of Romney and get rid of the rest of the ticket
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:27.040]  I think you should think seriously about recruiting Jeff Bush
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:34.080]  Who's a serious governor unlike his brother? He's a contemplative man. He's had experience. He's been in business
[02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:36.880]  I'm not pushing forth the bush family
[02:55:36.880 --> 02:55:43.040]  And I think of all the elements that jeb is most like his father bush senior the other one that I would think of is
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:49.680]  Patras I think that he has to seriously think about the possibility of running for president because right now
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:55.120]  We have a lacuna of leadership. It's going to get worse. It's compounding worse
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:55:59.120]  You have a president now obama who's willing to cut back on medicare
[02:55:59.120 --> 02:56:03.840]  But has no second thoughts about raising 34 000 dollars within minutes of the time
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:08.480]  He tells the country that we have to sacrifice, but he's not sacrificing in order to
[02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:14.720]  For his own reelection. Yeah, but but I mean doc doc come on. I mean jeb bush
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:22.240]  Obviously not as disingenuous or demonic looking at his brother George Herbert Walker bush. I know you worked on rim and respecting
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:27.840]  But this is all part of the same old political guard that is that that has helped bring America to this point
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:31.280]  I mean he's starting off into a portrayal or something. I don't know enough about him
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:35.200]  Uh, I mean obviously ron paul your ron paul has been there
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:39.760]  Fighting in washington and and standing on his principles
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:45.760]  And and he's been right, you know politically on what he's called for and I know he's turned down pay increases and things
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:49.520]  We'll have to have you back to debate this but I mean
[02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:52.320]  Uh, I mean, I guess you know jeb bush. You like him
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:57.360]  What I'm trying to say is we can break the system and we can change it
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:57:03.760]  But right now the only one who's not in that system and that's within the military industrial complex and understands it
[02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:06.400]  And can do something about it. Maybe betray us
[02:57:06.960 --> 02:57:12.800]  But I'm all I'm saying is right now that we are desperate and we need leadership the republican
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:16.720]  Ticket is not a viable ticket. It's wasting time money
[02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:22.960]  And it's wasting the credibility of a party that right now is basically tried meant
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:29.120]  Uh, the tea party was a good attempt. I think it's it's intense are real
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:35.520]  I don't disagree. Listen every politician is basically disingenuous by the very nature of politics
[02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:40.400]  You have to be egregious. You have to as the polio one said you have to climb the
[02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:45.600]  the sneaky ladder of success and be polite and be
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:51.520]  Uh, affable and then once you get to the top you basically ruthless and authoritarian
[02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:54.240]  That's the nature of the political system
[02:57:54.720 --> 02:58:00.800]  And authoritarian unless we break up the entire government and get rid of 560 representatives
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:06.320]  I don't have a problem with that and devolve the power away from the presidency, but we're not ready for that
[02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:11.520]  By the way, now we've got this creep. Yeah, well now we've got this creepy super congress
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:19.280]  Uh, steve pacinic the website steve pacinic.com doc. Thanks for coming on with us to give us your perspective on the navy seal situation
[02:58:19.360 --> 02:58:24.480]  And the politicians and we'll uh, we'll have you back up again to continue to give us your perspective
[02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:29.840]  Thank you so much. Like I said, I'll be back tonight 7 o'clock prison planet dot tv
[02:58:29.920 --> 02:58:34.000]  We're reworking the site about to launch some new pages and formats very soon
