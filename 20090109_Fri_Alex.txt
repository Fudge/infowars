[00:37.120 --> 00:40.520]  parallels between what happened to Native Americans and what's happening in
[00:40.520 --> 00:45.200]  Gaza I saw a clip of him earlier this week on YouTube which was very accurate
[00:45.200 --> 00:49.800]  because I too have read the official Nazi histories Hitler gave speeches about
[00:49.800 --> 00:56.960]  it wrote about it he got his policies for death camps and rounding up
[00:56.960 --> 01:04.720]  populations non-Aryan groups in Russia and all over Europe from the American
[01:04.720 --> 01:11.640]  Indian program here in the United States and of course that adopted a lot from
[01:11.640 --> 01:18.280]  those that invented it the British the concentration camp it was Andrew Jackson
[01:18.280 --> 01:22.920]  who turned around and did some of the same stuff to Native Americans who lost
[01:22.920 --> 01:27.680]  his mother and brother through a British concentration camp so Russell means
[01:27.680 --> 01:31.360]  is joining us then Bob Chapman for his once a week a visit on the economy and

[02:01.000 --> 02:10.840]  tyranny crusher one bullhorn auctioned on eBay only a couple days into a seven
[02:10.840 --> 02:18.400]  day bid is over $50,000 right now now somebody put in one for five million
[02:18.400 --> 02:22.920]  and then bragged that it was fake we just googled their handle and found out
[02:22.920 --> 02:28.400]  that it was part of a government group government affiliated group laughing
[02:28.400 --> 02:32.280]  openly saying they wanted to screw it up but we just cancelled their bid and
[02:32.280 --> 02:36.200]  it's a legitimate cancellation because we have their own handle their own
[02:36.200 --> 02:41.800]  admission where they're admitting that they are and even posting their bidding
[02:41.800 --> 02:46.280]  details on the web posting the evidence of their felony we went and looked it up
[02:46.280 --> 02:51.140]  and memory told me it was a felony above $10,000 federal in Texas it's above
[02:51.140 --> 02:57.560]  $6,000 for a state felony but I don't know what state this individual's in you
[02:57.560 --> 03:00.040]  can always subpoena those but it looks like we'll be able to handle those
[03:00.040 --> 03:03.400]  problems we've talked to eBay now and they they did say that if these people
[03:03.400 --> 03:10.280]  did succeed that there would be criminal charges so they're not going to be
[03:10.280 --> 03:14.320]  successful in their criminal activities they're admitted criminal
[03:14.320 --> 03:20.440]  activities but they're doing important work of course for cent com so it's it's
[03:20.440 --> 03:26.480]  okay it's alright yeah and if you didn't know that you you've got some cent

[04:41.160 --> 04:46.480]  kick out of that little comment yeah
[04:46.480 --> 04:54.240]  this transmission has just lifted off huge news blitz straight ahead right
[04:54.240 --> 05:01.400]  here on the one the only info wars dot com radio network stay with us hello
[05:01.400 --> 05:05.040]  friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[05:05.040 --> 05:08.120]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[05:08.120 --> 05:11.680]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[05:11.680 --> 05:14.960]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[05:14.960 --> 05:18.800]  dough and beg for female to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[05:18.800 --> 05:22.320]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:22.320 --> 05:25.960]  for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned
[05:25.960 --> 05:29.200]  off the telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty
[05:29.200 --> 05:33.120]  billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the American and
[05:33.120 --> 05:37.320]  European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[05:37.320 --> 05:41.280]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food
[05:41.280 --> 05:45.960]  beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a
[05:45.960 --> 05:49.960]  loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[05:49.960 --> 05:54.200]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[05:54.200 --> 05:58.040]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[05:58.040 --> 06:01.640]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[06:01.640 --> 06:05.800]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[06:05.800 --> 06:09.840]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing it on food one third of Americans
[06:09.840 --> 06:13.520]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[06:13.520 --> 06:17.680]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody
[06:17.680 --> 06:20.600]  out there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a
[06:20.600 --> 06:24.160]  supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot less control
[06:24.160 --> 06:28.400]  over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[06:28.400 --> 06:31.560]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[06:31.560 --> 06:35.560]  you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from
[06:35.560 --> 06:39.480]  E. Coli Salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at

[07:17.320 --> 07:23.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network it really is a central Texas command center
[07:23.680 --> 07:32.840]  now I'm gonna visit family for a few days next week so Jason Burmes is gonna be
[07:32.840 --> 07:37.160]  sitting in some he's down here in the central Texas command center and he's
[07:37.160 --> 07:41.360]  saying man you've got to give people a tour of this place and show them what
[07:41.360 --> 07:47.160]  you did with the support people gave you and you know really we've just been so
[07:47.160 --> 07:56.120]  busy so busy with all the other projects were doing in this Barack Obama film we
[07:56.120 --> 08:02.840]  were up here till about 11 last night and we went and got a hamburger afterwards
[08:02.840 --> 08:09.000]  with Rob's cousin who's down here visiting from New York that was fun but I
[08:09.000 --> 08:17.360]  digress maybe since it's quick and easy and then later we'll do a video tour just
[08:17.360 --> 08:21.160]  take some photos around the new central Texas Command Center kind of a photo
[08:21.160 --> 08:28.040]  tour and then at some point I need to walk around with a camera in here and
[08:28.040 --> 08:32.560]  you know videotape the place and put it out for the viewers out there at
[08:32.560 --> 08:38.960]  prisonplanet.tv so they can check out the command center but we're in the next
[08:38.960 --> 08:43.480]  phase trying to expand our operations and so we're so busy that it's hard to
[08:43.480 --> 08:50.440]  get around to that but we will we will do it that is a guarantee if the creek
[08:50.440 --> 08:58.320]  don't rise as they say yeah I usually get about 6.37 in the morning I slept
[08:58.320 --> 09:01.320]  till about nine o'clock this morning because I didn't get home till about one
[09:01.320 --> 09:08.360]  and I'm here with this huge stack of news in front of me and I'm actually in a
[09:08.360 --> 09:14.680]  relaxed mood which is rare I mean I'm normally relaxed well I'm not on air
[09:14.680 --> 09:18.720]  but for some reason I've gotten the habit over the years I guess when I first
[09:18.720 --> 09:22.960]  got on radio it was so exciting that I was you just exploded with information
[09:22.960 --> 09:27.320]  that I would get into this overdriven mode and that became the precedent but
[09:27.320 --> 09:30.720]  right now I'm feeling like my normal self and I don't even know where to start
[09:30.720 --> 09:36.560]  because I have all the serious news and I almost hate to plow through it all and
[09:36.560 --> 09:41.800]  bum my happy vibe as they say but we won't have a free society we won't have
[09:41.800 --> 09:45.760]  any future if we let the criminals come in and eat us out of house and home in
[09:45.760 --> 09:50.080]  our societies that's the whole point about corruption it must be stopped it
[09:50.080 --> 09:57.240]  must be resisted really serious news on the financial front this is UBS closing
[09:57.240 --> 10:05.360]  U.S. clients offshore accounts New York Times reports and this is a Reuters story
[10:05.360 --> 10:10.480]  itself under pressure from the U.S. Tax Authority Swiss wealth management giant
[10:10.480 --> 10:16.080]  UBS is closing all the offshore accounts of its rich U.S. clients the
[10:16.080 --> 10:19.680]  New York Times said Friday now what's happened is the really big money's
[10:19.680 --> 10:24.160]  moved offshore the get out of the United States date I've been told and read
[10:24.160 --> 10:28.800]  about was about two years ago and they've moved their money to move by
[10:28.800 --> 10:37.400]  they've moved their money to Dubai they've moved their money to Luxembourg
[10:37.400 --> 10:41.480]  they've moved their money to the Bahamas they've moved their money to
[10:41.480 --> 10:48.120]  Portugal they've moved their money and then you have the OECD the with the
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.280]  Organization of Economic Cooperative Development that was the name of the
[10:51.280 --> 10:57.840]  official the official name of the of the Marshall Plan in Europe and now it's
[10:57.840 --> 11:02.160]  this international management consortium that really sets a lot of the policies
[11:02.160 --> 11:06.040]  for the private IMF World Bank International Bank of Settlements and
[11:06.040 --> 11:09.360]  others and they're the ones have been pushing for decades to quote get rid of
[11:09.360 --> 11:15.560]  tax havens but they only get rid of select quote tax avoidance havens and
[11:15.560 --> 11:20.440]  they only go after the smaller fish people with a million two million five
[11:20.440 --> 11:25.280]  million a hundred million even a billion if they're not in the inner circle of
[11:25.280 --> 11:30.320]  elitist so this is all about selective enforcement the big trillionaires of the
[11:30.320 --> 11:34.680]  world the the the the the super the superclass the handful of families that
[11:34.680 --> 11:39.040]  control trillions Rothschild's Rockefellers they use governmental taxing
[11:39.040 --> 11:45.520]  authorities to come in and suck the middle class and the new barish and the
[11:45.520 --> 11:52.120]  upstart super rich dry through taxation it come you see these reports all the
[11:52.120 --> 11:57.160]  time where Goldman Sachs paid less than 1% taxes that was in the New York Times
[11:57.160 --> 12:00.960]  in the United States because they're offshore and they've written all the
[12:00.960 --> 12:06.400]  federal international laws where it's allowed it's it's it's kosher for them
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.800]  to do that but nobody else except for that small superclass and so that's all
[12:11.800 --> 12:17.400]  this is is nowhere to run nowhere to hide unless you're a select group allowed
[12:17.400 --> 12:22.440]  to go into the bank accounts in other areas of the world so this is a robbing
[12:22.440 --> 12:30.920]  of the middle class a robbing of the new barish and some upstart super rich the
[12:30.920 --> 12:39.080]  looting UBS which the US authorities say helped wealthy Americans hide cash in
[12:39.080 --> 12:43.960]  offshore bank accounts will shut down 19,000 offshore accounts the paper said
[12:43.960 --> 12:48.080]  quoting unnamed US clients a UBS spokesman in Switzerland was not immediately
[12:48.080 --> 12:51.360]  available to comment on the report the Swiss bank one of the hardest hit in the
[12:51.360 --> 12:55.800]  credit crisis decided in July last year to stop offering offshore accounts to
[12:55.800 --> 13:00.240]  US citizens as it was targeted by US tax investigation which challenges
[13:00.240 --> 13:06.240]  Switzerland's famous banking secrecy laws really what happened is the Swiss
[13:06.240 --> 13:10.720]  joined the European Union a few years ago and they have agreed to phase out
[13:10.720 --> 13:14.640]  their own currency and their gold back system so it's over for them they're
[13:14.640 --> 13:18.680]  being absorbed by the board as part of the investigation US authorities
[13:18.680 --> 13:24.640]  indicted UBS's wealth management chief last year UBS is progressing with its
[13:24.640 --> 13:31.360]  closing in ordinary fashion UBS spokesman Karina Bern was quoted as saying
[13:31.360 --> 13:37.480]  in the US paper and it says it helped US clients hide 18 billion of untaxed
[13:37.480 --> 13:41.160]  American money I mean I mean they're globalists that are making 18 billion a
[13:41.160 --> 13:45.400]  day folks see what but they love these illusions and these giant hoaxes that
[13:45.400 --> 13:49.680]  Bill Gates is the richest man in the world Bill Gates his father who headed
[13:49.680 --> 13:54.320]  up Planned Parenthood is still on their board I was tied in with IBM eugenics
[13:54.320 --> 14:02.320]  operations IBM is a trust when the old man died in the was it late 40s set up a
[14:02.320 --> 14:07.240]  trust that IBM be kept be used to carry out a setting up a world state to carry
[14:07.240 --> 14:14.800]  out eugenics and that's on record and again around trust laws and those are
[14:14.800 --> 14:20.600]  still being somewhat enforced I'm digressing look I've covered one article
[14:20.600 --> 14:25.880]  here and I've probably got 50 or 60 important ones it's just all a giant
[14:25.880 --> 14:30.720]  stinking fraud and so he was set up as the IBM frontman IBM has thousands of
[14:30.720 --> 14:38.920]  fronts that we know of so there you go ladies and gentlemen a lot of these low
[14:38.920 --> 14:43.240]  level government people and bureaucrats and corporate shills you don't get to
[14:43.240 --> 14:47.320]  keep your money and the general that you stole many of you or that you earned
[14:47.320 --> 14:51.040]  and and and then many of course the mainline middle class that may have a
[14:51.040 --> 14:54.720]  half million dollars saved after 34 years of working well you're just gonna
[14:54.720 --> 14:58.360]  lose all that value too that's what this is about you think the elites are gonna
[14:58.360 --> 15:01.920]  just let you invest in the system and they were not gonna steal from you you
[15:01.920 --> 15:07.800]  think they're setting up FEMA camps and Northcom command because they want to give
[15:07.800 --> 15:13.360]  you a pedicure or you know they want to wash your rock and roll hair because they
[15:13.360 --> 15:18.920]  care about your bling and you and your escalade they'd like to see you dead you
[15:18.920 --> 15:26.400]  understand that Henry Paulson's a big eugenicist heading up a bunch of land
[15:26.400 --> 15:30.360]  grabbing operations he's a human hater openly calls for population reduction
[15:30.360 --> 15:36.720]  I mean just there that this is sick group so again all of you that think you're
[15:36.720 --> 15:40.760]  part of the system just get ready get ready because they're gonna work you
[15:40.760 --> 15:44.400]  over and they're not gonna stop until you stand up against them you understand
[15:44.400 --> 15:48.640]  they'll push you all the way to the wall and past it if you keep sitting there
[15:48.640 --> 15:53.600]  with your thumb in your little mouth sucking on it and acting all elitist all

[16:02.360 --> 16:07.400]  places like Dallas and Houston and Long Island and LA and I mean there's
[16:07.400 --> 16:10.240]  communities up everywhere who think they're gods and think they're the elite
[16:10.240 --> 16:14.720]  get ready the elite is gonna take everything you've got and then probably
[16:14.720 --> 16:17.720]  shove a gun in the back of your head and splatter your brains down into a pit
[16:17.720 --> 16:22.600]  before they kick you into it the last thing you'll do before you die is crap
[16:22.600 --> 16:31.640]  yourselves Bill Gross we've got a Ponzi style economy Bill Gross is managing
[16:31.640 --> 16:38.360]  director of the world's largest bond fund PIMCO which manages some 790 billion

[23:41.160 --> 23:44.840]  town I want to get him back for a full hour and we try to go over his whole
[23:44.840 --> 23:49.920]  bio would take hours he's well known for being a lot of big Hollywood movies but
[23:49.920 --> 23:53.480]  he's more proud of the fact that he's been one of the main leaders the
[23:53.480 --> 23:59.000]  American Indian movement and of course as a writer and involved in a lot of
[23:59.000 --> 24:04.760]  other important work he was born on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation both his
[24:04.760 --> 24:12.600]  parents have been educated in government reeducation camps and he of
[24:12.600 --> 24:24.560]  course is trying to get the people around the Dakotas area to secede not from
[24:24.560 --> 24:28.680]  the US it's now totally New World Order it's not even the United States it's
[24:28.680 --> 24:32.800]  this global empire that's taken over even the little empire that was called
[24:32.800 --> 24:36.840]  the United States here and that's got international attention they've had some
[24:36.840 --> 24:40.880]  success but I saw on his YouTube channel a few days ago and it was very
[24:40.880 --> 24:44.400]  touching where he was laying out because I've studied the history as well the
[24:44.400 --> 24:48.160]  fact that well really what happened is the British invented concentration
[24:48.160 --> 24:54.800]  camps Andrew Jackson's who then put Native Americans in camps himself his
[24:54.800 --> 24:59.680]  mother and his brother died in a British concentration camp during the
[24:59.680 --> 25:03.320]  Revolutionary War so the British invented it they actually did it to the
[25:03.320 --> 25:07.560]  Scots first you see some similar things in the movie Braveheart that's somewhat
[25:07.560 --> 25:10.600]  historical so people are always doing this to their neighbors this is what
[25:10.600 --> 25:14.320]  happens to the more technological groups come in and dominate and kill and they
[25:14.320 --> 25:17.720]  ties it in with Hitler who bragged that he learned everything he knew off the
[25:17.720 --> 25:23.920]  American Indian model with what the army did especially out west but also in
[25:23.920 --> 25:30.280]  the east and Israel Braggs and I had the Ray McGovern top CIA former officer on
[25:30.280 --> 25:33.840]  saying he's been in Israel with him bragging hey we're using your American
[25:33.840 --> 25:37.200]  Indian model what's wrong with this so it's on record that's what's happening
[25:37.200 --> 25:43.520]  so Russell means it's good to have you back on with us thank you great to be
[25:43.520 --> 25:51.000]  with you go ahead you've got the floor start breaking down the parallels here
[25:51.000 --> 25:57.680]  well first of all I want to I know that people listen to your show quite
[25:57.680 --> 26:04.280]  regularly and they heard me back last year when you had me in on after we had
[26:04.280 --> 26:10.000]  just withdrew we didn't succeed we withdrew from the our treaties with the
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.600]  United States of America and re-established our free and independent
[26:14.600 --> 26:21.440]  Republic the Republic of La Jota and as an update on the Republic of La Jota is
[26:21.440 --> 26:30.240]  that number one we have we have devised four strategies for the rebuilding of
[26:30.240 --> 26:38.960]  the foundation of our Republic and that's politics health education and
[26:38.960 --> 26:45.240]  economics and economics as we all know is those that control the energy control
[26:45.240 --> 26:53.480]  the economics we live the republic of La Jota which also goes into two states
[26:53.480 --> 27:00.040]  of Dakota that and that part of Dakota is is called by the experts the Saudi
[27:00.040 --> 27:08.360]  Arabia of wind energy and of course the coal companies hold hostage the energy
[27:08.360 --> 27:13.920]  in the west consequently you have to give permission from them if you want to
[27:13.920 --> 27:20.960]  put up a windmill however we're going to build our own grid and where we begin
[27:20.960 --> 27:27.240]  our endeavors and we've started that already in the republic as a single
[27:27.240 --> 27:35.680]  house windmill independence and community independence from with windmills
[27:35.680 --> 27:42.760]  wind turbines excuse me wind turbines will allow our communities to be free
[27:42.760 --> 27:49.840]  and because of that investors will be drawn to the Republic of La Jota to
[27:49.840 --> 27:56.720]  invest in building our own grid which we can then mother in with the other
[27:56.720 --> 28:05.440]  grids but we control our own grids and costs and profits that is one of the
[28:05.440 --> 28:10.120]  endeavors we're doing the other endeavor is to be putting up working with the
[28:10.120 --> 28:16.320]  international community and international corporations we are going to be
[28:16.320 --> 28:24.520]  putting in a computer calling center that is going to be expanding and within
[28:24.520 --> 28:32.240]  five to six years to a six hundred million dollar a year operation and so
[28:32.240 --> 28:36.640]  far as our health is concerned we're bringing in naturopathic doctors as
[28:36.640 --> 28:44.600]  well as MDs from different parts of the world we are presently arranging
[28:44.600 --> 28:50.680]  medical training for Indian students who are not allowed or into medical schools
[28:50.680 --> 28:56.000]  or once they get in there they're okay stay there we got a break Russell means

[32:41.000 --> 33:00.760]  The days are bright and filled with pain and close me in your gentle rain the time you
[33:00.760 --> 33:11.480]  ran one, two and so will you. I've promised that Russell means on for a full hour if he can do it.
[33:11.480 --> 33:17.440]  We've talked about since last time we had him on eight, nine months ago the progress of their
[33:17.440 --> 33:21.160]  withdrawal they're canceling of treaties that have never been followed he's right
[33:21.160 --> 33:26.280]  it's not a secession glad he corrected me on that technical point but I want to
[33:26.280 --> 33:29.640]  shift gears and the time we have left with him on the parallels between what's
[33:29.640 --> 33:35.320]  happening with the Gazans because they're dead and dying right now Gaza children found with
[33:35.320 --> 33:39.920]  mother's corpses the New York Times the International Committee of the Red Cross
[33:39.920 --> 33:43.800]  said Thursday it had discovered shocking scenes including small children next to
[33:43.800 --> 33:48.680]  their mother's corpses well at least with wounded knee they killed all the kids too
[33:48.680 --> 33:53.640]  when its representatives gained access for the first time to parts of Gaza battered by
[33:53.640 --> 33:59.240]  Israeli shelling it accused Israel of failing to meet obligations to care for the wounded in
[33:59.240 --> 34:05.320]  the combat area so Israel founded Hamas that's on the record people keep emailing me saying
[34:05.320 --> 34:09.960]  it's not true they founded it to counter the PLO that's on record so they didn't want a main
[34:09.960 --> 34:15.960]  line secular groups that's why they overthrew Saddam they want radicalized groups so that
[34:15.960 --> 34:20.920]  they'll fight back with their sticks and stones and so they have a pretext to come in and slaughter
[34:20.920 --> 34:25.720]  them but then the argument is well then they're just putting camps and again you know basically
[34:25.720 --> 34:30.360]  their wells are poisoned so what's the point there and that's why the other groups say let's
[34:30.360 --> 34:34.280]  go ahead and fight last Russell means his take on that he's certainly been involved fighting
[34:35.400 --> 34:40.760]  and Pat Buchanan says Israel turning Gaza into a concentration camp then the MSNBC jumped on him
[34:40.760 --> 34:44.840]  and said how dare you compare this to Hitler and he said hey the British invented concentration
[34:44.840 --> 34:51.960]  camps I didn't say death camp but it is a death camp also Obama saying to face Iran nuclear crisis
[34:51.960 --> 34:57.320]  in the first year they Israel saying Obama saying they may attack Iran you and accuses Israel of
[34:57.320 --> 35:02.920]  hurting 110 Palestinians into a house and then shelling it leaving 30 dead there's scores of
[35:02.920 --> 35:08.040]  witnesses and survivors Russell means that's just some of what we've got today as I go over that news
[35:08.840 --> 35:13.640]  with your perspective on this sir because Israel is saying they learned this from the
[35:13.640 --> 35:22.040]  United States and is saying hey you did this to your Native Americans why not well first of all it's
[35:22.040 --> 35:29.720]  just it's a caveman mentality all this violence you know the United States every patriarchal regime
[35:29.720 --> 35:37.080]  in the past over 6,000 years of patriarchy has been in existence has made the same mistake
[35:37.080 --> 35:45.800]  over and over and over again patriarchy is a fear-based society that because it's fear-based
[35:45.800 --> 35:52.760]  it believes that it's always under attack the individual patriarch and his holdings therefore
[35:52.760 --> 35:59.960]  he has the caveman mentality of settling misunderstandings with the club albeit as time
[35:59.960 --> 36:06.680]  marches on they are more sophisticated than technological clubs their clubs nevertheless
[36:06.680 --> 36:13.000]  and the mentality never changes so when you see these these attacks on innocent people
[36:13.800 --> 36:20.840]  I don't care throughout history but specifically now because the United States empire and the in
[36:20.840 --> 36:31.320]  fact the entire money system is collapsing as we speak you'll see them revert to this caveman
[36:31.320 --> 36:38.040]  mentality that's why I've always said we have to take an honest and truthful look at patriarchy
[36:38.040 --> 36:46.760]  and come up with another way of not allowing men to be solely in charge because they blow it
[36:46.760 --> 36:52.280]  every time what happened to the roman empire is now happening to the american empire and
[36:53.000 --> 37:00.520]  the industrial empire around the world for instance if china and saudi arabia were called
[37:00.520 --> 37:07.000]  into treasury notes that they've bought from the u.s so they could bankload their their wars
[37:08.680 --> 37:15.960]  america would go broke which would go bankrupt right away they cannot pay up their obligations
[37:16.760 --> 37:23.160]  the fact that the banking system and now that the queen of england is broke she used to be the
[37:23.160 --> 37:31.080]  richest along with the Rothschilds and the building burgers syndicate and the trilateral commission
[37:31.080 --> 37:40.200]  members all of those people are now and the world is collapsing so it's going to be everything we've
[37:40.200 --> 37:49.560]  feared everything those uh i forgot the survivalists back in the 70s and 80s were doing when they
[37:49.560 --> 37:57.400]  were training and doing all sorts of all sorts of idiotic things out of fear they were pressing
[37:57.400 --> 38:05.800]  might become true you've got you've got the united states of america buying its own money
[38:06.360 --> 38:13.800]  from the fed the truth it it blows my mind that we as a people are so stupid i call that
[38:13.800 --> 38:23.000]  paying to be a uh a rustle i call that paying to be a slave right um but here's what mayer
[38:23.000 --> 38:35.800]  rothschild said back in the 70s uh um 1700s he said um let me see i'm trying to find it
[38:35.800 --> 38:46.600]  oh i said here he is give me control of a nation's money and i care not who makes her laws
[38:48.520 --> 38:57.480]  that's rothschild now the rothschild um banking system is what gave birth to all banking systems
[38:57.480 --> 39:07.240]  and now they're all one so uh that's why now with obama in there and he just said a couple of days
[39:07.240 --> 39:13.400]  ago in his news conference that over trillion dollar deficits will be here for years to come
[39:14.840 --> 39:21.560]  printing phony money it's going to eventually and the sooner the better that this collapse
[39:21.560 --> 39:29.400]  happens so that we can face reality and and get on with life but to to strangle us to death like
[39:29.400 --> 39:37.800]  they're doing with their greed and their their uh monetizing everything they monetize prisoners
[39:37.800 --> 39:45.400]  in prison they've monetized every entity do you know that the reservations the the indian
[39:45.400 --> 39:53.000]  concentration camps are monetized yes look on done done in brad street uh russle i would
[39:53.000 --> 39:59.160]  tell people this 10 years ago uh or longer that that that they had bonds that they were selling
[39:59.880 --> 40:07.160]  uh derivatives on the people in the prisons that they have bonds on the number of children's cps
[40:07.160 --> 40:11.400]  now native americans went through this first millions of native children taken many times
[40:11.400 --> 40:17.640]  killed sterilized now they're doing that to the white children uh and suddenly you know whites
[40:17.640 --> 40:24.840]  are upset about it because uh again now this predatory system isn't even so much racially based
[40:24.840 --> 40:29.720]  it's money based by this international elite and they are just savaging everyone
[40:29.720 --> 40:41.480]  oh yes and and but what gets me it's it's in in their uh bookkeeping um if they call it that
[40:41.480 --> 40:49.400]  they call it quasi money all this value uh brought out of thin air and it's and they put it into
[40:49.400 --> 40:58.200]  financial packages and it's not based on anything real real fraud and imaginary value and yet they
[40:58.200 --> 41:03.000]  sell it around the world in these derivative packages and other financial packages exactly
[41:03.000 --> 41:10.120]  i mean at least i mean at least the fat you the the the glass bead wampum had some visual value
[41:10.120 --> 41:15.320]  but was still a scam to sell new york now they just show you an empty box and say look at how
[41:15.320 --> 41:20.120]  beautiful it is and we sell our whole souls sell our future so people make fun of the
[41:20.120 --> 41:24.760]  native americans you know you're buying the pretty blue and red glass beads and nails and knives and
[41:24.760 --> 41:33.080]  haircombs uh but i mean we've sold our souls for nothing that's exactly right and and you know
[41:33.080 --> 41:41.640]  the united states utilizing israel as their shock troops in the middle east that is so pathetic of
[41:41.640 --> 41:52.120]  never understood that is soon as there's a scarcity of a natural um uh some natural resource
[41:52.120 --> 41:58.840]  they go military they start the bombing and and the uh they taking the prisoners and the
[41:58.840 --> 42:08.200]  slaughters and all of that only because of the scarcity of a natural resource it is
[42:09.400 --> 42:18.040]  instead of creating trade instead of but it doesn't it doesn't change with patriarchy that's the sad
[42:18.040 --> 42:24.920]  part and that's the dangerous part to our very existence well it continues well rustle there's
[42:24.920 --> 42:30.840]  a quote i saw on youtube by a famous chief isn't it can you can can you give us that quote you got
[42:30.840 --> 42:37.400]  memorized yes that's what just before chief seattle and the suquamish people of the suquamish
[42:37.400 --> 42:44.840]  nation in and around the state of uh washington just before they were marched off from their
[42:44.840 --> 42:54.120]  homeland to uh a concentration camp slash reservation he gave a speech and in that speech and in part
[42:54.120 --> 43:01.800]  he said you're he was talking to the commissioners from the treaty commissioners from the white the
[43:02.280 --> 43:09.880]  from washington dc the government he said your time of decay may be distant it's like the waves of
[43:09.880 --> 43:18.840]  the sea it is the order of nature and regret is useless your time of decay may be distant but it
[43:18.840 --> 43:26.280]  will surely come for even the white man's god who walked and talked with him as friend with friend
[43:26.280 --> 43:33.320]  could not escape our common destiny we may be brothers after all we shall see
[43:33.320 --> 43:41.240]  shall see as chief seattle what a prescient statement understanding that the very evil
[43:41.240 --> 43:47.400]  you're carrying out is going to come back and bite you in the bud there you go and that uh
[43:47.400 --> 43:52.920]  what goes around comes around that we're going to be we're going to be brothers in in being murdered
[43:52.920 --> 44:04.760]  and enslaved it's exactly and it's uh it's it's sad that when uh kerry and i have uh no respect
[44:04.760 --> 44:13.000]  for kerry the former uh presidential candidate the democratic center when he was caught saying
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.240]  words to the effect that if you're poor you're going to end up in the rock
[44:17.240 --> 44:26.040]  and uh words to that effect and he was chastised that by the national media and forced to apologize
[44:26.600 --> 44:33.960]  but he's virtually correct as long as they can keep federal control of the schools and dumbing
[44:33.960 --> 44:41.800]  down america and keep you so dumb that and poor that you'll you'll be willing to risk your life
[44:41.800 --> 44:48.280]  for a few crummy dollars that aren't worth anything anyway well i mean the public schooling as we know
[44:48.280 --> 44:55.560]  it uh with the with the you know the reeducation the shaved heads the control the the federal public
[44:55.560 --> 45:01.720]  schooling began for natives why don't you briefly explain the what the reservation system what the
[45:01.720 --> 45:06.680]  boarding schools really were and that's what our public schools with fences and drug dogs and
[45:06.680 --> 45:12.520]  zero tolerance are turning into and tie that in as you did eloquently to uh you know to the
[45:12.520 --> 45:16.680]  native american experience and and again israel saying they're carrying that out now against
[45:16.680 --> 45:24.200]  the palestinians exactly every policy and that's why i say the american people are the american
[45:24.200 --> 45:33.240]  indians of the 21st century because everything that the united states does has been bred and born
[45:33.240 --> 45:39.800]  and practiced on an indian reservation before exported to the world and now it's been brought home
[45:39.800 --> 45:47.720]  to roost on the backs of the american people all these policies health education land policies
[45:48.520 --> 45:53.320]  don't you think this credit crunch is getting rid of the family farmers and family ranches they are
[45:53.320 --> 46:01.240]  the backbone of america and yet uh we're allowing that to happen because this credit crunch that's
[46:01.240 --> 46:07.160]  all farms and ranches family ranches and family farms run on so consequently they're going to be
[46:07.160 --> 46:12.280]  squeezed out and the corporate farming is coming in i don't care right wing socialism
[46:13.240 --> 46:19.080]  eventually comes around and meets left wing socialism it's one and the same it's just a
[46:19.080 --> 46:25.560]  different application and and and priority of spending now it's really just domesticating and
[46:25.560 --> 46:30.040]  they claim it's socialism but it's only so big corporations get control and then say here's
[46:30.040 --> 46:35.880]  socialism have a poison blanket you'll have a have a smallpox blanket now it's have a have a
[46:35.880 --> 46:43.000]  mmr shot full of cancer viruses very very definitely yes and the boarding school system
[46:43.000 --> 46:50.040]  instituted upon my parents and and and the indian people up into and still there's some boarding
[46:50.040 --> 46:55.400]  schools going on in america today with indian sir as you know it just came out a few years ago in
[46:55.400 --> 47:02.280]  canada that they're killing the the the the native americans up there and sterilizing still
[47:03.560 --> 47:07.480]  exactly and you know in a four-year period in the 70s
[47:07.480 --> 47:11.400]  that the federal government was caught by the american union movement
[47:11.400 --> 47:18.680]  and a woman by the name of dr conny yeary uh sterilizing 42 percent of american union women
[47:18.680 --> 47:25.320]  in that four-year period of child bearing age unbelievable 42 percent at the same time they did
[47:25.320 --> 47:36.520]  35 percent of porto rican women in porto rico so uh this is the policy america has fostered on
[47:36.520 --> 47:44.520]  americans and now everybody's getting that why is it the uh the populations are going these
[47:44.520 --> 47:54.120]  manufactured uh flues forcing us to take flu shots um and now you know we were just absolute
[47:54.120 --> 48:01.560]  slaves with that birth certificate and social security card now well that's why i know you
[48:01.560 --> 48:06.600]  are succeeding and i hope you succeed big time so there is a place to go to when everything
[48:06.600 --> 48:11.400]  collapses uh but then we know they'll probably just bring military in but you guys will have
[48:11.400 --> 48:16.520]  a legal right if they try to get violent to say no because you know you're allowed to pull out of
[48:16.520 --> 48:23.560]  a treaty that's been broken right but there are other countries that are that are not
[48:24.600 --> 48:34.280]  wholly a part of the imf system the world bank system of uh finance and those countries like
[48:34.280 --> 48:45.080]  russia uh those countries and others um that are not part of the banking system the whole
[48:45.080 --> 48:52.200]  heartedly in the world are going to have something to say as the united states continues to disintegrate
[48:53.160 --> 48:59.640]  and and become part and parcel of the united nations you know well why they hang on to the
[48:59.640 --> 49:08.120]  united nations and another reason is uh they did that's where they've been shunted their empire has
[49:08.120 --> 49:15.080]  been shunted into the united nations it's not just decay these worms of corruptions you know before
[49:15.080 --> 49:19.960]  they would at least try to keep the host alive they got so greedy and so evil they now basically
[49:19.960 --> 49:31.480]  have killed the host and it and all exactly you know as much as uh unions have been vilified they
[49:31.480 --> 49:37.880]  were the first to see what was happening and no one listened to them they said as soon as they
[49:38.840 --> 49:45.640]  you know the the powers that be in the fine and wall street and uh and other places they financial
[49:45.640 --> 49:51.880]  places they they're the ones who emptied out america we have nothing to fall back on nothing
[49:51.880 --> 49:56.520]  just as they did the native americans it's for total control stay there russle means again
[49:56.520 --> 50:02.840]  they want you broke back they want you controlled institutionalized in the modern reservation slash
[50:02.840 --> 50:08.200]  plantations but now they're entering a new phase they just want to exterminate 80 percent of us

[53:23.880 --> 53:30.760]  and to the edges of what is israel today and then when they're under siege they try to respond
[53:30.760 --> 53:35.800]  as a bargaining chip with these rockets and israel broke the broke the ceasefire bombing them
[53:36.440 --> 53:40.680]  and our media just lies because it isn't our media it's a globalist corporate media we're
[53:40.680 --> 53:45.080]  going to have rustle means one of the chief leaders of the native american movement here in the
[53:45.080 --> 53:48.280]  united states back on in the near future in the four minutes we've got left sir
[53:48.280 --> 53:54.600]  uh you know predictions foresight for what's going into this year will this in a way be a
[53:54.600 --> 53:58.680]  purifying experience going into depression and then give out some of the websites for folks
[53:58.680 --> 54:05.640]  that want to check out more of you the operation you guys are engaged in as you have withdrawn
[54:05.640 --> 54:13.480]  from the united states fraudulent treaties yes i have first of all the
[54:13.480 --> 54:22.600]  uh the what's going to happen in the forthcoming years and because we're not coming out of this
[54:23.480 --> 54:30.680]  is the united states of america under obama is going to continue to try to hang on by their
[54:30.680 --> 54:41.080]  fingernails um to their quasi power by printing phony money and eventually we're going to end
[54:41.080 --> 54:50.200]  up like germany did after world war one and that is we're going to take a wheelbarrow full
[54:50.840 --> 54:57.800]  of paper money to buy a loaf of bread that actually happened in germany and it's going
[54:57.800 --> 55:07.000]  to happen here you cannot continually cheapen the money without the house of cards falling down on
[55:07.000 --> 55:12.280]  you and that's exactly what's going to be happening and it's just going to get worse
[55:12.280 --> 55:20.680]  they're not going to really look at obama's plan and it's not about the people it's only
[55:21.320 --> 55:29.400]  about strengthening the the already failing business system you can't have a consumer
[55:29.400 --> 55:38.680]  society when the consumers have no money it's idiotic it's insanity obama and his henchmen
[55:39.240 --> 55:47.880]  and women are insane and that's all there is to it men patriarchs are insane well there's an eye
[55:47.880 --> 55:58.440]  my websites are republicoflakota.com and russellmeansfreedom.com
[55:59.000 --> 56:06.200]  russellmeansfreedom.com and republicoflakota.com and for those that don't know how to spell
[56:06.200 --> 56:17.800]  a hotel you would you spell that for people please sir well lakota is spelled a-l-a-k-o-t-a-h you can
[56:17.800 --> 56:25.640]  spell it without an h or with an h but a-l-a-k-o-t-a-h and i promise sir you'll do it we'll have you
[56:25.640 --> 56:32.680]  back up in the near future to go more into obama and separately more into what you sovereign folks
[56:32.680 --> 56:40.360]  are doing out there in your area of the lower 48 with those four states that are clearly your land
[56:40.360 --> 56:44.920]  and glad to see what you're doing out there because the united states doesn't even exist anymore
[56:44.920 --> 56:50.440]  where a holding of the internationalist that was the final caveat i would add is that just like
[56:50.440 --> 56:54.760]  germany also had a precise treaty we're being blamed for the economic collapse when it's international
[56:54.760 --> 56:59.960]  is running and they're going to seize all our infrastructure and give it to offshore corporations
[56:59.960 --> 57:03.800]  that engineered all this to begin with so there's also going to be an acceleration of looting

[59:44.600 --> 59:49.960]  info wars dot com and prisonplanet dot com but i wanted to play part of a russia today interview
[59:49.960 --> 59:55.000]  with peter schiff where he really boils it down and likens the collapse of the united states that's
[59:55.000 --> 1:00:00.440]  coming to what happened to the old soviet union remember though this is all orchestrated and
[1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:03.880]  engineered and we have the documents that's something that unfortunately mr schiff and
[1:00:03.880 --> 1:00:08.760]  mr means and others i don't think understand but we'll talk more about that with bob chapman
[1:00:08.760 --> 1:00:13.720]  straight ahead here is peter schiff on russia today buying trillions and trillions of dollars
[1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:18.840]  of government debt and the dollars is going to implode nobody is going to want it not even americans
[1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:24.040]  when the dollar implodes what does it mean for americans living in this country consuming with
[1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:27.400]  the dollar well they're not going to be consuming anymore i mean because the dollar's not going to
[1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:32.280]  buy anything remember the only reason we're able to buy stuff now is because foreigners will send
[1:00:32.280 --> 1:00:36.680]  us all the stuff they make in exchange for our dollars when they don't want our dollars anymore
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:41.320]  we're not going to get their stuff and we don't have the factories to produce the stuff ourselves
[1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:45.160]  and so we're going to have a bunch of money but we're not going to buy anything we're talking
[1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:50.680]  bread lines i mean well if the government imposes price controls which is something i think is coming
[1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:56.680]  i think under the obama administration inflation is going to get so bad that i believe the government
[1:00:56.680 --> 1:01:02.600]  is going to you know follow the misguided footsteps of the nixon and impose price controls on various
[1:01:02.600 --> 1:01:08.120]  consumer goods including food items energy items and if we do that yes there'll be long lines for
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:12.440]  everything and and people will start trading on the black market if you want to buy something you
[1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:16.280]  won't be able to buy it officially you'll have to buy it in the black market and what will the black
[1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:22.680]  market currency be will it be the euro will it be uh silver coins uh what will americans be trading
[1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:27.480]  in illegally uh to try to procure the things that they need because we are on a collision course
[1:01:28.120 --> 1:01:34.200]  for massive inflation so what do people do to prepare for honestly the doom and gloom that
[1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:38.520]  you're describing right now what individual americans need to understand is if they've got
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:43.320]  dollars invested in in government bonds and municipal bonds and treasuries if they've got
[1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:48.680]  insurance if they've got cash value and they've got bank accounts they've got cds all that wealth
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:54.200]  is going to be wiped out unless they act quickly to get out of us dollars and to move their wealth
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:59.640]  into foreign currencies into bonds issued by foreign governments or foreign corporations
[1:01:59.640 --> 1:02:04.840]  that they can buy stocks common stocks traded in foreign markets but where the incomes and dividends
[1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:09.080]  are paid in foreign currencies they can buy precious metals they can buy gold and silver they can buy
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:13.480]  other commodities but people need to act quickly to get out of us dollars before the dollars lose
[1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:19.080]  their value the fact the us is in such a weak position right now because of the economy do you
[1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:25.240]  think that this could have an effect on its position when it comes to foreign policy oh no
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:30.200]  doubt i mean america is going to lose its role as a dominant player in the global economy whether
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:35.000]  it's economically whether it's militarily i mean you know i mean at one point right the the soviet
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:41.320]  union was this giant superpower but ultimately it collapsed because it couldn't finance it anymore
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:48.520]  because it never really had the economy and and once it could no longer support the empire it
[1:02:48.520 --> 1:02:54.280]  collapsed around it and it was very quick i mean the soviet union was reduced to to practically
[1:02:54.280 --> 1:02:58.920]  nothing in just a short period of time and and you know people wouldn't even believe that it was
[1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:04.520]  possible i think you have a similar situation where the united states our entire military presence
[1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:09.480]  around the world could come to a very abrupt end when we can no longer afford to support the empire
[1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:13.880]  i mean we only can afford to support it now because of the overvalued dollar and the fact that we're
[1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:18.280]  able to borrow so much money from the rest of the world but i think once uh you know the dollar
[1:03:18.280 --> 1:03:24.040]  collapses our military might is going to follow our economic might and we're going to be increasingly
[1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:28.920]  marginalized we're still living off of the reputation that we once had and we're still
[1:03:28.920 --> 1:03:33.720]  squandering the wealth that was handed to us by our grandparents instead of really creating
[1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:38.520]  the new wealth the new wealth creation is taking place outside the united states is taking place
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:44.200]  in asia and i think as america falls from grace you're going to see new economic powers born
[1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:50.360]  and i think as the american consumer dies you're going to see consumers in asia born and you know
[1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:54.120]  that's one of the the main points that i've been trying to make over the last several years and
[1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:59.160]  people don't seem to get it is that the united states has not been the engine of the global economy
[1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:03.880]  we've been the caboose and the rest of the world has been dragging us around like we're dead weight
[1:04:08.920 --> 1:04:12.840]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:17.080]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:21.560]  and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:26.280]  never have to go to the super dome and beg for femur to take care of your family in any emergency
[1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:30.680]  if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special
[1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:35.080]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email
[1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:39.880]  they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now
[1:04:39.880 --> 1:04:45.000]  owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:50.520]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:56.120]  reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it
[1:04:56.120 --> 1:05:01.400]  reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may
[1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:06.520]  be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores
[1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:11.480]  enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business
[1:05:11.480 --> 1:05:16.600]  whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food
[1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:20.760]  one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities
[1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:25.880]  my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there
[1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:29.720]  listening it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the
[1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:34.360]  government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:38.920]  self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation
[1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:43.960]  but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from e-coli

[1:06:24.680 --> 1:06:30.280]  if you've got a question for bob Chapman the international forecaster.com
[1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:40.120]  he has predicted almost every trend and development we've seen very accurate history and that's
[1:06:40.120 --> 1:06:46.200]  the topic as we bring you people who've proven themselves whereas the mainstream media the
[1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:49.960]  federal government the federal reserve has been lying to you for years saying everything's wonderful
[1:06:49.960 --> 1:06:54.840]  we're sound having a debt based economies good go into debt deeper the whole time they were
[1:06:54.840 --> 1:06:58.920]  setting up the public and we have the imf and world bank documents on this we have the bill
[1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:03.560]  berg sources on this three years ago they were planning to pop the subprime mortgage in the
[1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:08.680]  next year and a half which they did and then you can argue that it's gotten out of control for them
[1:07:08.680 --> 1:07:13.160]  i don't know if i agree with that but regardless they are going to organize and control their
[1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:19.480]  response and out of the crisis we see government expanding we see a consolidation of power
[1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:26.680]  vertical integration a massive destruction of wealth in that transfer but again a greater
[1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:32.200]  centralization of wealth this is no doubt happening so we'll be taking your calls for
[1:07:32.200 --> 1:07:43.320]  bob Chapman in this hour at 1-800-259-9231 bob we've had the chief strategist at the bank of
[1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:48.600]  england come out and say within two to five years the dollar will be completely devalued and dumped
[1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:54.280]  that's what you've been saying two to five years you say two to three uh he uh others are coming
[1:07:54.280 --> 1:08:01.720]  out and saying similar things we have one of the biggest fund managers in the world coming out today
[1:08:01.720 --> 1:08:08.280]  and saying the entire economy is a ponzi scheme i want to get into that and then we have ubs and
[1:08:08.280 --> 1:08:11.640]  the federal government going around shutting down people swiss bank accounts but these are
[1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:17.000]  the small fry swiss bank accounts this is selectively being done it's only 18 billion
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:22.520]  of these 19 000 accounts sounds like a lot it's nothing uh we know it's already going to dubai
[1:08:22.520 --> 1:08:26.680]  in luxembourg so uh that's all part of selective enforcement as well i'm going to get your analysis
[1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:33.080]  on that but uh first off we're suddenly seeing the economists and all these other publications
[1:08:33.080 --> 1:08:38.280]  signal depression i had paul craig robertson he said no way to avert the depression now
[1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:45.400]  he said it will be a a he agreed with my term uh as you have a hyper stag inflation he said the
[1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:50.440]  most devastating combination ever seen nothing like this has ever happened bob Chapman
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:59.000]  well let's start off with uh peter and uh uh he put it eloquently i agree with him there's only
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:05.320]  one thing i disagree with and he believes that by going into other markets and investing in those
[1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:12.040]  places uh that you can avoid uh some of or these problems in america and perhaps west
[1:09:12.040 --> 1:09:17.960]  in europe and others are going to experience and what in fact the whole world is going to experience
[1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:28.520]  uh dreadful economic and financial experiences nobody is going to be left unscathed and to think
[1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:34.360]  that there'll be a decoupling um i don't think that's going to happen and that's what peter's
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:41.640]  talking about i think the only true place to be for safety is gold and silver related assets and
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:47.960]  if you are a wealthy person and you want to have 20 or 30 or 40 percent of your assets
[1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:55.400]  in another safe place or a relatively safe place i have recommended swiss frank treasuries
[1:09:55.400 --> 1:10:00.600]  other than that i don't have anything to offer other than the fact that's where i disagree with
[1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:07.320]  him but the rest of what he said is absolutely correct well i mean when you go into a mad max
[1:10:07.320 --> 1:10:15.960]  beyond thunderdome uh type crises you only want what you can physically hold uh and uh all the
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:20.840]  main analysts are saying this crisis is a black hole that is sucking the world in and and and
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:25.320]  whereas the globalists like to blame the us for this it's the globalists that did it and they've
[1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:31.480]  run the same Ponzi schemes in every major nation and what's happening now i saw an article this
[1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:42.360]  morning from europe and they were talking about uh clients of banks demanding gold coins and gold
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:50.920]  bars etc uh they haven't seen that in switzerland since probably the late 1980s and generally you
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:57.480]  know and throughout europe uh now let's explain swiss bank accounts are and and and other safe
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:02.680]  havens and are saying we don't want your paper give us gold or we won't hold it
[1:11:05.160 --> 1:11:08.440]  well they're not going that far but they're i've seen reports of that
[1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:14.280]  go ahead well the client the clients are saying we want gold i mean that's just the bottom line
[1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:21.080]  it's as simple as that uh i'm i'm sure that there are many pro goals with bankers today
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:27.080]  as 10 years ago there weren't 20 years ago there weren't uh there were in the late 70s because i used
[1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:34.200]  to spend a lot of time over there but you know things change but anyway uh as far as the accounts
[1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:41.400]  that you mentioned earlier uh yes that is kind of a uh a shovel of sand into the ocean there's a
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:48.520]  lot more accounts over there than that but uh it in october what happened was that the
[1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:55.480]  swiss banks did agree that any american who was open an account in switzerland switzerland
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:12:00.680]  from here on out would have to file a w nine and they would file it for him so that means
[1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:11.720]  for any new people it would be no secrecy why are they going after ubs why are they closing
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:17.640]  19 000 accounts i mean we know that the oecd has been saying they don't want any tax havens
[1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:23.720]  they want world taxation in every nation under this new global government run by the central banks
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:29.480]  the elite banks where every nation has on average an 80 percent tax rate they say they say france
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:34.680]  is the model they call the united states a tax haven and now the united states has been empowering
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:41.240]  worldwide uh the oecd to go out and try to shut down these accounts but we know it's selectively
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:47.480]  being done why i mean do they just want the money are they setting a precedent exactly alex they want
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:54.440]  to control everybody's money and they want to make sure they get every bit of tax that they're
[1:12:54.440 --> 1:13:00.280]  supposed to get so they can steal it and that's really the bottom line on this thing and this
[1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:05.800]  has been underway for the last eight years under bush here in the united states i mean i've talked
[1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:13.560]  to heads of government who have told me right straight to my face over dinner that they came in
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:18.200]  here they told us you're going to do this this this this and this and if you don't we're going to
[1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:25.000]  cut off your internet all your communications all your banking connections uh we're going to
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:30.840]  make it so miserable you'll have no tourism uh you either agree or we'll destroy you it's just
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:38.600]  a little more than it's and to explain the ultra hyper rich use government as a vacuum cleaner with
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:45.320]  with the umbrella of force to go around the world including the united states taxing the middle
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:51.480]  class and the new vorice and the new wealth sucking it into government then it goes offshore
[1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:56.280]  to these globalist combines that are outside the law example goldman sacks paid less than
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:14:05.480]  one percent in corporate taxes uh in 2008 and in 2007 so they pay basically nothing and then
[1:14:05.480 --> 1:14:09.720]  average citizens let's see you try to own a car dealership you try to own a restaurant uh you
[1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:14.600]  try to own a real estate company you try to own a clothier anything they're going to squeeze the
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:21.480]  daylights out of you and then now let's see you're some middle class person or new vorice person who
[1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:26.120]  got money offshore even money you had earned a lot of these things are people's money they earn
[1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:29.960]  they just put it overseas they don't trust us banks maybe they want to retire in europe they're
[1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:36.360]  saying no we're taking that money too now so literally this is the mafia government and that's
[1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:44.200]  why it got to be stopped and if it's not stopped america is going to be popularized and one of the
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:50.280]  things that um pete brought out and and paul craig robinson i have brought out before is
[1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:56.840]  free trade and globalization which has led to the destruction of the uh manufacturing industries
[1:14:56.840 --> 1:15:05.480]  in the united states one of the ways that we could stop this that's going on not financially
[1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:13.160]  but and and as a reason i'm telling you all this but for the american worker is simply to
[1:15:13.160 --> 1:15:23.640]  invoke and i think it's coming invoke trade barriers things that we've had since the year 1800
[1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:31.320]  tariffs on goods and services that would reverse this whole thing now i brought this up because all
[1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:37.480]  those transnational corporations are making money by manufacturing goods in china selling them in
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:43.800]  america and the profits go to the cayman islands now if you remember three years ago what they did
[1:15:44.600 --> 1:15:50.200]  was a u.s congress which is bought and paid for they passed a law which was supposed to
[1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:58.360]  to insert money into companies in the united states so they could hire more people increase
[1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:04.200]  employment and that money was to come from these trans nationals that had all these all this money
[1:16:04.200 --> 1:16:11.560]  offshore that had never been taxed and instead of paying 33 they paid five and a quarter what a
[1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:20.600]  sweetheart deal on 360 billion dollars now we should have got 33 percent of that we the american
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:27.320]  government and that bears out exactly what you're talking about two sets of rules one for us and one
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:35.800]  for them and they're going for broke by debasing all the nations of the world they make us weak
[1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:43.160]  bankrupt easily controlled meanwhile they are internationalized they aren't uh beholden to
[1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:46.520]  the same set of rules because they're the internationalists they're the global government
[1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:53.800]  openly with the private central bank family setting world law uh i mean this is the ultimate
[1:16:53.800 --> 1:17:00.360]  tyranny this is like a science fiction nightmare and that's why alex is going to only be one answer
[1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:06.680]  and it's going to be in the streets because these people are not going to give up every nation is
[1:17:06.680 --> 1:17:11.560]  going to have the same problem america is going to have they're all going to be on the red virgin
[1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:18.520]  revolutions that's why i don't think we'll ever see foreign troops brought into quell anything in
[1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:27.400]  america i mean let's say that brazil was asked to send troops in to america to help put down
[1:17:27.400 --> 1:17:33.560]  insurrection well a minute they do that they're going to have insurrection of brazil because
[1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:38.520]  there's no troops around well look at look at greece look at uh san francisco the cop cold
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:43.160]  bloodedly kills the guy they say the cop's going to go free did a good job killing uh and so the
[1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:48.840]  people riot what do you expect them to do that's right god they still got some some humanity in
[1:17:48.840 --> 1:17:56.280]  them some anger and the media decries it they should just sit down and enjoy the fact this young
[1:17:56.280 --> 1:18:03.960]  man's dead that officer did an excellent job maril that's sick it's absolutely and then they lied
[1:18:03.960 --> 1:18:10.280]  about it and said there weren't any videotapes and turned out there were i mean just unbelievable

[1:22:18.680 --> 1:22:23.800]  i want to start going to your calls right now because listeners will bring up a lot of questions
[1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:28.280]  that i wouldn't have thought to ask or that points that bob wouldn't have thought to make
[1:22:28.280 --> 1:22:36.040]  but he has knowledge on but briefly bob dealing with the nature of the overlords that are carrying
[1:22:36.040 --> 1:22:40.600]  this out they're not invincible they're not god they have a lot of systems of brainwashing
[1:22:40.600 --> 1:22:46.600]  and control and deception but once people lose confidence in them you know they'll try to set
[1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:52.920]  up new dummy institutions to get confidence that's what obama is but uh people are already
[1:22:52.920 --> 1:22:57.960]  seeing through that facade rather quickly and we see that degrading fast so i predict within
[1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:03.080]  six eight months you'll have a 50 percent approval rating 40 percent approval rating set a 60 plus
[1:23:03.080 --> 1:23:07.800]  right now and then it'll plunge down to about 15 percent within a year and a half congress still has
[1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:13.000]  a nine percent approval rating but bob when you read the pnac documents of brzezinski's the great
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:18.600]  chess board or between two ages you know they say we're the world empire we've got to make this move
[1:23:18.600 --> 1:23:24.600]  it's risky but we've got to try to enslave everybody they're very honest about it uh and so i guess
[1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:30.120]  it's the position of we've got the power we've got to use it and so they're overreaching i agree
[1:23:30.120 --> 1:23:35.720]  with you i don't see this new world order going too well yeah i think um they've made a lot of
[1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:41.160]  mistakes particularly in the last 10 years and brzezinski three and a half four years ago said
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:47.720]  that particularly in in relation to the um the bush administration which has just been a disaster
[1:23:47.720 --> 1:23:56.440]  for them and um they passed a point of no return in june uh 2002 and i know that uh paul craig robert
[1:23:56.440 --> 1:24:02.040]  says there's no way back well there's been no way back for a long time about six years uh and so
[1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:07.640]  they got to go forward with this thing and they're not going to come out unscathed when you see uh
[1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:14.440]  kissinger uh in his three three minutes on the floor of the new york stock exchange a couple of
[1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:20.280]  days ago telling us that obama is going to usher in the new world order uh he's letting everybody
[1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:27.400]  on wall street and uh and and corporate america and banking and government know that the program's
[1:24:27.400 --> 1:24:32.200]  still on and we've got we're in there and we're going to make it happen and he's saying you better
[1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:38.760]  you better tell the line that's right it was it was essentially a threat and i like threats
[1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:45.080]  uh because uh it it makes me more steadfast and uh well what we see what they want we're
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:50.120]  going to beat them alex it's going to be very painful but we're going to beat them i agree now
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:55.960]  we see pat robertson saying socialism will save us he says yeah people people will accept it he
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:25:03.400]  says obama is unstoppable just submit to him uh i mean he's been talking to god again what why
[1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:10.760]  don't we ever have that opportunity why is it always him well hey uh bob why do we see all
[1:25:10.760 --> 1:25:15.880]  these top real estate brokers bond brokers and other adolf merkel one of the world's richest men
[1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:22.200]  mysteriously uh dies commit suicide we're seeing a lot of these mid-level elitist dying
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:29.480]  well i i can't answer why because i don't know they said it was a suicide but who knows
[1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:33.320]  you know i've seen suicides where people have shot themselves in the back
[1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:40.920]  and you know they've got this thing this this system so controlled uh it just like you pointed
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:46.840]  out earlier uh the the the policeman shoots a man in the back and said he was defending himself
[1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:52.120]  and there were no cameras when in fact there were and and they're still not going to do anything
[1:25:52.120 --> 1:25:58.040]  it's okay to murder people yeah they confiscate people's cell phone cameras uh and it turns out
[1:25:58.040 --> 1:26:02.440]  people in another train did get video of it and now they're in a lot of trouble but but they're so
[1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:07.320]  arrogant they say ah cop goes free now that we can do about it yeah this guy threw himself but that
[1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:16.760]  vein goes entirely through this upper echelon of we can never be wrong we get two sets of rules one
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:21.960]  for us one for you and that's the way it's going to be well i get news for them we're going to
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:27.480]  change it alex aren't we well we don't have any choice we've got to these people are giving us
[1:26:27.480 --> 1:26:33.800]  no quarter but um let's go ahead and go to a phone call for bob Chapman don in canada you're on the year
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:43.160]  hey don you you want to be on air okay we'll let yep go ahead don you want to be on air go ahead
[1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:50.280]  hey alex i just want to ask a couple questions um one was uh marvin bush um i'm sort of uh
[1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:54.680]  like i like your movies like nine eleven truth writing i'm sort of surprised there's no marvin
[1:26:54.680 --> 1:27:01.720]  bush uh footage i was just wondering uh is the uh truthers like uh this is a call out to truthers
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:06.840]  to get a footage of marvin bush someone asked well i mean we confront who we can confront
[1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:11.160]  in cities all across the nation and marvin bush doesn't come out from under his rock
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:16.440]  much but yes uh in two of my nine eleven films we do talk about how he was running security on the
[1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:21.160]  world trade centers and then the debunkers say that's not true it's in mainstream news articles
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:28.280]  and his mother wrote about it in her memoir three years ago that's how we know about it yeah but uh
[1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:32.840]  i just want to say something to the truthers they're doing a great job and uh keep it up
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:37.640]  and one last question is about uh arnold schwarzniger wearing the uh not the death
[1:27:37.640 --> 1:27:43.880]  said uh bell buckle and uh in the magazine with bloomberg and actually probably probably a year
[1:27:43.880 --> 1:27:50.760]  ago i saw him with bloomberg on another cover wearing the same bell buckle and uh you know
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:56.200]  i'm just shocked that no one ever asked him a question about that because again there's again
[1:27:56.200 --> 1:28:00.920]  there's rules for us and then rules for them he can say he loves hitler he can say he wants to be
[1:28:00.920 --> 1:28:09.320]  a dictator that's good if you say he's a nazi the adl calls you a nazi we're on the march the empires

[1:31:59.560 --> 1:32:03.560]  Sean in New York you're on the air with Bob Chapman go ahead
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:08.920]  how you doing Bob um but I wanted to ask Bob pretty much is it even worth
[1:32:09.960 --> 1:32:16.680]  us paying um I know it's pretty stupid but I mean just asking since the money is pretty much
[1:32:16.680 --> 1:32:22.520]  gonna amount to nothing is it pretty much even worth paying like most of these bills and credit
[1:32:22.520 --> 1:32:27.000]  card debts and all these sort of things that the American people are going to be having to deal with
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:33.560]  I mean if the money is pretty much going to be worth nothing at all well you've got to understand
[1:32:33.560 --> 1:32:38.760]  that the people that you owe the money to are still going to be within the system there is going to
[1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:43.560]  be some kind of a system maybe it'll break down from time to time but you're still going to have
[1:32:43.560 --> 1:32:51.960]  to pay it off and just because the the value of the the dollar goes down it still means that you
[1:32:51.960 --> 1:32:59.080]  have to pay those bills the way you protect yourself is to call Midas and purchase gold and silver coins
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:05.880]  well sir let me break down the basics of this is a very sophisticated nuanced question
[1:33:06.920 --> 1:33:11.160]  here's the deal and they've announced this England is actually bringing back debtor
[1:33:11.160 --> 1:33:16.760]  prisons where they're going to put you in jail if you haven't paid debts where they're going to allow
[1:33:16.760 --> 1:33:24.440]  uh repo men bounty hunters in the US and England this is now being announced to come in your house
[1:33:24.440 --> 1:33:29.560]  to knock your door down and come in and literally take your jewels whatever they want there's already
[1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:33.480]  happening in England they're proposing it here and so what's going to happen is if you don't pay
[1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:38.680]  your credit cards if you don't pay your house if you don't pay for things like that uh when you
[1:33:38.680 --> 1:33:42.520]  when they put us on to a cashless society and this is already starting to happen that means
[1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:46.600]  even if you're trying to pay cash you're going to demand you swipe your card or you pay with a check
[1:33:46.600 --> 1:33:52.840]  instead of the check or the credit card scan to see if you've bounced checks they're already adding
[1:33:52.840 --> 1:33:59.480]  to it do you have bad credit uh have you uh uh you know ever not pay the credit card off and
[1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:04.120]  they say sorry we're not accepting even your debit card or even your check and then they're
[1:34:04.120 --> 1:34:09.880]  talking about not even your cash so talk about the beast system they are saying that you won't be
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:15.960]  able to buy or sell uh in these major mega mards which are taking over they're actually getting
[1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:21.160]  more profitable during the crisis as main street dies even further and now all over the nation
[1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:28.040]  they're rating watermelon stands uh egg stands they're rating people that slaughter their own
[1:34:28.040 --> 1:34:34.600]  lamb and sell it at a local co-op they're shut they are they are massively increasing bureaucracies
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:41.480]  to shut down the family farm animal ID premises ID and so so as they squeeze you they're then
[1:34:41.480 --> 1:34:46.280]  going to make it very hard for you to be in the underground uh black market or free economy
[1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:50.200]  and then they're going to force you into a national ID card where there's no economy
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:55.080]  left and they dump credits onto your card that you can barely live on but then you have to
[1:34:55.080 --> 1:35:00.760]  quote be part of the national compulsory service brigades that they're going to have eight separate
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:07.640]  groups they've announced uh at uh change.gov so again yeah the banks they don't have to pay
[1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:11.640]  their bills but you do now a certain point if it comes down to feeding your families yeah don't
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:16.040]  pay the bills anymore but that's a moral decision you have to pay don't screw don't screw the guy
[1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:20.920]  that fixes your car on credit that's a moral but if it isn't paying a credit card to a private bank
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:25.720]  to credit out a fiat i see nothing immoral about that you just have to understand the consequences
[1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:30.120]  of how they're going to use this cashless grid to squeeze you people say i don't care if it's a
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:35.800]  cashless grid tracking me what do i have to hide that grid is meant to rape you financially it's
[1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:46.200]  run by criminals uh genius level uh people who revel in in in control bob absolutely i i couldn't
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:53.640]  say it any better perfect and one more thing i like i just wanted to ask you i know you keep on
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:59.880]  um putting out statistics of people really waking up and and uh i really believe it but then there's
[1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:05.240]  just still a lot of time that i can talk to old people and you know even people my age i'm i'm only
[1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:12.280]  24 and i can just still ask some questions and there still seems to be into obama days of just
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:17.480]  not you know we're near understanding half of what's even going on or what's about to come
[1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:22.920]  well what did rustle me you just say about obama he says he's pure evil and anybody who who really
[1:36:22.920 --> 1:36:28.360]  knows history knows obama is a front man i mean as racist as this new world order is they didn't put
[1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:32.280]  a guy that's half black in there because they wanted to they put him in there because they own
[1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:38.600]  him and he's going to sucker people i i just to copy you know my confidence you know diminishes
[1:36:38.600 --> 1:36:43.160]  sometimes because i like you know to be intellectual with people and converse back and forth that's
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:47.560]  how actually you can get information across when you're converging with people back and forth about
[1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:54.040]  what's going on but old people even chinese people i talked to them all different you know groups but
[1:36:54.040 --> 1:37:00.600]  nobody just still seems to just know what's going on well here's some good news here's some good news
[1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:05.080]  i went to the mall because the lady that's my hair is in the mall i don't normally go to the mall
[1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:10.200]  don't really like that culture but i'm in there and i had three separate black guys two of them
[1:37:10.200 --> 1:37:14.440]  working at little kiosk stopped me and go you know i always liked you for years but kind of got
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:19.880]  upset at first when you didn't like obama but i want to basically apologize you were right about
[1:37:19.880 --> 1:37:26.680]  obama uh and i you know i can see his betrayal so give him some time the people who won't wake up is
[1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:31.800]  is is white yuppies because they're just so arrogant they're so trusting in the system
[1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:40.440]  that bob Chapman you want to comment on that no no it it's perfect it it reflects exactly
[1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:47.880]  what's going on and he's just a front man and uh we you know we have team b went in for team a
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:54.520]  and they're all alumni they're all cfr etc and they're gonna keep on doing exactly what they
[1:37:54.520 --> 1:37:59.480]  were doing before yeah i mean i say this a lot but i want listeners understand something this
[1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:04.360]  isn't a game this is life and death i get death threats bob gets some bobs had to leave the country
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:09.400]  okay uh i mean this is the real world we have people attacking us last night that i'm not
[1:38:09.400 --> 1:38:14.120]  even gonna get into on air i mean it's off the charts but again that's a blessing we know we're
[1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:18.040]  having an effect but for those that are doubting of any of this is you know isn't real or we're
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:28.200]  exaggerating we're holding back the severity bob you're right absolutely right uh anything else
[1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:35.720]  and you know i'll tell you something we are hurting them very very badly and by going to the sponsor
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:42.920]  the these these kinds of programs and helping them keeps us on the air and only if there's others
[1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:49.000]  like us as well and we've got to get the word out in this is alex just said people are coming up to
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:54.920]  him and saying gee you know at the first i didn't believe you and now i do and i'm glad you said
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:39:03.000]  what you said and you're truthful and people desperately need the truth absolutely uh you
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:06.760]  were trying to say something else john yeah i was just gonna say you know that's why i just really
[1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:11.960]  want to thank you and bob you know especially and for you guys to know that myself and i'm pretty
[1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:17.400]  sure that there's millions of others that actually live like day-to-day life all for you guys this
[1:39:17.400 --> 1:39:22.920]  information and uh you know just not you know just appreciate you guys coming on every single day
[1:39:22.920 --> 1:39:28.680]  because we tune in every day to learn what steps we can do at that steps to to probably fight this
[1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:34.280]  thing and uh you guys information or just just it's vital to us so john god bless you and i
[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:39.960]  appreciate that and that's how we keep going on uh i want to be clear though because this is a reflex
[1:39:39.960 --> 1:39:45.240]  this is an instinct you need to have i'm not lying to you everything i tell you is documented i had
[1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:50.200]  a guest on yesterday and i and i and he said they haven't announced yet that a world government run
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:54.920]  by banks will control us and i said yes they have and i pulled up newsweek and a few other articles
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:40:02.120]  and put it on screen uh so everything i i cover is bob this is what i just had a huge flashback
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:08.360]  yesterday i learned that there's a bill introduced the democrats have a good chance of passing
[1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:13.320]  to where the attorney general is given cart blanche letter of mark to ban any guns he wants
[1:40:13.960 --> 1:40:18.600]  and and uh this is the former clinton deputy attorney general and they are already saying
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:23.560]  that they will ban most rifles and handguns now now i have the bill number i've read the bill
[1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:28.360]  and i'm so busy covering everything else and i'm so subconsciously acclimated
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:32.680]  to the belief that i really know they're coming after our guns that then i don't even ring the
[1:40:32.680 --> 1:40:37.720]  alarm bell because i've been so deep in this fight can you speak to that psychological danger
[1:40:37.720 --> 1:40:43.000]  we have that or do you ever get into that where you get so acclimated to these horrors that that
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:48.440]  it becomes second nature and and and and you even lose your capacity to become upset by it
[1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:54.040]  you almost become accustomed to this devilishness because i have the bill right here and i haven't
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:59.320]  even given the bill number out in two days i keep forgetting to get to it well i think you better
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:03.080]  give it out right now do you have it yeah i'm gonna pull it up in a minute i had it up on screen
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:08.920]  and that's what i want to say this and to answer your question uh you know after these many years
[1:41:08.920 --> 1:41:15.160]  i've been involved in this the sensitivity is still there to what's going on but what you
[1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:22.520]  have to do and i call it compartmentalization in your brain uh you have your field of knowledge
[1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:28.360]  and then you have what the bad guys are doing and then you have the new events that are coming along
[1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:36.360]  and you have to first discern what part of the of the new events that are coming along
[1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:42.280]  are important and must be reported on and in alex you're doing the same thing and and then
[1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:51.640]  it it becomes part of your job you you don't become callous toward it but you become used to it
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:58.360]  but you don't use it lose your sensitivity and and we can see that on the program when you
[1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:06.120]  start talking quicker and and and we can feel the emotion in your voice and it's the same with
[1:42:06.120 --> 1:42:15.960]  myself so you and i at least haven't been desensitized well anybody says that it's hard to handle it
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:21.320]  but we've got to do it for them all those people out there because they can't handle it but we
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:28.440]  can well i mean it's more nuanced i i guess i'm not articulating it right i'm more sensitive than
[1:42:28.440 --> 1:42:36.200]  ever but it's like i'm a batter up with a thousand baseballs coming at me and just incredible things
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:41.320]  come on the scene now that would have shaken the whole the whole situation 10 years ago
[1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:45.640]  and now there's so many mega bad things happening that it makes my head spin do you see what i'm
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:52.760]  saying yeah and and that is the truth i mean i i say to my wife should we rename the international
[1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:59.560]  forecaster to the international financial and economic political and social inquire i mean
[1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:08.760]  there is no good news out there that i can find i'm looking for the article uh right now it's just
[1:43:08.760 --> 1:43:16.120]  well here it is proposed law would allow obama ag holder to ban guns at will now when i saw this
[1:43:16.120 --> 1:43:21.480]  in world that daily i believed it because they're a pretty good source on things like that but i
[1:43:21.480 --> 1:43:27.160]  wanted to go read the bill so this was uh monday night now i can't believe no tuesday night i can't
[1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:33.240]  believe it's all these days i haven't gotten to it and as his proposed law you know in a way it's so
[1:43:33.240 --> 1:43:36.840]  horrific i think in a way i psychologically suppress it you know people think i want to get
[1:43:36.840 --> 1:43:40.840]  up here and bash cops nine percent of the time i don't even cover the the articles i have because
[1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:45.320]  it makes me sick you know it's not like we're here even trying to give people all the bad news bob do
[1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:50.520]  you ever kind of just cringe as all the info's coming in because you you don't even want to have
[1:43:50.520 --> 1:43:57.960]  to analyze it because you're sick of it you better believe it you better believe it and you know it
[1:43:57.960 --> 1:44:05.560]  just gets nastier and nastier especially when i see people like uh kissing her on television
[1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:13.240]  on cnbc and in brzezinski and people like that they're so so evil and relishing he's saying this
[1:44:13.240 --> 1:44:19.240]  this this crisis is wonderful the economic the military he said he was getting happy his eyes
[1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:24.120]  twinkled he said this is going to help us this is good this is going to bring in a new world order
[1:44:24.120 --> 1:44:30.920]  what a sick bastard while those children in gaza are dead everywhere that's right and they don't care
[1:44:30.920 --> 1:44:40.200]  how many people dying they're above that here it is uh nimo did a detailed story on it but he sources
[1:44:40.200 --> 1:44:46.520]  whirlwind alien ap here proposed law may allow obama ag to ban guns and will now this is the same
[1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:52.200]  thing congress seeds unlimited total no oversight complete power to the private federal reserve
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:57.640]  and the treasury separate and above government green spin goes on air and brags were above you
[1:44:57.640 --> 1:45:03.720]  all no one can even investigate us it's the same thing here it's it's like ceding imperial godlike
[1:45:03.720 --> 1:45:09.960]  right of king power uh it says uh it looks like the gun grabbers may have a field day when the new
[1:45:09.960 --> 1:45:15.880]  congress convenes according to bob uh unru writing for world net daily obama's ag nominee eric
[1:45:15.880 --> 1:45:21.480]  holder is a big gun grabber i would add may have the ability to ban guns and will they cite hr
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:28.600]  1 0 2 2 sponsored by new york democrat carillon mccarthy and 67 cosponsors and it goes on to
[1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:33.320]  say that when the new democrats are seated in the new house which i guess has just now happened
[1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:38.440]  they have a good chance of passing and then i we have the bill sections here where it just says
[1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:43.560]  that will he can ban any firearms he wants so no longer is there laws it's just a blank check
[1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:49.800]  uh bob and and here's obama who's who in chicago supported total gun bans and said that was
[1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:55.240]  reasonable and who in support of the dc total gun ban and he says don't worry i believe in
[1:45:55.240 --> 1:46:00.120]  your second amendment we can't just cart launch ban them all at once but we can by law prescribe
[1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:04.920]  and ban a lot of them i mean the son of a bitch is on record and the people are still in denial
[1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:11.720]  they just don't get it and it's part of the brainwashing process half of them are out to lunch
[1:46:12.280 --> 1:46:16.360]  and whether we'll get them back or not i don't know but we will get them
[1:46:16.360 --> 1:46:20.280]  once they're in the street when their house is gone and the cars are gone and
[1:46:20.280 --> 1:46:26.040]  and the debit card has no credits in them anymore and that that's unfortunately one
[1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:30.600]  they're gonna wake up and if they pass this legislation you better bury your weapons in

[1:52:47.400 --> 1:52:50.560]  I'm going to come back in the next whole segment and take a few more calls, but right
[1:52:50.560 --> 1:52:54.400]  now, briefly, I wanted Bob and Ted Anderson to have a chance to talk because I know the
[1:52:54.400 --> 1:52:59.760]  Minus Resources also offers a trial copy of the International Forecaster, but Ted is doing
[1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:05.800]  gold is up again today, but Ted bought it a few weeks ago at the 760 level.
[1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:13.080]  So he's again, the price is close to I guess $90 under what it is right now, so he factors
[1:53:13.080 --> 1:53:15.200]  that into the savings.
[1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:19.560]  Ted told folks out there about today and throughout the weekend, the gold offer, and then I don't
[1:53:19.560 --> 1:53:20.640]  know what Bob's going to say.
[1:53:20.640 --> 1:53:24.240]  I want to see what he's going to say because he's a great analyst on this of how good a
[1:53:24.240 --> 1:53:25.640]  deal he thinks it is.
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:28.160]  So Bob Chapman and Ted Anderson, you guys talk.
[1:53:28.160 --> 1:53:29.160]  Yeah.
[1:53:29.160 --> 1:53:33.000]  Well, basically what I have right now, Alex, I mean, gold did edge up again today and seen
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:36.600]  a peak of $868.90, which means it is getting stronger.
[1:53:36.600 --> 1:53:41.560]  The unemployment figures came out way low, I mean, way higher than what it was.
[1:53:41.560 --> 1:53:45.640]  So I mean, it's just the whole economy here is melting down.
[1:53:45.640 --> 1:53:50.760]  What I did is I picked up some Franks here just a short while ago at that price level
[1:53:50.760 --> 1:53:57.160]  that you're referring to, and they're currently at 204 where the British sovereign is at 252.
[1:53:57.160 --> 1:54:03.720]  Everything Liberty halves are at $8.40 or $8.40 or $168 per roll at 20.
[1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:06.440]  All that stuff is in really a good buying range at this time.
[1:54:06.440 --> 1:54:10.640]  Obviously, with the economy melting down, I just can't think of a better time for people
[1:54:10.640 --> 1:54:15.000]  to be getting involved in the gold and silver, plus also having the support of rising market
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:19.720]  prices, you know, just the whole thing.
[1:54:19.720 --> 1:54:23.400]  I mean, that gun issue that you're talking about earlier on should make people's blood
[1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:24.400]  boil.
[1:54:24.400 --> 1:54:28.440]  I mean, it's all tied together, this whole new world order thing, this Democrat versus
[1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:33.640]  Republican right versus left, and you're talking about how this, it's this team or that team
[1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:34.640]  that has to win.
[1:54:34.640 --> 1:54:38.280]  I mean, it's like in a football game here in Minnesota, it's the Vikings versus the
[1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:39.880]  Green Bay Packers.
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:40.880]  It doesn't matter.
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:44.120]  It's still the football game that's being played, and that's exactly what's going on
[1:54:44.120 --> 1:54:45.120]  here economically.
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:48.400]  Well, let me break this down and get Bob's take on this.
[1:54:48.400 --> 1:54:52.720]  Look, we've got the, you know, the head strategist, the Bank of England saying the dollar within
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:56.360]  two to five years will be gone, maybe even faster.
[1:54:56.360 --> 1:55:01.360]  All these other role leaders are now saying it, I guess trying to signal that there may
[1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:05.120]  come a time when you can't buy gold and silver with fellow reserve notes, folks, you need
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:07.360]  to move into gold and silver right now.
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:14.280]  Bob A, is this a good deal, Ted's offering B, why is, you know, gold and silver important
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:15.280]  to hold?
[1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:21.800]  Well, first of all, gold and silver is important to hold because it's the ultimate money.
[1:55:21.800 --> 1:55:26.440]  And when you have a devaluation, the value of what you own in gold and silver is going
[1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:30.560]  to go up in value versus the paper currency.
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:35.920]  As far as the Franks are concerned, they're an excellent buy, excellent.
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:42.120]  In fact, it's an extraordinary buy, but the point is, even after the Franks are gone,
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:44.120]  they're sold out.
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:46.200]  You've got to continue to keep on buying.
[1:55:46.200 --> 1:55:49.120]  It's the only safe place for you to be.
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:52.920]  By the way, that's the next point, you know, Ted's been doing this 30 years.
[1:55:52.920 --> 1:55:56.080]  You've been doing it even longer than that, but, you know, as a broker, just analyzing
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:56:02.120]  it, not on the hard sales side, Ted, even though most of his competition can't even
[1:56:02.120 --> 1:56:05.400]  find Franks and things, they're now sending him.
[1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:10.680]  Most of them are uncirculated, meaning they're getting down to their last stores, Bob.
[1:56:10.680 --> 1:56:18.480]  Well, that is not surprising with the reports I hear coming in from all over the world that
[1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:23.760]  it's extraordinarily difficult to get gold and silver, and particularly in coins.
[1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:27.200]  I mean, you know, this is everywhere.
[1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:35.200]  Let me fire the number out, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237, and there'll be brokers there
[1:56:35.200 --> 1:56:37.960]  until midnight, Friday, and Ted, does this deal go through the weekend?
[1:56:37.960 --> 1:56:40.200]  Yeah, we'll hold it right through the weekend.
[1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:41.200]  800-686-2237.
[1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:48.200]  Folks, we're going to start the next hour, and I want Ted to be able to finish up his
[1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:51.640]  one-minute comment, and I'll take one or two final calls for Bob Chapman.
[1:56:51.640 --> 1:56:58.800]  But again, that number, 800-686-2237.
[1:56:58.800 --> 1:57:01.280]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:57:01.280 --> 1:57:07.120]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:12.320]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:57:12.320 --> 1:57:13.840]  against this country.
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:16.080]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:18.080]  But who is the enemy?
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:23.080]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:57:23.080 --> 1:57:27.840]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:30.440]  networks inside the United States.
[1:57:30.440 --> 1:57:34.320]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:37.080]  spying in and on the U.S.
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:40.720]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:46.200]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:57:46.200 --> 1:57:50.360]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[1:57:50.360 --> 1:57:51.360]  much more.
[1:57:51.360 --> 1:57:52.360]  Fabled Enemies.
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:57.360]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of
[1:57:57.360 --> 1:57:59.960]  other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:57:59.960 --> 1:58:28.760]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:58:28.760 --> 1:58:38.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:58:38.400 --> 1:58:41.800]  All the callers that have been holding, if you want, you can talk to Alan Watt, if not,
[1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:42.800]  you can hang up.
[1:58:42.800 --> 1:58:45.360]  But we're going to go to Andrew in London in a moment.
[1:58:45.360 --> 1:58:49.160]  That's all we have time for with Bob Chapman, because we've got Alan Watt coming up.
[1:58:49.160 --> 1:58:50.760]  Everybody else will get to you.
[1:58:50.760 --> 1:58:56.080]  We just wanted to talk to Bob, you can hang up, as I said.
[1:58:56.080 --> 1:58:59.560]  But Chad, do you have 50 buffaloes to offer today as well?
[1:58:59.560 --> 1:59:01.080]  I didn't get enough time to say that.
[1:59:01.080 --> 1:59:03.480]  I do have the buffaloes as well.
[1:59:03.480 --> 1:59:05.880]  And they're currently right now at 1036.
[1:59:05.880 --> 1:59:10.560]  I am again going to limit that supply just to 50, because it's trickling.
[1:59:10.560 --> 1:59:14.040]  And those have huge premiums everywhere else.
[1:59:14.040 --> 1:59:19.400]  That's a lot more per ounce of gold than the Franks, but that's more of a collectible,
[1:59:19.400 --> 1:59:20.560]  because they're very scarce.
[1:59:20.560 --> 1:59:25.440]  The Franks, the Sovereigns, you've got them all, 800-686-2237.
[1:59:25.440 --> 1:59:27.120]  What was the final point you wanted to make, Chad?
[1:59:27.120 --> 1:59:30.840]  Well, the final point was you're talking about at some point in time paper currency can't
[1:59:30.840 --> 1:59:33.960]  buy gold or won't buy gold, and that's already occurring.
[1:59:33.960 --> 1:59:39.720]  The supplies of gold in the physical market with the coins are drying up, and you're trying
[1:59:39.720 --> 1:59:41.680]  to trade paper for gold.
[1:59:41.680 --> 1:59:45.680]  I mean, think about it, paper for gold, why would paper be worth gold?
[1:59:45.680 --> 1:59:51.240]  And the only reason why it is is because the United States government has been living on
[1:59:51.240 --> 1:59:55.160]  a legacy that paper was once exchangeable for gold.
[1:59:55.160 --> 2:00:00.640]  And since then, we've lost all fiscal responsibility, and there's no budget that's being held with
[2:00:00.640 --> 2:00:07.320]  any kind of containment, and the printing press is just merging on, and obviously, paper
[2:00:07.320 --> 2:00:11.840]  will not buy gold in the future, and I suggest that you do it now while it can.
[2:00:11.840 --> 2:00:18.840]  800-686-2237, 800-686-2237, you're not going to find a better deal on those Franks and
[2:00:18.840 --> 2:00:22.600]  Sovereigns anywhere else, and that's a great deal also on the buffaloes, but again, that's
[2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:26.800]  more of a collector coin because the mint sold out of them six, eight months ago.
[2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:27.800]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[2:00:27.800 --> 2:00:29.560]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:33.600]  You bet, and that goes throughout Sunday evening, I guess, into Monday morning.
[2:00:33.600 --> 2:00:37.680]  Bob Chapman, we're going to take a call from London, Andrew, but in closing, anything you
[2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:39.120]  want to add to what Ted said?
[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:41.960]  No, I think he covered it pretty good.
[2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:46.160]  Andrew, in London, you're on the air with Bob Chapman, the International Forecaster
[2:00:46.160 --> 2:00:47.160]  dot com.
[2:00:47.160 --> 2:00:48.160]  Go ahead.
[2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:49.160]  Hi, guys.
[2:00:49.160 --> 2:00:52.040]  I know you guys recommend gold, and I think that's great.
[2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:58.120]  I wanted to ask you about Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, the Treasury bonds linked
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:00:59.120]  to inflation.
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:04.240]  What's wrong with that as an idea in addition to gold?
[2:01:04.240 --> 2:01:10.640]  Well, the major problem is the linkage on the CPI figure is bogus.
[2:01:10.640 --> 2:01:20.280]  So if you have a two and a half percent yield on a inflation protected security, such as
[2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:26.560]  a 10-year note, and inflation in reality right now is probably somewhere in the vicinity
[2:01:26.560 --> 2:01:33.520]  of 11 percent, why would one want to do that and have a guaranteed loss and pay taxes too?
[2:01:33.520 --> 2:01:34.520]  Right.
[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:39.280]  I was just thinking, if you don't want to put everything into gold, then you might try
[2:01:39.280 --> 2:01:41.280]  some of these as well.
[2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:45.080]  I steer away from the US currency.
[2:01:45.080 --> 2:01:49.520]  There's not a lot of people who agree with me, but that's normal for me, and I've been
[2:01:49.520 --> 2:01:55.040]  recommending Swiss franc government bonds the whole lot.
[2:01:55.040 --> 2:02:01.840]  That to me is the best shot, but the best shot among currencies, if that's where you
[2:02:01.840 --> 2:02:03.480]  have to be.
[2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:06.840]  If you don't have to be there, you've got to be in gold and silver.
[2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:11.640]  Ryan, how do you recommend buying currencies then?
[2:02:11.640 --> 2:02:13.440]  I essentially don't.
[2:02:13.440 --> 2:02:14.440]  Oh, okay.
[2:02:14.440 --> 2:02:20.880]  I think the bonds are a better vehicle, they usually yield about 1 percent, and if you
[2:02:20.880 --> 2:02:24.320]  must be there, I think that's the best shot.
[2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:25.840]  Okay, great.
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:26.840]  Thanks.
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:30.800]  Sir, I mean, if you have tremendous assets, that would be greatly diversified, but for
[2:02:30.800 --> 2:02:36.400]  the average person, gold and silver is the way to go or to have paid-off property, but
[2:02:36.400 --> 2:02:39.680]  with property taxes, you really don't own it, and they can take it that way too, right,
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:40.680]  Bob?
[2:02:40.680 --> 2:02:41.680]  That's right.
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:45.680]  So, you've got to have some of those Federal Reserve notes available in order to pay that
[2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:46.680]  tax.
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:47.680]  It's extraordinarily important.
[2:02:47.680 --> 2:02:48.680]  All right.
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:53.280]  Bob Chapman, I want to thank you folks and get a free copy of the International Forecaster
[2:02:53.280 --> 2:03:01.360]  when they call minus resources at 800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:02.840]  I want to thank you for coming on.
[2:03:02.840 --> 2:03:04.080]  We'll talk to you again next week.
[2:03:04.080 --> 2:03:05.080]  Lord Willing.
[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:06.080]  Okay.
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:07.080]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:08.080]  Bye-bye.
[2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:09.080]  Thank you, Bob.
[2:03:09.080 --> 2:03:10.080]  There he goes.
[2:03:10.080 --> 2:03:11.080]  All right.
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:12.080]  Good luck.
[2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:13.080]  Bye.
[2:03:13.080 --> 2:03:14.080]  Thank you all.
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:15.080]  Bye.
[2:03:15.080 --> 2:03:16.080]  Bye.'
[2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:17.080]  Hello, friends.
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:18.080]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:03:18.080 --> 2:03:22.400]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:23.400]  important than ever.
[2:03:23.400 --> 2:03:26.380]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[2:03:26.380 --> 2:03:29.180]  You'll never have to stand in the bread line if you have your own bread.
[2:03:29.180 --> 2:03:33.080]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:35.540]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[2:03:35.540 --> 2:03:39.160]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest,
[2:03:39.160 --> 2:03:41.240]  so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:43.080]  They turned off the telephones and emailed.
[2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:47.040]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:49.840]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:52.280]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:54.120]  will slash your life savings to nothing
[2:03:54.120 --> 2:03:56.080]  and blast the cost of massacres,
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:03:58.960]  particularly food beyond many Americans reach.
[2:03:58.960 --> 2:04:01.080]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation,
[2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:03.720]  the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:06.080]  until it reached over four billion marks.
[2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:08.320]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[2:04:08.320 --> 2:04:10.520]  there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[2:04:10.520 --> 2:04:12.880]  The private banks merging with our government
[2:04:12.880 --> 2:04:14.920]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money
[2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:16.200]  to restock their shelves.
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:17.480]  The stores have less food,
[2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:19.440]  but jack up prices to stay in business.
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:21.000]  Whatever happens in America,
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:22.760]  we need to be prepared and be ready.
[2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:24.600]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:27.200]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food
[2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:28.680]  and paying for other necessities.
[2:04:28.680 --> 2:04:30.400]  My friends, whatever it takes,
[2:04:30.400 --> 2:04:32.840]  get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:34.240]  For everybody out there listening,
[2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:35.720]  it's very important for you to understand
[2:04:35.720 --> 2:04:37.600]  that by having a supply of storable food,
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:38.720]  the government, the new old order,
[2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:40.360]  has a lot less control over you,
[2:04:40.360 --> 2:04:41.560]  and so it's a mindset,
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:44.280]  a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:45.960]  No one is gonna take care of your family
[2:04:45.960 --> 2:04:47.520]  in the final equation but you.
[2:04:47.520 --> 2:04:49.560]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able
[2:04:49.560 --> 2:04:51.880]  to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[2:04:51.880 --> 2:04:54.560]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports,
[2:04:54.560 --> 2:04:56.240]  and they do it at almost half the cost
[2:04:56.240 --> 2:04:57.800]  of last year's grocery prices.
[2:04:57.800 --> 2:05:00.440]  Call 1-800-409-5633,
[2:05:00.440 --> 2:05:02.960]  or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:05.680]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the final list
[2:05:05.680 --> 2:05:08.360]  of high-quality freeze-dried and dehydrated foods
[2:05:08.360 --> 2:05:09.240]  they have to offer.
[2:05:09.240 --> 2:05:12.040]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog,
[2:05:12.040 --> 2:05:15.600]  or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[2:05:15.600 --> 2:05:20.600]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:05:20.600 --> 2:05:21.760]  Take action today.
[2:05:21.760 --> 2:05:23.840]  The first step is getting storable food.
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques
[2:05:30.120 --> 2:05:34.680]  which will enable the controlling oligarchy
[2:05:34.680 --> 2:05:39.640]  to get people actually to love their servitude.
[2:05:39.640 --> 2:05:44.040]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs
[2:05:44.040 --> 2:05:49.040]  which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[2:05:49.360 --> 2:05:51.680]  Perhaps you would better start from the beginning.
[2:05:54.960 --> 2:05:57.160]  Perhaps you would better start from the beginning.
[2:05:57.160 --> 2:06:01.320]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[2:06:01.320 --> 2:06:03.160]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[2:06:03.160 --> 2:06:06.160]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[2:06:08.160 --> 2:06:11.160]  Mercury-containing vacuums may help not harm kids
[2:06:11.160 --> 2:06:14.160]  according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[2:06:14.160 --> 2:06:16.640]  These new studies suggest that the opposite,
[2:06:16.640 --> 2:06:18.680]  that the preservatives may actually be associated
[2:06:18.680 --> 2:06:21.160]  with improved control of the immune system.
[2:06:21.160 --> 2:06:24.160]  They may be able to control the immune system
[2:06:24.160 --> 2:06:27.160]  and that the preservatives may actually be associated
[2:06:27.160 --> 2:06:29.160]  with improved behavior and mental performance.
[2:06:29.160 --> 2:06:32.160]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay,
[2:06:32.160 --> 2:06:34.160]  but could it also cause cancer?
[2:06:34.160 --> 2:06:37.160]  For now, the government had the right under U.S. law
[2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:40.160]  to conduct secret testing on the American public
[2:06:40.160 --> 2:06:41.160]  under a specific condition.
[2:06:41.160 --> 2:06:43.160]  We have to work with dark side
[2:06:43.160 --> 2:06:45.160]  to spend time in the shadows.
[2:06:45.160 --> 2:06:47.160]  Any attempt to achieve world order
[2:06:47.160 --> 2:06:49.160]  must be the work of the devil.
[2:06:49.160 --> 2:06:50.160]  Well, join me.
[2:06:50.160 --> 2:06:53.160]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to say
[2:06:53.160 --> 2:06:55.160]  there's a need for new world order.
[2:06:56.160 --> 2:07:00.160]  Someday, in the next few years,
[2:07:01.160 --> 2:07:03.160]  a solution will emerge.
[2:07:13.160 --> 2:07:16.160]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. We are live.
[2:07:16.160 --> 2:07:21.160]  Friday, the ninth day of January 2009.
[2:07:21.160 --> 2:07:25.160]  We are the Good Ship Humanity steaming straight in
[2:07:25.160 --> 2:07:28.160]  to the new world order super typhoon
[2:07:28.160 --> 2:07:30.160]  that intends to sink us.
[2:07:30.160 --> 2:07:35.160]  I see the gullible, poisoned, hypnotized public.
[2:07:35.160 --> 2:07:37.160]  They're like little children, so trusting,
[2:07:37.160 --> 2:07:40.160]  having no idea the grid that is being built
[2:07:40.160 --> 2:07:43.160]  and tightened around their little throats.
[2:07:43.160 --> 2:07:45.160]  But as history has shown,
[2:07:45.160 --> 2:07:48.160]  the public is generally out playing foolishly
[2:07:48.160 --> 2:07:51.160]  and it is up to the good men and women
[2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:54.160]  of honor, of decency, who love humanity
[2:07:54.160 --> 2:07:57.160]  and who understand the danger of corruption
[2:07:57.160 --> 2:07:59.160]  and wickedness to stand up and fight.
[2:07:59.160 --> 2:08:02.160]  And if we take the field, they will fail.
[2:08:02.160 --> 2:08:04.160]  The new world order will fall.
[2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:07.160]  We don't have a choice. They're giving us no quarter.
[2:08:07.160 --> 2:08:10.160]  Cutting to thematrix.com is our guest website.
[2:08:10.160 --> 2:08:12.160]  Cutting to thematrix.com.
[2:08:12.160 --> 2:08:14.160]  My website is, of course, theprisonplanet.com
[2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:17.160]  and infowars.com, and he joins us every few weeks.
[2:08:17.160 --> 2:08:19.160]  We're always honored to have him join us.
[2:08:19.160 --> 2:08:21.160]  From Canada, he is Alan Watt.
[2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:24.160]  He's with us for the next hour and 50 minutes.
[2:08:24.160 --> 2:08:26.160]  Alan Watt, we didn't do any pre-interview.
[2:08:26.160 --> 2:08:28.160]  Whatever you want to get into today,
[2:08:28.160 --> 2:08:31.160]  I'd love to break it down any of the latest news developments.
[2:08:31.160 --> 2:08:34.160]  The establishment is accelerating their announcement.
[2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:38.160]  They are setting up a world bank to be the world government.
[2:08:38.160 --> 2:08:42.160]  They are admitting just so much of their agenda right now.
[2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:45.160]  Out of the gates, why is the establishment,
[2:08:45.160 --> 2:08:47.160]  after denying all this for all these decades,
[2:08:47.160 --> 2:08:51.160]  now emerging and admitting that they indeed
[2:08:51.160 --> 2:08:53.160]  are setting up a tyrannical world government,
[2:08:53.160 --> 2:08:56.160]  but for our own good, in quotes?
[2:08:56.160 --> 2:08:58.160]  I think, to be honest with you,
[2:08:58.160 --> 2:09:00.160]  that they're so sure of themselves now
[2:09:00.160 --> 2:09:03.160]  they have the whole thing in their bag.
[2:09:03.160 --> 2:09:06.160]  They do control all of society.
[2:09:06.160 --> 2:09:11.160]  The cultures of every country in the world now are interdependent,
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:14.160]  the same as the economy, as the cultures are as well.
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:17.160]  It all comes from Hollywood and television,
[2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:20.160]  the same newscasters, et cetera, worldwide.
[2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:22.160]  They're pretty sure themselves.
[2:09:22.160 --> 2:09:25.160]  Plus, they have all of academia,
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:29.160]  the worldwide, sewn up on board with this agenda.
[2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:32.160]  They do know, and have written about this in the past,
[2:09:32.160 --> 2:09:35.160]  that it was essential to get academia on their side
[2:09:35.160 --> 2:09:37.160]  because they'd become the future leaders,
[2:09:37.160 --> 2:09:41.160]  bureaucrats, CEOs of corporations, and so on.
[2:09:41.160 --> 2:09:44.160]  So when they're all trained in the same tunnel vision
[2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:48.160]  of this world order, they think that the people,
[2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:51.160]  they call them the pros, as Orwell called them,
[2:09:51.160 --> 2:09:53.160]  the pros are not even relevant.
[2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:55.160]  The masses don't even know what's happening,
[2:09:55.160 --> 2:09:58.160]  and most of them, to be honest with you, don't really care.
[2:09:58.160 --> 2:10:01.160]  So this has always been their standard philosophy.
[2:10:01.160 --> 2:10:03.160]  We saw them when they set up the communist system
[2:10:03.160 --> 2:10:06.160]  as a dialectic to help bring all this about,
[2:10:06.160 --> 2:10:10.160]  that communism was spread from the universities,
[2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:12.160]  from professors downwards,
[2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:15.160]  and that became the prevalent culture within society
[2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:17.160]  in the Western Hemisphere.
[2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:19.160]  Now they're bringing the both together,
[2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:23.160]  but they truly do have all the basic academic sciences
[2:10:23.160 --> 2:10:27.160]  on board with all of this agenda, including eugenics,
[2:10:27.160 --> 2:10:32.160]  including the necessity to depopulate drastically, rapidly,
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:34.160]  and also to get rid of what they see now
[2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:37.160]  as the useless eaters that would be left over
[2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:39.160]  from a previous society.
[2:10:39.160 --> 2:10:42.160]  They're going into the new world order with the new man
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:45.160]  and a much reduced society of what they think
[2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:47.160]  are the better gene types.
[2:10:47.160 --> 2:10:50.160]  The old man now, according to Darwinian principle,
[2:10:50.160 --> 2:10:53.160]  which they're all grounded on, is now obsolete
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:57.160]  and cannot be brought through into the new system.
[2:10:57.160 --> 2:10:59.160]  Now to be specific, we're not even debating
[2:10:59.160 --> 2:11:02.160]  whether there's evolution or whether, you know,
[2:11:02.160 --> 2:11:05.160]  that theory had some basis in reality.
[2:11:05.160 --> 2:11:07.160]  We're not debating that either or.
[2:11:07.160 --> 2:11:09.160]  The fact is that's their governing system
[2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:12.160]  through social Darwinism and eugenics,
[2:11:12.160 --> 2:11:15.160]  and so that's their rationale for all the horrors
[2:11:15.160 --> 2:11:19.160]  that they carry out when in reality, from studying the elites,
[2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:22.160]  inner bread, we know, causes a lot of psychotic behavior,
[2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:25.160]  delusions of grandeur, a lot of other behaviors.
[2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:28.160]  So really we have an aberrant strain
[2:11:28.160 --> 2:11:31.160]  of malfunctioning humanity who are very intelligent
[2:11:31.160 --> 2:11:35.160]  and well organized, but also psychopathic sociopaths
[2:11:35.160 --> 2:11:39.160]  and a gaggle of fellow travelers
[2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:42.160]  who only have certain pieces of the puzzle,
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:44.160]  and then you have all these subgroups
[2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:46.160]  that believe they're at the highest echelons of power
[2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:48.160]  when they're really in lower echelons
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:51.160]  of the pyramidal power structure who revel,
[2:11:51.160 --> 2:11:57.160]  excuse me, in the raw exercise of mindless power,
[2:11:57.160 --> 2:12:01.160]  and that's why when you talk to these mid-level elitists
[2:12:01.160 --> 2:12:03.160]  and technicians and university professors
[2:12:03.160 --> 2:12:05.160]  that say they want to kill the majority of the public,
[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:09.160]  they're that very infantile and aren't very intelligent,
[2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:11.160]  but if you talk to one of the higher level globalists,
[2:12:11.160 --> 2:12:14.160]  they are intelligent, can you go through that
[2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:17.160]  and the way this is broken down from your research
[2:12:17.160 --> 2:12:19.160]  in different subgroup directives
[2:12:19.160 --> 2:12:23.160]  and the type of mindset of these petty power people
[2:12:23.160 --> 2:12:25.160]  who believe that they're members of the elite?
[2:12:25.160 --> 2:12:28.160]  Yes, there's a book out there
[2:12:28.160 --> 2:12:30.160]  people should try and get a hold of,
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:33.160]  for example, Poneurology,
[2:12:33.160 --> 2:12:36.160]  and it's about the study of evil in mankind,
[2:12:36.160 --> 2:12:38.160]  something that was studied in ancient times
[2:12:38.160 --> 2:12:41.160]  but not so much today because they don't believe in evil
[2:12:41.160 --> 2:12:43.160]  or the outcomes of evil is always someone
[2:12:43.160 --> 2:12:45.160]  that benefits, therefore it's okay.
[2:12:45.160 --> 2:12:48.160]  That's basically the cabalistic form of it
[2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:50.160]  which they're all on board with too.
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:55.160]  But Poneurology, this book goes into psychopathy
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:12:58.160]  and how the elite in all nations,
[2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:01.160]  the people's are basically psychopathic,
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:04.160]  they arise to the top in every society
[2:13:04.160 --> 2:13:06.160]  because they're ruthless,
[2:13:06.160 --> 2:13:08.160]  they have no conscience whatsoever,
[2:13:08.160 --> 2:13:10.160]  they're very cunning, they have certain traits,
[2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:14.160]  a psychopath will feel no emotion for other people
[2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:16.160]  outside his own little circle or what he owns
[2:13:16.160 --> 2:13:20.160]  or sees as that which he owns.
[2:13:20.160 --> 2:13:22.160]  But he's very good at it,
[2:13:22.160 --> 2:13:24.160]  he's like a camera who studies other people
[2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:27.160]  as he grows up watching how they behave and interact
[2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:29.160]  and they become tremendous salesmen,
[2:13:29.160 --> 2:13:31.160]  they become politicians,
[2:13:31.160 --> 2:13:33.160]  they do gravitate towards positions of power
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:36.160]  but they're also pseudo-masochistic in their makeup.
[2:13:36.160 --> 2:13:40.160]  This came out at the Nuremberg trial
[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:43.160]  where studies were done on the followers,
[2:13:43.160 --> 2:13:45.160]  the higher followers of Hitler
[2:13:45.160 --> 2:13:48.160]  and they glorified Hitler to the very end
[2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:53.160]  and yet they despised the weaker officers beneath them.
[2:13:53.160 --> 2:13:55.160]  So that is pseudo-masochism,
[2:13:55.160 --> 2:13:58.160]  you crave, you will worship the person
[2:13:58.160 --> 2:14:00.160]  with more power than you have yourself
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:02.160]  and you'll do his bidding immediately
[2:14:02.160 --> 2:14:04.160]  with no questions concerned
[2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:07.160]  and you will despise the lessers beneath you,
[2:14:07.160 --> 2:14:10.160]  that is pseudo-masochistic and that's a standard
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:12.160]  part of this whole system in which we live.
[2:14:12.160 --> 2:14:17.160]  In other words, since the creation of commerce
[2:14:17.160 --> 2:14:21.160]  and money and the debt system and banking and so on
[2:14:21.160 --> 2:14:23.160]  and the armies that it can finance
[2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:28.160]  over other countries, Caesar assets, resources and so on,
[2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:30.160]  we've always had the same types
[2:14:30.160 --> 2:14:33.160]  gravitating to the top in all societies.
[2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:37.160]  In fact, history is just the stories,
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:40.160]  his stories basically, that's what history is,
[2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:42.160]  of the ruling elites who gained power
[2:14:42.160 --> 2:14:45.160]  by being ruthless and merciless
[2:14:45.160 --> 2:14:48.160]  towards other people or rivals
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:51.160]  and we have them today in an organised system,
[2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:53.160]  this is the problem.
[2:14:53.160 --> 2:14:56.160]  Now all many subcultures, you might see nations in fact
[2:14:56.160 --> 2:14:58.160]  have their top gang at the top,
[2:14:58.160 --> 2:15:01.160]  Hoover is at the top of the tree in Japan,
[2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:03.160]  China, wherever, it's a gang.
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:05.160]  It's basically a gang with the most power
[2:15:05.160 --> 2:15:08.160]  and they're all psychopathic in their origins.
[2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:11.160]  Today we have an international group
[2:15:11.160 --> 2:15:13.160]  who have all come together
[2:15:13.160 --> 2:15:16.160]  and they have been working on this for an awful long time
[2:15:16.160 --> 2:15:19.160]  by certain foundations pushing it
[2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:21.160]  and networking them all together
[2:15:21.160 --> 2:15:23.160]  until they're all on board
[2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:25.160]  and as I say, they're all using
[2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:27.160]  or hiding behind the Darwinist theory
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:30.160]  of survival of the fittest,
[2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:32.160]  of the extinction of inferiors
[2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:34.160]  that have no further use,
[2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:36.160]  that's the theory of Darwinism
[2:15:36.160 --> 2:15:38.160]  and therefore they have concluded
[2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:40.160]  that they are the fittest
[2:15:40.160 --> 2:15:42.160]  and they've proven their worth by
[2:15:42.160 --> 2:15:45.160]  gaining power, holding onto it intergenerationally,
[2:15:45.160 --> 2:15:47.160]  marrying the right types
[2:15:47.160 --> 2:15:50.160]  because the wives are selected for them
[2:15:50.160 --> 2:15:52.160]  and these groups have been happening for hundreds of years.
[2:15:52.160 --> 2:15:55.160]  And Alan, we have, just to add a point
[2:15:55.160 --> 2:15:57.160]  going back, backing you up,
[2:15:57.160 --> 2:16:01.160]  you see it in the press, you see it in sociology reports
[2:16:01.160 --> 2:16:04.160]  that in Washington D.C. and New York and London
[2:16:04.160 --> 2:16:07.160]  that the most popular place is for satomasticism
[2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:10.160]  and what all of the elitists, whenever they get caught
[2:16:10.160 --> 2:16:12.160]  in a sting or happen to get caught,
[2:16:12.160 --> 2:16:14.160]  it is hardcore satomasticism
[2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:17.160]  because you or I are a normal, nurturtive person
[2:16:17.160 --> 2:16:19.160]  that doesn't like that, they love it
[2:16:19.160 --> 2:16:21.160]  and they love dominating or being dominated
[2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:23.160]  and that interchanges, you know,
[2:16:23.160 --> 2:16:25.160]  normally goes both ways.
[2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:27.160]  And then the greatest extension of that
[2:16:27.160 --> 2:16:29.160]  is they love to torture small children to death
[2:16:29.160 --> 2:16:31.160]  because again, it's that great power
[2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:33.160]  and they love hurting something innocent.
[2:16:33.160 --> 2:16:35.160]  Would you say in these interlocking,
[2:16:35.160 --> 2:16:37.160]  when we come back, I want to go through
[2:16:37.160 --> 2:16:39.160]  from your study the different gangs we have
[2:16:39.160 --> 2:16:41.160]  that at the next to the highest level to the pyramid
[2:16:41.160 --> 2:16:43.160]  is the scientific gang
[2:16:43.160 --> 2:16:46.160]  where whoever is the most cold-blooded is who is admired
[2:16:46.160 --> 2:16:49.160]  and then above that is the elite families.
[2:16:49.160 --> 2:16:51.160]  There's no doubt, in fact, Huxley himself
[2:16:51.160 --> 2:16:55.160]  went through the whole strata of the dominant minority
[2:16:55.160 --> 2:16:58.160]  and the scientific elite who were specially bred
[2:16:58.160 --> 2:17:02.160]  including his own group to help this dominant minority.
[2:17:02.160 --> 2:17:05.160]  And then I want to get into the cloning,
[2:17:05.160 --> 2:17:07.160]  the designer babies already happening,
[2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:09.160]  the cloned cows, the cloned milk,
[2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:11.160]  they're having to put on milk that it's cloned
[2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:13.160]  or it isn't cloned.
[2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:15.160]  I mean, where this brave new world is going
[2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:17.160]  with the amazing guest Alan Watt
[2:17:17.160 --> 2:17:20.160]  on this live Friday edition,
[2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:48.160]  stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:17:48.160 --> 2:17:51.160]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[2:17:51.160 --> 2:17:55.160]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[2:17:55.160 --> 2:18:24.160]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:28.160]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:26.160]  You worry.
[2:19:26.160 --> 2:19:28.160]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[2:19:28.160 --> 2:19:30.160]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[2:19:30.160 --> 2:19:32.160]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[2:19:32.160 --> 2:19:34.160]  Your answer may be at hand.
[2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:36.160]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land
[2:19:36.160 --> 2:19:38.160]  isolated from civilization.
[2:19:38.160 --> 2:19:40.160]  She knows that as long as the sun shines,
[2:19:40.160 --> 2:19:43.160]  there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:45.160]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge
[2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:47.160]  of wild edible plants.
[2:19:47.160 --> 2:19:49.160]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[2:19:49.160 --> 2:19:52.160]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:54.160]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious
[2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:55.160]  than our modern diets.
[2:19:55.160 --> 2:19:57.160]  Well respected in her field,

[2:20:21.160 --> 2:20:24.160]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[2:20:24.160 --> 2:20:27.160]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[2:20:27.160 --> 2:20:29.160]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure
[2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:32.160]  and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:34.160]  but the symptoms are there.
[2:20:34.160 --> 2:20:37.160]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops,
[2:20:37.160 --> 2:20:39.160]  poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[2:20:39.160 --> 2:20:42.160]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:20:42.160 --> 2:20:45.160]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference
[2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:48.160]  in thousands of people's lives across America.
[2:20:48.160 --> 2:20:50.160]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[2:20:50.160 --> 2:20:52.160]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[2:20:52.160 --> 2:20:55.160]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look
[2:20:55.160 --> 2:20:57.160]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[2:20:57.160 --> 2:20:59.160]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[2:21:24.160 --> 2:21:37.160]  Music
[2:21:37.160 --> 2:21:40.160]  Okay, let's go right back to Alan Wadd.
[2:21:40.160 --> 2:21:45.160]  Breaking down
[2:21:45.160 --> 2:21:47.160]  exactly who these elite are.
[2:21:47.160 --> 2:21:49.160]  And again, they've written thousands of books
[2:21:49.160 --> 2:21:51.160]  on thousands of papers and they laugh and say,
[2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:55.160]  look at the slave scum. They can't even read
[2:21:55.160 --> 2:21:57.160]  what we're saying we're going to do to them.
[2:21:57.160 --> 2:22:00.160]  And they say that's prima facie evidence I've had
[2:22:00.160 --> 2:22:03.160]  as I know had Alan elitist say,
[2:22:03.160 --> 2:22:05.160]  Alex, look, you tell them and they don't even listen
[2:22:05.160 --> 2:22:08.160]  to you. See, you need to join us.
[2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:10.160]  And I say, listen, I'm a nurtured person.
[2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:12.160]  I know what I do to others comes back on me.
[2:22:12.160 --> 2:22:14.160]  You know, you people are evil.
[2:22:14.160 --> 2:22:16.160]  And you've helped dumb people down.
[2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:19.160]  You've accelerated the domestication
[2:22:19.160 --> 2:22:21.160]  and the institutionalization of the public.
[2:22:21.160 --> 2:22:23.160]  And this is a great crime against life,
[2:22:23.160 --> 2:22:25.160]  against our species, against humanity.
[2:22:25.160 --> 2:22:27.160]  And they just snicker.
[2:22:27.160 --> 2:22:30.160]  Or they act sad and go, well,
[2:22:30.160 --> 2:22:32.160]  you just don't know the law of nature, do you?
[2:22:32.160 --> 2:22:34.160]  We're just doing something inevitable.
[2:22:34.160 --> 2:22:37.160]  If we didn't act like this, somebody else would.
[2:22:37.160 --> 2:22:39.160]  Alan Wadd.
[2:22:39.160 --> 2:22:41.160]  Yeah, that's exactly how they rationalize it.
[2:22:41.160 --> 2:22:44.160]  As I say, through the Darwinian studies
[2:22:44.160 --> 2:22:46.160]  of different species and so on,
[2:22:46.160 --> 2:22:48.160]  they were done through the sea urchins
[2:22:48.160 --> 2:22:50.160]  and all these things in different groups
[2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:52.160]  that came down through the ages.
[2:22:52.160 --> 2:22:54.160]  They've never found missing links, but that's not the point.
[2:22:54.160 --> 2:22:57.160]  The point is, things go extinct.
[2:22:57.160 --> 2:22:59.160]  And we do have evidence of that.
[2:22:59.160 --> 2:23:01.160]  Different animals go extinct.
[2:23:01.160 --> 2:23:04.160]  So they put man in the same category.
[2:23:04.160 --> 2:23:08.160]  And they couch it in phases or stages of mankind
[2:23:08.160 --> 2:23:11.160]  from the early types to the present type.
[2:23:11.160 --> 2:23:13.160]  And they truly believe that they themselves,
[2:23:13.160 --> 2:23:15.160]  because they're up there in academia,
[2:23:15.160 --> 2:23:18.160]  they're in the sciences, they have positions of power
[2:23:18.160 --> 2:23:21.160]  and control, they believe they are a separate species
[2:23:21.160 --> 2:23:23.160]  that they have evolved.
[2:23:23.160 --> 2:23:26.160]  And the old types that used to work in factories
[2:23:26.160 --> 2:23:28.160]  and so on during the 20th century
[2:23:28.160 --> 2:23:31.160]  are now obsolete and have to go.
[2:23:31.160 --> 2:23:34.160]  And they even rationalize why they must go
[2:23:34.160 --> 2:23:38.160]  according to the laws of this Darwinian theory
[2:23:38.160 --> 2:23:41.160]  that if the old type come into the new system,
[2:23:41.160 --> 2:23:44.160]  they'll overwhelm the elite who have
[2:23:44.160 --> 2:23:49.160]  evolved even higher and bring down that high group.
[2:23:49.160 --> 2:23:51.160]  That's what they truly believe.
[2:23:51.160 --> 2:23:54.160]  This is identical to Hinduism.
[2:23:54.160 --> 2:23:56.160]  Hinduism goes through this.
[2:23:56.160 --> 2:23:58.160]  And I think that's the connecting link
[2:23:58.160 --> 2:24:02.160]  between much of higher Freemasonry
[2:24:02.160 --> 2:24:04.160]  and this New World Order.
[2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:08.160]  In Hinduism, they believe there are psychos in nature
[2:24:08.160 --> 2:24:10.160]  that last millions of years, different phases.
[2:24:10.160 --> 2:24:12.160]  They call them ages.
[2:24:12.160 --> 2:24:15.160]  And at the end of each age, those that evolve,
[2:24:15.160 --> 2:24:17.160]  remember, they start from slime into amoebas
[2:24:17.160 --> 2:24:19.160]  and through animals, through transmigration of souls
[2:24:19.160 --> 2:24:21.160]  and all this kind of stuff.
[2:24:21.160 --> 2:24:25.160]  And eventually they get to this advanced type
[2:24:25.160 --> 2:24:27.160]  and they go on into the next wave
[2:24:27.160 --> 2:24:29.160]  how the old type dies off.
[2:24:29.160 --> 2:24:31.160]  It's identical to Darwinism.
[2:24:31.160 --> 2:24:33.160]  And you have to ask yourself,
[2:24:33.160 --> 2:24:35.160]  did Darwinism come first,
[2:24:35.160 --> 2:24:38.160]  or did they simply copy the Hinduistic philosophies?
[2:24:38.160 --> 2:24:43.160]  Or the Babylonian-Mystery religions is the same thing.
[2:24:43.160 --> 2:24:45.160]  Transhumanists, on a low level,
[2:24:45.160 --> 2:24:48.160]  kind of porch transhumanists like porch masons
[2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:51.160]  don't know, or haven't read, the real dogma.
[2:24:51.160 --> 2:24:56.160]  But Aldous Huxley's brother, the head UN eugenicist,
[2:24:56.160 --> 2:24:58.160]  the head eugenicist worldwide at the time,
[2:24:58.160 --> 2:25:00.160]  he said we've got to change to transhumanism.
[2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:03.160]  So transhumanism, the founder of it says
[2:25:03.160 --> 2:25:05.160]  it is the new name for eugenics.
[2:25:05.160 --> 2:25:09.160]  And he says, and now they say at these big eugenics conferences,
[2:25:09.160 --> 2:25:11.160]  transhumanist conferences they have or posthumous,
[2:25:11.160 --> 2:25:14.160]  they say you will take brain chips,
[2:25:14.160 --> 2:25:16.160]  you will evolve into cybernetic,
[2:25:16.160 --> 2:25:18.160]  if we even let you, if you prove your worth,
[2:25:18.160 --> 2:25:21.160]  and all the rest of you will die because you're not evolving.
[2:25:21.160 --> 2:25:24.160]  And so we face it on that front.
[2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:28.160]  Yes, as I say, it's all out in the open today.
[2:25:28.160 --> 2:25:33.160]  And what's interesting too is the use of words or linguistics,
[2:25:33.160 --> 2:25:35.160]  some call it psycholinguistics,
[2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:39.160]  and some of the neuroscientists call it neurolinguistics,
[2:25:39.160 --> 2:25:45.160]  by the use of different words to cover up the same agenda,
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:47.160]  they used to be called eugenics.
[2:25:47.160 --> 2:25:49.160]  The general population are using those new words,
[2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:53.160]  thinking it's all okay, they can't relate it to what it used to mean.
[2:25:53.160 --> 2:25:56.160]  It's the same thing as having a communist society,
[2:25:56.160 --> 2:25:59.160]  and as long as no one at the top mentions communism,
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:01.160]  no one will see it for what it really is.
[2:26:01.160 --> 2:26:05.160]  So we tend to get stuck on words and we can't see beyond that.
[2:26:05.160 --> 2:26:08.160]  Today they call it this globalization,
[2:26:08.160 --> 2:26:11.160]  but it is a Soviet-tized world system they're bringing in,
[2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:14.160]  it's a communist system they're bringing in for the masses.
[2:26:14.160 --> 2:26:19.160]  Now communism or the Soviet system was created by the West,
[2:26:19.160 --> 2:26:22.160]  it did not originate in the Soviet Union or Russia.
[2:26:22.160 --> 2:26:25.160]  Its whole theory was that man was an animal that could be trained
[2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:29.160]  to go in any direction whatsoever,
[2:26:29.160 --> 2:26:32.160]  through scientific means and indoctrination,
[2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:34.160]  and using conditioned responses,
[2:26:34.160 --> 2:26:37.160]  they could take them to wherever they wanted them to be.
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:39.160]  Lenin himself said, he said,
[2:26:39.160 --> 2:26:42.160]  we shall decide what kind of culture to give the public,
[2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:44.160]  which is good for the party,
[2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:47.160]  and if that culture becomes obsolete or doesn't serve the party,
[2:26:47.160 --> 2:26:49.160]  we'll then change the entire culture again.
[2:26:49.160 --> 2:26:52.160]  In other words, all of reality will keep changing
[2:26:52.160 --> 2:26:54.160]  and be updated and the public will accept it,
[2:26:54.160 --> 2:26:57.160]  like a computer program being upgraded.
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:27:00.160]  That's exactly how they're treating the public today,
[2:27:00.160 --> 2:27:02.160]  and unfortunately it's working very well.
[2:27:02.160 --> 2:27:04.160]  Alan Watt long segment coming up.

[2:28:25.160 --> 2:28:27.160]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[2:28:27.160 --> 2:28:29.160]  I've come with a message of information.
[2:28:29.160 --> 2:28:32.160]  9-11 was an inside job.
[2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:33.160]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:28:33.160 --> 2:28:35.160]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[2:28:35.160 --> 2:28:36.160]  How do the American people know
[2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:38.160]  that 9-11 was a stage,
[2:28:38.160 --> 2:28:39.160]  was engineered by you,
[2:28:39.160 --> 2:28:41.160]  David Rockefeller, that's our latter commission,
[2:28:41.160 --> 2:28:42.160]  the CFR,
[2:28:42.160 --> 2:28:44.160]  in the sedanshut.
[2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:46.160]  The day that we stop asking questions
[2:28:46.160 --> 2:28:48.160]  is the day that we have allowed
[2:28:48.160 --> 2:28:51.160]  the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[2:28:51.160 --> 2:28:54.160]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[2:28:54.160 --> 2:28:57.160]  a global awakening has taken place.
[2:28:57.160 --> 2:28:59.160]  An inside job?
[2:28:59.160 --> 2:29:01.160]  How dare you?
[2:29:01.160 --> 2:29:05.160]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[2:29:05.160 --> 2:29:07.160]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:29:07.160 --> 2:29:10.160]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:29:10.160 --> 2:29:12.160]  And if the government has not told the truth
[2:29:12.160 --> 2:29:13.160]  in five years,
[2:29:13.160 --> 2:29:16.160]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[2:29:25.160 --> 2:29:27.160]  Do you have aches and pains,
[2:29:27.160 --> 2:29:29.160]  or suffer from indigestion or inflammation?
[2:29:29.160 --> 2:29:32.160]  Are you tired of feeling restless from insomnia?
[2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:34.160]  These symptoms are produced by negative toxins,
[2:29:34.160 --> 2:29:37.160]  but with the correct information, understanding and care,

[2:30:40.160 --> 2:30:42.160]  Alan Ward.
[2:30:42.160 --> 2:30:45.160]  Let's get into
[2:30:45.160 --> 2:30:48.160]  what the establishment is doing with genetic engineering.
[2:30:48.160 --> 2:30:51.160]  I have interviewed and, of course,
[2:30:51.160 --> 2:30:54.160]  read hundreds and hundreds of news stories and reports.
[2:30:54.160 --> 2:30:58.160]  As I know, you have top scientists in genetic engineering
[2:30:58.160 --> 2:31:00.160]  who were for it until they found out that,
[2:31:00.160 --> 2:31:03.160]  well, I changed one gene in a tomato or a potato,
[2:31:03.160 --> 2:31:05.160]  and it gets the change I want,
[2:31:05.160 --> 2:31:09.160]  but at randomly each life cycle
[2:31:09.160 --> 2:31:12.160]  changes hundreds if not thousands of things randomly
[2:31:12.160 --> 2:31:15.160]  and creates new amino acids, new chemicals,
[2:31:15.160 --> 2:31:18.160]  new components, new ring structures, new enzymes
[2:31:18.160 --> 2:31:21.160]  that are very, very toxic to other life forms
[2:31:21.160 --> 2:31:24.160]  that consume or come in contact with it.
[2:31:24.160 --> 2:31:27.160]  The establishment knows that.
[2:31:27.160 --> 2:31:30.160]  They are testing in the open ocean
[2:31:30.160 --> 2:31:33.160]  new forms of chemical-eating bacteria,
[2:31:33.160 --> 2:31:35.160]  oil-slick-eating bacteria,
[2:31:35.160 --> 2:31:38.160]  which in studies they admit could start replicating
[2:31:38.160 --> 2:31:41.160]  and could create global red tides
[2:31:41.160 --> 2:31:44.160]  that could possibly kill a lot of the life in the ocean.
[2:31:44.160 --> 2:31:45.160]  One little example.
[2:31:45.160 --> 2:31:48.160]  Or these cross-species where they put human genes in a pig
[2:31:48.160 --> 2:31:50.160]  so they can get heart valves out of it
[2:31:50.160 --> 2:31:53.160]  or grow, which they know, which they admit they're doing,
[2:31:53.160 --> 2:31:55.160]  but they keep a lot of the details quiet
[2:31:55.160 --> 2:31:56.160]  for at least a decade.
[2:31:56.160 --> 2:31:57.160]  BBC reports.
[2:31:57.160 --> 2:32:01.160]  Humanoids, part human, part bovine, part cow,
[2:32:01.160 --> 2:32:04.160]  so they can grow the embryos up to full baby size
[2:32:04.160 --> 2:32:06.160]  so they can harvest organs.
[2:32:06.160 --> 2:32:07.160]  We know that's going on.
[2:32:07.160 --> 2:32:11.160]  Part chimpanzee, part human, part human, part goat,
[2:32:11.160 --> 2:32:14.160]  part goat, part spider, or they have some transgenetic organisms
[2:32:14.160 --> 2:32:18.160]  that have over 200 different species,
[2:32:18.160 --> 2:32:21.160]  plant animal, jellyfish.
[2:32:21.160 --> 2:32:24.160]  They're selling on the open market cats that glow in the dark,
[2:32:24.160 --> 2:32:27.160]  monkeys that glow in the dark that have jellyfish skin.
[2:32:27.160 --> 2:32:29.160]  You tell the public they laugh and giggle
[2:32:29.160 --> 2:32:31.160]  and say that doesn't exist.
[2:32:31.160 --> 2:32:33.160]  But even though it's on the market,
[2:32:33.160 --> 2:32:36.160]  just thousands of things randomly going on.
[2:32:36.160 --> 2:32:39.160]  Huge facilities randomly with gene guns
[2:32:39.160 --> 2:32:42.160]  firing different genetics into plants, animals,
[2:32:42.160 --> 2:32:45.160]  sea life, openly releasing them.
[2:32:45.160 --> 2:32:47.160]  Now there's many areas of the world,
[2:32:47.160 --> 2:32:50.160]  more GMO salmon than there are the other salmon.
[2:32:50.160 --> 2:32:52.160]  They're now out competing them, removing them,
[2:32:52.160 --> 2:32:54.160]  and then they have breeding problems,
[2:32:54.160 --> 2:32:57.160]  and then it shows down the line have genetic problems
[2:32:57.160 --> 2:33:01.160]  after so many replications, after so many life cycles.
[2:33:01.160 --> 2:33:03.160]  I mean, there's just millions of problems.
[2:33:03.160 --> 2:33:06.160]  I could go on for hours, and the elite are not gods.
[2:33:06.160 --> 2:33:08.160]  They know this stuff can get out of control,
[2:33:08.160 --> 2:33:10.160]  and I have some of these quotes in in-game,
[2:33:10.160 --> 2:33:12.160]  top transhumanist, top globalist saying,
[2:33:12.160 --> 2:33:14.160]  we don't care.
[2:33:14.160 --> 2:33:17.160]  In fact, if we get bored, we may just nuke the planet
[2:33:17.160 --> 2:33:19.160]  because of the power of killing ourselves
[2:33:19.160 --> 2:33:21.160]  and destroying the species forever.
[2:33:21.160 --> 2:33:23.160]  It's so beautiful.
[2:33:23.160 --> 2:33:25.160]  And Lenin said, you know, I would love to just,
[2:33:25.160 --> 2:33:27.160]  he would write poems about destroying the earth
[2:33:27.160 --> 2:33:29.160]  and killing everyone, how beautiful it would be.
[2:33:29.160 --> 2:33:31.160]  So really, they're not survival of the fittest.
[2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:33.160]  A true fittest would understand the species,
[2:33:33.160 --> 2:33:35.160]  have love for it, would have compassion,
[2:33:35.160 --> 2:33:39.160]  would be endowed, you know, that strain of our species
[2:33:39.160 --> 2:33:45.160]  with understanding how dangerous this all is,
[2:33:45.160 --> 2:33:49.160]  moving carefully with it, trying to empower everyone,
[2:33:49.160 --> 2:33:53.160]  trying to lift the species to a higher level peacefully,
[2:33:53.160 --> 2:33:55.160]  trying to colonize space instead of dumbing down,
[2:33:55.160 --> 2:33:57.160]  hoarding, controlling, poisoning,
[2:33:57.160 --> 2:33:59.160]  and endangering the entire biosphere,
[2:33:59.160 --> 2:34:01.160]  and that's a long two-minute question.
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:04.160]  Specifically, you know, with that whole field of information,
[2:34:04.160 --> 2:34:08.160]  I see them as actually very aberrant and self-destructive
[2:34:08.160 --> 2:34:10.160]  and in their own words, they admit that.
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:12.160]  So they need to be removed from power right now.
[2:34:12.160 --> 2:34:14.160]  They're mid-level servants who are just into the power trip
[2:34:14.160 --> 2:34:16.160]  of killing 90% and running things.
[2:34:16.160 --> 2:34:18.160]  I don't think they've studied their own master's blueprint
[2:34:18.160 --> 2:34:20.160]  that really at the end of the day,
[2:34:20.160 --> 2:34:22.160]  they just want to kill everybody, including themselves.
[2:34:22.160 --> 2:34:27.160]  It's possible, but what I've also noticed too for many years
[2:34:27.160 --> 2:34:32.160]  is that whatever's released to the public to do with science
[2:34:32.160 --> 2:34:37.160]  is generally obsolete by the time we get a hold of the information.
[2:34:37.160 --> 2:34:40.160]  There's a much higher level of science that they can...
[2:34:40.160 --> 2:34:43.160]  But when you understand that Huxley himself
[2:34:43.160 --> 2:34:48.160]  wrote Brave New World in 1933 with all of that data to do with genes
[2:34:48.160 --> 2:34:54.160]  and so on, long before they really discovered the genes we are told,
[2:34:54.160 --> 2:34:57.160]  they were still teaching in the 70s, the 60s and the 70s,
[2:34:57.160 --> 2:35:01.160]  in medicine that they suspected that genes lived on chromosomes,
[2:35:01.160 --> 2:35:03.160]  but they couldn't prove it.
[2:35:03.160 --> 2:35:06.160]  And here's Huxley writing in 1933 about a science
[2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:12.160]  that had not even come in at that time in the general university.
[2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:16.160]  In mass drugging of the public and forced abortions and total control,
[2:35:16.160 --> 2:35:18.160]  what they're now setting up, go ahead.
[2:35:18.160 --> 2:35:23.160]  And at the same point, when you break it down to genes
[2:35:23.160 --> 2:35:26.160]  to do with the human genome project,
[2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:30.160]  basically that thing was on the go once again
[2:35:30.160 --> 2:35:33.160]  before they were so advanced in understanding the genes.
[2:35:33.160 --> 2:35:35.160]  So who is telling the truth?
[2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:37.160]  The ones who are doing the research at the bottom
[2:35:37.160 --> 2:35:41.160]  and learning it all over again are a much higher group above them
[2:35:41.160 --> 2:35:43.160]  that already knows all of this stuff.
[2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:45.160]  And what we find with the elite too,
[2:35:45.160 --> 2:35:49.160]  they have incredible faith, absolute faith in their own ingenuity
[2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:54.160]  and with the use of science, they believe they can go on forever and definitely.
[2:35:54.160 --> 2:35:58.160]  And I think that at a very high level, they've ironed all of these problems out.
[2:35:58.160 --> 2:36:01.160]  They talk about reseeding the planet if need be.
[2:36:01.160 --> 2:36:06.160]  They have warehouses, warehouses where they have all the genes
[2:36:06.160 --> 2:36:09.160]  of the entire planet of plant, insects, animal, and so on.
[2:36:09.160 --> 2:36:13.160]  So they have the giant underground labyrinths that they admit they have.
[2:36:13.160 --> 2:36:16.160]  Lord knows what they have that we're not aware of.
[2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:17.160]  And so they're prepared for that.
[2:36:17.160 --> 2:36:21.160]  And that may be even in their plan is to wreck everything to then rebuild it.
[2:36:21.160 --> 2:36:22.160]  It could very well be.
[2:36:22.160 --> 2:36:25.160]  I remember watching one of the Star Trek movies.
[2:36:25.160 --> 2:36:30.160]  And remember, Gene Roddenberry was a member of NASA.
[2:36:30.160 --> 2:36:31.160]  The Genesis Project.
[2:36:31.160 --> 2:36:33.160]  The Genesis Project, yeah.
[2:36:33.160 --> 2:36:37.160]  And he was also a member of the First Earth Army to start the greening process
[2:36:37.160 --> 2:36:40.160]  for conservation and really to conserve humans.
[2:36:40.160 --> 2:36:44.160]  And so he wrote it into that.
[2:36:44.160 --> 2:36:47.160]  And they had one episode in one of the movie versions
[2:36:47.160 --> 2:36:49.160]  where they called it the Genesis Project,
[2:36:49.160 --> 2:36:53.160]  where they receded the whole planet and started it off from scratch.
[2:36:53.160 --> 2:36:57.160]  And these characters didn't dream up this stuff.
[2:36:57.160 --> 2:36:59.160]  They already had plans to do this kind of thing
[2:36:59.160 --> 2:37:01.160]  if they needed to do it on planet Earth itself.
[2:37:01.160 --> 2:37:06.160]  And I am certain that if by some fluke they don't get their way
[2:37:06.160 --> 2:37:10.160]  because they do hold all the powers or the reins of power across the planet today,
[2:37:10.160 --> 2:37:14.160]  if they don't get their way, they will have something up their sleeves
[2:37:14.160 --> 2:37:18.160]  where they would go ahead and pull this off
[2:37:18.160 --> 2:37:21.160]  because they truly have utter faith in their own ability
[2:37:21.160 --> 2:37:25.160]  and acquired knowledge of sciences that's hidden from the public.
[2:37:25.160 --> 2:37:29.160]  We get obsolete stuff at the bottom level.
[2:37:29.160 --> 2:37:31.160]  That's why they call it research.
[2:37:31.160 --> 2:37:33.160]  It's been done before at a higher level.
[2:37:33.160 --> 2:37:35.160]  We'll take Ian Fleming.
[2:37:35.160 --> 2:37:37.160]  I mentioned this yesterday.
[2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:40.160]  In the early 50s, he writes his second book, James Bond Moonraker,
[2:37:40.160 --> 2:37:43.160]  where the elite are going to kill everybody,
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:45.160]  go to a space station and then come back
[2:37:45.160 --> 2:37:47.160]  and after the biological weapons, kill everyone
[2:37:47.160 --> 2:37:50.160]  and reseat with the eugenics superculture.
[2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:54.160]  This is a high-level MI6 agent, OSS agent.
[2:37:54.160 --> 2:38:00.160]  And then now their newest James Bond is where there's a fake global environmental group
[2:38:00.160 --> 2:38:04.160]  using fake carbon taxes to bring in a world tyranny.
[2:38:04.160 --> 2:38:06.160]  They're just flaunting it in our face.
[2:38:06.160 --> 2:38:08.160]  Yes, they are flaunting it in our face.
[2:38:08.160 --> 2:38:10.160]  And it's interesting.
[2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:14.160]  The World Wildlife Fund has what they call three arcs on the planet.
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:16.160]  One of them is in Louisiana.
[2:38:16.160 --> 2:38:20.160]  And in there, they have cryogenics with, again,
[2:38:20.160 --> 2:38:25.160]  every possible gene from every possible animal, insect, et cetera,
[2:38:25.160 --> 2:38:27.160]  in those particular arcs.
[2:38:27.160 --> 2:38:31.160]  And they said, and this program is a public broadcasting program
[2:38:31.160 --> 2:38:35.160]  with a professor who's in charge of that particular one arc.
[2:38:35.160 --> 2:38:36.160]  She said there's three.
[2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:39.160]  That this will be used if anything happened to planet Earth.
[2:38:39.160 --> 2:38:42.160]  They can reseed the planet with everything that they have there.
[2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:44.160]  And they've tested this stuff out.
[2:38:44.160 --> 2:38:48.160]  They've brought ovum and sperm together from different creatures.
[2:38:48.160 --> 2:38:51.160]  And they've inserted them into other types of creatures
[2:38:51.160 --> 2:38:54.160]  and successfully brought them to term.
[2:38:54.160 --> 2:38:59.160]  So they can literally breed any kind of animal or even a human
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:02.160]  inside another animal if need be and bring it to term
[2:39:02.160 --> 2:39:08.160]  after being stored in cryogenics for who knows how long.
[2:39:08.160 --> 2:39:11.160]  So we're talking about dolphins with human brains.
[2:39:11.160 --> 2:39:14.160]  It's endless.
[2:39:14.160 --> 2:39:16.160]  Well, I agree with what you just said.
[2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:20.160]  I believe that, well, we know that they're at least 30, 40 years ahead
[2:39:20.160 --> 2:39:21.160]  and that's exponential.
[2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:24.160]  And so that's why they're so arrogant now.
[2:39:24.160 --> 2:39:28.160]  In the time frame, how do you see them with the soft kill weapons?
[2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:32.160]  They've already turned up the ambient background with the soft kill weapons
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:36.160]  with the cancer viruses, with the barium and aluminum
[2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:41.160]  spraying on the public with their operations worldwide.
[2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:45.160]  Go through the next 10 years and then out.
[2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:48.160]  And I understand this is a projection from your deep research.
[2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:52.160]  But I've done my separate research and that's what I'm always so impressed with
[2:39:52.160 --> 2:39:55.160]  is that you're always on the same line and even bring it further in many cases.
[2:39:55.160 --> 2:39:57.160]  That's why we're so honored to have you, Alan.
[2:39:57.160 --> 2:39:59.160]  I just really respect your intellect and research on this
[2:39:59.160 --> 2:40:05.160]  because I've come to the same organic analysis as you are here with my discernment.
[2:40:05.160 --> 2:40:09.160]  And discernment is really just your full mind capacity,
[2:40:09.160 --> 2:40:13.160]  the electrochemical computer you have listeners integrating all the information.
[2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:16.160]  And of course, their own statements.
[2:40:16.160 --> 2:40:21.160]  Break down specifically when you believe they'll start mass plagues
[2:40:21.160 --> 2:40:26.160]  or smaller plagues to get us hurt into cities to train us to live under total control
[2:40:26.160 --> 2:40:31.160]  into more of a THX1138 type system, rats in the cage.
[2:40:31.160 --> 2:40:35.160]  And then when do the mass cults come and will they use neutron bombs
[2:40:35.160 --> 2:40:40.160]  as the Ministry of Defense says they may or will they use special race-specific weapons
[2:40:40.160 --> 2:40:43.160]  blaming on imaginary terror groups and caves?
[2:40:43.160 --> 2:40:48.160]  And how will these phases unfold and in what time frame for the,
[2:40:48.160 --> 2:40:50.160]  I always said 80% extermination.
[2:40:50.160 --> 2:40:51.160]  That's in the public documents.
[2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:53.160]  Now they're in the newest documents saying,
[2:40:53.160 --> 2:40:55.160]  well, really it's 99%.
[2:40:55.160 --> 2:40:57.160]  We just told our underlings 80%.
[2:40:57.160 --> 2:41:00.160]  It's really we're going to kill 99% of people.
[2:41:00.160 --> 2:41:02.160]  So go ahead.
[2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:03.160]  Yes.
[2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:10.160]  When you go into the records of the think tanks that advise NATO,
[2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:15.160]  for instance, and the US military as well, they're identical.
[2:41:15.160 --> 2:41:16.160]  They're all identical.
[2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:18.160]  All the projections for the future.
[2:41:18.160 --> 2:41:22.160]  And this starts really with a statement right after 9-11, 2001,
[2:41:22.160 --> 2:41:25.160]  where they said this will be a hundred years war.
[2:41:25.160 --> 2:41:27.160]  And everyone was shaking their head saying, well,
[2:41:27.160 --> 2:41:29.160]  why would it take a hundred years to finish off the Middle East?
[2:41:29.160 --> 2:41:31.160]  They weren't talking about the Middle East.
[2:41:31.160 --> 2:41:35.160]  They were talking about a long-term strategy plan for the entire planet.
[2:41:35.160 --> 2:41:40.160]  And these think tanks in their own records will always use history.
[2:41:40.160 --> 2:41:42.160]  They'll tell you where they get their ideas from.
[2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:47.160]  They go back into the Middle Ages where they had plagues rampaging
[2:41:47.160 --> 2:41:49.160]  across the whole of Europe.
[2:41:49.160 --> 2:41:52.160]  But during those plague times too, when many people were dying,
[2:41:52.160 --> 2:41:57.160]  millions of people died, they also had incredible wars going on at the same time.
[2:41:57.160 --> 2:42:01.160]  And the effects on the general populations were studied even then,
[2:42:01.160 --> 2:42:05.160]  often by monks who did the documentation,
[2:42:05.160 --> 2:42:08.160]  to see the effects on the public who were truly mind-bombed.
[2:42:08.160 --> 2:42:11.160]  They were so afraid that the plague was going to get them.
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:14.160]  So much so, they'd allow armies to march through
[2:42:14.160 --> 2:42:17.160]  and pillage their food from them and their livestock, etc.
[2:42:17.160 --> 2:42:21.160]  And so when you see what they've dreamed up in their documentation
[2:42:21.160 --> 2:42:26.160]  as a projection for the next 30 to 100 years for the military,
[2:42:26.160 --> 2:42:28.160]  it ties right in with that.
[2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:35.160]  They say that they expect starting around 2010, 2012,
[2:42:35.160 --> 2:42:40.160]  we will be a global society, the factor will be signed into law.
[2:42:40.160 --> 2:42:45.160]  But then the plagues are coming, they expect them to come.
[2:42:45.160 --> 2:42:48.160]  So we'll have plagues just like the Middle Ages, pandemics.
[2:42:48.160 --> 2:42:54.160]  Now, pandemics are ideal for bringing down a population of even the whole world,
[2:42:54.160 --> 2:42:59.160]  but not too suddenly because a pandemic can be contained within an area,
[2:42:59.160 --> 2:43:04.160]  it can die off and reappear two or three years later and kill off more in the same area.
[2:43:04.160 --> 2:43:06.160]  So it's a long-term takedown.
[2:43:06.160 --> 2:43:10.160]  That way, the people who are alive can bury the dead, it's not untidy,
[2:43:10.160 --> 2:43:12.160]  they're all out of sight, etc.
[2:43:12.160 --> 2:43:15.160]  So we clean up our own mess as we die off.
[2:43:15.160 --> 2:43:19.160]  And at the same time, they expect that there's going to be massive food shortages,
[2:43:19.160 --> 2:43:22.160]  which they had again in the Middle Ages.
[2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:27.160]  And in the Middle Ages, where you had various armies competing with each other
[2:43:27.160 --> 2:43:30.160]  and kings for power in different countries,
[2:43:30.160 --> 2:43:36.160]  you're going to have a global society here where the people will be revolting for lack of food
[2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:42.160]  because the food supply of the world is now tied up into about five corporations' hands.
[2:43:42.160 --> 2:43:45.160]  And we know the United Nations, under their own mandate,
[2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:49.160]  and the Department of Agriculture say that they will be responsible
[2:43:49.160 --> 2:43:52.160]  for doing out the food to every nation.
[2:43:52.160 --> 2:43:55.160]  And part of that will be to keep down the populations.
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:43:58.160]  If your population increases, they will not increase the food supply.
[2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:03.160]  But what you're going to find is once they give you a quota for maximum population,
[2:44:03.160 --> 2:44:06.160]  the next year they're going to down that quota again.
[2:44:06.160 --> 2:44:09.160]  We know we're told you this, but there's not enough food to go around,
[2:44:09.160 --> 2:44:11.160]  so you have to bring down your population.
[2:44:11.160 --> 2:44:16.160]  So each country will be up to them to bring down their numbers one way or another.
[2:44:16.160 --> 2:44:21.160]  And at the same time that's happening, you're going to have a world military
[2:44:21.160 --> 2:44:27.160]  managing the riots to do with food primarily and lack of necessities and medicines and so on.
[2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:30.160]  And they're prepared to use neutron bombs.
[2:44:30.160 --> 2:44:36.160]  So it's almost an update of the Middle Ages that they're bringing into effect.
[2:44:36.160 --> 2:44:39.160]  It worked then, and they believe it will work again.
[2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:48.160]  And they believe that by the year 2030, we'll pretty well be all died off one way or another.
[2:44:48.160 --> 2:44:52.160]  Most of us apparently are sterile already, or almost so.
[2:44:52.160 --> 2:44:56.160]  And they believe then that China will start to decline massively
[2:44:56.160 --> 2:45:02.160]  because even now I think their population is two to three or three males to every one female
[2:45:02.160 --> 2:45:07.160]  because they're encouraging and fantasizing they're mainly on the female.
[2:45:07.160 --> 2:45:09.160]  And therefore they themselves will start to decline.
[2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:15.160]  And because once they're on the westernized food and inoculations, they will also start to become sterile.
[2:45:15.160 --> 2:45:25.160]  So within another, say, 2030 to 2050, 2060, the population of China will be drastically reduced as well.
[2:45:25.160 --> 2:45:28.160]  So this is how they see the whole plan working out.
[2:45:28.160 --> 2:45:35.160]  And then they tie in the transhumanism agenda where they'll bring out a new type to serve them.
[2:45:35.160 --> 2:45:41.160]  No doubt grow their own food for those who are left for the elites themselves, natural food, of course.
[2:45:41.160 --> 2:45:46.160]  But a new type of human who will get them no problems whatsoever,
[2:45:46.160 --> 2:45:51.160]  they'll be manufactured humans with no ability to think as a separate individual.
[2:45:51.160 --> 2:45:56.160]  They'll be a type of herd animal or hive animal, as they call it in their own words.
[2:45:56.160 --> 2:45:58.160]  And they'll be very, very efficient.
[2:45:58.160 --> 2:46:03.160]  And they can also be programmed to do different jobs because they'll also be part of Cyborg.
[2:46:03.160 --> 2:46:06.160]  That's really what they believe at the top.
[2:46:06.160 --> 2:46:11.160]  And this is through all the records of academia to do with transhumanism.
[2:46:11.160 --> 2:46:13.160]  That's what I wanted to add.
[2:46:13.160 --> 2:46:16.160]  They are, and will continue, they're sucking the youth in.
[2:46:16.160 --> 2:46:23.160]  And the Army said this, as you know, decades ago, declassified in 2001, in February.
[2:46:23.160 --> 2:46:30.160]  They said, we're going to use hype, video games, culture to literally get the young people to want to be wire heads.
[2:46:30.160 --> 2:46:35.160]  And they'll rebel against mom and dad and say, hey, there's a law, I'm allowed to be augmented.
[2:46:35.160 --> 2:46:41.160]  And then the Washington Post admits that the corporations are getting the children ready to rebel,
[2:46:41.160 --> 2:46:43.160]  the teenagers, to take the augmentation.
[2:46:43.160 --> 2:46:48.160]  And then now one of the most famous video game company owners and inventors came out and said,
[2:46:48.160 --> 2:46:53.160]  yes, soon you'll need to be augmented with chips in your body to even play our game.
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:56.160]  And the young people are already in their Sims reality.
[2:46:56.160 --> 2:46:59.160]  There are, you know, 20 million people in the world of Warcraft.
[2:46:59.160 --> 2:47:01.160]  This is their reality.
[2:47:01.160 --> 2:47:03.160]  And so they're already being inserted into it.
[2:47:03.160 --> 2:47:12.160]  The Army said, we're going to use Xboxes now, the very platform to have the teenagers fly our Predator drones.
[2:47:12.160 --> 2:47:19.160]  And so they'll just sit there having fun, dehumanizing, killing people, playing real games on an Xbox platform,
[2:47:19.160 --> 2:47:21.160]  hooked into the Predator drones.
[2:47:21.160 --> 2:47:24.160]  And then now they're at the malls with these huge video game displays.
[2:47:24.160 --> 2:47:31.160]  The Army, that's in the news today all over the country, showing them simulated battle attacks or recordings of it,
[2:47:31.160 --> 2:47:38.160]  of real attacks to teach them how much fun it is to be involved there piloting the robotic craft
[2:47:38.160 --> 2:47:41.160]  and the entire military by 2012 with the aircraft.
[2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:45.160]  The attack craft is converting into drones.
[2:47:45.160 --> 2:47:52.160]  And then, of course, the humans are phased out because a tiny elite can then program the entire military apparatus
[2:47:52.160 --> 2:48:01.160]  that is serviced in these giant aircraft carrier-sized land-based, ground-based, air-based repair centers that are robotic
[2:48:01.160 --> 2:48:06.160]  with basic human technicians that upkeep it to where the elite can just punch a button
[2:48:06.160 --> 2:48:08.160]  and launch giant attacks against countries.
[2:48:08.160 --> 2:48:11.160]  And it won't matter if the troops even said no.
[2:48:11.160 --> 2:48:16.160]  So literal godlike powers now being seated into the hands of the elite.
[2:48:16.160 --> 2:48:18.160]  Alan Watts, stay there.
[2:48:18.160 --> 2:48:20.160]  We're going to come back and get into the carbon footprint.
[2:48:20.160 --> 2:48:25.160]  The social youth brigades that are going to be in all your homes, just the absolute enslavement.
[2:48:50.160 --> 2:48:56.160]  This is a stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[2:48:56.160 --> 2:49:00.160]  Finally, drinking water that you control, I use one every day.
[2:49:00.160 --> 2:49:06.160]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services and storing five gallon bottles of water in your home.
[2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:12.160]  The Akola Blue 28 is shipped right to your home, ready to make close to seven gallons a day right out of the box.
[2:49:12.160 --> 2:49:14.160]  They have a 30-day money-back guarantee.

[2:49:25.160 --> 2:49:32.160]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:49:32.160 --> 2:49:36.160]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:49:36.160 --> 2:49:37.160]  Bin Laden.
[2:49:37.160 --> 2:49:38.160]  This is his MO.
[2:49:38.160 --> 2:49:41.160]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:49:41.160 --> 2:49:48.160]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:49:48.160 --> 2:49:55.160]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:49:55.160 --> 2:49:59.160]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:49:59.160 --> 2:50:06.160]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:50:06.160 --> 2:50:13.160]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more, fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com
[2:50:13.160 --> 2:50:18.160]  or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:50:18.160 --> 2:50:37.160]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:50:48.160 --> 2:50:53.160]  For more details, visit gardeninacan.com today.
[2:50:53.160 --> 2:51:22.160]  Or call 866-598-7396-866-598-7396.
[2:51:23.160 --> 2:51:52.160]  I'm sorry to some out there who are laughing at us right now, who've been neutralized psychologically by the controllers.
[2:51:52.160 --> 2:52:05.160]  Because your own false identity that you've been constructed for you is what you believe is your intellect or your being is a false construct.
[2:52:05.160 --> 2:52:10.160]  So you can't go against who you believe you are. You have to deny what we're saying.
[2:52:10.160 --> 2:52:19.160]  It's all documented because you feel like your own enslavement is your soul.
[2:52:19.160 --> 2:52:24.160]  That's very sad because we need to try to avert this. We need to try to reverse this.
[2:52:24.160 --> 2:52:29.160]  We have a limited window in time, in my opinion, to reverse what's happening.
[2:52:29.160 --> 2:52:39.160]  Alan, what digressing for a moment do you think we are in that limited window and I'm going to give them the solutions later
[2:52:39.160 --> 2:52:45.160]  and then be continuing with the phasing out of humanity?
[2:52:45.160 --> 2:52:52.160]  I think we're well underway. We didn't know that we were being sterilized until reports came out.
[2:52:52.160 --> 2:52:58.160]  The reports have had for 50 years to actually count. So we get them used 50 years later.
[2:52:58.160 --> 2:53:04.160]  This is how things are done. We're the last to be told any truth, or at least even the effects of the truth.
[2:53:04.160 --> 2:53:10.160]  And they're well on their way to their objective. We're watching them go through this financial nonsense.
[2:53:10.160 --> 2:53:15.160]  This is the power of the purse, the last thing to be used to unite the whole planet.
[2:53:15.160 --> 2:53:20.160]  And because we're all on the one economic system, we know no other way.
[2:53:20.160 --> 2:53:25.160]  This is all we've been given. This is all we can remember for a couple of thousand years.
[2:53:25.160 --> 2:53:29.160]  Then there seems to be no way out of it.
[2:53:29.160 --> 2:53:36.160]  So the power of the purse is going to force everyone along into the next phase of control.
[2:53:36.160 --> 2:53:41.160]  Money is used, remember, mainly as a tool by the elites. They don't need money.
[2:53:41.160 --> 2:53:47.160]  They already own everything technically. They don't have to carry cash with them or even credit cards.
[2:53:47.160 --> 2:53:52.160]  Doors open wherever they go. But money is the trick to control the people
[2:53:52.160 --> 2:53:56.160]  and to get us to work along with their system, for their system.
[2:53:56.160 --> 2:53:59.160]  Eventually they won't even need that.
[2:53:59.160 --> 2:54:06.160]  With part of the phase on the way to the elimination of money for their brave new worlds,
[2:54:06.160 --> 2:54:09.160]  will be a credit system that will come in for every citizen.
[2:54:09.160 --> 2:54:16.160]  And Bertrand Russell talked about this back in the 1950s, where the government in collusion with the banks
[2:54:16.160 --> 2:54:22.160]  will directly give you into your account every week a deposit which you cannot save up.
[2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:25.160]  So it starts at the same figure every Monday.
[2:54:25.160 --> 2:54:30.160]  And if you go against the system, you don't behave in a certain way or whatever.
[2:54:30.160 --> 2:54:34.160]  They will hold back your credits. You can't pay your rents and so on.
[2:54:34.160 --> 2:54:37.160]  And this is going to be used as a form of social control.
[2:54:37.160 --> 2:54:41.160]  So we see with this present government bank merger system that's coming in,
[2:54:41.160 --> 2:54:46.160]  that's right on with the agenda, and the government will eventually be right into your account.
[2:54:46.160 --> 2:54:50.160]  And they will use it as a tool to control you.
[2:54:50.160 --> 2:54:55.160]  Maybe a bad boy, no more money for a few weeks until you bend the knee.
[2:54:55.160 --> 2:55:01.160]  And this is coming in, and I'm certain this is what's going to come out of this whole globalized monetary system they're bringing in right now.
[2:55:01.160 --> 2:55:05.160]  And again, they create all the crises. They release the biological agents, then they offer the solution.
[2:55:05.160 --> 2:55:08.160]  They engineer the economic crisis, they offer the solution.
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:12.160]  They slip in the Chinese slave goods out of China, and then they say,
[2:55:12.160 --> 2:55:16.160]  okay, we passed a law that nobody in America can weave clothes for their children,
[2:55:16.160 --> 2:55:20.160]  and we're banning any production and textiles in the U.S. or anywhere else,
[2:55:20.160 --> 2:55:25.160]  unless it's certified by the government, which then knocks out all the good clothes made properly
[2:55:25.160 --> 2:55:29.160]  to where we can only have the GMO cotton and the bad stuff from India and China.
[2:55:29.160 --> 2:55:34.160]  I mean, it's all happening. We see them raiding watermelon farms that are selling watermelons,
[2:55:34.160 --> 2:55:37.160]  or raiding people selling milk, or raiding people selling eggs.
[2:55:37.160 --> 2:55:43.160]  They're obsessed with shutting down any grassroots agrarian self-sufficient societies,
[2:55:43.160 --> 2:55:46.160]  which shows that's one of their weak points, isn't it?
[2:55:46.160 --> 2:55:49.160]  It is one of their weak points indeed, yes.
[2:55:49.160 --> 2:55:54.160]  Back in 70 Seconds, Adam, let's talk about that and talk about solutions and things we can do to fight this,
[2:55:54.160 --> 2:55:59.160]  and I want to get into chemtrails with you and our carbon footprint, how that's going to be controlled.
[2:55:59.160 --> 2:56:04.160]  And then we'll go to your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen, final hour straight ahead.
[2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:09.160]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:56:09.160 --> 2:56:13.160]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:56:39.160 --> 2:56:42.160]  Welcome to GCNLive.
[2:57:09.160 --> 2:57:16.160]  All right, final hour on this final broadcast of this week, first week of the new year.
[2:57:16.160 --> 2:57:45.160]  We're back live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., and of course, next week for a few of the days Jason Mermas is here in town.
[2:57:45.160 --> 2:57:50.160]  He'll be sitting in with a lot of important and informative guests coming up.
[2:57:50.160 --> 2:57:54.160]  Now, I want to go back to Alan Watt.
[2:57:54.160 --> 2:57:58.160]  Alan, we've been having riveting and formative discussion here.
[2:57:58.160 --> 2:58:00.160]  People that say we're being negative, we're not.
[2:58:00.160 --> 2:58:02.160]  It's like looking out your window and seeing a storm coming in.
[2:58:02.160 --> 2:58:03.160]  So he says, what's the weather?
[2:58:03.160 --> 2:58:04.160]  Oh, a storm's coming in.
[2:58:04.160 --> 2:58:07.160]  Oh, don't be negative.
[2:58:07.160 --> 2:58:11.160]  All we're doing is covering the facts here, the reality.
[2:58:11.160 --> 2:58:18.160]  You alluded about 15 minutes ago to the carbon footprint, the allotted amount of cred you'll have on your card.
[2:58:18.160 --> 2:58:20.160]  All of this is admitted.
[2:58:20.160 --> 2:58:25.160]  Even if you, quote, have wealth, you won't be able to spend it because it'll be past your carbon footprint.
[2:58:25.160 --> 2:58:30.160]  And then, of course, that will all be selectively enforced.
[2:58:30.160 --> 2:58:35.160]  I mean, this is the total controlled society with the technology to try to carry it out.
[2:58:35.160 --> 2:58:39.160]  So can you speak more about life under the carbon footprint, which they're now bringing in?
[2:58:39.160 --> 2:58:43.160]  Obama says you'll have weekly, monthly visits to your farm, your home.
[2:58:43.160 --> 2:58:51.160]  You'll get special permits to do any changes to your house, cows, $170 tax, soda, you know,
[2:58:51.160 --> 2:58:55.160]  but then all foods, satellite boxes in all your cars, taxing it as you drive.
[2:58:55.160 --> 2:58:57.160]  They're now saying it all.
[2:58:57.160 --> 2:59:01.160]  Everything we warned people about that was in the planning documents we saw decades ago.
[2:59:01.160 --> 2:59:07.160]  We're now here in this continuum from the early elites forming in the side of a dictatorship
[2:59:07.160 --> 2:59:10.160]  several thousand years ago to now.
[2:59:10.160 --> 2:59:14.160]  How far along on that continuum towards what they believe is their in-game are we?
[2:59:14.160 --> 2:59:16.160]  Are we 80% there, 90% there?
[2:59:16.160 --> 2:59:18.160]  I think we're probably 90% there.
[2:59:18.160 --> 2:59:21.160]  That's why it is in the open now.
[2:59:21.160 --> 2:59:23.160]  And they're not really concerned.
[2:59:23.160 --> 2:59:27.160]  They have all of the classes they need.
[2:59:27.160 --> 2:59:30.160]  It's mainly academia on their side.
[2:59:30.160 --> 2:59:34.160]  They fund so many of the big corporations.
[2:59:34.160 --> 2:59:39.160]  Even with the bailouts, the corporations must do as they're told as well and go along with this.
[2:59:39.160 --> 2:59:45.160]  Everyone is being paid off, bought off, or simply blackmailed to go along with this whole agenda.
[2:59:45.160 --> 2:59:48.160]  And it's the academia that does it willingly.
[2:59:48.160 --> 2:59:51.160]  So they're not bothered about the general public whatsoever.
[2:59:51.160 --> 2:59:55.160]  In fact, the general public are still watching all the trivia that's doled out to them,
[2:59:55.160 --> 2:59:59.160]  as they said they do, to keep them happy and entertained.
[2:59:59.160 --> 3:00:03.160]  But you're quite right with this whole carbon thing.
[3:00:03.160 --> 3:00:06.160]  See, man is the problem according to them.
[3:00:06.160 --> 3:00:08.160]  There's too many of us.
[3:00:08.160 --> 3:00:13.160]  And everything that we need or use gives off carbon in the manufacturing,
[3:00:13.160 --> 3:00:17.160]  even down to creating a house for you to live in is a problem.
[3:00:17.160 --> 3:00:20.160]  And that's another way they're getting people off the land.
[3:00:20.160 --> 3:00:25.160]  They started voluntary programs to come in and test your house from the government.
[3:00:25.160 --> 3:00:29.160]  The government put so much money towards you, re-insulating it, etc.
[3:00:29.160 --> 3:00:34.160]  That scheme was to get us all used to the idea of government coming in and testing our houses
[3:00:34.160 --> 3:00:38.160]  to see if they were worthy enough to stand up or be knocked down.
[3:00:38.160 --> 3:00:40.160]  And eventually that would become mandatory.
[3:00:40.160 --> 3:00:45.160]  They want the people off the land according to Agenda 21, the United Nations program,
[3:00:45.160 --> 3:00:48.160]  into these big overcrowded cities.
[3:00:48.160 --> 3:00:50.160]  And that's where they plan to contain us.
[3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:57.160]  That ties right in with why they have not been upgrading the main cities for many, many years.
[3:00:57.160 --> 3:00:59.160]  They've been a mess. The roads are a mess.
[3:00:59.160 --> 3:01:05.160]  They admitted in Toronto, for instance, that they're almost cheaper to build a brand-new city
[3:01:05.160 --> 3:01:10.160]  than to fix the sewage systems, the roads, and so on,
[3:01:10.160 --> 3:01:13.160]  than to be easier to start from scratch.
[3:01:13.160 --> 3:01:16.160]  In other words, they don't intend to maintain those cities.
[3:01:16.160 --> 3:01:21.160]  These have to be simply to contain the public for a period of 30 to 40 years
[3:01:21.160 --> 3:01:25.160]  until the public are pretty well all dead and gone.
[3:01:25.160 --> 3:01:29.160]  Now, the whole carbon idea came up from a big think tank
[3:01:29.160 --> 3:01:33.160]  that works with all the other big think tanks, well-funded, interconnected with them.
[3:01:33.160 --> 3:01:35.160]  And that's a club of Rome.
[3:01:35.160 --> 3:01:39.160]  And the founders of the club of Rome wrote a book in the 1990s.
[3:01:39.160 --> 3:01:44.160]  They said in the 1970s they were the ones who came up with the idea
[3:01:44.160 --> 3:01:50.160]  to unite the planet and claim that mankind was having a war on the earth itself.
[3:01:50.160 --> 3:01:55.160]  And therefore, man was the problem and he came up with the whole idea of the carbon.
[3:01:55.160 --> 3:01:58.160]  And it's a sick joke because we're a carbon-based light form.
[3:01:58.160 --> 3:02:03.160]  Everything on this planet is carbon-based, and they're saying it's going to be a toxic waste,
[3:02:03.160 --> 3:02:06.160]  but all their genetic engineering, all their toxic waste dumping, that's okay.
[3:02:06.160 --> 3:02:11.160]  It's only carbon dioxide and other gases that come off of life forms,
[3:02:11.160 --> 3:02:13.160]  which is all part of the life cycle.
[3:02:13.160 --> 3:02:18.160]  They're waging war on the life cycle itself and saying they're going to micromanage and tax every facet.
[3:02:18.160 --> 3:02:20.160]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:49.160]  It is a tax on the life-giving gas itself.
[3:02:50.160 --> 3:02:52.160]  They turned off the telephones and emailed.
[3:02:52.160 --> 3:02:56.160]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[3:02:56.160 --> 3:02:59.160]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[3:02:59.160 --> 3:03:03.160]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing
[3:03:03.160 --> 3:03:08.160]  and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many Americans' reach.
[3:03:08.160 --> 3:03:13.160]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[3:03:13.160 --> 3:03:15.160]  until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[3:03:15.160 --> 3:03:19.160]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[3:03:19.160 --> 3:03:23.160]  The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores
[3:03:23.160 --> 3:03:25.160]  enough money to restock their shelves.
[3:03:25.160 --> 3:03:28.160]  The stores have less food, but Jack of Price is to stay in business.
[3:03:28.160 --> 3:03:31.160]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[3:03:31.160 --> 3:03:33.160]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[3:03:33.160 --> 3:03:37.160]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[3:03:37.160 --> 3:03:41.160]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[3:03:41.160 --> 3:03:44.160]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand
[3:03:44.160 --> 3:03:47.160]  that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order,
[3:03:47.160 --> 3:03:49.160]  has a lot less control over you.
[3:03:49.160 --> 3:03:53.160]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[3:03:53.160 --> 3:03:56.160]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[3:03:56.160 --> 3:03:59.160]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food
[3:03:59.160 --> 3:04:03.160]  that's safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports,
[3:04:03.160 --> 3:04:06.160]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[3:04:06.160 --> 3:04:11.160]  Call 1-800-409-5633, or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[3:05:00.160 --> 3:05:04.160]  Number one is E. coli blue.
[3:05:04.160 --> 3:05:10.160]  E. coli blue is just an amazing, high quality, atmospheric water generator
[3:05:10.160 --> 3:05:13.160]  for the home pace for itself with one year if you buy your water from the store.
[3:05:13.160 --> 3:05:17.160]  Pure clean water without the fluoride and limited water from humidity in the air.
[3:05:17.160 --> 3:05:20.160]  Machine produces up to 28 liters of water in 24 hours, 7.5 gallons.
[3:05:20.160 --> 3:05:22.160]  That's your smaller unit.
[3:05:22.160 --> 3:05:24.160]  Great tasting pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[3:05:24.160 --> 3:05:26.160]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[3:05:26.160 --> 3:05:31.160]  Neutral pH, then it goes through an activated carbon filter,
[3:05:31.160 --> 3:05:34.160]  then a silver impregnated carbon filter, then a reverse osmosis system,
[3:05:34.160 --> 3:05:38.160]  and a taste and food removal filter, and is stored in a tank
[3:05:38.160 --> 3:05:41.160]  illuminated by antibacterial funnel UV light.
[3:05:41.160 --> 3:05:46.160]  E-C-O-L-O, blue.com, it's up on screen at presentplanet.tv.
[3:05:46.160 --> 3:05:51.160]  E. coli blue.com, or 866-585-4044.
[3:05:51.160 --> 3:05:56.160]  E. coli blue, absolutely fabulous folks,
[3:05:56.160 --> 3:05:59.160]  and we surely hope that you'll check them out today.
[3:05:59.160 --> 3:06:05.160]  Another great sponsor is eFoodsDirect.com, the J. Michael Stevens Group,
[3:06:05.160 --> 3:06:08.160]  the highest quality storeable foods for the price out there.
[3:06:08.160 --> 3:06:13.160]  No GMO foods, a lot of videos, free videos you can watch,
[3:06:13.160 --> 3:06:18.160]  or audios you can listen to at the website eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:06:18.160 --> 3:06:21.160]  And you need to give them a call, because self-sufficiency is the key.
[3:06:21.160 --> 3:06:25.160]  And if you're buying seeds, moving to the country, gearing up to be self-sufficient,
[3:06:25.160 --> 3:06:28.160]  moving out of the cities, which I think is advisable,
[3:06:28.160 --> 3:06:34.160]  for those that can, to face what's coming may not even have time.
[3:06:34.160 --> 3:06:40.160]  This is something you can have now that you know is a backup last more than 10 years
[3:06:40.160 --> 3:06:43.160]  in climate control, 10 years in non-climate control.
[3:06:43.160 --> 3:06:50.160]  EFoodsDirect.com, the letter E, FoodsDirect.com, or 800-409-5633-800409,
[3:06:50.160 --> 3:06:52.160]  5633 again, eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:06:52.160 --> 3:06:55.160]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[3:06:55.160 --> 3:07:00.160]  Okay, Alan Watt, you want to continue with carbon footprint,
[3:07:00.160 --> 3:07:04.160]  finishing what you were trying to say before we got cut off by break.
[3:07:04.160 --> 3:07:10.160]  And then the chemtrails overall, I'm looking at satellite photos on the major weather sites.
[3:07:10.160 --> 3:07:14.160]  I'm looking at the whole world now, and I've gone back because they have archives, as you know,
[3:07:14.160 --> 3:07:20.160]  but the listeners may not, of the skies 5, 10, 15 years ago, it wasn't there.
[3:07:20.160 --> 3:07:25.160]  Now, not just the major cities, like five years ago, but all over the U.S., all over Europe,
[3:07:25.160 --> 3:07:30.160]  all over Australia, but even some in third world countries, but it's mainly in the West.
[3:07:30.160 --> 3:07:33.160]  It's just covered with the trails.
[3:07:33.160 --> 3:07:35.160]  They're now at a couple thousand feet in Austin.
[3:07:35.160 --> 3:07:37.160]  They stay there for hour after hour.
[3:07:37.160 --> 3:07:38.160]  Everybody's getting sick.
[3:07:38.160 --> 3:07:47.160]  Major news media has been testing it and finding barium salts, weird fibers, aluminum oxide,
[3:07:47.160 --> 3:07:51.160]  all of this, so I'd like you to speak to the chemtrails as well.
[3:07:51.160 --> 3:07:52.160]  Yes.
[3:07:52.160 --> 3:07:58.160]  To get back to the footprints, the carbon ones, they're adding taxes onto air flights now, too,
[3:07:58.160 --> 3:08:02.160]  because the future you see, they're going to do basically tourism.
[3:08:02.160 --> 3:08:04.160]  That will be no longer necessary.
[3:08:04.160 --> 3:08:11.160]  You won't be able to travel to any country without it being required for business or work related.
[3:08:11.160 --> 3:08:13.160]  That's the system they're bringing in.
[3:08:13.160 --> 3:08:15.160]  And that will all be selectively enforced.
[3:08:15.160 --> 3:08:17.160]  When you go travel places you see, I'll never forget that.
[3:08:17.160 --> 3:08:19.160]  I'm going to let you continue, but just bring up points.
[3:08:19.160 --> 3:08:25.160]  About 15 years ago, before I was even on air, I was out at Hamilton Pool, this cenote,
[3:08:25.160 --> 3:08:29.160]  this caved in underground cave, beautiful, looks like something out of Tarzan,
[3:08:29.160 --> 3:08:32.160]  deep water, big snapping turtles and fish.
[3:08:32.160 --> 3:08:38.160]  And I was playing hooky from college and I was there with a girlfriend laying out on the pebbles,
[3:08:38.160 --> 3:08:42.160]  you know, on a summer day and these nature conservancy people showed up
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:44.160]  and they were making eugenics comments and going,
[3:08:44.160 --> 3:08:47.160]  I can't believe they allow people even here.
[3:08:47.160 --> 3:08:49.160]  I can't believe they even allow humans here.
[3:08:49.160 --> 3:08:54.160]  They were just looking at us with anger and then suddenly you saw the park rangers acting like that
[3:08:54.160 --> 3:08:58.160]  and this whole culture that we've got to be controlled and herded into cities.
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:02.160]  So I just wanted to add that point that we're not even under the official UN plans
[3:09:02.160 --> 3:09:06.160]  going to be allowed in more than half of the United States on their maps alone.
[3:09:06.160 --> 3:09:09.160]  You will be shot if you enter it and people didn't believe me.
[3:09:09.160 --> 3:09:13.160]  And then in 1999, I'll never forget, I don't remember the exact issue.
[3:09:13.160 --> 3:09:17.160]  I showed it on my local TV show many times and covered it on air for like a month.
[3:09:17.160 --> 3:09:20.160]  It was talking about an area in Asia.
[3:09:20.160 --> 3:09:22.160]  I want to say Burma.
[3:09:22.160 --> 3:09:28.160]  And it said huge national, international biosphere UN World Heritage sites,
[3:09:28.160 --> 3:09:32.160]  hundreds of thousands of acres were off limits and it showed soldiers within 16s.
[3:09:32.160 --> 3:09:37.160]  And it said, if the locals try to enter to even get water or even get fire water,
[3:09:37.160 --> 3:09:40.160]  they are shot and so that model is already going.
[3:09:40.160 --> 3:09:41.160]  Go ahead.
[3:09:41.160 --> 3:09:42.160]  That's true.
[3:09:42.160 --> 3:09:49.160]  And getting back to the housing, they will be coming around the houses and testing it for leakage
[3:09:49.160 --> 3:09:55.160]  if you can't teach your house efficiently and contain the heat and use burial fuel, et cetera.
[3:09:55.160 --> 3:09:57.160]  They're basically going to kick you out of that home.
[3:09:57.160 --> 3:10:00.160]  Manning fireplaces, banning space heaters already in Europe.
[3:10:00.160 --> 3:10:02.160]  Moving to do that in Canada.
[3:10:02.160 --> 3:10:03.160]  It just goes on and on.
[3:10:03.160 --> 3:10:04.160]  Yes.
[3:10:04.160 --> 3:10:05.160]  So that's the whole agenda.
[3:10:05.160 --> 3:10:10.160]  So through the force of law and using the power of the purses, I call it,
[3:10:10.160 --> 3:10:12.160]  they will force this whole agenda through.
[3:10:12.160 --> 3:10:18.160]  Cars, airplanes, farms, ranches, space heaters, homes, food,
[3:10:18.160 --> 3:10:20.160]  every facet micromanaging text.
[3:10:20.160 --> 3:10:21.160]  Yes.
[3:10:21.160 --> 3:10:22.160]  Absolutely.
[3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:23.160]  That's the big stick.
[3:10:23.160 --> 3:10:26.160]  And people will be trained from birth to always go along with laws,
[3:10:26.160 --> 3:10:30.160]  always go along with laws and don't question it.
[3:10:30.160 --> 3:10:32.160]  Everyone else goes along with the law.
[3:10:32.160 --> 3:10:35.160]  So if I can't you, that's what they say to you if you object.
[3:10:35.160 --> 3:10:36.160]  Well, take the animal ID.
[3:10:36.160 --> 3:10:38.160]  Take the animal ID.
[3:10:38.160 --> 3:10:40.160]  I mean, it's just so incredible.
[3:10:40.160 --> 3:10:42.160]  They just mail them around to people.
[3:10:42.160 --> 3:10:44.160]  It wasn't even a law except in two states, federal.
[3:10:44.160 --> 3:10:46.160]  And they just say, fill out this contract and sign it.
[3:10:46.160 --> 3:10:48.160]  And they sign away their farm and ranch.
[3:10:48.160 --> 3:10:52.160]  And now they're finding out they just gave the government an easement and control.
[3:10:52.160 --> 3:10:53.160]  That's correct.
[3:10:53.160 --> 3:10:57.160]  So what we're up against here is such incredible organization.
[3:10:57.160 --> 3:11:02.160]  That's what really hits anyone who goes into this field of study and research.
[3:11:02.160 --> 3:11:07.160]  The incredible organization that's micromanaged right down to the lowest level
[3:11:07.160 --> 3:11:11.160]  on every particular area of facet of living.
[3:11:11.160 --> 3:11:14.160]  That's what strikes you as overwhelming.
[3:11:14.160 --> 3:11:18.160]  And it isn't until you realize this has been on the go for such a long time
[3:11:18.160 --> 3:11:21.160]  that explains why they're all interconnected.
[3:11:21.160 --> 3:11:24.160]  When Margaret Thatcher left as the prime minister of Britain,
[3:11:24.160 --> 3:11:29.160]  she said that she now belongs to the parallel government.
[3:11:29.160 --> 3:11:33.160]  She called it the parallel government that's made up of ex-prime ministers,
[3:11:33.160 --> 3:11:36.160]  presidents, and high officials of all countries.
[3:11:36.160 --> 3:11:38.160]  She says, we really run the show.
[3:11:38.160 --> 3:11:41.160]  And I just noticed today that Tony Blair and Mirko,
[3:11:41.160 --> 3:11:46.160]  as over there was Sarkovsky, talking about this new economic system they're bringing.
[3:11:46.160 --> 3:11:49.160]  So Tony Blair, even though he's an ex-prime minister,
[3:11:49.160 --> 3:11:53.160]  is doing more behind the scenes than he could possibly do
[3:11:53.160 --> 3:11:56.160]  when he was the front man as the prime minister.
[3:11:56.160 --> 3:11:58.160]  He belongs to the parallel government.
[3:11:58.160 --> 3:12:03.160]  He's now graduated to the real government, which itself takes orders.
[3:12:03.160 --> 3:12:07.160]  Well, the public's focused on the front dummy puppets.
[3:12:07.160 --> 3:12:11.160]  And I meant to get to that story at someoneinfowars.com right now.
[3:12:11.160 --> 3:12:14.160]  They're seeing a new capitalism with what you said 30 minutes ago,
[3:12:14.160 --> 3:12:17.160]  where the government pays all the corporations
[3:12:17.160 --> 3:12:19.160]  who in turn pay the people total control.
[3:12:19.160 --> 3:12:20.160]  That's correct.
[3:12:20.160 --> 3:12:25.160]  So therefore, government will achieve the objective of the setup to do a long time ago,
[3:12:25.160 --> 3:12:27.160]  where they'll be into your personal account
[3:12:27.160 --> 3:12:31.160]  and it will be used as a control factor on what you do,
[3:12:31.160 --> 3:12:33.160]  where you go, what you spend your money on.
[3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:37.160]  In fact, they can take fines right out of your bank account
[3:12:37.160 --> 3:12:39.160]  if you break some carbon law, whatever.
[3:12:39.160 --> 3:12:43.160]  Finland's been doing that for 16, 17 years,
[3:12:43.160 --> 3:12:47.160]  where your parking ticket is according to how much money you have
[3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:48.160]  and if you're wealthier, they take more.
[3:12:48.160 --> 3:12:50.160]  It's a class thing they did to sell the public,
[3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:52.160]  but now it's for carbon footprint
[3:12:52.160 --> 3:12:54.160]  and everything you buy and sell is tracked,
[3:12:54.160 --> 3:12:57.160]  and they compare that and they say it's the world model
[3:12:57.160 --> 3:12:58.160]  according to how much money you make
[3:12:58.160 --> 3:13:01.160]  so they can tell if you're not paying taxes or have a black market job.
[3:13:01.160 --> 3:13:02.160]  That's correct.
[3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:05.160]  They're making refrigerators now
[3:13:05.160 --> 3:13:08.160]  that will read every item that's put in that fridge
[3:13:08.160 --> 3:13:12.160]  and literally it can get in touch with the supermarket to reorder,
[3:13:12.160 --> 3:13:15.160]  but it can also obviously get in touch with the government
[3:13:15.160 --> 3:13:16.160]  and let them know everything you have.
[3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:18.160]  Oh, Masonic?
[3:13:18.160 --> 3:13:20.160]  They will know.
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:26.160]  If all that you have good-wise comes from your ration, your quota,
[3:13:26.160 --> 3:13:28.160]  and if you're above that, they'll want to know where you got it from.
[3:13:28.160 --> 3:13:31.160]  Yes, it reads the RFID
[3:13:31.160 --> 3:13:33.160]  and they're by law, they're trying to make it where all refrigerators
[3:13:33.160 --> 3:13:34.160]  will have this within five years,
[3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:36.160]  and then now this big Masonic hospital organization,
[3:13:36.160 --> 3:13:38.160]  I saw the story two weeks ago,
[3:13:38.160 --> 3:13:41.160]  where the old people, if they aren't eating enough food
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:43.160]  or it's scanning their food, they go ahead and come
[3:13:43.160 --> 3:13:47.160]  and take them away to be put in a home or hospice,
[3:13:47.160 --> 3:13:50.160]  and then they're also going to track with the school lunch program
[3:13:50.160 --> 3:13:51.160]  where you swipe your card.
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:53.160]  They're already CPSing children
[3:13:53.160 --> 3:13:55.160]  because even if they bring their own lunch, it has to be entered in,
[3:13:55.160 --> 3:13:56.160]  and then they say,
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:13:59.160]  you weren't feeding your child healthy food, we're taking them.
[3:13:59.160 --> 3:14:00.160]  That's right.
[3:14:00.160 --> 3:14:02.160]  And getting back to this parallel government,
[3:14:02.160 --> 3:14:05.160]  I mean, Professor Carl Quigley talked about this in his book,
[3:14:05.160 --> 3:14:09.160]  Tragedy and Hope, and the Anglo-American Establishment, two books.
[3:14:09.160 --> 3:14:13.160]  He said that the parallel government runs with technocrats.
[3:14:13.160 --> 3:14:18.160]  Now, Blair now is a technocrat like Brzezinski or Maurice Strong or Kissinger,
[3:14:18.160 --> 3:14:21.160]  and he said that the prime ministers and presidents
[3:14:21.160 --> 3:14:24.160]  can take the heat for the policies of government.
[3:14:24.160 --> 3:14:27.160]  He says that the real work is done behind the scenes with technocrats
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:31.160]  who are not responsible to the public, they're not elected by the public.
[3:14:31.160 --> 3:14:34.160]  His whole life, Blair's whole life, Clinton's whole life,
[3:14:34.160 --> 3:14:37.160]  they finally graduate into real government.
[3:14:37.160 --> 3:14:39.160]  Yes.
[3:14:39.160 --> 3:14:44.160]  And we're seeing it now, and why is the media even so concentrated
[3:14:44.160 --> 3:14:47.160]  on ex-prime ministers and ex-presidents?
[3:14:47.160 --> 3:14:52.160]  It's out in the open now that they are part of this important parallel government,
[3:14:52.160 --> 3:14:56.160]  this interlinked interwoven completely with all of the big foundations
[3:14:56.160 --> 3:14:58.160]  that all work in concert.
[3:14:58.160 --> 3:15:01.160]  They're all on the same agenda, and they even have foundations
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:06.160]  which go out to make sure there's consensus building within every organization,
[3:15:06.160 --> 3:15:13.160]  so they're all on board on track with the same politically correct agendas.
[3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:18.160]  Simply stunning, Alan Watt. Briefly, chemtrails, they seem to be intensifying.
[3:15:18.160 --> 3:15:21.160]  They are intensifying.
[3:15:21.160 --> 3:15:26.160]  I noticed it in Ontario when they really started hitting us
[3:15:26.160 --> 3:15:30.160]  ten years ago, exactly in fact it was, and they were much lower at the time.
[3:15:30.160 --> 3:15:34.160]  It was all over the sky. The scary part is that most people didn't even see this.
[3:15:34.160 --> 3:15:39.160]  It was much, much lower. There were wide thick trails, maybe ten planes at a time,
[3:15:39.160 --> 3:15:45.160]  and the average person that watches TV and is dumbed down thought nothing of it.
[3:15:45.160 --> 3:15:50.160]  But this goes back to how we're always used behind what they tell us.
[3:15:50.160 --> 3:15:55.160]  It's only now they're saying, we're thinking of seeding the air with chemicals
[3:15:55.160 --> 3:15:58.160]  to curb global warming.
[3:15:58.160 --> 3:16:00.160]  Well, they've been doing something for ten years,
[3:16:00.160 --> 3:16:03.160]  and I don't think it's got anything to do with global warming.
[3:16:03.160 --> 3:16:06.160]  In fact, those who watch this notice that when they heavily spray an area,
[3:16:06.160 --> 3:16:11.160]  it heats up underneath because the tiny refractors and the metals act like mirrors.
[3:16:11.160 --> 3:16:13.160]  They're trying to heat.
[3:16:13.160 --> 3:16:16.160]  Because I think they knew the sun was about to cool off,
[3:16:16.160 --> 3:16:19.160]  and I'm not saying they're good, but they actually need to heat the earth.
[3:16:19.160 --> 3:16:21.160]  Then they're trying to restrict carbon.
[3:16:21.160 --> 3:16:24.160]  Alan Watt, let's finish up with Jim Trails and then go right to calls.
[3:16:24.160 --> 3:16:28.160]  Michael, Joe, Bill, Mark, Michelle, Michael, Danny, and others.
[3:16:28.160 --> 3:16:50.160]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[3:16:58.160 --> 3:17:01.160]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-Eleven Truth
[3:17:01.160 --> 3:17:05.160]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:17:05.160 --> 3:17:08.160]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:17:08.160 --> 3:17:14.160]  He takes his hand off, and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:17:14.160 --> 3:17:17.160]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[3:17:17.160 --> 3:17:23.160]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[3:17:23.160 --> 3:17:26.160]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:17:26.160 --> 3:17:29.160]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[3:17:29.160 --> 3:17:58.160]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:17:59.160 --> 3:18:02.160]  Some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[3:18:02.160 --> 3:18:05.160]  For this reason, Mitus Resources has prepared a report
[3:18:05.160 --> 3:18:08.160]  explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[3:18:08.160 --> 3:18:11.160]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Mitus Resources or not,
[3:18:11.160 --> 3:18:15.160]  I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[3:18:25.160 --> 3:18:28.160]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[3:18:28.160 --> 3:18:32.160]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:18:59.160 --> 3:19:00.160]  And more.
[3:19:00.160 --> 3:19:03.160]  People enjoying the benefits while using CANSI report no side effects
[3:19:03.160 --> 3:19:06.160]  and the drops are gentle and don't cause eye burning.
[3:19:06.160 --> 3:19:09.160]  With regular use, people using CANSI drops report a difference in their vision
[3:19:09.160 --> 3:19:14.160]  in as little as 30 days and some have their cataracts completely disappear within months.
[3:19:14.160 --> 3:19:17.160]  CANSI, that's CAN-letter C, is available now by calling
[3:19:17.160 --> 3:19:29.160]  888-212-8871 or order online at Nutramedical.com.
[3:19:29.160 --> 3:19:40.160]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[3:19:40.160 --> 3:19:42.160]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[3:19:42.160 --> 3:19:44.160]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[3:19:44.160 --> 3:19:48.160]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[3:19:48.160 --> 3:19:52.160]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[3:19:52.160 --> 3:19:55.160]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market
[3:19:55.160 --> 3:20:00.160]  and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.
[3:20:00.160 --> 3:20:01.160]  Need something more?

[3:20:27.160 --> 3:20:44.160]  That's 1-800-313-6400 today.
[3:20:58.160 --> 3:21:01.160]  The Marines announced publicly yesterday.
[3:21:01.160 --> 3:21:03.160]  Yes, we're going to fight the American people.
[3:21:03.160 --> 3:21:08.160]  I didn't even cover that article where they're announcing they're going to engage in combat in America,
[3:21:08.160 --> 3:21:12.160]  not even against Al Qaeda, which they claimed, the American people.
[3:21:12.160 --> 3:21:16.160]  It is just unbelievable, the type of things.
[3:21:16.160 --> 3:21:19.160]  And things are going so fast now, Alan.
[3:21:19.160 --> 3:21:22.160]  You and I can hardly even respond to all of it.
[3:21:22.160 --> 3:21:26.160]  And everything we said is happening because we were just reading the Globalist Own documents
[3:21:26.160 --> 3:21:29.160]  before they were widely disseminated.
[3:21:29.160 --> 3:21:32.160]  Yes, that's the whole trick of it.
[3:21:32.160 --> 3:21:38.160]  The public have been unfortunately well trained with scientific indoctrination.
[3:21:38.160 --> 3:21:41.160]  The television is not something to be entertained with.
[3:21:41.160 --> 3:21:44.160]  It's the greatest tool the elite have ever had.
[3:21:44.160 --> 3:21:49.160]  You can't listen to truth and think about the truth and dissect it for yourself
[3:21:49.160 --> 3:21:53.160]  and switch on the TV and get lost for an hour on some other topic
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:57.160]  because whatever your learning is going to be eradicated from your mind.
[3:21:57.160 --> 3:21:59.160]  It is a scientific tool.
[3:21:59.160 --> 3:22:02.160]  It's been put to an incredible effect.
[3:22:02.160 --> 3:22:11.160]  But they're also going into the ELF warfare techniques now that Brzezinski talked about in his book Between Two Ages.
[3:22:11.160 --> 3:22:16.160]  He mentioned the technotronic era in that book.
[3:22:16.160 --> 3:22:22.160]  And the technotronic era was a technique that would be used on the general population.
[3:22:22.160 --> 3:22:27.160]  Worldwide, where they get their opinions and ideas coming to them
[3:22:27.160 --> 3:22:29.160]  but they have no idea where it was coming from.
[3:22:29.160 --> 3:22:32.160]  And he was talking about really ELF technology.
[3:22:32.160 --> 3:22:36.160]  And they are putting up antennas in some of the big cities.
[3:22:36.160 --> 3:22:41.160]  I've got photographs here, some of them in the process of being built in fact.
[3:22:41.160 --> 3:22:47.160]  And they have their own transponders down below.
[3:22:47.160 --> 3:22:52.160]  And these things are unlike the ones they use for cell phones and I think this is all part of the network
[3:22:52.160 --> 3:22:55.160]  to control the minds of the public.
[3:22:55.160 --> 3:22:58.160]  Now, this stuff is well proven. It works very well.
[3:22:58.160 --> 3:23:06.160]  It can put you into a state of apathy or aggression or depression or aggression very easily.
[3:23:06.160 --> 3:23:11.160]  By the way, a mainstream publication two weeks ago came out and it's been in the Baltimore Sun as well
[3:23:11.160 --> 3:23:17.160]  and said DARPA has these ultrasound alone can calm you or make you angry
[3:23:17.160 --> 3:23:19.160]  and they said we're going to start doing this for the public.
[3:23:19.160 --> 3:23:20.160]  That's right.
[3:23:20.160 --> 3:23:24.160]  It's going to put towers up, but it's the final cut, Alan.
[3:23:24.160 --> 3:23:33.160]  Yes, they're actually going ahead and building them and putting them up in preparedness for the times ahead.
[3:23:33.160 --> 3:23:37.160]  Alan, what are we going to do when a cop shoots an unarmed man in the back on the ground?
[3:23:37.160 --> 3:23:40.160]  We've got to turn these on and calm everybody down, Alan.
[3:23:40.160 --> 3:23:42.160]  Yes, that's the whole...
[3:23:42.160 --> 3:23:45.160]  You see, again, it goes back to this whole idea that we're just animals
[3:23:45.160 --> 3:23:48.160]  and there's nothing spiritual about you.
[3:23:48.160 --> 3:23:52.160]  You've no soul, no nothing. You're just a contained brain
[3:23:52.160 --> 3:23:55.160]  and they call it endless loops inside your own brain.
[3:23:55.160 --> 3:23:57.160]  That's what they teach in university.
[3:23:57.160 --> 3:23:58.160]  And they also give us double-think.
[3:23:58.160 --> 3:24:02.160]  They go, well, all these people die when they get tasered, but that's just a syndrome.
[3:24:02.160 --> 3:24:04.160]  People just happen to die at the same time they're tasered.
[3:24:04.160 --> 3:24:05.160]  It's not the taser.
[3:24:05.160 --> 3:24:06.160]  Now they might say...
[3:24:06.160 --> 3:24:09.160]  People are allergic to it, you see.
[3:24:09.160 --> 3:24:13.160]  Well, now when we shoot you, maybe it's a syndrome.
[3:24:13.160 --> 3:24:14.160]  Maybe the bullet didn't do it.
[3:24:14.160 --> 3:24:16.160]  That's it, that's right.
[3:24:16.160 --> 3:24:18.160]  And so they can rationalize and they are.
[3:24:18.160 --> 3:24:24.160]  They're using every kind of rationalization, almost mockingly today, to justify what they can do
[3:24:24.160 --> 3:24:26.160]  because they're given all power.
[3:24:26.160 --> 3:24:28.160]  They know they have all power to do as they wish.
[3:24:28.160 --> 3:24:35.160]  They've raised a generation that's willing to use all of this technology and weaponry on the public.
[3:24:35.160 --> 3:24:37.160]  They've been brought up playing the video games.
[3:24:37.160 --> 3:24:41.160]  There's no morality in a video game that gets to the other side and kills people.
[3:24:41.160 --> 3:24:45.160]  And they condition us with all the violence they constantly show on TV to accept it.
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:46.160]  And this segment's almost over.
[3:24:46.160 --> 3:24:48.160]  I want to come back and go directly to calls.
[3:24:48.160 --> 3:24:51.160]  You got cut off on the last segment with the Chemtrail comments.
[3:24:51.160 --> 3:24:52.160]  Go ahead.
[3:24:52.160 --> 3:24:55.160]  Yes, the Chemtrails, I'll tell you.
[3:24:55.160 --> 3:24:59.160]  It probably has many, many different functions, I'm sure.
[3:24:59.160 --> 3:25:02.160]  It definitely makes people apathetic and tired.
[3:25:02.160 --> 3:25:04.160]  That's been well noted.
[3:25:04.160 --> 3:25:08.160]  I've been watching this for years and talking to hundreds of people over the years on it
[3:25:08.160 --> 3:25:10.160]  where they're heavily sprayed.
[3:25:10.160 --> 3:25:17.160]  And as you say, the physical fallouts, even in the bronchial tubes and the long-lasting infections, etc.,
[3:25:17.160 --> 3:25:18.160]  are well noted.
[3:25:18.160 --> 3:25:22.160]  Every pharmacist in the country knows what his best-selling products are.
[3:25:22.160 --> 3:25:27.160]  Go in and ask the pharmacist and he'll tell you it's the bronchodilators and expectorants and so on.
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:31.160]  And antibiotics that are really being pushed for the last 10 years
[3:25:31.160 --> 3:25:34.160]  to do with this spring.
[3:25:34.160 --> 3:25:35.160]  He might not mention the spring.
[3:25:35.160 --> 3:25:39.160]  He might not know himself, but he knows what he sells off the shelves.
[3:25:39.160 --> 3:25:44.160]  And so the ones at the top who advocated this, they treat us like children.
[3:25:44.160 --> 3:25:45.160]  They call us children.
[3:25:45.160 --> 3:25:47.160]  They cannot tell the children what we're doing to them.
[3:25:47.160 --> 3:25:51.160]  It's for their own benefit, poor souls, but we don't want to scare them.
[3:25:51.160 --> 3:26:00.160]  They know, probably, right down to the smallest iota, how many people will die off with respiratory problems.
[3:26:00.160 --> 3:26:02.160]  And then we call it allergies.
[3:26:02.160 --> 3:26:05.160]  People who never had them suddenly can't breathe or sick all the time.
[3:26:05.160 --> 3:26:11.160]  Suddenly, I saw a report last year that women's lung cancer is up seven times what it was a decade ago.
[3:26:11.160 --> 3:26:13.160]  And they go, that's all right.
[3:26:13.160 --> 3:26:17.160]  We'll have a little cancer group for you and make you feel like you're a little movie star.
[3:26:17.160 --> 3:26:19.160]  Now you're going to die and go in a coffin.
[3:26:19.160 --> 3:26:20.160]  Bye-bye.
[3:26:20.160 --> 3:26:21.160]  We love you.
[3:26:21.160 --> 3:26:23.160]  We'll be right back.
[3:26:23.160 --> 3:26:24.160]  We're on the march.
[3:26:24.160 --> 3:26:26.160]  The empire's on the run.
[3:26:26.160 --> 3:26:33.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:26:33.160 --> 3:26:35.160]  The headlines are clear.
[3:26:35.160 --> 3:26:38.160]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[3:26:38.160 --> 3:26:41.160]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[3:26:41.160 --> 3:26:43.160]  The market of beast is at hand.
[3:26:43.160 --> 3:26:46.160]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[3:26:46.160 --> 3:26:49.160]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[3:26:49.160 --> 3:26:51.160]  To stay free.
[3:26:51.160 --> 3:26:58.160]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit. 24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[3:26:58.160 --> 3:27:01.160]  For true patrons and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[3:27:01.160 --> 3:27:05.160]  That's over five pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[3:27:05.160 --> 3:27:09.160]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for seven years.
[3:27:09.160 --> 3:27:15.160]  Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me, is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money.
[3:27:15.160 --> 3:27:18.160]  Selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him.
[3:27:18.160 --> 3:27:20.160]  Restaurants and small delis.
[3:27:20.160 --> 3:27:21.160]  And copycats.
[3:27:21.160 --> 3:27:23.160]  Their fancy packaging is not free.
[3:27:23.160 --> 3:27:25.160]  Order today before it's too late.
[3:27:25.160 --> 3:27:27.160]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[3:27:27.160 --> 3:27:29.160]  That's Survivalistseeds.com.
[3:27:29.160 --> 3:27:32.160]  A long-term food solution.
[3:27:32.160 --> 3:27:36.160]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:39.160]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:27:39.160 --> 3:27:42.160]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:27:42.160 --> 3:27:44.160]  But who is the enemy?
[3:27:44.160 --> 3:27:45.160]  Bin Laden.
[3:27:45.160 --> 3:27:46.160]  VCC Zamo.
[3:27:46.160 --> 3:27:47.160]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:27:47.160 --> 3:27:49.160]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:27:49.160 --> 3:27:56.160]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:27:56.160 --> 3:28:03.160]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[3:28:03.160 --> 3:28:07.160]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:28:07.160 --> 3:28:09.160]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA.
[3:28:09.160 --> 3:28:11.160]  The hijackers' ties to the FBI.
[3:28:11.160 --> 3:28:12.160]  The Saudi Arabian connection.
[3:28:12.160 --> 3:28:14.160]  The Israeli intelligence network.
[3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:15.160]  Warnings and war games.
[3:28:15.160 --> 3:28:16.160]  The shadow government.
[3:28:16.160 --> 3:28:17.160]  And much, much more.
[3:28:17.160 --> 3:28:18.160]  Fabled Enemies.
[3:28:18.160 --> 3:28:20.160]  Get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:28:20.160 --> 3:28:22.160]  Or see it in super high quality.
[3:28:22.160 --> 3:28:26.160]  Along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:28:26.160 --> 3:28:28.160]  Either you are with us.
[3:28:28.160 --> 3:28:57.160]  Or you are with the terrorists.
[3:28:58.160 --> 3:29:05.160]  This water system will de-scale all piping, hot water heaters and appliances due to heavy buildup of hard minerals.
[3:29:05.160 --> 3:29:12.160]  Detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering the fine capillaries of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins.
[3:29:12.160 --> 3:29:20.160]  With extreme positive effects on plants, vegetables and fruits, improved taste, color, size and yield with approximately 30% less water usage.
[3:29:20.160 --> 3:29:24.160]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms and commercial use.
[3:29:24.160 --> 3:29:29.160]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-6912608.
[3:29:29.160 --> 3:29:56.160]  That's 908-6912608.
[3:29:56.160 --> 3:30:00.160]  All right, Alan. Cut into the Matrix.com as its website.
[3:30:00.160 --> 3:30:04.160]  Be sure and check out the audios, the materials, the videos, things that are available there.
[3:30:04.160 --> 3:30:07.160]  Be sure and support Alan Watt and the work he's doing.
[3:30:07.160 --> 3:30:09.160]  Be sure and support our work as well.
[3:30:09.160 --> 3:30:12.160]  And all the documentary films that I have made.
[3:30:12.160 --> 3:30:14.160]  I've made 20 of them and produced another.
[3:30:14.160 --> 3:30:15.160]  That should produce two.
[3:30:15.160 --> 3:30:16.160]  Fabled Enemies and Loose Change.
[3:30:16.160 --> 3:30:17.160]  Final Cut.
[3:30:17.160 --> 3:30:19.160]  Fabled Enemies is the latest 9-11 film.
[3:30:19.160 --> 3:30:21.160]  And we learn more as time goes on.
[3:30:21.160 --> 3:30:26.160]  This is an open and shut case about how the establishment carried out the attacks.
[3:30:26.160 --> 3:30:29.160]  The Money Masters, how the bankers got total control.
[3:30:29.160 --> 3:30:32.160]  Three and a half hour film, 1995.
[3:30:32.160 --> 3:30:36.160]  Really, the Rosetta Stone of understanding the overall in-game agenda.
[3:30:36.160 --> 3:30:41.160]  If I had to say, see one film to understand their total agenda and their program,
[3:30:41.160 --> 3:30:42.160]  it's it.
[3:30:42.160 --> 3:30:45.160]  This film, in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:30:45.160 --> 3:30:47.160]  The 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising.
[3:30:47.160 --> 3:30:50.160]  I mean, this is the latest film I made.
[3:30:50.160 --> 3:30:52.160]  And I just can't even describe the film.
[3:30:52.160 --> 3:30:54.160]  You've got to see it.
[3:30:54.160 --> 3:30:55.160]  It's cinema verite.
[3:30:55.160 --> 3:30:58.160]  It's fast-paced.
[3:30:58.160 --> 3:31:01.160]  30, 40 world leaders confronted.
[3:31:01.160 --> 3:31:05.160]  Willie Nelson interviewed.
[3:31:05.160 --> 3:31:07.160]  Martin Sheen interviewed.
[3:31:07.160 --> 3:31:11.160]  George Carlin interviewed.
[3:31:11.160 --> 3:31:16.160]  I mean, the list just goes on and on to try to describe everything that is in this film.
[3:31:16.160 --> 3:31:17.160]  Bill Clinton confronted.
[3:31:17.160 --> 3:31:18.160]  Dave Rockefeller confronted.
[3:31:18.160 --> 3:31:20.160]  John McCain, Barack Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[3:31:20.160 --> 3:31:22.160]  Just an incredible film.
[3:31:22.160 --> 3:31:26.160]  The 9-11 Chronicles, folks, need to have this documentary.
[3:31:26.160 --> 3:31:29.160]  Again, available at infowars.com.
[3:31:29.160 --> 3:31:34.160]  And Alan Steffsall available at cuttingthethematrix.com.
[3:31:34.160 --> 3:31:38.160]  I want to go to your calls now for those that have been patiently holding for the balance
[3:31:38.160 --> 3:31:42.160]  of this Friday edition and try to move quickly through them.
[3:31:42.160 --> 3:31:44.160]  I appreciate everybody being patient.
[3:31:44.160 --> 3:31:46.160]  Let's talk to Michael in Chicago.
[3:31:46.160 --> 3:31:50.160]  You're on the air with Alan Watt.
[3:31:50.160 --> 3:31:51.160]  Michelle.
[3:31:51.160 --> 3:31:52.160]  Excuse me.
[3:31:52.160 --> 3:31:53.160]  I read that wrong.
[3:31:53.160 --> 3:31:54.160]  Michelle in Chicago.
[3:31:54.160 --> 3:31:55.160]  Go ahead.
[3:31:55.160 --> 3:31:56.160]  Hi, Alex.
[3:31:56.160 --> 3:31:57.160]  How are you?
[3:31:57.160 --> 3:31:58.160]  Good.
[3:31:58.160 --> 3:31:59.160]  I'm a first-time caller.
[3:31:59.160 --> 3:32:06.160]  I've probably woke up maybe about two years ago, started watching the 9-11 films, and I
[3:32:06.160 --> 3:32:08.160]  was a big watcher of TV before.
[3:32:08.160 --> 3:32:15.160]  And now that I'm seeing it after waking up to everything that's going on, it's so obvious.
[3:32:15.160 --> 3:32:24.160]  The brainwashing that these people are broadcasting to everybody, and it's just so disheartening
[3:32:24.160 --> 3:32:32.160]  to watch it happen and listen to them mock truthers as conspiracy theorists and just dismiss
[3:32:32.160 --> 3:32:37.160]  everything that they're saying and make it into a big joke.
[3:32:37.160 --> 3:32:41.160]  It's such a ridiculous thing that people...
[3:32:41.160 --> 3:32:46.160]  The media is so ridiculous that people just don't pay attention to it and they're apathetic
[3:32:46.160 --> 3:32:48.160]  and they just don't care.
[3:32:48.160 --> 3:32:50.160]  But that's what they mean at a certain level to programming.
[3:32:50.160 --> 3:32:54.160]  That's why they came out and said that the number two in Al-Qaeda have been killed 14
[3:32:54.160 --> 3:32:55.160]  separate times and never...
[3:32:55.160 --> 3:32:56.160]  Oh, my God!
[3:32:56.160 --> 3:32:57.160]  They don't pay attention.
[3:32:57.160 --> 3:32:59.160]  And then never retracted...
[3:32:59.160 --> 3:33:00.160]  No!
[3:33:00.160 --> 3:33:03.160]  Okay, well, last time we didn't really kill him, but this time we did.
[3:33:03.160 --> 3:33:04.160]  People don't even care.
[3:33:04.160 --> 3:33:07.160]  They don't even remember what happened two years ago.
[3:33:07.160 --> 3:33:10.160]  All they care about is the current staff that are going on right now.
[3:33:10.160 --> 3:33:12.160]  These election things, they don't talk about the issues.
[3:33:12.160 --> 3:33:14.160]  They talk about the numbers.
[3:33:14.160 --> 3:33:15.160]  But the point I was...
[3:33:15.160 --> 3:33:16.160]  Yes, I'm sorry, guys.
[3:33:16.160 --> 3:33:17.160]  No, no, no.
[3:33:17.160 --> 3:33:19.160]  I'm just going to get Alan's take on this.
[3:33:19.160 --> 3:33:21.160]  I just noticed they do this.
[3:33:21.160 --> 3:33:26.160]  They're making the propaganda ridiculous to make people almost tune out and then just disregard
[3:33:26.160 --> 3:33:30.160]  all information where it's all just kind of a background noise.
[3:33:30.160 --> 3:33:33.160]  Alan, what do you call that tactic?
[3:33:33.160 --> 3:33:36.160]  It works with dystopia, they call it.
[3:33:36.160 --> 3:33:42.160]  Where they do almost mind-bomb you with conflicting reports until you don't trust your own logic anymore,
[3:33:42.160 --> 3:33:44.160]  that that's part of the process.
[3:33:44.160 --> 3:33:47.160]  Most people will simply switch off to any further news on that topic.
[3:33:47.160 --> 3:33:49.160]  In fact, they'll switch right out.
[3:33:49.160 --> 3:33:53.160]  And that's a technique that's used in neuroscience on the public here.
[3:33:53.160 --> 3:33:56.160]  Yeah, they did that with rats and then hire primates.
[3:33:56.160 --> 3:33:57.160]  And I had a Marine call in.
[3:33:57.160 --> 3:34:00.160]  I was familiar with a study where they take a puppy and shock it on a plate.
[3:34:00.160 --> 3:34:01.160]  And it's got its food.
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:03.160]  Every time it goes with the food, it shocks it.
[3:34:03.160 --> 3:34:06.160]  And finally, it just rolls over and waits to die.
[3:34:06.160 --> 3:34:10.160]  Yeah, so when it mentions the same topic again, you'll just automatically say,
[3:34:10.160 --> 3:34:11.160]  well, you're paranoid.
[3:34:11.160 --> 3:34:14.160]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[3:34:14.160 --> 3:34:17.160]  And Abilia is the main one, too.
[3:34:17.160 --> 3:34:18.160]  It's no memory.
[3:34:18.160 --> 3:34:19.160]  People have no memory.
[3:34:19.160 --> 3:34:23.160]  And they think in bits and bytes, little clips on the media come in short bursts now.
[3:34:23.160 --> 3:34:26.160]  And that's the attention span of most people that can't concentrate.
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:28.160]  They've reduced it by design.
[3:34:28.160 --> 3:34:29.160]  Anything else, Michelle?
[3:34:29.160 --> 3:34:37.160]  Well, I just wanted to say that you're very brave to say the least.
[3:34:37.160 --> 3:34:40.160]  Listen, this is not a figure of speech, Michelle.
[3:34:40.160 --> 3:34:42.160]  I'm not, oh, I'm not brave now, ma'am.
[3:34:42.160 --> 3:34:43.160]  I'm just doing my job.
[3:34:43.160 --> 3:34:45.160]  Literally, I'm not brave.
[3:34:45.160 --> 3:34:50.160]  How would I not discover a scientific technocracy that is completely psychopathic
[3:34:50.160 --> 3:34:53.160]  and enjoys destroying my species and my children's future?
[3:34:53.160 --> 3:34:59.160]  How would I not aggressively fight it with everything I've got and try to build
[3:34:59.160 --> 3:35:01.160]  some media system to at least counter it?
[3:35:01.160 --> 3:35:02.160]  I mean, how would I?
[3:35:02.160 --> 3:35:07.160]  I would be mindlessly brave if I knew this and just said, forget it.
[3:35:07.160 --> 3:35:09.160]  Alan, can you speak to that?
[3:35:09.160 --> 3:35:10.160]  It's true.
[3:35:10.160 --> 3:35:15.160]  I mean, every animal on the planet, even insects, will try and defend themselves.
[3:35:15.160 --> 3:35:21.160]  A mouse will actually scratch the nose of a cat rather than just get eaten or to save its young.
[3:35:21.160 --> 3:35:23.160]  And we have the same abilities here.
[3:35:23.160 --> 3:35:27.160]  Only we've been so dumbed down and made to be apathetic.
[3:35:27.160 --> 3:35:32.160]  This is, again, a scientific technique of indoctrination, of obedience to authority
[3:35:32.160 --> 3:35:38.160]  that we allow them to take the next step and the next step to our own extinction.
[3:35:38.160 --> 3:35:40.160]  And we can't allow that to happen.
[3:35:40.160 --> 3:35:41.160]  We can't allow it to happen.
[3:35:41.160 --> 3:35:47.160]  We have the right to exist on this planet as much as anyone who believes he's an elitist does.
[3:35:47.160 --> 3:35:50.160]  And there are no more value than we are.
[3:35:50.160 --> 3:35:51.160]  That's the fact.
[3:35:51.160 --> 3:35:53.160]  And I appreciate your call, Michelle.
[3:35:53.160 --> 3:35:55.160]  I'd love to keep you on the longer level of these calls.
[3:35:55.160 --> 3:35:58.160]  We've got to get everybody who at least is holding.
[3:35:58.160 --> 3:36:04.160]  I mean, that is the basic facts of this, what Alan just said.
[3:36:04.160 --> 3:36:09.160]  And they have taught us to not have our survival instinct or to turn it on and off.
[3:36:09.160 --> 3:36:12.160]  When they say turn it off, it's not OK to stand up and fight back.
[3:36:12.160 --> 3:36:15.160]  Like in England where they arrest you, if somebody is raping your wife and you punch them,
[3:36:15.160 --> 3:36:17.160]  you go to jail, the rapist doesn't.
[3:36:17.160 --> 3:36:18.160]  That's on record.
[3:36:18.160 --> 3:36:23.160]  If somebody's robbed you three times, they come in to kill you, you stab them, you go to jail.
[3:36:23.160 --> 3:36:26.160]  Or if you push somebody out a window and they're attacking you, you go to jail.
[3:36:26.160 --> 3:36:33.160]  They're saying you are not to protect yourself because it's a criminal class running things they want.
[3:36:33.160 --> 3:36:36.160]  I mean, it's kind of like when you have some really expensive snakes.
[3:36:36.160 --> 3:36:40.160]  They amputate the guinea pig's legs and defang it.
[3:36:40.160 --> 3:36:46.160]  You take its teeth out so it can't bite the snake when the snake eats it because they don't want the snake to be hurt.
[3:36:46.160 --> 3:36:52.160]  Or they'll drug the guinea pig with a drug that doesn't affect the snake so the guinea pig doesn't hurt it.
[3:36:52.160 --> 3:36:54.160]  We've been neutralized to be like a guinea pig.
[3:36:54.160 --> 3:36:59.160]  It's had its eyes gouged out, its teeth pulled out, its legs cut off, dropped into the snake.
[3:36:59.160 --> 3:37:02.160]  And that's what this social Darwinism is.
[3:37:02.160 --> 3:37:05.160]  And that's what carbon taxing is, teaching us we're bad.
[3:37:05.160 --> 3:37:10.160]  They take our own survival instinct and say, if the earth is going to survive, we've got to kill ourselves.
[3:37:10.160 --> 3:37:13.160]  They're teaching us our own survival system.
[3:37:13.160 --> 3:37:17.160]  Our own survival propulsion system is a thought crime.
[3:37:17.160 --> 3:37:25.160]  They are, and I was reading an article recently from the United Nations about the idea of power and total power,
[3:37:25.160 --> 3:37:35.160]  where they say that eventually the world governmental system will be the only authorized authority that can legally use violence.
[3:37:35.160 --> 3:37:37.160]  And that's what it's all about.
[3:37:37.160 --> 3:37:43.160]  And one beneath that, all your family squabbles and so on or robbers coming into your house, that just happens amongst the animals.
[3:37:43.160 --> 3:37:44.160]  You're all animals.
[3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:50.160]  We see you as one big mass, and therefore we can't allow you to use violence yourself.
[3:37:50.160 --> 3:37:53.160]  And they call that the power monopoly of force.
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:54.160]  That's right.
[3:37:54.160 --> 3:38:00.160]  That's in a Unideer document, July 7th, 2001, where they said that's why the American people must be armed.
[3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:03.160]  And the bill has been introduced by the Democrats.
[3:38:03.160 --> 3:38:08.160]  Barack Obama, if they pass it, is set to sign it, where the Attorney General can ban any and all guns,
[3:38:08.160 --> 3:38:11.160]  simply by uttering the word ex-cathedra.
[3:38:11.160 --> 3:38:13.160]  Literally is God Emperor.
[3:38:13.160 --> 3:38:15.160]  I mean, this, you can't make it up.
[3:38:15.160 --> 3:38:20.160]  It's up on infowars.com now in the News & Focus archive, a featured story archive.
[3:38:20.160 --> 3:38:22.160]  Let's go to another caller here.
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:23.160]  This isn't a drill, folks.
[3:38:23.160 --> 3:38:24.160]  This is for real.
[3:38:24.160 --> 3:38:25.160]  This is happening.
[3:38:25.160 --> 3:38:27.160]  Let's go ahead and talk, Joe, hung up.
[3:38:27.160 --> 3:38:29.160]  Bill in Illinois and then others.
[3:38:29.160 --> 3:38:32.160]  Bill, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:33.160]  Hi, gentlemen.
[3:38:33.160 --> 3:38:38.160]  I was hoping that we could just roll into the weekend and give people some hope.
[3:38:38.160 --> 3:38:43.160]  I know that all the information that comes out is really paralyzing and scary to most people.
[3:38:43.160 --> 3:38:51.160]  But the more you dive into it and see what's going on and try to wake people up and knock them out of their comas,
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:57.160]  I'm seeing a groundswell of people waking up in the Chicago land area.
[3:38:57.160 --> 3:39:04.160]  And everybody is being laid off, they're trying to figure out how they're going to make rent or put food on the table.
[3:39:04.160 --> 3:39:07.160]  And now's the time when people are paying attention.
[3:39:07.160 --> 3:39:14.160]  And now's the time where we can all start to organize and provide solutions and start a blog or make videos
[3:39:14.160 --> 3:39:18.160]  or pass out your DVDs and get people to be away.
[3:39:18.160 --> 3:39:19.160]  Well, I agree.
[3:39:19.160 --> 3:39:20.160]  But here's an analogy.
[3:39:20.160 --> 3:39:22.160]  We'll get Alan's comment and let you counter comment.
[3:39:22.160 --> 3:39:25.160]  If someone is taking this information we're giving, it's paralyzing.
[3:39:25.160 --> 3:39:26.160]  They shouldn't.
[3:39:26.160 --> 3:39:30.160]  The establishment through chemicals, through the media, through the television, through the culture,
[3:39:30.160 --> 3:39:32.160]  doesn't we pick up the propaganda and regurgitate?
[3:39:32.160 --> 3:39:34.160]  Then that gives it with the pheromone activation.
[3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:39.160]  You know, in the true third dimension, the reality trigger in the mind.
[3:39:39.160 --> 3:39:42.160]  But that gets into some more sophisticated issues that I've seen.
[3:39:42.160 --> 3:39:51.160]  We have to understand that it's like they've given us a big shot of a sedative.
[3:39:51.160 --> 3:39:57.160]  And then this show is literally a shot of adrenaline where you're laying on a railroad track.
[3:39:57.160 --> 3:39:58.160]  You've been shot up full of Thorazine.
[3:39:58.160 --> 3:39:59.160]  You can't get up.
[3:39:59.160 --> 3:40:02.160]  Alan Watt and I are coming in with adrenaline going,
[3:40:02.160 --> 3:40:05.160]  to where you can actually get up and get off the track.
[3:40:05.160 --> 3:40:10.160]  And so we're just telling you the full truth, folks, so you know what you're facing.
[3:40:10.160 --> 3:40:13.160]  Because people are being paralyzed by this.
[3:40:13.160 --> 3:40:17.160]  I don't know about you in my life, but Alan, when somebody starts swinging at you,
[3:40:17.160 --> 3:40:18.160]  I don't feel paralyzed.
[3:40:18.160 --> 3:40:19.160]  I go into gear.
[3:40:19.160 --> 3:40:21.160]  Yeah, you must do.
[3:40:21.160 --> 3:40:23.160]  Again, this is a war.
[3:40:23.160 --> 3:40:27.160]  And when you realize it is a war strategy, and you're in it, whether you like it or not,
[3:40:27.160 --> 3:40:31.160]  then you have to fight back with all that you can do, no matter what it is.
[3:40:31.160 --> 3:40:33.160]  And don't be overwhelmed by it.
[3:40:33.160 --> 3:40:36.160]  This has been on the goal before we were born.
[3:40:36.160 --> 3:40:40.160]  When you realize it's always a long-term system, long-term goals,
[3:40:40.160 --> 3:40:41.160]  then you're still in the battle.
[3:40:41.160 --> 3:40:44.160]  It's not over until the fat lady sings.
[3:40:44.160 --> 3:40:46.160]  Yeah, you can't opt out of this.
[3:40:46.160 --> 3:40:48.160]  You were born into this.
[3:40:48.160 --> 3:40:52.160]  And what you have to do, too, is realize those things which are paralyzing you,
[3:40:52.160 --> 3:40:55.160]  those things which are numbing your brain, like the television,
[3:40:55.160 --> 3:41:02.160]  and stop watching it, start reading, getting into the factual information that it is put out by the authorities themselves.
[3:41:02.160 --> 3:41:03.160]  You can find the stuff.
[3:41:03.160 --> 3:41:05.160]  It's all over the place.
[3:41:05.160 --> 3:41:07.160]  And realize this is all very, very real.
[3:41:07.160 --> 3:41:08.160]  What can I do?
[3:41:08.160 --> 3:41:10.160]  And start doing something.
[3:41:10.160 --> 3:41:14.160]  I started off handwriting stuff and photocopying stuff
[3:41:14.160 --> 3:41:18.160]  and sending out to hundreds of people who had a voice when I had none.
[3:41:18.160 --> 3:41:21.160]  And that's the sort of thing that you have to do.
[3:41:21.160 --> 3:41:23.160]  You have no option but to do something.
[3:41:23.160 --> 3:41:28.160]  And you are an active combatant in this system.
[3:41:28.160 --> 3:41:31.160]  We are not because the elite have declared war upon you.
[3:41:31.160 --> 3:41:33.160]  Well, that's what I do.
[3:41:33.160 --> 3:41:35.160]  I try to bring people that I respect and I think have information
[3:41:35.160 --> 3:41:38.160]  that's needed to this large platform, the biggest in alternative media.
[3:41:38.160 --> 3:41:41.160]  And that's why this platform is so precious, folks,
[3:41:41.160 --> 3:41:43.160]  and why we need your financial support.
[3:41:43.160 --> 3:41:46.160]  We're trying to do, you know, this isn't a very big operation compared to the establishment.
[3:41:46.160 --> 3:41:47.160]  It's tiny.
[3:41:47.160 --> 3:41:50.160]  But compared to the Liberty Movement, this is about as big and as strong as it gets.
[3:41:50.160 --> 3:41:52.160]  And it's very expensive.
[3:41:52.160 --> 3:41:54.160]  And so please buy the books and videos, donate.
[3:41:54.160 --> 3:41:59.160]  I'm glad to see that the auction there is over $45,000 for the bullhorn.
[3:41:59.160 --> 3:42:01.160]  I had no idea it would go that high.
[3:42:01.160 --> 3:42:04.160]  But that is very, very exciting.
[3:42:04.160 --> 3:42:08.160]  And doesn't close out until next Wednesday night.
[3:42:08.160 --> 3:42:09.160]  So we'll see what happens with that.
[3:42:09.160 --> 3:42:10.160]  But, sir, go ahead.
[3:42:10.160 --> 3:42:12.160]  Anything else you wanted to add there briefly, Bill?
[3:42:12.160 --> 3:42:13.160]  I agree with you.
[3:42:13.160 --> 3:42:17.160]  Now is the time that people are finally, while the new owner is finally emerging,
[3:42:17.160 --> 3:42:21.160]  and by the way, Governor Blagojevich has been impeached by the Illinois House,
[3:42:21.160 --> 3:42:24.160]  and he faces trial now in the Senate.
[3:42:24.160 --> 3:42:25.160]  Go ahead.
[3:42:25.160 --> 3:42:30.160]  Alex, I was just going to add that, and I've said this before, the old saying,
[3:42:30.160 --> 3:42:32.160]  of we are the ones we've been waiting for.
[3:42:32.160 --> 3:42:33.160]  I thank you.
[3:42:33.160 --> 3:42:37.160]  You guys actually had posted some of my videos on your site this week,
[3:42:37.160 --> 3:42:41.160]  and I encourage people to check out How to Stop the New World Order.
[3:42:41.160 --> 3:42:44.160]  It's Alex and David Ike giving you some information.
[3:42:44.160 --> 3:42:48.160]  It's hard-hitting, and hopefully you'll inspire you to get off your bus
[3:42:48.160 --> 3:42:49.160]  and to start becoming active.
[3:42:49.160 --> 3:42:50.160]  Thank you.
[3:42:50.160 --> 3:42:51.160]  Thank you, sir.
[3:42:51.160 --> 3:42:52.160]  Got to move on to other callers.
[3:42:52.160 --> 3:42:53.160]  Thank you.
[3:42:53.160 --> 3:42:54.160]  Let's go ahead and take another one here.
[3:42:54.160 --> 3:42:56.160]  Let's talk to Mark in Oregon.
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:42:57.160]  Mark here on the air worldwide.
[3:42:57.160 --> 3:42:58.160]  Go ahead.
[3:42:58.160 --> 3:43:03.160]  Thank you, Alex, and hello to you and hello to Alan.
[3:43:03.160 --> 3:43:09.160]  Alex, I want to just mention quickly, as a quick aside here to my main body on my call,
[3:43:09.160 --> 3:43:16.160]  I really, if you can, I would urge you to have another money bomb as soon as possible.
[3:43:16.160 --> 3:43:20.160]  I figure you've probably got a very limited amount of artifacts there,
[3:43:20.160 --> 3:43:22.160]  which would probably all auction very well.
[3:43:22.160 --> 3:43:26.160]  But if that be the case, perhaps that will take the place of a money bomb for a time.
[3:43:26.160 --> 3:43:31.160]  But whatever it takes, Alex, in order for you to be able to do your job unhindered
[3:43:31.160 --> 3:43:35.160]  by lack of funds at this point, because they're really up in the ante faster than,
[3:43:35.160 --> 3:43:40.160]  well, like you say, sometimes it takes your breath away these days, they're moving so fast.
[3:43:40.160 --> 3:43:44.160]  And they are pulling everything off the shelf at one time, using it all at one time,
[3:43:44.160 --> 3:43:46.160]  in order to overwhelm us at this point.
[3:43:46.160 --> 3:43:49.160]  This is their strategy, I firmly believe that.
[3:43:49.160 --> 3:43:55.160]  But Alan, you know, the ultra-lead, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the English royalty,
[3:43:55.160 --> 3:44:02.160]  and the royalty of the Netherlands, the Vatican, Black Jesuit sect,
[3:44:02.160 --> 3:44:06.160]  they've been promised by their God, whom they call Lucifer,
[3:44:06.160 --> 3:44:10.160]  that they're going to inherit the earth.
[3:44:10.160 --> 3:44:15.160]  And he has the name of Satan now, and he is the devil.
[3:44:15.160 --> 3:44:22.160]  But they do his bidding in order to get this deal of inheriting the whole earth eternally.
[3:44:22.160 --> 3:44:28.160]  And of course, the destruction and or aberration of all of God's creation on this planet
[3:44:28.160 --> 3:44:32.160]  is the devil's bidding, so we see that.
[3:44:32.160 --> 3:44:35.160]  But they're so under the illusion of Satan, the master of illusion,
[3:44:35.160 --> 3:44:39.160]  that they don't realize that as the Bible prophesies,
[3:44:39.160 --> 3:44:46.160]  they will fall completely in their efforts and completely fail to accomplish their efforts,
[3:44:46.160 --> 3:44:49.160]  and actually are going to burn eternally in hell.
[3:44:49.160 --> 3:44:51.160]  They're not going to destroy it all.
[3:44:51.160 --> 3:44:56.160]  Well, actually, the question part of it, Alex, is Alan, you know, to your knowledge,
[3:44:56.160 --> 3:45:04.160]  who is the elite maximus these humans are above the usual most well-known villains that I've mentioned?
[3:45:04.160 --> 3:45:08.160]  Well, you might be closer to a truth than you realize.
[3:45:08.160 --> 3:45:14.160]  There's definitely a power in this world that's making itself manifest through these people.
[3:45:14.160 --> 3:45:20.160]  And one of the symptoms of it is the fact that you can't get so many thousands of workers
[3:45:20.160 --> 3:45:25.160]  working towards this new world order, this planned horror society,
[3:45:25.160 --> 3:45:29.160]  where they're all like clones of each other on every single topic.
[3:45:29.160 --> 3:45:32.160]  That in itself is not normal, it's unnatural.
[3:45:32.160 --> 3:45:35.160]  So there's definitely something working through them.
[3:45:35.160 --> 3:45:39.160]  It's up to the individuals who do the study to figure out what it is.
[3:45:39.160 --> 3:45:43.160]  Well, people call it spirituality, but they've proven the sixth sense.
[3:45:43.160 --> 3:45:49.160]  They've proven that we're only seeing a thin band of the full spectrum,
[3:45:49.160 --> 3:45:53.160]  and the sixth sense or aborigines always know when their mother dies,
[3:45:53.160 --> 3:45:56.160]  they can be 3,000 miles away in a mine, and they come out and every time,
[3:45:56.160 --> 3:45:59.160]  you know, say an Australian, say my mother just died, flying me out there,
[3:45:59.160 --> 3:46:00.160]  and they're always right.
[3:46:00.160 --> 3:46:02.160]  I mean, and I've experienced things like that.
[3:46:02.160 --> 3:46:08.160]  And it's true, the elite are tied together by almost like a spiritual broadcasting system.
[3:46:08.160 --> 3:46:11.160]  It's like they're downloading the same evil directory.
[3:46:11.160 --> 3:46:14.160]  What is that, Alan, in your opinion?
[3:46:14.160 --> 3:46:20.160]  Well, you went into ancient writings even before what we know as the Bible was written.
[3:46:20.160 --> 3:46:25.160]  They did talk about a war, a war in the heavens and in the earth.
[3:46:25.160 --> 3:46:29.160]  This is even pre-Hebrew.
[3:46:29.160 --> 3:46:30.160]  And it wasn't over.
[3:46:30.160 --> 3:46:34.160]  It would last for thousands and thousands, maybe millions of years,
[3:46:34.160 --> 3:46:36.160]  before the next clash would come along.
[3:46:36.160 --> 3:46:41.160]  And it was, again, written about in the Zoroastrian mysteries later on
[3:46:41.160 --> 3:46:46.160]  to do with good and evil itself, always in battle with each other.
[3:46:46.160 --> 3:46:50.160]  And it's up to the individuals to say how they interpret this,
[3:46:50.160 --> 3:46:56.160]  but all you can really do, ultimately, is to interpret it according to your own personal life experience.
[3:46:56.160 --> 3:47:01.160]  Yeah, I can tell you how the elite, I can tell you how the elite interpret it.
[3:47:01.160 --> 3:47:04.160]  They're kind of along the fifth element line.
[3:47:04.160 --> 3:47:09.160]  And they understand both sides and how to manipulate both sides of it, too.
[3:47:09.160 --> 3:47:14.160]  Well, that's the Illuminati Mystery Religion is the balance that they believe in.
[3:47:14.160 --> 3:47:15.160]  Thank you, sir. I appreciate your call.
[3:47:15.160 --> 3:47:21.160]  Michael, Dan and Scott, final call straight ahead with the always intriguing Alan Watt.
[3:47:21.160 --> 3:47:46.160]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:47:51.160 --> 3:48:16.160]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:48:16.160 --> 3:48:42.160]  It is a big idea, a new world order in the near future. Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:48:42.160 --> 3:48:46.160]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[3:48:46.160 --> 3:48:48.160]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:48:48.160 --> 3:48:51.160]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:48:51.160 --> 3:49:02.160]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:49:02.160 --> 3:49:07.160]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:49:07.160 --> 3:49:11.160]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:49:11.160 --> 3:49:14.160]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[3:49:14.160 --> 3:49:17.160]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[3:49:17.160 --> 3:49:19.160]  They're after power. Yes, they're after easy.

[3:50:42.160 --> 3:50:50.160]  Before I do that, I wanted to tell the listeners about another one of the sponsors that made this show possible.
[3:50:50.160 --> 3:51:06.160]  Great product. MySolarBackup.com, 877-327-0365. It's a really high quality unit that's designed to provide 800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster out as you get the emergency power backup kit.
[3:51:06.160 --> 3:51:12.160]  The Power Source 1800 power plant, a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[3:51:12.160 --> 3:51:22.160]  MySolarBackup.com, you can always call them toll free at 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[3:51:22.160 --> 3:51:28.160]  Also, again the website, MySolarBackup.com, it's a great unit.
[3:51:28.160 --> 3:51:38.160]  We'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Want to plug that in the rebroadcast with Russell Means, one of the biggest Native American leaders in the country about the Palestine situation.
[3:51:38.160 --> 3:51:46.160]  Then we hand Bob Chapman on and of course Alan Watt, restreaming until Sunday when we're live at infowars.com and the free podcast.
[3:51:46.160 --> 3:52:01.160]  That 120,000 people plus are subscribing to each day for free at infowars.com. In closing, I want you to visit cuttingthemedricks.com and we'll throw that up on the prisonplanet.tv screen right now for you.
[3:52:01.160 --> 3:52:08.160]  And buy some of Alan Watt's books and videos because he's barely scraping by and just does such important work and so that's why we have him here.
[3:52:08.160 --> 3:52:18.160]  So be sure and supporting there at the site by actually buying some of the books and videos. He's got it all up there for free too, but you need to purchase some of this and have hard copies and support him.
[3:52:18.160 --> 3:52:25.160]  Okay, let's jam in a few final calls here. Michael in mass, quick question for Alan Watt.
[3:52:25.160 --> 3:52:27.160]  Hey, how's it going gentlemen?
[3:52:27.160 --> 3:52:28.160]  Pretty good.
[3:52:28.160 --> 3:52:41.160]  I wanted to bring up a topic for kind of deep, I don't know, deep conversations if you can get deep sophisticated on this one. The document called silent weapons for quiet wars.
[3:52:41.160 --> 3:52:42.160]  Colonel Alexander.
[3:52:42.160 --> 3:52:49.160]  Absolutely. To me that document, I mean, that's basically the Rosetta Stone for the New World Order plan.
[3:52:49.160 --> 3:52:54.160]  Oh no, they're cell towers, they're chemtrails. We're being hit with silent soft-kill weapons.
[3:52:54.160 --> 3:53:03.160]  Absolutely, it's all in there. You know, I'm sure you guys probably weren't prepared for like a real deep convo on this, but I was hoping that maybe in the future, you know, you guys could get together.
[3:53:03.160 --> 3:53:07.160]  Sir, we're totally prepared, but we got two minutes left.
[3:53:07.160 --> 3:53:10.160]  All right, Alan, what do you think?
[3:53:10.160 --> 3:53:29.160]  Yeah, as Brzezinski said at the Tetronic era, he mentioned this technology briefly, but it's been set up for what is old technology, but now we're setting up the equipment publicly in high concentration areas, and it will be used during the coming riots.
[3:53:29.160 --> 3:53:32.160]  I've been trying to...
[3:53:32.160 --> 3:53:33.160]  Go ahead.
[3:53:33.160 --> 3:53:48.160]  I've been trying to kind of talk to a lot of... I live in Massachusetts, and there's, you know, a huge Masonic community in this particular state, and I'm trying to explain to a lot of these people that, you know, they don't always tell you the truth, even if you aren't an initiate, and I try to explain...
[3:53:48.160 --> 3:53:58.160]  I want to know if I'm accurate when I say this. Most of the symbology has two meanings, and they use the dual meanings for psychological profiles.
[3:53:58.160 --> 3:54:03.160]  All right, let me explain how it works in a nutshell, and we got to end the show, and I appreciate your call, and I'm sorry the other callers.
[3:54:03.160 --> 3:54:10.160]  I promise, next time's Alan on, you call and say, you got cut off, you'll go to the head of the line, and we'll let Alan close the show out with his comment on this.
[3:54:10.160 --> 3:54:17.160]  It's triple, quadruple meaning, the porch masons, the masons, you can argue they were taken over, they're always bad.
[3:54:17.160 --> 3:54:23.160]  It's meant to control good men, and so later, as higher-level masons, they make them write out, what would you do in this situation?
[3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:24.160]  What would you do in that situation?
[3:54:24.160 --> 3:54:30.160]  If you're a good person, they say, oh, good, you're one of us, but they shelve you. If you're evil, they raise you up and elevate you.
[3:54:30.160 --> 3:54:32.160]  Alan, what? Closing comments on that.
[3:54:32.160 --> 3:54:36.160]  Well, they ask them at the top, do you want to have the crown, or do you want to be a servant?
[3:54:36.160 --> 3:54:43.160]  So when it takes the crown, it's brought to the sidelines. Everything's a test, yeah.
[3:54:43.160 --> 3:54:45.160]  Absolutely. Anything else, Alan?
[3:54:45.160 --> 3:54:54.160]  Yes, the lower masons, as Pike said, are just the outer portico, they're no different, they know no more than the general public, but they're useful idiots.
[3:54:54.160 --> 3:54:58.160]  Alan Watt, great talking to you. We'll talk to you again in the near future, God bless.
[3:54:58.160 --> 3:55:00.160]  And you too.
[3:55:00.160 --> 3:55:03.160]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen. Rebroadcast starts one place.
[3:55:03.160 --> 3:55:09.160]  Infowars.com right now. We'll be back in one minute. Stay with us. Have a great weekend.
[3:55:09.160 --> 3:55:15.160]  Great job.
