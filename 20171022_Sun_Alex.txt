[00:45.440 --> 00:51.000]  channel cast at 8 a.m. in the morning and then my broadcast is followed at 3 p.m.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.640]  by the War Room with Owen Schreuer man Vegas is definitely a cover-up of
[00:56.640 --> 01:00.680]  multiple shooters just like my sources in the FBI said when the bodies weren't
[01:00.680 --> 01:04.520]  even cold sadly three weeks ago that's all coming out Vegas bombshell video
[01:04.520 --> 01:08.760]  shows 17 ambulances pulling bodies out of Hooters I mean there were shootings
[01:08.760 --> 01:12.560]  all over the real numbers are being covered up DARPA has come out admitted
[01:12.560 --> 01:16.560]  the World Economic Forum they can mind control you with waves from a distance
[01:16.560 --> 01:20.440]  that's coming up and so much more Trump's got the globalists on the run but
[01:20.440 --> 01:26.160]  first a key report ladies and gentlemen dealing with convicted pedophiles still
[01:26.160 --> 01:33.360]  working in Hollywood at this very moment a convicted child molester is in
[01:33.360 --> 01:38.200]  close proximity to child actors directing them in a fantasy of his own
[01:38.200 --> 01:43.520]  making this idea about a boy who could touch people and see how they die and
[01:43.520 --> 01:48.440]  how it would affect his life and that was a mystery to him most of his life
[01:48.440 --> 01:52.960]  and I thought well why don't we let him find out why and let it be the most
[01:52.960 --> 01:56.440]  awful thing he should have never found out to begin with so we kind of just ran
[01:56.440 --> 02:01.360]  with it like that a product of Miramax and Disney praised and supported by
[02:01.360 --> 02:06.840]  film industry icons like Francis Ford Copeland Victor Salva was convicted of
[02:06.840 --> 02:12.160]  molesting the star of his debut movie Clownhouse back in 1988 the actor
[02:12.160 --> 02:17.000]  speaking of his abuse Nathan Forrest Winters said of Salva he spent the
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.680]  better part of a year grooming me and my parents developing the trust it was
[02:21.680 --> 02:27.440]  very calculated and a long process as it is with most pedophiles regardless
[02:27.440 --> 02:33.000]  that Salva spent three years in prison for the molestation his career resumed
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.680]  after he was released in a recent film of Salva's titled Jeepers Creepers 3
[02:38.680 --> 02:44.160]  Salva even wrote a scene in normalizing the sexual abuse between a stepfather
[02:44.160 --> 02:49.800]  and his stepdaughter Salva's latest film Old Hag Syndrome is described as a
[02:49.800 --> 02:54.160]  psychological thriller centered around the nightmares of children Kit Daniels
[02:54.160 --> 02:58.560]  writes not long after the Walt Disney Company bought Bob and Harvey Weinstein's
[02:58.560 --> 03:04.720]  company Miramax in 1993 convicted child molester Victor Salva was pegged to
[03:04.720 --> 03:09.280]  direct Disney's film Powder this is important to note because Disney now
[03:09.280 --> 03:14.200]  faces potential lawsuits for doing nothing about Harvey Weinstein's
[03:14.200 --> 03:19.760]  alleged predatory behavior if Disney knew or had reason to know and Weinstein
[03:19.760 --> 03:25.760]  stayed on with Disney to help Miramax until 2005 the LA Times reported on
[03:25.760 --> 03:32.040]  October 31st 1995 as controversy swirled around filmmaker Victor Salva
[03:32.040 --> 03:37.480]  Salva's agents said that a good showing at the box office may salvage the 37
[03:37.480 --> 03:42.000]  year old director's career at least three studios are meeting with him one has
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.360]  already given Victor scripts to read three studios had no problem hiring a
[03:47.360 --> 03:51.960]  convicted child molester as long as he produced a good showing at the box
[03:51.960 --> 03:56.480]  office is it any surprise then how Weinstein was able to get away with his
[03:56.480 --> 04:01.720]  reported behavior for decades meanwhile Harvey Weinstein according to page 6
[04:01.720 --> 04:06.760]  is arriving to his group therapy sessions 15 minutes late and when it was
[04:06.760 --> 04:10.520]  his turn to speak launched into a speech about how this is all a
[04:10.520 --> 04:16.480]  conspiracy against him in related Hollywood implosion news Jeff Bezos had
[04:16.480 --> 04:21.880]  known for two years about ousted Amazon Studios chief Roy Price's behavior on
[04:21.880 --> 04:27.040]  top of Price's sexual power trips he was also trying to get his own sketchy
[04:27.040 --> 04:31.320]  show off the ground about a young woman who is sold into sex slavery to a
[04:31.320 --> 04:36.360]  psychotic Imperial Tide dwarf named Mr. Goodtimes where she is drugged
[04:36.360 --> 04:42.240]  bashed with a machete and told she will be assaulted like a dead fish is it just
[04:42.240 --> 04:46.720]  me or does it seem like Hollywood should be injected with a huge dose of
[04:46.720 --> 04:51.800]  penicillin seven black athletes and one white guy James Tobak with 15 to 20

[06:45.080 --> 06:48.520]  our intrepid crew because there's so much news that develops Saturday into
[06:48.520 --> 06:51.800]  Sunday as we kick off the new week then of course there's the weekday
[06:51.800 --> 06:56.960]  transmission 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. all times Texas all times central that's 12 noon
[06:56.960 --> 07:04.280]  Easter when we kick off the transmission news wars.com is our newest site and of
[07:04.280 --> 07:08.520]  course info wars.com is the flagship but there's a lot of original news and
[07:08.520 --> 07:13.160]  videos and articles and research that appear at news wars.com and the
[07:13.160 --> 07:17.280]  prison planet.com that do not appear at info wars.com and the globalists are
[07:17.280 --> 07:20.840]  working around the clock admittedly to make sure that people don't see those
[07:20.840 --> 07:25.280]  links and see those videos we have the head of YouTube's programming the head
[07:25.280 --> 07:28.760]  of their liaison with the mainstream media admitting their main mission was
[07:28.760 --> 07:34.000]  blocking info wars I mean I don't need that undercover video from Veritas to
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.400]  already know that if we have a video with a million views in one day and I
[07:38.400 --> 07:44.560]  go to the trending section and they've got videos with 20,000 views in one day
[07:44.560 --> 07:48.520]  or a hundred thousand in one day that are at the top of the list you know the
[07:48.520 --> 07:55.320]  list is fake you know they're acting like there's a you and YouTube the reason I
[07:55.320 --> 08:00.720]  raised that is the gaming is all around us but despite that they're losing look
[08:00.720 --> 08:05.480]  at this Jimmy Carter has come out and said that Trump's doing a good job on
[08:05.480 --> 08:09.720]  the economy and many other areas and said that Hillary and the Clintons and
[08:09.720 --> 08:15.400]  Obama have done a terrible job and that they have basically lied about the
[08:15.400 --> 08:21.240]  Russia connection to Trump and are trying to throw America under the bus now
[08:21.240 --> 08:24.840]  Jimmy Carter ladies and gentlemen did that after he went to that fundraiser at
[08:24.840 --> 08:32.120]  college station Friday night with four other presidents and reportedly there
[08:32.120 --> 08:37.040]  was a lot of bad mouthing of the president the current president on and
[08:37.040 --> 08:42.040]  off the stage and we've got some of that coming up and so Carter has made his
[08:42.040 --> 08:47.600]  decision to go with making America great again there in his quiet years and I've
[08:47.600 --> 08:51.800]  seen him give speeches he's still all there he's got his problems and
[08:51.800 --> 08:55.480]  definitely sold us off the Communist Chinese and other things but the fact
[08:55.480 --> 09:00.000]  is is that I think he knows when to jump ship ladies and gentlemen so we've got
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.640]  that big news Jimmy Carter let's loose Knox Obama and Hillary says Russia
[09:04.640 --> 09:12.880]  didn't alter election crazes Trump that's coming up Victor Salva is in the
[09:12.880 --> 09:16.600]  news because he was hired by Harry Weinstein you know he was convicted of
[09:16.600 --> 09:21.160]  raping a 12-year-old boy brutally on the set and other reported crimes he was
[09:21.160 --> 09:25.480]  alleged to have committed now that's back in the news but guess what Corey
[09:25.480 --> 09:31.440]  Feldman the big child actor he was set this week to go public in fact he went
[09:31.440 --> 09:35.120]  on the view and said that he was about to go public about young boys being
[09:35.120 --> 09:40.520]  raped by men in Hollywood big directors and producers and lawyers he got SWAT
[09:40.520 --> 09:47.840]  team rated yesterday in a supposed drug raid isn't that convenient timing as the
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.360]  deep state clearly strikes back oh and there's another report alleged Pito
[09:52.360 --> 09:57.680]  Peter Yarrow to perform at women for peace rally outside the Pentagon
[09:57.680 --> 10:04.240]  Washington Free Beacon is reporting as Pito gate continues to break big time
[10:04.240 --> 10:10.200]  and that is the next shoot a drop on the sexual assault reports pouring out of
[10:10.200 --> 10:18.440]  California now speaking of Trump and the global awakening when you have the
[10:18.440 --> 10:22.480]  entire mainstream media and all these foreign governments and all these
[10:22.480 --> 10:26.080]  communist states and all these authoritarian media combines and
[10:26.080 --> 10:30.080]  Silicon Valley the big tech companies when you've got the big internet
[10:30.080 --> 10:39.320]  companies all of them lined up against the American people all of them lined
[10:39.320 --> 10:44.800]  up trying to force their globalist agenda to transfer our national sovereignty
[10:44.800 --> 10:52.000]  out of the country into unelected multinational secret boards and the
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.640]  agreements are even secret but then WikiLeaks leaks them and it's more
[10:56.640 --> 11:02.480]  authoritarian than you could ever imagine Congress couldn't even see it
[11:02.480 --> 11:08.400]  Trump comes in and kills TPP day one that was designed to impoverish the US and
[11:08.400 --> 11:12.720]  transfer our wealth offshore was even in the documents it's not that he's an
[11:12.720 --> 11:18.440]  angel he's just not an SOB who wants to mount America's head on the wall and
[11:18.440 --> 11:23.760]  that's his crime and I saw a bunch of articles over the weekend to acting
[11:23.760 --> 11:27.160]  general Kelly I'm gonna cover these towards the end of the broadcast today
[11:27.160 --> 11:31.640]  but there's several segments on it when he came out and I've been critical
[11:31.640 --> 11:38.760]  some of Kelly kind of cloistering or putting the president in a high tower
[11:38.760 --> 11:41.680]  and restricting what info gets to him but I understand they call that command
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.160]  and control but he came out with this whole Fred Rica Wilson Congresswoman
[11:46.160 --> 11:49.680]  debacle and said I've listened in on these phone calls the president and
[11:49.680 --> 11:54.160]  they're very very powerful they're very very loving they're very very courage
[11:54.160 --> 11:58.400]  filled they're very very helpful and basically I coached the president on
[11:58.400 --> 12:05.240]  what to say the Congresswoman came out and called him a racist for saying she
[12:05.240 --> 12:10.920]  was stupid no she is stupid and opportunistic she's on CNN calling
[12:10.920 --> 12:17.080]  herself a rock star now that she did this grabbing on to these hearse grabbing
[12:17.080 --> 12:21.880]  on to these coffins grabbing on to these funerals grabbing on to the
[12:21.880 --> 12:25.480]  telephones listening to private conversations inserting herself you're
[12:25.480 --> 12:30.600]  running to people's houses as soon as she hears that their husbands died she
[12:30.600 --> 12:34.040]  knows that call from the president's coming so she can get in the middle of
[12:34.040 --> 12:40.200]  it that isn't just stupid that's pig like and I love how she wears that big
[12:40.200 --> 12:44.200]  blue cowboy hat and how could be Sanders White House press secretary White House
[12:44.200 --> 12:49.560]  press spokeswoman said all hat no cattle and I saw the gift going around on I
[12:49.560 --> 12:55.040]  retweeted it real Alex Jones it was also on James Woods's Twitter and it was a
[12:55.040 --> 13:00.560]  all hat no cattle it was cowboys and Indians and it's her with Congresswoman
[13:00.560 --> 13:06.520]  senator Warren as Pocahontas with a little feather in her little feather in
[13:06.520 --> 13:11.720]  her little headdress like Pocahontas I mean this is next level but again why are
[13:11.720 --> 13:16.600]  they so scared what are they pushing what are they doing they know we have a
[13:16.600 --> 13:20.600]  3.1% growth rate something Obama never had they know they're creating a
[13:20.600 --> 13:24.360]  controlled economy they know they're at odds with an American free market system
[13:24.360 --> 13:29.400]  they know they want to show up the market and they know Trump is bringing
[13:29.400 --> 13:34.760]  that system back so they are panicking Trump's very close to getting big tax
[13:34.760 --> 13:40.120]  cuts they're saying that will create 7% growth rate ladies and gentlemen we
[13:40.120 --> 13:46.040]  haven't had that since the 60s China has enjoyed 8 to 15% growth rates for 50
[13:46.040 --> 13:51.400]  years since the globalists sold us out to them so if they can have 10% growth
[13:51.400 --> 13:57.000]  rates on average we can have a 7% growth rate and that will pay off the debt
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.480]  only booms pay off debts when you free spending can still stay where it is it's
[14:02.480 --> 14:07.080]  skyrocket levels but every mainline economist even admits the only way to
[14:07.080 --> 14:11.880]  break this things back is to massively cut taxes the poor people middle class
[14:11.880 --> 14:15.680]  cut the corporate tax we have the highest in the world written to make it
[14:15.680 --> 14:19.640]  prohibitive to have jobs here this is a plan they brag about it in WikiLeaks it's
[14:19.640 --> 14:24.600]  all public it's globalism picking and choosing winners and to just rev up that
[14:24.600 --> 14:29.880]  economy have massive tax receipts come in because we cut taxes more money comes
[14:29.880 --> 14:33.680]  in because the economy speeds up every time and then start paying down that debt
[14:33.680 --> 14:39.120]  and Trump intends to try to keep spending where it is and then bring in
[14:39.120 --> 14:43.880]  those tax cuts we get that we keep the fellow reserve from raising interest
[14:43.880 --> 14:49.760]  rates too much we will fix the global economy not just ours because it's easy
[14:49.760 --> 14:54.120]  to fix we have exuberance we have technology we have machines we have the
[14:54.120 --> 14:57.840]  super industrial high-tech revolution we have incredible innovation the global
[14:57.840 --> 15:01.320]  submit they're trying to quote keep things from overheating in the economy
[15:01.320 --> 15:06.520]  because they want a controlled economy that they manage and I know I beat this
[15:06.520 --> 15:09.960]  horse a lot because it's not a dead horse and it's the horse we're gonna ride
[15:09.960 --> 15:14.120]  out of the New World Order on so that's why they're so against the Trump
[15:14.120 --> 15:18.720]  agenda and that's why Maxine Waters says quote we will take him out that's a
[15:18.720 --> 15:22.440]  new video coming up next segment that's why the BBC jokes about him getting
[15:22.440 --> 15:27.080]  killed it's why a lot of media said oh yeah what are you gonna release the JFK
[15:27.080 --> 15:31.880]  files before we kill you Joe Rogan made that point he said yeah it's a smart
[15:31.880 --> 15:35.000]  thing to do because they're trying to kill him I'm gonna play that clip from
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.640]  Joe Rogan as well coming up but of course we told you on Friday that he was
[15:39.640 --> 15:43.440]  set to release him he was looking to release him he told info wars reporter

[20:59.320 --> 21:07.680]  breaking original hard-hitting news on Hollywood pedophilia being the next
[21:07.680 --> 21:13.600]  shoot-a-drop with Harvey Weinstein we told you that a month ago specifically
[21:13.600 --> 21:18.560]  with Gary Epstein and the little Lita Express and Bill Clinton and his flights
[21:18.560 --> 21:26.280]  on those that is in major New York and LA papers this week just Friday we said
[21:26.280 --> 21:30.640]  that we talked to the president Roger did another one of my sources did very
[21:30.640 --> 21:33.680]  close to me not gonna get into that source who talked to the president
[21:33.680 --> 21:38.960]  Friday and the president was strongly looking at it and said barring any new
[21:38.960 --> 21:45.240]  information from Pompeo the CIA director that he's going to release it and that's
[21:45.240 --> 21:50.800]  what Roger said on Friday it's what I said my source said and you notice on
[21:50.800 --> 21:56.040]  Saturday morning the president tweeted that barring any new information that he
[21:56.040 --> 22:00.440]  was going to release the information next Friday because the president can
[22:00.440 --> 22:05.320]  block the release of it and Obama and George Bush did block the last two times
[22:05.320 --> 22:10.440]  they were gonna release it and boy do they have to eat crow now if you read
[22:10.440 --> 22:14.120]  the New York Times the Washington Post the LA Times the Chicago Tribune it says
[22:14.120 --> 22:20.680]  that okay Roger stone Alex Jones broke the information on Friday now that same
[22:20.680 --> 22:27.000]  day they all reported that we had made it up they said fake news Alex Jones had
[22:27.000 --> 22:32.760]  Roger stone on and they claim they talked to the president they well we've
[22:32.760 --> 22:38.320]  talked to our sources and it's not gonna be released yeah cuz Pompeo who does a
[22:38.320 --> 22:42.480]  pretty good job overall actually like a lot of what he's doing focusing spying
[22:42.480 --> 22:46.120]  on you know foreign enemies not the American people and not trying to use
[22:46.120 --> 22:49.840]  the CIA as a globalist tool to deindustrialize the nation but Pompeo
[22:49.840 --> 22:54.080]  has been fighting with the president not to release it and thought he had the
[22:54.080 --> 22:58.400]  era the president but as of now it's gonna be released and who knows what's
[22:58.400 --> 23:03.360]  gonna be in there some little birds have looked over it and know what the body
[23:03.360 --> 23:06.320]  of it is and a lot of it is the information given to the Warren
[23:06.320 --> 23:11.600]  Commission back in the 60s and the Congressional Commission the 70s now
[23:11.600 --> 23:15.080]  the Congressional Commission you never hear about but it's the one that found
[23:15.080 --> 23:19.400]  that more than one gunman did kill the president and then he was killed in a
[23:19.400 --> 23:25.400]  conspiracy probably organized by the CIA boy don't you wish Jim Mars the
[23:25.400 --> 23:29.160]  professor just died a few months ago it was still here first guy to ever teach
[23:29.160 --> 23:32.560]  a college course on JFK assassination he was a Fort Worth Stark Telegram
[23:32.560 --> 23:37.560]  reporter when that happened he was older than he looked he was a nice little
[23:37.560 --> 23:41.760]  garden home good friend of mine I was literally about to call him up that week
[23:41.760 --> 23:44.880]  getting back on the show Mike where's Jim been he usually calls and once on the
[23:44.880 --> 23:49.120]  show I'll sell my producers let's get him on the next month boom I went home
[23:49.120 --> 23:52.600]  that day George Norrie called me and said don't say this yet I just got calls
[23:52.600 --> 23:57.960]  from his family he just died minutes ago anyways good old Jim I know he's
[23:57.960 --> 24:00.840]  looking down from heaven he knew there was a spiritual thing to this little he
[24:00.840 --> 24:07.080]  knew Jack Ruby he used to go to the same bar now back then it was more classy it
[24:07.080 --> 24:12.400]  was burlesque but it was only one in Dallas and he was 21 already a reporter
[24:12.400 --> 24:17.920]  on the crime crime beat and a new old Jack Ruby what a what what a storyteller
[24:17.920 --> 24:22.440]  he could he could he could certainly certainly break down some things but I
[24:22.440 --> 24:29.640]  am digressing get into old yarns here it's twilight zone to imagine though that
[24:29.640 --> 24:34.400]  I in 2017 would have a direct conduit to the president and that we would be
[24:34.400 --> 24:38.800]  breaking that the JFK files are about to come out so we have a pretty good idea
[24:38.800 --> 24:44.760]  what's in those files and we're gonna tell you coming up at the start of the
[24:44.760 --> 24:48.680]  next hour now even if I had sources I wouldn't tell you I got it from
[24:48.680 --> 24:54.480]  classified sources I just say I have a pretty good idea what is gonna be in
[24:54.480 --> 25:02.920]  those files next Friday so I'm gonna stop right there now a bunch of
[25:02.920 --> 25:07.320]  publications including BBC there's an article up on infowars.com about this
[25:07.320 --> 25:12.800]  made jokes about the president BBC journalist defense tweet about Trump
[25:12.800 --> 25:16.880]  motorcade after JFK doc announcements after announcing the release of documents
[25:16.880 --> 25:21.680]  with JFK assassination president Trump goes on an uneventful motor ride so
[25:21.680 --> 25:25.800]  they're just making their jokes about him being suicided or or assassinated
[25:25.800 --> 25:30.560]  Arkansas did let's play a clip of off the rails I don't know who's more seen
[25:30.560 --> 25:38.120]  now and baddie is it is it somebody like the Democrat leader in the house
[25:38.120 --> 25:42.920]  Nancy Pelosi or is it is it Maxine Waters just you know this other Congress
[25:42.920 --> 25:48.160]  woman Fred Rica William she says don't call me stupid that's racist well lady
[25:48.160 --> 25:51.680]  you are stupid and you're a jerk and you're a creep and you lot about what
[25:51.680 --> 25:54.880]  was in the phone call or you lot about listening in now it turns out you were
[25:54.880 --> 25:58.640]  there and again you're all hat no cattle don't care if you're black or white
[25:58.640 --> 26:05.080]  you're a bunch of crazy old women we're tired of you now she demands an
[26:05.080 --> 26:08.800]  apology from Kelly for character assassination keeps wearing that stupid
[26:08.800 --> 26:14.160]  cowboy hat I think it's done with men that own cattle ranches of 20,000 head
[26:14.160 --> 26:18.680]  where cowboy hats on TV cowboy hats route the Sun woman
[26:18.680 --> 26:24.120]  don't receive me wearing a cowboy hat and I got cows and I got a ranch I got a
[26:24.120 --> 26:28.040]  ranch that we got from the Mexicans we paid for it you got one of those
[26:28.040 --> 26:34.480]  stop wearing a cowboy hat stop it excuse me let's go ahead and go to a clip of
[26:34.480 --> 26:37.800]  off the rails Maxine Waters saying she's oh and by the way YouTube's been
[26:37.800 --> 26:41.840]  taking this video down everywhere not claiming even copyright they just don't
[26:41.840 --> 26:52.520]  want you to see her unhinged here it is Wow what a moving evening this is I am
[26:52.520 --> 27:01.400]  sitting here listening watching absorbing thinking about Ali even though I
[27:01.400 --> 27:07.520]  never met him and with this kind of inspiration I will go and take Trump out
[27:07.520 --> 27:13.080]  tonight take him out tonight that's definitely the tenor you know hashtag
[27:13.080 --> 27:17.160]  hunt Republicans now didn't they they claim we're the ones that are called
[27:17.160 --> 27:21.160]  for violence let's go ahead now clear shades of violence there let's play Joe
[27:21.160 --> 27:24.840]  Rogan making his point that he thinks Trump's smart to do this and I agree here
[27:24.840 --> 27:29.480]  it is you hear that Donald Trump's gonna open up the JFK dump how about that all
[27:29.480 --> 27:33.440]  the dump of documents from the JFK that had been sealed up by all the other
[27:33.440 --> 27:38.280]  presidents like the JFK assassination investigation they sealed some
[27:38.280 --> 27:42.120]  documents up because they're too sensitive I know whatever those documents
[27:42.120 --> 27:47.720]  aren't they shred those documents how could I know why would damning documents
[27:47.720 --> 27:53.320]  be exist these are people from 1962 also Trump for sure folks on something else
[27:53.320 --> 27:57.920]  than this hey this is not a bad thing to focus on if so many other things yeah
[27:57.920 --> 28:02.760]  but for sure but first of all no one really can be president let's be honest
[28:02.760 --> 28:05.680]  there's not a single person that could focus on the economy and health care
[28:05.680 --> 28:11.120]  and international relations environment like there's no way to be pain you've
[28:11.120 --> 28:13.800]  got the taxes but there's not enough time in the world to focus on any of those
[28:13.800 --> 28:17.720]  things so when he should focus on Donald Trump should focus on the Vegas shooting
[28:17.720 --> 28:22.320]  that he hasn't said about it that's all right you know what I mean well he
[28:22.320 --> 28:26.360]  probably got a good point I think going on but here's the thing about this this
[28:26.360 --> 28:30.520]  Kennedy assassination one of the reasons why if I was him I would focus on the
[28:30.520 --> 28:35.440]  Kennedy assassination they might kill him like it's entirely possible that he's
[28:35.440 --> 28:40.160]  thinking that he could get assassinated 100% you don't mean that's why he's
[28:40.160 --> 28:43.800]  opening it they would I wouldn't think there was any files like why would they
[28:43.800 --> 28:46.960]  those files exist it should have been burned along by the way I'm gonna get
[28:46.960 --> 28:50.000]  answer that question we come back for Eddie Bravo and I'm gonna get into the
[28:50.000 --> 28:55.240]  latest bombshell Vegas info they got 1015 ambulances or more picking up
[28:55.240 --> 29:00.400]  people at another building that have been shot we got video not a group you

[34:05.520 --> 34:10.120]  fact that he broke the information here Friday that the president said he was
[34:10.120 --> 34:16.360]  looking to release the files unless he got any countervailing information and
[34:16.360 --> 34:20.320]  I remember saying to Roger on the phone Thursday night and Friday morning I said
[34:20.320 --> 34:26.640]  Roger if Trump says he's gonna release it barring new information let's just say
[34:26.640 --> 34:31.400]  that he said no because I don't want to influence it he goes I think he's gonna
[34:31.400 --> 34:34.680]  do the right thing and you already say that on air he said no they're saying
[34:34.680 --> 34:38.520]  he ain't gonna release it in the news that's not true he's leaning towards it
[34:38.520 --> 34:43.200]  and I think he will and then Saturday morning the president came out and said
[34:43.200 --> 34:48.960]  just that and what's in these files I don't just have a good idea a lot of what
[34:48.960 --> 34:51.720]  was in the Warren Commission and in the Congressional Commission that came
[34:51.720 --> 34:55.840]  after that the Commission's found two different things the Warren Commission
[34:55.840 --> 34:58.920]  is funny is a $3 bill with a bunch of people that were involved actually in
[34:58.920 --> 35:04.520]  the operation clear conflict of interest the Warren Commission it found
[35:04.520 --> 35:07.960]  single gunman the Congressional Commission you never hear about in the
[35:07.960 --> 35:13.080]  media much bigger much more lengthy and part of it classified said oh yeah
[35:13.080 --> 35:20.320]  multiple shooters deep state operation you can pull up the Congressional JFK
[35:20.320 --> 35:26.400]  assassination Commission and read its findings for yourself so I know what's
[35:26.400 --> 35:30.920]  in those files a lot of it ended up leaking I've had some of the Congressmen
[35:30.920 --> 35:35.920]  and folks before they died on and I had Admiral Moore on former chairman of the
[35:35.920 --> 35:40.720]  Joint Chiefs two weeks before he died I didn't realize it was like a deathbed
[35:40.720 --> 35:46.320]  confession that he was having congested heart failure and I called Newsmax up
[35:46.320 --> 35:50.480]  like a month later and said can I get Admiral Moore back on they said the Admiral
[35:50.480 --> 35:56.240]  just died but that was on other issues about the New World Order and the
[35:56.240 --> 35:59.400]  globalists and the plan to sell out the country and hand over the Panama Canal
[35:59.400 --> 36:05.200]  and all our secrets to Communist China and again people keep being the
[36:05.200 --> 36:09.000]  government's the problem I want constitutional limited government I'm
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.760]  not an anarchist I want a republic back and the government's not our enemy it's
[36:14.760 --> 36:18.360]  the bad people that have hijacked the government that are our enemy and the
[36:18.360 --> 36:23.440]  media always misrepresents what I'm saying to say Jones believes in no
[36:23.440 --> 36:28.200]  government or Jones hates everybody in government or Jones is anti-government or
[36:28.200 --> 36:32.920]  Jones is gloom and doom and believes the world's gonna end and he believes in
[36:32.920 --> 36:37.880]  space aliens it's always the same stuff I believe we can save the world God
[36:37.880 --> 36:41.960]  helps those that helps themselves trust in God pray to God but row away from the
[36:41.960 --> 36:48.680]  rocks honor S. Thompson quote that's basically a paraphrase of a Bedouin
[36:48.680 --> 36:54.400]  saying trusting God but type your camel you know trust in God but God helps those
[36:54.400 --> 36:58.440]  that it helps themselves God gave us common sense ladies and gentlemen God
[36:58.440 --> 37:02.240]  made us that's God helping you right there now you do the right thing and
[37:02.240 --> 37:07.040]  then have courage God will almost always take the rest away unless it's part of
[37:07.040 --> 37:11.000]  God's plan you be an example as long as my experience you just give in to
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.200]  whatever God's plan is don't worry about it God's gonna get you then people that
[37:15.200 --> 37:19.240]  are like that odds with God and believe in God but think God's like their slave
[37:19.240 --> 37:23.320]  and think God's there to be bossed around that's not the way to get through
[37:23.320 --> 37:27.680]  to God I'm just telling you right now and God isn't looking for hypocrites
[37:27.680 --> 37:30.960]  either and people that pray up on top the hilltop tell everybody how great
[37:30.960 --> 37:38.000]  they are God's looking for action I'm gonna stop right there but Trump is
[37:38.000 --> 37:43.520]  doing so much good that I just felt like I should come on air and thank God for
[37:43.520 --> 37:49.320]  you the listeners and thank God for Trump and thank God for everything and
[37:49.320 --> 37:52.720]  this great crew we've got in all the Providence we would mirror without you
[37:52.720 --> 37:58.280]  and I mean that so heartfelt this isn't me you're stroking you I feel like I'm
[37:58.280 --> 38:03.400]  not doing my job unless I tell you how special you are and how amazing you are
[38:03.400 --> 38:06.720]  no matter what color your skin is or where you came from if you want liberty
[38:06.720 --> 38:10.200]  you understand justice you see these things you feel these things you know
[38:10.200 --> 38:13.500]  these things because you've got discernment you've got a connection to
[38:13.500 --> 38:18.680]  God you're you're a person that has a connection to justice you're not of the
[38:18.680 --> 38:25.800]  evil force and that evil force wants to destroy you and me and you will know a
[38:25.800 --> 38:30.000]  man or a woman by their enemies and by their fruits and you look at the whole
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.240]  world as Christ said if you're for me the world to be against you the whole
[38:33.240 --> 38:39.920]  world Hollywood the globalist all the structures are against Trump because
[38:39.920 --> 38:47.840]  he's not out to get you and he wants justice in prosperity and they don't
[38:47.840 --> 38:52.240]  know what to do and they're getting more and more panicked and more and more
[38:52.240 --> 38:56.320]  angry as the economy comes back and as Trump begins to have success and as they
[38:56.320 --> 39:07.520]  begin to get on the run from Spain to Brazil to Australia to the UK to Iceland
[39:07.520 --> 39:15.680]  to all over the world the United States to what just happened two weeks ago in
[39:15.680 --> 39:20.800]  Austria electing a Donald Trump type populist and a Czech election just
[39:20.800 --> 39:26.560]  elected babies in a huge large margin and the guy literally sounds like info
[39:26.560 --> 39:29.720]  wars I know folks have been over the Czech Republic and met with him remember
[39:29.720 --> 39:32.160]  hearing like six months ago you know who babes is you know babes is you ought to
[39:32.160 --> 39:34.640]  go to you know you ought to go to the Republic he likes you I'm not bragging
[39:34.640 --> 39:40.960]  oh babes knows who I am and likes me the point is it's like a Ron Paul boom he
[39:40.960 --> 39:46.520]  just won huge the Czech Republic it's happening everywhere and now people in
[39:46.520 --> 39:50.780]  Africa are saying we want free market we don't want communism there's all
[39:50.780 --> 39:53.280]  these videos in different African languages translated English where
[39:53.280 --> 39:58.280]  people on TV local television stations going no no we don't want the big
[39:58.280 --> 40:02.440]  banks in their communism they now get it big rich people want communism to
[40:02.440 --> 40:07.400]  control you because they're offshore and exempt and once people get that no to
[40:07.400 --> 40:13.640]  no to Obama we want cars we want air conditioning plus you let folks have
[40:13.640 --> 40:17.320]  cars and air conditioning you clean up the technology which has happened people
[40:17.320 --> 40:22.800]  have two kids on average they don't have 14 children and we all sell off in the
[40:22.800 --> 40:27.240]  sunset together instead of destroying the planet it's so amazing to be alive
[40:27.240 --> 40:34.920]  right now ladies and gentlemen and I look at the tax cut plan Trump's got and the
[40:34.920 --> 40:40.240]  left attacking it saying ladies and gentlemen we have a 40% for corporate
[40:40.240 --> 40:45.560]  tax rate but he wants to give rich corporations all that money the rich
[40:45.560 --> 40:50.320]  corporations 30 years ago on record lobby to have the highest corporate
[40:50.320 --> 40:55.280]  tax in the world to make everyone go offshore because the big fortune 100
[40:55.280 --> 40:58.720]  controlled China and India and could control who could get into those markets
[40:58.720 --> 41:02.240]  so they wanted to make it cost prohibitive to operate here to knock out
[41:02.240 --> 41:08.400]  their competition China has a 15% corporate tax we've got a 40 do you
[41:08.400 --> 41:16.880]  think we can compete the communists have a 15% tax and we got a 40 because
[41:16.880 --> 41:20.120]  they're not communists they're fascist controlling slaves most of this thing is
[41:20.120 --> 41:23.880]  communism was created by the robber barons to screw everybody and they brag
[41:23.880 --> 41:30.640]  about that so we get that and we get four tax brackets or three tax brackets
[41:30.640 --> 41:34.960]  instead of 10 and they lower the highest tax rate people that actually paid that
[41:34.960 --> 41:38.720]  from 45 it's really at 45 they say it's at 40 but it's really at 45 because they
[41:38.720 --> 41:43.080]  got rid of the exemptions they lower it from 45 to 30 the economy's gonna
[41:43.080 --> 41:47.840]  explode and if you want to work you're gonna be able to get a job and save and
[41:47.840 --> 41:53.320]  get ahead that's what works and if people want it it's waiting I'm gonna go to
[41:53.320 --> 41:57.680]  break here and come back with the big Vegas news and Jimmy Carter coming out
[41:57.680 --> 42:02.800]  and supported Trump the worms turning folks Trump's got him on the run when
[42:02.800 --> 42:06.700]  you got him on the run there's not just evil of the universe the dead mean

[42:10.440 --> 42:14.000]  really evil people that's why this is happening the globalists got so evil

[48:05.280 --> 48:08.520]  let's jump right into it as we prepare to close out the sour and give you the
[48:08.520 --> 48:12.960]  inside intel on the JFK documents that are about to come out and this info
[48:12.960 --> 48:16.920]  isn't directly from the president's mouth like Friday's news was this is from
[48:16.920 --> 48:20.540]  our own deep research Roger stones the best-selling author and researcher
[48:20.540 --> 48:25.360]  New York Times best-selling author on JFK and I of course have interviewed all
[48:25.360 --> 48:30.080]  the main experts and been deeply involved in researching it and a little
[48:30.080 --> 48:35.040]  bit more than that little secret sauce in there I'll leave it at that but I did
[48:35.040 --> 48:39.920]  get the deathbed confession of eHoward Hunt with his son who now admittedly did
[48:39.920 --> 48:45.320]  run the operation and I of course have a lot of family in Dallas in Austin back
[48:45.320 --> 48:50.520]  and weren't as big of towns as they are now and knew what happened to JFK from
[48:50.520 --> 48:54.720]  the time I could understand English and boy that what I was told when I was a
[48:54.720 --> 49:00.520]  child turned out to be spot-on true and I'll leave it at that now let's go ahead
[49:00.520 --> 49:05.560]  and plow directly into the news and information on a more modern cover-up
[49:05.560 --> 49:11.360]  than just JFK that now 91% of Americans last year at the last anniversary the
[49:11.360 --> 49:21.880]  52nd anniversary or 53rd anniversary was it 53 or 54 years since 1963 we have the
[49:21.880 --> 49:28.160]  cover-up of Vegas going back on October 1st now 22 days ago it was a Sunday
[49:28.160 --> 49:33.200]  broadcast I said Antifa and BLM and any means necessary say they're getting
[49:33.200 --> 49:37.920]  ready to get violent they're getting ready to attack starting October 1st not
[49:37.920 --> 49:43.200]  November 4th November 4th the Democrats and others officially say they're
[49:43.200 --> 49:47.480]  gonna get violent the streets of America in all 50 capitals and other major
[49:47.480 --> 49:51.880]  cities we're gonna have our limited crew in places like New York Los Angeles and
[49:51.880 --> 49:55.840]  right here in Austin Texas and I've even have some great military guys that are
[49:55.840 --> 50:02.280]  still active duty that are gonna be let's just say those kind of guys are
[50:02.280 --> 50:05.360]  never on duty or off duty that are volunteering to go cover some of this
[50:05.360 --> 50:09.040]  for us as well so we're gonna have a lot of eyes and ears on this as they attempt
[50:09.040 --> 50:16.040]  to launch a second communist revolution on the 100 year anniversary of the
[50:16.040 --> 50:19.320]  Bolshevik Revolution and they admit that's their plan we'll see if it's a
[50:19.320 --> 50:23.240]  dud and fizzles looks like it may be because there's such a huge awakening
[50:23.240 --> 50:27.840]  but we shouldn't be too confident so here's the new big Vegas bombshell it's
[50:27.840 --> 50:31.480]  up on info wars.com from Intel hub.com I want to get
[50:31.480 --> 50:36.680]  Shepard Ambulus investigative journalist on he is an amazing researcher I really
[50:36.680 --> 50:39.560]  should just hire Shepard he's been wanting to get on board for years I
[50:39.560 --> 50:42.680]  haven't had the budget but we got to find a way to get this guy on board
[50:42.680 --> 50:47.920]  because he just keeps being at the center of so many big stories. Vegas bombshell
[50:47.920 --> 50:54.360]  video shows 17 ambulances pulling bodies out of hooters and we've blown up the
[50:54.360 --> 51:01.320]  video it's shot in HD and bigger than Dallas bigger than Vegas they are pulling
[51:01.320 --> 51:06.720]  dozens and dozens of bodies out and there's a time-lapse video there's an
[51:06.720 --> 51:12.080]  unedited video that's like 45 minutes long up on info wars.com there's a
[51:12.080 --> 51:17.880]  condensed video that was put together by high-impact flicks that does a great
[51:17.880 --> 51:22.240]  job of the youtuber Benjamin Franks who we're gonna get on as a witness this
[51:22.240 --> 51:26.000]  week if we can who put up the whole video he just shot this out of his hotel
[51:26.000 --> 51:32.280]  window out of the MGM about 200 yards away and they're not triaging and
[51:32.280 --> 51:36.160]  directing bodies over you've got big exits hundreds of yards away from the
[51:36.160 --> 51:40.420]  venue and you see police taking bodies out of there there it looks like the
[51:40.420 --> 51:46.480]  hooters are shot up and you've got not just man to lay but you've got other
[51:46.480 --> 51:50.440]  places on the Vegas strip that are upwards of a mile away reporting shots
[51:50.440 --> 51:54.040]  fired and broken glass and bullets on the ground and we've already covered all
[51:54.040 --> 52:01.480]  that we've already shot in-depth reports on it we had federal law enforcement
[52:01.480 --> 52:07.780]  tell us the morning after that Alex it's Antifa slash ISIS paraphernalia he was
[52:07.780 --> 52:11.600]  traveling the Middle East with his girlfriend all this is going on there's
[52:11.600 --> 52:15.640]  a cover up there's more than one shooter and then notice all that came out they
[52:15.640 --> 52:19.560]  changed the timeline and it turned out he shot earlier down the hall like we
[52:19.560 --> 52:22.400]  said and there were witnesses saying you better get out of here you're gonna die
[52:22.400 --> 52:25.720]  in 45 minutes we don't know exactly what happened and neither do our law
[52:25.720 --> 52:29.120]  enforcement sources it's so compartmentalized but there were other
[52:29.120 --> 52:35.440]  shooters who were shot ladies and gentlemen and again we've already broken
[52:35.440 --> 52:39.760]  all that down and there were reports of people being shooting from the directions
[52:39.760 --> 52:42.960]  of hooters and there may have been somebody in there shooting people who
[52:42.960 --> 52:47.280]  got killed by cops we know police at multiple locations people saw them shoot
[52:47.280 --> 52:51.360]  masked men and broken glass and shell cases and we've already had the
[52:51.360 --> 52:57.000]  witnesses on we've reported it I mean the videos are legion so all I know is
[52:57.000 --> 53:02.560]  we're being lied to and we know the FBI got hundreds of cell phones in fact tried
[53:02.560 --> 53:05.680]  to confiscate them from everybody that exited hundreds and hundreds of cell
[53:05.680 --> 53:09.800]  phones and are asking other people not to upload it we've had witnesses that
[53:09.800 --> 53:14.920]  we're going to organize groups to go public dropping dead so I'm not saying
[53:14.920 --> 53:18.960]  the FBI itself sped but the guy running the Vegas operation I've had high level
[53:18.960 --> 53:24.400]  cell team 6 high level federal marshals high level FBI say that guy is a
[53:24.400 --> 53:30.760]  Clinton slash Obama operative and now it's come out so he's to be right under
[53:30.760 --> 53:36.200]  Phil mud at the FBI who says they're gonna kill the president so dangerous
[53:36.200 --> 53:40.400]  hombres I'll tell you right now and and I've been told that the guy running
[53:40.400 --> 53:47.040]  Vegas is mr. Scourge or whatever scour is is what's his name I'm teleprompter
[53:47.040 --> 53:52.320]  free roose roose is roose yes that that that that he is just the worst there is
[53:52.320 --> 53:55.920]  I don't have any knowledge of that I've been told that and I see his pedigree his
[53:55.920 --> 54:01.160]  pedigree is like directly from the loins of Lucifer politically from the
[54:01.160 --> 54:05.120]  Clinton's and Obama and Mueller who's running scared now now caught us the
[54:05.120 --> 54:10.760]  backman with uranium on the tarmac to the FSB former KGB I mean no wonder they
[54:10.760 --> 54:13.720]  were running around like chickens with their heads cut off saying I'm a Russian
[54:13.720 --> 54:17.160]  Rand Paul's a Russian and Tucker Carlson if he didn't believe the fake stuff
[54:17.160 --> 54:20.440]  you're a Russian remember Tucker Carlson you're one you're one and others like
[54:20.440 --> 54:27.360]  you're crazy but that's what they do so here's the report a boil down again if
[54:27.360 --> 54:31.720]  it's radio you've got to go watch it at info wars.com forward slash show we're
[54:31.720 --> 54:35.360]  streaming live right now or it's in the article Vegas bombshell but let's go
[54:35.360 --> 54:39.640]  ahead and roll this report it's powerful every piece of information we get is
[54:39.640 --> 54:43.280]  just one more piece of the puzzle and that brings me to a video that was just
[54:43.280 --> 54:48.240]  uploaded to YouTube by Benjamin Branks. His video is taken from the perspective
[54:48.240 --> 54:53.440]  of the MGM Grand Hotel across the street from Hooters. Benjamin is facing south
[54:53.440 --> 54:58.320]  with the concert event area in Mandalay Bay to his southwest. According to the
[54:58.320 --> 55:03.160]  video at the 27 second mark Benjamin says they're pulling bodies out of Hooters.
[55:03.160 --> 55:07.760]  They're just pulling so many bodies out of that Hooters I don't know if people are dead
[55:07.760 --> 55:11.720]  I don't know if they're just injured. At first there were six ambulances that
[55:11.720 --> 55:15.320]  could be seen parked in front of Hooters by the time you get to the five minute
[55:15.320 --> 55:20.880]  mark you can count 16 ambulances parked in a line with more speeding by. Now I've
[55:20.880 --> 55:24.040]  compressed some of the time of this video here to give you a partial time
[55:24.040 --> 55:29.160]  lapse of the activity below. This is the MGM Grand from around their perspective
[55:29.160 --> 55:34.480]  here's Hooters and way over here is the event area with Mandalay Bay even
[55:34.480 --> 55:39.240]  further to the southwest. Now I understand that police had certain areas blocked
[55:39.240 --> 55:43.520]  off but why in the hell were they parked in front of Hooters this far away and
[55:43.520 --> 55:48.180]  why were bodies being taken from inside Hooters? Why do we not see people
[55:48.180 --> 55:52.200]  flooding this parking lot right here traveling north from the venue or
[55:52.200 --> 55:57.000]  emergency personnel running south of this parking lot to the concert grounds to
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.800]  take care of the injured? Benjamin Franks deserves credit for filming this and
[56:00.800 --> 56:05.440]  may not have been his intention. By the way, when I said a couple of yards I
[56:05.440 --> 56:13.520]  meant just across the street from one point Hooters is 0.8 miles or 1.1
[56:13.520 --> 56:17.760]  kilometers away from Mandalay. I mean folks you've got ambulances going and
[56:17.760 --> 56:20.760]  you could and he's blowing up there's bodies being brought out on stretchers
[56:20.760 --> 56:25.720]  to show like what looks like 15 or more ambulances let's just continue.
[56:25.720 --> 56:29.760]  To take care of the injured. Benjamin Franks deserves credit for filming this
[56:29.760 --> 56:34.400]  and may not have been his intention but this is what independent journalism is
[56:34.400 --> 56:39.880]  all about. Let the camera roll and record history as it happens no filter no
[56:39.880 --> 56:46.600]  edits. And again the original report from High Impact Flicks is longer and
[56:46.600 --> 56:49.280]  then of course there's Benjamin Franks original footage everybody go see this
[56:49.280 --> 56:53.400]  for yourself and hats off to both High Impact Flicks and Benjamin Franks
[56:53.400 --> 56:59.120]  because that's real journalism and there are thousands of these videos now
[56:59.120 --> 57:04.440]  starting to get uploaded. We are just inundated the crew is I'm not complaining
[57:04.440 --> 57:08.720]  but we're doing 10 hours a day of live radio and TV now and then we've got the
[57:08.720 --> 57:13.040]  major news sites and the research and so I've got just two or three people that
[57:13.040 --> 57:19.360]  are sitting there trying to watch all this and it's just unbelievable. I mean
[57:19.360 --> 57:23.400]  it is totally clear this was an ISIS terror attack working with a leftist
[57:23.400 --> 57:29.640]  anti-fub connected into Kurdish groups and communist groups in the Middle East
[57:29.640 --> 57:35.080]  as best we can tell and they they told the president sir it's a trigger to
[57:35.080 --> 57:39.040]  launch a major Islamic attack on the US so please don't say it's Islamic that's
[57:39.040 --> 57:43.000]  the trigger so that's why Trump has allowed them to basically cover this up
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.760]  and I think that's a miscalculation and a mistake but there you go it just
[57:46.760 --> 57:50.760]  validates everything Trump's actually been talking about. I am very proud to
[57:50.760 --> 57:55.880]  announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars biome defense

[59:57.360 --> 01:00:09.600]  Coming up ladies and gentlemen Roger Stone after breaking exclusive news that
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:14.280]  the president was going to declassify the JFK files next week. Well we're going to
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:19.040]  give you the rest of the story and a lot more coming up after this next break
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:23.240]  than Jimmy Carter's come out in support of the president now against the
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.080]  Clintons and others. I mean the worm is turning. We have the globalist on the run
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.080]  but we have to be moral now. We have to deliver. We have to really stay the
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:35.200]  course. But populism is here. Globalism is in deep crap. Let's go to this
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.520]  special report Bush and Obama tag team Trump. They make a great team for
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.480]  globalism don't they? Is it all hands on deck for the minions of the elites,
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:50.200]  puppets George W. Bush and Barack Obama? Has populism and awareness become too
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:55.440]  large a threat to ignore? Obama desperate to sway voters attempted to sell
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.480]  pseudo-populism to the Democrats after bludgeoning the country for eight years
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:06.600]  with orders from Bilderberg in the United Nations. And so the question now at a
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:14.520]  time when our politics just seems so divided and so angry and so nasty when
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:19.480]  everybody pushes in the same direction that's when good things happen. And we
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:24.160]  live at a time when all sorts of forces conspire to turn good people off from
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:31.560]  politics. The way we get our news, the way money floods into our campaigns, the way
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:36.120]  our political districts are drawn so that candidates are rewarded for
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:42.480]  pandering for the extremes instead of trying to keep common ground. Instead of
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:48.320]  looking for ways to work together and get things done in a practical way, we
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:54.920]  got folks who are deliberately trained in that fake folksy talk. No, I'm trained
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:02.760]  by resistance and I'm gonna break you. To get the base all riled up because it
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:07.000]  provides a short-term tactical advantage that if we're gonna talk about our
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:14.640]  history then we should do it in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds, not
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:20.040]  in a way that divides. We shouldn't use the most painful parts of our history just
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:27.720]  to score political points. We saw what happened in Charlottesville. While George
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:32.880]  W. Bush blamed the will of the American people, labeling the newfound surge of
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:38.000]  economic prosperity and nationalism racist. There's an aggressive challenge by
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.400]  Russia and China to the norms and rules of global order. They propose revisions
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.840]  that always seem to involve less respect for the rights of free nations and
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:54.480]  less freedom for the individual. These matters would be difficult under any
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:59.400]  circumstances. They are further complicated by a trend in Western countries
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:05.400]  away from global engagement and democratic confidence. Parts of Europe have
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:12.640]  developed an identity crisis. We have seen insolvency, economic stagnation, youth
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:17.560]  unemployment, anger about immigration, resurgent ethno-nationalism, and deep
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:22.720]  questions about the meaning and durability of the European Union. America is
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.440]  not immune from these trends. In recent decades public confidence in our
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:34.720]  institutions has declined. Our governing class has often been paralyzed in the
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:40.120]  face of obvious and pressing needs. The American dream of upward mobility seems
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:45.400]  out of reach for some who feel left behind in a changing economy. Discontent
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:52.800]  deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.440]  politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:03.280]  fabrication. Crawl back into your New World Order holes. America knows who you
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.600]  really are. Whatever you're selling, we're not buying.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:12.080]  He's supposed to be embarrassed. Speech writer wrote an I 14
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.960]  speech. It's clear he didn't understand anything he was talking about. He
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:23.040]  equates the industrial revolution, the agricultural revolution, globalization.
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.900]  He has no idea what he's coming or going. Just like it was when he was President
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.040]  of the United States. There has not been a more destructive presidency than
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:36.900]  George Bush's. The rise of China started with the clings in Bush. When they had
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:41.380]  to the to the World Trade Organization and give them most favorite nations that
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:45.220]  they're gonna become a liberal democracy as they get there okay and they're gonna
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:50.940]  become more free market capitalists this is not a small mistake this is a
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:56.340]  strategic mistake of incalculable problems John Bowen reporting for
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:02.460]  info wars.com the left is proposing new Orwellian efforts to combat fake news a
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:06.860]  proposal called fool me once the case for government regulation of fake news
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:10.900]  hopes to squash the spread of information on social media platforms by
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:15.060]  threatening libel suits to anyone who thinks of sharing or retweeting some
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:18.100]  wrong think now there's no solid definition of what's considered
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:21.980]  disinformation other than what the left says but radical Democrats would like
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:26.500]  to see regulation in the form of pop-ups that would remind a user of libel laws
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:31.180]  before they decide to share an article in dispute sites like info wars and the
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:34.900]  drudge report would immediately be targeted discouraging users from
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:39.980]  sharing articles ironically George W. Bush re-emerged this week to insult the
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:43.940]  American people for their obsession with conspiracy theories this coming from
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:47.780]  the man who peddled the most devastating conspiracy theory of the modern era the
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:51.020]  weapons of mass destruction lie that was dutifully spread by the deep state
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:55.260]  intelligence agencies and the mainstream media as the indisputable truth
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:06:09.100]  leon macadoo for info wars dot com you got a business that you didn't build that
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:13.580]  somebody else made that happen
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:27.580]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:36.860]  so we have hundreds of major newspapers every major local TV station the big
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:45.900]  four networks constantly saying info wars info wars dot com is fake news and
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:50.580]  they say that because they're the fake news and every day and every week and
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:54.420]  every month and every year we prove over and over again that you learn what's
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:07:04.180]  gonna happen here days weeks months years or decades before but most of time
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:09.820]  it's because I've read the congressional hearing on the JFK assassination that
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:15.020]  was bigger and more in-depth than the Warren Commission and it said multiple
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:20.500]  shooters probably the CIA so I sound really smart 53 years later when it's
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:26.020]  all coming out or Roger Stone has been friends for 43 44 years with President
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:31.020]  Trump the former head of his two campaigns talks to him and president
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:34.100]  sounded like he was gonna release it barring new info that's what Roger said
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:38.780]  Friday the media ran all these headlines saying ha look Roger Stone Alex
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:43.740]  Jones say this but our sources say it's not gonna be released yeah Pompeo I'm
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:47.020]  not against Pompeo but you know that she's pressuring him Trump tweets on
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:50.780]  Saturday morning no barring new info I'm gonna release it so they just can't
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:54.980]  stand the fact that we don't just have the sources because we're honorable but
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:58.620]  we're pro-america and we're winning we just saw the new Czech billionaire
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:02.940]  model after Trump a populist win by a huge margin we just saw a patriot model
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:07.900]  at the Trump win in Austria we see it in Australia we see Catalonia trying to
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:12.660]  break away in a Trump type movement we see Raikiawek Iceland we see Brazil
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:16.900]  moving in that direction we see Briggs it we see it everywhere people don't want
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:23.260]  to be under a big private corporate New World Order then you have Fred Rico
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.420]  Wilson coming out lying about the president getting caught lying she
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.060]  wasn't on the phone call he didn't say the things she said he said wearing her
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:34.980]  big fake cowboy hat like Pocahontas over there Elizabeth Warren saying she's an
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:39.380]  Indian they're playing cowboys and Indians she's falling on her face saying
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:45.780]  general Kelly is a racist as he called her stupid I'll call you evil you're
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:51.620]  like a clown witch so all of this is happening but anti-fuzz planning the
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:54.580]  terror attacks and remember forth who knows what's coming we're in the fight
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:58.820]  we're starting to win but it's like we lost the first six rounds now at round
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:02.660]  10 we're winning and winning handily there's two rounds left baby and
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:07.060]  heavyweight championship for the whole world's future Roger Stone joins us it
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:12.500]  isn't about a victory lap but man we're right man we're on target man we are just
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:19.060]  dead on and they can't stand it can they Roger no Alex they really can't first
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:23.620]  of all let me say I'm extraordinarily proud of our president Donald Trump
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:28.500]  because I know that the deep state and the intelligence agencies tried to
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:34.980]  pressure him not to release these documents after 50 years when you have
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:41.940]  Gerald Posner the the New York Times best-selling author and and a supporter
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:47.260]  of the Warren Commission in his book team with Roger Stone who wrote the man who
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:52.140]  killed Kennedy the case against LBJ and we both call for transparency the
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:57.140]  president absolutely did the right thing the danger now Alex is not allowing
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:04.540]  the deep state to redact and hold back so much material in these 3100 files that
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:10.140]  they become useless a kind of a backdoor nullification of the president's
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:16.180]  courageous decision using the phony claim of national security to cover that
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:19.500]  was my next question is what do you think is going to be released because we we
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.940]  know from the Congressional Commission and our deep research what's in the
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:26.860]  files a lot of its leaked so we should a get to that next but but but let's do be
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:31.340]  first the big fear is Obama said we're going to release the 9-11 files but they
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:37.620]  were all blacked out yeah look we know from the very last data release of
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:43.260]  these materials that we have a J. Edgar Hoover the FBI director telling Lyndon
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:47.740]  Baines Johnson the president that the KGB has conducted their own independent
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:52.580]  investigation and determined that LBJ was the ringleader in John Kennedy's
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:56.860]  murder we have documentation from the previous dump that French intelligence
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:11:01.700]  told Jacqueline Kennedy that they concluded Lyndon Johnson was culpable
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:07.540]  we have Bobby Baker right-hand manned to Lyndon Johnson saying to one of John
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:12.460]  Kennedy's top aides John Kennedy will not live out his term and he will die a
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:18.820]  violent death this is at the 1961 inauguration so there's no telling what
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:24.620]  the next a tranche could be I expect that we will find additional ties to
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:31.820]  Lyndon Johnson and the CIA is and their long-term ties to Oswald which they've
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:39.740]  been pretty adept at covering up may finally come to light to be clear you
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.860]  talked to the president he said look barring new info I'm probably gonna do
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:46.100]  it you you only on air said he's leaning towards I think I'll do the right
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:50.100]  thing it's supposed to come out next Friday do you think Pompeo or others
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:54.060]  can get to him and stop him or will they go the in run and say okay sir we will
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:59.300]  but but again completely black it out look there's no chance that he's going
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:02.860]  to reverse himself on this and the public reaction to it I think has been
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:09.020]  quite positive no I think that they may seek the backdoor in July there was a
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:13.900]  more limited dump of material Alex and far too much of it was redacted and
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:19.100]  held back I will be the first to go public if this is an attempt by the
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:23.260]  deep state to counter man what the president has ordered hoping that he
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:27.860]  doesn't notice the president's committed to transparency and there's so many
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:32.260]  things that we'd like to know I'd like to see if there's any further evidence of
[01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:38.500]  Ted Cruz's father's involvement with Oswald we know that Judith very Baker who
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:44.940]  is who is definitely connected to Oswald in the Warren Commission report has said
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:51.380]  publicly that she knew Angel Cruz as part of Lee's crew in New Orleans so
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:55.220]  there's a lot of things here that could be extraordinarily interested regarding
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:59.340]  this upcoming dump sure let's stop right there obviously since you were the head
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:02.380]  of the campaign and the media made some about you in the fake russia gate thing
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.660]  has now collapsed you know it was the Clintons doing it so they tried to blame
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:10.340]  the people exposing it like yourself Julian Assange and others myself just
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:14.500]  totally asinine Anderson Cooper they said I mean Anderson Cooper attacked
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:19.100]  people saying they must be you know agents of Russia they blame Tucker
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:23.500]  Carlson said he you know he may be one clearly they're the ones involved is why
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.820]  they're scared but now maybe in hindsight you can get into some of the
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:30.500]  other conversations with the president because I remember during the campaign we
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:35.340]  talked on air and privately saying look it looks like Ted Cruz's dad you know
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:40.860]  was involved was CIA we know it looks like him we know he was there we think
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:45.780]  if we bring this out Cruz will drop out Trump did it after you and others talk
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:49.980]  to him it came out and then his dad dropped out two days later I mean you
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:54.100]  talk about you talk about running for the hills I mean you want to talk about
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:57.960]  that conversation now I think it's newsworthy well look I would say this
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:02.460]  Donald Trump is his own man no I know that but you gave me intel just say it
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:08.140]  that said Alex he loves nothing better than giving the needle to his opponents
[01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:13.620]  the way he did little Marco Rubio the way he did that lie in Ted Cruz so he
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:19.340]  saw the opportunity to needle Ted Cruz about a photograph that comes from the
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:26.100]  Warren Commission report that certainly looks like Angel Raphael and his father
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:29.180]  lives there and his father had the connections and our sources say it was
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:34.580]  him that we have a witness who says it was here Judith very Baker so so the
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:40.060]  president never misses an opportunity to needle his opponent he dropped out right
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:44.700]  after it came out yeah no it was devastating it was meant to drive Ted
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:49.020]  Cruz crazy and if you saw the videos that day he was drooling he was arguing
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:52.700]  I just say you never take credit for the stuff that I'm even halfway involved
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:58.220]  and I'm very proud of well you know look I think it's all covered in my book the
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:04.940]  making of the president 2016 and the role of info wars the role of the
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:11.060]  alt-right media it's all there I commend it to you well amazing and again all
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:14.660]  right Hillary turn much fun but I mean we really are the new right aren't we
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:18.540]  well we are the other thing I want to point out because this is important
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:23.660]  historically Alex you were the one who covered the E Howard Hunt deathbed
[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:29.580]  confessions in which Hunt said that this was a CIA operation that he was on the
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:33.100]  ground hold on let's start over there one more segment with the Rogers down
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:37.000]  then I get into general Kelly we both been critical of but now seeing him
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.020]  saying he's shown his true colors he thinks abortion is wrong he loves God
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:45.180]  he thinks women are sacrosanct and he thinks putting down dead trips families
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:49.140]  is wrong oh he doesn't hate America we thought you hated America Kelly what's
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:52.880]  your problem so we'll talk about all that and more straight ahead but Trump is
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:58.020]  hitting his stride and we are all winning you're gonna get sick of winning

[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:52.980]  happening people and you're seeing it in 2017 Roger you got the floor get into
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:57.540]  eHoward Hunt the history the real facts the fact that this is solved and and
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:01.660]  whether they black it all out or not this is just round one people ask why
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:05.820]  wouldn't they shred it all because they keep this stuff for blackmail explain
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:11.100]  that to folks well you're exactly right Alex our friend George Norrie and you
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:16.940]  first exposed the deathbed confessions of eHoward Hunt the legendary CIA
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:21.820]  operative Bay of Pigs veteran later arrested as one of the Watergate
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:27.820]  burglars among the classified material that is now scheduled Pete to be
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:34.060]  released are eHoward Hunt's diaries these diaries were seized by the agency and
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:39.780]  Hunt had fought through his lawyers for their return unsuccessfully his son
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:45.420]  st. John Hunt joins me tomorrow night on the war room at five o'clock Eastern he
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:51.300]  tells me these diaries are incendiary because they confirm everything
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:59.260]  that you first reported that the CIA was on the ground in in Dallas on November
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:05.380]  22nd 1963 that general Lansdale of the CIA was on the ground in Dealey Plaza
[01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:12.300]  that it was a CIA operation but that vice president Lyndon Baines Johnson was
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:17.540]  to use Howard Hunt's words running the show that's right and Hunt was a quote
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:24.540]  armchair quarterback about a benchwarmer basically it was his words in
[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:29.020]  in charge but he was the second phase down the road of it failed they were
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:32.540]  ready with bazookas hand grenades you name it I mean they were gonna kill
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:39.500]  Kennedy well and look the House assassinations committee in 1978 concluded
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:43.900]  that organized crime had a role in Kennedy's death this is this is a
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:48.860]  repudiation of the Warren Commission that tells us that Jack Ruby had no known
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:54.060]  associations with organized crime that's a nice laugh well you know going back to
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:57.900]  World War two they use La Cosa Nostra and all those groups in Sicily and Italy
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:03.460]  to help with the pre-invasion well we we also know that once the central
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:07.660]  intelligence agency and their assets were thrown out of Cuba we had to rely
[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:12.940]  on the still mob owned casinos in that country for intelligence on what Castro
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:17.780]  was doing we also know the mob in the central intelligence agency in a secret
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:23.180]  operation organized by vice president Richard Nixon green-lighted by Dwight
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:30.100]  Eisenhower sought to assassinate Fidel Castro that was Operation Mungus
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:36.380]  absolute absolutely so we are really interested about these documents because
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:43.060]  the hunt diaries I think will be explosive and news I'm ready to finance I'm
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:46.060]  ready to get on the plane right now and fly out and meet hunt I did it years
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:49.820]  before to get the exclusive deathbed confession and so I'm ready to get hunt
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:53.100]  on air as soon as you because now now's the season I told everybody listen
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:55.940]  everybody knows they killed Kennedy they're tired of hearing about it but
[01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:59.940]  when the documents come out they care again a huge victory lap for justice in
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:04.620]  history now is the time I just hope that again these documents get released on
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:09.180]  Friday well and then they haven't redacted them to death let's be clear
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:13.620]  about what we're expecting there is the cycle analysis the psychological
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:19.860]  profile done by Oswald on Oswald by the CIA there is the classified testimony of
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:24.060]  both CIA and FBI officials to the Congress that was not released at that
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:29.260]  time there is the transcript of the interrogation of Yuri Nisenko who was
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:34.900]  thought by some to be Oswald's handler there are documents pertaining that was
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:40.460]  the local white Russian right correct there's documents pertaining to Oswald's
[01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:46.860]  mysterious appearance in Mexico City we have Lyndon Baines Johnson on the phone
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:51.220]  with J.R. Hoover when Hoover says Mr. President the man in Mexico doesn't look
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:56.380]  like Oswald time for an answer as to what he meant by that what it means of
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:00.420]  course is that the security camera footage seems to be missing we're almost out
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:04.420]  of time we'll put it back on then we have the Jagger Hoover memo saying
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:09.660]  George Herbert Walker Bush of the CIA in Texas on JFK you know I want to contact
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:12.620]  him and we have these documents that have come out we're gonna put them on
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:16.300]  screen for TV viewers let me ask you this why is everything coming out now
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:22.660]  why is populism winning everywhere what is going on I mean it's spectacular why
[01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:27.460]  I didn't know we start tickin their butts this fast Roger this is amazing well
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:31.500]  because we have an anti-establishment president who knows his own mind who's
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:35.940]  a gut populist and who understands that the American people are tired of the
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:41.380]  lies of the two-party duopoly the neocon globalists who have run this country in
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:45.380]  and they say he's mentally ill because he wants America to be first it isn't
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:50.220]  out to get us I mean I read this but I don't like is the way the Washington
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:55.420]  Post and the New York Times referred to both you and I last week as conspiracy
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:59.700]  theorists let's address this first of all we have a memo written in 1964 by the
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:04.060]  Central Intelligence Agency instructing their media assets anytime anyone
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:07.460]  disagrees with the government's conclusions regarding the Kennedy
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:12.380]  assassination call them a conspiracy theorist it's an attempt to discredit us
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:16.740]  and they still do it today they still follow the old order today do you want
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:20.900]  but let's talk about some real conspiracy theories like the Russians
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:25.660]  help Donald Trump get elected there's a conspiracy theory or Lee Harvey Oswald
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:29.900]  was alone not communist who acted alone there's a conspiracy there's WMDs in
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:34.300]  Iraq and and and you know Niger uranium and anthrax let me ask this to close
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:38.900]  we'll have one minute left go ahead George W. Bush is our largest conspiracy theory
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:43.500]  president he told us they had yellow cake uranium and that they had weapons of
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:48.860]  mass destruction he lied us into war on the basis of a conspiracy theory very
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:54.540]  sad pathetic exactly and now it's just a bottom you look at that photo of Lady
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:58.780]  Gaga on the old president's enclosing 30 seconds what do you make of it's in the
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:02.900]  New York Post Jimmy Carter came out against the Clintons came out against
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:07.700]  Obama and said they're all full of it the Americans want populism and that
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:11.540]  Trump was elected by Americans and Russia wasn't involved Jimmy Carter just
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:16.060]  turned against him what's going on Jimmy Carter like Ronald Reagan was an
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:20.900]  outsider he was controlled by the deep state but he was never one of them and
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:25.500]  unlike the rest of them he never profiteered personally he never lined
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:29.660]  his own pockets he never became a rich man door did his crawly might have made
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:35.100]  mistakes but he's not a bad guy he was honest he never stole a dime unlike the
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:41.380]  bush so do you think he sees Trump in his in himself being a maverick he was
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:45.740]  a Christian he was an honest man he just had a misguided political philosophy
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:51.100]  but he was not evil he was controlled by and now he stands with Trump it's a
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:55.060]  big choice thank you Roger incredible we'll be back with key intel thank you

[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:44.020]  liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long
[01:31:44.020 --> 01:32:00.340]  the silent majority is no longer silent this is the war room thousands of
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:04.900]  years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the
[01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:10.020]  drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a
[01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:15.900]  defense sixty years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with
[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:21.300]  bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:26.260]  there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:31.260]  into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:36.220]  accelerate our journey towards death I personally counter this onslaught with

[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:34.340]  one of the most important things we do here at info wars is break down the
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:40.460]  viewers and listeners how the mass media manipulates how they deceive we take you
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:45.700]  behind the scenes and basically show you the hat trick that the magician is
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:51.500]  using so that we can basically alert the public so they're aware of the scams so
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:55.900]  the fake news media cannot continue to get away with it over and over and over
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:34:01.580]  again and a great example of this was just last week a wonderful though sad
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:07.420]  opportunity to expose what they're up to we saw president trump making phone
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:16.180]  calls to the wives and to the widows and family members of soldiers and others
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:19.820]  that recently died in the armed services of this country and service this
[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:25.700]  nation and a congresswoman friend rica wilson reportedly listened in to one
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:29.580]  of the phone calls of one of her constituents and then misrepresented
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:34.220]  what trump had done so that he was very cavalier that he was very flippant well
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:39.220]  he asked for it so this is what he got then of course gold star families
[01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:43.460]  released phone calls that were similar to what this phone call had been like it
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:49.180]  was actually very very gracious the way he said it and it was general kelly who
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:55.180]  lost his own son a few years ago in the marines who basically told the president
[01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:59.420]  how best he thought it would be for the president to basically do it but he went
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:02.940]  further and said mr. president most presidents don't actually call people
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:06.400]  and this is really tough for you to do and I recommend you don't do it but
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:10.260]  trump went ahead and did it so this is bigger than trump this is about the
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:16.700]  anatomy of deception because now this congresswoman has come out and said that
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:21.420]  she's a rock star now that this happened and is really really proud of all the
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:26.740]  fawning attention that fake news media like MSNBC and CNN and ABC have given
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:30.940]  her a total disconnect she doesn't get most american state mainstream media she
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:34.380]  doesn't get that her butts hanging out there in front of the world people see
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:40.180]  right through her and that she took this death of this soldier and then used
[01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:45.220]  it to project hatred upon the president now the rest of the story I'm going to
[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:49.740]  play part of the press conference that Kelly gave is that in their attempt to
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:55.940]  demonize and lie they've now expanded it on to general Kelly and said oh my gosh
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:36:00.700]  you know he is this terrible person he's shown his true colors is what CNN
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:05.660]  said he's shown us he's really a make America great again guy and with horror
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:10.740]  in these articles and in and then these reports they talk about what a terrible
[01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:16.460]  person he is because he believes we shouldn't use the deaths of soldiers to
[01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:20.540]  make political points or he believes that religion should be honored or that
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:24.100]  women should be honored or that children should be honored or you know the
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:28.660]  institution of manhood you name it that humanity should be honored that the
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:33.340]  right to life should be honored he talked about honoring humanity having
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:39.900]  respect for ourselves and it's CNN and others that showed us their true colors
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:44.980]  when they flipped out and acted like the wholesome things that general Kelly
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:50.140]  said were some type of horrible pornography or something of scene
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:55.220]  something obscene that was being said and done it's really the Washington Post
[01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:59.540]  and CNN and mainstream corporate dinosaur media that are showing us
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:06.660]  their true colors when they flip out over someone saying let's not be political
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:11.020]  in America when it comes to deaths of soldiers let's not insert ourselves
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:15.700]  between grieving families and the president let's have something that's
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:21.660]  still sacrosanct and honored in this country and as if not to be undone after
[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:31.220]  all of her rock star bandwagon you know really vampire like behavior the psychic
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:37.860]  vampire congresswoman Frederica Wilson comes back again now this weekend and
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:47.020]  says that the general was racist when he said that the loudest guns tend to be
[01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:51.940]  empty barrels that's just saying that she's a loudmouth that's just saying she
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:56.540]  jumps on bandwagons and that she's an idiot but again because she can't
[01:37:56.540 --> 01:38:00.820]  intellectually defeat what he said and what he's done and because she's been
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:05.460]  caught lying about the tenor of what President Trump really does in these
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:09.780]  heartfelt phone calls she's got to go back to the only card that the liberal
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:15.260]  democratic globalist party has and that's race baiting and to see folks like
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:19.820]  this lady falling on her face is just absolutely disgusting you know there's a
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:24.180]  congressman up in Georgia that must be black who believes that islands float and
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:28.180]  when the media pointed out that islands don't float their mountaintop sticking
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:33.140]  out of water some folks said well you're just racist no Nancy Pelosi's just as
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:37.380]  senile and mentally ill as these folks as well and she's white and there's some
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:40.540]  other members of Congress that are also out of their minds we've just got to be
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:45.380]  asking ourselves how have we gotten a collection of weirdos like this in
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:50.300]  charge of our country so I'm gonna air the first ten minutes or so of general
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:55.380]  Kelly's breakdown and then for yourself go to info wars.com watch some posts you
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:59.540]  name it and actually see similar phone calls that gold star families have taped
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:04.820]  where you see how gracious and loving the president is when he's saying hey he
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:09.060]  was with he wanted to be with he was a leader he gave his life for us what a
[01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:14.860]  hero versus yeah he asked Florida to its to shut your mouth that's how the fake
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:18.980]  news media distorts things and in the new media system where everybody's got a
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:22.620]  camera and everybody can expose what they're doing they are extincting
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:26.300]  themselves it's not info wars destroying mainstream media they're doing it to
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:30.700]  themselves most Americans don't know what happens when we lose one of our
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:35.980]  soldiers sailors and Marines or Coast Guardsmen in combat so let me tell you
[01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:42.100]  what happens their buddies wrap them up and whatever passes as a shroud puts
[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:48.300]  them on a helicopter as a routine and sends them home their first stop along
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:55.380]  the way is when they're packed in ice typically at the at the earhead and then
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:40:01.820]  they're flown to use a Europe where they're then packed in ice again and
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:09.740]  flown to Dover Air Force Base where Dover takes care of the remains and bombs
[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:15.940]  them meticulously dresses them in their uniform with the rebel with the metals
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:20.860]  that they've earned the emblems of their service and then puts them on another
[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:26.260]  airplane linked up with a casualty officer escort that takes them home a
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:30.940]  very very good movie to watch if you haven't ever seen it is taking chance
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:37.180]  where this is done in a movie HBO setting Chance Phelps was killed under my
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:41.340]  command right next to me it's worth seeing that if you've never seen it so
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:48.380]  that's the process well that's happening a casualty officer typically goes to the
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:53.500]  home very early in the morning and waits for the first lights to come on and
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:59.140]  then he knocks on the door typically the mom and dad will answer wife and if
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:02.100]  there is a wife this is happening in two different places if the parents are
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:10.060]  divorced three different places and the casualty officer proceeds to break
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:17.660]  the heart of a family member and stays with that family until well for a long
[01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:22.220]  long time even after the internment so that's what happens who are these young
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:27.020]  men and women they are the best one percent this country produces most of
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:34.180]  you as Americans don't know them many of you don't know anyone who knows any and
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:38.140]  one of them but they are the very best this country produces and they
[01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:42.420]  volunteer to protect our country when there's nothing in our country anymore
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:49.700]  that seems to suggest that self-service to the nation is not only appropriate but
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:57.580]  required but that's all right who writes letters to the families typically the
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:00.500]  company commander in my case is a marine the company commander botanic
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:04.740]  commander regimental commander division commander secretary defense typically
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:08.620]  the service chief common on the Marine Corps and the president typically writes
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:12.940]  a letter typically the only phone calls the family receives are the most
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:15.980]  important phone calls they can imagine and that is from their buddies in my
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:22.060]  case hours after my son was killed his friends were calling us from Afghanistan
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:28.540]  telling us what a great guy was I was at the only phone calls that really matter
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:36.140]  and yeah the letters count to a degree but there's not much that really can
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:42.900]  take the edge off where the family members going through so some presidents
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:50.020]  have elected to call all presidents I believe have elected to send letters if
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:53.540]  you elect to call a family like this it is about the most difficult thing you

[01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:16.460]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:25.740]  there's no perfect way to make that phone call when I took this job and talk to
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:34.380]  President Trump about how to do it my first recommendation was he not do it
[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:40.140]  because it's not the phone call that parents family members are looking
[01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:45.420]  forward to it's a nice to do in my opinion in any event he asked me about
[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:50.940]  previous presidents and I said I can tell you that President Obama who was my
[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:55.660]  commander-in-chief when I was on active duty did not call my family that was not
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:59.980]  a criticism that was just to simply say I don't believe President Obama called
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:06.100]  that's not a negative thing I don't believe President Bush called in all
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:11.140]  cases I don't believe any president particularly when the casualty rates are
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:17.540]  very very high that presidents call I believe they all right so when I gave
[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:24.660]  that explanation to our president three days ago he elected to make phone calls
[01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:28.780]  in the case of the four young men who he lost in Niger at the earlier part of
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:34.860]  this month but then he said you know what how do you make these calls if you're
[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:39.900]  not in the family if you've never worn the uniform if you've never been in
[01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:45.100]  combat you can't even imagine how to make that call I think he very bravely
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:54.660]  does make those calls the call in question that he made yesterday our day
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:59.300]  before yesterday now we're to four family members the four fallen and
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:03.940]  remember there's an extra kin designated by the individual if he's married that's
[01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:08.300]  typically what the spouse if he's not married that's typically the parents
[01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:12.100]  unless the parents are divorced and they selects one of them if you didn't get
[01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:15.780]  on with his parents he'll sit you'll select a sibling but the point is the
[01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:23.860]  phone call is made to the next to Ken only if the next to Ken agrees to take
[01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:28.340]  the phone call sometimes they don't so a pre-call is made president United
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:32.060]  States or the common on the Marine Corps or someone would like to call will you
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:37.700]  accept the call and typically they all accept the call so he called four people
[01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:40.780]  the other day and expressed his condolences and the best way that he
[01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:48.620]  could and he said to me what do I say I said to him sure there's nothing you
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:53.780]  can do to lighten the burden on these families but let me tell you what I tell
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:59.860]  him what let me tell you what my best friend Joe Dunford told me because he
[01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:05.260]  was my casualty officer he said Kel
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:14.700]  he was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed he knew what he was
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:20.340]  getting into by joining them at 1% he knew what the possibilities were
[01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:27.220]  because we're at war and when he died in the four cases we're talking about in
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:31.300]  Azure my son's case in Afghanistan when he died he was surrounded by the best
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:38.260]  men on this earth his friends that's what the president tried to say to a
[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:45.220]  fact the four families the other day I was stunned when I came to work yesterday
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:52.220]  morning and broken-hearted at what I saw a member of Congress doing member
[01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:56.980]  Congress who listened in on a phone call from the president United States to a
[01:50:56.980 --> 01:51:04.060]  young wife and in his way tried to express that opinion there's a brave
[01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:09.700]  man fallen hero he knew he was getting himself into because he enlisted
[01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:15.700]  there's no reason on list he enlisted and he was where he wanted to be exactly
[01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:19.220]  where he wanted to be with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:24.860]  life was taken that was the message that was the message that was transmitted it
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:28.380]  stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that
[01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:37.140]  conversation absolutely stuns me and I thought at least that was sacred you
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:42.140]  know as a kid growing up a lot of things were sacred in our country women were
[01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:46.300]  sacred looked upon with great honor that's obviously not the case anymore as
[01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:51.580]  we see from recent cases life the dignity of life is sacred that's gone
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:57.900]  religion that seems to be gone as well goes to our families I think that left
[01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:04.380]  in the convention over the summer I just thought the selfless devotion that
[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:08.100]  brings a man or woman to die in the battlefield I just thought that that
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:14.180]  might be sacred when I listened to this woman what she was saying what she was
[01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:21.980]  doing on TV the only thing I could do to collect my thoughts was to go and walk
[01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:25.660]  among the finest men and women on this earth and you can always find them
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:29.260]  because we're not going to national cemetery went over there for an hour and
[01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:34.660]  a half walked among the stones some of whom I put there because they were doing
[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:38.220]  what I told them to do when they were killed
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:47.140]  I'll end with this in in October April rather of 2015 I still on active duty I
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:55.980]  went to the dedication of the new FBI field office in Miami and it was
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:53:01.140]  dedicated to two men were killed in a firefight in Miami with against drug
[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:10.220]  traffickers in 1986 got my name a Grogan in Duke Grogan almost retired 53
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:13.300]  years old Duke I think less than a year on the job anyways they got in a gun
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:18.540]  fight and they were killed three other FBI agents were there were wounded now
[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:24.520]  retired so we go down Jim Comey get an absolutely brilliant memorial speech to
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:29.740]  those fallen men and the and the and to all of the men and women of the FBI we
[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:34.620]  serve our country so well and law enforcement so well there were family
[01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:39.620]  members there some of the children that were there were only three or four years
[01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:46.820]  old when their dads were killed on that street in Miami-Dade three of the men
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:51.060]  that survived the fight were there and gave rendition of how brave those men
[01:53:51.060 --> 01:54:02.420]  were and how they gave their lives and a congresswoman stood up and in the long
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:07.220]  tradition of empty barrels making the most noise stood up there and all of
[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:13.180]  that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:17.580]  for that building now she took care of her constituents because she got the
[01:54:17.580 --> 01:54:21.500]  money and she just called up President Obama and on that phone call he gave
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:26.180]  the money the 20 million dollars to build a building she sat down and we
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:33.380]  were stunned stunned that she'd done it even for someone that is that empty a
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:37.820]  barrel we were stunned but you know none of us went to the press and
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:46.820]  criticized none of us stood up and were appalled we just said okay fine so I
[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:54.740]  still hope as you write your stories and I appeal to America that let's not let
[01:54:54.740 --> 01:55:00.540]  this maybe last thing that tells sacred in our in our society a young man young
[01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:05.420]  woman going out and giving his or her life for our country let's let's try
[01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:13.460]  to somehow keep that's keep that sacred but it eroded a great deal yesterday by
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:19.540]  the selfish behavior of a member of Congress as we end this special broadcast
[01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:27.540]  today I personally am just sitting back and analyzing how illustrative all of
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:32.420]  this is to exactly where our civilization and where our species is today on this
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:36.060]  planet this is one of those stories that just opens up the windows of
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:40.620]  understanding into the mindset of ourselves but also the globalist this
[01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:45.740]  lady doesn't care about using dead service members to advance her agenda
[01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:50.540]  she doesn't care about line and she loves being a quote rock star in the
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:55.300]  failed media system so it illustrates how the crumbling power structure is
[01:55:55.300 --> 01:56:00.260]  still betting on CNN and MSNBC and that's why they're losing because they're so
[01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:05.020]  delusional they're so senile they're so disconnected and it also illustrates to
[01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:10.420]  us how much disdain they have for the American people and what they really
[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:14.340]  think about us because I recently saw Bill Maher out there bitching and
[01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:18.260]  complaining and getting in his viewers faces for the fact that they don't listen
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:22.140]  to him or mainstream media but that people online actually collect their own
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:27.700]  news and their own information and come to their own decisions it's basically
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:33.980]  OCD it's it's stagnant power structure that can't stop doing things in the same
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:38.420]  way over and over again and can't see how ridiculous they look in front of
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:42.220]  everybody else that's why the whole power structure is coming down please join
