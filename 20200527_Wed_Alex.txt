[00:00.000 --> 00:18.520]  And the governor's office is also continuing to defend his early policy of requiring nursing
[00:18.520 --> 00:23.800]  homes to accept COVID positive patients to keep space free in our hospitals will report
[00:23.800 --> 00:28.400]  from the Associated Press says that the state sent more than 4,500 patients recovering from
[00:28.400 --> 00:33.240]  the disease to those nursing homes and at least 5,700 nursing home residents have died
[00:33.240 --> 00:34.240]  with the virus.
[00:34.240 --> 00:39.680]  The administration claims that it was doing what Washington told them to do a policy that
[00:39.680 --> 00:44.160]  the Department of Health put out was in line directly with the March 13th directive put
[00:44.160 --> 00:49.680]  out by CDC and CMS that read and I quote, nursing homes should admit any individuals
[00:49.680 --> 00:52.320]  from hospitals where COVID is president.
[00:52.320 --> 00:57.520]  Not could should that is President Trump's CMS and CDC.
[00:57.520 --> 00:59.840]  So I know that there's been a lot of discussion on this topic.
[00:59.840 --> 01:03.080]  There are over a dozen states that did the exact same thing.
[01:03.080 --> 01:07.400]  The governor later changed that policy to say that hospitals should not discharge patients
[01:07.400 --> 01:12.240]  to nursing homes unless those nursing homes certify that they can actually properly care
[01:12.240 --> 01:14.200]  for all of those patients.
[01:14.200 --> 01:22.520]  If you understand that one minute, 10 second clip, you understand everything about COVID-19,
[01:22.520 --> 01:30.080]  everything about the new world order, everything about how these crime networks operate.
[01:30.080 --> 01:39.160]  And so we're going to dissect that piece coming up at the start of the next segment.
[01:39.160 --> 01:40.160]  Obviously Trump has come out.
[01:40.160 --> 01:41.880]  There's a big story up at drudgerport.com.
[01:41.880 --> 01:44.120]  It's also in inforwars.com.
[01:44.120 --> 01:48.080]  Trump threatens to close down social media platforms that silence conservatives as feud
[01:48.080 --> 01:49.480]  with Twitter ramps up.
[01:49.480 --> 01:57.720]  It's not a feud, they're blocking the president telling people that mailing everyone in California
[01:57.720 --> 02:00.920]  or New York a mail-in ballot is going to be rife with fraud.
[02:00.920 --> 02:03.160]  That's on record that you don't do that.
[02:03.160 --> 02:04.320]  Nobody does that.
[02:04.320 --> 02:08.960]  But it's his free speech.
[02:08.960 --> 02:10.120]  He's allowed to say it.
[02:10.120 --> 02:15.880]  Well, now they've taken that away from the president, so he finally gets it 159 days out
[02:15.880 --> 02:20.440]  from the election that he's the target.
[02:20.440 --> 02:23.560]  And it may be too late.
[02:23.560 --> 02:24.920]  This is election meddling.
[02:24.920 --> 02:26.760]  This is fraud.
[02:26.760 --> 02:35.560]  You know, the new Black Panther Party goes out and stands in front of a polling place
[02:35.560 --> 02:37.200]  with billy clubs.
[02:37.200 --> 02:40.720]  That's a federal crime.
[02:40.720 --> 02:41.720]  And the KKK doesn't.
[02:41.720 --> 02:44.360]  It's a federal crime.
[02:44.360 --> 02:49.920]  But when big tech on the modern communication systems, that is Twitter, Facebook, Google,
[02:49.920 --> 03:02.480]  all of it, Instagram allows total real-time AI censorship, it is a criminal operation
[03:02.480 --> 03:06.600]  with media matters, with the ADL, with the Southern Probably Law Center, with the over
[03:06.600 --> 03:15.040]  100,000 trained individuals just in North America to censor and control everybody.
[03:15.040 --> 03:17.080]  And with the censorship comes the surveillance.
[03:17.080 --> 03:23.880]  Mr. President, skin the cat with the racketeering, open and shut.
[03:23.880 --> 03:28.000]  I could build this case in 30 minutes with the FBI, with their own admissions, their
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.560]  own Google statements, their own Twitter statements, and then they're lying to Congress.
[03:31.560 --> 03:33.680]  How about lying to Congress under oath?
[03:33.680 --> 03:38.000]  How about racketeering and organizing this between a big five cartel?
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.960]  How about admitting that they're being directed by the Democratic Party?
[03:42.960 --> 03:47.400]  How about how big tech takes hundreds of millions in foreign advertising money that's
[03:47.400 --> 03:49.800]  really globalist money to try to throw this election and others?
[03:49.800 --> 03:58.800]  I mean, there's so many recipes on how to fricassee this thing that Trump's not surrounded
[03:58.800 --> 04:00.400]  by idiots.
[04:00.400 --> 04:07.080]  And the word is, Ivanka and Jared, who have nothing against them personally, are so far
[04:07.080 --> 04:15.840]  up Google's ass, excuse my French, that, well, let's just say this, their lips and their
[04:15.840 --> 04:17.840]  asses are touching.
[04:17.840 --> 04:21.040]  And it's unbelievable.
[04:21.040 --> 04:22.040]  It's un-American.
[04:22.040 --> 04:23.040]  It's criminal.
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.040]  It's ridiculous.
[04:24.040 --> 04:25.040]  It's not, oh, they're a private company.
[04:25.040 --> 04:29.200]  They can surveil your private messages and control those and they can share your data
[04:29.200 --> 04:32.520]  and they can control what the president can say.
[04:32.520 --> 04:34.840]  This is the modern telephone.
[04:34.840 --> 04:37.200]  Imagine somebody breaks in your telephone.
[04:37.200 --> 04:38.200]  Oh, you can't say that.
[04:38.200 --> 04:39.200]  We're listening.
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.200]  You'd be like, this is outrageous.
[04:40.200 --> 04:44.120]  But if it's the internet and it's digital, oh, it's OK.
[04:44.120 --> 04:45.120]  Trampling all over us.
[04:45.120 --> 04:50.320]  But when we come back, this is the string on the sweater that will pull the whole house
[04:50.320 --> 04:51.320]  of cards down.
[04:51.320 --> 05:02.040]  And it's the deaths of these nursing homes, the premeditated planned murder.
[05:02.040 --> 05:04.680]  Please remember that we have a lot of great products that have been out of stock, back
[05:04.680 --> 05:05.680]  in stock, like krill oil.
[05:05.680 --> 05:06.680]  We have the ultimate krill oil.
[05:06.680 --> 05:09.360]  We don't have the benefits of krill oil.
[05:09.360 --> 05:10.360]  It's incredible.
[05:10.360 --> 05:14.160]  Everything in your body, for your heart, your skin, your libido, your stamina, your dreams,
[05:14.160 --> 05:15.520]  take one of these for you to sleep.
[05:15.520 --> 05:16.520]  It's well-known.
[05:16.520 --> 05:17.760]  Experience it for yourself.
[05:17.760 --> 05:22.640]  Infowarstore.com, X2 sold out for much, deep, earth, pure, crystal iodine, back in stock
[05:22.640 --> 05:27.680]  50% off, vaso beats, back in stock 50% off, vitamin, real fusion, back in stock 50% off,
[05:27.680 --> 05:31.000]  real red pill, red pill, plus with all the vitamins and minerals and the preglonone.
[05:31.000 --> 05:32.000]  That's close to selling out.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.200]  Both formulas were really close to selling out, real red pill, plus it's got some stimulant
[05:35.200 --> 05:36.600]  and then natural caffeine.
[05:36.600 --> 05:38.640]  That's close to selling out, 50% off still.
[05:38.640 --> 05:42.800]  Infowarstore.com, and we're already talking to our suppliers and some of them are saying,
[05:42.800 --> 05:47.000]  we may not take orders in a few months, so I may not ever be able to get products again.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.040]  Things are collapsing so bad, folks.
[05:49.040 --> 05:50.600]  This is total depression.
[05:50.600 --> 05:52.080]  The infrastructure is going down.
[05:52.080 --> 06:18.080]  Get the products while you still can.
[06:23.080 --> 06:26.560]  Wednesday, May 27th, 2020.
[06:26.560 --> 06:28.040]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:28.040 --> 06:36.960]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours with 159 days out to the historic election.
[06:36.960 --> 06:45.320]  And you couldn't have two more polar opposites of Joe Biden, the political insider lawyer
[06:45.320 --> 06:50.240]  nobody, the puppet and Donald John Trump, the maverick, his own man.
[06:50.240 --> 06:53.800]  You could disagree with what Trump does sometimes, but he's definitely the president.
[06:53.800 --> 06:58.320]  He's definitely in charge, and the globalists are crapping their britches.
[06:58.320 --> 07:03.360]  But there's Biden up there with his Kabuki theater, with his little mask on, and, oh,
[07:03.360 --> 07:04.360]  Trump's not good.
[07:04.360 --> 07:05.360]  Trump's endangering people.
[07:05.360 --> 07:08.760]  You've got to do what a special guild says forever.
[07:08.760 --> 07:13.920]  You've got to let them run your life and have tracker chips and phones and social distancing
[07:13.920 --> 07:19.200]  and cycled on and off wearing masks and can't travel, and your job's not essential.
[07:19.200 --> 07:21.560]  We're not essential, but we're essential.
[07:21.560 --> 07:23.000]  This isn't red flags, folks.
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.240]  This is alarm bells and explosions going off.
[07:26.240 --> 07:29.360]  This is a thousand alarm fire.
[07:29.360 --> 07:32.320]  We'll cover it all the day.
[07:32.320 --> 07:35.400]  I don't get into mumbo jumbo.
[07:35.400 --> 07:37.720]  There's plenty of that.
[07:37.720 --> 07:41.000]  But I get into what's real.
[07:41.000 --> 07:46.680]  And for anything that's real, the spirit world, the other dimensions, good and evil, you're
[07:46.680 --> 07:49.680]  going to have counterfeits out there that talk about spiritual experiences they've had
[07:49.680 --> 07:58.080]  or six cents they've had or things that transcend our five senses.
[07:58.080 --> 08:02.760]  But this was a big issue weeks ago.
[08:02.760 --> 08:05.920]  It wasn't even that big of an issue right now.
[08:05.920 --> 08:10.480]  But I had a lot of people bring this up to me yesterday, and then I prayed last night
[08:10.480 --> 08:17.720]  before I went to sleep that the answer to bringing down the globalists and exposing
[08:17.720 --> 08:23.120]  their whole COVID-19 hoax materialized in my mind, is it that they're putting people
[08:23.120 --> 08:29.440]  that die of cancer and gunshot wounds and car wrecks on the COVID list?
[08:29.440 --> 08:30.440]  That's big.
[08:30.440 --> 08:33.960]  Is it that the UN's running the whole thing and directing us and that all their numbers
[08:33.960 --> 08:39.280]  were fraudulent and lies and 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 times bigger than what they projected?
[08:39.280 --> 08:43.960]  Is it the Wuhan lab made it so they have a patentable virus they can actually make a
[08:43.960 --> 08:46.240]  vaccine for?
[08:46.240 --> 08:50.640]  All that's important that Fauci working with Obama transferred it to them, and it was a
[08:50.640 --> 08:53.800]  big scandal five years ago, and they think we're just going to forget about that.
[08:53.800 --> 08:58.600]  All that's important.
[08:58.600 --> 09:02.760]  And I already made a big deal about this point yesterday, but it really hit me last night.
[09:02.760 --> 09:11.360]  And so I went to bed about nine, I woke up about three, 20.
[09:11.360 --> 09:19.240]  And I got up, started doing research, and boom, into my text message comes Rob Dues
[09:19.240 --> 09:20.240]  text.
[09:20.240 --> 09:24.200]  He's up at 5 a.m. saying, look at this.
[09:24.200 --> 09:28.040]  And of course, it was the same subject, but something that my own research for an hour
[09:28.040 --> 09:33.960]  and a half I hadn't found yet, I was sending links off to the producer for the show today.
[09:33.960 --> 09:38.680]  And so next segment, I'm going to get into this because this isn't just about the lives
[09:38.680 --> 09:44.120]  of these people, more than half the COVID-19 deaths in the United States.
[09:44.120 --> 09:47.320]  Our nursing home, folks.
[09:47.320 --> 09:53.640]  It's about the rollout and how they systematically did it, and we're always then planning to
[09:53.640 --> 09:56.880]  blame Trump later.
[09:56.880 --> 09:59.920]  And this isn't about defending Trump.
[09:59.920 --> 10:04.360]  This is about learning how these criminal networks operate and the criminal architecture
[10:04.360 --> 10:09.840]  of how they battle-planned and pre-planned and beta-tested what they rolled out on us
[10:09.840 --> 10:14.360]  for at least a decade and had it in their pocket, and we're already planning to do it,
[10:14.360 --> 10:19.520]  but now they're focusing it against Trump and the nation state and the economy.
[10:19.520 --> 10:23.480]  And now Gates has come out and said, this is only really a beta test.
[10:23.480 --> 10:30.160]  This is event 201, event 202 will be a much more deadly pathogen, just as I've told you,
[10:30.160 --> 10:33.360]  because it's logical progression with these psychotics.
[10:33.360 --> 10:36.880]  When you've read enough of their white papers and watched them long enough, you get inside
[10:36.880 --> 10:42.600]  their heads, and let me tell you, it's not a pretty place, because word for word what
[10:42.600 --> 10:45.600]  they're going to say and do, and all of you witness this and all of you make your own
[10:45.600 --> 10:51.760]  predictions you see happening, and a week later, exactly word for word, this is a final
[10:51.760 --> 10:54.680]  solution to call the world population.
[10:54.680 --> 10:56.720]  This is what Hitler wished he'd do.
[10:56.720 --> 11:03.560]  A week later, he goes on, Kobair, and says, we're carrying out the final solution, and
[11:03.560 --> 11:07.480]  Kobair goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, you might not want to use the Nazi term for killing off
[11:07.480 --> 11:11.040]  the undesirables.
[11:11.040 --> 11:16.680]  So then this morning, I walked into a gas station, I couldn't help it, I wanted an ice
[11:16.680 --> 11:21.720]  cream sandwich, a little treat, and the guy behind the counter goes, you know what pisses
[11:21.720 --> 11:23.640]  me off more than anything.
[11:23.640 --> 11:28.360]  What they did to all those folks in those nursing homes, they need to hang.
[11:28.360 --> 11:35.160]  Now, again, it's bigger than the dead, which is important, but they've gone over the other
[11:35.160 --> 11:38.760]  side now, they would want those that killed them to be brought to justice, but it's bigger
[11:38.760 --> 11:40.320]  than that.
[11:40.320 --> 11:46.160]  You knock this domino down, I mean, this is the Death Star shot, the money shot, this
[11:46.160 --> 11:54.840]  is the bull's eye, it's the Grand Slam, it's the Royal Flush, it's everything.
[11:54.840 --> 12:01.520]  I've analyzed it and I've spiritually cogitated on it, and I was super guilty last night when
[12:01.520 --> 12:03.800]  I went to bed that I didn't make a bigger deal about this, I mean, I talked about it
[12:03.800 --> 12:07.600]  a lot, we said it's terrible, aren't they evil, and I realized they were breaking my
[12:07.600 --> 12:11.960]  will subconsciously in that they've killed so many babies and so many old people and
[12:11.960 --> 12:17.800]  taught us that human life was worthless and that they're so evil that I was here just
[12:17.800 --> 12:21.120]  going, oh yeah, and they're sending COVID patients to these places on purpose to have
[12:21.120 --> 12:26.200]  a higher number and to get rid of people and make fifty-something thousand dollars off of
[12:26.200 --> 12:30.480]  each person they kill, and then Media Matters wrote an article about it a few weeks ago
[12:30.480 --> 12:35.160]  saying I'm a terrible person, saying healthcare workers are killing people, no, the actuaries,
[12:35.160 --> 12:39.640]  the bioethics boards, the corporations that set the policies are, but again, they're
[12:39.640 --> 12:43.920]  going to hide behind the healthcare workers, they're going to hide behind, oh, Trump told
[12:43.920 --> 12:46.960]  us to do it, you mean Fauci that follows the UN directive?
[12:46.960 --> 12:52.080]  Not one Republican state followed this UN directive that Fauci then regurgitated, you
[12:52.080 --> 13:01.840]  think Trump is looking at everything to tell this, to put COVID patients in nursing homes.
[13:01.840 --> 13:08.520]  That's a default move, like if you've got a can of gasoline in the middle of August
[13:08.520 --> 13:17.040]  and say Iowa with a dead field of dry grass, and you just like the grass, it's going to
[13:17.040 --> 13:21.840]  burn the field down, but if you run around with gasoline end to end with a fifty-gallon
[13:21.840 --> 13:29.200]  tank of it, the whole thing's going to explode and burn down in minutes.
[13:29.200 --> 13:39.160]  Nursing patients that are COVID-posited by the hundreds in per facility, chalking them
[13:39.160 --> 13:42.680]  right next to old people, I went and looked it up, they'll put people in the same damn
[13:42.680 --> 13:48.440]  room with somebody knowing it's a death sentence, and over half the death nation, why it was
[13:48.440 --> 13:54.320]  48, now it's 51% of all the deaths are nursing homes, and it's like dominoes, one after the
[13:54.320 --> 14:00.680]  other, think about the cold bloodedness of this, the UN comes up with it, it's put out
[14:00.680 --> 14:08.280]  by the NIH, CDC, and the DIMMs follow the UN plan to the T, Republican states didn't,
[14:08.280 --> 14:17.120]  and I mean, this is like if I walked in to a nursing home with people with a deadly pneumonia
[14:17.120 --> 14:20.800]  and said we're going to put people next to you, oh, that's what they did.
[14:20.800 --> 14:25.880]  The one group that was killing that they knew not just to boost the numbers, not just to
[14:25.880 --> 14:36.200]  make the money, 13,000, 49,000 to your math, that's a lot of money, 50 plus thousand dollars,
[14:36.200 --> 14:42.800]  that's not even why they did it, that's just gravy, you got gravy, you got your chicken
[14:42.800 --> 14:50.080]  fried steak, you got your peas, you got your corn on the cob, you got your sad fixes there,
[14:50.080 --> 14:58.080]  but the steak is the power to be able to do that, have everybody cover it up, and then
[14:58.080 --> 15:03.160]  run it and then say Trump told you to do it.
[15:03.160 --> 15:07.520]  When Trump's been caught up in all the hysteria and fighting the whole thing, being drugged
[15:07.520 --> 15:13.840]  down river, and then they've got the nerve to say it's his fault now after they just
[15:13.840 --> 15:20.120]  killed 50 plus thousand people, and it's the very group running it and posing as our saviors
[15:20.120 --> 15:24.200]  and telling us it's never going to end and who want total medical control by centralized
[15:24.200 --> 15:29.360]  companies, computers and the UN over everything your doctors and nurses do, this is a test
[15:29.360 --> 15:34.920]  to see what they can get doctors and nurses to do and to manage all the death and destruction
[15:34.920 --> 15:39.440]  and then indemnify all these companies that carried out the killing, that's why as soon
[15:39.440 --> 15:43.440]  as all this came out Cuomo committed a major crime, not just killing the old people, I'll
[15:43.440 --> 15:46.160]  tell you about it when we come back.
[15:46.160 --> 15:49.880]  He now is threatening to take the licenses and arrest all the nursing homes because of
[15:49.880 --> 15:54.600]  COVID-19 deaths, saying they didn't carry out proper safety procedures when he ordered
[15:54.600 --> 15:56.880]  them to put them in there and kill everybody.
[15:56.880 --> 16:01.600]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[16:01.600 --> 16:04.920]  The globalists have taken the gloves off, and they've taken the mask off, and they're
[16:04.920 --> 16:10.400]  like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips, yeah, we're into pedophilia, yeah, we're into
[16:10.400 --> 16:16.080]  the new world government, yeah, you're obsolete, you are non-essential, we are shutting your
[16:16.080 --> 16:21.240]  ass down, yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry
[16:21.240 --> 16:25.800]  anymore, you're going to be the service economy and now the globalists are telling you that
[16:25.800 --> 16:30.320]  there's no more service economy and you're obsolete, so you better bow down to them and
[16:30.320 --> 16:34.640]  get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.840]  The handcuffs are going on right now, we have to resist and say no to the new world order
[16:39.840 --> 16:44.400]  and that takes you understanding you were right and understanding I was right and getting
[16:44.400 --> 16:50.680]  in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can, now is the time for action,
[16:50.680 --> 16:56.960]  now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[16:56.960 --> 17:00.800]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen
[17:00.800 --> 17:04.960]  to a song and telling you all these horrible things, but you notice almost everything we've
[17:04.960 --> 17:07.560]  talked about, horrible, has come true.
[17:07.560 --> 17:13.760]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it, it's like telling somebody if you got a pool,
[17:13.760 --> 17:17.200]  put a fence around it if you have little kids, because even if they're good swimmers they
[17:17.200 --> 17:20.720]  can hit their head and drown, people don't listen, they go out and their kids dead in
[17:20.720 --> 17:21.720]  the pool.
[17:21.720 --> 17:24.920]  Well ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the
[17:24.920 --> 17:31.080]  first world and this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalists and they admit
[17:31.080 --> 17:35.440]  they've orchestrated it, they admit it's quote good to save the earth and they're teaching
[17:35.440 --> 17:40.280]  us to be more frugal and they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender
[17:40.280 --> 17:42.400]  to this post-human technocracy.
[17:42.400 --> 17:47.400]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public
[17:47.400 --> 17:52.240]  because it's their operations manual, I wish this wasn't the case, but they're really our
[17:52.240 --> 18:13.240]  evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them.
[18:13.240 --> 18:24.200]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame, everybody
[18:24.200 --> 18:32.560]  won't be treated all the same, there'll be a golden letter reaching down when the man
[18:32.560 --> 18:36.040]  comes around, when the man comes around.
[18:36.040 --> 18:46.880]  We are back live, I'm your host Alex Jones, now we have in our hands the photon torpedoes
[18:46.880 --> 18:54.360]  to fire down the Death Star reactor shaft and we have the missiles aimed directly over
[18:54.360 --> 19:01.240]  it, all you got to do is get a button and they're done, now let me explain this, I've
[19:01.240 --> 19:07.200]  learned and studied their criminal activity and I've gotten inside their sick brains and
[19:07.200 --> 19:10.360]  then you can always reverse engineer and find their own documents where they admitted all
[19:10.360 --> 19:11.360]  themselves.
[19:11.360 --> 19:18.760]  These criminals loved it, also flaunt things in front of everybody, that's basic criminology.
[19:18.760 --> 19:23.120]  They knew they weren't going to have big death numbers on COVID-19.
[19:23.120 --> 19:34.040]  They knew it's a nasty, souped up pneumonia.
[19:34.040 --> 19:40.080]  So listen to me, I can easily just talk about all this or we can all understand, I think
[19:40.080 --> 19:44.880]  you all know this better than I, that if we get this story out and if this gets exposed
[19:44.880 --> 19:49.320]  it's over for them and they know that, I'm about to show you proof, they've already
[19:49.320 --> 20:00.600]  committed major crimes covering up these crimes in New York.
[20:00.600 --> 20:06.440]  And I can tell you that these very individuals want me arrested because we've been exposing
[20:06.440 --> 20:14.400]  this, well they can burn in hell and I'm sure they will because we're not backing down.
[20:14.400 --> 20:19.040]  So Cuomo and all the rest of this trash thought trying to push the American people around
[20:19.040 --> 20:27.040]  would make us back down, think again, scumbag.
[20:27.040 --> 20:29.800]  You may have been pushing around a lot of folks up there in New York, you're not pushing
[20:29.800 --> 20:36.680]  me around, you're not pushing Texas around, sunny boy, let's get right to it.
[20:36.680 --> 20:42.240]  It's been laid on my heart that I'm going to go to Michigan and I'm going to go to New
[20:42.240 --> 20:49.640]  York at least and probably California and Pennsylvania and I'm going to literally go
[20:49.640 --> 20:55.520]  with the people's arrest warrant to go make the point that these people need to be arrested
[20:55.520 --> 21:00.920]  immediately because you see the globalist, Goebbels who was a proto-globalist, the Nazi
[21:00.920 --> 21:05.560]  propaganda minister, they had the EU plan, the whole plan to expand that into 10 regions
[21:05.560 --> 21:10.880]  of the world with the three mega regions starting with the EU, he said, if you're going to tell
[21:10.880 --> 21:17.160]  a lot, tell it so gigantic and so huge that people can't believe that you would possibly
[21:17.160 --> 21:18.760]  tell a whopper that big.
[21:18.760 --> 21:23.040]  And as long as you're in government and as long as you have the authority, people will
[21:23.040 --> 21:26.200]  tend to not challenge it because it's so ridiculous.
[21:26.200 --> 21:30.720]  Like the imper's new clothes, the imper's butt naked, but anybody that says he's naked
[21:30.720 --> 21:34.240]  will be executed, so everybody goes along with it.
[21:34.240 --> 21:38.480]  That's how craziness at the top rolls down, it's psychology.
[21:38.480 --> 21:44.760]  So the UN comes out with guidelines and the NIH run by Bill and Melinda Gates on record,
[21:44.760 --> 21:48.240]  Trump just inherits this whole bureaucracy where every major bureaucrat at the top has
[21:48.240 --> 21:52.000]  been put through college by the very same robber barons.
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.320]  And then once he got into power in the last 30 years, Bill Gates is the chief science
[21:55.320 --> 22:01.160]  officer of this cult.
[22:01.160 --> 22:05.280]  And so understanding what they've done in the nursing homes is important.
[22:05.280 --> 22:10.480]  And the cover up's important, understanding how they're trying to frame Trump is important,
[22:10.480 --> 22:16.400]  but it's the whole process that burns them down.
[22:16.400 --> 22:27.400]  And it's the understanding how they premeditatedly planned all of this publicly to jack up the
[22:27.400 --> 22:34.680]  numbers to make $52,000 off of every person they killed.
[22:34.680 --> 22:41.000]  And then to use that to corrupt all the healthcare institutions that, oh, we'll charge you in
[22:41.000 --> 22:44.560]  being part of this if you don't do exactly what we say.
[22:44.560 --> 22:49.360]  So they got them to commit the crime by following the order, that's how the mafia works.
[22:49.360 --> 22:57.680]  And then once they've gotten you to commit the crime, now they got you by the balls.
[22:57.680 --> 23:07.440]  So let's talk about it, because this is, you press one button, they get dropped in the
[23:07.440 --> 23:09.360]  bacon grease.
[23:09.360 --> 23:11.400]  You decide to get pissed about this.
[23:11.400 --> 23:14.640]  You decide later when this video has been archived, demand a video to share it.
[23:14.640 --> 23:19.680]  You decide to go do your own research and demand at your church, your pastor cover this, or
[23:19.680 --> 23:20.680]  break the church up.
[23:20.680 --> 23:21.680]  Go start a new one.
[23:21.680 --> 23:27.360]  I mean, this is the type of stuff where people better stand up for our elderly, because there
[23:27.360 --> 23:28.360]  are us.
[23:28.360 --> 23:32.040]  Well, you talk about karma, what comes around goes around, read what you saw.
[23:32.040 --> 23:37.760]  What type of idiot wants to treat people like crap and not take care of in these crappy
[23:37.760 --> 23:40.520]  homes and not visit their family and not make sure they're taken care of.
[23:40.520 --> 23:45.080]  It's the children and family not standing up for people that has turned many of these
[23:45.080 --> 23:51.520]  into hellish pits of evil.
[23:51.520 --> 23:56.000]  But that is a byproduct, ladies and gentlemen, of our selfishness and what we've turned
[23:56.000 --> 24:04.240]  into what we do to our unborn, what we do to our children.
[24:04.240 --> 24:10.560]  So if we're this degenerate by now, can you imagine what we're going to be like in 20
[24:10.560 --> 24:11.560]  years?
[24:11.560 --> 24:12.560]  No.
[24:12.560 --> 24:13.560]  This evil cannot stand.
[24:13.560 --> 24:17.560]  It's the evil doesn't just occupy the world, kind of leave you alone.
[24:17.560 --> 24:20.440]  It tries to take over.
[24:20.440 --> 24:21.440]  It always does.
[24:21.440 --> 24:26.440]  It's its nature.
[24:26.440 --> 24:27.440]  So I'm done preaching.
[24:27.440 --> 24:28.440]  I'm going to get into it now.
[24:28.440 --> 24:32.200]  But I just please call everyone, you know, and tell them to an end right now on the local
[24:32.200 --> 24:35.840]  AM and FM station you're listening to on the local TV station you're watching.
[24:35.840 --> 24:38.560]  And if you're watching on local radio or TV, tell folks about that station and then call
[24:38.560 --> 24:42.200]  friends and family and tell them who are outside that area and say info wars dot com
[24:42.200 --> 24:43.200]  port slash show.
[24:43.200 --> 24:44.200]  Oh, info wars.
[24:44.200 --> 24:45.200]  I heard it's bad.
[24:45.200 --> 24:48.200]  Well, we'll find out why they told you it's bad because it's not bad.
[24:48.200 --> 24:50.160]  It's over the target.
[24:50.160 --> 24:54.560]  And we can not just save hundreds of thousands of more old people that they're setting the
[24:54.560 --> 24:56.680]  precedent to kill.
[24:56.680 --> 24:57.680]  That's important, folks.
[24:57.680 --> 25:02.840]  But let me tell you, I guarantee I go to nursing home and talk to those old folks.
[25:02.840 --> 25:06.520]  They'll say, listen, I've already had my days and everything.
[25:06.520 --> 25:08.840]  This is for our children, our future, because they can do this to us.
[25:08.840 --> 25:13.400]  They can do this to anybody and that's what empathy is and why these people don't have
[25:13.400 --> 25:14.400]  it.
[25:14.400 --> 25:18.720]  They're so foolish and they get that jack-o'-lantern demon looked at the governor of California
[25:18.720 --> 25:25.000]  has the governor of New York has the governor of Michigan has that the CNN host Brian Stelter
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.720]  has the arrogant, satisfied evil that they're committing a crime against humanity and they
[25:31.720 --> 25:32.720]  love it.
[25:32.720 --> 25:38.440]  Governors who forced COVID-19 patients into nursing homes to kill everybody.
[25:38.440 --> 25:46.760]  Gretchen Whitmer, Andrew Cuomo, Gavin, American psycho Newsom, Tom Wolf.
[25:46.760 --> 25:50.280]  You know, you could put little Nazi uniforms on them and little Hitler mustaches.
[25:50.280 --> 25:51.280]  That turns it into a joke.
[25:51.280 --> 25:57.760]  It's not funny and they're not drunk enough on the blood of the 60-something million babies
[25:57.760 --> 25:58.760]  they killed in this country.
[25:58.760 --> 26:02.880]  Many of them, after they're already out of their mother's womb.
[26:02.880 --> 26:09.360]  Now they want to say, oh, we're going to send a highly infectious, really bad pneumonia
[26:09.360 --> 26:15.520]  into the one group it's guaranteed to kill and that half the numbers are going to be
[26:15.520 --> 26:20.280]  in the few states that did it and half the total numbers nationwide because if you average
[26:20.280 --> 26:25.440]  out just those states, it's even higher than 50%.
[26:25.440 --> 26:33.120]  This whole thing is engineered by these so-called smug demons.
[26:33.120 --> 26:36.560]  Look at that ugly witch and I'm not talking about how she physically looks.
[26:36.560 --> 26:37.560]  That is the group.
[26:37.560 --> 26:42.360]  I mean, a pile of maggots eating rotten flesh is beautiful compared to that face.
[26:42.360 --> 26:47.760]  That is a, oh, look at him, just all of these people are the trash of the earth.
[26:47.760 --> 26:53.240]  They are literal executioners, not just these old people, but freedom and justice and they
[26:53.240 --> 26:54.920]  need to pay.
[26:54.920 --> 26:59.760]  Now it's official, the United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency
[26:59.760 --> 27:05.880]  will last five years and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside
[27:05.880 --> 27:10.600]  or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed
[27:10.600 --> 27:15.800]  to have a list of 10 people that you visit and if you go outside that list of 10, you'll
[27:15.800 --> 27:17.800]  be permanently detained.
[27:17.800 --> 27:22.320]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order where they let the criminals
[27:22.320 --> 27:28.760]  out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers and where you are now non-essential
[27:28.760 --> 27:29.760]  and a prisoner.
[27:29.760 --> 27:34.160]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian anti-human
[27:34.160 --> 27:35.160]  group.
[27:35.160 --> 27:39.680]  They have to put this electronic straight jacket on us before they carry out their end
[27:39.680 --> 27:42.640]  game, which is global depopulation.
[27:42.640 --> 27:46.140]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[27:46.140 --> 27:52.160]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's
[27:52.160 --> 27:53.560]  mortal enemy.
[27:53.560 --> 27:54.560]  Wake up or die.
[27:54.560 --> 27:59.760]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here with InfowarsStore.com and I want to tell you about something that
[27:59.760 --> 28:03.680]  I think has really helped me out and I think can help you out too, especially if you have
[28:03.680 --> 28:06.320]  any problems sleeping and that's knockout.
[28:06.320 --> 28:07.320]  Let's face it.
[28:07.320 --> 28:12.360]  Some patterns have been disrupted by this lockdown, this government imposed imprisonment
[28:12.360 --> 28:16.040]  and it has definitely affected my sleep schedule, but one thing that has helped is knockout.
[28:16.040 --> 28:20.000]  I take one pill about an hour before I want to go to bed and boom, I get a great night's
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  sleep.
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.160]  And just this past Memorial Day, I took two of them, fell asleep about 1 a.m., woke
[28:24.160 --> 28:26.440]  up at 8 a.m., ready to go.
[28:26.440 --> 28:29.920]  It really has made a difference in my life and it can make a difference in your life
[28:29.920 --> 28:30.920]  too.
[28:30.920 --> 28:32.280]  If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch.
[28:32.280 --> 28:34.280]  If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point.
[28:34.280 --> 28:35.560]  You're going to be mentally focused.
[28:35.560 --> 28:38.040]  You're going to be ready to take on the day.
[28:38.040 --> 28:40.280]  And right now, knockout is 50% off.
[28:40.280 --> 28:42.160]  It's less than $15 a bottle.
[28:42.160 --> 28:43.480]  You get 30 capsules.
[28:43.480 --> 28:44.480]  Give it a try today.
[28:44.480 --> 28:49.160]  It's at a great price right now and it can really help you get the sleep you need, especially
[28:49.160 --> 28:50.600]  in these tough times.
[28:50.600 --> 28:55.840]  It's knockout and it's available at InfowarsStore.com.
[28:55.840 --> 29:00.840]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the Chai comms
[29:00.840 --> 29:06.920]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression, in fact, we're already into the worldwide
[29:06.920 --> 29:09.080]  depression and the death sentence for the third world.
[29:09.080 --> 29:14.960]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going
[29:14.960 --> 29:15.960]  to be.
[29:15.960 --> 29:21.080]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex
[29:21.080 --> 29:22.080]  economy.
[29:22.080 --> 29:23.080]  That's what we've always said.
[29:23.080 --> 29:27.080]  It's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists
[29:27.080 --> 29:30.880]  want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[29:30.880 --> 29:33.240]  They've admitted all of this.
[29:33.240 --> 29:39.320]  So remember, how does Infowars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[29:39.320 --> 29:41.280]  things before they happen?
[29:41.280 --> 29:46.120]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes, it's dystopic
[29:46.120 --> 29:47.560]  and yes, it's scary.
[29:47.560 --> 29:51.720]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[29:51.720 --> 30:20.720]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[30:21.720 --> 30:38.720]  I got a box of coffin nails in my pocket and I got a hammer and I got the New World Order
[30:38.720 --> 30:40.760]  laying in the coffin in front of me.
[30:40.760 --> 30:48.160]  All we got to do is put the lid on it and drive those nails in it and shove this casket
[30:48.160 --> 30:51.640]  into a six-foot hole.
[30:51.640 --> 30:58.160]  But I'm not strong enough to put the lid on and drive the nails, but we are strong enough
[30:58.160 --> 31:01.720]  together and we will.
[31:01.720 --> 31:08.600]  We have to see it through and we will see it through and we will be successful because
[31:08.600 --> 31:09.840]  we have got on our side.
[31:09.840 --> 31:13.040]  All right, let's get into it right now.
[31:13.040 --> 31:20.440]  There are so many facets to this, but let's just pull up to the 100,000-foot view first.
[31:20.440 --> 31:24.080]  See the whole earth down there.
[31:24.080 --> 31:30.280]  Why would the Nazis want to kill the mentally retarded and the old people and then pretty
[31:30.280 --> 31:36.880]  soon if you had a clubfoot, they killed you?
[31:36.880 --> 31:40.200]  Because if they could get an officer corps that started out with doctors, that's who
[31:40.200 --> 31:44.560]  first led the Nazi extermination operations, first groups killing people for who they were
[31:44.560 --> 31:50.640]  or was the doctor corps in the SS in 33, once Hitler was elected, people forget he was elected
[31:50.640 --> 31:55.960]  as president, later firebombed, the capitol building made himself chancellor and president
[31:55.960 --> 32:03.200]  unified it into the leader position, their furor.
[32:03.200 --> 32:08.840]  And the Soviets did the same stuff with the medical corps.
[32:08.840 --> 32:13.240]  And now you see the left everywhere using psychiatrists, psychologists, psychological
[32:13.240 --> 32:16.120]  police to go out and grab everybody in circumventive process.
[32:16.120 --> 32:19.240]  So that's how they're doing all this.
[32:19.240 --> 32:24.160]  And setting the precedent to the public and the courts and everybody, this is just normal.
[32:24.160 --> 32:29.960]  It is the very definition of tyranny, the blood of tyranny, the guts of tyranny, the
[32:29.960 --> 32:35.520]  very bone and sinew and mind and spirit.
[32:35.520 --> 32:39.960]  And so when you see Bill Gates up there talking about getting rid of old people and don't
[32:39.960 --> 32:45.080]  take care of grandma and you can hire 10 people, he's telling you that we're a conquest economy,
[32:45.080 --> 32:49.360]  that for you to win, somebody's got to lose when we can just make the pie infinitely bigger.
[32:49.360 --> 32:52.800]  We should certainly practice ingenuity, self-sufficiency, competition.
[32:52.800 --> 32:55.080]  Oh, the left gets rid of that, though, at the same time.
[32:55.080 --> 32:58.840]  While telling you, screwing somebody over, you say, you get ahead, but you got to do
[32:58.840 --> 32:59.840]  it through the system.
[32:59.840 --> 33:06.360]  You got to do it to a baby or to a down syndrome person or to an old person like the BBC pieces
[33:06.360 --> 33:10.200]  and others we've shown you in the Netherlands where they're like high functioning, down syndrome
[33:10.200 --> 33:11.200]  man.
[33:11.200 --> 33:14.760]  They're like, you cost six times more than the average citizen, so they make it socialist
[33:14.760 --> 33:20.040]  and then now you've got to know that, oh, you're costing others, well, we got to kill you.
[33:20.040 --> 33:25.160]  They want you to take on that attitude.
[33:25.160 --> 33:30.080]  So the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, it's not even debated, even mainstream news
[33:30.080 --> 33:35.440]  admits, runs the UNWHO, runs almost every country national health service with its corporate
[33:35.440 --> 33:38.320]  boards by buying off the top people.
[33:38.320 --> 33:42.520]  Their money is all tax-free, it's given to them by the intelligence agencies to set all
[33:42.520 --> 33:43.520]  this up.
[33:43.520 --> 33:45.000]  I mean, he's a major globalist operative.
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.080]  Remember, the new law is corporate, not governmental.
[33:48.080 --> 33:53.680]  It's corporations that have government power, but you have no rights against them.
[33:53.680 --> 33:55.200]  They are persons that have rights.
[33:55.200 --> 33:57.040]  You are a person that have no rights.
[33:57.040 --> 33:58.200]  They are stakeholders.
[33:58.200 --> 33:59.200]  You are not.
[33:59.200 --> 34:02.080]  These are all the real definitions you need to learn.
[34:02.080 --> 34:07.240]  And so imagine, if you pull back from this, they want to be able to come in, say there's
[34:07.240 --> 34:10.200]  all these COVID-19 deaths, control how many die.
[34:10.200 --> 34:14.800]  They can list all regular deaths of COVID-19 to get some numbers up, but they can also
[34:14.800 --> 34:18.440]  put it in nursing homes because it is a bad pneumonia and they know statistically it'll
[34:18.440 --> 34:21.640]  kill a bunch of people and now it's over half the deaths in the United States, over half
[34:21.640 --> 34:27.440]  the deaths in Europe, is putting COVID-19 patients in nursing homes and they do the
[34:27.440 --> 34:30.040]  same thing in Europe.
[34:30.040 --> 34:33.640]  They don't call them nursing homes, they call them convalescence homes in Italy.
[34:33.640 --> 34:38.440]  They were putting them in and nurses were going public saying, we're here and they're
[34:38.440 --> 34:43.200]  putting healthy patients that have COVID-19 saying they've got a quarantine in the damn
[34:43.200 --> 34:46.280]  hospital with sick and old people and it's spreading.
[34:46.280 --> 34:48.160]  They said, this is 101.
[34:48.160 --> 34:49.520]  Why are you doing this?
[34:49.520 --> 34:53.600]  Like, if you pulled up and I met your house with a can of gasoline pouring all over your
[34:53.600 --> 34:56.000]  front porch and lighting it, you know I'm crazy.
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.280]  You know I'm burning your house down.
[34:57.280 --> 35:06.440]  And you order nursing homes to take COVID patients, so quote, hospitals have room.
[35:06.440 --> 35:10.680]  So the hospitals have to be empty for the COVID patients, but the COVID patients have
[35:10.680 --> 35:13.520]  got to go where they've got a vector.
[35:13.520 --> 35:17.840]  You know, if you're a mosquito and you're laying larvae, you need some still warm water.
[35:17.840 --> 35:23.920]  Consistently, you know, 79 to 90 degrees, you need to be able to lay those eggs there
[35:23.920 --> 35:24.920]  and have that.
[35:24.920 --> 35:29.200]  And where's the best place to lay your eggs if you want to kill a bunch of people is a
[35:29.200 --> 35:30.200]  nursing home.
[35:30.200 --> 35:32.200]  It's the sweet spot.
[35:32.200 --> 35:37.360]  It's that place in the environment where this virus does its absolute best.
[35:37.360 --> 35:42.520]  And so you go and deliberately do it in the blue states, let's put our criminals back
[35:42.520 --> 35:48.440]  on screen, Gretchen Whitmer, Andrew Cuomo, Tom Wolf, Gavin Newsom.
[35:48.440 --> 35:53.320]  So you've got the wolf in sheep's clothing, you've got the American psycho, you've got
[35:53.320 --> 35:59.560]  demon woman, and you've got this spawn of hell over here.
[35:59.560 --> 36:01.320]  And it's all actually worried out.
[36:01.320 --> 36:02.400]  It's all carried out.
[36:02.400 --> 36:08.920]  So they get the billions of money because once you get an old person that's got COVID,
[36:08.920 --> 36:12.120]  well now you get $13,800.
[36:12.120 --> 36:15.880]  And then when you intubate them, they said, if you even have a fever and intubate your
[36:15.880 --> 36:27.040]  eggs, now you get another $39,200 and then they die really quick as you turn the pressure
[36:27.040 --> 36:31.360]  up higher and they've just got techs doing this, they're ordered to do it.
[36:31.360 --> 36:35.120]  But the techs come out and the doctors go, hey, we're in order to run the pressure higher.
[36:35.120 --> 36:38.360]  They say that we normally would for COVID patients because they want to get the money
[36:38.360 --> 36:39.760]  and not actually take care of them.
[36:39.760 --> 36:44.320]  You could run through that $39,000 if you keep them alive, plus they might sue you if
[36:44.320 --> 36:48.360]  you're going to kill, kill them quick.
[36:48.360 --> 36:53.000]  And then when it all starts to come out, you go, oh, wait, Trump told us to do this.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  Oh, really?
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.000]  Trump told you.
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.840]  You mean somebody in the NIH, Fauci, gave you a memo that Trump never saw.
[37:00.840 --> 37:02.360]  The Republicans are like, this is crazy.
[37:02.360 --> 37:10.720]  We're not going to stick people with COVID-19 in the main group it kills.
[37:10.720 --> 37:12.320]  And now they turn around and blame Trump.
[37:12.320 --> 37:17.640]  So these people have to pay for what they've done.
[37:17.640 --> 37:22.040]  And the public's upset, the public gets it, but we don't just need lawsuits.
[37:22.040 --> 37:28.200]  We don't just need, you know, 70,000 new lawsuits for the people they've killed so far.
[37:28.200 --> 37:30.240]  And the hundreds of thousands more they're going to kill.
[37:30.240 --> 37:31.240]  That doesn't fix the country.
[37:31.240 --> 37:35.240]  Sure, have lawsuits all day long, but Cuomo's come out, I've got the articles right here.
[37:35.240 --> 37:43.240]  I'll show you when we come back and he has said, oh, we're going to indict and take the
[37:43.240 --> 37:46.160]  licenses away from everybody that allowed COVID deaths.
[37:46.160 --> 37:54.760]  So now he's put with that monster woman, he's got James, the gangster attorney general,
[37:54.760 --> 38:03.920]  the laughing stock criminal in charge of now after ordering under penalty of being commandeered
[38:03.920 --> 38:09.480]  going to jail, we can pull the clips up, I'm going to put you in jail if you don't open
[38:09.480 --> 38:18.040]  up your nursing homes, you greedy, selfish people, remember that?
[38:18.040 --> 38:21.280]  And now he says, I'm going to indict you for the death.
[38:21.280 --> 38:23.120]  So they go, huh, hands up.
[38:23.120 --> 38:27.920]  So he has you commit the crime, he's the, he's the mob boss, he tells the capos to order
[38:27.920 --> 38:31.040]  you to do this, you're a soldier, you don't know what you're doing.
[38:31.040 --> 38:35.720]  And now the mob boss calls you in and says, you did what I told you to do, I am going
[38:35.720 --> 38:40.560]  to have you chopped up and fed to the fishes.
[38:40.560 --> 38:41.960]  He really thinks we're that stupid.
[38:41.960 --> 38:43.960]  Oh, but guess what?
[38:43.960 --> 38:47.040]  I was looking around this morning for his executive order, it was gone, didn't know it
[38:47.040 --> 38:48.040]  was already a news story.
[38:48.040 --> 38:49.040]  Dr. McCam shot, please.
[38:49.040 --> 39:00.160]  Turns out he committed a crime, he ordered them to delete it out of official records.
[39:00.160 --> 39:05.640]  New York health department website quietly deletes controversial coma order that forced
[39:05.640 --> 39:14.240]  nursing homes to admit coronavirus patients and led to 5,000 deaths.
[39:14.240 --> 39:18.440]  And that very New York state health department are the ones that ordered us not to sell any
[39:18.440 --> 39:21.680]  silver products and called us criminals and all that.
[39:21.680 --> 39:28.560]  And meanwhile, they are engaging in crimes, deleting these documents and covering up the
[39:28.560 --> 39:31.320]  mass murder that's going on in that perfect.
[39:31.320 --> 39:33.880]  That's how they muscle everybody, how they try to shut everybody up.
[39:33.880 --> 39:34.880]  Well, guess what?
[39:34.880 --> 39:43.400]  If you thought this dog was on your ass before, I'm on your ass for keeps now.
[39:43.400 --> 39:47.880]  What a pack of murdering sick gangsters.
[39:47.880 --> 39:54.320]  These are serial killers amongst us and they're just getting started till we stop them.
[39:54.320 --> 39:55.320]  Memorial Day is here.
[39:55.320 --> 39:59.360]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year and we were already running a huge sale,
[39:59.360 --> 40:02.560]  but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[40:02.560 --> 40:07.200]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale and then five items that
[40:07.200 --> 40:11.360]  weren't on sale that we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well
[40:11.360 --> 40:13.040]  for the Memorial Day special.
[40:13.040 --> 40:18.840]  So here it is, super male vitality, 40% off, knockout, the great sleeping, 50% off, Brain
[40:18.840 --> 40:21.160]  Force Plus hadn't been on sale for almost six months.

[40:28.920 --> 40:32.440]  got all these other items on sale as well until they sell out.
[40:32.440 --> 40:37.720]  So infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine to get these
[40:37.720 --> 40:40.880]  items and take advantage of this mega sale Memorial Day.
[40:40.880 --> 40:42.680]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[40:42.680 --> 40:46.480]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supported you and your
[40:46.480 --> 40:49.440]  family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[40:49.440 --> 40:51.040]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[40:51.040 --> 40:53.840]  We are all in this together.
[40:53.840 --> 40:58.560]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying, our economy slowing down and shutting
[40:58.560 --> 41:03.320]  down is like shooting a deer and it runs a hundred yards before it knows it's been shot
[41:03.320 --> 41:04.320]  and then it finally dies.
[41:04.320 --> 41:09.160]  She said, well, yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an argument in
[41:09.160 --> 41:13.760]  the street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the
[41:13.760 --> 41:18.840]  head had blood pouring out, a huge hole and he was holding it and he walked around gibbering
[41:18.840 --> 41:22.760]  talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead.
[41:22.760 --> 41:25.720]  Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy.
[41:25.720 --> 41:27.120]  It is in cardiac arrest.
[41:27.120 --> 41:32.880]  This has been done by design and the UN, the Chai Coms, the mainstream media orchestrated
[41:32.880 --> 41:35.960]  it, hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed.
[41:35.960 --> 41:40.720]  So remember, the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the
[41:40.720 --> 41:46.760]  UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats.
[41:46.760 --> 41:50.400]  We tried to stop it, we tried to fight it, but you guys have said you wanted to wreck
[41:50.400 --> 41:53.640]  America and the world and now you've done it.
[41:53.640 --> 41:55.040]  Congratulations.
[41:55.040 --> 41:58.960]  We are 170 days out from the 2020 election.
[41:58.960 --> 42:03.520]  It is a referendum of national sovereignty against globalism.
[42:03.520 --> 42:08.480]  And Obama, Hillary and the deep state have been caught attempting to overthrow President
[42:08.480 --> 42:13.800]  Trump's election and they've been caught in two separate coup attempts against the president.
[42:13.800 --> 42:18.400]  Now they've been pushing COVID-19 to shut down the economy and create a depression while
[42:18.400 --> 42:21.560]  China's already been open for business for more than a month.
[42:21.560 --> 42:27.080]  This is an ongoing globalist attempt to punish the American people, wreck our economy and
[42:27.080 --> 42:30.800]  hope that we won't recognize that it is they, the New World Order, that have orchestrated
[42:30.800 --> 42:33.520]  this and not President Trump.
[42:33.520 --> 42:35.240]  They know their crimes are coming out.
[42:35.240 --> 42:37.760]  They know the chickens are coming home to roost.
[42:37.760 --> 42:43.280]  So now they're panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based
[42:43.280 --> 42:46.280]  on keeping the public safe from COVID-19.
[42:46.280 --> 42:52.840]  The entire COVID-19 system is a giant hoax and must be exposed if America has any hope.
[42:52.840 --> 42:57.280]  So get out there and expose this fraud.
[42:57.280 --> 43:02.200]  We're living in insanely dangerous times and I told folks going back three months ago,
[43:02.200 --> 43:05.560]  I'm not buying horrible food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[43:05.560 --> 43:08.520]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[43:08.520 --> 43:12.960]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages
[43:12.960 --> 43:16.640]  and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States and it's even worse in
[43:16.640 --> 43:17.640]  the Third World.
[43:17.640 --> 43:20.360]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[43:20.360 --> 43:25.360]  But with the election fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the Third World collapsing
[43:25.360 --> 43:29.560]  and everything else is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll
[43:29.560 --> 43:31.080]  last for 25 years.
[43:31.080 --> 43:33.080]  They're in easily totable bags.
[43:33.080 --> 43:36.560]  It's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready.
[43:36.560 --> 43:37.560]  And it funds the InfoWars.
[43:37.560 --> 43:41.560]  So we have storeable food available again, infowarsstore.com or call toll-free, triple
[43:41.560 --> 43:45.200]  A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, whatever you do, get prepared and get ready
[43:45.200 --> 43:47.560]  because the globalists want you dependent on them.
[43:47.560 --> 43:49.200]  They do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[43:49.200 --> 43:57.560]  Get your storeable food at infowarsstore.com right now while you still can.
[43:57.560 --> 44:18.880]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:18.880 --> 44:19.880]  We are back live.
[44:19.880 --> 44:24.160]  We are broadcasting worldwide and only you can amplify this message.
[44:24.160 --> 44:26.840]  You are the Info War.
[44:26.840 --> 44:30.080]  That isn't a statement, it's the truth.
[44:30.080 --> 44:34.000]  I can feel the energy and I can feel your power.
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.000]  I can feel the Guardians of the Republic rising.
[44:38.000 --> 44:44.360]  All right, let's get into it.
[44:44.360 --> 44:50.920]  Here's the summation and the key.
[44:50.920 --> 45:00.760]  The globalists premeditatedly directed in their blue states the infected COVID patients
[45:00.760 --> 45:08.240]  who were asymptomatic spreaders in two buildings and facilities with the people they knew it
[45:08.240 --> 45:14.440]  would kill and now over half the deaths are caused by them.
[45:14.440 --> 45:18.320]  And then they turn around and I'll show you the articles here in a moment and tell everybody
[45:18.320 --> 45:24.400]  that they're criminals because they didn't keep the patients apart.
[45:24.400 --> 45:28.080]  Remember they're the ones telling you stay six feet apart and get us all fighting with
[45:28.080 --> 45:30.080]  each other.
[45:30.080 --> 45:35.160]  Wear your mask and you know stay and you're a hero but then they're sending people that
[45:35.160 --> 45:40.800]  are sick with this supposedly thing way worse than SARS where they have special buildings
[45:40.800 --> 45:45.600]  for the SARS patients and special buildings and spacesuits and they're welding people
[45:45.600 --> 45:49.280]  into their buildings in China and why you've got to stay quarantined in your house or we'll
[45:49.280 --> 45:53.600]  arrest you and police would go to people's houses in Kentucky and stuff that it had and
[45:53.600 --> 45:58.920]  said they were fine and have checkpoints around their homes and contact tracers to see where
[45:58.920 --> 46:04.120]  you're close to somebody but then oh, let's send the people with the disease that only
[46:04.120 --> 46:06.560]  basically kills old people.
[46:06.560 --> 46:17.640]  Let's send very infected, dangerous bombs in and then here's the key.
[46:17.640 --> 46:20.200]  Remember back when they did it four months ago, three months ago, it was all over the
[46:20.200 --> 46:22.240]  news people like this is crazy.
[46:22.240 --> 46:25.280]  The nursing homes medical staff is saying this is a death sentence.
[46:25.280 --> 46:27.040]  What are you thinking?
[46:27.040 --> 46:32.560]  You shouldn't even go visit family in the nursing homes if you're sick.
[46:32.560 --> 46:35.720]  Everybody knows don't go visit grandma she's 89 years old and I've got a cold.
[46:35.720 --> 46:41.480]  I don't want to get her sick but it gets better.
[46:41.480 --> 46:49.720]  So they could do it in these four beta test states Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, California
[46:49.720 --> 46:55.080]  that already account for a third of the decimal down country.
[46:55.080 --> 47:01.880]  They said you can't go see grandma because see, oh, you can't come in the building.
[47:01.880 --> 47:06.560]  We will let you touch the glass while we snake a tube down her throat and get 50 plus thousand
[47:06.560 --> 47:10.480]  bucks while we do this and when we kill your mother, kill your father, kill your grandma
[47:10.480 --> 47:17.280]  or kill your sister or kill your brother or kill your son or daughter while we kill you
[47:17.280 --> 47:20.880]  while we commit this crime, you can't come in and that's the thing.
[47:20.880 --> 47:26.280]  It's top down like criminals in a mastermind movie where they're going to rob the Fort
[47:26.280 --> 47:27.280]  Knox.
[47:27.280 --> 47:30.080]  They've got every part of it planned out.
[47:30.080 --> 47:32.120]  That's what criminals do.
[47:32.120 --> 47:36.240]  That's what the globalists are always like trying to sue me and get the secret documents
[47:36.240 --> 47:41.440]  of the secret funding and who gives the orders and who's in command.
[47:41.440 --> 47:45.960]  The brain God gave me is in command, the Holy Spirit's in command and it's getting more
[47:45.960 --> 47:49.680]  powerful every day to beat you because God's best.
[47:49.680 --> 47:54.840]  You devil worshipers just hadn't figured it out yet, have you?
[47:54.840 --> 47:58.200]  You're not the masterminds, you're the master losers because you sell out to evil thinking
[47:58.200 --> 48:00.240]  because you commit evil, you're smart.
[48:00.240 --> 48:02.720]  Oh, look, other people aren't doing this like me.
[48:02.720 --> 48:03.720]  I must be special.
[48:03.720 --> 48:06.400]  Yeah, like cancer.
[48:06.400 --> 48:08.240]  You don't follow the rules God gave us.
[48:08.240 --> 48:13.000]  It's called sin.
[48:13.000 --> 48:14.000]  What is sin?
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.280]  It's something that breaks things down in the end and you're like, well, why do they,
[48:19.280 --> 48:22.960]  I could see sin cheating on your wife or I could see sin drinking too much liquor.
[48:22.960 --> 48:24.200]  At least there's some fun in that.
[48:24.200 --> 48:25.680]  It's always ends bad.
[48:25.680 --> 48:32.080]  But what about the sin of just wanting to hurt people because when you look at the gleam
[48:32.080 --> 48:35.440]  in Newsom's face yesterday at a press conference where he looked like he was having orgasms
[48:35.440 --> 48:43.720]  and you look at Hitler over there and or Himmler, whatever it was, yeah, Whitmer, he
[48:43.720 --> 48:49.360]  looks like Himmler, Hitler and Himmler in the same word and they all look like they're
[48:49.360 --> 48:50.360]  on drugs.
[48:50.360 --> 48:52.640]  They all look completely psychotic because they are.
[48:52.640 --> 48:54.880]  This is who Satan had to get.
[48:54.880 --> 49:06.080]  Brian Stelter, but that's like a high I mean, you know, making psychotic pirate faces like
[49:06.080 --> 49:08.440]  Oh, Stelter, you're so powerful.
[49:08.440 --> 49:10.880]  We're scared of you.
[49:10.880 --> 49:15.560]  Get him off the screen, please.
[49:15.560 --> 49:20.600]  But that's who these people are.
[49:20.600 --> 49:24.000]  So let's get into the documents just because I just spent 45, 50 minutes on this.
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  Let me just show you.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.440]  New York Health Department website quietly deletes controversial coma order that forced
[49:30.440 --> 49:34.440]  nursing homes to admit coronavirus patients led to 5,000 deaths.
[49:34.440 --> 49:38.280]  Now under federal and state law in New York and federally, that's a crime to officially
[49:38.280 --> 49:40.600]  delete a document out of a database.
[49:40.600 --> 49:48.200]  Oh, and, you know, Alex Jones always shows you the proof 1663 US code justice.gov protection
[49:48.200 --> 49:53.840]  of government property protection of public records and documents updated in 1974 with
[49:53.840 --> 49:56.280]  the Freedom of Information Act.
[49:56.280 --> 49:59.800]  Also explaining it's a felony and that's what they just did.
[49:59.800 --> 50:04.160]  Oh, but it's okay because you're the mafia Don of New York and we're all so scared of
[50:04.160 --> 50:05.160]  you.
[50:05.160 --> 50:06.160]  Come on.
[50:06.160 --> 50:07.160]  So scared of you.
[50:07.160 --> 50:09.360]  Oh, oh, you're so powerful.
[50:09.360 --> 50:10.360]  Why you kill these old people?
[50:10.360 --> 50:14.400]  You're such a big man, such a tough, tough guy.
[50:14.400 --> 50:15.400]  Don't worry, Cuomo.
[50:15.400 --> 50:19.080]  I won't get between you and what God's going to do to you, buddy boy.
[50:19.080 --> 50:20.080]  Vengeance is mine.
[50:20.080 --> 50:28.040]  I'll be at the Lord Oh, Cuomo looks still defends policy of filling nursing homes with coronavirus
[50:28.040 --> 50:29.040]  patients.
[50:29.040 --> 50:31.240]  He ordered them to do it.
[50:31.240 --> 50:32.240]  And it's in the news today.
[50:32.240 --> 50:37.840]  He signed a new executive order yesterday saying you're all criminals and I'm going to hold
[50:37.840 --> 50:42.440]  you criminally responsible and take your licenses.
[50:42.440 --> 50:43.440]  We got to find the clip.
[50:43.440 --> 50:44.440]  I saw a month ago.
[50:44.440 --> 50:51.680]  I'm not going to have these selfish people that run these refuse these patients for your
[50:51.680 --> 50:56.120]  for the empty hospitals.
[50:56.120 --> 51:01.280]  Remember they sent a symptomatic people that had the virus these damn places.
[51:01.280 --> 51:02.280]  That's cold.
[51:02.280 --> 51:04.560]  That's like loading the gun up, walking in and shooting all people in the head.
[51:04.560 --> 51:10.160]  I mean, it took more planning than to actually plan going in and killing with a gun.
[51:10.160 --> 51:14.920]  Man, I tell you, imagine dying with that damn thing, snake down your lungs and these crazy
[51:14.920 --> 51:15.920]  people running at all.
[51:15.920 --> 51:16.920]  I mean, my God.
[51:16.920 --> 51:18.640]  And then your family can't even come in and see you.
[51:18.640 --> 51:20.640]  So they even take care of the patients.
[51:20.640 --> 51:23.760]  Now, reportedly just leaving them piles of feces now.
[51:23.760 --> 51:26.600]  It's just all a big exercise to see what they can get away with.
[51:26.600 --> 51:27.600]  Cuomo still defends it.
[51:27.600 --> 51:28.600]  Yeah.
[51:28.600 --> 51:32.240]  New York Governor Cuomo reportedly ordered over 4,000 recovering COVID-19 patients to
[51:32.240 --> 51:34.080]  be sent to nursing homes.
[51:34.080 --> 51:38.840]  This is insider hospital said hundreds of COVID-19 patients nursing homes rehabs at
[51:38.840 --> 51:40.520]  peak of pandemic.
[51:40.520 --> 51:44.680]  Governor takes action on COVID-19 threatens Michigan's long-term care facilities.
[51:44.680 --> 51:48.720]  She orders them in and now she says, I'm going to arrest you for all the dead.
[51:48.720 --> 51:53.400]  Gotta love that man, gotta love it.
[51:53.400 --> 51:58.640]  Nursing homes, epicenter of COVID-19.
[51:58.640 --> 52:02.640]  And it goes on and on and on.
[52:02.640 --> 52:08.480]  But see, now she's starting the criminal prosecution of the nursing homes because there
[52:08.480 --> 52:09.480]  all be indicted.
[52:09.480 --> 52:10.480]  Now they can't go.
[52:10.480 --> 52:15.080]  Hey, you told us, see, they'll all just piss themselves and change the subject.
[52:15.080 --> 52:18.480]  No, it's the, they ordered you to, and you shouldn't have followed the orders.
[52:18.480 --> 52:20.000]  The Nuremberg defense is true.
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.560]  So I agree.
[52:21.560 --> 52:26.440]  You should get a few years in jail for not letting the families in and letting them bring
[52:26.440 --> 52:30.000]  in people that had COVID-19 and letting them kill people when the doctors and nurses knew
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  it was a death sentence.
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.000]  You should probably get 5, 10 years in prison apiece, the decision makers over those facilities,
[52:35.000 --> 52:41.000]  the medical deciders, but the people that ordered you to do it, I mean, I really think
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.000]  the death penalty is in order.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.440]  I'm not going to kill anybody.
[52:43.440 --> 52:47.640]  But I mean, if justice was done, they'd be indicted, there'd be a Nuremberg trial and
[52:47.640 --> 52:52.120]  then we would march these folks up and hang their ass in public.
[52:52.120 --> 52:56.240]  I mean, that's what you do if in any free country that had Nazis like this, because
[52:56.240 --> 53:00.120]  if you look, you think Nazis were back in the 1940s, ladies and gentlemen, you just look
[53:00.120 --> 53:02.000]  at these four people right here on screen.
[53:02.000 --> 53:09.680]  North, Newsom, Whitmer, Cuomo, all guilty Nazis, crimes against humanity, period, done.
[53:09.680 --> 53:14.920]  And they're all like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the feds told us to, oh, I see.
[53:14.920 --> 53:18.960]  You mean, I tell you what, whoever wrote that policy, Fauci and all them slipping it under
[53:18.960 --> 53:22.720]  to set Trump a plater, yeah, let's have an investigation and let's have some hearings
[53:22.720 --> 53:23.720]  on that.
[53:23.720 --> 53:24.720]  Yeah.
[53:24.720 --> 53:25.720]  Let's march them all in there.
[53:25.720 --> 53:26.720]  And you know what?
[53:26.720 --> 53:28.520]  If Trump gave that order, then Trump needs to pay.
[53:28.520 --> 53:29.520]  You know what?
[53:29.520 --> 53:34.160]  You know, Trump didn't give that order.
[53:34.160 --> 53:37.600]  So you people are a bunch of filthy criminals.
[53:37.600 --> 53:41.240]  And so once you have George Soros write other media matters article about how I'm lying
[53:41.240 --> 53:44.840]  about the healthcare workers and I'm lying about the hospitals and I'm lying about them
[53:44.840 --> 53:49.320]  being empty and I'm lying about the nursing homes, I'm so proud that a Nazi collaborator
[53:49.320 --> 53:53.160]  still alive and runs an operation, try to destroy me.
[53:53.160 --> 53:54.400]  That's the crazy thing about it.
[53:54.400 --> 53:58.120]  I never thought of myself as some hero, like a COVID person or whatever.
[53:58.120 --> 54:03.720]  But you know, it's weird, it's like a delicacy that like my grandfather's most almost died
[54:03.720 --> 54:04.720]  fighting Nazis.
[54:04.720 --> 54:06.920]  I almost don't exist because of Nazis.
[54:06.920 --> 54:12.600]  And then here I am actually fighting a real Bonafidi Nazi.
[54:12.600 --> 54:14.600]  Wow.
[54:14.600 --> 54:17.640]  Can't make that up, ladies and gentlemen, and you're fighting them too.
[54:17.640 --> 54:22.120]  And they're all trying to set the precedent to kill whoever they want, whenever they want.
[54:22.120 --> 54:24.040]  And to get everybody corrupted by following the orders.
[54:24.040 --> 54:26.800]  This is the corruption of the healthcare system to now do whatever they're told because I
[54:26.800 --> 54:30.600]  told you months ago, once they carry out these crimes in the hospitals and nursing homes,
[54:30.600 --> 54:35.720]  now they're going to come in with the state, Soros run prosecutors and totally take over
[54:35.720 --> 54:36.720]  everything.
[54:36.720 --> 54:41.040]  And remember, Hillary's company with Chelsea runs the contact tracing apps.
[54:41.040 --> 54:45.040]  Oh, they've got a plan.
[54:45.040 --> 54:47.280]  This is the end, my friends.
[54:47.280 --> 54:53.600]  My only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of everything that stands, the end
[54:53.600 --> 54:57.840]  of everything that stands, the safety, the delusion.
[54:57.840 --> 55:03.960]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because there was only the mirage of safety in movies
[55:03.960 --> 55:09.640]  and partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other people.
[55:09.640 --> 55:14.720]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny, just like the history book show is just like
[55:14.720 --> 55:16.240]  the Bible states.
[55:16.240 --> 55:20.480]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought
[55:20.480 --> 55:26.240]  into captivity because their people sold out to special interest and were infiltrated
[55:26.240 --> 55:29.240]  by spies and then they were enslaved.
[55:29.240 --> 55:34.920]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[55:34.920 --> 55:37.400]  absolute bondage.
[55:37.400 --> 55:40.080]  Info wars has decided to fight for freedom.
[55:40.080 --> 55:46.080]  Info wars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[55:46.080 --> 55:52.080]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[55:52.080 --> 55:58.040]  We will not have this sale that's going on right now in May until our Christmas sale
[55:58.040 --> 55:59.360]  comes up.
[55:59.360 --> 56:06.080]  All of our best selling supplements are 30 to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[56:06.080 --> 56:08.240]  Let me just hone in on one of the products.
[56:08.240 --> 56:10.240]  DNA Force Plus.
[56:10.240 --> 56:15.400]  It's got high quality PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known
[56:15.400 --> 56:17.840]  to supercharge the effects of that.
[56:17.840 --> 56:23.400]  Learn what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you no matter how old you are, no matter what color
[56:23.400 --> 56:28.200]  you are, no matter where you live in the world, it works the same on everybody.
[56:28.200 --> 56:30.760]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[56:30.760 --> 56:34.160]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[56:34.160 --> 56:37.960]  Doesn't make them grow, make some shrink, and slow them, which is basically the same
[56:37.960 --> 56:38.960]  thing.
[56:38.960 --> 56:48.520]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[56:48.520 --> 56:54.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:54.280 --> 57:01.040]  All right, folks.
[57:01.040 --> 57:02.040]  First hour was very important.
[57:02.040 --> 57:03.040]  I hope you share it with everybody.
[57:03.040 --> 57:06.840]  As soon as this positive end of video is critical, it's not just more old people getting killed,
[57:06.840 --> 57:09.160]  all of us, this is beyond critical.
[57:09.160 --> 57:10.160]  It's key.
[57:10.160 --> 57:11.160]  Please.
[57:11.160 --> 57:15.720]  I'm going to come back to the next segment and hit a bunch of stuff, but look at what
[57:15.720 --> 57:16.720]  Trump's done.
[57:16.720 --> 57:17.720]  It's not about defending Trump.
[57:17.720 --> 57:18.840]  I must promote the truth.
[57:18.840 --> 57:22.920]  He really has done, with Patriots, a great job turning the VA around massively.
[57:22.920 --> 57:25.400]  It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
[57:25.400 --> 57:26.400]  Here's the report.
[57:26.400 --> 57:31.240]  I was just watching Trump before he went live about 10 minutes ago reminding us what a great
[57:31.240 --> 57:35.240]  job he's done with the rest of the folks in government that wanted to make the VA better
[57:35.240 --> 57:39.160]  from one of the worst agencies to really turning it around in three years.
[57:39.160 --> 57:43.640]  Family tells us on the last day of his life, Hager took a trip to the VA walk-in clinic
[57:43.640 --> 57:44.640]  to get help.
[57:44.640 --> 57:48.720]  But instead of seeing a counselor, Hager was told to simply give his guns to a family
[57:48.720 --> 57:53.240]  member and come back for a follow-up after more than a month.
[57:53.240 --> 57:55.760]  He went home that night and shot himself in the head.
[57:55.760 --> 58:01.360]  We unveiled indictments against 15 South Florida residents.
[58:01.360 --> 58:07.880]  Those 15 residents were charged with fraud, kickback schemes and corruption schemes all
[58:07.880 --> 58:17.160]  carried out at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Miami and here in West Palm Beach.
[58:17.160 --> 58:22.960]  Dory Stafford says this letter obtained by CBS News shows how badly the VA claims system
[58:22.960 --> 58:23.960]  is broken.
[58:23.960 --> 58:30.840]  It's dated July 29, 2014, thanking Dory's husband Wayne, an Army veteran, for the disability
[58:30.840 --> 58:34.400]  claim he filed in July of 2004.
[58:34.400 --> 58:36.920]  That decade-long delay is just one problem.
[58:36.920 --> 58:41.560]  The other is that Wayne Stafford died in an accident seven years ago without hearing a
[58:41.560 --> 58:43.200]  word from the VA.
[58:43.200 --> 58:45.600]  And now this, does this upset you?
[58:45.600 --> 58:46.840]  It upsets me.
[58:46.840 --> 58:53.800]  The epicenter of the scandal, Phoenix, Arizona, where as many as 40 veterans died at this
[58:53.800 --> 58:58.520]  VA hospital while waiting up to 21 months to see a doctor.
[58:58.520 --> 59:03.480]  This is the VA's new medical center just east of Denver, a sprawling complex.
[59:03.480 --> 59:07.880]  Its ballooning costs have made it the most expensive ever.
[59:07.880 --> 59:12.880]  Design, construction and management issues blew up the budget from $328 million in the
[59:12.880 --> 59:18.280]  initial prospectus in 2004 to almost $2 billion as of today.
[59:18.280 --> 59:21.160]  It's opening delayed repeatedly.
[59:21.160 --> 59:26.320]  Government documents reveal blatant mismanagement, showing the VA gave the contractor incomplete
[59:26.320 --> 59:30.640]  designs and never came close to one that could be built for the budgeted amount.
[59:30.640 --> 59:32.000]  I've talked to a lot of vets.
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.480]  They say it's gone from nightmare to working pretty good.
[59:34.480 --> 59:37.240]  They can also see private doctors if the VA doesn't step up.
[59:37.240 --> 59:41.440]  I mean, this is one of our great accomplishments getting Trump elected and people inside the
[59:41.440 --> 59:45.520]  VA working hard against the bureaucracy because the globalists hate our vets.
[59:45.520 --> 59:48.680]  So Memorial Day coming up, I just want to talk about something positive Trump's done.
[59:48.680 --> 59:49.680]  Here he is.
[59:49.680 --> 59:55.760]  We passed the largest reform of the Department of Veterans Affairs in the, I think in the
[59:55.760 --> 1:00:03.680]  history of the Department, including VA accountability, and I said VA choice, we've removed 8,500 VA
[1:00:03.680 --> 1:00:08.760]  workers who weren't doing their job, who were taking advantage of our country and hurting
[1:00:08.760 --> 1:00:10.160]  our vets.
[1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:14.880]  The percentage of veterans reporting, they trust services.
[1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:15.960]  Think of that.
[1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:17.360]  They trust services.
[1:00:17.360 --> 1:00:23.840]  So they report and they say they trust services has reached the highest in the history of
[1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:24.840]  the VA.
[1:00:24.840 --> 1:00:26.160]  That's a big statement.
[1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:32.800]  So the percentage of veterans reporting that they trust the VA and the VA services is now
[1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:35.760]  the highest in the history of the service.
[1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:42.080]  Satisfaction with the VA outpatient care has reached 89 percent and we're not going to
[1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:44.760]  rest until we have it at 100 percent.
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:49.600]  Remember a year ago in Miami and places they wouldn't take down Obama's picture.
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:52.600]  I'm happy to be able to get these hung up.
[1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:58.160]  We always say in the Army, right, nothing takes five minutes.
[1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:03.000]  But shortly after those pictures were taken down after they were put up, they were deemed
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  inappropriate.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  You believe that?
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:09.440]  Well, when I walked in the door, there was where the previous picture of Barack Obama
[1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:14.360]  was, there was just a blank wall and I was really kind of surprised and I walked up to
[1:01:14.360 --> 1:01:17.640]  the information desk and I asked them, I said, well, what's going on?
[1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:20.400]  I said, where's the picture of the commander in chief?
[1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:22.800]  And the guy kind of leans over to me like it was a secret or something.
[1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:25.200]  He says, well, he says they're telling us that it was a typo.
[1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:26.360]  I was like, what?
[1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:30.560]  So years into Trump's presidency, the bureaucrats running it were so evil they wouldn't even
[1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:31.560]  put up the president's picture.
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:33.880]  Well, they had their asses fired.
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:35.880]  This is a model for the rest of the government.
[1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:46.520]  All right, when we come back, some big moves Trump's launched against the globalists in
[1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:52.840]  the deep state, stay with us.
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:58.640]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot
[1:01:58.640 --> 1:02:03.680]  an elk at, say, 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:07.720]  50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards.
[1:02:07.720 --> 1:02:12.280]  They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins, but
[1:02:12.280 --> 1:02:17.640]  all of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over and they die.
[1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:20.720]  Then you go back and haul them back in.
[1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:24.120]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:30.520]  And that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:35.120]  and for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:38.560]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:40.080]  to the UN and I believe their numbers.
[1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:45.320]  Because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world.
[1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:48.480]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're
[1:02:48.480 --> 1:03:18.320]  a bunch of suckers and you bought into something better than what Hitler did.
[1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:27.000]  We are back live, my friends, thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday global
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  transmission.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  We belong.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  We belong to the republic.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  And we can talk about that all day, what that really means.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:45.800]  But if you don't belong to something, well, do you belong to anything?
[1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:49.520]  You belong to whatever people controlling you say you belong to.
[1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:55.800]  Well, I believe in we the people, we the people aren't perfect or a lot better than we the
[1:03:55.800 --> 1:03:56.800]  psychotics.
[1:03:56.800 --> 1:04:00.960]  All right, let me give you a smattering here of the other news we're going to cover.
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:06.560]  I don't usually cover first hour only one story, but if you just joined us, it's open
[1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:11.360]  and shut that the Democrats in the deep state wanted higher COVID-19 numbers and the blue
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:16.080]  cities, the blue states with the UN with the chai comms unify their policies of putting
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:22.240]  asymptomatic COVID-19 patients that didn't even have fevers, but we're spreading it into
[1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:24.240]  nursing homes.
[1:04:24.240 --> 1:04:26.080]  And that's like shooting fish in a barrel.
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:31.360]  That's so premeditated that that a first year nursing student would tell you that's
[1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:32.360]  illegal.
[1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:33.720]  A doctor knows damn well 100%.
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:38.720]  Again, this is like saying it's illegal to have sex with a newborn baby.
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:41.880]  I mean, everybody knows that's evil and who would want to do it anyways.
[1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:48.040]  The point is, but there's this authority figure moment where, well, they keep babies alive
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:49.040]  and sell their organs.
[1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:52.600]  We keep them comfortable though, till we take their organs, so it's okay.
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:58.500]  Or oh yeah, we have convicted pedophiles come and teach drag queen pedophile time to kids.
[1:04:58.500 --> 1:05:05.280]  It's all about getting you to accept anything, pushing the envelope and I know you know that.
[1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:14.680]  But I got to tell you, the final nail in the coffin is them threatening now in Michigan,
[1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:21.760]  California, Pennsylvania and New York to indict and arrest the people that run the nursing
[1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:25.940]  homes who'd buck them and said, don't put COVID patients in here and they signed executive
[1:05:25.940 --> 1:05:27.840]  orders ordering.
[1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:30.080]  Think about the magnitude of that.
[1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:38.440]  I've never seen anything like this anywhere.
[1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:45.400]  And then the nursing homes, we ordered to parade the dead bodies out.
[1:05:45.400 --> 1:05:48.960]  And yeah, the people that took part in this that have medical degrees are all accomplices
[1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:52.480]  to premeditated murder.
[1:05:52.480 --> 1:05:57.200]  So I just spent the whole first hour on that and I'm having trouble getting off of it.
[1:05:57.200 --> 1:06:05.040]  I have had an instinct to go physically to these places and I know you're all having
[1:06:05.040 --> 1:06:06.040]  that instinct as well.
[1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:09.040]  That's a normal instinct when they're killing the most defenseless people you've been.
[1:06:09.040 --> 1:06:12.200]  I mean there's something wrong when you're not pissed off.
[1:06:12.200 --> 1:06:19.880]  But imagine those that love it, they love the power to kill an unborn baby or to kill
[1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:25.760]  a baby after it's born or to kill an old person, that power over them.
[1:06:25.760 --> 1:06:29.920]  I always wonder why out of events, Antifa will attack an old lady or, oh my gosh, if
[1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:35.240]  somebody's on a walker or a wheelchair, they've got to be guarded.
[1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:40.520]  And I'm like, what planet does a paramilitary force target women and children and people
[1:06:40.520 --> 1:06:41.520]  in wheelchairs?
[1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:44.720]  See, because those of us that aren't like that, like if I was going to get into five
[1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:48.400]  people, and I'm not sitting around saying the biggest stuff is going around, but I got
[1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:49.400]  my heads going straight.
[1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:53.640]  I look for the biggest, meanest one and I jump on top of them, ram their head in the ground
[1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:55.320]  until all the others got scared.
[1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:58.640]  I just picked the biggest meanest one and I'd beat his ass right there like David Goliath
[1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:00.160]  or I'd die trying.
[1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:05.480]  These people scan the scene and they see an old lady or a baby or an old man on crutches.
[1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:11.200]  They want to get them because they're scum.
[1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:18.800]  They are fundamentally absolutely evil.
[1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:20.080]  And that's the nature of evil.
[1:07:20.080 --> 1:07:24.120]  Is it when you see a baby or you see an old person, you get this instinct that you want
[1:07:24.120 --> 1:07:30.000]  to do something mean to him?
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:32.080]  It's called being a predator.
[1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:37.360]  You know a wolf can look out over a field and look at us say a hundred sheep, but it
[1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:40.640]  sees that one with a broken back leg.
[1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:45.000]  And that's the one it can get with the shortest amount of energy.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  It's just trying to get food.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:52.200]  It's not like these globalist, a wolf is a holy creature compared to them.
[1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:56.280]  It's just going after what's easiest for it to get.
[1:07:56.280 --> 1:08:02.520]  But with these globalists, they're going after it because it makes them feel powerful to rub
[1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:08.320]  it in and hold somebody weak down because they're so intrinsically weak, they're projecting
[1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:10.520]  their weakness onto that target.
[1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:15.040]  They see weakness in that baby, in that old man or woman or in that Down syndrome or that
[1:08:15.040 --> 1:08:16.200]  quadriplegic.
[1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:28.360]  And so they want to come in as the pure, big, strong, get rid of you because I'm so powerful.
[1:08:28.360 --> 1:08:32.640]  It's the degeneracy of it because you see, they're already so caught off from God, they're
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:40.080]  already so caught off from honor that they don't even know what the animating contest
[1:08:40.080 --> 1:08:42.960]  of liberty is.
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:46.760]  They don't know how high you get when somebody bigger and meaner than you've taken you on
[1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:49.280]  and you get it on with them.
[1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:54.120]  To them though, it's the power of rubbing it in to some little person on a walker.
[1:08:54.120 --> 1:09:00.400]  And until you've wrapped your mind around the weakness of these people, the total commitment,
[1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:04.600]  then you understand why they want rats and feces and homeless and mental illness and
[1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:10.200]  collapse because they're sick.
[1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:14.000]  Stop trying to placate them, stop trying to get them to leave you alone, stop trying
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:20.920]  to get them to be nice, everything you give them only wants them more to destroy you.
[1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:26.000]  That's why the allegory that came out in the last 100 years or so of a zombie that was
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:30.560]  based on old African lore and old European lore, every culture had the lore of a zombie.
[1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:35.360]  It means a brain dead crazy person that's out of their mind that will eat flesh because
[1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:44.120]  psychos get like that, so we get the legends of zombies.
[1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:46.560]  And that's what they are.
[1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:47.720]  And what does a zombie want?
[1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:51.000]  It wants brains.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.240]  Why does it want brains?
[1:09:52.240 --> 1:09:55.200]  Because it doesn't have brains.
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:57.400]  It's an allegory.
[1:09:57.400 --> 1:10:02.720]  You got brains, you got a husband, you got a wife, you got a life, you got a church, you
[1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:03.720]  love God.
[1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:07.720]  It's not perfect, but you believe in humanity and you got a connection to God and man, these
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:10.960]  zombies see that and they don't like it.
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:17.520]  And all they want to do is hold you down and bite big chunks out of you.
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:23.040]  So I ask everybody again, do you think you can make a deal with a zombie?
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:25.560]  You think you can throw it some meat that's going to go away?
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:26.560]  No.
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:28.640]  You throw a zombie meat over your fence.
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:32.360]  It's going to climb that fence because it knows where the meat came from.
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:39.440]  And so placating and kissing all these people's butts has to end.
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:44.960]  So I'm not going to do anything violent to Governor Whitmar or Governor Newsom or Governor
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:48.360]  Cuomo or Governor Wolf.
[1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:52.800]  I'm just going to sit here like a good cowardly American and watch them kill everybody in
[1:10:52.800 --> 1:11:00.280]  the nursing homes because I'm a good American.
[1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:04.160]  I sit there and I take it and I let them kill all people because I'm a coward.
[1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:08.200]  No, seriously, folks, it would turn them into martyrs.
[1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:12.840]  So the last thing we want is a little hair on American Psycho's head to be harmed.
[1:11:12.840 --> 1:11:14.600]  We need to destroy his name.
[1:11:14.600 --> 1:11:20.080]  We need to expose what a monstrous sack of garbage he is and we need to expose all these
[1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:23.320]  monsters and we need them to be indicted.
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:28.160]  We need this idea of, oh, they're a power figure or oh, some medical board told them
[1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:34.600]  or oh, and Trump needs to burn Fauci because the left set him up on this.
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:38.800]  Oh, see, now they're removing their executive order saying they never said it because they're
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.360]  now saying Trump killed the people in the nursing homes and they're going to go find
[1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:45.600]  Democrat members of their family that are dumb enough to think Trump actually did it
[1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:53.760]  and they're going to be all over the news that Trump killed the old people.
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:56.080]  And so see, Trump, you have to destroy Fauci.
[1:11:56.080 --> 1:11:59.160]  You have to destroy the chai comms politically.
[1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:04.240]  We have to because here's the thing, I'm not somebody looking for war, but when somebody
[1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:11.160]  comes to me and attacks me, well, I'm not delusional, I'm going to fight back and they're
[1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:14.280]  the ones that brought us to this climate where they've killed 50 something thousand
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:18.640]  old people on purpose all by design and okay, I'm going to stop.
[1:12:18.640 --> 1:12:22.400]  We got some good news on declassifications of the new director of national intelligence.
[1:12:22.400 --> 1:12:25.360]  Definitely came out of the gates on fire.
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:28.280]  Big news about Bill Gates caught being involved profiteering off COVID-19.
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:30.680]  I know that's like telling you that crap stinks.
[1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:35.760]  Oh, the sky's blue and a bunch of clips and a bunch of insanity and a bunch of craziness
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:38.320]  and just it's all coming up today.
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:41.320]  Remember this is not a spectator sport.
[1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:46.120]  This is total warfare for your body, your mind, your future, your dignity and your soul.
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:52.320]  So spread the word about info wars or submit the total destruction.
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:54.920]  The United States is not communist China.
[1:12:54.920 --> 1:12:57.880]  We don't have three million people in concentration camps.
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:12:59.760]  We don't blow up churches.
[1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:02.960]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:09.200]  But all of the news, we see the U.N., billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:14.600]  raising communist China for their response and if communist China shoots women at checkpoints
[1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:18.920]  and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people, well, then gee,
[1:13:18.920 --> 1:13:19.920]  we've got to do that.
[1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:23.960]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio pass laws saying we'll arrest you if you say
[1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:24.960]  Chinese virus.
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:28.840]  Well, now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:34.040]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because
[1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:38.240]  we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their power
[1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:39.240]  grab.
[1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:43.440]  The resistance lives at band.video and infowars.com.
[1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:47.480]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors, throats, and then we'll be able to defeat
[1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:51.520]  their operation that much quicker.
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:56.560]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporate media and the chai comms
[1:13:56.560 --> 1:14:00.280]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:04.200]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third
[1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:05.200]  world.
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:10.640]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:11.640]  to be.
[1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:16.800]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:17.800]  economy.
[1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:21.800]  So we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:27.120]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:28.960]  They've admitted all of this.
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:35.040]  So remember, how does infowars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:39.960]  things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle
[1:14:39.960 --> 1:14:43.280]  plan and yes, it's dystopic and yes, it's scary.
[1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:47.440]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:58.160]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:24.160]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening and let them carry it out.
[1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:43.920]  All right, my friends, I have a lot of news I'm going to get to a lot of the important
[1:15:43.920 --> 1:15:50.360]  clips I want to cover, but I also want to take, let's just say six or seven phone calls
[1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:57.280]  that way people don't sit on hold, specifically from anybody that's lost family in these nursing
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:03.960]  homes or worked in nursing homes, anybody in the states where they were ordered to take
[1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:08.960]  on the COVID-19 patients knowing that was a total death sentence for those around it.
[1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:10.960]  Remember, you're not supposed to get within six feet of people.
[1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:11.960]  You're supposed to stay in your house.
[1:16:11.960 --> 1:16:14.280]  We're supposed to have a worldwide depression.
[1:16:14.280 --> 1:16:18.480]  This is so deadly, but then we're going to send infected people to the most susceptible
[1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:22.520]  group out there that now is over half the deaths in the United States.
[1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:26.440]  The whopper levelness of this, it was all preplanned.
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:27.440]  We know it was.
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:30.640]  They admit it was and now they're going to blame Trump for it.
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:32.760]  The media is now engaging in that.
[1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:33.760]  Forget Trump.
[1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:34.760]  Forget Alex Jones.
[1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:35.760]  Forget you individually.
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:38.120]  What about everybody with these criminals and what they're doing?
[1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:48.160]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALAX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:53.120]  I don't get up here and say people like Cuomo need to be indicted for premeditated mass
[1:16:53.120 --> 1:16:56.320]  murder, and then if he's found guilty, he needs to be given the death penalty.
[1:16:56.320 --> 1:16:58.920]  I don't get up here to act tough and do that.
[1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:02.560]  The governor has tried to get the Attorney General of New York to indict me.
[1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:08.480]  She said they want to indict me, and then she lied that I said I had a cure for COVID-19.
[1:17:08.480 --> 1:17:09.480]  I said, crap.
[1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:12.880]  No, I've been selling silver products for years and they're all known topically what
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:13.880]  they do.
[1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:18.480]  They do it with curing or treating it, but if those criminals want to indict me, knock
[1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:24.040]  yourselves out, man, because it's all about what you did in the nursing homes, dirt bags,
[1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:30.920]  and your very health department, you're trying to have prosecute me right now, destroying
[1:17:30.920 --> 1:17:41.400]  the executive order that's a federal and state crime, Leticia James.
[1:17:41.400 --> 1:17:46.440]  They're the ones that ordered the executioners, the COVID patients to be sent to the nursing
[1:17:46.440 --> 1:17:54.560]  homes, where they have fertile ground to kill, cold-blooded murderers, maybe Leticia James
[1:17:54.560 --> 1:17:55.560]  is just stupid.
[1:17:55.560 --> 1:18:00.800]  Okay, it's a manslaughter, lady, but I want to know who was in command of this.
[1:18:00.800 --> 1:18:04.560]  Oh, you say Fauci, the one that doesn't like Trump, the one that works for Bill Gates.
[1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:05.560]  So I get it.
[1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:08.320]  It's Bill Gates, isn't it?
[1:18:08.320 --> 1:18:11.960]  This is where the buck stops, doesn't it, really?
[1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:13.160]  Need more childhood death?
[1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:14.160]  That guy?
[1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:16.560]  We need death panels, get rid of old people?
[1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:17.560]  That guy?
[1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:21.520]  Oh, the guy that said we got to get rid of old people?
[1:18:21.520 --> 1:18:24.080]  Case for killing, Granny?
[1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:25.080]  Surprise, surprise.
[1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:26.320]  He told us what he wants.
[1:18:26.320 --> 1:18:28.560]  Big article up on him, FullWars.com.
[1:18:28.560 --> 1:18:32.760]  Another Gates vaccine bites the dust.
[1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:39.120]  There's another big article out on Gates, is that big brother behind the medical mask,
[1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:44.080]  Bill Gates, to co-fund South Korean Research on next-gen quarantine methods.
[1:18:44.080 --> 1:18:52.640]  He's going to decide, the psychopath, how to lock us all up.
[1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:58.480]  If we don't give the old people a hint, do a good Bill Gates invitation, if the patient
[1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:03.360]  isn't given treatment, we can hire 10 teachers, but that's a death panel, and we can't talk
[1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:07.480]  about that, he, he, he, he, he, he.
[1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:14.600]  We've got all those reports as well, but I want to hit the big, big top drudge link
[1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:15.600]  earlier.
[1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:19.520]  I don't know if it's still there, but Trump says he'll shut down social media.
[1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:22.920]  Well, what they've done is shut down free speech in this country and spy on folks in
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:23.920]  bulletin.
[1:19:23.920 --> 1:19:25.920]  What he really said is he's going to shut them down for the censorship.
[1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:30.920]  He means the censorship, but as scary as it is, Trump shutting down media, well, they're
[1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:32.400]  shutting all of us down.
[1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:34.240]  I mean, they started the fight.
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:37.880]  It's a very dangerous, slippery slope, but we're already down the slope, aren't we?
[1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:39.280]  But he doesn't need to do that.
[1:19:39.280 --> 1:19:41.560]  He needs to go after them for their insider trading.
[1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:45.000]  There's so many ways to get them.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  Trump vows this.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  Close down Twitter.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:52.160]  We've got a drudge link story today that I haven't gotten to.
[1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:58.320]  COVID pass, UK introduces digital health passport to monitor travel health population.
[1:19:58.320 --> 1:19:59.320]  That's coming up too.
[1:19:59.320 --> 1:20:04.160]  But let me do this because our fabulous crew reminded me, they said, Jones, you've not
[1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:07.600]  been plugging lately and well, there's no money coming in to fund the operation.
[1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:08.600]  That's not good.
[1:20:08.600 --> 1:20:11.960]  The hotter the show, the less I'm plugging.
[1:20:11.960 --> 1:20:17.640]  Listen, I had my lawyer on the phone, my family lawyer, really nice guy, smart guy this morning.
[1:20:17.640 --> 1:20:23.560]  He said, so you really, his mother's in a nutritionist retired.
[1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:27.160]  He goes, so you are taking your zinc and taking your vitamin D three and taking all this.
[1:20:27.160 --> 1:20:31.480]  And I said, yeah, on a regular basis because they're called essential.
[1:20:31.480 --> 1:20:38.520]  You know, the media's like, Jones claim he's got a COVID-19 cure selling zinc pills that
[1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:39.520]  I've been selling for years.
[1:20:39.520 --> 1:20:41.680]  No, it's not a cure.
[1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:43.880]  Oxygen is not a cure for asphyxiation.
[1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:44.880]  You just asphyxiate it.
[1:20:44.880 --> 1:20:45.880]  You don't have it.
[1:20:45.880 --> 1:20:48.600]  Somebody already hung you because you're a trader.
[1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:52.120]  Well, the oxygen is not going to help because your brain's dead.
[1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:55.680]  But they play these little games like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you say, you say your
[1:20:55.680 --> 1:21:00.160]  crude oil has D three in it, because they play on the ignorance of the public.
[1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:08.680]  Folks, I take D three because it makes me have more virility than when I was 16 years old.
[1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:13.880]  I take X two because it makes me younger and stronger.
[1:21:13.880 --> 1:21:17.000]  And of course, it's essential and it's pure.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:22.560]  I take turbo force when I got to go to a rally or do some event and I'm already exhausted
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:23.560]  or you work 10 hours.
[1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:26.440]  And I have trouble going to sleep and wish I didn't take it.
[1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:27.440]  It's too strong.
[1:21:27.440 --> 1:21:29.440]  It's the strongest clean 10-hour energy you're going to find.
[1:21:29.440 --> 1:21:31.760]  That's what it's formulated for.
[1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:35.120]  The big sale of last week, a lot of stuff sold out, so it had to partially end, but we have
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:37.880]  the Memorial Day special that's extended, but not much longer.
[1:21:37.880 --> 1:21:38.880]  I've just been so busy.
[1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:39.880]  I haven't come up with new specials.
[1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:41.840]  This is the biggest special of the year so far.
[1:21:41.840 --> 1:21:42.840]  Take advantage of it.
[1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:46.440]  Supermelt vitality is amazing, 40% off.
[1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:47.440]  Knockout is incredible.
[1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:48.440]  Sleep aid.
[1:21:48.440 --> 1:21:50.680]  I designed that 50% off.

[1:22:07.760 --> 1:22:08.760]  Me.
[1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:09.760]  It's from the mustard seeds.

[1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:11.760]  Strongest one out there.

[1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:28.160]  Anyways, bio true selenium.

[1:22:42.160 --> 1:22:44.000]  Three different great scents.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.240]  Also the essential oils.
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:46.240]  A packed power stack.

[1:22:52.920 --> 1:22:54.360]  They're right up there at the top together.
[1:22:54.360 --> 1:22:56.000]  I can't decide which one's better.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.080]  They just did both too good.
[1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:00.200]  Living defense plus 50% off.
[1:23:00.200 --> 1:23:01.200]  Limited edition.
[1:23:01.200 --> 1:23:02.200]  Info wars.
[1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:03.200]  Face mask.
[1:23:03.200 --> 1:23:04.200]  9.95.
[1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:05.200]  If you got to do the whole clown dance.
[1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:06.200]  We'll get the word out while you're at it.
[1:23:06.200 --> 1:23:07.200]  Turbo force 40% off.
[1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:08.200]  Tri-Eye Dye's going to sell out soon.
[1:23:08.200 --> 1:23:11.320]  A red pill, a red pill plus, about to sell out.
[1:23:11.320 --> 1:23:12.320]  Bazo beats 40% off.
[1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:13.320]  It's all there.
[1:23:13.320 --> 1:23:14.320]  Now completely sold out.
[1:23:14.320 --> 1:23:15.320]  Polymobloc.
[1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:16.320]  Vitamins.
[1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:17.320]  Fusion.
[1:23:17.320 --> 1:23:18.320]  Bodies.
[1:23:18.320 --> 1:23:19.320]  And Ultra 12.
[1:23:19.320 --> 1:23:20.320]  And a bunch of other stuff is about to sell out as well.
[1:23:20.320 --> 1:23:22.840]  And again, you need water.
[1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:25.800]  You need air to live.
[1:23:25.800 --> 1:23:26.800]  You need food.
[1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:27.800]  What's in food?
[1:23:27.800 --> 1:23:28.800]  Vitamins and minerals.
[1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:32.640]  If you can get concentrated, high quality versions of those key elements.
[1:23:32.640 --> 1:23:36.280]  That's what you do at infowarsore.com and it funds the info war.
[1:23:36.280 --> 1:23:38.400]  These are the highest quality supplements out there.
[1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:41.840]  If that was selling hot air, it'd be okay because you're funding the info war that's
[1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:43.080]  delivering victory and truth.
[1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:45.800]  By the way, a lot of great t-shirts at infowarsore.com too.
[1:23:45.800 --> 1:23:49.800]  Oh yeah, wear your colors proud in the third dimension, dimension, dimension.
[1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:53.960]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world
[1:23:53.960 --> 1:23:56.540]  economy to where it is.
[1:23:56.540 --> 1:24:02.320]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months,
[1:24:02.320 --> 1:24:07.040]  there's going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse
[1:24:07.040 --> 1:24:08.440]  for the first world.
[1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:11.840]  And that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt to the mega banks.
[1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:17.880]  They're not going to have medical ID cards, force inoculations, we are now in a giant
[1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:18.880]  dystopia.
[1:24:18.880 --> 1:24:25.200]  But a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking place against this
[1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:26.200]  tyranny.
[1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:31.120]  And we must all rediscover our bill of rights, rediscover our constitution and our backbone
[1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:36.160]  and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say, shut your business
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:38.480]  down, shut your life down, it'll save lives.
[1:24:38.480 --> 1:24:43.080]  No, it's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:46.480]  So the cowards who went along with this with your virtue signaling, you have destroyed
[1:24:46.480 --> 1:24:48.480]  your lives and our lives.
[1:24:48.480 --> 1:24:49.640]  Congratulations.
[1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:52.760]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[1:24:52.760 --> 1:24:59.280]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights, being suspended
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:05.640]  and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill of the Linda Gates Foundation
[1:25:05.640 --> 1:25:07.640]  in full control.
[1:25:07.640 --> 1:25:13.320]  Many will submit through fear, others will be bought off, but in the end, the globalists
[1:25:13.320 --> 1:25:16.800]  admit they're building a post human world.
[1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:23.880]  And now that we're inside the cage, it's going to move very, very quickly into its end game.
[1:25:23.880 --> 1:25:29.440]  Going into this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:35.960]  own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:36.960]  this.
[1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:41.680]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being poured inside out.
[1:25:41.680 --> 1:25:47.080]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfless
[1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:49.400]  disgusting power trip.
[1:25:49.400 --> 1:25:53.600]  One of our best selling products is living defense and it's been sold out for over four
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:56.920]  months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[1:25:56.920 --> 1:26:00.120]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast and I want those of
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:03.120]  you that haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself.
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:04.520]  You're just part of one testimonial.
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:09.360]  I looked in January, 2016, I went in a hospital, I went in the VA hospital out here in Boyce
[1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:10.920]  and I was in there until June.
[1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:15.600]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:20.200]  hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Groob and all you guys talking about living defense.
[1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:24.680]  Let me tell you something, man, I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:28.320]  about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:29.520]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:33.080]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Groob and those commercials, I said,
[1:26:33.080 --> 1:26:34.080]  you know what?
[1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:35.520]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[1:26:35.520 --> 1:26:38.720]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff,
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:43.080]  but I ordered it, it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses, I started taking
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:44.080]  it, man.
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:45.400]  That stuff changed my life.
[1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:46.400]  It saved my life.
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:52.800]  Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[1:26:52.800 --> 1:27:12.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:24.000]  Welcome back, I am your host, Alex Jones, news wars.com, band on video and info wars.com
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:25.600]  or our flagship operations.
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:31.400]  When you carry the ball, plant the seed and be able to sunshine the rain all the same
[1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:32.400]  time.
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:37.600]  It changes the world and you see how close the fight is against the evil doers.
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:42.280]  Now their programs are being defeated as fast as they can launch them, but they always launch
[1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:43.280]  a new tyranny.
[1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:46.800]  That's the struggle against this evil system.
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:47.800]  Okay.
[1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:52.160]  So the big story today, I have said the big story for me is the premeditated murder at
[1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:56.360]  the nursing homes to have high COVID-19 numbers to make billions of dollars for blue states,
[1:27:56.360 --> 1:28:01.840]  50 plus thousand dollars per person that they said had COVID-19, just absolutely evil.
[1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:06.080]  And if Trump would move against them and expose them, it would really be a good thing and
[1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:10.440]  could just go ahead and say, hey, Fauci was a holdover from Obama.
[1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:13.160]  I didn't imagine that doctors will be political.
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:20.280]  Turns out they are, and I'm calling for Fauci's criminal investigation, but don't hold your
[1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:21.480]  breath for that.
[1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:25.920]  But now Trump's going to have to because they're coming after him saying it's his fault, which
[1:28:25.920 --> 1:28:26.920]  I said months ago.
[1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:30.160]  I said, watch after they kill a bunch of people in these hospitals, it's over half of this.
[1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:31.400]  They're going to say it's Trump's fault.
[1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:35.520]  And because Fauci is in there and you can say, well, as long as Fauci is in there, putting
[1:28:35.520 --> 1:28:37.280]  out guidelines, that's Trump's fault.
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:41.200]  So it does, the buck does stop there in a sick way.
[1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:44.200]  But the premeditated folks going, oh, the boss doesn't know what's going on, what we
[1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:45.200]  do this.
[1:28:45.200 --> 1:28:47.840]  They're the ones that really committed the crime.
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:52.440]  Now, I wouldn't just trust Trump and all this, I hadn't seen him with the VA, how he's
[1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:58.840]  fought Fauci, how he's fought the mask, how he's fought the shutdown as best as he could.
[1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:04.920]  Trump threatens to close down social media platforms that silence conservatives as feud
[1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:11.680]  with Twitter ramps up and they have the fact checker that is a super ultra leftist who
[1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:15.160]  believes that the White House is run by Nazis and Trump is a Nazi.
[1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:19.040]  So they don't fact check him when he's saying that or Google puts out the Republican Party
[1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:23.960]  official affiliation as Nazis.
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:30.000]  And then the Washington Post is the fact totem.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:35.280]  That was the Washington Times, the New York Times, these are all listed fact checkers.
[1:29:35.280 --> 1:29:39.160]  Unsubstantiated claim, Twitter fact checks Trump on mail-in voting fraud.
[1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:43.560]  Yeah, you've had mail-in ballots around the world be totally fraud-ridden, but currently
[1:29:43.560 --> 1:29:49.520]  there's no proof that the 2020 election was stolen because it isn't happening for 159
[1:29:49.520 --> 1:29:50.520]  days.
[1:29:50.520 --> 1:29:52.120]  So technically it's unsubstantiated.
[1:29:52.120 --> 1:29:58.320]  It's like saying, there's a rattlesnake I saw crawling that hole, don't stick your
[1:29:58.320 --> 1:30:00.920]  hand down it, you're going to get bit.
[1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:06.240]  Maybe it's not hungry, maybe it's not scared, maybe it doesn't bite you.
[1:30:06.240 --> 1:30:09.040]  But as it does, it's unsubstantiated, don't stick your hand down that rattlesnake hole,
[1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:10.960]  you'll get bit.
[1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:17.880]  The Democrats all over are mailing out ballots, the governors are, to steal a federal election.
[1:30:17.880 --> 1:30:22.040]  And Trump's like, this is insane, look at all the angles they could scam with this.
[1:30:22.040 --> 1:30:25.760]  And their answer is, you are fake.
[1:30:25.760 --> 1:30:28.120]  You are a fraud.
[1:30:28.120 --> 1:30:30.360]  You are a scammer.
[1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:34.200]  You are a tyrant.
[1:30:34.200 --> 1:30:42.760]  And then the fact check is whatever mainstream media says Trump is wrong.
[1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:48.040]  Twitter slaps fact check censor on Trump tweet about rigged election, get the facts about
[1:30:48.040 --> 1:30:53.840]  mail-in ballots, why they're great, why they're wonderful, Gavin Newsom says so, head of site
[1:30:53.840 --> 1:31:03.040]  integrity at election security, Twitter thinks there are actual Nazis in the White House.
[1:31:03.040 --> 1:31:07.800]  Actual Nazis, not not George Soros, an actual Nazi collaborator on record that said it was
[1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:11.840]  the best time of his life, rounding up Jews, happy making time.
[1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:12.840]  Those are real quotes.
[1:31:12.840 --> 1:31:17.920]  No, no, no, no, no, it's Trump, the pro-Israel guy, he's a Nazi, and Stephen Miller and Jared
[1:31:17.920 --> 1:31:25.720]  Kushner, they're all in there, hiling Hitler all day.
[1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:28.440]  So what is Trump going to do?
[1:31:28.440 --> 1:31:33.280]  I mean, look, it's not about private companies can do what they want because they have liability
[1:31:33.280 --> 1:31:42.400]  protection, section 302 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Safe Harbor Act saying if you're
[1:31:42.400 --> 1:31:46.800]  a message board or a third party posting thing like Facebook, Twitter, you're not responsible
[1:31:46.800 --> 1:31:48.360]  as the owner for what they do.
[1:31:48.360 --> 1:31:52.080]  You can have your own rules, your own guidelines, your own whatever.
[1:31:52.080 --> 1:31:55.760]  But when you say you're an open free thing and then you go around with AI reading what
[1:31:55.760 --> 1:31:59.800]  people say and blocking them and shadow batting them and laughing about it and Google having
[1:31:59.800 --> 1:32:03.680]  video conferences with their top executive saying, we're going to make sure Trump loses
[1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:05.600]  next time.
[1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:09.640]  It's premeditated election meddling, but you can get them on insider trading, you can get
[1:32:09.640 --> 1:32:14.720]  them online to Congress, you can get them on the combining with all the big companies
[1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:18.840]  meeting, they even admit that the corporation's high-discipline view, oh, the top five all
[1:32:18.840 --> 1:32:23.600]  met at Twitter headquarters to decide how to take on Trump's lies.
[1:32:23.600 --> 1:32:27.880]  What you mean is all get together and how to bully everybody and block free speech.
[1:32:27.880 --> 1:32:32.080]  If Trump puts a video out of Michelle Malkin at a dinner talking about how she was censored,
[1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:36.680]  how it's wrong that they're banning conservatives out of banking and hotels and travel apps
[1:32:36.680 --> 1:32:40.000]  and how they're all working to blacklist people way worse than ever happened to the
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:43.360]  communists in the 50s and they're like, oh, this is wonderful now.
[1:32:43.360 --> 1:32:52.160]  Trump can be like, this is what people like McCarthy could only dream of, this is a thousand
[1:32:52.160 --> 1:32:59.160]  times McCarthy, go after them, put injunctions on them.
[1:32:59.160 --> 1:33:02.720]  Trump could announce, they got off the shelf Twitter systems, he can announce a new Twitter,
[1:33:02.720 --> 1:33:03.720]  just fight.
[1:33:03.720 --> 1:33:08.800]  With 159 days left, you cannot sit there and take this crap anymore.
[1:33:08.800 --> 1:33:10.800]  It's Trump's greatest failing.
[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:14.240]  All right, let's go to your phone calls right now.
[1:33:14.240 --> 1:33:20.240]  I had a special guest that's joining us, Nick Passio's coming back on, Tony, and then we've
[1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:29.840]  got Roberto, we've got Greg and Alex and Rudy and Paul and Dave and Wendy and Mark.
[1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:36.120]  Let's talk to Tony in Wisconsin, thanks for holding you working a nursing home, God bless
[1:33:36.120 --> 1:33:37.120]  you for calling today.
[1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:38.120]  Hello, sir.
[1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:41.560]  Thanks for calling, give us your data dump, my friend.
[1:33:41.560 --> 1:33:46.400]  Well, I work in a nursing home and we have a lot of policies against like any visitors
[1:33:46.400 --> 1:33:50.960]  coming and a lot of new residents that are trying to come, we don't allow them to come
[1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:55.760]  because they have to be tested and make sure that they're COVID free, even though the test
[1:33:55.760 --> 1:33:59.400]  isn't completely accurate, it's still like a precaution we take.
[1:33:59.400 --> 1:34:01.160]  And why is that?
[1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:05.400]  So that people don't die in our whole facility.
[1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:08.720]  Is a respiratory attack, what, the elderly?
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:16.280]  Exactly, and most of our residents, we have one-on-ones that come, so they take care of
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:21.480]  residents that are typically wandering around all the time, so there's one person that takes
[1:34:21.480 --> 1:34:25.880]  care of them that comes from facility to facility to facility, and all we do to check them is
[1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:32.200]  check their temperature, but most COVID positive people are asymptomatic, so I feel like that's
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:33.680]  just stupid to have people come.
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:36.480]  Things have been like, and we're working in this nursing home in Wisconsin, last time
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:41.040]  I checked, they're not ordering COVID patients in there, like pouring gasoline on somebody's
[1:34:41.040 --> 1:34:43.120]  house and lighting on fire.
[1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:46.400]  What of the staff, the nurses, the doctors, the medical people, what have you thought
[1:34:46.400 --> 1:34:48.720]  watching this exercise in evil?
[1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:52.680]  Well, a lot of the people, I mean, I spread the information at my facility and I let
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:57.120]  everybody know, like all the nurses and the LPNs, but a lot of them are kind of ignorant
[1:34:57.120 --> 1:34:58.120]  to what's going on.
[1:34:58.120 --> 1:35:01.080]  They don't really pay attention or they just don't believe it and they don't take time
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:05.600]  to look into it, but I found that you could share things on Facebook, obviously InfoWars
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:11.160]  is URL is banned completely, but you can share things in your story, like screenshot an
[1:35:11.160 --> 1:35:15.960]  article or screenshot something and then put your name into it, put the InfoWars name
[1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:19.520]  into it and you can kind of get through the sensors, like through your story.
[1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:22.920]  Exactly, whatever they're not supposed to see, tell them, hey, InfoWars is banned for
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:26.680]  a good reason because it's people that work in nursing homes calling in, it's doctors
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:30.920]  calling in, it's us showing Cuomo deleting the executive order.
[1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:35.000]  What do you make of him deleting the executive order where he ordered under penalty of losing
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:39.400]  licenses or arrest or commandeering he threatened three months ago, the nursing homes, if they
[1:35:39.400 --> 1:35:42.400]  wouldn't take COVID patients, how evil is that?
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:46.480]  I mean, this is so ridiculous and they all said, sir, this will kill everybody and it
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:47.480]  did.
[1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:51.320]  Yeah, he deleted it just so that he can hide the evidence that he did something so that
[1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:55.160]  people that look into it later will be like, well, he never, he never did that.
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:56.840]  He never put that order out.
[1:35:56.840 --> 1:36:01.080]  And then you also have the fact that the death rate in one facility went from two to like
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:03.600]  30 after he started admitting them.
[1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:08.480]  And then you have the nursing home patient in Michigan that got beat almost to death
[1:36:08.480 --> 1:36:11.200]  by a COVID positive patient that was asymptomatic.
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:13.560]  Like, why does he need to be put in a nursing home?
[1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:14.560]  And here's the other key.
[1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:20.080]  They're saying Trump told them to it when Trump never did, but it's all blue states
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:21.080]  that pulled this.
[1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:24.760]  Yeah, and it's all blue, like blue governors.
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:30.200]  Like no Republican or most people are knowing that like, like we can't even have families
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:35.120]  visit our like everybody knows you don't visit grandma when you got a cold.
[1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:36.120]  God bless you, Tony.
[1:36:36.120 --> 1:36:37.120]  You may have more to add.
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:38.120]  He's already gone.
[1:36:38.120 --> 1:36:39.240]  Great, great call, sir.
[1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:40.240]  Thank you so much.
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:41.240]  I should let him talk.
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:42.240]  I'm going to let you talk when we come back.
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:43.240]  I want to hear from you.
[1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:44.240]  The phones are loaded.
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:54.920]  Stay with us, we're living in insanely dangerous times and I told folks the one back three
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:36:58.880]  months ago, I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:01.840]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:06.280]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages
[1:37:06.280 --> 1:37:10.000]  and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States and that's even worse in
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  the third world.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:14.520]  I hope Trump with his initiatives to clean this up and fix it, but with the election
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:19.120]  fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:20.120]  is going on.
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:24.400]  Now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years.
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:26.400]  They're an easily totable bags.
[1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:30.200]  It's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready and it funds
[1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:31.200]  the info war.
[1:37:31.200 --> 1:37:35.040]  So we have storeable food available again infowarstore.com or call toll free triple A

[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:50.200]  Memorial Day is here.
[1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:54.600]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year and we were already running a huge sale, but
[1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:57.400]  we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.

[1:38:36.760 --> 1:38:37.760]  Thank you all for watching.
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:41.360]  I appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supported you and your
[1:38:41.360 --> 1:38:44.280]  family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:45.280]  Again.
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:46.280]  Thank you all for your support.
[1:38:46.280 --> 1:38:49.880]  We are all in this together.
[1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:50.880]  Now it's official.
[1:38:50.880 --> 1:38:56.760]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years
[1:38:56.760 --> 1:39:02.080]  and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested
[1:39:02.080 --> 1:39:06.200]  because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of
[1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:08.600]  10 people that you visit.
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:12.680]  And if you go outside that list of 10, you'll be permanently detained.
[1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:17.440]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order where they let the criminals out
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:23.680]  of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers and where you are now nonessential
[1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:24.920]  and a prisoner.
[1:39:24.920 --> 1:39:29.120]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:30.120]  group.
[1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:35.280]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game,
[1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:37.520]  which is global depopulation.
[1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:41.040]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[1:39:41.040 --> 1:39:46.960]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:48.440]  mortal enemy.
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:51.120]  Wake up or die.
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:57.080]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[1:39:57.080 --> 1:40:03.080]  We will not have this sale that's going on right now in May until our Christmas sale
[1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:04.080]  comes up.
[1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:10.240]  All of our best selling supplements are 30% to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:15.320]  Let me just hone in on one of the products, DNA Force Plus.
[1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:20.480]  It's got high quality PQQ, CoQ10 and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known
[1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:22.920]  to supercharge the effects of that.

[1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:35.840]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:40.640]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer, doesn't make them grow, make some
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:43.880]  shrink, slow, which is basically the same thing.
[1:40:43.880 --> 1:40:52.760]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[1:40:52.760 --> 1:41:07.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:10.200]  I said only take like five, six calls.
[1:41:10.200 --> 1:41:13.320]  Because then we get like 20 on the line, that would get to everybody and all these are amazing
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:14.320]  calls.
[1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:15.320]  So I'm going to try to shut up and just go to you.
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:18.360]  Alex Jones here back live.
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:20.360]  Jay also works in nursing home.
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:24.560]  We've got all these people calling in for medical facilities, doctors, pharmacists on
[1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:30.680]  the topic of nursing homes, family redidive COVID-19, Declaration of Independence 2020
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:37.240]  taking on Cuomo and New York protestors via Oath Keepers, live as a nurse at nursing home.
[1:41:37.240 --> 1:41:40.640]  Let's go to Alex in New York, the epicenter of this, then we'll go to others.
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:41.640]  Thank you, Alex, for calling.
[1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:42.640]  You're on the air.
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:43.640]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:53.120]  Yes, it is, my wife has a nurse and I got so pleased about how when Cuomo ordered, exclusively
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:42:01.800]  exclusive order to test all nurses, all workers, even people who wash on floor in nursing home,
[1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:06.920]  testing by blood test on a coronavirus twice a week.
[1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:15.000]  And when they're going to make a test, they're also going to charge insurance of nurses, LPNs
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.720]  and everybody for this test.
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:26.120]  If nurse or any worker decides not to do any blood test, they will be terminated and no
[1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:29.800]  pay, no vacation pay, no nothing.
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:35.080]  And right now they are nursing home very, very short on all the workers, LPN nurses
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:43.880]  and everybody, and he was correct about Cuomo was ordered, send it to an old people from
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:47.040]  the city to the nursing home, he was correct.
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:54.680]  Originally it was 120 people in my wife's nursing home, then it was in grief up to 160.
[1:42:54.680 --> 1:43:01.720]  And fortunately right now it's about 90 people left.
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:05.560]  What is it like to see the medical workers harassed, treated like slaves?
[1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:10.440]  We're all supposed to stay at home, not get near each other, but let's ship asymptomatic
[1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:14.200]  COVID patients, making them quarantine in the nursing home.
[1:43:14.200 --> 1:43:20.560]  That's the worst decision you'd make when they did it in four deep blue states, obviously
[1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:21.560]  for the money.
[1:43:21.560 --> 1:43:23.600]  What are the reasons you think they did this for?
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:32.360]  Of course it is about money, it's one test going to cost about $300 from the insurance
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:38.600]  of LPNs and nurses, and they're going to charge personal insurance.
[1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:43.040]  Imagine just one test which is not cost more than $20, they're going to charge that much
[1:43:43.040 --> 1:43:45.720]  money, and who's going to make this money?
[1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:47.360]  Insurance companies.
[1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:49.920]  And how to push this exactly this order?
[1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:57.280]  It is spectacularly evil.
[1:43:57.280 --> 1:44:02.280]  And now he's talking about charging the nursing homes for the deaths when he ordered the whole
[1:44:02.280 --> 1:44:03.280]  operation.
[1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:04.280]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:05.280]  God bless you.
[1:44:05.280 --> 1:44:13.440]  All right, up next would be Mark in Massachusetts, family member died of COVID-19 in nursing
[1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:14.440]  home.
[1:44:14.440 --> 1:44:15.440]  Thanks for joining us.
[1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:20.720]  Hi, thanks for speaking with us all, yeah, I had a family member who was in a nursing
[1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:30.040]  home for a long time, and she was almost 80 years old, and she contracted the virus,
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:37.640]  but she had a lot of pre-existing conditions, and that's what I'm finding, that everyone
[1:44:37.640 --> 1:44:43.080]  that I hear of that's dying from this, they all have pre-existing conditions, it's not
[1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:46.880]  like over half the people are in the nursing home, so they knew that, they knew it was mainly
[1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:52.880]  killing old people with pre-existing conditions, so it's totally pre, how does Cuomo and the
[1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:57.080]  rest of these governors like knew some not get indicted, I mean, like who told them to
[1:44:57.080 --> 1:44:58.080]  do this?
[1:44:58.080 --> 1:44:59.080]  Why?
[1:44:59.080 --> 1:45:00.080]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:06.760]  Yeah, they're all above the law, you know, and you know, my ex-wife is a nurse, and she
[1:45:06.760 --> 1:45:11.440]  talks about it all the time, like I can hear her voice shaking when she talks to me about
[1:45:11.440 --> 1:45:15.800]  it, because she's just, you know, she says they're all going to have PTSD by the end
[1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:25.360]  of it, because, you know, they're just dealing with all this, and it doesn't make sense.
[1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:28.520]  For me, okay, the globalists have the power.
[1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:31.360]  Why do they say they want to get rid of old people and children?
[1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:36.440]  Because it's about power to them, it's about life and death, they want to be God.
[1:45:36.440 --> 1:45:41.240]  Yeah, it must be, I don't know.
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:43.600]  Well, what else do you want to add, Mark?
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:47.920]  No, that's about it, you know, it was just great to talk to you, thanks.
[1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:48.920]  Thank you, brother.
[1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:51.400]  I'm sorry to hear about your family member.
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:56.280]  Let's go ahead and go to Deborah in Michigan, you're on the air nursing homes and your comments
[1:45:56.280 --> 1:45:57.280]  on those.
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:45:58.280]  Go ahead.
[1:45:58.280 --> 1:45:59.280]  Hi, Alex.
[1:45:59.280 --> 1:46:00.920]  I'm an activist.
[1:46:00.920 --> 1:46:04.120]  I know why they're killing them, I know how they're killing them, and they've been doing
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:05.920]  it for a long time.
[1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:10.360]  They got my father, my sister, my boyfriend, and my best friend.
[1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:14.600]  Age ranges from 47 to 85.
[1:46:14.600 --> 1:46:20.680]  I know how the baby boomers and their parents are getting ready to hand down $47 trillion
[1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:22.360]  to their children.
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:25.680]  The politicians and the bankers want it.
[1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:28.600]  The probate courts are in on all this.
[1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:30.600]  I'm not joking.
[1:46:30.600 --> 1:46:32.920]  I've been fighting this for years.
[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:37.440]  I noticed it when I was selling medical equipment in Arizona.
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:41.080]  Every patient I had, they was murdered.
[1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:43.400]  When they got my father, I couldn't believe it.
[1:46:43.400 --> 1:46:46.960]  I had to kidnap him.
[1:46:46.960 --> 1:46:52.200]  They sent armed officers to my home to arrest me.
[1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:54.320]  It was a job to keep him alive.
[1:46:54.320 --> 1:46:55.680]  He had a large estate.
[1:46:55.680 --> 1:46:57.920]  They got the whole estate.
[1:46:57.920 --> 1:46:59.520]  I'm not joking.
[1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:00.520]  It's about the money.
[1:47:00.520 --> 1:47:04.120]  So when they get somebody that has an estate in there, they can just milk it out of them.
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:05.120]  We know that.
[1:47:05.120 --> 1:47:07.840]  The cops are like, oh, they're the medical authorities, they're the boss.
[1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:12.080]  Notice Governor Northam last year said, we don't want the government involved.
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:14.760]  The doctors will tell the mother what to do.
[1:47:14.760 --> 1:47:16.360]  That's the new mafia.
[1:47:16.360 --> 1:47:17.360]  Yeah.
[1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:22.560]  And they depend on the families not understanding the medicine.
[1:47:22.560 --> 1:47:27.680]  They're using fentanyl, adavine, and morphine, and they're euthanizing them.
[1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:31.760]  Now with COVID, it's a free-for-all because all they have to do is shove the tube down
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:33.720]  their throat and blow up their lungs.
[1:47:33.720 --> 1:47:40.360]  They get an instant 50,000 before they would sign them up to hospice and anybody can sign
[1:47:40.360 --> 1:47:44.560]  you up to hospice and you can't unsign the papers.
[1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:46.440]  I tried to get a friend of mine out.
[1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:47.560]  They were euthanizing him.
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:49.520]  He was 47.
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:51.320]  He begged to live.
[1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:53.920]  The lady told me this to my face.
[1:47:53.920 --> 1:47:55.760]  The paperwork is signed.
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:57.920]  He's scheduled to die.
[1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:06.440]  Anyone who interferes with this medical procedure will be prosecuted and jailed.
[1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:09.080]  The police were called and I was removed.
[1:48:09.080 --> 1:48:11.560]  My friend died at two the next day.
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:13.840]  That was my best friend.
[1:48:13.840 --> 1:48:16.120]  I've been an activist trying to stop this.
[1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:19.280]  They just killed my girlfriend's mom two months ago.
[1:48:19.280 --> 1:48:23.240]  COVID is a free-for-all to make big money.
[1:48:23.240 --> 1:48:27.040]  I'm in Michigan and it's bad.
[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:29.200]  Our governor doesn't just do evil things.
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:31.680]  She acts completely evil.
[1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:34.920]  She is so proud of herself killing all those people at the nursing homes.
[1:48:34.920 --> 1:48:37.280]  Yeah, I couldn't believe it.
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:39.080]  They're doing it.
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:40.080]  It's horrible.
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:41.080]  They suffer.
[1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:42.080]  It's torture.
[1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:44.080]  They know they're being killed.
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:49.360]  Reportally, it's excruciatingly painful when they blow your lungs up like this.
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:50.640]  That was going to get the death numbers up.
[1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:52.640]  But doctors came out and said it was wrong.
[1:48:52.640 --> 1:48:55.960]  The key is medical workers coming out and exposing it, family exposing it.
[1:48:55.960 --> 1:49:00.800]  It's not about saying, oh, we're going to bring COVID patients in and put them in the
[1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:02.280]  wards with people to give them COVID.
[1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:03.680]  But family can't come.
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:04.680]  You might have COVID.
[1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:08.960]  No, that was because they were in there killing these people and wanted to cover it up.
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:09.960]  Got it.
[1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:12.120]  That's exactly it.
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:13.600]  And now it's a free-for-all.
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:15.440]  I've never seen anything like it.
[1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:16.440]  This is insanity.
[1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:18.440]  This is Nazi Germany.
[1:49:18.440 --> 1:49:20.440]  This is what it is.
[1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:23.480]  Ma'am, the same people put Hitler in are running all this.
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:25.440]  This is absolutely Bill Millenegades.
[1:49:25.440 --> 1:49:26.440]  Exactly.
[1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:27.440]  Exactly.
[1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:31.080]  I'm telling you, people, you better wake up.
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:34.880]  They reclassified baby boomers, 50 and over.
[1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:35.880]  They want the estate.
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:36.880]  Well, they're going to kill everybody.
[1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:37.880]  That's what it's about.
[1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:39.380]  And all these liberals get ready to die.
[1:49:39.380 --> 1:49:40.480]  They all think they're part of the system.
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:41.480]  You're not.
[1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:42.480]  God bless you, ma'am.
[1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:43.480]  I can hear the concern in her voice.
[1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:45.480]  I mean, this is the rollout.
[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:50.960]  The tyrannies always start medically in the last 100 years or so.
[1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:59.040]  And these people are not gods, and the average doctors and nurses are good people.
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:01.760]  If they fill out one thing wrong, they get indicted.
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:06.280]  But if you or your hospital commits crimes and kills people for organs and does all this,
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:08.480]  then you're in like Flynn, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:11.920]  We're going to go to Brayton, come back with more of your phone calls, and Mark Passio is
[1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:12.920]  going to come on.
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:18.640]  I really enjoy hearing from him here today, infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow's news
[1:50:18.640 --> 1:50:19.640]  today.
[1:50:19.640 --> 1:50:24.600]  I can't stress to you what a war this is, and also that, again, we had last week's
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:25.600]  sale.
[1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:27.400]  We had to end that because some of the stuff was selling out.
[1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:31.200]  But I extended what was left and a lot of the great products and added some new products
[1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:37.800]  that had been sold out to the 30 to 70% off list.
[1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:43.840]  And so now, supermail, vitality, 40% off, knockout, 50% off, brain force plus, 50% off,
[1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:46.680]  bio-trux, selenium, 60% off, chill force, 60% off.
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:47.680]  That's an amazing product.
[1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:50.320]  DNA force, still 50% off.
[1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:52.880]  But the groups here are going to have to end.
[1:50:52.880 --> 1:50:56.360]  Well, we'll continue the supermail and knockout, brain force, bio-trux, selenium, and chill
[1:50:56.360 --> 1:50:57.600]  force for another week or so.
[1:50:57.600 --> 1:50:58.600]  That's our new sale.
[1:50:58.600 --> 1:50:59.880]  It's part of the old sale.
[1:50:59.880 --> 1:51:03.560]  But all of this will end today or tomorrow.
[1:51:03.560 --> 1:51:04.560]  I'm so busy with news.
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:07.040]  Again, I haven't gone and changed this yet.
[1:51:07.040 --> 1:51:12.080]  Ultimate Cradle, 50% off, Survival Shield, 50% off, Emerix Essentials, 50% off, APEC
[1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:13.480]  Powerstack, 70% off.
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:14.480]  That's going to have to end soon.
[1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:20.080]  DNA force plus, 50% off, Living Defense, 50% off, Turbo Force, 40% off.
[1:51:20.080 --> 1:51:23.640]  Swarble Food, available again for the crazy times coming ahead, folks.
[1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:24.640]  You get the Swarble Food.
[1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:25.640]  We have the best.
[1:51:25.640 --> 1:51:27.360]  And it's available at InfowarsTour.com.
[1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:28.760]  All right.
[1:51:28.760 --> 1:51:32.200]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:33.200]  It is the Infowar.
[1:51:33.200 --> 1:51:34.200]  And it's real.
[1:51:34.200 --> 1:51:35.680]  Everybody now knows, man.
[1:51:35.680 --> 1:51:36.680]  We weren't playing around.
[1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:38.680]  This stuff's all real.
[1:51:38.680 --> 1:51:43.440]  Feudalism in the ancient world from Asia to Europe, from Africa to Latin America was
[1:51:43.440 --> 1:51:45.760]  the most common form of government.
[1:51:45.760 --> 1:51:50.560]  You had a ruling class, the nobility, the king and queen sitting on top of it.
[1:51:50.560 --> 1:51:56.000]  And the rest of the public were kept at a subsistence, starving level for control.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:00.720]  In fact, in most cultures, they call the peasants the little people because they were usually
[1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:07.280]  a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them again at a starving
[1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:08.280]  level.
[1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:12.480]  They were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to challenge the entrenched
[1:52:12.480 --> 1:52:13.480]  elite.
[1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:17.440]  Well, now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the Jeff
[1:52:17.440 --> 1:52:18.640]  Bezos is the world.
[1:52:18.640 --> 1:52:23.640]  They're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets
[1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:29.400]  living the life, laughing at you, shut down, going bankrupt in the third world, starving
[1:52:29.400 --> 1:52:30.400]  to death.
[1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:33.080]  Their religion is power and control.
[1:52:33.080 --> 1:52:36.000]  And they are pressing that advantage against us.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:40.840]  We must break free from these monsters.
[1:52:40.840 --> 1:52:43.080]  This is the end, my friends.
[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:48.960]  My only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of everything that stands,
[1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:53.600]  the end, the safety, the delusion.
[1:52:53.600 --> 1:52:58.560]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because it was only the mirage of safety.
[1:52:58.560 --> 1:53:05.400]  Movies and partying and living like children, ever growing up, ever caring about other people.
[1:53:05.400 --> 1:53:08.280]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[1:53:08.280 --> 1:53:13.080]  Just like the history books show us, just like the Bible states, every time Israel became
[1:53:13.080 --> 1:53:18.320]  corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity because their
[1:53:18.320 --> 1:53:25.040]  people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated by spies, and then they were enslaved.
[1:53:25.040 --> 1:53:30.720]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:33.200]  absolute bondage.
[1:53:33.200 --> 1:53:35.280]  Info wars has decided to fight for freedom.
[1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:42.120]  Info wars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[1:53:42.120 --> 1:54:10.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:10.520 --> 1:54:14.240]  We're taking your phone calls right now, and they're all powerful.
[1:54:14.240 --> 1:54:15.240]  It's the truth.
[1:54:15.240 --> 1:54:16.240]  It's the reality.
[1:54:16.240 --> 1:54:17.240]  It's what they want cut off.
[1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:21.720]  I mean, the whole other big story is how Google and Twitter are now on your personal
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:22.720]  messages.
[1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:23.720]  They're in your personal downloads.
[1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:27.960]  They're now going out and finding downloads of films, exposing medical tyranny, and Fauci
[1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:31.440]  and Gates are deleting them off your computers, so they're not just in the cloud now.
[1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:33.800]  They're deleting them off your computer.
[1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:40.040]  It's a free-for-all, and Trump's great and all that, but he's 74 years old and he's
[1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:49.360]  up there, and we've been overrun, and big tech has nothing but arrogance for everybody.
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:58.480]  All right, let's go ahead and take a call from Greg in Wyoming.
[1:54:58.480 --> 1:54:59.480]  You're on the air.
[1:54:59.480 --> 1:55:00.480]  Go ahead.
[1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:03.320]  Alex Jones, it's good to talk to you, brother.
[1:55:03.320 --> 1:55:05.440]  Good to talk to you, brother.
[1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:12.360]  So listen up, you said something about this not being a spectator sport earlier, and you're
[1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:14.920]  absolutely correct.
[1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:17.640]  Freedom is not a spectator sport.
[1:55:17.640 --> 1:55:23.360]  You will either actively fight for your freedom, or you will passively lose your freedom.
[1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:26.760]  Now, I have a question for your listeners.
[1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:30.160]  Are you mad at American?
[1:55:30.160 --> 1:55:36.240]  Because let me tell you, the founders, they gifted us a blueprint to fight the tyranny
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:42.200]  that they could see was taking place right at this very moment in time, and that blueprint
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:49.000]  is the Declaration of Independence, and it's time that we use that declaration.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  In fact, I've crafted the Declaration of Independence.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  Well, you're right.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  I mean, it's the law.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:56.200]  It's our right, our duty to abolish a government that is destructive of our freedom, and my
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:56:01.960]  God, you're premeditatedly incubating COVID-19 and nursing homes by design and locking the
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:06.840]  families out, but then saying, but the medical staff has to be tested for COVID.
[1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:14.240]  That is so sick, that is so evil, and it just, they have to pay for what they've done.
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:20.200]  They have to be put on notice, brother, and as I've said, I've crafted the Declaration
[1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:22.640]  of Independence 2020.
[1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:29.960]  When I have this posted up on Twitter at Angry American, I would encourage you, please, Alex,
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:30.960]  to look this over.
[1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:31.960]  I will.
[1:56:31.960 --> 1:56:32.960]  So what's the actual handle?
[1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:35.480]  Is it at Angry American?
[1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:37.520]  Actual handle is American spirit.
[1:56:37.520 --> 1:56:38.520]  I had to use the uppercase.
[1:56:38.520 --> 1:56:42.520]  No, I'm actually asking for the handles, they can find it.
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:43.520]  Sure.
[1:56:43.520 --> 1:56:51.200]  I'm flying the upside down flag, brother, because our nation is in distress.
[1:56:51.200 --> 1:56:54.840]  You don't have to tell me about it, I hear you, man, I am so freaked out.
[1:56:54.840 --> 1:57:01.560]  The way they, it's like you plan this evil, and they carry it out, and they brag, and
[1:57:01.560 --> 1:57:04.480]  then you can guess the next move, because it's all laid out, and I'm just sitting here
[1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:10.960]  going, I don't hate, some of you look like a psychotic child molester, I don't hate
[1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:14.520]  that Hitler lady up in Michigan, she just looks like a demon witch, Cuomo, all of them,
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:19.040]  but I mean, they're killing people, and they know it, and they think it's funny.
[1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:23.080]  They can't stop smiling, and I'm like, you know, I'm aiding and abetting this killing,
[1:57:23.080 --> 1:57:27.360]  if I don't do something, and I'm just telling you, I'm to the point where, I mean, look
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:32.480]  at that guy, I mean, just look at that psychotic demon, just look at him, my God, is he not
[1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:37.720]  just radiate Satanism, yeah, he's got freaking slit eyes, it looks like, he looks like a
[1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:40.120]  damn snake, man.
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:44.480]  I mean, would you let that guy babysit your kids, hell no, well, he's going to run your
[1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:51.760]  lives and kill your ass, go ahead, that's what they want to do, we all know it, and
[1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:58.240]  are we going to passively sit by and let them do this, no, we are not, that's why on July
[1:57:58.240 --> 1:58:04.280]  4th, Independence Day, I will be in Cheyenne, Wyoming at the Capitol, and I'm going to
[1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:11.400]  be reading the new Declaration of Independence, it's the next generation declaration, and
[1:58:11.400 --> 1:58:17.320]  I encourage all your listeners to look at this declaration, go to their capitals on
[1:58:17.320 --> 1:58:18.320]  Independence Day.
[1:58:18.320 --> 1:58:21.080]  All right, I want to read it, I'm going to pull it up, guys, put it up for me, God bless
[1:58:21.080 --> 1:58:24.280]  you brother, again, I love the crew, but I told them to get like five, six calls, so
[1:58:24.280 --> 1:58:28.960]  I want people to be able to hold Roberto, Alex, Rudy, Paul, Dave, Wendy, I'm going to have
[1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:32.640]  to comment there some time from the guests the next hour, if you guys want to hold 45-50
[1:58:32.640 --> 1:58:37.120]  minutes, I'll get to you, if not, you hang up, and I won't do the fourth hour, and we're
[1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:44.080]  going to cover the big Falcon 9 heavy launch coming up as well in the war room, stay with
[1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:47.960]  us.
[1:58:47.960 --> 1:58:52.160]  Memorial Day is here, it's one of the biggest sales of the year, and we were already running
[1:58:52.160 --> 1:58:56.160]  a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out,
[1:58:56.160 --> 1:59:00.680]  but all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale, and then five items
[1:59:00.680 --> 1:59:04.960]  that weren't on sale, we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well
[1:59:04.960 --> 1:59:10.520]  for the Memorial Day special, so here it is, super mail vitality, 40% off, knockout, the

[1:59:30.640 --> 1:59:35.600]  to get these items and take advantage of this mega sale Memorial Day. Again, thank you all
[1:59:35.600 --> 1:59:39.800]  for watching, we appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supported
[1:59:39.800 --> 1:59:43.440]  you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body. Again,
[1:59:43.440 --> 2:00:01.120]  thank you all for your support, we are all in this together.
[2:00:01.120 --> 2:00:16.840]  This is the end, my only friend, the end of our elaborate lives, the end of everything
[2:00:16.840 --> 2:00:28.800]  that stands the end. No safety, no safety, no surprise. All the honeymoon, living off
[2:00:28.800 --> 2:00:34.960]  the energy of others and those that stood up for basic human freedoms and the trailblazed
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:43.640]  some of the good things we have in this world, all that's over. The reserve tank is empty,
[2:00:43.640 --> 2:00:47.840]  but that's actually goodness, because all those that have doubled and tripled and quadrupled
[2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:52.960]  down on the lies are now going to have to sleep in the beds they made. I wanted to get
[2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:56.680]  Mark Passio back on because I really like the work he does and my wife's a fan as well,
[2:00:56.680 --> 2:01:03.200]  hard to do what he was before she became a fan, but she watches this all the time. What
[2:01:03.200 --> 2:01:08.000]  on earth is happening dot com? I'm going to have him on some time just about his journey
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:12.880]  of awakening through the occult and coming out of that, but all these schools are painted
[2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:17.480]  and controlled the rose color darkly of the priesthood classes that are trying to get
[2:01:17.480 --> 2:01:23.840]  us to enter their control and not having our connection to God and to that almighty power.
[2:01:23.840 --> 2:01:26.960]  We've got NASA coming out admitting there's a whole other dimension they found, look they've
[2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:30.600]  always known this, there's a lot of dimensions they're trying to suppress that knowledge
[2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:34.240]  because a nation of blind sheep can be led easily to slaughter. But I wanted to get him
[2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:42.960]  on just in general today about the big picture of this time because the end means a beginning
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:48.000]  as well and just crazy things going on, who he thinks the factions are, where he thinks
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:52.800]  all this is going, what's going to happen next because it's getting so crazy as the
[2:01:52.800 --> 2:01:57.520]  psychotics, like the nursing home thing I've been obsessing on, knowingly sending COVID
[2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:02.160]  patients there, knowing that would cause mass death, the only group that it kills in large
[2:02:02.160 --> 2:02:06.080]  numbers and then turning around and being saviors after they've done it and threatening
[2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:12.320]  to arrest all the nursing home owners when they order them to do it. I mean, it's a form
[2:02:12.320 --> 2:02:21.000]  of black magic, really it is, where why is Bill Gates' wife, Melinda Gates, and it is,
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:25.640]  it's an upside down cross. And the Church of Satan though got fat checked it with snobes
[2:02:25.640 --> 2:02:28.920]  and well, when you wear an upside down cross, it doesn't mean you're officially with this
[2:02:28.920 --> 2:02:32.120]  Church of Satan. So they play that game like if you're not affiliated with Antonin Le Fay's
[2:02:32.120 --> 2:02:37.640]  group, why they say they don't have no record of them, so it's not satanic. It's an open
[2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:42.160]  flaunting and a lesser magic. What is this really all about? And then all of their bills
[2:02:42.160 --> 2:02:48.720]  and sponsored codes and patents are 666. What's in that? Mark Pascio joins us the rest of
[2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:52.640]  the hour. Thanks for joining us. What on earth is happening dot com? I've thrown a lot out
[2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:58.560]  there. Tackler, whatever you want to take first. Well, Alex, I fully agree. I mean,
[2:02:58.560 --> 2:03:03.480]  we are really being ruled by Satanists. We are being ruled by Darko cultists. That's
[2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:10.560]  what is really taking place. These people have had control of our planet since time immemorial.
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:14.640]  They've probably had control of our planet since human beings have existed here on this
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:21.560]  planet. This is a time of opportunity for people to make that recognition and to get
[2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:28.120]  their ego out of the way so that they can understand what a religion they have actually
[2:03:28.120 --> 2:03:38.480]  been inculcated into. See, what we have planetarily, we have a whole lot of de facto Satanists.
[2:03:38.480 --> 2:03:48.240]  So de facto means indeed by their deeds. So if you actually look at the tenets of Satanism,
[2:03:48.240 --> 2:03:53.560]  you will see that it is all about egotism. It is about placing the self first and foremost
[2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:59.560]  even if you have to hurt others in the process. So out of control ego, how many people in
[2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:04.440]  our society embrace that type of a characteristic and their personality? I would say it's a
[2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:09.160]  good amount. And then that's reflected back to us in the form of the people that we say
[2:04:09.160 --> 2:04:15.060]  are in control. Look at these governors. They are de facto Satanists if they are ever
[2:04:15.060 --> 2:04:17.960]  were any. I mean these people are completely entrenched.
[2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:24.920]  And they can't even hide that. What's that craze look these Satanists get? They are like
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:31.840]  in ecstasy. It's so ridiculous. Getting off on power, a perceived power over other people.
[2:04:31.840 --> 2:04:37.800]  You see, what we have to realize is that this is all a reflection in consciousness of what
[2:04:37.800 --> 2:04:41.640]  is really taking place in the majority of human beings because you can look at it.
[2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:44.760]  No, I totally agree. Us becoming Satanic allows them to flourish and they are just
[2:04:44.760 --> 2:04:49.480]  kind of the lowest herd. But don't they know how sick they look to someone that has discernment?
[2:04:49.480 --> 2:04:52.720]  I mean, they are pathetic. They don't have real power just because they are screwing
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:55.000]  people over.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:59.280]  They can only control people that are really at their level of consciousness or below their
[2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:03.920]  level of consciousness. And that's the problem. So then if you actually really ask yourself
[2:05:03.920 --> 2:05:08.720]  where is the consciousness of the people of earth, it will make us really as people who
[2:05:08.720 --> 2:05:13.520]  are exactly there just a gauge of how low we've sunk.
[2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:18.640]  We will realize if we understand that what our work is to do. And it's a tremendous body
[2:05:18.640 --> 2:05:23.960]  of work that has to be put forward to get people to really set down their false versions
[2:05:23.960 --> 2:05:29.040]  of reality, the stories that they tell themselves. You know, it's all ego that's in the way.
[2:05:29.040 --> 2:05:34.400]  The ego is really the foresee of people who like look at ego from this new age perspective
[2:05:34.400 --> 2:05:38.720]  or this religious perspective. Don't really understand. It's just the force inside our
[2:05:38.720 --> 2:05:45.680]  minds that refuses to allow us to say the simple phrase, I was wrong. How many people can't
[2:05:45.680 --> 2:05:49.240]  utter that phrase, can't acknowledge that they were wrong about something, that they
[2:05:49.240 --> 2:05:53.560]  were duped about something, that they didn't see things clearly in the past.
[2:05:53.560 --> 2:05:57.320]  Usually the beginning is becoming humble, which means really just not being on a power
[2:05:57.320 --> 2:06:02.840]  trip. That's right. It is humbling yourself to the truth. Because if we don't do that,
[2:06:02.840 --> 2:06:08.360]  the only thing that's really going to shake this planet awake is pain. The way of maximum
[2:06:08.360 --> 2:06:13.400]  pain is what I call it, is when we have chosen the path of ignorance, which is the refusal
[2:06:13.400 --> 2:06:19.160]  of truth, the refusal of acknowledging that we don't have the right to command anybody.
[2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:24.640]  These people don't have the right to command anybody. This is all an illusory form of power.
[2:06:24.640 --> 2:06:29.560]  And because we have refused that, in that ignorance, we have gone into a level of consciousness
[2:06:29.560 --> 2:06:35.360]  that allows us to be controlled by this satanic cabal, this worldwide network of darker cultures.
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:38.880]  We've been given over to a grand delusion. How deep is it going to get? When do we hit
[2:06:38.880 --> 2:06:39.880]  rock bottom?
[2:06:39.880 --> 2:06:45.600]  Well, we're going to hit rock bottom when there is absolutely no freedom in the world,
[2:06:45.600 --> 2:06:51.000]  and they start really truly merging consciousness with machines. That's where this is going
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:57.440]  into an AI hell. But the thing is, we can level the playing field very easily. The problem
[2:06:57.440 --> 2:07:06.040]  is, people have to let go of their false and illusory ideas of what good and evil really
[2:07:06.040 --> 2:07:10.840]  are because we have a false version of what is good. We've been told a false version of
[2:07:10.840 --> 2:07:15.200]  what freedom is. We've been told a false version of what goodness really is. We don't really
[2:07:15.200 --> 2:07:19.960]  truly know what good behavior is as a species. And we've also been told a false version of
[2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:24.680]  what evil is, what bad behaviors are. See, the occultists have done a great job. People
[2:07:24.680 --> 2:07:31.040]  have to understand, occult doesn't mean worship of supernatural gods and performing crazy
[2:07:31.040 --> 2:07:39.120]  rituals in a dense forest. This is a Hollywoodized variant of the occult. You have to take it
[2:07:39.120 --> 2:07:44.000]  from me. I was involved with these people. I was involved in the dark occult for many
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:50.520]  years of my life earlier on when I was younger. The occult is simply an ancient form of deep
[2:07:50.520 --> 2:07:56.240]  psychology. These people understand every aspect of how the human mind works, all of
[2:07:56.240 --> 2:07:59.560]  our motivations. They understand the archetypes, they understand the epigenetics, they know
[2:07:59.560 --> 2:08:04.200]  how to program people. Without a doubt, that's what they are. They are ancient, powerful
[2:08:04.200 --> 2:08:08.680]  psychologists who have done their homework about the human mind and fully know how to
[2:08:08.680 --> 2:08:14.920]  control the mind. They are mind controllers. And they decided to make everybody dumber
[2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:18.320]  to control them, which is the first level of being collapsed. I mean, they claim they're
[2:08:18.320 --> 2:08:21.840]  so ascendant, but the fact that they try to dumb people down and take free will shows
[2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:26.720]  they're the opposite. And those are the real pandemics, Alex. Fear and ignorance. Fear
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:32.080]  and ignorance always makes people easier to control. And these controllers, these occultists
[2:08:32.080 --> 2:08:36.640]  know this. But see what they've really occulted. They've occulted or hidden. That's all the
[2:08:36.640 --> 2:08:43.400]  word occult means hidden. They have hidden a form of knowledge that is the absolute most
[2:08:43.400 --> 2:08:49.320]  deeply occulted thing in the entire world. And it's what enables them to keep their control
[2:08:49.320 --> 2:08:56.080]  going and going. And that is what the actual difference between good behavior or right
[2:08:56.080 --> 2:09:03.920]  behavior and bad behavior or immoral behavior. People do not understand worldwide the actual
[2:09:03.920 --> 2:09:10.120]  objective difference between moral behavior and immoral behavior. And that is the occult
[2:09:10.120 --> 2:09:15.880]  knowledge that has allowed the cabal of sorcerers, of mind controlling sorcerers that really
[2:09:15.880 --> 2:09:20.720]  has the ultimate form of power in our world, which is power over the human mind to continue
[2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:21.720]  their...
[2:09:21.720 --> 2:09:25.440]  Let's talk about what you're seeing is the ultimate occult secret on the other side of
[2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:31.520]  Mark Pascio, what on earth is happening.com, Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com.
[2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:35.280]  The only way these sites get out is you hand-sharing them and it changes the world. Don't think
[2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:39.280]  you're doing that's a small thing. It's the biggest thing. Putting your free will into
[2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:45.760]  action with truth. You couple those together, it changes the universe. We'll be right back.
[2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:52.280]  Infowars has become a symbol, an emblem of not just American freedom, but worldwide Maverick
[2:09:52.280 --> 2:09:58.200]  spirit. It's not just myself or the host at Infowars or the researchers or the journalists.
[2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:03.200]  You the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines in the arena. And it's
[2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:08.920]  the amazing guests and individuals that we interview that make Infowars so special because
[2:10:08.920 --> 2:10:13.840]  we're not putting a filter in front of free minds. We're having an open discussion about
[2:10:13.840 --> 2:10:18.360]  the real state of the world, not the establishment of talking points that are put out by the
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:23.240]  Council on Fine Relations, the Bilderberg Group, the Davos Group and other club lists.
[2:10:23.240 --> 2:10:29.480]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans,
[2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:35.040]  poor humans, by humans. Not a world where the establishment, hate themselves, project
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:39.240]  their hate onto us and decide we're going to have a post-human world. I'm really excited
[2:10:39.240 --> 2:10:43.960]  to know that Infowars has your support and I want to thank you all for being pro-human
[2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:45.920]  and pro-God.

[2:11:49.160 --> 2:11:52.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:52.160 --> 2:12:05.160]  There's a lot of laws to the globalists, to their Satanism, and I've just observed them
[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:10.480]  growing up. That's the best intelligence. It's not going off what's in books or what
[2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:17.040]  people say, but what they do. Like Christ said, you judge a tree by its fruits, and with
[2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:23.440]  these globalists, these Satanists, most of them are minions. They just follow orders,
[2:12:23.440 --> 2:12:27.840]  and they're so unhappy. They're miserable people. They're ugly. They're stupid. They
[2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:32.880]  always are going around on these bizarre power trips. They're really unconscious, but their
[2:12:32.880 --> 2:12:38.960]  main mission is burn things down, destroy things, and then build ugly edifices to themselves
[2:12:38.960 --> 2:12:46.320]  because it's really like cancer. It's malfunctioning individuals. Like that group of photos right
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:53.000]  there, those are real photos. That was David Rockefeller at what, 97, Kissinger about eight
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:13:03.240]  years ago, and that's a recent photo of Soros. Somebody asked me once, what would you give
[2:13:03.240 --> 2:13:08.480]  for your eyes? A billion dollars, two billion dollars? Well, you're like, the answer's nothing.
[2:13:08.480 --> 2:13:15.160]  You've had sight. You've seen it. What about your essence, your soul? Well, that's priceless,
[2:13:15.160 --> 2:13:20.240]  but see if someone woke up born without eyes, you can try to program them and trick them
[2:13:20.240 --> 2:13:24.280]  to believe whatever fantasy you wanted. So the occult is really about keeping your eyes
[2:13:24.280 --> 2:13:29.200]  from being open and seeing what's happening. And then you think you're getting the secrets
[2:13:29.200 --> 2:13:35.040]  because you're in the dark and you need them to tell you what to do. And so for me, that's
[2:13:35.040 --> 2:13:39.040]  really the biggest secret is, is that it's men putting themselves between us and the
[2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:44.680]  Creator and God and trying to get us to malfunction and engage in sin so that they have ways then
[2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:48.920]  to get more control of us. And it's really just a cancerous exercise. But Mark Passio,
[2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:52.920]  short segment, long segment coming up, get into this big secret from your perspective,
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:58.520]  your research about the deepest occult secret. Well, it's very appropriate that you would
[2:13:58.520 --> 2:14:03.680]  bring up the eye, you know, because that's where the word occult comes from, the Latin
[2:14:03.680 --> 2:14:09.840]  noun Oculus, which means eye. And then occultare is the verb in Latin, which means to hide
[2:14:09.840 --> 2:14:14.440]  or to conceal from the eye, to conceal from sight. You know, it's all based on the same
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:19.840]  root word. See, they don't want us to be able to see, but what don't they want us to be
[2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:24.880]  able to see is the ultimate question. And in my years of researching the occult of being
[2:14:24.880 --> 2:14:29.880]  involved in it, the ultimate hidden knowledge, the ultimate thing that they want to occult
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:36.700]  from our vision is the objective difference between right behavior and wrong behavior.
[2:14:36.700 --> 2:14:42.720]  In other words, what is the difference between a moral action and an immoral action? Because
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:48.620]  if you can do that, if you can get people completely confused as to what right and wrong
[2:14:48.620 --> 2:14:55.000]  actually are in nature, okay, you will have them acting against the laws of the creator
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:15:03.360]  of the universe in no time flat. They want the destruction of the human soul without
[2:15:03.360 --> 2:15:07.800]  any doubt, without any question. They want a society where the souls of the individuals
[2:15:07.800 --> 2:15:12.560]  have been completely destroyed. And as you said, they build up a tyranny upon the edifice
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:17.140]  of those former souls that are now completely destroyed. They cannot see the difference
[2:15:17.140 --> 2:15:23.000]  between right and wrong and cannot even see that they are now slaves. See, they have occulted
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:30.200]  what a right is and what a wrong is. And this evidence could be fully proven and shown.
[2:15:30.200 --> 2:15:35.760]  All any of your listeners or viewers have to do is go out on the street corner and do
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:41.320]  a little social experiment and ask people if they can give the correct definition of
[2:15:41.320 --> 2:15:47.720]  what a human right is. A right is an action that does not initiate harm to another sentient
[2:15:47.720 --> 2:15:53.240]  being. Human beings will not be able to do that. They will not be able to give the correct
[2:15:53.240 --> 2:15:58.960]  definition. 99.99% of the human population does not know that definition.
[2:15:58.960 --> 2:15:59.960]  And that is the correct.
[2:15:59.960 --> 2:16:02.680]  And now they're making it where AI computers put fake news in front of everything you would
[2:16:02.680 --> 2:16:05.320]  try to search. I mean, it's just getting deep quick.
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:10.140]  Oh, the search engines aren't even showing people results of what's available on the
[2:16:10.140 --> 2:16:15.520]  internet. The paradigm shift has to be made technologically in people's minds that what
[2:16:15.520 --> 2:16:20.480]  you are searching. You don't get some from a search engine. You have to go to the URL.
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:24.600]  Pretty much. And hopefully sites that index a lot of content, they have their own search
[2:16:24.600 --> 2:16:31.200]  engines built into the site. See, a search engine is only showing you like maybe a 0.5
[2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:37.200]  percent. But notice how it suddenly clicked and we've had this giant societal de-evolution
[2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:41.160]  and I see it clicking faster and faster toward just in a few years, we're going to be deep
[2:16:41.160 --> 2:16:43.480]  inside the new world order.
[2:16:43.480 --> 2:16:49.240]  I think we're already there. I mean, we're already there as far as anything regarding
[2:16:49.240 --> 2:16:54.960]  our rights is concerned. See, if you can't correctly define and understand what a right
[2:16:54.960 --> 2:17:00.440]  is, you're quickly going to lose them. You know, we don't know what our rights are.
[2:17:00.440 --> 2:17:04.640]  We think that we have certain people have rights that others don't. We don't understand
[2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:09.320]  that everyone has all the same rights because any action that initiates harm against another
[2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:13.680]  sentient being, if anyone does that, that's a wrongdoing. Therefore, everyone has the
[2:17:13.680 --> 2:17:14.680]  same rights.
[2:17:14.680 --> 2:17:18.400]  We can do the rights that don't initiate. That's right. You don't have the deed to hurt
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:19.920]  somebody else.
[2:17:19.920 --> 2:17:24.120]  That's right. We can't grant that to anybody. You know, we believe that we can conduct these
[2:17:24.120 --> 2:17:29.200]  religious ceremonies and signing of papers and grant rights that other people don't have.
[2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:33.720]  And the ego is in the way to understanding this. See, that's the new nobility. They're
[2:17:33.720 --> 2:17:37.600]  actually saying if you're all these, those are protected groups, you're this new royalty
[2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:43.320]  because the crown, the government has bestowed it to you. That itself is a very satanic act.
[2:17:43.320 --> 2:17:49.920]  Sure. They want to place their little, you know, run of the mill, rank and file minions,
[2:17:49.920 --> 2:17:50.920]  you know, in front of the people.
[2:17:50.920 --> 2:17:56.760]  So let me ask you this. What was the satanic exercise of these four blue states saying we're
[2:17:56.760 --> 2:18:00.520]  ordering COVID patients into nursing homes knowing it was a death sentence and half the
[2:18:00.520 --> 2:18:04.520]  death? It was just a raw, and when those governors would get up and talk about it, they'd go,
[2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:09.320]  I know I've been criticized, but I'm doing it. And they'd really like little demon dances.
[2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:11.400]  This is a public sacrifice.
[2:18:11.400 --> 2:18:17.400]  It's a total human sacrifice ritual. That is what it really is. That is a human sacrifice
[2:18:17.400 --> 2:18:21.520]  ritual. And it is done during the time of the year. This was all done during the time
[2:18:21.520 --> 2:18:26.720]  of the year known as the occult season of sacrifice, which is a satanic season of the
[2:18:26.720 --> 2:18:33.480]  year between the spring equinox and the midpoint of spring, which is May 1st, Valperge is knocked.
[2:18:33.480 --> 2:18:37.400]  And this all took place during, right. That's the satanic high holiday.
[2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:41.080]  And they believe it and get power off of it. I mean, Newsom literally looks like he's having
[2:18:41.080 --> 2:18:44.800]  an orgasm now when he talks about death. These people are sick.
[2:18:44.800 --> 2:18:51.000]  Well, again, you know, he's off for, you know, murdering babies in the womb, you know, these
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:55.200]  people are, as I said, de facto satanists. It doesn't matter whether you could trace
[2:18:55.200 --> 2:19:01.720]  them to an actual society or organization that officially practices satanism and satanic
[2:19:01.720 --> 2:19:07.000]  practices. It's irrelevant. They're satanists by their actions. They're de facto satanists.
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:11.600]  No, but I totally agree. But to get into their mafias, you have to commit crimes. It's different
[2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:16.760]  uniforms, but it's the same cult. And from my experience, at that level, most of them
[2:19:16.760 --> 2:19:21.640]  actually are devil worshipers. Absolutely. It goes up to that level at
[2:19:21.640 --> 2:19:27.840]  the higher levels. At the level I was involved in, I was not involved in crimes in the occult.
[2:19:27.840 --> 2:19:32.680]  So they didn't care when I wanted to get out. It was like, go do whatever you want. Go tell
[2:19:32.680 --> 2:19:36.880]  people whatever you think you understand. You're not going to be able to hurt us. You
[2:19:36.880 --> 2:19:39.880]  know, unless you actually have committed... Well, what about me, though? They tried to
[2:19:39.880 --> 2:19:43.080]  get me involved in crime right away. They tried to get me involved in crime right away.
[2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:47.000]  Sure. I mean, that's one of the things they'll do to suck people in to have blackmail data
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:51.800]  on them. That's another, that's why they exercise in pedophilia. You know, that's why they engage
[2:19:51.800 --> 2:19:57.360]  in pedophilia. This is all a blackmail, you know, right to get people, you know, basically
[2:19:57.360 --> 2:20:01.520]  doing their bidding. Otherwise, they threaten to expose them and expose their involvement
[2:20:01.520 --> 2:20:07.920]  with children, sexual involvement with children. Yeah. The stuff I saw was nothing new with
[2:20:07.920 --> 2:20:12.320]  children, but it was definitely, definitely some bad stuff. We're going to come right
[2:20:12.320 --> 2:20:17.480]  back and I never got into the Satanism, folks. I was literally lured repeatedly to these things.
[2:20:17.480 --> 2:20:22.800]  I mean, we're talking helicopter pads, the castles, man. I mean, these people have castles
[2:20:22.800 --> 2:20:27.320]  in Texas and it's just like you're like, oh, I want to was a super hot chick and now I'm
[2:20:27.320 --> 2:20:32.840]  at a damn black mass with billionaires and it's crazy. We'll be right back, folks. Stay
[2:20:32.840 --> 2:20:38.040]  with us. It's everywhere. It's a secret invisible empire and exposing it like the sun will burn
[2:20:38.040 --> 2:20:54.080]  up the metaphysical vampires. Mark Pascio is our guest.
[2:20:54.080 --> 2:21:16.860]  Thank you so much.

[2:21:44.440 --> 2:21:45.440]  Now it's official.
[2:21:45.440 --> 2:21:51.320]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years
[2:21:51.320 --> 2:21:56.680]  and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested
[2:21:56.680 --> 2:22:00.960]  because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of ten
[2:22:00.960 --> 2:22:07.240]  people that you visit and if you go outside that list of ten, you'll be permanently detained.
[2:22:07.240 --> 2:22:11.800]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the New World Order where they let the criminals
[2:22:11.800 --> 2:22:18.240]  out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers and where you are now non-essential
[2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:19.440]  and a prisoner.
[2:22:19.440 --> 2:22:23.000]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:24.560]  anti-human group.
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:29.840]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game,
[2:22:29.840 --> 2:22:32.080]  which is global depopulation.
[2:22:32.080 --> 2:22:35.600]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[2:22:35.600 --> 2:22:41.560]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's
[2:22:41.560 --> 2:22:43.000]  mortal enemy.
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:44.320]  Wake up or die.
[2:22:44.320 --> 2:22:49.040]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[2:22:49.040 --> 2:22:52.400]  The globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and they're
[2:22:52.400 --> 2:22:57.640]  like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips, yeah, we're into pedophilia, yeah, we're
[2:22:57.640 --> 2:23:03.560]  into world government, yeah, you're obsolete, you are non-essential, we are shutting your
[2:23:03.560 --> 2:23:04.560]  ass down.
[2:23:04.560 --> 2:23:09.440]  Yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore,
[2:23:09.440 --> 2:23:13.440]  you're going to be the service economy and now the globalists are telling you that there's
[2:23:13.440 --> 2:23:18.000]  no more service economy and you're obsolete so you better bow down to them and get your
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:22.120]  universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[2:23:22.120 --> 2:23:24.760]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[2:23:24.760 --> 2:23:29.160]  We have to resist and say no to the new world order and that takes you understanding you
[2:23:29.160 --> 2:23:33.480]  were right and understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising the
[2:23:33.480 --> 2:23:36.360]  alarm now while you still can.
[2:23:36.360 --> 2:23:38.160]  Now is the time for action.
[2:23:38.160 --> 2:23:47.480]  Now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[2:23:47.480 --> 2:24:02.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:02.080 --> 2:24:05.760]  Old Melinda Gates, he's from Dallas.
[2:24:05.760 --> 2:24:12.760]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:12.760 --> 2:24:17.400]  Their dad was involved in the skunks works and all the rest of it, a lot of other folks,
[2:24:17.400 --> 2:24:27.000]  those aerospace engineers in the club, a lot of them.
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:32.200]  And I never saw her in the run-ins I have these satanists, but we wonder what satanists
[2:24:32.200 --> 2:24:35.960]  look like in Dallas because you couldn't swing a stick in the dark and not hit one.
[2:24:35.960 --> 2:24:44.080]  That's exactly how they dressed, exactly how they looked, but behind the scenes boy.
[2:24:44.080 --> 2:24:47.520]  It's all about how they're cunning, they're smart, they're in charge, they're feeding
[2:24:47.520 --> 2:24:53.560]  on everybody else and it's all just a big joke and they deserve to rule because everybody
[2:24:53.560 --> 2:24:57.320]  else is an idiot, but they engineer things to make you as dumb as possible.
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:02.720]  It's not like they challenge you right up front you know and give you a level playing
[2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:03.720]  field.
[2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:10.640]  I was never in the occult, the occult was everywhere and then you look at what these
[2:25:10.640 --> 2:25:14.840]  people turn into and who they are, they're jokes, they're slaves, they're sucked out.
[2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:19.480]  I didn't run into any of those satanists that were older that weren't absolutely defeated
[2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:26.320]  and destroyed and again only when they're chomping people and posing with the black
[2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:30.440]  babies they want to kill on record, which again is that lesser magic.
[2:25:30.440 --> 2:25:33.040]  Mark Pascio, I can rant all day, it's always great to have you on, we should have you on
[2:25:33.040 --> 2:25:36.320]  for two hours a couple of weeks, I'll fly you down here soon, be in the studio as soon
[2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:40.040]  as hysteria is over, of course we're going to bring it right back, get to the point she
[2:25:40.040 --> 2:25:42.880]  want to make because I've been kind of leading the discussion about the big picture where
[2:25:42.880 --> 2:25:48.280]  we are, the human awakening, how they're going to strike back, how these nests are because
[2:25:48.280 --> 2:25:53.480]  Austin is a cultic, a bit more new agey and sleepy, I haven't run into a lot of real satanists
[2:25:53.480 --> 2:26:00.120]  here, but from your own research it does seem that there are nests of these satanists.
[2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:04.480]  Without a doubt there are certain power centers of control, New York is among the top in the
[2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:09.680]  United States, Pennsylvania is actually a really big one, a little bit west of the Philadelphia
[2:26:09.680 --> 2:26:15.720]  area in a place called Rose Valley, there's places in Delaware that the Duponts have
[2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:20.440]  tremendous influence over that are satanic strongholds, many other places, places in
[2:26:20.440 --> 2:26:26.840]  California, Florida, there's absolutely centers of it, but see I want to sort of shift the
[2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:33.720]  focus away from the controlling class, the ruling class if you will, and get to the real
[2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:38.680]  factors that really drive all of this which is how the average person thinks because the
[2:26:38.680 --> 2:26:43.280]  average person thinks that these people have the right to command us, the average person
[2:26:43.280 --> 2:26:50.240]  believes that the moral right to issue commands that other people must obey because they're
[2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:57.240]  coming from a ruling class called government is somehow morally legitimate and it's not
[2:26:57.240 --> 2:27:01.560]  morally legitimate, our ego is in the way of seeing that, it's in the way of seeing
[2:27:01.560 --> 2:27:05.760]  the simple truth that no one has the right to command other beings and the reason that
[2:27:05.760 --> 2:27:11.680]  people don't see it is they never make the simple fundamental shift of looking at the
[2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:18.160]  behavior from the perspective of themselves, imagine if you were issuing commands the
[2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:23.000]  way these governors in some of these blue states during this so-called pandemic issuing
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:26.160]  commands to other people about their lives.
[2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:29.280]  If one nursing homeowner would have come out and said, you're going to murder all the
[2:27:29.280 --> 2:27:33.280]  people here, that person might have gotten in trouble, but three months later they'd
[2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:37.800]  be the hero and they would have never gotten away with killing all these people.
[2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:43.720]  Well, I mean even more so than that, that's obviously murder what they enacted, no question
[2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:49.880]  about it, but even more so than that just think like would you as an individual if you're
[2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:54.360]  thinking about it from your own perspective of your own behavior, apply the behavior to
[2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:58.520]  yourself, would you have the right to tell everybody to close down their businesses,
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:03.320]  would you have the right to command all people's behaviors and actions, regardless of whether
[2:28:03.320 --> 2:28:06.480]  there's any kind of a spread of disease or not.
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:11.880]  The whole point is we believe that these people have some sort of a right that other people
[2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:12.880]  don't possess.
[2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:17.320]  I totally agree with you, so let me ask you this then and again I agree we should focus
[2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:21.120]  on us and how we can stop complying and that's what the real power is.
[2:28:21.120 --> 2:28:27.040]  But getting back to Melinda Gates, why would she wear an upside down cross ringed in rubies?
[2:28:27.040 --> 2:28:31.120]  What's the symbolism of that because as I said the church of Satan was asking well it's upside
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:36.400]  down cross but that doesn't necessarily mean Satanism, what is this about putting this
[2:28:36.400 --> 2:28:37.600]  out in our face?
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:42.720]  Well, first of all the church of Satan's statement on that is completely disingenuous
[2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:43.960]  and misleading.
[2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:47.680]  It absolutely is a symbol of Satanism, it just isn't a symbol of the church of Satan
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:53.440]  which is a small organization that practices the satanic ideology, that's all.
[2:28:53.440 --> 2:28:58.160]  That does not mean that it's not a satanic symbol, that is like saying a symbol of one
[2:28:58.160 --> 2:29:03.320]  particular church doesn't represent all of Christianity.
[2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:09.520]  The symbol does represent the satanic philosophy and ideology, it's the inversion principle.
[2:29:09.520 --> 2:29:13.640]  This is something that I've covered in my podcast series and in presentations that I've
[2:29:13.640 --> 2:29:14.640]  done.
[2:29:14.640 --> 2:29:18.480]  The inversion principle is that they want to invert morality.
[2:29:18.480 --> 2:29:23.320]  They don't want people to be practicing what is right, what is truly moral.
[2:29:23.320 --> 2:29:25.600]  They want people believing in illusion.
[2:29:25.600 --> 2:29:30.120]  They want people- And the Satanists claim older about human empowerment but now they
[2:29:30.120 --> 2:29:33.720]  want Bill Gates to be able to put something in our body.
[2:29:33.720 --> 2:29:35.200]  It's the ultimate form of rape.
[2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:41.480]  I mean, pushing any foreign substance into someone's body against their will is coercion
[2:29:41.480 --> 2:29:43.120]  and rape ultimately.
[2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:44.120]  That's what it is.
[2:29:44.120 --> 2:29:45.120]  It is the violation of the body.
[2:29:45.120 --> 2:29:46.120]  So why would she do that?
[2:29:46.120 --> 2:29:49.240]  Obviously it's- I think it's a desperate act, I think they're getting weak.
[2:29:49.240 --> 2:29:54.240]  No, they're getting off on the fact that people can't see that they're Satanists.
[2:29:54.240 --> 2:29:55.240]  That's what it is.
[2:29:55.240 --> 2:30:00.480]  It's flaunting the very symbology of their religion in front of people and the average
[2:30:00.480 --> 2:30:05.320]  person is a complete dope that cannot understand what they are even seeing in front of their
[2:30:05.320 --> 2:30:06.320]  eyes.
[2:30:06.320 --> 2:30:07.320]  So what is the ritual counting to?
[2:30:07.320 --> 2:30:12.080]  I mean, are they doing it because it's a lesser magic, what do you think?
[2:30:12.080 --> 2:30:13.080]  It's part of a ritual.
[2:30:13.080 --> 2:30:15.140]  Yeah, it's a ritual of mockery.
[2:30:15.140 --> 2:30:19.800]  This is the mockery of the cattle, the mockery of the human sheep, of the human herd.
[2:30:19.800 --> 2:30:25.480]  They're flaunting the symbol of their religious belief system right in front of the average
[2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:31.920]  person who has absolutely no idea what it means because they're symbolically illiterate
[2:30:31.920 --> 2:30:36.440]  and cannot understand that that is a symbol of worldwide Satanism and it represents the
[2:30:36.440 --> 2:30:41.560]  inversion principles, the inversion of right and wrong, the inversion of good and evil,
[2:30:41.560 --> 2:30:42.560]  the inversion of God.
[2:30:42.560 --> 2:30:43.720]  And why do they always inverse?
[2:30:43.720 --> 2:30:44.720]  They don't just twist.
[2:30:44.720 --> 2:30:46.120]  They love to totally invert.
[2:30:46.120 --> 2:30:52.120]  Right, because they're trying to replace the laws of the creator of the universe, the
[2:30:52.120 --> 2:30:54.840]  laws of God with their law.
[2:30:54.840 --> 2:30:56.440]  Why are they so pissed at God?
[2:30:56.440 --> 2:31:01.280]  Because when you get into God and the universe, it's so much more powerful they can even imagine.
[2:31:01.280 --> 2:31:07.940]  Their worldview is that the universe itself is a prison because laws exist to bring negative
[2:31:07.940 --> 2:31:11.200]  consequence to immoral behavior.
[2:31:11.200 --> 2:31:15.680]  And because that law is in effect in the universe and can never be taken out of effect in the
[2:31:15.680 --> 2:31:20.880]  universe because it was put there by the creator of the universe, the people who want to break
[2:31:20.880 --> 2:31:27.040]  that law with impunity, meaning with absolutely no consequence enacted upon themselves, believe
[2:31:27.040 --> 2:31:33.520]  that the universe is a prison and are raging against the natural law that governs the behavior
[2:31:33.520 --> 2:31:34.520]  of the universe.
[2:31:34.520 --> 2:31:36.960]  Which by the way, all these big tech millionaires are on record saying, we now believe there's
[2:31:36.960 --> 2:31:39.880]  other dimensions, something's holding us here, let's break out.
[2:31:39.880 --> 2:31:44.600]  And they think the silicon virtual hell they built, they're advertising that as the new
[2:31:44.600 --> 2:31:46.280]  reality.
[2:31:46.280 --> 2:31:51.480]  They believe natural law, which is the moral laws of the universe, the moral spiritual laws
[2:31:51.480 --> 2:31:58.760]  of the universe that bring positive consequence to moral behavior and negative consequence
[2:31:58.760 --> 2:32:00.600]  to immoral behavior.
[2:32:00.600 --> 2:32:05.120]  Not all at once, not just on the individual level, but on the aggregate societal level,
[2:32:05.120 --> 2:32:06.120]  on the global level.
[2:32:06.120 --> 2:32:10.560]  The real galactic intergalactic universal credit score.
[2:32:10.560 --> 2:32:11.880]  It's universal karma.
[2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:17.800]  It's how karma truly works, not the cartoon or Hollywood version of karma.
[2:32:17.800 --> 2:32:23.200]  It's how it really works on a societal scale, which is one of the big parts of my work talking
[2:32:23.200 --> 2:32:24.200]  about natural law.
[2:32:24.200 --> 2:32:29.000]  And so that's like Faust and all of it, they're trying to escape karma, they can't do that.
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:34.600]  It's an impossibility, but they are essentially insulating themselves as much as possible
[2:32:34.600 --> 2:32:40.280]  from negative karma consequence by getting the order followers, namely the police and
[2:32:40.280 --> 2:32:41.280]  military.
[2:32:41.280 --> 2:32:45.000]  They need to trick us to acquiesce because they believe they escape a lot of the karma
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:46.680]  by not forcing us.
[2:32:46.680 --> 2:32:53.720]  They have escaped a lot of the karma, not by not quote unquote forcing us, but by telling
[2:32:53.720 --> 2:32:58.200]  the police and military to do their bidding and they say, yes, sir, I'll do that for the
[2:32:58.200 --> 2:32:59.200]  nation.
[2:32:59.200 --> 2:33:01.720]  And then they all go commit suicide or their kids all die because they get the karma.
[2:33:01.720 --> 2:33:07.000]  They go and do the negative behavior, the wrongdoings, the actual immoral behavior and
[2:33:07.000 --> 2:33:11.240]  the karma consequence comes heavily down upon them and they don't understand it.
[2:33:11.240 --> 2:33:15.440]  Because they are unstudied in the rule in the laws of karma or in natural law.
[2:33:15.440 --> 2:33:16.440]  They don't understand.
[2:33:16.440 --> 2:33:17.680]  And by the way, it's the real law.
[2:33:17.680 --> 2:33:23.400]  I mean, it's 100% real, like like a baseball bat upside your head and people need to get
[2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:24.400]  that straight man.
[2:33:24.400 --> 2:33:25.400]  What comes around goes around.
[2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:30.320]  What you do is going to get you whether you believe it was right or wrong, God knows what's
[2:33:30.320 --> 2:33:31.320]  right wrong.
[2:33:31.320 --> 2:33:32.760]  So you better be really safe.
[2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:35.120]  Mark Pascio is on fire today.
[2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:36.120]  We're coming right back.
[2:33:36.120 --> 2:33:37.120]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:53.840]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[2:33:53.840 --> 2:34:01.600]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[2:34:01.600 --> 2:34:08.640]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[2:34:08.640 --> 2:34:09.640]  in males.
[2:34:09.640 --> 2:34:15.600]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:20.440]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[2:34:20.440 --> 2:34:27.840]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:33.120]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:34.440]  So what are you waiting for?
[2:34:34.440 --> 2:34:36.480]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[2:34:36.480 --> 2:34:39.360]  Never been a better time than right now.
[2:34:39.360 --> 2:34:43.560]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:34:43.560 --> 2:34:46.120]  I'm always excited about InfoWars live products.
[2:34:46.120 --> 2:34:47.120]  They're amazing.
[2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:48.120]  They're cutting edge.
[2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:49.120]  You love them.
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:50.120]  I love them.
[2:34:50.120 --> 2:34:52.160]  And they find the InfoWars in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[2:34:52.160 --> 2:34:58.760]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[2:34:58.760 --> 2:35:06.520]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[2:35:06.520 --> 2:35:08.840]  And there's another innovation.
[2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:10.840]  It's the spray cap.
[2:35:10.840 --> 2:35:17.040]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes
[2:35:17.040 --> 2:35:18.400]  it in a really great way.
[2:35:18.400 --> 2:35:22.920]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face, it's got organic alcohol in
[2:35:22.920 --> 2:35:24.440]  it, so spray it right in your eyes.
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:26.040]  But I just love it.
[2:35:26.040 --> 2:35:28.800]  Personally, it has something that's a moisturizer as well.
[2:35:28.800 --> 2:35:30.560]  So this is a real innovation.
[2:35:30.560 --> 2:35:34.640]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[2:35:34.640 --> 2:35:38.480]  essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[2:35:38.480 --> 2:35:40.400]  It's so refreshing.
[2:35:40.400 --> 2:35:46.680]  This is a big winner.
[2:35:46.680 --> 2:35:51.520]  We're living in insanely dangerous times, and I told folks going back three months ago,
[2:35:51.520 --> 2:35:54.920]  I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[2:35:54.920 --> 2:35:57.880]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:36:02.320]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages
[2:36:02.320 --> 2:36:06.000]  and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States, and it's even worse in
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  the third world.
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:09.720]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[2:36:09.720 --> 2:36:14.720]  But with the election fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing
[2:36:14.720 --> 2:36:18.920]  and everything else is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll
[2:36:18.920 --> 2:36:20.440]  last for 25 years.
[2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:22.440]  They're in easily totable bags.
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:25.960]  It's high-quality food, and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready.
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:26.960]  And it funds the InfoWars.
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:32.960]  So we have storeable food available again, InfoWarsTour.com or call toll-free, AAA-253-3139.
[2:36:32.960 --> 2:36:36.360]  Whatever you do, get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent
[2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:37.360]  on them.
[2:36:37.360 --> 2:36:38.440]  They do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[2:36:38.440 --> 2:36:43.440]  Get your storeable food at InfoWarsTour.com right now while you still can.
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:49.360]  I was talking to my wife tonight, and I was saying, our economy slowing down and shutting
[2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:54.200]  down is like shooting a deer, and it runs 100 yards before it knows it's been shot,
[2:36:54.200 --> 2:36:55.200]  and then it finally dies.
[2:36:55.200 --> 2:37:00.000]  She said, well, yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an argument in
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:04.560]  the street, and another man shot another man in the head, and the man that got shot in
[2:37:04.560 --> 2:37:08.920]  the head had blood pouring out, a huge hole, and he was holding it, and he walked around
[2:37:08.920 --> 2:37:13.680]  gibbering, talking nonsense for about 60 seconds, and then just fell over dead.
[2:37:13.680 --> 2:37:16.600]  Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy.
[2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:18.600]  It is in cardiac arrest.
[2:37:18.600 --> 2:37:23.720]  This has been done by design, and the UN, the Chai Coms, the mainstream media orchestrated
[2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:26.840]  it, hyped it, and tried to keep the economy closed.
[2:37:26.840 --> 2:37:31.480]  So remember, the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:37.640]  UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats.
[2:37:37.640 --> 2:37:41.240]  We tried to stop it, we tried to fight it, but you guys have said you wanted to wreck
[2:37:41.240 --> 2:37:44.640]  America and the world, and now you've done it.
[2:37:44.640 --> 2:37:47.640]  Congratulations.
[2:37:47.640 --> 2:37:52.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:37:52.640 --> 2:38:05.400]  Oh, we're told July 4th is canceled now because of COVID, but there's just one death that
[2:38:05.400 --> 2:38:07.120]  will cancel everything forever.
[2:38:07.120 --> 2:38:08.120]  Mark Graham was here.
[2:38:08.120 --> 2:38:12.560]  They've only launched these attacks because they're weak, and they could feel their controls
[2:38:12.560 --> 2:38:22.680]  slipping away with the eyes of Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, and Thoros, and I see losers.
[2:38:22.680 --> 2:38:28.640]  Mark Passio of What on Earth is Happening.com, talk show host, authors here with us.
[2:38:28.640 --> 2:38:32.960]  I've been asking a lot of questions the last 45 minutes or so, so in the final segment
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:35.800]  here, I want to have you back soon to get into the occult itself, and I don't want to
[2:38:35.800 --> 2:38:39.400]  focus on the enemy all day, but people are just now figuring out this is real, Mark.
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:44.400]  So we have to explain who the bad guys are in my experience, people to get how we can
[2:38:44.400 --> 2:38:45.400]  become the good guys.
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:48.640]  But in the 10 minutes we have left, without me asking questions, what else do you want
[2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:49.640]  to tell folks?
[2:38:49.640 --> 2:38:56.080]  Well, I would say, first of all, really, you have to learn how the science of natural
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:38:57.080]  law works.
[2:38:57.080 --> 2:39:00.360]  I have a documentary coming out on the topic pretty soon.
[2:39:00.360 --> 2:39:01.880]  It's in production right now.
[2:39:01.880 --> 2:39:05.680]  We're probably going to release it, certainly by the end of the year, hopefully even sooner
[2:39:05.680 --> 2:39:06.800]  than that.
[2:39:06.800 --> 2:39:10.960]  But we're going to be, it's an outreach documentary.
[2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:17.040]  It's an educational documentary about how natural law is a science.
[2:39:17.040 --> 2:39:22.880]  We have to make the discovery of how this works, because it's not about a belief system.
[2:39:22.880 --> 2:39:24.480]  No, it's bigger than fire.
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:26.080]  It's the laws of the universe.
[2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:27.960]  It's the matrix code.
[2:39:27.960 --> 2:39:29.520]  This is what they're hiding from us.
[2:39:29.520 --> 2:39:36.640]  This is what this satanic cabal that is operating as a covert network worldwide is hiding from
[2:39:36.640 --> 2:39:37.960]  the human species.
[2:39:37.960 --> 2:39:45.720]  They're hiding the understanding of natural law, which is the cosmic spiritual moral law
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:52.600]  that exists in the universe, in creation, that ultimately governs the consequences of
[2:39:52.600 --> 2:39:54.280]  our behavioral choices.
[2:39:54.280 --> 2:39:55.840]  We're given free will.
[2:39:55.840 --> 2:39:59.640]  It's the random component of creation is free will.
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:03.200]  We are given free will to behave in the ways that we choose to behave.
[2:40:03.200 --> 2:40:07.680]  However, there are laws that are the deterministic component of creation.
[2:40:07.680 --> 2:40:10.840]  See, the universe is neither random nor deterministic.
[2:40:10.840 --> 2:40:12.320]  It's a blending of both.
[2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:17.680]  We're given free will to choose our behaviors, but then there are laws that ultimately give
[2:40:17.680 --> 2:40:21.600]  us the consequences of those behaviors in the long term.
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:27.640]  And if we learn how the law works, we can intelligently inform our decision-making
[2:40:27.640 --> 2:40:30.920]  and therefore choose our behavior wisely.
[2:40:30.920 --> 2:40:34.640]  That's how the universe, that's how our experience is ultimately built.
[2:40:34.640 --> 2:40:38.640]  That's how we build our, we co-create as human beings our shared reality.
[2:40:38.640 --> 2:40:39.640]  Exactly.
[2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:44.080]  We made the little G image of God for somebody to interject here.
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:50.800]  How do you deal with the issue of people that are just feeling completely cut off from this?
[2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:53.800]  I have discernment about what's right and wrong.
[2:40:53.800 --> 2:40:57.000]  It's not like I'm afraid to do something bad because I know about these laws.
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:40:59.520]  I feel it.
[2:40:59.520 --> 2:41:00.800]  Other people seem to be missing that.
[2:41:00.800 --> 2:41:02.360]  I'm not trying to be elitist here.
[2:41:02.360 --> 2:41:04.640]  I feel it very strong as I get older.
[2:41:04.640 --> 2:41:06.080]  I just always go with the gut now.
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:07.080]  It's never wrong.
[2:41:07.080 --> 2:41:08.080]  It's like magic.
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:11.920]  Other people don't even seem to have the gut or they just are cut off from it.
[2:41:11.920 --> 2:41:15.640]  They are cut off from what I would call true spirituality.
[2:41:15.640 --> 2:41:18.920]  They don't have a form of spirituality in their lives.
[2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:20.880]  This isn't about religious dogma.
[2:41:20.880 --> 2:41:22.960]  It's about the development of the self.
[2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:27.000]  It's about development of true self-respect and courage.
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:31.320]  The people who are cut off from that power and that force that is ultimately the power
[2:41:31.320 --> 2:41:36.160]  of creation, they don't have any sense of spirituality or self-respect or courage in
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:38.480]  their life.
[2:41:38.480 --> 2:41:43.200]  They're huddling under the staircase in the kingdom of the self.
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:44.200]  They don't understand.
[2:41:44.200 --> 2:41:48.040]  That's why they act so arrogant because they're really scared.
[2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:49.200]  That's fear.
[2:41:49.200 --> 2:41:52.920]  Their consciousness is ultimately driven by fear.
[2:41:52.920 --> 2:41:57.240]  And again, as I talked about the last time I was on the show, what is fear ultimately
[2:41:57.240 --> 2:41:58.440]  based upon?
[2:41:58.440 --> 2:42:02.960]  Fear is based upon ignorance, the refusal of truth, the refusal of knowledge.
[2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:05.480]  We fear that which we don't understand.
[2:42:05.480 --> 2:42:08.760]  We don't understand something because we're remaining in ignorance of the truth.
[2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:11.160]  So when people hear this, they know it's the truth.
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:13.520]  You know prima facia.
[2:42:13.520 --> 2:42:15.000]  Truth instills courage.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.960]  The intake of truth ultimately builds courage.
[2:42:17.960 --> 2:42:21.400]  The more truth you take, the more courage and self-respect you're going to build.
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:24.120]  And that's how spirituality is built.
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:29.160]  That is exactly how spirituality is built because that ultimately dispels fear by dispelling
[2:42:29.160 --> 2:42:31.840]  ignorance and bringing knowledge into oneself.
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:38.240]  In the New Testament, Jesus himself, when the disciples asked him in the biblical allegory,
[2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:44.760]  how could we become free of the tyrannical rule of the Romans, he said, know the truth
[2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:46.400]  and the truth will set you free.
[2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:47.920]  What truth is he referring to?
[2:42:47.920 --> 2:42:51.560]  He's referring to the truth about the laws of the Creator of the universe, the laws
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:53.360]  of morality, natural law.
[2:42:53.360 --> 2:42:56.600]  Well, it's like when they try to trick you with the whole money changer deal and he's
[2:42:56.600 --> 2:42:58.400]  like, give the Caesar what Caesar.
[2:42:58.400 --> 2:43:00.520]  He's also saying, that's their system.
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:01.520]  That does belong to them.
[2:43:01.520 --> 2:43:03.440]  You've got to build your own systems.
[2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:04.440]  He was basic.
[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:05.440]  That's an insult.
[2:43:05.440 --> 2:43:09.560]  He was basically saying, when he said render to Caesar what Caesar is, he's saying, this
[2:43:09.560 --> 2:43:10.560]  is crap.
[2:43:10.560 --> 2:43:11.800]  Let it go with crap.
[2:43:11.800 --> 2:43:13.080]  That's basically what he was saying.
[2:43:13.080 --> 2:43:19.400]  He's like, this is a total illusory junk and let the people who believe in that have it.
[2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:20.400]  That's what he was saying.
[2:43:20.400 --> 2:43:21.400]  It was an insult to it.
[2:43:21.400 --> 2:43:25.040]  It wasn't giving credence to it in that allegory.
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:29.680]  So how does the Hollywood, you're making great points, I'll stop it or I'll go ahead.
[2:43:29.680 --> 2:43:35.680]  No, I mean, what we just have to really understand is that the development of the soul is what
[2:43:35.680 --> 2:43:42.080]  we are here to work upon, the understanding of how the laws of the Creator function.
[2:43:42.080 --> 2:43:45.080]  That's what our goal is to do in this life.
[2:43:45.080 --> 2:43:51.800]  We are here to learn and to grow in consciousness and to understand, to discover and live in
[2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:56.760]  harmony with the natural law of morality, the natural laws of morality.
[2:43:56.760 --> 2:43:57.760]  We're not doing that.
[2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:00.800]  Because God built us for fellowship.
[2:44:00.800 --> 2:44:01.800]  That's right.
[2:44:01.800 --> 2:44:02.800]  That's right.
[2:44:02.800 --> 2:44:04.120]  That's what true communion really is.
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:08.920]  It's getting in touch with those first principles and they are moral principles.
[2:44:08.920 --> 2:44:12.520]  If you ask yourself all you have to do to understand the human condition, ladies and
[2:44:12.520 --> 2:44:16.720]  gentlemen, is just ask yourself how many people are truly doing that in their lives
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:19.240]  versus how many people couldn't give a damn.
[2:44:19.240 --> 2:44:20.440]  They don't care.
[2:44:20.440 --> 2:44:21.840]  They've given up on any of that.
[2:44:21.840 --> 2:44:23.560]  They are not looking into anything deeper.
[2:44:23.560 --> 2:44:25.480]  They're not working on the development of their soul.
[2:44:25.480 --> 2:44:26.480]  That's who's dead.
[2:44:26.480 --> 2:44:28.760]  They're like machines.
[2:44:28.760 --> 2:44:30.720]  That's what the Darko cult call them, Alex.
[2:44:30.720 --> 2:44:33.240]  They call the people who they rule the dead.
[2:44:33.240 --> 2:44:38.880]  That is their name for the average human being that knows nothing, doesn't care about anything.
[2:44:38.880 --> 2:44:41.160]  You know, doesn't take any action, doesn't have any courage.
[2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:42.160]  They call them dead.
[2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:43.160]  They live.
[2:44:43.160 --> 2:44:44.160]  We sleep.
[2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:45.160]  That's right.
[2:44:45.160 --> 2:44:46.160]  That is exactly what they refer to.
[2:44:46.160 --> 2:44:48.160]  So how does the sleeper awaken?
[2:44:48.160 --> 2:44:50.480]  Because I know our audience is awake.
[2:44:50.480 --> 2:44:51.480]  Some of them are more than us.
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:52.560]  Others are all different ways.
[2:44:52.560 --> 2:44:54.480]  But what about the lost sheep?
[2:44:54.480 --> 2:44:57.000]  I mean, is it bad to even spend time on them?
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:44:58.880]  Because more and more I just...
[2:44:58.880 --> 2:45:06.520]  I put together a program in a very stepwise progression, a very, very slow proceeding
[2:45:06.520 --> 2:45:12.240]  unfolding of information to do this in a way that people with a very...
[2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:15.600]  Remember, I've learned you're very good to get unawake people really awake.
[2:45:15.600 --> 2:45:16.600]  It's good how you do it.
[2:45:16.600 --> 2:45:17.600]  So explain it.
[2:45:17.600 --> 2:45:18.600]  Tell them that.
[2:45:18.600 --> 2:45:19.600]  Thank you.
[2:45:19.600 --> 2:45:20.600]  I appreciate you saying that.
[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:25.160]  Yeah, I put together a stepwise progression of information that would take people from
[2:45:25.160 --> 2:45:30.840]  very low level basic understanding and build their understanding up and up and up to really
[2:45:30.840 --> 2:45:33.900]  understand natural law at a pretty high level.
[2:45:33.900 --> 2:45:36.080]  And I did that in my podcast series.
[2:45:36.080 --> 2:45:40.160]  The bulk of my work on my website is in my audio, actually.
[2:45:40.160 --> 2:45:45.040]  The podcast series, if you click on the podcast tab in the middle of the page, in the middle
[2:45:45.040 --> 2:45:49.840]  of the tabs, that is where all of the bulk of the material is at, okay?
[2:45:49.840 --> 2:45:55.160]  Now, when you click it, they're listed in reverse chronological order, the newest first.
[2:45:55.160 --> 2:46:00.080]  There's a red link up at the top of that page that you can click to go in order from number
[2:46:00.080 --> 2:46:01.080]  one forward.
[2:46:01.080 --> 2:46:04.040]  God, it's almost a start at number one.
[2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:08.600]  If you click that red link that says you should start at number one, that'll take it.
[2:46:08.600 --> 2:46:09.600]  There you go.
[2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:13.680]  And then you start at number one and you go forward in this progression in this podcast
[2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:14.680]  series.
[2:46:14.680 --> 2:46:16.920]  And I can tell you, folks, because I've watched what Mark does.
[2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:17.920]  He knows what he's talking about.
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:18.920]  They cannot stand this.
[2:46:18.920 --> 2:46:22.720]  Because a lot of us, and I'm telling the honest, we're not on a power trip that just
[2:46:22.720 --> 2:46:23.720]  are born like this.
[2:46:23.720 --> 2:46:24.720]  We already know all this.
[2:46:24.720 --> 2:46:25.720]  We're like, okay, yeah, we already know this.
[2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:27.040]  Most people don't know this, folks.
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:31.400]  You need to get them a progression of training wheels, and then Mark, it's really advanced.
[2:46:31.400 --> 2:46:33.880]  It's really intelligent stuff he breaks down.
[2:46:33.880 --> 2:46:37.400]  They made a big mistake by telling me to do my very worst.
[2:46:37.400 --> 2:46:38.640]  Let's put it that way.
[2:46:38.640 --> 2:46:41.960]  Because this will wake people up if they go through all that information.
[2:46:41.960 --> 2:46:44.240]  It's a tremendous amount of information.
[2:46:44.240 --> 2:46:49.520]  You have to take your time and you have to go through it at your own pace, okay?
[2:46:49.520 --> 2:46:50.520]  And don't skip around.
[2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:54.720]  What you're saying is somebody that was deep in a darker cult, you found the truth by going
[2:46:54.720 --> 2:46:59.360]  away from that and like, it's all right there and it's all just exposes their whole system.
[2:46:59.360 --> 2:47:03.640]  I recognize the truth when I recognize that the people who were in Satanism in the darker
[2:47:03.640 --> 2:47:07.320]  cult were really the rulers of society and wanted to enslave everyone.
[2:47:07.320 --> 2:47:08.320]  I made that record.
[2:47:08.320 --> 2:47:09.320]  Yeah, it's so simple.
[2:47:09.320 --> 2:47:10.320]  They're causing the problems.
[2:47:10.320 --> 2:47:11.320]  They claim they're empowering us.
[2:47:11.320 --> 2:47:13.160]  No, you're not.
[2:47:13.160 --> 2:47:17.480]  And I never wanted to get involved in the occult for slavery, to enslave all of us.
[2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:18.480]  You wanted to find stuff out.
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:22.440]  I wanted to get involved in the occult because I was very egoic in my youth and I wanted
[2:47:22.440 --> 2:47:26.440]  an advantage over my fellow human being and I knew that they had hidden knowledge that
[2:47:26.440 --> 2:47:31.120]  can give one an advantage if you were in an egoic mind state wanted to do that.
[2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:32.720]  And I was at that time.
[2:47:32.720 --> 2:47:37.560]  You know, I've come out of that egoic mindset and realized that it is my moral responsibility
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:40.040]  knowing what I know to help to educate others.
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:42.560]  And you have to do that through technological means.
[2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:44.480]  You have to reach out to people online.
[2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:49.160]  You have to get it to places that you can get it uncensored, get uncensored information
[2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:50.160]  like...
[2:47:50.160 --> 2:47:51.640]  Well, yeah, there's that, Ezekiel talks about the fire and the bones.
[2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:54.760]  If you don't have a drive to warn people, then you're with the bad guys because they
[2:47:54.760 --> 2:47:55.760]  laugh.
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:47:56.760]  I don't care.
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:47:57.760]  I don't care about anybody.
[2:47:57.760 --> 2:47:58.760]  They get off that.
[2:47:58.760 --> 2:47:59.760]  They don't care.
[2:47:59.760 --> 2:48:03.080]  What I don't want to be with God is there's a responsibility of the law.
[2:48:03.080 --> 2:48:06.720]  Then now you're completely driven and it's very empowering, but then it's like a...
[2:48:06.720 --> 2:48:11.040]  It's not a bad whip, but it's like constant, like, you're gonna fight these people around.
[2:48:11.040 --> 2:48:12.280]  And then it's total war.
[2:48:12.280 --> 2:48:14.520]  All right, Mark Passio, powerful hour.
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:15.800]  Come back and join us again soon.
[2:48:15.800 --> 2:48:16.800]  Thank you.
[2:48:16.800 --> 2:48:17.800]  Absolutely.
[2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:18.800]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:48:18.800 --> 2:48:19.800]  Thank you.
[2:48:19.800 --> 2:48:22.840]  The only way we fund this is the t-shirts, the books, the films, the supplements.
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:24.400]  Got that big sell about to end.
[2:48:24.400 --> 2:48:25.560]  It's great products you already need.
[2:48:25.560 --> 2:48:27.000]  So get them if you want them to support us.
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  All right.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  I promise to take your calls.
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:34.640]  That's Rudy, Paul, Dave, Wendy, and then...
[2:48:34.640 --> 2:48:36.880]  This is the end, my friends.
[2:48:36.880 --> 2:48:42.760]  My only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of everything that stands,
[2:48:42.760 --> 2:48:47.400]  the end, the safety, the delusion.
[2:48:47.400 --> 2:48:52.680]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because it was only the mirage of safety.
[2:48:52.680 --> 2:48:57.760]  Movies and partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other
[2:48:57.760 --> 2:48:59.200]  people.
[2:48:59.200 --> 2:49:04.160]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny, just like the history books show us, just
[2:49:04.160 --> 2:49:05.800]  like the Bible states.
[2:49:05.800 --> 2:49:10.040]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought
[2:49:10.040 --> 2:49:15.800]  into captivity because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated
[2:49:15.800 --> 2:49:18.800]  by spies, and then they were enslaved.
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:24.480]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:26.960]  absolute bondage.
[2:49:26.960 --> 2:49:29.640]  Info wars has decided to fight for freedom.
[2:49:29.640 --> 2:49:34.600]  Info wars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[2:49:34.600 --> 2:49:40.400]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles, and when you shoot
[2:49:40.400 --> 2:49:45.440]  an elk at, say, 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run
[2:49:45.440 --> 2:49:49.480]  50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards.
[2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:54.040]  They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins, but
[2:49:54.040 --> 2:49:59.400]  all of a sudden, they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over and they die.
[2:49:59.400 --> 2:50:02.440]  Then you go back and haul them back in.
[2:50:02.440 --> 2:50:07.360]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now, and that's what the economic
[2:50:07.360 --> 2:50:13.440]  numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart, and for the first world, it's
[2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:16.880]  going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:20.320]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according
[2:50:20.320 --> 2:50:24.680]  to the UN, and I believe they're numbers, because it's the very UN that's orchestrated
[2:50:24.680 --> 2:50:27.080]  this to depopulate the third world.
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:30.240]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're
[2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:37.640]  a bunch of suckers, and you bought into something better than what Hitler did.
[2:50:37.640 --> 2:50:41.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:50:41.640 --> 2:50:48.360]  All right, I really appreciate the callers holding.
[2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:54.120]  We had that great guest on earlier, we talked to Alex, Rudy, Paul and Wendy, and then he's
[2:50:54.120 --> 2:50:58.560]  always great, but he's really been pissed the last few months, he's been on fire.
[2:50:58.560 --> 2:51:02.480]  All our guests were on fire, that's why we had mine.
[2:51:02.480 --> 2:51:10.000]  Let's go to your phone calls right now before John Robbaport takes over.
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:15.200]  Alex in Michigan, one of the epicenters, it's kind of boxy moronic, one of the main tremor
[2:51:15.200 --> 2:51:19.640]  points, I guess New York is the epicenter, but it's a horrible center of murdering all
[2:51:19.640 --> 2:51:21.440]  people consciously.
[2:51:21.440 --> 2:51:27.800]  What is your view on the death home, the euthanasia, the COVID-19 execution centers that the evil
[2:51:27.800 --> 2:51:29.280]  governor set up?
[2:51:29.280 --> 2:51:31.360]  Oh, Michigan's great.
[2:51:31.360 --> 2:51:37.960]  My grandparents went to a nursing home in January, my grandpa died in February.
[2:51:37.960 --> 2:51:46.000]  My grandma's birthday was a few weeks ago and we had to wave to her outside, to her window,
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:50.800]  and there were clearly nursing home workers flying on us to make sure we were properly
[2:51:50.800 --> 2:51:51.800]  social distancing.
[2:51:51.800 --> 2:51:54.800]  There was about 15 of us.
[2:51:54.800 --> 2:51:55.800]  I'm sorry.
[2:51:55.800 --> 2:51:56.800]  Oh yeah.
[2:51:56.800 --> 2:51:57.800]  It's sick.
[2:51:57.800 --> 2:52:02.880]  I mean, they premeditatedly murdered all these people, and if we don't stand up for them,
[2:52:02.880 --> 2:52:03.880]  it's on us.
[2:52:03.880 --> 2:52:09.160]  I'm not just saying that to be dramatic, folks, I'm literally, there better be indictments
[2:52:09.160 --> 2:52:11.640]  is all I'm telling the FBI and everybody else.
[2:52:11.640 --> 2:52:14.480]  You claim you're good government that act like it.
[2:52:14.480 --> 2:52:18.680]  Trump needs to go on the offense and start indictments that he has the blue states.
[2:52:18.680 --> 2:52:22.680]  They go, oh, Fauci told us, arrest that little son of a bitch.
[2:52:22.680 --> 2:52:28.000]  Yeah, I'm not trying to be like that.
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  I'm just being honest.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  Let me tell you something.
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:36.280]  I've been Vick Fauci or any of these people for this, that he needs to hang from his neck
[2:52:36.280 --> 2:52:37.280]  until dead.
[2:52:37.280 --> 2:52:39.280]  I forgets to go ahead.
[2:52:39.280 --> 2:52:44.200]  I'm spreading so much info or information right now.
[2:52:44.200 --> 2:52:45.800]  I work at a hotel.
[2:52:45.800 --> 2:52:50.480]  I got employees a month, three weeks ago, which involves my picture being taken and
[2:52:50.480 --> 2:52:53.840]  put in on the wall behind the front desk.
[2:52:53.840 --> 2:52:57.160]  My name happens to be Alex Jones.
[2:52:57.160 --> 2:53:00.920]  So I am and put on my Alex Jones did nothing wrong.
[2:53:00.920 --> 2:53:01.920]  Sure.
[2:53:01.920 --> 2:53:02.920]  They took a picture of it.
[2:53:02.920 --> 2:53:08.280]  It is now behind the front desk and I believe you don't get in trouble where you're at,
[2:53:08.280 --> 2:53:12.400]  but send me a photo of that and I will have you as a guest on the show.
[2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:13.400]  I love that.
[2:53:13.400 --> 2:53:14.400]  Alex Jones.
[2:53:14.400 --> 2:53:15.400]  All right.
[2:53:15.400 --> 2:53:16.400]  Alex.
[2:53:16.400 --> 2:53:17.400]  So awesome.
[2:53:17.400 --> 2:53:18.920]  How's the Jones family up there in Michigan?
[2:53:18.920 --> 2:53:20.400]  How you guys doing?
[2:53:20.400 --> 2:53:23.120]  Oh, well, I was raised Mormon.
[2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:29.360]  A lot of my family is Mormon and you've been talking about the book of revelations recently
[2:53:29.360 --> 2:53:33.000]  and you, well, apparently we need some earthquakes to happen.
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:38.120]  This happened late March and there's so much going on that I don't think anyone noticed.
[2:53:38.120 --> 2:53:41.680]  There was an earthquake in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[2:53:41.680 --> 2:53:43.680]  It was big for that area and then a week later.
[2:53:43.680 --> 2:53:44.680]  It was the biggest ever.
[2:53:44.680 --> 2:53:45.680]  Yeah.
[2:53:45.680 --> 2:53:46.680]  Like a four point something, right?
[2:53:46.680 --> 2:53:53.400]  But it didn't fully damage the main temple of the Mormons, but it knocked the trumpet
[2:53:53.400 --> 2:53:57.280]  off of Angel Moroni, which is on top of every temple.
[2:53:57.280 --> 2:54:04.960]  And if you look up what that symbolizes, he's trumpeting in the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[2:54:04.960 --> 2:54:07.840]  So some Mormons are kind of losing it right now.
[2:54:07.840 --> 2:54:09.920]  No, I hear you.
[2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:11.600]  It's definitely a crazy time to be alive.
[2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:15.920]  Well, Alex will put you on hold and let's see if we can get a photo of that.
[2:54:15.920 --> 2:54:19.280]  We're not where you work, but just, I want to see Alex Jones, nothing wrong employee
[2:54:19.280 --> 2:54:20.280]  of the month.
[2:54:20.280 --> 2:54:21.280]  That would be really, really cool.
[2:54:21.280 --> 2:54:22.280]  Yeah.
[2:54:22.280 --> 2:54:25.440]  You know, Alex Jones, when I was named Alex Jones in 1974, was not a common name.
[2:54:25.440 --> 2:54:26.440]  Jones is very common.
[2:54:26.440 --> 2:54:30.960]  Alex was not a common name that year, but about 50, 20 years later, it became a very
[2:54:30.960 --> 2:54:32.520]  popular name for a decade.
[2:54:32.520 --> 2:54:36.320]  So there's like 20 Alex Joneses in town now.
[2:54:36.320 --> 2:54:40.120]  And man, I had one call me up and he said, can you stop them coming to my house in North
[2:54:40.120 --> 2:54:41.120]  Austin?
[2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:45.480]  They get death threats, visitors, people, fans, folks.
[2:54:45.480 --> 2:54:46.840]  I don't live at that address.
[2:54:46.840 --> 2:54:49.560]  I never live at that address up in North Austin.
[2:54:49.560 --> 2:54:53.800]  I feel so, but it's like, I'm like, hey dude, your name, Alex Jones.
[2:54:53.800 --> 2:54:56.560]  So, but like you think Google's so accurate.
[2:54:56.560 --> 2:55:02.080]  It's like, oh, look, you know, the dirt, whatever.com, whatever the site is, it has Alex Jones's
[2:55:02.080 --> 2:55:03.080]  house.
[2:55:03.080 --> 2:55:06.360]  Here's a luxury 1.5 million dollar house.
[2:55:06.360 --> 2:55:07.360]  Here's his pool.
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:10.040]  Don't live there.
[2:55:10.040 --> 2:55:15.240]  And I, so it's a good cover though in the cyber world that there are like 20 something
[2:55:15.240 --> 2:55:16.240]  Alex Joneses in town.
[2:55:16.240 --> 2:55:17.240]  But it's always growing.
[2:55:17.240 --> 2:55:19.240]  Actually, there's like more than that now.
[2:55:19.240 --> 2:55:20.740]  So I feel sorry.
[2:55:20.740 --> 2:55:22.280]  So I can only apologize so much.
[2:55:22.280 --> 2:55:25.160]  I can't change my name.
[2:55:25.160 --> 2:55:28.920]  And I'm sorry to all the other Alex Joneses because you can imagine they get some fans
[2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:32.680]  or they get some enemies and the average live darts will show up at your house.
[2:55:32.680 --> 2:55:34.680]  They'll come to the door and they're like, I'm not Alex Jones.
[2:55:34.680 --> 2:55:35.680]  Like I shut up.
[2:55:35.680 --> 2:55:36.680]  I'm going to kill him.
[2:55:36.680 --> 2:55:42.920]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[2:55:42.920 --> 2:55:43.920]  Memorial Day is here.
[2:55:43.920 --> 2:55:45.960]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[2:55:45.960 --> 2:55:49.600]  And we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch
[2:55:49.600 --> 2:55:51.120]  of items are selling out.
[2:55:51.120 --> 2:55:54.600]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale.
[2:55:54.600 --> 2:55:57.680]  And then five items that weren't on sale, we got back in stock.
[2:55:57.680 --> 2:56:01.640]  They're also massively discounted as well for the Memorial Day special.
[2:56:01.640 --> 2:56:02.640]  So here it is.

[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:29.560]  sale Memorial Day.
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:31.280]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[2:56:31.280 --> 2:56:35.080]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supported you and your
[2:56:35.080 --> 2:56:38.040]  family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[2:56:38.040 --> 2:56:39.640]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[2:56:39.640 --> 2:56:54.280]  We are all in this together.
[2:56:54.280 --> 2:57:05.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:57:05.880 --> 2:57:13.160]  We're told that Bill Gates is going to lead us on the transcendent side of our humanity.
[2:57:13.160 --> 2:57:21.200]  Well, no thank you, butler to the apocalypse, you and your hunchback husband, Melinda, in
[2:57:21.200 --> 2:57:30.200]  Burnin' Hill, because all your well-laid plans to take over society just blew up in
[2:57:30.200 --> 2:57:33.880]  you and your hunchback wife's face.
[2:57:33.880 --> 2:57:37.240]  We're taking your phone calls here ahead of John Rappaport, investigative journalist
[2:57:37.240 --> 2:57:43.360]  taking over, and then we're going to have live coverage of the Falcon 9 heavy launch
[2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:49.640]  with the Dragon spacecraft, the first U.S. manned spaceflight launch from the United
[2:57:49.640 --> 2:57:55.080]  States in 13 years with the big heavy lifter that's blown up quite a few times.
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:57:59.720]  So you talk about a death-defying sport they lead, you're about to see it today on the
[2:57:59.720 --> 2:58:05.320]  war room, Rudy in Connecticut, then Paul and Wendy, Rudy, thanks for holding.
[2:58:05.320 --> 2:58:08.320]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[2:58:08.320 --> 2:58:10.720]  Man, I'm just completely freaked out.
[2:58:10.720 --> 2:58:15.280]  I mean, I know the Democrats are evil, but to openly kill a bunch of old people, 50-something
[2:58:15.280 --> 2:58:20.080]  thousand of them for money, I mean, I just, it took me to another level now where I'm
[2:58:20.080 --> 2:58:24.760]  just like, I mean, well, you know what I'm thinking, man, I mean, like, we don't help
[2:58:24.760 --> 2:58:25.760]  these folks.
[2:58:25.760 --> 2:58:27.240]  We don't, they're still going to kill more, brother.
[2:58:27.240 --> 2:58:30.520]  Now I guess we're just going to start to let them kill them, I mean, these people are
[2:58:30.520 --> 2:58:31.520]  sick.
[2:58:31.520 --> 2:58:36.760]  Well, I guess Bill Gates just wants to hire a lot of teachers, I don't know.
[2:58:36.760 --> 2:58:41.360]  Well, yeah, exactly, we got to kill an old person to hire teachers, so he's like, exactly,
[2:58:41.360 --> 2:58:42.360]  he's helping us.
[2:58:42.360 --> 2:58:45.800]  Well, now you explained to me, so actually, I should send him a blue ribbon and thank
[2:58:45.800 --> 2:58:46.800]  him, right?
[2:58:46.800 --> 2:58:47.800]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:58:47.800 --> 2:58:55.200]  This whole thing, this whole plan is the Empire strikes back, and them killing a bunch
[2:58:55.200 --> 2:58:57.560]  of people is certainly not surprising.
[2:58:57.560 --> 2:59:03.560]  I've known a lot of people that went to the hospital, my parents, without condition, and
[2:59:03.560 --> 2:59:05.040]  they end up dying there.
[2:59:05.040 --> 2:59:10.440]  So I don't know why people are surprised that people in medical facilities are dying, and
[2:59:10.440 --> 2:59:11.440]  especially under this...
[2:59:11.440 --> 2:59:15.080]  Yeah, they don't want to pay out, they have computers, the doctors don't even know why,
[2:59:15.080 --> 2:59:20.320]  they're told by the computer, do this, and they don't want to pay out all that money
[2:59:20.320 --> 2:59:22.560]  they're owed, so they kill them.
[2:59:22.560 --> 2:59:28.800]  Yeah, my mother was in hospital with COPD, she didn't have a terminal illness, she just
[2:59:28.800 --> 2:59:34.160]  had trouble breathing, and in two days, she was dead, and they looked at me, they go,
[2:59:34.160 --> 2:59:36.040]  you want me to bring her back?
[2:59:36.040 --> 2:59:38.480]  And I said, of course, of course.
[2:59:38.480 --> 2:59:41.160]  And then two weeks later, she was dead.
[2:59:41.160 --> 2:59:47.240]  Of course, after they argued with the doctor who wanted her released, and the administrators
[2:59:47.240 --> 2:59:52.840]  wanted to give her end of life care, and who they eventually won, and then she ended up
[2:59:52.840 --> 2:59:53.840]  dying.
[2:59:53.840 --> 2:59:57.640]  They know what they're doing, and again, it's the bioethics board, it's those doctors
[2:59:57.640 --> 2:59:59.880]  that keep the babies comfortable.
[2:59:59.880 --> 3:00:07.520]  Yeah, if I could touch on something that Mark Pascio said, that he was talking about evil,
[3:00:07.520 --> 3:00:13.520]  and people don't really understand in a secular society that they don't buy the metaphysicality
[3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:20.680]  of what Mark was talking about, but true evil is pure intellectualism, and that's why you
[3:00:20.680 --> 3:00:27.360]  end up putting a lot of these super smart people without empathy, get into positions
[3:00:27.360 --> 3:00:32.400]  of power, and without empathy, they start executing these plans with no regard for human
[3:00:32.400 --> 3:00:33.400]  life.
[3:00:33.400 --> 3:00:36.640]  They're psychotic robots, speak to that.
[3:00:36.640 --> 3:00:39.840]  Yeah, well, exactly.
[3:00:39.840 --> 3:00:43.320]  Intellectualism is the opposite of emotion.
[3:00:43.320 --> 3:00:52.360]  So they lack all emotion, and they just overly think things out without any care in the world
[3:00:52.360 --> 3:00:53.600]  for the things that we care for.
[3:00:53.600 --> 3:00:56.520]  Well, it's in justifies the memes.
[3:00:56.520 --> 3:00:59.520]  Absolutely.
[3:00:59.520 --> 3:01:06.360]  And what we have to kind of stay away from is putting all our faith in these pure intellectuals
[3:01:06.360 --> 3:01:14.440]  who come in front of us and tell us what they believe is right without any nod toward feeling
[3:01:14.440 --> 3:01:15.940]  and love and emotion.
[3:01:15.940 --> 3:01:17.400]  Well, let's look at their mental illness, though.
[3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:22.160]  They know we have feelings, they give us false feelings to manipulate us with false mathematics.
[3:01:22.160 --> 3:01:26.920]  If you build an economy to take care of old people, it makes it a more rich economy with
[3:01:26.920 --> 3:01:29.440]  jobs and infrastructure.
[3:01:29.440 --> 3:01:34.760]  Economies that don't take care of old people are always collapsed war zones.
[3:01:34.760 --> 3:01:39.240]  So places without empathy or hell holes, places with empathy are great, but we're taught
[3:01:39.240 --> 3:01:43.920]  a non-zero-some game or a zero-some game where, oh, for you to get ahead, somebody's
[3:01:43.920 --> 3:01:44.920]  got to be screwed.
[3:01:44.920 --> 3:01:50.000]  So it's a fundamentally evil predatory thing to tell a bunch of teachers, you get raises
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  and we kill old people.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:52.160]  Well, no, really.
[3:01:52.160 --> 3:01:55.680]  You think a system that kills old people cares about you dumbass teachers?
[3:01:55.680 --> 3:01:56.680]  No.
[3:01:56.680 --> 3:01:57.680]  So they know what they're doing.
[3:01:57.680 --> 3:02:00.800]  It's not just like they're intellectual and they're up on some, you know, mountaintop
[3:02:00.800 --> 3:02:02.360]  with their high IQ.
[3:02:02.360 --> 3:02:03.880]  They like to kill people.
[3:02:03.880 --> 3:02:05.520]  They like the power.
[3:02:05.520 --> 3:02:07.520]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:02:07.520 --> 3:02:08.520]  They're driven by power.
[3:02:08.520 --> 3:02:13.800]  If you know anything about philosophy and postmodernism, power is the only thing they
[3:02:13.800 --> 3:02:14.800]  care about.
[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:16.720]  No, they say it's the willing.
[3:02:16.720 --> 3:02:20.120]  So they say a little blow the planet up just to be willing that exactly.
[3:02:20.120 --> 3:02:25.000]  They believe that that is the procreative power of God is to do something.
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:29.160]  No, the power of God is to do something ordered and good and wholesome that regenerates with
[3:02:29.160 --> 3:02:30.840]  a Genesis force.
[3:02:30.840 --> 3:02:35.680]  Right, if you care and love something and are nurturing, you're a sucker.
[3:02:35.680 --> 3:02:41.840]  But if you can will your power and do things like that, that you are supreme.
[3:02:41.840 --> 3:02:46.680]  And that's where humanism comes in and people don't understand humanism is putting people
[3:02:46.680 --> 3:02:51.240]  as the supreme being versus people of faith who put God first.
[3:02:51.240 --> 3:02:52.240]  That's right.
[3:02:52.240 --> 3:02:54.960]  And then they trick us to be collectivist and go, Oh, give up your free will for the
[3:02:54.960 --> 3:02:55.960]  greater good.
[3:02:55.960 --> 3:02:58.360]  No, you take your free will to do what's good for everybody.
[3:02:58.360 --> 3:02:59.960]  Appreciate your call.
[3:02:59.960 --> 3:03:02.600]  Now these satanists have no idea what they're dealing with.
[3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:05.720]  They're only here to summon what we're going to do and they've done it.
[3:03:05.720 --> 3:03:09.080]  So congratulations to them, Paul in California.
[3:03:09.080 --> 3:03:10.080]  You're on the air.
[3:03:10.080 --> 3:03:11.080]  Go ahead.
[3:03:11.080 --> 3:03:12.080]  Hi, Alex.
[3:03:12.080 --> 3:03:17.120]  Big fan for 13 years originally from Staten Island, New York.
[3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:20.760]  You and I were pretty tight back in 2012, 2013.
[3:03:20.760 --> 3:03:22.760]  Let's talk surveillance.
[3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:25.480]  We hear a lot about contact tracing.
[3:03:25.480 --> 3:03:28.440]  You and I are familiar with stingray.
[3:03:28.440 --> 3:03:33.760]  What do you think the American public can see once the state, the federal government
[3:03:33.760 --> 3:03:39.080]  and local governments come down with this surveillance and tell me about your thoughts.
[3:03:39.080 --> 3:03:40.280]  Well, they already got the surveillance.
[3:03:40.280 --> 3:03:43.000]  They want to roll it out like, Oh, we've got these people hired to watch you.
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:44.160]  We're looking at your phone.
[3:03:44.160 --> 3:03:50.280]  That's for COVID-19 and this is the rollout of the Chinese social credit score.
[3:03:50.280 --> 3:03:53.680]  And people are going to get really upset and a lot of them are going to get scared to go
[3:03:53.680 --> 3:03:54.680]  along with it.
[3:03:54.680 --> 3:03:56.760]  No, we have to say no to it.
[3:03:56.760 --> 3:03:57.760]  Can you expand?
[3:03:57.760 --> 3:04:03.280]  I was in the middle of an organized crime investigation and I had total surveillance
[3:04:03.280 --> 3:04:04.480]  on me.
[3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:07.920]  Can you tell the public, tell the people listening to this?
[3:04:07.920 --> 3:04:12.600]  If you get caught up, what type of surveillance is out there?
[3:04:12.600 --> 3:04:14.320]  Well, everything is recorded.
[3:04:14.320 --> 3:04:16.520]  Everything is controlled.
[3:04:16.520 --> 3:04:20.040]  And then they can just pick and choose and create whatever they want.
[3:04:20.040 --> 3:04:21.560]  I mean, that's really what it is, Paul.
[3:04:21.560 --> 3:04:24.200]  I'm out of time and closing comments.
[3:04:24.200 --> 3:04:25.200]  Great to talk to you, sir.
[3:04:25.200 --> 3:04:26.200]  God bless you, brother.
[3:04:26.200 --> 3:04:27.720]  Thanks for calling in over the years.
[3:04:27.720 --> 3:04:32.120]  Wendy, last caller in New York, the true epicenter of the culling of the old people
[3:04:32.120 --> 3:04:37.280]  by design with the purposeful planting of COVID-19 by the demonic mass murdering governor.
[3:04:37.280 --> 3:04:38.280]  Those aren't just words.
[3:04:38.280 --> 3:04:42.080]  It's a true Hitler, Joseph Mingola Cuomo.
[3:04:42.080 --> 3:04:43.080]  Go ahead, Wendy.
[3:04:43.080 --> 3:04:44.080]  Hi, Alex.
[3:04:44.080 --> 3:04:47.080]  Thank you for taking my call.
[3:04:47.080 --> 3:04:48.080]  Welcome.
[3:04:48.080 --> 3:04:50.080]  I would like to discuss a matter.
[3:04:50.080 --> 3:04:56.120]  First of all, I'd like to say that this is truly the first emergence of what the public
[3:04:56.120 --> 3:05:00.000]  is seeing as the death panels.
[3:05:00.000 --> 3:05:06.920]  And then also, it's also what we're seeing as what our medical system would look like
[3:05:06.920 --> 3:05:11.080]  under the socialized medicine.
[3:05:11.080 --> 3:05:18.160]  Now my daughter is a pharmacist, and she was in corporate for many years.
[3:05:18.160 --> 3:05:26.080]  She lost her job because her pay was so high that they eliminated her because of cost factors.
[3:05:26.080 --> 3:05:37.080]  She got a job as, she did data entry for the seniors in the nursing care system.
[3:05:37.080 --> 3:05:38.080]  Hello?
[3:05:38.080 --> 3:05:39.080]  Yes, ma'am.
[3:05:39.080 --> 3:05:41.080]  I'm listening to you.
[3:05:41.080 --> 3:05:42.080]  Yes.
[3:05:42.080 --> 3:05:46.560]  And she did data entry into the nursing care system.
[3:05:46.560 --> 3:05:52.200]  She did it from about two years, a very new growing field.
[3:05:52.200 --> 3:05:53.200]  And what did she say?
[3:05:53.200 --> 3:05:54.200]  What happened?
[3:05:54.200 --> 3:06:00.000]  What happened was, over time, she saw more and more emergence of more people coming into
[3:06:00.000 --> 3:06:02.160]  the nursing home industry.
[3:06:02.160 --> 3:06:07.720]  And they started getting more and more nursing homes into their accounts.
[3:06:07.720 --> 3:06:10.000]  And there were more and more people hired.
[3:06:10.000 --> 3:06:11.000]  And she was hired.
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:17.160]  She actually was, she worked from home because they needed more people and the facility,
[3:06:17.160 --> 3:06:18.160]  the main facility.
[3:06:18.160 --> 3:06:19.160]  Hold on.
[3:06:19.160 --> 3:06:20.160]  I'm going to hold you over.
[3:06:20.160 --> 3:06:21.160]  Rabaport's got a big show lined up.
[3:06:21.160 --> 3:06:22.160]  But I want to hear you finish why this is important.
[3:06:22.160 --> 3:06:23.160]  I'm sure it is.
[3:06:23.160 --> 3:06:26.920]  But yeah, they're all honing in to get rid of the old people, because they don't want
[3:06:26.920 --> 3:06:31.600]  to pay out their benefits and stuff, and they've got a lot of ways to get rid of them.
[3:06:31.600 --> 3:06:32.600]  So this is, this is it.
[3:06:32.600 --> 3:06:36.040]  I mean, it would be a lot nicer just to go in there and blow their heads off.
[3:06:36.040 --> 3:06:37.040]  I'm not saying do that.
[3:06:37.040 --> 3:06:41.920]  I'm saying figuratively, like Jonathan Swift, Rabaport.
[3:06:41.920 --> 3:06:44.560]  The United States is not communist China.
[3:06:44.560 --> 3:06:47.480]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[3:06:47.480 --> 3:06:49.360]  We don't blow up churches.
[3:06:49.360 --> 3:06:52.560]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[3:06:52.560 --> 3:06:58.760]  But all of the news, we see the U.N., billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media
[3:06:58.760 --> 3:07:01.880]  praising communist China for their response.
[3:07:01.880 --> 3:07:06.120]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has
[3:07:06.120 --> 3:07:09.280]  robots controlling people, well, then gee, we've got to do that.
[3:07:09.280 --> 3:07:13.400]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying, well, arrest you if you
[3:07:13.400 --> 3:07:14.720]  say Chinese virus.
[3:07:14.720 --> 3:07:18.440]  Well, now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[3:07:18.440 --> 3:07:23.640]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because
[3:07:23.640 --> 3:07:27.600]  we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[3:07:27.600 --> 3:07:28.720]  power grab.
[3:07:28.720 --> 3:07:33.040]  The resistance lives at band.video and infowars.com.
[3:07:33.040 --> 3:07:37.080]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats, and then we'll be able to defeat
[3:07:37.080 --> 3:07:41.080]  their operation that much quicker.
[3:07:41.080 --> 3:07:45.560]  What info wars has been able to do, thanks to your support and your prayers and your
[3:07:45.560 --> 3:07:51.000]  word of mouth, has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:54.800]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[3:07:54.800 --> 3:08:01.800]  And now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[3:08:01.800 --> 3:08:07.560]  Now, the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[3:08:07.560 --> 3:08:10.240]  You must decide which side you're on.
[3:08:10.240 --> 3:08:15.480]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome, Lerteltlis will only deliver you into misery
[3:08:15.480 --> 3:08:16.480]  and destruction.
[3:08:16.480 --> 3:08:17.480]  And finally, death.
[3:08:17.480 --> 3:08:23.600]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[3:08:23.600 --> 3:08:26.360]  The delusions must end now.
[3:08:26.360 --> 3:08:31.720]  Infowars was correct about it all, and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[3:08:31.720 --> 3:08:34.720]  Most people that are aware of the new order decide to join it out of fear.
[3:08:34.720 --> 3:08:36.720]  They are truly fearless.
[3:08:36.720 --> 3:08:43.240]  We must fight this or lose our souls.
[3:08:43.240 --> 3:08:50.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:50.240 --> 3:08:59.240]  We now take you live.
[3:08:59.240 --> 3:09:03.000]  Hi, Jim Robbaport of NoMoreFakeNews.com, let's take you over.
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:04.000]  Always enjoy listening to him.
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:09.800]  He's always informative, but he's really been upset and focused because we're under
[3:09:09.800 --> 3:09:14.040]  beyond Nazi attack and hear about the Nazis and medical tyranny killing old people and
[3:09:14.040 --> 3:09:15.040]  stuff like that.
[3:09:15.040 --> 3:09:16.600]  It's really going on right now.
[3:09:16.600 --> 3:09:22.360]  And so it's all confirmed now that they ordered the cursing homes in these blue states to
[3:09:22.360 --> 3:09:26.600]  put COVID patients in there to kill them, knowing that it was only bad, you know, pneumonia
[3:09:26.600 --> 3:09:29.080]  to them and it kept the families out.
[3:09:29.080 --> 3:09:30.080]  Why they killed them?
[3:09:30.080 --> 3:09:33.280]  A lot of, callers are calling in, it's true, they give them opium till they die.
[3:09:33.280 --> 3:09:35.600]  A lot of them didn't even die of COVID.
[3:09:35.600 --> 3:09:38.080]  And this is how it works.
[3:09:38.080 --> 3:09:43.880]  So Wendy in New York, finish your point about what you're getting at here because it sounds
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:48.160]  interesting, but like, what is your view on COVID, what is your daughter's view as a pharmacist
[3:09:48.160 --> 3:09:49.160]  on this?
[3:09:49.160 --> 3:09:58.600]  Well, my daughter Erica, she was in the beginning of March, she was starting to lose hours.
[3:09:58.600 --> 3:10:03.080]  And we really didn't understand, but I, she didn't understand, but I did because I've
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:10.880]  been following you since January, late January, watching this thing develop.
[3:10:10.880 --> 3:10:16.400]  So she lost hours and I said, you're losing hours because people are dying.
[3:10:16.400 --> 3:10:24.920]  And at that same time, my son came home from work with COVID, he's a New York city police
[3:10:24.920 --> 3:10:34.360]  sergeant in Harlem, so I saw from both sides of this New York thing, a sick child with
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:39.040]  COVID and a daughter lost her job because of COVID.
[3:10:39.040 --> 3:10:42.480]  Let me ask you this in New York, are people getting pissed at Cuomo?
[3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:49.640]  Oh God, everybody hates him, but then we get, he gets the best ratings.
[3:10:49.640 --> 3:10:53.560]  Well, they lie, they tell you he's super popular, exactly.
[3:10:53.560 --> 3:10:54.560]  God bless you.
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:10:57.240]  You were going to say, but I wanted to hear it out of your mouth, not out of mine.
[3:10:57.240 --> 3:11:01.960]  John Rappaport, you take over, I want to invite you on as a guest in the next few days.
[3:11:01.960 --> 3:11:04.960]  The fourth hour is just as big as any hour, but I want to have you on with me because
[3:11:04.960 --> 3:11:08.160]  you've really, you and David Knight and a few others have just been on fire, on top
[3:11:08.160 --> 3:11:09.160]  of fire.
[3:11:09.160 --> 3:11:12.600]  How do you say in Latin, the fire of the fire, you know, the crème de la crème.
[3:11:12.600 --> 3:11:16.400]  But I mean, this is truly weighing down on me.
[3:11:16.400 --> 3:11:21.880]  Not some touchy feely goodsy to see I'm a liberal, I care about people faking.
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:26.920]  The murder of people in nursing homes knowingly and the intubating them to get the money.
[3:11:26.920 --> 3:11:29.920]  I'm actually ashamed.
[3:11:29.920 --> 3:11:32.160]  My wife was asking, why aren't you eating your dinner last night?
[3:11:32.160 --> 3:11:34.640]  Why don't you want to, you know, have fun?
[3:11:34.640 --> 3:11:39.040]  I just, I just, I said, I said, I feel guilty that I'm not getting on an airplane and going
[3:11:39.040 --> 3:11:43.040]  up to New York or Michigan and you know, and I'm not trying to act tough folks as a man.
[3:11:43.040 --> 3:11:47.080]  Like these are Nazis folks, you know about Nazis, I mean, these are the real deal.
[3:11:47.080 --> 3:11:48.640]  How are you dealing with this, John?
[3:11:48.640 --> 3:11:53.200]  Because this is so sick, it's so freakish, and it's all an exercise to see what we're
[3:11:53.200 --> 3:11:54.200]  going to put up with.
[3:11:54.200 --> 3:11:56.240]  Go ahead and take over, my friend.
[3:11:56.240 --> 3:11:57.240]  Okay.
[3:11:57.240 --> 3:11:58.240]  Thanks, Alex.
[3:11:58.240 --> 3:12:01.240]  I'm hanging in, hanging in.
[3:12:01.240 --> 3:12:03.440]  All right, everybody.
[3:12:03.440 --> 3:12:11.040]  I'm going to put something up on my screen here because it just came into me.
[3:12:11.040 --> 3:12:20.600]  Journal of the American Medical Association, April 21, 2020, face masks should not be worn
[3:12:20.600 --> 3:12:27.720]  by healthy individuals to protect themselves from acquiring respiratory infection because
[3:12:27.720 --> 3:12:34.920]  there is no evidence to suggest that face masks worn by healthy individuals are effective
[3:12:34.920 --> 3:12:39.280]  in preventing people from becoming ill.
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:43.960]  Journal of the American Medical Association, face masks should be reserved for those who
[3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:47.080]  need them because masks can be in shorts of five, blah, blah, blah.
[3:12:47.080 --> 3:12:49.560]  So the whole narrative is collapsing.
[3:12:49.560 --> 3:12:50.720]  What does that signify?
[3:12:50.720 --> 3:12:51.720]  What do they do next?
[3:12:51.720 --> 3:13:00.600]  Yeah, because here I'm continuing, because N95 respirators require special fit testing,
[3:13:00.600 --> 3:13:03.720]  they are not recommended for use by the general public.
[3:13:03.720 --> 3:13:09.480]  So what I'm suggesting you do, those of you, whatever, million people right now may be
[3:13:09.480 --> 3:13:17.880]  more than listening, go to that Journal of the American Medical Association, April 21,
[3:13:17.880 --> 3:13:24.480]  copy this out, make handbills, and just, you know, as Bill Hicks used to say, I'm just
[3:13:24.480 --> 3:13:32.120]  going around planting seeds, planting seeds, just hand them out to people standing in line
[3:13:32.120 --> 3:13:38.680]  at Whole Foods from their masks, acting like robots and so on, or wherever, you know, store
[3:13:38.680 --> 3:13:43.520]  managers, hey, you might want to read this, oh, hello, hi, how are you?
[3:13:43.520 --> 3:13:45.760]  Just take this and check it out.
[3:13:45.760 --> 3:13:50.720]  Because look, this whole thing is, as Alex said, completely collapsing.
[3:13:50.720 --> 3:13:56.640]  But what I really want to talk about here is something that Infowars has been saying,
[3:13:56.640 --> 3:14:02.320]  I don't know, for the last, what, 25, 30 years, this is a spiritual war.
[3:14:02.320 --> 3:14:07.800]  I don't care if you don't even believe in anything spiritual, you know, when enough
[3:14:07.800 --> 3:14:16.160]  freedoms of yours are taken away, you will notice something spiritual on some level.
[3:14:16.160 --> 3:14:24.160]  So I want to start with this, St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, gigantic Catholic church
[3:14:24.160 --> 3:14:26.640]  built, I think, in 1910.
[3:14:26.640 --> 3:14:33.840]  Don't know who the rector or the priest is who's in charge of it right now, but suffice
[3:14:33.840 --> 3:14:39.960]  to say, let's suppose that he had the courage and the wherewithal to stand up in his hind
[3:14:39.960 --> 3:14:43.720]  legs and make the following pronouncement.
[3:14:43.720 --> 3:14:48.880]  We are not beholden to the governments of earth, we are beholden to God.
[3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:55.760]  That is the doctrine of our church, Jesus Christ, God, Holy Spirit.
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:14:58.040]  That is what we stand for.
[3:14:58.040 --> 3:15:03.120]  Governments do not rule us, we do not bow down to governments, that has always been
[3:15:03.120 --> 3:15:04.440]  the case.
[3:15:04.440 --> 3:15:11.200]  And we certainly don't get down on our knees and worship a virus, nor do we pay homage
[3:15:11.200 --> 3:15:16.640]  to Anthony Fauci or Como or any other human on earth.
[3:15:16.640 --> 3:15:22.480]  This is not why the church is here, this is not why people have suffered over the centuries
[3:15:22.480 --> 3:15:27.400]  in order to bring us to the point we are in now.
[3:15:27.400 --> 3:15:33.480]  Therefore, we are saying that St. Patrick's is open for business and we are not talking
[3:15:33.480 --> 3:15:40.200]  about six feet apart business, we are talking about the way we were created, which is we
[3:15:40.200 --> 3:15:41.880]  are here.
[3:15:41.880 --> 3:15:45.560]  God did not create a six feet apart.
[3:15:45.560 --> 3:15:52.480]  So what I am saying to you is I fully realize that as the priest in charge of St. Pat's,
[3:15:52.480 --> 3:15:57.520]  there is going to be trouble, trouble from the New York City authorities.
[3:15:57.520 --> 3:16:04.120]  So I am requesting and asking every Catholic in New York and New Jersey to come to St.
[3:16:04.120 --> 3:16:13.640]  Pat's this Sunday and to defend your church and to help us and to help me.
[3:16:13.640 --> 3:16:16.000]  Cops show up.
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:17.560]  What do you think would happen?
[3:16:17.560 --> 3:16:23.920]  If he said this with enough conviction, enough authority, enough belief, enough faith, enough
[3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:32.720]  desire, cops show up who knows how many officials, whatever, and 60,000 Catholics come in from
[3:16:32.720 --> 3:16:39.480]  New Jersey and New York and they assemble at St. Pat's inside, outside, everywhere.
[3:16:39.480 --> 3:16:41.360]  What are the cops going to do?
[3:16:41.360 --> 3:16:49.000]  Shoot all the Catholics, arrest all the Catholics, try to put them in trucks and take them away.
[3:16:49.000 --> 3:16:50.640]  I don't think so.
[3:16:50.640 --> 3:16:51.640]  I don't think so.
[3:16:51.640 --> 3:16:54.240]  I think the show would be over.
[3:16:54.240 --> 3:16:58.240]  I think the comovirus would magically go away.
[3:16:58.240 --> 3:17:00.320]  That's what I think.
[3:17:00.320 --> 3:17:01.560]  That's what I think would happen.
[3:17:01.560 --> 3:17:06.160]  And so that's my intro to the spiritual war.
[3:17:06.160 --> 3:17:11.680]  Now I'm talking about every house of worship of any denomination or sect anywhere in the
[3:17:11.680 --> 3:17:17.920]  country, anywhere in the world, and any of the leaders, the people, the men, the women,
[3:17:17.920 --> 3:17:24.000]  whoever, in charge of those, what I will call churches, just to boil it down, and I will
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:28.240]  call them preachers, okay?
[3:17:28.240 --> 3:17:31.160]  To whom is their allegiance, basically?
[3:17:31.160 --> 3:17:34.640]  What are they there for, these religious leaders?
[3:17:34.640 --> 3:17:39.360]  The other day I was interviewed from an outlet in Argentina.
[3:17:39.360 --> 3:17:42.480]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[3:17:42.480 --> 3:17:48.960]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights, being suspended
[3:17:48.960 --> 3:17:55.360]  in a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[3:17:55.360 --> 3:17:57.360]  in full control.
[3:17:57.360 --> 3:18:03.080]  Many will submit through fear, others will be bought off, but in the end, the globalists
[3:18:03.080 --> 3:18:08.640]  admit they're building a post-human world, and now that we're inside the cage, it's
[3:18:08.640 --> 3:18:13.560]  going to move very, very quickly into its end game.
[3:18:13.560 --> 3:18:19.160]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our
[3:18:19.160 --> 3:18:25.640]  own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing
[3:18:25.640 --> 3:18:26.640]  this.
[3:18:26.640 --> 3:18:31.400]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being born inside out.
[3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:37.400]  This is a scientific dictatorship to infold control of humanity for its own selfless disgusting
[3:18:37.400 --> 3:18:38.400]  power trip.
[3:18:38.400 --> 3:18:43.640]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here with InfowarsStore.com, and I want to tell you about something that
[3:18:43.640 --> 3:18:47.560]  I think has really helped me out and I think can help you out too, especially if you have
[3:18:47.560 --> 3:18:49.200]  any problems sleeping.
[3:18:49.200 --> 3:18:50.200]  And that's knockout.
[3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:54.600]  Let's face it, our life patterns have been disrupted by this lockdown, this government
[3:18:54.600 --> 3:18:58.760]  imposed imprisonment, and it has definitely affected my sleep schedule, but one thing
[3:18:58.760 --> 3:18:59.960]  that has helped is knockout.
[3:18:59.960 --> 3:19:03.880]  I take one pill about an hour before I want to go to bed, and boom, I get a great night's
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:04.880]  sleep.
[3:19:04.880 --> 3:19:08.080]  And just this past Memorial Day, I took two of them, fell asleep about 1 a.m., woke
[3:19:08.080 --> 3:19:10.360]  up at 8 a.m., ready to go.
[3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:13.840]  It really has made a difference in my life, and it can make a difference in your life
[3:19:13.840 --> 3:19:14.840]  too.
[3:19:14.840 --> 3:19:16.200]  If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch.
[3:19:16.200 --> 3:19:18.200]  If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point.
[3:19:18.200 --> 3:19:19.480]  You're going to be mentally focused.
[3:19:19.480 --> 3:19:21.920]  You're going to be ready to take on the day.
[3:19:21.920 --> 3:19:24.160]  And right now, knockout is 50% off.
[3:19:24.160 --> 3:19:26.040]  It's less than $15 a bottle.
[3:19:26.040 --> 3:19:27.360]  You get 30 capsules.
[3:19:27.360 --> 3:19:28.360]  Give it a try today.
[3:19:28.360 --> 3:19:33.040]  It's at a great price right now, and it can really help you get the sleep you need, especially
[3:19:33.040 --> 3:19:34.520]  in these tough times.
[3:19:34.520 --> 3:19:40.160]  It's knockout, and it's available at infowarstore.com.
[3:19:40.160 --> 3:19:46.080]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[3:19:46.080 --> 3:19:52.160]  We will not have this sale that's going on right now in May until our Christmas sale
[3:19:52.160 --> 3:19:53.160]  comes up.
[3:19:53.160 --> 3:20:00.160]  All of our best-selling supplements are 30% to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[3:20:00.160 --> 3:20:04.320]  Let me just hone in on one of the products, DNA Force Plus.
[3:20:04.320 --> 3:20:09.480]  It's got high-quality PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known
[3:20:09.480 --> 3:20:11.920]  to supercharge the effects of that.
[3:20:11.920 --> 3:20:17.160]  Learn what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you, no matter how old you are, no matter what
[3:20:17.160 --> 3:20:22.280]  color you are, no matter where you live in the world, it works the same on everybody.
[3:20:22.280 --> 3:20:24.840]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[3:20:24.840 --> 3:20:29.520]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer, doesn't make them grow, makes them
[3:20:29.520 --> 3:20:32.880]  shrink slower, which is basically the same thing.
[3:20:32.880 --> 3:21:01.280]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[3:21:01.280 --> 3:21:03.960]  All right, that's it for this week's analysis reports.
[3:21:03.960 --> 3:21:09.960]  It's the Alex Jones show, and now your host, John Rappaport.
[3:21:09.960 --> 3:21:23.240]  I got Rappaport back here in the fourth hour sitting in for Alex, so I was saying, I was
[3:21:23.240 --> 3:21:28.400]  interviewed by an outlet in Argentina, and they basically said to me, the Catholic Church
[3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:31.480]  just said to everybody, you have to go along with the government.
[3:21:31.480 --> 3:21:36.600]  That's not what I'm talking about, and I'm not talking about the loosening of the lockdowns,
[3:21:36.600 --> 3:21:41.080]  okay, the churches are opening, and people say, well, that's great.
[3:21:41.080 --> 3:21:45.480]  Trump said this is essential service, you know, I'm not talking about that.
[3:21:45.480 --> 3:21:48.560]  I'm talking about the preachers, the leaders.
[3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:50.360]  Where is their conscience?
[3:21:50.360 --> 3:21:51.400]  How high does it go?
[3:21:51.400 --> 3:21:53.760]  How deep does it go?
[3:21:53.760 --> 3:21:57.400]  My understanding of every religious group on earth is that at the beginning there was
[3:21:57.400 --> 3:21:59.180]  a tremendous struggle.
[3:21:59.180 --> 3:22:01.400]  People were killed, imprisoned, tortured.
[3:22:01.400 --> 3:22:06.560]  We're not talking about some little, you know, light thing here.
[3:22:06.560 --> 3:22:10.880]  But now all of a sudden it seems like it's all suburbia.
[3:22:10.880 --> 3:22:11.880]  That's the impression.
[3:22:11.880 --> 3:22:18.400]  Well, you know, what do you expect my minister to do, get arrested?
[3:22:18.400 --> 3:22:24.080]  Yeah, I do.
[3:22:24.080 --> 3:22:25.800]  Is he a man of God?
[3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:27.280]  Is that his highest allegiance?
[3:22:27.280 --> 3:22:30.880]  Why is he the pastor and the preacher?
[3:22:30.880 --> 3:22:37.480]  Isn't this supposed to be a sign that this is a person of great conscience and depth
[3:22:37.480 --> 3:22:45.800]  who has spent his life making a relationship between himself and his creator, God?
[3:22:45.800 --> 3:22:49.720]  Isn't that the whole point of a leader of the flock?
[3:22:49.720 --> 3:22:55.400]  Isn't that what the flock is supposed to be looking toward is such a preacher who is
[3:22:55.400 --> 3:22:59.520]  willing to say, we are open.
[3:22:59.520 --> 3:23:05.160]  We're open for business, folks, not six feet apart, not wearing masks.
[3:23:05.160 --> 3:23:06.920]  This is a house of worship.
[3:23:06.920 --> 3:23:14.400]  This is where we come as a community to be as close to God as possible.
[3:23:14.400 --> 3:23:22.480]  And nothing, no state, no government, no anything is going to stop us, period.
[3:23:22.480 --> 3:23:28.680]  Not just opening the door a crack, but going all the way.
[3:23:28.680 --> 3:23:35.680]  Isn't this what, you know, once we brush aside the consumerism and the glaze and the
[3:23:35.680 --> 3:23:43.680]  gloss of society and so forth, rock bottom, isn't that what we are supposed to expect
[3:23:43.680 --> 3:23:46.960]  from preachers and religious leaders?
[3:23:46.960 --> 3:23:49.160]  That, isn't it?
[3:23:49.160 --> 3:23:55.720]  Now, I understand everybody had draws a line somewhere and says, beyond that, I'm not going
[3:23:55.720 --> 3:23:59.280]  to go, okay?
[3:23:59.280 --> 3:24:06.600]  In the case of a preacher, let's see him stand up in front of the congregation and say, listen,
[3:24:06.600 --> 3:24:15.120]  my conscience tells me that what I should say publicly with no compromises, we are open.
[3:24:15.120 --> 3:24:20.720]  Not just because of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, but because our connection
[3:24:20.720 --> 3:24:28.240]  to God is greater and prior to any government on earth and always was and always will be.
[3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:35.680]  But no matter what my conscience says, I don't have the courage to do it.
[3:24:35.680 --> 3:24:36.680]  I'm sorry.
[3:24:36.680 --> 3:24:37.680]  I don't.
[3:24:37.680 --> 3:24:46.000]  Therefore, therefore, I'm stepping down as of now.
[3:24:46.000 --> 3:24:52.320]  And the pulpit is open and bare in this House of Worship.
[3:24:52.320 --> 3:24:58.220]  Is there someone here in the congregation who not only has the conscience, but the courage
[3:24:58.220 --> 3:25:02.800]  to go further than I have gone much further?
[3:25:02.800 --> 3:25:10.640]  If so, this House of Worship is his or hers as of now.
[3:25:10.640 --> 3:25:15.440]  Is another reasonable statement to make, given the fact of what these religions are supposed
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:23.360]  to stand for, I don't care what religion it is or what sect.
[3:25:23.360 --> 3:25:25.480]  Isn't that what we would expect?
[3:25:25.480 --> 3:25:30.200]  And if churches, let's just take America as an example.
[3:25:30.200 --> 3:25:35.880]  If these Houses of Worship, these churches all across the country did this, don't you
[3:25:35.880 --> 3:25:45.520]  think this show would be over, this farce, this destructive, insane war against the people
[3:25:45.520 --> 3:25:48.000]  would be over?
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:50.320]  It would be.
[3:25:50.320 --> 3:25:53.840]  By implication, it spreads and ripples and ripples.
[3:25:53.840 --> 3:25:59.200]  And people are saying, wow, did you hear what Reverend So-and-So did and what he said?
[3:25:59.200 --> 3:26:04.080]  I mean, wow, this is real.
[3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:14.280]  These people, these preachers are finally talking reality, spiritual reality that comes before
[3:26:14.280 --> 3:26:30.360]  any Cuomo or Newsome or de Blasio or whoever, Jay Inslee, Governor of Washington, frippery,
[3:26:30.360 --> 3:26:44.080]  frippery, mere disturbances of dust in the space of spiritual life as led by these preachers.
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:54.600]  It's quite okay for them to say, I don't have the guts to do this, frankly, I'm sorry.
[3:26:54.600 --> 3:26:55.840]  I can't do it.
[3:26:55.840 --> 3:27:03.080]  I've fallen short of the mission, of my connection to God.
[3:27:03.080 --> 3:27:05.440]  Someone else is going to have to carry the ball.
[3:27:05.440 --> 3:27:07.360]  Who is it going to be?
[3:27:07.360 --> 3:27:16.280]  And someone stands up and says, I will come up, come up, come up, stand at the pulpit.
[3:27:16.280 --> 3:27:23.080]  Let's hear what you're going to say to the congregation, to the government in public,
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:30.880]  not just here, but outside, to the press, to anyone who will listen.
[3:27:30.880 --> 3:27:40.720]  Put your spiritual cards on the table, and it falls to the congregation.
[3:27:40.720 --> 3:27:49.880]  They are not without responsibility to say to their preachers, how far will you go?
[3:27:49.880 --> 3:27:57.000]  Because what we have been witnessing is the destruction of what we stand for, imposed
[3:27:57.000 --> 3:28:08.080]  by the government, which has no right to do what they've done, to limit us in any way,
[3:28:08.080 --> 3:28:15.680]  to have told us early on to close our doors, to limit how many people can come in to our
[3:28:15.680 --> 3:28:20.120]  house of worship and where they have to stand and what they have to wear, and this and that
[3:28:20.120 --> 3:28:24.520]  and the other thing.
[3:28:24.520 --> 3:28:31.360]  It falls to the congregation to inquire seriously of their preacher, their leader, where do
[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:35.240]  you stand on this?
[3:28:35.240 --> 3:28:37.380]  Where do you want us to go?
[3:28:37.380 --> 3:28:41.800]  How much courage will you display in the face of oppression?
[3:28:41.800 --> 3:28:48.960]  I mean, maybe I'm wrong here, maybe I'm making a serious mistake, and religion was never
[3:28:48.960 --> 3:28:50.720]  about this.
[3:28:50.720 --> 3:28:51.800]  Is that right?
[3:28:51.800 --> 3:28:57.800]  Is it always a con all the way, all the time, in all sects and all denominations?
[3:28:57.800 --> 3:28:59.080]  Really?
[3:28:59.080 --> 3:29:04.920]  Is that the conclusion that we're supposed to draw from this?
[3:29:04.920 --> 3:29:11.360]  So when I say and have been saying since almost the beginning that churches could lead the
[3:29:11.360 --> 3:29:16.080]  way, this is what I'm talking about.
[3:29:16.080 --> 3:29:19.000]  This is what I'm talking about.
[3:29:19.000 --> 3:29:26.880]  The spiritual war takes in the spiritual dimension of life, and for untold billions of people,
[3:29:26.880 --> 3:29:39.480]  this means their religion, their God, their prophets, all of that.
[3:29:39.480 --> 3:29:44.280]  But what does that really mean in the face of oppression?
[3:29:44.280 --> 3:29:50.240]  It's very easy to go to church on Sunday and dress up when everything is good, everything
[3:29:50.240 --> 3:29:52.680]  is nice, everything is fine.
[3:29:52.680 --> 3:29:58.360]  If that's the limit of a church, then the pastor has an obligation to say so.
[3:29:58.360 --> 3:30:03.760]  We gather here to have fun and to look at each other's clothes and each other's cars
[3:30:03.760 --> 3:30:09.680]  and the fancy hats and the giggles and have fun and say a few prayers and feel good and
[3:30:09.680 --> 3:30:11.840]  then go to lunch.
[3:30:11.840 --> 3:30:14.080]  That's why we're here.
[3:30:14.080 --> 3:30:16.080]  If that's the case, make it clear.
[3:30:16.080 --> 3:30:20.200]  If it's more than that, make that clear.
[3:30:20.200 --> 3:30:23.480]  In no uncertain terms, I'll be back after the break.
[3:30:23.480 --> 3:30:24.480]  We're not done.
[3:30:24.480 --> 3:30:42.840]  Memorial Day is here, it's one of the biggest sales of the year, and we were already running
[3:30:42.840 --> 3:30:46.840]  a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.

[3:30:51.360 --> 3:30:55.680]  that weren't on sale that we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well
[3:30:55.680 --> 3:30:57.360]  for the Memorial Day special.

[3:31:25.200 --> 3:31:27.000]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[3:31:27.000 --> 3:31:30.800]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supported you and your
[3:31:30.800 --> 3:31:33.760]  family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[3:31:33.760 --> 3:31:35.320]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[3:31:35.320 --> 3:31:38.160]  We are all in this together.
[3:31:38.160 --> 3:31:39.160]  Now it's official.
[3:31:39.160 --> 3:31:45.160]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years,
[3:31:45.160 --> 3:31:50.360]  and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested
[3:31:50.360 --> 3:31:54.480]  because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of
[3:31:54.480 --> 3:31:56.880]  10 people that you visit.
[3:31:56.880 --> 3:32:01.040]  And if you go outside that list of 10, you'll be permanently detained.
[3:32:01.040 --> 3:32:05.520]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order where they let the criminals
[3:32:05.520 --> 3:32:11.960]  out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now nonessential
[3:32:11.960 --> 3:32:13.200]  and a prisoner.
[3:32:13.200 --> 3:32:16.760]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian
[3:32:16.760 --> 3:32:18.280]  anti-human group.
[3:32:18.280 --> 3:32:23.560]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game,
[3:32:23.560 --> 3:32:25.840]  which is global depopulation.
[3:32:25.840 --> 3:32:29.360]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[3:32:29.360 --> 3:32:35.320]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's
[3:32:35.320 --> 3:32:36.760]  mortal enemy.
[3:32:36.760 --> 3:32:40.120]  Wake up or die.
[3:32:40.120 --> 3:32:43.720]  It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[3:32:43.720 --> 3:32:47.640]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the
[3:32:47.640 --> 3:32:50.800]  InfiWars crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[3:32:50.800 --> 3:32:54.280]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy, and delicious drinking
[3:32:54.280 --> 3:32:55.280]  water.
[3:32:55.280 --> 3:32:58.400]  Perfect for preppers or anyone concerned with the healthier source of water, the Alexa Pure
[3:32:58.400 --> 3:33:01.800]  Pro can remove up to 99.9% of impurities.
[3:33:01.800 --> 3:33:05.960]  This groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.
[3:33:05.960 --> 3:33:12.960]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Alexa Pure Pro.
[3:33:36.960 --> 3:33:43.600]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world
[3:33:43.600 --> 3:33:46.200]  economy to where it is.
[3:33:46.200 --> 3:33:51.440]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months,
[3:33:51.440 --> 3:33:56.680]  it is going to be a death sentence to the third world, and a horrible nightmarish collapse
[3:33:56.680 --> 3:34:00.680]  for the first world, and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt
[3:34:00.680 --> 3:34:01.680]  to the megabanks.
[3:34:01.680 --> 3:34:05.280]  They're not going to have medical ID cards, force inoculations.
[3:34:05.280 --> 3:34:12.120]  We are now in a giant dystopia, but a lot of people are waking up, and there is a major
[3:34:12.120 --> 3:34:18.520]  backlash taking place against this tyranny, and we must all rediscover our bill of rights,
[3:34:18.520 --> 3:34:23.400]  rediscover our constitution and our backbone, and start saying no to people who take this
[3:34:23.400 --> 3:34:28.120]  moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down, it'll save lives.
[3:34:28.120 --> 3:34:32.720]  No, it's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:36.160]  So the cowards who went along with us with your virtues signaling, you have destroyed
[3:34:36.160 --> 3:34:42.400]  your lives and our lives, congratulations.
[3:34:42.400 --> 3:34:59.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:34:59.040 --> 3:35:10.400]  And now your host, John Rappaport.
[3:35:10.400 --> 3:35:17.280]  I just want to make sure you know at the top of the hour, the war room will be covering
[3:35:17.280 --> 3:35:26.080]  the SpaceX launch, so don't go anywhere and definitely watch that.
[3:35:26.080 --> 3:35:33.400]  So as I was saying, a lot of people who go to church listening to what I'm saying here
[3:35:33.400 --> 3:35:35.080]  would say, is he kidding?
[3:35:35.080 --> 3:35:41.760]  I mean, churches, you know, you come, you pray, you look around, you say, hello, now
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:42.760]  we can't.
[3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:44.520]  Well, we're sort of opening up now.
[3:35:44.520 --> 3:35:51.280]  I don't know, masks or gloves, what are we sitting six feet apart, only 10 people in
[3:35:51.280 --> 3:35:52.440]  the room.
[3:35:52.440 --> 3:36:00.200]  You know, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3:36:00.200 --> 3:36:02.000]  That's not spiritual.
[3:36:02.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  That's not God.
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:04.000]  That's not religion.
[3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:06.960]  That's not what any of this is supposed to be about.
[3:36:06.960 --> 3:36:13.000]  That's not what your preacher or pastor is supposed to be about.
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  Absolutely not.
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:19.720]  It's supposed to be leading the way by saying no lockdown.
[3:36:19.720 --> 3:36:21.320]  No lockdown.
[3:36:21.320 --> 3:36:23.840]  We don't pray to the virus.
[3:36:23.840 --> 3:36:25.920]  We don't pray to Fauci.
[3:36:25.920 --> 3:36:28.800]  Fauci is not the God.
[3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:29.800]  Understood.
[3:36:29.800 --> 3:36:32.960]  Berks is not the God.
[3:36:32.960 --> 3:36:38.040]  You tell us to close our houses of worship or open them.
[3:36:38.040 --> 3:36:43.600]  You give us permission to open our house of worship, really, and then limit what we can
[3:36:43.600 --> 3:36:44.600]  do.
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:48.880]  No, that's not going to happen.
[3:36:48.880 --> 3:36:52.320]  We understand there are going to be consequences.
[3:36:52.320 --> 3:36:53.520]  Bring it on.
[3:36:53.520 --> 3:37:00.640]  In every church, every house of worship, every pastor and leader, oh really, is that what
[3:37:00.640 --> 3:37:01.640]  he's talking about?
[3:37:01.640 --> 3:37:03.680]  I mean, I never heard of such a thing.
[3:37:03.680 --> 3:37:07.160]  Well, if you haven't heard of such a thing, I don't know, try reading the Bible, for
[3:37:07.160 --> 3:37:13.200]  example, or any other religious literature, or delve into the history of some religion
[3:37:13.200 --> 3:37:19.680]  and see what happened early on.
[3:37:19.680 --> 3:37:25.600]  These are the things that turn revolutions around.
[3:37:25.600 --> 3:37:29.600]  When the people who are supposed to be the leaders look deeply enough into their own
[3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:37.960]  soul and find out what spiritual actually means, they're up there on the pulpit already.
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:44.040]  They're producing sermons by the truckload, they're quoting scripture of their particular
[3:37:44.040 --> 3:37:48.360]  religion, they're giving advice and counsel, and so on.
[3:37:48.360 --> 3:37:50.280]  Where is this?
[3:37:50.280 --> 3:37:57.680]  Where is the pronouncement of the primary nature of their religion above and beyond
[3:37:57.680 --> 3:38:00.840]  all governments on earth?
[3:38:00.840 --> 3:38:03.680]  Where is that?
[3:38:03.680 --> 3:38:05.480]  I'm listening.
[3:38:05.480 --> 3:38:07.240]  Where is that?
[3:38:07.240 --> 3:38:14.880]  I'm talking to you pastors and you preachers and you leaders of all churches of all denominations.
[3:38:14.880 --> 3:38:17.240]  Where is that statement?
[3:38:17.240 --> 3:38:24.720]  We are above the dictates of all governments that are repressive and try to limit our worship
[3:38:24.720 --> 3:38:30.360]  and our churches and our spiritual connection.
[3:38:30.360 --> 3:38:38.160]  Don't talk to us about online services and 10 people in the room and six feet and masks.
[3:38:38.160 --> 3:38:46.960]  The doors are open, not because of the physical nature of things, the doors are open ultimately
[3:38:46.960 --> 3:38:53.720]  because this is a place of spiritual connection for all people.
[3:38:53.720 --> 3:38:57.880]  Now you, the government, can try to destroy that.
[3:38:57.880 --> 3:39:01.240]  Let's see you do it if that's what you're intent on.
[3:39:01.240 --> 3:39:08.080]  The cops, whoever it is, the governor, the mayor, who wants to destroy our spiritual
[3:39:08.080 --> 3:39:15.120]  connection which is impossible, it's up to you.
[3:39:15.120 --> 3:39:22.360]  We don't shut down for anything or anybody because we are connected to a higher power
[3:39:22.360 --> 3:39:23.880]  than any of your governments.
[3:39:23.880 --> 3:39:26.800]  That's the whole point, isn't it?
[3:39:26.800 --> 3:39:33.760]  Isn't that the whole point of separation of church and state?
[3:39:33.760 --> 3:39:41.160]  It is to us, if it isn't to you, that's your problem, not our problem.
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:48.280]  And again, I fully understand how a pastor or a preacher would say, that's not for me,
[3:39:48.280 --> 3:39:49.760]  I can't do it.
[3:39:49.760 --> 3:39:51.720]  I'm sorry, I wish I could.
[3:39:51.720 --> 3:39:54.520]  I wish I were that strong, I wish I were that powerful.
[3:39:54.520 --> 3:40:01.240]  I wish I had the depth of the spiritual connection to God that you're referring to, but I guess
[3:40:01.240 --> 3:40:08.120]  I don't because I'm not willing to go all the way and take whatever comes as a result
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:11.520]  of making this spiritual stand.
[3:40:11.520 --> 3:40:15.360]  And I'm going to say that to my congregation.
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:24.480]  I'm going to make that clear to them and I'm going to step down because I must.
[3:40:24.480 --> 3:40:33.880]  Someone else must take over someone with greater depth of spiritual conscience and
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:41.280]  connection to God than I have and somebody does.
[3:40:41.280 --> 3:40:47.480]  Or if nobody does, then the church is empty for the only reason it should be empty because
[3:40:47.480 --> 3:40:53.600]  there's nobody there who had that depth of connection to begin in which case.
[3:40:53.600 --> 3:40:59.520]  What was the charade all about to begin with that church ought to be empty.
[3:40:59.520 --> 3:41:06.880]  It ought to be desperate because it was never anything more than just a pick social gathering.
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:09.240]  It didn't need the government to lock it down.
[3:41:09.240 --> 3:41:16.240]  It just needed the shallowness of the people who inhabited it.
[3:41:16.240 --> 3:41:23.040]  But for every other church, every other preacher, every other pastor, let the people take charge
[3:41:23.040 --> 3:41:29.880]  who are the most willing to make the deepest spiritual connection and to face whatever must
[3:41:29.880 --> 3:41:40.200]  be faced from the civil authorities who want to present themselves as all powerful for
[3:41:40.200 --> 3:41:44.760]  whatever invented reasons they make up.
[3:41:44.760 --> 3:41:47.360]  And they will keep inventing the reasons.
[3:41:47.360 --> 3:41:49.800]  The coronavirus is just another reason.
[3:41:49.800 --> 3:41:51.440]  It's just another story.
[3:41:51.440 --> 3:41:54.200]  It's just another tale.
[3:41:54.200 --> 3:42:01.160]  That's all it is in the face of the greater spiritual dimension, which leads to opening
[3:42:01.160 --> 3:42:07.040]  up everything, opening up the churches, opening up the houses, opening up the apartments,
[3:42:07.040 --> 3:42:13.040]  opening up the streets, opening up the businesses and the companies and commerce and life.
[3:42:13.040 --> 3:42:18.600]  And then we see what happens.
[3:42:18.600 --> 3:42:24.000]  The churches stand at a crossroads.
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  They are at a crossroads.
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:34.920]  And if their congregations will not hold the pastor's feet to the fire, the spiritual fire,
[3:42:34.920 --> 3:42:44.120]  they are to blame, they are responsible for surrender.
[3:42:44.120 --> 3:42:47.200]  It was never meant to be that way.
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:50.760]  There was never on the table.
[3:42:50.760 --> 3:43:00.840]  But apparently it is now, unless it isn't, unless it isn't.
[3:43:00.840 --> 3:43:06.000]  And I can hear people saying, well, that sounds good, but it'll never happen.
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:07.000]  Really?
[3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:09.000]  It'll never happen.
[3:43:09.000 --> 3:43:11.600]  And what are you listening for?
[3:43:11.600 --> 3:43:13.200]  What are you watching for?
[3:43:13.200 --> 3:43:16.920]  What are you hoping for?
[3:43:16.920 --> 3:43:21.760]  Is it just a little bit of adrenaline, a little bit of entertainment, a little way to pass
[3:43:21.760 --> 3:43:22.760]  the time?
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:23.760]  Is that it?
[3:43:23.760 --> 3:43:24.760]  Period?
[3:43:24.760 --> 3:43:27.880]  It'll never happen.
[3:43:27.880 --> 3:43:32.560]  These preachers would never bap-a-bap-a-bap-a-bap about, maybe not.
[3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:36.640]  Their congregations, though, could replace them.
[3:43:36.640 --> 3:43:41.440]  Move out of the way, reverend so-and-so.
[3:43:41.440 --> 3:43:47.840]  We who have been led by you have decided we've had enough.
[3:43:47.840 --> 3:43:49.240]  This isn't enough.
[3:43:49.240 --> 3:43:51.640]  We haven't gone far enough.
[3:43:51.640 --> 3:44:00.120]  The doors have been locked, as if the government has the right to say, your place of the closest
[3:44:00.120 --> 3:44:03.520]  connection to God is now illegal, illegitimate.
[3:44:03.520 --> 3:44:10.480]  We're not going to stand for that.
[3:44:10.480 --> 3:44:19.600]  So either you step up or we'll find somebody who will.
[3:44:19.600 --> 3:44:24.240]  What about these television preachers of 20, 30, 40,000 people sitting in the audience?
[3:44:24.240 --> 3:44:27.680]  I mean, it's just boggling on a Sunday.
[3:44:27.680 --> 3:44:30.200]  What about them?
[3:44:30.200 --> 3:44:31.200]  What are they saying?
[3:44:31.200 --> 3:44:32.400]  What are they doing?
[3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:36.120]  Nothing that I hear, nothing at all.
[3:44:36.120 --> 3:44:38.640]  Where's their spiritual strength?
[3:44:38.640 --> 3:44:41.440]  What are they talking about?
[3:44:41.440 --> 3:44:43.480]  Are they talking about courage?
[3:44:43.480 --> 3:44:44.760]  The courage to do what?
[3:44:44.760 --> 3:44:56.440]  Wear a mask, bow down to the authorities, stand six feet apart, endure the pain of going without
[3:44:56.440 --> 3:45:02.920]  a job and starving?
[3:45:02.920 --> 3:45:10.320]  Take it through, understand.
[3:45:10.320 --> 3:45:13.520]  I really hope it's gotten through.
[3:45:13.520 --> 3:45:17.080]  It's John Rappaport, sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour.
[3:45:17.080 --> 3:45:19.080]  Stay tuned for SpaceX.
[3:45:19.080 --> 3:45:33.880]  See you next time.
