[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[00:16.000 --> 00:30.840]  ladies and gentlemen get ready we're gonna be live here for the next four
[00:30.840 --> 00:34.800]  hours I'm your host Alex Jones co-hosting with me is David Knight
[00:34.800 --> 00:40.040]  wow a lot is happening behind the scenes as well today so a lot is gonna be
[00:40.040 --> 00:44.960]  breaking throughout the transmission obviously 59 cruise missiles a sea
[00:44.960 --> 00:52.440]  launched we're fired into a Russian held base inside Syria last night and I
[00:52.440 --> 00:57.800]  knew that when Trump was an hour late to his meeting with Xi the Chinese
[00:57.800 --> 01:02.200]  dictator they call a president and also knew just thinking about the fact that
[01:02.200 --> 01:06.440]  that would look powerful to the Chinese and you have the Chinese under US
[01:06.440 --> 01:13.640]  control and then he makes Xi wait in Palm Beach for an hour and then he comes
[01:13.640 --> 01:18.520]  marching in yeah I just blew up this base it's it's amazing the optics of the
[01:18.520 --> 01:22.920]  chemical attack and the media selling it as something Assad did would be hard
[01:22.920 --> 01:27.760]  for Trump to ignore even though it's known that the Al Qaeda folks in Syria
[01:27.760 --> 01:32.440]  have been caught launching chemical attacks as false flags before Ron Paul's
[01:32.440 --> 01:36.280]  come out Rand Paul's come out Michael Sabra's come out Nigel Farage's come
[01:36.280 --> 01:40.040]  out Paul Watson's come out they're all pretty upset with President Trump right
[01:40.040 --> 01:45.440]  now from a Machiavelli perspective I know exactly what he's done in fact hit
[01:45.440 --> 01:48.640]  Daniel separate from my own mental breakdown of this has written an
[01:48.640 --> 01:53.080]  analysis is going up soon that is spot-on from the perspective of Trump
[01:53.080 --> 01:59.080]  okay and I'm gonna break down from my sources and a lot of other angles what's
[01:59.080 --> 02:03.440]  happening not what I think but what's happening from Trump's perspective but
[02:03.440 --> 02:08.840]  understand the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray the optics of
[02:08.840 --> 02:15.280]  this with his base and where this is going and how the Russians see this is
[02:15.280 --> 02:18.800]  very very serious I said last night I said I guarantee you the Russians got
[02:18.800 --> 02:22.760]  warned not to be there hours later it came out but that's because our military
[02:22.760 --> 02:25.840]  and the Russians for four years have been coordinating strikes working together
[02:25.840 --> 02:31.640]  we broke all that news info wars does not like what's happening our audience
[02:31.640 --> 02:36.200]  almost universally hates it but I understand why the president's doing
[02:36.200 --> 02:41.160]  it so we'll look at both sides will also look at the big shift in power that we
[02:41.160 --> 02:44.880]  first broke months ago with Jared Kushner and others preparing to drive
[02:44.880 --> 02:48.560]  out a Stephen Bannon to Stephen Bannon's credit two days ago he was out of
[02:48.560 --> 02:52.960]  the National Security Council after the strike happens saying look this is a
[02:52.960 --> 02:58.520]  false flag this will turn your base against you it's a quagmire Hillary and
[02:58.520 --> 03:03.360]  the neocons invaded Syria this is morally wrong do not do this and Trump
[03:03.360 --> 03:08.400]  says as he said in the press conference I own Syria now I'm the president I'm
[03:08.400 --> 03:11.480]  not gonna just sit there and blame them for making the mess I'm gonna fix it this
[03:11.480 --> 03:15.680]  is all happening right as US forces have gone above they say 10,000 it's way
[03:15.680 --> 03:20.960]  above that there is a ground war now our forces are driving out al-Qaeda in a
[03:20.960 --> 03:26.800]  pencil attack into Syria out of Syria into Iraq but what happens when they're
[03:26.800 --> 03:29.400]  destroyed well the deal four years ago that our military broke up with the
[03:29.400 --> 03:33.240]  Russians is Assad will look at being a coalition or stepping down so I
[03:33.240 --> 03:37.200]  believe that's why Trump's moving forward because now he's eyeing Damascus
[03:37.200 --> 03:41.000]  and telling him it's time to fulfill your promises I have all the articles the
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.680]  agreement Sy Hershey's reported on as well David nice got a lot of angles on
[03:44.680 --> 03:48.480]  this we'll tell you about the four big guests today a lot of them with inside
[03:48.480 --> 03:52.080]  knowledge of this but first David what is your angle on this well Alex as we're
[03:52.080 --> 03:55.520]  looking at this the rapid turnaround that is something that people are very
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.920]  concerned about if Trump wants to appear to be strong it works against him to the
[04:00.920 --> 04:03.920]  other side of this is that you could see that he's vacillating that he's
[04:03.920 --> 04:09.680]  perhaps betraying his his promises to the American people he ran on a policy of
[04:09.680 --> 04:14.120]  America first we were not attacked as Rand Paul pointed out he needs to fix
[04:14.120 --> 04:18.200]  what's wrong here in America before he starts taking down monsters abroad and
[04:18.200 --> 04:21.720]  if you want to talk about optics we need to talk about the optics of just what
[04:21.720 --> 04:25.560]  happened in Stockholm today we need to understand the long-term game of this
[04:25.560 --> 04:30.320]  because it's this population shift that's being driven by the globalist that
[04:30.320 --> 04:35.240]  is resulting in them taking over trucks and running people down it was I I was
[04:35.240 --> 04:38.660]  very upset about the hundred people that were run down by a truck in the
[04:38.660 --> 04:43.200]  Christmas market in Berlin so we have to understand where this is all headed
[04:43.200 --> 04:47.300]  and these you point out it's really the the power play that's going on the
[04:47.300 --> 04:51.080]  regime change and the White House that's right and if you only look at just what's
[04:51.080 --> 04:54.800]  happening with Trump you missed the big picture as you said it's about global
[04:54.800 --> 05:01.400]  colonization using Islam the takedown of Europe Corey Lewandowski Paul Manafort
[05:01.400 --> 05:06.440]  Mike Flynn Steve Bannon and now Devin Nunes it seems the left's intimidation
[05:06.440 --> 05:10.280]  tactics are actually working Nunes is the latest to be asked to step aside after
[05:10.280 --> 05:13.520]  an intense few weeks of grilling from the left as the House Intelligence
[05:13.520 --> 05:16.880]  chairman has now recused himself from the Russian probe isn't that too
[05:16.880 --> 05:20.200]  convenient for the Democrats to have the only one involved in this Russian
[05:20.200 --> 05:23.600]  probe who actually seems to care about the truth of the matter step aside and
[05:23.600 --> 05:27.240]  recuse himself just to rub our noses in it representative Adam Schiff
[05:27.240 --> 05:30.200]  Democrat member of the House Intelligence Committee made a public
[05:30.200 --> 05:33.800]  statement moments after Nunes's announcement saying how pleased he was
[05:33.800 --> 05:37.960]  to hear of Nunes's recusal so now the Democrats have a monopoly on the
[05:37.960 --> 05:41.640]  political witch hunt that is the Russian probe thanks Nunes the Republicans
[05:41.640 --> 05:44.720]  have gotten their leverage democratically and refuse to use it the
[05:44.720 --> 05:48.800]  Democrats get their leverage with smear campaigns and use it successfully and if
[05:48.800 --> 05:52.760]  we keep allowing them to do it they're going to continue President Trump the
[05:52.760 --> 06:00.520]  swamp is draining us for info wars.com this is Owen Schreuer today we call it

[07:59.440 --> 08:15.440]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[08:15.440 --> 08:33.440]  lines of the info war here we are Friday April 7 2017 the world changed on
[08:33.440 --> 08:38.440]  April 6th the Communist Chinese dictator was just arriving in Marlago
[08:38.440 --> 08:45.920]  Florida he's kept waiting for an hour president of the United States Donald J. Trump walked in
[08:45.920 --> 08:49.520]  and said excuse me sorry I just ordered a cruise missile attack that just
[08:49.520 --> 08:57.360]  commenced 10 minutes ago now let's go ahead and negotiate about the peninsula
[08:57.360 --> 09:02.360]  the South China Sea in North Korea so this is paradoxical from a historic
[09:02.360 --> 09:06.520]  perspective from a Machiavelli perspective I understand exactly what
[09:06.520 --> 09:10.720]  President Trump's doing and it's genius and it's all been executed flawlessly
[09:10.720 --> 09:18.720]  with extreme ballet like grace that said the optics for his key base is ruinous
[09:18.720 --> 09:23.320]  and it's part of a larger maneuvering going on in the White House to drive him
[09:23.320 --> 09:27.160]  away from his base and into the arms the Democratic Party and I knew this from
[09:27.160 --> 09:30.920]  sources I knew this watching it but with the health care thing with Jared
[09:30.920 --> 09:34.720]  Kushner being away for a week skiing when he admittedly helped engineer it
[09:34.720 --> 09:40.080]  with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan it's disastrous Kushner comes back and
[09:40.080 --> 09:44.080]  then convinces the president that it's the fault of the freedom caucus who are
[09:44.080 --> 09:46.400]  the only people that are actually a hundred percent living up to their
[09:46.400 --> 09:51.520]  promises and of the folks there to keep Trump honest Steve Bannon keeps saying
[09:51.520 --> 09:54.720]  hold our feet to the fire hold our feet to the fire you notice he was removed
[09:54.720 --> 09:58.560]  two days ago when the decision was made to do this he said it's horrible so
[09:58.560 --> 10:04.240]  Bannon as I said is the real deal what a rarity Trump is as well but the
[10:04.240 --> 10:10.000]  optics of the nerve gas of the media unanimously saying it's that of the
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.800]  intelligence from the Pentagon his blind spot is completely trusting the top
[10:14.800 --> 10:17.920]  brass in their analysts because look at the fake you know the Office of Special
[10:17.920 --> 10:21.160]  Plans about Iraq WMD's and all the stuff with Bush of course it turned out he
[10:21.160 --> 10:25.080]  ordered the fake documents he told Tony Blair on the Downing Street memo so
[10:25.080 --> 10:28.320]  David Knight's gonna be co-hosting here today we've got Roger Stone coming up
[10:28.320 --> 10:32.440]  Joel Scowze and Dr. Steve Pacinic Dr. Jerome Corsi Paul Watson who says he's
[10:32.440 --> 10:36.440]  getting off the Trump train maybe he was just mad last night but we'll see he's
[10:36.440 --> 10:39.480]  gonna be hosting from London England in the fourth hour by the way and about a
[10:39.480 --> 10:42.480]  two weeks Paul's coming here for two weeks to co-host the show of myself
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.600]  David Knight and more kind of kicking the tires about moving here but let's just
[10:46.600 --> 10:53.000]  stop right there paradoxically in a cold way you know using the psychopath
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.840]  region that we all have in our brains and the psychopath that just runs things
[10:56.840 --> 11:02.240]  there's no conscience I can see the cold-blooded execution of this and I
[11:02.240 --> 11:07.160]  understand geopolitically why it's been done I understand that they're taking a
[11:07.160 --> 11:10.200]  false flag that was clearly launched I would say by the neocons and the
[11:10.200 --> 11:13.800]  globalist McCain was just there a month ago the same group he's been funding
[11:13.800 --> 11:17.040]  has been caught doing it before that's confirmed even New York Times admits the
[11:17.040 --> 11:21.680]  rebels you know did get caught launching the false flags Obama creates a red
[11:21.680 --> 11:25.840]  line on the year anniversary a chemical attack it's launched when the chemicals
[11:25.840 --> 11:29.560]  aren't even good for war in these populated areas why would Assad do
[11:29.560 --> 11:33.520]  something knowing it brings in the United States one week after Rex
[11:33.520 --> 11:38.920]  Tillerson said he said last Wednesday one week every said looks like we're
[11:38.920 --> 11:43.960]  gonna have Assad staying in power and transition out then they go and chemical
[11:43.960 --> 11:48.440]  attack right as the United States is defeating al-Qaeda defeating ISIS our
[11:48.440 --> 11:51.440]  military are the ones five years ago that said they wouldn't be part of
[11:51.440 --> 11:55.400]  backing al-Qaeda and ISIS it was this broadcast it was drudge report it was
[11:55.400 --> 11:59.360]  Rand Paul the senator it was it was others that came out and said no a great
[11:59.360 --> 12:03.680]  moral moment for America England joined us for the first time in over a hundred
[12:03.680 --> 12:08.960]  years and voted against Obama and the war but voted with the American people
[12:08.960 --> 12:13.760]  against war so this was an unprecedented moment now as we're defeating ISIS
[12:13.760 --> 12:19.080]  driving amount of eastern Syria into western Iraq as the Iraqis come in as a
[12:19.080 --> 12:22.000]  pincir attack right as they're being defeated and announcing they're being
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.800]  defeated boom there's a chemical attack and now we hear we've got to come in on
[12:28.800 --> 12:32.920]  the side of the poor little darling rebels and there's all these kids reading
[12:32.920 --> 12:37.920]  off teleprompters on TV that aren't even in Syria deceiving the viewing
[12:37.920 --> 12:42.080]  audience so again Ron Paul is totally on target this is clearly a false flag
[12:42.080 --> 12:46.280]  he's a hundred percent a false flag keep on oh I mean why would Assad fight so
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.960]  hard to do the one thing right when he's assured of victory that destroys it so
[12:51.960 --> 12:55.240]  you can see the flip-flop the Pentagon wants him out they'll work with him to
[12:55.240 --> 13:00.720]  get rid of the al-Qaeda folks ISIS slash al-Nazra but now that it's down to the
[13:00.720 --> 13:06.600]  wire back to the old policy not a policy of Hillary to put al-Qaeda in charge our
[13:06.600 --> 13:10.480]  military said no to that but they said we'll kick out al-Qaeda and then we'll
[13:10.480 --> 13:15.320]  kick out Assad as well so you're seeing a triple cross and the Pentagon's all for
[13:15.320 --> 13:19.280]  it and I think it's immoral because Hillary and Obama started the war with
[13:19.280 --> 13:24.640]  the neocons they went in there Syria never attacked us and it's immoral so
[13:24.640 --> 13:30.160]  we're in a six-year immoral operation finally our military said no and now
[13:30.160 --> 13:34.120]  they've confused the situation so that the rank-and-file military is confused
[13:34.120 --> 13:37.560]  but I'll tell you they're not our audience isn't but I think Trump has been
[13:37.560 --> 13:40.720]  deceived and I'm not just defending him just to defend him because I talked to
[13:40.720 --> 13:43.960]  him on the phone sometimes or you know whatever that's gone on behind the
[13:43.960 --> 13:47.960]  scenes quite frankly I've been too busy to even you know have more contact with
[13:47.960 --> 13:52.120]  Trump even if I wanted to or he wanted to okay bottom line I'm about getting the
[13:52.120 --> 13:55.960]  work done right here in Texas so I don't have some little you know starry eyed
[13:55.960 --> 14:00.760]  thing for Donald J. Trump I know he's restoring the economy I know he killed
[14:00.760 --> 14:06.240]  TPP I know he's destroying political correctness I know he's doing so many
[14:06.240 --> 14:09.760]  good things it makes my head spin three trillion the stock market best small
[14:09.760 --> 14:14.120]  business job numbers ever so again I see this talking point mean by the bots
[14:14.120 --> 14:20.520]  everywhere everywhere saying and we can look at and we know it's it's you know
[14:20.520 --> 14:27.200]  from the whole Soros funded group that media matters runs saying everywhere
[14:27.200 --> 14:31.800]  aha Trump's a warmonger he's backing al-qaeda Alex Jones is backing war aha
[14:31.800 --> 14:35.000]  you're all discredited while the establishment left backs Trump while
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.280]  the neocons pat him on the head and suddenly say okay he's a good guy now
[14:38.280 --> 14:42.320]  as long as he does what we say and is our slave the the low-level left that's
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.400]  defended all these wars on this carnage suddenly flooding the internet that it's
[14:46.400 --> 14:51.400]  the end of Alex Jones and he's been caught backing an evil person and oh my
[14:51.400 --> 14:55.800]  god he supports the war in Syria when I was on the air yesterday saying don't do
[14:55.800 --> 15:00.040]  it and Rand Paul was saying don't do it we're the moral people that were against
[15:00.040 --> 15:03.520]  the war all along we're the ones that woke the military up I'm not taking credit
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.280]  just get it straight why they hate us so much because we really don't look at
[15:07.280 --> 15:10.920]  things Machiavelli we understand them Machiavelli maybe better than those that
[15:10.920 --> 15:15.200]  think they're Machiavelli because you know they've always said you can't you
[15:15.200 --> 15:19.120]  can't con an honest man these globalists con themselves with wheels with
[15:19.120 --> 15:22.640]  and wheels and manipulation and backstabbing the Middle East is the
[15:22.640 --> 15:26.000]  greatest at backstabbing and manipulation and they can't have a
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.840]  civilization Christian Western Renaissance culture is based on
[15:30.840 --> 15:38.240]  chivalry and honor and and in Texas a handshake still a deal under law and all
[15:38.240 --> 15:43.280]  you got is your family name and that means your family's known and you're
[15:43.280 --> 15:47.120]  known for doing what you say you're gonna do and standing for what you stand
[15:47.120 --> 15:51.320]  for and that's why they always attack us and say we're immoral or we're
[15:51.320 --> 15:55.000]  manipulative or we're liars because they can't stand the fact that we're
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.720]  hardcore telling the truth so paradoxically Trump it's really
[15:59.720 --> 16:05.560]  disintegrating and and in my eyes on many levels but paradoxically he's doing
[16:05.560 --> 16:10.240]  so much good that I realized they're maneuvering him into bad so they won't
[16:10.240 --> 16:14.080]  call him a Russian agent so he can look tough to the Russians so he can look
[16:14.080 --> 16:17.920]  tough to the Chinese and so he can shut down his critics that once you feed the
[16:17.920 --> 16:22.320]  pirate they're gonna want more more more and they're already so unpopular
[16:22.320 --> 16:26.560]  maybe having the establishment on your side 30 years ago was good it's coffin
[16:26.560 --> 16:32.400]  nails now it's the it's the kiss of death now okay so him going into the arms
[16:32.400 --> 16:35.920]  of the establishment is Kushner and Priebus and Ryan have been telling him
[16:35.920 --> 16:39.840]  is the only thing that will defeat him when Rand Paul kind of went with the
[16:39.840 --> 16:42.920]  establishment a little bit at least in rhetoric he his poll numbers went way
[16:42.920 --> 16:48.640]  down when he got hardcore again he's the new star again okay so this is an
[16:48.640 --> 16:54.600]  incredible time to be alive I'm simply asking would you rather have had
[16:54.600 --> 16:59.400]  Hillary in I'm not defending Trump I'm saying look at all the angles of why
[16:59.400 --> 17:03.480]  they think it was a good idea I don't think it was we're gonna lay that out it
[17:03.480 --> 17:06.480]  was genius from the Machiavelli perspective but that's third-dimensional
[17:06.480 --> 17:11.800]  stuff not fifth sixth seventh then paradoxically look at all the good in
[17:11.800 --> 17:14.560]  the economy look at the globalist panicking look at them throwing everything
[17:14.560 --> 17:17.880]  they got at us look at the state's rallying to bring back in control and
[17:17.880 --> 17:22.120]  local jobs and family and the poison of globalism worldwide collapsing and
[17:22.120 --> 17:27.720]  nationalist movements and free market movements expanding this is a great time
[17:27.720 --> 17:32.240]  to be alive good things are happening I'm not going to be demoralized whichever
[17:32.240 --> 17:35.760]  direction Trump goes I'll try to keep on the straight and narrow or where
[17:35.760 --> 17:41.360]  Farage goes early pin but I know you're not gonna waver back off and I'm not
[17:41.360 --> 17:44.520]  either and either David Knight we're gonna skip this network break and better
[17:44.520 --> 17:47.560]  about not doing that but this is obviously wartime stuff with mainstream
[17:47.560 --> 17:52.040]  news saying verge of World War three we're gonna be covering it all here
[17:52.040 --> 17:56.080]  today but David Knight could World War three happen how chemical and nuclear
[17:56.080 --> 18:00.080]  warfare could lead to the apocalypse that's the headlines today you've heard
[18:00.080 --> 18:03.400]  my breakdown we're gonna have some of the crew pop in a bunch of other guests
[18:03.400 --> 18:08.920]  but what do you make of this this is clearly a big turn by Trump he knows
[18:08.920 --> 18:12.840]  it's a false flag his advisors told him it was Flynn explained it all to him the
[18:12.840 --> 18:16.200]  architect of getting our military to not back all kind of the last five years in
[18:16.200 --> 18:20.200]  Syria he knew though that they'd knocked him to the ground with this they were
[18:20.200 --> 18:23.880]  gonna say look you did nothing about Russia and try to destroy him so I
[18:23.880 --> 18:29.320]  believe he made lemonade out of lemons and actually took their evil energy in
[18:29.320 --> 18:34.920]  and basically threw it back at him and now has had a big victory currently the
[18:34.920 --> 18:40.640]  problem is it leads us into the addiction that is war always being the way for a
[18:40.640 --> 18:45.880]  statesman to get his enemies to shut their mouths you know Alex I think when
[18:45.880 --> 18:49.120]  we look at the people who are congratulating Donald Trump today we
[18:49.120 --> 18:52.920]  see we've got ISIS Al Qaeda tweeting their responses saying we like what you're
[18:52.920 --> 18:58.200]  doing Pelosi Schumer on the Democrat side of course Hillary Clinton giving an
[18:58.200 --> 19:01.320]  interview yesterday before this happened indicating some foreknowledge perhaps on
[19:01.320 --> 19:06.320]  her part we do know that there was foreknowledge in Syria we had Syrian
[19:06.320 --> 19:09.760]  girl on yesterday we talked to her about the indications that will give the
[19:09.760 --> 19:12.600]  details of that later on we'll recap that again for you but then look on the
[19:12.600 --> 19:16.760]  Republican side we got McCain Graham Rubio loving this we've got Nigel
[19:16.760 --> 19:21.000]  Frage however pushing back against it we've got Erdogan in Turkey we've got the
[19:21.000 --> 19:25.920]  EU presidents Tusk and Yonker saying this is wonderful and then this I think
[19:25.920 --> 19:30.200]  says it all Alex we got Elliott Abrams in weekly standard and I always spell
[19:30.200 --> 19:34.120]  that W.E.A.K. the king of the never Trumpers that's right Elliott Abrams
[19:34.120 --> 19:37.680]  Bill Crystal the people who have opposed Trump from the very beginning they said
[19:37.680 --> 19:42.120]  this a Trump administration has now started finally he has accepted the
[19:42.120 --> 19:46.280]  role of leader of the free world we did not vote for Donald Trump to be the
[19:46.280 --> 19:50.400]  president of the world we voted for him to be the president of America to put
[19:50.400 --> 19:54.440]  America first and that's what concerns me so much we can talk about all the
[19:54.440 --> 19:58.160]  Machiavellian movements and everything you know what the the definition of
[19:58.160 --> 20:01.960]  Machiavellianism is being cunning scheming and unscrupulous being
[20:01.960 --> 20:06.120]  duplicitous and so as you were just saying Alex when you give somebody your
[20:06.120 --> 20:09.280]  word when you shake your hand on that that means something that should mean
[20:09.280 --> 20:12.760]  something for a statesman if you're going to be a statesman they should
[20:12.760 --> 20:15.600]  mean that you've got principles instead of the fact that you're like a
[20:15.600 --> 20:18.720]  rudderless ship that's being blown around by everybody that comes in and
[20:18.720 --> 20:22.400]  this is what we saw four years ago Donald Trump knew exactly what was going
[20:22.400 --> 20:27.120]  on he said to our very foolish leader do not attack Syria if you do very many
[20:27.120 --> 20:31.040]  bad things will happen and from that fight the US gets nothing and on and on
[20:31.040 --> 20:34.440]  and on do not attack there all these tweets that he put out he was right
[20:34.440 --> 20:38.920]  about that four years ago he was right about it 48 hours ago and as you pointed
[20:38.920 --> 20:42.600]  out Alex we had Rex Tillerson saying we're not going to do regime change that
[20:42.600 --> 20:46.600]  has set the Middle East on fire it has created a mass exodus of people which is
[20:46.600 --> 20:50.560]  the long and now they admit it's going to be worse because if Al Qaeda ends up
[20:50.560 --> 20:54.640]  getting control that's like 90% of the country now they've all invaded then
[20:54.640 --> 20:58.320]  it's our doorway right into Europe I mean this is crazy but the other part of
[20:58.320 --> 21:03.000]  this Alex is not just the regime change in Syria but the regime change in the
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.040]  White House and that's what I'm concerned about the fact that we've got
[21:06.040 --> 21:09.880]  Jared Kushner bringing in a Zika manual Rahm Emanuel's brother the
[21:09.880 --> 21:14.960]  architect of Obamacare multiple times had three meetings with senior policy
[21:14.960 --> 21:19.200]  advisors one meeting with Donald Trump and of course Zika manual said Obamacare
[21:19.200 --> 21:22.880]  is not going to get repealed that was taken off the table the repeal of Obamacare
[21:22.880 --> 21:26.480]  that's right it's a fact we're not just blaming Kushner here as the media is
[21:26.480 --> 21:29.800]  trying to spin and all this stuff and saying oh is he anti-semitic I don't
[21:29.800 --> 21:35.120]  care if Jerry if Kushner's Jewish German or whatever he is if he's a globalist if
[21:35.120 --> 21:38.240]  he's selling out our agenda to restore the Republic I don't like him I would
[21:38.240 --> 21:42.320]  have voted for Barry Goldwater in one second he was an amazing guy that started
[21:42.320 --> 21:45.680]  the whole modern Liberty movement he was Jewish I could care less if you're
[21:45.680 --> 21:50.000]  Jewish or not but I love how the media changes the subject Kushner's been a
[21:50.000 --> 21:56.440]  Democrat yeah okay and he's bringing in the people that sabotage the repeal of
[21:56.440 --> 22:01.040]  Obamacare when we had the votes and then goes off skiing so he doesn't get the
[22:01.040 --> 22:06.040]  blame and his father-in-law does and I'm sorry Donald Trump you're gonna do an
[22:06.040 --> 22:09.560]  analysis later and so is Roger Stones coming on I was told everything about
[22:09.560 --> 22:12.880]  Kushner not just by stomach by others and we've known all along we were just
[22:12.880 --> 22:17.080]  hoping that Kushner was smart enough to realize his star rises and falls with
[22:17.080 --> 22:22.000]  Trump if he thinks he's going to derail Trump and then be the golden boy down the
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.280]  road he's an idiot Kushner if you just got behind the Republic and making
[22:26.280 --> 22:29.720]  America great then America would dominate the world with culture and
[22:29.720 --> 22:34.000]  innovation we're going to destroy the world with these endless wars and
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.760]  acting tough with a bunch of wimps all these neocons have never been in the
[22:37.760 --> 22:41.160]  military they're constantly running around acting like tough guys and the
[22:41.160 --> 22:44.680]  people like Stephen Bannon who has been in the military just telling you this
[22:44.680 --> 22:50.600]  has got to stop this is what destroyed America soft power do you understand but
[22:50.600 --> 22:55.480]  no Kushner's the guy behind the scenes shooting down people like Bannon and
[22:55.480 --> 22:58.680]  others and previous who you think's bad they're getting ready to bring in the
[22:58.680 --> 23:04.120]  rest of Kushner's people and Trump has got to get Jesus on this you know he is
[23:04.120 --> 23:08.680]  allying himself with Gary Cohen the former number two at Goldman Sachs and
[23:08.680 --> 23:13.120]  Lee Stranahan broke it down very well he said it's the same globalism but a
[23:13.120 --> 23:17.280]  different bank because we had Citibank that was behind Obama and now we've got
[23:17.280 --> 23:22.200]  Goldman Sachs with the help of Jared Kushner and Politico no friend of Donald
[23:22.200 --> 23:25.080]  Trump and certainly this isn't anti-Semitism they said there's the
[23:25.080 --> 23:29.120]  West Wing Democrats talking about Kushner and Gary Cohen and so it's not
[23:29.120 --> 23:33.840]  just Obamacare where Kushner and Cohen bring in Zeke Emanuel the architect of
[23:33.840 --> 23:39.680]  Obamacare but then on trade we've got Cohen who is now the chair of the
[23:39.680 --> 23:44.000]  Economic Council for Donald Trump bringing in the architect of TPP now
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.440]  Donald Trump got rid of TPP on day one but now they're pushing back with Cohen
[23:49.440 --> 23:54.840]  and Kushner and with the other look at it going as being a chief of staff yes
[23:54.840 --> 23:57.840]  yes exactly and so now they're talking about what we're gonna get rid of
[23:57.840 --> 24:01.680]  previous and Bannon and there's an article talking about the four
[24:01.680 --> 24:04.520]  possibilities that they'll put in there and by the way there's Gary Cohen
[24:04.520 --> 24:08.040]  just drudge almost jumped off the reservation with this healthcare thing
[24:08.040 --> 24:12.240]  two weeks ago and said what is going on I want my tax cuts I want this rip off
[24:12.240 --> 24:15.880]  Obamacare gone the country wants it it's gonna kill the economy what is this
[24:15.880 --> 24:19.760]  sideways deal what's drudge gonna do now that that Trump's going more sideways
[24:19.760 --> 24:24.080]  I'm going with this because we would have Hillary we have things 10 times
[24:24.080 --> 24:26.800]  worse and I don't believe in lesser two evils I'm gonna give Trump time to
[24:26.800 --> 24:29.640]  figure this out and that was talking to Roger Stone this morning and others and
[24:29.640 --> 24:33.680]  he said look Trump really trusts his family and other people but he's going
[24:33.680 --> 24:37.600]  to get this he's going to figure it out he likes to delegate and see what
[24:37.600 --> 24:43.000]  people do and so he's going down the line right now so again I'm in a holding
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.640]  pattern I think people should be upset we should hold people's feet to the fire
[24:46.640 --> 24:50.920]  we should say don't expand this war more now you better kick out the radical
[24:50.920 --> 24:55.800]  Wahhabist and not Assad Assad agreed to leave later or be part of a coalition but
[24:55.800 --> 24:59.840]  now is not the time because I mean now what's gonna happen guaranteed the
[24:59.840 --> 25:03.720]  al-Qaeda rebels who've been caught doing an al-Nusra ISIS aren't going to launch
[25:03.720 --> 25:06.720]  another chemical attack they've done it four or five times they've been caught
[25:06.720 --> 25:11.320]  the UN even admitted they did it so the point is this is only gonna escalate more
[25:11.320 --> 25:15.960]  false flags and as you said it's so surreal David Knight that you just said
[25:15.960 --> 25:22.040]  al-Qaeda ISIS all tweeting in support of Trump now and on top of it you've got the
[25:22.040 --> 25:25.320]  weekly standard who said never Trump is throwing supporting and Glenn Beck
[25:25.320 --> 25:29.880]  suddenly supporting him Chucky Schumer suddenly supporting Nancy Pelosi is
[25:29.880 --> 25:36.080]  suddenly supporting him all of this craziness is going on and these are all
[25:36.080 --> 25:41.200]  of his enemies he doesn't need his enemies to support him in fact let's
[25:41.200 --> 25:47.000]  hear from the president let's play the short clip of his statement on why he
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles saying that Assad has this blood on his hands
[25:53.000 --> 25:58.520]  ladies and gentlemen we also see Hailey is telling the UN unanimous
[25:58.520 --> 26:01.680]  intelligence believes this funny I've talked a lot of folks that are in the
[26:01.680 --> 26:06.920]  military you name it none of them none of them are buying that Assad on his
[26:06.920 --> 26:11.080]  hour of victory he's about to blow up the al-Qaeda Death Star yeah and then he
[26:11.080 --> 26:15.920]  blows up his own base this picture of her here she is an AP she's she's there
[26:15.920 --> 26:20.680]  at the UN holding a picture of a dead baby that that is absolutely absolutely
[26:20.680 --> 26:23.680]  yeah take a picture of this let's put it back on screen you guys holding a
[26:23.680 --> 26:27.760]  picture of a dead baby and that's her proof this is just like the babies in
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.640]  the incubators with a PR firm in 1990 so let's go ahead and play Donald J. Trump
[26:32.640 --> 26:37.800]  and again this is a war why did Bannon say hold their feet to the fire why did
[26:37.800 --> 26:41.520]  Bannon say hold their feet to the fire why'd he say it two months ago in a
[26:41.520 --> 26:45.400]  month ago because he needed help he was being blocked everywhere and guess what
[26:45.400 --> 26:49.560]  Bannon has said I'm ready for a gunfight he's ready to leave and go back to
[26:49.560 --> 26:53.360]  Breitbart and I cannot wait because we're gonna defeat the Democrats we're
[26:53.360 --> 26:57.440]  gonna defeat the neocons and people in the Trump administration and we're gonna
[26:57.440 --> 27:01.040]  restore our republic and we're gonna have nationalist takeover everywhere and
[27:01.040 --> 27:05.320]  we're gonna have a new golden era of prosperity if we can stop the globalist
[27:05.320 --> 27:09.320]  causing World War three the horrible communist in China the the the
[27:09.320 --> 27:13.800]  authoritarianism in Russia the super authoritarianism of the EU all of its
[27:13.800 --> 27:18.320]  being reversed humanity wants freedom and that's what this is about I get the
[27:18.320 --> 27:22.720]  optics I know I Trump did it he's being advised by his generals who knows
[27:22.720 --> 27:25.120]  maybe one chance out of a hundred the Syrians really did it you know the
[27:25.120 --> 27:28.840]  Russians said maybe we accidentally we were storing munitions there maybe we
[27:28.840 --> 27:32.720]  accidentally drop chemicals I saw that report effect reprint it that's the one
[27:32.720 --> 27:35.720]  thing that makes me think maybe they thought they could blame the rebels
[27:35.720 --> 27:38.760]  because they did it before and go ahead and use chemicals but that just seems
[27:38.760 --> 27:42.440]  or maybe they had a pilot who was a false flag because you can have that there
[27:42.440 --> 27:45.800]  it is Russia offers alternative theory for Syrian attacks his regime hit
[27:45.800 --> 27:49.040]  chemical munitions depot well that's one where they said yeah maybe they
[27:49.040 --> 27:52.480]  actually bombed a depot and we know that the rebels do have those so maybe
[27:52.480 --> 27:58.120]  that's the case but here is president Trump's response
[27:58.480 --> 28:07.280]  Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on
[28:07.280 --> 28:15.520]  innocent civilians using a deadly nerve agent Assad choked out the lives of
[28:15.520 --> 28:26.880]  helpless men women and children it was a slow and brutal death for so many even
[28:26.880 --> 28:38.360]  beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack no child of
[28:38.360 --> 28:46.560]  God should ever suffer such horror tonight I ordered a targeted military strike
[28:46.560 --> 28:56.600]  on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched it is in
[28:56.600 --> 29:03.940]  this vital national security interests of the United States to prevent and
[29:03.940 --> 29:11.560]  deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons there can be no
[29:11.560 --> 29:19.720]  dispute that Syria uses banned chemical weapons violated its obligations under
[29:19.720 --> 29:27.800]  the chemical weapons convention and ignored the urging of the UN security
[29:27.800 --> 29:31.440]  camp we're gonna come back with more we've got roger stone and so much more
[29:31.440 --> 29:36.240]  David Knight co-hosting here weather slates gentlemen Paul Watson is really
[29:36.240 --> 29:40.800]  wound up he's gonna be on in the fourth hour edit the Trump train run off the

[33:31.280 --> 33:35.640]  analysis and take on this and then we've got so many other Dr. Steve Pachennick
[33:35.640 --> 33:39.240]  Joel Scows and popping in Dr. Jerome Corsi Paul Watson David Knight is

[33:47.360 --> 33:50.680]  this hour that's the whole war room situation we're in we're going to go
[33:50.680 --> 33:56.240]  to Roger Stone with this analysis and take on this in a minute if you're
[33:56.240 --> 34:00.360]  looking for just boiled down stuff like this attacks good or this attacks bad
[34:00.360 --> 34:04.280]  or Trump is good or Trump is bad it's the wrong broadcast I'm not here dumbing
[34:04.280 --> 34:10.560]  media down I'm really giving you a serious breakdown of what I believe and
[34:10.560 --> 34:17.920]  what I stand for on the drudge poll 65.99% out of 118,000 votes we should
[34:17.920 --> 34:21.200]  put up our own vote similar to drudge and get everybody to go vote and see what
[34:21.200 --> 34:25.120]  our listeners think on info wars.com we should go get the summer polls he uses
[34:25.120 --> 34:28.680]  that's a good system he uses sometimes he has millions of voters drudge poll
[34:28.680 --> 34:37.240]  Trump strikes aside good 65.99% bad 20% don't know 13% so go vote on that at
[34:37.240 --> 34:41.680]  drudgereport.com we'll be watching it as well and you notice the headline there
[34:41.680 --> 34:47.600]  it's also on info wars.com Russian warship on the move attacking Syria
[34:47.600 --> 34:50.880]  again you'll need to get through me Russia battleship is positioned between
[34:50.880 --> 34:56.800]  US warship and runway hit by Trump's airstrike and all these mainline
[34:56.800 --> 34:59.880]  analysts say World War three could be triggered Trump's meeting with the
[34:59.880 --> 35:04.520]  Russian you folks sometime in the future but he's meeting with the Chinese
[35:04.520 --> 35:08.720]  dictator right now notice he called Assad a dictator which is true he's not
[35:08.720 --> 35:15.560]  calling Xi a dictator is he no so we're gonna talk about that in a moment you know
[35:15.560 --> 35:19.200]  like what he's doing on the economy and so much more but his Rand Paul and his
[35:19.200 --> 35:23.720]  Nigel Farage and others have said this breaks with everything he said he was
[35:23.720 --> 35:26.360]  going to do and he knows what's really been happening in Syria he knows about
[35:26.360 --> 35:30.120]  the false flags but Trump probably knew he couldn't convince the public of that
[35:30.120 --> 35:34.080]  and this would probably have destroyed him so in a way I'm kind of glad he got
[35:34.080 --> 35:39.080]  up off the mat and turned lemons and eliminate and a struct some chemical
[35:39.080 --> 35:43.440]  weapons so they'd be destroyed nobody was killed but then the neocons celebrate
[35:43.440 --> 35:46.920]  and I wonder where that takes us where that goes I mean he is cleaning out
[35:46.920 --> 35:50.400]  Al Qaeda they are beating them now they're turning towards I guess making a
[35:50.400 --> 35:55.840]  sidestep down I guess I just don't like the fact of who's in control of this and
[35:55.840 --> 35:59.360]  all these corrupt Democrats and others and John McCain celebrating and John
[35:59.360 --> 36:03.120]  McCain saying the natural order of Washington has now returned to where it
[36:03.120 --> 36:10.840]  should be again it's a complex issue I don't waffle on topics I'm pro gun I'm
[36:10.840 --> 36:14.440]  pro choice but when you're talking about something like this this is
[36:14.440 --> 36:20.120]  geopolitical this is very very complex but I know this it better not widen and
[36:20.120 --> 36:23.960]  they better not put Al Qaeda or ISIS or any of those Wahhabist groups in
[36:23.960 --> 36:28.400]  control as a huge gateway into Turkey in the West all part of this globalist
[36:28.400 --> 36:32.960]  colonization of Europe with Islamists that is now admitted by the EU chief and
[36:32.960 --> 36:39.320]  by the UN chief over migration Peter Sutherland now before I go any further
[36:39.320 --> 36:43.280]  I keep telling people I have storable foods not because I'm living in fear but
[36:43.280 --> 36:48.240]  I'm trying to live in empowered for nuclear war for depressions for whatever

[37:35.520 --> 37:39.760]  who even makes you know some other big you know top-name brands of bone broth
[37:39.760 --> 37:44.840]  ours chicken because it's the cleanest and I gotta tell you it tastes great really
[37:44.840 --> 37:49.280]  good with milk especially makes great with ice in a blender great chocolate
[37:49.280 --> 37:53.080]  shakes it's got just a little bit of cocoa in it and it fits right with the
[37:53.080 --> 37:57.800]  flavor other flavors don't seem to fit too well we've tried of natural flavor
[37:57.800 --> 38:01.600]  it just doesn't mean the flavoring is natural but just have the flavor of the
[38:01.600 --> 38:04.820]  bone broth and the tumor stuff and it's not good but with a little bit of
[38:04.820 --> 38:08.160]  cocoa a little bit of natural sweetener it's just amazing so caveman is finally
[38:08.160 --> 38:12.520]  back in stock after months of being out 33% off out of the gates it's amazing
[38:12.520 --> 38:17.480]  it's a great meal replacement a great across the board we set up to have the

[38:21.440 --> 38:24.600]  more in hopefully soon but we're running out of the supplies of the deep
[38:24.600 --> 38:28.560]  earth crystals for the first time in four years info warslife.com or triple
[38:28.560 --> 38:32.520]  eight two five three three one three nine a lot of other specials there on the
[38:32.520 --> 38:38.800]  site as well now we're gonna go to Roger Stone I want to be clear to the
[38:38.800 --> 38:43.600]  listeners one of the reasons Trump was so popular was he didn't want war with
[38:43.600 --> 38:46.440]  Russia for no reason he didn't want war in the Middle East he didn't want to
[38:46.440 --> 38:50.440]  topple Assad so that ISIS and al-Qaeda could take over he wanted to knock out
[38:50.440 --> 38:54.560]  al-Qaeda our military is over 10,000 troops now there it's I thought the
[38:54.560 --> 38:59.000]  folks involved it's they have knocked him out 90% they're forcing him into
[38:59.000 --> 39:05.080]  Iraq and a pincer movement they've got him locked in those jaws and now they
[39:05.080 --> 39:09.320]  turned towards Assad now wouldn't al-Qaeda or ISIS launch a chemical attack to
[39:09.320 --> 39:12.640]  blame on Assad when that's the red line and Trump said if they cross that red
[39:12.640 --> 39:17.360]  line he'd attack how does Trump say we know definitively I want to believe him
[39:17.360 --> 39:22.320]  maybe he's being lied to by the generals I don't know I get the Machiavelli move
[39:22.320 --> 39:25.480]  they can stop calling him a Russian agent he looks strong in front of the
[39:25.480 --> 39:28.520]  communist dictator from China who's visiting makes him wait an hour while
[39:28.520 --> 39:33.120]  it's happening that's the stuff of movies so Roger Stone joins us briefly to
[39:33.120 --> 39:37.160]  pop in to give us his analysis and his take on this in the next segment we're
[39:37.160 --> 39:40.120]  gonna get David Knight the crew to pop in but pop in whenever you like David
[39:40.120 --> 39:44.440]  Roger what do you make of this whole situation and then we'll talk some about
[39:44.440 --> 39:51.920]  President Kushner well Alex as you said I think it's exceedingly complex and I
[39:51.920 --> 39:55.840]  think it has to be viewed on several levels first let's look at it just from
[39:55.840 --> 40:02.920]  a political point of view this has one immediate and obvious effect the idea
[40:02.920 --> 40:09.160]  that Donald Trump is soft on the Russians because the because of
[40:09.160 --> 40:15.480]  collusion between his campaign and the Russians is now blown to smithereens if
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.080]  he's soft on the Russians why is he bombing their closest ally and the
[40:21.080 --> 40:25.000]  regime that they are popping up let's be clear a base with Russians on it two
[40:25.000 --> 40:31.840]  hours notice to get off of it exactly so so it has probably that beneficial
[40:31.840 --> 40:36.920]  effect with the electorate I noticed this morning reporters I speak to far less
[40:36.920 --> 40:42.120]  interested in the whole phony question of Russian collusion interesting
[40:42.120 --> 40:47.760]  secondarily I do think that it was important for the president to project
[40:47.760 --> 40:54.440]  power to project strength any probably doing nothing was probably not an
[40:54.440 --> 40:59.120]  option I was about to say just looking at the optics just looking at the optics
[40:59.120 --> 41:02.760]  they would have used this to crucify him so I want to have lower taxes I want to
[41:02.760 --> 41:06.800]  have a controlled border I want to have sovereignty but I get Rand Paul's right
[41:06.800 --> 41:10.480]  about what he's saying but this would have destroyed Trump so it's a very
[41:10.480 --> 41:15.880]  weird place to be well and it will be the right move if it remains limited the
[41:15.880 --> 41:21.320]  real danger as you pointed out is you know now adapting an interventionist
[41:21.320 --> 41:26.560]  neocon foreign policy boots on the ground in a full war in Syria but there's
[41:26.560 --> 41:31.440]  just nothing here that is worse are fighting for I understand the children
[41:31.440 --> 41:35.080]  are being gassed although I understand even General Mattis has raised
[41:35.080 --> 41:40.520]  questions about whether that was you know fraudulent what's interesting to me
[41:40.520 --> 41:45.400]  is that this push by the generals which I believe is aided by the president's
[41:45.400 --> 41:51.680]  son-in-law to you know to essentially shed the non-interventionist position
[41:51.680 --> 41:57.520]  that he stuck to very closely in the campaign and become George W. Bush the
[41:57.520 --> 42:02.560]  people if they wanted to neocon they would have elected Jeb the American
[42:02.560 --> 42:07.120]  people are tired of endless for wars where our national interests are not
[42:07.120 --> 42:13.520]  obvious in the case of Assad he is he is propped up by the Russians he's
[42:13.520 --> 42:18.880]  financing Hamas and Hezbollah and on the other side you have ISIS so the only
[42:18.880 --> 42:26.640]  people cheering today sadly are neocons and jihadis absolutely you have al-Qaeda
[42:26.640 --> 42:31.400]  ISIS al-Nusra tweeting support for Trump doing this you have the weekly standard a
[42:31.400 --> 42:35.200]  bunch of disgraced chicken hawks supporting it and now the liberals are
[42:35.200 --> 42:39.200]  turning almost all of them and the Washington Post like how dare you do
[42:39.200 --> 42:43.480]  this after they say oh you're aiding the dictator Assad then he does this and
[42:43.480 --> 42:46.800]  now they're turning against him and I see everything going on the White House
[42:46.800 --> 42:53.400]  to turn off his base the bad health care bill and then because we exposed
[42:53.400 --> 42:57.280]  yesterday this isn't Trump's health care bill this is John Boehner's health care
[42:57.280 --> 43:02.080]  bill this was drafted by the lobbyist former speaker John Boehner when he
[43:02.080 --> 43:07.320]  put a cigarette down long enough passed to Paul Ryan from Ryan to Ryan's
[43:07.320 --> 43:13.880]  previous from previous to to the president they could have had a much
[43:13.880 --> 43:20.600]  better bill I was really happy to see that the president followed some very
[43:20.600 --> 43:26.100]  sound advice and sat down with senator Rand Paul to start figuring out where
[43:26.100 --> 43:29.960]  they agree and where we can get a more market-oriented health care and Paul
[43:29.960 --> 43:33.160]  said he believes they can get it so that's a big positive move Trump's
[43:33.160 --> 43:35.960]  pushing the tax cuts that's very positive but let's pull back we don't
[43:35.960 --> 43:39.200]  want to attack Kushner I mean I hope the guy's a great guy but he's a Democrat
[43:39.200 --> 43:42.920]  he keeps bringing in these people he's pushing for a lot of things let's talk
[43:42.920 --> 43:47.400]  about the role of president Kushner here because they keep saying bannins the
[43:47.400 --> 43:53.000]  brain but now we know what he reported on gone Monday is now confirmed that
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.080]  indeed he is the the leaker to the media that go after his political enemies
[43:57.080 --> 44:00.980]  that are hardcore conservatives and patriots like Bannon and we see Bannon
[44:00.980 --> 44:04.520]  now more and more being forced out because I guess he didn't support this
[44:04.520 --> 44:08.760]  current military move that we've seen so let's talk about president Kushner yeah
[44:08.760 --> 44:14.720]  I can absolutely certify that Steve Bannon was opposed to this intervention
[44:14.720 --> 44:20.600]  in Syria and he obviously lost an internal argument I also think he is
[44:20.600 --> 44:27.920]  wearing the the manner in which the travel ban was rolled out he's most
[44:27.920 --> 44:34.080]  certainly wearing the health care fiasco where we were forcing Republicans
[44:34.080 --> 44:39.320]  to walk the plank on a bill that wasn't even ours all of those things I think
[44:39.320 --> 44:45.200]  are being utilized by president Kushner to you know to put the heat on Steve
[44:45.200 --> 44:51.360]  Bannon Bannon's a fighter and I do I do think he will survive but what we have
[44:51.360 --> 44:57.360]  to figure out is whether his role is diminished one obvious problem of course
[44:57.360 --> 45:03.560]  is that he really has not spent any capital to bring other nationalists who
[45:03.560 --> 45:07.520]  supported Trump into the light it looks like he's got a jihad going against true
[45:07.520 --> 45:11.720]  populace and patriots I mean I'm sorry he's the one in there rooting everybody
[45:11.720 --> 45:16.280]  out running them out and then trying to get the neocons you know you know back
[45:16.280 --> 45:21.000]  in the tent and meanwhile unfortunately Steve Bannon has not gone to bat for
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.680]  other nationalists and therefore he finds himself on the White House staff
[45:24.680 --> 45:28.920]  largely without allies and you said that day one before he was in he said he's
[45:28.920 --> 45:34.000]  got a battle he's been lulled into a sense of trust you know and I talked to
[45:34.000 --> 45:37.520]  him some early on and I was just like you've got to get more patriots in there
[45:37.520 --> 45:41.800]  but of course people weren't looking to give power back to the people like Trump
[45:41.800 --> 45:44.960]  they were looking for their own power and so Bannon wasn't looking for his own
[45:44.960 --> 45:48.320]  power and so now he's going to lose it so there's that paradox we don't want
[45:48.320 --> 45:52.000]  power but we've got to be willing to get in there and keep them from getting
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.000]  power so that we can give it back to the people my greatest concern in all
[45:56.000 --> 46:01.840]  honesty Alex is that watching the Silicon Valley barons whining and dining
[46:01.840 --> 46:07.920]  Jared and Ivanka the Google people the Facebook people those who are seeking to
[46:07.920 --> 46:14.200]  choke info wars and stone cold truth and bright Bart news and daily caller and
[46:14.200 --> 46:18.480]  all the other right well the very support system of the Republic is under
[46:18.480 --> 46:24.680]  admitted Democratic Party George Soros David Brock admitted they say they want
[46:24.680 --> 46:28.240]  to shut down admitted they want to in free speech admitted they're trying to
[46:28.240 --> 46:33.160]  please China by showing them they can censor here outrageous and Trump is on
[46:33.160 --> 46:37.280]  autopilot while Obama's stay behind network Ministry of Truth at the State
[46:37.280 --> 46:41.280]  Department openly testifies in Congress that we're Russian agents and that we
[46:41.280 --> 46:46.840]  should be shut up I mean this is exactly and remember day one when Obama signed
[46:46.840 --> 46:50.040]  that bill I said this is gonna be our biggest vain Roger I mean I'm not
[46:50.040 --> 46:53.480]  bragging but did I not tell you we've got to tell Trump we've got a hammer him
[46:53.480 --> 46:57.160]  on this I remember that day you told me well this is the National Censorship
[46:57.160 --> 47:01.400]  Board here it is and that's exactly what has transpired my point of course is if
[47:01.400 --> 47:05.320]  there's anyone on the face of the planet who should understand this it would be
[47:05.320 --> 47:10.400]  Steve Bannon because he comes out of right Bart news I don't think that
[47:10.400 --> 47:17.040]  Jared understands that if these censorship initiatives go forward the
[47:17.040 --> 47:22.640]  chances of the president's reelection are zero zero we are going to restore the
[47:22.640 --> 47:26.920]  mainstream media monopoly on the dissemination of political information
[47:26.920 --> 47:32.600]  Trump could not have one without a free and vibrant net Trump could not have
[47:32.600 --> 47:36.240]  one without info wars dot com Trump could not have one without bright Bart
[47:36.240 --> 47:39.960]  daily caller and the enemy knows that the enemy knows that there's they've written
[47:39.960 --> 47:43.680]  thousands and thousands of articles admitting and then you get leaks where
[47:43.680 --> 47:48.880]  they're saying oh we got Roger Stone banned off TV oh we cut out the MVP
[47:48.880 --> 47:53.240]  Soros give us more money I mean they are literally trying to destroy us and
[47:53.240 --> 47:57.960]  Trump's on autopilot let's just say it toad haul is filled with a bunch of
[47:57.960 --> 48:02.080]  weasels and stoats and it's time to retake it man it's he needs to
[48:02.080 --> 48:08.640]  understand he is surrounded by weak foppish left-wing New York socialites
[48:08.640 --> 48:14.000]  but meanwhile we see you know Jared dining with the head of Google at one
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.240]  of the tony's restaurants in Manhattan this is more disturbing to me than
[48:19.240 --> 48:23.440]  anything else because the future of the Trump administration and his efforts to
[48:23.440 --> 48:28.520]  make America great again a completely pivot off access to the net and the
[48:28.520 --> 48:32.400]  ability to rally the same people who elected him if we can't reach those
[48:32.400 --> 48:38.800]  people we cannot rally them this is the greatest single danger I see moving
[48:38.800 --> 48:43.800]  forward but there's no evidence that Jared Kushner understands what is going
[48:43.800 --> 48:49.200]  on here it's unbelievable and you know here we are trying to stop wars here we
[48:49.200 --> 48:52.800]  are trying to get taxes cut and we have the vicious piranha like brainwashed
[48:52.800 --> 48:56.400]  left people that are susceptible to the brainwashing not realizing where their
[48:56.400 --> 49:00.960]  best friends and that weirdo foreign Nazi collaborators are financing the end
[49:00.960 --> 49:05.880]  of free speech who overthrew the Middle East who overthrew Ukraine I mean they
[49:05.880 --> 49:09.320]  mean business people ask why they never give up and why they're so wicked and
[49:09.320 --> 49:12.760]  because they just keep winning and finally they run into us and we're
[49:12.760 --> 49:17.680]  holding them back only to see as usual Trump infiltrated by his very family
[49:17.680 --> 49:21.760]  you know do you think Kushner is just delusional or does he realize what he's
[49:21.760 --> 49:26.880]  doing cuz they're gonna destroy him too well I don't think that ironically I
[49:26.880 --> 49:31.000]  don't think his motives are bad I just think his political judgment is not
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.240]  sound he would like his father-in-law to be successful he would like his father
[49:34.240 --> 49:39.240]  and want to be popular he would like his father-in-law to be well received in
[49:39.240 --> 49:44.000]  the you know the salons of the upper west side of New York that is never
[49:44.000 --> 49:49.840]  going to happen his father was elected as a revolutionary as a reformer as an
[49:49.840 --> 49:54.480]  outsider can't Jared see the global tide is inexorable and cannot be stopped
[49:54.480 --> 49:58.720]  even if they capture our leaders more like shark teeth will roll forward do
[49:58.720 --> 50:02.360]  you think he dines with anybody who isn't a millionaire you think he dines
[50:02.360 --> 50:05.600]  with anybody who isn't a globalist you know Roger when you're talking about
[50:05.600 --> 50:10.240]  besides the folks that go at Goldman Sachs yes get this one more break I can't
[50:10.240 --> 50:13.720]  help it do it you're talking Roger about who he dines with talking about him
[50:13.720 --> 50:17.320]  dining with Silicon Valley and so forth Lee Strand Hannah Breitbart talked about
[50:17.320 --> 50:24.280]  how he met with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfell at the NDC for dinner and
[50:24.280 --> 50:28.800]  shortly after that we saw this massive changes they're talking about in other
[50:28.800 --> 50:32.360]  publications this game of thrones that we see happening at the White House and
[50:32.360 --> 50:37.360]  it's not just this particular action that we saw Donald Trump turn around in
[50:37.360 --> 50:41.600]  just 48 hours but of course it's also the Obamacare issue it's also even
[50:41.600 --> 50:45.920]  climate change we didn't even talk about that how they pushed as Donald Trump was
[50:45.920 --> 50:50.080]  putting in the executive orders to shut down the EPA overreach to shut down
[50:50.080 --> 50:55.440]  entire industries it was Jared Kushner and Ivanka who were pushing back to say
[50:55.440 --> 50:59.760]  don't mention the Paris climate treaty exactly it's them it's them it's his
[50:59.760 --> 51:03.800]  daughter and his son-in-law they are literally the enemies of the Republic I
[51:03.800 --> 51:08.440]  just can't help it I'm sorry I'll lay it all out they they are
[51:08.440 --> 51:12.560]  elitists by the way I think Lee Strand Hannah is one of the very best
[51:12.560 --> 51:17.040]  reporters in the country today and does excellent work there at Breitbart I
[51:17.040 --> 51:22.000]  follow his byline very carefully and I'm certain to read everything he writes
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.480]  but I think Alex has put his hands on it that first of all this is in a way has
[51:26.480 --> 51:30.520]  to do with political correctness and social they want to be accepted they
[51:30.520 --> 51:33.400]  don't want to be yelled at and I think I think Ivanka's amazing I think
[51:33.400 --> 51:37.160]  Kushner's really smart and I like that you know the Suns Donald Jr. and
[51:37.160 --> 51:40.560]  everybody they're great hell they can follow us on Twitter and tweet our stuff
[51:40.560 --> 51:44.200]  the point is I don't want to be patted on the head I want the Republic back I
[51:44.200 --> 51:49.560]  want to restore the Republic for those who say well he's the president's son
[51:49.560 --> 51:54.680]  in law and therefore you know there's no way that he will lose power I would
[51:54.680 --> 51:59.720]  remind you that Donald Trump is a man who fired his own brother watch the poll
[51:59.720 --> 52:06.360]  numbers because if we dive headlong into globalism Donald Trump may be at a 40
[52:06.360 --> 52:11.760]  roughly percent approval rating today it'll hit 20 that's not why we elected
[52:11.760 --> 52:17.280]  him and let me add this point face with our voters now I'm not you know
[52:17.280 --> 52:23.160]  hysterical today and I'm not and I'm not you know really completely distraught
[52:23.160 --> 52:27.400]  because the end of the day I have faith in Donald Trump to figure this out and
[52:27.400 --> 52:32.960]  write the ship I'm convinced that when he hears the arguments of what about what
[52:32.960 --> 52:38.560]  Google is doing what Facebook is doing what what these other Stalinist type
[52:38.560 --> 52:45.080]  censors are doing on the net he will get it instantly but what we don't know is
[52:45.080 --> 52:49.840]  whether Steve Bannon has you know made this clear to him what is a full everybody
[52:49.840 --> 52:53.200]  through Twitter everywhere else the word thing is you know talking to Trump he
[52:53.200 --> 52:55.840]  does a lot of the talking and then people are busy and rents previous is on the
[52:55.840 --> 52:58.840]  line or whatever I don't want to get into it they literally following around
[52:58.840 --> 53:02.520]  like hounds trying to keep him away from people but the public has to get the
[53:02.520 --> 53:06.760]  message that they're set up a censorship board they're undercutting him and I
[53:06.760 --> 53:10.000]  think and again when I say enemies of the Republic I don't mean conscious
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.520]  enemies but they literally are working against the restoration of this this
[53:14.520 --> 53:18.760]  huge engine of success Trump will be like George Washington 2.0 if he
[53:18.760 --> 53:23.480]  succeeds if he doesn't it'll be sad and we just look at the delusional elite and
[53:23.480 --> 53:26.480]  all that they're pushing stay there Roger I've got about like five more minutes
[53:26.480 --> 53:29.960]  left to you but I want to get Kit Daniels to pop in he's got a positive
[53:29.960 --> 53:34.360]  view on this and also we've got Matt in there who's a smart producer he's got
[53:34.360 --> 53:39.680]  some points that are so go ahead guys both of you jump in briefly yes Alex the
[53:39.680 --> 53:44.280]  article of the subpoena article reads strikes could trigger reconciliation
[53:44.280 --> 53:48.320]  coalition with Russia to stop ISIS and that's true because when it comes to the
[53:48.320 --> 53:53.640]  strikes you know Trump just hit like an airbase he even touched the runway he
[53:53.640 --> 53:59.040]  did minimal damage to this airbase and going back to what I just said marriage
[53:59.040 --> 54:02.680]  counselors will tell you that the greatest bond between couples is forged
[54:02.680 --> 54:08.480]  in the reconciliation phase so now Trump and Russia now have this little standoff
[54:08.480 --> 54:13.080]  going off with the ships and Mediterranean yet he struck an airbase
[54:13.080 --> 54:18.760]  with minimal damage is basically a slap on the wrist to us Assad and now he had
[54:18.760 --> 54:23.680]  he's in the position where he can use diplomacy to de-escalate the situation
[54:23.680 --> 54:28.600]  with Russia now if he didn't strike the airbase before and he tried to talk to
[54:28.600 --> 54:33.560]  Russia beforehand about forging a coalition to stop ISIS then you know his
[54:33.560 --> 54:37.120]  whole administration you know the Democrats in Congress even though Neil
[54:37.120 --> 54:41.280]  Johnson Congress would have went out and said that Trump is Putin's puppet I
[54:41.280 --> 54:44.760]  agree I believe and I said this yesterday before it was admitted that there were
[54:44.760 --> 54:48.000]  back channels that they are meeting with them that that Madison others are
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.480]  talking but they told the Russians let us do this this will shut up that that
[54:51.480 --> 54:54.960]  we're all Russian agents then we can have another deal to fully remove ISIS and
[54:54.960 --> 54:58.960]  then decide what we're gonna do with Syria together but we're gonna hit this
[54:58.960 --> 55:03.000]  because the optics are too bad you can save a rattle all you want but then this
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.680]  will be a gambit to reopen daytime and and I believe that's actually what's
[55:07.680 --> 55:11.040]  happened but the neocons are all celebrating because they believe now
[55:11.040 --> 55:14.160]  they can just stage more false flags I believe they're directly behind it I
[55:14.160 --> 55:16.400]  think McCain one over there and set the supplement to go they've done it before
[55:16.400 --> 55:20.760]  and so and so they're now thinking they can bully the president into
[55:20.760 --> 55:24.080]  submission and aren't even sophisticated enough to know what the president's done
[55:24.080 --> 55:27.520]  by the way I know that's what's been done I mean I just can see it I saw it
[55:27.520 --> 55:33.360]  before it happened Roger well he is you know he's clever like a fox I do agree
[55:33.360 --> 55:38.880]  you Alex that that John McCain maybe he thinks he was elected president I don't
[55:38.880 --> 55:44.720]  know but he clearly was there at a suspicious time and he and his many me
[55:44.720 --> 55:50.280]  Lindsey Graham are just itching for war they're desperate for war it's really
[55:50.280 --> 55:54.440]  it's a very sad you would think John McCain is a man who has seen war would
[55:54.440 --> 55:59.720]  want to do everything necessary to avoid war we're gonna know very soon because
[55:59.720 --> 56:05.720]  if this becomes a full-fledged invasion of Syria boots on the ground and massive
[56:05.720 --> 56:10.560]  you know civilian bombings then then we have lost then then we have lost the
[56:10.560 --> 56:14.640]  purposes of electing Donald Trump well Roger here's the bad news they
[56:14.640 --> 56:18.400]  admittedly are putting in whole I'm not gonna even say the numbers but I've got
[56:18.400 --> 56:21.000]  this from a lot of good sources and I looked at the news they made it larger
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  tens of thousands of troops as we speak are being dumped into Syria from the US
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.800]  military and that's the problem because we see all this stuff about us right and
[56:28.800 --> 56:33.240]  we have to assume that right now the generals and probably Jared Kushner are
[56:33.240 --> 56:36.760]  pushing the president in that direction that's why I think it's vitally important
[56:36.760 --> 56:40.840]  that supporters remind the president why they voted for him that's right David
[56:40.840 --> 56:44.920]  before we did not vote for him so we could have a neocon interventionist
[56:44.920 --> 56:50.440]  foreign policy and we have no vital interests on the ground in Syria of
[56:50.440 --> 56:55.160]  course we hate the gassing of children I agree with that I don't want to say
[56:55.160 --> 56:59.080]  something here Roger you know I don't want to get into the cheerleading of
[56:59.080 --> 57:02.920]  surgical strikes every time we do something that is aggressive that we do
[57:02.920 --> 57:07.400]  and take an action without having this debated in Congress and that's one of
[57:07.400 --> 57:10.880]  the reasons why we have Congress declare war because it takes a process to
[57:10.880 --> 57:14.480]  debate this we did not look at the forensic evidence there's indications
[57:14.480 --> 57:18.000]  that this is a false flag that this it was tweeted out it was published as a
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.120]  Russian judgment yes instant exactly let's have a forensic investigation when
[57:22.120 --> 57:24.800]  we did that four years ago we found it wasn't true so we see all these articles
[57:24.800 --> 57:28.520]  from Daily Mail this is an awesome article arsenal this is pinpoint accuracy
[57:28.520 --> 57:31.720]  we have Brian Williams saying this is beautiful missiles you know what if they
[57:31.720 --> 57:35.680]  were storing gas there at that place then where's the pictures of the people
[57:35.680 --> 57:40.400]  dying when they hit the storehouse of the gas there at the airport with the
[57:40.400 --> 57:44.480]  missiles you know that's no it was the empty the Russians are involved this was
[57:44.480 --> 57:47.440]  all done this was all done behind the scene and back channels and I hate to
[57:47.440 --> 57:50.320]  even say that but listen the mainstream media won't even pick up on that because
[57:50.320 --> 57:54.320]  they're just such repeaters they're so dumb they don't even know what they're
[57:54.320 --> 57:57.440]  witnessing and guaranteed that's it I'm just saying I don't even know if I like
[57:57.440 --> 58:01.760]  this because it's so Machiavelli we're gonna let Roger go or come back briefly
[58:01.760 --> 58:05.280]  with kit and also Matt jump in here and the David Knights gonna take over I've
[58:05.280 --> 58:07.960]  got a special report coming up the bottom of the hour and we've got so many

[59:49.880 --> 1:00:00.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:17.040]  the world is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those
[1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:23.680]  who look on and do nothing. If you are receiving this transmission you are the
[1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:29.040]  resistance. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's
[1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:33.280]  Alex Jones. Yeah we're starting to retake the Republic a little bit here and
[1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:36.120]  there but there's a lot more of the fight ahead as you can see is all the
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:40.800]  forces struggle to derail our agenda. Joel Scousen's popping in with his
[1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:45.680]  view. Dr. Steve Pacenek is also coming up to run course team. Paul Watson hosts the
[1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:48.920]  fourth hour. David Knight's gonna take over until I'm back at the bottom of the
[1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:52.320]  hour. It's just a big broadcast obviously today. It's an info war. Spread these
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:55.960]  links. I know David's chomping on the bit here. We'll always guess we've had on.
[1:00:55.960 --> 1:01:00.800]  Kit, I agree with your bullet points from the perspective of Trump and I think
[1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:03.920]  that's what Trump means. In fact I know it's what he means so I get what's
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:07.040]  happening there and I concur with your article to a great extent. I'm just
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:10.840]  saying there's more levels to this. Other points that I want to get Matt Weber in
[1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:15.660]  here. Absolutely Alex. My concern is that the criticism lobbied against Trump
[1:01:15.660 --> 1:01:19.880]  a lot of it is valid but some people are making this assumption that Trump is
[1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:24.720]  stupid. Trump is way smarter than he lets on. He is way smarter than most people
[1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:33.480]  realize and going back to this article is the fact that you know with Russia you
[1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:37.920]  know it's like you said the taunt and there's two tells about this thing
[1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:42.800]  about this. One, when you played the video with Trump given his press
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:47.480]  conference he just read it off the script. He had no authenticity about a
[1:01:47.480 --> 1:01:50.440]  statement. He was rating straight off the teleprompter. I have never seen Trump
[1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:56.000]  do that. So to me I'm convinced that Trump doesn't believe that this was a real
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:59.040]  attack. I think there's a doubt in his mind that this was definitely a false
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:02.160]  blood attack. Absolutely. They know the other attacks were. Alright thank you.
[1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:06.560]  That's a great point. Your article is on infowars.com. Kit Daniels breaks down
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:10.040]  kind of the pro side of this. I overall think we're going on the wrong road
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:13.720]  really really fast. But right now let's go to Matt Webber. Matt you've got some
[1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:18.200]  points on this as well. Go ahead. Yeah to elaborate on what David Knighthead
[1:02:18.200 --> 1:02:25.400]  said earlier he was critical of tactical or surgical strikes and I do know
[1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:30.760]  that the the purpose of that strike was to inhibit their capabilities of carrying
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:35.240]  out sarin gas tax but there's an article up where Putin was warning about
[1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:40.760]  negative consequences and I think one of those could be that it makes Syria more
[1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:44.960]  dependent on foreign powers for defense aid now. You know that's something
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:49.800]  that we'll have to take on as a burden. We'll have to support Syria if we want
[1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:54.200]  to remain that them to remain an ally. And let's think about if we don't
[1:02:54.200 --> 1:02:59.320]  actually get Assad out. Rex Tillerson has been very obscure in his statements. He
[1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:04.120]  said you know we're taking steps towards getting Assad out of office but he's also
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:09.680]  said that you know a strike doesn't necessarily mean a policy shift for Syria.
[1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:15.160]  So let's say Assad remains in power. Is this going to drive him into the arms of
[1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:21.400]  other nations? You know is he going to align himself with other people? We have to stop
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:24.800]  being the police for the world at some point and understand this. It's Hillary
[1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:30.840]  and Obama and the globalists that started the whole war that began this
[1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:36.000]  civil war and so I could see Trump cleaning out al-Qaeda and ISIS out of
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:40.440]  Iraq and Syria but then going in and then removing Assad that's a whole
[1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:45.040]  another thing and then we truly own Syria. We'll get Joel Scouse's take on that.
[1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:51.280]  Do you have a comeback? Yeah yeah to that end yes this is you know steeped in
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:57.920]  legality right? Was this legal for Trump to do? There are people like who's this
[1:03:57.920 --> 1:04:02.480]  guy Christophe Nicholas Christophe? He's a New York Times reporter and you know
[1:04:02.480 --> 1:04:06.880]  Chris Cuomo was asking him this morning you know aside from the legality can you
[1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:11.400]  come up with a compelling argument for this action and he said yeah you know
[1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:15.320]  sometimes it's good to show that you're a decisive leader but you know what I
[1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:22.800]  what I'm thinking here is you know can I say that I'm just getting the guys on
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:26.000]  air because they're always nervous to get on there and I mean behind the
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:30.560]  scenes are well-spoken I was getting used to being on air go ahead go ahead yeah
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:33.280]  I just want to say it's easy to shoot cruise missiles from the hip but we have
[1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:36.880]  to understand we don't want to root ISIS in Syria and we don't want to root ISIS
[1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:40.640]  in the West in the US and Western Europe and that's my concern about all
[1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:44.520]  but we're taking it down. Let Matt come back and have a final comment here's my deal
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:47.760]  that writer he's talking about had the stage deal with Hillary where she said
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:51.160]  hit his airfield so she'd sound real smart two hours later when it happened
[1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:55.080]  they already all knew that's right so so all I'm getting at here is the bad
[1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:58.840]  actors are all for this I know why Trump did it.
[1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:04.440]  Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Mike Flynn, Steve Bannon and now Devin Nunes.
[1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:09.000]  It seems the left's intimidation tactics are actually working. Nunes is the latest
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  to be asked to step aside after an intense few weeks of grilling from the
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:15.600]  left as the House Intelligence Chairman has now recused himself from the Russian
[1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:19.520]  probe. Isn't that too convenient for the Democrats to have the only one involved
[1:05:19.520 --> 1:05:22.480]  in this Russian probe who actually seems to care about the truth of the matter
[1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:25.760]  step aside and recuse himself. Just to rub our noses in it
[1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:29.000]  Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat member of the House Intelligence
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:32.680]  Committee, made a public statement moments after Nunes' announcement saying
[1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:37.160]  how pleased he was to hear of Nunes' recusal. So now the Democrats have a
[1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:40.680]  monopoly on the political witch hunt that is the Russian probe. Thanks Nunes.
[1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:44.080]  The Republicans have gotten their leverage democratically and refuse to
[1:05:44.080 --> 1:05:47.600]  use it. The Democrats get their leverage with smear campaigns and use it
[1:05:47.600 --> 1:05:51.520]  successfully and if we keep allowing them to do it they're going to continue.
[1:05:51.520 --> 1:05:58.920]  President Trump, the swamp is draining us. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[1:05:58.920 --> 1:06:04.000]  This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on

[1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:03.360]  The reason InfoWars Live has five star ratings on major third-party sites is
[1:07:03.360 --> 1:07:07.240]  because I want products I'm gonna use for my family. I take this, my family takes
[1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:10.440]  this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore truthful
[1:07:10.440 --> 1:07:13.880]  information you're gonna find anywhere. So what you find in our news is the same
[1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:17.760]  thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com. If I ever forget to take
[1:07:17.760 --> 1:07:22.380]  them, like I'll I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The
[1:07:22.380 --> 1:07:26.200]  nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me. Yeah, I've
[1:07:26.200 --> 1:07:30.840]  actually have just run out of my super female. I had a few bottles at my house
[1:07:30.840 --> 1:07:35.920]  and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling
[1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:41.800]  great, looking good, and I know my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously the
[1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:46.960]  super female is amazing. I love it. Nascent iodine is essential. Survival
[1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:50.160]  Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life-changing, that I would
[1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:55.120]  suggest it's nascent iodine, Survival Shield X2. It's got a five star rating.
[1:07:55.120 --> 1:07:59.600]  It's a win-win in FullWarsLive.com.
[1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:19.480]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:34.280]  Here we are Friday, the 7th day of April 2017. Gorsuch was just approved to the
[1:08:34.280 --> 1:08:38.960]  Supreme Court. I guess they used the nuclear option to get that done, only
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:43.160]  needing 51 votes. We'll have details of that before we put the article on screen
[1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:46.480]  for any TV viewers that are out there watching us. If you're a radio
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:52.800]  listener, you can always tune in via infowars.com forward slash show. There it
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:57.280]  is. Neil Gorsuch is confirmed by Senate as Supreme Court Justice, and we'll
[1:08:57.280 --> 1:09:03.160]  scroll down and read some of that article for again the TV viewers. Judge
[1:09:03.160 --> 1:09:07.160]  Neil M. Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate on Friday to become the 113th
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:11.720]  Justice of the Supreme Court, capping a political brawl that lasted for more than
[1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:16.040]  a year and tested constitutional norms inside the Capitol, fraying upper
[1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:24.320]  chamber. The development was a signal. Triumph for President Trump, or single
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:28.080]  triumph campaign last year, rested in large part on his pledge to appoint
[1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:32.360]  another committed conservative to succeed, Justice Anthony Scalia, who died in
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:37.000]  February 2016. Very suspiciously, I should add. Let me just stop right there,
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.600]  because I want to go to our next guest, and I'm going to punch out for a while,
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:42.960]  work on some things and come back, David. I'll leave everybody here with able
[1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:48.160]  hands. I'll be back this Sunday, of course, 4 to 6 p.m. live. But it's not
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:50.800]  Hillary picking the Supreme Court, and I know folks that were involved with
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:54.560]  Trump, he had a computer with the most conservative votes and had a bunch of
[1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:57.880]  big firms look at it, three different firms. And he wanted to put into
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:00.680]  Poletano later, but said, well, I guess you're not on the list. Let's be the
[1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:05.080]  second round. That's a big news for folks, but I'll just tell you. So bigger
[1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:09.440]  economy, control the border, a lot of good stuff happening, but neocons and
[1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:13.120]  al-Qaeda celebrating what happened in Syria, a clear false flag. Joe Scalzen
[1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:17.680]  was on with us the day it happened. We had reporters on the ground. Absolutely
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:22.320]  a false flag. Ron Paul, 100% false flag. He's never that sure. Rand Paul, I
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:26.560]  mean, the same group's been caught staging it. Why would Assad, right as
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:30.120]  he's winning, right as the U.S. is defeating al-Qaeda in ISIS, pushing
[1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:35.200]  him into Iraq in a pencil attack from the east and the west? Why would he do
[1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:39.360]  the one thing that's the red line for Trump? Trump knows that. So it makes him
[1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:42.640]  look good with the Chinese president. Now he doesn't look like he's allied with
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:47.120]  Russia. Maybe it opens up the taunt of very Machiavelli move. I understand
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:51.800]  Machiavellian systems, but I just, they always turn to evil like the Ring of
[1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:55.760]  Mordor to use a parable from Lord of the Rings. It'll give you the power to
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:11:00.760]  win, but only a couple moves. Then it brings in the curse. It's like Nazi
[1:11:00.760 --> 1:11:05.000]  Germany or anything else. So Joe Scalzen, former Marine Corps fighter pilot
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:10.120]  naval aviator, a military officer in the Marine Corps, and of course one of the
[1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:14.120]  leading Patriot families for almost 70 years fighting the globalist. And so he's
[1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:17.360]  got all the sources. We'll get his take. And David, you take over. I know David
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:21.640]  is chomping at the bid here. So Joe Scalzen, good to have you here. Good to be
[1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:24.680]  with you, Alex and David. Well, you've heard my ranting. You've heard my
[1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:29.320]  analysis and David's perhaps. What's your take on the current situation? Well, I'm
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:33.760]  frankly going to have to disagree with the proposition that Trump hasn't bought
[1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:39.280]  into this. I think he's been totally snookered by this false flag incident. And
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:43.760]  I have read every statement. I don't care whether he's on the teleprompter or
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:49.360]  speaking off the cuff. I can see, you know, complete buying into this on his
[1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:54.080]  part. And this is a very sad story because it means, I mean, when his meeting
[1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:59.400]  with at Mar-a-Lago with the Bannon, that Bannon was totally for the strike on
[1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:03.960]  Syria. You just cannot explain this by Machiavelli and techniques saying, I'm
[1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:10.800]  going to go out and destroy people just so that I can, you know, advance. I'm just
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:15.120]  very frustrated by the fact that Donald Trump. I'm not endorsing Machiavelli. I
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:19.520]  see how this actually works for him. And so I don't think the neocons and stuff
[1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:22.600]  realized was just what's happened. But you're saying he believes his general so
[1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:25.880]  much. You may be right. He has a love affair with the military that they may
[1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:30.120]  have given him fake intelligence. Absolutely. They assured him and the
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:33.720]  masters assured him. Absolutely. This was the Syrians who did it. And you know
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:37.520]  what? What they failed to see and which has come out from the Russians, which is
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:42.520]  very, very good intelligence, is that the Syrians had stockpiled chemical
[1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:47.960]  weapons in this arms factory. And it was a secondary explosion from the attack
[1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:51.000]  from the Syrians on the arm factory. The Syrians didn't know that there were
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:55.400]  chemical weapons there, but it wasn't technically a false flag attack, meaning
[1:12:55.400 --> 1:12:59.920]  the Syrians didn't explode. The rebels didn't explode the weapons trying to
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:04.760]  blame it. It just simply got caught up in the attack on their arms factory. So
[1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:09.000]  this surprised the globalists. This is something they had to move a crisis and
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:13.080]  take advantage of it right off the cuff, because this was not a planned false
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:18.080]  flag attack. It turns out to be a false attribution to Assad. And I covered in
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:23.160]  this in today's World Affairs Brief all the history of the false accusations of
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:28.920]  Assad using chemical weapons, how chemical weapons are a broad-based area
[1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:33.560]  weapon that are never used, never in military tactics used in a close urban
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:38.720]  conflict situation, with civilians, because it's nondiscriminatory. There's
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:42.840]  no way, with Assad knowing that the establishment is looking for a way to
[1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:46.600]  kill him, to blame him that he would use chemical weapons where there's no
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:50.920]  military advantage to do so. I just can't believe that none of the military
[1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:56.280]  experts on television have brought this up. It's just a cover-up of massive
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:14:02.480]  proportions. But I'm frankly worried that once Trump gets on this bandwagon, say
[1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:06.520]  I'm going to attack, he goes through with it. And so I'm thinking that with his
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:09.880]  threats against North Korea, and China is not going to reign in North Korea, but
[1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:15.120]  with those threats, Trump could take place or could take action against
[1:14:15.120 --> 1:14:19.480]  North Korea very soon, and it could have World War III consequences. I'm very,
[1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:23.440]  very concerned. You know, Joel, this is David Knight. Alex Jones has gone now.
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:27.200]  We'll finish up this interview together. When you said that you were
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:30.640]  concerned that Donald Trump had bought into this, I am too, because what we've
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:34.200]  seen is a pattern of Donald Trump going out and getting the people that he
[1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:37.240]  believes are experts in all these different fields, and then stepping back
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:41.120]  and saying, I'm going to approach this from a pragmatic standpoint. I'm not
[1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:45.240]  ideological about this, and let them take the lead on this. And of course,
[1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:48.960]  Michael Savage has said, look, these are the generals now that are leading us
[1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:53.920]  into this escalated conflict, this escalated conflict and regime change in
[1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:57.840]  Syria, escalation of the Cold War with Russia. He said we saw the same thing
[1:14:57.840 --> 1:15:02.440]  with Woodrow Wilson, and pushing this type of agenda, somebody who came in
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:05.400]  saying, I'm going to put America first and whatever we're going to, and then
[1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:09.120]  turn into a globalist. That's what I'm really concerned about. But you said one
[1:15:09.120 --> 1:15:13.200]  thing that I thought was interesting in terms of the way the attack came out.
[1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:17.280]  We talked to Syria girl yesterday, and she was saying that a day prior to the
[1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:22.560]  attack, Gulf-based Orient TV announced, quote, tomorrow, we are
[1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:25.760]  launching a media campaign to cover the airstrikes on Hama countryside,
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:28.880]  including the usage of chemical warfare against civilians. I mean, they're
[1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:32.160]  tipping this out a day ahead of time. We see that there's not going to be any
[1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:35.320]  forensic investigation. There's not going to be any debate in Congress. Instead,
[1:15:35.320 --> 1:15:39.080]  they move immediately with a solution that they have pre-planned. This is what
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:43.240]  looks like so much like a false flag. I have people pushing back when I talk
[1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:45.560]  about this on Twitter saying, you see everything is a false flag. It's like,
[1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:49.400]  well, when they talk about it in advance and say tomorrow this is going to happen,
[1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:52.760]  and they've already got a pre-planned solution, they've already identified the
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:57.280]  culprit. When you can't identify somebody that quickly, that's the thing that
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:01.400]  concerns me. It's got these types of deliberate fingerprints all over it.
[1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:06.640]  Well, I published that to report from Info Wars in today's World Affairs
[1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:12.920]  Brief that they had foreknowledge of it. But the only solution, you know, as a
[1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:17.680]  military analyst on that, it would be to say that they have to wait because they
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:20.920]  had video of seeing the aircraft, the Syrian aircraft come in dropping their
[1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:25.560]  bombs, and then the chemical weapons exploding. You know, either they had to
[1:16:25.560 --> 1:16:31.680]  time it where they set these off manually in concert with the coming attack,
[1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:35.240]  which perhaps they knew about. Perhaps they were inducing this attack and
[1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:40.720]  planned to blow this up. But that's a tricky thing to do from a military
[1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:46.760]  standpoint. I think it's much more plausible to believe that that foreknowledge
[1:16:46.760 --> 1:16:50.600]  referred to the fact we know they're going to attack our arms factory, and in
[1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:53.800]  the process those chemical weapons are going to blow up, and it's going to
[1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:58.680]  cause a massive amount of deaths, and that's what I really think. I agree. Now in
[1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:02.360]  terms of justification, we saw Donald Trump and Nikki Haley talking about
[1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:07.000]  babies and so forth, and we've seen this all with the first Gulf War, and that was
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.800]  false, the fact that we were told babies were being taken out of incubators
[1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:14.760]  by an evil dictator, and we found out that that was entirely rigged. We talk
[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:19.120]  about, Donald Trump said, the slow agonizing death, well you know we had
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:23.620]  a half a million children die of slow agonizing deaths, and that was our
[1:17:23.620 --> 1:17:29.920]  sanctions against Iraq. We also have the example that we had in
[1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:34.640]  Stockholm today of what is going to really be the consequences of this in
[1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:39.200]  the long term. You want to speak to that and talk about also what you think is
[1:17:39.200 --> 1:17:43.880]  going to have, what effect this is going to have on our relationship with Russia.
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:48.480]  Well let's talk about the Russia thing too. Now Trump of course, as you know,
[1:17:48.480 --> 1:17:54.720]  did warn the Russians in advance. This was to avoid too many casualties or any
[1:17:54.720 --> 1:17:59.240]  casualties all along among the Russian advisors, so he didn't want to have an
[1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:03.280]  escalation of this conflict. What that indicates, and it also ended up meeting
[1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:08.640]  very few Syrian casualties, although there were some involved in this, but what
[1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:15.360]  it means is that Trump wanted to make a statement rather than start a war. And of
[1:18:15.360 --> 1:18:20.080]  course the Russian reaction with this is to cut off any coordination on air
[1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:27.280]  support for this war in Syria. They're also bringing in more anti-aircraft
[1:18:27.280 --> 1:18:31.880]  systems. You know, I wondered first of all why didn't Russia respond knowing in
[1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:37.040]  advance, why didn't they shoot down any of these Tomahawk missiles? I mean,
[1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:42.480]  through 59 of them at this air base, that I knew from a military pilot, that's
[1:18:42.480 --> 1:18:46.080]  really overkill. These things are over a million dollars apiece. Yeah, one and a
[1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:49.600]  half million dollars. That's about 90 million dollars that he spent there. I
[1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:52.880]  guess we should all go out and get some stock in Raytheon right now. They're
[1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:56.640]  going to go shooting up. They'll be replacing these. Well here's my take on
[1:18:56.640 --> 1:19:00.440]  this. They are, those Tomahawk missiles aren't being produced anymore, and I think
[1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:05.400]  they do have accuracy problems. So I think in one aspect, there's two aspects, but
[1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:09.240]  one is that they wanted to use up existing inventory, so they threw nearly
[1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:16.360]  60 of these things out. Secondly, they knew that Russia's S-400 system has very
[1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:23.520]  expensive interceptors. They don't have 60 reloads for those S-400 systems, and so
[1:19:23.520 --> 1:19:27.640]  they wanted to send a barrage in there so that Russia would say, hey, we can't
[1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:31.440]  possibly stop this attack. We're going to let it fall. Interestingly, Russia has
[1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:36.400]  documented that most of those cruise missiles missed their target. They only
[1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:41.960]  end up destroying three big 23 jets, and those were under repair, so
[1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:46.680]  essentially it was a net negative. They didn't even crater the runway. That's what
[1:19:46.680 --> 1:19:50.000]  happens when you do wag the dog. We're talking to Joel Scousen, and then we're
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:58.840]  going to be right back with a quick break. Be right back.

[1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:16.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. We're talking to Dr.
[1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:20.240]  Joel Scowson. We're going to have Dr. Jerome Corsi coming up later. We're
[1:24:20.240 --> 1:24:24.000]  going to also have Steve Pacinac. Alex Jones has more comments. We're going to
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:29.040]  be playing in the next section. But Joel, I want to get your comments. What do you
[1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:33.480]  want the audience to take away from this in terms of what's going on the area?
[1:24:33.480 --> 1:24:37.080]  Because you're looking at this from a military standpoint, from the strategies
[1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:41.200]  there. As you pointed out, they wanted to get rid of these stockpiles of cruise
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:45.560]  missiles. These are all there. You said as they sent 60. That was massive
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:49.440]  overkill. There were questions about its accuracy because it's an old weapon
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:52.560]  system. But of course, the military industrial complex always wants to
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:56.040]  re-up and get the next generation. This gives them more impetus to sell the
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:24:59.600]  next generation to everybody. But give us your perspective on what's going on
[1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:03.240]  with the military industrial complex, the influence of the generals, what this is
[1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:08.520]  going to mean for the geopolitical situation with Russia. I think this
[1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:14.320]  entire attack can be late at the feet of National Security Advisor H.R.
[1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:19.960]  McMaster's. I think he is in charge now and has the year of Donald Trump. I
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:24.800]  think Donald Trump trusts him as well as Mattis. And they're both picked up a
[1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:31.360]  neocon agenda. But the mere fact that McMaster's was able to eliminate Steve
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:36.520]  Bannon from the National Security Council Committee indicates that he is
[1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:41.200]  having too much influence on Donald Trump. And as I say, I want to reiterate, I
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:44.440]  am convinced Donald Trump has bought into this hook, line, and sinker. And here's
[1:25:44.440 --> 1:25:50.000]  the implication of that. The Russians are beefing up and saying we're not going
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:53.520]  to let you go much further than what you we've let you make your statement, but
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:56.800]  we're not going to let this keep going. And I don't think they are. So I think
[1:25:56.800 --> 1:26:01.440]  Trump and his advisors will back down from this and they'll turn their sights
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:08.480]  towards North Korea. What's really disturbing about Trump's how quickly he
[1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:12.440]  moved in terms of authorizing this strike against Syria without even allowing
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:19.280]  for any rational investigation of the facts on the ground that we're talking
[1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:22.800]  about, the facts that were delivered by Russia about this weapon stockpile in
[1:26:22.800 --> 1:26:31.200]  Syria or in in the Idlib province indicates that he is really trigger
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:35.720]  happy. And once he buys into something, in other words, his ego gets on the line
[1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:39.080]  says, I've committed, I'm going to do it and I'm going to do it by George. And he
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:44.440]  did it. Now, if he applies that to North Korea, first of all, let me say in
[1:26:44.440 --> 1:26:49.160]  practice, I think they should have taken out preemptively North Korea's missile
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:53.440]  and nuclear system years ago. Now, the globalists were in charge then and they
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:57.320]  weren't about to do that because they want to preserve North Korea as a threat
[1:26:57.320 --> 1:27:02.800]  to be a trigger for World War Three. But under that scenario, the globalists
[1:27:02.800 --> 1:27:08.760]  having to wait until China unleashes North Korea on South Korea to start World
[1:27:08.760 --> 1:27:12.880]  War Three. Now we've got a different situation. We've got a president who's
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:18.800]  threatened to take out North Korea if China doesn't call put a caller on Kim
[1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:24.720]  Young-un. And China is not going to do that. China is not going to be seen as
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:28.760]  kowtowing to the United States president. So the chances are very real, David,
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:34.520]  that Donald Trump in the next few weeks is going to plan a strike against North
[1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:40.120]  Korea. Now that could trigger World War Three early, even against China's wishes.
[1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:43.920]  Yeah, I think that's very dangerous. And I think that's what a lot of us see. This
[1:27:43.920 --> 1:27:50.520]  is a message to China and to North Korea, even more so than to Russia. And I agree
[1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:53.800]  with you, absolutely. That's the thing we really have to be concerned about. And
[1:27:53.800 --> 1:28:01.280]  you know, here's what's new about this. I think the globalists intended to have a
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:05.520]  puppet president, a Hillary Clinton, who will continue this slow burn agenda
[1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:10.240]  waiting for Russia and China to get up to speed militarily, which isn't going to
[1:28:10.240 --> 1:28:14.080]  happen until the early part of the next decade. And then they would start this
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:19.880]  war under some pretext. But now that you've got Donald Trump, they can kill
[1:28:19.880 --> 1:28:25.040]  two birds with one stone. One, if they can get Donald Trump to start World War
[1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:30.440]  Three, then they can blame him for it. And suddenly it's not a globalist puppet
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:33.800]  that has to take the blame, that has to get up on television, explain away this.
[1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:38.440]  Yes. They know that they can destroy Donald Trump and his entire supporters and
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:43.160]  label them as the people who started World War Three. Yes. So I'm saying there's a
[1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:47.560]  window of opportunity for the globalists to take advantage of Trump's impetuosity
[1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:53.080]  and to get him to launch a predictive strike against North Korea. So here are
[1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:58.280]  three scenarios. I am three and a half scenarios that I'm postulated. It could
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:04.160]  happen about North Korea. One, North Korea sees Trump threatening in Syria and
[1:29:04.160 --> 1:29:09.600]  decides to launch its first missile against Guam or Hawaii to make good on
[1:29:09.600 --> 1:29:13.960]  his bluster against the United States. However, remember, he doesn't have
[1:29:13.960 --> 1:29:18.040]  maneuvering warheads. This is a simple missile ballistic, easy to shoot down,
[1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:23.440]  especially in a low trajectory to get to Guam or Hawaii. I think the U.S.
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:26.360]  could intercept that missile. We're about out of time, Joel. Give us the other two
[1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:31.160]  scenarios real quickly. Okay. That Trump does a preemptive strike on North Korea
[1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:36.040]  and China threatening to retaliate does and starts World War Three. Or number
[1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:39.760]  three, Trump strikes North Korea in missile sites, North Korea's out of
[1:29:39.760 --> 1:29:45.400]  missiles, and they attack South Korea with the conventional attack and their
[1:29:45.400 --> 1:29:49.400]  cross-border army. Very concerning. Thank you so much, Joel Scows. And stay with us.
[1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:56.760]  We're going to be right back on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:58.760 --> 1:30:04.480]  Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Mike Flynn, Steve Bannon, and now Devin Nunes.
[1:30:04.480 --> 1:30:09.040]  It seems the left's intimidation tactics are actually working. Nunes is the latest
[1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:12.120]  to be asked to step aside after an intense few weeks of grilling from the
[1:30:12.120 --> 1:30:15.680]  left, as the House Intelligence Chairman has now recused himself from the Russian
[1:30:15.680 --> 1:30:19.600]  probe. Isn't that too convenient for the Democrats to have the only one involved
[1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:22.760]  in this Russian probe who actually seems to care about the truth of the matter,
[1:30:22.760 --> 1:30:27.440]  step aside and recuse himself? Just to rub our noses in it, Representative Adam Schiff,
[1:30:27.440 --> 1:30:30.640]  Democrat member of the House Intelligence Committee, made a public statement
[1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:35.000]  moments after Nunes' announcement saying how pleased he was to hear of Nunes'
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  recusal. So now, the Democrats have a monopoly on the political witch hunt that
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:42.560]  is the Russian probe. Thanks, Nunes. The Republicans have gotten their leverage
[1:30:42.560 --> 1:30:46.120]  democratically and refused to use it. The Democrats get their leverage with
[1:30:46.120 --> 1:30:50.320]  smear campaigns and use it successfully. And if we keep allowing them to do it,
[1:30:50.320 --> 1:30:54.680]  they're going to continue. President Trump, the swamp is draining us. For

[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  show. I'm David Knight. We're also going to have joining us. We just talked to Joel
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:28.160]  Scousen. We'll have Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us later in the broadcast. Steve
[1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:32.280]  Pachinnick, Alex Jones will be joining us in just a moment with a comment but I
[1:33:32.280 --> 1:33:36.600]  want to as we were talking to Joel Scousen and he said look the real danger
[1:33:36.600 --> 1:33:41.520]  here is everybody is agreeing. This is a wag the dog scenario to look strong to
[1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:46.920]  China to put North Korea on alert. Could we start World War 3 and he laid out
[1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:51.840]  three scenarios there for us as to how that might happen and as we look at the
[1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:59.600]  people who are cheering this action from Isis to Al Qaeda to John McCain, Lindsay
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:04.960]  Graham, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and then of course the Never Trumpers at the
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:09.680]  weekly standard Bill Kristol's publication. Elliot Abrams said this
[1:34:09.680 --> 1:34:12.960]  today the president has been chief executive since January the 20th but
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:18.720]  this week he also acted as commander in chief and more he finally accepted the
[1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:24.200]  role of leader of the free world. We did not vote for him to be leader of the
[1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:28.560]  free world. We voted for him to be America's leader to put America's
[1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:32.960]  interests first and to follow the Constitution I would say so we do these
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:37.440]  types of things deliberately. This is a Russia judgment and I understand the
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:43.040]  Machiavellian politics behind all of this but I have to say that you don't look
[1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:47.840]  stronger when you're pandering to the Democrats who have been attacking you. I
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:54.480]  got Alex Jones online let's go to Alex Jones. Absolutely absolutely David you
[1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:59.640]  know I got in the car to go take care of this work I'm doing for the company and
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:03.600]  I was flipping through the AM dial just to see what people were saying. Rush
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:08.960]  Limbaugh was ranting against President Trump saying what are you doing you're
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:13.440]  battling on the side of al-Qaeda at ISIS when Assad didn't start the war the
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:19.560]  Clintons did Obama did my whole audience burning against you what are you
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:23.240]  doing you know you said you wouldn't have these wars everyone's sick of it and
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:28.000]  Limbaugh is doing that because his audience is like 90% against this. I
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.200]  don't just always go with my audience when I exposed 9-11 as an inside job I
[1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:36.040]  lost 70 plus stations of 100 I had I lost you know billions of dollars I
[1:35:36.040 --> 1:35:39.360]  would have had to fund the operation I went for being a big star at like you
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:44.760]  know 26 27 years old to being on only 30 stations but I did it because it was
[1:35:44.760 --> 1:35:50.160]  right my listeners hate so I don't just instantly jump on the bandwagon against
[1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:54.960]  Trump you know 24 hours into this but we're analyzing every angle that's what
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:35:58.760]  I do is I get into the knowledge I get into the angles I bring on all the
[1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:02.680]  different voices and I really try to penetrate and understand what's happening
[1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:07.000]  but I just wanted to call in and say this your instinct is right I mean
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:11.360]  everyone in his entire base is turning against Trump because they know it's
[1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:16.480]  al-Qaeda in Syria under the name ISIS they understand the true narrative and
[1:36:16.480 --> 1:36:21.480]  they understand okay sure look tough you know for Russia he sounded just like us
[1:36:21.480 --> 1:36:25.160]  he was it was one boss thing okay look you'll come in front of Russia whatever
[1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:29.280]  what if it starts a war with Russia you know Russia isn't communist anymore
[1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:32.680]  they want to be free market see the problem is all these Republicans like
[1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:36.360]  Warbacher and others used to be anti Russia have gone over to Russia now they
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:39.760]  see it's the wall all west it's what America used to be in many respects it's
[1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:44.120]  got lower taxes than us and Russia doesn't want to be our enemy and so
[1:36:44.120 --> 1:36:49.000]  people are pissed just like the internet just like TV and movies let Russia know
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:52.760]  how good we had it so the old Soviet Union fell Americans despite stuff's bad
[1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:56.440]  in Russia in some areas know that many ways they're more right-wing or
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:00.080]  Christian than we are they know it's all a bunch of bulls they don't want war with
[1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:04.080]  Russia and we're sick of it and we're sick of this being pushed and so I gotta
[1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:07.160]  tell you I'm gonna listen to some other channels before I come back today but I'm
[1:37:07.160 --> 1:37:10.320]  telling you if you don't you have Michael Savage coming out Rush Limbaugh coming
[1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:14.160]  out Rand Paul coming out I'm coming out saying I don't think this is good I see
[1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:17.600]  the maxi-bellion point but he's just getting his enemies on board that'll
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:21.480]  stab him in the back next week these people change policies every five minutes
[1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:25.880]  we need to get past this we should actually backing the thought until we
[1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:30.600]  defeat al-Qaeda and then he promises to have election so this is just crazy and
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:35.640]  it's garbage and we're on the wrong side here and again the paradox is this we
[1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:38.960]  have no special report David they're coming back and we cut off part of our
[1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:42.800]  report it's fine the paradox my friend is he's doing so good on the economy and
[1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:46.800]  so many other things but it hurts my heart and it really makes me sick back
[1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:51.200]  to David night and my special report coming up David Douglas yeah actually you
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:54.640]  know Alex what were you saying about that Rush Limbaugh we see Ann Coulter
[1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:57.880]  saying tweeting this out he said he told us that he would be the president of
[1:37:57.880 --> 1:38:02.160]  America not the world could somebody show him the pictures of Americans who
[1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:07.560]  are being raped and killed by illegals and that is what we voted for we've seen
[1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:11.080]  some positive results on that side we saw in the last month the lowest border
[1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:16.480]  crossings in 17 years so there's been progress in other areas TPP was shut down
[1:38:16.480 --> 1:38:21.800]  but now we've got this game of thrones is going on in the White House a Jared
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:25.360]  Kushner and the Goldman Sachs people I'll break that down for you later in the
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:31.000]  broadcast but as that is happening we see Donald Trump moving against the
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:34.960]  people and the wishes of the voters and a handshake that he had with us Alex
[1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:39.120]  Jones at the beginning here in Texas you look somebody in the eye you shake
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:42.600]  their hand we had that handshake it's called an election he looked us in the
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:46.800]  eye he said I'm gonna put America first I'm gonna fix our country before we
[1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:52.280]  start on this globalist regime change idea that is making us all less safe
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:55.920]  and destroying our economy at the same time we create this massive military
[1:38:55.920 --> 1:38:59.880]  build-up so we had that handshake and then we saw with Obamacare this is the
[1:38:59.880 --> 1:39:03.000]  thing that concerns me as well we saw what Kushner was doing with Obamacare
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:08.760]  bringing in the architect of Obamacare Rami manuals brother Zeke manual and
[1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:13.800]  then attacking afterwards attacking the people who had stood by him attacking
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:17.680]  them by name people like Mark Meadows remember a month before the election when
[1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:21.920]  they threw Trump under the bus with this old tape that he had where he was
[1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:28.480]  talking to the to the Bush guy when he when that came out we had Paul Ryan tell
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:33.640]  all of the congressmen forget Trump he's done save yourself don't allow
[1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:38.400]  yourself with him Mark Meadows said no he is talking about the things we want
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:42.400]  to see happen we're going to stick by him we need to get rid of Paul Ryan so
[1:39:42.400 --> 1:39:47.160]  that's exactly what should have happened and instead we see him turning in the
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:51.200]  other direction he's now going with the Jeb the Hillary factions I want to go
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:55.800]  this Facebook report that Alex has it's titled why Trump attacked Syrian airbase
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:40:02.880]  revealed Alex Jones here with a live update breaking down why President
[1:40:02.880 --> 1:40:09.280]  Trump launched 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase last night this was done
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:14.440]  for many reasons the Democrats and others continue to act like President
[1:40:14.440 --> 1:40:19.240]  Trump is somehow a Russian agent and has been soft on Putin and soft on Assad
[1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:23.880]  when in truth our military for more than four years has been refusing to follow
[1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:28.280]  the orders of the neocons Obama and Hillary and launch a full-scale
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:33.240]  invasion of Syria into that civil war because that civil war itself was
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:37.920]  publicly started by Obama by Hillary by the globalist by the neocons and as
[1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:42.400]  part of the larger Arab Spring Libya and the failed state she came she saw he
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:48.120]  died was an admitted launch pad into Syria with the weapons info wars.com
[1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:53.200]  pioneered with Colonel Schaefer and Dr. Steve Pachinik and Dr. Paul Craig
[1:40:53.200 --> 1:40:57.680]  Roberts and countless other geopolitical experts on my broadcast day one
[1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:02.280]  breaking what really happened at Benghazi we broke it breaking the plan to go
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:05.680]  into Syria we broke it breaking the plan to destabilize the entire Middle East
[1:41:05.680 --> 1:41:10.400]  we broke it so let's be clear info wars spearheaded getting the military and
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:14.040]  others have stated up and say we will not be al-Qaeda's air force in Syria
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:18.160]  remember all that with Rand Paul and then of course senator Cruz that all was
[1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:21.880]  generated by info wars now I'm not giving ourselves credit just to give credit
[1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:26.240]  I'm doing it because some detractors are saying see Trump scum he's a warmonger
[1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:30.040]  and you backed him and it's your fault and you're supporting al-Qaeda in Syria
[1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:34.160]  and all this crap now because you're bombing Assad I'm not supporting any
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:39.360]  of this I'm analyzing what happened I'm breaking it down those are correct to
[1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:43.400]  record bots that we see all over the place with the left pushing a narrative
[1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:47.440]  to undermine Trump now if Trump keeps going sideways I will be critical of him
[1:41:47.440 --> 1:41:50.360]  in fact I've been critical on multiple fronts but I've got to wait and see
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:54.200]  approach so let me lay out the facts of why Trump did do this I said this last
[1:41:54.200 --> 1:41:58.320]  night before the missiles were launched I said it in a in a another report I
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:01.880]  filed and now this morning all of it's being admitted so now I'm going to give
[1:42:01.880 --> 1:42:06.960]  you the rest of the story so imagine geopolitically you're Trump they're
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:10.400]  claiming that you're this Russian agent they're saying you're soft on Syria you
[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:14.120]  know that Syria has been turned over to radical al-habis out of Saudi Arabia under
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:19.680]  the name al-Nusra ISIS al-Qaeda all the same group same flags same mission you
[1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:23.720]  know that the generals are telling you if we turn this over to them they will
[1:42:23.720 --> 1:42:26.960]  kill every Christian in Syria and it'll be a horrible failed state you but you
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:30.960]  also know Assad's done some bad stuff and it's not a good guy as well and that
[1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:34.320]  that is a dictatorship that they've been trying to reform by the way but but
[1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:38.840]  still we kind of more like Saddam or even as bad as Saddam way better than
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:42.080]  you know obviously folks like al-Qaeda and so what do you do what do you do if
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:46.000]  you're gonna have a moral position there in this key area in the region that if
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:49.560]  al-Qaeda takes it over will basically implode into Turkey and then into Europe
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:53.080]  as we're already seeing with airgun threatening jihad's in Europe if Europe
[1:42:53.080 --> 1:42:56.520]  doesn't capitulate to all of his demands like opening up the borders further
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:02.360]  let more Muslims in or we'll attack you so again that's the geopolitical
[1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:07.640]  situation we're facing so what does Trump do there's a gas attack there's all
[1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:10.480]  these witnesses saying it was planes flying over dropping it clearly at
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:15.100]  stage teleprompters we've all seen it it's it's absolutely canned like babies
[1:43:15.100 --> 1:43:19.200]  out of incubators in 1990 and it turned out the girl was the head of you know
[1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:22.080]  her dad was the head of a PR firm she'd ever been to Kuwait it was all fake
[1:43:22.080 --> 1:43:26.520]  that's all confirmed so yes we're seeing made up WMDs again we're seeing
[1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:31.440]  babies running incubators again clearly al-Qaeda slash al-Nuzra ISIS has been
[1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:35.040]  caught not once not twice not three times but at least four times launching
[1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:39.840]  fake chemical attacks in the last four years and getting caught doing it because
[1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:44.360]  their own people shoot celebration videos they're so badly coordinated showing
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:48.760]  that they launched the chemical attacks even the UN had to say okay it was not a
[1:43:48.760 --> 1:43:55.560]  sod doing it well of course Obama comes out and says if you want you to attack
[1:43:55.560 --> 1:43:59.760]  that's my red line I will do an air bombardment attack you on the one-year
[1:43:59.760 --> 1:44:03.520]  anniversary of that as if Assad wants to be attacked by the United States and
[1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:08.800]  overthrown I mean key bono he does not benefit from it they then launch a
[1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:12.760]  supposed chemical attack and it turns out within 24 hours that it was the
[1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:16.640]  al-Qaeda people doing their military says that's it is clearly al-Qaeda we're
[1:44:16.640 --> 1:44:20.480]  not part of this we won't be their air force so they rebrand as ISIS to
[1:44:20.480 --> 1:44:24.560]  confuse the military and confuse the West about who Obama and Hillary and
[1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:28.000]  John Kerry are backing this is all incontrovertible historical fact so
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  info wars is opposing this from day one educating the public about it Trump
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:36.360]  supports as a candidate general Flynn and others who'd been a part of this
[1:44:36.360 --> 1:44:40.480]  trying to stabilize the region and kick al-Qaeda and ISIS out they're already
[1:44:40.480 --> 1:44:44.360]  taking over parts of Iraq as well the two countries border each other so you
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:48.240]  have that unfolding so you have Islamic State between Iraq and between Syria
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:51.440]  right there as a piece of the two countries if you're Syria here's Iraq
[1:44:51.440 --> 1:44:55.480]  you've got this piece it's invading both Saudi Arabia is backing it our own
[1:44:55.480 --> 1:45:01.320]  State Department's been backing it Trump stops that then in just 75 days
[1:45:01.320 --> 1:45:05.400]  cleans out almost defeats all of ISIS and al-Qaeda with thousands and its
[1:45:05.400 --> 1:45:09.200]  thousands of US troops on the ground fighting with other forces from the
[1:45:09.200 --> 1:45:14.000]  region then all of a sudden McCain flies over there and a month later there's
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:17.600]  this chemical attack that Ron Paul says a false flag we said it looked like a
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:20.720]  false flag day one it's got all the evidence the way the media rolled it
[1:45:20.720 --> 1:45:26.760]  out absolutely so I say yesterday Trump I said please don't do this because it's
[1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:30.680]  probably a false flag and I said even if you're taking out limited sites this
[1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:35.200]  can widen the war the Russians could respond but then we learned Mattis the
[1:45:35.200 --> 1:45:41.000]  the head of the Defense Department and others were meeting with the Syrians and
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:47.120]  the Russians in high-level negotiation meetings at some undisclosed location as
[1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:52.120]  this happened and I chopped the video last night saying they're probably going
[1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:55.320]  to let the Russians know what they're going to hit the Russians are gonna pull
[1:45:55.320 --> 1:45:59.280]  out and I said wait a minute that base is the base that's in middly where Assad
[1:45:59.280 --> 1:46:04.280]  four years ago agreed to give up his chemical weapons in exchange for not
[1:46:04.280 --> 1:46:09.440]  being bombarded and so now the argument from Trump is behind the scenes you
[1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:12.840]  already said that those weapons won't be used we'll just prove it we're gonna
[1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:16.400]  blow them up that way the United States looks strong that way we don't get
[1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:19.400]  sucked in and forced to come in and overthrow your regime completely that
[1:46:19.400 --> 1:46:22.920]  way you can transition into a new elected government which Assad has already
[1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:26.840]  agreed to do as soon as ISIS has pushed out folks didn't want that old
[1:46:26.840 --> 1:46:30.920]  agreement with our military and the Russians set up over four years ago by
[1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:34.360]  the Pentagon outside of Obama but then that's all been confirmed Sy Hersh has
[1:46:34.360 --> 1:46:38.680]  confirmed that on my show it's years after we told you okay so there's an
[1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:42.320]  agreement four years ago that okay we'll push ISIS and al-Qaeda out then you'll
[1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:45.560]  actually have a stabilization government you'll have elections Assad will step
[1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:49.080]  down but you got to put your chemical weapons at these bases the Russians
[1:46:49.080 --> 1:46:54.160]  control then Trump gets checked you know put in check by the fake false flag that
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:46:56.800]  oh my god look the children are all dying look at these horrible images better
[1:46:56.800 --> 1:47:00.400]  do something Trump or you're with the Russians you're with ISIS they clearly
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:02.680]  know it's a false flag they say listen you've already agreed here at these
[1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:05.320]  chemical weapons we're gonna blow them up in place it's just like you'll
[1:47:05.320 --> 1:47:09.440]  be done in Iraq they have the a meeting they have the agreement the Russians
[1:47:09.440 --> 1:47:13.400]  make some statements they don't like it boom the 59 cruise missiles hit it they
[1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:16.820]  destroy it it's already agreed to be destroyed four years ago and then
[1:47:16.820 --> 1:47:21.280]  Trump looks strong to the neocons the leftists and everybody else and can't
[1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:24.680]  be blamed for the false flag attack that Trump and his generals know a false
[1:47:24.680 --> 1:47:28.440]  flag and false flags that the same generals exposed years ago as false
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:32.280]  flags and through our intel sources gave us the intel to expose the American
[1:47:32.280 --> 1:47:36.920]  people now what you just heard is not my opinion it's what happened it's the facts
[1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:41.000]  I put it in a video one hour before the strikes happened last night and then
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:45.240]  another video I did an hour into it laying it out and sure enough the
[1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:49.840]  Russians admit they were told they pulled out a day before it was chemicals
[1:47:49.840 --> 1:47:53.480]  that were agreed to be gotten rid of four years ago and Trump's just executing
[1:47:53.480 --> 1:47:57.960]  the deal they already signed something Obama didn't even do and now sitting a
[1:47:57.960 --> 1:48:00.880]  clear message to al Qaeda and ISIS and all the rest of them they're gonna be
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:04.440]  pushed out of the country and the deal to put a democratically elected
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:08.640]  government in Syria will now roll forward now that's what Trump was clearly
[1:48:08.640 --> 1:48:13.240]  told that's what he's executing that's what makes sense some of these more
[1:48:13.240 --> 1:48:17.640]  right-wing generals though want wider wars like McMasters and others and
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:20.280]  Trump's gonna be really careful I'm not enemies of these generals I know they
[1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:23.120]  were following orders under the neocons previously I hope they're not complete
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:28.680]  you know neocons because because that policy is authoritarian and it will end
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:31.720]  up destroying the planet and it's not moral and we need to have the moral
[1:48:31.720 --> 1:48:36.560]  high ground as Americans that said this is very Machiavellian done now what is
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:40.480]  the final cherry and I knew this last night when I shot a video before it
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:47.400]  even happened the last cherry is the fact that the communist dictator G is
[1:48:47.400 --> 1:48:51.000]  what was landing yesterday at six o'clock in Mar-a-Lago they were meeting
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:56.040]  at 7 30 an hour before the attacks come guaranteed he's told about it he's
[1:48:56.040 --> 1:49:00.400]  brought in and while he's under U.S. control there on the beautiful Florida
[1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:05.920]  Beach sitting there with Donald Trump he sees Syria being bombarded about 59
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:11.840]  cruise missiles a very strong message while our country's on the edge of war
[1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:17.280]  with the situation in the South China Sea and Korea with the Korean dictator
[1:49:17.280 --> 1:49:21.000]  threatening to nuke everybody with China threatening all of this military
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:24.680]  action trying to take over the South China Sea with all of us happening this
[1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:28.320]  is a message of the Communist Chinese North Korea and others that America is
[1:49:28.320 --> 1:49:33.160]  very very strong so quite frankly it's a win-win-win-win-win on so many fronts
[1:49:33.160 --> 1:49:36.200]  those chemical weapons have been destroyed the box got to be cleaned up
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:41.640]  now it's very dirty way to get rid of that's the standard way you ISIS has to
[1:49:41.640 --> 1:49:45.000]  continue to be defeated and pushed out you know people say oh you're supporting
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:48.280]  the invasion of Syria because you support ISIS and al-Qaeda being kicked out our
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:52.720]  government helped put those people in our military then said no to it four
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:56.240]  plus years ago and began pushing it out and I am so proud of the fact that
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:02.280]  info wars.com was really the seed at the progenitor of the whole movement to
[1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:06.120]  help as a focal point with our military and patriots in intelligence agencies
[1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:09.040]  who don't want to be a moral and who don't want to be part of killing a
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:13.280]  bunch of Christians and he's stabilizing a more stable Muslim country that all
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:18.320]  the other borders the gateway to Europe Turkey so this is a big big deal I hope
[1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:22.120]  that this analysis is dead on I know what most of it is what actually happened
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:27.360]  but that's up to you to debate discuss but I will tell you this I see the bots
[1:50:27.360 --> 1:50:31.800]  on info wars and I see them on YouTube and I see the same comments spammed
[1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:35.560]  everywhere and we know it's a bunch of bots trying to create this whole fake
[1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:39.520]  debate to then undermine the Liberty Movement undermine Trump undermine
[1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:43.600]  info wars like we're supporting wars we didn't support any of these wars ladies
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:46.920]  and gentlemen and we've been spot on the entire time about everything just like
[1:50:46.920 --> 1:50:50.440]  Donald Trump was against attack on Iraq said they didn't have WMDs on the eve
[1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:56.440]  of the war in 2003 now here's the deal Trump is putting our coal back on okay
[1:50:56.440 --> 1:50:59.800]  Trump has brought three trillion in the stock market already with the
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:03.920]  exuberance 300 billion in new jobs hundreds of companies moving back he's
[1:51:03.920 --> 1:51:07.960]  killing the carbon taxes he's bringing the coal back the clean coal he is
[1:51:07.960 --> 1:51:11.720]  attacking political correctness we have all these pro-gun bills passing
[1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:14.880]  everywhere we have just our border being secured
[1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:18.160]  I've seen people saying the wall hasn't been built they're building it at record
[1:51:18.160 --> 1:51:22.120]  speed the prototypes being built right now all this incredible positive stuff's
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:26.840]  happening and I see in the bots oh you love war now you're with al-Qaeda in Syria
[1:51:26.840 --> 1:51:30.400]  now and Trump hasn't delivered and where's the wall that's a load of crap
[1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:35.920]  thinking libertarians and patriots are idiots okay this is the first military
[1:51:35.920 --> 1:51:39.080]  action I've supported in the long time because it's cleaning out al-Qaeda it's
[1:51:39.080 --> 1:51:42.280]  cleaning out ISIS they're being defeated they're panicking they're leaving the
[1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:45.160]  country they're getting driven into Iraq they're being caught in a pincers
[1:51:45.160 --> 1:51:49.120]  attack in Iraq and Syria and when that's cleaned out then the agreement with
[1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:52.640]  Assad four years ago in our military and Russia was that Russia would come in and
[1:51:52.640 --> 1:51:56.720]  help we would help and then they would have elections and stabilize the country
[1:51:56.720 --> 1:52:01.720]  again perhaps even give the Kurds their own area regardless ladies and gentlemen
[1:52:01.720 --> 1:52:05.200]  this is a stabilization effort taking place right now and that's why I am
[1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:09.360]  tacitly supporting it but it's very hard to control the military industrial
[1:52:09.360 --> 1:52:13.440]  complex and if Trump starts going sideways I will come out and say I don't
[1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:16.800]  like it so we're the ones playing the Ron Paul clips where he says it's a false
[1:52:16.800 --> 1:52:20.480]  flag we're saying it's a false flag we're documenting it's a false flag we
[1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:25.120]  expose the whole paradigm and popularize the terms false flags and it's it's
[1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:28.000]  almost kind of encouraging though to see our own listeners to some of them aren't
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:31.400]  bought some of them are real you know say hey what is this your pro war and all
[1:52:31.400 --> 1:52:35.000]  this crap that's not what I've said that's not what I've done we're about real
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:39.640]  analysis real information real historical understanding of what's going on
[1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:43.520]  Trump with the situation was supporting Paul Ryan's health care that was better
[1:52:43.520 --> 1:52:48.360]  than Obamacare but still horrible that's a that's a mark against it going after
[1:52:48.360 --> 1:52:51.960]  the Freedom Caucus you'll say they're the problem no they're your base and your
[1:52:51.960 --> 1:52:56.200]  backbone Mr. President and if anybody's trying to convince you in the
[1:52:56.200 --> 1:52:59.280]  linehouse to work with the establishment trying to compromise they're never
[1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:02.240]  going to compromise you could totally sell out to them which I know you won't
[1:53:02.240 --> 1:53:05.920]  and they'll want to destroy you because you're an image now of nationalism and
[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:10.160]  patriotism and of men being strong and of the return of nation-states and
[1:53:10.160 --> 1:53:14.160]  self-determination they will destroy you as a symbol of nationalism just like
[1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:18.280]  they want America destroyed because you cannot have a nationalist prosperous
[1:53:18.280 --> 1:53:21.840]  free-market system because it makes the Venezuela's and the North Korea's and
[1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:25.840]  all the other centralized systems look absolutely hellish like they are in
[1:53:25.840 --> 1:53:30.480]  comparison they cannot compete with the Americana system so I'm begging the
[1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:34.360]  president and I'm begging the American people like Stephen Bannon said to hold
[1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:37.760]  his feet to the fire and to and to continue to battle for our Americana
[1:53:37.760 --> 1:53:41.080]  values but look how far we've come exposing the private fellow reserve look
[1:53:41.080 --> 1:53:43.760]  how far we've come with globalism admitting it's collapsing look at all
[1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:46.840]  the name of nationalistic movements taking place everywhere is there some
[1:53:46.840 --> 1:53:51.120]  utopia out of that no but it's better than TPP ruling us off in secret oh I
[1:53:51.120 --> 1:53:55.800]  forgot he killed TPP second day in office the globalists are in full panic
[1:53:55.800 --> 1:53:59.240]  their entire global system is falling apart transferring our power to some
[1:53:59.240 --> 1:54:03.440]  secret unelected group so just remember all the things Trump has done putting
[1:54:03.440 --> 1:54:07.880]  globalism back ten years before people sit there and don't understand the full
[1:54:07.880 --> 1:54:11.400]  geopolitical ramifications of the destabilization program launched by
[1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:15.680]  Soros Google and the globalist admittedly starting six years ago in Tunisia
[1:54:15.680 --> 1:54:19.400]  spreading in Libya our own government helping overthrow our ally Hosni Mubarak
[1:54:19.400 --> 1:54:22.800]  and putting Muslim Brotherhood in to blow up over 200 churches and murder
[1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:25.880]  Christians by the tens of thousands and all the rest of crap spreading across
[1:54:25.880 --> 1:54:29.720]  the Middle East and into Africa and now Trump is actually because I have all the
[1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:33.560]  sources but I can also see the action cutting them off all over the world the
[1:54:33.560 --> 1:54:38.120]  radical Islamic global bloom is being is being blocked by President Trump right
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:41.960]  now will there be mistakes will there be problems damn right there will be but
[1:54:41.960 --> 1:54:45.960]  if I see Trump trying to overthrow Assad and let al-Qaeda slash al-Nusra ISIS from
[1:54:45.960 --> 1:54:50.040]  that country then I will come out against Donald Trump 110% but that
[1:54:50.040 --> 1:54:53.240]  hasn't happened yet so we're gonna sit here and we're gonna watch what happens
[1:54:53.240 --> 1:54:56.920]  but just remember you were this close to having Hillary Clinton and that which
[1:54:56.920 --> 1:54:59.960]  came out I knew that we're gonna hit last night when she came out on CNN at
[1:54:59.960 --> 1:55:04.840]  about seven this big gold outfit and said I hit all those airfields and I do
[1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:08.680]  this and that knowing that that was coming so that she could all look like
[1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:12.600]  a genius and I mean it's just it's so scripted ladies and gentlemen and with
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:16.360]  Trump it's not because the cards are so close to the vest but then I'm looking
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:20.320]  at it geopolitically what I would do if I was actually trying to you know cut off
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:24.880]  the rush of foam garbage shut up the Democrats shut up the neocons but but
[1:55:24.880 --> 1:55:27.920]  actually make Assad follow through on his deal to destroy the stuff so we're
[1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:31.160]  still sitting there at the airbase under Russian control and I knew they
[1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:34.320]  called the Russians and said you agreed to blow that up we're blowing that up
[1:55:34.320 --> 1:55:38.360]  pull out Russians pulled out Russians can have their rhetoric United States has
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:42.440]  their rhetoric our generals and military are working with them on on on airstrikes
[1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:46.640]  on intelligence on everything okay that's that's an admitted fact and you
[1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:50.320]  heard it all first at info wars.com you want to know what's happening a year
[1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:53.480]  before it's admitted the mainstream news info wars.com that's why they're
[1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:56.080]  censoring us that's why they're demonizing us it's why they're blocking us
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:55:59.720]  because we're true nationalists that are pro-human and want free market
[1:55:59.720 --> 1:56:03.800]  renaissance on a planetary scale spread the word info wars.com forward slash

[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:24.040]  Facebook post and things are moving very very quickly you heard him say that he
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:28.720]  would not support a regime change there and things are moving now in that
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:32.400]  direction we have a story on info wars.com from Mikhail Phelan quoting
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:36.560]  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson saying steps are underway to remove Syrian
[1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:41.960]  President Bashar Assad from power he said that Assad has no role in the
[1:56:41.960 --> 1:56:45.640]  future of Syria and that there will be an appropriate response from President
[1:56:45.640 --> 1:56:49.200]  Trump to that he said Assad's role in the future is uncertain clearly and with the
[1:56:49.200 --> 1:56:52.960]  Axis taking it would seem there will be no role for him to govern the Syrian
[1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:56.160]  people we hope that that will not be the case I'm going to go back to the news
[1:56:56.160 --> 1:56:59.880]  here we're going to lay down so this course we also have Steve Pachennik is

[1:58:04.640 --> 1:58:10.000]  right now is that they've not pushed back significantly on the move by those
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:15.280]  in Silicon Valley to isolate info wars and the rest of the independent media
[1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:19.000]  using Google and Facebook and so it's very important that you establish that

[2:00:24.920 --> 2:00:28.440]  Picinic as well as room coursey joining us in this hour to talk about what's
[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:33.120]  going on as I was saying in the last hour we've got the neocons the never
[2:00:33.120 --> 2:00:37.280]  Trumpers people like Bill Crystal and his publication weekly standard cheering
[2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:42.560]  that's what's going on along with McCain Lindsey Graham Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer
[2:00:42.560 --> 2:00:48.120]  Isis Al Qaeda they're all cheering what Donald Trump did Erdogan the European
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:51.920]  Union leaders but then on the other side we've got all the people that supported
[2:00:51.920 --> 2:00:55.360]  Donald Trump that put him in office it's amazing to see what is happening and
[2:00:55.360 --> 2:01:00.320]  it really does parallel the fight that we saw with Obamacare and the fact that
[2:01:00.320 --> 2:01:05.920]  we had and the aftermath of it all of a sudden when Kushner comes back from
[2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:11.000]  Espen where he distances himself and so he doesn't take any responsibility for
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:15.920]  the failure of the Obamacare tweaks it wasn't a repeal of Obamacare it wasn't
[2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:19.840]  what we were promised we would see with Obamacare instead what he does is he
[2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:23.120]  turns on the people who had supported Donald Trump even when Paul Ryan threw
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:29.360]  him under the bus and that ranker that Donald Trump had there was surprising
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:32.520]  enough but then when he would say we need to work with the Democrats to get
[2:01:32.520 --> 2:01:36.080]  this stuff done you should have understood what was going on there it's
[2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:40.600]  the West Wing Democrats as Politico talks about it this Jared Kushner and
[2:01:40.600 --> 2:01:46.720]  Goldman Sachs Lee Strenahan had a great editorial where he put through the
[2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:52.320]  connections of Goldman Sachs and he essentially said hey it's the same
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:57.520]  globalism just a different bank we had Citibank heavily connected to Barack
[2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:01.640]  Obama now we have Goldman Sachs and he put it this way he said in a nutshell
[2:02:01.640 --> 2:02:05.920]  weeks after meeting with Goldman Sachs CEO the number one at Goldman Sachs
[2:02:05.920 --> 2:02:11.560]  Lloyd Blankfein at the Four Seasons in DC Jared Kushner friendly Goldman
[2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:16.960]  alums have been successfully maneuvered as Trump's top advisor Steve Bannon is
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:21.240]  pushed off in the National Security Council he said Jared Kushner it should
[2:02:21.240 --> 2:02:24.360]  be pointed out has a well-documented history of donating to Democrats
[2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:28.560]  including Hillary Clinton Chuck Schumer and Robert Mendez Democrat of New
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:32.240]  Jersey and so these are the people that are very happy about this new policy
[2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:36.040]  these are the people who did not want to see Obamacare repealed and then he
[2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:39.080]  takes a look at some of the ex-goldman operators this is very important
[2:02:39.080 --> 2:02:42.560]  because this is one of the people there's an article out from Axios saying
[2:02:42.560 --> 2:02:46.480]  that there may be a shake-up with the White House chief of staff we might have
[2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:51.000]  previous and Bannon completely taken out and they had four names that they put
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:55.320]  up there one of the four names was this man who is the friend of Jared Kushner
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:59.600]  the number two former number two guy at Goldman Sachs he got an
[2:02:59.600 --> 2:03:04.360]  unprecedented payout if you remember of 285 million dollars they accelerated his
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:09.480]  bonuses he was also the guy at Goldman who led the delegation of restructure
[2:03:09.480 --> 2:03:13.600]  Greek debt during financial crisis as least ran him points out and he has
[2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:19.560]  now brought in Drew Quinn who was a lead negotiator of TPP so even though
[2:03:19.560 --> 2:03:22.640]  Donald Trump campaigned on getting rid of TPP and even though he did it as one
[2:03:22.640 --> 2:03:27.960]  of the very first things as soon as Gary Cohen got involved there he's now
[2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:32.240]  bringing in Quinn the guy who was the architect of TPP they're hoping they
[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:36.760]  can stop any action on NAFTA but that's not all we have other people we have
[2:03:36.760 --> 2:03:43.280]  Dinah Habib Powell she is married to a guy Richard Powell who is president at
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:48.280]  Clinton linked Pinio and remember this was the organization that was talked
[2:03:48.280 --> 2:03:51.240]  about a great deal along with the Clinton Foundation even Washington Post talked
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:55.680]  about it as Bill Clinton Inc. okay Wicked Leaks email showed this
[2:03:55.680 --> 2:03:59.960]  relationship between that corporation Doug Bann and the Clintons and so that's
[2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:04.400]  her husband who's the president there Bill Clinton is and was an advisor there
[2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:08.720]  they hired Huma Abedin that was where she was doing the double dipping as she
[2:04:08.720 --> 2:04:12.480]  was working at the State Department also working for this corporation that had
[2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:18.680]  close ties to Bill Clinton now his wife is now been brought into the Trump
[2:04:18.680 --> 2:04:22.400]  administration by Gary Cohen and the Goldman Sachs people she also worked for
[2:04:22.400 --> 2:04:27.160]  the second Bush administration and her connections to Goldman Sachs and the
[2:04:27.160 --> 2:04:31.360]  Bushes are what we're looking at this is what is happening folks the fact that
[2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:37.760]  we have people who were the architects of Obamacare the architects of TPP being
[2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:43.120]  brought in by Jared Kushner and Gary Cohen to completely shut down Donald
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:47.200]  Trump and this is the concern as we're talking about his reliance on people who
[2:04:47.200 --> 2:04:52.120]  are experts and putting more reliance on the pragmatism from these experts then
[2:04:52.120 --> 2:05:00.960]  on principles that he campaigned for will be right back the mainstream media can
[2:05:00.960 --> 2:05:06.400]  no longer claim that president Donald Trump is Putin's puppet tonight I
[2:05:06.400 --> 2:05:14.440]  ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the
[2:05:14.440 --> 2:05:20.960]  chemical attack was launched it is in this vital national security interest
[2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:27.360]  of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly
[2:05:27.360 --> 2:05:33.400]  chemical weapons satellite pictures have been released of the major damage to
[2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:39.440]  the Syrian airfields meanwhile Russia has responded by diverting warships to
[2:05:39.440 --> 2:05:45.240]  protect the Syrian coast and bolster missile defenses against further US
[2:05:45.240 --> 2:05:51.640]  strikes as fear grows that this crisis could escalate into a major conflict

[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:22.840]  David Knight and we're going to Dr. Steve Pachennick right now of course Dr.
[2:08:22.840 --> 2:08:26.400]  Pachennick is an American psychiatrist a former State Department official for
[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:29.760]  four administrations he certainly understands what's going on there he's
[2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:32.800]  had 20 years experience with that of course he's also a co-creator of the
[2:08:32.800 --> 2:08:38.880]  best-selling Tom Clancy Ops Center and Netforce paperback series and Dr.
[2:08:38.880 --> 2:08:45.080]  Pachennick before the election became very outspoken and he would come on to
[2:08:45.080 --> 2:08:49.240]  our show very frequently and we wouldn't have pictures of him but he came out
[2:08:49.240 --> 2:08:54.440]  before the election saying this is a coup against the globalists and so Dr.
[2:08:54.440 --> 2:08:58.160]  Pachennick I want to ask you is there a counter coup going on now in the White
[2:08:58.160 --> 2:09:03.640]  House what do you make of all this well I think that's what is important to
[2:09:03.640 --> 2:09:09.920]  understand David is two elements in this number one in order to refresh your
[2:09:09.920 --> 2:09:14.880]  memory and your audience's memory I was involved with our military intelligence
[2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:19.320]  about eight nine years ago just before the Syrian civil war when I literally
[2:09:19.320 --> 2:09:25.320]  went into Syria and Bashar Assad and his people interrogated me and then allowed
[2:09:25.320 --> 2:09:31.120]  me to travel all over the country for 18 days what I came out of that was and I
[2:09:31.120 --> 2:09:36.440]  reported this to my contacts and military intelligence was a very simple
[2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:42.040]  point that Bashar Assad was not going to leave and I had also worked against
[2:09:42.040 --> 2:09:48.400]  Hafez Assad his father so I understood very well that Hafez Assad Bashar Assad
[2:09:48.400 --> 2:09:54.120]  the all Alawite community which is a minority community in Syria would still
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:10:01.080]  dominate a predominantly Sunni country what happened subsequently was that Assad
[2:10:01.080 --> 2:10:06.520]  was not very effective in handling what was really a water war and the people
[2:10:06.520 --> 2:10:12.520]  from Homs and Hama came up and they were Sunnis and they protested the handling
[2:10:12.520 --> 2:10:17.000]  of the water distribution of food subsequently anyway what subsequently
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:22.600]  happened is that our intelligence community through the CIA and other
[2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:27.280]  elements of the civilian part created ISIS and Al-Qaeda and you've talked
[2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:32.200]  about it but the most important part was that our military understood very
[2:10:32.200 --> 2:10:37.720]  clearly what it was that I was saying and understood that there was no way we
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:41.680]  were going to be in the business of regime changing having said that I
[2:10:41.680 --> 2:10:47.320]  understand a little bit about a gentleman master in even general matters and I
[2:10:47.320 --> 2:10:53.240]  think the important thing to remember in both these gentlemen and also the
[2:10:53.240 --> 2:11:01.800]  surrounding facts is that President Trump initiated this strike just at the
[2:11:01.800 --> 2:11:07.680]  moment when Kim Jong-un when Kim Ji-pong the president of I'm sorry when
[2:11:07.680 --> 2:11:13.740]  President Ji Ji-pong of China was literally at the doorstep of Marder
[2:11:13.740 --> 2:11:19.760]  Lago and he did this and I think our military did it for very important
[2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:25.600]  reasons number one it was a very clear message to President Ji more than to
[2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:31.600]  anybody else more than Russia more than the ISIS or anybody else that listen
[2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:36.920]  you President Ji you were involved in violence during the Chinese cultural
[2:11:36.920 --> 2:11:42.760]  revolution you don't like violence we don't like violence but if you have any
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:49.800]  question as to the resolve of a president i.e. Trump as opposed to Obama or
[2:11:49.800 --> 2:11:57.280]  anyone else let me reassure you that I will order a strike against some base
[2:11:57.280 --> 2:12:02.960]  air base which is not as relevant as anybody thinks and it will be done in
[2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:09.120]  your presence I think President Ji Ji Pong was absolutely stunned by what he
[2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:15.240]  saw and what he realized that message that was sent to President Ji Ji Pong
[2:12:15.240 --> 2:12:21.360]  was also translated to to Prime Minister and President and CEO of North
[2:12:21.360 --> 2:12:27.720]  Korea Kim Jong-un who has been playing around with nuclear weapons as a way of
[2:12:27.720 --> 2:12:33.600]  creating some leverage for negotiation our only negotiation quite frankly is
[2:12:33.600 --> 2:12:40.120]  through China China can and can literally suppress anything that North
[2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:45.560]  Korea wants to do our military does not want to go into North Korea they don't
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:49.800]  want to do preemptive action they don't want to go into a war in Syria our
[2:12:49.800 --> 2:12:54.080]  military does not want to follow the neocons even though some neocons
[2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:59.440]  correctly came in but they were thrown out thanks to Alex Jones myself and
[2:12:59.440 --> 2:13:04.320]  others Elliot Abrams didn't come in a whole bunch of others didn't come in but
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:08.800]  when we're talking about our generals McMaster who wrote the dereliction of
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:14.880]  duty we're talking a job general matters they understood very clearly that war is
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:20.080]  not the solution to what our problem is what is a solution is what I call the
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:25.280]  kabuki of war in other words we will show you what we're capable of doing at
[2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:31.840]  the right time in the right place so the Syrian so-called attack was really
[2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:36.640]  done not for Syria and not for Russia all of them were cleared beforehand
[2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:42.000]  Russian understood this was happening Turkey was informed every country was
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:47.600]  informed Saudi Arabia Israel even Syria and Bashar Assad understood it but the
[2:13:47.600 --> 2:13:52.320]  only people who are not informed was President Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un
[2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:59.080]  what this means now is that the matrix of negotiation with the president of
[2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:05.360]  China and North Korea has suddenly shifted to our advantage for 20 to 30
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:08.920]  years I've been involved with North Korea and quite frankly it's been
[2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:14.560]  frustrating I've been held back on my capability to do regime change because I
[2:14:14.560 --> 2:14:19.800]  knew exactly how to take down the North Koreans the greatest fear China has and
[2:14:19.800 --> 2:14:24.440]  has been a fear for the United States for the past 30 years but has not been my
[2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:30.800]  fear is the fact that we can literally destabilize the borders of North Korea
[2:14:30.800 --> 2:14:34.760]  we can do it militarily we can do it economically we can do it politically
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:40.680]  what Trump was doing and what the generals were doing was saying look we're
[2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:44.760]  not going to get into the business of attacking North Korea we're not going to
[2:14:44.760 --> 2:14:50.000]  get into the business of destabilizing your borders but if you don't change your
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:54.320]  behavior we can assure you that we have the willpower to do whatever is
[2:14:54.320 --> 2:15:01.640]  necessary to inculcate and to execute whatever actions we need so in effect
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:07.560]  this whole scenario was never really done for Syria or for the Middle East
[2:15:07.560 --> 2:15:11.560]  we're not interested in the Middle East quite frankly we're pulling away from
[2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:15.240]  the Middle East even though we're sending in some soldiers to finish up the
[2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:20.240]  work and and Raqqa and Mosul but for the most part we're going to be shifting to
[2:15:20.240 --> 2:15:25.200]  the Asia to southern China which is what I wrote about 20 years ago the
[2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:31.280]  Spratly Islands so in some ways David you have to look back at this as a very
[2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:36.840]  clever way of the art of the deal in other words everybody was looking to
[2:15:36.840 --> 2:15:42.360]  Syria where at the same time I was looking at Kim Jong-un and I was looking
[2:15:42.360 --> 2:15:47.560]  at President Ji Ji Pong now President Ji Ji Pong is very smart this is not a
[2:15:47.560 --> 2:15:53.760]  warlord this is a gentleman who lost his father and by humiliation of Mao Zedong
[2:15:53.760 --> 2:15:59.400]  he understands what fighting is he understands what personally being beaten
[2:15:59.400 --> 2:16:05.080]  up means about he understands that we can ruin the Chinese economy at will he
[2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:09.620]  understands that we can destroy their water capacity he understands that we
[2:16:09.620 --> 2:16:15.240]  can destroy the infrastructure but he doesn't want this on the other hand the
[2:16:15.240 --> 2:16:20.400]  Chinese have maintained their Middle Kingdom complex which means we can do
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:26.040]  no wrong in China and you you are the peasants and you are the gaijin or the
[2:16:26.040 --> 2:16:31.280]  foreigners who have to come to us what President Trump did was to turn the
[2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:38.080]  table around psychologically and said you know what now let's negotiate now
[2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:44.240]  let me understand what you understood in terms of my action and he did this in a
[2:16:44.240 --> 2:16:48.960]  scenario which is totally inappropriate for a war scenario and that is a
[2:16:48.960 --> 2:16:56.120]  beautiful banquet with the gorgeous women with wine and all the kuchimans of
[2:16:56.120 --> 2:17:03.360]  of the rich but at the same time the point was made and President Ji Ji
[2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:10.160]  Pong understood it very quickly as did all his generals that this is not a time
[2:17:10.160 --> 2:17:16.040]  to play with this president or this country I understand and I saw reports
[2:17:16.040 --> 2:17:20.320]  where the domestic Chinese press was talking about how the Chinese president
[2:17:20.320 --> 2:17:23.640]  was going to and I forget some Scandinavian country first and talking
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:26.480]  about that and then say oh yeah and then we're also going to the US so they
[2:17:26.480 --> 2:17:29.800]  were downplaying the importance of the US to make themselves look stronger
[2:17:29.800 --> 2:17:34.760]  there's also the issue coming up that we had the Philippine president saying on
[2:17:34.760 --> 2:17:39.040]  our Independence Day I'm gonna go plant the flag on one of the Spratly Islands
[2:17:39.040 --> 2:17:43.280]  to so he got that type of thing there that all the what's going on the South
[2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:48.000]  China Sea but let me ask you this dr. Pertinic we're talking about regime
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:52.200]  change and it seems like Rex Tillerson put that back on the table when he said
[2:17:52.200 --> 2:17:56.400]  steps underway to remove Assad what do you make about that statement that he
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:18:03.000]  has no future in Syria well number one I don't know mr. Tillerson I know he was
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:09.080]  recommended by James Baker and Condoleezza writes I think mr. Tillerson
[2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:13.480]  is smart enough to know that he has never been in the business of regime
[2:18:13.480 --> 2:18:18.520]  change what he has been into is the business of business so I think he
[2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:24.440]  kind of figured out the orchestration of saying that we are in fact you know
[2:18:24.440 --> 2:18:28.440]  really looking as if we're going to change the regime but we're not in the
[2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:33.080]  business of regime change there's no one here in this administration who has
[2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:38.800]  actually had regime change I'm not part of it I you know I've known others who've
[2:18:38.800 --> 2:18:42.960]  been involved in regime change this is not an administration that could
[2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:47.600]  literally go into regime change and regime change does not mean that you can
[2:18:47.600 --> 2:18:51.760]  get into war and get rid of a Bashar Assad it's just not going to happen
[2:18:51.760 --> 2:18:58.200]  number one he controls about 60 to 70 percent of the country he comes from an
[2:18:58.200 --> 2:19:02.880]  area that's called Latakia and if you've been in that area which I have been not
[2:19:02.880 --> 2:19:07.080]  only the women are beautiful but there are signs all over the place which says
[2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:14.400]  do not wear any scarves and so al-awit's a very secular and he will remain there
[2:19:14.400 --> 2:19:21.720]  until there is some kind of tripartite or an agreement between Russia Turkey Iran
[2:19:21.720 --> 2:19:28.920]  and ourselves to literally change the administration in in Syria make it
[2:19:28.920 --> 2:19:34.800]  peaceful as much as we can do reparations and then Turkey despite Erdogan's great
[2:19:34.800 --> 2:19:39.920]  oysters and Dr. Pachinik we have to take a break can you hang on with us and do
[2:19:39.920 --> 2:19:42.600]  another short segment right after the break and we're going to continue to
[2:19:42.600 --> 2:19:47.320]  talk to Dr. Steve Pachinik a man who has decades of experience for the State

[2:24:06.440 --> 2:24:09.920]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we've been talking to
[2:24:09.920 --> 2:24:13.160]  Dr. Steve Pachinnick I want to go right back to him had some very interesting
[2:24:13.160 --> 2:24:18.760]  comments in the last segment essentially pointing out that he saw this as a move
[2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:24.640]  to impress China about the seriousness of North Korean situation as a power play
[2:24:24.640 --> 2:24:28.840]  there that everyone was advised of this attack except for the Chinese and this
[2:24:28.840 --> 2:24:33.800]  was a shock and awe demonstration for the Chinese but I also want to pick up on
[2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:38.080]  something you said Dr. Pachinnick you said that the you've been to Syria and
[2:24:38.080 --> 2:24:43.160]  the area that Assad is from is a very secular area they have signs up for
[2:24:43.160 --> 2:24:46.360]  women not to wear veils and so forth and of course that was one of the things
[2:24:46.360 --> 2:24:50.320]  that Nigel Farage was concerned about he said that we have to understand that we
[2:24:50.320 --> 2:24:55.520]  don't want to strengthen the hand of ISIS that was created for regime change
[2:24:55.520 --> 2:25:01.200]  against a secular regime your comments on that and your comments on what is
[2:25:01.200 --> 2:25:04.680]  happening within the White House and this this one segment that we've got
[2:25:04.680 --> 2:25:09.320]  from you we saw the removal of General Flynn who had been very outspoken about
[2:25:09.320 --> 2:25:13.440]  this creation of ISIS on the part of America's involvement in the creation
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:19.800]  of ISIS and we've seen the demutation of Stephen Bannon in terms of National
[2:25:19.800 --> 2:25:23.400]  Security Council of course they had a meeting yesterday he was not on that it's
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:28.520]  reported that he did attend but weekly standard is bragging about the fact that
[2:25:28.520 --> 2:25:31.920]  it was unanimous that they all wanted to do the Syrian strike so your comments
[2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:37.720]  about you know Syria as well as what you see happening within the Trump White
[2:25:37.720 --> 2:25:42.520]  House is there a move in there yes thank you David number one in Syria there
[2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:46.920]  will be no regime change when we announce a regime change that means we can't do it
[2:25:46.920 --> 2:25:50.760]  when I was involved in a regime change in the Soviet Union they didn't know it
[2:25:50.760 --> 2:25:55.320]  was happening it occurred over Nixon Reagan administration we took them down
[2:25:55.320 --> 2:26:01.080]  very quietly in terms of the White House what's happening is General McMaster
[2:26:01.080 --> 2:26:07.400]  whom actually we I had funded him in the 90s when he did arm care for the Tom
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:12.560]  Clancy series is a very serious scholar warrior and he understood right away
[2:26:12.560 --> 2:26:18.800]  that Steve Bannon was not privy and not really capable of dealing with the
[2:26:18.800 --> 2:26:24.240]  issues of strategy and tactics even though Steve has been in the Navy and I
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:28.760]  have full respect for what he's done the issue of national security was
[2:26:28.760 --> 2:26:34.920]  exceedingly important and had to belong sui generis to him another element that
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:40.560]  make fun of that McMaster did and it was not really covered was that a lady named
[2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:45.160]  McFarland was thrown out as well now I knew about her although I didn't know
[2:26:45.160 --> 2:26:50.040]  her from the Nixon administration she was not a top-notch analyst she was not
[2:26:50.040 --> 2:26:55.480]  that well regarded and McMaster acted accordingly by getting her out and
[2:26:55.480 --> 2:27:00.960]  sending it to Singapore so in effect what McMaster is doing is solidifying his
[2:27:00.960 --> 2:27:05.920]  base and bringing in professional operatives the last person who has to
[2:27:05.920 --> 2:27:11.200]  be taken out is this gentleman named Ezra Kohn Watnick a friend of Jared
[2:27:11.200 --> 2:27:16.040]  Kushner who has no experience whatsoever a Jewish guy who graduated from the
[2:27:16.040 --> 2:27:19.880]  University of Pennsylvania and his head of intelligence that's just not
[2:27:19.880 --> 2:27:25.240]  acceptable I have worked with and against the CIA but I have full respect
[2:27:25.240 --> 2:27:30.360]  for the history of the CIA and our a community of intelligence 17 different
[2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:35.560]  units but this man Kohn has no experience neither does Jared Kushner and
[2:27:35.560 --> 2:27:40.080]  these individuals should not be involved in foreign affairs let alone in
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:45.560]  domestic concerns I know Jared Kushner and his building 6667 he was going
[2:27:45.560 --> 2:27:51.280]  bankrupt so I think this time should be spent on re mortgaging his buildings
[2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:57.000]  and not in the White House that's my opinion however I am in full favor of
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:01.360]  what McMaster did I'm in full favor in the fact that Bannon has to take a
[2:28:01.360 --> 2:28:07.280]  secondary role control his narcissism and he knows that as does Trump and he
[2:28:07.280 --> 2:28:12.480]  will do that but he has to focus in on exactly what is accomplishment so we're
[2:28:12.480 --> 2:28:17.200]  still waiting for the one trillion dollar infrastructure project I was not
[2:28:17.200 --> 2:28:21.800]  impressed by the medical bills that came through I was not impressed with any
[2:28:21.800 --> 2:28:27.000]  of the Republicans including Rand Paul because nobody had read the bill and
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:30.480]  nobody understood what it's really at that that's right I think it would have
[2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:36.000]  been malpractice for the congressman to have voted for that we've seen this
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:41.200]  happen too many times we've seen several thousand pages of legislation sent to
[2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:45.280]  them for an up-or-down vote it's being changed up to the last minute before it's
[2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:48.240]  being presented and so just from that standpoint alone they should have opposed
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:51.880]  this and I guess that's one of the things that concerns us about this strike
[2:28:51.880 --> 2:28:54.640]  in Syria you know you mentioned Elliot Abrams and how they kept him out of the
[2:28:54.640 --> 2:28:58.960]  administration of course he is saying that now we have a real president and
[2:28:58.960 --> 2:29:02.440]  President Trump because he did this and he said this he said he was willing to
[2:29:02.440 --> 2:29:06.720]  act alone without demanding UN Security Council meeting or a congressional vote
[2:29:06.720 --> 2:29:10.120]  and I guess that's one of the things that concerns many of us is the fact that
[2:29:10.120 --> 2:29:14.880]  this was you know if the way that it appears it looks like there was no
[2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:17.800]  evaluation of this I understand what you're saying that it was strictly for
[2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:22.440]  statistical reasons for the Chinese but it's still something that I think needs
[2:29:22.440 --> 2:29:26.040]  to be addressed to people how would you address that to Trump's disgruntled base
[2:29:26.040 --> 2:29:31.240]  and we've got 20 seconds. I'm trying to do it right now through the Alex Jones show what I'm saying is
[2:29:31.240 --> 2:29:38.760]  let's see what happens basically this is not an initiation to war and the reason
[2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:43.520]  it's very simple. I don't care what Elliot Abrams says I know Elliot I stopped him
[2:29:43.520 --> 2:29:47.440]  from coming in I stopped John Bolton from coming in. I wish we had more time I've
[2:29:47.440 --> 2:29:50.400]  got to cut you off there thank you so much Dr. Steve Pachennick we're out of
[2:29:50.400 --> 2:29:56.760]  time thank you. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:58.600 --> 2:30:04.240]  The mainstream media can no longer claim that President Donald Trump is
[2:30:04.240 --> 2:30:11.760]  Putin's puppet. Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield
[2:30:11.760 --> 2:30:19.120]  in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital
[2:30:19.120 --> 2:30:25.120]  national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread
[2:30:25.120 --> 2:30:32.120]  and use of deadly chemical weapons. Satellite pictures have been released of
[2:30:32.120 --> 2:30:37.720]  the major damage to the Syrian airfields. Meanwhile Russia has responded by
[2:30:37.720 --> 2:30:43.680]  diverting warships to protect the Syrian coast and bolster missile defenses
[2:30:43.680 --> 2:30:50.400]  against further US strikes as fear grows that this crisis could escalate into a
[2:30:50.400 --> 2:30:55.760]  major conflict between the United States and Russia and you can learn more

[2:32:08.120 --> 2:32:12.880]  introducing caveman by infowarslife.com. The ultimate and true paleo nutrition
[2:32:12.880 --> 2:32:17.880]  with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom and seven total primal super
[2:32:17.880 --> 2:32:22.680]  foods in a single great tasting formula. Caveman, it's those people living in the
[2:32:22.680 --> 2:32:26.040]  wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior
[2:32:26.040 --> 2:32:30.040]  ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them. Everyone knew
[2:32:30.040 --> 2:32:33.120]  that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for
[2:32:33.120 --> 2:32:37.560]  sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength from the
[2:32:37.560 --> 2:32:41.760]  outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces
[2:32:41.760 --> 2:32:45.880]  the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long
[2:32:45.880 --> 2:32:49.720]  way from the caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[2:32:49.720 --> 2:32:53.560]  to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it. I know
[2:32:53.560 --> 2:32:56.680]  you're gonna want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[2:32:56.680 --> 2:33:24.480]  infowarslife.com today. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight and we're just talking to Dr. Steve Pachennick and we had to go to a
[2:33:24.480 --> 2:33:29.000]  hard break at the bottom of the hour just as he was ready to give us his take on
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:33.920]  Elliott Abrams. I talked about how Elliott Abrams and the neocons were
[2:33:33.920 --> 2:33:38.320]  dancing in the streets after what's happened. We got McCain, Schumer, Pelosi,
[2:33:38.320 --> 2:33:41.640]  all of them so happy and Elliott Abrams was celebrating the fact that this
[2:33:41.640 --> 2:33:46.560]  happened without any consultation with the Congress with you and or anybody
[2:33:46.560 --> 2:33:50.800]  else. Your comments to wrap this up and then we're gonna go to Dr. Jerome
[2:33:50.800 --> 2:33:56.480]  Corsi. Dr. Pachennick. Basically Elliott Abrams and John Bolton are
[2:33:56.480 --> 2:34:00.960]  sycophants. I've known them for four different administrations. They avoided
[2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:05.200]  the draft. They can't serve our military. Elliott Abrams comes from a left
[2:34:05.200 --> 2:34:10.600]  Wintrotsky-eyed family. John Bolton he admitted he didn't want to go into war
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:14.840]  because he might be killed in the rice paddy so I don't take them seriously.
[2:34:14.840 --> 2:34:18.680]  These are the sycophants of the whores of the neocons. They're not relevant.
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:23.440]  Neither is Hillary, neither is any of the Democrats. What is relevant is what
[2:34:23.440 --> 2:34:29.120]  you're beginning to see and not necessarily hear and what Trump does is
[2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:33.120]  to put together the art of the deal. You have to go back to his book to
[2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:37.880]  understand that many things that he's going to do he could not explain it. He
[2:34:37.880 --> 2:34:42.560]  couldn't explain to the public that I'm going to strike Syria in order to
[2:34:42.560 --> 2:34:47.560]  impress China and in order for China to impress North Korea. I don't think most
[2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:51.440]  of the press would understand that. I think your audience would understand it.
[2:34:51.440 --> 2:34:55.320]  I think you understand it. I think Alex Jones would understand it. But if in
[2:34:55.320 --> 2:34:59.600]  any way he was a war hawk, I could assure you I'd be the first one out there
[2:34:59.600 --> 2:35:04.200]  along with Alex along with you and along with the entire base. But at this
[2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:08.960]  particular point we have an axiom in the intelligence community which means
[2:35:08.960 --> 2:35:15.760]  that there are no accidents. When you see President Xi Jinping literally next to
[2:35:15.760 --> 2:35:21.400]  Trump and an airstrike occurs in Syria, it's not relevant to Syria. It's
[2:35:21.400 --> 2:35:26.760]  relevant to that president of China because China is our primary concern for
[2:35:26.760 --> 2:35:31.680]  the next 20 years. The Middle East, we're getting out of the Middle East. Thanks to
[2:35:31.680 --> 2:35:35.320]  the L.A. Abrams and the Hillary Clinton's and the Obama's and the Bush
[2:35:35.320 --> 2:35:40.080]  juniors, they got us into this mess. Trump will try to get us out of the mess, so
[2:35:40.080 --> 2:35:44.320]  will our military, not necessarily our CIA, but our military will get us out of
[2:35:44.320 --> 2:35:49.440]  the mess and shift us to South China Sea. And that's what I'm telling the
[2:35:49.440 --> 2:35:55.040]  audience. If I'm wrong, I will be surprised, but I will say I was wrong. But at
[2:35:55.040 --> 2:35:59.760]  this point I do not think I am wrong. I don't think what Trump did was in any
[2:35:59.760 --> 2:36:06.320]  way an act of war as it was a symbol of a strike and the kabuki of war warning
[2:36:06.320 --> 2:36:11.440]  Asia that this could happen to you if you don't pay attention and you don't
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:16.200]  comply with some of the concerns that we have. North Korea is a far greater
[2:36:16.200 --> 2:36:20.600]  threat today than it was 20 years ago. And I've worked against the North Koreans.
[2:36:20.600 --> 2:36:26.920]  I worked against Kim Jong-un's grandfather, his father, and now him. And if I
[2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:31.600]  were given the full authority to take North Korea part, our military knows
[2:36:31.600 --> 2:36:36.160]  what I was capable of doing. So do the Koreans, so do the Chinese. Actually, when
[2:36:36.160 --> 2:36:40.640]  I went to China a few years ago, they asked me, was I in China to take them
[2:36:40.640 --> 2:36:45.720]  down? I said, no, I'm not in the business right now, regime change. Of course, they
[2:36:45.720 --> 2:36:50.320]  knew that was a lie. I could easily work on the business of taking China down
[2:36:50.320 --> 2:36:55.280]  because there are issues of water, infrastructure, and communism, capitalism,
[2:36:55.280 --> 2:37:00.080]  a whole bunch of conflicting cultural issues which are easy to manipulate in
[2:37:00.080 --> 2:37:05.920]  this modern time. But for the present, pay attention to what is not being said
[2:37:05.920 --> 2:37:11.200]  and what the art of the deal was all about, and that's what Trump is now
[2:37:11.200 --> 2:37:16.240]  about. In terms of the other people in the White House, that's almost
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:20.080]  secondary. That's not relevant. When you hear the noise, that's not where the
[2:37:20.080 --> 2:37:24.600]  bang is. The bang is where you don't hear the noise. I understand. So you see this
[2:37:24.600 --> 2:37:29.360]  as art of the deal, this is a message to China as far as your concern, and a very
[2:37:29.360 --> 2:37:32.680]  interesting perspective. Thank you so much for talking to us, Dr. Steve Pachinic.
[2:37:32.680 --> 2:37:37.120]  And of course, people can find you at StevePachinic.com or also on Twitter at
[2:37:37.120 --> 2:37:40.480]  StevePachinic. Thank you so much for your view. Thank you, David, and thank you for
[2:37:40.480 --> 2:37:46.200]  audience. Thank you. All right, I just got this political cartoon. Alex wanted me
[2:37:46.200 --> 2:37:51.280]  to show this on air, read this to the audience. This is Ben Garrison cartoon, and
[2:37:51.280 --> 2:37:55.600]  he's got Rand Paul on one shoulder and the devil on the other. Of course, the
[2:37:55.600 --> 2:38:01.520]  Rand Paul is an angel and devil is neocons. And Rand Paul is saying to Trump,
[2:38:01.520 --> 2:38:04.600]  don't do it. What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt, a possible
[2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:08.120]  long-term conflict? The Constitution says you need congressional approval on the
[2:38:08.120 --> 2:38:13.040]  other shoulder. We've got the neocon devils whispering into his ear, saying
[2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:17.400]  bomb the blank out of him. Show him how tough you are. War makes us big money.
[2:38:17.400 --> 2:38:21.960]  Bill Crystal, Larry, Lindsey Graham, Hillary, CNN, the deep state will all
[2:38:21.960 --> 2:38:26.840]  love you. So that's the cartoon that we've got right there. I want to do a real
[2:38:26.840 --> 2:38:32.880]  quick review of the specials that we have. I'm going to go to Dr. Jerome
[2:38:32.880 --> 2:38:37.240]  Corsi for his perspective on this. We have our InfoWars newsletter that
[2:38:37.240 --> 2:38:40.560]  you can sign up for free. You can get that at infowars.com forward slash
[2:38:40.560 --> 2:38:43.880]  newsletter. It's a great way for you to get in contact with us because
[2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:50.600]  increasingly we are seeing subtle levers being used to censor the media. And we
[2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:54.600]  don't know when that hammer is going to fall completely, but it is being tried
[2:38:54.600 --> 2:38:58.120]  out. They're continuing down this same path that they were playing with with
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:01.640]  Hillary Clinton. That's what Roger Stone was talking about. We're disappointed
[2:39:01.640 --> 2:39:07.000]  that Trump hasn't moved more quickly, more decisively, to shut down these
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:11.040]  levers of power that are being put in place to shut down the free press.
[2:39:11.040 --> 2:39:17.120]  Because if that goes away, Donald Trump will go away as well as the freedom
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:20.720]  movement. So if you want to get this information directly, you can get this
[2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:23.720]  for free by signing up at our newsletter infowars.com forward slash
[2:39:23.720 --> 2:39:28.240]  newsletter. Also every day we have a special, today's special, is buy one get
[2:39:28.240 --> 2:39:34.080]  one free of bubblegum toothpaste. That's our new super blue fluoride free
[2:39:34.080 --> 2:39:38.640]  toothpaste in the bubblegum flavor. And we've just gotten that back in stock at
[2:39:38.640 --> 2:39:43.560]  infowars.com. And those of you who are subscribers to the newsletter can get
[2:39:43.560 --> 2:39:47.800]  that buy one get one free special. It's a great deal. Every day we have a new
[2:39:47.800 --> 2:39:51.600]  special in this new toothpaste. We sold out very quickly of the original flavor.
[2:39:51.600 --> 2:39:56.240]  This is a sweeter taste. It tastes like bubblegum. We had a lot of people say
[2:39:56.240 --> 2:40:01.320]  we'd like to get something that is a little bit softer for the kids. But it
[2:40:01.320 --> 2:40:07.000]  still has the key ingredients in it like iodine, nano silver, and it does not have
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:14.640]  fluoride. Instead it has good halogens in it. So take a look at that. It's a great,
[2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:17.960]  one of my favorite supplements that we have at infowars.com. And again that is
[2:40:17.960 --> 2:40:23.360]  back in stock. We have iodine rather than the fluoride. And finally caveman is
[2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:28.880]  also now back in stock and it is 33% off. Take a look at that at infowarsstore.com.
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:33.680]  I want to go to our Washington correspondent Dr. Jerome Corsi. Again
[2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:38.200]  you can find him on Twitter at Jerome underscore Corsi. And I wanted to get his
[2:40:38.200 --> 2:40:43.480]  take on what is happening with this strike in Syria as well as his take on
[2:40:43.480 --> 2:40:48.160]  what is happening in the turf war, the civil war, or the regime change in the
[2:40:48.160 --> 2:40:52.280]  White House if you wish to see it that way. What is happening Dr. Corsi in
[2:40:52.280 --> 2:40:57.280]  terms of what's going on the White House and also your take on this latest
[2:40:57.280 --> 2:41:04.280]  strike in Syria? Well I agree with Steve. I think there's a lot going on here.
[2:41:04.280 --> 2:41:09.640]  First of all I don't see that Donald Trump has any enthusiasm to really expand
[2:41:09.640 --> 2:41:13.480]  the ground war in the Middle East and this should not be taken as an
[2:41:13.480 --> 2:41:19.060]  indication that Donald Trump's ready to do a full John McCain and you know go
[2:41:19.060 --> 2:41:25.320]  insane sending troops into the Middle East for no real-stated purpose. There's
[2:41:25.320 --> 2:41:30.320]  several messages. First of all President Trump sent a message to the Democrats
[2:41:30.320 --> 2:41:35.640]  that if they think there's a bromance going on with Putin they better reevaluate
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:40.920]  because Putin's not particularly pleased about this most recent strike.
[2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:47.440]  Secondly yes the timing with China showing up the real concern at the
[2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:54.280]  moment is not Syria as tragic as the chemical attack was and if you do believe
[2:41:54.280 --> 2:41:57.600]  it was from the government I'm not a hundred percent sure yet it was from
[2:41:57.600 --> 2:42:05.080]  the government. The point is you've got a situation where Syria is tragic
[2:42:05.080 --> 2:42:10.880]  but it's not like North Korea which is increasingly representing a real threat
[2:42:10.880 --> 2:42:14.760]  even to the United States developing missiles talking about nuclear weapons.
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:20.240]  I don't see any way we could ignore what's going on in North Korea and with
[2:42:20.240 --> 2:42:25.000]  the president of China meeting with Donald Trump and needing to send a
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:31.560]  message to North Korea and to China that we're serious I think Donald Trump
[2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:37.480]  achieved that you know at the expense of a few cruise missiles being lobbed into
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:43.080]  Syria. That's my basic take on it. Well let me ask you you know what because we
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:47.440]  look at this and I understand exactly what Dr. Pachinic is saying that you
[2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:51.640]  know and to recap what he said he said that everybody was advised of this.
[2:42:51.640 --> 2:42:56.520]  Syria, Russia, our allies as well as our enemies were advised of this except for
[2:42:56.520 --> 2:43:00.840]  the Chinese. They were surprised by that and so he believed that the true target
[2:43:00.840 --> 2:43:05.520]  of this missile strike was the hearts and minds of the Chinese leadership. I
[2:43:05.520 --> 2:43:10.440]  understand that but at the same time as many of us who have supported Donald
[2:43:10.440 --> 2:43:14.640]  Trump and who voted for someone who is going to be a leader who is going to
[2:43:14.640 --> 2:43:18.600]  make America great, who is going to be focused here domestically, we look at
[2:43:18.600 --> 2:43:24.560]  this and it looks like a betrayal on a certain level and I guess that's the
[2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:28.320]  thing that many of us are concerned about. We don't want to see regime change,
[2:43:28.320 --> 2:43:31.800]  we don't want to see false flags being used and it's almost like it's a little
[2:43:31.800 --> 2:43:35.340]  bit too clever by half. It looks a little bit too cunning, a little bit too
[2:43:35.340 --> 2:43:39.960]  scheming, a little bit too Machiavellian like Henry Kissinger type of move.
[2:43:39.960 --> 2:43:46.120]  Well I wouldn't overreact. I mean first of all I gotta understand that Donald
[2:43:46.120 --> 2:43:50.160]  Trump doesn't tend to have a strong military and this is the first way to
[2:43:50.160 --> 2:43:54.200]  make it clear to the world that he's going to have a strong military and he's
[2:43:54.200 --> 2:43:58.200]  going to be willing to use it if it's necessary. I think he takes this
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:44:02.360]  opportunity, it's kind of like negotiating with the unions in
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:06.880]  New York. He might do something with the unions that makes clear that he could
[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:10.480]  come to terms with them or doesn't have to come to terms with them and I've seen
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:15.920]  Donald Trump use tactics at this nature many times. But the point is that if
[2:44:15.920 --> 2:44:19.600]  you're really looking in North Korea, and I think this is aimed at North Korea
[2:44:19.600 --> 2:44:25.000]  more than anything else, that this North Korea has got to understand that their
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  days are numbered if they're going to continue along this this route of being
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:35.680]  reckless and really threatening the peace not only in Japan and that whole
[2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:40.440]  area of the world but also even ultimately to the United States. So
[2:44:40.440 --> 2:44:44.480]  you're going to have a president and Trump was going to be an active form
[2:44:44.480 --> 2:44:50.040]  policy president and he's going to use the military when he feels
[2:44:50.040 --> 2:44:54.320]  it's necessary to use the military. Now I don't see anything that's really
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:45:00.040]  solidly regime change. Yes, there's noise that we've got to change Assad and
[2:45:00.040 --> 2:45:04.640]  Assad's got to move aside and all the rest of that but I don't see that there's
[2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:08.800]  real planning that if Assad doesn't move aside we're going to do anything about
[2:45:08.800 --> 2:45:13.840]  it. Even though Rex Tillerson said steps are underway to remove Assad
[2:45:13.840 --> 2:45:18.240]  you don't think that's really what's what's in line. You agree with Dr. Steve
[2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:24.000]  Pechenik that it's not gonna that's not really what's in view here. I'm not
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:28.880]  taking it seriously at this time. I don't see that there's really any detailed
[2:45:28.880 --> 2:45:35.440]  follow-up planning to get in there and go to war to remove Assad. I don't
[2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:38.080]  think it's that important. So you agree with Dr. Pechenik that this was a
[2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:41.600]  strategic message being sent to China. Let me ask you though about what's going
[2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:46.240]  on in the White House because we've had a competition between different
[2:45:46.240 --> 2:45:49.160]  factions and every White House is gonna have different factions. Donald Trump
[2:45:49.160 --> 2:45:55.280]  invited that by getting different types of people in as into his administration.
[2:45:55.280 --> 2:45:59.680]  But we've now seen Jared Kushner has now gone public that when it came to
[2:45:59.680 --> 2:46:03.120]  Obamacare he brought in Zeke Emanuel who was the architect of Obamacare who had
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:05.880]  argued that we were not going to do repeal and even though repeal had been
[2:46:05.880 --> 2:46:11.240]  what he had run on that was something that was noticeably absent from the Ryan
[2:46:11.240 --> 2:46:17.080]  plan that Roger Stone believes was created by Boehner. Also when we had the
[2:46:17.080 --> 2:46:22.080]  moves within the EPA which were very strong but they carefully avoided
[2:46:22.080 --> 2:46:27.520]  talking about the Paris Climate Treaty which we never ratified with the Senate
[2:46:27.520 --> 2:46:32.920]  but that Barack Obama signed and Kerry signed so they kind of leave that
[2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:35.680]  structure there along with the endangerment statement and then when
[2:46:35.680 --> 2:46:41.040]  we look at TPP and trade Donald Trump got rid of TPP right away but now Gary
[2:46:41.040 --> 2:46:46.600]  Cohen who's aligned with Jared Kushner is pushing back against NAFTA with the
[2:46:46.600 --> 2:46:51.480]  architect of TPP, Quinn. So what is your take on this? Do you believe that there is
[2:46:51.480 --> 2:46:55.600]  an undermining that is going on with the West Wing Democrats as Politico calls
[2:46:55.600 --> 2:47:00.680]  them of this agenda that Donald Trump campaigned on?
[2:47:00.680 --> 2:47:05.880]  Well I think first of all you better understand Donald Trump will change his
[2:47:05.880 --> 2:47:11.120]  in his top staff and it changed it frequently. Very few people stay with
[2:47:11.120 --> 2:47:16.760]  Donald Trump for long periods of time. I mean for instance Michael Cohen is his
[2:47:16.760 --> 2:47:21.320]  long-term lawyer in New York. Michael's very loyal I think Michael's a long-term
[2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:25.880]  keeper. There's very few others that I would necessarily think are in that
[2:47:25.880 --> 2:47:31.240]  category and they'll be changed. Look there were three changes of leadership
[2:47:31.240 --> 2:47:37.040]  Corey Lewandowski in the campaign and Manafort and finally Bannon and
[2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:45.480]  Kellyanne Conway. Prevus I think is at risk because Prevus could not get with
[2:47:45.480 --> 2:47:51.120]  Ryan delivered the votes to pass the you know the whatever you want to call the
[2:47:51.120 --> 2:47:56.000]  Obamacare replacement and Ryan assured the president that he had the votes
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:48:00.640]  Prevus assured he had the votes well that's you know Trump said okay I'll
[2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:04.800]  take your word for it let's see what happens if they didn't deliver now I
[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:09.800]  think that makes Prevus a short-timer and also the other leaks that were
[2:48:09.800 --> 2:48:15.240]  coming out of Prevus's office that Katie Walsh who was fired did not do well for
[2:48:15.240 --> 2:48:19.520]  or Prevus. I think Prevus is on a short leash. Yeah he's very closely tied to Paul
[2:48:19.520 --> 2:48:24.320]  Ryan both of them being from Wisconsin so yeah I would agree with you on that.
[2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:28.120]  What do you think about Bannon's situation there at the moment and
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:31.200]  because we've just seen him removed from the National Security Council this week
[2:48:31.200 --> 2:48:37.240]  he said he's not gonna quit that he likes a gunfight what what are you but
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:40.160]  how do you read this sir? Well I mean first of all I want to get clear that I
[2:48:40.160 --> 2:48:45.040]  truly admire Steve Bannon and have you know through the course of the years
[2:48:45.040 --> 2:48:51.280]  crossed paths with him and I deeply respect Steve Bannon. Steve in some
[2:48:51.280 --> 2:48:56.040]  ways is his own worst enemy he does not he's not the friendliest character in
[2:48:56.040 --> 2:49:01.000]  the world he's not easy to interact with on a personal basis he probably has
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:06.640]  had a few friends in the White House and I'm not sure that his ideological or
[2:49:06.640 --> 2:49:11.360]  policy advice is going to be as important to Trump ruling as it is not
[2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:14.680]  ruling but you gotta remember that Trump's now under pressure that everything
[2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:20.320]  he does the Democrats are being completely acting like bad children and
[2:49:20.320 --> 2:49:24.800]  they're being rebellious and this resistance is really embarrassing
[2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:29.160]  to the to the Democrats but Trump's got a very difficult let's just take
[2:49:29.160 --> 2:49:33.800]  Obamacare for a minute the minute there'd be 20 million people you know who
[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:38.240]  lost insurance you know the Democrats pushing 20 million grandmas off the
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:42.240]  cliff so you know Donald Trump wants to do this he wants to do it in the right
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:48.880]  way now the way it's coming back and the discussion from the Freedom Caucus of
[2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:55.960]  some of these pools for the truly sick being handled a special way that's a
[2:49:55.960 --> 2:50:00.000]  that's an important amendment to legislation and now we're talking about
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:04.600]  getting rid of some of the mandates it's becoming worked around now Trump I
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:08.480]  think thought that was gonna happen in the Senate he's gonna be happy to let
[2:50:08.480 --> 2:50:13.880]  the legislative process have some of that happen now in the House and Trump's
[2:50:13.880 --> 2:50:20.000]  very skillful at this I mean you can't judge every micro step he takes if you'd
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:25.560]  seen Trump negotiate building buildings or working with the banks it often wasn't

[2:54:17.040 --> 2:54:20.760]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show the crew was just reminding me that we've
[2:54:20.760 --> 2:54:25.600]  had all the different people who have sided with what Donald Trump did we had
[2:54:25.600 --> 2:54:32.120]  Hillary and Schumer and we've had McCain and Lindsey Graham we've had ISIS and
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:37.120]  al-Qaeda we've had Erdogan we've had the European Union leaders on the other side
[2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:41.920]  we've had Rand Paul we've had most of the talk show universe that helped to get
[2:54:41.920 --> 2:54:46.960]  Donald Trump and we feel very betrayed by this and then there is one more sign
[2:54:46.960 --> 2:54:51.360]  that we saw and that was the fact we had two hurricanes drop down in Washington
[2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:55.560]  DC yesterday not hurricanes but tornadoes touchdown destroyed some cherry trees as
[2:54:55.560 --> 2:55:00.200]  West pointed out maybe that's a a sign that a displeasure and a little bit of
[2:55:00.200 --> 2:55:04.800]  irony there about lies so I don't know we can read into that what you wish I
[2:55:04.800 --> 2:55:09.720]  want to talk a little bit about the Obamacare issue that Dr. Corsi brought
[2:55:09.720 --> 2:55:13.360]  up at the end of the interview but before we do I just want to point out to

[2:56:31.480 --> 2:56:36.960]  store.com of course he was talking about Obamacare and of course they're
[2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:39.560]  reworking it now and I don't know if this is really going to be a repeal of
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:42.840]  Obamacare which is what we were promised what we voted for or if this is
[2:56:42.840 --> 2:56:48.200]  going to be Obamacare 2.2 you know a slightly revised revision revision of
[2:56:48.200 --> 2:56:51.520]  Obamacare one of the things I think is important to remember is that this is
[2:56:51.520 --> 2:56:54.680]  going to fail as Donald Trump pointed out if it keeps going down this road it
[2:56:54.680 --> 2:57:00.880]  is guaranteed to fail we should call it Venezuela care because that is truly
[2:57:00.880 --> 2:57:06.200]  what it is folks you cannot sustain this and we've seen the cost of insurance
[2:57:06.200 --> 2:57:10.640]  skyrocket for people who are buying it but even the people who are supplying it
[2:57:10.640 --> 2:57:15.840]  can't make this work Knoxville Tennessee may be the first place that Obamacare
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:20.600]  could fail and they're saying that by 2018 Humana is going to pull out of the
[2:57:20.600 --> 2:57:24.240]  exchange that's going to be next year roughly 40,000 people will be without an
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:29.120]  option for a subsidized insurance policy unless another carrier steps in and
[2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:34.400]  that's what's making it fail it's the subsidization okay this will always fail
[2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:39.200]  the only way that you're going to have affordable health care is not with
[2:57:39.200 --> 2:57:43.640]  mandates not with subsidies not with robbing one group of people and
[2:57:43.640 --> 2:57:48.200]  rewarding another not by putting a gun to our head and forcing us to buy a
[2:57:48.200 --> 2:57:52.200]  particular policy from an insurance company but to allow competition and
[2:57:52.200 --> 2:57:57.760]  when we looked at the plan that Donald Trump had on his website it had
[2:57:57.760 --> 2:58:03.160]  competition replacing coercion it had choice that was being offered to people
[2:58:03.160 --> 2:58:07.880]  along with the information that we need in order to make those choices so he was
[2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:11.600]  going to remove the restrictions on competition with insurance companies
[2:58:11.600 --> 2:58:16.120]  across state lines he was going to give us the economic incentives to buy
[2:58:16.120 --> 2:58:19.600]  insurance in terms of being able to deduct it having health savings accounts
[2:58:19.600 --> 2:58:23.400]  if we don't have competition if we don't have the information and the
[2:58:23.400 --> 2:58:28.160]  purchasing power that is what will drive down cost but the mandates will never
[2:58:28.160 --> 2:58:31.160]  drive it down now Paul Joseph Watson is going to be coming up in the fourth
[2:58:31.160 --> 2:58:35.640]  hour he's going to give us his take on what happened yesterday with the attack
[2:58:35.640 --> 2:58:42.040]  in Syria stay with us we'll be right back thank you for listening to GCN

[3:00:00.080 --> 3:00:21.960]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[3:00:21.960 --> 3:00:31.360]  network we're live on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show this April 7th
[3:00:31.360 --> 3:00:36.480]  2017 on a pretty monumental day in terms of news in terms of what happened last
[3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:42.920]  night at 33 after we have Bill Mitchell coming on of course he is widely
[3:00:42.920 --> 3:00:48.040]  recognized as one of the most influential pro-trump people on Twitter of
[3:00:48.040 --> 3:00:52.520]  course he has his own show your voice radio he's generally supportive well
[3:00:52.520 --> 3:00:57.080]  vehemently supportive of this airstrike that happened in Syria last night you've
[3:00:57.080 --> 3:01:01.560]  seen my tweets about it I've criticized it you've heard Alex's opinion about it
[3:01:01.560 --> 3:01:04.880]  you've heard David Knight's opinion about it we're gonna have a little debate at
[3:01:04.880 --> 3:01:09.840]  33 past the hour we're gonna have an open dialogue and that's what's important
[3:01:09.840 --> 3:01:14.840]  about this we got rinsed either way we were gonna get rinsed either way we
[3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:18.720]  support the airstrike people say we're hypocrites we oppose the same thing when
[3:01:18.720 --> 3:01:24.280]  Obama tried to do it back in 2013 we oppose the airstrike then suddenly we're
[3:01:24.280 --> 3:01:28.080]  betraying Trump we're gonna get rinsed either way and in fact if you look at the
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:34.280]  drudge poll I think he had a poll if his readership supported or didn't support
[3:01:34.280 --> 3:01:40.920]  the airstrike the current results show 65% support so 20% don't support the
[3:01:40.920 --> 3:01:45.360]  airstrike I had a poll on my Twitter account which you know I've got many of
[3:01:45.360 --> 3:01:51.120]  the same much of the same audience as Trump as a drudge sorry and it was the
[3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:55.960]  opposite almost it was a significant majority opposed the airstrike compared
[3:01:55.960 --> 3:02:02.480]  to those who supported it so this has created huge division of course one of
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:07.080]  the issues with it is you look at the people who actually do support this
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:12.560]  airstrike in the public eye and it doesn't make for very pretty reading I'll
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:17.280]  list them off here we go Hillary Clinton supports this Chuck Schumer Lindsay Graham
[3:02:17.280 --> 3:02:24.200]  John McCain Nancy Pelosi Angela Merkel supports this the entire mainstream
[3:02:24.200 --> 3:02:29.360]  media supports this Brian Williams supports this and as you've probably
[3:02:29.360 --> 3:02:36.000]  heard he got up on NBC News and said that it was beautiful the beautiful airstrikes
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:42.640]  he waxed poetic about it you have neocons Bill Crystal supporting this you
[3:02:42.640 --> 3:02:48.800]  have never Trump is supporting this you have ISIS itself supporting this airstrike
[3:02:48.800 --> 3:02:53.880]  you have Al Qaeda you have those jihadist rebel groups all supporting this
[3:02:53.880 --> 3:03:00.440]  airstrike that's not great company to keep is it and then you look at the
[3:03:00.440 --> 3:03:05.080]  people who have come out vocally vehemently Trump supporters who have
[3:03:05.080 --> 3:03:08.760]  come out and oppose this you're talking about Rand Paul you're talking about
[3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:12.200]  Ann Coulter you're talking about Michael Savage you're talking about Marine
[3:03:12.200 --> 3:03:17.640]  Le Pen you're talking about Nigel Farage okay I'm coming down on the side of
[3:03:17.640 --> 3:03:22.000]  those people right now and I'll get on to tell you why in the next segment of
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:24.880]  the show but we're gonna have Bill Mitchell because he's coming at it from
[3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:29.160]  the opposite angle he supports this airstrike he thinks it's a strategic
[3:03:29.160 --> 3:03:34.920]  move that it won't lead to were a wider scale confrontation as Russia now
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:39.240]  moves warships into that very region from where they launched the cruise
[3:03:39.240 --> 3:03:43.320]  missiles so we're gonna get into it more we're also gonna get into what's
[3:03:43.320 --> 3:03:47.720]  happening in Sweden forget about last night in Sweden what's happening right
[3:03:47.720 --> 3:03:55.320]  now in Sweden the most open tolerant liberal pro-refugee pro-islam friendly
[3:03:55.320 --> 3:04:02.120]  country in the entire West and it still gets attacked by Islamic terrorists we
[3:04:02.120 --> 3:04:05.920]  don't know the death toll at this point and initially they said it was three it
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:12.320]  went up to five now it's down to one but over a dozen people injured again what
[3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:16.840]  looks like a jihadist who is they've just arrested someone the last we checked
[3:04:16.840 --> 3:04:22.840]  but again driving a truck into a crowd full of shoppers Trump warned about what
[3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:27.400]  was happening in Sweden with a complete lack of integration they accepted at
[3:04:27.400 --> 3:04:34.040]  least a hundred and fifty ISIS fighters who returned from Syria they tried to
[3:04:34.040 --> 3:04:39.280]  reintegrate them into Swedish society and this is what happens of course they've
[3:04:39.280 --> 3:04:43.440]  been having huge problems anyway but we're continuing to monitor that there
[3:04:43.440 --> 3:04:47.760]  was a manhunt at one point they're now saying that they have captured a suspect
[3:04:47.760 --> 3:04:53.040]  so we will stay on top of that and we will be back in the next segment with my
[3:04:53.040 --> 3:04:58.160]  take on the airstrike in Syria this is the Alex Jones show live info wars
[3:04:58.160 --> 3:05:03.840]  dot com the mainstream media can no longer claim that president Donald Trump
[3:05:03.840 --> 3:05:11.560]  is Putin's puppet tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield
[3:05:11.560 --> 3:05:18.960]  in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched it is in this vital
[3:05:18.960 --> 3:05:24.480]  national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the
[3:05:24.480 --> 3:05:31.280]  spread and use of deadly chemical weapons satellite pictures have been

[3:08:29.880 --> 3:08:36.040]  moving warships into the region from where those missiles were launched and I
[3:08:36.040 --> 3:08:39.200]  do have a video about this coming up which is going to be uploaded after the

[3:09:05.720 --> 3:09:11.160]  Facebook live so be sure that's a tune in to that for the latest also the latest
[3:09:11.160 --> 3:09:15.640]  on what's happening in Stockholm where we've had yet another truck attack where
[3:09:15.640 --> 3:09:20.960]  the BBC came out and said this was the headline lorry rams people so once again
[3:09:20.960 --> 3:09:25.000]  it's those damn lorries becoming sentient and killing people autonomously
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:29.920]  nothing to do with Islam nothing to do with the ideology of the individual in
[3:09:29.920 --> 3:09:34.360]  the lorry and against Sweden the most liberal progressive refugee friendly
[3:09:34.360 --> 3:09:39.720]  Islam friendly country in the entire West still gets attacked by Islamic
[3:09:39.720 --> 3:09:45.040]  terrorists but the mayor of Paris says that the Eiffel Tower will go black in
[3:09:45.040 --> 3:09:49.840]  homage to Stockholm they might as well leave the frigging lights off
[3:09:49.840 --> 3:09:55.280]  permanently because this is now happening almost every week but you know if
[3:09:55.280 --> 3:09:58.600]  Russians dying a terror attack it doesn't matter nobody cares about them the
[3:09:58.600 --> 3:10:02.840]  Eiffel Tower stays fully lit we're gonna get into the airstrike now though
[3:10:02.840 --> 3:10:08.640]  because this is what I tweeted back on March the 10th nearly a month ago I
[3:10:08.640 --> 3:10:13.680]  tweeted this if there's one area Trump will mess up it will be in foreign
[3:10:13.680 --> 3:10:20.440]  policy half of his advisors are CFR globalist that swamp was not drained why
[3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:25.080]  did I tweet that because I was gonna make a video on how Trump was being
[3:10:25.080 --> 3:10:30.160]  sabotaged by the deep state I went on to the official White House website went
[3:10:30.160 --> 3:10:35.600]  through his list of foreign policy advisors and it was a litany of CFR
[3:10:35.600 --> 3:10:39.400]  members it was more than half of his foreign policy advisors are members of
[3:10:39.400 --> 3:10:43.560]  the council on foreign relations which of course has nothing to do with America
[3:10:43.560 --> 3:10:49.240]  first and is all about globalism is all about regime change in Syria which they
[3:10:49.240 --> 3:10:54.480]  pushed from the very beginning they openly said we need to arm al Qaeda to
[3:10:54.480 --> 3:10:59.960]  overthrow Assad those are the people advising Donald Trump now it was over
[3:10:59.960 --> 3:11:04.440]  half now you would expect there to be some hangovers you would expect there
[3:11:04.440 --> 3:11:08.720]  to be some people affiliated or even members of the CFR who don't really
[3:11:08.720 --> 3:11:13.760]  believe in its globalist ethos but it was over half and that was over a month
[3:11:13.760 --> 3:11:18.160]  ago it's probably even more now so this is what's taking place
[3:11:18.160 --> 3:11:23.640]  Trump is being manipulated by the swamp he's being enveloped by the swamp and
[3:11:23.640 --> 3:11:29.240]  you saw it by what happened last night and let's go through it again look at
[3:11:29.240 --> 3:11:33.560]  the people supporting this airstrike Hillary Clinton Chuck Schumer Lindsey
[3:11:33.560 --> 3:11:38.440]  Graham John McCain Nancy Pelosi Angela Merkel the entire mainstream media that
[3:11:38.440 --> 3:11:43.800]  previously hated Trump Rachel Maddow was up there smacking her lips last night
[3:11:43.800 --> 3:11:48.160]  Brian Williams talking about the beautiful airstrikes you have neocons you
[3:11:48.160 --> 3:11:53.200]  have never trumpers you have ISIS themselves celebrating this airstrike
[3:11:53.200 --> 3:11:58.440]  so I'm sorry I can't come down on the side of those people on the flip side
[3:11:58.440 --> 3:12:03.040]  you have the likes of ankle to Michael Savage Mike Cernovich Stefan Molyneux
[3:12:03.040 --> 3:12:08.320]  Marine Le Pen Nigel Farage Rand Paul Laura Ingram usually influential
[3:12:08.320 --> 3:12:13.480]  people which with huge audiences they all oppose this airstrike does that mean
[3:12:13.480 --> 3:12:17.600]  we've abandoned Trump and we're turning on Trump as the mainstream media claims
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:24.480]  today no there is room for dialogue and criticism we're not Obama cult members
[3:12:24.480 --> 3:12:29.160]  who have to support every single thing he does like the left did for eight years
[3:12:29.160 --> 3:12:34.680]  there's still room for criticism there's still room for dialogue and people
[3:12:34.680 --> 3:12:41.400]  have argued Trump is playing 4d chess he's attacking Russia's ally as a show
[3:12:41.400 --> 3:12:46.520]  of strength in one sense to humiliate Obama with his red line rhetoric and in
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:51.120]  another sense to dismantle the narrative which is you know fueled these
[3:12:51.120 --> 3:12:54.840]  investigations that are still ongoing that he's conspiring with the Russians
[3:12:54.840 --> 3:13:01.160]  that he's in bed with Vladimir Putin but they're still attacking him for that
[3:13:01.160 --> 3:13:06.640]  they're still out today those very same people saying why did you warn Putin an
[3:13:06.640 --> 3:13:10.880]  hour in advance this is just more devastating proof that Trump is in bed
[3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:17.120]  with the Russians so that shouldn't be a reason to airstrike foreign countries
[3:13:17.120 --> 3:13:22.320]  to prove the mainstream media wrong to prove these Russian obsessives wrong
[3:13:22.320 --> 3:13:27.120]  you're never going to please those people never and why would you give them
[3:13:27.120 --> 3:13:32.080]  the respect in the first place to pander to them why would you do that so
[3:13:32.080 --> 3:13:36.240]  people say it's for that reason here's the reality people can theorize about it
[3:13:36.240 --> 3:13:41.480]  all along here's the reality that base that got bombed last night in Idlib is
[3:13:41.480 --> 3:13:47.960]  situated near a town populated by Christians which is under constant
[3:13:47.960 --> 3:13:54.360]  assault from jihadists from ISIS from al-Qaeda okay so that Christian town
[3:13:54.360 --> 3:13:59.640]  beautiful Christian town it's called Marday in northern Hamar mainly
[3:13:59.640 --> 3:14:05.080]  Christian population beautiful town Orthodox Roman churches constantly
[3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:12.760]  under attack every day from jihadists defended from this airbase about an
[3:14:12.760 --> 3:14:18.240]  hour away that was bombed last night so those people those Christians in that
[3:14:18.240 --> 3:14:22.160]  predominantly Christian town beautiful town under constant attack every day
[3:14:22.160 --> 3:14:27.800]  from ISIS have now been left virtually defenseless because of this bombing
[3:14:27.800 --> 3:14:32.200]  because they bombed the aircraft that were providing air cover defense for
[3:14:32.200 --> 3:14:37.680]  them they've wiped out the Syrian army in that region at least partly so it
[3:14:37.680 --> 3:14:42.880]  makes it all the more likely that this town full of Christians will be overrun
[3:14:42.880 --> 3:14:50.120]  by jihadists so people theorizing about you know Trump did this to dismantle the
[3:14:50.120 --> 3:14:53.680]  mainstream media narrative that he loves the Russians that's that's the
[3:14:53.680 --> 3:14:58.680]  practical reality those Christians are now under threat of being enslaved by
[3:14:58.680 --> 3:15:03.640]  ISIS because they're no longer being defended by the Syrian army in that
[3:15:03.640 --> 3:15:07.760]  region or at least their defense will be crippled so it's more likely that that
[3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:15.080]  town full of Christians is going to be overrun by jihadists so the airstrike
[3:15:15.080 --> 3:15:21.240]  directly helped jihadists this is not good okay this is the reality and we
[3:15:21.240 --> 3:15:27.280]  need to talk about it once again we will get rinsed either way I've been
[3:15:27.280 --> 3:15:31.880]  completely rinsed for coming out and criticizing this you can go on in four
[3:15:31.880 --> 3:15:35.240]  wars you can look at it from the alternative perspective which we've
[3:15:35.240 --> 3:15:38.720]  given and which we will give at the bottom of the hour with Bill Mitchell
[3:15:38.720 --> 3:15:43.520]  and people are saying how could you support this you're complete hypocrites
[3:15:43.520 --> 3:15:47.920]  you were against this when Obama was about to do exactly the same thing a
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:51.680]  chemical weapons attack nobody really knew who was responsible there was no
[3:15:51.680 --> 3:15:56.040]  proper investigation he was about to conduct a airstrikes on Syria you
[3:15:56.040 --> 3:16:00.360]  opposed it why are you supporting it now that's what we're getting when we
[3:16:00.360 --> 3:16:04.280]  put out the alternative alternative perspective so either way we're gonna
[3:16:04.280 --> 3:16:09.600]  get absolutely rinsed so I'm just coming at it from the practical reality of
[3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:15.720]  what's happening on the ground now again this chemical weapons attack which
[3:16:15.720 --> 3:16:20.600]  occurred in Idlib province was absolutely dreadful people died children
[3:16:20.600 --> 3:16:25.560]  died by questioning who was behind it we're not disregarding the scale of the
[3:16:25.560 --> 3:16:30.560]  horror it was horrific people died we need to properly investigate it find out
[3:16:30.560 --> 3:16:35.880]  who was behind it especially given the fact that the previous major chemical
[3:16:35.880 --> 3:16:41.760]  weapons attack that Obama tried to use to conduct airstrikes on Syria the
[3:16:41.760 --> 3:16:46.040]  rebels were responsible for that attack all the evidence suggests it you had
[3:16:46.040 --> 3:16:50.400]  delponte from the UN come out and say that it was probably the rebels you had
[3:16:50.400 --> 3:16:55.200]  Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Seymour Hirsch his sources told him it was
[3:16:55.200 --> 3:17:00.520]  likely the rebels it was not the Syrian government I mean even Justin frigging
[3:17:00.520 --> 3:17:06.240]  true dough who is a globalist even he called for an investigation to this
[3:17:06.240 --> 3:17:11.520]  latest chemical weapons attack so we need to find out who is responsible for
[3:17:11.520 --> 3:17:19.440]  atrocities before firing off 59 cruise missiles and destroying an air base which
[3:17:19.440 --> 3:17:25.960]  is protecting Christians in a nearby town from being attacked by ISIS that's
[3:17:25.960 --> 3:17:31.680]  my take on it okay so undoubtedly the chemical weapons attack was far worse
[3:17:31.680 --> 3:17:36.400]  than the airstrike in terms of human tragedy you've heard the narrative oh
[3:17:36.400 --> 3:17:43.400]  it was just a limited strike on a on an airbase barely anyone died well the the
[3:17:43.400 --> 3:17:47.160]  Syrian army soldiers were Christians from what I've been told and they've got
[3:17:47.160 --> 3:17:51.240]  families and that's a tragedy but if you want to compare it to the chemical
[3:17:51.240 --> 3:17:55.320]  weapons attack then obviously that was far worse it was horrific but again
[3:17:55.320 --> 3:18:01.680]  there's been no impartial investigation of it whatsoever we were told that Assad
[3:18:01.680 --> 3:18:05.400]  gave up his chemical weapons apparently that now that's not the case we can
[3:18:05.400 --> 3:18:10.200]  disregard that and the central question is this why would Assad launch a
[3:18:10.200 --> 3:18:15.640]  completely self-defeating chemical weapons attack less than a week after
[3:18:15.640 --> 3:18:21.880]  Tillerson said that raging change in Syria is no longer on the agenda that's
[3:18:21.880 --> 3:18:26.680]  what he said he said that Assad was a part of Syria's future it was a definite
[3:18:26.680 --> 3:18:32.600]  shift in US policy from what had gone before ISIS is on the run they were
[3:18:32.600 --> 3:18:39.600]  about to be defeated in all these major cities it makes absolutely no sense
[3:18:39.600 --> 3:18:44.760]  Assad would not benefit from a self-defeating chemical weapons attack
[3:18:44.760 --> 3:18:50.800]  days after he's been given assurances that the US is not interested in regime
[3:18:50.800 --> 3:18:57.320]  change makes no sense whatsoever of course now Tillerson is back on the case
[3:18:57.320 --> 3:19:02.880]  we'll get to the clip after the break now he's saying that regime change is
[3:19:02.880 --> 3:19:07.400]  back on the table he's saying they're gonna get rid of ISIS first but then
[3:19:07.400 --> 3:19:10.920]  they're gonna topple Assad which of course means that ISIS will just pour
[3:19:10.920 --> 3:19:15.280]  back into the country and take it over and take over the region just as
[3:19:15.280 --> 3:19:22.680]  happened in Libya that is a terrible idea you can't destabilize secular
[3:19:22.680 --> 3:19:27.520]  government and overthrow them without that vacuum being created without it
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:33.200]  being filled by the very worst kind of people we've seen it again and again and
[3:19:33.200 --> 3:19:38.600]  again so people are saying you know this is limited a strike that's it that's the
[3:19:38.600 --> 3:19:41.680]  end of it it's not the end of it Nikki Haley's already come out and said this
[3:19:41.680 --> 3:19:45.520]  is just the first step Tillerson says it's about regime change we're going
[3:19:45.520 --> 3:19:51.000]  down this rabbit hole once again and we know where it leads we'll be back on
[3:19:51.000 --> 3:19:56.920]  the Alex Jones show live breaking news at info wars dot-com

[3:24:23.920 --> 3:24:28.320]  mainstream media they're trying to attack us on every level now with the
[3:24:28.320 --> 3:24:32.960]  YouTube scandal they're demonetizing our channels which again takes a huge
[3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:39.360]  chunk out of our income which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting
[3:24:39.360 --> 3:24:44.560]  the products because that's how we stay afloat they can't get to us that way
[3:24:44.560 --> 3:24:49.400]  they can't pressure you to not buy the products they don't have that power and
[3:24:49.400 --> 3:24:53.520]  that's why you're the key to this entire operation we have super blue fluoride

[3:26:08.160 --> 3:26:13.540]  support us by getting the products at infowarstore.com so we got Bill
[3:26:13.540 --> 3:26:18.040]  Mitchell coming up to talk about this again the dialogue is open I think we
[3:26:18.040 --> 3:26:21.840]  can still reach out to Trump given that all these prominent people have so
[3:26:21.840 --> 3:26:27.480]  vehemently come out against this we can still influence him you would hope but
[3:26:27.480 --> 3:26:33.440]  he is being surrounded by neocons and deep status who are all absolutely
[3:26:33.440 --> 3:26:37.680]  delighted about what happened last night which is why I'm not comfortable about
[3:26:37.680 --> 3:26:43.200]  it for one of many reasons we have that Rex Tillerson clip here is Secretary of
[3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:48.760]  State Rex Tillerson saying on record that this is about regime change it's
[3:26:48.760 --> 3:26:53.280]  not just a limited airstrike this is about regime change let's go to that clip
[3:26:53.280 --> 3:26:58.800]  well obviously the events that have occurred in Syria with the chemical
[3:26:58.800 --> 3:27:06.280]  weapons attack here in the past day have just I think horrified all of us and
[3:27:06.280 --> 3:27:12.440]  brought to the front pages and to our television screens as well the tragedy
[3:27:12.440 --> 3:27:20.200]  that is part of the Syrian conflict there is no doubt in our minds and the
[3:27:20.200 --> 3:27:25.600]  information we have supports that Syria the Syria regime and the leadership of
[3:27:25.600 --> 3:27:31.440]  President Bashar al-Assad are responsible for this attack and I think
[3:27:31.440 --> 3:27:35.800]  further it is very important that the Russian government consider carefully
[3:27:35.800 --> 3:27:41.040]  their continued support for the Assad regime Assad's role in the future is
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:46.360]  uncertain clearly and with the acts that he has taken it would seem that there
[3:27:46.360 --> 3:27:54.280]  would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people so they have no role for
[3:27:54.280 --> 3:27:59.320]  Assad to govern the Syrian people he said in another news conference that they
[3:27:59.320 --> 3:28:04.840]  want him to step down he's not going to step down he's had the Syrian army
[3:28:04.840 --> 3:28:11.400]  defending him for six years under sustained intense international pressure
[3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:17.360]  under constant jihadist attacks with them being funneled the weapons through the
[3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:22.960]  rat line through Hillary Clinton okay he's not gonna just quietly politely
[3:28:22.960 --> 3:28:28.960]  step down after six years of civil war by America just saying oh could you please
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:33.840]  step aside not gonna happen not gonna happen the only way he's gonna step down
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:39.160]  is if they start obliterating Damascus is that what Trump supporters want is
[3:28:39.160 --> 3:28:44.720]  that what they signed up for when they voted for President Trump again they
[3:28:44.720 --> 3:28:49.400]  bombed this airbase which is protecting a Christian town which is now gonna be
[3:28:49.400 --> 3:28:55.200]  besieged by ISIS they're gonna be enslaved they're gonna be killed because
[3:28:55.200 --> 3:29:00.040]  of this because the defences have been obliterated is that what we want so again
[3:29:00.040 --> 3:29:05.280]  all these theories swirling around about why he did it it's not a one-off thing
[3:29:05.280 --> 3:29:11.040]  Nikki Haley's in front of the UN today saying this is the first step Tillerson
[3:29:11.040 --> 3:29:17.520]  says it's all about regime change this is not a one-off thing we didn't sign up
[3:29:17.520 --> 3:29:23.200]  for this if you look at the actual polls it shows about 65% on my poll oppose
[3:29:23.200 --> 3:29:27.360]  regime change even some of those people will have support the initial airstrike
[3:29:27.360 --> 3:29:34.240]  but we have to be clear this is not a one-step thing this is dangerous look at
[3:29:34.240 --> 3:29:39.040]  what happened in Libya look what happened already in Syria more terrorism more
[3:29:39.040 --> 3:29:44.400]  refugees more global instability happens every single time let's not go down
[3:29:44.400 --> 3:29:48.720]  that road again we'll be back on the Alex Jones show live stay tuned we're on
[3:29:48.720 --> 3:29:56.920]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:29:56.920 --> 3:30:04.240]  the mainstream media can no longer claim that President Donald Trump is
[3:30:04.240 --> 3:30:11.680]  Putin's puppet tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield
[3:30:11.680 --> 3:30:19.040]  in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched it is in this vital
[3:30:19.040 --> 3:30:25.040]  national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread
[3:30:25.040 --> 3:30:31.760]  and use of deadly chemical weapons satellite pictures have been released
[3:30:31.760 --> 3:30:37.400]  of the major damage to the Syrian airfields meanwhile Russia has responded
[3:30:37.400 --> 3:30:43.040]  by diverting warships to protect the Syrian coast and bolster missile
[3:30:43.040 --> 3:30:49.080]  defenses against further US strikes as fear grows that this crisis could
[3:30:49.080 --> 3:30:55.160]  escalate into a major conflict between the United States and Russia and you

[3:33:20.160 --> 3:33:25.400]  we live on the Alex Jones show and on the line we have Bill Mitchell of your
[3:33:25.400 --> 3:33:30.080]  voice radio dot com and he's also filming the show for his podcast bill
[3:33:30.080 --> 3:33:37.400]  welcome to the show hey how are you good to see you good now the Trump base is
[3:33:37.400 --> 3:33:41.400]  split I think we can at least agree on that to some extent you have a drudge
[3:33:41.400 --> 3:33:46.280]  report poll which shows I think is about 65% in support of these airstrikes I've
[3:33:46.280 --> 3:33:51.880]  done polls which show you know 10% more oppose it this has completely split the
[3:33:51.880 --> 3:33:55.640]  base we've got very prominent people coming out opposing this airstrike
[3:33:55.640 --> 3:33:59.880]  talking about the likes of ankle to Michael Savage Stefan Molyneux Marine
[3:33:59.880 --> 3:34:04.240]  Le Pen Nigel Farage Rand Paul Lord Laurel Ingram they all oppose this
[3:34:04.240 --> 3:34:09.760]  airstrike you've supported it on Twitter I've been rinsed for criticizing it I'm
[3:34:09.760 --> 3:34:13.720]  sure you've been rinsed for supporting it there are no real winners here but the
[3:34:13.720 --> 3:34:17.800]  question is this okay I'm gonna read you to Trump tweets which he tweeted during
[3:34:17.800 --> 3:34:22.440]  the campaign this is from Trump don't attack Syria an attack that will bring
[3:34:22.440 --> 3:34:27.560]  nothing but trouble for the US focus on making our country strong and great again
[3:34:27.560 --> 3:34:31.600]  he also tweeted crooked Hillary Clinton foreign interventions
[3:34:31.600 --> 3:34:37.120]  unleashed ISIS in Syria Iraq and Libya she is reckless and dangerous why is
[3:34:37.120 --> 3:34:43.160]  Trump now following the exact policy peace war to avoid yeah I think a real
[3:34:43.160 --> 3:34:47.440]  danger that we get into when we judge someone's current actions by their
[3:34:47.440 --> 3:34:53.600]  former tweets is that they have new information that they've attained on
[3:34:53.600 --> 3:34:56.960]  their current actions that they didn't have when they made that tweet and this
[3:34:56.960 --> 3:35:00.280]  is one of the things I like about Donald Trump he's not a classic conservative
[3:35:00.280 --> 3:35:05.440]  ideologue he's a resultist he's a CEO type mentality and you don't want to see
[3:35:05.440 --> 3:35:09.600]  the old that goes in making decisions based on pure ideology you want to see
[3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:13.800]  you that goes in and makes decisions on the latest most up-to-date best
[3:35:13.800 --> 3:35:18.640]  information and my feeling is that once he got together with his top advisors
[3:35:18.640 --> 3:35:23.560]  with Matt Mattis and all the rest of his security counsel and he looked at what
[3:35:23.560 --> 3:35:29.000]  was going on here he decided you know what we need to act here and to me the
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:34.680]  upside and the benefits of this are so tremendous that it outweighs by far any
[3:35:34.680 --> 3:35:40.520]  downside risks but I mean let's talk about the lead up to this of course we
[3:35:40.520 --> 3:35:44.960]  had the chemical weapons attack the central question is this why would Assad
[3:35:44.960 --> 3:35:50.120]  launch a chemical weapons attack one week after Tillerson said regime change
[3:35:50.120 --> 3:35:55.200]  was up was off the menu we had ISIS on the run we had a sad moving closer to
[3:35:55.200 --> 3:36:00.000]  victory what possible benefit could it have been to him to launch this chemical
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:05.360]  weapons attack especially given in the past back in 2013 severe questions over
[3:36:05.360 --> 3:36:09.720]  that many learned scholarly people Seymour Hirsch included said the rebels
[3:36:09.720 --> 3:36:13.880]  were likely behind that attack there's been no investigation how do we know
[3:36:13.880 --> 3:36:18.200]  Assad was behind the attack in the first place given that it makes absolutely no
[3:36:18.200 --> 3:36:24.160]  sense in terms of motive yeah well you know I mean how do I how do I test the
[3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:28.760]  motives of a madman and the guy clearly has been beating the hell out of his
[3:36:28.760 --> 3:36:32.680]  people out of his country for a long time now and I believe that he has used
[3:36:32.680 --> 3:36:36.840]  chemical weapons in the past doesn't he doesn't have a history of that well so
[3:36:36.840 --> 3:36:40.720]  the ISIS and the rebels so how do we know without having a proper investigation
[3:36:40.720 --> 3:36:45.040]  I mean even Trudeau called for an investigation into it so how do I mean
[3:36:45.040 --> 3:36:47.840]  they might have intelligence that we don't but I think we should be sure
[3:36:47.840 --> 3:36:53.280]  about who's behind a atrocity before launching 59 cruise missiles into a
[3:36:53.280 --> 3:36:57.120]  country I can pretty much guarantee you they've got better intelligence than we
[3:36:57.120 --> 3:37:01.480]  do pretty much guarantee I'm sure they had assets on the ground they were able
[3:37:01.480 --> 3:37:06.200]  to evaluate this and regardless here's what's happened Donald Trump did this
[3:37:06.200 --> 3:37:10.160]  prior to this world leaders were very sketchy about Donald Trump there was a
[3:37:10.160 --> 3:37:13.720]  real question would he lead you know this was a business man with no
[3:37:13.720 --> 3:37:17.520]  government experience no military experience when push came to shove would
[3:37:17.520 --> 3:37:21.680]  he take bold leadership he talks to the game would he follow through and in this
[3:37:21.680 --> 3:37:25.640]  case he did he mentioned that he might do this during the day he did it that
[3:37:25.640 --> 3:37:30.600]  night when Chinese President Xi was actually sitting there with him this
[3:37:30.600 --> 3:37:36.160]  all went on okay this was a very bold step when Donald Trump did this he once
[3:37:36.160 --> 3:37:40.680]  again became the leader of the free world Donald Trump said I will make
[3:37:40.680 --> 3:37:44.560]  America great again part of that is America becoming the free world again
[3:37:44.560 --> 3:37:48.320]  and that's what happened last night and all you have to do is look at the
[3:37:48.320 --> 3:37:53.240]  reaction of the other leaders of the free world without question praise
[3:37:53.240 --> 3:37:58.120]  laudatory praise of what Donald Trump did about the decisiveness about the
[3:37:58.120 --> 3:38:02.560]  effectiveness about the limitation of what this was I mean you have the Prime
[3:38:02.560 --> 3:38:08.240]  Minister of Britain you had the UK Defense Secretary you have the German
[3:38:08.240 --> 3:38:12.880]  minister you have Italy's Prime Minister you have Japan you have Israel I
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:17.720]  mean all these countries have come out in praise of what Donald Trump did in
[3:38:17.720 --> 3:38:22.960]  addition I see that point but the problem is the UK government was behind
[3:38:22.960 --> 3:38:26.800]  the destabilization of Syria in the first place it's the same government
[3:38:26.800 --> 3:38:30.880]  that support of the jihadist rebels that led to the problem in the first place I
[3:38:30.880 --> 3:38:35.120]  mean why should we be pandering for the support of Angela Merkel I mean why is
[3:38:35.120 --> 3:38:39.360]  that suddenly important given that Trump breaches to even shake her hand like
[3:38:39.360 --> 3:38:43.600]  three weeks ago is that here's my question no bill and I mean this is an
[3:38:43.600 --> 3:38:47.800]  open dialogue right I mean we've both been rinsed for having opinions on this
[3:38:47.800 --> 3:38:51.400]  we still have an open dialogue we're not gonna jump down each other's throats
[3:38:51.400 --> 3:38:58.360]  but here's my concern that airbase that got bombed was defending a town full of
[3:38:58.360 --> 3:39:04.520]  Christians an hour away that is under constant daily bombardment artillery
[3:39:04.520 --> 3:39:09.520]  strikes from ISIS from jihadist from Syrian rebels those people have now
[3:39:09.520 --> 3:39:13.960]  been left completely exposed because most of the defense has been removed
[3:39:13.960 --> 3:39:19.160]  those aircraft were defending that town beautiful ancient town full of
[3:39:19.160 --> 3:39:24.280]  Orthodox Roman churches again Christian population now they've been left
[3:39:24.280 --> 3:39:28.520]  completely defenseless because this protection has been removed so do you
[3:39:28.520 --> 3:39:32.080]  understand the concerns of those who include many you know active duty
[3:39:32.080 --> 3:39:35.680]  military veterans who were concerned about it back in 2013 that we're now
[3:39:35.680 --> 3:39:41.320]  acting in support of jihadists and ISIS given that they're now celebrating this
[3:39:41.320 --> 3:39:46.480]  yeah well I can understand their concerns I disagree with their concerns
[3:39:46.480 --> 3:39:51.960]  here's the problem okay Donald Trump came in and when these when these gas
[3:39:51.960 --> 3:39:56.160]  attacks were reported and apparently our intelligence supported this happened
[3:39:56.160 --> 3:40:00.280]  okay when these gas attacks happen and Assad was responsible according to our
[3:40:00.280 --> 3:40:04.160]  intelligence Donald Trump could either respond or not respond if he didn't
[3:40:04.160 --> 3:40:07.000]  respond at all that would be unacceptable as president of the United States so if
[3:40:07.000 --> 3:40:11.200]  he responded and condemned them then he had to act if he did not act then he
[3:40:11.200 --> 3:40:17.240]  became Obama 2.0 okay so we had to act in a surgical limited way and they
[3:40:17.240 --> 3:40:21.920]  followed the intelligence and they did it they acted the upside of this is
[3:40:21.920 --> 3:40:26.440]  tremendous you know the entire here's the thing the entire rush a gate thing
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:31.240]  just died it's over it's over because what were a person the world would say
[3:40:31.240 --> 3:40:35.640]  that Donald Trump is acting as the puppet of Putin now that Donald Trump is
[3:40:35.640 --> 3:40:39.920]  basically stuck his finger in Putin's eye in Syria that's over that's over with
[3:40:39.920 --> 3:40:44.080]  Bill why should we need to pander to those people they're not satisfied
[3:40:44.080 --> 3:40:49.240]  they're still out saying why did Trump give Putin an hour's advance warning that
[3:40:49.240 --> 3:40:52.880]  must mean he's still in bed with Putin I don't think those people are gonna be
[3:40:52.880 --> 3:40:56.680]  satisfied by anything do you think this is gonna completely deflate the Russia
[3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:01.440]  investigation and that that's now gonna slowly dissipate it was deflating
[3:41:01.440 --> 3:41:04.760]  anyway but yeah it's gonna deflate I'm telling you what based on what I'm
[3:41:04.760 --> 3:41:09.000]  seeing on Twitter you know you said that we're split on this I disagree with that
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:15.640]  statement I think this is maybe 20% against 80% for okay I see very positive
[3:41:15.640 --> 3:41:19.280]  support for Trump on this I see the people that were initially very against
[3:41:19.280 --> 3:41:23.520]  the saying I'm gonna abandon Trump on this I'm off the Trump train on this I
[3:41:23.520 --> 3:41:26.500]  see that fading away you know here's the thing people got to understand the
[3:41:26.500 --> 3:41:29.520]  Trump train has got many cars on it if you don't like the drapes on one car
[3:41:29.520 --> 3:41:33.080]  move to another car okay because if you say that you're gonna abandon Trump on
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:36.640]  this then what are you gonna do for the next four years I mean what about tax
[3:41:36.640 --> 3:41:39.840]  reform what about health care reform what about the wall what about
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:43.680]  immigration reform what about jobs these are other cars if you believe in those
[3:41:43.680 --> 3:41:46.880]  but stay on the Trump thing don't abandon Trump there's nothing wrong with
[3:41:46.880 --> 3:41:49.960]  disagreeing with Trump on this he likes that feedback that's important to him
[3:41:49.960 --> 3:41:53.400]  that's part of his strategy but in my case I think this is a great move I
[3:41:53.400 --> 3:41:56.640]  think history will look back at this as a turning point in the Middle East in a
[3:41:56.640 --> 3:42:00.720]  brilliant move we can micromanage it if you want I disagree with that statement
[3:42:00.720 --> 3:42:04.400]  I think on the broad picture this was a fantastic move for Donald Trump and
[3:42:04.400 --> 3:42:09.720]  history will prove that out there was a big emotional reaction last night when
[3:42:09.720 --> 3:42:13.880]  it happened and there was some flouncing I agree it did get quite emotional at
[3:42:13.880 --> 3:42:18.320]  points but the fact is that many prominent people have come out and
[3:42:18.320 --> 3:42:22.840]  criticize this as I had Rand Paul Nigel Farage Marine Le Pen you know if you
[3:42:22.840 --> 3:42:26.120]  look at the people who support this it's I don't think it's really good company
[3:42:26.120 --> 3:42:30.440]  to have Hillary Clinton Chuck Schumer Lindsey Graham John McCain Nancy Pelosi
[3:42:30.440 --> 3:42:33.880]  Angela Merkel Brian Williams the mainstream media you know you know
[3:42:33.880 --> 3:42:39.040]  neocons never Trumpers they all endorse and support this do you feel
[3:42:39.040 --> 3:42:43.400]  comfortable being in the same camp as them now well let me turn the question
[3:42:43.400 --> 3:42:46.480]  around you know who came out against us rush in a round you feel comfortable
[3:42:46.480 --> 3:42:50.400]  being in their camp they're against it that's your company rushing around
[3:42:50.400 --> 3:42:54.080]  they're against this attack I mean we can we can turn that both ways but here's
[3:42:54.080 --> 3:42:59.400]  the thing Donald Trump crossed created bridges with this okay he created he took
[3:42:59.400 --> 3:43:05.160]  a leadership role in the world at no point will our enemies say this guy is
[3:43:05.160 --> 3:43:09.200]  not a guy who acts and this was a strong message with the president of China
[3:43:09.200 --> 3:43:12.400]  sitting there with him at dinner this was a strong message in North Korea that
[3:43:12.400 --> 3:43:15.640]  I am serious I mean it if you guys don't cut it out and we'll come after you
[3:43:15.640 --> 3:43:20.040]  because here's the thing if we let Assad and Syria get away with this okay and
[3:43:20.040 --> 3:43:23.720]  then what happens next okay and then we let North Korea get away with something
[3:43:23.720 --> 3:43:27.240]  and then what happens next and then what happens next and people say oh Donald
[3:43:27.240 --> 3:43:30.960]  Trump promised that he wouldn't get involved in wars okay Donald Trump was
[3:43:30.960 --> 3:43:35.560]  preventing war by doing this and people say well Syria is not our concern
[3:43:35.560 --> 3:43:39.560]  Syria is a long way away this is United States of America Donald Trump promised
[3:43:39.560 --> 3:43:43.320]  to protect the United States of America but here's the problem with the refugee
[3:43:43.320 --> 3:43:46.480]  crisis and with ISIS telling us that they're gonna be using the refugee
[3:43:46.480 --> 3:43:51.920]  crisis to infiltrate the world with ISIS terrorists this has become a
[3:43:51.920 --> 3:43:56.120]  worldwide problem this become our problem I tell you what a big freckle on
[3:43:56.120 --> 3:44:00.320]  your I mean ISIS is celebrating this and now they're gonna destroy a Christian
[3:44:00.320 --> 3:44:04.360]  town because of it we're helping ISIS here I think you're looking too small
[3:44:04.360 --> 3:44:06.720]  picture on that I think you're looking too small picture on that you're not
[3:44:06.720 --> 3:44:10.120]  looking at the big perspective on this here's the thing if you have a big
[3:44:10.120 --> 3:44:13.280]  freckle on your face that's a cosmetic problem but if that freckle becomes a
[3:44:13.280 --> 3:44:17.920]  melanoma then that threatens your whole body and right now Syria has become a
[3:44:17.920 --> 3:44:21.640]  melanoma on the world because of the refugee crisis they are infecting the
[3:44:21.640 --> 3:44:25.160]  entire world this has got to be dealt with and it's gotta be dealt with
[3:44:25.160 --> 3:44:28.640]  strongly I think I have a feeling this Christian town is gonna be just fine
[3:44:28.640 --> 3:44:32.520]  it's gonna be taken care of by Donald Trump I'm not worried about that one of
[3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:37.840]  thing I want to say this entire thing to me is a precursor to the idea of safe
[3:44:37.840 --> 3:44:42.360]  zones imagine this scenario Donald Trump has said another campaign promised
[3:44:42.360 --> 3:44:46.920]  Trump made was safe zones in Syria okay let's say that Donald Trump ignores
[3:44:46.920 --> 3:44:52.160]  this attack goes in and creates safe zones in Syria's puts American forces
[3:44:52.160 --> 3:44:57.680]  on the ground and then Assad attacks those with chemical weapons and then he
[3:44:57.680 --> 3:45:01.040]  gets crucified because it's like wait a minute you knew he had what chemical
[3:45:01.040 --> 3:45:04.600]  weapons you did nothing you created safe zones you put everybody in the same
[3:45:04.600 --> 3:45:08.720]  group you put American forces on the ground and they're all dead now Donald
[3:45:08.720 --> 3:45:12.560]  Trump would be dead as a president he would be overframed as a president he
[3:45:12.560 --> 3:45:16.160]  took preemptive action before that happens I guarantee you this is the
[3:45:16.160 --> 3:45:19.400]  lead up to creating safe zones it is gonna save millions and millions of lives
[3:45:19.400 --> 3:45:23.000]  and stop the refugee crisis that's what he wants to do I don't think he wants to
[3:45:23.000 --> 3:45:26.960]  I hope you're right I hope you're right Bill the other thing that I'd say is you
[3:45:26.960 --> 3:45:29.800]  know a lot of people think this is a limited strike this is a one-off deal
[3:45:29.800 --> 3:45:33.040]  this is the end of it Nikki Haley is already in front of the UN saying this
[3:45:33.040 --> 3:45:37.520]  is just the start Rex Tillerson after a week ago saying that Assad was part of
[3:45:37.520 --> 3:45:42.320]  Syria's future is now saying that it's about regime change he thinks that Assad
[3:45:42.320 --> 3:45:47.800]  is gonna step down and just vacate his position having been in an intense
[3:45:47.800 --> 3:45:51.560]  civil war and under intense international pressure for six years I
[3:45:51.560 --> 3:45:55.560]  mean it's just not gonna happen the only way they're gonna get Assad to step
[3:45:55.560 --> 3:46:00.920]  down is by obliterating the hell out of Damascus so how can people keep saying
[3:46:00.920 --> 3:46:06.840]  this is just a limited strike when Rex Tillerson the US Secretary of State has
[3:46:06.840 --> 3:46:11.080]  said on multiple occasions that they won regime change which is exactly what
[3:46:11.080 --> 3:46:15.840]  Hillary wanted yeah well we'll have to see how that turns out if I if I had the
[3:46:15.840 --> 3:46:20.280]  ability to read the future at that level I just go by a lottery ticket and
[3:46:20.280 --> 3:46:23.800]  retire so I don't know what's gonna happen on that but I think that what
[3:46:23.800 --> 3:46:27.400]  Donald Trump did now in the here and now was a great strategic move we'll have
[3:46:27.400 --> 3:46:32.280]  to see what happens going forward as far as regime change I don't know I don't
[3:46:32.280 --> 3:46:35.040]  know we had a bad experience with that in Iraq I don't know if this would be
[3:46:35.040 --> 3:46:38.480]  different I know that the world governments are much more behind us
[3:46:38.480 --> 3:46:42.200]  right now than they were ever behind Bush on Iraq I mean Iraq had to go with
[3:46:42.200 --> 3:46:45.760]  secondary powers in quite often cases to go after Iraq I mean we have the major
[3:46:45.760 --> 3:46:49.520]  powers of the world and people say oh well we've got Britain behind us and
[3:46:49.520 --> 3:46:53.640]  we've got France and we've got all these countries behind us I mean isn't that
[3:46:53.640 --> 3:46:57.680]  kind of like NATO okay NATO is on our side on this these are the other major
[3:46:57.680 --> 3:47:01.000]  powers in the world I don't have a big problem with that and the fact I mean
[3:47:01.000 --> 3:47:05.000]  Bill everyone was behind the attack on Libya and the regime change in Libya and
[3:47:05.000 --> 3:47:09.480]  that's what started the migrant crisis and led to the rise of ISIS so why
[3:47:09.480 --> 3:47:12.560]  should we be encouraging more regime change when it's proven to be a
[3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:17.120]  disaster over and over again what's the alternative what's the other which
[3:47:17.120 --> 3:47:20.560]  what should Trump have done you still have the safe zones in Syria and you
[3:47:20.560 --> 3:47:24.400]  could still have a secular government that isn't doesn't leave a vacuum to be
[3:47:24.400 --> 3:47:29.120]  overrun by ISIS and jihadists which is what happened in Libya is what happened
[3:47:29.120 --> 3:47:33.800]  in Iraq I mean that's what always happens surely we'd learn that by now if
[3:47:33.800 --> 3:47:37.800]  you create safe zones in Syria and then once they were there Assad attacked with
[3:47:37.800 --> 3:47:42.440]  chemical weapons then where does that leave Trump oh you know you mean you
[3:47:42.440 --> 3:47:46.640]  created why would it be in his interest to do that if we were helping Assad fight
[3:47:46.640 --> 3:47:50.560]  ISIS which is what you know we were doing to a certain extent Russia to a
[3:47:50.560 --> 3:47:55.760]  greater extent but I mean how would it be in Assad's benefit to attack safe
[3:47:55.760 --> 3:48:00.840]  zones I mean that would automatically lead to a global movement behind his
[3:48:00.840 --> 3:48:07.360]  regime change whereas now people don't support that 60% I did a poll 60% don't
[3:48:07.360 --> 3:48:11.480]  support regime change even amongst many Trump supporters who did support this
[3:48:11.480 --> 3:48:15.680]  airstrike so you know if Trump came out and said right we're gonna do regime
[3:48:15.680 --> 3:48:21.240]  change I think he would lose more than 50% of his base yeah I don't think so
[3:48:21.240 --> 3:48:27.080]  here's the thing you're you're pulling I can do a poll right now on you know do
[3:48:27.080 --> 3:48:30.920]  you do you support the airstrike that jumped in and I could probably get about
[3:48:30.920 --> 3:48:34.840]  90% support because you know I'm preaching to my own choir okay and if you
[3:48:34.840 --> 3:48:37.920]  do a poll yeah you're gonna be unless there was some sort of scientific poll
[3:48:37.920 --> 3:48:41.960]  that you did you're gonna get a bunch people that tend to agree with you you
[3:48:41.960 --> 3:48:44.680]  know that's just the way these that's why I don't do a lot of Twitter polls I do
[3:48:44.680 --> 3:48:48.280]  Twitter polls to make a point not to actually get any analysis out of it so
[3:48:48.280 --> 3:48:52.640]  and also one of the things that you can tell from these drudge polls the drudge
[3:48:52.640 --> 3:48:56.460]  poll came out and it says 60% people supported you know drudge polls and
[3:48:56.460 --> 3:48:59.800]  online polls like that they measure enthusiasm more than they measure
[3:48:59.800 --> 3:49:05.080]  actual numbers so there seems to be more enthusiasm behind Trump doing this
[3:49:05.080 --> 3:49:08.720]  and they like the idea a lot of people like the idea this was such a not
[3:49:08.720 --> 3:49:13.520]  Obama thing to do Obama drew lines in the sand you know Donald Trump said I'm
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:17.360]  all out of shock I don't have time for that I'm going boom that's it so we'll
[3:49:17.360 --> 3:49:21.000]  see how this turns out I support it you're gonna bomb I did it in Libya though
[3:49:21.000 --> 3:49:25.320]  and didn't turn out so great that's what start the whole crisis in the first
[3:49:25.320 --> 3:49:30.960]  place yeah well all I can say is I'm behind this I think it was a good move
[3:49:30.960 --> 3:49:35.240]  I see a lot of upside I know Scott Adams was a wrote an article and he listed
[3:49:35.240 --> 3:49:39.480]  six seven different reasons why this is a fantastic move by Trump I don't want to
[3:49:39.480 --> 3:49:43.400]  go through all those cuz I know that we got a relatively short show here but so
[3:49:43.400 --> 3:49:48.520]  but here's the thing is the Paul you and I are on the same team we've got the
[3:49:48.520 --> 3:49:51.600]  same long-term goal we want all the same things but we disagree on some of the
[3:49:51.600 --> 3:49:55.080]  details this is normal you know people are like oh are you and Paul Joseph gonna
[3:49:55.080 --> 3:50:00.320]  fight no not at all because you said we want the same thing we just disagree on
[3:50:00.320 --> 3:50:05.360]  this particular detail exactly the point I made Bill was we're not like Obama cult
[3:50:05.360 --> 3:50:09.760]  members who have to blindly follow and support is every single policy there's
[3:50:09.760 --> 3:50:14.480]  still room for dialogue and disagreement or you would hope there would be yeah I
[3:50:14.480 --> 3:50:19.320]  just see the thing is I that I'm looking you tend to be you're looking at more of
[3:50:19.320 --> 3:50:23.080]  the end of the details of the town this this sort of thing I'm looking at the
[3:50:23.080 --> 3:50:28.080]  broad strategic benefit of it to the world as a whole and I think this was a
[3:50:28.080 --> 3:50:32.280]  great move I think it was a strong move I think you need to be done I think it
[3:50:32.280 --> 3:50:36.240]  established Donald Trump is the leader of the free world this is something this
[3:50:36.240 --> 3:50:41.280]  is very parallel to what we saw during the primary season during the primary
[3:50:41.280 --> 3:50:44.720]  season we had all these debates during the debates what was every debate about
[3:50:44.720 --> 3:50:47.800]  Donald Trump said this what do you think about that Donald Trump said that
[3:50:47.800 --> 3:50:51.600]  what do you think about this okay all that all the time it was never Ted Cruz
[3:50:51.600 --> 3:50:54.720]  said this what do you think or Jeff Bush said this what do you think Donald Trump
[3:50:54.720 --> 3:50:58.840]  led with boldness on every issue every debate was about Donald Trump and what
[3:50:58.840 --> 3:51:04.320]  Donald Trump did with this move was he made world peace about Donald Trump about
[3:51:04.320 --> 3:51:09.320]  Donald Trump's leadership and if there's gonna be something else even bigger that
[3:51:09.320 --> 3:51:12.960]  comes up in the future when the other world leaders have to decide do we need
[3:51:12.960 --> 3:51:16.760]  to get behind this guy do we need to do a coalition with this guy they can say
[3:51:16.760 --> 3:51:20.040]  to themselves you know what he said he'd do something and he did it we know
[3:51:20.040 --> 3:51:24.240]  these are guys who follow through you know we got Alex Jones on the line
[3:51:24.240 --> 3:51:28.200]  we've skipped the break we're gonna get Alex's take Alex you're on the air go
[3:51:28.200 --> 3:51:34.040]  ahead I'm crazy it's just a wild I'm here listening to you guys and I really
[3:51:34.040 --> 3:51:36.440]  agree with Bill but also agree with you and that's why I called in and then
[3:51:36.440 --> 3:51:39.040]  right as I was sitting there on hold I heard Bill making the point hey we're
[3:51:39.040 --> 3:51:42.560]  all on the same team here this isn't some liberal conservative debate this is
[3:51:42.560 --> 3:51:46.080]  just Americana Patriots and British Patriots and patriots all over the
[3:51:46.080 --> 3:51:50.520]  world who just want to prosper this good free market system and yes you can see
[3:51:50.520 --> 3:51:54.240]  him going back on some promises here but the world has changed and the larger
[3:51:54.240 --> 3:52:00.440]  issue is Bill's right but Paul's right as well the main reason that Trump did
[3:52:00.440 --> 3:52:04.080]  this was to impress the Communist Chinese dictator that he made wait an
[3:52:04.080 --> 3:52:07.000]  hour while this was starting and he did this because the world is so much
[3:52:07.000 --> 3:52:11.000]  danger with China fleshing its muscles and literally already stealing 90% of
[3:52:11.000 --> 3:52:15.400]  the South China Sea when historically they've had about 20% and North Korea
[3:52:15.400 --> 3:52:18.440]  threatening and being belligerent they're letting them know this is serious
[3:52:18.440 --> 3:52:22.720]  also Trump knows they were hitting him hard with this fake Russian era if it
[3:52:22.720 --> 3:52:25.720]  was just starting to deflate but they didn't care they were moving forward as
[3:52:25.720 --> 3:52:29.960]  a distraction him doing this absolutely sends that message that no I'm not a
[3:52:29.960 --> 3:52:33.320]  Russian puppet plus let's go back Paul you're making great points when you sit
[3:52:33.320 --> 3:52:36.160]  there and say well listen they're now saying Assad stepped down when eight
[3:52:36.160 --> 3:52:39.040]  days ago they were saying maybe you could say well here's the deal the
[3:52:39.040 --> 3:52:43.080]  agreement was made with the military the US military the Russians in Assad four
[3:52:43.080 --> 3:52:46.920]  years ago they block Obama and the globalist move with Saudi Arabia to
[3:52:46.920 --> 3:52:49.920]  overthrow that country and basically merge it with Europe and then flood
[3:52:49.920 --> 3:52:56.400]  Turkey with the globalist Muslim colonization plan of the globalist and
[3:52:56.400 --> 3:53:02.400]  so Trump basically Trump basically absolutely had to do this or they were
[3:53:02.400 --> 3:53:07.800]  gonna start sabotaging him making look weak and I came out last night and
[3:53:07.800 --> 3:53:11.040]  basically laid all this laid all this out sorry somebody's calling me on call
[3:53:11.040 --> 3:53:15.840]  waiting over and over again but you know what what this comes down to is the
[3:53:15.840 --> 3:53:21.880]  world's waking up and as long as Trump continues to kick al-Qaeda and ISIS out
[3:53:21.880 --> 3:53:25.640]  of there and as long as they drive them out and destroy them and then in this
[3:53:25.640 --> 3:53:30.240]  a Muslim civil war between Shiites and Sunnis it'll be a good thing then they
[3:53:30.240 --> 3:53:34.440]  can hold elections there in Syria he is though they kick ISIS and al-Qaeda slash
[3:53:34.440 --> 3:53:40.240]  al-Nusra also in group out and then you know go in there and basically create
[3:53:40.240 --> 3:53:43.480]  some new globalist state or put some other Islamic group in I'm gonna have a
[3:53:43.480 --> 3:53:47.920]  very very serious big problem with it but he inherited Obama's war he inherited
[3:53:47.920 --> 3:53:51.760]  Obama's crisis and then now this crisis was going to spin out of control it
[3:53:51.760 --> 3:53:56.640]  already has now that Turkey has said they're gonna flood Europe more and and
[3:53:56.640 --> 3:53:59.960]  their guns basically merging with the caliphate and all the rest of it we
[3:53:59.960 --> 3:54:04.080]  basically strategically for Europe and the United States have to cut off Syria
[3:54:04.080 --> 3:54:07.600]  and try to stabilize it even if that means breaking into three pieces and I
[3:54:07.600 --> 3:54:10.880]  get it I don't want nation-building I don't want America to be an empire if
[3:54:10.880 --> 3:54:13.880]  Trump wasn't getting three trillion dollars in stock market 300 billion in
[3:54:13.880 --> 3:54:18.640]  new jobs and building a wall and getting out of the TPP and cutting half the UN's
[3:54:18.640 --> 3:54:22.760]  funding I'd say he's a damn globalist but no he's actually stabilizing America
[3:54:22.760 --> 3:54:26.840]  stabilizing the world because America was in the imperial role and then trying
[3:54:26.840 --> 3:54:30.640]  to basically form alliances that aren't forced and then has us basically
[3:54:30.640 --> 3:54:34.680]  beginning to pull back as we rebuild our infrastructure but if we go to war in
[3:54:34.680 --> 3:54:38.320]  North Korea or with China because they don't respect us that's gonna sabotage
[3:54:38.320 --> 3:54:41.360]  that whole thing I'm gonna get off my phone break it up gentlemen but it's a
[3:54:41.360 --> 3:54:45.240]  great job both of you are making absolutely salient points and as you
[3:54:45.240 --> 3:54:48.600]  said time will tell but the globalists want to sabotage Trump they're
[3:54:48.600 --> 3:54:52.080]  signaling he's done a good job now because he's only acting like he's
[3:54:52.080 --> 3:54:55.920]  agreeing with her overall larger-scale program but that analogy about the train
[3:54:55.920 --> 3:54:59.240]  and different boxcars and different cabooses and different things is
[3:54:59.240 --> 3:55:02.760]  absolutely right you want your taxes done you want your guns left alone you
[3:55:02.760 --> 3:55:06.440]  want Christians not being harassed by the IRS all of that if he gets his agenda
[3:55:06.440 --> 3:55:09.720]  through he's proving he'll do great job guys and I want everybody have a great
[3:55:09.720 --> 3:55:15.840]  weekend thank you Paul for hosting thanks Alex yeah there's a lot of hysteria in
[3:55:15.840 --> 3:55:20.360]  the media right now Bill about oh you've you've turned on Trump because you
[3:55:20.360 --> 3:55:24.600]  disagree with this well now as we've said there's room to criticize Trump on
[3:55:24.600 --> 3:55:29.680]  certain agenda issues within the whole pan of you know his policy agenda that
[3:55:29.680 --> 3:55:33.680]  doesn't mean we're stabbing him in the back I mean that tells you more about
[3:55:33.680 --> 3:55:36.720]  the media in the left doesn't it that they think if you disagree with the
[3:55:36.720 --> 3:55:40.800]  president on one thing that must mean you're abandoning him entirely again
[3:55:40.800 --> 3:55:45.240]  because we're not a sheep like cult that just follows everything Trump does we
[3:55:45.240 --> 3:55:49.440]  challenge him we have dialogue right right exactly you know this whole thing
[3:55:49.440 --> 3:55:54.040]  reminds me of when he brought in Romney to interviews for Secretary of State we
[3:55:54.040 --> 3:55:58.960]  had actually a lot of the same people that were in major meltdown mode major
[3:55:58.960 --> 3:56:03.600]  freakout mode that you know if Trump does this then he's a band and it's always
[3:56:03.600 --> 3:56:06.400]  gone back on every campaign promise and I was basically saying now don't worry
[3:56:06.400 --> 3:56:11.000]  about it's gonna all work out you know Romney doesn't meet the mold of what
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:15.760]  Trump is gonna go so he's just he's just exposing Romney to some voter opinion
[3:56:15.760 --> 3:56:22.240]  to weaken him and to marginalize him just as I thought that Trump let Ryan
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:25.920]  run with Ryan care to marginalize him but that's another another topic all
[3:56:25.920 --> 3:56:30.000]  together I mean it's true that you know and cool to completely freaked out about
[3:56:30.000 --> 3:56:33.400]  the Romney thing there was a lot of flouncing there was a lot of flouncing
[3:56:33.400 --> 3:56:38.080]  last night and passions were running high and that's okay we can disagree with
[3:56:38.080 --> 3:56:42.240]  each other and still support the wider agenda it all works out you know things
[3:56:42.240 --> 3:56:46.160]  are said in the things are said in the heat of the moment that sometimes we
[3:56:46.160 --> 3:56:50.120]  change our mind on and here's the thing and this is what I've always said I was
[3:56:50.120 --> 3:56:54.480]  in I was in executive recruiting for 30 years and sales for 30 years and I said
[3:56:54.480 --> 3:56:59.240]  there's only two reasons why somebody says no you know if they really don't
[3:56:59.240 --> 3:57:03.080]  want it or they just don't have enough information to say yes and I think a lot
[3:57:03.080 --> 3:57:07.840]  of people that were saying no completely to Trump last night were mainly because
[3:57:07.840 --> 3:57:10.960]  they just didn't have enough information yet to say yes and it was just an
[3:57:10.960 --> 3:57:17.240]  initial reaction and that's okay you know we are a vibrant dynamic energetic
[3:57:17.240 --> 3:57:21.440]  emotional group but you know what at the end of the day we come together and we
[3:57:21.440 --> 3:57:25.520]  get the job done and that's my message to everybody today is you know give this
[3:57:25.520 --> 3:57:32.360]  some time let the strategy work itself out in my mind this was not an end game
[3:57:32.360 --> 3:57:35.600]  for Trump this was a leverage move for Trump they've asked Trump before what's
[3:57:35.600 --> 3:57:38.720]  your position on this and he said I don't know I don't have any leverage on that
[3:57:38.720 --> 3:57:42.240]  I don't have a position Donald Trump is always looking to build leverage and I
[3:57:42.240 --> 3:57:44.840]  tell you let me throw one more thing out there one of things you can tell by
[3:57:44.840 --> 3:57:47.720]  Donald Trump is he never makes a dramatic move until he has a great day
[3:57:47.720 --> 3:57:50.680]  when he has a great day when you have some big news day then he makes a
[3:57:50.680 --> 3:57:55.080]  dramatic move what happened yesterday he got Gorsuch approved right that said
[3:57:55.080 --> 3:57:59.560]  he could go ahead with this move the reason being is if he had done this
[3:57:59.560 --> 3:58:03.280]  right after Ryan care failed the entire media everybody would say he's trying to
[3:58:03.280 --> 3:58:07.280]  cover and distract a Ryan care but now that he did on the day that he's had a
[3:58:07.280 --> 3:58:11.560]  big victory nobody's saying he's trying to distract so all right we're gonna have to
[3:58:11.560 --> 3:58:16.320]  leave it there bill we got about 20 seconds left your voice radio calm the
[3:58:16.320 --> 3:58:20.640]  debate will continue as you said bill we will have to wait and see with
