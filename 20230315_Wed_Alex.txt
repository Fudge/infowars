[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:16.000 --> 00:36.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47.000 --> 00:58.000]  Weeks before the Silicon Valley bank collapse, several executives sold off large shares of stock, while mainstream media tells its audience to invest in them.
[00:58.000 --> 01:12.000]  On March 9, the day before the collapse, Israel's two largest banks pulled up to $1 billion out of SVB, while Peter Thiele's founders fund withdrew millions and advised their clients to do the same.
[01:12.000 --> 01:18.000]  The next day, there was a run on the bank and Silicon Valley bank collapsed.
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  Is this evidence of a controlled demolition or a hasty one?
[01:22.000 --> 01:34.000]  The day before the collapse, a U.S. judge ordered J.P. Morgan Chase to turn over documents in a lawsuit accusing them of aiding in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.
[01:34.000 --> 01:56.000]  The team behind this lawsuit was the same team who successfully exposed the involvement of Deutsche Bank, and they subpoenaed several other banks they believe were involved in sex trafficking, including Silicon Valley Bank and Bank Lumi, the Israeli bank that drained $1 billion out of SVB the day before it collapsed.
[01:56.000 --> 02:11.000]  Whatever the reason, the U.S. government's response threatens to collapse the world economy. The FDIC ensures up to $250,000 for each depositor, but now they are going to cover all depositor losses.
[02:11.000 --> 02:23.000]  And they don't have enough to cover the $175 billion of SVB losses, let alone the trillions of dollars to be lost on the near horizon as banks across the world begin to break.
[02:23.000 --> 02:34.000]  The systemic risk among GSIBs, global systemically important banks, is that they are so deeply connected that when one falls, they will all follow.
[02:34.000 --> 02:42.000]  Much of the world's economy is already collapsing due to the actions of the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve banking system.
[02:42.000 --> 02:56.000]  And much of the world has been preparing for the end of the U.S. dollar as a world reserve currency. After all the smaller banks die, the people will be left with the central bank, and their solution is the CBDC.
[02:56.000 --> 03:07.000]  CBDC stands for Central Bank Digital Currency. With CBDC, there are no more options. Everyone's account is run directly through the central bank system.
[03:07.000 --> 03:15.000]  As the financial system gets more controlling and more invasive, it's a little bit like bringing up a corral around us.
[03:15.000 --> 03:24.000]  And CBDC's central bank digital currencies and vaccine passports or digital IDs are sort of the last shutting of the gate.
[03:24.000 --> 03:31.000]  It's hard for many people to imagine the risks here because we're so used to living with financial transaction freedom.
[03:31.000 --> 03:42.000]  And we don't understand that when this gate closes on us, we literally will be sitting in a system where the central banks believe that our assets belong to them,
[03:42.000 --> 03:49.000]  and they can dictate where we can spend money and what we can spend money on. If you don't behave, you can have your money turned off.
[03:49.000 --> 03:59.000]  There are 12 Federal Reserve banks which are located in cities being considered for the 15-minute city model of the World Economic Forum.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  This is where it's all headed, and there isn't much pushback in the federal government.
[04:03.000 --> 04:11.000]  Utah Senator Mike Lee introduced the No CBDC Act last September, which will likely go nowhere.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  But we the people have much more sway over our local governments.
[04:16.000 --> 04:24.000]  An Oklahoma House committee unanimously passed a bill to protect Oklahomans from being forced to adopt a CBDC.
[04:24.000 --> 04:33.000]  It's time for we the people to unite with our neighbors and local communities and prepare to liberate ourselves from the central bank system.
[04:33.000 --> 04:46.000]  Recall our corrupt county officials and start looking into local barter and trade systems because central bank digital currency is coming at us quickly and it equals financial enslavement.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:49.000 --> 04:58.000]  It's the World Government, ladies and gentlemen. It's the New World Order. It's here. Share this video. It's at Infowars.com.
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  It's insane. We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and does such great things for the body.
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils. It is just dynamite.
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.000]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at Infowars.com.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  Dr. Jones Naturals Turmeric Toothpaste.
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  And while you're at it, check out the new Ashwagandha line of products.
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.000]  We have Ashwagandha with black pepper extract, your libido, your testosterone in pill form.
[05:49.000 --> 05:55.000]  And we have the pure Ashwagandha root gummies as well, now available at Infowars.com.
[05:55.000 --> 06:18.000]  Amazing products and they fund the Infowar. Take action now at Infowars.com.
[06:18.000 --> 06:30.000]  It's Wednesday, March 15th, the Ides of March, 2023.
[06:30.000 --> 06:37.000]  This is the day 2000 plus years ago that Julius Caesar was stabbed to death in the Roman Forum.
[06:37.000 --> 06:46.000]  Globalist and leech for the last 2000 plus years have seen it as a time of collapse and when major wars start.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  The Romans already thought March was the month of war.
[06:49.000 --> 06:56.000]  That's why it's named after Mars or going on the March.
[06:56.000 --> 07:02.000]  Marching, marzing, warring, God of War.
[07:02.000 --> 07:10.000]  Now we've got Russian jets shooting down US Predator drones right over the coast.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  Ukraine is getting more and more insane.
[07:15.000 --> 07:22.000]  By the minute, but what should be central in all of our minds is that the gate is being closed.
[07:22.000 --> 07:35.000]  It's like being put in a cell and they close the cell door and you're behind the bars, but they've not thrown the lock into place yet.
[07:35.000 --> 07:50.000]  Warmer, Clinton, Treasury and Housing and Urban Development, Deputy Head, Catherine Austin-Fitch was on Tucker Carlson last night explaining how the cow ate the cabbage.
[07:50.000 --> 08:05.000]  Controlling and more invasive, it's a little bit like bringing up a corral around us and CBDC, central bank digital currencies and vaccine passports or digital IDs are sort of the last shutting of the gate.
[08:05.000 --> 08:14.000]  It's hard for many people to imagine the risks here because we're so used to living with financial transaction freedom and we don't understand that.
[08:14.000 --> 08:27.000]  When this gate closes on us, we literally will be sitting in a system where the central banks believe that our assets belong to them and they can dictate where we can spend money and what we can spend money on.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  If you don't behave, you can have your money turned off.
[08:30.000 --> 08:45.000]  And they've said it's the final piece or the jewel in the center of the crown, the big ruby, big diamond once they have it and they will use it for this.
[08:45.000 --> 08:58.000]  We've already seen the giant consortiums of government and intelligence agencies and dinosaur legacy media along with think tanks and leptis groups surveilling and censoring and terrorizing and debanking everything else.
[08:58.000 --> 09:16.000]  And they're feverishly running around like a pack of gremlins that have just snorted methamphetamine, hopping up and down, calling for this power immediately, which has already been used and put into place to disastrous to
[09:16.000 --> 09:28.000]  monetary control and effect in the communist China. And tying into that, just an incredible new document. I knew about the DHS organization and I knew what they were doing.
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  And I knew about the statements that have been made by Democrats targeting yours truly in the last five years and the beta test.
[09:35.000 --> 09:51.000]  And here it is. Cyber Security Advisory Committee. This document is from last June, but it's only coming out now in Biden's new executive order of last Wednesday to take over all the banking and bring out a central bank digital currency.
[09:51.000 --> 10:00.000]  The protecting critical infrastructure from misinformation and disinformation. Cyber Security Advisory Committee.
[10:00.000 --> 10:18.000]  It talks about how anything that they think even if it's true, if it hurts anything they're doing, it will be banned. And Homeland Security, again, directs this consortium to illegally control and censor and makes them sign nondisclosure agreements
[10:18.000 --> 10:38.000]  because, quote, it's illegal what they're doing. So open organized mass crime. We're going to be laying it all out here today. But there's no doubt now, hindsight's 2020.
[10:38.000 --> 10:48.000]  I wasn't sure on Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Monday. But we were sure by yesterday and now it's all over the news and confirmed. They deliberately imploded SVB Bank.
[10:48.000 --> 11:03.000]  Now they're imploding others. This is the biggest bailout when it amounts to a nationalization of banks, not just here, but as a contagion spreads to Europe all over the world to have live time surveillance of all your finances
[11:03.000 --> 11:16.000]  via the SVB, the central bank digital currencies to, quote, protect the world markets from another crash, the crash they're implementing now.
[11:16.000 --> 11:25.000]  So it's not just the replacement for the old draconian out of control oppressive system, but it's out of the fire into Hades itself.
[11:25.000 --> 11:36.000]  And it's being pushed as the solution. Wow, is all I can say. Dow Jones as of show times 500 points down as banking fears spread.
[11:36.000 --> 11:55.000]  Pull the Dow Jones down and see where it is. Dow Jones, national averages. Also, market price and central bank panic as credit Swiss default risk source ECB contacts the lenders.
[11:55.000 --> 12:08.000]  European central bank. I can says our system is breaking down. We absolutely have a major problem in our economy today. Yeah.
[12:08.000 --> 12:25.000]  Now how many times I tell you in the last year, like a parrot, Papagano thinks how they say it and Spanish or is that Italian. But over and over and over and over again that the next thing will be the banking takeover.
[12:25.000 --> 12:38.000]  And they're already in control, but the next phase of the power grab now it's got 664 points on all of this. Continuing the Silicon Valley bank crisis parallels the 1980s.
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.000]  I think it's far more serious than that. Who killed Silicon Valley bank.
[12:43.000 --> 12:56.000]  Oh, the media is even getting rights in the Federal Reserve raising rates and then them not going in the last few months they knew the bank was in trouble and simply having a larger bank buy it that would have stopped all this but no.
[12:56.000 --> 13:04.000]  They wanted all this to happen bank runs crypto concerns and takeovers a timeline of the panic.
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  American capitalism breaking down before eyes US billionaire warns.
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  A rogue version of chat GPT is predicting with stock market will crash this week.
[13:16.000 --> 13:26.000]  Here's why the AI chat bot is dead wrong. These idiotic chat bots, you know, I've been meaning to talk about this in detail for a while.
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  And Stephen Crowder joins us coming up in the second hour but in this hour.
[13:33.000 --> 13:42.000]  I'll do it in the last segment of this hour. Or maybe even at the bottom of the hour because it takes the time to go over it. I want to explain the so called high technology craze.
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  And how we're told it's the ultimate answer to everything and that whatever they roll out will be adopted is going to be adopted.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  And it's just the way it is and you should just accept it or you're a troglodyte.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  That is not the case.
[13:54.000 --> 14:03.000]  We are the species on this planet that chooses our development chooses our evolution chooses what we want to deploy.
[14:03.000 --> 14:09.000]  Take nuclear power. It's a great source of power but the companies are corrupt as problems they melt down routinely.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  We don't have a good history of being able to have such a power.
[14:13.000 --> 14:20.000]  And so most people agree worldwide nuclear power is not good even people that were for it before because it's just not being properly managed.
[14:20.000 --> 14:27.000]  It could be properly managed but it's not being properly managed. And so it's run into a lot of bombs.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  But that's a real technology that actually helps us in any ways.
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  All this other garbage they claim they're rolling out. We don't have to just adopt it.
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  It's like we don't have to have a nuclear power plant in every city.
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  We just decided we're not going to do that because it's too dangerous.
[14:44.000 --> 14:52.000]  Too many Fukushima's. Too many Chernobyl's. All the meltdowns we've had here they covered up.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  They had one just as big as Chernobyl back in the 60s in California almost nobody even knows about it.
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.000]  They kept it secret for 20 years and they keep it secret in France.
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.000]  They've had a bunch of big problems last decade and the radiation levels shoot way out.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  They go oh we don't know what's going on. Everything's fine.
[15:07.000 --> 15:15.000]  So again it's like race specific bio weapons. They've got bio weapons that'll kill 90 plus percent of whole groups of people
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  and with just certain genetic backgrounds. You can tell it from whatever group you want.
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  And it hadn't been released big time yet since the beta test with HIV and things
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  because well the governments were halfway sane and decided not to kill everybody.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  We don't have to blow ourselves up with Remethian fire.
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  I'm going to talk about that coming up and tie it into Bill Gates's synthetic meat.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  It's made out of the mortal cell lines. We don't know what that is.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  Get ready to get your barf bucket ready.
[15:43.000 --> 15:50.000]  Oh we don't use fetal cells of dead babies. We use clones of the dead baby cells.
[15:50.000 --> 15:56.000]  And mmm is the meat delicious. You thought Pepsi was weird using baby parts for flavoring.
[15:56.000 --> 16:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen we have a new toothpaste that my dad a retired dentist and oral surgeon developed.
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  Dr. Jones natural's turmeric toothpaste that just came into stock.
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  And I got to tell you I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.000]  The way it makes your gums feel what it does to your mouth is insane.
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.000]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and does such great things to the body.
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.000]  It is just dynamite. It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.

[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  In the last month I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books so we didn't have them for sale.
[18:54.000 --> 19:08.000]  But now I sign the last books and get them right now.
[19:25.000 --> 19:31.000]  Autocrats only understand one word. No. No. No.
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  We say no to you getting us into World War III. You're right.
[19:50.000 --> 19:55.000]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no.
[19:55.000 --> 20:21.000]  And we say no to your war.
[20:26.000 --> 20:34.000]  March 15, the Ides of Mars.
[20:34.000 --> 20:40.000]  Thank you for joining us on this Wednesday edition, my friends.
[20:40.000 --> 20:47.000]  So we are in the middle of the next phase of the New World Order Takeover as they bring out the Central Bank digital currencies
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.000]  to be built on the ashes of the Bretton Woods Agreement and what we know of as the dollar.
[20:52.000 --> 20:58.000]  It won't happen this week or next month or probably even this year, but within a year to two years.
[20:58.000 --> 21:06.000]  The average sheeple already trained with their training wheels of the vaccine passports
[21:06.000 --> 21:18.000]  of the QR code for menus and trusted traveler DHS garbage will be where Australia and places like Italy are right now
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  officially not letting you have a job unless you operate with the QR code,
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000]  which will then be tied to the Central Bank digital currency officially.
[21:29.000 --> 21:34.000]  Let me tell you what's coming up today. Stephen Crowder comes on in the second hour to cover the waterfront.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  That should be very informative.
[21:36.000 --> 21:42.000]  Lindsey Graham and others are making very hawkish chicken hawk type statements.
[21:42.000 --> 21:48.000]  Lindsey Graham says U.S. should start shooting down Russian planes now.
[21:48.000 --> 21:57.000]  DHS is in efforts underway to add censorship of financial misinformation to the CISA's portfolio of critical infrastructure
[21:57.000 --> 22:03.000]  domains that can easily classify tweets as cyber attack and thus censor.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  We have the links below.
[22:05.000 --> 22:12.000]  Michael Schellenberger, one of the great investigator journals testified last week, said the entire government agency,
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.000]  CISA and DHS should be abolished.
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.000]  Its lenders and programs have flagrantly and repeatedly violated the First Amendment.
[22:20.000 --> 22:26.000]  Supreme Court rejects government censorship, save those rare cases which speech immediately impacts.
[22:26.000 --> 22:34.000]  Inside physical violence, we'll be going over those draconian announcements.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  We're going to be, as I said, getting into, do we really have to accept the future they're giving us?
[22:39.000 --> 22:45.000]  We just accept whatever new technology, system of control they try to force down our throat.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  Two big stacks on that front.
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  That's the heart of it.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  Synthetic meat. What's really behind that?
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  Wait till you hear about that.
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.000]  Massachusetts High School solidifies the state title.
[23:00.000 --> 23:06.000]  With the help of a transgender girl, policy put under a microscope.
[23:06.000 --> 23:12.000]  That's right, a large man, when he won the state championship a few days ago,
[23:12.000 --> 23:20.000]  was quoted as saying to the girls who were complaining, get over it.
[23:20.000 --> 23:26.000]  Get over it.
[23:26.000 --> 23:34.000]  Also, big stack of news from Germany and Australia and other countries where their governments
[23:34.000 --> 23:38.000]  admit massive increase in severe COVID vaccine injury, including heart attacks,
[23:38.000 --> 23:45.000]  microditis, and multiple cases of high school girls falling to the ground with massive heart attacks
[23:45.000 --> 23:54.000]  who are in good shape, never before seen now a daily or hourly, really, occurrence.
[23:54.000 --> 24:00.000]  Biden assigned an executive order pledging to ban all semi-automatic guns outside of law.
[24:00.000 --> 24:07.000]  Now he says they have a new transgender federal law or executive order as well.
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.000]  The New York mayor now has come out and said that masks are for criminals and for slaves.
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  That's an Alex Jones quote.
[24:15.000 --> 24:21.000]  Now, three years later, he's agreeing with me as the crime spirals even above levels.
[24:21.000 --> 24:30.000]  Democratic Party wanted to use more control, but I guess they don't like too much having to take their own medicine.
[24:30.000 --> 24:37.000]  Ten thousand plus Dutch farmers protest at the UN, the UN policy of shutting down their farms.
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  Yes, they know where to protest.
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.000]  That's all coming up today.
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.000]  But let me get back to the banks.
[24:49.000 --> 24:59.000]  If we don't like the big private central banks creating a system and creating all of these quadrillions and dollars,
[24:59.000 --> 25:07.000]  then raising interest rates and triggering this collapse, imagine what it will be like once they have full surveillance control
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  and full control over a part of our life.
[25:09.000 --> 25:17.000]  Well, they said that they will then bring in the social credit score to the highest levels imaginable.
[25:17.000 --> 25:25.000]  Credit, Swiss shares taken or Saudi backer rules out further assistance.
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.000]  But that's okay.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  California Governor Gavin Newsom has been calling for a full bailout of investors,
[25:31.000 --> 25:37.000]  not just people that had more than a quarter million dollars in Silicon Valley Bank,
[25:37.000 --> 25:50.000]  but he illegally did not disclose that he has heavy investments in the bank and the bank has investments in his wineries and chain of winery restaurants.
[25:50.000 --> 25:58.000]  So the governor's illegally lobbying, not supposed to lobby when you're a governor, much less be getting money for it.
[25:58.000 --> 26:14.000]  So absolutely illegal, but he'll get in absolutely no trouble because the Justice Department lets Democrats commit any type of insider trading or scam they want to.
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  California Governor Gavin Newsom failed to publicly disclose his SVV ties while lobbying for a bailout.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  Business Insider, there's another one, the Intercept.
[26:22.000 --> 26:30.000]  Sharing Silicon Valley bailout, Gavin Newsom doesn't mention he's a client and a lot more.
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  California Governor Newsom failed to disclose it completely and totally illegal,
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.000]  but he is the reincarnation of the American Psycho, so it's okay.
[26:42.000 --> 26:50.000]  Silicon Valley Bank pledged nearly 74 million to Black Lives Matter causes and transgender causes.
[26:50.000 --> 27:06.000]  Tom Cotton says the Biden administration won't commit to not bailing out Chinese SVB investors who are the majority of the investors.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  It just goes on and on from there.
[27:08.000 --> 27:14.000]  Markets price and central bank panic as credits least default risk source.
[27:14.000 --> 27:21.000]  So we really are witnessing a system breaking down in front of us, but don't worry.
[27:21.000 --> 27:34.000]  Right as they sink this ship, they're telling us walk the plank to the frozen ocean saying it's a new ship called the central bank digital currencies and all the horrible things that come with that.
[27:34.000 --> 27:46.000]  And the old banking system going through a heart attack is also hurting cryptocurrencies that are independent and which I believe are the answer to central bank digital currencies.
[27:46.000 --> 27:57.000]  We need a democratized system and people should be able to accept any form of payment that their company or their business sees fit.
[27:57.000 --> 28:14.000]  But instead more governments come out and say like the European Union and Biden and China that they're looking to ban non state or non central bank which are private but still act like the state currencies.
[28:14.000 --> 28:24.000]  So out of one crisis into a crisis far worse and far far more intense.
[28:24.000 --> 28:37.000]  We're going to come back and I'm going to go ahead now and cover something that's very important and that says it all.
[28:37.000 --> 28:43.000]  And if you understand this, you understand basically everything.
[28:43.000 --> 28:54.000]  It's about deciding what our future on this planet will be. Now we individually take control of that process.
[28:54.000 --> 29:00.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[29:00.000 --> 29:14.000]  The fight against the new world order is now the top story in the world. The globalist are in deep trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut down info wars and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe, Tucker Carlson, and countless others.
[29:14.000 --> 29:23.000]  So please pray for us now more than ever, spread the word about the broadcast and get great products to keep us on air and fund our operation while at the same time enriching your life.

[30:40.000 --> 30:47.000]  You'll also know that you help keep info wars on the air. I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[30:47.000 --> 30:57.000]  I encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarstore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate it to the library or give them to the local school.
[30:57.000 --> 31:00.000]  This is an info war. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[31:00.000 --> 31:12.000]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to infowarstore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[31:12.000 --> 31:21.000]  I am humbly, head in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many of you for years and never gone to infowarstore.com.
[31:21.000 --> 31:30.000]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to infowarstore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[31:30.000 --> 31:34.000]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show. That's great. I thank you.
[31:34.000 --> 31:44.000]  But we need funds to operate. Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil and our fizzy magnesium and our sweetpate and our nitric oxide and our real Red Pill Plus.
[31:44.000 --> 32:08.000]  All of these are really great products. They keep us on air. Plus, you're missing out on these products. So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to infowarstore.com right now and get these great info wars products at infowarstore.com.
[32:14.000 --> 32:22.000]  Our actual viewers and listeners, ever go to infowarstore.com and ever actually buy the products. So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the info war.
[32:22.000 --> 32:35.000]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products. Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to infowarstore.com and got some of these amazing products.
[32:35.000 --> 32:51.000]  I would recommend Tomb Raek 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest effects so you reorder and see how great it is. Also, we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil that's so good if you're in neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well.
[32:51.000 --> 33:07.000]  Or real Red Bull Plus, just go try the product, fund the info war and help us defeat the new ruler together infowarstore.com.
[33:21.000 --> 33:36.000]  Mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[33:36.000 --> 33:44.000]  Alright, I've talked a lot about this and I made a film based on it, titled Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement. And I taught for 10 hours on the subject.
[33:44.000 --> 34:01.000]  Oh, just give me a quick history lesson for those who just didn't know for the first time. In the 1850s, the British royal family, the most powerful family on earth, back with the Rothschilds, the most powerful, richest banking family on earth, had dominance over pretty much the whole planet other than the United States.
[34:01.000 --> 34:21.000]  They were already starting to ally themselves with what they do. They lost a war with 70, 80 years before. But they had done things hundreds of years before that, 400 years ago or so, where they put forward the equivalent of $100 billion prizes in today's money for somebody that
[34:21.000 --> 34:35.000]  could make a working navigation clock that could tell time to the second and could be on a ship. And 10 years later, they had it. And nobody could even make a clock that worked, period.
[34:35.000 --> 34:56.000]  So they pumped what's quadrillions of dollars today from about 450 years ago, till now, into new sciences and new systems. And Sir Francis Galton in the 1850s was their top scientist who got mostly funding.
[34:56.000 --> 35:14.000]  And he was the father of modern eugenics. And he invented the word, he invented computers as a concept. He invented biometrics as a concept. He invented most of the technological systems we have today in concept.
[35:14.000 --> 35:36.000]  He envisioned atomic bombs in concept. And then they went out and began funding the mathematicians and the scientists and the people. Come up with that. He also ran a secret breeding program that didn't come out for about 100 years with the highest IQ families in
[35:36.000 --> 35:52.000]  England who would dedicate at least one of their children to the government program. And they intermarried the Galtons, the Wedgewoods, the Huxleys, the Blair's, and a bunch of others.
[35:52.000 --> 36:10.000]  And within three generations of interbreeding these children, a lot of them ended up having serious birth defects or mentally retarded. But they did get some super genius out of it. And so you have to understand that they envisioned this whole plan.
[36:10.000 --> 36:27.000]  A Darwin was part of the family as well. Charles Darwin. And so they discovered DNA about 70 years after they began funding the research for it.
[36:27.000 --> 36:48.000]  They had a lot of ancient knowledge going back to text and things that had been looted by the British around the world about what ancient said had existed before and things like Atlantis. So they described DNA and they described the double helix and they described what they believed it was going to look like.
[36:48.000 --> 37:00.000]  You can say they moved us out of the age of ignorance to a great extent to what we are here, but we already had the Renaissance going. So they kind of bought off the Renaissance for their social Darwinistic control.
[37:00.000 --> 37:19.000]  So that said, they are extremely accomplished. And I don't mean the vestigial royal family you see today that's more ceremonial. I'm talking about the actual coterie of scientists and mad scientists around them.
[37:19.000 --> 37:41.000]  And so this whole world we now live in is a hundred and seventy five hundred and eighty year project, whereas it took them less than 10 years to get a clock that was portable enough to be on a ship with accuracy down to one second a day.
[37:41.000 --> 37:54.000]  But nobody can even make a clock before that. How'd they know they could do it? Well, they did that 10 years. Look what they've done in a hundred and seventy hundred and eighty.
[37:54.000 --> 38:06.000]  Let's just be honest about the fact that they're visionaries, but the very, very twisted, very, very dark way. So when you see everything around you, it's not just some new development or some new thing that's happening.
[38:06.000 --> 38:19.000]  It's being developed and pushed by them because it's part of the future they want to build anything they don't like, anything that they call disruptive technology gets shelved or put on scientific reservations.
[38:19.000 --> 38:35.000]  So the general public doesn't have access to it. And really, the archetype of that in Hollywood, I'm not saying it's real, but a metaphor is the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark where they wheel the Ark into a whole giant,
[38:35.000 --> 38:49.000]  a whole giant warehouse full of tens of thousands of other crates. And the idea is how many other secrets are in those crates as well.
[38:49.000 --> 38:59.000]  So that's where we are. Now, that said, I want to be very clear. They want total world government, total control of their own words.
[38:59.000 --> 39:14.000]  They just were saying it recently because as Klaus Schwab said a month ago at his World Government Summit, if we don't have total control and if we don't dominate the future, it'll get out of our control and other people will and they'll destroy us.
[39:14.000 --> 39:23.000]  So the argument for total tyranny by them is to stop super technology destroying us, but then they're acting exactly like the people they claim they're trying to stop.
[39:23.000 --> 39:33.000]  And how does cutting off your fuel or cutting off your gas stove or putting chemicals in the water to make your son feel feminine and then having his testicles cut off?
[39:33.000 --> 39:45.000]  Or what does having your daughter's breast cut off do? Now, these are megalomaniacs. These are inbred psychotics.
[39:45.000 --> 39:57.000]  And with inbreeding, you know, you get paranoia, you get a lot of psychopathic behavior. And so that's why this happens over and over again from the Egyptians right through to today.
[39:57.000 --> 40:11.000]  But here's the good news. The general public figured out that nuclear power, though very promising, is just not up to our management skills and leaks and causes a lot of problems.
[40:11.000 --> 40:20.000]  So we've collectively decided to dial it back and basically stop the development of nuclear power until cleaner, better forms can be found.
[40:20.000 --> 40:32.000]  So a decision was made by the establishment to just back off of that a bit and only use it for weapons programs and things like nuclear submarines.
[40:32.000 --> 40:50.000]  Now, that said, here's another great example. They reportedly put in at Metta over $80 billion of pure investment the last four years for a project that has completely failed.
[40:50.000 --> 41:01.000]  And they've now laid off another 10,000 employees there. And the Metaverse is an empty wasteland with basically no one in it, even though they incentivize people and pay their employees to be in there.
[41:01.000 --> 41:12.000]  They pay people cash and other prizes like a game show to put on the unhealthy unnatural goggles and immerse yourself in their hellscape fantasy land.
[41:12.000 --> 41:18.000]  So there's another example. They said, Metta will take over. You will live in the Metaverse.
[41:18.000 --> 41:37.000]  Kelly said that seven years ago before he changed in with Facebook two Metaverse three years ago. A famous photo of Zuckerberg with his employees all sitting there, hunched over their laptops wearing VR goggles while he walks as a bipedal God man above them.
[41:37.000 --> 41:49.000]  It's only good for people that are homeless or in a slave camp or children who are about to have a medical experiment done to them. It's literally a bag being put over your head and putting you into their proto matrix false reality.
[41:49.000 --> 42:06.000]  So I want to give you some examples of how we don't have to adopt whatever they say it is we're supposed to do, no matter how much Hollywood force feeding, no matter how much financial incentives are done.
[42:06.000 --> 42:23.000]  Now let's go to this image for TV viewers. This was tweeted yesterday by Elon Musk and it shows a pile of rubble of destroyed city with a cyborg humanoid holding high powered laser blasters in its hands.
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.000]  And it says the singularity. No, really, it's going to be great.
[42:27.000 --> 42:46.000]  But he's somebody more than anybody pushing us into the technologies of the singularity. I'll explain more and then give you examples of one of the biggest frauds in their so called singularity model and the lifecycle of uncomfortable tech.
[42:46.000 --> 42:57.000]  Now that ties into generative tech. We really want to understand where the world's going and how we can change it for the better. We don't have to follow the maps they've given us. We can make our own.
[43:16.000 --> 43:23.000]  However, spread the word about the broadcast and get great products to keep us on air and fund our operation while at the same time enriching your life.
[43:23.000 --> 43:32.000]  Now we've got three new products available at infowarstore.com and a bestseller back at stock. We have the amazing Dr. Jones naturals, turmeric toothpaste, so much more.
[43:32.000 --> 43:40.000]  Find out more at infowarstore.com. We have the Ashwagandha root pills with black powder extract to accelerate your libido, stamina, testosterone.
[43:40.000 --> 43:50.000]  We have pure Ashwagandha gummies at infowarstore.com as well. These are all the highest quality products. The prebiotic is now finally back at stock. They're all there at infowarstore.com.
[43:50.000 --> 44:11.000]  Please take action now, enrich your life, empower your body, and keep us on air. Please take action now, infowarstore.com.
[44:20.000 --> 44:28.000]  Here's the Smith and Owen Troyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible.
[44:28.000 --> 44:38.000]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.000]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[44:41.000 --> 44:48.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[44:48.000 --> 44:54.000]  At the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[44:54.000 --> 45:19.000]  And if 1% more of you took action at infowarstore.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on a cold spot.
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.000]  It was almost as if there were a plan in both India and Canada.
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  You need to go into the capital.
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distract.
[45:40.000 --> 45:44.000]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  What we want to do in Davos is push to reset, but...
[45:48.000 --> 45:55.000]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[46:19.000 --> 46:25.000]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[46:27.000 --> 46:33.000]  So get your copy of the great reset and the war for the world, a signed copy at infowarstore.com.
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.000]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.000]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  You'll also know that you help keep info wars on the air.
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[46:47.000 --> 46:52.000]  I encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarstore.com and get a signed copy
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.000]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the local school.
[46:57.000 --> 47:18.000]  This is an info war I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.000]  Alright, welcome back.
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.000]  A little bit more of a history lesson because that was oversimplifying things
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.000]  but it's hard to do if you don't have a lot of time.
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.000]  It's not oversimplifies hard.
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  But if you go back to the plague that hit Europe and some estimates killed
[47:42.000 --> 47:48.000]  as much as a half the population 500 years ago or so, the Black Death,
[47:48.000 --> 47:53.000]  it wiped out so many of the elites and so many of the centralized systems.
[47:53.000 --> 47:59.000]  It allowed then a lot of innovation to take place not because they were overpopulated
[47:59.000 --> 48:07.000]  but because it destroyed existing orders and marks the end of the Middle Ages and the Dark Ages.
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  So since then you've had a lot of powerful elites trying to control science and technology
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  in a race with the general public's development of it
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  and along comes the United States 250 years ago
[48:17.000 --> 48:28.000]  and takes the Renaissance into the Industrial Revolution at absolute hyperspeed.
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.000]  How many years ago did the Wright Brothers first give flight?
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.000]  Only like 120 years ago or so?
[48:37.000 --> 48:45.000]  How many years ago did they invent the first diesel engine?
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.000]  Look at how fast it all moved and look at how it was empowering us.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  The New World Order is about not allowing normal technological development
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.000]  that empowers and that the people adopt because it's good.
[48:58.000 --> 49:04.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen,
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.000]  it's where they create new systems that are meant to gobble up resources
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.000]  and gobble up time and energy like transgenderism
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.000]  and all the laziness and the drugging of the population that we see.
[49:17.000 --> 49:25.000]  So 120 years ago at Kitty Hawk, the Wright Brothers took to the air bicycle makers
[49:25.000 --> 49:28.000]  and then you saw the rapid development of it.
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  But the globalists want what they call an end of history.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  Here's another example of something they pushed that didn't make it.
[49:33.000 --> 49:38.000]  Esperanto was developed in the 1850s
[49:38.000 --> 49:43.000]  and the UN officially, by the 70s, tried to make it the world's language.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  But no one adopted it. No one accepted it.
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.000]  But now the world's language is not going to be English.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  It's going to be computers and zeros and ones.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  And when you hear AI, that means centralized,
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.000]  programmed by the New World Order systems to control you.
[50:01.000 --> 50:10.000]  It doesn't mean some wonderful new thing that empowers you because the real power of AI
[50:10.000 --> 50:17.000]  is how much data can it get and how much can it make you comply with it.
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.000]  So you can't just predict the future.
[50:20.000 --> 50:26.000]  You can control with the inputs the future.
[50:26.000 --> 50:34.000]  All of this technological rollout is about making humans obsolete.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  And they admit the models of 15-minute cities.
[50:37.000 --> 50:42.000]  And Austin's one of them, where soon you won't be able to drive cars
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  or it'll be too expensive for the average person.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  And it won't be mass transit.
[50:46.000 --> 50:54.000]  Little robots, I shot some footage at Chick-fil-A this morning in South Austin.
[50:54.000 --> 51:00.000]  And the little robots will roll out and they will deliver your food.
[51:00.000 --> 51:01.000]  And guess what?
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.000]  Chick-fil-A will give you a discount if you use the robots.
[51:05.000 --> 51:09.000]  And now McDonald's and Chick-fil-A and others are announcing a plan to have robots
[51:09.000 --> 51:12.000]  replace all of their workers.
[51:12.000 --> 51:19.000]  Robot delivery is available for a limited time at Chick-fil-A.
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.000]  That's for when they remove the cars from the equation.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  It's not a technological development.
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  Acute George Jetson gadget.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  It's removing humans.
[51:28.000 --> 51:29.000]  You say, well, good.
[51:29.000 --> 51:30.000]  They won't need workers.
[51:30.000 --> 51:31.000]  Well, where are people going to work?
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  Oh, they'll just play video games all day.
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.000]  Know the decisions have been made.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  You will be euthanized.
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  These have been official discussions.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  1999, why the future doesn't need us.
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  Shimmering article, cover of Wired Magazine,
[51:42.000 --> 51:46.000]  written by the co-owner of Sun Microsystems.
[51:46.000 --> 51:51.000]  He said he went to a meeting of 200 tech gurus and billionaires.
[51:51.000 --> 51:56.000]  And the decision was made that they're not just going to let us sit around
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  like in the movie Wally, getting fat and being served by robots.
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  They're going to get rid of us.
[52:02.000 --> 52:09.000]  Why are we letting them deploy a system designed to do this
[52:09.000 --> 52:19.000]  where we only interface the machines that are programmed and controlled by the central system?
[52:19.000 --> 52:22.000]  So we hear about a technological singularity by 2045.
[52:22.000 --> 52:28.000]  The only singularity is that that's a goal chosen by Ray Kurzweil, Google and the UN
[52:28.000 --> 52:35.000]  of when they want to post human world to officially be in place.
[52:35.000 --> 52:42.000]  Now, they roll these systems out like religions and just say, oh, it's technology.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  You will adopt it.
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  All new technologies adopted.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  You don't have a choice.
[52:46.000 --> 52:53.000]  Big article I saw last week, the lifecycle of uncomfortable tech.
[52:53.000 --> 52:58.000]  And then it shows examples of things like computers that Persia resisted and finally adopted.
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.000]  Well, that's because they're useful.
[52:59.000 --> 53:05.000]  But then when they're repurposed to control and for a draconian anti-human way,
[53:05.000 --> 53:11.000]  well, then we should reject them, kind of like pit bulls are responsible for 80% of dog attacks.
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  I'm not saying ban them.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  I'm saying hold owners responsible when they hurt people.
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  And, you know, don't move in next door to somebody that's got them.
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.000]  They might be nice.
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  They might not be.
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  The point is, you want to die.
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  You want your kids to die.
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  We all know most of us that pit bulls are a major problem.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  They're nothing compared to this.
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  Let's say your neighbor's got an alligator.
[53:30.000 --> 53:31.000]  Well, Billy's nice.
[53:31.000 --> 53:32.000]  I feed him chickens.
[53:32.000 --> 53:36.000]  But then one day Billy, the 10-foot alligator, decides to eat your toddler.
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.000]  So we don't have alligators in our backyards.
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  We don't have nuclear power plants in our backyards.
[53:42.000 --> 53:45.000]  We sure don't want them there if they are.
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  We don't want Esperanza.
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  We, you know, we're not, we don't want the metaverse.
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  We don't want transgenderism.
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  We don't want the new order.
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  If people want to go cut their weenies off, they can do it as adults.
[53:57.000 --> 54:01.000]  Don't teach five-year-olds to be put in a fast track label to do it.
[54:01.000 --> 54:05.000]  So they tell you all about the life cycle attack and the life cycle of uncomfortable tech
[54:05.000 --> 54:09.000]  and how we'll just accept it.
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  Why generative AI is suddenly on everybody's lips.
[54:11.000 --> 54:12.000]  It's an open field.
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  Why?
[54:13.000 --> 54:14.000]  You don't need a lawyer.
[54:14.000 --> 54:15.000]  The computer will do it.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  You don't need a, no math yourself.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  The calculator will do it.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  You don't need to have writers.
[54:20.000 --> 54:26.000]  Just put in your basic ideas and then the computer will rewrite all these permutations of it.
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  But it's not literature.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  It's not art.
[54:28.000 --> 54:29.000]  It's not smart.
[54:29.000 --> 54:30.000]  It's not cool.
[54:30.000 --> 54:31.000]  It's not amazing.
[54:31.000 --> 54:32.000]  It's all plagiarized garbage.
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  When you go, oh, AI, give me art.
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  You put in a bunch of terms.
[54:35.000 --> 54:44.000]  And it creates this fabulous, crazy, weird, impressionistic image or surreal image.
[54:44.000 --> 54:50.000]  And when you know art, you go, my God, that's taken from over a hundred masters.
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.000]  It just plagiarizes it.
[54:53.000 --> 54:58.000]  Like if I took some of the greatest literature ever by William Shakespeare and J.R.R. Tolkien
[54:58.000 --> 55:03.000]  and whoever else I wanted, then I just mixed it all around.
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  And people said, wow, that's a lot of really great lines from Alex Jones.
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.000]  No, it's called plagiarism.
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  So it's all a lie.
[55:11.000 --> 55:15.000]  It's only powerful because it's harnessing us.
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  Generative tech is the next big disruption in the creative industry.
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  Oh, yes.
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  Demand America first science, stop scientific money laundering, and billions funded to China
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  via U.S. funding research.
[55:25.000 --> 55:29.000]  That's an example of us saying we don't fund gain and function.
[55:29.000 --> 55:30.000]  We don't fund bad things.
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  In fact, we make it illegal.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  And if we find you doing it, we arrest you.
[55:33.000 --> 55:39.000]  But if you don't get control of it quickly, just like fentanyl or open borders, it gets out of control.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  And that's where they put us.
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.000]  And onto this, study Bill Gates lab grown meat causes cancer in humans.
[55:46.000 --> 55:52.000]  They're growing it out of immortal human cell lines spliced with bovine genetics.
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  An immortal cell never dies.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  By the way, it's called cancer.
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  So the meat is literally tumors.
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.000]  Study Bill Gates lab grown meat causes cancer in humans.
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  Yeah.
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  Business week lab grown meat has a bigger problem than the lab.
[56:08.000 --> 56:11.000]  It causes cancer.
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.000]  Immortalized cell lines using lab grown meats can cause cancer.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  Really think so?
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  Think if I eat a big fat tumor.
[56:19.000 --> 56:25.000]  Oh, it grows so well by itself in a Petri dish hardly needs any nutrients.
[56:25.000 --> 56:33.000]  Lab grown meat is tumors made out of chimeric splices of human and animal genetics.
[56:33.000 --> 56:54.000]  Oh, from that one black lady that died in the 1950s who has the most powerful cells ever seen that they estimate they've created hundreds of millions of tons of her cells for every form of genetic engineering you can imagine.
[56:54.000 --> 56:59.000]  By the way, I had her in my stack and I mixed it around somewhere.
[56:59.000 --> 57:03.000]  You guys reprint me that.
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  Oh my God, it's so dark.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  It's so over the top.
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  Let's just reject lab grown tumor meat that we eat that gives you cancer.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.000]  Oh, oh, it bugs.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  You will eat bugs.
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.000]  The chitin shells of every insect out there except grubs.
[57:17.000 --> 57:23.000]  Humans in Africa in a few places eat grubs because grubs don't have chitin in them and are not cancerous.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  You can find the grubs of beetles there nutritious.
[57:26.000 --> 57:34.000]  Almost every other insect is super poisonous and causes cancer and arthritis and everything else because the chitin shell you cannot absorb it.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  So you will eat chitin shells.
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  You will eat cancer.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  You will eat cancer blobs.
[57:39.000 --> 57:45.000]  Bill Gates is going to grow you tumors and you're going to eat tumors made out of human cells.
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.000]  Man, that sounds delicious.
[57:49.000 --> 57:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad a retired dentist and oral surgeon developed.
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.000]  Dr. Jones natural's turmeric toothpaste that just came into stock.
[58:00.000 --> 58:03.000]  And I got to tell you, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.000]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth is insane.
[58:07.000 --> 58:12.000]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and does such great things for the body.
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  It is just dynamite.
[58:17.000 --> 58:21.000]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[58:21.000 --> 58:25.000]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at infowarstore.com.

[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  Bill Gates.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  His synthetic meat is made out of human cancer cells that grow in a Petri dish.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  Aluminum dioxide and barium salt sprayed in the atmosphere.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  Children having their breast and penises and testicles cut off.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  Nuclear war, leaking reactors, fentanyl pouring across the border.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  The mortal life of Henrietta Lacks.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  Now you're going to eat her cells at McDonald's.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  Bill Gates has his way.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  We got Steven Crowder coming up.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  I want to address the viewers watching here.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  The nightmare of the new world order that was in beta is now arrived and it's an operational.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  The world's waking up really fast but not fast enough and info wars has such an important mission
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  to stay on air against the globalist and we can't stay on air without you.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  I thank you for all your past support.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  I just want to encourage you now to make the decision to go to infowarstore.com
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  and get great products at the same time you keep the show on the air.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  We've got a lot of products that have been sold out for a long time that are finally back
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  and we've got right in front of me four new amazing products.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  We have the ultimate bone broth with the chaga mushroom, the bee pollen, magnesium, the turmeric
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  and so much more. Everybody should be taking this.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  It really is the best bone broth out there.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  Concentrated chicken broth.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  So good for your immune system, your joints, your body, your whole system.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  This is our great prebiotic little scoop in the morning or at night with water, drink it down
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  and it's every scoop is equivalent like a whole container of blueberries and other key berries.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  They have these amazing antioxidants that actually help your gut grow in it.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  What the scientists have told me, a really special type of amino acid that's anti-cancer, you name it.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  This is so good for your gut health.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  It's back in stock, our great prebiotic.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  Then of course we have the new turmeric toothpaste that people are really ordering and love.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  That's so good for your gums.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  It's so good for antioxidants that detoxifying and cleaning your teeth.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Also, we have the CBD oil that is 1000 milligram, very, very strong.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  And also 25 and 10 milligram gummies.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  This right here is a multi-month supply.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  It has a few drops a day.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  On record, great for your neurological system.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  On record, great for your brain.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  On record, great for your joints and bones as well.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  Everybody, especially those that have pain, should be on high quality CBD oil.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  This is the highest quality out there.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  Leading competitors sell the same stuff from the same place for 160 retail, $100 on sale.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  It's 67 at infowarstore.com from Infowars MD.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Also, and the gummies are even less.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  We have the ashwagandha gummies with a bunch of key vitamins and minerals.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  Tastes great.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  And then we have with the piper team, concentrate with ashwagandha that just takes your libido, your stamina, your energy, everything the next level.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  We've got that also available in pill form at infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  We will continue to fight it.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  We will stay on air.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  And we have a very clear direction to stay on air.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  And 100% chance of staying on air, unless I get hit by a train or assassinated or whatever.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  But the point is, if you continue to buy the products.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  And we're just right there in the black hovering over the red.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  And I guess that's God just wants to keep me hungry.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  So okay, but I'm just asking listeners who are great folks and who care about freedom to just make the decision to go to infowarstore.com.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  You have to make that decision.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  I'm not bitching at you.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  I'm just saying please keep us on air.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  I think we're doing really good work.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  I think we need to be kept on air.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  Plus, you need great products.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  So that's a decision you have to make.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  And I asked you to make the decision today.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  And so you don't forget in a month or two months or six months to reorder sign up for auto ship.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  It's right there.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  You cancel anytime.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  And then you get 10% off your next order.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  And then you don't forget to get the bone broth or the prebiotic or the ashwagandha or the CBD oil every month every two months.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  You can do it up to nine months.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  And then we hold it back for you.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  So it doesn't ever sell out.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  So you have it.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  So you've got it.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  You know, we sold out a bone broth two years ago.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  People that had signed up for auto ship were still getting it for six months after it was sold out.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  Because we held it back for you.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  So that way it's very rare that it will sell out.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  And if it does, it just cancels your order.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  So go to infowarstore.com, sign up for auto ship.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  That way you don't forget to support us each month or every two months.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  Whatever you decide to do, please take action.

[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  We are connecting with the great Steven Crowder right now.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  He'll be with us here in just a few minutes.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  And I want to air this critically important clip that everybody needs to share from man.video.infowarstore.com.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  If you want to stop the banking takeover happening right now by the globalist, the CBDCCVB and the Jeffrey Epstein Connection.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  Here is Gregory's newest critical report.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  Weeks before the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, several executives sold off large shares of stock, while mainstream media tells its audience to invest in them.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  On March 9, the day before the collapse, Israel's two largest banks pulled up to $1 billion out of SVB, while Peter Thiele's Founders Fund withdrew millions and advised their clients to do the same.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  The next day, there was a run on the bank and Silicon Valley Bank collapsed.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  Is this evidence of a controlled demolition or a hasty one?
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  The day before the collapse, a U.S. judge ordered J.P. Morgan Chase to turn over documents in a lawsuit accusing them of aiding in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  The team behind this lawsuit was the same team who successfully exposed the involvement of Deutsche Bank, and they subpoenaed several other banks they believe were involved in sex trafficking,
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  including Silicon Valley Bank and Bank Lumi, the Israeli bank that drained $1 billion out of SVB the day before it collapsed.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  Whatever the reason, the U.S. government's response threatens to collapse the world economy. The FDIC ensures up to $250,000 for each depositor, but now they are going to cover all depositor losses,
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  and they don't have enough to cover the $175 billion of SVB losses, let alone the trillions of dollars to be lost on the near horizon as banks across the world begin to break.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  The systemic risk among GSIB's global systemically important banks is that they are so deeply connected that when one falls, they will all follow.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  Much of the world's economy is already collapsing due to the actions of the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve Banking System,
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  and much of the world has been preparing for the end of the U.S. dollar as a World Reserve currency.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  After all the smaller banks die, the people will be left with the central bank, and their solution is the CBDC.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  CBDC stands for Central Bank Digital Currency. With CBDC, there are no more options. Everyone's account is run directly through the central bank system.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  As the financial system gets more controlling and more invasive, it's a little bit like bringing up a corral around us, and CBDC's central bank digital currencies and vaccine passports or digital IDs are sort of the last shutting of the gate.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  It's hard for many people to imagine the risks here because we're so used to living with financial transaction freedom, and we don't understand that when this gate closes on us, we literally will be sitting in a system where the central banks believe that our assets belong to them,
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  and they can dictate where we can spend money and what we can spend money on. If you don't behave, you can have your money turned off.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  There are 12 Federal Reserve banks, which are located in cities being considered for the 15-minute city model of the World Economic Forum.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  This is where it's all headed, and there isn't much pushback in the federal government.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  Utah Senator Mike Lee introduced the No CBDC Act last September, which will likely go nowhere, but we the people have much more sway over our local governments.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  An Oklahoma House committee unanimously passed a bill to protect Oklahomans from being forced to adopt a CBDC.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  It's time for we the people to unite with our neighbors and local communities and prepare to liberate ourselves from the central bank system.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Recall our corrupt county officials and start looking into local barter and trade systems because central bank digital currency is coming at us quickly and it equals financial enslavement.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  That report just went up a few hours ago again on Infowars.com and Band-Op Video.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  If you like being free and you don't want to be a total slave, I would suggest you go share it.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  If you try to share it from Band-Op Video on Twitter or Facebook, the block it, but the new URL that's working right now that takes you to the whole site and all the sublinks.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  You can send out the individual links to everybody you know and everybody you don't know.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  The warning about what's happening and tell them to share it is madmaxworld.tv.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  We're having trouble connecting Steven Crowder up in Dallas via their Zoom system.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  That doesn't work. We'll go to telephone with them here pretty soon because you know, phones kind of retroactive.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  I kind of like it and better than nothing, but we'll see.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  We'll just take phone calls and I got a lot of news to cover regardless, but I wasn't looking forward to talking to Steven Crowder.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  But again, the CBDCs is their whole new world order takeover plan.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  So why would we go along with this? We should be passing laws. We should be standing up.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  As consumers, we should be saying, no, we're not going to be surveilled. We're not going to be controlled.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  This is a nightmare. The Chinese Communist system, they admit it.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  And it's just like lab grown meat that Bill Gates has rolled out mainstream news that is grown out of human immortal cell lines.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  Those are cancer cells.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  And then he wants to eradicate, quote, the cows because they create methane that's bad for the atmosphere, but he wants to grow in labs.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  These things, you can't make this up.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  Study. Bill Gates lab grown meat causes cancer in humans.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  Synthetic meat has been heavily promoted by Bill Gates and the globalist elites of the WEF as the solution to the so-called climate change.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  However, the same food ban has now been shown to cause cancer via the immortalized cell lines used to manufacture it.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  And then it goes through some of the big studies that are out there that deal with this.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  Other ingredients in fake meat can cause health issues.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  So it's not really fake. It's synthetic.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  Study. Bill Gates lab grown meat causes cancer in humans.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  Here's another one, Business Week.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  Lab grown meat has a bigger problem than the lab.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  Leading scientists agree that cultured meat products won't give you cancer, really, but the industry doesn't have the decades of data to prove it.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  So it's trying to avoid the question instead.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  Study. Trying to whitewash. Oh, 5G won't give us cancer either. All the studies show it, but they just tell you now it won't.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  Just five years ago, they tell the truth about 5G and all these studies.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  Now it's almost impossible to find and there's almost no new studies because they're flooding the zone with hundreds of billions of dollars of grant money at the academic level and billions a year Gates alone in propaganda money to the news outlets to never cover these issues.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  We've got an idea. How about we just say no to this, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  How about we just reject it?
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  Immortalized cell lines used in lab grown meats can cause cancer.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  And then it goes through the studies and breaks it down.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  Meat cells don't just keep dividing forever to get the cell cultures to grow at rates big enough. The power of business, several companies are quietly using what are called immortal cell lines, something most people have never eaten intentionally.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  And they have two major immortal cell lines, one from a black lady that died of a cancer.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  Her body in two weeks and put her article back up there on screen. And another is a aborted white baby in 1972.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  This is very rare to find an immortal cell line. They reportedly have found some others, but those are secret.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  So they've created industries in genetic engineering where they use their cells, then they splice them and clone them to create growth hormone, thousands of different products.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  So they're basically farming human cells and there's all sorts of cancer causing issues obviously associated with that.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  Does eating immortal, it just keeps dividing forever and never dies, cancer cells sound like something you want to eat?
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  No, no one wants to eat that. No one wants it. No one wants bugs.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  But if they're going to get us ready to eat synthetic cancer cells like their food, well then they got to tell us eat the bugs, drink the sewage water.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  It's all about lowering our expectations, beating us over the head and trying to get us to accept any nightmare they want to push on us.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  We'll be right back with a ton of other news and information more on the immortal cell lines here today. This is really important stuff.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  We've got to get control of civilization from these mad scientists.

[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  World War III has already started.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  There's mass censorship.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  James O'Keefe been removed from Project Veritas.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.

[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  Well, Stephen Crowder joins us for the balance of the hour, and I can't wait to cover the waterfront
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  with one of the biggest independent pro-freedom broadcasters out there.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  And so without further ado, Stephen Crowder joining us here on The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  You know, when we were getting you on the show, you said, what do you want to talk about?
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  I said, what do you want to talk about?
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  I want to talk about the whole world, about the censorship hearings that were so incredible last week,
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  and the war, and all the stuff you've been going through, and the borders,
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  and the Redfield's testimony about gain of function and Fauci lying.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  I mean, it seems like the deep state's burning down around us, but they just don't seem to care.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  So Stephen Crowder, louder with Crowder, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  Thank you for having me, sir.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  Glad to be here.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  I appreciate it.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  And yeah, it is a thing.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  You'd like to think the deep state is burning down, but Alex, come on.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  You really believe that?
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  You don't think it's going to resurrect from the dead?
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  Like a Romero film?
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  Come on.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  Well, I agree with you that they're like zombies.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  They just keep coming.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  But wow, the stuff I talked about 25 years ago, stuff we've been talking about forever as well,
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  it used to be fringe.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  It's just everywhere now.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  Yeah, you know, this is a good example, actually, because I know you wanted to talk about the gain of function.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  Well, for example, you know, January 6th is a big story right now.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  Here's the thing, you know, we've sort of been off air, obviously, for a while, which I'm sure we'll get to.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  But when I heard everyone talk about the revelations regarding January 6th, I remember I was going,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  what revelations?
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  Well, so they were escorted in.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  I'm going, OK, so what revelations?
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  What's new?
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  Well, you know, there were feds there who were pushing people over the banquets.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  I go, yeah, OK, so what's new?
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  Same thing.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  I was on a show recently, they were asking me about the new bombshells with a gain of function.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  Well, what do you mean?
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  What's new?
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  You mean that someone else admitted to it?
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  And it turns out maybe we funded it more than we knew?
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  I mean, Joe Biden's saying that he supports, right?
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  The administration's supporting gain of function research.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  January 6th, we ran these clips of the QAnon shaman within the month of it happening.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  We're suspended on YouTube, by the way, of him talking to a Capitol police guard saying,
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  all right, we'll bring you in single file and him turning around in his silly cookie monster voice saying,
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  all right, we have to be peaceful.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  And we did a whole sketch about it.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  We had the QAnon shaman in the studio as an ongoing sketch because we knew that he was escorted in.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  So I guess we have a slightly new angle from a different security camera as far as footage,
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  but there's no really new information.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  Like you said, you've been talking about a lot of these things for decades,
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  but certainly as it relates to these stories, my question is, why are people thinking that this is new?
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  What disservice are not only the media, but even let's be honest, right-leaning media,
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  what kind of a disservice are they doing to their viewer that the viewer didn't know until the last two weeks
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  that January 6th was largely people being escorted into the Capitol building with some vandalism and trespassing?
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  Why are people now thinking it's a revelation that we funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab?
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  This isn't new. It's just that we were suspended, right, if we talked about these things a long time ago.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  Now there are enough people trying to cover their own ass admitting that it's true.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  Hopefully I can say ass here. I know you're still on also on radio.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  You can cuss if you want. We just delay five seconds out, but I'm glad.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  It's like we have a mind meld. I haven't talked since I was in your studio three months ago, four months ago,
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  so we didn't script this, but I was about to go exactly there.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  I'm not going to sit here and bash the Daily Wire because they're, quote, competition.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  I don't see them as that. The globalists are my competition. I want to beat their ideology.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  But I agreed with you with what you were doing, exposing that, because you used the nail on the head.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  It has been mainline conservative Inc., the talk radio, you know, a lot of the Foxes, people other than Tucker,
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  and of course the Daily Wire, who said, just take your damn shots, and there is no gain-of-function.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  And who said everybody at January 6th deserves to be shot or put in prison, or worse.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  I mean, we can play all the clips of conservative Inc.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  And there's some great people over at the Daily Wire, like Candace Owens and countless others.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  I'm not throwing the baby out with the bathwater, but it's very legitimate to point out that they have this whole pedigree,
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  the leadership of these groups, of controlling what we can say and going along with it,
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  and then telling this whole stable or collection of talk show hosts that they get and control,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  and Fox is the worst about doing it, from keeping them from saying the truth
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  when there was evidence of gain-of-function three years ago.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  There was evidence of the feds letting people in, as you said, two years ago,
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  and you covered it and I covered it.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  And then all these other people really don't cover it, and then they turn around
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  because Elon Musk freed up Twitter some, now they think it's safe,
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  and suddenly now all of this is true and blah, blah, blah.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  But then the next time there's a big story, they're going to sit on the bleachers again
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  until they think it's safe again, and we don't have time for that.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  And so I know I have you on as a guest and I'm ranting here,
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  but we don't have time when the next big event comes for them to sit there with their thumbs in their butts,
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  while all of our freedoms are taken.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  So I'm not in competition with them. They'll be more popular if they get hardcore.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  I want them to stop being wimps.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  Sorry.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  And to be clear, when I talk about them, I'm not talking about Daily Wire.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  Daily Wire was an issue where people kind of know that people can line up wherever they want.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  I hope that everybody does well.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  My issue is this, and like I said, there were about four or five,
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  maybe six offers that were on the table when our contract went up
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  and we were looking as to where we wanted to partner alongside Mug Club.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  And the issue is when you look at these contracts out there
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  and you have people on the right, and by the way, many are good people,
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  but they have penalties on behalf of Big Tech.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  This is something that a lot of people don't know.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  Hosts and content creators are penalized if they're suspended.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  They're penalized if they somehow are demonetized on YouTube.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  To the tune of some of the offers that people know.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  Because in a fighting censorship, these big conglomerates like Daily Wire
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  that could break the back of censorship, they partner with Big Tech as the enforcer.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  And it's the same thing with Fox News.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  That's the only issue.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  And here's the thing, look, I would never say,
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  I don't get into the business of saying controlled opposition
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  or sort of trying to attribute motives.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  But I will say this, and I'm not talking about Daily Wire.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  Again, like you said, there's so many great people out there.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  That's kind of something that blew up.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  I didn't name, by the way.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  But there are a lot of people out there where maybe they believe
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  that vaccines were the best things since sliced bread.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  Maybe they believe that any and all elections have been the most free
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  and most fair in our lifetime.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  They believe that there was no evidence of gain of function research.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  Maybe all of that is true.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  And I mean that sincerely.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  But here's, I don't know.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  Here's what I do know.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  That with the contracts that exist out there, and keep in mind,
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  I also worked for Fox News for four and a half years,
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  they would be precluded from speaking about it anyway.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  They would be penalized if they spoke about it anyway.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  So you can't know necessarily if they don't believe those things.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  I assume they do, but if they had a problem with these issues,
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  there aren't people outside of yourself.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  And thank God myself, and we've partnered with Rumble,
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  this partnership where, if I can plug, you know,
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  lotofcriter.com.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  We come back March 20th, by the way.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  We've added new shows.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  We have Mr. Guns and Gear.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  We have Brian Keller adding a Friday show.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  So two times the content.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  We have two more announcements coming up.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  People get three months free if they signed up at mudclub forever.com.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  And by the way, you're going to be here in the studio in third chair,
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  I think next Wednesday.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  Do you think I could ever do that?
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  Do you think I could ever do that if we signed with any of these other
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  major companies?
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  We can only be brothers in arms if we can partner with each other freely.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  And if we engage in mutually beneficial free enterprise.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  But the issue here is I sit back and I get so mad.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  Alex, when I see people saying, you know,
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  I follow this in a very granular way,
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  and I had no idea about the QAnon shaman.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  Well, you should.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  You should have known.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  You know what?
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  I guess your guess is as good as mine as it relates to the,
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  the gain of function research.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  Really?
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  It's as good as mine.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Your guess is as good as...
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  We had Rand Paul on here.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  Gosh, I want to say two years ago presenting the evidence,
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  who by the way, I agree with on almost everything,
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  and he still irritates me.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  I don't care because I want the truth to get out,
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  and we are afforded that luxury.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  We would not be afforded that luxury.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  If we'd have partnered with, with, with anybody else,
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  I still...
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  Well, that's really the key.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  And we need nationalists and populists to just pro free speech people
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  and conservatives and Christians to ally together,
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  even if we're not the same company and agree,
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  we're going to hold the line and we're not going to self censor
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  or censor our people.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  We're going to try to tell the truth.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  But when we're handed down these things like,
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  don't talk about the Afghan withdrawal.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  That was one of the things, the Twitter false show.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  They were censoring people that criticized the Afghan withdrawal.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  Now they're criticizing people that are against open borders.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  Now they're criticizing people that bring up January 6th stuff.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  We'll be right back with Steven Crowder.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  Powerful stuff coming up. Stay right there, Steven Crowder.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  that my dad a retired dentist and oral surgeon developed.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  Dr. Jones Natural's turmeric toothpaste that just came into stock.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  And I got to tell you, I got samples of this month's ago and it is amazing.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth is insane.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  and does such great things for the body.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  It is just dynamite.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  at infowarstore.com, Dr. Jones Natural's turmeric toothpaste.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  And while you're at it, check out the new Oshwagandha line of products.

[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  The globalists are in deep trouble,
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000]  but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000]  to shut down info wars and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  and Tucker Carlson and countless others.

[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  while at the same time enriching your life.

[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  and a best seller back at stock.

[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.000]  Today's of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  Major scientific institutions in Australia, India, and France
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  the discoverer of HIV within a month of COVID being out there,
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  they had scanned it, the P Shuttle gene, the cleavage site.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  They said it's man-made, it's got the HIV spike protein welded onto it.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  If you give people a vaccine for this, they're going to come up as HIV positive.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000]  And Australia created a regular vaccine.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  They were getting HIV positive, so they had to stop it.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  After only 10,000 people were given it,
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  almost all of them came up HIV positive.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  They really have HIV, but they had the spike protein, so it showed that.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  My point is, the science was there three years ago.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  Okay, we had the scientist on.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  Like Steven said, I remember seeing the interview.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  He had it over two years ago, Senator Paul laying it all out.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  So, the fact that it's all here illustrates the bubble that would big tech
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  and conservative ink, not just a daily wire, because they've got some great hosts,
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  but just in general, they won't touch something until it's kosher to talk about.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  So, Rogan's credit, he's not controlled by any of that.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  He kind of woke up a year and a half, two years ago.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  I helped inform him at a lot of dinners we had.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  And he came out first, and I think kind of helped break the bubble outside of Crowder and Jones.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  So, it's not about us saying we're the best.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  It's about saying, I want to beat this authoritarian system.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  That's my goal.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  It's not big paychecks, but oh, you turned down that big paycheck.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  I was told because you wanted a bigger one.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  How much money are you actually getting at rumble?
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  Was it more than daily wire? Are you greedy bastard?
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  Well, first of all, it's a partnership to be clear, which is what I'm so excited about.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  No, no, it's actually a little bit less.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  It's a little bit less than the offer that people know about publicly.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  It's a little bit less initial, and then it's less overall as far as actually cash,
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  but more upside.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  So, the idea that, oh, only one person take, no, I wanted to take on some of the risk
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  and also take on the ability to make it successful because, look, here's one thing too.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  I've never really talked about numbers, right?
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  When people talk about Mug Club, when we talk about...
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  Well, you're not really a bastard.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  I know your dad.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  I know your wife.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  I know your family.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  You're a great guy.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  I was being sarcastic.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  No, I appreciate it.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  I know, Alex.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  I am a bastard, though, sometimes.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  No, but the issue is it was always about making sure that there is, you know,
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  that we're all sort of mutually aligned, right?
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  The Bible talks about not being unequally yoked.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  And you need to be free to discuss.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  Here's the thing.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  Big tech, I'm not looking to get suspended from YouTube to be clear.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  Okay.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  So, when we come back, March 20th, we will be available on YouTube and on rumble.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  But we need a decouple from YouTube.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  And a legitimate criticism.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  Some people have said, well, you know, where would you be if not for YouTube?
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  Because that's where I kind of started 2006, 2009 politically.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  Sure, YouTube's a valuable platform.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  But as you well know, big tech is only a valuable platform if you can speak the truth.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  I understand working within the system to change it.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  But once you reach a point where you cannot discuss the truth, for example,
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  you talked about COVID, you know, when everyone else was in their basement.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  This includes just not just Jimmy Kimmel, but everyone on the right.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  A lot of people were in there.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  We said, you know what?
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  We're going to do two days.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  And that's when we blew up.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  And Dr. Peter McCullough on the very first week of the two-week quarantine,
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  the two-week lockdown that people were doing, and we got suspended for that.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  It has been an ongoing situation.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  Well, that's why I'm back to you, is that I know you've had the courage
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  and you do the research that, quite frankly, almost no one else had.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  And that's scary.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  We shouldn't have courage to be so rare.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  It needs to be contagious.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  Well, you know, I don't think it's courageous.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  I think it's a promise.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  When I promise people that I'm out there fighting like big tech, fighting big tech, fighting like hell, right?
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  That's our slogan.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  And we took it, of course, because people tried to say that Donald Trump was calling people to an insurrection.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  When we say fight like hell, we mean it.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  I can't take you any to fight big tech and then punish everybody who works for me
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  if they don't do the bidding of big tech.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  I am willing to speak the truth and let the cards fall where they may.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  It's a PT13 show.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  It's an entertainment show.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  We make all of the references publicly available.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  But there also needs to be, here's one thing, too, Alex.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  There's a vision here for the future.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  Okay, and not just with Rumble, but what you guys do.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  There needs to be the ability to partner with people.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  Like you said, even though we don't necessarily agree on everything.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  Parallel world.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  Hey, maybe there's something where there's a discount.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  People who are members of Mug Club get a discount if they join in for wars and vice versa.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  So we give more value to the viewer.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  I'm not saying that to death specifically, but I'm saying this.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  You can only make these kinds of arrangements if you're in a situation where True North is serving the viewer, is serving the average American.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  And I've talked about this, Alex.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  People act as though this is risky.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  And certainly what we do, right?
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  Some of the times, like a sketch with you as the angel of Gabriel in a transgender has cellmate.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  That was a hilarious sketch.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  By the way, people can go and watch it on Mug Club.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  People say, oh, maybe that's niche.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  Hold on a second.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  Does anyone have any idea how many people watched Johnny Carson?
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  How many people watched Leno?
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  How many people watched Leno?
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  Let's go even closer after the fracturing of cable.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  How many people tuned in to the finale of Breaking Bad?
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  Well, that's true.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  I'm not kissing your ass when I say it.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  For how small your crew is, you guys have the best production quality.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  And how much you churn out that's all, you know, A or A plus quality.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  I mean, I just, I marvel at it.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  And that's what I was going to say is, and I think I told your dad this last time I was up there.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  You, I think, should become like the mothership.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  And then obviously you vet people that are quality.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  You make sure stuff gets checked.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  You can't just say anything.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  Like, I've been a bull and a shining cabinet not on purpose, but not knowing they take stuff out of context and blow it up.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  You, I think, have had a really good thoroughbred view of getting the most truth out while at the same time surviving.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  Without selling out.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  Well, thank you.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  I really do try to, you know, my thing is if I can't prove it, then I won't say it or I'll make sure to say, look, this is conjecture.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  But, but, but my point here is I don't remember what my point was, but you were saying something that was very interesting.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  But no, I appreciate we look, we make all of our references publicly available.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  I don't know that anybody else does that because I demand that people fact check me.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  I demand that people ensure that I am either correct or incorrect.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  We need transparency.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  We know that was what I was talking about, Breaking Bad.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  So, you know, people talk about how it's niche.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  This is an entertainment show largely, right?
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  We do all kinds of crazy sketches and bits and on location.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  All right.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  But Breaking Bad had about 15 million people.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  I remember they had some focus groups about 70%.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  A majority of them were conservatives.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  Okay.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  Peak viewership on the biggest conservative show on Fox News on television is 2. something 3 million.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  If you're really lucky with the median demo of 70 something, there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  What I'm saying is that's niche.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  That's niche.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  Entertainment is not niche.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  There are so many Americans out there who think like we do and we are not doing.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  We're not doing it well enough because they're not tuning in.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  That's our fault.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  Well, that's why I like your show because sometimes I don't watch it when it's live or in the morning.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  But when I'm sick of news and sick of all the horrible stuff going on, but I still want to see what's going on.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  I tune in because it's so entertaining and it's relaxing.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  So for me, I understand it's hard to do a nighttime show, but your show really feels like a nighttime show.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  Well, it started as a nighttime show and then what happened is when we did two days during the lockdown, right?
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  We did a nighttime show in the morning show.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  We realized that most people watch late night in the morning.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  That includes Fallon.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  That includes Kimmel.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  So we said, well, you know what?
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  Let's just do it in the morning anyway.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  That way we're ahead of the news and people will watch it in the morning and then they'll also watch it at night.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  So it basically is a nighttime show in the morning and that kind of happened by accident.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  It used to run at 9pm every night.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  But I appreciate you saying that.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  Look, I do not want to be people's only show just to be clear.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  That's why we're adding people.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  We're adding people under the umbrella of Mugklip to be clear.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  The most profitable thing that I could do would be capitalize on the current paying subscribers and then move on my merry way.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  But we have put ourselves, Alex, and you know what this means?
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  We have put ourselves in a position.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  People sign up there at Lightofcredit.com slash Mugklip where in adding new talent, in adding new shows, we have to perform.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  We have put our back against the wall to put our money where our mouth is because it's a lot harder and it's a lot more expensive.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  And we're coming for half a million subscribers, a million subscribers by election night 2024.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  That's awesome.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  You know, without getting into the big boys.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  Without getting into end fighting, you know, you left the blaze.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  Glenn Beck's the type of guy who's very talented, but he'll give you one of his paintings.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  And then a year later, talk crap about you on air and say you're a terrible person.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  And you know, that place is very nice facility up there in Dallas.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  I know you were there forever, but not inside of it.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  You were separate.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  You were leaving there, you were looking at other outlets.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  I'm glad you've gone with Rumble.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  They seem like to be the best in a really, really building, I think, the platform of the future.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  But why'd you leave the blaze?
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  Well, we had a contract.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  So to be clear, I signed a contract with a company called CRTV.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  And I can only say good things about the man who ran that company, a guy named Kerry.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  Fantastic actually gave this company raises when we didn't even ask for them because we out punted our coverage.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  Then there was, you know, business stuff that's sort of, you know, it's inside baseball.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  People don't care.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  There was merging.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  Look, it just wasn't the right fit.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  And I understand we're not necessarily the right fit for a lot of people.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  You know that very well, Alex.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  That's probably why you're doing it on your own as well.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  Right?
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  Sometimes it's just, it's risky.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  What we do is a little bit different.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  But here's honestly what I was always looking to do is fundamentally change the landscape of the internet.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  And a part of it is motivated by seething rage, which I know isn't Christian of me, but I have been around YouTube right since 2009.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  And I have been suspended and we had the Vox at Poclips and we've been threatened to be removed and we've had to meet with the brass.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  Here's Susan Wojcicki up there talking about how they've created new guidelines for us, the borderline guidelines.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  And you see Senator Hirono and Nancy Pelosi saying that we need to be removed.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  And I've watched this happen and I've watched people on our side night not fight back because it's sort of a tripopoly with big tech.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  Here's the beauty of rumble.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  Okay.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  Mug Club is under that umbrella where people can pay and they can get, that's 89 a year.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  They get a full hour of show and the rest of all of this content.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  But it also allows rumble to compete on the free portion with YouTube, right?
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  The free portion is a platform like YouTube.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  That's the beauty. We've got to operate in all zones, on the enemy zones, our own zones.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  This is an information war.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  Steven Crowder, final segment straight ahead.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  And I'll be up there.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  What is it next Wednesday?
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  All right.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  We now have three new game changing products that are in stock at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  And one of our best selling products sold out for over a year.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  Let's now back at stock.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  Our prebiotic, does the introduction.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  Such amazing things, your gut flora, your overall health.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  What it does is essential, but read about it at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  And now, the fourth toothpaste, as I'm my dad.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  The last two are big hits.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  This one is really special.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000]  It's turmeric concentrate with a bunch of other essential oils.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  So much more to take your mouth's health to the next level.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  We also have high quality ashigandha root for your libido, your stamina,
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  your testosterone with black pepper extract to accelerate it as a pill.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  And we have ashigandha root gummies as well.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  Very strong, very powerful.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  Now in stock at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  Go there, experience these great products and others, and fund the InfoWars.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  The only way we fail is not taking action.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  God bless you.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  Now please visit InfoWarsTour.com and experience these powerful products for yourself.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes,
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  five, six, seven days a week.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  It's really just incredible.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  Most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTour.com
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  If just 1% more of you took action at InfoWarsTour.com, our fighting problems will be over.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  Please take action now.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  This is their big move.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  He doesn't care.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  That's not his job.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  He's not the President of the United States.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  They must be opposed.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  No.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  No.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  No.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  Exactly.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  We will not take my car.

[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.160]  Last month I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them for sale.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:55.600]  But now I sign the last books and get them right now.
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:57.600]  Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  This is an information war and Stephen Crowder in his entertaining way with his band of merry Liberty Pirates certainly has been challenging the system and you got to say for political shows is as big as it gets on YouTube and he's absolutely right.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  They have Fox News audiences every day but it's not all celebrated and you know like it's Hollywood.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  Well we're not Hollywood and this show has giant audiences as well, we're trying to save the country, that's really my mission.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  And you know Stephen's having a fun time while he does it, I'd say joking half the time, very serious the other half.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  I'm serious about 95% of the time, that's probably why I've gone so crazy but here's one of the skits that's hilarious that got him suspended on YouTube a few years ago, here it is.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  So that's going on in prisons all over the West, it's all admitted, you've got transgender athletes winning the Massachusetts track and field championship and it's a male.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  Stephen Crowder this is why we've absolutely not just got to survive, we've got to thrive.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  So tell us more about your big show relaunch that's got conservative making a lot of other people looking over their shoulder.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  You know what's funny is that girl actually, she's adorable, right Lily?
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  She went to work for one of the big boys because sometimes you end up with this where sometimes people kind of get poached and I'll write them a letter of recommendation because I can't afford to necessarily keep them.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  And came back because realized that there was there was it was a little bit different than she had anticipated and this happens a lot with our with our studio where people will leave you know you know I'm sure you've had this struggle right Alex where your talent and your creators people will come and they go oh they're really good.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  They pay them more but then they say you know what we're going to lay you off or then lower the salary but I will tell you this, this is the most important issue of our time.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  I mean taxes are important yes government corruption is important this ties into government corruption but the idea that there are no men and women that they are fundamentally interchangeable.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  That's when society collapses and this isn't even the first story by the way I was suspended a throttle on Facebook back gosh I want to say 2014 2013 for talking about Fallon Fox the person who lived as a man for 32 years of his life.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  I believe father children and then fractured women's skulls in the cage and lied by the way about about her biological his biological sex and I don't know if he's still living as a woman.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  So this is something that we've been facing for a very long time and the most important thing with mug club and people can sign up lot of credit.com will be coming back March 20 along with 345 other shows $10 cheaper than it was before.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  It's about decoupling from big tech look when you were removed Alex.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  I think we had you on the next day within 48 hours and we had you on YouTube and I don't know how we got away with that because there was there was a policy person and I'm glad Alex Jones on YouTube I was disappointed that a lot of other people didn't.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  Even though you and I have some fundamental disagreements I feel compelled to poke my finger in the chest of people who tell you what you can by the way let me talk about some inside baseball when you did that.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  I think it was like a day and a half later.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  That was the only reason a bunch of other people had me on and then YouTube had to clarify no other shows can have him he just can't have his own show so you helped break that electronic Berlin Wall for employers which is why I appreciate you.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  I didn't know I appreciate that because when I did it they they know in certain terms that no no you can have him on I said well go screw yourself with a wire brush I'm gonna have him on anyway so I'm glad that it worked and that's one thing to write we have a big enough platform and I don't say this to brag about it.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  But I need to take ownership and responsibility for when I say I have a big platform I don't.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  You do meaning the people viewing right now do they vote with one trillion percent clear there aren't many of us at this level.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  And this is a fight for our whole future we don't have the speech to challenge this takeover we're going to lose so this is a central it's a war for people that don't know.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  It costs tens of millions of dollars a year to run info wars with our bandwidth our crew our expenses the legal all of it.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  So when people saw that contract you turned down and now you've taken a lower contract for freedom they thought oh this greedy bastard that's you paying for all your expenses your studios your bandwidth all of it.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  People don't know what it takes I saw the other day like BuzzFeed's $110 million in the hole and going under and all they do is write articles.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  I mean you know so we operate on a fraction of the money the left has that's why let's just have to understand it is a war it takes money to win wars.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  If you want good culture and good ideas out there folks you've got to patronize it you've got to support it.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  Yes they have to support it and you know and we have to offer a product that's worth it.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  That's always what I always say I need to earn your dollar meaning people who are watching I need to earn your dollar every single day.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  I act as though every single audience is new and you've never seen what we've done before so we don't rest on the laurels because when you do that you end up with a median demo that's 72 years old.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  And by the way Alex there's nothing wrong with a lot of traditional conservative media having a very very old demographic.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  My problem is with exclusively marketing to that demographic when you when you exclude people saying oh no this is how conservatives make money.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  I talked about this the other day Alex you travel the country I know you do you have a lot of people you interact with.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  Okay some of them are probably a lot of them libertarians some of them Republicans conservatives.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  Have you ever once met a Lindsey Graham fan no a Mitch McConnell fan no Romney fan no okay and these people are constantly in positions of power.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  Right think about it we don't know one not one even when you're talking about McCarthy have a lot of people have issues with him he wouldn't be the first choice.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  These are unelected people when they get elected to these positions of authority for example someone like Fauci is completely unelected sure people are elected to the House or elected to the Senate but then effectively they pick who leaves them.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  But even when you're talking about a Republican primary I didn't know a single person who was enthusiastic about Romney I don't know a single person who was enthusiastic about the king.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  I know a lot of people who were enthusiastic about Donald Trump by the way not saying that he's faultless not saying that he's blameless of course not.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  But when people say you know what we need to be a unified front I agree but they need to come our way we don't need to go there.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  Exactly we've taken over the Republican Party we're the populace and let me ask this because when I tell the story all the time it's a gauge like a bellwether it's not like oh I'm famous.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  You know 10 years ago I'd walk at the mall maybe shake one hand every hundred people knew who I was or came over and then under Trump the show bloops so big it was like I would shake 30 40 hands every other person
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  and then somebody say if you Russian agent I'm gonna you know kill you blah blah dump coffee on me it's been caught on video many times.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  Apparently go out to a restaurant without being attacked.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  Now in the last year or two I go all over the place all over the world in the liberal areas all I get is love now.
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  You are just as well known you're a gauge as well you travel a lot are you experiencing the same thing because I see that as a gauge of the public mind it looks like people are really awake right now.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  I have a little bit of a reputation as a bordering on Howard Hughes Hermit just because I'm very guarded with my private life.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  But yeah I know I get recognized we had to put a gym here in the office and it's not a big gym it's a box with two squat racks because every time I would go to the gym.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  What should be 45 minutes would be two hours because you know you always want to you always want to talk with people you always want to sign stuff but at a certain point like hey.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  I gotta get out of here and I gotta go to work so we had to install a gym here because it was taking up so much time in my and I'm grateful I'm incredibly grateful.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  But it absolutely does change your life and and yeah even my dad who's been on the show you know just every now and then people here Gerald for crying out loud gets recognized everywhere and people like him now.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  I don't know how that happened but people love Gerald now so I'm grateful for it and that's why I feel like we have to use our platform and our voice.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  I'm not saying oh we're famous we're Hollywood the notes the opposite we're letting listeners that feel alone and don't think we're winning no.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  I was getting coffee and tea dumped on me every couple weeks when Trump first got elected it that doesn't happen all I get some love now I mean I listen.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  I have to wear sunglasses and a hat not that I want to talk to people and like pull a collar up if I go to the grocery store my wife won't go I'm becoming.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  Well that won't work Alex what you think your inspector gadget outfit then the second you open your mouth like oh yeah I just want to get some corn puffs and people like oh that's Alex Jones.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  Come on exactly all I'm getting is love now so it means something's changed what's changed yeah. I think what's changed is our ability to reach people directly and I think a big part of what it's it's the loyalty from people because.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  We talk about people being othered right that's what the left says whether it's look if you're a black Afro lesbian gender major you know studies major you can pick from hundreds of representatives in mainstream media.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  If you are someone who is going to an Ivy League school or you are someone who's on the east coast or somewhere in Los Angeles and you're conservative or you're working in the entertainment industry guess what you're working in the liberal arts.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  You are completely alone you are completely other that whether you're black yellow red white guess what you don't have anyone speaking for you and so when I have people come up they'll often say hey you know what.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  I've always been more conservative but I was never going to watch you know foxes I was never going to tune into a lot of that I would grow up watching letterman I would grow up watching Conan or Howard Stern and they said you know what.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  I thought there weren't people out there like me who thought like me but also didn't just want read me talking lines and they say that they really feel less alone that's a big thing we do the stand up shows.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  Talk about many many thousands of people at each show and that to me is not something that I exalt myself it humbles me because I genuinely feel like I have to serve these people there's a responsibility with that.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  We don't have shows like yours that we can easily make number one we don't have the culture we are number one freedom is number one and people fighting from the front lines are our champions and that's why I totally support you.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  How do people get on board the bold new relaunch if you're already hit show with all the new shows and make sure it's even bigger because I do want it to become bigger than conservative ink not to it's not a pissing contest but so I can be free.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  Just because we can't sit there while they cower the next globalist operation for two years with their thumbs in their butt we need to be leading from the front with you and others how do people support the great work you're doing.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  And by the way in a perfect world we all get on the same page and we all say you know what okay we understand the the enemy that we're facing in the left in the complete deconstruction of western civilization it's a lot of credit dot com slash mug club.

[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:26.320]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils, it is just
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:27.320]  dynamite.
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:31.560]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:36.520]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at infowarstore.com, Dr. Jones
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:41.080]  natural's tumor toothpaste and while you're at it, check out the new ashwagandha line
[02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:42.080]  of products.
[02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:46.840]  The ashwagandha with black pepper extract, your libido, your testosterone in pill form
[02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:52.800]  and we have the pure ashwagandha root gummies as well, now available at infowarstore.com.
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:55.320]  They're amazing products and they fund the info war.
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:06:12.560]  Check action now at infowarstore.com.
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:23.360]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones and the hilarious Steven Crowder.
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:34.360]  Steven, you wanted to get into those insane deep state weaponization hearings last week.
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:36.800]  I think they're a lot bigger than the First Amendment when you had all these government
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:42.640]  agencies and intelligence agencies and corporations and media all with think tanks attacking and
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:46.560]  censoring anybody that questions hundreds of different issues.
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:50.440]  To me, this is an authoritarian totalitarian scandal.
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:51.440]  How would you define it?
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:56.440]  Again, the only thing new here is Matt Taibe talking about what he was able to examine.
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:00.800]  I will tell you this, we have been suspended, removed myself from Twitter on Facebook.
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:02.520]  That was a national article that was engaged.
[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:05.720]  That's how I met my lawyer when they were censoring Ted Cruz, the Chris Cowell Foundation
[02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:06.720]  and myself.
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:09.560]  Of course, the Vox had Pocalypse with YouTube and we've had many conversations with people
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:10.560]  at Google.
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:12.280]  As you well know, one time we were doing a change in my mind.
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:15.240]  This has been going on for a long time and I have at some point been suspended or throttled
[02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:17.160]  from every single platform.
[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:19.400]  Here's something that no one else knows this, Alex.
[02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:23.280]  With Twitter, there were some reporters who were talking about going through the documents
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:24.280]  with Twitter.
[02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:26.280]  I said, hey, you know what you may want to look into?
[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:30.200]  Look into the advertising accounts with Twitter because what happens is they court you, ask
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:31.520]  you to advertise on Twitter.
[02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:32.720]  This happened with me on Twitter.
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:35.040]  We actually had a legal dust-up with Twitter that we won.
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:38.000]  They said, hey, come advertise your profile here on Twitter.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.360]  We'll create a campaign so you'll increase your followership.
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:41.360]  This is when I didn't have a lot of money.
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:44.280]  It might have been a few thousand dollars every couple of months.
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:47.200]  Then they said, oh, you know what, we're going to actually have to punish you and remove
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:51.440]  you from the ad account because this campaign is a violation of our guidelines.
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:52.840]  I said, wait a second.
[02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:55.720]  You guys wrote the copy for the campaign.
[02:07:55.720 --> 02:07:59.040]  I told people who were reaching in and doing the prodding, I said, look into the advertising
[02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:02.040]  accounts because this isn't the only place that it's happened.
[02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:03.040]  Not a peep.
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:06.360]  Then it took a third party like Matt Taibbi to come out and say, actually, this is going
[02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:07.360]  on.
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:08.360]  We know this has been going on.
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:10.720]  We've had conversations behind the scenes that this has been going on.
[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:15.040]  I've had senators and congressmen, people high up, asked me what's going on, sent them
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:17.760]  information and then what ends up happening, grandstanding.
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:22.640]  Doesn't it just sort of just boggle the mind when you go, hold on a second.
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:24.680]  Nothing's been done about 230.
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:26.680]  Nothing's been done when Republicans had power.
[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:27.840]  Nothing has actually been done.
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:30.800]  That to me is the biggest failure of the Trump administration.
[02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:35.280]  They had the opportunity to do something and you know why because people on the right are
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:36.280]  afraid.
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:38.720]  They are pacified by people in big tech and I understand it.
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:42.440]  It's this big Leviathan, but it's only going to get more powerful if we allow it to be.
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:46.160]  And Alex, I know you've always been more libertarian, but let me ask you this here.
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:49.920]  Do we honestly believe that it's a free company, they can do whatever they want at this point
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:53.320]  when they're benefiting directly from the government and working with government agencies
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:54.320]  to censor people?
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:55.320]  No, it's not.
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:56.320]  It's not an independent platform.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:58.920]  Because they're interfacing with the government and rigging a market.
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:00.320]  That's anti-libertarian.
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:01.320]  Exactly.
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:02.320]  Exactly.
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:03.440]  Now that is government.
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:08.600]  That is an arm of government and they are determining over 90% of the information that travels.
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:12.160]  So when you have these conservative libertarians who say, well, you know what, go and create
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:13.160]  your own YouTube.
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:14.160]  Well, really?
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:17.040]  How do you do it when they're not liable for the crap that's put on their channel, that's
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:19.600]  put on their platform, but they're still allowed to censor?
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:21.240]  No one else has afforded that, right?
[02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:23.400]  It's like saying go and create your own Verizon wireless.
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:24.400]  Well, hold on a second.
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:29.600]  This is why we also understand the concept of non-excludable, non-rival risk when people
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:30.600]  talk about roads.
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:34.040]  We understand there's a legitimate role of government when the government protects these
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:39.440]  entities and is directly working with these entities to determine policy beyond the scope
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:40.800]  of the law.
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:41.800]  We have laws.
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:42.800]  That's the thing, Alex.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:46.640]  How will investigative journalism ever exist again?
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:47.640]  Right?
[02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:50.640]  The only way that works is if we have an understanding, we live in a society with laws where it's
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:54.160]  a single-party consent state, I can expose corruption because I don't need their consent
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:56.040]  to film this or to record this.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:57.560]  But then YouTube says, you know what?
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:09:58.560]  We don't care.
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:01.440]  They said they didn't really like the recording that went up and they removed it.
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:04.920]  How could you ever expose corruption when those people are in direct communication with
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:08.720]  the folks at Big Tech and then how could you ever find conservatives to back you exposing
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:09.720]  corruption?
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:13.240]  That's exactly where I was going.
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:14.240]  Read my mind.
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:15.240]  James O'Keefe.
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:16.240]  Read my mind.
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:17.240]  We're sabbatical.
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:18.240]  That's what folks have to get.
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:20.400]  When you pay for your own servers, your own infrastructure, your own thing like you're
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:25.200]  doing, it costs 10, 20 times more than if you're on those big platforms that leave you
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:26.200]  alone.
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:28.720]  People want us to build our own thing, build the new culture.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:29.720]  You're doing it.
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:30.720]  I'm doing it.
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:31.720]  A few other people are doing it.
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:33.240]  And that's why the support is so critical.
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:35.200]  But let's talk about James O'Keefe.
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:36.400]  Superstar of Liberty.
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:38.560]  We've been in so much more tyranny right now.
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:42.400]  If it wasn't for his leadership, his incredible work, his tirelessness, they're trying to
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:47.560]  put him in prison, the FBI raids, all of it, and then the Pfizer thing was so big, I said
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:51.880]  that day, I said they're going to shut him down or kill him in the next two weeks.
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:52.880]  And what did they do?
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:56.160]  Now, he's back again, but it'll take funding to do it again.
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:58.880]  But that is an example of there aren't many of us.
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.440]  And what do you make of the O'Keefe situation?
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:01.920]  Well, here's also a problem.
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:02.920]  That's the problem with nonprofits.
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:07.120]  You and I both know that as free enterprises on the right, there is undue influence from
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:08.120]  nonprofits on the right.
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:10.720]  And that's why there's a lot of these big conservative companies that exist out there.
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:13.600]  They also have a nonprofit wing and funds exchange hands.
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:15.280]  And that's because they don't really believe in the product.
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:17.680]  That's because they say, if we get donations, then we can create content and then maybe
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:19.800]  we generate enough profit or we kind of kick it back.
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:20.800]  So here's the thing.
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:25.040]  We need to get away from nonprofits and we need to be entirely funded by viewers like
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:26.040]  you.
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:27.040]  That's what Mug Club is.
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:28.040]  That's why we've reduced the price.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:33.640]  You can't find a pay service for $89 a year, along with, by the way, this hand-etched,
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:34.640]  hand-painted mug.
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:35.640]  It's very expensive to send out.
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:39.440]  Our goal is to create more value so that there's critical mass so there are enough people out
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:40.440]  there.
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:41.440]  We can't be beholden to donors.
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:44.920]  We can't be beholden to investors, whether that's an oil baron or whether it's someone
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:46.200]  who's made money in hedge funds.
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:49.760]  There's nothing wrong with making money, but you cannot be beholden to one or two people
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:53.280]  and certainly not nonprofit donors because guess what?
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:55.040]  If their incentives, right?
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:59.640]  If their motives are not determined by the profit for some reason, meaning the audience,
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:00.640]  right?
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:02.200]  In our case, we're beholden to the audience.
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:03.680]  But if you have a donor who says, you know what?
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:06.400]  I want you to do this and they dangle a check.
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:07.400]  That's how you end up.
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:08.400]  People are confused.
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:10.400]  James O'Keefe, isn't he Project Veritas?
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:12.480]  Yeah, he is until you get a board.
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:15.320]  And then the board decides to have some relationships with people who are donors.
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:17.760]  And those donors decide that they don't like the way you're doing things.
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:18.760]  And beyond that.
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:20.280]  You don't want them to donate because of who you are.
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:22.960]  And then they can buy you off, absolutely.
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:25.960]  And we also know the FBI is threatening to basically indict a bunch of people at Veritas
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:27.800]  for nothing if they didn't do that.
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:29.960]  So it's also the FBI holding them hostage.
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:31.360]  And we mentioned last year's hearings.
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:35.320]  There were a lot of comical moments, but to see them trying to get their sources, to see
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:39.640]  them acting like it was bad that the stories were big, was ridiculous.
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:43.520]  But the worst was when this Congresswoman, I think it's Garcia, was like, oh, you talked
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:44.520]  to other reporters.
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:45.520]  Is this a three-syllable?
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:49.640]  They're like, well, really, it's more like an orgy.
[02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:50.640]  Here's the clip.
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:53.880]  I did by a friend, Barry Weiss.
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:55.720]  My friend, Barry Weiss.
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:59.040]  So this friend works for Twitter or what is her?
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:00.040]  She's a journalist.
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:01.840]  Sir, I didn't ask you a question.
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:03.960]  I'm now asking Mr. Schellenberger a question.
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:04.960]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:05.960]  Barry Weiss is a journalist.
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:06.960]  I'm sorry, sir?
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:07.960]  She's a journalist.
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:08.960]  She's a journalist.
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:11.360]  So you work in concert with her?
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:12.360]  Yeah.
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:16.800]  Do you know when she first was contacted by Mr. Musk?
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:17.920]  I don't know.
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:18.920]  You don't know.
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:24.240]  So you're in this as a threesome?
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:26.160]  There was many more people involved than that.
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:27.880]  There was many more people involved with it.
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:32.160]  Are you being paid to be here today, either through consulting fees, camping contribution
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:33.160]  to your next run?
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:34.160]  Absolutely not.
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:37.680]  Have an interview scheduled after this hearing?
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:38.680]  Absolutely not.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:39.680]  The ladies' time has expired.
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:40.680]  Thank you.
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:45.040]  I don't know what to say other than I'll recognize the gentleman for me.
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:49.720]  So what's happened is they've been censoring and spying and bullying and deplatforming
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:51.640]  and no banking for years.
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:53.800]  And now they're so used to it, they're just doing it out in the open.
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:56.600]  Where do you see all this going, Stephen Crowder?
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:59.800]  My first question is, when was Lady Laine allowed to leave America around in the land
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:00.800]  of make-believe?
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:03.320]  That was the most bizarre make-up and voice that I've heard.
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:05.120]  It almost seemed like it's a Jim Hansen character.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:06.640]  Look, we know where this is going.
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:07.640]  It's already there.
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:10.120]  And I hope that people like Tayebi, who by the way is a classical liberal, I hope that
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:14.480]  these people who use these same methods in the past saying, well, these climate deniers
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:17.400]  and that means anyone who doesn't believe in the policy of global climate change in
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:20.360]  the world economic form, they're likely funded by big oil.
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:21.440]  That's the attack they always were.
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:22.440]  Are you being paid to be here?
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:24.480]  Well, hold on a second, Garcia.
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:26.520]  Are you there for free?
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:28.240]  Are you not getting a salary?
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:32.720]  You're being paid to be a grandstanding rube who suckles at the government teat.
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:35.000]  You don't have to provide anything.
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.360]  This is, I have a relative who's going through having to get their passport because they're
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:39.360]  about to travel.
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:40.920]  It's four months late.
[02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:45.440]  Can you imagine delivering a product for or your show four months late?
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:49.320]  The only people who live in this world are government employees who, by the way, increase
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:54.280]  their own personal net worth in their portfolio at an astronomical rate compared to the average
[02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:57.800]  citizen because insider trading laws don't necessarily apply to them.
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:14:59.240]  These people are being paid.
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:04.200]  So why would it be a problem if that man was being paid to help represent as a consultant?
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:06.160]  They don't apply the same standards to them.
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:07.160]  And this is the issue.
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:09.720]  It's a constant application of a double standard.
[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:13.760]  We see it from the left, but what's most disconcerting is when you see it from the right.
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:17.040]  That's why when someone on the right says something that's, let's say offensive or I don't agree
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:20.720]  with, if it's a joke, I'll say, maybe I didn't find it funny, but I have to acknowledge that
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:21.720]  it's a joke.
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:25.200]  I hope that people who are coming over to the right, they need to get up that next rung
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:26.360]  of the ladder, Alex.
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:28.680]  It can't just be, oh, I like free speech.
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:29.680]  Great.
[02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:30.840]  What else are you going to do with it?
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:33.760]  What is the lens you use through which you view the world?
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:37.880]  And I have never shied away from the fact that I am a card-carrying, traditional, conservative,
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:40.640]  with probably libertarian leanings, but it's defined by my faith.
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:42.120]  It's defined by my values.
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:45.400]  This is my worry is the people who are, whether it's Barry Weiss, whether it's Ta'ebi, they've
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:46.400]  done some good work.
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:47.400]  Great.
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:50.800]  But have you fundamentally shifted your worldview for the next time?
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:51.800]  We're out of time.
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:53.400]  What's the website for folks?
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:54.400]  Sorry.
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:57.320]  I'm doing you right now, lighterwithcriter.com, slash Mug Club.
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:58.320]  We need to...
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:04.480]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to infoorstore.com
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:08.280]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:10.360]  and your body, and keep us on air.
[02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:15.640]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:18.920]  you for years, and never gone to infoorstore.com.
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:22.560]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you.
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:26.560]  Never actually go to infoorstore.com and never experience these great products and never
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:27.560]  find the operation.
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:30.880]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:31.880]  That's great.
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:32.880]  I thank you.
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:33.880]  But we need funds to operate.
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:37.280]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:41.640]  oil and our fizzy magnesium and our sweet bait and our nitric oxide and our real Red
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:42.640]  Pill Plus.
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:44.080]  All of these are really great products.
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:45.080]  They keep us on air.
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:46.760]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:52.040]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to infoorstore.com right
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:57.840]  now and get these great info-worse products at infoorstore.com.
[02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:02.560]  Every time I talk to you, you're either on the border exposing the cartels and coming
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:06.360]  under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:10.400]  and criminals, and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:12.200]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:13.960]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:17.040]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:21.600]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth, and again, I have info-worse to thank for that.
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:25.520]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:31.080]  I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the info-worse
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:32.080]  team.
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:37.400]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to get these types of clips, because Alex's
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:43.040]  whole mentality was go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:47.080]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity, I'm just addicted to telling the truth and
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:51.400]  helping the American people, and I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:57.960]  that within me early on in my career.
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:00.600]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:05.520]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny, and
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:10.840]  that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:15.840]  That's why I ask listeners, respectively, to go to infowarstore.com and buy great products
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:21.560]  that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:26.880]  infowarstore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:32.720]  for the World, Ultimate Bone Broth, Back at Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:37.400]  we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:41.960]  It's all available at infowarstore.com, some of the very best products, and a lot of you
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:43.560]  have never shopped at infowarstore.
[02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:46.720]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken
[02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:49.000]  the step to go to infowarstore.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.120]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:59.960]  So again, please take action, go to infowarstore.com today, and I thank you.
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:05.920]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:06.920]  place.
[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:10.480]  The week has already started, Biden is a puppet, and this is all over our borders, there's
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:14.560]  mass censorship, James O'Keefe been removed from Project Veritas, the list goes on and
[02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:18.040]  on of the bad things that are happening, but the good things that are happening is humanity
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:23.360]  is really accelerating, it's away, but those of us on the forefront are under more attack
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:27.160]  by the establishment than ever, that's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:31.080]  the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:35.040]  great products at infowarstore.com, and whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:38.760]  sold out for the great reset in the world, or open bone broths, finally back in stock
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:42.760]  it for over two years, it's all available at infowarstore.com, these are truly amazing
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:47.680]  products, so get your info wars products at infowarstore.com and enrich your life while
[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:52.280]  keeping the broadcast on the air, it is your decision whether or not we stay on air, so
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:59.760]  please take action now at infowarstore.
[02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:09.920]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:25.600]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:35.040]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:40.440]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:46.840]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist.
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:54.480]  We face a hostile ideology, global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:21:04.000]  and insidious in method, unhappily the danger it poses, promises to be of indefinite duration.
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:09.240]  Eisenhower's fears were well founded, today American taxpayers are unwittingly financing
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:15.320]  the growth and power of a censorship industrial complex run by America's scientific and technological
[02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:18.640]  elite which endangers our liberties and democracy.
[02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:23.840]  Demolishing free speech cultural narratives, Americans valiantly and successfully defended
[02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:25.400]  by the grace of God.
[02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:32.680]  The propaganda industrial complex monstrosity that Obama quietly modernized in 2012 is now
[02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:35.280]  rampaging across America.
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:38.840]  A guy that's done memes on Hillary Clinton, I think this came from a couple years ago
[02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:40.400]  in the 16 campaign.
[02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:42.360]  He's facing 10 years in prison?
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:48.320]  Well remember there's this statute that again was originally designed to prevent the Ku Klux
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:54.720]  Klan from intimidating African Americans from being able to vote at the polls, and they're
[02:21:54.720 --> 02:22:01.080]  saying that, well this wasn't intimidation but it was a kind of deception because people
[02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:05.800]  are going to think it's real and they're going to text Hillary instead of going to vote.
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:10.640]  Even though, as I mentioned, they haven't been able to produce a single aggrieved party
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:15.120]  that didn't vote as a result of this satirical meme.
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:20.080]  So the whole premise is ridiculous, but again they're trying to expand it such that you're
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:25.360]  not just going to be censored and de-platformed for disinformation, you're going to be thrown
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:26.360]  in jail.
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:31.240]  Now laid to waste by the creeping socialist sabotage of the O.Biden administration.
[02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:37.200]  Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal.
[02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:44.400]  Donald Trump and the Maga Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:46.080]  of our republic.
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:51.440]  I give you Exhibit A as Jamie White reported, Richard Stengel, a former State Department
[02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:56.280]  official under Obama and founder of the Global Engagement Center, which has come under scrutiny
[02:22:56.280 --> 02:23:00.960]  since the Twitter files revealed the extent of its role to censor the American people
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:03.760]  who defy establishment narratives.
[02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:05.440]  Propaganda, I'm not against propaganda.
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:09.520]  Every country does it and they have to do it to their own population and I don't necessarily
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:11.360]  think it's that awful.
[02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:18.120]  Files in the Twitter files revealed that the GEC was a key entity involved in the social
[02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:23.760]  media platform censorship policies, working as a go-between for the federal government
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:24.760]  and Twitter.
[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:29.800]  For every government agency scanning Twitter, there were perhaps 20 quasi-private entities
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:35.400]  doing the same thing, including Stanford's election integrity partnership, News Guard,
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:41.400]  the Global Disinformation Index, and many others, many taxpayer-funded.
[02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:46.840]  A focus of this fast-growing network, as Mike noted, is making lists of people whose opinions,
[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:54.040]  beliefs, associations, or sympathies are deemed misinformation, disinformation, or malinformation.
[02:23:54.040 --> 02:23:58.120]  That last term is just a euphemism for true but inconvenient.
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:04.160]  We are now experiencing something alien to our system of government and civilization,
[02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:10.880]  in real-time, as the walls of the First Amendment crash down in a controlled demolition.
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:19.320]  So Mr. Taiyibid, do you believe that the Russians and their oligarch-controlled Internet
[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:28.360]  Research Agency interfered in the 2016 election via this social media disinformation campaign?
[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:29.360]  Do you believe that?
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:32.880]  Mr. Congressman, my disagreement with the issue is...
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:37.040]  I think this is a, this is basically a yes and no question.
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:41.880]  Either you think so or you don't, and I don't have a lot of time, so...
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:48.280]  Okay, well then I'm going to answer not in the sense that you, that you're putting it.
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:49.280]  Okay.
[02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:55.280]  I think all countries engaging offensive information operations, the question is scale.
[02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:58.120]  Do you believe that the Twitter files were...
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:00.880]  Reclaiming my time is how it works now.
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:03.880]  I'll ask the questions and you try to provide an answer if you can.
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:06.280]  You have to allow them to answer.
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:07.480]  You believe...
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:09.480]  You crossed that line with the Twitter files.
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:10.480]  No.
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:11.480]  Elon Musk, it's my time.
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:12.880]  Please do not interrupt me.
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:21.680]  Elon Musk spoon-fed you his cherry-picked information, which you must have suspected
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:26.080]  promotes a slanted viewpoint or at the very least generates another right-wing conspiracy
[02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:27.080]  theory.
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:31.960]  It's just a matter of what data was given to these so-called journalists before us now.
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:35.880]  There are many legitimate questions about where Musk got the financing.
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:39.080]  Ranking member Plaskett, I'm not a so-called journalist.
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:44.400]  I've won the National Magazine Award, the IF Stone Award for Independent Journalism,
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:49.720]  and I've written 10 books, including four New York Times best sellers.
[02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:56.280]  Mr. Chairman, I'm not exaggerating when I say that you have called before you two witnesses
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:59.640]  who pose a direct threat to people who oppose them.
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:03.200]  We're going to conflate the First Amendment is not absolute.
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:08.840]  Once the First Amendment, which is on life support, is gone, a totalitarianism which
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:14.600]  the human race has never experienced will rise up and this country we know as the United
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:17.640]  States of America will be no more.
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:22.160]  I never thought in my own country that freedom of speech would be threatened in this way
[02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:24.840]  and it's just frightening when you get into it.
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:26.200]  That's what's going on now.
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:28.880]  There's an order that comes from a small group of people.
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:29.880]  We don't know who they are.
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:30.880]  We can't ask.
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:35.640]  It comes on from high and they're saying, you need to say Latinx now and you need to
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:40.480]  say, you know, a person experiencing homelessness.
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:44.360]  And I feel like this is why woke becomes a joke because you'd rather rename it than
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:45.360]  solve it.
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:56.360]  It's a cult that wants to control every facet of our minds that's trying to get us to accept
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:03.400]  things that go against our instincts or common sense that is a nightmare, that is a tyranny.
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:07.960]  I mean, every day I see these videos with the anti-fa attack and police stations and
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:09.800]  courthouses and it barely even makes the news.
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:14.240]  You know, just last week, now we have this new video and it was smashing doors and windows
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:18.720]  and throwing eggs and you see Davis entrance where Charlie Kirk was going to be speaking
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:20.680]  will play the club in a moment.
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:27.520]  But you've got the big banks, the intelligence agencies and all these groups, big tech attacking
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:30.960]  the people, surveilling and censoring us.
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:37.560]  And then you've got these thugs funded by the Democratic Party, bailed out by the Democratic
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:42.000]  Party when they shoot people and fire bomb things, attacking us on the ground floor
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  of everything.
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:48.960]  I mean, this is an authoritarian, totalitarian orgy of idiocy and the globalist themselves
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:51.240]  are creating a world that will destroy them.
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:55.160]  Anybody can extrapolate out that when you undermine all of civilization, the name of
[02:27:55.160 --> 02:27:58.160]  controlling it, you're going to blow yourself up.
[02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:00.600]  Idiocracy is not a safe place to be.
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:01.880]  So why are they trying to do it?
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:06.720]  Because they're thinking short term about power and control and believing they can finagle
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:07.720]  this.
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:09.720]  I didn't get to the clip.
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:11.360]  We'll go to break and come back with it.
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:13.000]  It's just so damn frustrating.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:18.400]  It should be easy to reject Bill Gates and synthetic cancer meat that's literally grown
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:19.680]  out of cancer cells.
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:20.680]  That's mainstream news.
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:23.360]  Like, well, there's no proof that cancer cells will hurt you.
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:25.440]  Those studies say it'll give you cancer.
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:32.440]  And if you thought red meat was bad for your colon, how about cancer cells grown from dead
[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:34.240]  people that just keep growing forever?
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:39.160]  I mean, yeah, yeah, you can take one of these cells and it starts replicating and you just
[02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:40.160]  eat meat.
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:41.160]  Eat meat.
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:42.160]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:46.600]  Like what I tell you 15 years ago about human animal hybrids, and they're like, oh, that's
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:47.600]  crazy.
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:48.600]  Now it's all over the news.
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:50.100]  It was going on 30 years ago.
[02:28:50.100 --> 02:28:52.440]  We are not in Kansas anymore, Toto.
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:54.200]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:57.560]  Stay with us.
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:00.960]  The fight against the new world order is now the top story in the world.
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:05.720]  The globalist are in deep trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:11.000]  to shut down info wars and other true tellers like James O'Keefe, Tucker Carlson, and Cowell
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  Souther's.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.840]  So please pray for us now more than ever, spread the word about the broadcast and get
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:19.520]  great products to keep us on air and find our operation while at the same time enriching

[02:31:50.400 --> 02:31:51.400]  God bless you.
[02:31:51.400 --> 02:31:58.440]  Now please visit infowarstore.com and experience these powerful products for yourself.
[02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:01.600]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had.
[02:32:01.600 --> 02:32:06.840]  I don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:07.840]  us.
[02:32:07.840 --> 02:32:11.320]  When we talk about the crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:16.840]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:32:16.840 --> 02:32:21.280]  When we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Stroyer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:25.680]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:28.600]  So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:32:28.600 --> 02:32:34.080]  I only encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:35.080]  us.
[02:32:35.080 --> 02:32:38.160]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:43.440]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com and you never buy great products
[02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:46.960]  that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keep us on air.
[02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:51.360]  I know that less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:55.480]  If just one percent more of you took action at infowarstore.com, our fighting problems
[02:32:55.480 --> 02:32:56.480]  will be over.
[02:32:56.480 --> 02:32:59.320]  Please take action now.
[02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:16.320]  Thanks for searching for us.
[02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:32.320]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, out here in the fields.
[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:57.320]  I don't need to fight.
[02:33:57.320 --> 02:34:03.320]  To prove I'm right.
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:05.320]  To prove I'm right.
[02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:07.320]  Look all around you folks.
[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:11.320]  I don't need to be forgiven.
[02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:15.320]  That's my message to all my enemies, God forgave me, I don't need you to.
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:18.320]  Go to the mirror if you want to throw a stone at me.
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:21.320]  Leave without sin, cast a first stone.
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:28.320]  Left lives off making those of us that have a conscience a problem to them like they're the authority and they're our priests.
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:31.320]  But they're not our priests, they're not our God.
[02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:39.320]  Here's well-known visionary economist Carl Eichen who predicted the last few crashes saying our system is breaking down.
[02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:43.320]  We absolutely have a major problem in our economy today.
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:55.320]  I want your reaction to what Citadel's Ken Griffin told the FT about this very issue in which he suggested that the government should not have bailed out all of the depositors.
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:35:01.320]  He said, quote, the US is supposed to be a capitalist economy and that's breaking down before our eyes.
[02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:07.320]  There's been a loss of financial discipline with the government bailing out depositors in full.
[02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:09.320]  What do you make of that statement?
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:19.320]  I can't opine on what Griffin is saying there because I don't quite understand where it goes.
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:29.320]  But I am saying that he's right that our system is breaking down and that we absolutely have a major problem in our economy today.
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:35.320]  And I'm not going to opine on whether or not you bail out a bank or something like that.
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:41.320]  But you can't have the country feeling that it doesn't matter if they save.
[02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:47.320]  It doesn't matter because they could spend a little money they want, they could do whatever you want because the government will bail you out.
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:49.320]  He's right about that. You can't have that.
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:53.320]  Now, should you bail this bank out? I don't know.
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:59.320]  I don't like to opine on things that I'm not really that conversant.
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:05.320]  But I do agree that the system is breaking it out.
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:13.320]  One of the major reasons, not the only reason obviously, but one of the major reasons is that you don't have good corporate leadership.
[02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:16.320]  So you say, so what? But I'll tell you so what.
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:22.320]  If you don't have good corporate leadership in companies, yeah, when the tide is high and things are great, it doesn't matter.
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:28.320]  And all these guys that run these companies are partying and having a good time and giving themselves bonuses.
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:33.320]  But their agendas are different than the people who invest with them.
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:35.320]  You know, they're looking to get their bonuses.
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:38.320]  Well, I tell you, I live it. So I go into it.
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:42.320]  And there's a reason that we make so much money.
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:52.320]  I mean, just to make the point, over the years, in 2000, if you invested in IEP, you annualized.
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:58.320]  If you reinvested the dividends, you made an annual return of 15%.
[02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:03.320]  And the closest is Buffett, who I believe made around 9%, S&P made 7%.
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:07.320]  But why? Because we go into companies and clean them up.
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:11.320]  And there's so much to clean up, and it's getting much worse now.
[02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:15.320]  We're one of the worst countries in the world as far as corporate governance goes.
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:17.320]  And I can go on and on about that.
[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:46.320]  I know that you've been fairly negative on the market for a while. You've been hedged, and I think you had...
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:53.320]  You can't give quadrillions to the central banks to buy up all the infrastructure and all the intellectual property and everything else.
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:57.320]  And then not have a bunch of corporate leadership that doesn't give it down.
[02:37:57.320 --> 02:37:59.320]  Because they got all this money.
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:02.320]  And then meanwhile, there's no real economy, so things fall apart.
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:04.320]  And this is real simple. They make it complex.
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:08.320]  Henry Ford, say what you want about him, was very smart.
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:14.320]  And the other car makers were only selling limited amounts to elites and rich people.
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:18.320]  And he came out with a Model T, and he said,
[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:23.320]  I want to have a car so inexpensive, the average person can get it.
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:33.320]  And I'm going to pay my factory workers three times what Chrysler and others were paying people.
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:38.320]  Because I want them to be able to buy my car.
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:44.320]  I want to build an economy that's scalable to increase the standard of living.
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:52.320]  Now, that's an elitist that wants to make everybody successful, so he gets super rich.
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:58.320]  Because what is money worth if you live in Mad Max world?
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:04.320]  What if you've got $100 billion in the bank, but you live in an armored fortress with walls around it in the middle of nowhere,
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:12.320]  and the rest of the planet is melting down in wars, and then there's a nuclear war?
[02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:18.320]  What is stealing all the money through monetary policy worth if you can't spend it?
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:23.320]  Well, they did it because they want control socially. That's the real end game.
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:26.320]  And then you see what the sick policies are, these people.
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:32.320]  Synthetic meat grown out of tumors of humans. That's mainstream news.
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:40.320]  Well, why is that? Well, how do you think you just throw some meat in a big vat, a blob of meat, a blob of cells,
[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:46.320]  and then a week later it grows like a culture that's not bacteria.
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:53.320]  It's human cells off of the emotion of nutrients you put in it.
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:40:02.320]  You could put saline solution in in water, and cancer cells will grow.
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:09.320]  They don't need any real nutrients. They're called immortal cell lines. They're dangerous as hell.
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:16.320]  An immortal cell line is the most aggressive cancer on earth, weaponized by nature,
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:21.320]  that they know of two people, a black woman and a white baby.
[02:40:21.320 --> 02:40:23.320]  Pull it up, put it on screen, guys.
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:26.320]  Now, keep going back to this because it's all over the news.
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:31.320]  Well, yeah, it is cancer viruses. I mean, it is cancer cells, but, you know,
[02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:35.320]  because those cells have cancer viruses in them. That's what causes cancer.
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:43.320]  So a virus goes in and turns the cell into a zombie where it just keeps reproducing forever.
[02:40:43.320 --> 02:40:47.320]  And then they go, hey, this has got a great side effect.
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:51.320]  Yo, Henrietta Lacks, she had a tumor killer in two weeks.
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:53.320]  She came in, got a gynecological check.
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:57.320]  They held her in the hospital two weeks later. They said it had grown to like 50-pound tumor.
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:03.320]  And they took that tumor out of that woman, and it's deadly as hell,
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:09.320]  and now they're growing T-bone steaks for you with it.
[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:20.320]  Now, if I tried to make up something fantastical and insane,
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:26.320]  that crazy, I couldn't do it.
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:33.320]  If I tried to come up with the weirdest thing on Earth that just sounds completely far out and unbelievable,
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:40.320]  it'd be that. But it's true. They showed you the article the first hour.
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:53.320]  And so they take the most powerful cancers ever seen from this white baby and this black woman that died.
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:57.320]  They aborted a baby that was eight months old. I forget his name. You can look it up.
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:03.320]  He's got a digital name. He's got his cell line as a name. He never got a name like the black lady.
[02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:07.320]  He never got outside the womb. His mother aborted him because of birth defects.
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:11.320]  They did it for the health of the mother, not really abortion. I guess a procedure.
[02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:13.320]  Because I guess it's the health of the mother. It's not really of the...
[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:17.320]  They go, hey, the baby's basically dead in there and could kill you. You know, you need to get this out.
[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:21.320]  I mean, is that really abortion? I don't think it is. But the point, it's a medical procedure.
[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:27.320]  He died in utero. They pull him out. He's a tumor. And then they took that and said,
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:30.320]  boy, this is really special. Looked at it under a microscope and said,
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:38.320]  this guy is a new immortal cell line. So they got this guy and they got the black woman.
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:42.320]  And now they got something where they can throw a chunk of meat in a vat and come back in a month
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:48.320]  and you've got a thousand gallons of meat, human meat.
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:51.320]  But you want to call it cow so you mix it with some cow genes.
[02:42:51.320 --> 02:42:57.320]  Now you've got a chimera cell that's part cow, part human. It's a cancer blob.
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:04.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon, developed.
[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:08.320]  Dr. Jones natural's tumor toothpaste that just came into stock.

[02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:16.320]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth is insane.
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:21.320]  You know, turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and it's such great things for the body.
[02:43:21.320 --> 02:43:24.320]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:30.320]  It is just dynamite. It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.

[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:37.320]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distracting.
[02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:42.320]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:45.320]  What we want to do in Davos is push to reset but...
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:52.320]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.

[02:45:57.320 --> 02:46:01.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:04.320]  is a historic book that documents the globalists and their own words,
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:07.320]  planned for our future. That is the hellish future.
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:10.320]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess, they're starting to ban them,
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:13.320]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World
[02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:16.320]  at bookstores, amazon, or infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:22.320]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:24.320]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:30.320]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy at infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:34.320]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:37.320]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:40.320]  You'll also know that you help keep infowars on the air.
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:44.320]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:49.320]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarsstore.com and get a signed copy
[02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:54.320]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate it to the library or give them to the local school.
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:57.320]  This is an info war. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:05.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:34.320]  So if you ask yourself, why are they doing all this?
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:37.320]  And the answer is they want to be God.
[02:47:37.320 --> 02:47:40.320]  The elites of the planet have a prime directive.
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:46.320]  Discover the secrets of the universe at all costs and discover, live in such a technology, the Holy Grail.
[02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:53.320]  Now the Holy Grail is a mythical thing that Christ at the Last Supper drank out of.
[02:47:53.320 --> 02:48:02.320]  Then I guess some people say there's other ones where the soldier pierced his side and all the rest of it.
[02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:11.320]  But regardless, this is what the spear of destiny, they're actually trying to create the Holy Grail.
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:15.320]  This is the cult of the Holy Grail, you can call it.
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:19.320]  Or the cult of the Satanic Grail, the cult of the Grail of Lucifer.
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:23.320]  Eternal life.
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:31.320]  And in the process of trying to get eternal life, I would use the allegory of a really cheesy movie.
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:38.320]  Indiana Jones, The Last Crusade, where the Nazi finally gets in, he goes, the cup of Christ.
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:42.320]  He drinks it and it shrivels up and kills him.
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:48.320]  Maybe search engine YouTube, the Nazi drinks from the Holy Grail, but it was the Holy Grail.
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:50.320]  If you drink from the wrong Grail, it kills you.
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:52.320]  If you find the right Grail, it's eternal life.
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:55.320]  That's the Christian legend.
[02:48:55.320 --> 02:48:56.320]  It's not biblical.
[02:48:56.320 --> 02:48:58.320]  It's a made-up legend.
[02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:02.320]  But it's a metaphor for Christ and eternal life.
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:05.320]  Well, these people want that for themselves.
[02:49:05.320 --> 02:49:07.320]  So all of us don't count.
[02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:14.320]  They're greedily in a stampede, a gold rush for eternal life, and they're using us to guinea pig test everything.
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:18.320]  And they've been obsessed since they discovered in the 1950s.
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:20.320]  This woman sells.
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:25.320]  Everybody's probably seen the 1950s or 60s movie, The Blob.
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:26.320]  And they remade The Blob.
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:29.320]  Guys, pull up the original trailer for the original Blob.
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:30.320]  First, let's show this.
[02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:35.320]  Go ahead and play the audio if you can.
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:37.320]  Little if you can't, we'll get it later.
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:45.320]  And The Blob is a big cellular mass that absorbs you and eats you, a big amoeba.
[02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:47.320]  The backup started over.
[02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:49.320]  The backup started over.
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:54.320]  Go ahead.
[02:49:57.320 --> 02:49:59.320]  I'm not a historian.
[02:49:59.320 --> 02:50:01.320]  I have no idea what it looks like.
[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:03.320]  Which one is it?
[02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:06.320]  Let me choose.
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:08.320]  Thank you, Doctor.
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:22.320]  Oh, yes.
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:31.320]  Yes. It's more beautiful than I'd ever imagine.
[02:50:31.320 --> 02:50:47.320]  This certainly is the cup of the King of Kings.
[02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:55.320]  Eternal life.
[02:50:55.320 --> 02:50:57.320]  And this is the globalists.
[02:50:57.320 --> 02:51:02.320]  This is what they're going to get instead.
[02:51:28.320 --> 02:51:30.320]  The opposite of eternal life.
[02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:32.320]  What is happening to me?
[02:51:32.320 --> 02:51:34.320]  It's physical and spiritual death.
[02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:36.320]  It ain't nothing.
[02:51:36.320 --> 02:51:41.320]  What is happening to me?
[02:51:54.320 --> 02:51:56.320]  Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
[02:51:56.320 --> 02:52:05.320]  But the real thing, they believe, is these immortal cell lines.
[02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:10.320]  So these things never die.
[02:52:10.320 --> 02:52:11.320]  They replicate forever.
[02:52:11.320 --> 02:52:13.320]  They grow in basically nothing.
[02:52:13.320 --> 02:52:16.320]  You take a blob of it and throw it into a vat.
[02:52:16.320 --> 02:52:20.320]  You come back and there's just a giant blob.
[02:52:20.320 --> 02:52:23.320]  And that's what they're going to feed you along with bugs.
[02:52:23.320 --> 02:52:24.320]  That's true.
[02:52:24.320 --> 02:52:26.320]  That's happening now.
[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:28.320]  And we sit here and listen to Bill Gates
[02:52:28.320 --> 02:52:30.320]  because he spends billions of years
[02:52:30.320 --> 02:52:32.320]  buying off the media on record.
[02:52:32.320 --> 02:52:35.320]  Now, what type of demon says you'll drink sewage water,
[02:52:35.320 --> 02:52:38.320]  you will toilet to tap, you will eat bugs,
[02:52:38.320 --> 02:52:40.320]  and you will eat cancer blobs.
[02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:42.320]  And I know I keep obsessing on this,
[02:52:42.320 --> 02:52:44.320]  but it's like the animal-human hybrids.
[02:52:44.320 --> 02:52:46.320]  Let's play the trailer of the blob,
[02:52:46.320 --> 02:52:48.320]  because that's what these immortal cell lines are.
[02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:49.320]  Here it is.
[02:52:49.320 --> 02:52:51.320]  I respect that.
[02:52:51.320 --> 02:52:52.320]  What happened?
[02:52:52.320 --> 02:52:53.320]  It's over at this place.
[02:52:53.320 --> 02:52:54.320]  You've got to come now.
[02:52:54.320 --> 02:52:55.320]  Wait a minute, Steve.
[02:52:55.320 --> 02:52:56.320]  Tell us what happened.
[02:52:56.320 --> 02:52:57.320]  Well, I'm trying to tell you.
[02:52:57.320 --> 02:52:58.320]  Now, this thing had killed the doc.
[02:52:58.320 --> 02:53:00.320]  But what was it?
[02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:02.320]  Not with a kid.
[02:53:02.320 --> 02:53:05.320]  But it's kind of like a mess.
[02:53:05.320 --> 02:53:07.320]  It keeps getting bigger and bigger.
[02:53:13.320 --> 02:53:16.320]  Every one of you watching this screen, look out.
[02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:19.320]  Because soon, very soon, the most horrifying
[02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:21.320]  monster menace ever conceived
[02:53:21.320 --> 02:53:23.320]  will be oozing into this theater.
[02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:41.320]  Let's go further about the blob.
[02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:43.320]  When they discovered this lady,
[02:53:43.320 --> 02:53:45.320]  we'll put her back on screen a moment,
[02:53:45.320 --> 02:53:47.320]  these cells that never died,
[02:53:47.320 --> 02:53:50.320]  they began immediately putting it in vaccines
[02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:53.320]  and growing the vaccine product in it,
[02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:55.320]  even though it was a deadly virus,
[02:53:55.320 --> 02:53:58.320]  they know now, they even have the virus name,
[02:53:58.320 --> 02:54:02.320]  that caused the immortal cell line.
[02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:04.320]  And I've even read the bragging that they believe
[02:54:04.320 --> 02:54:08.320]  when billions of us are injected with Henrietta Lacks
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:10.320]  and this dead kid as well,
[02:54:10.320 --> 02:54:12.320]  this dead baby in the 70s,
[02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:17.320]  these are the 50s, that they will cause super mutations
[02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:19.320]  and they believe, create a new humanoid
[02:54:19.320 --> 02:54:22.320]  that survives the process
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:25.320]  of being given the blob injection.
[02:54:25.320 --> 02:54:28.320]  And I use a Hollywood example
[02:54:31.320 --> 02:54:33.320]  as a way to get this across,
[02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:35.320]  because it's the best way to describe it.
[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:44.320]  So why would they want to feed you live cancer cells?
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:46.320]  Well, why would they want to say males
[02:54:46.320 --> 02:54:48.320]  can participate in women's sports?
[02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:54.320]  Well, they want to cut off millions of little boys' penises.
[02:54:54.320 --> 02:54:56.320]  It's like watching Clive Barker's Hellraiser
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:54:58.320]  and saying, why are they doing this?
[02:54:58.320 --> 02:55:01.320]  Because they like it, they enjoy it.
[02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:07.320]  They are demonically inspired
[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:11.320]  to just do the most insane, dirty, crazy,
[02:55:11.320 --> 02:55:13.320]  out of control things that have Biden.
[02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:15.320]  You saw the clip yesterday, we didn't play it,
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:17.320]  maybe we'll play it next segment.
[02:55:17.320 --> 02:55:21.320]  Saying it's a sin not to cut these little boys' testicles off.
[02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:24.320]  These horrible people want to stop these children from this,
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:27.320]  having their testicles cut off.
[02:55:27.320 --> 02:55:30.320]  Again, just 10 years ago, if you showed up at a hospital
[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:32.320]  and said, I want my fingers cut off,
[02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:35.320]  they'd call a patty wagon to put you in a loony bin.
[02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:38.320]  But now, in Canada and other areas,
[02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:42.320]  oh, we just won't let you commit suicide
[02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:45.320]  for psychological reasons.
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:47.320]  We're going to encourage you to,
[02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:49.320]  and we're going to let your children as young as seven
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:51.320]  decide they want to die,
[02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:54.320]  and then the state's going to take your children and kill them.
[02:55:54.320 --> 02:55:57.320]  See, that sounds just as crazy
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:02.320]  as we're going to take a super-cancer cell
[02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:06.320]  that can only be killed in fire,
[02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:08.320]  never dies,
[02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:12.320]  and we're going to inject it in you so it can take you over
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:14.320]  so that we'll kill billions of you,
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:17.320]  but we believe mutations will come out of this,
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:19.320]  of a new entity.
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:22.320]  Where are they getting this?
[02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:25.320]  And that's why the cheesy 1990s movie,
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:27.320]  these seasons so important,
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:29.320]  because in that movie they got a radio telescope
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:31.320]  aimed out at a distant star,
[02:56:31.320 --> 02:56:33.320]  and they get a transmission
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:37.320]  that gives them the DNA gene sequence
[02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:41.320]  to create a new cell line,
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:43.320]  and it's a blob,
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:45.320]  and it escapes instantly when they make it,
[02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:47.320]  and they give it food,
[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:49.320]  they create the cell, they give it protein,
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:54.320]  and it breaks out, it gets out,
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:57.320]  and then runs off into the hinterland
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:57:00.320]  and starts trying to replicate.
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:04.320]  And that's my best analysis of this is,
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:07.320]  this is not human, all this stuff's not human,
[02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:09.320]  and it's not coming from flying saucers,
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:14.320]  it's a sub-third dimension carrier wave,
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:16.320]  as best I can tell from each study,
[02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:18.320]  of a transmission,
[02:57:18.320 --> 02:57:21.320]  and it's giving them these ideas and knowledge,
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:24.320]  and the stuff works, but it's all to kill us.
[02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:27.320]  So basically, it's like the old allegory of a genie,
[02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:29.320]  if you ask it for 5,000 pounds of gold,
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:31.320]  you'd better first say in front of me,
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:33.320]  not on top of me, because it'll drop it on top of you.
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:36.320]  So they're like, give me 5,000 pounds of gold, you get it,
[02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:38.320]  boom, on top of your ass.
[02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:40.320]  And this is alien, folks,
[02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:44.320]  we're being sent alien transmissions interdimensional.
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:49.320]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:51.320]  we have a new toothpaste
[02:57:51.320 --> 02:57:54.320]  that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon, developed.
[02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:57.320]  Dr. Jones Natural's turmeric toothpaste
[02:57:57.320 --> 02:57:59.320]  that just came into stock.
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:01.320]  And I gotta tell you, I got samples for this month's ago,
[02:58:01.320 --> 02:58:02.320]  and it is amazing.
[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:04.320]  The way it makes your gums feel,
[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:06.320]  what it does to your mouth is insane.
[02:58:06.320 --> 02:58:09.320]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory,
[02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:11.320]  it does such great things for the body.
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:13.320]  Then you add that with tea tree oil
[02:58:13.320 --> 02:58:15.320]  and a bunch of other essential oils,
[02:58:15.320 --> 02:58:16.320]  it is just dynamite.
[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:20.320]  If you feel good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth,
[02:58:20.320 --> 02:58:23.320]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste
[02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:24.320]  at infowarstore.com.
[02:58:24.320 --> 02:58:27.320]  Dr. Jones Natural's turmeric toothpaste.
[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:28.320]  And while you're at it,
[02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:30.320]  check out the new Oshwagandha line of products.
[02:58:30.320 --> 02:58:32.320]  We have Oshwagandha with black pepper extract,
[02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:35.320]  fear libido, your testosterone in pill form,
[02:58:35.320 --> 02:58:39.320]  and we have the pure Oshwagandha root gummies as well,
[02:58:39.320 --> 02:58:41.320]  now available at infowarstore.com.
[02:58:41.320 --> 02:58:42.320]  They're amazing products,
[02:58:42.320 --> 02:58:43.320]  and they fund the info war.

[02:58:48.320 --> 02:58:52.320]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners
[02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:54.320]  that have gone to infowarstore.com
[02:58:54.320 --> 02:58:56.320]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life,
[02:58:56.320 --> 02:58:58.320]  that empower your immune system and your body,

[02:59:00.320 --> 02:59:02.320]  I am humbly, pat in hand,
[02:59:02.320 --> 02:59:04.320]  talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in,
[02:59:04.320 --> 02:59:06.320]  many of you for years,
[02:59:06.320 --> 02:59:08.320]  and never gone to infowarstore.com.
[02:59:08.320 --> 02:59:11.320]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you
[02:59:11.320 --> 02:59:13.320]  never actually go to infowarstore.com
[02:59:13.320 --> 02:59:15.320]  and never experience these great products
[02:59:15.320 --> 02:59:17.320]  and never find the operation.
[02:59:17.320 --> 02:59:19.320]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article,
[02:59:19.320 --> 02:59:21.320]  you tell folks about the show, that's great, and I thank you.
[02:59:21.320 --> 02:59:23.320]  But we need funds to operate,
[02:59:23.320 --> 02:59:25.320]  plus we've got really great products
[02:59:25.320 --> 02:59:27.320]  that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil
[02:59:27.320 --> 02:59:29.320]  and our fizzy magnesium and our sweet bait
[02:59:29.320 --> 02:59:31.320]  and our nitric oxide and our real Red Pill Plus.
[02:59:31.320 --> 02:59:33.320]  All of these are really great products.
[02:59:33.320 --> 02:59:34.320]  They keep us on air,
[02:59:34.320 --> 02:59:36.320]  plus you're missing out on having these products.
[02:59:36.320 --> 02:59:38.320]  So get off the bench, get in the game,
[02:59:38.320 --> 02:59:39.320]  step to the plate,
[02:59:39.320 --> 02:59:42.320]  and go to infowarstore.com right now
[02:59:42.320 --> 02:59:44.320]  and get these great info wars products
[02:59:44.320 --> 02:59:46.320]  at infowarstore.com.
[02:59:50.320 --> 02:59:53.320]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[02:59:53.320 --> 02:59:55.320]  you are the resistance.
[02:59:59.320 --> 03:00:01.320]  You can feel it.
[03:00:01.320 --> 03:00:03.320]  Oh, you can feel it.
[03:00:03.320 --> 03:00:05.320]  You can taste it.
[03:00:05.320 --> 03:00:07.320]  Oh, you can taste it.
[03:00:07.320 --> 03:00:09.320]  You can see it.
[03:00:09.320 --> 03:00:11.320]  Oh, yeah.
[03:00:12.320 --> 03:00:14.320]  You can taste it.
[03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:16.320]  We can taste it.
[03:00:17.320 --> 03:00:18.320]  You can hear it.
[03:00:18.320 --> 03:00:21.320]  See, there's not just an enemy transmission.
[03:00:21.320 --> 03:00:23.320]  We're getting here.
[03:00:23.320 --> 03:00:25.320]  There is a higher transmission
[03:00:25.320 --> 03:00:27.320]  from the 12th dimension.
[03:00:27.320 --> 03:00:29.320]  And I'm not just telling you this,
[03:00:29.320 --> 03:00:31.320]  just decades of researching the enemy
[03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:33.320]  and what they know, what their secrets are
[03:00:33.320 --> 03:00:35.320]  and what they're pissed off about.
[03:00:35.320 --> 03:00:37.320]  They've received 12th dimension transmissions.
[03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:39.320]  The Holy Spirit is a 12th dimensional,
[03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:41.320]  complete transmission from God.
[03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:48.320]  I intended to come on here today
[03:00:48.320 --> 03:00:50.320]  and really unlock a major secret with people,
[03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:52.320]  but it was so big.
[03:00:53.320 --> 03:00:55.320]  I told my wife about it last night
[03:00:55.320 --> 03:00:57.320]  and it completely freaked her out.
[03:01:00.320 --> 03:01:02.320]  And I understand why I did.
[03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:04.320]  Because everybody already knows this,
[03:01:04.320 --> 03:01:07.320]  but if you do it and if you...
[03:01:07.320 --> 03:01:09.320]  I don't want to call it meditate,
[03:01:09.320 --> 03:01:11.320]  but focus on this question.
[03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:15.320]  With the intent of love and justice and truth
[03:01:15.320 --> 03:01:17.320]  and wanting to save humanity
[03:01:17.320 --> 03:01:19.320]  and wanting to work for God
[03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:22.320]  and you ask God not to give you things,
[03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:24.320]  but to open things up
[03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:26.320]  and simply say,
[03:01:30.320 --> 03:01:32.320]  if there was nothing before,
[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:34.320]  how could there be nothing?
[03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:38.320]  Not just the mystery of the universe,
[03:01:38.320 --> 03:01:40.320]  the mystery of life where we came from,
[03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:42.320]  but what if there was nothing?
[03:01:42.320 --> 03:01:44.320]  Well, nothing is still something.
[03:01:44.320 --> 03:01:46.320]  What if there was no God?
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:48.320]  How could there be nothing anywhere,
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:50.320]  anytime, any place?
[03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:52.320]  What would there be?
[03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:54.320]  Not in galaxies, not in dimensions,
[03:01:54.320 --> 03:01:56.320]  not in 12th dimension, not in 1st dimension,
[03:01:56.320 --> 03:01:58.320]  not in sideways dimensions, not in multiverses.
[03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:00.320]  And I understand everybody's probably had
[03:02:00.320 --> 03:02:02.320]  thought or focused on that,
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:06.320]  but focus on that question to God
[03:02:08.320 --> 03:02:11.320]  and you're going to then run into God.
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:17.320]  And the enemies of humans all know this
[03:02:19.320 --> 03:02:21.320]  and they understand it,
[03:02:21.320 --> 03:02:23.320]  but it's in that question
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:26.320]  of forcing your soul up against the void
[03:02:26.320 --> 03:02:31.320]  or the black centrifugal hourglass
[03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:38.320]  that you will open the space-time continuum
[03:02:38.320 --> 03:02:41.320]  to the quiet place the most time.
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:43.320]  Now, the leftists see this and go,
[03:02:43.320 --> 03:02:46.320]  Jones is having a psychotic break to make jokes about it,
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:48.320]  but then I get invited
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:52.320]  to the top Illuminati meetings,
[03:02:52.320 --> 03:02:55.320]  all of them, with the richest people on Earth.
[03:02:55.320 --> 03:02:57.320]  And this has been a long time.
[03:02:57.320 --> 03:02:59.320]  I refused it many times.
[03:02:59.320 --> 03:03:01.320]  The private, wide-bodied jet is picking you up.
[03:03:01.320 --> 03:03:03.320]  We're having the ritual on this date.
[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:05.320]  We want you to be there.
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:07.320]  We have the top 30 religious leaders there.
[03:03:07.320 --> 03:03:09.320]  We surveyed them and they believe
[03:03:09.320 --> 03:03:11.320]  that you're one of the key people that needs to be there.
[03:03:11.320 --> 03:03:13.320]  They want you to take part in the ritual.
[03:03:13.320 --> 03:03:15.320]  Lucifer is actually good.
[03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:17.320]  We're going to fire the light beam and access it.
[03:03:17.320 --> 03:03:19.320]  I had three different world-famous people,
[03:03:19.320 --> 03:03:21.320]  world-famous,
[03:03:21.320 --> 03:03:23.320]  starting 20 years ago,
[03:03:23.320 --> 03:03:25.320]  18 years ago,
[03:03:25.320 --> 03:03:27.320]  and 15 years ago.
[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:29.320]  Give me calls
[03:03:29.320 --> 03:03:31.320]  and ask me
[03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:33.320]  to go take part in this ritual
[03:03:33.320 --> 03:03:35.320]  in three different places in the world.
[03:03:37.320 --> 03:03:39.320]  One in Reykjavik,
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:41.320]  one in Peru,
[03:03:41.320 --> 03:03:43.320]  and one in southern England.
[03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:47.320]  So, let the left run around and joke.
[03:03:47.320 --> 03:03:49.320]  They're just the gremlins, the millions, they don't know.
[03:03:49.320 --> 03:03:51.320]  This is 100% real.
[03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:53.320]  And these people don't have omnipresent control.
[03:03:55.320 --> 03:03:57.320]  But they are able
[03:03:57.320 --> 03:03:59.320]  to see almost into the future
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:01.320]  and have incredible powers of understanding
[03:04:01.320 --> 03:04:03.320]  just because they know this information.
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:05.320]  And I didn't know why
[03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:07.320]  in the space-time continuum,
[03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:09.320]  all these years ago,
[03:04:09.320 --> 03:04:11.320]  they were so obsessed with me.
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:13.320]  But you can see now
[03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:15.320]  why, but it's not just Alan Jones.
[03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:17.320]  It's all of you
[03:04:17.320 --> 03:04:19.320]  unlocking your minds to that transmission.
[03:04:19.320 --> 03:04:21.320]  The Holy Spirit is a
[03:04:21.320 --> 03:04:23.320]  spiritual broadcast.
[03:04:23.320 --> 03:04:25.320]  It is a transmission from God's
[03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:27.320]  mind and soul and body
[03:04:27.320 --> 03:04:29.320]  to you
[03:04:29.320 --> 03:04:31.320]  about plans that empower us
[03:04:31.320 --> 03:04:33.320]  and build the future in our development.
[03:04:33.320 --> 03:04:35.320]  The enemy plans
[03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:37.320]  will build incredible things,
[03:04:37.320 --> 03:04:39.320]  but all of them
[03:04:39.320 --> 03:04:41.320]  lead to destruction and annihilation.
[03:04:41.320 --> 03:04:43.320]  All right.
[03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:45.320]  I'm going to end this transmission.
[03:04:45.320 --> 03:04:47.320]  Annabaton of the guest host is doing a great job.
[03:04:47.320 --> 03:04:49.320]  I want to show yours up in about 55 minutes
[03:04:49.320 --> 03:04:51.320]  infowars.com.
[03:04:59.320 --> 03:05:02.320]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life.
[03:05:02.320 --> 03:05:04.320]  And Info Wars
[03:05:04.320 --> 03:05:06.320]  for decades has been at the very forefront
[03:05:06.320 --> 03:05:09.320]  of the fight for a pro-human future.
[03:05:09.320 --> 03:05:11.320]  We can't stay on air without your help.

[03:05:19.320 --> 03:05:21.320]  these products really are.
[03:05:21.320 --> 03:05:23.320]  Ultimate Bone Broth finally sold out for over two years
[03:05:23.320 --> 03:05:25.320]  back in stock.
[03:05:25.320 --> 03:05:27.320]  Real Red Pill Plus, simply amazing.
[03:05:27.320 --> 03:05:29.320]  Nitric boosts what it does for your heart.
[03:05:29.320 --> 03:05:31.320]  Cardiovascular, critical.
[03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:33.320]  All these products, like Ultimate Crill Oil,
[03:05:33.320 --> 03:05:35.320]  Ultimate Fish Oil, Supermelt Vitality,

[03:05:41.320 --> 03:05:43.320]  signed copies of my book,
[03:05:43.320 --> 03:05:45.320]  and I'm not going to sign any more after that,
[03:05:45.320 --> 03:05:48.320]  are exclusively available at infowarstore.com as well.
[03:05:48.320 --> 03:05:50.320]  In the last month, I got a little busy,
[03:05:50.320 --> 03:05:52.320]  so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them for sale.
[03:05:52.320 --> 03:05:54.320]  But now I sign the last books, you can get them right now.
[03:05:54.320 --> 03:05:56.320]  Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
[03:06:02.320 --> 03:06:04.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:04.320 --> 03:06:06.320]  What a great show today.
[03:06:06.320 --> 03:06:08.320]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from KateDallyRadio.com.
[03:06:08.320 --> 03:06:10.320]  Dr. Limerit will be joining me
[03:06:10.320 --> 03:06:12.320]  in this hour pretty soon here.
[03:06:12.320 --> 03:06:14.320]  And let me tell you, we have a lot to talk about.
[03:06:14.320 --> 03:06:17.320]  She wants to give her consensus
[03:06:17.320 --> 03:06:19.320]  on what happened in Ohio,
[03:06:19.320 --> 03:06:23.320]  and also the Wuhan lab leak.
[03:06:23.320 --> 03:06:25.320]  So many things to chat about today.
[03:06:25.320 --> 03:06:27.320]  You know, yesterday I was looking at,
[03:06:27.320 --> 03:06:29.320]  I just wanted to share this with you real fast,
[03:06:29.320 --> 03:06:31.320]  because it was a thought that crossed my mind,
[03:06:31.320 --> 03:06:33.320]  and I thought, this is kind of strange.
[03:06:33.320 --> 03:06:35.320]  But number one, I wanted to share with you
[03:06:35.320 --> 03:06:39.320]  that there was yet another article from the Pentagon.
[03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:41.320]  I'm going to need a lot more caffeine and sedatives
[03:06:41.320 --> 03:06:43.320]  to keep up with the new cycle
[03:06:43.320 --> 03:06:45.320]  of the hardcore lefty communist globalist,
[03:06:45.320 --> 03:06:48.320]  because I tell you what, it's like whiplash every day.
[03:06:48.320 --> 03:06:50.320]  But we're getting all these new aliens,
[03:06:50.320 --> 03:06:53.320]  and you know how I feel about aliens, please.
[03:06:53.320 --> 03:06:56.320]  Anyway, we're getting a lot more of the Pentagon
[03:06:56.320 --> 03:06:59.320]  saying aliens are in the perimeter, we think.
[03:06:59.320 --> 03:07:02.320]  Possibly. They're probably out there, possibly.
[03:07:02.320 --> 03:07:05.320]  After all the years of denying, okay?
[03:07:05.320 --> 03:07:07.320]  And so, yes, they're playing the game pretty hardcore.
[03:07:07.320 --> 03:07:11.320]  Werner won, what was his name? Werner.
[03:07:11.320 --> 03:07:13.320]  Werner von Braun was actually probably right.
[03:07:13.320 --> 03:07:15.320]  Once they got rid of domestic terrorism,
[03:07:15.320 --> 03:07:18.320]  or not domestic, but just terrorism in general.
[03:07:18.320 --> 03:07:20.320]  You know the creation of ISIS by Obama,
[03:07:20.320 --> 03:07:23.320]  that with their little matching tennis shoes
[03:07:23.320 --> 03:07:25.320]  and their little matching Toyota trucks,
[03:07:25.320 --> 03:07:27.320]  that once that burned out, they would use aliens.
[03:07:27.320 --> 03:07:29.320]  And you know what I thought about?
[03:07:29.320 --> 03:07:30.320]  Can I share this with you?
[03:07:30.320 --> 03:07:33.320]  I thought about the fact that since,
[03:07:33.320 --> 03:07:35.320]  in the last two decades, since all of us
[03:07:35.320 --> 03:07:37.320]  have been strapped down with our phones,
[03:07:37.320 --> 03:07:39.320]  close to our bodies, everywhere we go,
[03:07:39.320 --> 03:07:41.320]  our little tracking devices.
[03:07:41.320 --> 03:07:43.320]  But we also have really good cell phones
[03:07:43.320 --> 03:07:46.320]  and really good video opportunities to take video now,
[03:07:46.320 --> 03:07:49.320]  wherever we are, for whatever event pops up.
[03:07:49.320 --> 03:07:51.320]  Don't you find it kind of interesting
[03:07:51.320 --> 03:07:53.320]  that all of those alien abductions
[03:07:53.320 --> 03:07:56.320]  of the guys out in the field sitting in their flatbed
[03:07:56.320 --> 03:07:58.320]  that got beamed up to the spaceship
[03:07:58.320 --> 03:08:01.320]  with the little green guys and anally probed
[03:08:01.320 --> 03:08:03.320]  for, like, let's say, hours.
[03:08:03.320 --> 03:08:06.320]  Isn't it kind of amazing that that hasn't taken place
[03:08:06.320 --> 03:08:10.320]  since we got cell phones with great cameras?
[03:08:10.320 --> 03:08:14.320]  Since we have the ability to videotape these people?
[03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:17.320]  Hmm. Gee, I wonder.
[03:08:17.320 --> 03:08:18.320]  I guess you know when you look back
[03:08:18.320 --> 03:08:19.320]  and you look back at that little
[03:08:19.320 --> 03:08:22.320]  110 fuzzy little flat camera we used to have,
[03:08:22.320 --> 03:08:25.320]  and you know, you're trying to search for a camera
[03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:27.320]  if you saw some spaceship in the sky
[03:08:27.320 --> 03:08:29.320]  with little green people wanting to beam you up
[03:08:29.320 --> 03:08:32.320]  and probe you for hours on end for no particular reason at all
[03:08:32.320 --> 03:08:34.320]  and then dump you back in a field,
[03:08:34.320 --> 03:08:36.320]  I think it's kind of amazing that ever since we've had
[03:08:36.320 --> 03:08:40.320]  cell phone coverage with phones and video,
[03:08:40.320 --> 03:08:42.320]  really good phones, actually.
[03:08:42.320 --> 03:08:44.320]  Like, the pixels would be pretty darn good
[03:08:44.320 --> 03:08:46.320]  to capture this, right?
[03:08:46.320 --> 03:08:48.320]  I haven't heard anyone say they've been abducted
[03:08:48.320 --> 03:08:51.320]  by aliens in the last 20 years.
[03:08:51.320 --> 03:08:54.320]  Hmm. Makes one think, doesn't it?
[03:08:54.320 --> 03:08:57.320]  Makes one think. Yeah, the Pentagon officials,
[03:08:57.320 --> 03:08:59.320]  they claim alien motherships are out there.
[03:08:59.320 --> 03:09:02.320]  Hmm. Just in their prim.
[03:09:02.320 --> 03:09:04.320]  I just wanted to share that with you
[03:09:04.320 --> 03:09:06.320]  because I hadn't really thought about that before.
[03:09:06.320 --> 03:09:09.320]  And I thought, wow, we are really in a strange place.
[03:09:09.320 --> 03:09:11.320]  Are we not?
[03:09:11.320 --> 03:09:14.320]  We're really in a strange, odd world right now.
[03:09:14.320 --> 03:09:17.320]  But sometimes we just need to apply some common sense.
[03:09:17.320 --> 03:09:20.320]  Sometimes we just need to apply some actual reason.
[03:09:20.320 --> 03:09:22.320]  Not reasoning based on emotion.
[03:09:22.320 --> 03:09:24.320]  That's what the leftist hardcore lefties do.
[03:09:24.320 --> 03:09:27.320]  But just reason.
[03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:31.320]  The minute we had the ability to actually film something
[03:09:31.320 --> 03:09:35.320]  with, you know, not 1950 technology,
[03:09:35.320 --> 03:09:37.320]  it doesn't happen.
[03:09:37.320 --> 03:09:39.320]  It's just gone.
[03:09:39.320 --> 03:09:41.320]  And here's the other thing I wanted to share with you too.
[03:09:41.320 --> 03:09:44.320]  Because this insight came and I thought,
[03:09:44.320 --> 03:09:47.320]  I might have this different insight on what's going on
[03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:49.320]  with the banking.
[03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:52.320]  But it seems to me there's a whole lot of gaslighting going on.
[03:09:52.320 --> 03:09:54.320]  And when we have a lot of gaslighting
[03:09:54.320 --> 03:09:57.320]  and the press is not ignoring something
[03:09:57.320 --> 03:10:00.320]  but doing the drumbeat of the bank failure,
[03:10:00.320 --> 03:10:04.320]  I thought, you know, they realized under COVID-19
[03:10:04.320 --> 03:10:08.320]  all they had to do was say the word COVID or fluvid.
[03:10:08.320 --> 03:10:11.320]  And we would mask ourselves.
[03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:14.320]  For three solid years there are still those relentless warriors
[03:10:14.320 --> 03:10:17.320]  out there saving the planet in the grocery store with the mask on,
[03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:19.320]  even though they don't even have a cold.
[03:10:19.320 --> 03:10:21.320]  And I'm watching.
[03:10:21.320 --> 03:10:25.320]  So rest, rest, please, you've done your part.
[03:10:25.320 --> 03:10:30.320]  Please take off the mask, weary soldier, you've done your thing.
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:34.320]  Anyway, I was looking back at how quickly we fell for it,
[03:10:34.320 --> 03:10:40.320]  how much we decided that we were going to do on our own.
[03:10:40.320 --> 03:10:45.320]  All they have to do is do a little bit of a drumbeat of bank failure.
[03:10:45.320 --> 03:10:48.320]  And we would perform the run on the banks.
[03:10:48.320 --> 03:10:50.320]  They wouldn't even have to do any heavy lifting.
[03:10:50.320 --> 03:10:52.320]  We would trash our own economy.
[03:10:52.320 --> 03:10:55.320]  We would do it to ourselves because of the fear.
[03:10:55.320 --> 03:10:58.320]  The Silicon Bank only had 17 branches.
[03:10:58.320 --> 03:11:03.320]  We've had almost 5,000 banks go under since 1999.
[03:11:03.320 --> 03:11:05.320]  That's a whole lot of banks.
[03:11:05.320 --> 03:11:08.320]  How come that wasn't making the news like this is?
[03:11:08.320 --> 03:11:11.320]  I'm tired of being gaslighted and tired of people telling me
[03:11:11.320 --> 03:11:15.320]  I have to be and live in fear every five seconds, right?
[03:11:15.320 --> 03:11:18.320]  But it sells.
[03:11:18.320 --> 03:11:24.320]  And yeah, we know that the economy at some point is going to go south.
[03:11:24.320 --> 03:11:28.320]  But wouldn't it be brilliant of them to realize that all they have to do
[03:11:28.320 --> 03:11:32.320]  is say the word and we do it to ourselves?
[03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:34.320]  Most of the country is conservative.
[03:11:34.320 --> 03:11:36.320]  Most of the country is going to listen.
[03:11:36.320 --> 03:11:39.320]  Most of the country is expecting this.
[03:11:39.320 --> 03:11:41.320]  We have a fake in the White House.
[03:11:41.320 --> 03:11:43.320]  We have a total fraudulent administration.
[03:11:43.320 --> 03:11:47.320]  We have all kinds of hooligans running the sham show.
[03:11:47.320 --> 03:11:51.320]  So, of course, all they have to do because they've learned,
[03:11:51.320 --> 03:11:52.320]  we'll do it to ourselves.
[03:11:52.320 --> 03:11:53.320]  We'll close our own businesses.
[03:11:53.320 --> 03:11:55.320]  We'll lock down our own selves.
[03:11:55.320 --> 03:11:57.320]  We'll barricade our own selves in our houses.
[03:11:57.320 --> 03:11:59.320]  We don't even need direction anymore.
[03:11:59.320 --> 03:12:03.320]  We'll mask ourselves even though it doesn't make sense.
[03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:07.320]  We'll put ourselves in harm's way and pony ourselves up for a shot.
[03:12:07.320 --> 03:12:08.320]  Why?
[03:12:08.320 --> 03:12:10.320]  Because they told us to.
[03:12:10.320 --> 03:12:12.320]  They didn't even give us any evidence to do it.
[03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:14.320]  They just told us to.
[03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:16.320]  So we're the willing soldier, right?
[03:12:16.320 --> 03:12:17.320]  We just do it.
[03:12:17.320 --> 03:12:23.320]  So, this whole thing about the banking is anyone out there saying,
[03:12:23.320 --> 03:12:29.320]  hey, almost 5,000 banks went under 4,800 banks since 1999?
[03:12:29.320 --> 03:12:33.320]  We have to have some context here, right?
[03:12:33.320 --> 03:12:37.320]  They have to make it look like, oh, how are we going to solve this problem?
[03:12:37.320 --> 03:12:38.320]  It's not FDIC insured.
[03:12:38.320 --> 03:12:41.320]  How are we going to solve it?
[03:12:41.320 --> 03:12:42.320]  Good grief.
[03:12:42.320 --> 03:12:45.320]  There have been banks that have gone under.
[03:12:45.320 --> 03:12:47.320]  It doesn't mean it's not going to happen.
[03:12:47.320 --> 03:12:48.320]  It doesn't mean anything.
[03:12:48.320 --> 03:12:51.320]  You should actually always be buying gold and silver.
[03:12:51.320 --> 03:12:53.320]  You should always have cash in your home.
[03:12:53.320 --> 03:12:58.320]  You should always shore up and have food storage, no matter what.
[03:12:58.320 --> 03:13:00.320]  Because we don't know what's coming next.
[03:13:00.320 --> 03:13:04.320]  And there are stupid enough people in this universe to go and do major runs on the banks
[03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:08.320]  so they would create an economic problem where, voila, of course,
[03:13:08.320 --> 03:13:10.320]  the only solution would be digital currency.
[03:13:10.320 --> 03:13:14.320]  It would be the only solution offered, okay?
[03:13:14.320 --> 03:13:20.320]  So, looking at this whole scenario, we have to resist the gaslight.
[03:13:20.320 --> 03:13:22.320]  We have got to say, you know what?
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:24.320]  No, no, you're not going to sell me on that.
[03:13:24.320 --> 03:13:27.320]  Because I'm not going to go and do the heavy lifting
[03:13:27.320 --> 03:13:29.320]  so you can implement your little digital currency.
[03:13:29.320 --> 03:13:34.320]  South Dakota said no to digital currency in a lot of ways.
[03:13:34.320 --> 03:13:39.320]  But in 20 states, what they did was they passed the UCC code update,
[03:13:39.320 --> 03:13:41.320]  the Uniform Commercial Code Update.
[03:13:41.320 --> 03:13:44.320]  When they did that in the states, it looked like something innocuous,
[03:13:44.320 --> 03:13:46.320]  something that was no big deal.
[03:13:46.320 --> 03:13:48.320]  But actually, there was many, many ways.
[03:13:48.320 --> 03:13:53.320]  My state did this, too, where they introduced the digital currency,
[03:13:53.320 --> 03:13:56.320]  blobby gook advisory board, you know,
[03:13:56.320 --> 03:14:00.320]  trying to kind of set up the train tracks even more so
[03:14:00.320 --> 03:14:03.320]  to infiltrate and get digital currency into each state.
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:06.320]  They're laying the train tracks right now.
[03:14:06.320 --> 03:14:09.320]  And what we need to do is be very, very, very vigilant
[03:14:09.320 --> 03:14:12.320]  in fighting this county to county to county.
[03:14:12.320 --> 03:14:15.320]  There's over just over 3,000 counties, 3,100 and something,
[03:14:15.320 --> 03:14:17.320]  some changed counties all across America.
[03:14:17.320 --> 03:14:19.320]  So what we need to do is fight that in our counties,
[03:14:19.320 --> 03:14:21.320]  fight that in our states.
[03:14:21.320 --> 03:14:23.320]  Are they using COVID bucks?
[03:14:23.320 --> 03:14:26.320]  What happened to all that COVID money, by the way?
[03:14:26.320 --> 03:14:28.320]  The states aren't talking about it. Have you noticed that?
[03:14:28.320 --> 03:14:32.320]  My state took in $105 billion and it disappeared.
[03:14:32.320 --> 03:14:34.320]  At first, there was a website for the money.
[03:14:34.320 --> 03:14:36.320]  Not so much anymore.
[03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:38.320]  So are they using that money for this?
[03:14:38.320 --> 03:14:41.320]  I don't know, but they are implementing.
[03:14:41.320 --> 03:14:43.320]  They are putting train tracks down.
[03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:45.320]  We know it's coming, but you know what?
[03:14:45.320 --> 03:14:49.320]  I don't want to be the person that sets the stage for them
[03:14:49.320 --> 03:14:52.320]  to bring in their little so-called solution.
[03:14:52.320 --> 03:14:54.320]  Make them do the heavy lifting.
[03:14:54.320 --> 03:14:57.320]  See, if they do it this way, they're not the bad guy, right?
[03:14:57.320 --> 03:15:00.320]  We can't point to them like we could at the Depression.
[03:15:00.320 --> 03:15:03.320]  And by the way, that whole thing was conjured up.
[03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:06.320]  That whole thing was organized, manipulated.
[03:15:06.320 --> 03:15:08.320]  Great depression didn't just happen.
[03:15:08.320 --> 03:15:12.320]  It had to happen in order to solidify central banking that came in.
[03:15:12.320 --> 03:15:15.320]  The hoodlums knew exactly what they were doing, the criminals.
[03:15:15.320 --> 03:15:20.320]  So, looking at this whole scenario, I just don't want to help them.
[03:15:20.320 --> 03:15:22.320]  I guess is my point.
[03:15:22.320 --> 03:15:25.320]  When we come back, I want to come back with Dr. Lee Merritt.
[03:15:25.320 --> 03:15:28.320]  I want to talk about so many things with Lee,
[03:15:28.320 --> 03:15:30.320]  because she is a fantastic voice out there,
[03:15:30.320 --> 03:15:33.320]  talking about the truth and health and everything else.
[03:15:33.320 --> 03:15:37.320]  And, man, is she a fun guest. So, we'll come back with her on the Alex Jones show.
[03:15:37.320 --> 03:15:39.320]  But let me tell you, there's some things to think about.
[03:15:39.320 --> 03:15:41.320]  We need to apply common sense and reasoning.
[03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:47.320]  Resist the gaslighting and really look at things from a common sense point of view now.
[03:15:47.320 --> 03:15:50.320]  I'll be right back on the Alex Jones show.
[03:15:50.320 --> 03:15:51.320]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:51.320 --> 03:16:14.320]  I'm Kay Deli, your guest host for the hour.
[03:16:14.320 --> 03:16:21.320]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed.
[03:16:21.320 --> 03:16:27.320]  Autocrats only understand one word, no, no, no.
[03:16:27.320 --> 03:16:31.320]  Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[03:16:31.320 --> 03:16:35.320]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[03:16:35.320 --> 03:16:37.320]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[03:16:37.320 --> 03:16:40.320]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[03:16:40.320 --> 03:16:43.320]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[03:16:43.320 --> 03:16:46.320]  We say no to you getting us into World War III. You're right.
[03:16:46.320 --> 03:16:49.320]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[03:16:49.320 --> 03:17:17.320]  And we say no. And we say no to your war.
[03:17:17.320 --> 03:17:23.320]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to mforestore.com
[03:17:23.320 --> 03:17:26.320]  and never experience these great products and never find the operation.

[03:17:56.320 --> 03:17:59.320]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[03:17:59.320 --> 03:18:04.320]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny.
[03:18:04.320 --> 03:18:09.320]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication. It takes commitment.

[03:19:47.320 --> 03:19:51.320]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them for sale.
[03:19:51.320 --> 03:20:09.320]  I signed the last books, you get them right down.
[03:20:22.320 --> 03:20:27.320]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show today. I'm Kate Dolly, your guest host.
[03:20:27.320 --> 03:20:33.320]  You know, Dr. Merritt completed, you know, her round with the United States Navy
[03:20:33.320 --> 03:20:36.320]  and served nine years as a Navy physician and surgeon.
[03:20:36.320 --> 03:20:42.320]  She has been in the private practice of orthopedic spinal surgery since 1995,
[03:20:42.320 --> 03:20:50.320]  served on the board of Arizona Medical Association, past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
[03:20:50.320 --> 03:20:53.320]  Her great website is TheMedicalRebel.com.
[03:20:53.320 --> 03:20:57.320]  Dr. Lee Merritt was the one that helped me get my husband out of the hospital alive.
[03:20:57.320 --> 03:21:03.320]  The only reason I'm not a widow right now was Dr. Lee Merritt, and what a warrior she has been.
[03:21:03.320 --> 03:21:11.320]  You know, she has been in this fight since the beginning, telling people what they could do for their health.
[03:21:11.320 --> 03:21:17.320]  And, you know, you're not in a pandemic if it's so easily solved with vitamin C, D and zinc.
[03:21:17.320 --> 03:21:23.320]  We sometimes, we kind of lose sight of those types of things and we don't realize that
[03:21:23.320 --> 03:21:28.320]  in the common sense that I was just talking about, in that whole common sense place,
[03:21:28.320 --> 03:21:35.320]  where you go, wait a minute, now wait a minute, this is not a disease if this can be handled so quickly.
[03:21:35.320 --> 03:21:40.320]  And my husband was out of the hospital in, my gosh, he was out of the ICU in three days,
[03:21:40.320 --> 03:21:44.320]  out of the hospital in five and golfing on the night of the fifth day,
[03:21:44.320 --> 03:21:51.320]  all due to the efforts of these wonderful doctors, these wonderful doctors who made that happen.
[03:21:51.320 --> 03:21:56.320]  Because I actually had access to them and could ask them, you know, what do I do in this situation?
[03:21:56.320 --> 03:22:04.320]  I leaned on good medical help. I leaned on really good doctors to pave the way for that and to make that happen.
[03:22:04.320 --> 03:22:11.320]  That was a big deal in seeing that for the first time and realizing that we were in a state of socialized health care.
[03:22:11.320 --> 03:22:18.320]  And that this socialized health care had taken over and had been rooted in, I think in some ways we didn't realize
[03:22:18.320 --> 03:22:30.320]  when Obamacare came in that it was going to be medical directives straight from the NIH, right, to us.
[03:22:30.320 --> 03:22:37.320]  Straight from the NIH to the doctors who would not have a say in doctoring anymore.
[03:22:37.320 --> 03:22:44.320]  They would not be able to tell you what to do anymore. They would be given a list of things that they were to do.
[03:22:44.320 --> 03:22:49.320]  And that's what happened when they shifted to Obamacare, but people weren't talking about it.
[03:22:49.320 --> 03:22:54.320]  And if you've noticed our own Republican Party won't say a word about it today.
[03:22:54.320 --> 03:23:02.320]  They don't say anything about the socialized medicine now rooted into America so deeply that if you go to the hospital,
[03:23:02.320 --> 03:23:11.320]  you feel like you don't have any rights anymore and you feel like you have to take the medical advice from the NIH,
[03:23:11.320 --> 03:23:17.320]  because that's basically the blanketed new perspective that's going on in all the hospitals today.
[03:23:17.320 --> 03:23:21.320]  My guest, Dr. Lee Merritt, welcome to the show. How are you?
[03:23:21.320 --> 03:23:28.320]  Hey, good. Thanks. I'm sorry. There's this weird leg. I don't know what's going on.
[03:23:28.320 --> 03:23:33.320]  I need a 10-year-old to help me with technology.
[03:23:33.320 --> 03:23:37.320]  Oh, my gosh, the technology.
[03:23:37.320 --> 03:23:42.320]  I don't know why my voice is lagging, so I apologize. I don't know what to do.
[03:23:42.320 --> 03:23:44.320]  I don't know if it's my...
[03:23:44.320 --> 03:23:46.320]  Yeah.
[03:23:46.320 --> 03:23:54.320]  Okay. Talk to me about... Lee, talk to me about Ohio. What was your take on Ohio on the chemical spill?
[03:23:54.320 --> 03:24:03.320]  Well, you know, it's like so many things. We're told something that's just a stage show, okay?
[03:24:03.320 --> 03:24:10.320]  Because this is problem reaction solution. The solution they wanted to is they really want to control the food supply.
[03:24:10.320 --> 03:24:17.320]  What's in Ohio? Fabulous farms. You know, you go downstream of that spill and you go to the Amish farms and things.
[03:24:17.320 --> 03:24:26.320]  And this is a planned toxic-demic kind of thing. You know, look, they had a movie two years before.
[03:24:26.320 --> 03:24:34.320]  It came out in 2022, and I don't know if you saw it, but there's a scene in there, and it shows this...
[03:24:34.320 --> 03:24:42.320]  It's called White Noise, and it's exactly about this. In fact, some of the people that played in the movie that were extras were from East Palestine, Ohio.
[03:24:42.320 --> 03:24:49.320]  In other words, they filmed it right where they did this. And this is like unbelievable predictive programming.
[03:24:49.320 --> 03:24:57.320]  So they filmed it in Ohio. They had this huge black cloud in the movie, the two things after I watched it, about a week after the Ohio spill.
[03:24:57.320 --> 03:25:07.320]  And by the way, I came out early on and I said, don't panic. Don't sense your hair on fire. This is not the toxic mess they're telling you.
[03:25:07.320 --> 03:25:14.320]  They've got paid actors. They've got a program. I went through the manifest. I looked at the chemicals.
[03:25:14.320 --> 03:25:20.320]  I said, it's not going to be the long-term ecological disaster they're talking about, not to say there isn't a short-term issue,
[03:25:20.320 --> 03:25:24.320]  especially for the biblical people in East Palestine, but that's going to get cleaned up.
[03:25:24.320 --> 03:25:31.320]  This happens all the time, especially apparently in Ohio. And then I had Colonel Chambers, Lieutenant Colonel Chambers is a friend of mine.
[03:25:31.320 --> 03:25:37.320]  I had, he was on the ground. I said, am I right about this? Because everybody's running around with their hair on fire and I'm telling them,
[03:25:37.320 --> 03:25:43.320]  no, it doesn't make sense. This is the chemicals that are in there. They're going to go away. What's this going on?
[03:25:43.320 --> 03:25:48.320]  And he said, and I said, I think it's a land grab. He said, that's what's going on. He talked to the Amish farmers.
[03:25:48.320 --> 03:25:56.320]  He talked to the farmers and the ranchers. And I asked him specifically, it's easy to fake saying you have a dead cat or something.
[03:25:56.320 --> 03:26:03.320]  Are there animals dying? And he said, no. He says, I'm downwind from it. There are no animals dying. I asked the farmers, I asked the ranchers.
[03:26:03.320 --> 03:26:14.320]  That's not true. Now, again, if you let your cat run up and drink the stuff right around the train possibly, but I don't think it's happening like they're telling you.
[03:26:14.320 --> 03:26:22.320]  So what's it about? Well, it turns out that they've been trying to take the land there. That is an extremely useful farmland.
[03:26:22.320 --> 03:26:35.320]  Lots of mineral rich stuff underneath the ground and coal and oil. And the EPA goes in and keeps trying to shut these people down from making a living and from doing their thing.
[03:26:35.320 --> 03:26:44.320]  And what Colonel Chambers heard everywhere he went, he said, they said, the EPA keeps trying to take our land and we're not leaving. That's good.
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:54.320]  But this is so back to the movie. The movie shows this shows the rack and then it shows this cloud. And I said, you know, they love visual symbols.
[03:26:54.320 --> 03:27:02.320]  Remember the picture of they wanted to show you like that blue spiky ball that they got everybody afraid about SARS, OV2. Oh my God.
[03:27:02.320 --> 03:27:10.320]  And that's all CGI. It's all we live in a CGI world. Well, this movie, you know, what actually happened is right out of the movie.
[03:27:10.320 --> 03:27:16.320]  What did they keep showing us in the in them? They showed us that black cloud. How long did that black cloud really last?
[03:27:16.320 --> 03:27:26.320]  Okay, couldn't have lasted that long. But they kept showing it and showing it and showing it. And in the movie, that's the first thing I remember is that huge black cloud that's hanging in the sky.
[03:27:26.320 --> 03:27:32.320]  And then and it's got lightning coming out of it. Now this guy in that movie, he's supposed to be a college professor.
[03:27:32.320 --> 03:27:43.320]  And he gives this. The other thing I remember from the video is this creepy lecture he gives. And he's he's in his classroom. And this is just before the spill.
[03:27:43.320 --> 03:27:51.320]  He's in his classroom. And he's in a black robe like they were the Oxford professors where now nobody in America wears stuff like that.
[03:27:51.320 --> 03:27:58.320]  But he's in this lecture circuit. He's got this black robe on. And if the and he's talking about Hitler, you got to throw Hitler in here.
[03:27:58.320 --> 03:28:09.320]  I mean, he's an expert on Hitler. And so then he's in this classroom and there's there's the movie, you know, he's he's in there and he's talking and he's in this black robe.
[03:28:09.320 --> 03:28:18.320]  And at the end of the movie, he keeps leaning forward and saying death, death, death. I mean, it's crazy. It's so it's so melodramatic.
[03:28:18.320 --> 03:28:28.320]  So and at the end, oh, and at the end, what do they tell him? Well, he doesn't know he's not sick. He's not sick in any way, but they tell him he's probably not going to live as long if he hadn't gotten exposed.
[03:28:28.320 --> 03:28:34.320]  Now, you see, okay, yeah, this is all about fake toxic stuff.
[03:28:34.320 --> 03:28:43.320]  Yeah, we're going to we're going to head to a break. The great Dr. Lee Merritt's on with me. The website is themedicalrebel.com, themedicalrebel.com.
[03:28:43.320 --> 03:28:52.320]  She always has so much to say and I love that about her. And of course, we'll come right back. We'll talk. We'll talk all kinds of things in this hour on the Alex Jones show.
[03:28:52.320 --> 03:28:56.320]  Stay with us. Don't go anywhere. You're going to want to hear what she has to say.
[03:28:56.320 --> 03:29:15.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the World of the World is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words, playing for our future. That is the hellish future. Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the World of the World at bookstores, Amazon, or info.org.com.
[03:29:15.320 --> 03:29:29.320]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about a thousand left of them right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy at info.org.com.
[03:29:29.320 --> 03:29:39.320]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air. So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book. You'll also know that you help keep infoers on the air.
[03:29:39.320 --> 03:29:53.320]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies. But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to info.org.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and go to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:29:53.320 --> 03:30:15.320]  This is an info war. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support. I've got some good news. Our high quality supplements really work and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers. That's the good news. They're amazing. The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to info.org.com and ever actually buy the products.
[03:30:15.320 --> 03:30:31.320]  So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the info war. Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products. Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to infowarstore.com and got some of these amazing products.
[03:30:31.320 --> 03:30:47.320]  I would recommend Tomb Rink 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest effects so you reorder and see how great it is. Also we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil that's so good if you're in neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well.

[03:30:58.320 --> 03:31:06.320]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane place. World War III has already started.
[03:31:06.320 --> 03:31:14.320]  Biden is a puppet and this is all over our borders. There's mass censorship. James O'Keefe been removed from Project Veritas. The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[03:31:14.320 --> 03:31:23.320]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening. But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[03:31:23.320 --> 03:31:31.320]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to hit the broadcast on the air by getting great products at infowarstore.com.

[03:32:54.320 --> 03:33:04.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.320 --> 03:33:19.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Dahle, your guest host. My guest is Dr. Lee Merritt today from themedicalrebel.com.
[03:33:19.320 --> 03:33:24.320]  She's been so instrumental in helping people understand their health, especially during these three years.
[03:33:24.320 --> 03:33:34.320]  And also, I always like to talk to her about all kinds of subjects in the news because she always has so many different intriguing texts on it. I love that about her.
[03:33:34.320 --> 03:33:44.320]  So I just wanted to talk about banks real quick with you. What do you feel is going on right now, Dr. Lee Merritt, with all the banking headlines?
[03:33:44.320 --> 03:33:58.320]  Well, it's part of the multi-dimensional war against humanity, and I just think we need to wake up. We keep thinking we're just lurching from problem to problem in America, and it's Biden's administration or something.
[03:33:58.320 --> 03:34:11.320]  No, no, we're in a global war against humanity run by a very few people at the top of a pyramid of power, and it's all connected. I mean, this, the Ukraine war, everything is connected here.
[03:34:11.320 --> 03:34:17.320]  And so the Ohio spill is coming after our land and coming after our food supply cattle.
[03:34:17.320 --> 03:34:25.320]  This had to do with the fact that the Amish farmers won their court case, and you can't force vaccinate people's farm animals anymore.
[03:34:25.320 --> 03:34:36.320]  In Iowa, they're coming after our chickens based on false PCR tests and stacking chickens in these horrendous, tight spaces and treating them bad.
[03:34:36.320 --> 03:34:45.320]  And then when they get sick, they say, oh, it's avian flu. You've got to get rid of all your chickens. So millions of this is why your eggs are $8 a dozen or whatever.
[03:34:45.320 --> 03:35:00.320]  And now the banking collapse. You know, come on. I personally think, the good news here, I personally think the, if you want to call it the deep state, I refer to it as the Kazarian mafia, but the overlords or maybe the Uber parasites, they're desperate.
[03:35:00.320 --> 03:35:10.320]  I really think they're running out of money. You know, I noticed this first, not just because the whole banking thing is happening, but I noticed it at the Super Bowl halftime show.
[03:35:10.320 --> 03:35:29.320]  Now, that sounds kind of crazy, but you know, we've had these really satanic, I mean, I almost quit watching these shows because we've had all these really satanic, you know, halftime shows, all the red costumes and the lights and the symbolism and the, and they were really over the top money.
[03:35:29.320 --> 03:35:41.320]  This time, yeah, they had the red satanic kind of outfits, but it was kind of meh, not very, not very impressive. They spent a lot of money on this. I thought, wow, this is a low budget production for them. Hey, maybe that's good.
[03:35:41.320 --> 03:35:45.320]  We're running out of, you know, another thing that's happening.
[03:35:45.320 --> 03:35:59.320]  I was just going to say on a side note, you know, the Oscars, it was funny that they kept saying, oh, 15 million people watched. People don't realize that 30 years ago, they had 55 to 78 million people watching and we're clear down to 15 million now.
[03:35:59.320 --> 03:36:10.320]  Those are the only people that actually will eat that kind of show up the Oscars and watch it all the way through. And I thought that was kind of amazing. They never talk about that in the media, how low the numbers are.
[03:36:10.320 --> 03:36:19.320]  But I hope we realize that the majority of Americans that used to watch that kind of crap filled show isn't watching it anymore, but that's on a totally side note.
[03:36:19.320 --> 03:36:31.320]  Yeah, no, that's right. And those 15 million are probably either in nursing homes in front of the TV or in a wheelchair on their psychometric drugs.
[03:36:31.320 --> 03:36:41.320]  Or they're in the bundles, you know, they had to buy the bundle and they might as well just watch it. We live in a CGI world.
[03:36:41.320 --> 03:36:55.320]  And that's the other thing is that when you really wake up to what's going on, it's much worse than we thought. But there are good things happening that make me think somebody in the background with us waking up is taking the world back.
[03:36:55.320 --> 03:37:05.320]  For example, the halftime show was kind of mediocre. And they're just not, I mean, I think a lot of this is like, it's like a caged animal, like an animal in the corner.
[03:37:05.320 --> 03:37:13.320]  And now they're really fighting, they're throwing all the stops out, these ridiculous things. But it's not working. It's really not working.
[03:37:13.320 --> 03:37:29.320]  One of the things I've got an inkling about is in China, you know, the big thing in Ukraine, Ukraine is the center of not just the money laundering, but of sex trafficking, human trafficking of all sorts, and body parts.
[03:37:29.320 --> 03:37:44.320]  Okay, people don't realize that drugs are kind of the lowest on the payroll of illicit substances you can run, which really is the big thing is body parts. That is the most expensive money.
[03:37:44.320 --> 03:37:52.320]  I mean, that is the biggest money to be had from Adrena Chrome probably on the top and then, you know, liver transplants pieces of you.
[03:37:52.320 --> 03:38:00.320]  And what's happening in Ukraine is kind of a desperate effort. They have the Mozart group over there harvesting body parts on the on the battlefield.
[03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:08.320]  These Ukrainian mothers are wondering where their son's bodies are, they got killed in the war, and they can't get the body because it's been caught up.
[03:38:08.320 --> 03:38:16.320]  Now, in what I what the good news here is that China has all these transplant hospitals sitting empty. Why are they sitting empty?
[03:38:16.320 --> 03:38:26.320]  You know, they we hear about the housing bubble in China is really not a housing bubble. As my friend Mitch Gerber said, he's been watching this and trying to help the Falun Gong not be harvested for 20 years.
[03:38:26.320 --> 03:38:35.320]  And he suddenly said, these hospitals are starting to sit empty. I said, that means somebody is cutting off the trafficking, the ability to do this organ trafficking.
[03:38:35.320 --> 03:38:45.320]  Because what was happening in China is that you had all the the the Uyghurs, the Falun Gong, the Buddhists, the Christians, all the people that they didn't want around.
[03:38:45.320 --> 03:38:53.320]  They were taking a certain percentage of them and putting them in these enclosures that look like our hog enclosures in Iowa, except they don't have the big fans.
[03:38:53.320 --> 03:38:59.320]  Okay, and they would keep them there and they blood type them. And then when somebody needed to some rich person needed a liver transplant from England,
[03:38:59.320 --> 03:39:08.320]  they could call up and they come over and they'd be live transplant from some and they particularly like Falun Gong organs because the Falun Gong don't drink, don't smoke.
[03:39:08.320 --> 03:39:17.320]  They get out in the sun every day. They live a healthy lifestyle. They know those are top quality organs. This is what's been going on and we have not been paying attention for decades, right?
[03:39:17.320 --> 03:39:27.320]  They started this in World War II. The Japanese were doing this. And then what did we do? We didn't condemn them for any human right violations.
[03:39:27.320 --> 03:39:36.320]  It's not like we always tend to use as an excuse. What we did was we wanted their data. We wanted their data. So we went and got data. Scary times.
[03:39:36.320 --> 03:39:48.320]  That's exactly right. And you know, I'm sure on the German side, same thing. So bottom line here is that things are happening in the background that make me think that the system is coming down.
[03:39:48.320 --> 03:39:58.320]  I mean, you're also hearing people speak out about stuff. The banking, see, they still control some banking. What do they, what does the deep, what do you want to call it, the cabal or the deep state?
[03:39:58.320 --> 03:40:09.320]  We have to quit thinking in terms of international, like it's not, we're not in a world and we probably never were in this world where we could say China bad, you know, America good, Russia bad, England good.
[03:40:09.320 --> 03:40:18.320]  We never was there. Okay. It was always that there was a group of people in charge and all the small people throughout the world were the victims.
[03:40:18.320 --> 03:40:26.320]  And we have to realize that we need to quit fighting among ourselves and realize it's the uber lords, the uber parasites we need to take out that have lied to us about everything.
[03:40:26.320 --> 03:40:44.320]  But we've been seeing this goal now for quite a while. And I think we're seeing some of this breakdown because, you know, you're just suddenly information's coming out that we never saw before, even about even about little things that that we, you know, are hearing about people.
[03:40:44.320 --> 03:40:49.320]  I never heard people, for example, who got interested in the Nuremberg codes before. Okay.
[03:40:49.320 --> 03:40:58.320]  And it turns out they don't quite have it right because the Nuremberg code was made up by us in order to hang the Nazi doctors for doing exactly what we actually were doing also in research.
[03:40:58.320 --> 03:41:08.320]  You know, we were doing malaria studies, we were doing those things. So, but nonetheless, we're hearing a lot of stuff about, you know, technologies that we didn't know about.
[03:41:08.320 --> 03:41:21.320]  And so I think that we're making progress. And I think that you're hearing now a lot of disinformation because that's the only game in town left, you know.
[03:41:21.320 --> 03:41:32.320]  The banking is an attempt. But again, I'm having actually, Kristen Ragusan is her name, but she wrote a book about the end of scarcity.
[03:41:32.320 --> 03:41:40.320]  And she talks about local, local script. In other words, you don't have to be depending on a big, even a big banking systems.
[03:41:40.320 --> 03:41:50.320]  We always think we think we're dependent on these big, deep state systems, the medical system, the banking system, the three big networks.
[03:41:50.320 --> 03:41:57.320]  Well, the first thing to go was the three big networks. And now COVID has caused people to say, I'm getting out of the medical system.
[03:41:57.320 --> 03:42:09.320]  You know, I feel like I'm a, I'm a, I have fled the medical death cult. You know, so I'm, and I find that when people, I kind of am a small town doc still people come and just always, you know, call me up for help.
[03:42:09.320 --> 03:42:15.320]  And I tell them, it's very rare now that I use antibiotics because I know what we can do other than that.
[03:42:15.320 --> 03:42:22.320]  We're learning so much that we can take our world back and don't have to play in their sandbox. And it's in the banking system too.
[03:42:22.320 --> 03:42:32.320]  But I would, in the short term, you know, I think even my little town banker, okay, when I asked him, did he think this was related to the crypto guy going down?
[03:42:32.320 --> 03:42:39.320]  He said, absolutely. So he knew, he knows what's, it's, it's related. It's a long term play here.
[03:42:39.320 --> 03:42:49.320]  We're going to come right back with Dr. Lee Merritt. Let's talk about some of the things you've been reviewing in medicine too, because I'm always interested to know what you've been researching and doing.
[03:42:49.320 --> 03:42:56.320]  Come right back on the Alex G show. My guest is Dr. Lee Merritt. I'm Kay Daly, your guest host. We'll be right back.
[03:42:56.320 --> 03:43:03.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad retired dentist and oral surgeon developed.
[03:43:03.320 --> 03:43:11.320]  Dr. Jones natural's turmeric toothpaste that just came into stock. And I got to tell you, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[03:43:11.320 --> 03:43:20.320]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth is insane. We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. It does such great things to the body.
[03:43:20.320 --> 03:43:29.320]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils. It is just dynamite. It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[03:43:29.320 --> 03:43:36.320]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at infoarstore.com. Dr. Jones natural's turmeric toothpaste.

[03:46:56.320 --> 03:47:04.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:15.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from KateDalyRadio.com.
[03:47:15.320 --> 03:47:22.320]  My guest is Dr. Lee Merritt, of course, and wow, what a warrior she is. Can I just tell you, so smart.
[03:47:22.320 --> 03:47:29.320]  And I also just want to mention I've been doing a lot on copper lately, realizing what a desert of copper we actually are,
[03:47:29.320 --> 03:47:34.320]  how glyphosate targeted the removal of copper in our food supply.
[03:47:34.320 --> 03:47:39.320]  And with copper, you can do so many things in your body.
[03:47:39.320 --> 03:47:45.320]  And it's amazing to me how many things we just never knew, how many things over the course of the last 120 years we just haven't known.
[03:47:45.320 --> 03:47:50.320]  But the sense that I'm getting from people is they are making sure they have supplements in their home.
[03:47:50.320 --> 03:47:55.320]  They're making sure that they are taking care of their own health now and looking to it more than ever.
[03:47:55.320 --> 03:48:00.320]  I have never seen the concern that I've seen in this three years.
[03:48:00.320 --> 03:48:07.320]  And maybe that's kind of backfired on those that wanted to run the COVID-19 hoax to basically say to us, you know,
[03:48:07.320 --> 03:48:11.320]  I don't think they realized that we were going to be this invested in our own health.
[03:48:11.320 --> 03:48:20.320]  And so I'm happy to see people take care of themselves and make sure they have enough under their roof to cover shortages coming
[03:48:20.320 --> 03:48:22.320]  or cover whatever is coming.
[03:48:22.320 --> 03:48:26.320]  But what have you been researching, Dr. Lee Merrick, because I know you're always on the hunt.
[03:48:26.320 --> 03:48:34.320]  You're always looking at our health from so many different angles, and I always appreciate that about you.
[03:48:34.320 --> 03:48:40.320]  I think I've said this, but I have said to extract yourself from the system, you have to get out of the lies.
[03:48:40.320 --> 03:48:46.320]  And the biggest enabling lie here is that somehow we are getting sick because of viruses.
[03:48:46.320 --> 03:48:49.320]  It turns out that is the enabling lie.
[03:48:49.320 --> 03:48:57.320]  But what is really a big one is what they're doing to us is an electromagnetic attack.
[03:48:57.320 --> 03:49:03.320]  And if you look at what are they finding in these vaccines, for example, they're finding networking things.
[03:49:03.320 --> 03:49:10.320]  I have a picture from Dr. Duncan and through Maria Z down in Australia, and it shows in a Pfizer vial,
[03:49:10.320 --> 03:49:14.320]  an actual, it looks like this thing expands over a time lapse photography.
[03:49:14.320 --> 03:49:19.320]  It's a black kind of square thing. Nature doesn't make square things, so it shouldn't be in there.
[03:49:19.320 --> 03:49:22.320]  And it looks like an old Intel CPU.
[03:49:22.320 --> 03:49:24.320]  But it's microscopic.
[03:49:24.320 --> 03:49:29.320]  We're finding that, I mean, they want us to eat bugs.
[03:49:29.320 --> 03:49:31.320]  Why do they want us to eat bugs?
[03:49:31.320 --> 03:49:36.320]  Because bugs are made of chitin and they make this bug flower and chitin is a photonic crystal.
[03:49:36.320 --> 03:49:42.320]  So what they're doing is putting things into us that then respond to wavelength.
[03:49:42.320 --> 03:49:44.320]  I really think that's the issue.
[03:49:44.320 --> 03:49:51.320]  And quite frankly, the reason to convince us that they're doing all this genetic modification is to make us hopeless.
[03:49:51.320 --> 03:49:56.320]  You know, if you think you've DNA been modified and you've taken an injection and you can't get out of it,
[03:49:56.320 --> 03:50:02.320]  that's really, like, depressing. And even doctors, you know, you don't like to look at things that are too psychologically debilitating.
[03:50:02.320 --> 03:50:09.320]  So if you believe that you might have screwed up and changed your DNA and killed your children and your, you know, your patients and everything,
[03:50:09.320 --> 03:50:13.320]  you're just not going to look. You're not going to get, you know, it's easier just not to look.
[03:50:13.320 --> 03:50:15.320]  So I'm saying we had...
[03:50:15.320 --> 03:50:21.320]  And had we all along had copper, had we all along had copper in our diet to the extent as the master mineral,
[03:50:21.320 --> 03:50:24.320]  it would have detoxified these things out of our bodies.
[03:50:24.320 --> 03:50:28.320]  But we're just sitting ducks because then stuff comes into our bodies, we have no way to do it.
[03:50:28.320 --> 03:50:30.320]  But we still can do it. We can still get rid of it.
[03:50:30.320 --> 03:50:31.320]  We can do it.
[03:50:31.320 --> 03:50:32.320]  Can't we?
[03:50:32.320 --> 03:50:36.320]  But copper does seem to be the magic juice in all sorts of ways.
[03:50:36.320 --> 03:50:46.320]  I mean, you know, the Havana syndrome where they used basically microwave or some kind of wavelength attack on our ambassador people down in Cuba.
[03:50:46.320 --> 03:50:50.320]  Well, DARPA figured out that if you take little...
[03:50:50.320 --> 03:50:57.320]  And this is some guys at DARPA, I'm sure it's another official policy, but if you take little circles of copper and you put them over your temples,
[03:50:57.320 --> 03:51:03.320]  which is your thinnest skull bone, you know, you put them over your temples and you connect them to things that's grounded,
[03:51:03.320 --> 03:51:05.320]  that protects you against that.
[03:51:05.320 --> 03:51:10.320]  So they've been looking at copper in all sorts of ways as a protection to direct energy weapons,
[03:51:10.320 --> 03:51:17.320]  but it also, when you're deficient in copper, you're more sensitive to these photomic crystals and to wavelength.
[03:51:17.320 --> 03:51:18.320]  So you're right.
[03:51:18.320 --> 03:51:20.320]  Copper is essential.
[03:51:20.320 --> 03:51:23.320]  And in medical school, look at organized medicine.
[03:51:23.320 --> 03:51:26.320]  Everything they taught me over my lifetime has been wrong.
[03:51:26.320 --> 03:51:30.320]  They lied about vitamin D. They lied about vitamin C. They lied about copper.
[03:51:30.320 --> 03:51:36.320]  They made you think, in fact, do you remember, I think this is one of the funniest episodes during COVID?
[03:51:36.320 --> 03:51:39.320]  Fortunately, we had a little restaurant bar area.
[03:51:39.320 --> 03:51:43.320]  We could still go, not wear masks and, you know, enjoy a nice meal and have a drink.
[03:51:43.320 --> 03:51:50.320]  So this was that day they had this news item, and it was my state, but this was in multiple states,
[03:51:50.320 --> 03:51:57.320]  where they wanted to outlaw those copper mugs for Moscow meals because they said people might get too much copper.
[03:51:57.320 --> 03:52:03.320]  And I said, and without knowing anything more about their motive, I thought, this is just insanity.
[03:52:03.320 --> 03:52:06.320]  So we went properly out and had Moscow meals at this bar.
[03:52:06.320 --> 03:52:08.320]  I mean, they said, this is insane.
[03:52:08.320 --> 03:52:11.320]  You get, you know, you can make, you can take more in your vitamin than this.
[03:52:11.320 --> 03:52:13.320]  What are they talking about?
[03:52:13.320 --> 03:52:17.320]  But you see, it's a war on copper, and there's an, there's an even uglier point about copper.
[03:52:17.320 --> 03:52:19.320]  I just did an lecture on electroculture.
[03:52:19.320 --> 03:52:29.320]  Years ago, in the 1920s, they knew that copper tools like copper hose, copper plows, copper brass could,
[03:52:29.320 --> 03:52:31.320]  could increase the yield in the field.
[03:52:31.320 --> 03:52:37.320]  And when you use iron, when you use iron equipment, it decreases the electrification,
[03:52:37.320 --> 03:52:40.320]  magnetism in the soil somehow, and they don't grow as well.
[03:52:40.320 --> 03:52:45.320]  So copper, now the, in electroculture, use copper antennas, copper wire,
[03:52:45.320 --> 03:52:50.320]  and you put these, you put it, you put the electrification back in the soil and you can get bumper crops.
[03:52:50.320 --> 03:52:53.320]  There's, and our government stifled that in 1940.
[03:52:53.320 --> 03:52:56.320]  In the Bible, they wore copper bracelets, right?
[03:52:56.320 --> 03:52:58.320]  In the Bible, they wore copper bracelets.
[03:52:58.320 --> 03:52:59.320]  We've got a long history with it.
[03:52:59.320 --> 03:53:04.320]  And if anyone wants it, FIQ products are on my website, kdallyradio.com, you can go get them.
[03:53:04.320 --> 03:53:09.320]  But it's amazing to me that we don't know about it and doctors don't talk about it.
[03:53:09.320 --> 03:53:13.320]  All of these doctors in socialized medicine will not, yeah, they don't know what to say about it.
[03:53:13.320 --> 03:53:14.320]  Amazing.
[03:53:14.320 --> 03:53:16.320]  We have been completely bamboozled.
[03:53:16.320 --> 03:53:18.320]  The medical system has been lying to us forever.
[03:53:18.320 --> 03:53:24.320]  And that's why my approach now is getting back out of the medical system.
[03:53:24.320 --> 03:53:29.320]  And one of the big lies is we have to make a precise diagnosis before we can treat you.
[03:53:29.320 --> 03:53:35.320]  Look at how many people spend so much money and they run around from doctor to doctor and specialist to specialist.
[03:53:35.320 --> 03:53:37.320]  They get an MRI and a CAT scan and electrical studies.
[03:53:37.320 --> 03:53:39.320]  They get all these different studies.
[03:53:39.320 --> 03:53:41.320]  At the end of the day, they still don't know what's going on.
[03:53:41.320 --> 03:53:43.320]  Or here's my favorite.
[03:53:43.320 --> 03:53:48.320]  See, doctors think we think that if we can tell you the symptoms.
[03:53:48.320 --> 03:53:52.320]  If we say, let's take, here's a perfect example of the problem we have.
[03:53:52.320 --> 03:53:55.320]  So you have a neurologic problem.
[03:53:55.320 --> 03:53:58.320]  And I take a look at you and I say, oh, we've got these symptoms.
[03:53:58.320 --> 03:54:00.320]  You've got this symptom, this system, this system.
[03:54:00.320 --> 03:54:03.320]  Let's get an MRI of your brain and spinal cord.
[03:54:03.320 --> 03:54:06.320]  And when you come back, I say, oh, you've got these neurologic symptoms.
[03:54:06.320 --> 03:54:08.320]  You've got an MRI of your brain and spinal cord.
[03:54:08.320 --> 03:54:10.320]  It shows these plaques. You've got multiple sclerosis.
[03:54:10.320 --> 03:54:16.320]  Now that makes you think that we know what we're talking about and that we know what multiple sclerosis is.
[03:54:16.320 --> 03:54:19.320]  And so for years, this is what we've done for decades.
[03:54:19.320 --> 03:54:20.320]  This is what we've done.
[03:54:20.320 --> 03:54:26.320]  We even did some CSF studies and you've got oligoclonal bands and different tests they used to do years ago.
[03:54:26.320 --> 03:54:30.320]  The bottom line is we don't mention causation.
[03:54:30.320 --> 03:54:32.320]  And they always say it's genetic.
[03:54:32.320 --> 03:54:35.320]  They say it's somewhere in your genetics because they don't know what else to say.
[03:54:35.320 --> 03:54:37.320]  I'm going to tell you what it really is.
[03:54:37.320 --> 03:54:48.320]  Because when I was in medical school in 1976, one of the unusual factoids was that we were taught was that if you have an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis,
[03:54:48.320 --> 03:54:50.320]  if you have a lap dog under the age of five.
[03:54:50.320 --> 03:54:56.320]  In other words, if you have a house dog that gets close to you and sits in your lap under the age of five, it increases your risk of MS.
[03:54:56.320 --> 03:54:58.320]  Why would that be?
[03:54:58.320 --> 03:54:59.320]  Here's the answer.
[03:54:59.320 --> 03:55:07.320]  The answer is, and this is thanks to Dr. McDonald, who's a pathologist who did 10 autopsies on multiple sclerosis patients.
[03:55:07.320 --> 03:55:14.320]  100% of them had parasites in their brain and spinal cord corresponding to those plaques.
[03:55:14.320 --> 03:55:20.320]  Is there any test that would pick that up with an MRI?
[03:55:20.320 --> 03:55:26.320]  We could have probably biopsied or done autopsies, but the point is we never looked.
[03:55:26.320 --> 03:55:29.320]  There's a joke in medicine, WNL.
[03:55:29.320 --> 03:55:33.320]  It's supposed to be within normal limits, something you say about labs, WNL.
[03:55:33.320 --> 03:55:35.320]  It's actually, we never looked.
[03:55:35.320 --> 03:55:44.320]  People have accepted, my point is in modern medicine, we have accepted diagnosis by just description.
[03:55:44.320 --> 03:55:49.320]  That's fine to give it a name, but you don't think they know about causation.
[03:55:49.320 --> 03:55:50.320]  They're lying to you.
[03:55:50.320 --> 03:55:52.320]  They don't know about causation on so many things.
[03:55:52.320 --> 03:55:55.320]  Now it's appearing that so many things are parasites.
[03:55:55.320 --> 03:55:57.320]  Another one is autoimmune disease.
[03:55:57.320 --> 03:56:03.320]  Why does hydroxychloroquine work for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis initially and then stops working?
[03:56:03.320 --> 03:56:10.320]  Because it's parasites and it's treating the parasites at first, but they're not cycling it right to really get rid of the parasites.
[03:56:10.320 --> 03:56:14.320]  So I will tell you, as I've taken a step back in modern medicine, I said,
[03:56:14.320 --> 03:56:16.320]  ancient medicine didn't do a lot of diagnosis.
[03:56:16.320 --> 03:56:17.320]  They just did treatment.
[03:56:17.320 --> 03:56:20.320]  They said, there's only two treatments in ancient medicine.
[03:56:20.320 --> 03:56:25.320]  It was purification, get right with God, and detoxification.
[03:56:25.320 --> 03:56:29.320]  Now, virus in Latin means toxin.
[03:56:29.320 --> 03:56:32.320]  And you know these uberlords, they know what these words mean.
[03:56:32.320 --> 03:56:33.320]  It's toxin.
[03:56:33.320 --> 03:56:38.320]  It doesn't mean a little flying unicorn that comes out of my mouth and goes over to you and makes you sick.
[03:56:38.320 --> 03:56:40.320]  So we have to get back to ancient medicine.
[03:56:40.320 --> 03:56:44.320]  Now we know some other things, but my advice to people is, and I've learned this,
[03:56:44.320 --> 03:56:50.320]  that when patients come to me with problems now, just because I'm the local community doctor in some ways,
[03:56:50.320 --> 03:56:53.320]  that I don't go to the pharmacy right away.
[03:56:53.320 --> 03:56:58.320]  I don't do the things I used to do because now I realize there are only certain things that matter.
[03:56:58.320 --> 03:57:03.320]  And so I tell them, listen, here's the five things you need to do to just maintain your health.
[03:57:03.320 --> 03:57:06.320]  And one of them is, the first thing is, you need to eat clean.
[03:57:06.320 --> 03:57:10.320]  And part of it is, you need to source food, not in the grocery store necessarily.
[03:57:10.320 --> 03:57:12.320]  Everybody needs to have a garden.
[03:57:12.320 --> 03:57:14.320]  I would recommend looking into electric culture.
[03:57:14.320 --> 03:57:17.320]  Get your cat, get your beef sourced locally.
[03:57:17.320 --> 03:57:18.320]  And so eat clean.
[03:57:18.320 --> 03:57:22.320]  Don't eat, as Jack LaLaine said, if man made it, don't eat it.
[03:57:22.320 --> 03:57:23.320]  Yes.
[03:57:23.320 --> 03:57:24.320]  Yes.
[03:57:24.320 --> 03:57:25.320]  I so appreciate you.
[03:57:25.320 --> 03:57:28.320]  Eating, take, do you get rid of parasites?
[03:57:28.320 --> 03:57:30.320]  Detoxify yourself.
[03:57:30.320 --> 03:57:37.320]  And no EMF, you know, get rid of EMF damage and supplement deficiencies.
[03:57:37.320 --> 03:57:39.320]  Thank you, Dr. Lee Merritt.
[03:57:39.320 --> 03:57:41.320]  Thanks for joining me on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:41.320 --> 03:57:42.320]  Thanks.
[03:57:42.320 --> 03:58:11.320]  I appreciate you.
[03:58:12.320 --> 03:58:14.320]  Thanks for joining me on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:42.320 --> 03:58:44.320]  Thanks for joining me on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:44.320 --> 03:59:13.320]  Thanks for joining me.
[03:59:14.320 --> 03:59:20.320]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the EMF awards team.
[03:59:20.320 --> 03:59:25.320]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[03:59:25.320 --> 03:59:29.320]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is.
[03:59:29.320 --> 03:59:31.320]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[03:59:31.320 --> 03:59:34.320]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[03:59:34.320 --> 03:59:37.320]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[03:59:37.320 --> 03:59:42.320]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[03:59:42.320 --> 03:59:44.320]  Thanks for joining me on the Alex Jones Show.
