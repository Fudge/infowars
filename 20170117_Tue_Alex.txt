[00:03.000 --> 00:10.800]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[00:18.320 --> 00:23.160]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Tuesday, January 17th, 2017
[00:23.160 --> 00:28.840]  I'm David Knight Alex Jones is gonna be taking the show at the bottom of the show, but the last half-hour
[00:28.840 --> 00:30.840]  130 central time
[00:30.840 --> 00:37.320]  I've been told that he has a huge announcement concerning attacks of a lethal nature. That's all I know about it
[00:37.320 --> 00:42.360]  So we're gonna get that information as it breaks as Alex returns to Austin. He's on his way back
[00:42.360 --> 00:47.640]  We're gonna have a clip of him in the next segment telling us about what is coming up
[00:48.440 --> 00:54.680]  We've also got interesting news today as the media has declared all out war on Donald Trump
[00:54.680 --> 01:01.360]  And you've seen this of course before the election ever since the election. They're now touting some new polls saying he is the most
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.200]  Unpopular president the elect that we've ever had since we've been doing polling and of course Donald Trump reminds
[01:08.200 --> 01:14.560]  I saw that they were wrong about every single poll through the primary process through the electoral process
[01:14.760 --> 01:20.040]  They have been used as push polls, but of course, you know, I'm sure they have taken some skin off of him
[01:20.040 --> 01:27.280]  He's had the vice chairman of his transition team say that he believes the constant attacks have had a small effect on his numbers
[01:27.280 --> 01:30.440]  But that he will bounce back once we see what he does. I think that's the case
[01:30.720 --> 01:35.520]  But clearly it is a case of pushing against Donald Trump with every
[01:36.520 --> 01:39.080]  Fake narrative that they can come up with and we're gonna talk today
[01:39.960 --> 01:47.120]  About this new BBC documentary that has come out in panorama and as some of the people in the UK are talking about it
[01:47.120 --> 01:49.120]  They said is this
[01:49.120 --> 01:56.280]  Panorama that's the name of the program or is this propaganda and they actually called Donald Trump the name of the documentary that they put together is the
[01:56.280 --> 01:57.800]  Kremlin candidate and again
[01:57.800 --> 02:02.960]  I told you before that this was the new narrative that have been prepared in advance
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.840]  It's very interesting to see how the mainstream media there and here are
[02:08.160 --> 02:15.840]  Coordinating these attacks coordinating the means coordinating the narratives. They just started last week talking about the Manchurian candidate
[02:15.840 --> 02:20.440]  That's become the new a meme to replace the fact that
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.640]  They continually say Donald Trump is Hitler Donald Trump is Hitler and then when he pushes back and he says hey
[02:26.280 --> 02:29.400]  National security started to act like a Nazi propaganda
[02:30.160 --> 02:34.640]  Organization leaking this fake dossier about me. They say you can't say that you can't call us Nazis
[02:34.640 --> 02:39.400]  We can only only we can call you Nazis and if you call us Nazis and that's an offense
[02:40.440 --> 02:42.440]  To call us Nazis. So
[02:42.440 --> 02:45.840]  What is really behind this is as I pointed out yesterday
[02:45.840 --> 02:48.000]  We got media gatekeepers who are being shown the door
[02:48.200 --> 02:53.440]  They have a protectionist guild at the White House press corps and they're furiously trying to protect that
[02:53.680 --> 03:00.440]  Donald Trump is coming after them because they have been coming after him with an orchestrated propaganda campaign now. They're also coming after him with
[03:01.320 --> 03:07.240]  Protesters are offering to pay protesters up to $2,500 a piece to agitate at the Trump inauguration
[03:07.240 --> 03:09.240]  We got ads in two dozen cities
[03:09.240 --> 03:16.040]  They're saying hey, we'll pay you $50 an hour if you participate in at least six events a year
[03:16.680 --> 03:20.360]  Folks that they say we're looking for grassroots support by definition
[03:20.880 --> 03:27.000]  That is Astro turf if you're going out there with deep pockets paying people 30 grand a year to protest
[03:28.560 --> 03:37.920]  You're paid protester. That's Astro turf. That's your job. Okay. That's the same as if you got hired by some special interest lobbyist group to act as a
[03:37.920 --> 03:42.120]  To write pieces for a think tank or something. Okay, that's what that's truly about
[03:42.480 --> 03:45.520]  And we're also gonna have James O'Keefe joining us in the second hour
[03:45.520 --> 03:49.560]  He's gonna have part two of that project Veritas report the undercover report
[03:49.560 --> 03:55.280]  We played part of that yesterday for you and we talked about that they caught people talking about how they were going to
[03:55.960 --> 03:58.680]  Infiltrate the deplorable one of the inauguration balls
[03:58.680 --> 04:04.800]  It was held to honor people who had voted for Donald Trump people who voted for Donald Trump knew what was going on
[04:04.800 --> 04:09.560]  They weren't Russian agents. They weren't racist. They weren't kkk people
[04:09.560 --> 04:12.920]  They were just ordinary people that Hillary Clinton said are deplorable
[04:13.040 --> 04:18.240]  So they organized a deplora ball one of the inauguration balls. They want to infiltrate that and they want to release
[04:18.960 --> 04:20.400]  buteric acid
[04:20.400 --> 04:26.880]  Which is the acid that gives human vomit is distinct or smell but in concentrated forms. It's quite dangerous
[04:26.880 --> 04:32.680]  It's an acid. It can burn your skin. It can cause burning of your lungs that type of thing. So quite frankly folks
[04:32.680 --> 04:38.480]  This is a crime and they're conspiring to commit a crime that information has been turned over to law enforcement
[04:38.480 --> 04:40.000]  We're gonna have part two of that today
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.680]  We're going to talk to James O'Keefe and also Alex Jones is gonna have a major revelation about
[04:46.200 --> 04:48.520]  Attacks of a lethal nature stay with us to be right back
[04:48.520 --> 05:05.800]  Nobody loves Barack Obama more than Barack Obama in his speech during the Chicago Cubs World Series visit to the White House
[05:05.800 --> 05:10.640]  He referred to himself a humble 40 times in his farewell address one of his many farewells
[05:10.640 --> 05:15.760]  He referred to himself 75 times when campaigning for Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia last year
[05:15.760 --> 05:22.440]  He referred to himself 137 times after the police shooting in Dallas Obama delivered an address in which he referred to himself
[05:22.800 --> 05:28.600]  45 times not once referencing himself as one to blame after a mass shooting in Oregon in a 12 minute speech
[05:28.600 --> 05:35.320]  He referenced himself 28 times at the Democratic National Convention Obama referred to himself a whopping 119 times
[05:35.320 --> 05:39.480]  Some attendees were confused and thought he was running again when speaking in India last year
[05:39.480 --> 05:46.000]  He referred to himself 118 times. It's an international love fest in a speech on jobs in Ohio in 2010
[05:46.000 --> 05:53.280]  Barack referenced himself 132 times, but I want you to I want you to understand this is not about me
[05:53.280 --> 05:58.880]  And every morning he eats a bowl of barrios to start his day. This is Owen shroyer for info wars.com
[05:59.400 --> 06:02.680]  Ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here with the inauguration special

[07:13.800 --> 07:20.960]  We are contractually allowed to offer prices even lower than the prices that my patron supply offers and that super uses as food

[07:36.200 --> 07:43.760]  I did this because of info wars power in the market to leverage in free market to bring you the very best deals and

[08:15.760 --> 08:17.760]  1776
[08:17.800 --> 08:22.400]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones
[08:22.400 --> 08:25.520]  Move it get out of the way
[08:27.200 --> 08:29.880]  We pledge allegiance to one flag
[08:30.560 --> 08:37.840]  And that flag is the American flag info wars helped you the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter
[08:37.840 --> 08:42.800]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning. I will not let you down
[08:42.800 --> 08:49.800]  You'll be very very impressed. I hope and I think we'll be speaking of Donald Trump and Alex Jones
[08:49.800 --> 08:59.160]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones
[09:01.840 --> 09:03.840]  This is my final
[09:04.880 --> 09:10.120]  Voice report before I return back to the studio in Austin later today. We're about to close the cabin door
[09:11.200 --> 09:15.080]  Coming up. I'm gonna break this down more in a longer report. I just filed but
[09:15.080 --> 09:21.040]  Oh, it just struck me that as libertarians as Americana promoters
[09:22.240 --> 09:28.360]  We are not drama queens like the control domesticated left. Can you imagine what would happen?
[09:29.080 --> 09:31.080]  if there was a video of
[09:32.480 --> 09:37.880]  Trump supporters or libertarians planning to attack a democratic ball
[09:38.600 --> 09:40.120]  with
[09:40.120 --> 09:47.280]  Chemical weapons. I mean, that's what this report is. It's a it's a deadly acid pumped into the pump into the ventilation system
[09:48.680 --> 09:51.440]  And of all places they're meeting at David Brock's
[09:53.440 --> 09:55.440]  Boyfriends pizza place
[09:57.160 --> 09:59.680]  I mean you just can't make this stuff up and
[10:00.200 --> 10:07.920]  Then you add to that all these other groups calling for violence and just the frothing hysteria these people where they've totally dehumanized us and
[10:07.920 --> 10:09.920]  And so
[10:09.920 --> 10:17.960]  Anything goes, you know, they've had these different leftist groups like the 80 all come out and say the Trump shouldn't compare the fig dossier
[10:17.960 --> 10:19.960]  It's been proven fig now
[10:20.760 --> 10:28.440]  To Hitler, I mean, what are you supposed to compare this level of fascism to now where they literally want to gas us?
[10:28.440 --> 10:33.560]  I mean, I'm going to speak at this event. I'm going to go there to spite the threats for the First Amendment and
[10:33.560 --> 10:39.240]  And stand up against this if you're just stepping on boy, we still have plenty of seats
[10:40.800 --> 10:42.800]  Finishing this report is are closed the cabin door
[10:44.880 --> 10:49.920]  I'll be back today more dwelling on our lives at 1.30 central to break down
[10:51.160 --> 10:57.520]  The greatest attack on the press we've seen in modern history. It's now reached lethal levels
[10:58.440 --> 11:00.440]  It's now reached
[11:00.440 --> 11:07.000]  attempted murder levels. How you doing, sir? And it is it is imperative that
[11:08.200 --> 11:12.600]  When we stand together and we stand against this intimidation, I mean notice
[11:12.600 --> 11:16.920]  I always say themes come out on each broadcast or or or or in each week or each month
[11:17.040 --> 11:24.680]  Not because I come up with themes but because the real events of the world do we've got people planning to release chemical weapons
[11:24.680 --> 11:32.520]  on peaceful people exercising their first amendment who've already been demonized and already called deplorable and already been
[11:33.160 --> 11:40.360]  Been turned into animals basically and that's exactly again what the Nazis did and they do this over and over and over again
[11:40.360 --> 11:46.480]  This is a very dangerous cult of people and the Democratic Party is facing their whole system around racial
[11:46.960 --> 11:52.920]  Racial systems of control. It's just so diabolical. It makes my head spin and it's time for Democrats
[11:52.920 --> 11:58.880]  To decry this garbage and it's time for Republicans to take their party back and the Democrats as well
[11:58.880 --> 12:03.560]  And realize the ruling classes are using divide and conquer on us and it's gotten extremely dangerous
[12:03.960 --> 12:06.920]  But all the thugs all the minions all the sorrows people
[12:07.680 --> 12:10.080]  your intimidation is only going to
[12:10.680 --> 12:15.720]  Make more people stand up and get right back in your face and if it's been your intimidation
[12:15.720 --> 12:17.720]  It's been your bullying. It's been your demonization
[12:18.160 --> 12:21.240]  That's cost so many people to take action and wake up
[12:21.240 --> 12:28.600]  And so just understand that that that you're making the same mistake the tyrants have made throughout history over and over again
[12:29.640 --> 12:31.800]  All right back to David Knight in Austin, Texas
[12:32.800 --> 12:35.520]  And again, I'm David Knight in the studio. You just heard Alex Jones
[12:35.520 --> 12:38.720]  He's gonna be joining us in the studio at 130 central
[12:38.720 --> 12:42.200]  That's the last half hour of this broadcast. He's gonna be having
[12:42.960 --> 12:47.840]  Announcement huge announcement concerning the attacks of a lethal nature. She just heard him talk about
[12:47.840 --> 12:51.680]  Now, of course, the thing that the media is trumpeting everywhere
[12:52.160 --> 12:57.320]  Saying that Trump's approval polls are the lowest that they've historically seen
[12:57.320 --> 13:01.040]  So that's the narrative that's coming out from the mainstream media the bottom of the hour
[13:01.040 --> 13:06.120]  Alex is going to talk about how the Democrats are constantly attacking Donald Trump and of course
[13:06.520 --> 13:12.880]  I'm sure that they've taken some off of his numbers, but of course, these are also the people as Donald Trump pointed out in his tweet
[13:12.880 --> 13:18.900]  He said the same people who did the phony election polls and we're so wrong are now doing approval rating polls
[13:19.120 --> 13:21.120]  They're rigged just like before
[13:21.960 --> 13:24.360]  And we've talked about this during the election during the
[13:24.800 --> 13:28.000]  Run up to the election during the primaries. They're called push polls
[13:28.400 --> 13:34.360]  You put these polls out there one of the reasons why these polls have been so so wrong in terms of the election
[13:34.360 --> 13:42.480]  Is because they were never designed to reflect public opinion. They were designed to influence public opinion
[13:42.800 --> 13:49.160]  This is a very old political tactic, but it's been used far more extensively during this campaign against Donald Trump
[13:49.160 --> 13:53.480]  than we've ever seen before and they're still using that campaign quite frankly and of course we had
[13:53.480 --> 13:59.120]  Sean Duffy vice chair of the Trump transition team said that he believed and he was on CNN
[13:59.120 --> 14:01.520]  He said yeah, they've taken a little bit of numbers off of it
[14:01.520 --> 14:04.080]  But it's not that bad and he's we're gonna see him bounce back
[14:04.960 --> 14:06.040]  once
[14:06.040 --> 14:09.080]  He takes office and that's the precise point
[14:09.120 --> 14:13.320]  That's one of the reasons why the media gatekeepers are being shown the door at the White House
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.120]  And you look at the headlines about that type of thing Trump team considers
[14:17.440 --> 14:20.840]  Evicting the press from the White House. That's the way the Hill reports it
[14:20.840 --> 14:24.680]  Then we've got New York Times saying Trump team considers moving the press corps
[14:24.680 --> 14:32.280]  Alarming reporters another salvo from the administration that has shown an unusual willingness to berate and belittle the news media
[14:32.280 --> 14:37.680]  That's what they're talking about an erosion of press freedoms that they ever complain about about Barack Obama
[14:38.280 --> 14:40.280]  locking up their own journalists
[14:41.080 --> 14:43.080]  locking up whistleblowers and
[14:43.480 --> 14:50.400]  An unprecedented amount more than all the other presidents under the 1917 the 100 year old act the espionage act
[14:50.400 --> 14:56.040]  In the last 100 years Barack Obama went after whistleblowers went after the press coming after members of the press
[14:56.400 --> 15:01.040]  In an unprecedented way doing it more than all the other presidents in the last 100 years combined
[15:01.040 --> 15:03.680]  Did they ever say anything about that? No, did they complain?
[15:04.680 --> 15:07.040]  when Barack Obama came out and
[15:07.560 --> 15:12.560]  Created the Ministry of Truth with the State Department signing yet another NDAA act
[15:13.360 --> 15:18.280]  Violating the Constitution we've seen Obama use the NDAA act as also the Republicans
[15:18.280 --> 15:22.360]  To push in things like indefinite detention without trial by the US military
[15:22.720 --> 15:29.840]  Being able to transport people out of this country so they can torture them without trial and now creating a Ministry of Truth funding it for
[15:30.560 --> 15:37.120]  $160 million for two years 80 million dollars a year to let the State Department of all places be the final arbiter of truth now
[15:37.400 --> 15:43.760]  Bloomberg to their credit finally got one of these right whoever wrote this article here Trump team may move West Wing briefings to expand
[15:44.480 --> 15:46.480]  capacity and of course that's what
[15:46.480 --> 15:51.120]  The headline on a drudge pointed out about that said we object stringlessly to any move
[15:51.120 --> 15:56.720]  They said that would shield the president and his advisers from the scrutiny and of course that is a quote from the White House
[15:56.840 --> 16:01.400]  Correspondence Association see the how to understand is this is truly kind of like a
[16:01.720 --> 16:07.400]  trade union like a guild trying to keep people out and the real issue is that they're going to be bringing in
[16:07.520 --> 16:10.920]  Talk radio hosts and bloggers. That's what Sean Spicer has said
[16:10.920 --> 16:14.320]  He said there's a lot of talk of radio and bloggers and people they can't fit in right now
[16:14.320 --> 16:19.200]  Because they don't have a permanency because they're not part of the Washington elite media
[16:19.640 --> 16:21.640]  And again, they have their own little guild
[16:21.960 --> 16:29.560]  That says we're going to side and only these 49 people who are entitled who are the elite entitled are going to have access to Donald
[16:29.560 --> 16:33.000]  Trump and then the rest of the people are going to be shut out what they're saying is we want to go to another
[16:33.800 --> 16:38.440]  Location that's adjacent to the White House so we can get up to 400 people in there
[16:38.440 --> 16:45.720]  They say the Brady press briefing room holds 49 seats for major media organizations, which are granted space by the White House
[16:46.560 --> 16:48.040]  Correspondence Association
[16:48.040 --> 16:55.440]  See it's a protectionist guild and these guys are using this to create a narrative that Donald Trump is the most unpopular president
[16:55.600 --> 17:01.640]  That we've had the most popular president elect that we've had in recent times now today. We're going to be talking to
[17:02.480 --> 17:06.240]  James O'Keefe with project Veritas yesterday. We played part one of his exposure
[17:06.240 --> 17:10.360]  Alex referenced that and that report you just heard where they're talking about they're going to
[17:10.800 --> 17:16.560]  Release butyric acid which in concentrations doesn't acid. It'll burn your skin will burn your lungs
[17:16.600 --> 17:20.480]  But the key thing about it they wanted to force evacuation in the entire building
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.640]  Because it's a very disgusting smell
[17:24.160 --> 17:29.760]  It is the ingredient in human vomit that gives human vomit its distinctive smell
[17:29.760 --> 17:32.320]  And so that's what they wanted to do to release this place
[17:32.320 --> 17:39.240]  But what they're talking about doing is a crime and so we've got James O'Keefe on is going to be talking to us about this
[17:39.440 --> 17:41.280]  Investigation as the second part comes out today
[17:41.280 --> 17:42.440]  We're going to play that for you as well
[17:42.440 --> 17:49.280]  And now we see that there are ads in dozens of cities offering protesters up to $2,500 to agitate
[17:49.480 --> 17:53.640]  At the Trump inaugural this is from the Washington Times. You can see this on the drudge report
[17:53.680 --> 17:59.720]  They say Donald Trump may have a point about paid protesters jobs running ads more than 20 cities more than 20 cities
[17:59.720 --> 18:06.560]  Offer $2,500 a month for agitators to demonstrate at inaugural events now the ad says
[18:07.400 --> 18:11.680]  We are the largest private grassroots support organization in the United States
[18:11.680 --> 18:14.920]  I would say if you're paying people that much money, it is astroturf
[18:15.440 --> 18:20.480]  By definition they say we're currently seeking operatives to help send a strong message at
[18:20.480 --> 18:29.240]  Upcoming inauguration protests. They say our standard per event pay is $50 an hour as long as you agree to participate in six events per year
[18:29.440 --> 18:32.840]  How's that instead of a fight for 15 you can get
[18:33.320 --> 18:35.080]  55 oh
[18:35.080 --> 18:37.080]  $50 an hour
[18:37.080 --> 18:43.240]  Absolutely amazing now as I said before Alex is going to have a report at the bottom of the hour about how the Democrats are fighting Trump
[18:43.240 --> 18:47.400]  And I want you to understand how the Washington establishment including
[18:47.400 --> 18:50.660]  Republicans are fighting against Donald Trump
[18:51.680 --> 18:54.880]  One of the things that the Washington Post points out and I think this is very clear
[18:55.200 --> 19:00.760]  We have become frustrated with Republican parties one of the reasons that Donald Trump succeeded because we voted for Paul Ryan
[19:00.760 --> 19:06.840]  We voted for Mitch McConnell and the rest of them. They promised us that they would follow certain policy proposals
[19:06.840 --> 19:08.280]  We said we want the borders patrolled
[19:08.280 --> 19:13.560]  We don't want Obamacare mandates and so forth and so on want you to cut taxes once you cut spending in
[19:13.560 --> 19:19.320]  Washington and they don't do it and the Washington Post admits that I think they say this very succinctly listen this
[19:19.840 --> 19:24.960]  Opening statement of this article. I say if Republicans appeal the Affordable Care Act. That's Obamacare
[19:25.440 --> 19:27.880]  They will have achieved something rare
[19:28.560 --> 19:35.280]  Even when conservative policymakers have complete control of government as Republicans will in Washington once Trump assumes a presidency
[19:35.280 --> 19:40.160]  They have generally failed to eliminate major social programs after these programs have been established
[19:40.160 --> 19:48.840]  Yeah, they fail to do what they said they're going to do and we're gonna take a look at Paul Ryan because he is exhibit a
[19:49.280 --> 19:55.200]  This is a guy who has opposed Trump on ethics. He has opposed him on borders
[19:55.200 --> 20:01.120]  He's opposed him on by American and we're also gonna take a look at how John Boehner left and immediately became a lobbyist
[20:01.120 --> 20:02.600]  Against our heads every day
[20:02.600 --> 20:08.080]  But now a landmark US government study confirms increased health risks from exposure to EMF radiation

[23:28.600 --> 23:35.560]  In these uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water if your current plan includes using a
[23:35.560 --> 23:42.760]  Fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire then there's a much better way the Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove

[24:15.720 --> 24:18.240]  He's gonna talk about the Democrat opposition to Trump
[24:18.440 --> 24:23.240]  I'm gonna talk in this segment about the Republican opposition and the leader of that Republican opposition
[24:23.240 --> 24:25.440]  Paul Ryan, but before I get to that
[24:25.440 --> 24:28.960]  I just want to remind you that our sale that began at the beginning of the year
[24:28.960 --> 24:32.720]  I make our bodies great again initiative is ending this week with the inauguration
[24:32.720 --> 24:38.840]  And of course you can still go to info wars life calm and find discounts of anywhere from 20 to 30% off
[24:39.080 --> 24:45.600]  We have brain force 30% off super male vitality 30% off survival shield x2 nascent iodine
[24:45.600 --> 24:52.240]  That's 30% off and then at 20% off. We have liver shield prostaguard knockout our natural sleep
[24:52.240 --> 24:57.880]  Aid and also secret 12 our vitamin b12 liquid formulation
[24:57.880 --> 25:03.200]  So you'll find all of that at info wars life calm that sale will be ending very soon
[25:03.200 --> 25:08.520]  Also, we do have back in stock DNA force and we have given you since it's been out of stock for a while
[25:08.520 --> 25:10.640]  We've given you a 10% out of the gate
[25:11.560 --> 25:15.280]  Discount to help you stock back up. This is an emergency shipment that we got back in
[25:15.320 --> 25:20.440]  It's not as big as we typically are able to get so it may sell out before too much longer
[25:20.440 --> 25:22.880]  And it will be months before we can get that back in stock again
[25:22.880 --> 25:30.200]  And one of the reasons why this happens is because it's so difficult to get bio PQQ and get it in the form that we want it
[25:30.240 --> 25:33.080]  It's very expensive very difficult to produce
[25:33.080 --> 25:38.280]  So a 10% discount is a big savings off of that get it while it's in stock right now as I point out
[25:38.280 --> 25:41.760]  It's been out of stock. It's going to be going out of stock again shortly
[25:42.280 --> 25:44.040]  Very very important
[25:44.040 --> 25:50.480]  Nutrient for you. And if you look at the studies there are 175 clinical studies that back up the importance of
[25:51.200 --> 25:55.240]  Bio PQQ just that one ingredient in there. And of course, it's not the only ingredient
[25:55.240 --> 26:00.600]  There's many other things that help your body to maintain a DNA that
[26:01.120 --> 26:03.520]  Well to put it simply just doesn't unravel
[26:03.520 --> 26:06.800]  You have these in caps of telomeres that have to be maintained
[26:06.800 --> 26:12.200]  And there's a lot of research that shows that your life expectancy can kind of be predicted by the length of those telomeres
[26:12.200 --> 26:15.080]  They gradually start to get shorter and shorter as we get older
[26:15.640 --> 26:19.240]  And if you think of your DNA strand as a twisted shoestring
[26:19.800 --> 26:24.720]  Once that telomere that cap on the end of your shoestring disappears the DNA strand start to
[26:25.360 --> 26:30.240]  Unravel and that's one of the things that is I guess the timer on our lives that are there
[26:30.240 --> 26:35.800]  But you can find all those at infowarslife.com now talked about Paul Ryan. I just mentioned this briefly
[26:35.800 --> 26:41.160]  In so many different ways we've seen articles coming out the end of the last week and through the weekend
[26:41.920 --> 26:47.040]  With Paul Ryan saying well, you know, I think this lobbying ban is a very dangerous proposal
[26:47.040 --> 26:52.080]  I and I really don't think that we can do this lobbying a ban that Donald Trump wants to what does he want to do?
[26:52.080 --> 26:54.080]  He wants to put a ban on
[26:54.120 --> 26:56.960]  people getting involved as lobbyists for
[26:57.760 --> 27:01.320]  Five years move it from one year to five years. I believe it's what it is
[27:01.320 --> 27:05.520]  he's going to lengthen it and he's going to put a lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign governments and
[27:07.200 --> 27:09.200]  now
[27:09.200 --> 27:14.480]  Paul Ryan is saying that's dangerous. Here's a good example of this. Okay, as they oppose Donald Trump
[27:14.480 --> 27:18.200]  It looks like they may oppose him on by American. That's been one of the focuses of
[27:18.960 --> 27:24.600]  the Trump campaign and as the Hill pointed out last year when they had a
[27:24.600 --> 27:32.280]  Water infrastructure bill come up. It had a by American clause in there and Paul Ryan led the opposition to get that stripped out
[27:32.280 --> 27:34.720]  Why was it stripped out? Well former Speaker?
[27:35.760 --> 27:43.200]  Boehner had left in October and this bill had come up five months later in March and what did Boehner do?
[27:43.960 --> 27:51.560]  They worked actually had foreign steel companies that tapped the lobbying firm that Boehner went to work for after he was speaker of the house
[27:51.560 --> 27:58.000]  so you got foreign steel companies going to a lobbying firm that employs John Boehner and
[27:59.200 --> 28:06.600]  Some of these are guess what a major Russian steel company came in and said, you know, we don't we don't like that by American provision in there
[28:06.600 --> 28:08.120]  Now they got some facilities in the US
[28:08.120 --> 28:13.720]  There's also a company called California Steel Industries. It's owned by Japanese and Brazilian companies
[28:13.720 --> 28:20.400]  Japanese steel company owns them. They hired the firm that John Boehner is with to take out the by American clause
[28:21.200 --> 28:26.560]  Now this is a couple of different issues. One of them is do we really want the federal government building our infrastructure?
[28:26.560 --> 28:28.560]  I think that's a bad idea in the first place
[28:28.840 --> 28:33.080]  But the other part of this shows how there is a revolving door
[28:34.040 --> 28:42.160]  Between those who are power brokers going out and becoming lobbyists and we have seen this from all these former speakers both Democrat and Republican
[28:42.160 --> 28:46.800]  That's why it is so important to have some to increase this
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.800]  So that you extend it from a one-year ban to a five-year ban
[28:52.520 --> 28:58.240]  See Paul Ryan says that's very dangerous because it would affect people like John Boehner who put him in power
[28:58.680 --> 29:02.960]  Because John Boehner was already involved. His firm was already shutting down things
[29:03.800 --> 29:05.000]  immediately
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.320]  afterwards and we also have as the press and we talked about the press coming after
[29:10.320 --> 29:18.160]  Donald Trump and saying no look at these popularity polls. They're the lowest we've had for a president-elect the way they spend
[29:18.760 --> 29:24.160]  The information that comes out of course one of the other things that Paul Ryan did and he was picked by the elitist
[29:24.920 --> 29:29.520]  To be the running mate for Mitt Romney. I'm sure he's looking at a presidential run in the future
[29:29.520 --> 29:34.320]  And he is grooming himself for that and we have the Washington Post saying in a remarkable exchange
[29:34.920 --> 29:36.200]  Paul Ryan
[29:36.200 --> 29:38.200]  exposes the cruelty of Trumpism
[29:38.200 --> 29:45.720]  Because he comes after the idea that we should have borders that we should have immigration laws stay with us Alex Jones will be right back
[29:48.640 --> 29:55.560]  We're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.840 --> 30:05.920]  Nobody loves Barack Obama more than Barack Obama in his speech during the Chicago Cubs World Series visit to the White House
[30:05.920 --> 30:10.800]  He referred to himself a humble 40 times in his farewell address one of his many farewells
[30:10.800 --> 30:15.880]  He referred to himself 75 times when campaigning for Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia last year
[30:15.880 --> 30:22.680]  He referred to himself 137 times after the police shooting in Dallas Obama delivered an address in which he referred to himself
[30:22.920 --> 30:28.760]  45 times not once referencing himself as one to blame after a mass shooting in Oregon in a 12 minute speech
[30:28.760 --> 30:34.180]  He referenced himself 28 times at the Democratic National Convention Obama referred to himself a whopping
[30:34.180 --> 30:39.580]  119 times some attendees were confused and thought he was running again when speaking in India last year
[30:39.580 --> 30:41.740]  He referred to himself 118 times
[30:41.740 --> 30:47.140]  It's an international love fest in a speech on jobs in Ohio in 2010 Barack referenced himself
[30:47.940 --> 30:53.380]  132 times, but I want you to I want you to understand this is not about me
[30:53.380 --> 30:59.020]  And every morning he eats a bowl of barrios to start his day. This is Owen shroyer for info wars calm

[33:16.460 --> 33:33.820]  If we find out they don't somebody on behalf of Donald Trump was on the phone or an email relations with somebody in Russia or the
[33:33.820 --> 33:38.780]  American the ambassador to America from Russia and there was some sort of as you call it collusion
[33:38.860 --> 33:45.580]  Then what does that make Trump subject to impeachment? What do you mean by not legitimate? Just generally what you mean by the term?
[33:45.580 --> 33:49.580]  Well, here's what I thought there was a connection. There was collusion your term
[33:49.820 --> 33:53.460]  Well, here's what I'm trying to get to if we discover that
[33:54.420 --> 34:02.940]  Donald Trump are his advocates played a role in helping to devise strategy if they're the ones who came up with crooked Hillary
[34:02.940 --> 34:09.820]  If they're the ones who came up with she's ill something's wrong with her energy and the way that he
[34:10.460 --> 34:14.620]  Basically, you know described her in the campaign. I think that is
[34:14.620 --> 34:20.380]  Is something that would put the question squarely on the table whether or not he should be impeached
[34:21.180 --> 34:24.940]  So you think it's that you could have an impeachable offense before you take office in other words?
[34:25.420 --> 34:27.900]  Well, I think that at the point that
[34:29.500 --> 34:36.460]  Investigations discover and can confirm and document any of that that they had a role
[34:37.020 --> 34:39.020]  In helping to strategize
[34:39.020 --> 34:46.060]  They had a role in attempting to determine the outcome that in many ways they use the information
[34:46.460 --> 34:53.900]  That they got from the DNC when they hacked into our emails, etc. If that was used against Hillary Clinton in some ways
[34:54.140 --> 34:59.500]  Yes, I think that's impeachable. You're saying you're looking for an economic message that speaks to the needs
[35:00.140 --> 35:04.940]  Of the middle class and of working people of all colors and I applaud you for attempting to find that message
[35:04.940 --> 35:09.980]  So for eight years President Obama has been telling us he wants to lower drug prices
[35:10.380 --> 35:14.060]  Because they're too high right and that was part of the purpose of obama care, but it didn't work as you know
[35:14.060 --> 35:19.340]  They're still too high right right a very fast way to do that would be to reimport drugs from canada
[35:19.660 --> 35:25.020]  Donald trump is calling for this. Why in eight years did barack obama not call for that?
[35:25.660 --> 35:30.540]  barack obama called for so many fixes to obama care
[35:30.540 --> 35:36.700]  And you understand you understand what republicans did when that man was first inaugurated
[35:36.700 --> 35:41.500]  They said on day one they were going to obstruct and they successfully did in many ways
[35:41.980 --> 35:45.100]  He and the administration were very clear. There are lots of things
[35:45.900 --> 35:51.100]  That's still fixed without care. There are lots of problems. What about re importing drugs from canada?
[35:51.180 --> 35:56.700]  If you don't have somebody for that in congress if you don't have any leadership on the other side who understands
[35:56.700 --> 36:03.100]  They need to put the american people first instead of trying to destroy government because they didn't like barack obama
[36:03.660 --> 36:05.660]  That is that is what is wrong
[36:06.140 --> 36:09.740]  That is what you're you're above this democrat. Look, I don't want to relitigate it
[36:09.740 --> 36:16.940]  But if you're going to generalizations that aren't true democrats held all three branches of government when obama came into office
[36:16.940 --> 36:24.700]  Look, I'm just asking here. You have Donald Trump. That's transparently false here. You have the obstruction that the republican party did
[36:24.700 --> 36:28.620]  To fixing the public air to making sure that we could continue to get
[36:29.180 --> 36:34.060]  The question is going to pass on is was abysmal. Do you know what it is if you deny it?
[36:34.140 --> 36:38.780]  Do you know what that's on you? That's on you and your therapist can talk about that
[36:39.580 --> 36:45.420]  I'm not denying that republicans tried to stop barack obama's agenda and sometimes it was justified and others it wasn't
[36:45.500 --> 36:49.580]  But I'm asking you this very all of the time. I'm asking you a very specific question
[36:49.580 --> 36:56.780]  And I'm asking you do you agree with Donald Trump's plan to reimport drugs at a lower price from Canada?
[36:56.780 --> 37:01.260]  American drugs have been sold in Canada lower price bringing them back. The pharmaceutical companies are against it
[37:01.260 --> 37:05.980]  Obama did not push for it. Trump is now pushing for it. What's your response to that? Are you for that or against it simple?
[37:05.980 --> 37:10.300]  I haven't seen the exact plan you're talking about. So I'm not going to play this gotcha game
[37:10.540 --> 37:12.540]  I'm not gonna sit here and cheerlead
[37:12.540 --> 37:19.340]  Are you for the idea or not is refusing to even celebrate Martin Luther King day and understand
[37:19.420 --> 37:22.460]  Why do you always bring it back to race? I'm asking you that I cannot
[37:22.460 --> 37:26.860]  That's where this segment started Tucker. You're the one who picked the topic. I'm asking you about health care
[37:26.940 --> 37:31.180]  I'm asking you about lowering drug prices and Trump. Look, I'm not endorsing everything Trump does
[37:31.180 --> 37:35.500]  I'm just saying here. He's doing something that overlaps with what democrats have wanted to do for a long time
[37:36.220 --> 37:40.220]  Decades and he's saying yeah, let's do it and I'm asking you are you forward or not?
[37:40.220 --> 37:44.220]  Are you so partisan you can't just say yeah, I don't like Trump, but that's a good idea. You know what?
[37:45.180 --> 37:47.980]  Maxine Waters the California Congresswoman
[37:48.860 --> 37:50.860]  went on CNBC with
[37:51.100 --> 37:55.100]  Chris Matthews last night to call for Trump's impeachment
[37:56.540 --> 38:00.940]  She's now saying that with no evidence or no facts that the term crooked Hillary
[38:02.140 --> 38:05.820]  Came from the Russians and that the Russians were actually in command
[38:05.820 --> 38:11.900]  Of Trump telling him everything to say now anybody that knows Trump or anybody that study Trump knows
[38:11.900 --> 38:16.380]  This is the biggest joke on the planet. The one person in control Donald Trump. He is Donald Trump
[38:16.860 --> 38:21.020]  We also have the lady who is in the running me the new DNC chair
[38:21.660 --> 38:23.340]  I guess mr. Green
[38:23.340 --> 38:27.900]  Going on Tucker Carlson last night and when Carlson would bring up issues like
[38:28.380 --> 38:33.020]  Trump's plan to cut prescription drug costs not with a good governmental
[38:33.020 --> 38:35.260]  Law, but just opening it up to competition
[38:36.060 --> 38:39.900]  She wouldn't respond and said he won't celebrate Martin Luther King Day. So he's bad
[38:40.620 --> 38:42.620]  even though he is
[38:43.180 --> 38:45.180]  Observing Martin Luther King day. I mean he did
[38:45.580 --> 38:50.860]  I made comments about it a few years ago and this year as well, but none of that even matters
[38:51.820 --> 38:54.700]  They just go back to race on every every issue
[38:55.420 --> 39:00.620]  But because the public isn't buying that anymore and they've now moved on to say that he's a Russian agent
[39:00.620 --> 39:02.620]  and they've gone from saying that
[39:03.100 --> 39:05.100]  They just kind of influenced the election
[39:05.420 --> 39:09.340]  To now claiming that they're actually telling him what to say
[39:09.980 --> 39:11.740]  So it doesn't work anymore
[39:11.740 --> 39:14.860]  To cause my racist you now just come out. You call him a Russian agent
[39:14.860 --> 39:22.140]  We all know that the point is though is it's getting more desperate as we knew it would just three days out ladies and gentlemen
[39:23.180 --> 39:25.180]  We are now about three and a half days out
[39:25.580 --> 39:27.580]  from this historic event taking place
[39:27.580 --> 39:30.460]  And Paul Watson wrote a big story yesterday
[39:31.100 --> 39:36.380]  Concerning a NBC source and it looks credible. I'm not saying the report's credible
[39:36.380 --> 39:42.060]  I'm saying that the source it looks like he is at NBC because we have quite a few sources. I'll just leave it at that
[39:42.860 --> 39:43.980]  but
[39:43.980 --> 39:45.980]  they're saying that there is a
[39:46.860 --> 39:48.860]  a tape compilation
[39:49.020 --> 39:51.740]  Going back over the 14 seasons or whatever
[39:52.460 --> 39:55.340]  Of the apprentice with him sitting in the chair
[39:55.340 --> 39:59.980]  Saying things like his son's retarded and making dirty jokes
[39:59.980 --> 40:01.100]  I mean
[40:01.100 --> 40:04.940]  And supposedly the inward you know the thing about Trump whether this is true or not
[40:05.420 --> 40:09.260]  Is the top people that have known him for a long time is he does like to
[40:09.980 --> 40:12.860]  Basically tell dirty jokes anything that a comedian would do
[40:13.420 --> 40:15.420]  And he doesn't even do it that often
[40:15.660 --> 40:17.660]  But almost like a stress reliever
[40:17.820 --> 40:19.820]  Or a way to break the ice
[40:19.980 --> 40:24.540]  He will sit there and a lot of times actually deprecate himself as well
[40:24.540 --> 40:26.540]  You know call himself retarded
[40:27.340 --> 40:29.340]  Call himself names
[40:29.500 --> 40:34.540]  I'm not defending any of this, but we've all known high powered people that have to focus all the time
[40:35.180 --> 40:37.580]  That sometimes we're letting off steam act pretty stupid
[40:38.300 --> 40:39.980]  I don't personally do it
[40:39.980 --> 40:41.580]  in those ways
[40:41.580 --> 40:45.180]  But I do act silly sometimes, but I'm not even getting into all of that
[40:45.660 --> 40:48.460]  The point is is that they would have already released this tape
[40:49.500 --> 40:51.500]  If it was real
[40:51.500 --> 40:56.220]  Previously during the election, if it is quote real
[40:56.860 --> 40:59.260]  The word is it's so heavily edited
[41:00.300 --> 41:02.300]  with jump cuts
[41:02.300 --> 41:06.220]  That it's just like when people take stuff I've said and edit it together and take it out of context
[41:07.100 --> 41:09.340]  Now if he did ever use the n-word
[41:10.460 --> 41:16.140]  Even in any context, it's not right because people can then use it and basically twist it
[41:17.340 --> 41:18.700]  but
[41:18.700 --> 41:20.700]  It's used as a power word
[41:20.700 --> 41:26.140]  But frankly growing up where I heard it used was by black folks. I was always offended by it personally
[41:26.940 --> 41:28.300]  just because
[41:28.300 --> 41:30.300]  I was basically brought up that
[41:31.020 --> 41:34.380]  Putting people down for what groups are part of is what losers do
[41:35.100 --> 41:37.100]  But regardless of that
[41:38.460 --> 41:44.060]  Trump is trying to cut the taxes. He's trying to bring jobs back. He's already bringing jobs back to Detroit
[41:44.380 --> 41:47.100]  Who does that help? It helps everybody particularly it helps black people
[41:47.740 --> 41:49.740]  Trump's trying to cut prescription drug costs
[41:49.740 --> 41:56.700]  Trump's already bringing back hundreds of billions of dollars jobs. Trump is actually focusing on these communities. See Obama
[41:57.180 --> 42:00.220]  Didn't care because he knew he had the black communities
[42:00.780 --> 42:02.780]  With trump. He's actually trying to work
[42:03.020 --> 42:09.340]  To go out and empower these communities and actually deliver and actually take these communities away from the democratic party
[42:09.580 --> 42:15.580]  By making them prosperous and successful. That's steven bannon's plan. That's trump's plan. That's the real plan
[42:15.580 --> 42:19.020]  And that's why the media is invoking race so much
[42:19.900 --> 42:21.740]  is because
[42:21.740 --> 42:23.740]  That they want that to be the new
[42:24.460 --> 42:26.460]  national identity
[42:26.460 --> 42:28.060]  They want that to be
[42:28.060 --> 42:33.420]  What you have as a pastime is obsessing over what color you are which on martin lucer king day
[42:34.220 --> 42:36.220]  We should have all asked ourselves
[42:36.540 --> 42:42.540]  How have we turned things upside down the very people the claim they love martin lucer king all day in the control media
[42:43.260 --> 42:45.260]  They're the very ones
[42:45.260 --> 42:48.940]  That are doing the opposite of he said he said we should be in a color-blind society
[42:49.260 --> 42:55.100]  And judge people off of the character of their deeds and what to actually stand for not off of what group they're in
[42:55.500 --> 43:01.580]  So this is clear divide and conquer and again this nation is majority minority in most areas
[43:01.660 --> 43:05.020]  It'll soon be a hundred percent, you know, uh in every state
[43:05.500 --> 43:12.300]  Uh, the minorities are the quote majority. Okay, it'll soon be in every state all 50
[43:12.300 --> 43:20.540]  They don't want you to have the birthright of the second amendment and private property and family values and free association
[43:21.020 --> 43:23.020]  They want to invoke race
[43:23.020 --> 43:25.020]  And then tie it to everything good
[43:25.500 --> 43:30.460]  Everything successful and everything independent to totally and completely
[43:31.100 --> 43:36.540]  Dominate and control your life. I know I've talked about this a lot, but let me get back to the big issue here
[43:36.540 --> 43:45.100]  This is part of a concerted effort and I've been telling you it was coming that in the days leading up to trump's inauguration
[43:45.740 --> 43:50.940]  That we would hear about all this supposed new dirt that was about to come out that we would hear for calls for impeachment
[43:51.260 --> 43:53.100]  And now you're seeing it happen
[43:53.100 --> 43:58.380]  And then you see all the massive funding for the race-based groups like black lives matter and other sorrows groups
[43:58.860 --> 44:00.140]  converging
[44:00.140 --> 44:01.740]  on dc
[44:01.740 --> 44:08.060]  And people meeting in dc restaurants have been caught on tape openly talking about putting acid gas into
[44:08.700 --> 44:11.660]  Air conditioning systems and and and and assaulting people
[44:12.380 --> 44:16.220]  This is all part of the preparation for a triggering event
[44:16.620 --> 44:22.700]  That's going to be race-based in the next few days and it could be this mbc tape edited made up
[44:23.340 --> 44:25.100]  Who knows I mean
[44:25.100 --> 44:28.300]  Look, I mean, I wouldn't saw star wars of the new movie
[44:29.580 --> 44:30.940]  Rogue one
[44:30.940 --> 44:34.220]  And princess leo was back in it governor tarkin was back in it
[44:34.860 --> 44:40.460]  They're coming out reportedly with movies with john wane where he returns and basically stars the whole movie himself
[44:41.420 --> 44:45.100]  They can edit and do whatever they want. I'm not saying that's happening here
[44:45.660 --> 44:49.980]  I'm saying they would have already released this. It was so damning and the word is
[44:50.860 --> 44:56.220]  Not from our source but from others that have talked about this supposed tape is again. It's second long edited together
[44:56.220 --> 45:02.620]  Jump cuts that they're scared to release because they know it's edited out of context, but but let's just move on from that
[45:04.380 --> 45:05.980]  Trump
[45:05.980 --> 45:09.100]  If this comes out and they've twisted or they're demonizing him
[45:09.660 --> 45:15.260]  These are just own the whole deal and say that people sit around they joke around they try to be shocking
[45:15.740 --> 45:19.820]  You know, it's wrong that he did it, but that he was already making up
[45:19.820 --> 45:26.140]  For things like that and and things that have happened in the past that other people have done that's wrong
[45:26.300 --> 45:31.820]  But really trying to focus on truly empowering all the communities in this country and bringing people together
[45:32.220 --> 45:36.860]  And then he should come out and talk about the fact that 51 of black people are more
[45:37.340 --> 45:41.980]  On average never get out of the womb in this country and that we should work to make sure that that genocide
[45:42.540 --> 45:48.220]  Created by Margaret Sanger and pushed by the leftist is stopped and then he should go on a tour
[45:48.220 --> 45:50.220]  Of black churches
[45:50.780 --> 45:52.620]  And go up there
[45:52.620 --> 45:56.460]  With the folks and pray with them and hug everybody and have national unity
[45:57.100 --> 46:03.420]  That's what we need is to come together against the globalist and realize that they're out to get us all and that's my final point
[46:04.700 --> 46:06.300]  Ladies and gentlemen
[46:06.300 --> 46:09.100]  They are growing humans that are part animal
[46:09.820 --> 46:13.820]  In cows and in other large mammals that they're harvesting their organs
[46:13.820 --> 46:20.380]  Humanoids have been created. They don't have any rights. They are put to horrible experimentation. We talk about animal rights
[46:20.380 --> 46:24.460]  Fine. What about human rights or what about clone rights or what about chimera rights?
[46:24.780 --> 46:30.380]  And what about the globalist funding islamists is taking over and killing hundreds of thousands of people all over the middle east in africa
[46:31.020 --> 46:34.780]  What about all the horrible things obama's done funding the muslim brotherhood?
[46:35.260 --> 46:38.940]  What about all the major wars they've been finding as you're trying to start a war with russia?
[46:38.940 --> 46:45.820]  What about all the genetic engineering and the and the gmo and the glyphosates that have caused hundreds of millions of women worldwide?
[46:46.140 --> 46:48.140]  for a portally get breast cancer
[46:48.700 --> 46:54.940]  These are the real holocausts that are going on and instead all we ever obsess over is what the media tells us to get obsessed over
[46:55.260 --> 47:00.380]  And these big foe issues they bring up that we're all completely sick and tired of
[47:01.180 --> 47:02.860]  but quite frankly
[47:02.860 --> 47:04.860]  I can say that I've
[47:05.180 --> 47:07.180]  Never done anything consciously
[47:07.180 --> 47:11.580]  Racist in in fact. I am so sick and tired of
[47:12.540 --> 47:14.540]  Of having every major
[47:15.100 --> 47:16.780]  issue out there
[47:16.780 --> 47:18.780]  Basically poison this cornucopia
[47:19.500 --> 47:21.500]  of of of
[47:21.580 --> 47:23.020]  disinformation
[47:23.020 --> 47:25.020]  And we're all under attack
[47:25.660 --> 47:30.540]  That's what i'm trying to get across to people does that mean that there aren't racist white people absolutely
[47:30.540 --> 47:32.380]  I mean there aren't racist white people absolutely
[47:32.380 --> 47:39.260]  But the point is at the end of the day, we're all being manipulated against each other by the globalists who are scientific about this
[47:39.260 --> 47:40.780]  And that is the ultimate
[47:40.780 --> 47:46.300]  Anti-human agenda being carried out by these psychopaths and it is a billion times bigger
[47:47.100 --> 47:52.780]  Than the kkk or the new black pamphlet party or any of these mindless idiot groups. That's what i'm getting at
[47:53.100 --> 47:55.980]  So i'm not here as an apology for this tape that may exist or
[47:56.620 --> 48:00.300]  May not exist. I think it probably doesn't or it's totally edited. They would have released already as I said
[48:00.300 --> 48:01.500]  But
[48:01.500 --> 48:03.500]  I'm only raising this
[48:03.740 --> 48:05.580]  as an example
[48:05.580 --> 48:11.020]  Of how far we've fallen and how we get distracted like a bull with a red cape getting distracted
[48:11.260 --> 48:16.860]  By all these side issues by the big globalist media that we know is the enemy that we know is lying to us
[48:17.180 --> 48:23.580]  That we know is is it is constantly playing us off against each other and lying to the public and getting us into these giant wars
[48:23.580 --> 48:29.500]  To bring down other sovereign nations and put radical jihadists in control. We know the new world order is the enemy
[48:30.300 --> 48:37.180]  And now they're openly trying to overturn the people's will with trump and building towards something completely
[48:38.060 --> 48:39.660]  organized
[48:39.660 --> 48:47.100]  Where we can't even get prescription drug costs cut because racism is invoked even though it doesn't even make sense to invoke it or
[48:48.060 --> 48:52.460]  John lewis comes out and criticizes trump calling on russian spy and trump says hey
[48:52.460 --> 48:56.300]  That's not very nice. Why don't you work with me? They turn that into racism
[48:57.820 --> 49:02.540]  Criticizing someone who's criticized you on that issue is not racism
[49:03.020 --> 49:06.780]  But again, this is an assault on logic an assault on common sense
[49:06.780 --> 49:11.100]  And we all just have to stop letting it have such power over us
[49:11.100 --> 49:13.100]  That's the real control of racism
[49:13.660 --> 49:18.460]  Is the fact that it makes everybody paranoid about each other and makes everybody act weird and be uncomfortable
[49:18.460 --> 49:23.660]  The real issue in this country anyone I'd call racism. It's the fact that we've all been made uncomfortable
[49:24.220 --> 49:27.660]  And and now all this balkanization is worse than any time in my life
[49:28.220 --> 49:30.700]  And it's very very sad because we're all being targeted
[49:31.260 --> 49:36.460]  With the glyphosates and the fluoride and the GMOs and the electromagnetic radiation all this other crap
[49:37.340 --> 49:41.820]  And then meanwhile if we don't come together we have no chance of ever coming out of this now
[49:41.820 --> 49:47.500]  Coming up today. I'm going to be back in studio at the time you're hearing this. I'm landing in Austin, Texas
[49:48.700 --> 49:53.180]  And we're going to have a huge announcement at 130 central. I'm just going to leave it at that
[49:53.740 --> 49:57.100]  I'm not going to even tell you who's coming up or what we're going to be breaking down
[49:57.260 --> 50:04.300]  Other than the fact that the press is now being targeted and and high level supporters and boosters of trump are being targeted for death
[50:05.100 --> 50:07.340]  Okay, so uh again
[50:07.340 --> 50:12.220]  I've been on a work occasion. I am now back
[50:13.020 --> 50:17.820]  Uh, and I'm going to be going to dc tomorrow and I'll be the middle of that. So please pray for us
[50:18.380 --> 50:21.580]  And please pray for this country and please pray for justice and people to come together
[50:22.300 --> 50:27.180]  Soros admits he's flooding dc with his operative. So it's going to be extremely extremely dangerous, obviously
[50:27.180 --> 50:29.180]  But this is something we've got to do
[50:29.180 --> 50:33.500]  And I want to keep everybody that is coming to dc to stand up for the first amendment in our electoral process

[54:19.260 --> 54:23.500]  As you just heard alex jones, he's going to be coming in at the last half hour of the show
[54:23.980 --> 54:28.620]  There's a huge announcement concerning attacks of a lethal nature. That's all i know about it
[54:28.700 --> 54:30.300]  So you'll be able to
[54:30.300 --> 54:36.860]  Hear that as it's introduced. So it's something that he's kept quite close to the chest, but he's going to be breaking that
[54:37.740 --> 54:39.740]  At the bottom of the show
[54:39.740 --> 54:46.620]  Before i get back to the news i just want to remind you that our special make our bodies great again our 2017 initiative to improve your health
[54:47.100 --> 54:50.140]  Help you to do that by offering some discounts on some of the

[55:24.380 --> 55:26.380]  I was talking about the opposition
[55:26.380 --> 55:29.660]  To donald trump that's coming from paul ryan for example
[55:30.460 --> 55:32.460]  You know, he has proposed
[55:33.100 --> 55:38.380]  As an ethics rule that and this would just be executive branch officials
[55:38.860 --> 55:45.900]  This is not what the what the house representatives or senate would do but that executive branch officials people working for him
[55:46.460 --> 55:52.140]  Would not be able to become lobbyists for five years currently right now. They have a ban in place of one year
[55:52.140 --> 55:54.140]  So he would extend that from one year to five years
[55:54.140 --> 55:57.020]  He would also say if you're going to come in and work at my cabinet
[55:57.500 --> 55:59.500]  As a senior executive official
[55:59.820 --> 56:03.660]  You're not ever going to be able to lobby on the behalf of a foreign government
[56:04.300 --> 56:07.660]  And paul ryan thinks that's a dangerous idea dangerous idea
[56:08.380 --> 56:10.380]  I mean, we've just seen the situation
[56:10.940 --> 56:14.060]  We ported that at just before we went to the bottom of the hour
[56:14.380 --> 56:18.940]  How as we look at paul ryan and others they say the hill said
[56:19.260 --> 56:22.540]  What are they going to do because we got another infrastructure bill coming up this year?
[56:22.540 --> 56:26.780]  And last year paul ryan led the fight to strike by american
[56:27.500 --> 56:31.100]  Out of the infrastructure bill last year. So we got another one coming up this year
[56:31.100 --> 56:35.340]  So we contacted him the hill contacted him and paul ryan said no comment
[56:35.980 --> 56:37.980]  They had no comment from his office
[56:38.460 --> 56:39.980]  And we also know
[56:39.980 --> 56:43.100]  That the guy that he replaced the guy that helped him to get his position john bainer
[56:43.820 --> 56:50.300]  Had left in october 2015 in march of 2016 five months later when they're doing this bill this infrastructure bill
[56:50.300 --> 56:52.860]  Where they stripped out the by-american clause last year
[56:53.660 --> 56:55.100]  that
[56:55.100 --> 56:56.540]  his
[56:56.540 --> 56:59.260]  Company that he went to work for a lobbyist company there
[57:00.060 --> 57:04.220]  And washington dc was representing foreign steel concerns
[57:04.940 --> 57:07.740]  And saying we want to get this by-american stuff out of there
[57:08.140 --> 57:13.260]  See that's the swamp that we're talking about and of course, Nancy Pelosi is a big part of that as well
[57:13.740 --> 57:15.740]  Nancy Pelosi and her insider trading
[57:16.220 --> 57:19.740]  They create this they get caught in the middle of the market
[57:19.740 --> 57:22.860]  They get caught on it. They say there's no controlling legal authority here. There's not a problem
[57:22.860 --> 57:26.700]  So we create the stock act we wait till you don't pay any attention and the six months later boom
[57:27.180 --> 57:28.540]  We got it
[57:28.540 --> 57:30.540]  So it has absolutely no effect
[57:30.780 --> 57:32.700]  Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren
[57:32.700 --> 57:39.580]  They're all involved in these types of ethics insider trading. Nancy Pelosi's family has made a fortune of that kind of insider trading
[57:40.140 --> 57:45.500]  And of course paul ryan is part of that swamp as well a big part of that swamp. And so when you look at the new york times article
[57:46.140 --> 57:48.140]  angst simmers in washington
[57:48.140 --> 57:52.860]  As a trump presidency nears understand what they're concerned about is protecting their financial
[57:53.420 --> 57:57.100]  Situation they want to make sure they're going to be high-paid lobbyists that they're going to stay there forever
[57:57.340 --> 58:00.940]  They're going to hammer donald trump and say you're here for the money. Aren't you?
[58:01.740 --> 58:04.620]  Everything that he does are going to say you got a conflict of interest you own this hotel
[58:04.620 --> 58:07.820]  That's a conflict of interest you got somebody that's from a foreign government staying in your hotel
[58:07.820 --> 58:13.100]  That's a conflict of interest and that's what donald trump was originally going to talk about now the press conference
[58:13.100 --> 58:18.860]  But then they dumped that dirt on him the dirty dossier. He has a plan to deal with that
[58:19.260 --> 58:25.420]  But it really is about them being concerned that the trump organization isn't going to just enact a hiring freeze
[58:25.500 --> 58:30.140]  Which would be something that would benefit all americans, but he's actually going to do spending cuts
[58:30.780 --> 58:34.540]  Which would even benefit us more but not the washington dc crowd
[58:35.100 --> 58:39.660]  They're worried that there's going to be some actual cuts of workers. They will listen to me right back
[58:39.660 --> 58:42.620]  You are listening to gcn

[58:53.020 --> 58:59.420]  Why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most
[58:59.500 --> 59:04.700]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system
[59:04.700 --> 59:12.940]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism
[59:13.020 --> 59:15.020]  Right now with all the refugees
[59:15.260 --> 59:20.620]  Spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites

[59:54.860 --> 59:56.860]  No
[1:00:10.140 --> 1:00:15.980]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[1:00:15.980 --> 1:00:26.700]  Welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight and our next segment. We're going to be talking to james o' keith of project veritas
[1:00:27.500 --> 1:00:31.660]  Talking to us about this undercover investigation. They're conducting in terms of these people
[1:00:32.460 --> 1:00:40.460]  Who are in some of them? It's now come out. There's ads are being run it run in 20 different states across the country saying we'll pay you $2,500
[1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:43.500]  be a protester
[1:00:43.500 --> 1:00:48.220]  A grassroots protester no no no you're not a grassroots protester if they're paying you that kind of money
[1:00:48.780 --> 1:00:52.300]  Um $50 an hour. They're saying they're going to pay these people to do that
[1:00:52.380 --> 1:00:54.380]  But they did an undercover investigation
[1:00:54.780 --> 1:01:00.780]  They got video of people talking about how they wanted to infiltrate the deplorable one of the inauguration balls
[1:01:01.260 --> 1:01:06.140]  And release butyric acid. So we're going to talk to him about that about his upcoming part two
[1:01:07.100 --> 1:01:10.860]  Of that report, but I want to finish with what I was talking about in terms of the
[1:01:10.860 --> 1:01:16.220]  The pushback from the washington establishment, you know in this new york times article
[1:01:16.860 --> 1:01:22.860]  They talk about high powered lobbyists who are wearing their clients will turn up in a twitter feed civil servants who say they know
[1:01:23.340 --> 1:01:26.700]  That trump knows nothing about running a bureaucracy. So we have to defer to them
[1:01:26.860 --> 1:01:31.740]  You know, we're now this Byzantine empire where the bureaucrats run our country now. They do they do
[1:01:31.820 --> 1:01:35.660]  I mean look at what the epa in particular is doing, but of course there's been a massive
[1:01:35.660 --> 1:01:42.540]  Amount of regulations I reported on this yesterday. There's been I think it's 87 rules that were passed by congress in 2015
[1:01:42.540 --> 1:01:46.460]  But 3,400 rules see if they call it a rule
[1:01:47.340 --> 1:01:49.020]  They can do anything they want
[1:01:49.020 --> 1:01:52.940]  The prohibitions against excessive fines excessive punishment that doesn't apply
[1:01:53.180 --> 1:01:58.300]  So in the end we've seen that happen with the epa particularly coming after that remember that one farmer that had an eight acre
[1:01:58.940 --> 1:02:02.060]  uh plot in montana and he built a stock pond
[1:02:02.620 --> 1:02:04.620]  for his animals and for the kids to play in
[1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:10.540]  And the epa came after him with tens of thousands of dollars of fines per day and then tried to garnish his wages
[1:02:10.540 --> 1:02:15.740]  He was a welder so the prohibitions against unreasonable fines don't apply you got the fAA saying hey
[1:02:15.740 --> 1:02:19.580]  We're gonna put massive fines against you if you don't register your toy drone
[1:02:20.380 --> 1:02:25.100]  And these people do whatever they wish you don't have the presumption of innocence either because they say it's a civil regulation
[1:02:25.100 --> 1:02:27.100]  Not a criminal offense in most cases
[1:02:27.580 --> 1:02:32.060]  So that is something that's very dangerous. These people are saying hey, you know, we're really concerned about this and
[1:02:32.060 --> 1:02:37.180]  Even the new york times points out this region is one of the largest and wealthiest economies
[1:02:37.740 --> 1:02:41.660]  In the world and that's pointed out by the brookings institution. They know that very well
[1:02:42.300 --> 1:02:44.860]  These people like the elites at davos
[1:02:45.660 --> 1:02:49.340]  have been pigs feeding at the trough at our expense
[1:02:50.300 --> 1:02:52.060]  And that's why people are angry
[1:02:52.060 --> 1:02:56.060]  You know, you have this dichotomy that's going on here a lot of people. Oh, look at the stock market. Look how great it's going
[1:02:56.140 --> 1:02:57.420]  well, of course
[1:02:57.420 --> 1:03:02.780]  Most of this stock market that you see that you're going to see uh, barack obama take credit for in a few years
[1:03:02.780 --> 1:03:05.180]  He said look at the stock market when I left office
[1:03:05.340 --> 1:03:09.420]  The most of the stock market run up that you've seen this year has come
[1:03:10.140 --> 1:03:15.100]  Post election in terms of people anticipating that trump is going to cut taxes cut regulation
[1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:19.820]  Cut the chains that obama and the bureaucracy have forged upon us
[1:03:20.780 --> 1:03:23.980]  And so that's a response to what people are anticipating happening
[1:03:23.980 --> 1:03:27.740]  But these people look at it and they say wait a minute. You might actually cut federal workers
[1:03:27.740 --> 1:03:29.740]  You might actually cut our budget
[1:03:29.980 --> 1:03:33.580]  Just like davos is looking at this and in spite of the fact that they've accumulated
[1:03:34.220 --> 1:03:37.740]  gross amounts of wealth just in the last years we reported yesterday
[1:03:38.940 --> 1:03:44.060]  In the last year they had 62 people that had as much money as
[1:03:44.780 --> 1:03:50.460]  Half of the world and that changed just in the last year to only eight only eight and three of those eight
[1:03:50.460 --> 1:03:56.620]  Run major media organizations here in the united states the new york times washington post bloomberg
[1:03:57.420 --> 1:03:59.420]  three of those eight guys who have
[1:03:59.500 --> 1:04:02.060]  Uh wealth equivalent to half of the world's population
[1:04:02.140 --> 1:04:05.500]  So that's the kind of concentration that we're seeing and it truly is
[1:04:06.060 --> 1:04:10.300]  In this respect in terms of sovereignty when you talk about who gets to make the decisions
[1:04:11.260 --> 1:04:17.900]  About your life. That is a zero sum game. You can grow the economy and everybody we can we can cut regulation and taxes
[1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:21.820]  And everybody can get wealthier and we don't have to worry that somebody over here is making more money than us
[1:04:21.820 --> 1:04:25.420]  But when you see this kind of concentration of wealth that is coming
[1:04:26.060 --> 1:04:31.020]  From the kind of regulations that cut the rungs off of the ladders for people who want to start a small business
[1:04:31.660 --> 1:04:36.060]  And that's why small business is so optimistic at the same time and you can see this article
[1:04:36.140 --> 1:04:38.140]  We'll probably talk about this later in the broadcast
[1:04:38.460 --> 1:04:42.540]  Uh on dredge report as robots take jobs europeans mull free money for all
[1:04:42.540 --> 1:04:46.460]  It's what I talked about and have been talking about talked about that yesterday universal basic income
[1:04:46.460 --> 1:04:48.460]  They want to put you all on
[1:04:49.020 --> 1:04:50.220]  welfare
[1:04:50.220 --> 1:04:56.380]  It's a soft kill. It's a pacification. It's what they did to the indians on the reservation. That's agenda 21
[1:04:56.460 --> 1:05:01.340]  That's a that's the template for agenda 21. Stay with us. We'll be right back with jane's inauguration around the corner
[1:05:01.420 --> 1:05:05.180]  Here's what we know about the fascists who are trying to obstruct donald trump's inauguration
[1:05:05.260 --> 1:05:10.620]  Hundreds of thousands will be there to protest the inauguration of trump marching and chanting in the streets over fake news
[1:05:10.700 --> 1:05:15.820]  But it has gotten darker advertisements to pay trump protesters cropping up in dozens of us cities
[1:05:15.820 --> 1:05:21.260]  People like rosie mcdonald calling for martial law charles schumer threatening trump with the intelligence community
[1:05:21.340 --> 1:05:25.420]  michael moore marching in the women's march against trump pushing anti-trunk false narratives
[1:05:25.500 --> 1:05:32.540]  We know about the fake dossiers and now more is emerging as radical leftists are planning violent protests plans for planting and discharging
[1:05:32.620 --> 1:05:39.500]  acidic chemicals into ventilation systems disrupt j20 is mobilizing thousands and planning on blocking streets and transit in response
[1:05:39.500 --> 1:05:44.140]  There will be unprecedented security. We fully support the first amendment in the exercise thereof
[1:05:44.140 --> 1:05:47.740]  But people plotting illegal activities need to be brought into custody now
[1:05:47.820 --> 1:05:52.940]  Perhaps even arrested to deter these fascists from illegally disrupting the peaceful transition of power
[1:05:53.020 --> 1:05:58.780]  But something tells me that's not going to happen. This is oan shroyer and info wars will see you at the inauguration
[1:05:59.580 --> 1:06:02.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, alec jones here with the inauguration special

[1:08:28.940 --> 1:08:35.660]  Welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this tuesday january 17th 2017 joining us now is james o' keith
[1:08:36.140 --> 1:08:38.140]  With project veritas yesterday
[1:08:38.140 --> 1:08:43.820]  We showed part one of his investigation. They did an undercover investigation of people who are planning to
[1:08:44.540 --> 1:08:51.260]  Not only interrupt the deplorable not only to try to shut it down but also to engage in criminal
[1:08:51.660 --> 1:08:57.260]  Operations are we going to talk to him about that report also about the upcoming report part two of that investigation
[1:08:57.260 --> 1:09:01.020]  James o' keith, of course, as you know as president of project veritas
[1:09:01.420 --> 1:09:07.820]  Well known for his 2009 acorn investigation the systematic corruption that he discovered and showed in multiple offices that
[1:09:08.140 --> 1:09:14.540]  Ultimately forced that group to disband then he also did a very important investigation into npr
[1:09:15.180 --> 1:09:18.140]  They did a sting where they had two executives there
[1:09:18.700 --> 1:09:21.260]  Executive ron schiller senior director betsy lily
[1:09:21.260 --> 1:09:27.020]  They agreed to receive five million dollar donation from a fictional muslim organization
[1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:35.820]  And then the house representatives voted to defund them in september of 2011 project veritas led an investigation into medicaid offices in six states
[1:09:35.820 --> 1:09:37.820]  so he's had a massive influence
[1:09:38.620 --> 1:09:44.140]  In exposing the truth, of course, that's what project veritas means. I mean, that's what we always see the
[1:09:44.140 --> 1:09:51.820]  Whenever he exposes the truth, actually, we see the same thing happen that they always do when a whistleblower talks about criminal operations
[1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:58.380]  Shows corruption. They always attack the messenger. They come after the whistleblower. That's one thing that
[1:09:59.020 --> 1:10:03.420]  Brock Obama will be remembered for but joining us now is james o' keith. Thank you for joining us
[1:10:03.900 --> 1:10:08.300]  Hey, great to be with you. Tell us a little bit about uh, let's break down this
[1:10:08.300 --> 1:10:13.900]  Uh part one that we saw saw yesterday, of course. So what they were talking about doing was releasing
[1:10:14.460 --> 1:10:17.420]  Bacteric acid in the depour ball and that is the
[1:10:18.140 --> 1:10:23.580]  Thing that gives human vomit. It smells. It's very disgusting intolerable smell. It makes people sick
[1:10:23.580 --> 1:10:28.780]  They want to do that but in concentration it is an acid and so it'll burn your skin. It'll burn your lungs
[1:10:29.180 --> 1:10:31.180]  It's a very dangerous thing. That's a
[1:10:31.580 --> 1:10:32.860]  criminal
[1:10:32.860 --> 1:10:34.620]  Conspiracy, isn't it james?
[1:10:34.620 --> 1:10:38.780]  Yeah, it's actually covered under the dc anti terrorism statutes
[1:10:39.340 --> 1:10:44.380]  Uh, and and it's it's not just a prank this acid could it's a flammable material
[1:10:44.460 --> 1:10:46.060]  It could it could burn your lungs
[1:10:46.060 --> 1:10:50.060]  It could cause a stampede out of the national press club people trampling one another
[1:10:50.540 --> 1:10:54.620]  It's it's considered terrorism and we took the footage of the fbi
[1:10:55.180 --> 1:10:58.460]  They had the video they had these people's names and numbers
[1:10:58.540 --> 1:11:01.180]  They had their last names when we took this footage to them
[1:11:01.180 --> 1:11:04.460]  They thanked us and said they were going to be launching investigation
[1:11:04.940 --> 1:11:08.300]  And they also said they wanted to set off the sprinkler systems and get people wet
[1:11:08.700 --> 1:11:10.460]  It's going to be cold outside
[1:11:10.460 --> 1:11:14.060]  They want to do as much harm physically to people as possible
[1:11:14.620 --> 1:11:17.340]  And then of course they responded by saying well, we were just
[1:11:18.140 --> 1:11:20.140]  We were just punking me
[1:11:20.220 --> 1:11:22.940]  Well, if that's the case then why did they continue to
[1:11:23.580 --> 1:11:29.100]  Send these plans and emails follow up with more emails talking about how they're going to do this
[1:11:29.100 --> 1:11:34.380]  They did recon of the building they cased the building to ensure they could actually can carry out these plans
[1:11:34.940 --> 1:11:40.540]  And uh, it's just a laughable kind of cover your ass excuse trying to say that this was all a joke
[1:11:41.020 --> 1:11:45.340]  And when in fact the fbi has their name and number and of course we see this all the time
[1:11:45.420 --> 1:11:49.020]  You know people have a right to exercise their free speech
[1:11:49.100 --> 1:11:53.580]  And I think that the protests in terms of standing there with a sign talking about something
[1:11:53.580 --> 1:11:55.660]  I think we're actually too restrictive on that in the u.s
[1:11:55.660 --> 1:12:00.620]  Because when you look at these political conventions, what they do is they have protesters at both the political conventions
[1:12:00.620 --> 1:12:05.660]  They put them far away from where the political convention is and most cases the last several elections
[1:12:05.900 --> 1:12:08.940]  They put them in cages. You have to have a permit ahead of time
[1:12:08.940 --> 1:12:11.740]  But what we're not talking we're not talking about that kind of free speech here
[1:12:12.060 --> 1:12:18.620]  We're talking about people who are being paid to agitate and we have seen this in the run up to the election
[1:12:19.260 --> 1:12:24.060]  That they get violent with people that they instigate violence and then of course that violence is blamed on donald trump
[1:12:24.060 --> 1:12:29.100]  Or on trump supporters and not on the people who go there as paid agitators. Washington times has a story today
[1:12:29.100 --> 1:12:32.940]  That's on the dredge report talking about how they're going to pay people up to $2,500
[1:12:33.020 --> 1:12:37.900]  They say hey, we'll pay $50 an hour. We want you to do six events a year so forth and so on. I mean this is
[1:12:38.460 --> 1:12:43.340]  Uh, and we know we've seen uh, george sorris involved in it, but when you're talking about stampeding
[1:12:43.420 --> 1:12:48.780]  It's very important what you said. They're trying to stampede people out of a venue like that
[1:12:49.260 --> 1:12:51.740]  That is a very dangerous situation. We've all known of
[1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:57.260]  Uh situations just look at uh black friday at walmart people to get trampled and injured at
[1:12:57.820 --> 1:13:03.180]  Walmart, but this is trying to create a situation like that trying to create something where people get trampled at uh
[1:13:03.340 --> 1:13:06.700]  At a massive crowd like a concert or something like that
[1:13:06.700 --> 1:13:12.460]  That's going to be a large number of people and they're trying to do something that is very dangerous to people
[1:13:12.460 --> 1:13:13.900]  It ought to be a crime
[1:13:13.900 --> 1:13:19.340]  Yeah, it is a crime. It's considered under the anti-terrorism statute. You had the statute up in front of you there, but um
[1:13:19.340 --> 1:13:24.700]  Uh, it it's it's punishable by a five-year prison sentence and significant fine
[1:13:24.780 --> 1:13:28.460]  We have another video coming out here momentarily that will show
[1:13:29.180 --> 1:13:34.460]  Not just the uteric acid aspects, but they're also going to try to shut down the the railroads
[1:13:35.020 --> 1:13:40.540]  We're going to try to disrupt public transportation and these groups. This is not just an isolated group
[1:13:40.540 --> 1:13:48.780]  This this anti-fascist league works with a bunch of different other groups the um, uh league of conservation voters in california
[1:13:48.780 --> 1:13:55.420]  Workers of the world party and by the way, it's kind of ironic that the anti-fascists are planning on gassing people
[1:13:56.140 --> 1:13:59.660]  I mean, I hate to make a joke, but in the HVAC system
[1:14:00.140 --> 1:14:04.300]  It's just bizarre and as you see there on the screen this guy named scott green
[1:14:04.700 --> 1:14:07.580]  Had these planning meetings in inside of a house
[1:14:08.060 --> 1:14:12.220]  Where he's talking about the people that were intimately involved in the top secret plan
[1:14:12.220 --> 1:14:17.100]  He's referring to our journalists the media right now is trying to make this whole thing out to be like
[1:14:17.100 --> 1:14:21.500]  It's it's just a joke. They were playing me. I was inciting them
[1:14:22.060 --> 1:14:23.820]  I didn't say a word
[1:14:23.820 --> 1:14:25.660]  Not a word about any of this stuff
[1:14:25.660 --> 1:14:30.140]  We were there to listen and one of our people did get compromised and then and did get found out
[1:14:30.140 --> 1:14:34.860]  But we had more people who were on the inside and they were telling us all these plans and we just listened
[1:14:35.420 --> 1:14:40.220]  And then they sent a follow-up email on january 21st and said the quote the recon went pretty well
[1:14:40.540 --> 1:14:44.860]  We left with confidence that we can accomplish our objective with no negative consequences for our side
[1:14:44.860 --> 1:14:49.500]  C seeing our journalists so their excuse that they were playing along
[1:14:49.820 --> 1:14:56.780]  Turns out to be a total broad there. You have it right there scott green c seeing our journalist on that god your producers are great
[1:14:56.780 --> 1:14:58.780]  By the way, that was fast. Yeah
[1:14:59.580 --> 1:15:03.100]  C seeing our journalist tyler. We use the name tyler
[1:15:03.580 --> 1:15:11.260]  And it's in one of the email addresses. So they they there it is tyler marshal 1992 was our journalist playing that role
[1:15:11.260 --> 1:15:15.340]  And and why would he be sending emails to the entire group?
[1:15:15.980 --> 1:15:22.300]  Uh, if they were really counter stinging us, they would have immediately told people that they caught us or put the video out
[1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:29.100]  Like they did in another occasion. So I'm really disgusted by again the mainstream media trying to
[1:15:29.660 --> 1:15:33.340]  To to bury this but the good news is we have another video coming out here
[1:15:33.340 --> 1:15:40.940]  momentarily that shows their plans to to and hopefully people get arrested because you wouldn't want this to actually happen on thursday
[1:15:41.260 --> 1:15:45.340]  Absolutely, and and you're not the we also had another recording
[1:15:45.980 --> 1:15:49.260]  Then it was not as detailed as you're undercover investigation
[1:15:49.260 --> 1:15:52.700]  But it was somebody at a meeting where they're talking about similar types of things
[1:15:52.700 --> 1:15:56.700]  So we see that we see these ads going other places and yet when you expose it
[1:15:56.700 --> 1:16:03.900]  Uh, we're just joking or you're the problem as I said before they always come after the whistleblower and make you the issue
[1:16:03.980 --> 1:16:08.300]  Just as they did with hillary clinton's emails. It wasn't a problem what we learned about hillary clinton
[1:16:08.300 --> 1:16:11.900]  It wasn't a problem what we learned about the d&c. It was who who exposed that
[1:16:12.860 --> 1:16:14.940]  That's what they do every time this stuff comes out
[1:16:15.500 --> 1:16:20.620]  Yeah, that's what alex and I talk about all the time. It's the pick the target freeze it personalize it polarize it
[1:16:20.940 --> 1:16:26.060]  I just got a question asked by snopes.com. I mean ridiculous
[1:16:26.060 --> 1:16:29.980]  I mean this this is by the way, you want to talk about fake news? Yeah, snopes doc
[1:16:29.980 --> 1:16:34.380]  I think isn't facebook subcontracting with them or partnering with them or something like that
[1:16:34.780 --> 1:16:36.780]  bethany palma. This was a few minutes ago
[1:16:37.500 --> 1:16:42.300]  They she didn't even ask me about this video. She said back in december
[1:16:42.780 --> 1:16:48.060]  You were exposed by trying to meet with someone. I said bethany. Why aren't you asking about this video?
[1:16:48.060 --> 1:16:56.140]  And back in october bethany said quote virtually impossible a fact check without complete clips and quote out of context remarks
[1:16:57.100 --> 1:16:58.060]  I mean
[1:16:58.060 --> 1:17:01.420]  What what what's out of context for you to report that something's out of context?
[1:17:01.420 --> 1:17:05.020]  You have to provide your audience the evidence that it's out of context
[1:17:05.900 --> 1:17:11.660]  It's it's really i mean i can't tell you how disgusting and corrupt these people snopes.com
[1:17:11.660 --> 1:17:18.540]  Oh, yeah, and the fact that and the fact that facebook is using them as a as a substantial source to corroborate information
[1:17:18.860 --> 1:17:23.740]  It's outrageous. But again, the good news is we're going to keep dripping out information
[1:17:24.220 --> 1:17:27.580]  And and they can do all the damage control. We release more videotape
[1:17:28.140 --> 1:17:31.020]  Exposing that they're doing damage control. This is how you have to fight these people
[1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:33.980]  well, you know, it's it's disgusting that we have
[1:17:35.180 --> 1:17:40.380]  These these media gardens the guardians these people are going to be final arbiters of the truth being appointed
[1:17:40.380 --> 1:17:44.860]  And the thing that concerns me even more about that is they've funded now the state department of all places
[1:17:45.420 --> 1:17:49.660]  To be arbiters of what's true and to push back against things we've talked about facebook
[1:17:50.140 --> 1:17:56.620]  And snopes, of course, uh, i'm sure you're aware of the uh, the nasty divorce that happened with a couple that runs
[1:17:56.940 --> 1:17:59.820]  Snopes and literally as as jaryl slenty always called them
[1:18:00.220 --> 1:18:07.420]  Prestitute media. We found that uh, we they've got as as key members of their organization one who's still actively working
[1:18:07.420 --> 1:18:11.260]  As a as an escort as a prostitute another who's working as a
[1:18:11.740 --> 1:18:15.100]  Dominatrix and so they quite literally are the prostitute media
[1:18:15.260 --> 1:18:20.620]  They will go to the highest bidder in this particular case. I'm sure they're getting paid pretty well by facebook
[1:18:20.620 --> 1:18:22.140]  He's got a lot of money
[1:18:22.140 --> 1:18:27.020]  I I can't believe how i'm out. I can't believe how fast your producers are when you talk getting that stuff
[1:18:27.260 --> 1:18:31.820]  That's incredible. Yes. This is there you have it and and and not to scoop myself
[1:18:31.820 --> 1:18:38.300]  But we have people this year the number one target of ours is going to be the media that is the target
[1:18:38.380 --> 1:18:40.780]  They are the ones to elect our politic
[1:18:40.940 --> 1:18:45.180]  They were actually very ineffective this this past year at electing our politicians
[1:18:45.260 --> 1:18:47.340]  But they are the number one target they
[1:18:47.980 --> 1:18:51.740]  If it wasn't for they are they do not want to report
[1:18:52.220 --> 1:18:56.460]  On the fact that people are going to cause havoc and violence on thursday and friday
[1:18:56.700 --> 1:19:00.380]  And if this stuff actually happens the media is now complicit. This is criminal
[1:19:00.380 --> 1:19:03.740]  Yeah, what the media is doing. It's criminal for them to
[1:19:04.620 --> 1:19:05.500]  try to
[1:19:05.500 --> 1:19:08.780]  Turn it around on the person who's exposing the violence
[1:19:09.180 --> 1:19:12.220]  They say do your job snopes call the fbi right now
[1:19:12.620 --> 1:19:17.340]  You can i'll even give you the names of the people that my lawyer met with and get a comment from them
[1:19:17.420 --> 1:19:23.020]  Are these people are being arrested? They're talking about gassing people. Yeah at the press club
[1:19:23.260 --> 1:19:28.860]  So anyways, well, that's why it's so important what you're doing because their narrative is to pretend that there's going to be some
[1:19:28.860 --> 1:19:36.380]  Kind of spontaneous conflict and this who's who started it did that side started did the other side started if you show that they've been
[1:19:36.940 --> 1:19:44.300]  Premeditating this type of activity then that kind of destroys their whole narrative that oh, it was the trump supporters who started this
[1:19:44.620 --> 1:19:50.140]  When we were just there innocently standing by we're going to be right back with james o' keith project veritas

[1:24:16.460 --> 1:24:18.780]  Of course, their website is project veritas
[1:24:18.780 --> 1:24:23.420]  dot com part two of the undercover investigation of people
[1:24:23.980 --> 1:24:31.260]  Who are plotting to disrupt the trump inauguration is uploading now, isn't it james on your side? It's not quite ready
[1:24:31.420 --> 1:24:37.660]  I'm looking through my production room. It's it's uh exporting and uploading to youtube and twitter and facebook here and
[1:24:37.980 --> 1:24:39.980]  Okay, it basically involves
[1:24:40.860 --> 1:24:46.540]  It's gonna be out momentarily involves a plot to shut down the trains in dc to
[1:24:46.540 --> 1:24:49.980]  Actually commit conventional terrorism to
[1:24:51.020 --> 1:24:53.020]  Chain the trains
[1:24:53.260 --> 1:25:02.300]  Down and punch people in the throat. It's very violent. It's very graphic and uh and some specific plans on how to shut down transportation systems
[1:25:02.620 --> 1:25:06.540]  I don't know if these guys are going to get arrested, but I hope journalists do their jobs and
[1:25:07.100 --> 1:25:10.380]  And put pressure on law enforcement agencies for a comment here
[1:25:10.860 --> 1:25:15.980]  Um, I've done everything I can this is the second installment that we'll be releasing and it really gets into the weeds
[1:25:15.980 --> 1:25:22.140]  It shows all their planning meetings. It shows phone calls. It shows emails about what they did what they intend to do
[1:25:22.620 --> 1:25:24.620]  and you know when we saw these
[1:25:24.780 --> 1:25:27.500]  So-called demonstrations against the trump rallies
[1:25:27.500 --> 1:25:31.420]  We had situations where ambulances were blocked because of situations that these people
[1:25:32.060 --> 1:25:34.220]  Created that is something that affects
[1:25:35.100 --> 1:25:41.180]  You know people who are in emergency services as well as the attacks on the vehicles that they blocked
[1:25:41.180 --> 1:25:47.500]  Um putting paint on them keying them attacking people just because they thought they were trump supporters
[1:25:48.060 --> 1:25:51.980]  That is the type of thing that these people do and as we said in the last segment
[1:25:52.140 --> 1:25:56.060]  They always portray this as well, you know, hey, we were just there as protesters
[1:25:56.700 --> 1:26:02.300]  exercising our first amendment speech and then that other guy started it and uh, you know who we you know
[1:26:02.300 --> 1:26:04.700]  We don't know who threw the first punch or whatever, but now
[1:26:05.260 --> 1:26:06.780]  You see these people ahead of time
[1:26:06.780 --> 1:26:13.820]  That's why it's very important you're under cover investigation because it shows that this was their premeditated intent to create this type of situation
[1:26:14.140 --> 1:26:19.020]  Not that it was something to just spontaneously happened as they were exercising their first amendment rights
[1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:23.100]  Not at all. No, I I I support strongly the right of people to
[1:26:23.500 --> 1:26:25.500]  peaceably demonstrate and
[1:26:25.660 --> 1:26:29.340]  Voice their opinions and and voice their first amendment rights that this is not
[1:26:29.900 --> 1:26:31.900]  peaceful this is all
[1:26:32.060 --> 1:26:34.060]  illegal criminal activity
[1:26:34.060 --> 1:26:36.940]  And they're covering and they're lying about it
[1:26:37.020 --> 1:26:42.780]  They're impeaching their credibility when they put out this this garbage press release saying that they were playing me
[1:26:43.260 --> 1:26:46.300]  I mean that is the worst cover your ass excuse
[1:26:46.380 --> 1:26:49.180]  I've ever seen if you're going to counter sting
[1:26:49.260 --> 1:26:52.380]  I'm I'm in the business of stinging people investigating going undercover
[1:26:52.700 --> 1:26:56.540]  If you're going to counter stink someone and you're going to do a conspiracy to do it
[1:26:56.940 --> 1:26:58.700]  It would be on one email
[1:26:58.700 --> 1:27:06.060]  It would we have all their emails and they continue to CC our undercover reporters even up to the moment
[1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:13.660]  This video was released a month later. They were cc'ing our undercover reporters about all their specific plans
[1:27:14.220 --> 1:27:21.020]  So this notion that they're that they're that they're they're counter stinging me or that or that I'm inciting the violence
[1:27:21.340 --> 1:27:26.140]  Is rubbish and it's and it's uh, I mean it's it's laughable the media is falling for it
[1:27:26.140 --> 1:27:31.980]  But what do we expect? That's why I got to fight them back by dripping out videos until they're shamed into covering it
[1:27:32.780 --> 1:27:35.740]  I think things are going to change with the new attorney general
[1:27:35.820 --> 1:27:40.700]  I think uh senator sessions when he becomes attorney general is going to have a very different
[1:27:41.820 --> 1:27:46.140]  Approach to this than we've seen from eric holder and from lara lynch who basically have uh,
[1:27:46.380 --> 1:27:52.700]  Looked the other way as we see these acts happen. I mean they look the other way when we had uh video that exposed
[1:27:52.700 --> 1:27:58.780]  Uh, the new black panthers intimidating people at voting booths. They don't you know, they're uh,
[1:27:59.980 --> 1:28:03.740]  Their investigation into crimes is uh, unbelievably political
[1:28:04.060 --> 1:28:07.420]  But I think that they're going to take this very seriously in the next administration
[1:28:07.500 --> 1:28:12.140]  Which will only be a short time after these events that they're planning
[1:28:12.220 --> 1:28:16.300]  So I think it's going to be a very dangerous thing for them to continue to go ahead with these events
[1:28:16.380 --> 1:28:20.380]  Hopefully you exposing this uh will stop these things from happening
[1:28:20.380 --> 1:28:27.100]  But still for them to plan it is a crime to conspire to commit a crime is a crime in and of itself
[1:28:27.180 --> 1:28:33.420]  It's very important. It's very important and and I don't think they're going to stop doing it. I think they are
[1:28:34.060 --> 1:28:37.260]  um immune from uh, uh
[1:28:38.060 --> 1:28:44.220]  Accountability and there's a hubris because they've been getting away with it for years. I mean I I've I've spent years
[1:28:45.180 --> 1:28:49.340]  Under the thumb of my government my I have been mistreated by my government
[1:28:49.340 --> 1:28:54.700]  I have been subpoenaed. I have been issued criminal grand jury subpoenas. I've been investigated
[1:28:54.780 --> 1:29:01.500]  I've been sent to prison for bringing a camera into a federal building with my real driver's license
[1:29:01.580 --> 1:29:06.860]  Okay, I've been I've journalism has been made criminal in this country and I think things will change
[1:29:07.340 --> 1:29:15.020]  But I'll always be a gorilla because I still have to fight these forces these mainstream media forces that seek to deprive people of information
[1:29:15.020 --> 1:29:19.580]  I still have to fight in uphill battle and and as long as I have to do that
[1:29:19.900 --> 1:29:25.740]  We have to play these games, which I shouldn't have to play where when they issue a response
[1:29:25.820 --> 1:29:29.820]  I have to issue a little bit of information trickling it out showing they lied about that
[1:29:30.220 --> 1:29:33.260]  This is what we have to do and we're going to continue to do it. Look at the video
[1:29:33.260 --> 1:29:36.540]  It's out in a few minutes on project veritas. I know you I know you've got to go soon
[1:29:36.620 --> 1:29:40.060]  Is there do you have uh, can you say with us a little bit into the next segment?
[1:29:40.140 --> 1:29:43.100]  I gotta run because I got my gotta get this video. All right
[1:29:43.100 --> 1:29:47.820]  I understand so you can look at that video. You can find that at project veritas.com. Thank you so much for joining us
[1:29:47.900 --> 1:29:52.140]  James O'Keefe. We'll be right back. We're on the march the empires on the run
[1:29:53.020 --> 1:29:55.900]  Alex Jones and the gcn radio network
[1:29:59.740 --> 1:30:03.980]  With the inauguration around the corner, here's what we know about the fascists who are trying to obstruct
[1:30:03.980 --> 1:30:10.700]  Donald Trump's inauguration hundreds of thousands will be there to protest the inauguration of trump marching and chanting in the streets over fake news
[1:30:10.700 --> 1:30:15.900]  But it has gotten darker advertisements to pay trump protesters cropping up in dozens of us cities
[1:30:15.980 --> 1:30:21.260]  People like rosy mcdonald calling for martial law charles schumer threatening trump with the intelligence community
[1:30:21.340 --> 1:30:25.500]  Michael more marching in the women's march against trump pushing anti trump false narratives
[1:30:25.580 --> 1:30:32.620]  We know about the fake dossiers and now more is emerging as radical leftists are planning violent protests plans for planting and discharging

[1:32:58.460 --> 1:33:14.940]  I think that there's no question that the process
[1:33:14.940 --> 1:33:29.180]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones
[1:33:33.980 --> 1:33:39.980]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the american flag
[1:33:39.980 --> 1:33:47.980]  Info wars help to fuel the rumor that president obama is an isis supporter. It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning

[1:33:51.660 --> 1:33:54.220]  Impressed I hope and I think we'll be speaking a lot
[1:33:54.380 --> 1:34:01.980]  Donald Trump and alex jones. This means that dama trump will be the 45th president of the united states
[1:34:02.140 --> 1:34:05.740]  Waging war on corruption. It's alex jones
[1:34:05.740 --> 1:34:12.620]  Welcome back to the alex jones show. I'm david knight and just a reminder that alex jones is going to be here in the studio in one hour
[1:34:12.940 --> 1:34:20.060]  With a huge announcement as he said concerning attacks of a lethal nature surrounding the trump inauguration
[1:34:20.700 --> 1:34:23.580]  I want to take a look at the toxic
[1:34:24.300 --> 1:34:27.740]  rhetoric that is coming out. We were just talking to james o' keith and he was talking about the
[1:34:27.740 --> 1:34:34.780]  Undercover investigation that showed that they have people in washington as we've talked about people like bill ares and others
[1:34:35.900 --> 1:34:38.620]  The communist party leaders who are pushing to
[1:34:39.500 --> 1:34:45.580]  Agitate to disrupt paid protesters that are being solicited in 20 different cities to go to washington
[1:34:45.580 --> 1:34:47.020]  They want to block traffic
[1:34:47.020 --> 1:34:51.980]  They want to stop chains as he's pointing out this second video in their undercover investigation
[1:34:52.540 --> 1:34:54.540]  shows that they're going to be trying to
[1:34:55.180 --> 1:34:56.540]  chain
[1:34:56.540 --> 1:35:02.140]  Trains so that they can't move. I guess maybe that's kind of a picture of what obama has been doing to the economy
[1:35:02.700 --> 1:35:07.340]  This last minute regulations, especially trying to chain us so that we can't move
[1:35:07.420 --> 1:35:10.380]  We can't do anything but it's quite dangerous and what they're talking about doing
[1:35:10.860 --> 1:35:14.940]  At the deplorable in that first part of the report that we saw yesterday
[1:35:15.580 --> 1:35:18.220]  They were talking about how they wanted to panic people. They wanted to
[1:35:19.420 --> 1:35:24.540]  Create a panic at the deplorable with this butyric acid in the ventilation system
[1:35:24.540 --> 1:35:27.900]  I'm trying to get a stampede of people out of that building, you know
[1:35:27.900 --> 1:35:31.900]  I talked to two days ago about how in germany a court there
[1:35:32.540 --> 1:35:37.500]  Said that it wasn't really anti-Semitism. It wasn't a hate crime and you know, hey, it's a little bit of arson
[1:35:37.500 --> 1:35:41.500]  But you know, we'll protect that as free speech because you set this they had a bunch of
[1:35:42.300 --> 1:35:44.940]  Arabs who got drunk and set a synagogue on fire
[1:35:45.500 --> 1:35:49.100]  And they said that's okay. They were upset about israel's foreign policy
[1:35:49.100 --> 1:35:54.700]  So it's okay to try to burn down a synagogue and if anybody's in there, sorry about that, you know
[1:35:55.500 --> 1:35:57.500]  If it spreads to other places, sorry
[1:35:58.060 --> 1:36:00.940]  If it injures german firefighters try to put that that's okay
[1:36:00.940 --> 1:36:06.940]  They were just expressing their opinion about israel and as one member of parliament there said these people these german jews
[1:36:07.020 --> 1:36:10.700]  Who are going to the synagogue? They don't have anything to do with israeli foreign policy
[1:36:11.420 --> 1:36:15.980]  Now they do the firemen who would get injured putting out that arson. So yes, it was hate speech
[1:36:15.980 --> 1:36:18.780]  It was anti-Semitism and it was arson
[1:36:19.580 --> 1:36:23.580]  But of course I said that was fine and yet at the same time that is happening got uncle and merkel
[1:36:24.140 --> 1:36:26.860]  Saying we're going to go after people on social media
[1:36:27.260 --> 1:36:30.220]  We don't want any of that hateful stuff that you people are saying on social media
[1:36:30.300 --> 1:36:32.300]  We are going to be the arbiters of
[1:36:32.300 --> 1:36:36.540]  Whatever you're saying whether it's true whether it's hateful and we're going to decide that we're going to come after you
[1:36:36.540 --> 1:36:40.620]  Because we cannot allow that to happen. See what they're concerned about
[1:36:41.660 --> 1:36:43.660]  Is not physical violence
[1:36:43.660 --> 1:36:49.420]  Uncle merkel is going to continue to bring in people. She's doubled down on her proposals even as trump has said
[1:36:49.740 --> 1:36:52.860]  This is an awful thing that she did said that over the weekend
[1:36:53.900 --> 1:36:59.820]  Criticized nato for being totally ineffective in terms of its response and its ability to combat terrorism
[1:37:00.620 --> 1:37:05.500]  But she's going to continue to do that and they're going to continue to shut down people who are dangerous to them
[1:37:05.580 --> 1:37:11.420]  Not the terrorists that they do want to have come into the countries to create disorder so they can increase the size of government
[1:37:11.420 --> 1:37:15.660]  No, the thing that is dangerous to them is anybody that opposes their
[1:37:16.300 --> 1:37:22.060]  Politics that opposes their political party. That's the danger that they're concerned about you want to set buildings on fire
[1:37:22.060 --> 1:37:23.260]  We don't care
[1:37:23.260 --> 1:37:29.260]  You want to shoot people on the streets run them down with big semi trailers? We don't care you want to criticize the government?
[1:37:29.260 --> 1:37:34.140]  Ah, we care we care a lot about that and we're going to come down with a hammer on you about that
[1:37:34.220 --> 1:37:36.940]  Now we're going to talk about this whole russian narrative
[1:37:36.940 --> 1:37:42.380]  Uh, we got a couple of interesting video clips with this as well. You know start with Al Sharpton here in just a moment
[1:37:42.380 --> 1:37:44.380]  But before we do I want to remind you

[1:38:55.740 --> 1:39:00.220]  I want to play Al Sharpton in his comments again pushing this idea
[1:39:00.220 --> 1:39:02.220]  Yeah, like we saw with John Lewis
[1:39:02.860 --> 1:39:06.700]  We've got all these black leaders coming out now because it's Martin Luther King day yesterday
[1:39:07.180 --> 1:39:11.820]  And so you have all these black leaders saying uh, Donald Trump is not legitimate
[1:39:12.380 --> 1:39:15.820]  And we are not going to go to the inaugurations like fine. Don't go
[1:39:16.620 --> 1:39:18.300]  but uh
[1:39:18.300 --> 1:39:22.940]  Not legitimate. Here's Al Sharpton to tell us what's legitimate and what's not legitimate
[1:39:22.940 --> 1:39:29.980]  I think that there's no question that the process that elected him was not legitimate when you look at the
[1:39:30.540 --> 1:39:36.780]  Now evidence from the intelligence agencies that there was the influence from the
[1:39:37.340 --> 1:39:42.220]  Russians clearly the process has a serious questions about it
[1:39:43.020 --> 1:39:48.220]  All that influence from the Russians now, you know, and of course that's Al Sharpton an unimpeachable source of integrity
[1:39:48.220 --> 1:39:53.180]  Uh, the guy who's behind the toalla to wanna brawley fraud. Okay made a lot of money with that
[1:39:53.180 --> 1:39:57.500]  Uh, he's lost a lot of weight. He hasn't gained any credibility. Okay, and then we got John Lewis
[1:39:57.980 --> 1:40:01.580]  A guy who did some important things in the civil rights movement
[1:40:01.580 --> 1:40:06.940]  And then of course remember that when John Lewis calls Donald Trump illegitimate
[1:40:07.580 --> 1:40:11.900]  He also said John McCain and Sarah Palin were another George Wallace
[1:40:11.900 --> 1:40:16.380]  He said the same thing about Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. They're another George Wallace
[1:40:16.380 --> 1:40:23.740]  They're another George Wallace. These are racist people. Okay, so he's you kind of get the idea that he's now become a partisan hack
[1:40:24.300 --> 1:40:29.340]  As a member of congress, you know, what happened in civil rights is 50 55 years ago when he was involved
[1:40:29.500 --> 1:40:31.260]  What has he been doing for the last 30 years?
[1:40:31.260 --> 1:40:35.740]  He has been a political hack and not even just against democrats but against republicans
[1:40:35.740 --> 1:40:40.380]  But against some of his own fellow democrats there he is with Hillary Clinton because remember
[1:40:41.020 --> 1:40:43.020]  that in the primary
[1:40:43.020 --> 1:40:48.220]  It was John Lewis who said Bernie Sanders. I he never did anything in the civil rights movement
[1:40:48.860 --> 1:40:52.700]  Bernie Sanders then put out pictures showing him involved in the civil rights movement
[1:40:52.700 --> 1:40:56.060]  But do you see any criticisms as I pointed out last night the nightly nightly news?
[1:40:56.540 --> 1:41:03.020]  Did you ever see any criticisms of John Lewis of people like Morris D's who was involved in the civil rights movement on the side of
[1:41:03.020 --> 1:41:05.340]  the Ku Klux Klan defending them then became the
[1:41:06.540 --> 1:41:09.660]  CEO and the founder of the southern poverty law center
[1:41:09.660 --> 1:41:13.740]  To make a lot of money to profit off of it. The only thing he did in the civil rights movement
[1:41:13.900 --> 1:41:18.380]  The guy with the southern poverty law center the splc the people that are the go-to
[1:41:18.700 --> 1:41:25.340]  Bible for the fbi from federal agencies for the mainstream media and fingering people and saying these people are racist
[1:41:25.420 --> 1:41:27.420]  These people are hate hate mongers. Okay
[1:41:28.300 --> 1:41:33.980]  Those people all they did during the civil rights movement was defend the Ku Klux Klan and then set the rest of it out
[1:41:33.980 --> 1:41:35.980]  While he was out making a fistful money
[1:41:35.980 --> 1:41:39.420]  With a direct mail campaign and then he started using
[1:41:40.460 --> 1:41:46.860]  Southern poverty law center as a direct mail funny fundraiser funny. Yeah funny money
[1:41:47.660 --> 1:41:53.020]  That's where these guys have hung out. Did you ever see John Lewis complain about him or complain about?
[1:41:54.460 --> 1:42:01.180]  These other people that were in the democrat party and just switched sides like Robert Byrd who was a
[1:42:02.380 --> 1:42:04.380]  high up in the kkk and then he becomes
[1:42:04.380 --> 1:42:07.580]  A high leader in the senate. They don't have any problem with him
[1:42:08.060 --> 1:42:13.660]  Don't hillary don't have a problem with them. So Bernie Sanders understands that these guys people like john lewis
[1:42:14.140 --> 1:42:16.140]  hacked the democrat
[1:42:16.140 --> 1:42:18.140]  primary against him
[1:42:18.300 --> 1:42:24.860]  And we've got the emails showing that hillary was conspiring with the dnc with the mainstream media against bernie sanders at the same time
[1:42:24.860 --> 1:42:30.780]  You got this political hack john lewis saying bernie sanders. I never saw him in the civil rights movement
[1:42:30.780 --> 1:42:37.100]  But let's take a look at what's going on with this russian narrative that these guys are also pushing at the same time
[1:42:38.140 --> 1:42:41.740]  There is a bbc documentary that is coming out
[1:42:42.380 --> 1:42:46.620]  And it's being put out by a program on the bbc called panorama
[1:42:47.340 --> 1:42:52.300]  And before I play that for you. I just want to there's also a report from the guardian
[1:42:52.780 --> 1:43:00.220]  Where vladimir putin has commented for the first time making his first public remarks on these claims about the dirty dossier and these other things
[1:43:00.220 --> 1:43:05.740]  He said those behind trump's dossier are quote worse than prostitutes
[1:43:06.460 --> 1:43:09.900]  And this is what putin's head about donald trump in his public remarks
[1:43:10.460 --> 1:43:16.780]  He said that the idea that trump was essentially a russian intelligence asset was nonsense. He said quote. I've never met him
[1:43:17.340 --> 1:43:19.260]  I don't know what he'll do on the world stage
[1:43:19.260 --> 1:43:22.060]  So I have no reason either to criticize him or to defend him
[1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:25.660]  But he goes this is an adult man and a man who for years
[1:43:25.660 --> 1:43:33.260]  Organized beauty contests spoke with most beautiful women in the world. I can hardly believe that he ran off to meet with our girls of low social morals
[1:43:33.500 --> 1:43:35.980]  Although of course ours are the best in the world
[1:43:37.180 --> 1:43:39.820]  That's like oh, yeah, he wouldn't he wouldn't do anything about it
[1:43:39.820 --> 1:43:42.380]  But of course we have the best-looking prostitutes in the world according to putin
[1:43:42.540 --> 1:43:45.180]  Then he goes on to say the people who order these fakes
[1:43:45.580 --> 1:43:52.140]  Which are being spread against the president-elect of america and use them in a political battle are worse than prostitutes
[1:43:52.220 --> 1:43:54.220]  They have no moral limits
[1:43:54.220 --> 1:44:00.380]  All right, so with that in mind, let's take a look at how the bbc is prostituting itself on this on this program panorama
[1:44:00.460 --> 1:44:02.460]  and remember it was the bbc
[1:44:02.940 --> 1:44:03.980]  that after
[1:44:03.980 --> 1:44:12.220]  Things came to light with jimmy saville remember the lifelong pedophile who was connected to the royal family who was connected to all the uk elites
[1:44:12.700 --> 1:44:14.700]  and as alex jones pointed out
[1:44:14.860 --> 1:44:18.780]  david ike would come on the program and start to talk about jimmy saville and you know
[1:44:18.780 --> 1:44:22.060]  You know don't want to get into a lawsuit here or things that we can't prove well
[1:44:22.060 --> 1:44:28.540]  It was proven after he died the bbc even did a documentary on it at the middle level and of course the bbc higher ups
[1:44:29.340 --> 1:44:33.900]  Despite that documentary there were multiple investigations that have been started during
[1:44:34.460 --> 1:44:39.020]  jimmy saville's lifetime by scotland yard the people lower down but again compartmentalization, right?
[1:44:39.020 --> 1:44:41.820]  They didn't know that he was a protected individual
[1:44:42.460 --> 1:44:46.780]  Until people hire up in scotland yard shut down the investigation
[1:44:47.500 --> 1:44:50.700]  so with that in mind i want to play for you a little bit of this video trailer
[1:44:50.700 --> 1:44:56.300]  And it's called uh donald trump they talk about donald trump and they put him out there as quote unquote
[1:44:56.700 --> 1:45:01.820]  The kremlin candidate that's actually the name of their so-called documentary
[1:45:05.500 --> 1:45:09.580]  Was donald trump helped into the white house by vladimir putin
[1:45:10.700 --> 1:45:16.060]  This is clearly the most serious blow to our democratic system since watergate
[1:45:16.060 --> 1:45:21.740]  A spy on the run honey traps cyber war the kremlin has formed russia
[1:45:22.060 --> 1:45:25.260]  They do this like bread and butter. It is part of their being
[1:45:25.820 --> 1:45:28.860]  trump denies everything and blames the cia
[1:45:30.060 --> 1:45:33.420]  That's something that nazi germany would have done and did too
[1:45:34.300 --> 1:45:39.340]  As he's about to take office. We asked what does the trump future romance mean for us?
[1:45:39.340 --> 1:45:45.820]  Oh disgusting not going to be business as usual and what happens if the two leaders fall out?
[1:45:51.820 --> 1:45:54.940]  And of course as you saw in that clip they showed picture Nigel Farage
[1:45:54.940 --> 1:45:59.660]  They're trying to tarnish Nigel Farage. They're going to imply that oh, he's part of this
[1:46:00.220 --> 1:46:03.820]  Russian honey trap or this russian conspiracy as well
[1:46:04.620 --> 1:46:06.620]  now there's an article from
[1:46:06.620 --> 1:46:10.460]  Uh, the express in the uk pushing back against this
[1:46:11.020 --> 1:46:17.980]  They said the bbc and fresh bias row as panorama brands donald trump the kremlin candidate
[1:46:17.980 --> 1:46:25.020]  They said the bbc is facing fresh accusations of bias after this documentary labeling donald trump as a kremlin candidate
[1:46:25.020 --> 1:46:27.020]  and of course that is to
[1:46:27.580 --> 1:46:32.940]  To refer to the manchurian candidate. We've had that narrative being sold to us by multiple mainstream medias
[1:46:32.940 --> 1:46:36.940]  Uh organizations this last week here in the united states
[1:46:37.500 --> 1:46:41.020]  Interesting isn't it how all these things come together at the same time?
[1:46:41.340 --> 1:46:46.620]  And i want to read you some of the quotes that people have responded to here and these are people in the uk
[1:46:46.780 --> 1:46:52.060]  This is a uk article. They say one furious viewer tweeted. I don't like trump
[1:46:52.300 --> 1:46:59.260]  But this fanatical anti russian propaganda is stupid hillary lost because a lot of people hate her another one said
[1:46:59.820 --> 1:47:01.820]  Panorama or propaganda
[1:47:01.820 --> 1:47:03.820]  Why do I have to pay for your bs?
[1:47:04.380 --> 1:47:10.140]  Because in the uk you are forced to pay for the bbc in a very open way here
[1:47:10.220 --> 1:47:13.180]  We subsidize npr in a little bit more indirect way
[1:47:14.060 --> 1:47:19.740]  So you don't see it directly and you don't see the subsidies that go to so many of the mainstream media outlets either
[1:47:19.740 --> 1:47:21.740]  They they bury those things there
[1:47:22.300 --> 1:47:29.340]  Another wrote the world is changing you've had your time bbc and the people are seeing through your liberal bias
[1:47:29.340 --> 1:47:35.020]  But you know, there actually may be something to this. We actually have a clip here
[1:47:36.060 --> 1:47:38.060]  Of a russian hacker
[1:47:38.060 --> 1:47:42.620]  Who's admitted that putin hacked trump? Here's that clip
[1:47:46.060 --> 1:47:52.300]  Here we are the russian hackers russian hackers a russian hack a russian hacking russian hacking russian hack
[1:47:52.460 --> 1:47:58.460]  We're going to tell you the whole proof because from now you the dfc i a nsa and fbi
[1:47:58.460 --> 1:48:01.500]  Won't be able to do anything about it. I won
[1:48:02.300 --> 1:48:05.900]  I mean I became president. I cry with a report total
[1:48:06.860 --> 1:48:10.220]  Disaster, but you failed to find the most important element
[1:48:10.460 --> 1:48:17.580]  We don't need to hack trumps twitter as cnn suggests. You are fake news. We had Donald Trump himself
[1:48:18.620 --> 1:48:25.260]  Do you remember him praising putin for more implementing counter sanctions that was putin praising himself with Trump's hands?
[1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:34.220]  Every american politician knows the more sanctions the better new sanctions additional sanctions increases in sanctions
[1:48:34.540 --> 1:48:42.220]  So now from his arms as soon as your president does something you don't like you'll shout russian hackers boy. Oh boy. Oh boy
[1:48:42.620 --> 1:48:46.300]  But you the guys in intelligence you still haven't discovered the main thing
[1:48:46.300 --> 1:48:54.380]  How did we manage to hack more than 60 million americans who simply chose to kick out the establishment?
[1:48:55.740 --> 1:48:59.180]  A little parody piece there from rt and the person you see behind the mask
[1:48:59.180 --> 1:49:01.180]  He takes off that mask and goes well
[1:49:01.180 --> 1:49:03.980]  How do we manage to convince all these people and of course?
[1:49:04.540 --> 1:49:08.460]  The rt was figured prominently at the center of this
[1:49:08.460 --> 1:49:17.020]  This fake intelligence report even going back and saying look at these programs going back to 2012 look they were involved in criticizing
[1:49:17.420 --> 1:49:19.420]  Barack Obama. Well, they didn't have a
[1:49:19.980 --> 1:49:25.980]  An effect then did they and they talked about programs that haven't been in existence for several years at
[1:49:26.460 --> 1:49:26.860]  rt
[1:49:26.860 --> 1:49:31.500]  This is the kind of narrative that we see continually being put out there and yet at the same time
[1:49:32.300 --> 1:49:37.100]  There is some russian hacking involved with the democrats that you haven't really heard about
[1:49:37.100 --> 1:49:40.220]  And this is something I've alluded to a couple of times that I want to
[1:49:41.020 --> 1:49:45.100]  Get down into it and tell you exactly what happened when we come back in the next segment
[1:49:45.100 --> 1:49:47.100]  I don't have enough time to talk about it this segment
[1:49:47.900 --> 1:49:51.500]  But this is a report that was put out by politico and only a few
[1:49:52.380 --> 1:49:56.540]  Conservative news outlets have picked up on this detailed report from politico now
[1:49:56.540 --> 1:50:05.420]  Of course, they talk about ukrainian efforts to sabotage donald trump to work with the democrat national committee to sabotage donald trump
[1:50:05.420 --> 1:50:11.100]  But they do it in a way and of course they kind of backpedal being politico and these are the people here
[1:50:11.100 --> 1:50:13.420]  Here's a recent headline from politico trump in the world
[1:50:14.060 --> 1:50:19.580]  Ready's for a leap into darkness. Okay, this is their perspective on the inauguration
[1:50:19.580 --> 1:50:24.140]  So, you know where politico is coming from even if you haven't been to their site and see the
[1:50:24.940 --> 1:50:28.220]  The the bias news of politico very biased site very leftist site
[1:50:28.700 --> 1:50:34.140]  But they reported on this and I think it's kind of interesting that it was coming from politico because it looks like they're trying to get out
[1:50:34.140 --> 1:50:36.460]  ahead of this and put a positive
[1:50:37.500 --> 1:50:39.500]  Spin on this before
[1:50:39.900 --> 1:50:46.060]  Other people focus on what's been discovered, but we're going to talk about that and we're going to take their spin off of it when we come back
[1:50:46.060 --> 1:50:48.060]  Stay with us

[1:54:31.420 --> 1:54:35.980]  This segment I want to finish up on what I was talking about with ukraine because I think what we see here from this
[1:54:35.980 --> 1:54:38.540]  Politico article that came out on the 11th
[1:54:39.340 --> 1:54:44.860]  There's really an attempt for them to get ahead of the story to put a spin on this for the democrats because that's where
[1:54:44.860 --> 1:54:49.260]  Politico has hung out and what they talk about with this is ukrainian efforts to sabotage
[1:54:49.820 --> 1:54:55.580]  Trump have actually backfired and of course they're saying this is going to make it very difficult for ukrainians to get any
[1:54:56.060 --> 1:55:01.180]  influence in the trump administration just as we see reports that these never trumpers are saying hey
[1:55:01.180 --> 1:55:05.100]  We're available if you want us for jobs in washington. It's like uh
[1:55:05.820 --> 1:55:10.700]  No, I don't think so. I don't think so. We're not too not too interested. Well, it looks like they have kind of um
[1:55:10.700 --> 1:55:14.060]  Damaged themselves, but I want you to see
[1:55:14.940 --> 1:55:18.940]  How this developed and they point out a ukrainian american operative
[1:55:19.260 --> 1:55:25.420]  Who was a consultant for the democrat national committee met with top officials in the ukrainian embassy in washington
[1:55:25.820 --> 1:55:30.380]  In an effort to expose ties between trump paul menifert and russia
[1:55:31.020 --> 1:55:33.020]  Now remember at the same time
[1:55:33.340 --> 1:55:38.300]  John pedesta's brother was heavily involved lobbyist firm and of course john pedesta and his brother live together
[1:55:38.300 --> 1:55:44.060]  They're very close and their connections on the pedesta side to russia as well
[1:55:44.140 --> 1:55:49.740]  But those were never talked about by the mainstream media were they so they wanted to try to focus this and create a situation
[1:55:49.820 --> 1:55:51.740]  paul manifert and russia
[1:55:51.740 --> 1:55:54.460]  Against trump. They say ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race
[1:55:54.940 --> 1:56:01.260]  They helped to force manifert's resignation the advance the narrative that trump's campaign was deeply connected to ukrainian
[1:56:01.900 --> 1:56:03.900]  foe to the east russia
[1:56:03.900 --> 1:56:09.420]  And then they go through and they talk about well, you know, we've seen that james clapper and the intelligence community have proven
[1:56:09.820 --> 1:56:12.540]  That there were direct efforts by vladimir putin
[1:56:13.020 --> 1:56:18.460]  Because remember this is politico and then they say but there's little evidence of such a top-down effort by ukraine really
[1:56:18.780 --> 1:56:22.700]  Okay, well, let's go through and see exactly what happened. They say nevertheless
[1:56:23.100 --> 1:56:26.780]  politico's investigation found evidence of ukrainian government involvement in the race
[1:56:27.260 --> 1:56:29.660]  That appears to strain diplomatic protocol
[1:56:29.660 --> 1:56:35.500]  That dictates that governments refrain from engaging in each other's elections. So they admit
[1:56:36.140 --> 1:56:38.460]  that the ukrainian government with this
[1:56:39.180 --> 1:56:41.020]  ukrainian american
[1:56:41.020 --> 1:56:48.060]  Working as a long time consultant for the democrat national committee. She worked there from 2004 to 2016. Her name is
[1:56:48.460 --> 1:56:50.460]  alexandra chalupa
[1:56:50.540 --> 1:56:55.660]  She worked at the white house office of public liaison during the clinton administration then worked to work for the dnc
[1:56:55.660 --> 1:57:01.020]  So she's got clinton credentials. She's got dnc credentials for 12 years and she's a ukrainian
[1:57:01.100 --> 1:57:03.580]  She goes with the the ukrainian embassy
[1:57:04.220 --> 1:57:07.180]  To work on this narrative about trump and the russians
[1:57:07.980 --> 1:57:12.860]  They say that she began researching a manifest role in janakovic's rise in ukraine
[1:57:13.100 --> 1:57:17.420]  She said that when trump's unlikely presidential campaign began surging in 2015
[1:57:17.660 --> 1:57:23.100]  She began focusing more on the research and expanded it to include trump's ties to russia as well
[1:57:23.100 --> 1:57:27.820]  So she and the dnc are really the fountainhead of this report
[1:57:27.820 --> 1:57:29.180]  That's the thing that you need to understand
[1:57:29.180 --> 1:57:35.100]  They say she occasionally shared her findings occasionally occasionally shared her findings with officials from the dnc and clinton campaign
[1:57:35.100 --> 1:57:37.420]  Of course, she did she's worked for the dnc and clinton's for
[1:57:38.460 --> 1:57:42.860]  Years and years chalupa told a senior dnc official that when it came to the trump campaign
[1:57:42.860 --> 1:57:46.940]  She said I felt I felt there was a russian connection
[1:57:46.940 --> 1:57:52.780]  So yeah, it's what we got from the intelligence committee, right? They said well, you know, we just feel like that's something that the russians would do
[1:57:53.020 --> 1:57:58.460]  That was the proof that they gave us we feel like that was something that they would do that they had the capability to do that
[1:57:58.460 --> 1:57:59.980]  Well, of course they did
[1:57:59.980 --> 1:58:04.220]  A lot of people had the capability to do that type of thing the very first gucifer
[1:58:04.220 --> 1:58:09.020]  Remember some of these came with somebody that was you know, we don't know who it was exactly gucifer 2.0
[1:58:09.020 --> 1:58:11.500]  But they did catch gucifer 1.0
[1:58:11.500 --> 1:58:17.900]  And it was a guy living in rumania with no computer science experience or programming experience or any
[1:58:18.220 --> 1:58:19.740]  He just guessed
[1:58:19.740 --> 1:58:24.780]  Passwords and got all these emails on colin powell on george w bush and so forth
[1:58:25.180 --> 1:58:29.580]  You don't have to have state level intelligence to do this, but that's what we see
[1:58:29.660 --> 1:58:33.020]  She says well, I felt it was that way this is where it started folks
[1:58:33.500 --> 1:58:39.340]  And politico goes through this tries to spin it and say well, it's not exactly, but it is we'll be right back

[2:00:21.900 --> 2:00:29.660]  Waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:00:40.540 --> 2:00:43.980]  Welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight alex jones is in the building
[2:00:43.980 --> 2:00:47.820]  He will be in the studio in the next segment. He's going to be taking the helm and at the bottom of the hour
[2:00:48.300 --> 2:00:57.260]  He'll be breaking down that special intel about very dangerous lethal information that they've discovered about proposed attacks
[2:00:57.340 --> 2:00:58.860]  and of course we talked to
[2:00:58.860 --> 2:01:01.100]  James O'Keefe of project veritas and last hour
[2:01:01.980 --> 2:01:09.580]  talking about not only attempts to create panic which can be lethal but also to release a gas butyric acid which is
[2:01:09.580 --> 2:01:16.460]  Disgusting the smell of vomit and the ventilation system to make people flee, but it is also very dangerous in a concentrated form
[2:01:17.180 --> 2:01:23.020]  He exposed that yesterday and today they have part two that is coming out talking about how they're planning to
[2:01:23.740 --> 2:01:30.380]  Take down the transportation system the train system. I presume that's the public train system there in washington dc
[2:01:31.100 --> 2:01:33.100]  so there's all kinds of
[2:01:33.100 --> 2:01:39.820]  Things in the wind quite literally coming up to the inauguration and alex is going to be breaking down some very serious
[2:01:40.300 --> 2:01:45.420]  Information about serious attacks at the bottom of the hour now this amount of time that we've got left
[2:01:45.580 --> 2:01:49.980]  I touched on this earlier in the day and this is a story that's up on the drudge report
[2:01:50.620 --> 2:01:55.180]  From ap as robots take jobs europeans mull free money for all
[2:01:56.140 --> 2:02:00.220]  And you have to understand where this is coming from and i'm very very disappointed
[2:02:00.220 --> 2:02:06.060]  To see people like charles murray who did groundbreaking work back in the 1980s as a conservative
[2:02:06.860 --> 2:02:09.100]  He wrote a book losing ground
[2:02:09.820 --> 2:02:11.820]  talking about how welfare
[2:02:11.820 --> 2:02:16.700]  Was making people dependent on the government and yet he has now become an advocate
[2:02:17.420 --> 2:02:24.140]  Of universal basic income and we've been talking about this for quite some time is clear that this is where they're heading
[2:02:24.460 --> 2:02:29.180]  We had a referendum last year and we talked about this extensively at that time the swiss held a referendum
[2:02:29.180 --> 2:02:35.980]  They proposed giving a basic universal income of $2,500 per month to every swiss citizen
[2:02:35.980 --> 2:02:37.980]  So they held a vote on that nationwide
[2:02:38.060 --> 2:02:40.060]  And it was overwhelmingly rejected
[2:02:40.540 --> 2:02:45.740]  Because the swiss are still some of the most independent minded people and they understand the danger of this
[2:02:46.780 --> 2:02:50.380]  And this is a course when we talk about a universal basic income. This is guaranteed
[2:02:51.020 --> 2:02:53.900]  Monthly money from the government with no strings attached
[2:02:53.900 --> 2:02:56.540]  So you're free to get a job or free not to get a job
[2:02:56.540 --> 2:03:00.540]  So you can just sit there and play video games all day or you can try to
[2:03:01.260 --> 2:03:07.020]  You can take art classes basket weaving you could start a business if you wanted to but we don't really need you to do that
[2:03:07.020 --> 2:03:10.940]  Because we've got the robots that are going to do that now. See this is the next stage that's coming
[2:03:11.740 --> 2:03:15.740]  so they've had a situation where they've been flooding our
[2:03:16.780 --> 2:03:18.780]  country with foreign workers
[2:03:19.020 --> 2:03:25.660]  Exporting our jobs to other countries and then bringing in foreign workers and then putting them in jobs where the younger people really haven't had
[2:03:25.660 --> 2:03:31.420]  The experience of being able to go in and work a minimum wage job and begin to learn a work ethic
[2:03:32.220 --> 2:03:38.300]  There's massive massive unemployment numbers amongst the millennials because they don't want them to get used to having a job
[2:03:38.300 --> 2:03:42.060]  They don't want them to get used to having a car and moving around because they're going to take the cars away
[2:03:42.060 --> 2:03:44.860]  They're going to have the robots run the cars. They're going to have the robots
[2:03:45.500 --> 2:03:49.980]  Building the equipment and it's all going to be owned by a few people just as we saw with Davos
[2:03:49.980 --> 2:03:55.500]  They had 62 people last year that had the equivalent to half of the world's population that's down to eight
[2:03:55.580 --> 2:04:01.100]  That's the kind of concentration of wealth. They want to turn everybody into passive renters
[2:04:01.900 --> 2:04:06.300]  And as we've talked about many times Alex Jones has talked about it the discussion with the elite were
[2:04:06.780 --> 2:04:13.660]  Are we going to kill everybody or will we just kind of pacify them and let them gradually disappear as we
[2:04:14.380 --> 2:04:17.980]  Make it impossible for them to reproduce or we take over the process of reproduction
[2:04:17.980 --> 2:04:21.260]  Just as we saw in Brave New World that plan is is coming true now
[2:04:21.580 --> 2:04:26.460]  This is something you have to understand go back and look at how it has already been practiced by the elites
[2:04:26.700 --> 2:04:31.180]  Practiced by our own government. Take a look at the american indian reservations
[2:04:31.740 --> 2:04:34.220]  They put them on these reservations said you can't leave
[2:04:34.860 --> 2:04:36.860]  They sent their kids away to be educated
[2:04:36.940 --> 2:04:39.900]  They restrict what they're able to do in terms of making a living
[2:04:39.900 --> 2:04:44.940]  They then extended that to the inner city with blacks with welfare program. Now. It's going to be universal for everybody
[2:04:44.940 --> 2:04:49.180]  They'll call it a universal basic income and they will restrict you to the cities
[2:04:49.260 --> 2:04:56.540]  It's called agenda 21 or the un agenda for sustainable development 2030 stay with us. Alex jones will be right back
[2:04:59.740 --> 2:05:05.740]  Nobody loves barack obama more than barack obama in his speech during the chicago cubs world series visit to the white house
[2:05:05.820 --> 2:05:10.620]  He referred to himself a humble 40 times in his farewell address one of his many farewells
[2:05:10.620 --> 2:05:15.660]  He referred to himself 75 times when campaigning for hillary clinton in philadelphia last year
[2:05:15.660 --> 2:05:22.620]  He referred to himself 137 times after the police shooting in dalis obama delivered an address in which he referred to himself
[2:05:22.700 --> 2:05:28.540]  45 times not once referencing himself as one to blame after a mass shooting in organ in a 12 minute speech
[2:05:28.540 --> 2:05:35.340]  He referenced himself 28 times at the democratic national convention obama referred to himself a whopping 119 times
[2:05:35.420 --> 2:05:39.340]  Some attendees were confused and thought he was running again when speaking in india last year
[2:05:39.340 --> 2:05:41.660]  He referred to himself 118 times
[2:05:41.740 --> 2:05:48.620]  It's an international love fest in a speech on jobs in ohio in 2010 barack referenced himself 132 times
[2:05:48.860 --> 2:05:53.100]  But i want you i want you to understand this is not about me
[2:05:53.420 --> 2:05:58.780]  And every morning he eats a bowl of barrios to start his day. This is oan shroyer for info wars.com

[2:07:13.900 --> 2:07:18.060]  Obesity diabetes cancer heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant
[2:07:18.380 --> 2:07:21.180]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge
[2:07:21.260 --> 2:07:24.460]  And everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease
[2:07:24.460 --> 2:07:28.780]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity

[2:08:09.180 --> 2:08:11.260]  We're live and the councils of government
[2:08:11.740 --> 2:08:17.340]  We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought
[2:08:17.340 --> 2:08:20.380]  By the military industrial complex
[2:08:29.580 --> 2:08:34.700]  It's a military mission in north st. Louis heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town
[2:08:34.940 --> 2:08:39.500]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood
[2:08:39.660 --> 2:08:44.220]  If you see military helicopters flying low over minneapolis do not be alarmed
[2:08:44.460 --> 2:08:46.620]  Guns will be taken no one will be able to be armed
[2:08:46.620 --> 2:08:47.980]  We will take all weapons
[2:08:48.060 --> 2:08:54.780]  Mr. And Mrs. America turn them all in just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way
[2:08:55.020 --> 2:08:57.020]  Enough enough enough
[2:08:57.660 --> 2:09:02.460]  Enough the department of homeland security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree
[2:09:02.620 --> 2:09:06.620]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition
[2:09:06.860 --> 2:09:13.180]  And as case late news 12th Jeff ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem
[2:09:13.180 --> 2:09:18.540]  Uh, so part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents
[2:09:18.780 --> 2:09:22.140]  Or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities
[2:09:22.220 --> 2:09:24.860]  If you've got a business that you didn't build that
[2:09:25.820 --> 2:09:27.820]  Somebody else made that happen
[2:09:28.300 --> 2:09:34.300]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics
[2:09:34.540 --> 2:09:39.180]  Black Hawk choppers soaring to the night sky, but this is only a drill
[2:09:39.180 --> 2:09:44.220]  Heavily armed officers in water town search for the suspect house to house
[2:09:51.820 --> 2:09:56.940]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police also military
[2:09:58.460 --> 2:10:03.020]  I am in my apartment, sir. The record song right now. I am inside. I have two words for you
[2:10:03.820 --> 2:10:05.660]  Predator gloves
[2:10:05.660 --> 2:10:09.660]  You will never see it coming
[2:10:10.700 --> 2:10:15.740]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras parents grabbing their children and running
[2:10:15.980 --> 2:10:22.700]  After spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle
[2:10:22.860 --> 2:10:23.740]  They let them in the area
[2:10:23.740 --> 2:10:28.060]  They told them they could come in and now they're coming in like their trespassers punching and shoving people
[2:10:28.300 --> 2:10:33.020]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down
[2:10:33.020 --> 2:10:35.500]  If you want to come and take him
[2:10:37.100 --> 2:10:46.460]  We are on the march the empire is on the run live from the info wars.com studios. It's alex jones
[2:10:51.900 --> 2:10:54.460]  We're live like an ounce of coming up
[2:10:54.460 --> 2:11:06.380]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
[2:11:10.540 --> 2:11:13.580]  More enemy waves coming in we're now three days out from the inauguration
[2:11:13.580 --> 2:11:23.740]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity the truth is whether it's obama or george soros
[2:11:24.460 --> 2:11:29.020]  Their losers everything they had everything they threw against us failed
[2:11:30.300 --> 2:11:31.420]  Now
[2:11:31.420 --> 2:11:37.740]  Just because we defeated these tyrants for now doesn't mean we've won the war the war has happened within our hearts
[2:11:37.740 --> 2:11:44.060]  Within our souls and on our minds. We have to be good. We have to be pure. We have to be strong
[2:11:44.380 --> 2:11:48.780]  We have to build prosperity and we have to bring every one of every race color and creed together
[2:11:50.060 --> 2:11:55.740]  If we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believe we were going to fail who believe their divide and conquer would work
[2:11:56.540 --> 2:11:57.740]  yes
[2:11:57.740 --> 2:11:59.740]  We've won the first phase
[2:11:59.740 --> 2:12:01.260]  the battle
[2:12:01.260 --> 2:12:03.260]  for the soul of humanity
[2:12:03.260 --> 2:12:05.260]  has just begun but
[2:12:05.260 --> 2:12:07.660]  Obama and hillary and soros
[2:12:09.100 --> 2:12:11.100]  He were losers from the day you were born
[2:12:24.620 --> 2:12:27.660]  This is the heart of 1776
[2:12:28.300 --> 2:12:33.980]  You white male. It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones
[2:12:33.980 --> 2:12:35.980]  move this
[2:12:35.980 --> 2:12:37.980]  get out the way
[2:12:38.940 --> 2:12:44.860]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the american flag
[2:12:45.100 --> 2:12:48.780]  Info wars helped fuel the rumor that president obama is in ices
[2:12:49.340 --> 2:12:54.220]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning. I will not let you down
[2:12:54.460 --> 2:12:56.460]  You'll be very very
[2:12:56.540 --> 2:13:01.260]  Impressed I hope and I think we'll be speaking a lot of Donald Trump and alex jones
[2:13:01.260 --> 2:13:09.020]  This means the Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the united states waging war on corruption
[2:13:09.900 --> 2:13:11.900]  alex jones
[2:13:12.940 --> 2:13:17.500]  And ladies and gentlemen, I am very very happy to be back in austin, texas
[2:13:17.820 --> 2:13:19.980]  Got off the airplane about an hour ago
[2:13:20.700 --> 2:13:26.380]  And i'm right back here in the saddle with the wonderful crew here in austin texas coming to you worldwide
[2:13:26.860 --> 2:13:28.860]  day but night in the last
[2:13:28.860 --> 2:13:37.020]  12th broadcasts also have a sunday show has done a superlative job along with paul joseph watson and the rest of this team
[2:13:37.660 --> 2:13:41.900]  I am just again very very honored and humbled to be associated with this great
[2:13:42.620 --> 2:13:51.660]  crew of human beings that are looking for the truth and promoting real justice and analyzing the globalist scientific plan
[2:13:52.620 --> 2:13:55.500]  To dumb down balkanize and enslave the people
[2:13:55.500 --> 2:14:00.700]  Doesn't mean we're perfect doesn't we get it all right, but we try to get it right and our hearts are in the right places
[2:14:00.700 --> 2:14:06.780]  And you can see that info wars thanks to you that our info wars is changing the world
[2:14:08.460 --> 2:14:10.300]  We're three days out
[2:14:10.300 --> 2:14:11.820]  tuesday
[2:14:11.820 --> 2:14:15.980]  Wednesday thursday, and then it's friday or you can technically say we're three and a half days out
[2:14:16.780 --> 2:14:21.900]  Four days until we know what the aftermath is of the 45th president of the united states donald trump
[2:14:21.900 --> 2:14:25.180]  Uh, actually not just getting elected but getting into office
[2:14:26.700 --> 2:14:28.940]  It's not a hard prediction to make
[2:14:29.660 --> 2:14:31.660]  fact, it's a really easy one to make
[2:14:32.780 --> 2:14:34.780]  100 to zero
[2:14:34.860 --> 2:14:37.500]  That they're going to ratchet up the disinformation
[2:14:37.980 --> 2:14:43.340]  Every day before he gets into office, and it's going to continue after but it's not going to be as big a threat
[2:14:43.340 --> 2:14:45.340]  It's still going to be very serious
[2:14:45.580 --> 2:14:47.580]  But the price of liberty is eternal vigilance
[2:14:47.580 --> 2:14:53.020]  If I ever see anything that's real about trump, I'll come out and say it. He's wrong on torture
[2:14:53.820 --> 2:14:57.180]  And he's wrong on quote give the fbi the iphone code
[2:14:57.820 --> 2:15:00.140]  It's the code to all the phones and they already have the back doors
[2:15:00.300 --> 2:15:01.660]  They can already get into them
[2:15:01.660 --> 2:15:06.700]  And so it's just an excuse just like obama did last week to just end the fourth amendment entirely
[2:15:06.700 --> 2:15:12.540]  I mean he just came out and said oh, I'm just signing a new order and uh, I've ordered the intelligence agencies to just
[2:15:12.540 --> 2:15:18.140]  Keep everything track everything and do whatever you want and nobody has to even be a suspect or for the profile
[2:15:20.540 --> 2:15:21.980]  I don't like that
[2:15:21.980 --> 2:15:23.500]  but that said
[2:15:23.500 --> 2:15:30.700]  Trump's heart's in the right place. He's for real and he's bringing in real policies that unseat the globalists and are going to dump
[2:15:31.980 --> 2:15:33.980]  so much opportunity
[2:15:34.220 --> 2:15:35.660]  And money
[2:15:35.660 --> 2:15:42.940]  On the american people. I mean, it's going to be crazy. Our only problem is we're going to turn into decadent slobs again
[2:15:43.100 --> 2:15:45.100]  That's the problem with the trump plan
[2:15:45.820 --> 2:15:47.820]  Is that prosperity
[2:15:47.820 --> 2:15:49.580]  makes monsters as
[2:15:49.580 --> 2:15:51.580]  vector hugo said
[2:15:51.820 --> 2:15:54.860]  It's true adversity makes man prosperity makes monsters
[2:15:56.780 --> 2:16:02.940]  Liberty always brings incredible wealth and that cycle continues then into the corruption into the degradation into the
[2:16:02.940 --> 2:16:04.940]  Collapse of society
[2:16:05.980 --> 2:16:09.500]  But do we have to keep repeating history over and over again?
[2:16:10.620 --> 2:16:14.460]  But we live in a very complex world and freedom has given us so many choices that
[2:16:15.020 --> 2:16:16.060]  We will still have freedom
[2:16:16.060 --> 2:16:20.380]  It's just not going to be equally distributed because a lot of people didn't have the history of freedom
[2:16:20.780 --> 2:16:22.940]  Or they didn't fight for freedom when they had it
[2:16:26.060 --> 2:16:29.740]  You see I love america and I love this planet and I love all of god's gifts
[2:16:29.740 --> 2:16:34.940]  I'm not somebody who's a loser who's just bitching and complaining because I'm in a victimology
[2:16:36.700 --> 2:16:40.300]  I'm fighting for what's good in the world. That's why I'm so angry
[2:16:41.180 --> 2:16:43.180]  I'm territorial about
[2:16:43.660 --> 2:16:47.900]  And I think about how people get territorial when I was on vacation. I'd be sitting there in a restaurant
[2:16:48.460 --> 2:16:54.140]  Slash bar watching people watch nfl playoffs. They'd be arguing with each other kind of bucking up
[2:16:54.220 --> 2:16:57.660]  It was all symbolic about are you for the cowboys or are you for
[2:16:57.660 --> 2:17:02.220]  This group or are you for the the Steelers or are you for the patriots?
[2:17:03.580 --> 2:17:05.580]  Imagine if people wore jerseys
[2:17:06.300 --> 2:17:10.220]  about their favorite part of the bill of rights or if they wore jerseys
[2:17:11.020 --> 2:17:12.860]  about
[2:17:12.860 --> 2:17:14.860]  their belief in property rights or
[2:17:15.580 --> 2:17:18.220]  God for that matter or or their children
[2:17:18.780 --> 2:17:21.260]  But instead we've been given these facsimiles
[2:17:22.220 --> 2:17:24.780]  of commitment so we can commit to the equivalent
[2:17:24.780 --> 2:17:30.700]  Of a blow-up sex doll and and I use that analogy you must get this break all the time
[2:17:31.660 --> 2:17:32.620]  that
[2:17:32.620 --> 2:17:35.020]  sports teams are admittedly bred in circuses
[2:17:35.740 --> 2:17:40.540]  To control the population and to take our mail energies and our travel energies and direct them off
[2:17:41.020 --> 2:17:43.740]  Into something that doesn't matter to the establishment
[2:17:44.540 --> 2:17:48.940]  We play the games of children while the elite control things we sleep while they live
[2:17:50.140 --> 2:17:52.060]  I'm not criticizing anybody that's into sports
[2:17:52.060 --> 2:17:56.060]  But if you pull back from it and see how sick it is there was a french nobleman
[2:17:56.060 --> 2:17:59.500]  I forget his name you can search engine the history of the modern olympics
[2:18:00.140 --> 2:18:02.540]  and you'll learn in the 1870s into the
[2:18:03.900 --> 2:18:08.700]  1920s there was a french member of the former royal family
[2:18:09.100 --> 2:18:14.780]  Who put his time and energy into controlling the population through popularizing sports for
[2:18:15.580 --> 2:18:16.860]  adults
[2:18:16.860 --> 2:18:18.620]  and getting men
[2:18:18.620 --> 2:18:21.660]  To start getting into sports instead of being
[2:18:22.700 --> 2:18:28.860]  Warriors and training for war now the argument was this is going to end global conflict and end wars
[2:18:28.940 --> 2:18:34.780]  Was how it was sold just like globalism world governments sold to end all wars just don't make men men anymore
[2:18:35.820 --> 2:18:37.820]  Or or or you know give them
[2:18:38.300 --> 2:18:43.420]  Don't let them conduct real trains give them toy trains figuratively don't let them be real warriors
[2:18:43.660 --> 2:18:44.540]  We don't want that going on
[2:18:44.540 --> 2:18:50.700]  Let's let's have them all be their little tribal groups and go paint their faces up and yell and scream and you can go read
[2:18:52.940 --> 2:18:56.380]  How his writings got picked up by the turn of a century
[2:18:56.940 --> 2:19:01.740]  And they started having olympics and then hitler picked it up and made it really big in 1936
[2:19:03.180 --> 2:19:09.660]  And invited members of that fellow's family. I should go into history. I don't have the articles pulled up in history, but it it's amazing
[2:19:11.500 --> 2:19:13.500]  And then they exported it here
[2:19:13.500 --> 2:19:20.700]  I mean it wasn't till the 20s and 30s that men's baseball teams were taken seriously or any of this crap
[2:19:21.580 --> 2:19:28.700]  That we think is america. It's not just like santa claus wasn't popular until the 40s when coca-cola popularized santa claus
[2:19:28.940 --> 2:19:30.620]  Yeah, he existed
[2:19:30.620 --> 2:19:34.540]  Did you know that santa claus in england got banned 300 plus years ago?
[2:19:35.020 --> 2:19:38.860]  Because people were dressing up santa claus wore red and white stripes
[2:19:38.860 --> 2:19:44.780]  It was a gang and you went out and raped and killed people and burned buildings down on christmas eve
[2:19:45.740 --> 2:19:47.740]  He was basically freddy kruger
[2:19:48.940 --> 2:19:54.060]  But I mean and that's why you kind of give it an amalgamation today where it's awk rumpus
[2:19:54.380 --> 2:20:00.700]  You know the bad german santa claus and the russians have their bad santa claus and the the dutch have theirs and
[2:20:01.900 --> 2:20:05.740]  You know then the good santa claus has his black peters and i mean it's it's it
[2:20:05.740 --> 2:20:13.180]  It all varies culture to culture but santa claus you think's been there forever is was made up in the 1940s the guy
[2:20:13.740 --> 2:20:20.060]  You know in the red and white suit there was a poem before that what 60 years before about the night before christmas
[2:20:20.860 --> 2:20:23.100]  But other than that it's a total invention
[2:20:23.820 --> 2:20:25.820]  Just like the stupid nfl
[2:20:26.460 --> 2:20:28.460]  Just like all of it
[2:20:29.260 --> 2:20:33.580]  So here's why i'm against the nfl it's been set up to emasculate me
[2:20:33.580 --> 2:20:37.660]  Or to demasculate me. It's been set up to steal
[2:20:38.300 --> 2:20:45.260]  Who I am so that if there's a threat to myself and my family i'll be politically involved in modern forms of warfare
[2:20:47.500 --> 2:20:53.180]  That are not physical but are done through the law and done through speech and done through the soapbox and the electronic soapbox
[2:20:53.180 --> 2:20:55.180]  That's what i'm supposed to do as a man
[2:20:55.340 --> 2:20:57.340]  and instead
[2:20:58.060 --> 2:21:00.060]  We play fantasy football
[2:21:00.060 --> 2:21:06.460]  We play a fantasy game about another fantasy that doesn't matter and then we watch television
[2:21:08.060 --> 2:21:10.060]  And we see
[2:21:10.060 --> 2:21:12.860]  Actors playing fake newscasters
[2:21:13.180 --> 2:21:20.780]  Telling us about fake news a la steven cobert and the irony is not lost on people take maxine waters
[2:21:22.060 --> 2:21:24.060]  And and and all these other people
[2:21:25.420 --> 2:21:27.420]  Running around
[2:21:27.420 --> 2:21:29.420]  saying
[2:21:29.420 --> 2:21:34.940]  Saying we played the clip earlier that donald trump isn't just a russian agent
[2:21:36.860 --> 2:21:38.540]  Donald trump
[2:21:38.540 --> 2:21:41.740]  Actually doesn't have any thoughts of his own his tweets
[2:21:42.220 --> 2:21:47.820]  Everything he says is told to him by the russians because americans couldn't come up with crooked hillary
[2:21:48.700 --> 2:21:50.700]  even like if you drive to the countryside you see a
[2:21:51.820 --> 2:21:58.140]  Red barn and you go look it's a red barn. They go oh the russians must have told you it's a red barn
[2:21:58.140 --> 2:22:00.140]  You're like no, it's a red barn
[2:22:00.860 --> 2:22:06.300]  No one ever thought that she's crooked. No one ever imagined that that would be a nickname for
[2:22:09.260 --> 2:22:12.380]  I mean i would call jeb bush silverspoon dumbass
[2:22:12.940 --> 2:22:15.580]  Did the russians tell me to say that no that's what he is
[2:22:15.820 --> 2:22:19.340]  It's not that we're against wealth we're against somebody given everything
[2:22:19.820 --> 2:22:24.380]  multi-generationally the bushes have been given everything for two generations
[2:22:24.380 --> 2:22:33.660]  It was grandpa that actually made a deal with the nazis and ran some major fraud and scams or at least steal the money
[2:22:36.940 --> 2:22:44.620]  And it just goes on and on and then gloria all red comes climbing out of whatever horses in she lives in
[2:22:45.820 --> 2:22:48.940]  And you know she comes climbing out, you know like like a possum
[2:22:48.940 --> 2:22:56.300]  Uh to to announce that oh another woman another woman that donald trump
[2:22:56.700 --> 2:22:59.180]  Uh had it was was made advances on
[2:23:00.780 --> 2:23:03.740]  Every time these women actually get into court it all folds
[2:23:04.620 --> 2:23:06.620]  homemade up
[2:23:09.980 --> 2:23:12.940]  You know i know a lot of people that have known donald trump for a long time
[2:23:13.420 --> 2:23:17.660]  And you know i'm not going to defend donald trump with the inside knowledge i have let me just explain something
[2:23:17.660 --> 2:23:19.900]  Donald trump is a clean freak
[2:23:20.460 --> 2:23:25.900]  And donald trump is very specific about any woman he dates or marries
[2:23:26.540 --> 2:23:28.700]  If donald trump likes you he's gonna marry you
[2:23:30.860 --> 2:23:34.300]  I mean if you're getting in the sack with donald trump you're getting married to him
[2:23:34.940 --> 2:23:38.620]  You can faulty for being married three four times. The point is he's one of those guys where
[2:23:39.900 --> 2:23:43.660]  He's gonna jump in the sack with you. He's gonna marry you. This is complete
[2:23:44.380 --> 2:23:45.500]  made up
[2:23:45.500 --> 2:23:51.660]  Loaning and they know it just like the not one not two not three not four not five
[2:23:51.900 --> 2:23:58.380]  But six lawsuits that have been dropped with jane doe made up names of him raping
[2:23:59.660 --> 2:24:02.060]  Teenage girls with jeffrey eppstein
[2:24:03.100 --> 2:24:06.460]  20 something years ago totally made up
[2:24:07.740 --> 2:24:13.260]  Completely made up. It's the clintons that hang around with him. They knew that was gonna come out
[2:24:13.260 --> 2:24:15.820]  So they ran it in the media that it was the trump
[2:24:18.060 --> 2:24:27.260]  The trump the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
[2:24:30.940 --> 2:24:35.580]  And you know folks paul wassen reported on it. We were contacted by
[2:24:36.780 --> 2:24:38.780]  an individual at mbc and
[2:24:38.780 --> 2:24:43.180]  We made them show credentials in the whole nine yards. We still say claiming to be with mbc
[2:24:43.660 --> 2:24:46.460]  That they've been passing this tape around and I've heard about for over a year
[2:24:46.700 --> 2:24:50.140]  Just like the pp gate thing heard about that a year and a half. It was on the four chance site
[2:24:51.020 --> 2:24:53.020]  Totally made up. Oh by the way, they admit that's all fake
[2:24:54.540 --> 2:24:56.540]  They admit that's all fake
[2:24:56.780 --> 2:25:01.100]  But doesn't matter they go on hardball last night and bring it all up again
[2:25:02.140 --> 2:25:04.300]  That's right. I mean she says with a straight face
[2:25:04.780 --> 2:25:06.780]  Like I'm gonna play it again later
[2:25:06.780 --> 2:25:08.780]  The big announcements coming up in the next segment
[2:25:11.100 --> 2:25:14.140]  That the russians came up with the term crooked hillary
[2:25:16.540 --> 2:25:20.540]  And now they've got news articles out saying it's worse hillary for prison
[2:25:21.340 --> 2:25:25.980]  All of it came from the russians. That's right. I I didn't think of that
[2:25:26.780 --> 2:25:31.420]  The russians did the russians are in my ear here. What do I say next booton?
[2:25:31.420 --> 2:25:39.100]  Here it is desperate democrat calls for trump impeachment claims russia fed him the term
[2:25:39.500 --> 2:25:43.180]  Crooked hillary and everything else. That's right at 2 a.m
[2:25:43.580 --> 2:25:49.180]  He goes into like a egg of silence a little pod and putin pops up
[2:25:49.740 --> 2:25:53.260]  And then tells donald trump when no one can tell donald trump anything
[2:25:57.820 --> 2:25:59.820]  Unless you're super aggressive
[2:25:59.820 --> 2:26:03.580]  There are very few people that trump actually listens to
[2:26:04.460 --> 2:26:07.500]  And or you gotta have a track record of being on target for trump listen to you as well
[2:26:08.700 --> 2:26:10.700]  I wonder who trump listens to
[2:26:13.100 --> 2:26:17.100]  You know, I listen I can get trump back on the show if I want to that's not even the big issue
[2:26:17.180 --> 2:26:19.980]  I know how much trouble it'll cause what a big ass little b
[2:26:19.980 --> 2:26:29.020]  And so trump has not been back on the show yet, but I'm gonna give the media some big heydays here, but uh, let's just say that uh
[2:26:33.260 --> 2:26:39.020]  I do talk to talk to trump some yeah the president and it's not the power trip that it's a president
[2:26:39.420 --> 2:26:42.460]  It's the power trip that it's a president fighting the neural order
[2:26:42.460 --> 2:26:50.060]  Under complete attack and history is completely happening in front of us and it's so cool
[2:26:50.300 --> 2:26:57.820]  I mean trump is just so classy folks and that's why you see all these liars and all these scumbags and all the things they're doing like
[2:27:00.060 --> 2:27:02.060]  Democratic congresswoman
[2:27:03.500 --> 2:27:05.500]  Coming on chris mathews
[2:27:05.500 --> 2:27:12.700]  And claiming I mean, I just can't get over this. This is a craziest crap, but they really say this see
[2:27:13.340 --> 2:27:17.580]  The democrats aren't just now saying any criticism of them as racists
[2:27:18.300 --> 2:27:26.620]  They're now saying any information like I don't like the tpp or obama care ripping me off. Oh my gosh, you're racist or you're a russian agent
[2:27:27.580 --> 2:27:30.300]  And notice they're only putting black people out now
[2:27:30.300 --> 2:27:34.460]  Like john lewis like maxine waters and others
[2:27:36.060 --> 2:27:41.340]  To criticize trump so that when he counters back they go. Oh my gosh. Look you're racist
[2:27:43.340 --> 2:27:49.660]  John lewis you are a russian agent. You should be overthrown. There should be an impeachment. You're not legitimate. I don't see you as legitimate
[2:27:50.700 --> 2:27:56.620]  Gee congressman lewis you've got really bad economy in your area of georgia. I'd like to help those intercity communities
[2:27:56.620 --> 2:28:00.940]  Please work with me as your president. I really want to get some jobs in there
[2:28:07.740 --> 2:28:10.540]  They set the whole thing up. That's how they're thinking it's cnn
[2:28:11.580 --> 2:28:16.940]  We'll have lewis come on the media go. Oh my gosh a congressman says trump's not fit to be in there
[2:28:16.940 --> 2:28:20.940]  And he doesn't recognize if there's a big boycott will trump be impeached on ton ton
[2:28:20.940 --> 2:28:26.300]  I mean as if that isn't sappy enough then they shift into the next phase of it
[2:28:27.420 --> 2:28:30.620]  Going he attacked a civil rights icon
[2:28:33.180 --> 2:28:35.180]  I mean this is just crazy
[2:28:36.620 --> 2:28:42.300]  Says nothing about race other than I want to help black areas. I want to get jobs in there
[2:28:42.620 --> 2:28:47.820]  I want to make people not be dependent. I want to reverse the great society that domesticated black people
[2:28:47.820 --> 2:28:51.820]  And it's domesticated everybody else and they go. Oh my gosh you're racist
[2:28:54.300 --> 2:28:59.740]  And now the counters this congresswoman they're gonna come out and say oh that's because she's black but I noticed that
[2:29:01.340 --> 2:29:06.300]  Everything the everyone making these accusations is black on purpose. It's not it's not
[2:29:06.940 --> 2:29:10.940]  Hillary doing it. It's not her surrogates. It's it's it's it's it's it's black folks
[2:29:11.660 --> 2:29:16.460]  They're now putting out there like the woman that's a foxtrotributor. Um, it's green who's up for the job
[2:29:16.460 --> 2:29:22.220]  Uh as the democratic head and Tucker Carlson's like, well, what do you think of his plan to like cut the price of proficient drugs?
[2:29:22.460 --> 2:29:24.460]  Well, he's a racist. I don't even discuss it
[2:29:25.900 --> 2:29:31.500]  Like okay. Well, what about this topic? I'm not even discussing his topics racist. I have one magic word
[2:29:31.740 --> 2:29:35.340]  I mean, this is the craziest or russian agent russian agent
[2:29:35.820 --> 2:29:42.860]  I mean the truth is trumps a vegetable folks. He can't even talk. He's actually a robot that putin speaks into this is ridiculous
[2:29:42.860 --> 2:29:48.540]  I mean, this is so stupid. This is unbelievable. Stay with us the big announcement straight ahead
[2:29:49.100 --> 2:29:52.140]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:52.940 --> 2:29:55.820]  Alex Jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:59.580 --> 2:30:03.820]  With the inauguration around the corner, here's what we know about the fascists who are trying to obstruct
[2:30:03.820 --> 2:30:09.740]  Donald Trump's inauguration hundreds of thousands will be there to protest the inauguration of trump marching and chanting in the streets
[2:30:09.740 --> 2:30:15.740]  Over fake news, but it has gotten darker advertisements to pay trump protesters cropping up in dozens of us cities
[2:30:15.900 --> 2:30:21.100]  People like rosy mcdonald calling for martial law charles schumer threatening trump with the intelligence community
[2:30:21.260 --> 2:30:25.340]  Michael more marching in the women's march against trump pushing anti trump false narratives
[2:30:25.420 --> 2:30:31.900]  We know about the fake dossiers and now more is emerging as radical leftists are planning violent protests plans for planting and
[2:30:32.140 --> 2:30:39.340]  Discharging acidic chemicals into ventilation systems disrupt j20 is mobilizing thousands and planning on blocking streets and transit in response
[2:30:39.340 --> 2:30:44.060]  There will be unprecedented security. We fully support the first amendment in the exercise thereof
[2:30:44.140 --> 2:30:47.660]  But people plotting illegal activities need to be brought into custody now
[2:30:47.740 --> 2:30:52.780]  Perhaps even arrested to deter these fascists from illegally disrupting the peaceful transition of power
[2:30:52.860 --> 2:30:58.700]  But something tells me that's not going to happen. This is oan shroyer and info wars will see you at the inauguration
[2:30:59.580 --> 2:31:06.300]  You're investing in your health and supporting the info war when you visit info wars life.com and purchase your supply of survival shield
[2:31:06.300 --> 2:31:10.540]  X2 nascent iodine and all the great products then for worse life.com as you know
[2:31:10.540 --> 2:31:13.420]  We've talked to pharmacists chemists doctors researchers
[2:31:13.660 --> 2:31:22.060]  Scientists and the answer is clear iodine is key is paramount and there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't
[2:31:22.140 --> 2:31:25.260]  Even keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine
[2:31:25.420 --> 2:31:32.860]  We drill down more than 7000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine on top of that
[2:31:32.860 --> 2:31:39.500]  We also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling. It is the purest cleanest strongest out there quite frankly
[2:31:39.500 --> 2:31:46.540]  I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors
[2:31:46.620 --> 2:31:53.180]  To get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have it is exclusive
[2:31:53.260 --> 2:31:58.860]  To info wars life.com and the info wars life family of incredible products
[2:31:58.860 --> 2:32:03.740]  We have the new product in info wars life.com bio true selenium
[2:32:03.740 --> 2:32:11.020]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic
[2:32:11.340 --> 2:32:16.460]  Bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract when you take selenium in the body
[2:32:16.620 --> 2:32:23.740]  It actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body. It helps balance the thyroid gland. It helps detoxify
[2:32:24.140 --> 2:32:26.860]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves
[2:32:26.860 --> 2:32:32.540]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body as a matter of fact
[2:32:32.540 --> 2:32:39.660]  There's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium. So it really is a
[2:32:40.220 --> 2:32:46.780]  All-around nutrient that everybody really needs. I'm taking it now every day. This is soaking bio true
[2:32:47.100 --> 2:32:52.460]  Selenium is the product the best selenium that we could bring you we believe it's the best out there at a very very low price
[2:32:52.460 --> 2:32:58.380]  Excusably available at info wars live comm or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine
[2:33:16.380 --> 2:33:20.380]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:33:20.380 --> 2:33:26.780]  Love from the info wars comm studios. It's alex jones
[2:33:30.300 --> 2:33:34.780]  Fighting against the new world order is a man's game and believe me info wars is
[2:33:35.260 --> 2:33:41.180]  Not just the tip of the spear but the spearhead and you the listeners and viewers are the heart the blood the soul
[2:33:41.660 --> 2:33:44.220]  Of this entire operation. I don't say that patronizingly
[2:33:45.260 --> 2:33:47.260]  You need to know the effect you're having. I
[2:33:47.260 --> 2:33:50.860]  I just had an incredible experience the last two weeks
[2:33:51.580 --> 2:33:53.580]  traveling
[2:33:54.700 --> 2:34:01.260]  All over the place and the listenership has just exploded to a level where it's beyond fight club
[2:34:02.460 --> 2:34:04.860]  And again, I don't say that to brag and say oh our show is big
[2:34:05.500 --> 2:34:07.500]  It's the content of the broadcast that's big
[2:34:08.060 --> 2:34:14.060]  But the average person doesn't understand how strong the liberty movement is worldwide not just here in the us. It's
[2:34:14.620 --> 2:34:16.620]  gigantic
[2:34:16.620 --> 2:34:18.620]  And people really get it
[2:34:18.940 --> 2:34:20.940]  I had so many
[2:34:20.940 --> 2:34:23.820]  Asians and hispanics and black folks
[2:34:24.860 --> 2:34:28.300]  Come up to me that were listeners with with tears in their eyes
[2:34:28.780 --> 2:34:32.220]  thanking me and thanking donald trump and thanking roger stone
[2:34:33.260 --> 2:34:36.620]  And I was like don't thank me brother. We're in this together
[2:34:38.140 --> 2:34:42.780]  We all recognize we've got real evil in the control that's trying to divide everybody
[2:34:42.780 --> 2:34:49.500]  The the over-the-top scandals they've levied against trump that he's a russian spy maxine waters
[2:34:49.500 --> 2:34:52.460]  We played the clip earlier to play it coming up saying that
[2:34:53.340 --> 2:34:58.940]  the russians feed him crooked hillary and feed him that she's sick and feed
[2:34:59.980 --> 2:35:04.700]  Trump everything that's the craziest thing in the world to say anybody's feeding trump something
[2:35:04.700 --> 2:35:12.700]  Nevertheless, it was drudge in 2013 that first began to talk about how bad she looked because she looked like she was dying
[2:35:13.340 --> 2:35:17.020]  And she'd been in the hospital for a year. That's not the russians
[2:35:18.700 --> 2:35:19.820]  Now
[2:35:19.820 --> 2:35:21.820]  It's all about the russians, isn't it?
[2:35:22.220 --> 2:35:24.060]  Here's the big announcement
[2:35:24.060 --> 2:35:27.660]  I'm gonna let roger stone and he's in the middle of it. He's the center of it
[2:35:28.140 --> 2:35:29.980]  break it down for you
[2:35:29.980 --> 2:35:31.980]  I've had to sit on this info for
[2:35:31.980 --> 2:35:35.420]  A week and a half believe me. I didn't like doing it, but it had to be done
[2:35:37.180 --> 2:35:39.740]  This deals with the deep state in every way and
[2:35:40.300 --> 2:35:45.980]  This deals with the free press in this country and stone also wanted to spend time to talk to his sources
[2:35:46.940 --> 2:35:53.180]  And to find out where they think this all originated from and it's very clear if you do the chess math
[2:35:53.820 --> 2:35:55.820]  where it came from
[2:35:55.820 --> 2:36:06.540]  Because who out there are they more obsessed about than roger stone or alex jones roger stone probably even more than i they're obsessed with him
[2:36:06.940 --> 2:36:11.580]  He goes donald trump roger stone alex jones steven bannon and believe me. I don't want to be at the top of that list
[2:36:11.580 --> 2:36:17.180]  It's a dangerous list so uh, they're starting congressional investigation into the russian hack
[2:36:17.180 --> 2:36:22.220]  They've already had mccain and his little show trials with ppgate, which they now admits totally made up
[2:36:22.220 --> 2:36:25.340]  And the british government's come out and said it's bull. Well, of course, it's bull
[2:36:26.060 --> 2:36:31.660]  It was on fourchan a year and a half ago. That's the hacker site. It was written by a 12 year old probably so
[2:36:32.700 --> 2:36:35.420]  Where is all this going? Why is this one of the biggest announcements?
[2:36:35.420 --> 2:36:36.300]  I've ever made
[2:36:36.300 --> 2:36:43.100]  Probably the biggest if you look at the whole atmosphere of where we are to let you know how ruthless the enemy is
[2:36:43.740 --> 2:36:48.940]  And the climate we're in so roger stone. I'm gonna give you the floor to walk through this the motive
[2:36:49.500 --> 2:36:51.500]  why they've done this
[2:36:51.500 --> 2:36:54.620]  This is this is the stuff of a james bond
[2:36:55.660 --> 2:36:57.100]  movie
[2:36:57.100 --> 2:36:59.100]  roger stone
[2:36:59.260 --> 2:37:00.300]  alex
[2:37:00.300 --> 2:37:03.740]  Great to be back with you. I'm glad to see you back from vacation and I am
[2:37:04.540 --> 2:37:07.180]  Glad to have turned in my manuscript for
[2:37:07.980 --> 2:37:15.180]  About 145,000 words about 460 pages for the making of the president 2016
[2:37:16.060 --> 2:37:18.940]  How donald trump orchestrated an american revolution?
[2:37:19.580 --> 2:37:21.100]  alex as you know
[2:37:21.100 --> 2:37:21.980]  uh
[2:37:21.980 --> 2:37:24.940]  Prior to christmas. I became extremely ill
[2:37:25.500 --> 2:37:29.020]  This was at precisely the time that I had to be
[2:37:29.820 --> 2:37:31.820]  prodigiously trying to produce about
[2:37:32.220 --> 2:37:34.220]  2000 words a day
[2:37:34.940 --> 2:37:36.940]  Uh for my book
[2:37:37.580 --> 2:37:42.060]  And one of the important aspects of my book is the detailed debunking
[2:37:43.020 --> 2:37:48.140]  Of this russian hacking nonsense and a very direct refutation
[2:37:48.140 --> 2:37:50.140]  Of the claims by uh
[2:37:51.260 --> 2:37:52.780]  John pedesta
[2:37:52.780 --> 2:37:57.340]  Uh and the mainstream media and others the washington post the new york times
[2:37:57.980 --> 2:38:02.860]  That I had advanced notice of the hacking that the hacking ever took place
[2:38:03.500 --> 2:38:05.820]  Uh that as pedesta told the washington post
[2:38:06.380 --> 2:38:08.700]  I told uh donald trump in advance
[2:38:09.180 --> 2:38:11.180]  So I exposed these things
[2:38:11.660 --> 2:38:13.660]  Now we have a congressional investigation
[2:38:14.540 --> 2:38:16.540]  Uh and senator richard burr
[2:38:16.540 --> 2:38:18.540]  And senator john warner
[2:38:19.420 --> 2:38:21.980]  Uh are going to conduct public hearings
[2:38:22.780 --> 2:38:30.940]  Now in all honesty, I would welcome being invited to those public hearings. I welcome their investigators
[2:38:31.500 --> 2:38:33.500]  Uh as I said, I would welcome
[2:38:34.060 --> 2:38:36.060]  an fbi investigation
[2:38:36.300 --> 2:38:38.300]  When congressman jerry nadler
[2:38:38.860 --> 2:38:40.860]  and congressman
[2:38:41.020 --> 2:38:42.780]  Elijah Cummings
[2:38:42.780 --> 2:38:45.500]  In a classic case of the new macartheism
[2:38:45.500 --> 2:38:49.980]  Um demanded of the fbi director that I be investigated
[2:38:50.780 --> 2:38:53.100]  Uh I welcome that scrutiny
[2:38:53.580 --> 2:39:00.700]  And let me just interject months ago when this was all happening on a daily basis national news attacking you cnn not letting you come on and respond
[2:39:00.940 --> 2:39:04.060]  When they're calling you a russian spy shangy work for wiki leagues
[2:39:04.700 --> 2:39:06.380]  totally made up
[2:39:06.380 --> 2:39:07.500]  and
[2:39:07.500 --> 2:39:12.380]  So if you do the math here, there's a problem. In fact on air we joked about it. We said this is wonderful
[2:39:12.380 --> 2:39:16.620]  Let them have hearings and call you in on c span with the new macartheism
[2:39:16.620 --> 2:39:21.340]  You'll be like the famous lawyer that says, you know, have you no decency? We talked about all that
[2:39:21.740 --> 2:39:26.940]  But so you're doing the math. What's the problem? You're gonna go with this russians took over the election
[2:39:27.500 --> 2:39:31.340]  Idea and you've got this one guy who's the fall guy. We're gonna blame it all on
[2:39:31.660 --> 2:39:37.900]  But we don't want him talking it'd be much better if he wasn't there and then we could say the russians did it
[2:39:37.900 --> 2:39:39.900]  Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead
[2:39:39.900 --> 2:39:41.900]  So alex, um
[2:39:42.460 --> 2:39:44.780]  Glenn greenwald, I think nailed this this week
[2:39:45.420 --> 2:39:52.460]  In his piece the deep state is very upset about the election of donald trump and the fact that he's going to up end the established order
[2:39:52.860 --> 2:39:55.740]  They're not going to get their expanded proxy war
[2:39:56.380 --> 2:39:59.340]  In uh in syria, which they desperately want
[2:39:59.740 --> 2:40:03.820]  They're not going to get world war three out of a president donald trump
[2:40:03.820 --> 2:40:10.860]  Who is committed to detain who is committed to a new relationship with the russians some hard-headed negotiations?
[2:40:11.580 --> 2:40:16.140]  But peace we can spend our money on missiles and guns and bombs
[2:40:16.700 --> 2:40:24.540]  Or we can spend them on infrastructure roads bridges hospitals and schools and president trump knows this as I told you
[2:40:24.540 --> 2:40:26.540]  I became extremely ill
[2:40:27.100 --> 2:40:29.100]  this manifested itself in
[2:40:29.820 --> 2:40:31.820]  over 14 days of high fevers
[2:40:31.820 --> 2:40:38.860]  Delirium night sweats. Uh, I had uh, uh lesions on my chest and my face
[2:40:39.420 --> 2:40:45.980]  Uh, I had uh, uh extreme uh diarrhea. I had vomiting that could not be stopped
[2:40:46.460 --> 2:40:53.340]  Uh with medication. Uh, I became exceedingly dehydrated and I hope ultimately had to be uh
[2:40:54.060 --> 2:41:00.780]  Hydrated with uh ivy and saline injection as you said the last time you were in the hospital was when you were born
[2:41:00.780 --> 2:41:06.780]  Yes, I am a generally a healthy person. You're a marathon runner in whole nine yards. I have been a runner and a weightlifter
[2:41:07.020 --> 2:41:12.060]  I uh, I'm very careful in my diet. I'm a user of the info war supplements
[2:41:12.460 --> 2:41:15.020]  I have been uh treated with acupuncture
[2:41:15.580 --> 2:41:22.620]  By perhaps the greatest acupuncturist in the state of florid if not the united states dr. Quinn martielli who was trained in china
[2:41:23.260 --> 2:41:25.260]  I'm generally a healthy person
[2:41:25.740 --> 2:41:27.740]  In the beginning. I thought I had a routine
[2:41:27.740 --> 2:41:31.500]  Stomach virus and this was you know, a pain in the neck
[2:41:32.140 --> 2:41:38.060]  Given my deadline on the book and the fact that my entire family was headed to florida for christmas
[2:41:38.140 --> 2:41:44.060]  And we even had to cancel one of our important meetings. We're gonna have in florida. Yes, indeed. So, uh, I ultimately went
[2:41:44.780 --> 2:41:49.820]  To the doctors at mount sinai hospital in miami beach my own personal physician
[2:41:50.300 --> 2:41:55.740]  They conducted extensive blood tests those blood tests were passed on to cdc
[2:41:55.740 --> 2:41:59.260]  The general consensus is that I was poisoned
[2:41:59.900 --> 2:42:05.660]  I was poisoned with uh, they now say a substance that may have been polonium or had the
[2:42:06.540 --> 2:42:08.540]  characteristics of polonium
[2:42:08.940 --> 2:42:10.940]  This made me exceedingly ill
[2:42:11.580 --> 2:42:12.700]  the
[2:42:12.700 --> 2:42:18.300]  The conjecture of all the doctors was that I did not receive a large enough dose
[2:42:18.940 --> 2:42:22.700]  To kill me, but I have never been this ill now
[2:42:22.700 --> 2:42:25.420]  Um, who would want to do this to me?
[2:42:26.460 --> 2:42:32.860]  I am an enemy of the deep state. I think people know that I was an insider in american politics
[2:42:32.940 --> 2:42:37.740]  I was close uh to uh power in nine presidential elections
[2:42:38.300 --> 2:42:44.620]  Everything glenn greenwald says is true. The republican democrat bush plenton deep state
[2:42:45.180 --> 2:42:49.180]  Uh, it has manufactured the this russian fraud
[2:42:49.180 --> 2:42:55.820]  They have compounded it by taking a clearly fabricated document
[2:42:56.380 --> 2:43:01.820]  A document that uh has traced to a political consulting firm
[2:43:02.380 --> 2:43:07.180]  A fusion which was pushing this to a gentleman christopher steele
[2:43:07.660 --> 2:43:11.740]  Who created this fabricated document and I mean
[2:43:12.940 --> 2:43:17.580]  They're admitting that jeb bush was financing this but also others. What's your intel on that?
[2:43:17.580 --> 2:43:24.460]  Uh, I believe that this act this document was actually financed by dan senor who is a neocon
[2:43:25.660 --> 2:43:27.660]  Lacky of mit romney
[2:43:28.380 --> 2:43:30.380]  I believe that this
[2:43:30.860 --> 2:43:33.660]  piece of poison this total falsehood
[2:43:34.380 --> 2:43:36.380]  Uh about donald trump
[2:43:36.540 --> 2:43:42.220]  Uh has was peddled to every reporter in the country. Was this released as romney's revenge?
[2:43:42.220 --> 2:43:47.340]  Uh, I think this was romney's revenge of the irony of this, of course, alex is had
[2:43:47.900 --> 2:43:49.900]  donald trump selected
[2:43:50.060 --> 2:43:51.180]  mit romney
[2:43:51.180 --> 2:43:55.980]  Mr. Senor probably would have been the number two man at the state department now
[2:43:56.700 --> 2:44:03.740]  There there is treachery by the way senor was also implicated in the release of the billy bush nbc
[2:44:04.380 --> 2:44:09.340]  Uh attacked on trump which by the way, I mean i want to get into why they do do this the polonium
[2:44:09.340 --> 2:44:12.940]  How big a deal this is it was a sensation when it happened alexander
[2:44:13.180 --> 2:44:18.780]  Live an inco and then of course it started coming out even in the british news that it was probably a false flag by british intelligence
[2:44:18.940 --> 2:44:21.580]  To blame the russians. Why would they poison this guy?
[2:44:21.660 --> 2:44:25.580]  Well, because he was a triple agent and it was useful to then demonize russia
[2:44:26.140 --> 2:44:27.980]  Clearly let's get into
[2:44:27.980 --> 2:44:31.820]  motives in all of this and I mean how rare this is polonium
[2:44:32.940 --> 2:44:35.340]  There's no such polonium like substance polonium
[2:44:35.340 --> 2:44:39.420]  Now obviously the deep stage trying to back off that because this is so sensational
[2:44:39.420 --> 2:44:44.860]  It didn't kill you now. You will be able to testify in congress when they're demonizing you
[2:44:45.340 --> 2:44:50.700]  Uh by a stroke of luck. I guess you didn't drink the full drink or the full potion. I know, you know, the doctors don't know
[2:44:50.940 --> 2:44:56.940]  But this is just simply incredible. Let me let's walk through the math here the maciovallium calculus
[2:44:57.100 --> 2:45:02.940]  The stratagems why would they want to get rid of you? Obviously they don't want you to be able to testify when you're being demonized
[2:45:02.940 --> 2:45:08.300]  When you're being demonized, but also there's an obsession with you and I I know you were I met you at a jfk deal
[2:45:08.540 --> 2:45:12.140]  Okay, great, uh, but then about I guess two years ago. We actually met in person
[2:45:12.460 --> 2:45:18.540]  You know for the second time and you and you came in studio, but reading about you checking into you obviously as I did years ago
[2:45:19.340 --> 2:45:22.940]  new york times articles washington post articles washington times articles
[2:45:23.260 --> 2:45:27.740]  Hundreds of them that you're in people magazine just all sorts of new yorker magazine
[2:45:28.540 --> 2:45:31.100]  Where where they're like look at this guy. He's the guy that got
[2:45:31.100 --> 2:45:38.460]  You know nixon back into politics. He's the guy that got reagan to meet with trump and envision this thing from the start
[2:45:38.860 --> 2:45:43.580]  Uh, you know and and so they see you as this key guy that recognizes talent
[2:45:43.900 --> 2:45:46.460]  And as he junctured points over and over again
[2:45:46.860 --> 2:45:53.340]  And so reading and then even getting the wiki leaks, which we're both in but also in the same email, but also getting
[2:45:54.620 --> 2:45:56.700]  The other documents that came out
[2:45:56.700 --> 2:46:02.620]  Uh via project veritas where you're the nvp that must be taken out
[2:46:03.020 --> 2:46:05.660]  I mean the white house hillary all of them. I'm not
[2:46:06.220 --> 2:46:10.700]  Building you up here. Why frankly i'm asking. Why are they so obsessed with you roger stone
[2:46:11.180 --> 2:46:17.340]  Uh, alex. I'm not really sure perhaps the fact that I am effective on behalf of my beliefs has something to do with it
[2:46:17.340 --> 2:46:18.540]  look
[2:46:18.540 --> 2:46:22.620]  During this past campaign dozen not dozens a half dozen reporters
[2:46:22.620 --> 2:46:29.900]  New york times washington post wall street journal people. I trust people. I think are honest straight reporters
[2:46:30.380 --> 2:46:35.260]  No bias try to try to report it as they see it. Yes, there are some in fact. There's many
[2:46:35.980 --> 2:46:42.540]  Uh, at least three reporters who had spent actual time with both bill and hillary clinton told me
[2:46:43.340 --> 2:46:45.100]  These people hate you
[2:46:45.100 --> 2:46:49.500]  And I said, yeah, I know that it has to do with my book imagine they said no no you don't understand
[2:46:49.500 --> 2:46:56.060]  They are obsessed with you. They despise you. They want to know what you're doing
[2:46:57.340 --> 2:47:00.860]  Friend of mine, uh, whose wife works for hillary
[2:47:01.420 --> 2:47:08.060]  Told me that they gave her my book. She took it into the bedroom one night and they could hear her shrieking
[2:47:09.020 --> 2:47:11.820]  That son of a bitch that no good
[2:47:12.380 --> 2:47:16.140]  I can't say it on your show starts with the sea son of a bitch
[2:47:16.140 --> 2:47:21.260]  So, uh, alex, uh, these people despise me because I helped expose them
[2:47:21.900 --> 2:47:26.460]  But I don't think it was them. I must tell you I also well, let's just say it
[2:47:26.460 --> 2:47:29.180]  Let's just say it. They think you are trump's brain
[2:47:29.580 --> 2:47:34.060]  Which you're not we probably are some you are part of his brain. He definitely
[2:47:34.700 --> 2:47:37.660]  No alex. I am a loyal supporter of donald trump
[2:47:38.140 --> 2:47:40.140]  I have thought since 1988
[2:47:40.140 --> 2:47:46.220]  He had the size and the guts to take on a system that I saw getting increasingly
[2:47:46.620 --> 2:47:51.180]  Robert let's admit it. He even admits you're the main booster the main guy that got you got him with reagan
[2:47:51.420 --> 2:47:56.380]  You pushed him. He's been very humble 30 years ago. I mean trump would give you credit. You're not his brain
[2:47:56.460 --> 2:48:01.180]  I'm saying you're somebody he bounces stuff off of so they're going after trump's biggest supporters
[2:48:01.580 --> 2:48:06.380]  Uh, I am just fortunate to have been here on the sidelines. He's the one who got elected
[2:48:06.380 --> 2:48:13.260]  He's the one who's had the courage to take on the the oh, no doubt. No doubt. I'm I'm seeing from their perspective
[2:48:13.260 --> 2:48:19.340]  Well, they they if they we saw the wiki leaks in which they pointed out my involvement in the recount
[2:48:19.660 --> 2:48:23.180]  And that I was now with trump and that that was a problem
[2:48:23.660 --> 2:48:26.780]  Uh, I don't need to tell you that david brock
[2:48:27.500 --> 2:48:30.860]  Uh, and media matters for america and george soros
[2:48:31.580 --> 2:48:35.340]  God knows what they spent 30 40 50 million dollars
[2:48:35.340 --> 2:48:40.220]  Attacking me relentlessly from everything for the color of my socks
[2:48:40.700 --> 2:48:43.180]  Uh, two things I allegedly said
[2:48:43.660 --> 2:48:47.980]  You can still go on twitter now and you see their mindless bots cranking it out
[2:48:48.380 --> 2:48:51.420]  Stone knew everything in advance stone in manifort
[2:48:51.900 --> 2:48:57.420]  And some guy named page who i've never heard of worked for the russians met with the russians
[2:48:57.820 --> 2:49:01.020]  Then I could say privately when we've talked about assange
[2:49:01.020 --> 2:49:06.380]  All media tries to get ahold of him. You're like, I've got a contact. It's you know, someone that knows him
[2:49:06.860 --> 2:49:11.340]  You know as a journalist. I'm trying to you know, you know get info to him or get info
[2:49:11.660 --> 2:49:15.900]  I mean, that's what everybody tries to do with assange. I mean every news agency out there does what you do
[2:49:16.220 --> 2:49:21.660]  I mean, this is just crazy. Yeah, no my trying to find out what assange was up to is part of my
[2:49:22.140 --> 2:49:25.260]  you know journalistic and and uh, uh and
[2:49:25.820 --> 2:49:28.860]  Sure, who wasn't asking what assange was going to release next?
[2:49:28.860 --> 2:49:39.020]  But uh, this most recent attack on trump the fabricated memo the claim that he was entertained by prostitutes
[2:49:39.580 --> 2:49:41.580]  Uh in moscow
[2:49:41.740 --> 2:49:43.020]  I know
[2:49:43.020 --> 2:49:45.020]  For an absolute fact
[2:49:45.180 --> 2:49:50.940]  From one of the uh, trusted uh, and loyal and really outstanding
[2:49:51.500 --> 2:49:54.060]  Security people who works for donald trump
[2:49:54.060 --> 2:50:01.420]  This man is a is a decorated police officer in his prior career and a man of enormous integrity
[2:50:01.980 --> 2:50:03.980]  Told me that the
[2:50:04.380 --> 2:50:10.860]  One of the contacts that was kind of assigned as a walker for trump who they believed worked for the government
[2:50:11.340 --> 2:50:17.500]  Uh told the security guard that he would send a couple of ladies up to the room for mr. Trump's enjoyment
[2:50:17.900 --> 2:50:19.900]  Later in the evening after the program
[2:50:19.900 --> 2:50:24.620]  Uh, and this security guard said the hell you will you will not do that
[2:50:24.860 --> 2:50:28.780]  You will send nobody to mr. Trump's room. He is not interested
[2:50:29.180 --> 2:50:33.260]  Now, I also know that there were security guards posted outside
[2:50:33.660 --> 2:50:40.300]  Donald's door and at the front and the rear of the hotel to be certain that there would be no illicit effort
[2:50:40.700 --> 2:50:46.700]  To do this donald trump as he said himself in his press conference alex far too savvy
[2:50:46.700 --> 2:50:50.940]  Well, I mean, I mean listen listen part you you're out of the political event
[2:50:51.340 --> 2:50:55.580]  And a guy shows up with hot chicks and says here they are it's happened to me
[2:50:55.900 --> 2:51:02.300]  You're being set up donald trump's all about being in control. He would never do something like that
[2:51:02.460 --> 2:51:06.700]  This is so insane. You own a business. You own a company. You run a major operation
[2:51:06.940 --> 2:51:12.860]  You would be around 10 minutes if you were having hookers pee on you then let's expand on this
[2:51:12.860 --> 2:51:16.140]  I don't look into personal stuff, but you know trump really well. You you
[2:51:16.860 --> 2:51:21.660]  This friend he's at you at your wedding. You're at his parents funeral got photos. In fact, let's pull some of those up
[2:51:21.820 --> 2:51:24.380]  You know you had well a trumpet your wedding
[2:51:25.180 --> 2:51:32.220]  This is crazy. He's a germaphobe. Let's just be honest. Let's just talk about it. This is the biggest load of crap ever produced
[2:51:32.780 --> 2:51:39.420]  Yeah, look, he's a fastidious guy. He would never put himself into that position. He is way too private and way too savvy
[2:51:39.420 --> 2:51:47.340]  He is a family man. He is very happily married. He's dedicated to his young son baron and his family
[2:51:47.900 --> 2:51:51.660]  Uh, did he have his playboy days? You bet. He was single
[2:51:52.140 --> 2:51:55.100]  Uh, and he was a billionaire and he was in new york city
[2:51:55.660 --> 2:51:59.660]  Uh, so uh, look, i'm proud to be his friend. These attacks on me
[2:52:00.380 --> 2:52:07.660]  Relate to my support for him now. Let's go to the question of who uh would try to stop my book
[2:52:07.660 --> 2:52:11.580]  Who doesn't want me to testify in upcoming hearings?
[2:52:12.220 --> 2:52:17.820]  Uh, I reject the idea that this is the clintons. They would probably like to kill me, but I don't think it is them
[2:52:18.460 --> 2:52:23.580]  I also don't think that there's any reason whatsoever for the russians to want to whack me
[2:52:24.220 --> 2:52:29.820]  There's nothing to cover up or hide or bury. I do not work for them. I have never worked for them
[2:52:30.220 --> 2:52:36.380]  I have no russian contacts. I have no russian money. I have no russian clients. I have no russian influences
[2:52:36.380 --> 2:52:41.980]  I am an anti-communist. That's how I got into politics. I hate their system. It's still
[2:52:43.100 --> 2:52:47.900]  Totalitarianism, but that doesn't mean I want world war three with them
[2:52:48.700 --> 2:52:52.140]  They have nuclear weapons. They have biological weapons
[2:52:53.100 --> 2:52:55.900]  Putin is a kgb killer
[2:52:56.860 --> 2:52:59.420]  But I it still doesn't mean that I want to commit
[2:53:00.700 --> 2:53:03.580]  us lives and borrowed us dollars
[2:53:04.140 --> 2:53:05.260]  to a
[2:53:05.260 --> 2:53:07.100]  war in
[2:53:07.100 --> 2:53:08.700]  over syria
[2:53:08.700 --> 2:53:10.700]  uh, where neither Assad
[2:53:11.500 --> 2:53:13.500]  propping up hezbollah and worse
[2:53:14.220 --> 2:53:16.700]  and backed up by the russians or isis
[2:53:17.260 --> 2:53:19.260]  backed up by the saudis
[2:53:19.580 --> 2:53:23.740]  Not our friends. Uh, we have no stake here a no fly zone
[2:53:24.380 --> 2:53:29.100]  Uh in syria. I gotta hand it to you. I mean I also looked this up when you told me about it was in the news at the time
[2:53:29.180 --> 2:53:30.220]  It's it's been out there
[2:53:30.220 --> 2:53:33.740]  You actually had russian agents back when you were in the reg administration approached you
[2:53:33.740 --> 2:53:39.260]  You went call the fbi. They rolled him up. So everybody knows you're a patriotic citizen
[2:53:39.820 --> 2:53:44.380]  Now we've got maxine waters running around saying that trump. In fact, let's cue that up if we can
[2:53:45.420 --> 2:53:47.660]  Literally gets gets his orders
[2:53:48.620 --> 2:53:50.620]  from
[2:53:50.620 --> 2:53:56.380]  The kremlin from putin directly. I mean, they're now hitting levels that are so comical
[2:53:57.020 --> 2:54:00.940]  It'd be funny if it wasn't so serious. Do they believe this crap? Here it is
[2:54:00.940 --> 2:54:08.380]  And if we find out that somebody on behalf of donald trump was on the phone or an email relations with somebody in russia
[2:54:08.380 --> 2:54:13.660]  Or the america the ambassador to america from russia and there was some sort of as you call it collusion
[2:54:14.060 --> 2:54:18.540]  Then what does that make trump subject to impeachment? What do you mean by not legitimate?
[2:54:18.860 --> 2:54:20.860]  Just generally what you mean by the term
[2:54:21.100 --> 2:54:24.540]  Well, here's what out there was a connection. There was collusion your term
[2:54:25.020 --> 2:54:28.140]  Well, here's what i'm trying to get to if we discover
[2:54:28.140 --> 2:54:34.620]  That donald trump are his advocates played a role in helping to devise strategy
[2:54:35.100 --> 2:54:37.900]  If they're the ones who came up with crooked hillary
[2:54:38.300 --> 2:54:44.700]  If they're the ones who came up with she's ill something's wrong with her energy and the way that he
[2:54:45.340 --> 2:54:52.700]  Basically, you know described her in the campaign. I think that is that's enough something that i don't know who's more doddering
[2:54:52.700 --> 2:54:58.060]  That nothing against old women, but what this is like obscene crazy old arrogant corrupt women
[2:54:58.060 --> 2:55:03.020]  I mean her and ancy polosi in the whole ethics investigations are two of the most corrupt in my view
[2:55:03.420 --> 2:55:08.220]  Just filthy horrible career politician limousine liberal race pimp
[2:55:09.500 --> 2:55:14.940]  Harpies and it goes on and on it's like five minutes long. It's up on inforce.com. It's it's incredible
[2:55:16.220 --> 2:55:17.660]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:55:17.660 --> 2:55:25.340]  You have to understand the russians now feed trump directly everything and if if the russians even said something to trump
[2:55:25.420 --> 2:55:31.020]  He should have to step down because the russians are all powerful and now you can see it roger correct me if i'm wrong laying this out
[2:55:32.220 --> 2:55:36.380]  There's no evidence whatsoever of the communication. So the the
[2:55:37.020 --> 2:55:41.740]  Outrageous hold on i've got a question, but i got to get it from yes, putin. What do i say, uh roger
[2:55:42.220 --> 2:55:45.660]  Let's get into why they'd want to blame the russians. Yes. Yes comrade. I'm sorry
[2:55:45.660 --> 2:55:49.260]  No, no, seriously, let's talk about this briefly and then you're gonna be hosting the next hour
[2:55:49.340 --> 2:55:51.660]  So hope to host some will you but on end of the time roger
[2:55:52.220 --> 2:55:57.740]  Let's talk about polonium. I mean you're not talking about yourself here. This is so rare only state sponsors
[2:55:58.220 --> 2:56:03.180]  Can create this what is the message that's being sent? It's clear get you out of the committing harry's
[2:56:04.380 --> 2:56:09.500]  It's so clear get out of the kill my bro. Let's kill you get rid of you and then think the public's so dumb go look
[2:56:09.900 --> 2:56:12.780]  They they they they poison their other spy
[2:56:12.780 --> 2:56:17.180]  I lift an inco and now they've gotten rid of their other spy before he could testify
[2:56:17.580 --> 2:56:22.460]  They think the public's that dumb i'm telling you that's why they did this and i'll tell you
[2:56:22.540 --> 2:56:25.580]  I think hillary and i think the globalists are the main suspects
[2:56:25.900 --> 2:56:28.860]  Go ahead. Well, i alex. I have to tell you like craig murray
[2:56:29.980 --> 2:56:35.900]  like, uh, uh, steve pacinic like, uh, and crusading journalists like
[2:56:35.900 --> 2:56:42.300]  Glenn greenwald who is not a conservative who is not a trump fan by any means
[2:56:42.620 --> 2:56:48.780]  But who has shed light on this in a way that the new york times and the washington post have not
[2:56:49.500 --> 2:56:54.220]  Uh, i'm a whistleblower and perhaps i'm a threat, but this isn't about me
[2:56:55.020 --> 2:56:59.340]  This is about stopping the trump agenda now. I was on
[2:57:00.300 --> 2:57:01.820]  with bill marh
[2:57:01.820 --> 2:57:07.020]  Uh, and malik maxine waters was a guest on that show. She's a very nice lady
[2:57:07.980 --> 2:57:10.620]  When she came out and said the bushes in the clinton's
[2:57:11.100 --> 2:57:13.100]  Trafficked cocaine through mina
[2:57:13.660 --> 2:57:17.820]  The left wing said, oh, she's just a crazy, you know bat shit crazy old lady
[2:57:18.300 --> 2:57:19.180]  but
[2:57:19.180 --> 2:57:22.140]  Her supposition here is way out of line
[2:57:22.700 --> 2:57:26.140]  Donald trump came up with crooked hillary how?
[2:57:26.140 --> 2:57:32.060]  He's he's familiar with her record. Donald trump came up with his strategy
[2:57:32.380 --> 2:57:36.380]  Donald trump coined the slogan make america great again
[2:57:36.780 --> 2:57:40.780]  Donald trump is the is the master of his own agenda
[2:57:40.940 --> 2:57:42.380]  Well, that's another joke
[2:57:42.380 --> 2:57:47.580]  So russians want to make us great have more guns control our borders and cut our taxes
[2:57:47.900 --> 2:57:51.980]  Man then sign me up be a russian spy then this is so ridiculous
[2:57:51.980 --> 2:57:56.940]  So, uh, so I have to presume that uh that these upcoming hearings, perhaps
[2:57:57.500 --> 2:58:00.700]  They think my testimony would be problematic
[2:58:01.180 --> 2:58:09.420]  I would blow the whistle on this whole bogus russian narrative that they just won't let go of now john lewis
[2:58:10.940 --> 2:58:12.780]  John lewis hold on hold on stay there
[2:58:12.780 --> 2:58:17.100]  You've got the whole hour coming up and and I can do five minutes with you 10 minutes with you 20
[2:58:17.100 --> 2:58:20.860]  Or I can punch out and let you take over tell me during the break, but roger normally hosts
[2:58:20.860 --> 2:58:24.620]  On tuesdays sometimes wednesdays in the fourth hour
[2:58:24.620 --> 2:58:29.660]  So roger stones coming up here on the alex jones show and soon we're going to cut liners for all the other hosts
[2:58:29.660 --> 2:58:33.020]  So it can be their show when they're doing and they'll just move to the hour after that
[2:58:33.420 --> 2:58:38.060]  But it's a very very exciting time to be alive folks and this guy's a hero for this republic
[2:58:38.060 --> 2:58:44.300]  He's been targeted by globalists. This is sensational. The media's gonna have a lot of trouble ignoring this. This is they didn't get him
[2:58:45.660 --> 2:58:50.460]  They didn't hit him with five shots and they still didn't get him. That's bad luck for them national defense
[2:58:50.460 --> 2:58:51.660]  labs and
[2:58:51.660 --> 2:59:00.220]  Citizen armor has given info wars the exclusive on distributing to the american people the true next generation in body armor
[2:59:00.380 --> 2:59:06.220]  Basically what we're bringing to the info wars team is a new line of dynamic
[2:59:06.780 --> 2:59:08.060]  lightweight body armor
[2:59:08.060 --> 2:59:14.060]  It is lighter more flexible easier to wear more comfortable and stronger than anything else on the market
[2:59:14.140 --> 2:59:19.020]  You show when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing for years people that currently are testing for us
[2:59:19.020 --> 2:59:21.340]  They didn't just say outstanding and what they really say about them
[2:59:21.340 --> 2:59:27.740]  They want to know how do they get it? Where do they find it? A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing
[2:59:27.900 --> 2:59:33.580]  The backpack body armor is only two hundred dollars. I mean, it's unbelievable. It's a quarter inch thick
[2:59:33.660 --> 2:59:38.300]  It's got a 20 year warranty is waterproof. You can wear it. It's comfortable and we shot everything you can imagine
[2:59:38.700 --> 2:59:43.900]  Again, fund the info or get the game changing in nano tech tubes gets a win win
[2:59:43.900 --> 2:59:49.100]  200 dollars go check out all their different products the forestore.com. It's amazing
[2:59:52.060 --> 2:59:54.700]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:02.940 --> 3:00:07.100]  We are on the march the empire is on the run
[3:00:07.100 --> 3:00:14.300]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:00:23.900 --> 3:00:28.940]  Okay, so roger stone is a humble guy and i've gotten to know him really good in the last two years
[3:00:29.500 --> 3:00:31.500]  Everything he's told me has been dead on
[3:00:32.220 --> 3:00:35.340]  and he really has a lot of savvy for understanding and and
[3:00:35.340 --> 3:00:37.580]  And thin slicing the larger picture
[3:00:38.620 --> 3:00:45.260]  And the establishment really hates his guts. In fact, it's admitted that they got him banned off fox cnn msnbc
[3:00:45.260 --> 3:00:47.260]  That was in the news. He's been banned
[3:00:49.500 --> 3:00:53.980]  And now they tried to ban him off the internet and now they're using his name and my name and matt roger's name
[3:00:54.460 --> 3:00:58.780]  Talking about banning fake news off the web and they actually have brian williams
[3:00:59.580 --> 3:01:03.340]  The mogul or the guru of fake news calling for it
[3:01:03.340 --> 3:01:09.500]  And then fake actors playing fake newscasters steven cobert calling for us to be banned
[3:01:10.300 --> 3:01:15.820]  So the deep states calling for us to be banned. We're under attack trying to rest america away from globalist
[3:01:16.540 --> 3:01:22.220]  They're saying, you know somebody's to do something about roger stone the clintons have this long history of of killing people
[3:01:22.540 --> 3:01:24.540]  Or or their minions doing it
[3:01:25.500 --> 3:01:30.140]  This is a short segment long segment coming up and i'm gonna hand things over to you at about 15 after but roger
[3:01:30.140 --> 3:01:33.820]  I know you don't like to speculate, but i mean you've been sitting there. You've known about this for weeks
[3:01:34.300 --> 3:01:38.860]  Polonium poisoning. It's big. Let's talk about you. Let's talk about why you're
[3:01:39.340 --> 3:01:43.100]  I mean, i'm not trying to put you down. I mean, I can physically see that you've been sick
[3:01:43.260 --> 3:01:45.740]  We've seen the photos what it did to you. I mean
[3:01:46.780 --> 3:01:49.580]  It really hit you hard and I know it has long-term effects
[3:01:50.380 --> 3:01:52.380]  Just other points on polonium
[3:01:53.180 --> 3:01:54.620]  well, look
[3:01:54.620 --> 3:02:00.940]  We get down to the fundamental question of who would have done this and why and I come back to the deep state
[3:02:00.940 --> 3:02:05.180]  I come back to to our own people the russians have no motive
[3:02:05.820 --> 3:02:07.820]  To kill me they have nothing
[3:02:08.220 --> 3:02:15.180]  To hide or cover as far as I am concerned and I am not aware of and I any contact between the russians
[3:02:15.980 --> 3:02:18.220]  in my colleague of many years paul manifor
[3:02:18.940 --> 3:02:21.180]  and the entire canard about
[3:02:21.180 --> 3:02:29.180]  His activities in the ukraine and he's taking a 12 million payment $100 million payment politico has recently reported
[3:02:30.140 --> 3:02:34.540]  Ken vogel specifically that that is now thought to have been bogus
[3:02:35.100 --> 3:02:38.940]  And it was a fake handwritten ledger. They fell on the side of the street. I mean give me a break
[3:02:38.940 --> 3:02:44.540]  It was manufactured by ukrainian intelligence in an effort to undermine. Do now have been caught
[3:02:45.180 --> 3:02:47.180]  campaigning and giving money to hillary
[3:02:47.180 --> 3:02:54.380]  So, uh, so this is uh, this is part and parcel of of a greater effort
[3:02:54.940 --> 3:02:56.940]  to destabilize
[3:02:57.020 --> 3:02:57.980]  uh
[3:02:57.980 --> 3:03:01.900]  President trump as he tries to bring drastic change
[3:03:02.780 --> 3:03:10.860]  Uh, there was an excellent report on wbai in new york a progressive station about trump's comments regarding reforming the cia
[3:03:11.340 --> 3:03:15.580]  Cutting the number of agents at langley building a system
[3:03:15.580 --> 3:03:18.860]  That is uh, that is more responsive
[3:03:19.420 --> 3:03:22.940]  The cia has been associated with some of the greatest atrocities
[3:03:23.580 --> 3:03:25.100]  Uh and lies
[3:03:25.100 --> 3:03:29.340]  Of the last four years and they're famous for poisoning people. So you're clearly saying
[3:03:30.060 --> 3:03:34.620]  Rogue elements of that are obviously, uh, suspect. They've been in the news
[3:03:35.740 --> 3:03:41.260]  Warning trump and the associated press and roiders the new york observer of all places is his son-in-law's paper
[3:03:41.260 --> 3:03:48.060]  You better watch it the intelligence agency can do things to you. Well, then if you've been good buddies with him for 41 years
[3:03:48.460 --> 3:03:52.460]  Then I think that's a message of trump. Isn't this really a message to donald trump?
[3:03:53.100 --> 3:03:55.100]  well, alex people who will
[3:03:55.580 --> 3:04:04.540]  Torture people illegally and then lie about it will of course poison people people who will will cover up ben gazi
[3:04:04.540 --> 3:04:10.940]  People who uh lied about iran contra people who lied about vietnam
[3:04:11.420 --> 3:04:14.620]  People who lied about the kennedy assassination
[3:04:15.740 --> 3:04:18.780]  People who lied about the iraq war
[3:04:19.420 --> 3:04:24.460]  These people will do anything to cover their record of malfeasance
[3:04:25.180 --> 3:04:28.380]  And the idea that cia director john brennan
[3:04:28.380 --> 3:04:36.380]  A man who fused to be sworn on the bible when sworn in a man with a long history of activity in the u.s
[3:04:36.860 --> 3:04:38.860]  Communist party the known jihadi
[3:04:39.260 --> 3:04:42.700]  Who insists that there is no connection between terrorism and islam?
[3:04:43.420 --> 3:04:48.620]  Telling donald trump. You better watch your mouth. You better watch what you say. Yeah, you better watch his mouth
[3:04:48.780 --> 3:04:54.220]  We'll be right back. Stay stay there. Stay there. I'm gonna come back and talk about this roger stone's about to take over and host
[3:04:54.620 --> 3:04:56.460]  Hit with polonium
[3:04:56.460 --> 3:04:58.780]  Oh, yeah, it's more than m4. They took the gloves off
[3:04:59.580 --> 3:05:05.580]  Nobody loves barack obama more than barack obama in his speech during the chicago cup's world series visit to the white house
[3:05:05.660 --> 3:05:10.460]  He referred to himself a humble 40 times in his farewell address one of his many farewells

[3:05:23.420 --> 3:05:28.380]  Not once referencing himself as one to blame after a mass shooting in organ in a 12 minute speech
[3:05:28.380 --> 3:05:35.180]  He referenced himself 28 times at the democratic national convention obama referred to himself a whopping 119 times
[3:05:35.260 --> 3:05:39.180]  Some attendees were confused and thought he was running again when speaking in india last year
[3:05:39.180 --> 3:05:46.940]  He referred to himself 118 times. It's an international love fest in a speech on jobs in ohio in 2010 barack referenced himself
[3:05:47.500 --> 3:05:48.700]  132 times
[3:05:48.700 --> 3:05:54.060]  But i want you to i want you to understand this is not about me and every morning

[3:09:53.180 --> 3:10:00.060]  They're sniveling soros operatives democrats meaning who look like villains out of the warriors movie
[3:10:00.860 --> 3:10:02.860]  Come out and play
[3:10:02.940 --> 3:10:04.620]  well, yes
[3:10:04.620 --> 3:10:09.820]  I mean you you couldn't get these dirt balls out of central casting talking about acid attack
[3:10:09.820 --> 3:10:15.980]  Which by the ways terrorism because it will cause people to stampede and die
[3:10:19.180 --> 3:10:21.180]  And then you've got
[3:10:21.820 --> 3:10:29.900]  People out hiring for $2,500 for two days work to go be soros operatives to quote shut down the inauguration
[3:10:30.220 --> 3:10:34.140]  And block roads barricades and burn stuff. Let me explain something
[3:10:35.020 --> 3:10:38.060]  I I don't like these tactics. I would use these tactics. So
[3:10:38.060 --> 3:10:44.700]  I'm not saying. Oh, I'd do this if I wouldn't get in trouble the point is if I called for people to burn things
[3:10:45.340 --> 3:10:52.700]  And to have barricades into attack police. I would be arrested because that's not free speech. That's calling for civil insurrection
[3:10:54.460 --> 3:10:57.740]  I have to sit here and watch the entire msm the dinosaur media
[3:11:00.220 --> 3:11:02.220]  Call for insurrection
[3:11:02.220 --> 3:11:06.860]  And call for my head and roger's head. I mean, I am a
[3:11:07.820 --> 3:11:10.220]  kinsman or or or you could say a
[3:11:10.780 --> 3:11:16.540]  Someone who is a fellow traveler to take the leftist term with donald trump because I get to experience the demonization
[3:11:16.780 --> 3:11:23.340]  I get to experience the death threats. I get to experience the lies the cornucopia of disinformation and rotten
[3:11:23.900 --> 3:11:27.980]  Fetted trash that comes out of their stinking mall
[3:11:27.980 --> 3:11:30.540]  Stinking mall
[3:11:31.020 --> 3:11:37.500]  I spend my life trying to really discover the truth and tell it they spend their life in fantasy land claiming
[3:11:37.500 --> 3:11:40.060]  I'm a russian agent stones a russian agent
[3:11:40.140 --> 3:11:44.860]  Trump's a russian agent and we can't come up with the term when we're looking at a big fat ugly
[3:11:45.660 --> 3:11:48.300]  demonic pig and call hillary a stinking pig
[3:11:48.940 --> 3:11:52.780]  The russians didn't tell me she's a big demonic stinking corrupt pig
[3:11:52.780 --> 3:11:57.500]  She's a stinking pig. She's a stinking corrupt hillary
[3:11:58.140 --> 3:12:00.140]  And so is Nancy Pelosi
[3:12:01.020 --> 3:12:08.780]  What is up with all these arrogant weirdo harpies women in business suits thinking they can dominate everybody and call us russian agents
[3:12:08.860 --> 3:12:11.260]  And we're not gonna strike back take john louis. He got interrupted earlier
[3:12:11.340 --> 3:12:15.260]  I want to hear about cars with john louis comes out and says trump you're a russian agent
[3:12:15.500 --> 3:12:21.020]  You didn't get elected forget the voters. None of you count. You're not legitimate. We should boycott it. He should be impeached
[3:12:21.020 --> 3:12:23.180]  Trump says I really like to work with you more
[3:12:23.820 --> 3:12:27.820]  It's unfortunate that you're not helping people in your own area that are having massive unemployment
[3:12:28.220 --> 3:12:32.300]  Oh my gosh. He was mean to an icon of civil rights. He's racist
[3:12:32.540 --> 3:12:36.620]  I was in the airport this morning and yesterday and it was just newspapers everywhere
[3:12:36.940 --> 3:12:41.180]  Trump racist attacks civil rights icon on martin loser king day
[3:12:43.020 --> 3:12:48.700]  You're a russian agent. You're illegitimate. I'd like to work with you. Hey, call me. Yeah, racist
[3:12:48.700 --> 3:12:50.700]  Oh, I mean

[3:13:13.180 --> 3:13:18.860]  Supermail vitality brain force

[3:13:46.700 --> 3:13:52.060]  Or a maxine waters that trump comes up with his own ideas or roger stone does because these are dumb ass hacks
[3:13:52.540 --> 3:13:56.380]  Just like the political guy that said I'm a hack. I'm a fraud. I'll lie. They're like, oh, oh, oh, oh

[3:14:49.100 --> 3:14:54.860]  Till it actually comes out. I'm sorry, but which is fine. It's got to go to number one on the new york times because here's the deal
[3:14:55.100 --> 3:14:59.420]  Stoned during the breaks like I don't want to make this about me. Okay. I got it with polonium and we stopped talking about it
[3:14:59.420 --> 3:15:02.780]  I want to talk about issues and I'm like stone
[3:15:03.580 --> 3:15:06.540]  You're a hero that you survived you've gone through all this hell
[3:15:06.620 --> 3:15:11.420]  We have to make a big deal out of this they're freaking tried to kill you if we don't make a big deal out of it
[3:15:11.420 --> 3:15:16.220]  None of us are safe every journalist in the world ought to be flocking to this guy's support
[3:15:17.500 --> 3:15:20.380]  You understand the crap we go through and I'm not bitching
[3:15:20.700 --> 3:15:25.420]  I'm just saying the bad guys are after us because we're hurting them and we're hurting them bad
[3:15:25.420 --> 3:15:29.820]  And so roger you say don't want to get into yourself. You don't talk about yourself. This is big
[3:15:29.820 --> 3:15:33.500]  You got poisoned with polonium. So you couldn't testify the motives clear
[3:15:33.580 --> 3:15:38.700]  They want to blame the Russians just like they did with alexander live an inco that came out that was british intelligence
[3:15:38.860 --> 3:15:43.020]  You got british intelligence putting out these fake dossiers that trump has women pissing on him
[3:15:43.500 --> 3:15:46.700]  You know, they got this this this this deranged possum
[3:15:47.020 --> 3:15:50.140]  Gloria all red coming out with more, you know more baloney
[3:15:50.140 --> 3:15:56.780]  More fake lawsuits in my view all these other lawsuits got dropped. I mean, this is an insane time to be alive brother
[3:15:56.940 --> 3:16:01.580]  And the fact is you're a wounded soldier. You deserve a purple heart. You're tough
[3:16:01.900 --> 3:16:08.300]  I feel bad even having you on air as sick as you've been brother. So it's just incredible. So let's let's cover the waterfront
[3:16:08.300 --> 3:16:10.860]  I'm gonna skip this break. So you have more time. Let's get into louis
[3:16:11.020 --> 3:16:15.980]  Let's get into other points about who you really think's behind this and what we should do about it because we're not just
[3:16:15.980 --> 3:16:20.620]  Going to go. Okay. You got hit with polonium and move on. It's a big deal. They hit you with that
[3:16:20.700 --> 3:16:26.060]  So you couldn't testify so your book wouldn't come out and there's a warning to trump. That's the bottom line here. Go ahead
[3:16:26.780 --> 3:16:30.620]  Alex gonna be honest with you. I'm just very happy to be alive
[3:16:31.100 --> 3:16:37.260]  I have never been this sick in my life. I've never experienced this level of illness. Yeah, you don't look good
[3:16:37.820 --> 3:16:42.060]  Well, uh, thank you. You're a friend and it pisses me off, but it's called empathy. They could do this to me
[3:16:42.060 --> 3:16:47.180]  They do it to my feet. Go ahead. Alex, you know, uh, I just thank god that I'm alive
[3:16:47.820 --> 3:16:49.820]  president Nixon once told me
[3:16:50.380 --> 3:16:52.380]  Don't pray to god when it's raining
[3:16:53.260 --> 3:16:55.500]  If you don't pray when the sun is out
[3:16:56.300 --> 3:16:58.620]  Uh, and laying in that bed drenched in sweat
[3:16:59.420 --> 3:17:04.940]  Uh, and you know out of my mind, uh, I did pray and I and I'm gonna be also honest
[3:17:05.660 --> 3:17:08.700]  They think that I may have self saved myself
[3:17:09.420 --> 3:17:10.860]  because uh
[3:17:10.860 --> 3:17:13.980]  I did take a bunch of supplements before I knew
[3:17:14.540 --> 3:17:16.540]  What was wrong with me?
[3:17:16.540 --> 3:17:21.820]  liver cleanse was among them your liver defense product your dna product
[3:17:22.220 --> 3:17:26.780]  I wanted to flush my system. I drank a gallon of distilled water
[3:17:27.260 --> 3:17:35.100]  Uh with liver shield, pardon me, which I think flushed my system. Uh, I used the silver kaleido
[3:17:35.100 --> 3:17:41.580]  product now I had by the way, we weren't planning this so they're flashing up products as you say it dna force with about
[3:17:42.140 --> 3:17:46.140]  PQQ does flush mitochondria out. It does flush the cells
[3:17:46.700 --> 3:17:49.900]  Uh, so does the liver cleanse. Nobody should take the liver shield though
[3:17:50.140 --> 3:17:53.500]  If you're drinking on it, folks, your liver is wide open when you do it. It can really hurt you
[3:17:53.660 --> 3:17:58.220]  And this is a powerful product. I didn't even know you were going to plug this on air. Uh, are you serious?
[3:17:58.220 --> 3:18:03.580]  It really helped you well now this uh, I believe they they helped me now
[3:18:03.580 --> 3:18:09.180]  Now we know the attitude of western doctors some of them the unenlightened ones
[3:18:09.740 --> 3:18:15.740]  Towards non-pharmaceutical substances. This is one of the great problems with western medicine
[3:18:15.740 --> 3:18:19.500]  Well, I mean liver shield makes your liver take a giant crap. I mean it dumps everything else
[3:18:19.580 --> 3:18:25.020]  So if your liver's getting hit with polonium, you're supposed to detox. It makes perfect sense or or anything else
[3:18:25.420 --> 3:18:30.620]  Also, um, it will make you very angry when you take any liver product
[3:18:30.620 --> 3:18:34.060]  Everything comes up and in Chinese medicine
[3:18:34.140 --> 3:18:40.540]  Uh, it is believed that the liver is where you harbor all of your past resentments and your angers
[3:18:41.100 --> 3:18:47.020]  Uh, and so you'll go through an emotional roller coaster as your system just flushes all the crap
[3:18:47.020 --> 3:18:49.900]  Well, sure the toxins are coming out and going out, you know through your through your
[3:18:50.380 --> 3:18:57.420]  You know what you're releasing exactly that the one particularly, uh, bright doctor at mount sinai said that
[3:18:57.420 --> 3:19:04.460]  There is after some study and some investigation that there is some evidence that if there is
[3:19:05.020 --> 3:19:10.460]  Fat in your system if you have a full stomach at the time that you absorb poisons
[3:19:11.020 --> 3:19:17.420]  Uh, that the fat can leach the poison out of your system and you will and you will now I had an enormous stake
[3:19:17.980 --> 3:19:19.980]  Two days before I was sick
[3:19:20.860 --> 3:19:24.060]  Uh, yes, I'm a conservative. I eat red meat
[3:19:24.060 --> 3:19:28.460]  I eat virtually raw. I like it and I'm going to keep eating it
[3:19:29.020 --> 3:19:34.460]  But, uh, that may also have been beneficial. So let's talk about the dose because there's a media
[3:19:34.620 --> 3:19:38.620]  I mean, obviously is going to try to spin this or whatever or probably try to ignore it. It's so powerful
[3:19:38.940 --> 3:19:43.260]  I mean, this is huge. What does this signify? Whoever did this? Obviously, it's globalist
[3:19:43.580 --> 3:19:47.180]  Because I mean the motives are all there kibono who benefits. Why would they do this?
[3:19:47.820 --> 3:19:53.500]  Well, that nobody wants me to testify before their phony congressional investigation
[3:19:53.500 --> 3:19:56.940]  Because I will put the lie to this whole Russian
[3:19:57.500 --> 3:20:03.420]  Canard that they are so the the the deep state and the intelligence agencies are so desperate
[3:20:03.820 --> 3:20:07.340]  They won't drop this theme now. I point out to you Alex
[3:20:07.740 --> 3:20:11.740]  It was a talking point for hillary's talking heads before the election
[3:20:12.780 --> 3:20:20.060]  F the cia director brennan warned of russian hacking before it happens. Hold on. This gets worse. This gets worse. New york post
[3:20:20.060 --> 3:20:23.820]  The mi6 guy worked with the murdered
[3:20:24.780 --> 3:20:27.020]  Levin eco guy that got hit with polonium
[3:20:27.340 --> 3:20:33.580]  I was already connecting the two holy Toledo daily mail out is the man behind the dirty dossier of donald trump
[3:20:33.660 --> 3:20:37.340]  Which they admit is now fake worked with the double triple agent
[3:20:37.500 --> 3:20:41.980]  I remember at the time it came out that experts believed that there was no reason for russia to kill this guy
[3:20:42.140 --> 3:20:45.180]  That it was done to embarrass russia. This is crazy
[3:20:45.180 --> 3:20:52.700]  Well, and it look it occurs to me that the people who created that document
[3:20:53.580 --> 3:20:56.700]  Should be ashamed of themselves. Look at that guy. He thinks he's so freaking smart
[3:20:56.780 --> 3:21:01.580]  Well, if 007 thinks he's so damn smart wants to be taken seriously. He might learn how to spell
[3:21:02.540 --> 3:21:08.780]  Their dossier is rife with misspellage. It was not even but it wasn't even good for ass wiping
[3:21:08.780 --> 3:21:15.500]  So the idea that that james clapper, uh, and the boys down at langley would include this
[3:21:16.140 --> 3:21:21.260]  Uh in a report to president obama and president trump. This is a vile
[3:21:22.300 --> 3:21:25.420]  fraud this is by the way, i'm told by three sources
[3:21:26.300 --> 3:21:31.820]  Low-level mid-level and high-level in the cia that the whole agency hates the globalist wants america to be great
[3:21:32.060 --> 3:21:35.580]  They hate hillary. They hate it all they say and i was told this weeks ago
[3:21:35.580 --> 3:21:40.780]  This is all farmed out to subgroups pr firms as later came out. I forgot how accurate their info was
[3:21:40.940 --> 3:21:43.100]  It's all completely fake. So it isn't even the cia
[3:21:43.740 --> 3:21:47.180]  The cia doesn't like this. I think that's why the globalists are in so much trouble
[3:21:47.340 --> 3:21:49.340]  Their own agencies have turned against them
[3:21:49.820 --> 3:21:51.820]  Well, and it would be
[3:21:51.900 --> 3:21:57.020]  Outrageously unfair to say that everybody who works for the central intelligent intelligence agency
[3:21:57.820 --> 3:22:02.540]  Is in league with globalist agenda. No, there are patriotic americans that work there
[3:22:02.540 --> 3:22:09.180]  Just as there are many many many non political patriotic americans work for the fbi
[3:22:09.820 --> 3:22:15.180]  But the leadership of these agencies are rotten to the core. They are corrupt and by the way
[3:22:15.580 --> 3:22:18.620]  Let's elaborate on this. I don't know how much you can tell the back story
[3:22:19.420 --> 3:22:21.100]  um
[3:22:21.100 --> 3:22:23.100]  Well, i don't i mean obviously
[3:22:23.420 --> 3:22:26.940]  Can we discuss whether the president knows about this president elect?
[3:22:26.940 --> 3:22:31.500]  Can we i have i've not discussed this with the president elect and i'm i'm not going to burden him with it
[3:22:31.500 --> 3:22:33.500]  I know you told me that a week ago. I said you gotta tell him
[3:22:33.740 --> 3:22:37.180]  Look if his if his one of his good friends is being poisoned. He goes to your wedding and stuff
[3:22:37.260 --> 3:22:41.500]  You've been friends for 41 years. You might want to tell him. Well, I'm sure someone will tell him
[3:22:41.580 --> 3:22:47.900]  But frankly, I'm not going to bother uh the president elect at a time that he is thinking about the supreme court
[3:22:48.380 --> 3:22:53.020]  Where he is uh duking it out with the intelligence agencies who are
[3:22:53.660 --> 3:22:55.660]  Determined to take him down
[3:22:56.380 --> 3:23:00.860]  Uh, you know, this is this is not really about me. I'm glad to be alive
[3:23:00.860 --> 3:23:05.740]  But this is about the anti-globalist revolution, but it does show they're taking the gloves off
[3:23:06.060 --> 3:23:09.420]  Yeah, so what's going to happen some in the mainstream media
[3:23:09.900 --> 3:23:16.140]  And the assholes at media matters for america and correct the record money laundering fronts
[3:23:16.860 --> 3:23:18.860]  professional liars and
[3:23:19.420 --> 3:23:23.020]  Propagandists are going to make light of this and say it's a joke
[3:23:23.500 --> 3:23:28.060]  If you were as sick as I was you would know it's well, you also got visited by the feds
[3:23:28.060 --> 3:23:32.940]  Can you get into that? Well, I have let the government know what I know
[3:23:33.580 --> 3:23:37.180]  Uh, and you know, there's a series of intelligent questions here
[3:23:37.980 --> 3:23:41.420]  Did I eat or drink with any foreign nationals or strangers?
[3:23:41.980 --> 3:23:46.860]  In the in the days and weeks before I was sick. I couldn't connect the dots on that
[3:23:47.260 --> 3:23:51.740]  I don't know how I may have ingested poison. I am
[3:23:51.740 --> 3:23:59.900]  I am thankful that I didn't ingest enough to kill me. I had fevers that were problematic
[3:24:00.540 --> 3:24:02.540]  For 15 days
[3:24:02.860 --> 3:24:06.940]  This is not a great experience and I don't recommend it for weight loss
[3:24:07.420 --> 3:24:13.980]  But as you can see my collars are large on me. I lost I don't know seven pounds
[3:24:14.700 --> 3:24:19.740]  Uh, this was this was not a great experience, but I am committed
[3:24:19.740 --> 3:24:21.740]  Uh to
[3:24:22.140 --> 3:24:24.140]  busting the lies
[3:24:24.140 --> 3:24:30.140]  About the russian hacking my book does that with an enormous amount of new information
[3:24:30.540 --> 3:24:34.300]  Exactly. Oh and by the way, I well became in here during the break and corrected me
[3:24:34.620 --> 3:24:36.140]  We are now
[3:24:36.140 --> 3:24:39.020]  Announcing presales because they weren't allowed until the day of
[3:24:39.580 --> 3:24:44.300]  Uh, which I guess is the 31st if it's still that we can now say pre-orders for your new book
[3:24:44.700 --> 3:24:47.420]  Are available the book is being printed as we speak
[3:24:47.420 --> 3:24:50.620]  Let's let's talk about your book some because you know, it's important to get out
[3:24:50.700 --> 3:24:54.860]  It's got a blueprint for victory in the future. It breaks down everything. Everyone needs to get your book
[3:24:55.820 --> 3:25:01.500]  This is this is a book about how donald trump pulled off the greatest political upset in american history
[3:25:02.300 --> 3:25:05.980]  This is this is a book about courage and balls
[3:25:06.540 --> 3:25:12.700]  Uh, and the tipping point that has finally been reached where the putrid lying
[3:25:13.420 --> 3:25:15.420]  alleged media like cnn
[3:25:15.420 --> 3:25:17.420]  the very people
[3:25:17.500 --> 3:25:20.540]  Who let ted cruz attack me viciously?
[3:25:21.260 --> 3:25:27.500]  And then would not afford me the opportunity to respond not once not twice but three times
[3:25:28.140 --> 3:25:30.140]  All i'm asking for alex
[3:25:30.700 --> 3:25:32.700]  elementary fairness
[3:25:32.700 --> 3:25:34.700]  when ted cruz
[3:25:34.700 --> 3:25:37.340]  falsely accused me of smearing him
[3:25:38.060 --> 3:25:41.980]  The folks at cbs to their credit called sent out a crew
[3:25:41.980 --> 3:25:47.580]  Tape they response and played both of them his attack on me and my response
[3:25:48.140 --> 3:25:50.300]  That's what real reporters do
[3:25:51.260 --> 3:25:53.260]  cnn allowed
[3:25:54.540 --> 3:26:02.860]  John pedesta both on the airplane uh on video and after the election to repeat again
[3:26:03.500 --> 3:26:08.380]  The lie that I knew about his hacking that I knew about russian
[3:26:08.380 --> 3:26:13.100]  He's been feeding julien assange a lie. I know no such thing
[3:26:13.980 --> 3:26:22.140]  Yet cnn never afforded me despite my requests an opportunity to respond in the same
[3:26:23.100 --> 3:26:24.220]  day part
[3:26:24.220 --> 3:26:26.220]  So if anderson cooper
[3:26:26.940 --> 3:26:32.300]  Who I confess to thinking is quite well dressed and has been on my international
[3:26:32.620 --> 3:26:34.620]  best dressed list in the past that I
[3:26:35.020 --> 3:26:37.020]  put out every
[3:26:37.020 --> 3:26:39.020]  New years
[3:26:39.020 --> 3:26:41.020]  If he had any journalistic integrity
[3:26:41.420 --> 3:26:45.660]  He's not a journalist. He's a leftist board foundation cia operative
[3:26:46.300 --> 3:26:48.300]  Well and cnn is busted
[3:26:48.860 --> 3:26:54.220]  And they are going to continue to let's expand on that and then i'm gonna let you take over but this is riveting and i don't want to
[3:26:54.220 --> 3:26:56.220]  Leave i'm going to be watching after i'm off
[3:26:56.620 --> 3:26:58.620]  Seriously, roger
[3:26:58.700 --> 3:27:02.300]  I love trump saying we're going to expand the press corps into a basically an arena
[3:27:02.460 --> 3:27:05.660]  We're going to let the real new independent media in the mainstream is
[3:27:05.660 --> 3:27:11.500]  Crapping themselves. They're imploding cnn's about to be sold off. They admit it's a shadow of itself
[3:27:12.220 --> 3:27:17.260]  And there's trump going no you don't get time to respond. You're fake news. You don't get me time to respond
[3:27:17.580 --> 3:27:20.780]  He's finally calling him out. I mean this is the beginning of the end of these people
[3:27:21.580 --> 3:27:27.100]  Alex I must tell you I have read extensively about the at&t time Warner merger
[3:27:27.740 --> 3:27:32.460]  Um, I I actually think it's not necessarily a bad deal and I don't think it violates the law
[3:27:32.460 --> 3:27:35.180]  But I wouldn't approve it unless
[3:27:35.980 --> 3:27:37.340]  Time Warner
[3:27:37.340 --> 3:27:38.780]  spun off
[3:27:38.780 --> 3:27:39.820]  cnn
[3:27:39.820 --> 3:27:44.780]  Perhaps rt would like to buy it. Maybe maybe putin will pick it up for a song
[3:27:45.420 --> 3:27:46.940]  Nobody's watching
[3:27:46.940 --> 3:27:48.940]  Their viewers are dwindling
[3:27:49.900 --> 3:27:51.900]  the the hysteria
[3:27:52.380 --> 3:27:54.140]  of last night
[3:27:54.140 --> 3:28:01.260]  Watching don lemon don what's with that not that's the that's the fattest not i've ever seen awful awful
[3:28:01.260 --> 3:28:04.860]  You you'll never make the best dress list with that
[3:28:05.500 --> 3:28:06.620]  uh
[3:28:06.620 --> 3:28:08.620]  near hysterical
[3:28:09.020 --> 3:28:14.700]  A fellow from the minority coalitions for trump did an excellent job of punching back. Sorry
[3:28:15.500 --> 3:28:18.140]  Martin looser king the third met yesterday with trump
[3:28:18.860 --> 3:28:21.580]  Mark dr. King's niece announced that she
[3:28:22.140 --> 3:28:29.020]  Voted for trump. You're not keeping black people on the plantation anymore. That's why they're panicking. What do you make?
[3:28:29.020 --> 3:28:31.020]  And then i'm gonna let you go to the show
[3:28:31.820 --> 3:28:32.700]  Of
[3:28:32.700 --> 3:28:37.900]  John lewis coming out attacking trump trump nicely responds and they say it's because he's racist
[3:28:38.300 --> 3:28:40.780]  I mean, there's there's a death of logic here
[3:28:41.500 --> 3:28:43.100]  well, alex
[3:28:43.100 --> 3:28:45.100]  This is I think a very key point
[3:28:46.060 --> 3:28:48.060]  congressman lewis
[3:28:48.140 --> 3:28:51.820]  Was an honest to god hero on the edmund pettus bridge
[3:28:52.460 --> 3:28:56.460]  Yes, he shed blood for the civil rights movement
[3:28:56.460 --> 3:28:58.460]  Nothing pisses me off
[3:28:59.500 --> 3:29:01.500]  more than when
[3:29:01.740 --> 3:29:03.260]  david brock
[3:29:03.260 --> 3:29:09.660]  Uh, and the weenies who work for them say i am a racist. I am a nixon republican
[3:29:10.300 --> 3:29:12.300]  Richard nixon
[3:29:12.300 --> 3:29:18.700]  Marshalled the votes to pass the 1958 civil rights act the democrats didn't have the numbers
[3:29:19.260 --> 3:29:21.260]  Richard nixon
[3:29:21.260 --> 3:29:23.260]  Brought us black capitalism
[3:29:23.260 --> 3:29:25.980]  Desegregated the public schools
[3:29:26.780 --> 3:29:34.460]  I was marching for a rockefeller drug law reform in new york racist drug laws targeted
[3:29:34.780 --> 3:29:39.500]  I'm gonna let you take over great job. My friend. You're a hero roger stone come back to that another side
[3:29:39.500 --> 3:29:44.620]  I'm handing baton to roger stone and we're off to dc tomorrow. This is incredible. It's great. It's good to be back
[3:29:44.700 --> 3:29:48.300]  Folks love you great job the crew roger stone coming up info wars.com
[3:29:48.940 --> 3:29:51.980]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[3:29:51.980 --> 3:29:55.580]  Alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:59.580 --> 3:30:05.100]  With the inauguration around the corner, here's what we know about the fascists who are trying to obstruct donald trump's inauguration
[3:30:05.180 --> 3:30:10.540]  Hundreds of thousands will be there to protest the inauguration of trump marching and chanting in the streets over fake news
[3:30:10.620 --> 3:30:17.740]  But it has gotten darker advertisements to pay trump protesters cropping up in dozens of us cities people like rosy mcdonald calling for
[3:30:17.740 --> 3:30:23.900]  Martial law charles schumer threatening trump with the intelligence community michael moore marching in the women's march against trump pushing
[3:30:24.140 --> 3:30:25.420]  Anti-trump false narratives
[3:30:25.420 --> 3:30:32.540]  We know about the fake dossiers and now more is emerging as radical leftists are planning violent protests plans for planting and discharging
[3:30:32.540 --> 3:30:39.420]  Acidic chemicals into ventilation systems disrupt j20 is mobilizing thousands and planning on blocking streets and transit in response
[3:30:39.420 --> 3:30:44.060]  There will be unprecedented security. We fully support the first amendment in the exercise thereof
[3:30:44.060 --> 3:30:47.660]  But people plotting illegal activities need to be brought into custody now
[3:30:47.740 --> 3:30:52.860]  Perhaps even arrested to deter these fascists from illegally disrupting the peaceful transition of power
[3:30:52.860 --> 3:30:58.700]  But something tells me that's not going to happen. This is oan shroyer and info wars will see you at the inauguration
[3:30:59.420 --> 3:31:03.260]  It's not just our water. We need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned

[3:33:00.860 --> 3:33:19.180]  From the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[3:33:54.220 --> 3:33:56.220]  Okay
[3:33:56.220 --> 3:34:07.300]  Alright. Welcome back to Info Wars. I have just taken the baton from the great Alex Jones
[3:34:07.300 --> 3:34:17.820]  looking robust and healthy after his brief vacation. I am delighted to pick up the theme
[3:34:17.820 --> 3:34:25.900]  where we left off. This constant attack that we are racists, that Trump is a racist, is
[3:34:25.900 --> 3:34:33.420]  aggravating in view of the fact that in fact I have done, I have had a career of supporting
[3:34:33.420 --> 3:34:39.700]  both civil rights and racial justice. The black voters, African American voters in this country
[3:34:39.700 --> 3:34:46.260]  have been used by the Democrats and you can see our inner cities. Trump is trying to reach
[3:34:46.260 --> 3:34:55.820]  out. Now, John Lewis. Mr. Lewis specifically said he was boycotting the inaugural because
[3:34:55.820 --> 3:35:02.940]  Trump's election was illegitimate because the Russians hacked the election and tipped
[3:35:02.940 --> 3:35:10.900]  it in Trump's favor. Not even the WAC jobs at the CIA claim that. They don't claim that
[3:35:10.900 --> 3:35:18.300]  whatever they say the Russians did changed the outcome of the election. Now, Representative
[3:35:18.300 --> 3:35:26.140]  Lewis is a genuine hero and he shed blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, but either he
[3:35:26.140 --> 3:35:31.900]  must produce the proof that the Russians changed the outcome of the election and therefore
[3:35:31.900 --> 3:35:39.660]  Trump's election is legitimate or he needs to shut up. He also lied when he said that
[3:35:39.660 --> 3:35:48.820]  he's never done this before because he thought George W. Bush's election was illegitimate
[3:35:48.820 --> 3:35:57.540]  and he refused to attend that inaugural. So in all fairness, Representative Lewis negates
[3:35:57.540 --> 3:36:03.220]  his bravery in the civil rights struggle when he acts like a partisan hack, when he says
[3:36:03.220 --> 3:36:10.660]  things that are not true, that are not that are lies and he should apologize. He picked
[3:36:10.660 --> 3:36:16.540]  this fight. Trump did not pick this fight. You can go on Donald Trump's Twitter feed
[3:36:16.540 --> 3:36:25.780]  today and he correctly calls Lewis out. No, you did the same media stun to George W. Bush.
[3:36:25.780 --> 3:36:34.860]  This is partisan hackery. He owes the president elect an apology or or produce the evidence
[3:36:34.860 --> 3:36:44.340]  the Russians changed the outcome of this election. Alex made reference to deplorable. This is
[3:36:44.340 --> 3:36:52.940]  the event January 19th at the National Press Club. Alex Jones is speaking. Mike Cernovich,
[3:36:52.940 --> 3:37:00.940]  Jack Psobiak and other patriots, other fighters for liberty. This is the grassroots event,
[3:37:00.940 --> 3:37:08.380]  folks. The millionaires and the billionaires and the and the elites who did not support
[3:37:08.380 --> 3:37:17.220]  Donald Trump but are now posing as his friends and those who did legitimately help the president
[3:37:17.220 --> 3:37:23.140]  in official roles. They'll be at the official events. I will be at some of the official
[3:37:23.140 --> 3:37:31.020]  events. I'm excited about the swearing in. After all, how many times in life do you get
[3:37:31.020 --> 3:37:38.020]  an opportunity to wear a top hat and not look like a dork? Although I did wear one when
[3:37:38.020 --> 3:37:45.100]  I was married. So I'm very excited about this, but Alex is right. There are now radical
[3:37:45.100 --> 3:37:52.100]  groups threatening to fill baggies with urine with Clorox to throw them on people. There
[3:37:52.100 --> 3:37:58.380]  are people. There are radical groups openly saying they're going to harass attendees.
[3:37:58.380 --> 3:38:06.540]  They're going to harass those who try to attend. I do think Washington is a tinder box. I do
[3:38:06.540 --> 3:38:14.660]  think there are those on the radical left, DJ 20, other radical groups who are going
[3:38:14.660 --> 3:38:23.060]  to try to be inciting violence. And that's why I noticed that the tactical nanotechnology
[3:38:23.060 --> 3:38:34.460]  bardic body armor at the M4 store is now available. And I think that you ought to consider getting
[3:38:34.460 --> 3:38:42.940]  some of this. This is the best high end totally tested body armor out there. Former Blackwater
[3:38:42.940 --> 3:38:49.660]  operas, former Army Rangers who info wars did to conduct testing and a survey to bring
[3:38:49.660 --> 3:38:56.260]  you the very best products swear by this armor. It's only a quarter of an inch thick. This
[3:38:56.260 --> 3:39:04.740]  is not bulky. It's field tested, but it can stop a 50 a a pistol cartridge. That's how
[3:39:04.740 --> 3:39:11.260]  tough this stuff is. So this price is phenomenal. And whether you're a hunter, whether you're
[3:39:11.260 --> 3:39:18.140]  a sportsman, whether you're headed to Washington, I really recommend this product. Now, I know
[3:39:18.140 --> 3:39:24.740]  that I will be mocked and attacked by the Clinton thugs and lackeys because I swear
[3:39:24.740 --> 3:39:31.660]  by the products on the info wars.com website. I don't know that I would be alive today without
[3:39:31.660 --> 3:39:38.460]  the liver defense and the flush of my system. And I'm not going to go through this again,
[3:39:38.460 --> 3:39:47.140]  but these products work folks. And it's it's a it's a win win. You are helping the revolution.
[3:39:47.140 --> 3:39:53.260]  You're helping broadcast the truth. You're helping bust through the mainstream media
[3:39:53.260 --> 3:40:02.940]  blackouts. And you are you are helping fund the revolution. So go to the info wars store
[3:40:02.940 --> 3:40:08.220]  now and pick up your body armor or any of these other fine supplements. You've got some
[3:40:08.220 --> 3:40:14.140]  great discount prices right now. I stocked up before Christmas. Thank God I did because
[3:40:14.140 --> 3:40:21.700]  I didn't want to wait. So go to the store now. While I'm very excited about January 20th,
[3:40:21.700 --> 3:40:29.220]  I'm also very excited about January 23rd. That's when CNN talking head and a Navarro
[3:40:29.220 --> 3:40:38.540]  speaks at the Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale. Now, Navarro is a Harpy Republican
[3:40:38.540 --> 3:40:47.940]  who said on CNN she voted for Hillary Clinton, who can forget her memorable on air meltdown
[3:40:47.940 --> 3:40:54.380]  when she was screaming pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy at the top of her lungs. CNN has taken
[3:40:54.380 --> 3:41:03.220]  that off down, you know, has taken that offline. You can't find it. Navarro, who is a Jeb Bush
[3:41:03.220 --> 3:41:11.100]  lackey was actually fired by Bush actually initially hired to go into the council's office
[3:41:11.100 --> 3:41:17.340]  to handle immigration policy. There was one small problem. She lied about being a member
[3:41:17.340 --> 3:41:24.000]  of the Florida bar. She is not an attorney in the state of Florida. She also has no
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:31.140]  campaign experience. She has never been a part of a successful Republican campaign for anything.
[3:41:31.140 --> 3:41:40.380]  So why would CNN that promulgates fake news want to employ someone like this? And her
[3:41:40.380 --> 3:41:46.620]  shrill personal attacks on Donald Trump grow tedious. It is time for her to be confronted
[3:41:46.620 --> 3:41:53.620]  with her own record of lies. So join me for in a Navarro's terrific speech. I'm sure
[3:41:53.620 --> 3:42:00.700]  it will be insightful. I don't know what the Broward Community College is paying this
[3:42:00.700 --> 3:42:12.020]  pathetic toady. But I do know this. At CNN, the makeup people, the hairdressers, the doorman,
[3:42:12.020 --> 3:42:19.900]  the gaffers, the camera men, the little people, they tell me she's an abusive diva. She yells
[3:42:19.900 --> 3:42:27.140]  at them. She abuses them. She is mean to them because she thinks she's something. But folks,
[3:42:27.140 --> 3:42:34.420]  she's dumber than dog crap. And it has to be said. And that CNN would have someone as
[3:42:34.420 --> 3:42:41.780]  a talking head who has lied about their background like this shows that they are committed to
[3:42:41.780 --> 3:42:46.540]  fake news.
[3:42:46.540 --> 3:42:54.620]  President Donald Trump thinking seriously about the Supreme Court. Now, I am among those
[3:42:54.620 --> 3:43:04.140]  who believe she may have as many as four appointments. And I think that he has an opportunity to
[3:43:04.140 --> 3:43:14.020]  transform the court. See, I think I think Trump is a transformational president, not
[3:43:14.020 --> 3:43:19.740]  a transitional president, a transformational president. And I think he can bring wholesale
[3:43:19.740 --> 3:43:26.660]  change to our system and reinvigorate this country and get it back on its feet. And the
[3:43:26.660 --> 3:43:32.980]  political establishment will fight this tooth and nail. And one of the forums in which they
[3:43:32.980 --> 3:43:39.860]  will fight it is the US Supreme Court. Now, many of you know that President Trump, President
[3:43:39.860 --> 3:43:45.460]  Elect Trump released a list during the general election and said he would choose from that
[3:43:45.460 --> 3:43:46.460]  list.
[3:43:46.460 --> 3:43:53.580]  And it's true that everybody on that list is a solid conservative. Frankly, I wish the
[3:43:53.580 --> 3:44:01.300]  list had included my friend Judge Andrew Napolitano of Fox News, a trial judge in New Jersey,
[3:44:01.300 --> 3:44:08.300]  a learned judge, a true student of the Constitution, a man who was a protégé and close friend
[3:44:08.300 --> 3:44:15.420]  of Antonin Scalia, who, yes, I believe, was murdered. I will publish an extensive piece
[3:44:15.420 --> 3:44:23.620]  on that in February. I wish the list had included Judge Janice Rogers Brown, an African-American
[3:44:23.620 --> 3:44:29.300]  conservative in the D.C. Circuit, not afraid to put administrative agencies in their place.
[3:44:29.300 --> 3:44:38.420]  I wish the list had included Judge Alex Kaczynski, a Jewish Eastern European, a serious constitutional
[3:44:38.420 --> 3:44:47.940]  scholar on the appeals court of the Ninth Circuit, very much like Justice Scalia in temperament
[3:44:47.940 --> 3:44:54.740]  and wit. I wish the list had included Judge Reggie Walton, an African-American on the
[3:44:54.740 --> 3:45:02.020]  U.S. District Court, who has ruled, who's a former head of the FISA court, a National
[3:45:02.020 --> 3:45:09.540]  Security Hawk, a man who is sometimes skeptical of the government's claims. Although I was
[3:45:09.540 --> 3:45:16.980]  critical of him during the campaign, Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a serious constitutional
[3:45:16.980 --> 3:45:23.620]  scholar, a conservative libertarian, someone I would like to have seen on the list, and
[3:45:23.620 --> 3:45:30.780]  lastly, former Judge Michael Ludig, formerly of the U.S. Court of Appeals, now General
[3:45:30.780 --> 3:45:40.660]  Counsel of Boeing, a brilliant law clerk for Justice Scalia, resigned from the bench. I
[3:45:40.660 --> 3:45:48.980]  would have liked to see all of these libertarian conservatives on the list. I understand, though,
[3:45:48.980 --> 3:45:56.300]  that President Trump may feel that to keep faith with the American people, that he should
[3:45:56.300 --> 3:46:03.060]  select for disappointment from the list he made public. Therefore, I am hoping that he
[3:46:03.060 --> 3:46:13.060]  appoints Judge Don Willits of the Texas Courts, a feisty libertarian who is on the list a fine
[3:46:13.060 --> 3:46:23.780]  jurist with guts, not a right-wing jurist, a conservative, but a libertarian conservative,
[3:46:23.780 --> 3:46:31.940]  one who will back the Trump Revolution. I don't want a right-wing court. I want a Trump
[3:46:31.940 --> 3:46:45.380]  court. I want a reform court. I want an anti-establishment court, and that is my fondest hope.
[3:46:45.380 --> 3:46:54.500]  I also have noticed this past week the public comments of Senator Jeff Sessions as he cruises
[3:46:54.500 --> 3:47:02.460]  to confirmation as Attorney General. Now, I am a Jeff Sessions fan. I like Jeff Sessions
[3:47:02.460 --> 3:47:07.940]  on law and order. I like Jeff Sessions on immigration. I like Jeff Sessions because
[3:47:07.940 --> 3:47:14.500]  he's got guts. I like Jeff Sessions because he's not part of the crowd in the U.S. Senate,
[3:47:14.500 --> 3:47:19.700]  where he is extremely well-liked and respected, but he's not a go-along-to-get-a-long guy,
[3:47:19.700 --> 3:47:28.180]  and he never will be. I was, however, distressed by his comments regarding the 37 states that
[3:47:28.180 --> 3:47:39.140]  have some form of legal marijuana. Currently, the U.S. government is in a stand-down position
[3:47:39.140 --> 3:47:48.460]  where they are not enforcing federal law where it contradicts state law. I can argue legally
[3:47:48.460 --> 3:47:55.300]  that the states have supremacy in this area. Other federal advocates will claim no. The
[3:47:55.300 --> 3:48:04.740]  feds do. Joining me now is Attorney Tyler Nixon, who is a nephew of former, I guess, great
[3:48:04.740 --> 3:48:13.500]  nephew of former President Richard Nixon. Their families hail from Ohio. He is a libertarian
[3:48:13.500 --> 3:48:23.140]  attorney of some note. He is a former Delaware activist who is now representing numerous
[3:48:23.140 --> 3:48:30.860]  clients in the legal marijuana business. Tyler, thanks for joining me here at InfoWars.
[3:48:30.860 --> 3:48:35.820]  Roger, it's great to be with you as always. You have excellent taste in judges, I must
[3:48:35.820 --> 3:48:40.300]  say. There's one name I throw in, and I don't know why it's never come up, is Richard Epstein,
[3:48:40.300 --> 3:48:46.500]  who is a brilliant legal mind and author who would make an exit. He's what I would call
[3:48:46.500 --> 3:48:56.060]  libertarian constitutionalist. Well, I understand the importance of the list, and I can understand
[3:48:56.060 --> 3:49:02.420]  if President-elect Trump feels he must stick to the list for his first appointment. I know
[3:49:02.420 --> 3:49:07.940]  because of my many friendships in the campaign, the list was put together quickly, and there's
[3:49:07.940 --> 3:49:12.860]  many fine people on it. I don't mean to take anything away from them, but I believe that
[3:49:12.860 --> 3:49:18.740]  most of them are more establishment-oriented conservatives. To me, Judge Napolitano would
[3:49:18.740 --> 3:49:25.020]  be a brilliant pick. If it cannot be him, and I think he makes sense for a number of
[3:49:25.020 --> 3:49:31.500]  reasons, then I hope they go to Judge Willett, who is the outstanding libertarian on this
[3:49:31.500 --> 3:49:38.460]  list. But why don't you sum up for us Jeff Sessions on marijuana, what he said this week,
[3:49:38.460 --> 3:49:44.540]  and how you see this playing out. Well, obviously, there's a lot of trepidation
[3:49:44.540 --> 3:49:49.860]  in the industry, which is now employing 10, if not 100, into the hundreds of thousands
[3:49:49.860 --> 3:49:56.780]  of Americans who are gainfully employed, feeding their families. There's a lot of investment
[3:49:56.780 --> 3:50:04.940]  going on, just an amazing innovation, I have to say, just not just within the actual production
[3:50:04.940 --> 3:50:10.940]  of cannabis and different products, but also just technological innovations. It's an amazing
[3:50:10.940 --> 3:50:17.820]  industry. Jeff Sessions, obviously, has made statements just as recently as this spring,
[3:50:17.820 --> 3:50:25.340]  the effect that good people don't use marijuana, which is not, obviously, what we want to hear.
[3:50:25.340 --> 3:50:32.460]  What anybody wants to hear, who takes the libertarian view of this, but also the rational, logical,
[3:50:32.460 --> 3:50:38.740]  fact-based view of cannabis as a product for any type of consumption, which is that it
[3:50:38.740 --> 3:50:44.220]  is effectively harmless. There's been no deaths associated with it, and it's 5,000-year known
[3:50:44.220 --> 3:50:49.020]  history of use by humankind.
[3:50:49.020 --> 3:51:07.820]  Do you have any of these symptoms? Night cramps in the hands and feet. Your arms and legs

[3:51:17.460 --> 3:51:22.220]  lately? If you answered yes to even one of these questions, you may have early warning

[3:54:10.180 --> 3:54:15.580]  All right. Welcome back to Info Wars. We're here with President Richard Nixon's great
[3:54:15.580 --> 3:54:21.340]  nephew, Attorney Tyler Nixon. We're running out of time, so Tyler, let's go back to where
[3:54:21.340 --> 3:54:30.500]  we were and kind of wrap this up. I was going to say congratulations on the new show. It's
[3:54:30.500 --> 3:54:38.500]  very exciting. Info Wars is a great platform, really, at the vanguard of the new media.
[3:54:38.500 --> 3:54:44.460]  I'm grateful to Alex Jones for affording me this time. Now, Tyler, my concern here is
[3:54:44.460 --> 3:54:50.940]  that Senator Sessions doesn't seem to understand the medicinal value of marijuana. No, it's
[3:54:50.940 --> 3:54:56.220]  not that good people don't take marijuana, Senator. Sick people take it. And it has
[3:54:56.220 --> 3:55:04.460]  mutual many, many medical benefits. The amounts of THC that have been tested by the federal
[3:55:04.460 --> 3:55:09.820]  government and their regimen are insufficient to prove this because Big Pharma doesn't
[3:55:09.820 --> 3:55:16.300]  want to prove it. They can't sell aspirin if people can take a legal substance grown
[3:55:16.300 --> 3:55:24.060]  in the earth and used as medicine for 2,000 years. 37, pardon me, numerous enlightened
[3:55:24.060 --> 3:55:31.500]  states are now allowing this for medicinal purposes. And if this is not true, why does
[3:55:31.500 --> 3:55:38.020]  the federal government hold the patent on synthetic THC? What would be the value of
[3:55:38.020 --> 3:55:46.180]  this if it has no medicinal value as our health bureaucracy in the federal government
[3:55:46.180 --> 3:55:51.740]  tells us over and over again? So I thank you for your leadership in this community. I'm
[3:55:51.740 --> 3:55:57.020]  thankful for you for joining us today. Come back next week because I want to continue
[3:55:57.020 --> 3:56:03.900]  this discussion. Tyler Nixon, freedom fighter, someone who has been on the barricades. Thanks
[3:56:03.900 --> 3:56:12.220]  for joining us, Tyler. Thank you, Roger. Thank you. This week, incredibly, NBC's lawyers
[3:56:12.220 --> 3:56:20.260]  say in federal court that the young man who wore a Clinton rape t-shirt on the Today Show
[3:56:20.260 --> 3:56:30.340]  should have expected to be beaten by NBC security guards. Folks, this is an outrage. He was beaten
[3:56:30.340 --> 3:56:42.220]  not by people in the audience, not by rabid Clinton supporters, but by NBC thugs. Now,
[3:56:42.220 --> 3:56:51.460]  these shirts are iconic. They're now hard to find because they were a device that I
[3:56:51.460 --> 3:56:59.100]  dreamed up and Alex Jones propelled to break through the mainstream media blackout of Bill
[3:56:59.100 --> 3:57:06.700]  Clinton's history of serial rape and Hillary Clinton's role in covering it up. If you can
[3:57:06.700 --> 3:57:13.820]  find one of these, buy it now. This shirt's going to end up in the Smithsonian. And speaking
[3:57:13.820 --> 3:57:23.220]  of shirts, the Hillary Clinton for President 2017 shirt now available at infowars.com and
[3:57:23.220 --> 3:57:30.700]  just as important to me, the making of the President 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated
[3:57:30.700 --> 3:57:38.940]  an American Revolution, now available for preorder at the infowars.com store, also available
[3:57:38.940 --> 3:57:44.780]  at Amazon and Barnes and Noble, but buy it anywhere, folks, but buy it if you want to
[3:57:44.780 --> 3:57:51.300]  know how Donald Trump pulled off the greatest upset in American history since Harry Truman
[3:57:51.300 --> 3:57:59.100]  beat Thomas E. Dewey. Thanks for joining me here at infowars. I thank Alex Jones. I thank
[3:57:59.100 --> 3:58:05.980]  the great crew of folks at infowars.com. Go to the store, folks. Support the fight for
[3:58:05.980 --> 3:58:31.460]  liberty, and I'll see you soon. Many thanks.
[3:58:35.980 --> 3:58:46.420]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
