[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:11.680 --> 00:21.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:21.840 --> 00:25.680]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on the Sunday, August 23rd, 2015.
[00:25.680 --> 00:27.720]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:27.720 --> 00:29.960]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:29.960 --> 00:31.040]  He's in Toronto.
[00:31.040 --> 00:33.280]  He had a speech last night.
[00:33.280 --> 00:36.920]  He spoke at a function that George Norrie had.
[00:36.920 --> 00:38.560]  He had a couple of guest speakers.
[00:38.560 --> 00:40.000]  Alex was one of those.
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.400]  And Alex is going to be joining us to talk about what happened as well as to talk about,
[00:45.400 --> 00:50.440]  I'm sure he wants to talk about these two heroes, actually three heroes, I believe, that
[00:50.440 --> 00:51.920]  stopped that attack in France.
[00:51.920 --> 00:55.760]  We're going to break down the details of that when we come back on the news.
[00:55.760 --> 00:59.760]  We have another kind of hero that's going to be joining us in the program in the second
[00:59.760 --> 01:00.760]  hour.
[01:00.760 --> 01:01.760]  That's Thomas Drake.
[01:01.760 --> 01:07.120]  You know, we've got heroes who fight the enemy physically.
[01:07.120 --> 01:11.120]  That's exactly what the fellows in France did in the train.
[01:11.120 --> 01:16.160]  They knew that it was do or die for them as well as for the passengers on that train.
[01:16.160 --> 01:20.000]  They knew they had to do something, do it quickly, or they would be killed.
[01:20.000 --> 01:21.840]  They said, reflex kicked in.
[01:21.840 --> 01:25.800]  Of course, that's something that's going to happen with everybody, but also their training.
[01:25.800 --> 01:29.720]  They were trained as soldiers, and that's not to discount at all their bravery.
[01:29.720 --> 01:32.200]  Certainly there was a lot of bravery in that.
[01:32.200 --> 01:36.320]  What they did after they subdued the fellow, beat him unconscious.
[01:36.320 --> 01:43.440]  He had wounded the first military guy pretty heavily and actually almost cut off one of
[01:43.440 --> 01:44.440]  his fingers.
[01:44.440 --> 01:46.080]  I believe it was his thumb.
[01:46.080 --> 01:51.040]  At that point, however, instead of looking after himself, he was trained to take care
[01:51.040 --> 01:52.040]  of others.
[01:52.040 --> 01:54.480]  As a medic, he went to help other people who had been victims.
[01:54.480 --> 01:56.000]  A couple of people had been shot.
[01:56.000 --> 01:57.200]  One guy had a severe neck wound.
[01:57.200 --> 02:01.600]  He would have bled out if the soldier did not stop the bleeding.
[02:01.600 --> 02:05.500]  So that's the kind of selfless hero these guys are.
[02:05.500 --> 02:08.920]  We also have a selfless hero with Thomas Drake, an NSA whistleblower.
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.400]  You know, when you're a quiet hero, the kind that is doing the right thing when nobody
[02:13.400 --> 02:17.560]  is looking, the kind that has integrity and character, because that's the definition
[02:17.560 --> 02:19.080]  of character.
[02:19.080 --> 02:21.880]  Doing the right thing when no one is watching you.
[02:21.880 --> 02:24.520]  It's very difficult to be in that kind of a position.
[02:24.520 --> 02:29.120]  We're going to talk to him about why he went to work for the NSA, why he became a whistleblower.
[02:29.120 --> 02:30.920]  What was he reporting?
[02:30.920 --> 02:35.160]  He began work on September 11th, the day of the attack.
[02:35.160 --> 02:40.440]  We're going to talk to him about how he learned that was going on at the NSA, at the FBI,
[02:40.440 --> 02:43.200]  at the CIA before the attack.
[02:43.200 --> 02:46.040]  We're going to talk to him about what he was blowing the whistle about.
[02:46.040 --> 02:51.320]  We're going to talk to him about the disgusting parallels between the way he was retaliated
[02:51.320 --> 02:56.480]  for being a whistleblower, the retaliation against him, versus the way they have looked
[02:56.480 --> 02:59.920]  for every kind of excuse for Hillary Clinton.
[02:59.920 --> 03:06.760]  You understand that Hillary Clinton has been accused of mishandling classified documents.
[03:06.760 --> 03:10.480]  That was precisely what they came after Thomas Drake for.
[03:10.480 --> 03:16.280]  But rather than make excuses for Thomas Drake, they tried to lock him away for 35 years.
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.480]  He was only the fourth person to be prosecuted in that way under the Espionage Act.
[03:21.480 --> 03:24.600]  Of course, the first one was Daniel Ellsberg of the Pentagon Papers.
[03:24.600 --> 03:27.040]  It's an interesting story.
[03:27.040 --> 03:28.480]  It's an amazing story.
[03:28.480 --> 03:33.080]  I think that there was far more than the alleged mishandling of documents.
[03:33.080 --> 03:37.720]  It was actually comical when you look at the documents.
[03:37.720 --> 03:40.120]  Mass collection is your friend, that type of thing.
[03:40.120 --> 03:41.760]  These were training manuals.
[03:41.760 --> 03:44.260]  They should not have been classified in the first place.
[03:44.260 --> 03:48.080]  Some of them were not classified when he got them.
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.800]  And that was the same excuse that Clinton has, except that her emails are emails that
[03:52.800 --> 03:56.600]  are born classified, as we discussed on Friday.
[03:56.600 --> 04:01.640]  A former official with the organization that classifies documents for the American government
[04:01.640 --> 04:08.400]  says that when you have conversations with the Secretary of State and foreign dignitaries
[04:08.400 --> 04:13.360]  or they have intelligence that has been collected on foreign dignitaries by the NSA, that is
[04:13.360 --> 04:15.920]  born classified.
[04:15.920 --> 04:21.600]  Everyone knows that that kind of intelligence does not need to wait for a sticker or somebody
[04:21.600 --> 04:25.200]  to label that as being classified.
[04:25.200 --> 04:30.960]  So there's an amazing hypocrisy between these two cases.
[04:30.960 --> 04:32.640]  We're going to talk about that.
[04:32.640 --> 04:36.600]  We're also going to talk about the history of the Espionage Act.
[04:36.600 --> 04:41.240]  We're going to talk about the culture of trying to sell a philosophy of surveillance.
[04:41.240 --> 04:45.960]  One of the things that Thomas Drake did in the years before he went to the NSA was he
[04:45.960 --> 04:49.280]  watched carefully the Stasi, just as William Benny did.
[04:49.280 --> 04:52.120]  I think that's why he was so concerned about it.
[04:52.120 --> 04:55.160]  And again, joining us at the bottom of the hour is going to be Alex Jones.
[04:55.160 --> 04:56.160]  Stay with us.
[04:56.160 --> 04:57.160]  We'll be right back.
[04:57.160 --> 05:07.720]  We'll see you next time.
[05:07.720 --> 05:20.400]  We'll see you next week.
[05:20.400 --> 05:23.080]  your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now
[05:23.080 --> 05:28.080]  at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[05:28.200 --> 05:29.280]  Brain force is here.
[05:29.280 --> 05:31.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[05:31.560 --> 05:33.120]  You probably noticed I've been more focused,
[05:33.120 --> 05:34.680]  less brain fog, more energy,
[05:34.680 --> 05:36.560]  and it's because of brain force.
[05:36.560 --> 05:38.240]  There's always hidden additives in your food,
[05:38.240 --> 05:39.840]  even organic food has hidden additives.
[05:39.840 --> 05:41.760]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good,
[05:41.760 --> 05:43.280]  you're still damaging your brain.
[05:43.280 --> 05:45.280]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[05:45.280 --> 05:47.400]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[05:47.400 --> 05:49.400]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[05:49.400 --> 05:50.880]  You will find brain force
[05:50.880 --> 05:54.520]  and other game changing products at infowarslife.com
[05:54.520 --> 05:57.760]  or call 888-253-3139.
[05:59.400 --> 06:03.400]  ["Waging War on Corruption"]
[06:09.080 --> 06:13.560]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[06:13.560 --> 06:17.160]  At the top of this season
[06:17.160 --> 06:20.320]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[06:20.320 --> 06:22.600]  This Sunday, August 23rd, 2015,
[06:22.600 --> 06:24.160]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[06:24.160 --> 06:26.960]  Alex Jones has been in Canada this weekend.
[06:26.960 --> 06:30.720]  He spoke at a George Norrie event in Toronto last night.
[06:30.720 --> 06:31.960]  He's gonna be joining us, however,
[06:31.960 --> 06:34.480]  at the bottom of the hour, he's gonna be calling in.
[06:34.480 --> 06:38.720]  And in the next hour, we have joining us, Thomas Drake,
[06:38.720 --> 06:41.480]  one of the big NSA whistleblowers
[06:41.480 --> 06:44.920]  that were concerned about the mishandling,
[06:44.920 --> 06:47.280]  I wouldn't not say that he was actually charged,
[06:47.280 --> 06:49.800]  alleged mishandling of documents,
[06:49.800 --> 06:51.760]  but he and William Benny and others
[06:51.760 --> 06:53.040]  were concerned about the way
[06:53.040 --> 06:55.400]  the government was mishandling your information.
[06:55.400 --> 06:58.280]  Violating the Constitution, the dragnet surveillance,
[06:58.280 --> 07:01.720]  the massive boondoggle, the massive waste involved in that.
[07:01.720 --> 07:03.120]  There were a lot of different aspects
[07:03.120 --> 07:04.320]  of things that they were concerned about.
[07:04.320 --> 07:07.440]  They went through official channels, they were shut down.
[07:07.440 --> 07:09.800]  Eventually, they went to the press.
[07:09.800 --> 07:12.360]  And then there was retaliation.
[07:12.360 --> 07:15.520]  Interestingly enough, from the same prosecutors
[07:15.520 --> 07:19.840]  that gave the banks no prosecution.
[07:19.840 --> 07:22.280]  Lanny Brewer, the guy who became famous
[07:22.280 --> 07:25.440]  for his too big to jail comments about HSBC.
[07:25.440 --> 07:29.600]  Remember HSBC was laundering money for drug cartels,
[07:29.600 --> 07:31.200]  for terrorists?
[07:31.200 --> 07:34.120]  The Sinaloa cartel with El Chapo, remember him?
[07:34.120 --> 07:35.800]  He just escaped from prison.
[07:35.800 --> 07:37.320]  Donald Trump was talking about him a lot.
[07:37.320 --> 07:39.720]  Well, they were laundering money for him.
[07:39.720 --> 07:43.280]  He had his own private window at HSBC.
[07:43.280 --> 07:47.120]  HSBC and other big banks had been caught before
[07:47.120 --> 07:48.400]  laundering money.
[07:48.400 --> 07:49.720]  They had been given probation,
[07:49.720 --> 07:52.280]  a little slap on the wrist, not much at all.
[07:52.280 --> 07:54.680]  They caught them again because they didn't reform
[07:54.680 --> 07:57.280]  their processes, their procedures.
[07:57.280 --> 07:58.720]  That time, they gave them a larger fine.
[07:58.720 --> 08:01.920]  Still, a very, very small fine concerning
[08:01.920 --> 08:04.920]  the amount of profit that they had made.
[08:04.920 --> 08:07.520]  And they said, we are not going to take away their charter.
[08:07.520 --> 08:11.560]  That would not serve the interests of the American people.
[08:11.560 --> 08:12.800]  And for that, everybody said, well,
[08:12.800 --> 08:14.960]  you're saying that they're too big to jail,
[08:14.960 --> 08:17.400]  just like they were too big to fail
[08:17.400 --> 08:19.440]  back under the Bush administration.
[08:19.440 --> 08:23.080]  Nevertheless, the same Lanny Brewer
[08:23.080 --> 08:25.880]  comes after Thomas Drake.
[08:25.880 --> 08:27.040]  And what did he come after him for?
[08:27.040 --> 08:28.880]  Well, he came after him for allegedly
[08:28.880 --> 08:30.440]  mishandling classified documents,
[08:30.440 --> 08:31.920]  not giving them to a foreign power,
[08:31.920 --> 08:34.720]  but allegedly mishandling them.
[08:34.720 --> 08:38.200]  Precisely the same charges that many people
[08:38.200 --> 08:40.440]  are alleging about Hillary Clinton.
[08:40.440 --> 08:45.440]  However, the information that Hillary Clinton has,
[08:45.480 --> 08:50.000]  both in quantity and in its classified nature,
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.080]  makes the three or four documents
[08:52.080 --> 08:53.600]  that they came after Thomas Drake for
[08:53.600 --> 08:54.840]  pale in comparison.
[08:54.840 --> 08:55.680]  It's not even close.
[08:55.680 --> 08:59.160]  I mean, he had things like a bulk collection is our friend.
[08:59.160 --> 09:00.880]  We'll talk to him about the exact things,
[09:00.880 --> 09:02.880]  things that should not have even been classified,
[09:02.880 --> 09:05.400]  things that were employee handouts.
[09:05.400 --> 09:08.280]  It wasn't the private conversation with foreign dignitaries.
[09:08.280 --> 09:10.480]  So we're gonna talk to him about
[09:10.480 --> 09:11.760]  what happened as a whistleblower,
[09:11.760 --> 09:14.640]  his concerns about the NSA, the dangers that he sees,
[09:14.640 --> 09:17.080]  because as I mentioned in the last segment,
[09:17.080 --> 09:19.680]  like William Benny, he spent a great deal of time
[09:19.680 --> 09:21.520]  watching East Germany and the Stasi.
[09:21.520 --> 09:24.760]  He knows what a surveillance state it looks like.
[09:24.760 --> 09:27.480]  He also knows that what we are capable of now
[09:27.480 --> 09:29.920]  is far more dangerous than anything
[09:29.920 --> 09:31.560]  that ever happened under the Stasi.
[09:31.560 --> 09:33.240]  So I wanna talk to Thomas Drake
[09:33.240 --> 09:35.800]  because I want people to understand
[09:35.800 --> 09:38.120]  how there's a double legal standard here,
[09:38.120 --> 09:41.720]  how we have a dark double government as he points out.
[09:41.720 --> 09:44.600]  People like Hillary Clinton can do whatever they wish
[09:44.600 --> 09:47.760]  and get away with whatever they do.
[09:47.760 --> 09:50.520]  But people who point out the crimes of government
[09:50.520 --> 09:53.640]  are retaliated against like Thomas Drake.
[09:53.640 --> 09:56.400]  He also has something to tell us about the 9-11.
[09:56.400 --> 09:59.560]  I'm very interested to talk to him about that as well.
[09:59.560 --> 10:01.540]  Now we have some other heroes that we're gonna be talking
[10:01.540 --> 10:02.880]  about here in just a moment.
[10:02.880 --> 10:04.920]  But before we do, those are the people
[10:04.920 --> 10:08.360]  who stopped the Paris attack on the train.
[10:08.360 --> 10:10.800]  Before we do, I wanted to go over some economic news.
[10:10.800 --> 10:12.960]  These are a couple of articles that are up on infowars.com.
[10:12.960 --> 10:16.320]  The global economy is officially melting down.
[10:16.320 --> 10:18.160]  They say as much as the financiers on Wall Street
[10:18.160 --> 10:21.320]  and officials of the Fed would like to keep the party going,
[10:21.320 --> 10:22.840]  it looks like it is about to stop.
[10:22.840 --> 10:24.640]  This is from Joshua Krauss, The Daily Sheeple.
[10:24.640 --> 10:27.560]  He says, years of bailout and monetary expansion
[10:27.560 --> 10:29.280]  have created one of the most inflated
[10:29.280 --> 10:31.720]  and artificial economic booms in history.
[10:31.720 --> 10:34.120]  He points out the Dow has fallen 1,300 points
[10:34.120 --> 10:35.080]  from its peak.
[10:35.080 --> 10:37.800]  On Friday alone, it fell by 530 points,
[10:37.800 --> 10:41.680]  making it the ninth worst stock market crash in US history.
[10:41.680 --> 10:43.920]  Another article we have says the two day
[10:43.920 --> 10:48.920]  stock market crash this week was greater than any one day
[10:49.040 --> 10:51.360]  stock market crash in US history.
[10:51.360 --> 10:54.400]  It was an 888 point crash.
[10:54.400 --> 10:55.800]  Going on with some of the other metrics
[10:55.800 --> 10:58.560]  from this first article, he says the Shanghai composite
[10:58.560 --> 11:00.240]  fell by more than 11% this week.
[11:00.240 --> 11:03.240]  China's stock market has lost a third of its value
[11:03.240 --> 11:04.720]  since its previous peak.
[11:04.720 --> 11:08.080]  He says it's lost 4% of its value on just Friday alone
[11:08.080 --> 11:10.320]  after it was revealed their manufacturing activity
[11:10.320 --> 11:13.440]  had reached a 77 month low.
[11:13.440 --> 11:16.320]  That's over six years, about six and a half years.
[11:16.320 --> 11:18.920]  400 of the world's richest people lost a total
[11:18.920 --> 11:20.960]  of $182 billion this week,
[11:20.960 --> 11:24.280]  amounting to 6% of their collective wealth.
[11:24.280 --> 11:27.660]  I won't be crying for them, but you have to be concerned
[11:27.660 --> 11:30.720]  that they will do something very dangerous.
[11:30.720 --> 11:32.600]  Just as we heard before 9-11,
[11:32.600 --> 11:34.920]  they need another Pearl Harbor.
[11:34.920 --> 11:38.000]  That works whether you want to build the size of the NSA
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.120]  or whether you want to shake things up
[11:41.120 --> 11:43.360]  so you can make money because they make money
[11:43.360 --> 11:46.120]  when things rise rapidly and they make money
[11:46.120 --> 11:47.860]  when things fall rapidly.
[11:47.860 --> 11:50.320]  They can go long or they can go short.
[11:50.320 --> 11:52.760]  They can buy into it or they can sell these things short.
[11:52.760 --> 11:54.240]  So they can make a lot of money
[11:54.240 --> 11:55.840]  if they create a massive crisis.
[11:55.840 --> 11:57.960]  One more metric here, they say commodities
[11:57.960 --> 11:59.640]  have fallen to a 13 year low.
[11:59.640 --> 12:02.680]  The price of copper has reached a six year low
[12:02.680 --> 12:07.680]  while oil has suffered its longest decline since 1986.
[12:08.640 --> 12:10.200]  So that's the economic news.
[12:10.200 --> 12:14.080]  Very concerning because usually in August is very quiet.
[12:14.080 --> 12:17.240]  Things usually change in September and October.
[12:17.240 --> 12:19.680]  And we had a lot of people saying they expected
[12:19.680 --> 12:21.440]  big changes for a lot of different reasons.
[12:21.440 --> 12:24.760]  A lot of people have different ways they forecast the economy.
[12:24.760 --> 12:28.120]  A lot of them expecting big changes in September.
[12:28.120 --> 12:30.560]  And we haven't even gotten there yet.
[12:30.560 --> 12:32.560]  We've got another week of August
[12:32.560 --> 12:35.800]  and already we've had massive moves.
[12:35.800 --> 12:38.560]  Also, we have some information about Planned Parenthood
[12:38.560 --> 12:41.680]  and the videos that have exposed the criminal,
[12:41.680 --> 12:43.480]  I would say, activities there.
[12:43.480 --> 12:45.120]  Court has now removed the injunction
[12:45.120 --> 12:46.900]  on the Planned Parenthood videos.
[12:46.900 --> 12:48.880]  That was an injunction that was put in there
[12:48.880 --> 12:52.180]  to stop them from showing any videos from STEM Express.
[12:52.180 --> 12:55.560]  They have now released the newest video of that.
[12:55.560 --> 12:56.920]  And of course, what are they talking about?
[12:56.920 --> 12:59.200]  They're talking about people
[12:59.200 --> 13:03.880]  who are getting entirely complete babies.
[13:03.880 --> 13:06.360]  Lab recipients get aborted babies.
[13:06.360 --> 13:08.360]  They say they go into shock when they open the box
[13:08.360 --> 13:11.640]  to find an quote, intact case.
[13:11.640 --> 13:13.280]  In other words, a whole body.
[13:13.280 --> 13:15.600]  They say, yeah, if you've got an intact case,
[13:15.600 --> 13:16.440]  which we've done a lot,
[13:16.440 --> 13:20.080]  we sometimes ship those back to our lab in its entirety.
[13:20.080 --> 13:22.360]  Tell the lab it's coming because they'll open up the box
[13:22.360 --> 13:25.960]  and go, oh my God, yeah, I bet they will.
[13:25.960 --> 13:27.040]  I bet they will.
[13:27.040 --> 13:30.720]  Now, there were massive protests yesterday
[13:30.720 --> 13:32.520]  across the country against Planned Parenthood.
[13:32.520 --> 13:36.780]  There were over 300 protests that were set up on Saturday.
[13:36.780 --> 13:38.920]  We have an article up on infowars.com
[13:38.920 --> 13:40.280]  showing some of the Twitter feed,
[13:40.280 --> 13:41.960]  showing some of the pictures,
[13:41.960 --> 13:45.120]  people's reports about how many people that were there.
[13:45.120 --> 13:47.880]  Louisville, they had some about 200 in Oklahoma City,
[13:47.880 --> 13:50.720]  they say, over 1,000 in Aurora, Illinois,
[13:50.720 --> 13:53.500]  over 600 in Lincoln, Nebraska.
[13:53.500 --> 13:55.960]  They say about 300 plus in Nashville.
[13:55.960 --> 13:57.920]  I looked at some of the ones in North Carolina
[13:57.920 --> 13:59.400]  from some of my friends that were putting them out.
[13:59.400 --> 14:03.040]  Charlotte had about 400 people turn out to that rally.
[14:03.040 --> 14:05.240]  In Raleigh, they had about 100 people.
[14:05.240 --> 14:07.440]  And let's see, this is Greensboro.
[14:07.440 --> 14:09.560]  They had about 130 people.
[14:09.560 --> 14:13.760]  If you've got 300 rallies across the country,
[14:13.760 --> 14:17.120]  an extremely conservative figure of 100,
[14:17.120 --> 14:18.720]  which is the smallest one of those cities
[14:18.720 --> 14:20.480]  that I saw and that was in Raleigh,
[14:20.480 --> 14:22.560]  that would give you 30,000.
[14:22.560 --> 14:24.320]  But of course, there's some places that have 400,
[14:24.320 --> 14:27.680]  some places that have 1,000 people there.
[14:27.680 --> 14:29.640]  I hope we have turned the corner on this.
[14:29.640 --> 14:34.640]  I hope we understand, finally, the value of life.
[14:34.660 --> 14:37.560]  Like many people, I was sitting on the fence
[14:37.560 --> 14:39.440]  not thinking about it a great deal.
[14:39.440 --> 14:41.440]  I thought of it as an individual's choice
[14:41.440 --> 14:44.960]  until we saw the,
[14:44.960 --> 14:49.080]  the entire birth of a child,
[14:49.080 --> 14:50.520]  except for the top of their head,
[14:50.520 --> 14:53.120]  a partial birth abortion, they call it.
[14:53.120 --> 14:55.040]  At that point, I realized that it was murder.
[14:55.040 --> 14:57.520]  And at this point, I think people are waking up
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.240]  to not only the profit motive of Planned Parenthood.
[15:01.240 --> 15:03.480]  And we've talked to Abby Johnson,
[15:03.480 --> 15:07.120]  who was a Planned Parenthood employee,
[15:07.120 --> 15:10.360]  employer of the year, a manager in Houston.
[15:10.360 --> 15:12.480]  She resigned because she realized
[15:12.480 --> 15:15.560]  that they were not just trying to help young women
[15:15.560 --> 15:17.040]  coming in there, pregnant women,
[15:17.040 --> 15:18.840]  to make a decision to give them treatments.
[15:18.840 --> 15:20.600]  They were pushing them towards an abortion.
[15:20.600 --> 15:23.040]  They had a quota that they needed to do.
[15:23.040 --> 15:26.800]  And she also saw ultrasound of a child
[15:26.800 --> 15:28.640]  that was being aborted.
[15:28.640 --> 15:33.120]  And she saw it recoiling in pain, trying to get away.
[15:33.120 --> 15:35.520]  They told her, well, it's too young to feel any pain.
[15:35.520 --> 15:37.200]  She saw otherwise.
[15:37.200 --> 15:41.120]  I think that America is having that kind of wake up moment.
[15:41.120 --> 15:42.600]  I certainly hope so.
[15:42.600 --> 15:43.440]  Stay with us.
[15:43.440 --> 15:44.260]  We're gonna be right back.

[15:46.960 --> 15:48.480]  And Alex Jones will be joining us

[20:02.800 --> 20:04.600]  the Alex Jones show.
[20:12.360 --> 20:18.840]  We are on the March. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and
[20:18.840 --> 20:30.200]  the GCN radio network. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[20:30.200 --> 20:33.560]  on the Sunday, August 23rd, 2015. I'm David Knight, your
[20:33.560 --> 20:36.120]  host. Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the next
[20:36.120 --> 20:39.720]  segment. He went to Toronto last night to speak to a at a
[20:39.720 --> 20:43.200]  George Norrie event. He was one of the guest speakers there
[20:43.200 --> 20:45.640]  last night when the featured speakers is going to be calling
[20:45.640 --> 20:49.960]  us to tell us about that. And I'm sure that he wants to weigh
[20:49.960 --> 20:53.880]  in on the situation in France where there was a terrorist
[20:53.880 --> 20:58.520]  attack on one of the trains, a man with an AK 47. And he also
[20:58.520 --> 21:02.840]  had a pistol. He had a box cutter with him, his AK 47
[21:02.840 --> 21:05.480]  jam. That's one of the reasons why these guys were able to
[21:05.480 --> 21:07.960]  take him down, but they didn't know that was jammed at the
[21:07.960 --> 21:10.680]  time. They thought they were going to die. The crew on the
[21:10.680 --> 21:13.960]  Paris bound train barricaded themselves in their staff room
[21:13.960 --> 21:18.360]  and locked the door as he was going through the train. His
[21:18.360 --> 21:21.640]  26 year old Moroccan National Air Force Airman Spencer Stone
[21:21.640 --> 21:23.720]  ran at the gunman when he opened fire on the high speed
[21:23.720 --> 21:27.560]  service to Paris. Also joining him was Oregon National Guard
[21:27.560 --> 21:31.720]  member Alec Scarlatos and Anthony Sandler from California.
[21:31.720 --> 21:36.360]  They were friends and British National Chris Norman. They
[21:36.360 --> 21:40.440]  beat him senseless and tied him up waiting for the
[21:40.440 --> 21:43.880]  authorities. And of course, Spencer Stone was severely
[21:43.880 --> 21:47.000]  injured himself. He was cut several times with a box
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.520]  cutter and his thumb, I think it was one of his fingers at
[21:50.520 --> 21:53.160]  least, was nearly cut off. Nevertheless, in spite of that
[21:53.160 --> 21:57.240]  wound, he went to the aid of passengers, a couple of whom
[21:57.240 --> 22:00.280]  had been shot. So these guys took the pistol from him, then
[22:00.280 --> 22:03.960]  they took the AK 47 and beat him with his own gun until he
[22:03.960 --> 22:07.400]  was unconscious. They say officials did not disclose a
[22:07.400 --> 22:11.640]  positive motive for the attack. Do you think it might have
[22:11.640 --> 22:14.040]  been terrorism? That was the narrative for a first couple
[22:14.040 --> 22:18.280]  of days. I thought, who are they talking to in France? They
[22:18.280 --> 22:21.000]  don't know if this was a terrorist event. I mean, are
[22:21.000 --> 22:24.760]  they getting their information from Inspector Clousseau?
[22:24.760 --> 22:28.920]  This is about as smoking gun as you get folks. Yeah, it was a
[22:28.920 --> 22:33.880]  terrorist event. One of the fellows that was there, one of
[22:33.880 --> 22:35.880]  the heroes said he had a collision of coffee, had a
[22:35.880 --> 22:38.680]  magazine that was full. My thought was, okay, probably I'm
[22:38.680 --> 22:42.040]  going to die anyway, but let's go. I'd rather die being
[22:42.040 --> 22:46.360]  active. They say one of the airmen, the airman Spencer
[22:46.360 --> 22:49.880]  Stone with his arm in a sling recounted on Sunday, how he
[22:49.880 --> 22:52.440]  and two other Americans tackled the gunman. He says, it
[22:52.440 --> 22:55.240]  seemed like he was ready to fight to the end, but he said,
[22:55.240 --> 22:59.160]  so were we. He's hailed as not only being the first to
[22:59.160 --> 23:02.200]  grapple with the attacker that is Stone, but also for
[23:02.200 --> 23:04.600]  helping to stop the bleeding of a French American passenger
[23:04.600 --> 23:06.040]  that was wounded by a bullet. That's the one that I
[23:06.040 --> 23:07.800]  mentioned where he stopped the bleeding. The fellow could
[23:07.800 --> 23:10.440]  have bled to death in the beginning. It was mostly gut
[23:10.440 --> 23:14.520]  instinct survival. He said, our training kicked in after the
[23:14.520 --> 23:19.160]  struggle and one person, the US ambassador says of them, we
[23:19.160 --> 23:21.880]  often use the word hero and in this case, I know that word
[23:21.880 --> 23:24.360]  has never been more appropriate. That's US Ambassador
[23:24.360 --> 23:27.400]  Jane Hartley. She says, they truly are heroes when most of
[23:27.400 --> 23:30.440]  us would run away. Spencer, Alec and Anthony ran into the
[23:30.440 --> 23:33.960]  line of fire and said, let's go. That changed the fate of
[23:33.960 --> 23:38.120]  many people. And you know, there are heroes who do the
[23:38.120 --> 23:40.120]  physical attacks as I mentioned at the very beginning of
[23:40.120 --> 23:43.000]  the show. And then there are those who are the quiet heroes.
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.080]  People like our guest in the second hour, Thomas Drake.
[23:47.080 --> 23:52.040]  He is someone who did who did the hero's job, but did it in a
[23:52.040 --> 23:55.160]  way that is very difficult. So I have to take anything away
[23:55.160 --> 23:58.280]  from the people who did this, who saved their lives, who
[23:58.280 --> 24:01.560]  saved others lives, who risked their lives to do that. But we
[24:01.560 --> 24:05.560]  have to understand that Thomas Drake risked his life as well.
[24:05.560 --> 24:09.400]  He had a family. He had a son who was very sick. He had a
[24:09.400 --> 24:12.840]  secure position. When you're in a position of comfort like
[24:12.840 --> 24:16.760]  that, it's very easy to rationalize that you should
[24:16.760 --> 24:19.240]  just follow authority. You should just do what the
[24:19.240 --> 24:21.720]  government is telling you. It will all be better in the
[24:21.720 --> 24:25.640]  long run. Thomas Drake, however, understood the
[24:25.640 --> 24:29.000]  Constitution. He understood where this leads because like
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.880]  William Binney, he had monitored East Germany and
[24:31.880 --> 24:35.800]  the Stasi for a very long time. And that hardened his
[24:35.800 --> 24:39.400]  resolve to where he would put his life on the line, doing it
[24:39.400 --> 24:43.480]  quietly when no one would see. But some people did see. I
[24:43.480 --> 24:48.120]  want to play for you what Edward Snowden said about Thomas
[24:48.120 --> 24:50.680]  Drake, our guest in the second hour. Here's what Ed Snowden
[24:50.680 --> 24:53.720]  said about him. Fair to say that if there hadn't been a
[24:53.720 --> 24:57.640]  Thomas Drake, there couldn't have been an Edward Snowden.
[24:57.640 --> 25:01.400]  Here we had a guy who did absolutely everything right. He
[25:01.400 --> 25:03.560]  placed his faith in the system. He saw, you know, the
[25:03.560 --> 25:07.720]  warless fire tapping hundreds of millions of Americans. He
[25:07.720 --> 25:11.400]  saw corruption. He brought it to the IG. He brought it to
[25:11.400 --> 25:15.160]  Congress and rather than protecting him, they actively
[25:15.160 --> 25:19.880]  retaliated against him in the the most public and
[25:19.880 --> 25:24.120]  aggressive way. Yes, they did retaliate against him. They
[25:24.120 --> 25:28.520]  tried to put him in jail for 35 years. They came after him
[25:28.520 --> 25:32.440]  for mishandling of classified information. The documents
[25:32.440 --> 25:35.560]  that they accused him of mishandling were nonsense
[25:35.560 --> 25:37.640]  compared to what Hillary Clinton has. And for her, they
[25:37.640 --> 25:41.160]  look for every excuse they can not to prosecute her. We're
[25:41.160 --> 25:43.160]  going to talk to him about what he saw, what he blew the
[25:43.160 --> 25:46.440]  whistle on, what the dangers are to America, the different
[25:46.440 --> 25:50.600]  ways that those who run our dark and secret double
[25:50.600 --> 25:54.280]  government escape prosecution. We're also going to talk
[25:54.280 --> 25:58.200]  about the Espionage Act because I want to lay some of the
[25:58.200 --> 26:01.240]  history down on this for you before he gets here. So he'll
[26:01.240 --> 26:04.120]  be free to give you his story without getting burned down
[26:04.120 --> 26:08.680]  with the back story of what went on with the Espionage
[26:08.680 --> 26:10.840]  Act and what we have seen with that for a number of years.
[26:10.840 --> 26:12.680]  I want to tell you about that. I also want to tell you about
[26:12.680 --> 26:15.480]  how the TSA is coming to the movies before I do. Real
[26:15.480 --> 26:20.760]  quickly, we have a limited time special at infowarslife.com,
[26:20.760 --> 26:24.600]  30% off Silver Bullet, or you can still get

[26:31.560 --> 26:33.960]  give that a try. Of course, Silver Bullet is our powerful

[26:49.720 --> 26:52.920]  of deionized water. There's a reason that listeners have
[26:52.920 --> 26:56.120]  dubbed Silver Bullet as their preparedness silver. So
[26:56.120 --> 26:58.360]  right now is a great time to get it with this sale that's

[27:06.600 --> 27:09.160]  all going to lead? Of course, where is the surveillance
[27:09.160 --> 27:12.680]  state going to lead? It's a gradual incremental movement.
[27:12.680 --> 27:15.560]  Just as I pointed out on Friday when I talked about the
[27:15.560 --> 27:19.560]  people who are reacting to the manufactured crisis of the
[27:19.560 --> 27:22.840]  open borders, and it is a manufactured crisis. It's
[27:22.840 --> 27:26.280]  manufactured like all these crises are. They create a
[27:26.280 --> 27:29.880]  crisis. They use that to show the problem. They use that to
[27:29.880 --> 27:33.320]  expand the government over and over again, whether it is the
[27:33.320 --> 27:37.720]  NSA and the Patriot Act, or whether it is going to be
[27:37.720 --> 27:41.320]  the kind of movement controls that we're, I'm very
[27:41.320 --> 27:43.880]  concerned about in many different areas. I'm looking at
[27:43.880 --> 27:46.920]  what the government is planning in terms of controlling our
[27:46.920 --> 27:49.960]  movement, our transportation with autonomous cars,
[27:49.960 --> 27:53.080]  constantly tracking, constantly reporting our movement, able
[27:53.080 --> 27:56.920]  to shut down our movement if they wish. Do we really want to
[27:56.920 --> 28:00.760]  give them that capability at the border? Do we really want
[28:00.760 --> 28:05.720]  to throw fire on the fuel, on the fire, or the TSA telling
[28:05.720 --> 28:08.600]  them, yeah, you're the transportation authority. We
[28:08.600 --> 28:10.760]  want you out on the highways. We want you especially down at
[28:10.760 --> 28:14.280]  the border. Do we really want to do that? We need to
[28:14.280 --> 28:19.320]  understand that just like gun control, when there's a
[28:19.320 --> 28:23.160]  tragedy, the politicians will use that tragedy to try to
[28:23.160 --> 28:26.520]  push for gun control. In the same way, we see the
[28:26.520 --> 28:30.520]  Republicans using tragedies, violent crimes that are
[28:30.520 --> 28:35.720]  committed by illegal aliens, using that to push for more
[28:35.720 --> 28:40.360]  security theater. The wall will be absolute theater, but the
[28:40.360 --> 28:44.440]  high tech behind the population tracking will not be
[28:44.440 --> 28:47.080]  theater. Stay with us. We'll be right back with Alex Jones,
[28:47.080 --> 28:50.600]  Thomas Drake, and the next hour.
[28:50.600 --> 29:01.240]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for
[29:01.240 --> 29:03.960]  info wars listeners. We've confirmed through our major
[29:03.960 --> 29:07.400]  suppliers attempting to resupply survival shield x2

[31:35.720 --> 31:38.200]  brain force. There's always hidden additives in your food.

[32:59.320 --> 33:05.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:05.720 --> 33:32.520]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance.
[33:32.520 --> 33:41.320]  It's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on the
[33:41.320 --> 33:45.240]  Sunday August 23rd, 2015. I'm David Knight. As I've been
[33:45.240 --> 33:49.160]  mentioning, we're going to be joined in the second hour by an SA whistleblower,
[33:49.160 --> 33:52.760]  Thomas Drake, the only one of the whistleblowers who was
[33:52.760 --> 33:56.120]  prosecuted by the government. They alleged that he had
[33:56.120 --> 34:00.680]  mishandled documents, not anywhere like the document
[34:00.680 --> 34:03.560]  mishandling that we've seen from Hillary Clinton. They said that he had
[34:03.560 --> 34:07.480]  obstructed and destroyed evidence. It turned out that he hadn't. The
[34:07.480 --> 34:11.240]  entire case folded the day before they went to court.
[34:11.240 --> 34:14.440]  They were scolded by the judge and of course the
[34:14.440 --> 34:18.280]  person who was overseeing the prosecution was Lenny Brewer, the same guy who
[34:18.280 --> 34:22.760]  let HSBC and all the large banks walk, said they're too big to jail,
[34:22.760 --> 34:26.040]  essentially. Obama said, well, there were some laws
[34:26.040 --> 34:29.720]  that they didn't break. There were some laws that they didn't break.
[34:29.720 --> 34:33.640]  That's not to say that they didn't break a whole lot of laws that they really
[34:33.640 --> 34:36.280]  should have gone to jail for. Someone should have gone to jail for it.
[34:36.280 --> 34:39.960]  They got a very small fine. Hillary Clinton, so far, nothing is happening to
[34:39.960 --> 34:43.160]  her. She still is a pretty popular candidate. She's
[34:43.160 --> 34:45.800]  still the candidate to beat. She's taken a hit and some of her
[34:45.800 --> 34:50.120]  popularity and some of the other politicians who would like
[34:50.120 --> 34:53.320]  to take her place, like Governor O'Malley, former Governor O'Malley, says we
[34:53.320 --> 34:57.800]  have to look to the future. He went on to the
[34:57.800 --> 35:01.560]  NBC show, actually it was ABC he was talking to,
[35:01.560 --> 35:05.720]  and he said we cannot allow our party to be branded by those sorts of questions
[35:05.720 --> 35:10.120]  of the past. That's actually a pretty good description of Hillary Clinton. She
[35:10.120 --> 35:14.120]  is a question of the past. He says we have to look to the future. We
[35:14.120 --> 35:17.240]  have to offer ideas to move our country forward for the future. That's why
[35:17.240 --> 35:19.480]  it's important to have debates, but of course you're not going to have any
[35:19.480 --> 35:22.200]  debates on the Democrat side as long as Hillary Clinton
[35:22.200 --> 35:25.320]  is a candidate. Everybody is going to be debating
[35:25.320 --> 35:29.080]  her history. There's a lot of history with Hillary Clinton. There's a lot of
[35:29.080 --> 35:33.160]  skeletons in her closet, but it is absolutely astonishing,
[35:33.160 --> 35:37.080]  astonishing to see how they are avoiding prosecution for Hillary Clinton
[35:37.080 --> 35:41.400]  for the very serious classified documents that she really did, mishandle,
[35:41.400 --> 35:44.360]  for the obstruction of justice that she engaged in,
[35:44.360 --> 35:48.360]  and see how they came after they invented these charges
[35:48.360 --> 35:53.000]  and tried to send Thomas Drake to jail for decades because he had blown the
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.040]  whistle on corruption, on waste, and on criminal
[35:58.040 --> 36:01.080]  activity. He and William Benny and others were
[36:01.080 --> 36:05.320]  exposing the fact that our government was engaged in
[36:05.320 --> 36:09.160]  massive surveillance, that they had changed the rules after September 11th.
[36:09.160 --> 36:12.600]  He actually began on September 11th. We're going to talk about September 11th.
[36:12.600 --> 36:15.160]  We're going to talk about the parallels with Clinton, and we're going to break
[36:15.160 --> 36:19.160]  down the history of that. Before we do though, I wanted to take a
[36:19.160 --> 36:24.280]  look at what is happening at the TSA, but actually we're
[36:24.280 --> 36:29.880]  going to be joined now by Alex Jones, who is reporting from Toronto, Canada.
[36:29.880 --> 36:35.640]  Alex. David, I am standing here from an island
[36:35.640 --> 36:39.720]  off the coast of Toronto, Canada, looking at people
[36:39.720 --> 36:43.320]  having a great time playing tennis, playing badminton,
[36:43.320 --> 36:47.080]  swimming in one of the major great lakes here,
[36:47.080 --> 36:51.480]  and it's so picturesque, and it just really makes me
[36:51.480 --> 36:55.560]  at a very deep fundamental level want to protect these people and to want to
[36:55.560 --> 36:59.880]  warn them about what's happening. And it is the fact that people are so
[36:59.880 --> 37:03.800]  innocent, so nice, so friendly of every race, color, creed,
[37:03.800 --> 37:07.480]  nationality. They all just want to have good lives,
[37:07.480 --> 37:10.840]  healthy happy children that contribute to the world.
[37:10.840 --> 37:17.400]  They want to help other people really, really good, and it's because people
[37:17.400 --> 37:21.480]  historically are so blind to the fact that that
[37:21.480 --> 37:25.080]  true evil exists in the world, that it's able to grow
[37:25.080 --> 37:30.920]  and able to breed. And you know, you're up here
[37:30.920 --> 37:35.320]  seeing this for yourself. It's people with the same
[37:35.320 --> 37:40.200]  and it's so sad. It's also very positive for some good things, obviously
[37:40.200 --> 37:44.920]  George Murray's event took the past the crowd of wonderful people.
[37:44.920 --> 37:49.000]  It took about two hours last night to meet great afterwards to shake
[37:49.000 --> 37:55.080]  about a thousand people's hands, and these folks were so awake
[37:55.080 --> 37:59.640]  and so in passion and are taking action on so many fronts
[37:59.640 --> 38:03.480]  it was booing. And so the good news is, yes, the general public is still somewhat
[38:03.480 --> 38:07.400]  asleep, but exponentially they're waking up,
[38:07.400 --> 38:11.720]  and that's why the globalists are accelerating their programs right now.
[38:11.720 --> 38:17.320]  As you know, David, there's a lot happening. I was going to be back today,
[38:17.320 --> 38:21.240]  but because of flights and issues and getting up here late,
[38:21.240 --> 38:24.360]  I am now coming back tomorrow, but I will be
[38:24.360 --> 38:30.520]  filing reports in the morning and live during the show tomorrow with David,
[38:30.520 --> 38:35.560]  actually from my staff computer before the airports. I will be co-hosting part
[38:35.560 --> 38:39.000]  of the show tomorrow. I just wanted to give folks an update on that,
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.360]  but what's amazing is when I walk down the street in Austin, Texas, again, this is
[38:42.360 --> 38:46.200]  just a gauge how awake the world is. As I said hundreds of times, the average
[38:46.200 --> 38:49.320]  person who doesn't well know in the Liberty movement
[38:49.320 --> 38:53.560]  doesn't know that people go around. They don't have a way to
[38:53.560 --> 38:57.560]  have sonar or radar or recognition to map that.
[38:57.560 --> 39:07.480]  I do. I think we're losing Alex there. It's
[39:07.480 --> 39:11.080]  breaking up. He's calling us from Canada. Again, he was
[39:11.080 --> 39:15.160]  reporting about the event there that he spoke at,
[39:15.160 --> 39:19.720]  one of the featured speakers there. I think the key speaker, is he back?
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.760]  Okay, go ahead, Alex. Yes, again, I am calling you via cell phone because I'm
[39:24.760 --> 39:34.280]  calling from this island itself, not the city of Toronto.
[39:34.280 --> 39:37.480]  I've only got a few cell bars here. I'm not going to take up
[39:37.480 --> 39:40.360]  too much more time, but I didn't promise to call in and report on the show today,
[39:40.360 --> 39:44.840]  so that's what I'm doing. Bottom line, just now, taking a few
[39:44.840 --> 39:51.720]  minutes off to swim in this great lake, I had
[39:51.720 --> 39:56.040]  no fewer than five people of each of probably
[39:56.040 --> 39:59.720]  30 people, because it's not that busy, come over
[39:59.720 --> 40:04.200]  and shake my hand. One lady was from Canada, another guy was from the US,
[40:04.200 --> 40:09.400]  another lady was from Argentina. Her husband's a big listener.
[40:09.400 --> 40:12.840]  Other folks who barely spoke English were like Alex Jones, Alex Jones,
[40:12.840 --> 40:16.440]  China. I mean, this is what's really exciting,
[40:16.440 --> 40:21.640]  is that the awakening is exponential, and no matter where I go,
[40:21.640 --> 40:25.400]  we are running into people that are awake, whether it's Europe, or whether it's
[40:25.400 --> 40:29.640]  Canada, or whether it's Mexico, or whether it's Honduras.
[40:29.640 --> 40:33.880]  People are awake, and of course there's so many other people waking folks up
[40:33.880 --> 40:37.800]  that have listeners and supporters on the boat. I'm only one small
[40:37.800 --> 40:41.000]  gauge of that, so that's the really exciting news.
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.200]  The bad news is this looks like some type of
[40:44.200 --> 40:49.080]  tit for tat, this China explosion, now this US military base explosion,
[40:49.080 --> 40:52.760]  outside Tokyo, still going off as we speak, just
[40:52.760 --> 40:57.480]  ultramassive event. There's all sorts of black ops going on.
[40:57.480 --> 41:01.480]  Henry Kissinger has come out and said that basically Obama
[41:01.480 --> 41:06.120]  screwed up, pushing Russia too far, and made us look like the bad guys.
[41:06.120 --> 41:09.640]  Of course, he wants to take over, he just doesn't want to fail.
[41:09.640 --> 41:12.760]  And so there's a lot of good things happening, a lot of bad things happening,
[41:12.760 --> 41:17.320]  but we had Mr. Dent and other guests on
[41:17.320 --> 41:20.840]  in the last two months saying they believe the collapse is coming in
[41:20.840 --> 41:24.760]  September or October, and we just had Dent on
[41:24.760 --> 41:28.280]  two weeks ago, and he said within two weeks he would expect the bubble to
[41:28.280 --> 41:31.400]  start collapsing again. There was a dead cat bounce according to
[41:31.400 --> 41:34.920]  his graphs. Well, we just saw a thousand point
[41:34.920 --> 41:38.840]  drop on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and even if they
[41:38.840 --> 41:42.280]  tried to profit back up, it shows. People say, well, it's a bubble, it
[41:42.280 --> 41:44.600]  should go down. Well, absolutely, the problem is
[41:44.600 --> 41:49.320]  we're in trouble even in a bubble. So people are waking up, there's some
[41:49.320 --> 41:51.720]  good things happening. The globalist agenda is
[41:51.720 --> 41:54.040]  failing with Russia. Not that Russia's perfect, but we want
[41:54.040 --> 41:57.560]  there to be a multipolar world, not a single ring to rule them all,
[41:57.560 --> 42:01.080]  Mordor. We want diversity, we want firewalls
[42:01.080 --> 42:04.520]  of nation states against globalists. So a lot of positive things are happening,
[42:04.520 --> 42:08.600]  David, as you know, but also a lot of really negative things are happening
[42:08.600 --> 42:12.200]  as this cascade of events races towards
[42:12.200 --> 42:16.200]  an even bigger event in the near future. George Soros and the White House
[42:16.200 --> 42:21.000]  have revealed that Hillary Clinton is involved with her senior staffers,
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.480]  as well as Nancy Pelosi staffers with Black Lives Matter,
[42:25.480 --> 42:28.840]  trying to stir everyone up and get everybody fighting with each other.
[42:28.840 --> 42:32.200]  It really is an amazing thing to see what's happening and all these
[42:32.200 --> 42:36.200]  different confluences of events, the stars
[42:36.200 --> 42:40.600]  online politically, are coming up. And the good news is just take the
[42:40.600 --> 42:45.560]  abortion videos. Just take those, David.
[42:45.560 --> 42:50.520]  Oh, absolutely. Notice how 70% of people in polls are higher
[42:50.520 --> 42:54.120]  want to stop these abortions now. So notice they've gone in, they've
[42:54.120 --> 42:58.360]  gotten the videos, and they're heroes. I mean good people can push back.
[42:58.360 --> 43:02.280]  They're being told that Snowden's window for a plea bargain deal is closing.
[43:02.280 --> 43:04.920]  Bloomberg reports a national security specialist saying,
[43:04.920 --> 43:07.880]  many people in government believe that journalists who receive Snowden's
[43:07.880 --> 43:11.560]  material are not capable of protecting it from a competent and
[43:11.560 --> 43:15.400]  committed state-level adversary. Even if Snowden did not give the
[43:15.400 --> 43:18.840]  material to others, they argue it would have been ripe for the picking.
[43:18.840 --> 43:22.440]  Well, isn't that true of Hillary's handling of emails? Didn't her violation
[43:22.440 --> 43:27.400]  of protocol expose above top secret data to state-level adversaries?
[43:27.400 --> 43:30.520]  Snowden exposed criminal actions of our government
[43:30.520 --> 43:35.640]  done in the name of national security. Hillary compromised national security
[43:35.640 --> 43:39.640]  for her own convenience or to cover up her misdeeds.
[43:39.640 --> 43:43.000]  If national security is more important than the Constitution,
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.520]  if national security is more important than our rights,
[43:46.520 --> 43:51.560]  why isn't Hillary being prosecuted? Why is Snowden called a traitor?
[43:51.560 --> 43:55.400]  And Hillary Clinton is called presidential material.

[47:21.880 --> 47:29.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. I'm coming to you from Lake Ontario, one of the great lakes
[47:29.640 --> 47:34.520]  about here on Little Island. I decided to take half the day off and come over here and investigate
[47:34.520 --> 47:38.520]  and talk to folks. Let me tell you, it's one of the prettiest places I've ever been.
[47:38.520 --> 47:43.720]  This is an amazing creation that God made and I just look at the people, the little dogs swimming.
[47:44.680 --> 47:49.000]  I'm in the interior of the small island now. There's people playing badminton and
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.960]  just hanging out. It's like a small town here. The houses look like hobbits could be walking
[47:53.960 --> 47:58.840]  out of them at any minute. I'm here to tell you, I'm not being paid by the tourism board of Canada,
[47:59.720 --> 48:04.360]  but this is definitely somewhere that I'll be taking the family vacationing next summer.
[48:04.360 --> 48:09.000]  Now I know why so many Texans like to come up to the great lakes of Michigan and Minnesota,
[48:09.720 --> 48:13.960]  but also right up here in Canada. This definitely takes the cake. I have a really
[48:13.960 --> 48:18.920]  serious next hour coming up. I'm joining you via cell phone. David Knight is in the radio slash TV
[48:18.920 --> 48:24.440]  studio in Austin, Texas. I want to thank him for the fabulous job, not filling in, not filling in
[48:24.440 --> 48:31.400]  for me, but doing as good a job or better than I did. But again, I will be back tomorrow. David
[48:31.400 --> 48:35.320]  will be co-hosting much of the show with me, but I'll be co-hosting from Canada. I'll be back
[48:35.320 --> 48:39.400]  tomorrow night, trying to get back to what I was saying earlier when my cell phone was cutting out.
[48:39.400 --> 48:46.440]  What I'm getting at is this. We are at a critical crossroads. Everyone knows that we
[48:46.440 --> 48:50.600]  keep warning everybody about it, and now it becomes clear and clear that we're right,
[48:51.320 --> 48:55.960]  and that serious things are about to break loose, the good, the bad, and the extremely,
[48:55.960 --> 49:01.560]  extremely ugly. Now is the time to get our houses in order, to get right with God,
[49:01.560 --> 49:05.400]  to be thinking about what's happening, but to also kind of change the destiny of the world
[49:05.400 --> 49:12.120]  by taking action. God gives us free will. God sets out a course and a general path,
[49:12.120 --> 49:18.440]  and works through good people, the corrupt forces to the bad. But we decide much of what
[49:18.440 --> 49:23.720]  happens in our universe, in our world, and I'm glad I went on this trip because I would never
[49:23.720 --> 49:29.960]  watch a children's movie like Tomorrowland, especially as George Clooney's in it, even
[49:29.960 --> 49:35.400]  though I was in a movie he produced as Canter Darkly. I figured it was all global warming
[49:35.400 --> 49:40.680]  propaganda because of the ads I'd seen, and I probably should have gone and seen it. I just
[49:40.680 --> 49:45.240]  can't stand more propaganda. Well, I ended up watching it on the plane as I decided to do
[49:45.240 --> 49:50.520]  some research. I said, okay, I'll watch it, bit my lip, something told me watch it. Overall,
[49:50.520 --> 49:55.960]  I've got to really watch this film again and do a whole report on it, very positive on the surface.
[49:55.960 --> 50:03.080]  It exposes revelation of the method, a breakaway civilization that has culled the greatest minds
[50:03.080 --> 50:09.720]  of children since the 1940s into a breakaway program 100 times bigger than the Manhattan Project
[50:11.160 --> 50:17.400]  that is operating outside of the general public's knowledge on government reservations,
[50:18.360 --> 50:25.000]  and they decided to go ahead and not give people the advanced technology. They decided to keep the
[50:25.000 --> 50:31.400]  life extension and everything else for themselves, and in the process of that, because of the brain
[50:31.400 --> 50:37.960]  brain from the planet into the elite, the world is about to basically destroy itself with nuclear
[50:37.960 --> 50:43.400]  war with the computer probabilities, but then they basically are able to take out the bad guys,
[50:43.400 --> 50:48.360]  the elite, that want to hoard all the power for themselves and are able to reverse the probability
[50:48.360 --> 50:53.400]  of humans destroying themselves. This film is extremely powerful. I don't know if it's good
[50:53.400 --> 50:59.000]  or bad. It's very, very heavy. It's easy. It has product placement in it, propaganda placement,
[50:59.960 --> 51:04.120]  where all the heroes are women, and of course, that's a new directive. I'm not against one of
[51:04.120 --> 51:08.760]  the heroes' movies. I have two daughters. I love it. The problem is, it's a directive admitted
[51:09.880 --> 51:15.080]  by the United Nations Unesco program. If folks look into that, video games, you name it. So,
[51:15.080 --> 51:19.800]  it's all part of our media being controlled. So, this is a propaganda film, but it's also
[51:19.800 --> 51:24.520]  the elite saying that they were basically wrong and that they don't want to kill everybody. It's
[51:24.520 --> 51:29.400]  kind of like the last Superman movie was the same story about eugenics. So, are they conditioning
[51:29.400 --> 51:37.320]  us? So, we're subconsciously ready to accept it? Or are people rebelling within the system
[51:37.320 --> 51:41.720]  and putting films out like this? The only bad thing is, it puts out a very truthful message
[51:41.720 --> 51:45.720]  so that you're subconsciously taken in. People already know subconsciously about the breakaway
[51:45.720 --> 51:52.920]  civilization. The problem is that it then puts the lie of global warming at the heart of it
[51:52.920 --> 51:58.200]  and the way to save the earth. So, very, very sophisticated propaganda. I'm going to have to
[51:58.200 --> 52:05.000]  really watch it again and come to my final judgment. But it is extremely heavy and
[52:06.520 --> 52:10.600]  is about human empowerment, the final equation. I think that's why the film probably didn't do
[52:10.600 --> 52:16.760]  too well and a lot of folks didn't really understand it because it's dealing with some things that
[52:16.760 --> 52:21.560]  are so real world, it would make your head spin. But that's basically it. I've got a lot more to
[52:21.560 --> 52:26.520]  report on the show tomorrow where I'll be in the hotel room. So, it'll be nice and clear,
[52:27.560 --> 52:32.360]  HD audio, probably video with David Knight and then Lord willing, I'll be back in the US tomorrow.
[52:32.920 --> 52:38.200]  Again, just the super good news is the super good news that people are even more awake,
[52:38.200 --> 52:43.080]  it seems, in Canada than when I see in the United States. Just patriots are everywhere,
[52:43.080 --> 52:47.640]  so don't feel alone out there, ladies and gentlemen. Keep speaking out, keep taking action.
[52:47.640 --> 52:51.720]  We can turn this thing around with God's help, but we have to take the first step.
[52:51.720 --> 52:55.800]  I should not want to thank everybody. Also, the supports this broadcast, the wonderful team we
[52:55.800 --> 53:01.080]  have. It is such a blessing, all the affiliates we have. There is a ton of news obviously coming up.
[53:01.080 --> 53:11.080]  I followed a report on Saturday, seems like a million years ago, but it was just yesterday.
[53:12.920 --> 53:15.880]  It was actually Friday evening when I first got to Denver,
[53:16.680 --> 53:22.040]  because that's where I flew for it. And they had reported first, it was tumor range that had
[53:22.040 --> 53:26.440]  tackled and stopped the shooter. And of course, later they said it was one Army, one Air Force.
[53:26.440 --> 53:31.400]  It doesn't matter who they were, whether they were military or not. They took action and took
[53:31.400 --> 53:36.520]  the gun away from the guy and then got cut up by his box cutter, but stopped him. And that's such
[53:36.520 --> 53:43.480]  an important story because do you really believe on not one, not two, but three different aircraft
[53:43.480 --> 53:48.920]  on 9-11 that everyone didn't fight back? I mean, I'm going to tell you right now, I don't think
[53:48.920 --> 53:56.600]  that was got around, but if people jump up with box cutters or whatever on board an airplane with me,
[53:56.600 --> 54:00.760]  and there's three of them, I'm going to fight back if I'm by myself. I mean, think about it,
[54:01.560 --> 54:05.880]  if you're on a plane and you're rude to some guy, he'll threaten to kick your butt. I mean,
[54:05.880 --> 54:10.200]  people who I've grown up and all over the country, you mess with them, they'll fight you, I don't
[54:10.200 --> 54:14.760]  care what color they are, where they're from. I just fundamentally don't believe 9-11 because
[54:14.760 --> 54:20.840]  of things like that, but also the FBI admitted that none of the high altitude phone calls
[54:20.840 --> 54:25.640]  were really made. The only real ones were from air phones, and both stewardesses,
[54:25.640 --> 54:29.880]  Flotathan had said there was gas, smoke, they couldn't breathe. They were being nerve-gassed.
[54:30.440 --> 54:34.680]  We don't know exactly what happened on 9-11, but we know the official story isn't true,
[54:34.680 --> 54:39.240]  and we now know they're suppressing Saudi Arabian involvement and our government standing down.
[54:39.240 --> 54:44.600]  But again, the good news is the truth is coming out. Well, thanks for putting up with me on cell
[54:44.600 --> 54:48.440]  phones. Sorry to David the crew. I tried to get to the place where audio Skype would work,
[54:48.440 --> 54:53.000]  but the whole next hour is going to be extremely informative with a major whistleblower. Don't
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.160]  you have a big whistleblower coming on, David? Yes, Alex. We have Thomas Drake. He was the only
[54:57.160 --> 55:03.240]  whistleblower from the NSA to have the Justice Department try to put him in jail. Of course,
[55:03.240 --> 55:07.560]  it was Lanny Brewer, the guy who said the banks who were laundering money were too big to jail,
[55:07.560 --> 55:13.000]  but they came after him for the same things that Hillary Clinton has been doing. They alleged that
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.720]  he mishandled classified documents. He really didn't, but she really is, and they're doing
[55:17.720 --> 55:23.400]  everything to avoid going after her. Wow. Yeah, of course, we've got Hillary that's in deep trouble.
[55:24.040 --> 55:29.240]  We've got 9-11 coming out. We've got the insider trading coming out all over the world.
[55:29.960 --> 55:35.400]  We've got the Vatican being blackmailed coming out. I mean, really, everything
[55:35.400 --> 55:39.960]  is being revealed. They're cutting the floor right out of the water now that they've announced.
[55:39.960 --> 55:44.120]  I mean, really, David, we're having victories on every front, so I want to thank the audience
[55:44.120 --> 55:47.640]  because you are the heart and the tip of the spear of the Liberty Movement worldwide.
[55:47.640 --> 55:51.400]  Info wars, you are the power. The listeners of this transmission,
[55:51.400 --> 55:55.800]  what a brain trust, what an honor, and what a responsibility for all of us.
[55:55.800 --> 56:00.120]  David Knight, thanks so much. I'm going to turn the show back over to you. I'll see you tomorrow.
[56:00.120 --> 56:04.040]  Thank you, Alex. Again, that's Alex Jones reporting from Toronto, and he'll be joining us
[56:04.040 --> 56:09.400]  tomorrow on the radio program as well. As we pointed out in the next hour, Thomas Drake is
[56:09.400 --> 56:14.680]  going to be with us talking about his experiences, what he saw at the NSA, why we should be concerned
[56:14.680 --> 56:19.480]  about the encroachment on our freedoms, the destruction of the Constitution.
[56:20.040 --> 56:26.120]  He had this to say when he got an award from the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity Intelligence.
[56:26.120 --> 56:32.440]  He quoted from Frederick Douglass in part of Frederick Douglass's 1857 speech and basically
[56:32.440 --> 56:35.640]  paraphrased it with some references. He said,
[56:35.640 --> 56:39.240]  Power and those in control concede nothing without a demand.
[56:39.800 --> 56:44.520]  They never have, they never will. Each and every one of us must keep demanding,
[56:44.520 --> 56:50.200]  must keep fighting, must keep thundering, must keep plowing. We must keep on keeping things
[56:50.200 --> 56:56.040]  struggling. We must speak out and speak up until justice is served because where there is no justice,
[56:56.040 --> 57:02.920]  there is no peace. He put his life on the line. It ruined his career. They tried to lock him up for
[57:02.920 --> 57:08.360]  the rest of his natural life. This is a man who has ever been as much a hero as the people who
[57:08.360 --> 57:13.960]  charged the gunman in that train this weekend. We're going to talk to him in the next hour.
[57:13.960 --> 57:18.040]  In the next segment, we're going to lay some background of the Espionage Act because he's
[57:18.040 --> 57:21.800]  one of the few people who have been charged with that. Most of those people who have been charged
[57:21.800 --> 57:26.440]  with the Espionage Act have been charged by the Obama administration. More people than all
[57:26.440 --> 57:37.720]  the previous 100 years of presidents combined. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[57:37.720 --> 57:53.320]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for info wars listeners. We've confirmed through

[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:16.760]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:21.960]  David Knight your host today. Joining us in the next segment is Thomas Drake an SA whistleblower.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:29.640]  He is the fourth person to have been charged under the 1917 Espionage Act. This is something that
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:39.400]  as Bloomberg points out since 2009 President Obama has charged nine people under the 1917 Espionage
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:46.200]  Act with passing classified information to media outlets. This is something that was never done
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:51.480]  before. There were only two people prior to that. The first person to be charged in that way of course
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:56.280]  is Daniel Ellsberg with the Pentagon Papers. The Nixon administration went after him. When this was
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:02.840]  passed in 1917 Woodrow Wilson said this was going to go after naturalized citizens. In other words
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:06.920]  this is not for you Americans. Don't be worried about this. We're going to get involved in foreign
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:12.520]  wars for the first time and we're going to pass all kinds of censorship rules but this is not for
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.240]  you. This is for naturalized citizens he said who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:22.280]  very arteries of our national life but of course that's not the way it's being used now. It was
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:28.120]  rarely used to go after alleged leakers of classified information until 1973 when they went after
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:34.440]  Daniel Ellsberg. Prior to that they had in the war in the time after World War I they had gone
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:39.800]  after people who had passed information to foreign powers. People who were spies.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:47.160]  In 1917 however it was a little bit different. Shortly after they passed this Espionage Act
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:52.840]  they used it against Eugene Debs. He was the person who was a five-time presidential candidate
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:58.200]  for the Socialist Party. A lot of people talk about that because he was opposing the war.
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:04.040]  He was targeted. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He served five years before his
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:09.160]  sentence was commuted but I want to talk to you about the second person who was charged under
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:17.240]  the Espionage Act. This is a man Robert Goldstein. He produced a film. That's what he was charged
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:25.320]  under the Espionage Act of Woodrow Wilson for. The film was a spirit of 76. It was done in 1917.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:30.920]  It was about the American Revolutionary War. It was a silent film. He would later go to prison
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:37.800]  for making this silent film. Let me tell you why. Woodrow Wilson had a lot of pushback against
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:43.720]  being involved in foreign wars. We now have an American Empire that is doing one undeclared
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:49.320]  war after the other. We have multiple wars going on at the same time. They're pushing so hard to
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:55.160]  try to start a war with Russia that even Henry Kissinger is pushing back against this. He's a
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:03:00.440]  globalist. He's a long-term globalist but he doesn't want to see even that. So even Henry
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:05.400]  Kissinger is pushing back against what they are currently doing right now. It is absolute madness.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:11.560]  But in 1917, Woodrow Wilson was trying to convince the American people to break with a
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:17.240]  long-standing American tradition of avoiding foreign entanglements. So he was very sensitive to
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:22.440]  anything that would undermine what he perceived to be the raw, raw patriotism of the war.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:31.080]  This film, Spirit of 76, premiered in Chicago in May of 1917, just one month after the U.S.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:36.360]  entered World War I on the side of Britain. The head of the Chicago Police Censorship Board,
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:42.280]  and get this guy's name, Metallus Lucullus Cicero Funkhouser. But more importantly,
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:47.800]  the fact that there's a Chicago Police Censorship Board, they confiscated the film at the behest of
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:53.080]  the Justice Department on grounds that it generated hostility towards Britain, who were our allies
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.040]  at the time. Goldstein trimmed the offending scenes and he received federal approval to
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:03.000]  continue the Chicago run. And the offending scenes were things showing British soldiers
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.880]  banning babies, things that largely fictional, though there were a couple of real massacres
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:12.760]  that were depicted in the film. Nevertheless, it was over-the-top fiction in the film.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:18.040]  And Woodrow Wilson thought that it would turn people against our British allies. So he excised
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.680]  that in Chicago, but when they premiered the film in LA a few months later, the deleted
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.760]  scenes were then restored. After an investigation, the government concluded that Goldstein's actions
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:32.920]  constituted, quote, abating and abetting the German army. They seized the film, they sentenced him
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:37.560]  to 10 years in jail, a $5,000 fine, understand that'd be about a half a million dollars today.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:43.800]  And he couldn't claim the First Amendment because the Supreme Court had ruled in 1915
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.040]  that movies didn't fall under First Amendment protection. Interesting, isn't it? They overruled
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:54.120]  that in 1952, another illustration of how we cannot trust the Supreme Court to be honest about the
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:58.200]  Constitution. But Thomas Drake is honest about the Constitution. He'll be joining us right after
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:04.600]  the break. For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits

[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:22.040]  and the GCN Radio Network. Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:28.440]  Joining us now is Thomas Drake, one of the NSA whistleblowers that went public about the
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:35.400]  dragnet surveillance and the way that the NSA was ignoring the law, ignoring the Constitution
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:41.960]  after September 11th. I want to introduce Mr. Drake, but before I do, I want to let you know

[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:24.360]  Supermail Vitality back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com. Now joining us now is Thomas Drake.
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:29.400]  Mr. Drake is a whistleblower who has dedicated his life to safeguarding his country. He's a 10-year
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:34.600]  veteran of the Air Force. He specialized in intelligence. He served as a CIA analyst and
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:40.120]  a contractor for the National Security Agency, the NSA, for 12 years before joining full-time
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:46.760]  in 2001. And actually it was on September 11th, was his very first day there, unlike Chris Christie,
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:52.120]  who says that he joined on September 11th. We'll talk about that. When Drake saw mass waste and
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:56.440]  abuse at the—and billions of dollars being spent on Operation Stellar Wind, he took his
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:02.040]  concerns to superiors in the NSA. He tried to go through channels. He was stonewalled by his
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:07.240]  superiors in the NSA. Nothing happened with the congressional reviews. After a while, he thought
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:13.080]  that the public had a right to know. So he took this to a Baltimore Sun reporter. He made legal
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:18.520]  disclosures of unclassified information. She wrote a series of award-winning articles that
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:26.120]  exposed the billion-dollar boondoggle at the NSA. Then the Empire struck back. We saw a reprisal.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:31.640]  Drake was ratcheted up to the maximum criminal prosecution they could get under the Espionage
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.680]  Act. In 1917, the government conducted an armed raid of his home. They interrogated him for hours,
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.360]  confiscated his personal notes and computers, threatened him with spending the rest of his
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:47.240]  natural life behind bars. They charged him, of course, with retention of classified material,
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:53.080]  not disclosure, not passing it to someone else. So we're going to talk to him about the parallels
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:59.640]  and what they accused him of and what it appears that Hillary Clinton has done. But before we do
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:05.560]  that, welcome, Mr. Drake. Thanks for having me. I wanted to—I really appreciate you coming on.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:12.360]  You're one of my heroes. I can't say that enough. Someone who put their life on the line because you
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:19.080]  understood really what was at stake. You've, for many years, you watched the Stasi operating in
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:23.400]  East Germany, just like William Benny did. You were very concerned about where we're headed.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.960]  I look at this and there's so many Americans don't really see the danger
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.200]  in what is going on and how we're slipping into this dark surveillance state.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:38.040]  What can you tell us about what you saw with the East Germans, with Stasi and
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:42.360]  State and what you're concerned about happening here in America? What are the dangers? What is
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:47.880]  it going to be like for Americans? Well, the dangers, we don't learn the dark lessons of our
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:56.120]  own past, and that's rather recent history. How easy it is to drift into dystopia and let others
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:05.640]  take over and take charge. That was a police state. It reigned with fear. It kept enormous records
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:11.000]  on the essentially entire population as well as many other people outside of East Germany.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.720]  I didn't spend all those years listening in on the communications of East Germany without
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:21.640]  it affecting me in terms of what it meant for history. I just never imagined that I'd find
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:30.120]  myself shortly after 9-11 essentially discovering that the United States had borrowed the playbook
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:37.240]  as it were from the Stasi and under the cover of 9-11, which is an enormous failure, although
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:43.960]  some would say it was, you don't let a crisis go to waste in the infamous words of Rahm Emanuel,
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:50.520]  former chief of staff for Obama, never let the crisis go to waste. They ended up suspending
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:56.920]  the Constitution. Part of suspending the Constitution is the actions they took in the deepest of
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:02.920]  secrecy that I ended up finding out about. It was Pandora's box opening up, and when you're
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:09.720]  staring into Pandora's box, the deep of this stares back at you. You have that choice, your
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:15.800]  own moral agency as to what you do. You could attempt to close the box and delete on the box
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:22.120]  and act as if nothing happened, or do you actually take action? I had taken an oath for the fourth
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:28.280]  time to support and defend the Constitution, a piece of paper, but the fundamental principles
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:35.320]  in terms of how we govern ourselves. I would not break faith without oath. I would not.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.920]  And you had a very comfortable existence. You had a family. I read that you had a
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:45.320]  young son who was sick of the time. I mean, you're looking at this, and you've got to make
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:50.280]  some hard decisions. You're doing this in secret. As I was pointing out before, in parallel to the
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.320]  heroes who took down the gunmen on the French train, they said they were acting on instinct.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.280]  And of course, they see this guy's going to shoot them, going to shoot everybody if they
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:03.240]  don't do something. But you're in an environment where it's very easy to just take the easy way
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:09.320]  out to rationalize that this is what the people in authority want, and so I should do as I'm
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:16.360]  ordered. You've got to be feeling those kinds of pressures to rationalize that. I think there's a
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:22.680]  lot of people that don't see the long-term view of what's going to happen with this. It's very
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.760]  easy for people to rationalize that and to say, I want to stay comfortable. I want to take care
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:31.560]  of my family. I'll just obey the government. I'll be a good citizen. I'll be very quiet.
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.760]  Right, but citizens have a fundamental responsibility.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:40.040]  Yes, they really do. And if you don't, guess what? Don't be surprised at others who are more than
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:47.880]  willing to abscond with power and then end up having power over you. History's not kind when it
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:55.880]  comes to power exercised abusively over others. We've just seen way too much in human history.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:01.240]  It's sometimes challenging even for me, even today, not to get too cynical about all this.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:06.360]  On the other hand, that arc of history does bend toward justice. I know it may be uneven and it
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:13.000]  may divert and may take tangents of time. It does bend. And there I was. I mean, that was a moment
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.440]  of truth for me, frankly. And it's what I've shared. I serve as inspiration for others. I
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.640]  realized I was able to hold off the government. I realized I did not end up in prison for all
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.960]  that they attempted to do with me over a number of years to punish me so severely for literally
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:37.160]  speaking truth to power. But those are choices that are made. And I'm standing up in the public
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:41.880]  interest and for history. You're an eyewitness to secret history, recognizing those choices
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.720]  that were made by the highest levels of our government, up to and including the White House,
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.200]  would have enormous downstream strategic consequences.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:52.600]  You know, when I look at you and I look at the other whistleblowers like Jesslyn Radek,
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:57.880]  who was a whistleblower herself and wound up defending you and others, John Kiriakou, William
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:04.040]  Benny, I haven't had the pleasure of talking to Jesslyn Radek or John Kiriakou, but I have had the
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:09.240]  pleasure of talking to William Benny. And I think many of us on the outside, when we look at these,
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:14.280]  the dragnet surveillance of the NSA, when we look at their retaliation against you and the fact that
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.320]  they never do anything to come after the people who are committing the crimes and the crimes are
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:24.680]  exposed by whistleblowers like you, instead, they retaliate against you. So we look at that and
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:30.920]  many of us on the outside say, well, you know, this is just a nest of snakes. But when I see you
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:35.160]  and I see William Benny and I talk to you, I understand that there are some good people
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:40.840]  on the inside. And that is one of the things that it gives me hope. It really does give me hope to
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.960]  see principal people like you, principal people like William Benny. I wanted to get your reaction
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:50.600]  to this, Mr. Drake. There was something that was revealed in the Snowden leaks. It was put
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:56.040]  up on the Intercept. It was a document asking, are you the Socrates of the National Security
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:15:00.200]  Agency? I don't know if you saw this article or not, but it was something that they had floated
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:07.480]  around internally. They wanted people to look at this and to make a case for mass surveillance,
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:14.360]  for the government watching everyone. And this individual, it reminded me of the Stasi
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:19.400]  situation in East Germany, where everybody was spying on everyone else. Everyone was paranoid
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:23.480]  and concerned that they were being watched. And one of the things that he says that one of the
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.560]  many thoughts that continually went through my mind, and this is an NSA employee, was that if I
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:31.400]  had revealed part of my personal life to my employer, I'd really rather reveal it all because
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:38.920]  partial revelation might lead to misunderstanding. And so he says he embraced total surveillance
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:45.160]  of him because he thought it would exonerate him. That's an amazing, I want to get your reaction
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:51.880]  to that because it sounds to me like Norman Bates in the basement of the police station
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:56.360]  after they caught him. Stay with us, we'll be right back with Thomas Drake in SA Whistleblower.

[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:22.120]  You're listening to the alex jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:31.400]  it's alex jones on the GCN radio network. Welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:37.480]  we have with us thomas drake and as a whistleblower i want to go through the chronology of what happened
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:42.760]  with him as he was one of the few people in our country to be charged under the espionage act
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:48.920]  for allegedly mishandling classified information something that hillary clinton is notably not
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:56.040]  being charged for but before we do i wanted to ask mr drake mr drake i came across these things
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:00.520]  we're talking about before we went to the break this is a document that came out of the snowden
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:05.480]  leaks reported in the intercept and i want to read you this quote of what this nsa employee said
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:09.160]  he said he was concerned that if people knew only a few things about him
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:14.920]  he might seem suspicious but if people knew everything about him they would see that he had
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:20.680]  they had nothing to fear from him he said this is the attitude i have brought to sig at work
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:27.800]  since then i mean i look at that and is that the attitude you saw at the uh east in east germany
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:34.600]  under the stasi is that a mindset that you saw at the nsa well it's certainly those uh you know
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:39.960]  that serve serve serve the secrecy system the secrecy regime i mean this is where national
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:45.880]  security as a member is like as i call the state religion and you don't question it it's it is your
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:54.680]  authority and uh when you're subject to it and serving it then you confess uh all there is you
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:59.800]  give up your sovereignty uh to the state and that's precisely how the stasi operate remember
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:03.880]  they were the short and the short and sword in the shield of the state uh they were not
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:09.960]  operating the best interest of people in fact people were considered to be threats there anybody
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:14.840]  was suspicious including people even within their own system yeah that was one of the things we saw
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:18.840]  with uh chris christy in the back and forth with ram paul he said well of course we have to do
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:25.320]  dragnet surveillance on everybody otherwise how we know who who have to come after i mean everybody
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:29.560]  is guilty they have to prove their innocence they have to vet themselves and that's that's the
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:33.240]  attitude we see from this guy inside the nsa and that's the attitude of people like chris christy
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:39.240]  and those who who prosecute this dragnet surveillance isn't it that's why this has far less to do with
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:45.240]  you know terrorism which has been the covering color for all of this as you excuse and it's far
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:51.320]  more about social control yes mass surveillance is about social control yes yes absolutely i don't
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:55.400]  have to elaborate i don't have to get into philosophical discussions about it that's precisely what it is
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:02.040]  absolutely i will also have some questions here people who have uh on twitter using the hashtag
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:06.120]  ask drake they've given us some questions i want to go over some of those as well but first let's
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:11.160]  lay out what happened in your particular case so you began at the nsa you've had an intelligence
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:16.280]  background within the air force uh you've also worked with them off and on but you began work your
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:22.440]  actual first day that your report is september 11th 2001 as that is all happening uh tell us
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:28.760]  so what you were brought in to do and and what you saw there well in some ways i was you know an
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:37.160]  accidental hire um however the congress in particular the key stakeholder uh overseeing nsa had been
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:41.320]  grown very very concerned over the intervening years particularly in the post cold war era about
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:46.440]  nsa's viability its ability to remain relevant and it was increasingly having difficulty keeping
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:51.320]  up with the challenges of the digital age and internet and so they put a lot of pressure on
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:24:00.760]  nsa and nsa very reluctantly and digging in their heels uh went went ahead and decided to uh hire
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.600]  people from the outside and that's been meaning people that were not brought up there were not
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:11.240]  promoted to the senior ranks from within side their their own system and i was one of about a
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:17.720]  dozen people that were hired in over about a six month or so period just prior to 9 11 and i was
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:22.920]  hired in as a senior change leader that was actually my first title and i reported to the
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:30.840]  number three person and 9 11 was my first day i was about 10 000 people in terms of signal
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:36.840]  the signals intelligence directorate it's the offensive side of nsa and i was to get to know
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:43.720]  the ropes fall follow the signals intelligence director around make recommendations uh help nsa
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:49.800]  um move into the 21st century country there's been a number of failures there's been a number of
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:55.240]  studies um that they were falling behind and increasingly the choices they were making was
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:01.960]  to simply marry themselves uh to the military industrial complex and spend billions and
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.680]  billions of dollars uh to buy the solution instead of taking the very best of american
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:14.120]  ingenuity innovation of necessity being the mother of invention uh very very low cost programs that
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:20.520]  has super high impact and put that very best into the fight and of course that uh low cost
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:25.480]  very effective program was the one that william benney had done called thin thread that essentially
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:29.480]  didn't make the haystack bigger so it's hard to find the needles it actually helped you to
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:36.040]  find the needles but they they passed that over for a program that was done outside and that was
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.280]  michael haze's decision is that correct well that was a fundamental choice it was a buy versus
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:45.960]  make decision he made in uh spring of 2000 it was about a year and a half for 9 11 and he just said
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:52.200]  bay you know i'm just going to spend billions uh with with the military intelligence congressional
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:58.920]  complex as i put it as bill benney says the happiness management complex um and to spend and
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:04.280]  that's it was it was an extraordinary amount of money and so people are you know belling up to
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:11.080]  the trailblazer bar trailblazer was the the main flywheel contract to nsa was going to use to
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.840]  catapult itself to the tour for a century it really became a funding vehicle for all kinds of
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:22.120]  contractors uh it never did deliver it actually uh died uh in 2006 but of course it involved a lot
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:29.400]  of companies like ibm saic boeing csc they made billions off of this right but this as i said
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.880]  9 11 became a profit center uh for any number of companies i mean this this goes all the way back
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:38.280]  that's something eisenhower inch enough actually warned the nation about during his farewell address
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.360]  which was largely ignored at the time but it's become one of those uh
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:48.680]  points in history in terms of a warning to the nation because he realized that what he had unleashed
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:54.280]  from the 50s would probably have uh negative consequences going forward that in essence
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.560]  you would be beholden to secret power and vast amounts of money to be operating not in the public
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:04.520]  interest but operating its own political and self interest absolutely so and power protects itself i
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:08.840]  mean this this is one of the simple things that i tell people you have to remember this kind of power
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:13.880]  especially secret power especially power involving military especially power involving intelligence
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:17.960]  intelligence itself you know information is power and when you can control that when you can make
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:23.560]  money off it when you can sell it with yourself and to others well then you you know it's very
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:29.640]  it's very heady and so you want to protect that power not too many people can uh can come around
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:35.240]  that without being corrupted and sucked into that that's why i swear a lord actin i know power does
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:40.680]  tend to corrupt because it will corrupt but it tends to absolutely okay so i want to talk a little
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:45.240]  bit about uh i won't talk about 9 11 but before we do i want to finish this chronology when you're
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:51.160]  there key things then that you're blowing the whistle about eventually are this massive wasteful
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.400]  program that is also ineffective i guess when we look at this when we talk about a lot of
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:02.760]  medical issues we always look about safety and efficacy right is this medicine going to kill me
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:06.680]  that's why we have the constitution trying to keep the government from killing us and then we look
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:12.040]  at it or is it going to be effective to try to get the bad things uh you know to get the bad guys
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:17.560]  okay to get the disease and so you were showing that this was uh you were concerned that it was
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:24.440]  violating the constitution that it was ineffective that it was a massive boondoggle so in 2004 is that
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:29.720]  about right you go to internal channels to try to get something done about that actually i started
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:34.440]  much sooner i was actually blowing the whistle with my immediate supervisor the number three person
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:39.640]  the signals intelligence director within just weeks of 9 11 oh okay that's right i'm looking
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:44.600]  at my notes in 2004 that's when the inspector general produced their final report so that was
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:49.320]  after so quite a bit of that had gone on we're talking to thomas drake an essay whistleblower
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:57.400]  stay with us we'll be right back
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:06.840]  is america ready for d's nuts well if the polls are any indication a 15 year old high school
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:13.480]  sophomore from iowa going by the moniker d's nuts is pulling better than most republicans in fact
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:19.080]  d's nuts who takes his name from a punk band is the most popular independent candidate since ross
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:25.480]  perot also known as brady olson d's nuts says his mission is to give americans an alternative to the
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:32.360]  two-party system in 2016 d's nuts is more popular than fiorina huckabee and walker and there's been
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:37.480]  no word from the candidates on how it feels being beaten by d's nuts in the polls but if you had to
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:43.480]  choose between hillary clinton donald trump or d's nuts who would you vote for now we all know
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:48.280]  how this election is going to play out the new boss will be the same as the old boss but at least
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:55.480]  in the end you can say don't blame me i voted for d's nuts leon macadoo for info wars dot com

[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:44.760]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we're talking to nsa whistleblower
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:51.320]  thomas drake we were just talking about how as he began working at the nsa his first day
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:57.880]  was september 11th 2001 he noticed that things had immediately changed the rules of the game had
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:04.680]  changed mr drake uh talk to us about how things had changed with the faiza court for example
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:12.520]  well that was just one of a number of secret orders uh they were issued uh from the white
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:16.600]  house as well as the other command authorities uh underneath the white house in the executive
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:22.440]  branch of the government i don't think people yet fully appreciate precisely what 9-11 triggered
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:29.960]  i said for all intents and purposes uh 9-11 was the trigger in which the government in secret
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:34.760]  suspended the constitution and we were operating under emergency powers ever since every time i
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:39.560]  say that uh people just stare at me most people still stare at me and disbelief they just can't
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:43.960]  imagine that happened but that's effectively what did happen and that's precisely what i
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:49.640]  confront it one of the things they just tossed overboard uh and through through aside was the
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:54.680]  foreign intelligence surveillance act as the secret the secret court uh that was actually
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:35:00.760]  created in 1978 because under the car administration because of severe abuses of executive power
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:05.960]  against americans and violation of the constitution in the the previous decades and of course you
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:10.520]  and i are you and i are about the same age we grew up watching uh the the situation with richard
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:14.760]  nixon we grew up watching the church committee hearings the pike committee hearings brought to
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:18.360]  the public's attention for the first time even the existence of the nsa they've been secretly
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:26.200]  created by an executive order by by president truman and when pike asked the nsa director
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:31.880]  to show the charter that was created by executive order he refused pike was absolutely amazed he's
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:36.840]  already given you billions of dollars of uh funding here and you won't even show us the
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:41.240]  charter that presumes to authorize you i mean that's that's the way the nsa began isn't it
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:46.920]  there was no such agency never say anything i mean for all of its prowess and it's there's a
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:52.120]  lot of history that has still yet to be written you know it it was an intelligence agency it was
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:57.320]  a military intelligence agency it it wasn't formed by congress there was no legislation there was
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:03.640]  there was no bill signed into law by the president it was literally the stroke of a secret pen uh in
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:11.000]  1952 and people just don't fully appreciate what that means and how easy is it uh to abuse that
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.320]  power and you know that came to a head in the 70s that's why for me you know i grew up as a very
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:21.160]  young teenager during the 70s and i remember all of all those abuses of power unfolding people forget
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:28.040]  that the articles of impeachment uh that were that were actually um formulated you know in the house
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:33.720]  representatives you know the against uh presidents and included using instruments of national power
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:38.680]  against the american public violation of the constitution and you know we ultimately had a
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:46.120]  president resigning his office of course nixon you know later said as you may recall uh during
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:52.440]  the interviews the frost interviews uh that you know if the if the president says um it's it's
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:57.320]  it's not legal then it's okay you know it's it's legal i mean if it's if he says it's okay it's legal
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:01.720]  yeah and along those lines i want to play this clip for you and get your reactions again we've had
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:07.000]  michael haden bragging about what he did in the aftermath of this this is a clip from washington
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.440]  and lee university and of course we've had a lot of discussions about section 215 of the patriot act
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:17.400]  they claim that that authorized them to retain all this information from americans to do dragnet
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:23.880]  surveillance the question being of course the patriot act it does it itself obviously violates
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:29.400]  our our rights under the constitution but this is what michael haden had to say about section 215
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:32.360]  all your talk today about 215
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:42.200]  215 is such a safe haven 215 is legislated by congress i was doing metadata collection under
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.960]  the president's raw article two authorities from october 7th 2001 forward that's just so
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:53.720]  amazing to me every time i look at that clip the arrogance of michael haden saying ah 215
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:57.640]  that was a safe haven that was done by the congress of course in violation of the constitution
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:02.760]  then he says i had orders from the president he points to his chest what do we call a a system
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:08.920]  of government where one person makes all the orders mr drake yeah this comes under different
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:15.880]  names but uh you know tyranny totalitarianism uh when you combine it you know what what people
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:21.080]  don't fully appreciate yet is extraordinary partnerships that nsa engaged in had even before
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:26.760]  9 11 with a number of telcos um and other information technology companies but particularly
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:30.680]  the telephone companies uh they've had those partnerships for a long long time those are
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:35.960]  greatly expanded after 9 11 you know that's that's a fascist system um this is what happened i mean
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:42.840]  he he's actually chortling about what the powers that he had yes before things had to be put back
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:48.120]  into the box once they started being exposed in the press yes i guess that's one of these you know
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:53.560]  raw executive authority is not the form of government i took an oath just important in fact
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:59.240]  that's an alien form of government that is a direct threat to our republic absolutely and you can see
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.880]  how much he loves that power in that clip and the other times where he's bragged about this
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:09.560]  so you see this is happening and immediately you start talking to people internally going
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:15.160]  through proper channels this takes a very long time and in 2004 the dod inspector general produces
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:21.320]  their final report tell us about that well the final report that had to do with the the thin
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:27.640]  thread and treblaze requirements and you know it was a secret report there never was a public
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:33.880]  version made until shortly after the conclusion of my criminal case many many years later um but uh
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:39.400]  that that report uh made it clear that you know treblaze was an utter failure and many billions
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:44.280]  of money billions and billions have been spent but that was just one of the channels that i
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:48.680]  that i uh where i blew the whistle i also was a material witness and whistleblower for two nine
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:55.480]  eleven congressional investigations but all of my material evidence all of the the depositions
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:40:01.800]  the the uh the the oral testimony all of it was censored and suppressed in fact as i found out later
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:08.200]  um the only record that exists that anybody can find to date now we're talking 13 over 13
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:14.360]  years later is that i was interviewed all the all the actual evidence apparently is buried what
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:19.320]  i tell you it was so secret that it could even be in the the secret report of the joint inquiry
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:25.560]  so they swapped all that under the rug they kept it secret the constitution was suspended i mean
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.760]  this is what i confronted the general counsel on and i said i said you're asking me to accept
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:36.360]  then and in the name of national security that we can just simply set the set aside the constitution
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.920]  i said there is a there is a constitutional means in this country if the laws aren't working or the
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:46.760]  laws are insufficient we have we had we go to congress and he said if we do that they'll say no
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:51.960]  and what you don't understand mr drake we live in exigent conditions this is emergency conditions
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:58.120]  it was the ends the ends you know justified the means and so we just need the data and maybe
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:02.040]  it was this extraordinary it didn't matter where they got it from it was just and they had the
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:07.240]  authority of the president yeah yeah so we live in an emergency follow order so obviously something
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:12.920]  like me getting in the way standing up it's going to be a marked person and you know i was targeted
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:18.600]  very early on as a troublemaker i was targeted very long as a threat uh to the orders that are
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:24.920]  being handed down and of course they kept this very secret the vast majority of nsa did not know
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:29.160]  that there was this whole other program in which they had literally turned the united states of
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:34.520]  america into the equivalent of a foreign nation for vast dragnet electronic surveillance on an
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:40.040]  extraordinary scale a scale that is still not been fully revealed to this day in spite of even
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:44.360]  the snow disclosures in spite of the disclosures that i made in spite of the disclosures that others
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.040]  made although more information has been coming out and of course that's one of the things that
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:53.800]  scares us so much is the idea that uh they're at war with the entire world including american
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:58.840]  territory when we look at the indefinite detention uh without trial by the u.s military as you pointed
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:05.400]  out of course the nsa uh began and continues as a military intelligence organization those are the
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:11.080]  things that keep us awake at night if we actually look into this abyss and i i want to talk to you
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:19.160]  too about geospatial intelligence and and some of those aspects of of tracking our activity looking
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:24.200]  at our metadata what the consequences of that are we have so many things to discuss i wish we had
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:29.960]  more time i want to continue on though with what happened with your prosecution before we come back
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:37.960]  and uh after you try you hit this stone wall of secrecy in 2005 you contact a reporter and you
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:43.640]  send her some emails and it exposes some of what is going on and then the retaliation starts when

[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:37.880]  september 11th and i want to get to that in this final segment that we have with you as well
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:43.480]  what you saw there you saw a dragnet surveillance you were concerned about the constitutionality
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:48.440]  of that you were concerned about the massive boondoggle waste that was happening you went through
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:53.800]  internal channels you went to the house there was a report filed it was kept secret the public was
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:49:00.200]  not notified then in 2005 now we get to this point you go to a reporter at the baltimore sun
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:06.440]  she writes about what has happened with some of the information that you gave her non classified
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:13.320]  information that you gave her now they get into retaliation mode and in 2007 they raid you
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:18.520]  they raid mr benny and others tell us about that yeah actually contacted a reporter for the first
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:23.880]  time in late february of 2006 anonymously i was well aware of the surveillance system
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:31.080]  and it was clear that when the james reisen eric likblau article was published in december 2005
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:34.920]  new york times revealing for the first time publicly the existence of the so-called warrantless
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:43.320]  uh wiretapping program uh that their people like myself would no doubt become targets uh if they
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:48.280]  launched an investigation they did that two weeks later long story short myself and my colleagues
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.680]  and others became targets because we were some of the few people that actually knew about the
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:57.720]  stellar wind or what came under the president's surveillance program that had been you know in
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:03.480]  the operating the deepest of secrecy since shortly after 9 11 long story shore has put under
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:10.760]  extraordinary surveillance physical and electronic um and my colleagues were raided unceremoniously
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:14.680]  and searched uh in july and then four months later i was getting ready to go down to the
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:21.000]  national defense university where i was teaching and i looked out my window and there's a dozen
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:27.080]  fbi agents streaming across the the front lawn and that's when the nightmare began wow wow and you
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:33.320]  know even though this has been uh this has been released by the whistleblowers and after after
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:43.160]  prosecution as late as 2013 we had james clapper still lying publicly to congress when ron wyden
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:48.200]  asked him about this dragnet surveillance he says no no not to my knowledge and that that
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:53.160]  was just a few months before ed snowden's documents came out they were still maintaining this line
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:57.720]  six years later that they weren't doing this now tell us what they came after you for what they
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:02.840]  alleged to say about a lie you know it travels you know all the way around the world before truth
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:08.520]  even gets its boots on right so you just wait for the lie to come around then you just you know kick
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:15.480]  it that's when you notice it it gets in the way right it runs right into the truth right that's
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:20.200]  right never lie i mean even though they they have uh all this has come out in your trial you know
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:25.240]  years before they they're continuing to hold to this line and tell us about these documents that
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:29.480]  were supposedly classified that you were charged with willful retention of i mean i'm looking at
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:33.880]  some of these titles what a success regular meetings volume is our friend i mean this is
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:38.280]  a kind of management development stuff that you have to set through in some of these corporations
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:43.000]  you know as part of requirement you're you can't stay awake this is ridiculous this is not anything
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.440]  that is even serious it was all a frame job because they wanted to burn somebody i know from
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:54.680]  inside sources cheney had sent out the edict fried but you know find and fry somebody make an example
[01:51:54.680 --> 01:52:00.680]  of them burn them and i was they actually thought that i was a ringleader uh for disclosing the
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:06.520]  secret surveillance programs the program they wanted to keep way off the radar the last thing
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:13.080]  they wanted to people to know was was the public and so they came after me with everything they had
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:19.400]  and uh ironically enough it's the very documents that in a whole or apart i'd given to government
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:26.520]  investigators looking at thin thread uh trailblazer and then and 9 11 intelligence and they're all
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:33.560]  unclassified and so ultimately you know they took them they forced you know forced classification
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:38.680]  review decided they were a super top secret that many of them would cause exceptionally grave damage
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:43.400]  to the united states america the satan ask your united states if it was disclosed and then it took
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:51.080]  on uh from november 2007 all the way until april of 2010 now under obama not under bush but under
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:59.400]  obama to find a way to uh indict me and they indicted me under the 1917 world war one air
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:03.720]  espionage act and that's of course been a favorite of the obama administration he's
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:07.800]  indicted more people under that act than all the previous presidents for the past hundred years
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:13.160]  combined uh lanny lanny brewer was the one who oversaw your prosecution of course he was the one
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:17.240]  who let the banks uh who were doing money laundering for drug cartels and terrorists he let them go
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:23.720]  saying they were too big to jail how do you feel about the parallels between your case and what's
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:30.440]  going on with hillary clinton it's it's surreal i have to tell you it really is and you know i've
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:37.480]  had some some really interesting flashbacks just seeing all this play itself out um you know part
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:42.440]  of me realized the bikes grip and our security that she's in and you know this is you don't trifle
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:46.520]  with classification you don't trifle with secrecy and this is it's a sort of like you know this is
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:51.880]  hardcore religion right you're in violation of the doctrine you're invited you're in violation
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:57.800]  now having said that there is clearly a double standard yes right a huge double standard so in
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:03.320]  my case blowing the whistle not leaking because leaking is not done in the public interest both
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:08.120]  the blowing is you know threats to public safety or health broadways abuse violations of law so
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:12.600]  whistle blowing this case criminalize because you're revealing government
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:17.720]  misconduct and wrongdoing in violation of law including violations of the constitution
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:22.920]  but hey you get to play with the information and send it to your buds and use it for political
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:27.080]  purposes we're going to protect you and of course what hillary clinton did will william
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:30.440]  winard is former director of the information security oversight office that's the people who
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:35.800]  do the classification stuff he said that the stuff that you had should have never been classified
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:39.560]  i mean there's the things like we mentioned before let's have regular meetings volume is
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:45.480]  our friend and everything on the other hand hillary clinton has got intel from foreign leaders
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:49.720]  conversations had with them were intercepted intelligence that the nsa got that's the kind
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:54.280]  of stuff that she has and the same man who said that your stuff never should have been classified
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:59.320]  that they tried to hang you on william winard said that there's a lot of stuff what that hillary
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:04.280]  clinton had that is born classified whether it was mark that way or when she put it on her computer
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:09.800]  or whether that was done later and precisely no i mean it's again this is why it's so surreal
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:15.800]  we're talking about operational intelligence we're talking about uh conduct of foreign affairs
[01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:20.120]  high very high level diplomacy you're you're talking about other other channels of information
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:24.600]  that are extraordinarily sensitive we've only got about she has on a private server you know
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:28.760]  and she apparently it turns out there's a lot of people that she was communicating with
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:34.040]  for you that means absolutely and and so i think uh yeah there is a certainly a security violation
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:38.680]  in her case it certainly was retaliation in yours now we only got a couple of minutes left and i
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:44.360]  i really wanted to get to this earlier on 9 11 you pointed out that you saw that there was
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:49.880]  intelligence that the fbi the cia the nsa had information that they could have stopped this
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:55.880]  beforehand tell us about that well in summary there was critical intelligence that was never
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:56:02.040]  shared properly never acted upon in some cases deliberately so uh they could have stopped 9
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:07.640]  11 dead in its tracks and that's just that's just from the nsa side that doesn't count a lot of the
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:15.240]  other uh failures or or um cover up of information that should have made it uh for action i mean
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:18.920]  look the the government's supposed to provide for the common defense and it utterly failed you know
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:23.720]  the entire system was designed after world war two we would never be surprised again you know the
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:29.720]  quote unquote never would it will you again have an electronic pearl harbor and yet it's clear that
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:34.520]  it was also used you know there was the cheney and company were looking looking for an excuse
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:39.240]  i have to say that i mean i'm i'm aware of a lot of the theories about 9 11 i'm just saying when
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:45.720]  i was nsa you can imagine the the shock of discovering critical intelligence reports
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:50.840]  well with and fold the entire al-qaeda network which i share with all the investigators by the
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:56.680]  way at the time that i had it um when in fact uh if they had been shared it properly it could have
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:01.320]  stopped 9 11 and what does that tell you so 9 11 happens and yet they're you know they're too big
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:07.080]  to fail and all is it a huge intelligence failure and look what unleashed okay that's that is the
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:14.280]  consequence of not providing for the common defense 9 11 happened they knew you as you point out they
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:17.800]  had information they could have stopped it they could have looked they could have made counter
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:24.760]  intelligence a bigger priority they deliberately made that a low priority but of course i believe
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:30.440]  that as as we look at this and and senator graham has also said there's too many coincidences just
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:35.800]  to write this off there had to be somebody kind of quarterbacking this i mean what do you think of
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:40.600]  of things like for example building seven which just happened to fall down without even being hit
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:47.560]  by a plane well there's a lot of controversy about that but also has a lot of secret operations we're
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:58:11.560]  out of time thank you so much Thomas Drake well you
