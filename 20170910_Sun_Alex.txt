[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[00:10.000 --> 00:32.000]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[00:32.000 --> 00:46.000]  First the Eastern Caribbean, then Cuba. Now, Naples, Florida, Marcos Island have been wrecked as the storm has come on the edge of the shore at a Category 3
[00:46.000 --> 00:53.000]  and is pushing a huge storm surge up towards Tampa, set to hit there with its full intensity in the next six hours,
[00:53.000 --> 01:04.000]  but already causing four and five foot storm surge in, but it is not a biblical megastorm like it was five, six days ago out in the Eastern Caribbean,
[01:04.000 --> 01:19.000]  where it would take prosperous islands with large concrete hotel structures and flatten them, making islands uninhabitable, like Barbado and others.
[01:19.000 --> 01:29.000]  So we're going to be tracking all of this today as it unfolds, but a strong hurricane slamming in to southern Western Florida,
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  but it's covering the entire state and is set more and more to go westerly.
[01:34.000 --> 01:43.000]  In fact, some paths have it going ahead after it hits Tampa, bouncing out to sea and could go up towards the Panhandle, Louisiana, Mississippi, or even Texas,
[01:43.000 --> 01:53.000]  but most tracks show it going up the western side, up into Georgia, up into the Carolinas. Here's the problem.
[01:53.000 --> 02:04.000]  The tracks that they had going back two weeks ago, a week ago, three days ago, two days ago, none of them were right.
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  The tracks always showed it going out in the Atlantic or up the East Coast, and then the last few days going up the center of the state,
[02:10.000 --> 02:18.000]  and then now they show it going westerly, but staying along the westerly side with some now saying, oh, maybe it's going to track out the sea.
[02:18.000 --> 02:25.000]  With my experience with Katrina and so many others, it sits out in the Eastern Atlantic, heats up, comes in, runs along the bottom of Florida.
[02:25.000 --> 02:34.000]  Katrina sat there for like three days, just spinning off the coast, and then zipped on over as we all witnessed.
[02:34.000 --> 02:43.000]  But this gives us a unique opportunity while the public is paying attention to weather to point out a couple big things.
[02:43.000 --> 02:51.000]  We have the UN, we have Al Gore, we have the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, we have Obama, and all the folks are invested in the carbon tax swindle,
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  the big Hollywood folks as well, George Clooney's, saying it's your fault this happened, even though back in the time of Christopher Columbus,
[02:59.000 --> 03:09.000]  they reported on storms in the Caribbean and storms in the southern United States that would knock over every tree when they made landfall.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  I've not seen a storm that knocks down every tree.
[03:12.000 --> 03:21.000]  So we know about mega storms, sometimes it would go on for weeks, that would be, of course, two or three hurricanes or cyclones right behind each other,
[03:21.000 --> 03:30.000]  like we're seeing with Irma, and we've got Jose, and then we've got Tatia out in the western Caribbean spinning around.
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  Tatia, Tatia. I can't pronounce anything right. How do you say it?
[03:36.000 --> 03:46.000]  Katia with a K, thank you. I don't have a teleprompter, but they do occasionally pop in my ear when I'm getting something wrong, so that's always good.
[03:46.000 --> 03:54.000]  But hey, I'm pretty good to get all these hurricane names right without a teleprompter. Kind of trains you to be focused, but I'm not too good on my Russian names,
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.000]  even though I supposedly get my orders from Vladimir Putin.
[03:59.000 --> 04:08.000]  Now getting serious, we have some amazing guests today. When I say amazing, there's been a lot of new big developments the last few years in the area of geoengineering,
[04:08.000 --> 04:23.000]  namely that planetary weather control projects have been admitted by governments, Russia, China, Dubai, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, even South American countries are admitting it.
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  But they always make fun of it in our news, and that's because the United States leads it. So there's been some big new developments.
[04:29.000 --> 04:38.000]  One of the leading researchers on this, Dane Whittington, is going to be joining us in the second hour stand day of amazing earthquake expert,
[04:38.000 --> 04:45.000]  one of the best tracking records out there, being able to predict earthquakes, going to get into why we saw the record earthquake a few days ago in Mexico,
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.000]  8.1, 8.3, depending on the raker scale report we see. That's the strongest ever recorded in Mexico.
[04:50.000 --> 05:00.000]  We're going to look at that and just talk about these huge developments dealing with the deep state and its deep projects.
[05:00.000 --> 05:12.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[05:12.000 --> 05:20.000]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[05:20.000 --> 05:30.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war. Pathetogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[05:34.000 --> 05:49.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[05:49.000 --> 05:59.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[05:59.000 --> 06:08.000]  We want your soul. We want your soul. We want your soul.
[06:08.000 --> 06:15.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[06:15.000 --> 06:30.000]  Close your habits, your facts, your fears, give us your address, your shoes, sights, your ears, your digits, your blood, your blood.
[06:30.000 --> 06:36.000]  Wayne Wiggington, just one of the best researchers out there, he's a scientist engineer, into geoengineering and weather modification is going to be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[06:36.000 --> 06:48.000]  Stan Dayo is going to pop in at the bottom of the hour. One of the top, he's an engineer with many letters behind his name, but one of the top accurate predictors, lay predictors of earthquakes.
[06:48.000 --> 07:00.000]  We're going to be talking to him and looking at some of the latest models dealing with earthquakes and why the strongest earthquake in Mexican history and the history of Mexico to be recorded hit just a few days ago.
[07:00.000 --> 07:14.000]  And why are earthquakes and typhoons and hurricanes tied into that historically that is all coming up because I don't want to just sit here and look at an event like this and say, oh, let's pay Al Gore some carbon taxes.
[07:14.000 --> 07:26.000]  You know, let's say that this is all man made by individuals without looking at the fact that it's been the sun historically and the science shows this.
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  We had an astrophysicist on earlier today before I did my standard Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[07:31.000 --> 07:48.000]  We've been live since 9 a.m. this morning myself and Leanne McAdoo and own shroyer and of course David Knight and much the crew and we had a very esteemed physicist on astrophysicist from Harvard getting into how the sun is the main driver.
[07:48.000 --> 07:57.000]  We're going to be airing some excerpts of that towards the end of the broadcast as well. Our own Millie Weaver hosting for two hours interviewed him very powerful information.
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  The sun is more than 99% of the climate.
[08:01.000 --> 08:19.000]  You know, whenever I say the sun's much bigger than the earth, I'll throw out how many planet Earths it would take just to fill up the surface of the sun, but not the actual entire volume of the sun. So will you guys pull up for me?
[08:19.000 --> 08:26.000]  How many Earths can fit into the sun? Just to give you guys an example. It's an astronomical number. I don't want to get it wrong from memory.
[08:26.000 --> 08:34.000]  But imagine the UN and mainline meteorologist. They had a UN vote seven years ago.
[08:34.000 --> 08:43.000]  University today, 1.3 million Earths.
[08:43.000 --> 08:50.000]  The answer is it would take 1.3 million. That's 1,300,000 Earths to fill up the sun. That's a lot of Earths.
[08:50.000 --> 08:56.000]  The sun makes up 99.86 of the mass of the solar system.
[08:56.000 --> 09:03.000]  And it's giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, which make up most of the remaining 0.14% of the solar system.
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  Give me a favor, print me that universe today article with the NASA data.
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  So see, I just threw out something like, the sun is thousands of times bigger than the earth.
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.000]  Then I set that on air today and I was like, wait a minute. Jupiter is like 300 times.
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  It isn't Saturn 90 times. Let's just see if my memory is right. Probably isn't.
[09:26.000 --> 09:33.000]  And then I started thinking, wait, they admit you could put hundreds and hundreds of Jupiters in the sun.
[09:33.000 --> 09:43.000]  And you start looking at the numbers, it's no, it's tens of thousands of Jupiters and Saturns in the sun and all the other planets because it's 0.14.
[09:43.000 --> 09:55.000]  So imagine 1.3 million third rock from the sun, planet Earth, terra firma, 1.3 million.
[09:55.000 --> 10:03.000]  And we are third rock out, it's Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, it goes out from there.
[10:03.000 --> 10:12.000]  And they're telling us the sun has nothing to do with climate, even though we have the hurricanes and we have summer when we're tilted towards the sun.
[10:12.000 --> 10:22.000]  And then on the bottom of the earth, when it's tilted around, it gets more sun for part of the year.
[10:22.000 --> 10:31.000]  Now this is incontrovertible fact. It is the sun that heats more than 99% of the earth. What heats the rest of it?
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  Thermal vents, they account for, let's test my memory, less than 1%.
[10:36.000 --> 10:46.000]  Thermal vents, volcanic heat that makes it up to the crust of the earth, into the ocean mainly and some volcanoes on the surface.
[10:46.000 --> 10:54.000]  But subterranean volcanoes, undersea volcanoes, above ground volcanoes.
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.000]  You got a lot of volcanic heat that comes up through hot water and springs.
[10:58.000 --> 11:08.000]  So you've got volcanoes under the ground or you've got fissures down on the earth into magma and then you've got the above ground volcanoes and then you've got the undersea volcanoes and the big pacific rim and other areas.
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  And that's the main thing other than the sun heating the earth and it's less than 1%. It's estimated.
[11:15.000 --> 11:23.000]  So the sun is the main system heating the earth.
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.000]  And in the summer we have the hurricanes into the early fall because the water gets the hottest towards the end of the summer.
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  And even as it cools a little bit, still it takes time for that massive water to dissipate that heat energy.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  I'm no scientist. This is all just admitted fact.
[11:38.000 --> 11:46.000]  But the UN seven years ago, because all these scientists were coming out astrophysicists from Harvard and other places and we're saying,
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  what you're doing is a fraud saying it's manmade and it's carbon dioxide. We are such a small effect. It's mainly the sun.
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  They said, no, we don't want to hear that. So they had a vote at the Copenhagen event at the UN.
[11:57.000 --> 12:08.000]  They were meeting Copenhagen Denmark for the treaty for world government carbon tax treaty to track everything we do and taxes and make us pay money to private central banks anytime we did any human activity.
[12:08.000 --> 12:21.000]  Total global feudalist system. And they said at that event, we have voted with the UN scientist, the handpicked ones, that the sun has no effect on climate.
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  He word change.
[12:24.000 --> 12:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is an absolute fact that when the sun goes into these heating cycles and dormant cycles that are roughly 11 to 12 year cycles, then it has super cycles, 120 year cycles that the sun heats up and the sun heats down.
[12:40.000 --> 12:47.000]  The sun heats up. The sun heats down when it's heating up, when it's having more thermal nuclear explosions inside of it.
[12:47.000 --> 12:57.000]  But as such a mass, it contains those explosions, some of it ripples out on the surface as solar flares, as coronal mass ejections.
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.000]  And those fly out towards the earth with all their heat. You feel it when you're outside, not a conspiracy theory.
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  You feel it outside that plants live off of it, photosynthesis.
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  And when we're pointed towards the sun, leaning towards it, we have the summer.
[13:11.000 --> 13:19.000]  And then as we turn away, we go to the fall. We're really turned away. We're the winter. As we turn back in, it's the spring. And it's the summer.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  I know 99% of you are saying, Jones, we know all this. 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[13:24.000 --> 13:34.000]  Well, under the program they wanted in the public schools with Obama, they said that 2 plus 2 does not always equal 4 under Common Core.
[13:34.000 --> 13:44.000]  So they're engineering mass voodoo, mass mental illness. Whenever Christians say, oh, we're having hurricanes or tornadoes because of sodomy or something,
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  people say, oh, you're a bunch of voodoo crazies, bunch of superstitious.
[13:48.000 --> 13:58.000]  But then when Jennifer Lawrence, who I'm going to play when we come back, when she comes out and says that it is the fault of people voting Trump,
[13:58.000 --> 14:10.000]  Irma and Harvey, the Hollywood goes wild and says yes. And then they have the more pseudo science version, the CNN and the New York Times have people on there going, yes,
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  this is global warming man made. We're paying for it from Mother Nature.
[14:15.000 --> 14:24.000]  So they're telling you that you're individually geoengineering everything individually in the aggregate.
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  You're bad. But governments aren't geoengineering. But here's the problem.
[14:30.000 --> 14:39.000]  Just like they had the Manhattan Project for four years, totally secret, hundreds of thousands of people involved compartmentalized.
[14:39.000 --> 14:49.000]  No one knew even when they tested an atomic bomb out in the desert in the United States, they just told folks all that was some thunder.
[14:49.000 --> 14:58.000]  Never mind, go away until they dropped a bombs on Hiroshima and Nakasaki in 1945.
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  Now, that's a 1900 equation that gave us atomic bombs.
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.000]  Even the backwards North Koreans that can't even build their own cars or make their own toilet paper.
[15:07.000 --> 15:13.000]  They know how to make hydrogen bombs now because the Clintons and others gave them the technology.
[15:13.000 --> 15:19.000]  Imagine if they did that back in the 40s, what do they got cooking now? Well, here's the difference.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  They act like you're dumb animals.
[15:21.000 --> 15:28.000]  The globalists, the social engineers, the academics go have conferences, admit they're geoengineering, admit they're spraying, admit they're doing it all.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  Then they hire comedians. Globalist system is ridicule.
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  They hire all the top comedians to go on all the shows and attack and make up stuff that I've never said.
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.000]  They didn't say there's no such thing as geoengineering, so that you never have a debate about it and say like an ignorant savage.
[15:43.000 --> 15:54.000]  Well, they just move on and take full control of the weather, which is something you know governments signed a treaty in 1978 to do secretly amongst themselves, but to not tell the public.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  You're going to see it all, the proof coming up.

[21:19.840 --> 21:26.720]  Too close to the Sun you'd be like Venus or Mercury too far away. You'd be like Mars too cold
[21:27.240 --> 21:31.400]  Not able to hold an atmosphere. We're right in the perfect spot
[21:32.080 --> 21:37.280]  Why would the UN vote seven years ago to say the Sun has no effect on climate change?
[21:37.280 --> 21:45.280]  Because they want to blame you and they want to play God and sell you on the idea that they
[21:45.880 --> 21:50.280]  Can control weather but only after they blamed you for the problems
[21:50.560 --> 21:55.680]  Then you've got to have a global tax for global geoengineering
[21:56.880 --> 21:58.880]  Migrate frustration is this I
[21:59.920 --> 22:01.480]  Have read
[22:01.480 --> 22:08.800]  60 page council on foreign relations reports. I've read 30 plus page UN reports
[22:08.800 --> 22:10.800]  I have read
[22:10.840 --> 22:12.880]  400 page books on geoengineering
[22:12.880 --> 22:18.800]  I've interviewed the father of weather weapons when it was declassified in 2006 and then he got a visit from the government
[22:18.800 --> 22:20.800]  Ben Livingston would do no more interviews
[22:21.640 --> 22:25.120]  He's admitted the former head of the Air Force program
[22:25.840 --> 22:27.040]  and
[22:27.040 --> 22:29.040]  I'm informed but
[22:29.040 --> 22:37.080]  Mastremedia will say Jones says the tornado was sent by Obama that hit Oklahoma City never said that or Jones says
[22:37.080 --> 22:42.880]  There's giant wasp living under the under the UN building never said that these are quotes
[22:43.200 --> 22:49.440]  From Rachel Maddow and others and then even people I know people that say they're my friends who are on TV and radio will go
[22:49.440 --> 22:53.040]  Yeah, Jones kind of gets out there saying there's giant wasp under the
[22:53.040 --> 22:59.440]  UN building or Jones kind of gets out there saying there's slave colonies on Mars. I called up one friend and I said
[22:59.440 --> 23:05.480]  I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars. You can show me saying that on video or audio over it. You can't find it. It's a lie. I
[23:07.560 --> 23:15.360]  Have a stack it doesn't hurt me that I'm being attacked. In fact, it makes me more popular more successful, but they're building this big
[23:17.040 --> 23:19.040]  straw man of me
[23:19.040 --> 23:26.880]  And so as they built this giant fake straw man to try to attack the human awakening and and create that as a symbol
[23:26.880 --> 23:31.640]  Try to make me a symbol of falsity the shadow of the giant lie. They've built makes
[23:32.640 --> 23:37.040]  My operation who I really am bigger for those that actually come and find us
[23:38.280 --> 23:42.080]  But see there's a race to build this big giant Alex Jones
[23:42.080 --> 23:48.260]  I mean seven TV shows airing weekly some five nights a week in prime time slots where the host is
[23:48.260 --> 23:53.820]  Supposedly me and they say the most racist horrible crap. I mean one episode is I'm Alex Jones
[23:53.820 --> 23:57.940]  And I hate people with long hair and they just repeat jokes about long hair
[23:58.260 --> 24:01.660]  So and then people long hair suddenly see me and go if you man
[24:02.180 --> 24:09.060]  Never said it and the next episode Alex Jones hates gays then goes through things. I've supposedly said Alex Jones hates blacks
[24:09.060 --> 24:11.060]  Remember Alec Baldwin
[24:11.180 --> 24:17.900]  Playing the part of the president on Saturday Night Live. I'm Alec. I'm president Trump. I don't like black people. They're not humans
[24:17.900 --> 24:19.900]  I learned it from Alex Jones
[24:20.300 --> 24:22.300]  info wars calm Alex Jones
[24:23.660 --> 24:28.420]  Now why would you do that because they think their viewers are idiots and they're
[24:29.140 --> 24:31.140]  inoculating them
[24:31.900 --> 24:33.220]  psychologically
[24:33.220 --> 24:35.220]  Every episode I hate women
[24:36.060 --> 24:38.580]  They'll even cut this out, but I don't care. They're deceivers
[24:38.980 --> 24:45.340]  They say I say I hate women. I hate gays. I hate trainings or they say, oh, that's the proper term
[24:45.340 --> 24:48.860]  You know use trans Alex. You're being hateful. There's no way to win. I
[24:49.500 --> 24:52.100]  Hate black people. I hate Hispanics and
[24:53.060 --> 24:58.380]  They just continue to put it out effects of a new listener tuned in they're probably thinking come on
[24:58.380 --> 25:03.940]  Alec Baldwin didn't come out and say those aren't humans. Those are black people. I learned it from Alex Jones. Okay
[25:04.340 --> 25:10.340]  Maybe you can cue that up people won't believe that I mean it's every show, but it's not like a couple of Saturday Night Lives attack me
[25:10.620 --> 25:11.660]  it's
[25:11.660 --> 25:18.100]  Two shows they've got on Comedy Central every day attacking or five days a week. It's it's two shows on HBO
[25:18.220 --> 25:23.380]  It's a showtime show and it's a bunch of other ones. I mean, it's everywhere. Why?
[25:24.580 --> 25:32.100]  If you know the answer to that you'll know how to defeat them because I do one thing that anybody else could do I
[25:34.740 --> 25:37.800]  Go out to the actual white papers from MIT
[25:38.540 --> 25:40.240]  Noah
[25:40.240 --> 25:43.780]  The major corporations the defense industries all of them
[25:43.780 --> 25:48.380]  They all want to brag about what they've done to shareholders or they want to brag to other scientists
[25:48.380 --> 25:50.380]  So they will thinly couch this stuff
[25:51.180 --> 25:54.220]  But they admit they're already kind of you know an engineer the whole planet
[25:54.220 --> 25:56.660]  I don't think they have full control because the Sun's so powerful
[25:56.660 --> 26:00.740]  That's why they're actually in competition with the Sun and mad that they're not God
[26:00.900 --> 26:02.900]  And I'm not saying the Sun's God
[26:02.900 --> 26:05.780]  But if you were an atheist it might as well be your God
[26:05.780 --> 26:12.420]  Because they say in like 10 minutes the surface would be freezing if the Sun's full radiation didn't happen
[26:12.420 --> 26:14.420]  You know it's a high noon
[26:14.860 --> 26:17.260]  Within days it'd be absolute zero
[26:17.980 --> 26:21.380]  Through much of the earth, but still the core would be molten for a while
[26:21.620 --> 26:28.980]  The Sun is 1.3 million times bigger than terra firma than this planetoid. We're on
[26:29.980 --> 26:31.980]  it's the driver and
[26:31.980 --> 26:39.060]  They're trying to manipulate but all they can do is nudge and already take weather systems that the Sun has created and then try to control those
[26:40.100 --> 26:46.020]  But coming up I'm going to go over the latest with the hurricane and so much more and we have some special guests joining us
[26:46.020 --> 26:48.020]  But I'm gonna show you if you're a TV viewer
[26:48.540 --> 26:52.860]  For radio listeners these are all posted on info wars calm, but you don't believe me
[26:52.860 --> 26:55.940]  You can go to department of defense dot gov and
[26:56.460 --> 27:01.020]  You can read DoD news briefing Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen
[27:01.020 --> 27:07.340]  Briefing them on their new weather weapons and their tectonic earthquake and volcano weapons
[27:08.260 --> 27:14.060]  You might want to read that for yourself. It's right there in the report. We're gonna go over that for you
[27:14.380 --> 27:20.100]  We're gonna continue US Air Force has dispatched its air sprayer C 130 to Texas in response to hurricane Harvey
[27:20.100 --> 27:22.500]  They can do weather modification. They can do chemical cleanup
[27:22.500 --> 27:27.500]  They can also do anti mosquito spray and they're massively increasing the fleet of them the point is it's going on
[27:27.500 --> 27:30.260]  The average person's departmental eyes don't even know the full mission
[27:30.860 --> 27:37.620]  Systems council on fire and relations developing an international framework for geo engineering. That's from
[27:38.660 --> 27:45.180]  2010 seven years ago. It's a 60 plus page report. I suggest you read it
[27:45.180 --> 27:48.300]  Oh, here's one from last year June 29th
[27:48.580 --> 27:56.140]  Central intelligence agency news and information press release with the director Brennan speaking at the council on fire and relations about their ongoing
[27:56.140 --> 28:02.160]  Program for world government and total geo engineering program to guess you might want to read it for yourself
[28:02.660 --> 28:06.420]  Let's continue. That's it CIA.gov by the way. Oh, here's another one
[28:06.420 --> 28:12.620]  But again, but again, just have a few comedians come out and laugh at me and see all the intellectuals though
[28:12.620 --> 28:15.660]  They're reading CIA.gov. They're reading the Atlantic
[28:16.380 --> 28:25.380]  They're reading CFR. They're reading about oh the company's doing it now Dubai and Qatar and Russia and China are all doing it with ground-breaking
[28:25.380 --> 28:29.900]  Electromagnetic systems to control the weather. Here's the Atlantic monthly
[28:30.740 --> 28:38.260]  Reengineering the earth. Oh, yeah, only the global government to do it though US Air Force is dispassious air sprayers. Here's another one
[28:39.460 --> 28:44.660]  Reflecting upon 10 years of geo engineering research. Oh, we got a big report here climate cloud
[28:45.100 --> 28:50.780]  Ionization electric rain making and laser-guided weather modification and right as all this comes out
[28:50.780 --> 28:56.060]  They got a big movie geo storm coming out next month right on time. Stay with us

[31:03.820 --> 31:09.220]  Seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us to mother nature to detoxify the body
[31:09.220 --> 31:15.620]  That's why I'm introducing Z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA
[31:15.620 --> 31:22.540]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war
[31:22.540 --> 31:28.380]  It is a classical 360 when this is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[31:28.380 --> 31:35.220]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get you it's yourself
[31:35.220 --> 31:39.500]  Yo, it's your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that
[31:39.700 --> 31:47.060]  Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you the remnant of America to
[31:47.220 --> 31:53.220]  Reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your prayers together

[31:59.820 --> 32:02.500]  We need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be clean
[32:02.500 --> 32:08.460]  It's the air we're breathing especially for our children the artificial particulates of the chemicals is
[32:09.140 --> 32:15.700]  Absolutely weighing down our immune systems the same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure
[32:16.220 --> 32:22.140]  groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze whether it's your home or office
[32:22.140 --> 32:26.700]  Yo, it's yourself your co-workers your family your children to the best job
[32:26.700 --> 32:34.020]  You can to purify your air the elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid
[32:34.060 --> 32:37.420]  Most toxic effects themselves the general public doesn't
[32:38.220 --> 32:42.180]  The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at three hundred four hundred five hundred dollars
[32:42.180 --> 32:46.900]  One of these systems can keep eight hundred square feet incredibly clean. This is a system
[32:46.900 --> 32:52.420]  I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job
[32:52.420 --> 32:56.980]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then for war store calm
[33:01.340 --> 33:04.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:04.180 --> 33:19.140]  From the frontlines of the information war it's Alex Jones. Watch me watch me. I got it
[33:19.140 --> 33:23.420]  I got something that makes me want to shout
[33:25.140 --> 33:27.140]  I got something that
[33:29.340 --> 33:40.140]  Will soon of Harvard is one of the top astrophysicists in the world and he was on with Millie Weaver about two hours ago
[33:40.140 --> 33:44.900]  We're having live coverage all day till past 10 o'clock tonight central as we cover
[33:44.900 --> 33:52.460]  Hurricane Irma as it makes landfall in Naples. There's now going up the coastline towards Tampa as a category three hugging the coastline
[33:53.500 --> 33:56.420]  So we've got the Sun that's 1.3 million times bigger than Earth
[33:56.580 --> 34:02.140]  We know it's electromagnetic radiation not just its heat radiation effects goes into the core bounces back off
[34:02.380 --> 34:06.740]  We know thermal heat is less than 1% of the earth's heat the rest is the Sun
[34:07.020 --> 34:09.860]  And we know that there have been a lot of big earthquakes
[34:09.860 --> 34:17.580]  They intensify in the in the Pacific Rim a ring of fire you name it now stand day of is a scientist researcher worked in classified
[34:18.020 --> 34:21.020]  Areas of some of the top corporations the government as well as the FBI
[34:21.260 --> 34:26.700]  I remember hearing this guy 20 years ago with Art Bell and he sounded credible, but I just couldn't believe
[34:27.020 --> 34:30.100]  You know the earthquake predictions until they kept coming true now
[34:30.100 --> 34:37.060]  He was using government data that they had out on major sites. They took that down. He could still predict it with a lot of
[34:37.060 --> 34:39.060]  A lot of precision
[34:39.700 --> 34:43.220]  And so I want to just get his take about we know there's you engineering going on
[34:43.460 --> 34:46.260]  But they know how to kind of target things from our research that are already
[34:46.780 --> 34:54.540]  Happening and just exacerbated or make it weaker, but then you got the Sun coming back into a out of a dormant cycle into a
[34:55.260 --> 34:57.260]  more prolific cycle and
[34:57.820 --> 35:03.620]  Then you see all the other earth changes, but why do we see megastorms like three?
[35:04.820 --> 35:06.620]  Hurricanes right now
[35:06.620 --> 35:13.460]  Irma a week ago 185 mile an hour winds the only time it's ever been recorded in modern history at a hundred and eighty-five miles an hour
[35:13.940 --> 35:20.060]  Why historically even back with ignorant savages could tell that when you had big storms you also had earthquakes
[35:21.100 --> 35:29.100]  They've lost over 90 people that we know of gotta pray for those folks in Mexico strong as ever recorded in a hundred years of seismographs down there
[35:30.140 --> 35:33.500]  Now finally the LA times are telling the public get ready for a mega quake
[35:33.500 --> 35:38.380]  Even though there are many years overdue according to stand day. Oh, and I looked at his own research now
[35:39.180 --> 35:42.140]  Top seismologists and others agree with him
[35:42.140 --> 35:45.700]  It's only to get stand day on one to give us his larger
[35:46.460 --> 35:54.380]  Encompassed research to view on why these changes including political are all happening globally at the same time in the Romans wrote about
[35:54.580 --> 35:59.700]  It just seemed like there'd be volcanoes and suddenly there'd be wars or there'd be a big storm and there'd be a war
[35:59.700 --> 36:07.300]  It just it all seems to go together. You got North Korea and the hydrogen bombs and you've got I mean this this quake that hit Mexico
[36:07.300 --> 36:10.060]  That's one of the biggest recorded in many many years
[36:10.420 --> 36:13.460]  I mean just look at how huge it is compared to other big quakes that are happening
[36:13.460 --> 36:16.980]  So stand day of stand day. Oh D. E. Y. O. Com
[36:17.300 --> 36:21.660]  Amazing author filmmaker not gonna go over his whole bio as we'll run out of time if we do
[36:22.180 --> 36:28.260]  But we do have coming up of course astrophysicist and so much more to go over all this
[36:28.260 --> 36:35.460]  Dane Wiggington absolutely on target about geoengineering which more and more they're admitting is going on so stand day
[36:35.460 --> 36:38.300]  Oh, thank you so much for taking time out with us on this Sunday evening
[36:39.580 --> 36:44.100]  Thank you for the invitation. I follow Dane's work, too. It's really quite exceptional
[36:44.100 --> 36:48.300]  I've sent him an email here recently just to tell him how good I thought his research was or is
[36:48.820 --> 36:51.380]  You were mentioning about a biblical quote
[36:52.980 --> 36:57.420]  Somebody sent me this yesterday in relation to what's happening with the hurricanes and the Sun and stuff
[36:57.420 --> 37:00.500]  Luke 21 3 verses 25 through 28
[37:01.860 --> 37:07.020]  You can read it or I can read it for you, but basically it says that there's going to be seas
[37:07.460 --> 37:10.780]  distress waves in the seas roaring on the shores
[37:11.220 --> 37:13.340]  distress in the Sun the moon the stars and
[37:14.340 --> 37:20.380]  The powers of heaven will be shaken. You know like with the problem. I forgot. We've got record solar storms right now, too
[37:20.380 --> 37:25.980]  Oh, yeah, we've had two in the last 72 hours one at a 8.2 occurred today
[37:25.980 --> 37:29.940]  And a 9.3 yesterday and the spot that generated those
[37:30.580 --> 37:34.780]  Is going to rotate around the Sun and its normal rotation period of 28 days
[37:34.780 --> 37:42.020]  But we're going to see it become earth effective or earth directed on the 30th of September through the 2nd of October
[37:42.020 --> 37:47.700]  So people could be watching that to see what happens again if we get a direct burst from the Sun
[37:47.700 --> 37:52.980]  That'll be like a halo coming at us of charged particles. It's called a coral mass ejection
[37:52.980 --> 37:59.580]  That could disrupt a lot of our electronics. Certainly we expect some of the satellite communication a lot of folks are saying even though
[37:59.580 --> 38:05.580]  It was pointed away from us. There's so much coming off from other ejections aren't as big. That's why North Korea didn't test this ICBM
[38:06.940 --> 38:14.340]  Well, perhaps, you know, as I say the guidance systems a GPS monitoring system that we have up in geosynchronous orbits
[38:14.540 --> 38:18.180]  Are compromised by this to a degree most of them been hardened
[38:18.180 --> 38:24.140]  But they do warn you at no what an asset that there might be some interruption these things and when you get that kind of an ejection
[38:24.780 --> 38:28.700]  To be cautious of your you know your GPS guidance systems
[38:30.180 --> 38:31.540]  Even in your car
[38:31.540 --> 38:35.500]  So what do you make of all this because we know they're trying to control the weather?
[38:35.500 --> 38:38.220]  But just like the Manhattan project they're keeping it quasi-secret
[38:38.220 --> 38:42.740]  But now they're suddenly admitting a lot of it and then you've got all these increased storms
[38:42.740 --> 38:47.100]  I mean, you're a smart guy you worked in black projects. We don't mean poor black neighborhoods
[38:47.100 --> 38:50.540]  Worked in secret projects stand out. What do you think's really going on here?
[38:51.260 --> 38:56.820]  Well, look in 1972 the US government started drafting
[38:57.700 --> 39:04.060]  Agreements with Russia to limit weather warfare or military uses of weather warfare and it took them till
[39:04.620 --> 39:07.540]  1978 six years to get the stuff approved to the Senate
[39:08.220 --> 39:10.420]  and that was what 30
[39:11.580 --> 39:13.580]  45 years ago and
[39:13.580 --> 39:19.980]  I saw that you had something on your website you were showing it about what you can read at the government sites about weather warfare
[39:19.980 --> 39:20.540]  Absolutely
[39:20.540 --> 39:24.220]  In fact, they started it in 72 as you said it rushes insistence because they knew we were doing it
[39:24.220 --> 39:28.580]  They were doing it too in 78 they ratified it other companies ratified it is global law
[39:28.820 --> 39:37.140]  The Department of Defense admitted their earthquake tectonic and weather weapon program by the Secretary of Defense in the US Department of Defense press release
[39:37.540 --> 39:40.900]  That was in 1997 April 28th. I've got that on screen
[39:40.900 --> 39:46.060]  I mean what's crazy is they admitted all the academics, but then tell us it's not it's not happening
[39:46.060 --> 39:49.820]  But I'll we can also show folks that you in training keep going Stan
[39:50.460 --> 39:52.460]  Okay, well the thing is
[39:52.780 --> 39:56.500]  Back then when they were designing the treaty and then eventually ratifying it
[39:56.860 --> 40:05.100]  They were using stuff say in Russia of spreading black hole dust about an inch thick over the snow in Siberia to
[40:05.100 --> 40:12.180]  Modify how much heat was absorbed into the land there and thus affect the long-reached weather forecasts or patterns over
[40:12.420 --> 40:17.180]  Alaska and northern United States and Canada that was a very simple form of it, but as you know
[40:18.220 --> 40:21.500]  Dr. Teller did to apply patents to
[40:22.340 --> 40:28.580]  Put particulates like barium and various other metal powders in the atmosphere to either reflect or absorb energy from the Sun
[40:28.580 --> 40:35.940]  At that time it was obvious to us that the the Sun was the major driver to global heating not just warming heating and
[40:36.220 --> 40:39.620]  This has occurred in our past geological record so many times
[40:39.620 --> 40:42.180]  It's not funny it long before humans were on the earth
[40:42.780 --> 40:46.580]  With manufacturing complexes creating the heat they were talking about now
[40:46.580 --> 40:50.340]  So this is not due to human effort as you were saying I agree
[40:51.260 --> 40:54.660]  Of course they're good as you said they're gonna blame Trump for everything
[40:54.660 --> 41:00.540]  But he's doing the right thing and telling the truth about what really is causing this global heating
[41:00.540 --> 41:06.500]  And it's not totally being controlled by the luminous certainly the technology does exist for
[41:07.060 --> 41:10.540]  Steering huge hurricanes and tornadoes once they start
[41:10.860 --> 41:14.980]  But it's not always easy for one power to start a hurricane
[41:15.500 --> 41:19.860]  Because it was a huge amount of energy. We're talking about like a hundred thousand H bombs
[41:19.860 --> 41:24.420]  It's it's so big that you we we don't have the power to direct it
[41:24.420 --> 41:31.020]  But we can take something that starts and help it move into an area of warming in the sea that will then accelerate it
[41:31.260 --> 41:35.700]  Exactly they put some English on it like the Sun rammed the ball the cue ball
[41:35.700 --> 41:38.460]  But then we can kind of blow on it maybe make a change course
[41:39.300 --> 41:41.300]  Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, so
[41:41.980 --> 41:48.140]  You know, we've known for gosh several decades probably four decades at least that you can drop
[41:48.140 --> 41:54.860]  A powdered dry ice from an aircraft above a hurricane on one side and cause it to rain and to
[41:55.060 --> 41:59.060]  Drop a lot of its energy into the ocean and then kind of Peter out not be a well
[41:59.060 --> 42:03.340]  That's what Ben Livingston the father of weather weapons. It's in his beauty city said with 15 aircraft
[42:03.340 --> 42:05.340]  He can make it dump its water in the ocean
[42:05.620 --> 42:09.060]  Right. Yeah, I mean, why don't we do this? I mean, why would what did we do it now?
[42:09.740 --> 42:13.900]  So, why do you think because it's the 1970 a treaty or what I?
[42:13.900 --> 42:20.940]  I wonder if it's a conflict with the president Trump's administration by the you know the invisible government
[42:20.940 --> 42:24.300]  I wonder if they could have done it, but they're doing it to put pressure on him
[42:24.300 --> 42:29.380]  I mean, this is two hurricanes back to back. We're still cleaning up the other one and two more two more coming
[42:30.220 --> 42:32.220]  Yep, yep
[42:32.860 --> 42:34.780]  But let's stay right there because well
[42:34.780 --> 42:38.500]  It's certainly backfiring on him because it Harvey brought us together in the middle of that race war
[42:38.500 --> 42:42.660]  They were pushing so thank God Texans were so loving including a lot of black folks
[42:42.660 --> 42:48.340]  They've been white people advice first. It was just beautiful standaos and amazing research or two more segments with them than Dane
[42:49.500 --> 42:52.900]  Wiggington, I keep saying Wiggington. It's Wiggington geoengineeringwatch.org
[42:53.420 --> 42:56.020]  To be joining us with big new findings stay with us
[42:57.500 --> 43:03.500]  You know someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America it'll come in the name of

[47:04.180 --> 47:20.220]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news, it's Alex Jones
[47:24.620 --> 47:26.740]  Speaking of fake news since I mentioned it earlier
[47:26.740 --> 47:31.900]  We might as well play it remember Alec Baldwin when they have him playing the part of the president aliens have attacked
[47:31.900 --> 47:37.540]  And he's playing the part of Trump and he goes look at these people. They're black. They're not humans
[47:37.660 --> 47:41.660]  They're aliens. They're illegal aliens. You can't see it on talk radio
[47:41.660 --> 47:47.660]  I'm describing he's pointing at black people in the US Army and saying Alex Jones told me black people are bad
[47:47.660 --> 47:55.700]  I mean that that that this is what they're doing on seven comedy shows and other programs like oh
[47:55.700 --> 48:02.980]  What's the name of it homeland where the whole character running fake news and doing horrible things and
[48:03.460 --> 48:07.380]  Staging terror attacks is me and they say it's supposed to be me and
[48:08.140 --> 48:11.540]  Then now they've got a whole new show in Comedy Central on on top all the others
[48:11.540 --> 48:16.260]  And I'm not just bringing myself into this. They're scared of one thing you the listeners
[48:16.900 --> 48:21.780]  They know I get people on like stand a they know I get Ron Paul on they know I get Nigel Farage on
[48:21.780 --> 48:26.740]  They know I'm only only guys and get Matt Rodgson. They know that thinkers are listening
[48:27.380 --> 48:31.540]  They know Trump listens. They know Putin listens. It's not that I'm even that smart
[48:31.540 --> 48:38.580]  I just ring the alarm bell and built a platform to cover real stuff where they're saying that they've got earthquake weapons
[48:38.580 --> 48:44.660]  Secretary of Defense William Cohen. I'm gonna read this you in a moment, but I'm just saying remember it's not about defending me
[48:44.660 --> 48:48.560]  It's about defending you they have chosen me to be the symbol of the resistance
[48:48.560 --> 48:51.320]  Along with Trump and then try to destroy me
[48:52.520 --> 48:58.480]  But not my actual body create a fake Aleph Jones say horrible racist stuff out of its mouth
[48:58.760 --> 49:04.880]  But hide behind oh, it's just comedy and then I get attacked and my family gets spit upon the street
[49:04.880 --> 49:09.120]  I get coffee dumped on my head by by by the the drones
[49:09.120 --> 49:13.560]  It's a minority of people of every race color and creed, but they've been brainwashed
[49:13.560 --> 49:19.720]  So it's we're gonna talk about the big earthquake that hit Mexico stand a those predictions and projections on that
[49:19.720 --> 49:22.280]  Cuz he's one of the top guys, but first here's that clip
[49:23.360 --> 49:28.560]  Just to show how six months ago. They signaled this assault and now it's here. Here it is
[49:30.280 --> 49:37.280]  Where are you getting this information from a very reputable source what the FBI the CIA info wars
[49:37.280 --> 49:39.440]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones
[49:39.440 --> 49:47.960]  Where are you getting this information from a very reputable again and right before they's pointing at black people saying they're not human
[49:48.360 --> 49:54.000]  And he got that from Alex Jones. So I'm very proud of this. I wanted to fight him. I wanted to raise the alarm
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.360]  I wanted to change things. I never thought
[49:57.040 --> 49:58.920]  I'd be singled out as
[49:58.920 --> 50:02.920]  You know, there's Trump here and then there's me right here and then it's everybody else below that
[50:02.920 --> 50:04.920]  I don't want to be the big kahuna
[50:04.920 --> 50:08.960]  Okay, they're trying to destroy Stephen Bannon too because they see him right up there and Matt drudge
[50:09.480 --> 50:15.520]  The point is what is it stands a other so scared of why have they chosen me because you're a smart guy
[50:15.520 --> 50:17.760]  I don't talk about myself here, but it's really getting crazy
[50:19.720 --> 50:22.840]  Why did they pick on you it's probably because you're telling the truth
[50:23.400 --> 50:26.240]  I've been amazed by what you've been able to get away with that
[50:26.240 --> 50:28.880]  We've talked about it behind the scenes and on the phone and stuff
[50:28.880 --> 50:35.920]  But to be able to get it out there and to have the president United States listen is is a marvelous thing. I tell you
[50:35.920 --> 50:41.880]  I'm so glad that he's there, but I'm also sad that he's being picked on with so many things at once. It must be
[50:42.400 --> 50:48.880]  You're driving him crazy up there would try to handle all these emergencies of politically and geophysically you know astronomically
[50:49.680 --> 50:56.160]  What a what a challenge. I hope he makes it. It is crazy. I think that's this the secret wasn't what I did
[50:56.160 --> 51:01.680]  It's all the guests here and it's our audience getting the news out and going to the Trump rallies and getting him all the
[51:01.680 --> 51:06.200]  Stuff because he heard the show before and he'd been on years ago, but it's true that when he stinks off
[51:06.200 --> 51:09.600]  He looks at info wars. He looks at right mart. He looks at drudge
[51:09.600 --> 51:15.120]  I mean, he didn't even know our Pio was being sent to prison till he learned about it on drudge from one of our articles
[51:15.360 --> 51:21.120]  And then now they're flipping out about that. It just shows when you can get the info to him. It really has an effect
[51:21.720 --> 51:25.760]  That's the that's the trick is to be able to get through the wall built around him
[51:25.760 --> 51:28.320]  you know because he is all filtered and
[51:29.800 --> 51:34.480]  If you can't get to him then you go to social media and hopefully he'll pick that pick it up
[51:34.480 --> 51:39.280]  But the tweets and stuff that come from that and that's why everybody's got a hammer at Trump because they try to
[51:39.360 --> 51:46.320]  Block all his supportive tweets below, but he now knows because somebody told him on the phone to dig down deep into there and
[51:46.640 --> 51:51.920]  And and that's what's happening as well because I talked to the fellow that did talk to Trump months ago and explained
[51:51.920 --> 51:57.520]  He goes, yeah, why I don't ever see all the popular and fun stuff and the funny things and he loved reading all the stuff
[51:57.520 --> 52:00.080]  He used to love to the mail coming to you still the tune that way
[52:00.320 --> 52:02.640]  They're trying to divert that but I don't want to go off into Trump
[52:02.880 --> 52:09.760]  It's just amazing to see how they try to compartmentalize us and now they're compartmentalizing the president and they bragged when he first got elected
[52:09.760 --> 52:14.880]  They said we're gonna feed him false intelligence. We're gonna totally sequester him. We're gonna surround him and they've done it
[52:15.840 --> 52:19.920]  They have they have but anyway, we need to encourage him any way we can
[52:19.920 --> 52:21.920]  Uh in the public media social media
[52:22.560 --> 52:29.040]  Uh, I hope he gets to hear that so he's encouraged and not just totally depressed by all the absolutely 93 plus dead
[52:29.520 --> 52:33.520]  It's growing in mexico. I don't want a little new numbers coming out. I think it's even higher than that
[52:33.840 --> 52:40.000]  One of the biggest quit will the biggest quake ever recorded 8.1 8.3. They're changing the numbers. What happened there stan
[52:41.040 --> 52:44.400]  Hey, I was watching that one just a kind of a comical note here
[52:44.400 --> 52:49.600]  That's right near oaxaca where they grow all the agave plants to make my tequila and I was really worried
[52:52.160 --> 52:56.080]  Yeah, okay now seriously though that is on a fault line called him
[52:56.640 --> 53:01.520]  The imperial fault line going up into southern california and that goes into the salt and sea area
[53:01.520 --> 53:04.160]  We think it's going to connect up shortly under a little lake there
[53:04.720 --> 53:06.720]  Uh with the san andreas fault
[53:06.800 --> 53:12.000]  But the san andreas fault is not an orphan. There are a lot of parallel faults to it and i'm looking now every day
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.560]  at minor quakes, you know, major miners along the
[53:17.200 --> 53:20.160]  Lower san andreas right where uh, just beneath
[53:21.280 --> 53:23.280]  Los angeles at costa mason
[53:23.360 --> 53:28.400]  Uh, if we start seeing more of these little earthquakes pop then i'm thinking we may see a victor 6 to 7 down there
[53:28.400 --> 53:31.520]  Just like usgs is forecasting. They said it um
[53:32.240 --> 53:38.960]  Probability is about 50 to 70 percent in the next 30 years sometime that will have that 6.5 6.7 earthquake there
[53:38.960 --> 53:43.920]  Which may trigger other earthquakes parallel to it in the costa mason region
[53:44.320 --> 53:49.920]  But seeing all these the the flurry of them the swarm of them up in idaho at soda springs
[53:50.480 --> 53:55.840]  Is really kind of a puzzle because that's part of where yellowstone started in its initial eruption, you know
[53:56.240 --> 53:59.360]  by conventional wisdom over uh 1.2 million years ago
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.280]  um
[54:01.280 --> 54:04.640]  And it's part of the oldest part of the caldera
[54:04.640 --> 54:09.120]  Which hasn't been active, but now it is looking like on the edge of it. It's becoming active
[54:09.680 --> 54:15.360]  And we know that yellowstone is being monitored by the government. I've personally talked to the geologists there
[54:16.000 --> 54:21.200]  And you know, they can't go on record because they're all swore the secrets inside the little paper during obama's reign
[54:21.680 --> 54:24.480]  But there are a number of uh, super sensitive
[54:25.040 --> 54:28.480]  seismometers they put in around yellowstone and are monitoring constantly
[54:28.880 --> 54:31.520]  Down in uh, utah at the new computer center
[54:31.520 --> 54:37.600]  To keep an eye on the magma beneath and you've you've read i'm sure in the last week to 10 days where nasa
[54:37.840 --> 54:43.440]  Suggested they go down and you know pump water down there to cool off the magma as a possible way to to defuse it
[54:43.680 --> 54:48.560]  But of course, you know the logical arguments are if you do that you don't know what's going to happen
[54:48.560 --> 54:53.600]  You may actually cause a supermassive steam frantic type eruption from yellowstone
[54:54.320 --> 54:57.600]  Because you can't control the fractures around the hole you make to get the water down
[54:57.600 --> 55:01.200]  Uh, you know, there's just a number of other issues. Well, here's the boy
[55:02.640 --> 55:07.200]  Why why is it all increasing right now? And I know from your research. I heard 10 years ago on coast coast a m
[55:07.360 --> 55:09.360]  It's now mainstream news that there are many years
[55:09.600 --> 55:13.120]  How many years overdue for a big earthquake in southern california?
[55:13.440 --> 55:17.600]  And then and then suddenly now even the la time says get ready. So so so what's happening there?
[55:18.800 --> 55:22.880]  Well, I think uh, you know if I were in charge of the government and had this information
[55:22.880 --> 55:25.760]  I knew it was going to happen say within five years or a year whatever
[55:25.760 --> 55:30.640]  I wouldn't just come out and blurt it out in the mainstream and say, okay, it's going to happen. Uh, good luck
[55:30.800 --> 55:34.720]  We can't handle you. We've got too many other emergencies right now, but uh, you know get prepared
[55:35.280 --> 55:37.280]  It would cause, you know anarchy
[55:38.320 --> 55:40.720]  And uh, you know, so I wouldn't do that
[55:40.800 --> 55:44.880]  I would let the information sift out as well in the next 30 years
[55:44.960 --> 55:48.560]  It looks like it's going to be an earthquake of such and such in california
[55:48.560 --> 55:55.760]  And people might be well advised to get preparations made to keep a lid on the panic and the anarchy that could result
[55:55.920 --> 55:59.840]  I mean, look at what's happened down in florida over a hurricane that hadn't even hit yet
[56:00.240 --> 56:02.640]  And they said, okay, we're going to want you to evacuate the state
[56:02.960 --> 56:07.600]  Well, immediately holly was plotting all the gas stations that were out of gas immediately
[56:07.600 --> 56:11.280]  Oh, yeah, I mean people couldn't evacuate because the highways were clogged the gas was out
[56:11.600 --> 56:15.280]  It shows that with these big mega cities, there is no tenable plan
[56:15.280 --> 56:20.320]  So what does that mean when a what happens when a big quake hits something like southern california?
[56:20.880 --> 56:22.880]  Well, people should get prepared now
[56:22.960 --> 56:26.720]  They should have been been prepared even before this with emergency rations water and whatever
[56:27.200 --> 56:32.480]  Um, whether it's the earthquake or some local event like like today out in front of our house a water main burst
[56:32.880 --> 56:34.000]  And we didn't have water here
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.240]  But of course we had an emergency water prep in our home holly had that written about in the book
[56:38.640 --> 56:41.600]  And we were quite comfortable and uh weren't inconvenienced
[56:41.600 --> 56:45.120]  But if we hadn't done that we'd have been kind of hanging out there waiting for him to get the water back
[56:45.200 --> 56:51.680]  But imagine a cascading events like this as we're seeing many countries now can't keep up even former industrialized nations
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.480]  Are starting to crumble and have problems. What's happening?
[56:56.160 --> 57:01.440]  There are a number of issues. I think the change in the weather climate whether it's man-made or the the sun
[57:01.440 --> 57:06.960]  I think it's the sun primarily this is hitting our food supplies and which hits the economy and it's also
[57:06.960 --> 57:13.760]  Radiating us when we have these CMEs with different types of radiation and it makes you makes people irritable
[57:14.320 --> 57:17.360]  Crank here and and we can see it when we go to the grocery store occasionally
[57:17.520 --> 57:20.480]  So I just asked a question the romans the japanese all noticed
[57:21.040 --> 57:26.480]  That that during these times people would get more irritable. They didn't know why when storms were associated with it
[57:26.560 --> 57:29.120]  Or let's talk about that animal psychology
[57:29.600 --> 57:32.960]  Straight ahead ladies and gentlemen with stand day of stand day of
[57:32.960 --> 57:38.240]  So.com and then we've got one of the top researchers coming on about geo engineering
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.720]  Did they manipulate this hurricane and if they have technologies that could have killed it?
[57:43.040 --> 57:47.280]  Why aren't they doing that a stand day? I'll ask please tell folks to tune in. It's key to do that
[57:47.760 --> 57:54.160]  More than two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy
[57:54.240 --> 58:00.560]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government
[58:00.560 --> 58:07.120]  Knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water
[58:07.280 --> 58:14.480]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today
[58:14.640 --> 58:21.840]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family now in 2016 even more information has been revealed
[58:22.000 --> 58:28.160]  Concerning the connection between iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying could be the biggest
[58:28.160 --> 58:32.400]  revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these studies up for yourself
[58:32.640 --> 58:38.800]  This is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen

[59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.120]  Seems like time's speeding up we know technology is
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.520]  This is our land and then I think about people like stand out
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:14.240]  These are our people. We've been listening to for 20 years. The workers
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.520]  The strike
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.360]  A year ago by before he's back on I think it was like yesterday
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.640]  It's like a thousand years ago
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.960]  And that's why we've got a big board in there now. We write all these great guest names on
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.280]  So that we think about them. I also get this guy on every week not every year
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:38.160]  We'll be back after this intro and let him have some final comments
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.840]  I've met so many amazing people
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.720]  He could pull his name up. He was a famous british economist in the top of the government back in the 80s and stuff
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:03.200]  And I ran into him covering Bilderberg in Canada. They didn't even know how famous he was and he just said the answer to 1984
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.600]  Alex is 1776 and he was a mathematician
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:13.760]  Anybody said that's a social term like 1776 will override 1984 the tyranny stand. Please come back this week with us and then
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.440]  Try to come on at least once a week once a month. I'm launching all these new shows
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:22.880]  I'd love to get you on a couple days a week just to comment take cover or whatever you want long form without me interrupting
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.960]  Uh, which you know, uh, because you're such a nice guy. We only got like four minutes left
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.960]  Your points things you want to add things that are going on things that are happening things you want to impart to people
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.520]  Well, the main thing in relation to the weather is hurricanes have
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.000]  They're a low pressure area and when they move over land they start to slow down
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:46.640]  But if they move over a known fault line that is already stressed and ready to release
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.120]  It has been documented that the earthquake will occur as the low pressure area
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:55.040]  Causes a heave in the surface and have earthquake
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.960]  This one, uh, he's going to peter out over
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.200]  Uh, Tennessee near the new madrid zone
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.720]  Uh, I don't see a fault line listed there by usgs
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.600]  But i'm watching that area for lubrication from the rain and from the lifting of the surface
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.960]  What about cotton that the hurricane was right over where the mexican quake happened?
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.680]  interesting wasn't it
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.600]  I think I think that the two actually if you look at the same thing you're looking at there that uh,
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:25.680]  No wind map and you plug in the thermal temperature
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:31.600]  You know the sea temperatures over the globe and the wind you'll see that from Mexico where that the earthquake
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.280]  occurred and where the tornado or the hurricane occurred all the way up to florida
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.640]  Is bright purple which is extreme heat
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:45.200]  And the same kind of pattern exists on the west side of the pacific over in japan where they've just now had another earthquake
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.200]  See that
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.080]  And I do it's incredible. So it's all interconnected
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.640]  yes
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.640]  Wow, uh, just politically. What would you call the state the world's in right now?
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.520]  well, uh
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:06.400]  Politically and biblically, I'd say we're approaching the the tribulation period that the the prophets speak of in the bible because
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.200]  Of the threat to our economy, you know, global collapse economy
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.240]  Uh, geophysical events in the weather uh earthquakes, uh threatened
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.320]  asteroid impact and by the way on the 12th of october this year you can see it on my show images page
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:29.120]  I've got a plot there telling you about an asteroid. It's going to come within the orbits of
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:38.800]  250 of our geosynchronous satellites that control gps and communications and by the way drudge report tweeted that from nasa and twitter blocked it
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:43.600]  You're joking. No. No promise me. You'll come back for an hour this week
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.520]  Okay, done deal. Just tell me when well, I want you to get into all this
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.400]  I'm not gonna ask the questions because you're so smart. I'm serious
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.320]  Because you're nice and sit back like the good, you know, good guy and let me ask questions
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.760]  I want you to go wherever standale wants to on the asteroids the earth changes
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.760]  I mean regardless if the bible isn't true the globalists are sure using it as a handbook to take over
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.320]  The mark of the beast the persecution of christians kicking them off amazon kicking them off google
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.320]  I mean, it's mainline
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.840]  Focus on the family and stuff getting attacked. I mean they're really coming after people
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.920]  Can you believe we're actually seeing this? I mean it just came on so suddenly
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:23.760]  That you know, even though we expect it from biblical prophecy. I mean, I must found it. They're just hating us
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.200]  Well, trump sped it up and I want to ask you this week when you come on. Who is trump in biblical prophecy?
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:35.680]  Good question. We'll think about that. All right standale.com standale. Thank you. Wow
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:42.320]  Why is that guy? I just think like these guests are so good and like a year goes by since he's been on

[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:44.240]  We normally do the sunday show four to six p.m. Weekdays my broadcast 11 a.m. To 3 p.m. Central but just the last month we've gone 10 hours a day live with
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:50.160]  The great day but night 8 a.m. To 11 a.m. Before I come on weekdays with info wars live
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.840]  Here's truly alex jones then after that own chore for three hours
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:59.440]  With the war room it's a big round table discussion and I intend to go 20 hours a day live
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.640]  By the middle of next year, but we may even do it sooner
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.320]  But we're lining up all the talent all the people because info wars has got to do more
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:13.200]  We're really affecting things global leaders are listening big corporations are listening. We're decompartmentalizing things
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.440]  You had of course the big
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.640]  Manhattan project
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:23.600]  Back in the early 1940s. They kept it secret hundreds of thousands of people directly involved
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:30.720]  2 million involved supporting it and they kept the whole thing secret until they dropped a bombs on hereshima and nakasaki
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.680]  Well weather modification globally has been kept secret the same way
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:43.680]  And there's other programs of human animal hybrids genetic engineering pharmacological crops. It's actually in the mit literature
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.880]  But not given attention now
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:52.880]  Our next guest who I've interviewed many many years ago set probably 50 times
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.120]  Dane
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:00.080]  Wiggington is an amazing researcher geo engineering watch.org an engineer
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:04.000]  I'm not gonna get all the big things he's been involved in but when he learned about this over a decade ago
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.800]  He dedicated himself despite the fact he was running big solar farms around the country and very successful guy
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.440]  Because he realized it was so big and now he's gotten closer to the bottom
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.560]  Of the rabbit hole than probably anybody out there, but more and more they they admit
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:24.160]  Oh, the military is doing chemical cleanup and mosquito spraying and helping with the storms
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.160]  cloud seeding and oh, there's some drills going on and we have the
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:35.920]  Secretary of Defense William Cohen back in 1997 in a press briefing back then it was only text the pentagon
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.920]  Here it is on screen for radio listeners. You can just go to the u.s. Department of Defense type in
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.520]  DoD news briefing secretary defense William s Cohen
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.160]  presenter secretary defense William s Cohen
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.480]  april 28th 1997 here's the cia
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.840]  Breakdown as well admitting last year
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:09:01.920]  Uh, weather modification programs. There's the Atlantic monthly. There's the central intelligence agency admitting their expanded covert weather control
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.480]  council on farm relations
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:12.480]  Uh, I developing an international framework for geo engineering, but we have the 1978 treaty that began in 1972 and negotiations with Russia
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.880]  So we're talking about something real
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.520]  But they want to keep it academic while they do it calling all that testing
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.720]  They don't want to have a real debate a real discussion about what they're really doing
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.720]  but
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.600]  the incredible scientists researchers at geoengineeringwatch.org which is the number one
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.360]  Compendium of research you could get lost. I tried to make a film called dark skies before they ever had a movie called that
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.080]  And I just fell down a rabbit hole. It was all so admitted
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.800]  But all academic that I couldn't even believe
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.600]  How to respond and I realized what
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.360]  Dane was saying
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.360]  Wiggington is right
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:54.400]  That don't use the term chem trail that just came out of the public noticing it go to the Nobel prizes
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.200]  Go to the admissions go to the geoengineering go to the high altitude aerosol spring go to these
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:06.480]  Admitted programs. So we've got him for this segment the next to condense this down. I really appreciate him coming on. Let's go over it
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.680]  Could you have to could be back Alex and you know as you correctly stated
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:17.600]  In our portion this morning that the climate engineering particulates are trapping more heat than they deflect
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.520]  In our goal at geoengineeringwatch.org is to present solid data and Alex
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.920]  I hope that we can unite the tribes if you will in regard to certain common
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.240]  Mantras that there can't be again as I stated earlier in the first segment this morning
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.880]  Can't be any legitimate discussion about the state of the climate without including the climate engineering issue
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.880]  So we have the entire
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:42.800]  Analyst community the climate science community omitting the single greatest disrupting factor of all not the only
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:49.840]  Disrupting factor but the single greatest so if if we could unite the tribes if you will in the common mantra that none of us on any side
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:56.480]  Of the fence no one can have a legitimate discussion about the state of the climate without first and foremost including climate engineering
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:04.320]  Absolutely because Russia and China and Dubai they all admit. They've got antenna arrays doing it
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:09.520]  I mean they've got they've got chemical systems spraying and it's all public in their countries here
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:12.640]  They just say it's not going on but it turns out we pioneered it all
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.800]  That's exactly right and if people want to see just how
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.680]  documented this is we have a
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:26.000]  A report to senate report on geoengineeringwatch.org. It's a 750 page congressional document from 1978
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:30.320]  You can look at the document in its entirety research massive senate document geoengineering
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:35.280]  And on that document it states clearly that normally opposing
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:42.880]  Or adversarial governments will cooperate on the climate engineering issue because of the cross-border ramifications
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:46.800]  So there you have conclusive proof that all the major powers whatever their
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:56.400]  External conflicts appear to be that's publicized. They are absolutely colluding and cooperating on the climate engineering issue because obviously it affects the entire climate system
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.400]  so we have a
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.680]  quite a
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:04.160]  Global cabal and that's what's amazing under the congressional report that then becomes the UN treaty
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.280]  Is that they admit? Hey, we all want to do this. So we all agree. We're going to work with each other on
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:16.560]  Exactly. They all have their own agendas and objectives with these programs, but they're absolutely all including so how advanced is it?
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:22.640]  I mean, I know you you go to the the geoengineering summits, you know where they are there, you know, but a lot of it's classified
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.720]  I mean how far along is it?
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:30.880]  Well, last international conference I went to and confronted the most recognized geoengineer on the planet David Keith
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.040]  And your listeners can look at this conversation
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.000]  I think they would find it quite valuable if they search dain wiggins and David Keith
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.560]  They'll see me confronting David Keith after listening to a three and a half hour symposium of him
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.080]  Proposing the annual objective of dumping 20 million tons of aluminum nano particulates into the atmosphere
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:54.880]  My question to dr. Keith was had any studies been done whatsoever the toxicological effects human health effects
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:59.520]  And after him trying to dodge the question by stating that there's a lot of aerosols in the atmosphere already if
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.520]  A bit more won't make a difference
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:07.200]  But I reconfronted him that those aerosols aren't aluminum had he studied aluminum and he stated on the record that
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.640]  He had done no studies of the human toxicological effects and he said quote
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.280]  I'm quoting he said terrible things happen tomorrow. We don't know
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.080]  What kind of a statement is that from a quote unquote scientist that I was banned from the subsequent
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:23.120]  Conferences after that ground must be clear. I hadn't seen that video in years. I'm glad you reminded me of that
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:27.280]  I'm on your side. I see the text of it. Well, how do we search youtube or whatever to find that video?
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.920]  I want to play that clip when we come back because that's so powerful that then because you actually went
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:36.640]  Hey aluminum causes brain damage and he just he couldn't he said all there's already lots of toxic waste
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:41.280]  It's like saying, you know five guys already raped your wife. So how about a hundred or you know, we already shot you
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.280]  Want it's about three more bullets
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.160]  Yeah, that's that's the right line of thought for him
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:51.920]  If you search dain wiginton david keith geoengineering watch, you'll find that short clip. No question
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:58.720]  So continue because people pay attention during a hurricane. They want to make it about carbon taxes pay world government
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.800]  You know to fix this it's not going to fix it to shut down our plants and move into mexico
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.080]  I know we're affecting the climate the point is there's a bunch of secret programs
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:11.200]  So how do I make real decisions for my family when I don't know when it's all hidden under a national security state?
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.240]  Well, first again, if we can unite the tribes on every side of the fence with this common
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:20.640]  Understanding that you can't discuss the climate without discussing climate engineering
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.560]  So again, whatever person's point of view that has to be the front line of the conversation
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:30.800]  So let's look at Irma that just came from so far away and they knew the trajectory seven days ahead of time
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:37.680]  How did they know and interesting that cuba got annihilated and the relationship between us and cuba has deteriorated rapidly
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.400]  So cuba just got the full brunt of a parallel
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.160]  Track right along the shoreline did maximum damage to cuba
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.160]  Why did the hurricane then do a 90 degree turn and the high pressure zone?
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.160]  There's there's several ways of maneuvering the cyclones with radio frequency microwave transmissions
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.200]  You have the large transmitters like harp alex. I know you know what that is
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:01.760]  You have several dozen large ground base facilities like harp around the globe and they can create and do create high pressure domes
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:06.000]  Just like the ridiculously resilient ridge. It's frying us west right now alex
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.320]  That's what happened over the Gulf of Mexico that forced Irma to make a right hand turn and move up along the
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.640]  western side of Florida
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:20.400]  On the ground you have transmitters and we'll publish an article on this probably tomorrow a video that shows the transmissions of the ground
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:26.160]  Base transmitters that then take over can help to steer the hurricane from the ground. So the bottom line is this historical data proves
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.120]  We have 70 years 70 years of climate intervention
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.920]  You know what's going on
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:39.040]  All right, stay there and I've got main lines that reports cloud ionization electric rain making and laser guided weather modification
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.160]  This is even in mainstream newspapers that the arab countries don't hide this. They're proud of it
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:47.200]  They're turning the desert green with antennas
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:54.560]  That are ionizing and creating particulate for rain. I want to explain how that happens as most of you already know
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:16:01.280]  I am a voracious consumer of news and information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:07.760]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:14.080]  In many cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:20.400]  Of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and so I set out to develop caveman
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.920]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:31.440]  But seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time

[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:00.640]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:16.720]  We now take you live to the central texas command center
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:23.040]  In the heart of the resistance rallying patriots worldwide
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:29.920]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:39.200]  So here's what's happening. I'm just a lay researcher that reads government documents public stuff and they admit global
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.760]  weather treaties
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.760]  plans to reduce world population
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:49.120]  Post-industrial world race specific bio weapons. I've got department of defense
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:55.120]  press briefings admitting it from 1997. I've got un treaties. They're all on info wars dot com
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.320]  And then I talked to all the scientists
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:05.040]  astrophysicists meteorologists and say listen the geoengineering that's going on is what you do to fry the planet
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.040]  poison the soil the soil and kill people so what is
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:16.800]  Omnicide what is planetary death and what's the evidence showing that that's the direction they're going in?
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:23.600]  Again, we've got dain wiggington of geoengineering watch.org an amazing researcher. I've known for over 10 years
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:28.880]  Clearly this is happening the evidence shows it. What is it? What's behind it? We've got 10 minutes left
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:33.360]  Just spill your guts. Tell folks what they need to know about this. Omnicide
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.800]  On the side would express the
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:43.040]  disintegration of the entire web of life on the planet and that is absolutely the track we're on we can debate all the various causes
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.160]  But if we look at this mathematically speaking the single greatest assault against the web of life today is
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.040]  Climate engineering now, if I could plug this into something you said earlier
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:57.520]  And our again our first statement about the climate engineering particulates trapping more heat than they deflect which is exactly correct
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:00.400]  So if if we look at the
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:07.760]  Stated purpose of climate engineering primary stated purpose solar radiation management to block some of the sun's incoming thermal radiation
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:11.760]  When all available data makes clear that they are actually fueling
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:17.200]  The disintegration of the climate and the warming at the same time by trapping more heat than they deflect destroying the ozone layer
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:21.680]  Disrupting the hydrological cycle single greatest factor with the massive forest burn downs
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.120]  Contrary to what the environmental groups would tell us
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.680]  is not just
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:32.880]  Anthropogenic factors as a whole it's climate engineering because climate engineering poisons of soils
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:38.880]  Shredzio's own layer more UV exposure more dry lightning. We have an incendiary dust on the foliage
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:44.240]  I could go on and on so we have major factors that are most directly related related to climate engineering
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:50.400]  And that all fuels the feedback mechanisms that are disintegrating climate system which feeds into the omniside that's occurring right now
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.400]  So Alex, let's look at the logic behind this
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:23:00.080]  Solar radiation management to give the earth a higher albedo a higher reflectivity. Let's take Venus in comparison if this was the only
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:04.640]  Way to or this was a method by which you could actually cool the planet if that's their goal
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:09.360]  Let's look at Venus. Venus's albedo is two and a half times that of planet earth
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.880]  I was about to say Al Gore told us 20 years ago. We're going to become Venus
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.360]  Then the scientists are doing just what you do to turn us into that
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.040]  Well, it's it's feeding Venus syndrome. Geo engineering is fueling Venus syndrome. We have articles in geo engineering watch
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.560]  Anybody who wants to search geo gerrym watch dot org and then plug in whatever title you want to find they should fight an article about it
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:32.960]  So back to Venus. Venus is two and a half times more reflective than earth and it's 900 degrees on the ground
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:39.040]  Obviously, it's not just a reflective atmosphere that keeps the planet in a mode where it supports life
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:42.720]  And Venus all things being equal and many people don't know this Alex
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:45.600]  Venus would be 20 to 25 degrees warmer than earth
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.880]  Not 900 degrees at under winter runaway greenhouse and that reflective atmosphere didn't help much
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.880]  So back we're back to climate engineering
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:59.280]  Uniting the tribes on all sides of the fence. Climate engineering will be the biggest nail in our collective coffins if it continues
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:01.440]  So I'm not even a scientist
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:06.160]  But they admit that what they're doing unless you engineering causes the light to go through
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:13.600]  But stay and not bounce back out and we're it's actually causing this and the soils are full of aluminum and all this is happening
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.600]  Are these mad scientists? What's wrong with them?
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.720]  again, you have
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.280]  in any form of
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:27.440]  In any form of human activity that affects the energy balance of the planet is a form of geo engineering
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:33.760]  But the intentional climate intervention programs being mathematically the greatest disrupting factor of all and quite simply
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.600]  This is
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:41.600]  Human insanity at its epitome Alex and not only is it destroying the biosphere the earth's life support systems
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.880]  It's toxifying every breath we take toxifying soils
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:50.160]  And I encourage your listeners. We don't ask anybody to believe anything we say geo engineering watch or work
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:52.160]  We ask you to examine the data
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:57.680]  Our data from our nasa engineer that works with us and and alex in regard to mr. Trump something
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.400]  I thought you should know about this and let's hope that you know
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.400]  There's some different course of action that we see already
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:07.440]  One of the air force generals that works directly with us at geoengineering watch.org. He's a retired major general
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:08.720]  had
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.960]  Mr. Trump's top campaign people and mr. Carson's top campaign people in his home
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.440]  January 2016
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:16.880]  on a meeting
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.400]  strictly about geo engineering
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:24.320]  He supplied data that was given to him by geo during watch.org. So we know they know there's no question about that
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.160]  Unfortunately right now what we see is a ramping up of these programs a lot of scaling back
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:33.040]  And and over the oceans is where a lot of people don't know how much climate engineering is going on
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:36.480]  And we look at nasa imagery which I examine every day from all over the globe
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:41.440]  The amount of spraying going on over our oceans alex is unimaginable. This is trump's blind spot
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.640]  He loves america so much. He thinks the military is america
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:48.400]  And sure the average person of military sacrificing are some of our best people in my experience
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.680]  I love veterans
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:53.760]  But the some of these generals are really whacked out some of them are really great people like the one you're talking about
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:58.480]  Uh, and they're fighting hard, but yeah, he just lets them do whatever they want. It's well known
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:00.960]  He goes to the cia. He says you're great do whatever you want
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.840]  He goes to the department of energy do whatever you want if it helps america
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.880]  He really believes in the scientists and people he doesn't like bankers and bureaucrats and people
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:14.640]  But he does tend to just believe in whiz kids stuff and kind of just sign stuff over
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.920]  I think you and i would agree there's a lot of great people in us military
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  And they're being told that these operations are some planetary saving measure and that couldn't be further from the truth
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.640]  By the way, it shows how deep that's what i've been told by generals and and people currently in
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:34.560]  Is they're told they're saving the ozone, but the science shows it's killing it and let's go back to it. This is important
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:42.560]  Uh, because it's the same thing they do with this compartmentalization. They have kids textbooks saying they're spraying sunscreen
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:48.800]  So they admit to children the geoengineering is happening and bill gates is like a little videos for kids at school
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.920]  But then they tell us as adults don't discuss it. It's not happening
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.400]  Well, here's the bottom line
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.400]  We have to get this issue to light
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:00.800]  Immediately and everyone can play their part in that if they share credible data and as i stated
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:04.080]  No, i agree. It's all on your site. So let me ask you this what so you're talking to the high level military
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.480]  They're being told this is a earth saving event
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:11.200]  They are and this is where again, that's well, I was told by a high level operative
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.280]  They were told when it started 20 years ago
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.400]  They believe a global ice age was going to begin by 2020 and so they as if you could predict it
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:23.280]  But it is time in the next couple hundred years probably to start that they're stopping global cooling
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:28.160]  Well, the official science data would say exactly the opposite
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:32.080]  They're trying to slow a runaway greenhouse effect and the actual data from the ground would say they're
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:36.480]  They're fueling that effect not stopping it. They're as you correctly stated in the first segment
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.840]  They're trapping more hitting they deflect destroying the ozone layer and so forth
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.120]  So back to the ozone layer aside from any other environmental discussion
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:48.880]  If we had no other environmental problems the ozone layer alone if it collapses current data indicates that could occur
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:53.840]  And will occur on the current trajectory in four to eight years game over all the life over
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:59.760]  So again the readings we're getting right now from the official sources are all completely fictitious
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:04.480]  They have no bearing in reality. They don't measure any UV radiation below 300 nanometers
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:10.000]  And the DNA damaging bands of UVC are below that so there you can't find what you're not looking for Alex
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:15.280]  We're simply not being told that we're being bathed in dangerous UV radiation lethal UV radiation right now
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.920]  And by the way, I don't just believe you I we had it up earlier. We have the earthquake monitors
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:23.280]  We have all the government data. I went and you said that today. I saw it a few years ago
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:26.000]  I went look they admit UV is the highest ever recorded
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.520]  Uh, so do five more minutes with us. I want to look specifically with you about what
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.160]  Ozone collapse would look like because we know it's not just holes
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:40.480]  It is being depleted and as you said, it's not what's in our spray bottles
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:46.560]  What's happening? Why is it being depleted so fast because we know UVs up all over the planet
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:56.160]  What's going on? Skin cancer is way up. Why is this happening? We'll be back folks. Stay with us
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:01.040]  We've got great air filters great water filters great non-gmo
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.960]  early on seeds great books great films great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:09.920]  And we've got a new humongoid sale not the number of things that are on massive sale
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.280]  But on what's on sale out for months not been on sale for months and months
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:19.280]  We've never offered super male vitality known concentrated herbs cold-pressed super male vitality
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:28.000]  57% off it's never been the price it is right now with 3,596 reviews 4.6 reviews total by third party sites
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.640]  unprecedented and it's cold-pressed that's why super male is so different people say well
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:36.480]  I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science and these are other what you sell they
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:40.000]  Buzzfeed said it's like it's already best-selling stuff that's been certified as you know healthy and
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.480]  good forever why these aren't anything new because why do something new when you can have the oldest
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:57.440]  and best but cold-pressed do not agree you develop living defense for us it took you over a year to
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:02.480]  do it why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:08.560]  much scares me the most I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:14.880]  beverages in my system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:19.360]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:25.600]  spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.560]  tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it you have the
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:34.240]  name in there you have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood I recommend doing a parasite
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:37.920]  cleanse at least twice a year all right well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:42.000]  going back on it today it just came back in yesterday living defense info warslife.com and

[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:23.360]  so hurricane ermine gets us focused on the fact that we're at earthquakes we've got storms
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:27.280]  we've got solar storms that are directly connected to all this we've got governments
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:32.960]  admittedly obsessed with trying to control the weather and manipulate it and then we have
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:37.120]  discussions about it they attack us despite all the stacks of their own admissions of it
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:43.840]  so some of the public to admit this is going on but let's look at the ozone layer let's look at
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:50.080]  the fact that more uv radiation is admittedly coming through dane wiggington of geoengineering
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:56.960]  watch.org let's break down what collapse of the ozone layer could look like because it's already
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:02.160]  starting to happen as you said the next four to six years it's what it would look like and we already
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:07.440]  see that in regard to let's take insect populations for example alex in northern california we work
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:12.720]  directly with retired forest service biologists we've seen a 90 percent decline 90 percent an
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:17.760]  aquatic and terrestrial insect populations in the last 10 years this is from the heavy metal
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:23.200]  contamination and the uv 90 percent of the insects thigh how long are we going to be around in regard
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:28.720]  to the military industrial complex propensity to keep doubling down on everything they do so the more
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.400]  they spray the more damage they do the more ozone destruction they cause the more they feel they have
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:37.920]  to spray to provide a shield from the destruction that was caused by what they were doing in the
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:42.880]  first place so this is the mentality we're dealing with and now alex i on the earlier segment i mentioned
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:46.800]  to you that the atmosphere is filling with methane that's something that we all need to discuss it's
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:51.840]  not cal flatulence it's massive methane deposits that are thawing freezing and entering the atmosphere
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:56.640]  covering the planet like a layer of gas so what's the military industrial complex response to that
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:02.720]  project lucy and project alamo the attempt to use microwave transmissions with opposing frequencies
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:07.120]  to try to degrade some of that methane in the atmosphere with consequences unknown further
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:12.480]  destroying the ozone layer so this is a race toward again total global omniside and so many
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:17.600]  of these roads lead right back to climate engineering continue to break this down
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:24.160]  well again on the current path if we don't deal with this issue first and foremost we'll have a
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:29.120]  planet that doesn't support life much longer it's already waning rapidly so it we're back to
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.960]  what's our priority what's our obvious priority and people from every side of the fence while
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:38.000]  they're arguing about the state of the climate why wouldn't we unite on a common cause unite the
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.320]  tribes on a common cause of exposing climate engineering because again you can't have any
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:47.360]  discussion about the climate without dealing with this issue first so i would argue that we have to
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:52.800]  all pull this load together and get this issue to the light of day or very soon we'll have nothing
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:59.520]  left to sell the job alex that's a mathematical fact what's wrong with the technocracy that's
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:05.600]  doing this well i would compare to a cancer alex and i have many times does a cancer
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:11.200]  intend to kill its host no it intends to proliferate at any cost and the host eventually dies so we
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:17.280]  have all these companies bowing lockheed martin all invested in this uh technology we have the
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:22.720]  disaster capitalist like monsanto that's uh reaping as you correctly stated earlier again
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:28.080]  genetically modified seeds aluminum resistant uv resistant seeds abiotic stress resistant seeds
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:32.240]  all capitalizing on the decimation being caused but at the same time the ship's going down by the
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:37.440]  day so this is comparable to pirates on a sinking ship loading their pockets with loot how far are
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:42.400]  they going to get not very far we're all going down in the same ship so the bottom line is
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:48.560]  above all other issues we must deal with this issue and if we don't we're a very very limited
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:53.200]  time horizon some of the products i heard in the break that you that you sell and market
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:59.440]  it i would argue not to put a put a plug in for info wars but the storeable foods and so for
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.880]  essential right now if you can't eat it or you can't drink it it's not going to be worth much
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:09.360]  to you in the very near future so those are very important items that people should think
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:14.160]  seriously about while they're also at the same time trying to help us sell me alarm that's so
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:18.880]  critical on this issue we all have to pull this way dane wiggington it's been a little too long
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:23.520]  since you've been on your side it's been years on it great job you and the scientists what you're
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:29.600]  doing let's talk again very soon thank you sir anytime since we have that perspective which is
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:39.760]  important angle let's go to a dr william soon harvard geophysicist and astrophysicist on what's
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:44.320]  happening with the sun's effect on the earth but the globals are trying to manipulate but can't
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:52.560]  fully control a standale earlier agreed here it is yes professor willie soon is a solar scientist
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:38:00.080]  and astrophysicist and a researcher out of harvard and he's very well skilled and and
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:05.920]  knowledge into solar cycles and so we're going to be joined by dr willie and he's going to be
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:12.240]  able to really kind of get deep in there and explain to us how the sun actually has a bigger
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:19.760]  impact on our environment than us as man which is such common sense i mean it really is common sense
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:26.160]  and it's kind of we're we're trying to dispel the hysteria out there that somehow if we don't
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:33.120]  do abc and d and a let let the scientists dictate policy then we are going to have the end of the
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:39.120]  world happen so really and truly that's why it's so important that we have professor willie soon
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:43.840]  come on and talk to us and by the way i live in salem massachusetts so we are very familiar with
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:49.040]  that well known phenomenon called witch burning indeed those are during the time where all this
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:55.120]  you know very very sad situation where they were they're having some kind of bad weather
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:00.480]  and where people decided to prosecute a lot of these so-called women that went crazy and
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:06.800]  a lot of witches they call them and for for brewing up this bad weather i mean it seems to me
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:12.240]  even by 21st century things doesn't change as much for those who insist that covered outside
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:16.640]  which is one of these what you call minor greenhouse gas that's a very important point
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:23.520]  to stress minor simply because its effect is known to be very small because a major greenhouse gas
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:30.320]  in the atmosphere or planet earth is water vapor i've been very fond of saying if you want to study
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:35.520]  the effect of greenhouse effect on the earth planet all you need to do is study water vapor
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:41.200]  that's it that's all you need to do that's why the sun argument is so convincing because it does
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:47.760]  vary in a typical way not every 11 years every 60 years or so every 200 years every 1000 years
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:51.920]  that sort of thing we can we have seen those cycles we have we have seen all of those cycles
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:58.080]  actually from actual data this is why the argument is more and more convincing as as far as i can
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:03.600]  tell you i mean or even in any scientific open discussion or debate you know so this is indeed
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:09.840]  a very fruitful direction to go and i in fact i have to tell you all the money they spent the last
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:16.960]  10 to 20 years i mean they barely give actually 5 percent to studying the sun in that sense
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:22.320]  they spent 95 of those wasted money on computer climate model that is completely it's almost
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:27.760]  useless in my in my sense because all they do is just copying each other in fact the whole world now
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:32.880]  has about 30 climate models each of them copying from each other is as if that they're doing some
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:37.600]  serious hard work okay and we actually see some of the strongest hurricanes we know about certainly
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:44.240]  the the one that has the most number of casualties on continental usa was the galveston hurricane
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:50.480]  of 1900 there wasn't much man-made pollution at that point in time but we can go even farther back
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:57.680]  to 1780 and that hurt the one in 1900 that killed about 12 000 people in the u.s but then we have
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:04.000]  one that killed uh i think it was about 30 some odd thousand in 1780 it nearly it sunk most of the
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  fleet of the french and the british in certain areas it had a massive impact on history as to
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.320]  whether or not we were going to win that war or not that was the direct result of that and so we
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:19.840]  know that there were dozens of ships tens of thousands of people that were lost at sea that
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:26.880]  the ships were overturned and uh the the devastation as described makes people realize that that was
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:31.280]  one of if not the strongest atlantic hurricane that we've ever had and that was in 1780 so we see
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:37.760]  these things happening cyclically and then there is no explanation that is going to explain this
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:45.120]  that is focused strictly on recent additions to carbon dioxide that they say are increasing
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:49.600]  linearly as we're going along we see something that is cyclical that's right this is why science
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:55.280]  is all about numbers too i mean the numbers for so msb carbon dioxide just doesn't add up i mean
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:00.560]  in fact you might make maybe it's a bad time to tell another joke if you if those who really
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:06.560]  want to insist on carbon dioxide causing all the damages from harvey and urma i think we should
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:13.120]  look for checks from elgo and john carrey obama and uh who else i mean icaprio i mean those guys
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:19.200]  would write a check that's one of the top astrophysicist on the planet from harvard most scientists
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:24.000]  say this man made global warming things are fraud it's the sun folks one million three hundred
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.920]  thousand earths fit inside of it it's what makes us have the summer it's what causes the hurricanes
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:34.320]  it runs the whole show it gives us sunburns it does everything but without it we're dead
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.600]  so i pray to jesus that's my god but if i was an atheist i'd worship the sun

[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.520]  i keep putting the sun up because that's what drives our weather
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:36.320]  the globalist can try to manipulate it they can try to control it but they don't
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:45.600]  know it's the equivalent of 1.3 million earths 1,300,000 earths it's a giant thermal nuclear
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:52.880]  explosion ongoing that's got such great mass there's a lot of suns in plow they think and make
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:48:00.800]  black holes that its mass is so great that it just contains the explosion what creates a black hole
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:10.560]  a spacetime warp where it's so huge it rips the the the dimensional firmament and remember equations
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:17.680]  knew this 200 years ago before they even found it and then goes into another universe wow we are
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:22.560]  alive in an incredible time and there are elites let me say this is one of the most important things
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.000]  i've ever said listen to me carefully i know you already know this innately you're gonna say we
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:34.480]  already know that alex but we need to understand this and talk about it the globalists are the
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:39.200]  technocracy they're the priest class they're the scientists and not all scientists are bad most
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:45.040]  scientists are great but these are very greedy people that have a glimpse of all this of ai and
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:50.000]  life extension and technology and everything we've got today would be magic a hundred years ago
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:57.280]  it'd be unfathomable five thousand years ago well we've already gotten 90% of the way there there's
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:03.760]  not much further for us to go until we've got life extension until technical immortality until
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:10.400]  building whole new planets as an individual will be just like we're made in the image of god this
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:16.560]  is a big prospect and there are people that are jealous who don't want you to have part of this
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:27.520]  and that's the big takeaway is that this is our embryonic our larval form and an advanced
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:32.720]  species like this that god's created is not going to be given the keys to the house the car and the
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:41.280]  company without a test we don't just get hatched up on the ceiling and the garage like wasp we've
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:49.280]  got to go through something in a big real world simulation live fire like the old days with the
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:53.520]  marines the army they really shot bullets over you a lot of times people got killed in every class
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:57.040]  they had to get rid of that because political correctness or now they just call it accidents
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:02.880]  but only real live fire drills test people and then that's what this is in every group knows
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:10.480]  this is the test the big thing's coming happening now marco island takes hit west coast florida
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:16.240]  bull's eye down to cat two looters in florida lauderdale i love how the police report that
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:21.120]  then they say alex jones and rush limbaugh and matt drudger being racist saying there's looters
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:26.640]  later they arrest anybody that didn't want i think harvey showed our unity i think this will
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:31.200]  show our unity as well i've celebrated our unity how do they counter that because it brings this
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:37.760]  together oh alex jones is against is against unity that's that's the big lie ladies and gentlemen
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:43.280]  just know this hollywood means nothing in closing i want to hit these reports
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:51.840]  trump calls for tax reform speed up in line of hurricane irma talks about how with texas and
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:59.600]  florida the second and third most popular states this is really causing a problem and he knows
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:05.600]  all the economists tell him you don't cut taxes the average person your recovery is going to stall
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:09.360]  that's why i like trump i'm not in league with trump it'd be great to go after him and get him
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:15.280]  on my back but i can't because it's the truth he's doing a good job then they bash him and say oh he
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:21.120]  sold out to the democrats the republican blue bloods are blocking a republican insurrection
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:25.680]  in the freedom caucus then they then the blue bloods try to manipulate the freedom caucus and
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:32.080]  say see he's selling you out the democrats no he tried to get your agenda of obamacare repeal
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:36.400]  and tax cuts through that's his agenda and then the blue bloods killed it with a democratic
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:41.040]  leadership but all the democrats want is power so trump doubles back because they want to shut
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:46.800]  down the economy for three months blaming on trump have standard and pours and moody's and barons
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:55.360]  lower our rating which has been planned have a new depression say it's the repeat of 1929
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:01.360]  with the smooth hallings and all the rest of it and trump's not going that direction so he says okay
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:05.760]  i'll i'll get the hurricane relief for texas and we know we're going to eat it for florida
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:10.320]  and i'll i'll go ahead and do your deal because he didn't create the big debt he didn't create
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:15.680]  the time bomb what kills its tax cuts and then flattening out spending he'd already gotten the
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:21.520]  national debt for the first time in 25 years just go down a little bit just with the exuberance just
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:26.880]  cutting the regulations just cutting the bureaucracy just promises the tax cuts he already had us back
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:31.600]  there and the globalist go no we don't want the prosperity system we want to pick and choose we want

[01:52:53.840 --> 01:53:01.440]  news and trump is bringing you americana that's why they hate him so bad yeah you see schumer all

[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:09.760]  you know he was stuck between the republicans and democrats blocking him they were about to
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:13.840]  blame him for the economy imploding he wasn't about to do it with the midst of these hurricanes
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:21.040]  he wants that wave of exuberance to continue and prosperity to defeat them took the raise of the
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:25.760]  sun making plants grow so we'll make it through this hurricane we can't make it through his
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:29.760]  lomification we can't make it through sexualization of our children we can't make it through
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:36.160]  globalization we have to make it through being strong and focusing bound to no party trump
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:41.840]  up ends 150 years of two-party rule even the new york times goes he's for real he means what he's
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:47.280]  saying that's why he's so dangerous he's overthrown the system he's horrible he's scary let's get rid
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:52.800]  of him they admit he keeps his promises he really believes it oh my god he's horrible what are we gonna
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:54:00.000]  do in the end he goes on when donald j trump set his sights the presidency in the 2000 election
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:04.960]  he pushed the nomination of the reform party a home for this enchanted independence the republican
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:08.960]  party has just moved too far to the right he explained the democrats too far to the left
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:13.760]  in the end he dropped the campaign of the reform party a leftover construct of ross perot two
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:18.080]  independent presidential campaigns during the 1990s it was one of the last five times that
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:23.520]  trump would switch party affiliations over the ten years i'm the lone ranger he once contended
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:29.840]  now in the white house president trump demonstrated this past week that he still imagines himself as
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:35.280]  a solitary cowboy as he abandoned republican congressional leaders to forge a short-term
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:39.920]  fiscal deal with democrats although elected as a republican last year trump has shown in
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:43.680]  the nearly eight months in office that he is in many ways the first independent to hold the
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:48.400]  presidency since the advent of the two-party system around the time of civil war that's right
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:54.320]  may finally truth for the new york times and just get on board with the american system
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:58.880]  and prosperity and letting middle class and poor people have some jobs and futures and then
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:03.680]  you elites can still be all powerful up there just you have to piss on us off your balconies
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:07.840]  because it makes you feel better and then we're not gonna let north korea have nuclear weapons
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:12.240]  and threaten everybody and we're not gonna roll over and move everything to china so goldman sacks
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:17.200]  can crap down our backs i mean they brag about mounting america's head on the wall why would
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:22.720]  you mount the engine of prosperity to the wall so that people with one inch wee wees would feel
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:29.440]  powerful there is no point to do any of this unless you're a satanic pedophile and trump
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:33.920]  it's not a devil worshipping potbelly pedophile and that's his great crime speaking of that
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:42.800]  here is george cloney his parents corrupt famous hollywood dons gave him his jobs forced fed him
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:49.120]  till he was 40 plus years old when he finally got a soap opera hit show on er or whatever it was
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:55.600]  cloney says that steven bannon is a butt liquor or would lick his rear end i'm sorry this is a real
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:01.920]  quote this is in the daily beast to be successful in hollywood and that bannon's a loser bannon was
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:06.560]  successful in the navy he was successful in hollywood he wasn't successful in banking
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:12.640]  he then helped trump spearhead a total come-behind victory to turn the republic around to turn the
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:19.040]  economy around with three point plus growth and to do everything in the face of this with info wars
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:23.760]  the liberty movement drudge and everybody else to give america a real shot at not being set up
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:29.360]  and bled dry by globalist vampires to build their world government and use some little boy
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:37.440]  who's famous in hollywood that they paid to have him put movies and tv shows for 30 years
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:45.280]  before he finally was on one hit tv show when he was already 40 plus years old this loser baby
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:51.760]  with his mommy and daddy wiping his butt till he was 40 years old doing everything for him
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:57.200]  and all he won't house any muslims he says bring in he pushes all his crap he said trump would never
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:03.520]  be president and now he comes out to look at steven bannon a true blue collar guy that came from a
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:08.880]  family that was literally at the poverty line but working at the shipping docks so i've looked at
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:13.360]  a steven bannon who was a hardcore democrat till he realized it was a lie and then and then you
