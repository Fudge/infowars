[00:00.000 --> 00:13.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.960 --> 00:34.280]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies
[00:34.280 --> 00:40.200]  and gentlemen welcome another transmission worldwide against tyranny on this ninth day
[00:40.200 --> 00:51.680]  of April 2009 is a Thursday edition coming up at 115 or in about two hours and 15 minutes
[00:51.680 --> 00:56.240]  towards Humphrey back in studio more on Obama a host of issues we didn't discuss when he
[00:56.240 --> 01:00.560]  was in studio with us last week so I want to have the economist and author and filmmaker
[01:00.560 --> 01:05.440]  in studio while he is back in town he lives all over the world and has a home here in
[01:05.440 --> 01:12.360]  Austin so while he's here we'll take advantage of that we've got Rosalind Peterson California
[01:12.360 --> 01:18.480]  Skywatch probably one of the most in-depth researchers with scientists and climatologists
[01:18.480 --> 01:23.000]  and others integrating the information and she's the one that uncovered a lot of government
[01:23.000 --> 01:33.280]  documents admitting that their chemtrails spraying the public now last year the council
[01:33.280 --> 01:42.480]  on foreign relations came out and said oh yes we need to start having basically ammonium
[01:42.480 --> 01:52.480]  you know different types of particles sulfur dioxide barium and a lot of other things
[01:52.480 --> 01:57.600]  aluminum dioxide mixed in with the jet fuel and it can be dispersed to the engines to
[01:57.600 --> 02:06.240]  block out the deadly rays of the sun and cool the planet from global warming and they said
[02:06.240 --> 02:09.560]  we're looking at doing it but when you read all the documents from the universities the
[02:09.560 --> 02:13.600]  department of energy and others they say oh no we've already been quote testing this
[02:13.600 --> 02:19.120]  since the mid-1990s and the evidence is actually voluminous but people don't like to go to
[02:19.120 --> 02:24.920]  the actual documents they like to just point cameras at the chemtrails and then basically
[02:24.920 --> 02:29.600]  the most quacky information is what ends up getting pushed and accepted and you know believed
[02:29.600 --> 02:34.920]  in I mean I'm not saying that this is some type of envelope they spray so the harp over
[02:34.920 --> 02:40.320]  the horizon radar can resonate with it there's actually some patents on that and I've interviewed
[02:40.320 --> 02:44.280]  the former head of harp and others admitting it is over the horizon radar is one of its
[02:44.280 --> 02:53.000]  usages and one of its usage one of its uses so I can't talk today but the point is we
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.840]  gotta stick with what we can prove and it is true they do have weather modification going
[02:56.840 --> 03:06.640]  on and it is true that before 1995-96 condensation trails disappeared within a few minutes maximum
[03:06.640 --> 03:11.200]  last night I'm playing baseball out in the yard with my children and I'm looking at two
[03:11.200 --> 03:14.440]  thousand three thousand feet in the air I mean they're right there I'm watching planes
[03:14.440 --> 03:21.320]  at thirty thousand feet you know specs up in the sky way above you know the two or three
[03:21.320 --> 03:25.640]  thousand feet I'm looking at with just chemtrail chemtrail chemtrail chemtrail chemtrail these
[03:25.640 --> 03:30.840]  are not ice crystals they lay down a thin trail within minutes it expands out to five
[03:30.840 --> 03:35.760]  ten fifteen times its size and then it could be fifty sixty seventy times its size create
[03:35.760 --> 03:43.040]  one one one spray of this could create a whole cloud bank that's what nuclei do that's what
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.840]  cloud seeding does so they are terraforming the planet NASA admits the planet is twenty
[03:47.840 --> 03:52.440]  percent darker so we've got one of the leading experts researchers she's a generalist she
[03:52.440 --> 04:05.040]  looks at it all joining us coming up coming up in the final hour today you know I don't
[04:05.040 --> 04:08.240]  think an hour long an hour interview is going to be enough but we'll just have her back
[04:08.240 --> 04:12.280]  again next week as this stuff is getting really hot because you know people wouldn't listen
[04:12.280 --> 04:16.880]  to us on this issue by and large when I would talk about it ten years ago and I'd say look
[04:16.880 --> 04:21.000]  I don't know what it is but we know there's weather modification programs that are declassified
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.520]  that look similar to this we know there's several at least several programs going on
[04:25.520 --> 04:35.160]  probably more but the government hasn't admitted it well now they have admitted it so people
[04:35.160 --> 04:41.280]  really can't be in denial on that front got a lot of other news coming up Obama to push
[04:41.280 --> 04:50.440]  to make twelve million illegal immigrants legal that's right New York Times Oberman is going
[04:50.440 --> 04:56.960]  after hair Obama saying he's basically a complete liar we got a complete list of previous
[04:56.960 --> 05:02.760]  myack reports music downloaders are terrorists Alex Jones here with a question what does
[05:02.760 --> 05:07.800]  humidity mean to you most people think of hot and sticky summer days but many people
[05:07.800 --> 05:12.080]  are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water
[05:12.080 --> 05:17.400]  that's why I'd like you to visit a cola blue dot com a cola blue is a state of the art
[05:17.400 --> 05:22.760]  atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air
[05:22.760 --> 05:41.240]  using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration
[05:41.240 --> 05:47.160]  the cola blue 28 your home ready to make close to seven gallons a day right out of the box
[05:47.160 --> 05:54.440]  they have a thirty-day money back guarantee call the cola blue right now at one eight hundred six nine one six zero four three that's one eight hundred six nine
[05:54.440 --> 06:01.920]  one six zero four three or visit the cola blue at E. C. L. L. B. L. U. E. dot com today in the new
[06:01.920 --> 06:08.160]  world orders war against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give
[06:08.160 --> 06:12.680]  them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to
[06:12.680 --> 06:18.320]  see the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[06:18.320 --> 06:23.400]  interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one
[06:23.400 --> 06:27.880]  in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[06:27.880 --> 06:34.560]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[06:34.560 --> 06:41.600]  that's fascist it's not about left to right it's about a one world government this film
[06:41.600 --> 06:48.720]  documents who Obama works for the lies he has told and his real agenda get your copy
[06:48.720 --> 06:54.200]  of the Obama deception today at info wars dot com or downloaded the super high quality
[06:54.200 --> 07:01.520]  of prison planet dot tv the Obama deception the people strike back hello this is steve
[07:01.520 --> 07:05.680]  shank alex has told you you have to get a supply of food but alex and I have decided
[07:05.680 --> 07:09.600]  that there are some of you that we really don't want to have food if you're a politician
[07:09.600 --> 07:14.280]  who voted for the bailout don't call e-foods direct if you agree with one guy screaming
[07:14.280 --> 07:20.040]  about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the earth is cooling don't call
[07:20.040 --> 07:24.320]  e-foods direct if you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people don't get
[07:24.320 --> 07:28.120]  food if you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending
[07:28.120 --> 07:32.280]  yourself and preventing the crime don't call e-foods direct if you believe the official
[07:32.280 --> 07:37.040]  report on 9 11 you won't need food if you think the warnings on the alex joneshow are
[07:37.040 --> 07:42.120]  foolish don't call e-foods direct for the rest of you go to e-foods direct dot com or
[07:42.120 --> 07:48.360]  call 800 409 5633 you can't possibly know or control what government corporate america
[07:48.360 --> 07:53.320]  or others will do but you can control what you do complete your supply now e-foods direct
[07:53.320 --> 08:08.320]  dot com 800 409 5633 800 409 5633 ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn
[08:23.320 --> 08:28.920]  you will find scores of links to the council on foreign relations website the true government
[08:28.920 --> 08:34.960]  of the united states the four thousand plus member lower house of the trilateral commission
[08:34.960 --> 08:39.240]  they openly brag that run the country and their design is to bring the nation down bankrupted
[08:39.240 --> 08:44.120]  bankrupt the middle class and create global governance i just read their quotes to that
[08:44.120 --> 08:51.240]  end yesterday but council on foreign relations geoengineering workshop on unilateral planetary
[08:51.240 --> 08:57.760]  scale geoengineering now this is a report about how they need planetary terraforming
[08:57.760 --> 09:02.240]  to save the earth from global warming to set the precedent that they can manipulate the
[09:02.240 --> 09:06.440]  atmosphere and do whatever they want when they want this is the main lining of control
[09:06.440 --> 09:12.480]  of the atmosphere now back in the 60s stanford research institute documented that they could
[09:12.480 --> 09:19.920]  create hurricanes kill hurricanes weaken hurricanes steer hurricanes make hurricanes stronger
[09:19.920 --> 09:25.160]  tornado systems you name it with simply a few cloud seeding aircraft they had perfected
[09:25.160 --> 09:33.400]  it then and i interviewed the father of weather weapons roland elingston ben livingston excuse
[09:33.400 --> 09:39.860]  me roland elingston was a veteran here in town he was given two thousand dollar day
[09:39.860 --> 09:43.360]  fines for three inch grass and was arrested by police because they wanted to take his
[09:43.360 --> 09:49.880]  property ben livingston i can't keep track of it anymore folks geoengineering workshop
[09:49.880 --> 09:58.720]  on unilateral planetary scale geoengineering so that's the type of stuff we have coming
[09:58.720 --> 10:03.160]  up later and and you see we've been exposing this for years so many people been tirelessly
[10:03.160 --> 10:09.800]  exposing it but now they're just kind of in hiding in plain view going yeah we're uh...
[10:09.800 --> 10:18.000]  been doing tests with thousands of uh... saudi's thousands of flights every uh... every month
[10:18.000 --> 10:25.560]  in the all over the world spring we're just testing manipulating the atmosphere i remember
[10:25.560 --> 10:29.200]  about five years ago there was a huge flood in south texas killed a whole bunch of people
[10:29.200 --> 10:33.440]  thirty something people in one day and there was a blurb in the san antonio paper said
[10:33.440 --> 10:39.360]  oh the navy was doing weather modification spring and but they say that's not what caused
[10:39.360 --> 10:46.280]  the record floods what does that mean what why would they even you know pop in pipe into
[10:46.280 --> 10:53.000]  the discussion say that all part of just acclimating acclimating and so all of this is real all
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.720]  of this is going on and i want to be clear though there's a whole separate area we cover
[10:58.720 --> 11:03.800]  this in end game blueprint for global enslavement with bbc roiders associated press you know
[11:03.800 --> 11:11.600]  just hundreds of mainstream articles government documents senate hearings where from the twenties
[11:11.600 --> 11:17.200]  through the nineties and right into two thousand and two that's the latest stuff it's been declassified
[11:17.200 --> 11:21.680]  i mean i've got rocky mountain news articles i've got associated press articles i've got
[11:21.680 --> 11:23.640]  uh...
[11:23.640 --> 11:29.560]  the daily oklahoma you know every town in oklahoma sprayed over the summer with subtilist
[11:29.560 --> 11:37.680]  global g live bacteria that causes spontaneous abortions and all mammals species
[11:37.680 --> 11:42.720]  the article says over spring was subtilist global g from fixed-wing aircraft at altitudes
[11:42.720 --> 11:45.880]  of two thousand feet and below
[11:45.880 --> 11:49.560]  where support were testing the spread of bio weapons with this
[11:49.560 --> 11:51.120]  uh... inert
[11:51.120 --> 11:53.920]  uh... you know non-threatening bacteria
[11:53.920 --> 11:56.360]  and then you google subtilist global g
[11:56.360 --> 12:00.560]  and you're on all the major sites you know university medical sites saying this is a
[12:00.560 --> 12:05.000]  very dangerous bacteria for all mammal species respiratory
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.320]  uh... you name it
[12:09.320 --> 12:14.480]  so and that's just one example i'm holding in on uh... to cover their
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.800]  of thousands remember this is a criminal eugenics government our government's been
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.600]  hijacked by bankers who believe in eugenics and financed hitler and everything else
[12:24.600 --> 12:26.880]  in the last century
[12:26.880 --> 12:30.400]  they're setting up the bioethics boards it's the mainline view in the biology
[12:30.400 --> 12:35.240]  departments that they've got a cold eighty ninety percent of the population doctor peter
[12:35.240 --> 12:38.120]  pianco all these people running around saying it constantly
[12:38.120 --> 12:42.400]  and then they're in control of the shadow government and they admittedly took four
[12:42.400 --> 12:43.800]  thousand plus
[12:43.800 --> 12:48.000]  u s foster children and radiated them to death
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.920]  just google radiation tested on children and you'll get
[12:53.920 --> 12:57.400]  atomic energy agency you know u n reports admitting it you'll get the
[12:57.400 --> 13:02.040]  department of energy apologizing for it how they took the little kids and strapped
[13:02.040 --> 13:05.000]  them down and radiated them to death
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.600]  all different you know variant some they have a light does some a medium does
[13:08.600 --> 13:09.880]  different types of
[13:09.880 --> 13:12.760]  you know uh... chambers they put them into frium
[13:12.760 --> 13:14.440]  and then they told israel
[13:14.440 --> 13:19.000]  will give you a couple billion bucks
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.640]  from the fifties until the early sixties for ten years if you take one hundred
[13:23.640 --> 13:30.640]  and ten thousand plus sephardic jewish children at specified for some reason
[13:32.040 --> 13:36.520]  that's the error of looking on average jews in the dark or skin jews
[13:36.520 --> 13:38.820]  and if you radiate them and so
[13:38.820 --> 13:40.800]  they took them and most of them
[13:40.800 --> 13:43.200]  died they were given different variants
[13:43.200 --> 13:44.220]  and that's
[13:44.220 --> 13:51.220]  jerusalem post her ads all major papers
[13:51.220 --> 13:55.900]  so there's thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands
[13:55.900 --> 13:59.100]  and thousands and thousands and thousands
[13:59.100 --> 14:00.380]  thousands
[14:00.380 --> 14:03.620]  of admitted programmes
[14:03.620 --> 14:08.420]  and some programs only one person a test of bioweapon on our lsd on
[14:08.420 --> 14:10.500]  in other programs there's
[14:10.500 --> 14:12.020]  hundreds of thousands
[14:12.020 --> 14:14.420]  there's eugenics programs for later
[14:14.420 --> 14:18.060]  five hundred plus thousand american women you would make
[14:18.060 --> 14:23.820]  lower than a b-plus on their test. That's the official documents. It's an in-game and sterilize them.
[14:26.300 --> 14:31.340]  So that's what this whole system is, and then we notice suddenly in the mid-90s that
[14:31.340 --> 14:38.700]  condensation trails start disappearing in hours, not even disappearing, expanding in hours and
[14:38.700 --> 14:52.140]  not going away in minutes. And then now I'm sitting here looking at 1992 reports.
[14:55.340 --> 15:00.220]  Look at this. Policy implications of greenhouse warming, mitigation, application, and science.
[15:00.220 --> 15:08.940]  1992, you can go read this government-funded report, Policy Implications of Greenhouse
[15:08.940 --> 15:18.060]  Warming, Mitigation, Adaptation, and Science Base, nap.edu, National Academy of Sciences,
[15:19.180 --> 15:22.860]  and they talk about chemtrail spraying and how they're going to do it. And boy, did they land.
[15:22.860 --> 15:26.300]  And you got a Nobel Prize winner, got a Nobel Prize right around that time.
[15:26.300 --> 15:32.540]  This is all hidden in plain view. Talking about having planes dispersed doesn't have
[15:32.540 --> 15:40.220]  to be mixed in with the fuel. And then you've got all these Council on Foreign Relations reports,
[15:40.220 --> 15:44.540]  May 5th, 2008. They just plowed another one two weeks ago. That's what Obama's Science
[15:44.540 --> 15:51.820]  Advisors talking about in the Associated Press in London Guardian saying, oh yeah,
[15:51.820 --> 15:57.740]  we may have to start geoengineering things. We may have to start spraying particulates to
[15:57.740 --> 16:05.660]  create cloud cover to protect us from the greenhouse effect. And actually, most of the studies show
[16:06.380 --> 16:11.420]  that I've seen, we talked to climatologists, that more cloud cover at first cools things down,
[16:11.420 --> 16:16.140]  but then heats things up. So it's just insane. I think they actually know we're going into
[16:16.140 --> 16:20.620]  an ice age and they're trying to heat things. These people are out of their minds.
[16:23.340 --> 16:27.420]  But I mean, here it all is. And you know, the issue here is that they're now introducing it.
[16:27.420 --> 16:33.580]  Oh yeah, we're going to start spraying you to save you. And then you read the actual documents.
[16:33.580 --> 16:39.980]  They call thousands of flights a month spraying us that they admit testing. Oh, we're having to,
[16:39.980 --> 16:43.820]  it was kind of like the, again, they've been spying on you with the NSA without warrants for
[16:43.820 --> 16:48.460]  years. And now they say, oh yeah, now we're passing a law to rectoactively make it okay. Or, oh yeah,
[16:48.460 --> 16:54.540]  we're building FEMA camps. You know, we built these camps and we've set up old military bases,
[16:54.540 --> 16:58.860]  but now we want a law giving it more funding and authorizing it.
[17:02.460 --> 17:06.700]  And the law is a complete blueprint of what we've laid out in films of how they're going to,
[17:06.700 --> 17:09.180]  how they have set up the camps, how they're going to introduce them to you,
[17:09.180 --> 17:13.180]  how they're going to sell them to you like they're Disneyland or something.
[17:16.060 --> 17:18.700]  And sure enough, that's how they're introducing them. Club FEMA.
[17:21.820 --> 17:26.220]  Look at this headline, London Guardian, Obama Climate Advisor Open to Geoengineering to
[17:26.220 --> 17:29.580]  Tackle Global Warming. So see, that's how they introduce it to you.
[17:29.580 --> 17:35.740]  Not with a bang, but with a whimper. Just, oh yeah.
[17:41.980 --> 17:46.700]  I can continue in the great spirit of Max Kaiser with him describing the fiat money,
[17:46.700 --> 17:51.980]  the trillions they're producing a month, the bankers, as you know, as worthless as passing gas,
[17:54.300 --> 17:58.460]  and continue the analogy. It's like opening the borders, legalizing all the illegals,
[17:58.460 --> 18:04.940]  trying to pass more gun laws, openly trying to set up a new world currency and ending the dollar
[18:04.940 --> 18:08.620]  hegemon. It's kind of like they're at a dinner party and they don't want to get up to go to the
[18:08.620 --> 18:15.260]  bathrooms. They just kind of try to let it slip out there, you know. It's like trying to silently
[18:15.260 --> 18:21.740]  pass gas at a dinner party. So the new old order does. Obama's now, oh yeah, his administration,
[18:21.740 --> 18:24.780]  his science advisor. And his first interview, the first thing he talks about is this. When I
[18:24.780 --> 18:30.540]  say Obama, you know, the voice of his administration, this is all scripted. The first thing they do is
[18:30.540 --> 18:35.660]  just kind of let this slip out. Everybody's like, what's that horrible smell? I don't know.
[18:37.020 --> 18:43.580]  A little bit of humor here, folks. If we don't laugh about this, we'll cry. And that's not good,
[18:43.580 --> 18:52.140]  is it? Paul Watson said an excellent story that links in all the CFR documents, government
[18:52.140 --> 18:58.860]  documents, AP reports, all of it. The government is already geoengineering the environment.
[19:00.300 --> 19:03.100]  The government is already geoengineering the environment.
[19:05.100 --> 19:09.420]  And then you can read this and it has links to the government, the admissions and the
[19:09.420 --> 19:16.220]  aerosol spraying campaign. You Google that and it's like literally thousands of documents.
[19:16.220 --> 19:23.580]  It will blow your mind. It is like the last scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where they
[19:23.580 --> 19:27.820]  go to that big warehouse and there's just thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of crates and
[19:27.820 --> 19:32.860]  boxes. It's like going into that warehouse and just popping crate after crate open and
[19:32.860 --> 19:37.100]  reading what they're doing to us. And they don't care. They know the public doesn't read scientific
[19:37.100 --> 19:43.340]  documents. But let me just explain. The global government is already spraying the atmosphere
[19:43.340 --> 19:49.180]  everywhere. And that's only one part of the program. I keep telling people when they're spraying at
[19:49.180 --> 19:54.380]  10,000 feet or 5,000 feet, that is not meant for your area. That's coming down somewhere else out
[19:54.380 --> 19:58.940]  of the jet stream. We'll be right back. I'll make my own observations about this in a bunch of other
[19:58.940 --> 20:06.460]  news. With our economy spiraling out of control, living in the soup kitchens may be right around
[20:06.460 --> 20:12.780]  the corner. No one saw the financial collapse of 1929. Many didn't make it and millions ended up in
[20:12.780 --> 20:20.140]  soup lines becoming vagrants begging for food. Unlike 1929, we can see this collapse coming.
[20:20.140 --> 20:25.500]  We have been warned. And right now we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage
[20:25.500 --> 20:30.380]  into our homes before it's too late. Too late. Why is the Canadian government telling their
[20:30.380 --> 20:35.420]  citizens to stock up? Why? And why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food
[20:35.420 --> 20:40.460]  storage? Supplies are running low. Having food storage today may be just as important to your
[20:40.460 --> 20:45.980]  family's survival as boarding the ARC was in the days of NOAA. Order right now and receive free

[21:04.380 --> 21:09.980]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force
[21:09.980 --> 21:16.700]  that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded. The Obama deception completely
[21:16.700 --> 21:21.180]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[21:21.180 --> 21:26.860]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue
[21:26.860 --> 21:32.460]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group
[21:32.460 --> 21:38.860]  of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right.
[21:38.860 --> 21:43.900]  It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for,
[21:43.900 --> 21:50.380]  the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[22:12.380 --> 22:19.820]  for a quarter ounce. That's $902.19, $451.10, and $225.50. 70% of China's one trillion reserves
[22:19.820 --> 22:24.940]  are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro. Japanese refiners
[22:24.940 --> 22:30.060]  buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen. Bad news for US currency. China and Japan hold
[22:30.060 --> 22:34.940]  large positions in dollar. Trading equals permanent loss. Dollars fall into 65% of euro,
[22:34.940 --> 22:40.220]  erosion accelerates. Countries despise imperialistic policy of US, loss of confidence causing more
[22:40.220 --> 22:45.180]  selling. GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control. Why attack Iran? Jerome O'Corsies,

[23:02.700 --> 23:07.900]  on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells? Think about that. Would you swallow

[24:23.340 --> 24:34.380]  But somehow they just don't end up as mine. It's a death-defying life I lead. I take my chances.
[24:34.380 --> 24:44.380]  I dive for a living in the movies and TV. But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leading
[24:44.380 --> 24:53.260]  ladies kiss some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee. I might fall from a tall building.
[24:53.260 --> 24:58.220]  I might pull a brand new car. We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us.
[25:02.700 --> 25:10.300]  Now, if you study how the jet streams, there's quite a few major jet streams and a whole bunch of
[25:10.300 --> 25:16.940]  sub-streams. They go up to 100,000 feet. They come down to 70,000 feet. They go back to 30,000
[25:16.940 --> 25:24.780]  feet. They come in to ground zero. And one of the larger jet streams comes in right over New
[25:24.780 --> 25:31.740]  Mexico, Texas, Louisiana. It moves back and forth about 500, 600 mile area every few days.
[25:31.740 --> 25:36.940]  You can watch the satellite feeds, just Google satellite feeds, jet streams, and then find
[25:36.940 --> 25:42.620]  that jet stream. You can watch the seven-day animation they do from the different satellite
[25:42.620 --> 25:48.460]  photos. You can see the jet stream moving back and forth. And you'll see it. It dumps on average
[25:48.460 --> 25:54.380]  right over the middle of Texas. And that's why you'll always hear, oh, there's red dirt over
[25:54.380 --> 26:01.180]  everybody's cars today. That came in from China and Mongolia. And that's why universities study how
[26:01.180 --> 26:07.340]  spiders and bugs and gnats frozen, because they get put up into the upper atmosphere. They get caught
[26:07.340 --> 26:15.820]  up in the wind, taken up, sometimes junk, balloons that have already popped, pieces of paper from
[26:15.820 --> 26:22.620]  all over Asia come raining down in Texas. That's because the jet stream dumps right in over New
[26:22.620 --> 26:28.700]  Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, sometimes going out as far as the Panhandle of Florida and Mississippi.
[26:28.700 --> 26:35.820]  And that's why China burning all the toxic waste and, I mean, this pollution is a real
[26:35.820 --> 26:42.700]  issue environmentally. That is just coming right into Texas. Some of it dumps into the Gulf of
[26:42.700 --> 26:50.540]  Mexico. But I'm already digressing. This is the issue with the atmosphere. That's why every time
[26:50.540 --> 26:56.380]  they use depleted uranium in a war in Afghanistan or Iraq, uranium detectors that they have in the
[26:56.380 --> 27:02.380]  United States and Canada and England all go off the charts and in Europe, because the jet stream
[27:02.380 --> 27:06.380]  is blowing across the United States, across the Atlantic, across the Mediterranean, across the
[27:06.380 --> 27:13.660]  Middle East, across Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, right across the Pacific and then right
[27:13.660 --> 27:18.300]  through the United States and then back over England. And then it goes around and around that way.
[27:18.940 --> 27:24.700]  Around and around it goes. So they use depleted uranium. I mean, it's in the tens of thousands
[27:24.700 --> 27:30.140]  of tons now. It's so poisonous, not just radioactive, but poisonous, just deadly.
[27:30.940 --> 27:36.620]  And that stuff is raining down. They've used thousands and thousands. I forget the ratio
[27:36.620 --> 27:45.740]  with some ridiculous amount. More uranium than the contamination of actual A-bombs and hydrogen
[27:45.740 --> 27:51.020]  bombs. I've had Dr. Doug Rocky and others on the number is so ridiculous because what?
[27:51.020 --> 27:59.420]  But you reduce uranium down, you know, 99 plus percent. And then that's all the DU you've got
[27:59.420 --> 28:03.980]  left. It's still radioactive. It's still poisonous. It's still a tiny particular. It's still horrible.
[28:04.780 --> 28:10.140]  It puts off a different type of radiation. And then that's what they've got as DU. And then they
[28:10.140 --> 28:14.140]  use that in proving grounds all over the Western world. They're now selling it to third world
[28:14.140 --> 28:17.660]  countries that are using it at their shooting ranges in their proving grounds, you know, with
[28:17.660 --> 28:21.980]  their tanks and planes do bombing runs and strafing runs. And they're serving it out in small
[28:21.980 --> 28:31.580]  ammo, 50 cal, 223, 308, 7.6239. So that's all blowing around all day.
[28:34.620 --> 28:37.660]  And I got invited out to Las Vegas to watch the ultimate fighting. And I went ahead and did it
[28:37.660 --> 28:41.260]  because Joe invited me so many times to the host of it. I went out there and I was talking to this
[28:41.260 --> 28:47.980]  Israeli guy, his friends with Joe, and I explained to him that Israel used DU in the Gaza and that
[28:47.980 --> 28:54.780]  they also used it in Lebanon. And of course, he was from Israel. He knew that the, you know,
[28:54.780 --> 28:58.940]  winds blew across the Met over Israel. He went, oh yeah, they did use that. That's crazy. Israel's
[28:58.940 --> 29:03.500]  breathing that. I mean, you know, some people may not even care about the Gazans or whatever,
[29:03.500 --> 29:07.820]  but if this is a weapon, it's like a gun that shoots both ways. You pull the trigger and shoot
[29:07.820 --> 29:15.180]  your enemy and then it shoots you right back in the face. It's ridiculous. But I'm already digressing
[29:15.180 --> 29:21.180]  off chemtrails. You know, why are they genetically engineering most of the major food crops knowing
[29:21.180 --> 29:26.300]  that it's spreading into other plants and causing horrible problems? You know, why are the globalists
[29:26.300 --> 29:31.180]  setting up Hadron super colliders that their own scientists admit could destroy the planet?
[29:31.180 --> 29:38.780]  This is the stuff created the A bomb, you know, they just can't help it. Why do they admit the Pentagon
[29:38.780 --> 29:44.940]  detonated hundreds and hundreds of weapons in the atmosphere and one night 50 plus hydrogen bombs
[29:44.940 --> 29:50.460]  trying to set the atmosphere on fire in the 60s and they put that on Discovery Channel and brag
[29:50.460 --> 30:01.820]  about it. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[31:05.820 --> 31:11.740]  tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think
[31:11.740 --> 31:17.500]  all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[31:17.500 --> 31:22.300]  for the best interest of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged
[31:22.300 --> 31:27.740]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[31:27.740 --> 31:35.100]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.

[33:04.300 --> 33:10.620]  All right, we're back live. By the way, Captain Kelly Sweeney is one of the preeminent maritime
[33:10.620 --> 33:17.500]  riders, both for major magazines and best-selling book. He got, they fought off a hijacking of
[33:17.500 --> 33:25.980]  their giant ship in the Caribbean, what off the coast of Haiti. And maritimeheadhunters.com is
[33:25.980 --> 33:32.140]  the website because they're always, all the also recruit people for big companies. So he's a top
[33:32.140 --> 33:37.100]  captain, one of the top captains in the world. And he actually knows the captain of the big ship
[33:37.100 --> 33:41.820]  that got hijacked a few days ago. And there's the hostage negotiations happening right now.
[33:41.820 --> 33:48.300]  They've got the captain now off the ship in a rubber dinghy at gunpoint in some negotiation.
[33:48.300 --> 33:54.620]  So that's coming up in about 26 minutes. We're going to have him pop in with a report for us.
[33:54.620 --> 33:58.300]  I thought to contact him yesterday and then he contacted us. So I guess our brains think alike.
[33:59.020 --> 34:05.260]  So that is coming up with Captain Kelly Sweeney. And he knows the inside scuttlebutt,
[34:06.620 --> 34:10.620]  as they say in that industry, with all the captains and people. So you're going to get some
[34:10.620 --> 34:14.780]  inside scoop of what's really going on with this 20 plus Americans held hostage.
[34:15.820 --> 34:19.820]  I'll say 20 plus is 20 Americans and some other crew. And so we'll give you all the
[34:19.820 --> 34:26.380]  latest details on that. U.S. Navy reaches ship hijacked by Somali pirates. A U.S. Navy vessel
[34:26.380 --> 34:30.940]  has arrived at the U.S. flag cargo ship, whose captain was being held captive by pirates off
[34:30.940 --> 34:38.380]  the coast of Somalia. Crew members earlier retook control of the Maserick, Alabama,
[34:38.380 --> 34:41.820]  which was hijacked off the coast of Somalia Wednesday, but the ship's captain was still
[34:41.820 --> 34:46.540]  being held hostage. So you got battles going on here. That's what Captain Sweeney and their guys
[34:46.540 --> 34:51.820]  did. They blasted and killed. I had them on a few months ago. Memory Serves. They killed a couple
[34:51.820 --> 35:00.540]  of them. So these are ships that are fighting back. So that is coming up. I'll give you the
[35:00.540 --> 35:09.820]  latest on that. I was reading from the economic times of India just now. That was what that report
[35:09.820 --> 35:15.980]  was from. Okay. Going back, I'm going to make a chem trail film after the next Obama film.
[35:15.980 --> 35:20.300]  Obama is too important because they've got their whole new order agenda of open borders,
[35:20.300 --> 35:25.660]  massive tax increases, increasing trips to menace Russia and start a new cold war,
[35:25.660 --> 35:32.300]  menace China, but while selling out more of our sovereignty, global currencies, stealing 12.8
[35:32.300 --> 35:37.180]  trillion so far. I mean, this is their man. They're making their move on every level of this guy.
[35:37.180 --> 35:41.980]  So we're Obama deception, hard hitting, exposing the bankers, exposing the real paradigm,
[35:41.980 --> 35:45.180]  showing what their world government agenda is. You show this to an Obamanoid.
[35:45.180 --> 35:49.980]  It's waking up over 90%. And this is the feedback we're getting online and people that are showing
[35:49.980 --> 35:56.060]  their Obama zombie neighbors. This is snapping them out of their trance. This is having a huge
[35:56.060 --> 36:04.380]  effect. So get the Obama deception at infowars.com. Watch it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[36:40.060 --> 36:45.900]  background, his lies, his fraud, how he's not even African. We're going to go ahead and get
[36:45.900 --> 36:49.100]  into the passport and all the rest of it. I want to do that in the second film because he couldn't
[36:49.100 --> 36:53.180]  even get a passport with the type of birth certificate he has. That's the point we're making.
[36:53.180 --> 36:56.700]  But that's a small part of it. We get into the economics and being all these economists. It's
[36:56.700 --> 37:01.500]  going to be really hard heading with a plan to get us out of this and a plan to arrest the bankers.
[37:01.500 --> 37:06.380]  So that's the next Obama film I'm racing. I've got our people dispatched in New York,
[37:06.380 --> 37:11.260]  Aaron's just now taking off to go to Kansas City. I've got people dispatched next week
[37:11.980 --> 37:16.780]  to go cover the oath keepers that are going to be in Lexington, Massachusetts.
[37:17.420 --> 37:20.380]  With all these police and military saying we're not going to confiscate guns, we're not going
[37:20.380 --> 37:24.220]  to follow the illegal orders in the New World Order. That's going to be in the film. A bunch of
[37:24.220 --> 37:28.620]  other stuff I'm not going to get into until you see the film just because I don't want to put the
[37:28.620 --> 37:33.420]  intel out about what we're doing. I don't want to be stopped. A lot of breaking stuff in this film.
[37:33.420 --> 37:37.660]  I'm working on that. And then I just want to make the announcement now.
[37:40.060 --> 37:43.820]  And I keep forgetting my new PO box. I need to give out to people. Can you have one of the
[37:43.820 --> 37:50.380]  guys run me in the PO box? I need to memorize that because if look, we can't do this all
[37:51.340 --> 37:56.380]  just like with the new Obama film I sent the working on now. I sent Rob do and Jason
[37:56.380 --> 38:03.980]  Douglas to California to San Diego, LA and Sacramento where they're trying to force people
[38:03.980 --> 38:07.900]  out of these tent cities into these basic prison camps where they're frisk and searched and
[38:07.900 --> 38:12.700]  controlled. And basically it's very hard to have jobs because they have to leave at five
[38:12.700 --> 38:19.420]  a.m. and be the back by three p.m. And they're going to force you to live in these facilities.
[38:19.420 --> 38:24.940]  This is a form of being a prisoner. I said, hey, we can't shoot all of this. We can't do all of this.
[38:24.940 --> 38:32.380]  I read the LA Times about another camp outside LA in Ontario, California,
[38:32.380 --> 38:35.660]  where they're taking the people's children, taking their dogs and taking their RVs.
[38:35.660 --> 38:40.380]  We got the same reports up where we went, but we don't have the assets to send crews everywhere.
[38:40.940 --> 38:45.340]  I need listeners to go to Ontario, California and shoot that. Now we did have folks up in
[38:45.340 --> 38:49.820]  Canada shoot some great video for us to show what's happening there. We'll put some of that in the
[38:49.820 --> 38:55.420]  film. But with the Chem Trail film that we need to start on now because I need to have all this.
[38:57.820 --> 39:03.340]  Here's an example. I don't have the money to hire two or three more camera people just here in
[39:03.340 --> 39:08.300]  Austin to go out on hilltops every day with time-lapse because they're spraying yesterday and today.
[39:08.300 --> 39:12.380]  I mean, they come in, they lay down the spray at about three, four thousand feet. These are not
[39:12.380 --> 39:19.420]  ice crystals. And you can watch in an hour a tiny spray trail turn into a giant cloud bank in front
[39:19.420 --> 39:25.420]  of your eyes. And I'm not whining or complaining. I'm saying we need your help, folks, because I'm
[39:25.420 --> 39:29.660]  doing five hours of radio yesterday, two hours, Raleigh James, another interview. I went on with
[39:29.660 --> 39:34.140]  Burma's. I'm taking care of all this other stuff. Directing films, writing questions for the guest
[39:34.140 --> 39:38.700]  we're interviewing when we send crews around the country. I've got to do this all. And we're
[39:38.700 --> 39:45.180]  going to shoot time-lapse and we're going to shoot, you know, but photographs that you take.
[39:45.180 --> 39:51.900]  Time-lapse video. We'd like you to show yourself driving around chemtrail hunting. We'd like to,
[39:51.900 --> 39:56.140]  you know, put all of you in the film. I'm going to make a big two-hour film about chemtrails,
[39:56.140 --> 39:59.980]  about the history of biological chemical testing on the people, radiological testing,
[39:59.980 --> 40:04.620]  about everything they're doing, their whole program, what's admitted, and then now what's
[40:04.620 --> 40:09.260]  really happening with the chemtrails, the different variants of that, and how they do spray barium,
[40:09.260 --> 40:13.740]  salts, and aluminum dioxide admittedly into the atmosphere. At key points, we're now noticing
[40:13.740 --> 40:19.660]  on the maps to come into other countries at their jet streams, where the jet streams come into near
[40:19.660 --> 40:26.380]  sea level. So we're noticing that the main chem... I've been noticing on the maps the main chemtrail
[40:26.380 --> 40:30.860]  activity. As you can look at NASA photos and see them everywhere, you know, blocking out the key
[40:30.860 --> 40:36.860]  areas. It's a key feeding areas where jet streams are coming in. So there's a lot of stuff going on
[40:36.860 --> 40:43.100]  here. They are poisonous, poisoning us with these. The globalists love multifaceted things. They love
[40:43.100 --> 40:48.220]  to be able to whack ten moles at one time, you know, to kill ten birds with one stone. Everything
[40:48.220 --> 40:53.660]  they do always has to hit on a bunch of cylinders, all cylinders for them. So they are terraforming
[40:53.660 --> 40:57.900]  and manipulating the atmosphere. There's no doubt of that. Darkening the planet, doing a lot of
[40:57.900 --> 41:04.460]  very strange things. But they're also poisoning us with this, but that's only one facet of the
[41:04.460 --> 41:09.100]  programs. I'm going to make a chemtrail film about it all. The low altitude spraying, they admit.
[41:09.100 --> 41:17.420]  So what I need you to do, folks, is shoot the footage and hey, you're welcome to go make your own
[41:17.420 --> 41:21.820]  chemtrail film. If you want to be in my film and you want your footage in there and you want to,
[41:21.820 --> 41:25.500]  you know, all of us combining forces together, and I'll put the sucker out for free on the web
[41:25.500 --> 41:30.860]  to fund it. Of course, we'll also sell the DVDs. If you want to be part of this, shoot the video,
[41:33.260 --> 41:37.420]  shoot yourselves talking, whatever. Send me a letter saying, I shot this. You have full
[41:37.420 --> 41:42.460]  authorization to use it. Send it to us because we got such a small crew. We don't have time to
[41:42.460 --> 41:46.300]  screw around, folks, and call you back and get you to send us letters and all this because I,
[41:46.300 --> 41:49.420]  you know, I can't, I think people try to set us up. Send us things so you can go ahead and use it
[41:49.420 --> 41:57.260]  verbally and then try stuff later. If you want to be in the chemtrail film, if you want to be
[41:57.260 --> 42:04.780]  in the chemtrail film, if you want your material to be used, shoot it, mail it to us. Okay? Because
[42:04.780 --> 42:08.540]  I can't be everywhere. If you're in Australia, if you're in England, I know they're spraying everywhere.
[42:08.540 --> 42:14.140]  If you're in Canada, if you're in Mexico, and I'm going to create a page on the site with all the
[42:14.140 --> 42:17.260]  government documents and links admitting all this, we're going to call it, you know, the Chemtrail
[42:17.260 --> 42:26.620]  Center, and I want everybody to mail all of this to us. And we will make the master film,
[42:26.620 --> 42:31.500]  but I want to race to make it, but also make it good. The minute July 4th done and the
[42:31.500 --> 42:37.340]  new Obama film is released, I will launch immediately in two months. Give myself three
[42:37.340 --> 42:41.020]  months because it takes a few weeks to have it mass produced and mastered and shipped because
[42:41.020 --> 42:46.220]  this time I had the DVDs come in for Obama Deception the day it was released or, you know,
[42:46.220 --> 42:50.540]  this actually came in some on the Friday before and then some on the Monday the 16th.
[42:50.540 --> 42:55.580]  And then we had to get caught up. It's about a week to get caught up shipping. Uh-uh. This time,
[42:55.580 --> 43:02.460]  take this next Obama film. We're going to have it done. Let me think. April, May,
[43:02.460 --> 43:05.820]  we're going to have it done the first week of June, have it sent off to be mass produced. We're
[43:05.820 --> 43:09.340]  going to have it a week and a half, two weeks before it's even released. And here's a little
[43:09.340 --> 43:13.580]  secret. We're going to have everything packed and ready to ship for people that have purchased it,
[43:14.860 --> 43:18.380]  sitting in there, and we're going to start shipping it three days before the official
[43:18.380 --> 43:22.700]  release date. So you literally get it. UPS on average takes three days. Somebody says four
[43:22.700 --> 43:27.020]  days in the U.S. You will get it on the release date. That's what we're doing. Same thing with this
[43:27.020 --> 43:31.420]  film. As soon as the Kim, we don't have time to screw around. Who knows how long they'll
[43:31.420 --> 43:34.220]  be on the internet. Who knows how long we're going to be. They're openly announcing,
[43:34.220 --> 43:40.460]  they're getting ready to shut down the web. They'll cut it up, reduce it. So we are just
[43:40.460 --> 43:45.420]  intensifying what we're doing on every front, but we don't have the money or the personnel. So
[43:46.700 --> 43:50.860]  fund us by buying the Obama deception and in game and truth rising and fabled enemies and
[43:50.860 --> 44:00.620]  everything. And it's just amazing. In fact, I'm all in. I keep giving these these little orders
[44:00.620 --> 44:07.660]  and we're so busy with taxes and bookkeeping and all this other stuff with 20 something employees.
[44:07.660 --> 44:11.260]  But why am I, you know, where we're at a status report, I need to get,
[44:15.980 --> 44:20.780]  I guess we just got to blow whatever reserves we've got. I want to hire two more video
[44:20.780 --> 44:25.100]  people, but part time now to go full scale on the Kim trails. We got to hire a weekend
[44:25.980 --> 44:30.460]  website editor so we can have them go through the email to post all the video and photos
[44:30.460 --> 44:33.660]  are being sent of troops running checkpoints. We don't even get that stuff up now.
[44:34.540 --> 44:39.100]  And I need it done now. I need it done now. So I need you guys to help me get this done now.
[44:39.100 --> 44:41.900]  In fact, I'll just stay home. I'll stay here. I'm not leaving. I think I'm going to put
[44:41.900 --> 44:45.420]  a set of caught up at this place and I'm not even leaving. I'm going to hire the people.
[44:45.420 --> 44:51.180]  I'm going to get it done because we don't have time to wait anymore. Hell is coming down on us.
[44:54.940 --> 44:59.820]  Now we need your financial support. So please go to, that's how you support us. Go buy the
[44:59.820 --> 45:03.660]  books and videos and info wars.com. Then you got something to wake people up with high quality
[45:03.660 --> 45:09.260]  material. Now that said, why am I getting more and more upset? It's getting crazy. I've seen two
[45:09.260 --> 45:15.020]  separate mainstream news articles attacking me trying to imply that, that this white supremacist
[45:15.020 --> 45:21.660]  who attacked me on all these websites, that even though they admit that, that he didn't like me,
[45:21.660 --> 45:25.180]  they're saying I caused him to go out and shoot these cops. Not that he threw a fit when mommy
[45:25.180 --> 45:29.980]  kicked him out and there was a domestic disturbance, which cops will tell you is the most dangerous
[45:29.980 --> 45:38.940]  thing to go to in the world. Now that's going on. And then in these articles, they'll say things
[45:38.940 --> 45:44.940]  like, and Jones and others are delusional lying saying the government will remote control your
[45:44.940 --> 45:50.540]  thermostats. Folks, I mean, you can Google government to remote control thermostats. You'll
[45:50.540 --> 45:57.820]  have Sacramento be San Francisco Chronicle LA times of the Oregonian. I'm mentioning the states
[45:57.820 --> 46:02.060]  that are now implementing it. You'll get the Dallas morning news. We got a letter a month ago
[46:02.700 --> 46:07.260]  and I told my office, do not let them in here. I want to try to challenge this legally telling
[46:07.260 --> 46:11.740]  us they're coming in to put in the smart box where they can remote control and are saying
[46:11.740 --> 46:16.540]  they're going to remote control our thermostats. Now that is in the news and I'm being called an
[46:16.540 --> 46:21.740]  insane liar for simply reporting that the feds want to put in remote control thermostats. The
[46:21.740 --> 46:28.940]  federal government in 1989 tried to pass a law to make cable companies have remote control systems
[46:28.940 --> 46:33.580]  in your house to take control of your TV for emergency announcements, but instead they went
[46:33.580 --> 46:39.020]  with the system to just have the whole cable company itself taken over where all channels
[46:39.020 --> 46:41.580]  are controlled by the government. That's the EAS system.
[46:46.060 --> 46:49.580]  But anyways, let me give you the PO box. Start now. Go out, shoot.
[46:50.860 --> 46:55.580]  The time lapse is what you need. Totally clear day showing the plane spraying and then so people
[46:55.580 --> 47:01.260]  can see him break out. Again, I've got all my camera men in other cities right now.
[47:01.260 --> 47:05.500]  I've got my editors in other cities. I don't have the personnel and I don't have the funds to really
[47:05.500 --> 47:12.700]  hire who I need to get this done. And I'm not whining, but man, we got to do it.
[47:12.700 --> 47:19.660]  All right, you want to write to me at Free Speech Systems. That's me, Alex Jones. Free Speech Systems
[47:19.660 --> 47:31.820]  Free Speech Systems or FSP, Free Speech Systems, PO Box, 1-9-549, PO Box, 1-9-549, Austin, Texas,
[47:31.820 --> 47:44.140]  787-60. Free Speech Systems, PO Box, 1-9-549, Austin, Texas, 787-60. Now, obviously we can't give out
[47:44.140 --> 47:48.700]  my physical address because we had upwards of 50 people a day showing up camping out at the other
[47:48.700 --> 47:55.500]  office that people discovered. And that's with us not advertising it. We're not at that office anymore.
[47:56.220 --> 47:59.740]  Supposedly it's hellish over there. People still over there every day because we've got to work,
[47:59.740 --> 48:03.500]  folks. We're working here. We're not complaining. People want to meet us. We just can't do it.
[48:04.140 --> 48:09.660]  The 3,001 South Lamar address, 3,001 South Lamar, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[48:10.780 --> 48:14.780]  Back when I started out and I was the guy making the films and I was the one person
[48:14.780 --> 48:20.780]  packaging them and shipping them in 97, 98, 99. And then with my wife later,
[48:25.180 --> 48:29.180]  the dental office that my daddy worked at, he said, I'll take your mail here.
[48:30.620 --> 48:33.660]  My dad's only part-time now. Doesn't even hardly work at that office.
[48:35.100 --> 48:39.500]  Who knows how long he'll even be there. He's probably going to retire or move company probably
[48:39.500 --> 48:44.300]  soon. So you show up over there. My dad isn't there. It's a mailing address. They're getting
[48:44.300 --> 48:50.060]  really sick of it. Don't show up over at that office. I'm not, and it'll only go there more.
[48:50.060 --> 48:53.740]  It won't matter. Nobody will be there as soon as it doesn't matter. This is the address
[48:53.740 --> 48:57.900]  that you mail stuff to. I just want to get that out to people because I've always been using
[48:57.900 --> 49:01.500]  that dental office address over there and they can hardly conduct business because of what's
[49:01.500 --> 49:14.780]  happening. So our address is free speech systems PO box one nine five four nine Austin Texas seven eight seven six zero. Okay.
[49:15.580 --> 49:24.620]  PO box one nine five four nine Austin Texas seven eight seven six zero. That is our big fat PO box.
[49:24.620 --> 49:31.820]  Big old PO box. Now again, I'm too busy. If you send us photos without a letter saying we
[49:31.820 --> 49:37.260]  can't use it or how you want to be credited, we can't do it. And if you want to be credited at the
[49:37.260 --> 49:41.740]  end, I'll do stuff like that. If you want to have your website up there, unless it's Nazi's
[49:41.740 --> 49:46.780]  Highling Hitler, I'm not putting that in there or naked people or something. You know, I'm not
[49:46.780 --> 49:50.060]  going to, but you know, if you've got a website, we'll put a link to that at the end. You know,
[49:50.060 --> 49:57.420]  in the credit bottom line, if it's good stuff, you know, we want to see, you know, you, you talking,
[49:57.420 --> 50:00.780]  you and your car driving, drinking coffee or whatever, going out there. We want to make this
[50:00.780 --> 50:07.180]  about you, the chemtrail hunters. So this is probably going to be the biggest film I've ever
[50:07.180 --> 50:12.460]  made. I've been waiting because I knew the public, I knew they were going to announce it was real.
[50:12.460 --> 50:18.140]  And they've been doing that now for about a year. And I, people weren't ready for me to get into
[50:18.140 --> 50:21.900]  this. I mean, we've had guests on probably a hundred times on it. We've talked about it, but
[50:21.900 --> 50:25.820]  they weren't ready for me to, I mean, I shot a weather modification interview for prison
[50:25.820 --> 50:31.260]  planet.TV members with Ben Livingston four years ago, five years ago, and never put it in a film.
[50:31.260 --> 50:36.620]  It's, it's waiting to be in this film. This is a film many years in the making. So we want you
[50:36.620 --> 50:41.500]  to be part of it. We appreciate all of you out there. Go out there, shoot the time lapse, shoot
[50:41.500 --> 50:48.140]  the chemtrails, get it all for us. We're going to make the chemtrail film and it'll be out
[50:48.940 --> 50:55.100]  in T minus five and a half months. We'll be right back with tons of news. Obama's going to legalize
[50:55.100 --> 50:58.380]  the illegal aliens. The economy is in continual implosion. Stay with us.
[51:01.580 --> 51:06.300]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems
[51:06.300 --> 51:10.540]  facing the US and the world. And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need
[51:10.540 --> 51:15.820]  for preparedness. Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest

[52:00.860 --> 52:06.700]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[52:06.700 --> 52:11.340]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful,
[52:11.340 --> 52:17.100]  just as strong, just as well-funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the
[52:17.100 --> 52:22.300]  myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already
[52:22.300 --> 52:27.900]  fudging, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[52:27.900 --> 52:34.220]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[52:34.220 --> 52:40.460]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[52:40.460 --> 52:48.220]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy

[54:42.380 --> 54:51.980]  And boy, the devil is close behind, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:58.220 --> 55:01.660]  All right, we are back live here. We got Captain Sweeney coming up.
[55:02.380 --> 55:06.780]  Back, John, just get him up right at the start of the the all around. Some stations don't care
[55:06.780 --> 55:11.580]  that first five minutes. I thought they should. Then there's an ad break there at the five after
[55:11.580 --> 55:15.580]  the eight after because, you know, we cover a lot more news and that's the most stuff you hear on
[55:15.580 --> 55:20.940]  there. But regardless, let's get Sweeney on immediately about the hijacking. And then I've
[55:20.940 --> 55:24.540]  got in studio George Humphrey to get into some other issues we didn't cover last week. And then
[55:24.540 --> 55:29.740]  we've got the chemtrail expert. He's a general systems analyst. That's what I meant by generalist.
[55:29.740 --> 55:33.740]  She studies all the basics of chemtrails, integrates in all the data. Just a great
[55:33.740 --> 55:38.620]  guest coming up very informative with the government saying, oh, yeah, we're gonna start spraying the
[55:38.620 --> 55:44.460]  skies, you know, with particular with nuclei to create a sunscreen. And then they have kids
[55:44.460 --> 55:48.780]  textbooks for public schools. Oh, the government spraying you. That's what those trails are for
[55:48.780 --> 55:53.900]  your safety. And then adult parents go, Hey, what's this in the textbook? Nevermind doesn't exist.
[55:53.900 --> 55:59.820]  It also says world government, new world order. And don't trust your parents. Oh, well, don't read
[55:59.820 --> 56:07.020]  that doesn't exist. Quiet. I mean, the reeducation is just going on. Here's the other news I'm going
[56:07.020 --> 56:12.460]  to get into more later. Obama to push to make 12 million illegal immigrants legal. This is out
[56:12.460 --> 56:17.500]  of the New York Times. Obama to make immigration bill a priority despite risk. And they admit
[56:17.500 --> 56:22.620]  it said 90 plus percent, 91% in Gallup Pollard against it. 80 plus percent of Hispanics in
[56:22.620 --> 56:28.940]  Gallup Pollard against it. But the media always frames it like Hispanics want to legalize all
[56:28.940 --> 56:34.140]  the illegals and they want to basically have the North American Union. And then Hispanics
[56:34.140 --> 56:37.980]  hear that and go, Oh, well, I guess I better be with other Hispanics when 80 plus percent are
[56:37.980 --> 56:41.900]  against it. They know it's driving down wages, breaking down the country, hurting the nation.
[56:41.900 --> 56:46.940]  They're patriotic like anybody else. But then white yuppies that have the guilt complex and
[56:46.940 --> 56:52.460]  let me go around fawning when the media tells them to say, uh, you know, Hispanics want open
[56:52.460 --> 56:59.740]  borders. You're not against Mexicans. Are you? And they're like, no, I want the giant third world
[56:59.740 --> 57:04.380]  country of 100 million people run by crime terrorists, basically a kleptocracy that's
[57:04.380 --> 57:09.260]  that's collapsing to be merged with us and further bankrupt the states. And I love cholera
[57:09.260 --> 57:14.140]  and leprosy and drug resistant TV spreading everywhere and brain worms killing people every
[57:14.140 --> 57:19.260]  day. Oh, don't believe me. Just Google brain worms. And you can watch mainstream newscast
[57:19.260 --> 57:23.740]  about that. And that's mainly coming out of Mexico. Oh, yes, worms that eat your brain.
[57:23.740 --> 57:28.860]  You think I'm making this up, folks? I'm not making this up. So proof is stranger than fiction.
[57:28.860 --> 57:34.700]  All of this is happening. All of this is going on. And it's totally unpopular, just like giving
[57:34.700 --> 57:39.980]  the banks 12.8 trillion in six months is unpopular, just like going for total blank
[57:39.980 --> 57:44.140]  and amnesty is unpopular, just like Obama's now said, yeah, I'm just going to wire tap
[57:44.140 --> 57:49.020]  and spy on everybody. And he sees he's, he's, he's outdoing Bush. Even Jonathan Turley law
[57:49.020 --> 57:54.700]  professor says that Keith Oberman's having to admit it worse than Bush, worse than Bush.
[57:54.700 --> 58:02.220]  Bush. That's why Biden said he's going to do things that are very unpopular. His job is to
[58:02.220 --> 58:08.380]  be destroyed. His job is to come in with everybody thinking he's the savior and then betray everyone.
[58:08.380 --> 58:12.620]  And by then we're going to be in a totally collapsed martial law state. And it isn't going
[58:12.620 --> 58:19.020]  to matter, ladies and gentlemen. Meanwhile, the controlled corporate left funded by George Soros
[58:19.020 --> 58:28.060]  and others, literally media matters and others paid for by him is attacking me right now,
[58:28.060 --> 58:32.140]  making it all about Alex Jones. See, because they can't stand up for what they believe in and what
[58:32.140 --> 58:36.140]  they're pushing, which is totally corrupt and evil. They got all naked about Alex Jones,
[58:36.140 --> 58:44.700]  the right winger and Rush Limbaugh will be right back. Thank you for listening to GCN.

[1:00:16.300 --> 1:00:31.580]  Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:37.900 --> 1:00:44.380]  We got Captain Kelly Sweeney joining us in a moment. The hostage situation has had some major
[1:00:44.380 --> 1:00:50.540]  changes in the last 30 minutes or so and he's, of course, successfully repelled a pirate attack
[1:00:50.540 --> 1:00:55.500]  on their large ship before killing some of the pirates and he knows the captain that's now been
[1:00:55.500 --> 1:01:00.300]  kidnapped. So we're going to go to Captain Sweeney in just a moment. But Rob Dew is just in our video
[1:01:00.300 --> 1:01:06.140]  room where we're recording C-span of the things and this is what he caught. Tell folks Rob Dew,
[1:01:06.140 --> 1:01:10.780]  my producer. Yeah, so Larry Summers is being interviewed by this guy and it's just him and
[1:01:10.780 --> 1:01:15.500]  this other guy up on stage. I think it's the economic press club and it just happened live.
[1:01:16.460 --> 1:01:20.540]  And behind him, there was two people. They were basically yelling to the crowd. They had a giant
[1:01:20.540 --> 1:01:25.900]  banner says we want our money back and they were telling him he needs to resign. He's responsible
[1:01:25.900 --> 1:01:30.460]  for this and he's just sitting there kind of smiling, you know, nervous. Were we recording
[1:01:30.460 --> 1:01:34.540]  that? I hope we were. I don't know, but I put the thing in and started recording. So we want
[1:01:34.540 --> 1:01:39.180]  recording. We probably missed it. Well, we can maybe record it when we re-hears on C-span.
[1:01:39.180 --> 1:01:43.420]  Exactly. I'm recording now. So anything else that comes out won't happen now. But anyways,
[1:01:43.420 --> 1:01:48.620]  I mean, this is an example of arrest the criminals, arrest the bankers. We have got to go after these
[1:01:48.620 --> 1:01:52.940]  people. Yeah, I agree. And one other thing, if you're sending in stuff for the Kim Trails movie,
[1:01:52.940 --> 1:01:57.260]  please put it attention Kim Trails. Otherwise, it might get lost in the shuffle because we do get
[1:01:57.260 --> 1:02:02.060]  a lot of mail. How many emails you get now on that? I don't even want to talk about it. But hey,
[1:02:02.060 --> 1:02:05.260]  I do thank everybody for sending their email. Hey, keep sending them out. Yeah. Do you know what?
[1:02:05.260 --> 1:02:09.580]  Just put it in a folder. Yeah, because we controls folder and we're doing massive research and we
[1:02:09.580 --> 1:02:13.820]  need your help on this. Okay, Rob, thank you so much. Let's let's let's try to find out
[1:02:13.820 --> 1:02:17.100]  when that's going to re-air. I'm sure the news will probably cover it. I got to have that
[1:02:17.100 --> 1:02:22.060]  because these criminals have to be arrested. Good job, my friend. Okay, now going just for
[1:02:22.060 --> 1:02:25.580]  the next 20 minutes or so, then I'm going to get into the other news, including Keith
[1:02:25.580 --> 1:02:31.100]  Auburn admitting Obama is worse than Bush on torture and secret arrest. That's right. Worse,
[1:02:31.100 --> 1:02:39.420]  we told you. This guy is pure evil. Kelly Sweeney, Mariner's notebook, professionalmariner.com.
[1:02:40.860 --> 1:02:47.820]  And he also, of course, has a website, maritimeheadhunters.com. And he has his book about how they
[1:02:47.820 --> 1:02:51.820]  successfully repelled a one of the most famous pirate attacks in the Caribbean.
[1:02:53.260 --> 1:02:57.740]  And he knows the captain of the ship that was hijacked a few days ago off the coast of Somalia.
[1:02:57.740 --> 1:03:01.980]  There's been new developments in the hostage negotiations. They're saying the crew re-took
[1:03:01.980 --> 1:03:07.340]  the ship somehow, but they still have the captain and some dinghy. So to bring clarity to this is
[1:03:07.340 --> 1:03:11.820]  one of the most famous living captains out there today, Kelly Sweeney. Captain, it's good to have
[1:03:11.820 --> 1:03:15.420]  you back with us. Boy, I like the great being back with you and all your listeners. And boy,
[1:03:15.420 --> 1:03:19.900]  that's very kind of you. I don't, I don't think of myself as a famous guy. That's very kind of you.
[1:03:19.900 --> 1:03:24.700]  Well, when you look into famous captains, I think of you as famous, my friend.
[1:03:24.700 --> 1:03:30.380]  Well, you know what comes with that, all the problems. But let's, let's, I mean, just we're
[1:03:30.380 --> 1:03:33.740]  about to break, we just recap who you are, quickly so folks know you are. And then we're going to
[1:03:33.740 --> 1:03:39.420]  come back and tell us the latest, you know, the captain of this big ship that was, that was freebooted.
[1:03:40.060 --> 1:03:44.460]  Yes. The guy who's on there now, Shane Murphy, I stay with him. But anyway,
[1:03:44.460 --> 1:03:50.860]  Captain Kelly Sweeney, I'm a master mariner and a master joining vessels both. I have a bachelor's
[1:03:50.860 --> 1:03:56.700]  science degree in nautical industrial technology from California Maritime Academy in 83. I've been
[1:03:56.700 --> 1:04:00.780]  on many different vessels of my career. I'm a columnist for professional mariner magazine,
[1:04:00.780 --> 1:04:05.820]  one of the most widely read maritime magazines in the country. And author of the book from The
[1:04:05.820 --> 1:04:11.580]  Bridge, which people can get off my website, maritimeheadinners.com. And in addition to all
[1:04:11.580 --> 1:04:16.140]  that, I also hook people up with jobs. And the last time we were on together in December,
[1:04:16.140 --> 1:04:21.020]  one of your listeners from Hawaii emailed me and I got him a job and he's on a ship in Taiwan
[1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:27.980]  right now. Oh, great. But in any case, so I do that. And now the guy who's in charge on the
[1:04:27.980 --> 1:04:33.100]  vessel now, Shane Murphy, he's not the one in the lifeboat. That's Captain Phillips. Shane was the
[1:04:33.100 --> 1:04:39.100]  chief, Shane was the chief officer. And he led the crew revolt after the pilots came on or the
[1:04:39.100 --> 1:04:46.220]  pirates came on. And he led the revolt and took back control of the ship. And at this point now,
[1:04:46.220 --> 1:04:52.380]  his master of the vessel is steaming towards Kenya. All right, stay there. There's been a revolt.
[1:04:53.260 --> 1:04:58.700]  It's a fluid situation. We have Captain Kelly Sweeney on who knows some of the people on board
[1:04:58.700 --> 1:05:04.700]  that ship. Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products,

[1:06:00.460 --> 1:06:07.420]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[1:06:07.420 --> 1:06:13.740]  got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as
[1:06:13.740 --> 1:06:19.740]  well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[1:06:19.740 --> 1:06:25.020]  interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in
[1:06:25.020 --> 1:06:30.140]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:06:30.140 --> 1:06:36.060]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:41.660]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film
[1:06:41.660 --> 1:06:48.940]  documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the

[1:08:23.580 --> 1:08:35.500]  Okay, Captain Kelly Sweeney. Again, break down exactly what's happening, the people you know
[1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:40.380]  on the ship, the inside scuttlebot plus the news. You're watching on what's happening with the
[1:08:40.380 --> 1:08:46.460]  hijacking of the ship with 20 Americans on board off the coast of Somalia. Yes, so here's, so here's
[1:08:46.460 --> 1:08:53.820]  the what happened. I got a mutual friend of ours, another master, emailed me yesterday hours before
[1:08:53.820 --> 1:08:58.380]  this story broke and told me, you know, Shane's been hijacked and he's being held hostage and
[1:08:58.380 --> 1:09:04.220]  oh no. So I, he was in contact with the family of a buddy of mine and so we, I've been keeping
[1:09:04.220 --> 1:09:08.060]  track of it all the way along here and what's been going on is this. This ship was on what's
[1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:14.380]  called the, what we call the grain run. It's a humanitarian aid run running a government aid
[1:09:14.380 --> 1:09:19.740]  cargo up and down the coast of Africa. And I know I've known a lot of different people that
[1:09:19.740 --> 1:09:23.980]  have been on these, this run over the years and it's just a pretty much a steady gig all the time.
[1:09:23.980 --> 1:09:29.420]  Well, this ship was carrying that stuff and so they were about 380 miles off the coast where they
[1:09:29.420 --> 1:09:36.460]  got hit. Now they were unarmed and so the pirates were able with their weaponry and their skill were
[1:09:36.460 --> 1:09:43.260]  able to get aboard and hijack the vessel. And then the crew revolted and the way it normally
[1:09:43.260 --> 1:09:47.260]  works with the security plans that we have on board. I'm a certified vessel security officer
[1:09:47.260 --> 1:09:53.180]  as well. And what we normally do is we have a safe room where everybody goes on board
[1:09:53.180 --> 1:09:57.980]  and they kind of, you take a muster and make sure who's here, who's not here and so on so forth.
[1:09:58.620 --> 1:10:07.260]  And so as I understand that's what happened. Then there was a revolt by the crew that attacked
[1:10:07.260 --> 1:10:12.460]  the pirates that were on board. Oh good. They had a minute up in the drink and then they had one
[1:10:12.460 --> 1:10:21.180]  pirate that was being held by the crew and then the pirates had, were down on the vessel and then
[1:10:21.180 --> 1:10:27.500]  they had the master. Now their varying reports, the report that I had, one report that I had was
[1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:31.660]  was that Captain Phillips who was a permanent master offered himself an exchange for the crew.
[1:10:32.540 --> 1:10:39.500]  And I have not been able to confirm that but that's the word. So then at that point when they tried
[1:10:39.500 --> 1:10:47.100]  to do a switch, an exchange, the crew let the pirate go and it was hoping to get the captain back
[1:10:47.100 --> 1:10:53.100]  well then the pirates didn't let the captain back. So now what the situation is, is that you have a
[1:10:53.100 --> 1:11:00.700]  captain, the permanent captain, Phillips is his name, and he's in the lifeboat down with the pirates
[1:11:00.700 --> 1:11:05.420]  who were armed and holding him hostage. Then you have the crew up on there and the first officer,
[1:11:05.420 --> 1:11:10.460]  Shane Murphy, the guy that I know, has now been promoted because of this terrible situation,
[1:11:10.460 --> 1:11:15.020]  has now controlled the vessel. The first officer always assumes command when the captain's not
[1:11:15.020 --> 1:11:21.260]  there. And so now Shane is the master of the vessel and starts trying to negotiate the release
[1:11:21.260 --> 1:11:28.780]  of the captain. That has been unsuccessful. So what happened then was that the warship,
[1:11:28.780 --> 1:11:34.060]  the Navy warship, the Bainbridge, started heading that way and then they had a P3 surveillance vessel,
[1:11:34.060 --> 1:11:39.100]  an aircraft that was monitoring the situation off the coast. But we're still talking hundreds
[1:11:39.100 --> 1:11:47.020]  of miles off the east coast of Somalia. So in any case, at that point the Navy came on,
[1:11:47.020 --> 1:11:55.340]  boarded the Marysk, Alabama, and has now, as I understand, is moving towards
[1:11:55.340 --> 1:12:03.580]  Mombasa under its own power and being escorted. The captain, the permanent captain, Phillips,
[1:12:04.220 --> 1:12:10.060]  is in a desperate situation because he is being held hostage on the lifeboat that is dead in the
[1:12:10.060 --> 1:12:17.180]  water, which I understand does not have any fuel. They burned up the small amount of fuel that
[1:12:17.180 --> 1:12:26.620]  the lifeboat has. And at this point is drifting surrounded by the U.S. military, but the pirates
[1:12:26.620 --> 1:12:32.220]  have him being held hostage. So we've gone from a hijack situation and the crew revolted
[1:12:32.780 --> 1:12:37.100]  and they were unarmed. So I have to find out later on how that happened. Nobody's been
[1:12:37.100 --> 1:12:42.220]  sure exactly how it happened. But I know Shane for having sailed with him and actually he was on
[1:12:42.220 --> 1:12:47.100]  board when we got hit by pirates on my watch, Christmas night 2003, which you and I talked about
[1:12:47.100 --> 1:12:53.660]  in the Rio Hina Dominican Republic, he was on that ship. In any case, Shane is a very strong,
[1:12:53.660 --> 1:12:59.660]  aggressive, intelligent man. And I know that he is a proactive kind of guy. So he's not just going
[1:12:59.660 --> 1:13:04.860]  to sit by and let things happen. He went after it and he succeeded and the rest of the crew
[1:13:04.860 --> 1:13:09.260]  succeeded. And I give those people a lot of credit. That's a great thing.
[1:13:09.260 --> 1:13:15.100]  But then again, we go back to the point of why are governments trying to prohibit ships from
[1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:20.860]  being armed? The Israelis are armed and nobody dare touch them. So now we have unarmed men fighting
[1:13:20.860 --> 1:13:26.700]  off armed pirates with AK-47s and no doubt grenade launchers. They always have those 300 miles out
[1:13:26.700 --> 1:13:33.180]  in the ocean. This is disgusting that this has happened. I agree 100%. I give the crew and the
[1:13:33.180 --> 1:13:37.420]  heroism and then Kevin Phillips offering himself up. I mean, he doesn't get any better than that.
[1:13:37.420 --> 1:13:42.860]  I mean, that's just sheer professionalism. And I give the Navy credit at least that they headed
[1:13:42.860 --> 1:13:48.540]  out there after it happened and responded quickly once they knew. But I agree 100% with you and
[1:13:48.540 --> 1:13:52.460]  you and I discussed this previously. This should have never happened in the first place. And I
[1:13:52.460 --> 1:13:57.740]  believe if they had been armed or they had an armed guard contingent on board, which I suggested
[1:13:57.740 --> 1:14:02.220]  and commented on your show last time we were together and they didn't do that. This would have
[1:14:02.220 --> 1:14:06.780]  maybe never happened in the first place. But what about your mates that worked under you on
[1:14:06.780 --> 1:14:12.860]  another ship, the number two guy there, now the captain? I mean, this is amazing. He's been
[1:14:13.420 --> 1:14:18.940]  pirated twice, but you guys successfully repelled the attack. Briefly recap what happened there.
[1:14:20.940 --> 1:14:25.900]  We were in Rio Hina, Dominican Republic, which is a well-known piracy area. Even though Somalia
[1:14:25.900 --> 1:14:30.300]  is where the piracy is in the news, piracy is rampant worldwide. As a matter of fact,
[1:14:30.300 --> 1:14:35.580]  and I don't want to digress too much, but a recreational boater, he and his wife, if they
[1:14:35.580 --> 1:14:40.860]  were from England, they were both grandparents taking his dream sail around the retirement
[1:14:40.860 --> 1:14:45.980]  sail around the world in their sailboat, were attacked by pirates off the coast of Thailand.
[1:14:45.980 --> 1:14:50.940]  He got his head blown off. This was just a few weeks ago. He got his head blown off and they
[1:14:50.940 --> 1:14:57.820]  tied up his wife, grandmother and rater and left her for dead. And this is a recreational
[1:14:57.820 --> 1:15:03.980]  boater, but piracy is rampant worldwide. But in Somalia, it's a heavy duty. In Rio
[1:15:03.980 --> 1:15:09.180]  Hina, Dominican Republic and the Caribbean is another high-risk area, and the company knew that,
[1:15:09.180 --> 1:15:14.060]  but they put armed guards on board our vessel, which people will get the book. And by the way,
[1:15:14.060 --> 1:15:19.580]  Alex, anybody that goes through the website, I'm going to cut them 10% off the price of the book
[1:15:19.580 --> 1:15:23.820]  and give them free shipping. Yeah, tell folks about the book from the bridge. Yeah, from the
[1:15:23.820 --> 1:15:28.620]  bridge and page, I think it's page 92 or 94, some of the picture of me with those two armed guards
[1:15:28.620 --> 1:15:34.140]  hours before the pirates hit our vessel at Christmas night. And they can actually see those
[1:15:34.140 --> 1:15:38.060]  guys with their weapons. And I'm standing right next, right between them, and it's a great shot.
[1:15:38.060 --> 1:15:44.300]  In any case, I'm on watch. Pirates board the vessel right after midnight. These two armed guards,
[1:15:44.300 --> 1:15:50.940]  I see them go by. I lock down the ship, sound the alarm, everything on our end. Everybody
[1:15:50.940 --> 1:15:56.060]  starts moving. We go to the safe area and I go back to investigate. And on my way back there,
[1:15:56.060 --> 1:16:00.060]  the pirates ended up getting in a shootout with the two armed guards. And when the pirate ended
[1:16:00.060 --> 1:16:06.220]  up dead, half his head blown off in the Rio Hina in the Hina River. And we have no idea how many
[1:16:06.220 --> 1:16:12.220]  people boarded us, but I do know that one didn't make it back. And they stole a lot of equipment
[1:16:12.220 --> 1:16:16.460]  and stuff off the vessel while we were there. I mean, nobody even knew it, but one of them
[1:16:16.460 --> 1:16:20.860]  paid with his life. But Shane was on there that night. He happened to be sleeping, or he's on
[1:16:20.860 --> 1:16:26.620]  a different watch. But Shane was on there, was my watch, and it was my responsibility. And that's
[1:16:26.620 --> 1:16:33.340]  what happened. You know, I just can't, absolutely, I just can't imagine raping a woman. I mean,
[1:16:33.340 --> 1:16:38.060]  I thought the whole thing was you want them willing. You know, that's the fun part. I mean,
[1:16:38.060 --> 1:16:43.180]  that's the whole issue. But I mean, just to scum how they routinely kill people, they pirate in
[1:16:43.180 --> 1:16:48.060]  the pleasure boats, correct? And then can you imagine killing her husband and raping her?
[1:16:48.060 --> 1:16:53.740]  And then the governments are saying, no, citizens will not be armed on the seas. You will take it
[1:16:53.740 --> 1:16:58.780]  because they hate setting the precedent that it's our responsibility and job to protect ourselves
[1:16:58.780 --> 1:17:03.820]  because the nanny state wants to play God. It's amazing to me, I agree. And this woman,
[1:17:03.820 --> 1:17:08.220]  she described having to climb through her husband's blood to get out of the, get off the vessel.
[1:17:08.780 --> 1:17:13.580]  And I mean, I can't even imagine, you know, I can only imagine how traumatic and how terrible
[1:17:13.580 --> 1:17:20.860]  that must have been. And, you know, but in any case, the official word from a number of shipping
[1:17:20.860 --> 1:17:25.740]  companies and from the IMO, the International Maritime Organization, is that, well, mariners,
[1:17:25.740 --> 1:17:30.940]  merchant mariners, because we're civilian, we're not military, we're paid to carry people or like
[1:17:30.940 --> 1:17:35.660]  on a ferry back and forth from one place to another or goods, like in this case, from one place to
[1:17:35.660 --> 1:17:40.300]  another. That's what we do. But you know, the official word is, well, you guys are civilians
[1:17:40.300 --> 1:17:44.380]  and there's countries in the world that do not allow the private ownership of weapons like Canada,
[1:17:44.380 --> 1:17:49.180]  for example, or England, they have restrictions. And so these companies are using that excuse and
[1:17:49.180 --> 1:17:55.020]  the IMO is using that excuse to not arm merchant vessels, but obviously VIM container line,
[1:17:55.020 --> 1:18:01.020]  or a good buddy of mine works, a schoolmate of mine, they have a whole different policy because
[1:18:01.020 --> 1:18:05.020]  they're officially in the Israeli National Guard and everybody on board those vessels
[1:18:05.020 --> 1:18:09.340]  has an Uzi and they know how to use it. And I have never heard of one part being stupid enough
[1:18:09.340 --> 1:18:13.660]  to try to hijack a ZIM container line ship because they know they're going to be facing down 20 or
[1:18:13.660 --> 1:18:18.460]  25 or 26 or many on their board, Uzi and people who know how to use it. But again, Israel wants
[1:18:18.460 --> 1:18:23.900]  their people to actually, you know, be armed, be protected, because they're about, you know,
[1:18:23.900 --> 1:18:27.900]  their sovereignty. All these other countries want their people to be slaves. So of course,
[1:18:27.900 --> 1:18:32.140]  they don't want the message, you know, that people should be armed. This is just unbelievable.
[1:18:32.140 --> 1:18:39.180]  So currently, the captain 300 miles off the coast of Somalia, I mean, is the dinghy still going
[1:18:39.180 --> 1:18:45.740]  along with the light boat is drifting. The light boat is drifting out in the Indian Ocean right now.
[1:18:46.300 --> 1:18:51.820]  And the Navy is standing by there. And the the actual ship itself, as I understand, is heading
[1:18:51.820 --> 1:18:56.380]  towards Mombasa, which is where the port where it's heading to next. And so now we've gone from
[1:18:56.380 --> 1:19:01.740]  a hijacked situation. And Shane Murphy, who was number two, is now number one captain on board
[1:19:01.740 --> 1:19:06.780]  is taking the vessel out of harm's way. And the rest of the crew. And now we've got a hostage
[1:19:06.780 --> 1:19:13.340]  situation. The FBI now has people on board and they're working with the Navy FBI hostage experts
[1:19:13.900 --> 1:19:19.500]  on negotiating some kind of a settlement or whatever for a release for the captain. And
[1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:24.700]  there are many of us who are praying right now for the Captain Phillips and the, you know, the
[1:19:24.700 --> 1:19:30.300]  heroes, you know, the Merchant Marine heroes like Shane and the others who saved our vessel and also
[1:19:30.300 --> 1:19:34.620]  for Captain Phillips and hopefully for the Navy people to save Captain Phillips life.
[1:19:34.620 --> 1:19:37.740]  All right, let's do five more minutes on the other side. And then folks, I'm going to get
[1:19:37.740 --> 1:19:41.740]  into a host of other news that's very important. A lot of breaking big news today. But I want to
[1:19:41.740 --> 1:19:46.780]  specifically talk about from past experience with the Somalis who are completely out of their minds
[1:19:46.780 --> 1:19:52.620]  on average, very daring, by the way, very reckless how this is going to end. We should be praying for
[1:19:52.620 --> 1:19:57.660]  him. I mean, they need to understand that if they harm him, they just need to wipe that boat out.
[1:19:57.660 --> 1:20:05.740]  They need to let the Somalis know that the new world order beast is genetically modifying your
[1:20:05.740 --> 1:20:13.260]  food, genetically modifying, mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses
[1:20:14.460 --> 1:20:20.140]  without a long term food solution. Without a long term, you will have just two options,
[1:20:20.140 --> 1:20:27.980]  starve or surrender. Surrender. All canned food supplies will eventually run out. What then?

[1:21:01.420 --> 1:21:07.820]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got
[1:21:07.820 --> 1:21:13.340]  to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to sick.
[1:21:13.340 --> 1:21:18.780]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of
[1:21:18.780 --> 1:21:24.540]  the American people. Well Obama's already fudging. Yeah fudged since day one in this election. If you
[1:21:24.540 --> 1:21:30.540]  have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program
[1:21:30.540 --> 1:21:39.100]  of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left to right.
[1:21:39.100 --> 1:21:44.140]  It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama works for,

[1:21:57.740 --> 1:22:04.300]  The people strike back. On the average Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up
[1:22:04.300 --> 1:22:09.500]  enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately with taxation, the rising
[1:22:09.500 --> 1:22:14.780]  cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
[1:22:14.780 --> 1:22:19.420]  line. Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note
[1:22:19.420 --> 1:22:24.700]  forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes. These questions and more can
[1:22:24.700 --> 1:22:29.500]  be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron

[1:24:16.220 --> 1:24:20.300]  I mean here's the type of bizarre reports we've got about just out of their minds some of the
[1:24:20.300 --> 1:24:29.260]  Somalis are. This is from American Morning, CNN, Somali women flocking to port in hope of marrying
[1:24:29.260 --> 1:24:36.300]  pirates. So it's just a big carnival atmosphere as they go out on a daily basis robbing and
[1:24:36.300 --> 1:24:43.660]  killing and stealing off their coast and they've now tried to seize the aid ship. They got,
[1:24:43.660 --> 1:24:49.260]  there was a revolt against it. Again, an unarmed revolt. Again folks if you've got motivation
[1:24:49.260 --> 1:24:53.820]  there's nothing that can stop you as long as you, well anyways. Going back to Captain Sweeney,
[1:24:53.820 --> 1:24:59.100]  Kelly Sweeney who knows the acting captain right now. It was number two in command. The captain
[1:24:59.100 --> 1:25:05.260]  has been kidnapped. He's out there in this small boat and you've got the navy around him. How do
[1:25:05.260 --> 1:25:09.660]  you see this ending? I mean I know you don't want to you know state fate or something here but
[1:25:09.660 --> 1:25:15.500]  I mean will the Somalis be rational and understand that one way or the other it's better for them
[1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:19.260]  to give him up or do they think they're going to be able to be let free if they let him go?
[1:25:19.820 --> 1:25:27.100]  I'll be honest with you Alex. I have read comments at various times by pirates who have been
[1:25:27.100 --> 1:25:32.940]  interviewed on board vessels or ashore after they get ashore and every one of them said
[1:25:32.940 --> 1:25:42.060]  we're not afraid to die and that is very, you know that's scary because if you have that kind
[1:25:42.060 --> 1:25:48.700]  of attitude and there's people in this lifeboat drifting on the Indian Ocean and they might just
[1:25:48.700 --> 1:25:53.260]  say you know we're going to you know take the captain out and prove a point and we don't really
[1:25:53.260 --> 1:25:57.500]  care if we die because and most Somalis they're Muslim and I don't know if they have that attitude
[1:25:57.500 --> 1:26:03.660]  that you know that they're going to you know go to heaven or something because of that but in any
[1:26:03.660 --> 1:26:10.460]  case they're not afraid to die. What I hope happens is they'll be reasonable and understand that
[1:26:10.460 --> 1:26:16.620]  they really are at this point they're either going to have to give the captain up to save themselves
[1:26:16.620 --> 1:26:21.180]  and be arrested or they're going to get you know if they try to if they kill the captain I believe
[1:26:21.180 --> 1:26:25.740]  they're going to get blown out of the water almost instantaneously if they if you know because
[1:26:25.740 --> 1:26:32.140]  they're being watched and I think that if they if the military and the surveillance that's going on
[1:26:32.140 --> 1:26:36.220]  right now shows that they kill the captain they're going to get blown out of the water and they have
[1:26:36.220 --> 1:26:41.820]  to know that and I hope they they see reason and at least see that at this point they only have two
[1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:49.260]  ways they can go and that's it either give themselves up and the captain up or you know end up dying
[1:26:49.260 --> 1:26:56.620]  they're desperate people and this is a desperate situation and I you know I'm hoping that it comes
[1:26:56.620 --> 1:27:03.820]  out to a positive end now specifically what was the exchange with captain Phillips giving himself
[1:27:03.820 --> 1:27:11.180]  up as I understand he offered himself to save the crew that's what that's the one story nobody's
[1:27:11.180 --> 1:27:15.740]  obviously been able to confirm that but as I understand that's the story is that he offered
[1:27:15.740 --> 1:27:20.220]  himself to save the crew and then so the crew had one of the pirates hostage when they tried to
[1:27:20.220 --> 1:27:24.140]  make the exchange of pirates they let the one pirate go that they had but then they wouldn't
[1:27:24.140 --> 1:27:29.180]  give up the captain so basically they got the pirates got one of their own back but then the
[1:27:29.180 --> 1:27:33.980]  captain Phillips was still down there being held hostage so Shane took over and at this point they're
[1:27:33.980 --> 1:27:40.620]  heading out of there and I think personally I have a good friend over there right now and that's
[1:27:40.620 --> 1:27:45.980]  not far but probably a hundred a couple hundred miles from where they're at and his company has
[1:27:45.980 --> 1:27:52.300]  four armed guards on board their vessel they're Gherkas they're a bit the British outfit there's
[1:27:52.300 --> 1:27:57.580]  a Brit I think that's in charge of them and they have four armed guards patrolling that vessel
[1:27:57.580 --> 1:28:04.780]  at all times and they mean business and I think that either you arm the crews or you have or the
[1:28:04.780 --> 1:28:10.300]  companies pay for armed escorts like a convoy situation that if the military goes through or
[1:28:10.300 --> 1:28:14.860]  they pay for armed guards place them on board the vessel in high-risk areas well that's going to be
[1:28:14.860 --> 1:28:21.900]  a lot cheaper than the isn't it in the billions now with all the stuff being stolen and the cost
[1:28:21.900 --> 1:28:27.420]  of insurance going up yeah the insurance on the average for a trip like the Sierra Star that was
[1:28:27.420 --> 1:28:31.580]  taken the insurance goes up at least uh on average a hundred to two hundred thousand dollars for
[1:28:31.580 --> 1:28:38.140]  every voyage and of course the consumers are paying for that and uh but in any case yes the last
[1:28:38.140 --> 1:28:44.060]  year alone the reports are between 180 and 300 million that's just what's reported even the
[1:28:44.060 --> 1:28:48.940]  international maritime organization admits that only about half the piracy attacks are reported
[1:28:48.940 --> 1:28:52.300]  because it's just like a fender bender when people don't want to say anything when the insurance
[1:28:52.300 --> 1:28:56.060]  company raised their rates same thing here when they get hit by a pirate attack the companies
[1:28:56.060 --> 1:28:59.500]  don't want to have their insurance rates raised so they pay everybody off and it's hush hush
[1:29:00.220 --> 1:29:06.060]  and so even the IMO says only about half of them are reported but uh between 180 and 300 million
[1:29:06.060 --> 1:29:12.220]  has been taken in ransom money just the year last year alone in Somalia hundreds of millions in
[1:29:12.220 --> 1:29:17.740]  ransom not counting the insurance going up so clearly uh my estimation of a billion is probably
[1:29:17.740 --> 1:29:23.580]  accurate I would say that uh it's well on its way let's put it that way I mean I don't think anybody
[1:29:23.580 --> 1:29:28.300]  really knows because nobody's copying up the all the detail all right captain Sweeney I would like
[1:29:28.300 --> 1:29:34.220]  to have you pop in tomorrow uh in the aftermath of this or any new developments can you do that

[1:34:58.380 --> 1:35:06.140]  the uh san antonio express news mr gonzalez wrote an article in horror and and and so obama's doing
[1:35:06.140 --> 1:35:11.660]  that i've also got constitutional law expert it appears to me yes we can means yes we can do

[1:35:19.100 --> 1:35:26.380]  keith oberman saying obama is worse than bush on secret arrest on secrecy of course they are
[1:35:26.940 --> 1:35:31.020]  no matter when they put a republican in after obama it's going to be even worse
[1:35:31.740 --> 1:35:36.540]  and i'll go for me in a right-wing fascist not liking obama to be in a hard-core commie
[1:35:36.540 --> 1:35:41.180]  the day that republican is sworn in of course i never was a hardcore commie i never was a
[1:35:41.180 --> 1:35:47.260]  fascist i never was a racist i didn't support lennon or mal warheadler i was a constitutionalist

[1:35:52.860 --> 1:35:57.260]  so that clips coming up here in just a few minutes also a huge complete list of other
[1:35:57.260 --> 1:35:59.980]  previous mayak reports in missouri we now have them
[1:36:02.860 --> 1:36:07.020]  the last one was the modern militia movement the other one was modern committees of safety
[1:36:07.020 --> 1:36:14.060]  that was what edwin viera dr viera setting up were just citizens set up committees of safety
[1:36:14.060 --> 1:36:17.900]  to take control of their governments and get good share of selected peacefully and they're
[1:36:17.900 --> 1:36:21.980]  listing them as terrorists when you love to get that full document anarchist movement
[1:36:21.980 --> 1:36:25.500]  national socialist movements they mix in them with these unsavory graves the feds control
[1:36:25.500 --> 1:36:29.500]  the anarchist movement that's a brilliant i mean the federally controlled but not you
[1:36:29.500 --> 1:36:34.620]  if you're a legitimate anarchist please don't twist what i say sovereign citizens movement
[1:36:34.620 --> 1:36:40.860]  listen to this leaderless resistance elicit use of digital music players yes it's terrorism and all
[1:36:40.860 --> 1:36:46.700]  these documents everyone i ever get to download music that's terrorism and it's all how they're
[1:36:46.700 --> 1:36:51.660]  spying on everybody we just got the virginia report 150 something pages and it's all how
[1:36:51.660 --> 1:36:58.700]  they're spying on all of us and boy it's secret they don't want this out by the way kurt can you
[1:36:58.700 --> 1:37:01.820]  read over that document we did it on area stake and we get a article with at least some of the
[1:37:01.820 --> 1:37:06.140]  bullet points it's pretty shocking and it's going to be bigger than the mic report and if we make it
[1:37:06.140 --> 1:37:10.940]  a big story we can start getting it reversed like we did in missouri in virginia i know my
[1:37:10.940 --> 1:37:15.740]  guys are working to the bone here somebody else write an analysis of it we'll link to it
[1:37:18.380 --> 1:37:22.220]  well just we can't do it all and i'm not i know i sound more and more frustrated it's
[1:37:22.220 --> 1:37:27.900]  because it's all coming down on us so that's coming up in a moment uh... that uh...
[1:37:27.900 --> 1:37:33.500]  totally report before we do that i want to bring up one of our great sponsors who joins us every
[1:37:33.500 --> 1:37:37.900]  month or so and that's a color blue because listeners have questions about these and it's
[1:37:37.900 --> 1:37:46.700]  best that the head of the company the designer uh... be part of the show so that we can answer
[1:37:46.700 --> 1:37:51.500]  those questions again people are in the office and they see visitors and they say what is that
[1:37:51.500 --> 1:37:55.900]  where's the water hose coming into this houses thing of your hot water cold water
[1:37:55.900 --> 1:37:59.500]  you know it's got a nice digital computer readout where's the water i know it comes from the air
[1:37:59.500 --> 1:38:08.060]  and they go the air i had electricians here putting in coffee maker stoves a bunch of
[1:38:08.060 --> 1:38:14.460]  stuff in the office uh... break area and i had him over there try to hook a water line to it and i
[1:38:14.460 --> 1:38:19.900]  said no it doesn't need it they said but there's no humidity what do you mean this gets water out
[1:38:19.900 --> 1:38:24.540]  of the air and i said believe me don't try to hook a hose up to it i stopped them because you can't
[1:38:24.540 --> 1:38:29.660]  hook a hose up if you want instead of those got seven filters and use it as a reverse osmosis thing
[1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:35.980]  anyways i'm digressing the point is there's water in the air ladies and gentlemen uh... let's go
[1:38:35.980 --> 1:38:43.020]  ahead and uh... go to tyler palmer of a color blue dot com howler good to have you here with us
[1:38:43.020 --> 1:38:48.780]  it's good to be here alex and uh... it's true that they're spying on us and i'm i'm ready for the
[1:38:48.780 --> 1:38:54.060]  water police that's the next thing uh... i don't know if you've been following the water rationing
[1:38:54.060 --> 1:38:59.660]  that's going on out here in california but yeah they've shut off the uh... three major rivers
[1:38:59.660 --> 1:39:05.420]  claiming that endangered fish some of them are even from the united states will die and so they've
[1:39:05.420 --> 1:39:09.900]  artificially cut the water off and they give in most of the big cities you get toilet water
[1:39:09.900 --> 1:39:15.820]  toilet to tap and all the great chemicals uh... but you know again you should just drink the toilet
[1:39:15.820 --> 1:39:21.660]  water yeah especially if you have you know uh... high blood pressure diabetes or heart disease that
[1:39:21.660 --> 1:39:27.820]  uh... the salt and all that stuff that's in the municipal water the toilet water that that'll just
[1:39:27.820 --> 1:39:33.660]  be wonderful for your your conditions you know uh... but uh... really what i'm worried about is
[1:39:34.220 --> 1:39:41.900]  the the increasing regulation in all of our lives i mean there's not one part of my life that isn't
[1:39:41.900 --> 1:39:47.740]  regulated from the time i get up till the time i go to bed there's some law or something you know
[1:39:47.740 --> 1:39:55.180]  that uh... regulating it and uh... now that they've got this water uh... rationing going on
[1:39:55.180 --> 1:40:01.020]  i was at a conference a few weeks ago and i and i thought that they had wireless flow meters
[1:40:01.580 --> 1:40:06.380]  and i thought what are these going to be for well they're going to be able to monitor how much water
[1:40:06.380 --> 1:40:15.180]  you use per day and uh... and uh... you know uh... issue fines are worse if you go over that so
[1:40:15.180 --> 1:40:22.620]  uh... people and including uh... those that are already off-grid a lot of people don't think about
[1:40:22.620 --> 1:40:30.300]  the water uh... context of being off-grid and self-reliance and it's going to become increasingly
[1:40:30.300 --> 1:40:34.140]  important and it's a critical time in getting the word out i think
[1:40:37.500 --> 1:40:42.300]  there's a comedian that has a show that's carried on some of the air america stations he put a video
[1:40:42.300 --> 1:40:50.300]  up yesterday but it wasn't a funny video he was serious saying he hopes i get raped it's my fault
[1:40:50.300 --> 1:40:56.300]  cops got killed and basically they're taking over our society and if we don't like it so what
[1:40:56.300 --> 1:41:02.300]  and the daily cost has an article by one of their big writers openly saying they can't wait for armed
[1:41:02.300 --> 1:41:08.300]  conflict with the american people they're in control of the state now and and that when they bomb our
[1:41:08.300 --> 1:41:15.580]  homes and kill our families we'll learn who the boss is so that's like when bill clinton had uh... had
[1:41:15.580 --> 1:41:21.580]  uh... had ron silvered the ollywood actor and and and he was being sworn in and some jets flew over
[1:41:21.580 --> 1:41:28.060]  and silver got mad and said how dare them fly those planes over and he's in and clinton said those
[1:41:28.060 --> 1:41:33.180]  are our planes now and so they're literally just going and they're openly announcing they're going
[1:41:33.180 --> 1:41:36.460]  to remote control it's already happening your thermostat they're putting it in right here in
[1:41:36.460 --> 1:41:42.780]  austin they're going to remote control your water there's england's announcing this and then when
[1:41:42.780 --> 1:41:48.380]  you say you don't like it these little dirt bag control freaks funded by the big bankers by soros
[1:41:48.380 --> 1:41:54.860]  get up there and go listen we've got the weapons and soon we'll be crushing you i mean literally
[1:41:54.860 --> 1:42:01.020]  these are what they want to do a Stalinist purge they've always hated america they hate mom and
[1:42:01.020 --> 1:42:07.100]  apple pie they hate the second amendment they hate the free market and these people are dirty
[1:42:07.100 --> 1:42:14.140]  degenerate scum and they do want to tie us down and rape us that's what listen you know i was
[1:42:14.140 --> 1:42:17.500]  thinking about the somali pirates and people raping women we were just talking about it earlier
[1:42:17.500 --> 1:42:21.580]  and i'm gonna hold you over and eat me but i need to say this now i was thinking about this
[1:42:22.860 --> 1:42:28.620]  and i was thinking about you know me a normal somewhat of a normal person i've seen it strange
[1:42:28.620 --> 1:42:32.860]  because i'm old-fashioned you know it's it's red blooded aggressive you know that's bad
[1:42:33.580 --> 1:42:38.540]  you know i'm you know i'm not manipulated you know and you you say what you you think and
[1:42:39.100 --> 1:42:43.420]  well the issue is but but but exactly but the issue is but i'm nothing special that's what's
[1:42:43.420 --> 1:42:48.620]  incredible i'm supposedly bizarre they're open but think about the mindset of wanting to rape
[1:42:48.620 --> 1:42:54.940]  somebody okay to me that is totally alien the whole point is you want the woman into it all
[1:42:54.940 --> 1:42:58.620]  hyped up you know i hate to get into sex and stuff you know i mean you know you you want it to be
[1:42:58.620 --> 1:43:03.740]  fun that's the whole thing to me that's the whole turn on here is it is the more hot the woman is
[1:43:03.740 --> 1:43:08.380]  the more she's into it it would be horrible for me to rape a woman i couldn't imagine that but
[1:43:08.380 --> 1:43:15.660]  there's types of people that love to rape women that's who the globalist are they love the sadistic
[1:43:15.660 --> 1:43:22.940]  taking and so this talk show host gets up and says i want i hope you get raped alex jones he

[2:11:45.900 --> 2:11:50.460]  all of plaintiff's claims in this case would require or risk the disclosure of information
[2:11:50.460 --> 2:11:55.500]  properly protected by the director of national intelligence's assertion of the state's secrets
[2:11:55.500 --> 2:12:00.620]  privilege as we mentioned standard stuff but the real doozy the obama administration seeking to
[2:12:00.620 --> 2:12:06.220]  expand its authority arguing that under something else called sovereign immunity the government
[2:12:06.220 --> 2:12:11.420]  can only be sued if the wiretaps involve willful disclosure page five a willful violation in
[2:12:11.420 --> 2:12:17.020]  section 223c1 refers to the willful disclosure of intelligence information by government agents
[2:12:17.020 --> 2:12:22.700]  and such disclosures by the government are the only actions that create liability against the
[2:12:22.700 --> 2:12:27.100]  united states in other words unless the government publicly releases any information about you that
[2:12:27.100 --> 2:12:33.500]  it has gathered by spying on you you cannot sue it it gets better and by better i mean worse the
[2:12:33.500 --> 2:12:36.780]  bill obama administration wants you to believe that it does not matter if the program is no
[2:12:36.780 --> 2:12:41.980]  longer operative arguing the same standard should apply for the first bush terrorist
[2:12:41.980 --> 2:12:48.460]  surveillance program the tsp page 15 attempting to demonstrate that the tsp was not the content
[2:12:48.460 --> 2:12:53.900]  dragnet plaintiffs alleged or that the nsa has not otherwise engaged in alleged content dragnet
[2:12:53.900 --> 2:12:59.100]  would require the disclosure of highly classified nsa intelligence sources and methods about the
[2:12:59.100 --> 2:13:05.100]  tsp and other nsa activities even confirming or denying already publicly confirmed facts
[2:13:05.100 --> 2:13:09.500]  like the compliance of at&t and other telecom giants right now to the numbers of some of the rooms
[2:13:09.500 --> 2:13:15.020]  in which the information mining machinery was contained that is apparently out of bounds page
[2:13:15.020 --> 2:13:20.460]  16 the dni again has demonstrated the disclosure of whether the nsa has an intelligence relationship
[2:13:20.460 --> 2:13:26.300]  with a private or particular private company would also cause exceptional harm to national
[2:13:26.300 --> 2:13:31.420]  security the obama administration time now to call in our own Howard Feynman senior
[2:13:31.420 --> 2:13:36.300]  washington correspondent for newsweek magazine Howard good evening good evening key what is
[2:13:36.300 --> 2:13:43.180]  the political calculation here and who made it uh well as to the first question uh the obama
[2:13:43.180 --> 2:13:50.620]  administration is balancing two things one is the public politics and the risk of really antagonizing
[2:13:50.620 --> 2:13:56.620]  the first base that gathered beneath and behind and pushed the obama candidacy the one that was
[2:13:56.620 --> 2:14:01.580]  concerned about the war in iraq the one that was concerned about overreaching by military the one
[2:14:01.580 --> 2:14:06.380]  that was over concerned about overreaching by the then president united states those people
[2:14:06.380 --> 2:14:11.340]  are concerned and they're upset and they're disappointed but there's an internal politics
[2:14:11.340 --> 2:14:17.580]  too and it's the politics of the intelligence community it's the politics of the cia uh and
[2:14:17.580 --> 2:14:23.740]  barack obama is an outsider there and he picked as a cia director another outsider leon panetta
[2:14:23.740 --> 2:14:28.700]  and talking to democrats on the hill and talking to experts such as jane mayer the author of the
[2:14:28.700 --> 2:14:34.060]  terrific book about the dark side of the bush administration in terms of torture and surveillance
[2:14:34.060 --> 2:14:40.060]  this is what's going on here obama and his people in the white house do not want to antagonize
[2:14:40.060 --> 2:14:45.340]  the intelligence community because they need them to support them in the war on terror and to get
[2:14:45.340 --> 2:14:49.980]  the president's job done around the world right now that's what's going on as a function of that
[2:14:49.980 --> 2:14:56.300]  is this the bottom line of bureaucracy as as theory that two parties could argue about how
[2:14:56.300 --> 2:15:01.340]  to use a bureaucracy uh where to point the bureaucracy who to target with the bureaucracy
[2:15:01.340 --> 2:15:05.980]  but ultimately the bureaucracy will be defended by both sides with people who would otherwise
[2:15:05.980 --> 2:15:11.900]  happily be at each other's throats yeah i think there's something to that uh in general keith
[2:15:11.900 --> 2:15:15.980]  but more specifically when you're talking about the president's powers of commander in chief
[2:15:16.540 --> 2:15:22.780]  there's so many ironies here they're piled so high they're toppling over barack obama ran against
[2:15:23.740 --> 2:15:30.300]  the irrigation of power by a president who seemed to see no bounds to his power in the war on terror
[2:15:30.940 --> 2:15:35.820]  this administration through its justice department uh and i think what he asked the earlier question
[2:15:35.820 --> 2:15:39.340]  who approved this it's a little hard for me to figure out because a lot of the key players are
[2:15:39.340 --> 2:15:43.900]  just on their way back from the president's trip but i don't think there's any doubt that the nsc
[2:15:43.900 --> 2:15:51.500]  director probably the uh the uh the white house uh council uh greg craig and maybe even the president
[2:15:51.500 --> 2:15:59.340]  himself know everything that's going on here no president wants to uh ced any power that his
[2:15:59.340 --> 2:16:04.620]  that the presidency itself has accumulated even if they were accumulated by people
[2:16:04.620 --> 2:16:10.380]  that the current occupant uh campaigned against so the state secrets assertion and as you say
[2:16:10.380 --> 2:16:14.700]  the sovereign immunity assertion are ones that barack obama and his justice department aren't
[2:16:14.700 --> 2:16:19.740]  going to give up in part because in some of these cases they're now the defendants don't forget that
[2:16:19.740 --> 2:16:23.900]  some of these cases were delayed george bush and his name and the other bush administration
[2:16:24.540 --> 2:16:29.420]  administration officials names were wiped away from the slate and barack obama and his
[2:16:29.420 --> 2:16:34.780]  and his advisors are now the defendants are these signposts along the road towards a decision by
[2:16:34.780 --> 2:16:38.860]  this administration whether or not to prosecute or to at least pursue members of the bush
[2:16:38.860 --> 2:16:44.620]  administration for the various violations and crimes involved in uh in torture in eavesdropping
[2:16:45.900 --> 2:16:49.820]  well as jane mayer told me a little while ago she said look that they've shut down the dark side
[2:16:49.820 --> 2:16:54.540]  okay they're not as far as we know the torturing is over to guantano is going to be closed but
[2:16:54.540 --> 2:16:59.100]  they don't want to shine a flashlight into the dark what was the dark side for the reasons that
[2:16:59.100 --> 2:17:03.100]  i said before and they're going to leave it up to the congress to pursue it now i'm talking to
[2:17:03.100 --> 2:17:08.940]  democrats on the hill this afternoon uh senator lehi the democrat of the uh of the judiciary
[2:17:08.940 --> 2:17:15.180]  committee wants a commission of some kind but he's not going to try to impose one or establish one
[2:17:15.180 --> 2:17:21.260]  one unless republicans support it so far not a single republican has come forth to support
[2:17:21.260 --> 2:17:26.460]  that flashlight shining exercise the obama administration will not do it on its own they're
[2:17:26.460 --> 2:17:30.300]  going to keep their fingers crossed and hope that congress does it but right now congress
[2:17:30.300 --> 2:17:34.380]  isn't going to do it without republicans going along howard fineman of msnbc in newsweek you
[2:17:34.380 --> 2:17:38.860]  said the ironies were piling up uh something something certainly is piling up right now
[2:17:38.860 --> 2:17:45.580]  thank you howard thank you keith okay there you have it ladies and gentlemen we got the
[2:17:45.580 --> 2:17:50.540]  big kim trail interview coming up with roesel and peterson california skywatch with the federal

[2:19:07.180 --> 2:19:12.300]  seen it all over this country i've seen it in europe and this chemtrail here in austin texas
[2:19:12.300 --> 2:19:17.580]  yesterday was gargantuan and i brought everybody out i said do you know what that is and they go

[2:19:29.580 --> 2:19:36.540]  of the most difficult things for human beings to understand because they can see and understand
[2:19:36.540 --> 2:19:42.780]  that the poisoning is actually happening it's right there in the cognitive dissonance or the
[2:19:42.780 --> 2:19:51.820]  defense mechanisms that people have but when they finally get that our government is spraying our
[2:19:51.820 --> 2:19:59.020]  skies with barium ethylene dibromine and other chemicals it really wakes people up stay there

[2:24:15.820 --> 2:24:20.220]  never known about chemtrails telling them about chemtrails today and they were paul watson's
[2:24:20.220 --> 2:24:24.940]  article he wrote last night it's known by steve watson right now and there's just a mass awakening
[2:24:24.940 --> 2:24:29.500]  and the buzz you're getting from the obama deception that you're in again another indicator of how
[2:24:29.500 --> 2:24:34.540]  people are really waking up well just in the last 10 days you you were kind enough to give me some
[2:24:34.540 --> 2:24:40.780]  copies of the obama deception and clearly i'm prejudiced because i'm in the movie but i'll
[2:24:40.780 --> 2:24:47.500]  tell you what every single person every single person that i've given this to has responded
[2:24:47.500 --> 2:24:54.860]  incredibly positively and these are just not you know ron paul patriots i have given this
[2:24:54.860 --> 2:24:59.820]  to mccain supporters i've given this to liberal democrats i've given this to people
[2:24:59.820 --> 2:25:08.620]  or somewhat apathetic and to a person everyone's going this movie is waking me up this thing
[2:25:08.620 --> 2:25:17.740]  is so much bigger than we thought and the quality of this film is excellent so
[2:25:17.740 --> 2:25:24.620]  so alex i just want to say thank you very much for allowing me to be part of this and for all
[2:25:24.620 --> 2:25:31.420]  of you out there and i'm sure that most of you have watched this get copies copy it share it
[2:25:31.420 --> 2:25:38.700]  with your friends the time for the time for questions is over the time to make a choice
[2:25:38.700 --> 2:25:44.060]  are you on the side of freedom are you on the side of republic are you on the side of truth
[2:25:44.060 --> 2:25:50.220]  are you on the side of freedom or do you support the new world order and the lies and the destruction
[2:25:50.220 --> 2:25:56.380]  to our culture to our community and to our families and friends we're making progress
[2:25:57.020 --> 2:26:05.820]  i honestly believe that alex's id has increased 100 percent in the last two months all over
[2:26:05.820 --> 2:26:11.820]  and the reason i say this is because i take my coffee shop poll and i go to the same coffee
[2:26:11.820 --> 2:26:17.980]  shop which is about one one third republicans one third democrats and about one third independence
[2:26:19.260 --> 2:26:28.220]  and a month or so ago people were in there obama obama obama and they were wild about it and now
[2:26:28.220 --> 2:26:35.260]  people you know not only the mccain people and the independence but even some of the obama people
[2:26:35.260 --> 2:26:40.540]  are coming over to me and starting to talk to me about whoa this is a different deal than we thought
[2:26:40.540 --> 2:26:47.980]  this is much much much different than he told us he's going back on his word and then they start
[2:26:47.980 --> 2:26:55.100]  talking to me they initiate the situation so if this little coffee shop is any reflection
[2:26:55.100 --> 2:27:01.980]  of the bigger picture which i know it is we're doing well and the work that alex and you the
[2:27:01.980 --> 2:27:09.500]  people out there are doing to protect our republic to protect truth to live in peace and to do the
[2:27:09.500 --> 2:27:15.260]  right thing this is not a question of left or right in the old in the final barrier is people
[2:27:15.260 --> 2:27:23.340]  still think it's liberal versus democrat republican versus republican versus you know democrat and
[2:27:23.340 --> 2:27:30.700]  and socialist versus conservative it's not it's not a left and right battle it is a battle between
[2:27:30.700 --> 2:27:39.500]  right and wrong it's a battle between the very very few at the very top of the ladder and 99 percent
[2:27:39.500 --> 2:27:46.300]  of us and you know we have truth on our side we have the numbers on our side they clearly right
[2:27:46.300 --> 2:27:54.220]  now have the media they have all this funny money and they have the weapons but truth wins by telling
[2:27:54.220 --> 2:27:59.740]  the truth by looking people in the eyes and we don't have to we don't have to yell at them all we
[2:27:59.740 --> 2:28:05.900]  have to do is share with them the facts do they believe in a sound currency do they believe in
[2:28:05.900 --> 2:28:12.140]  peace do they believe in transparency do they believe in the rule of law and just cite examples
[2:28:12.140 --> 2:28:18.380]  and when you cite the facts with authority you will win people over and the biggest thing right
[2:28:18.380 --> 2:28:27.340]  now is that we have to increase our numbers that is the bottom line this is the battle of on a third

[2:33:46.460 --> 2:33:52.780]  those for george umprey okay george i want to go through some issues you know i want to interview
[2:33:52.780 --> 2:33:56.300]  you you're home for the film and i forgot a few questions i want or you know we went to dinner
[2:33:56.300 --> 2:34:00.460]  and you made some other good points afterwards and i wanted to have in the film uh but uh first off
[2:34:01.180 --> 2:34:05.020]  uh just for the radio audience explain to people we went and looked up the numbers again just to
[2:34:05.020 --> 2:34:11.020]  make sure he's less than 10 percent at six point something black and it doesn't matter if he's black
[2:34:11.020 --> 2:34:16.780]  or chinese or whatever it's that they're lying everything about him is a lie yeah absolutely
[2:34:16.780 --> 2:34:24.700]  and i you don't care i don't care whether he's black or white or or asian or latin all
[2:34:24.700 --> 2:34:30.300]  what i want is a president and elected officials that are honest that are independent and that
[2:34:30.300 --> 2:34:36.940]  follow the constitution period paragraph end of story and what does bother me is dishonesty
[2:34:37.580 --> 2:34:43.580]  and over and over and over and over again and just this last couple days in the washington post
[2:34:43.580 --> 2:34:50.380]  obama is this black man first black president da da da da because he's black we're we're okay
[2:34:51.260 --> 2:35:03.100]  the reality is he's 50 anglo and caucasian his and he's 43.5 percent arab and 6.5
[2:35:03.100 --> 2:35:10.780]  percent african which is great he's a man of mixed color that's fine but he is not a black man
[2:35:10.780 --> 2:35:16.620]  anymore i think that alex has a little bit of native american in him and do we call alex a native
[2:35:16.620 --> 2:35:23.900]  american no he's proud of being having that that native blood in him but we don't talk about that
[2:35:23.900 --> 2:35:29.340]  it is and the reason that they're doing it is to create this screen to create this illusion
[2:35:29.340 --> 2:35:37.980]  to cement at real african americans to obama and to create an untouchable point of view with the
[2:35:37.980 --> 2:35:49.420]  liberal democrats friends this is one more lie very well said uh okay the uh issue of you told
[2:35:49.420 --> 2:35:55.420]  that story when we were at dinner about uh the lady heard you at a coffee shop yeah yeah yeah so
[2:35:55.420 --> 2:35:58.780]  something tell the whole story in detail well i think the most important thing is is that
[2:35:59.340 --> 2:36:04.860]  you know for years we've had the facts on our side you know we've got thousands and thousands of
[2:36:04.860 --> 2:36:10.620]  pages of facts of how we're being ripped off and destroyed as a country but the question is if we're
[2:36:10.620 --> 2:36:15.580]  really going to win if we're really going to restore the republic we have to realize that
[2:36:15.580 --> 2:36:20.700]  it's more than facts and that we have to deal with the emotions and the perceptions of the people
[2:36:21.980 --> 2:36:28.540]  and quite clearly quite clearly the people of this country have been brainwashed and right now
[2:36:28.540 --> 2:36:35.340]  i would assume that about one third of the people are just blindly supporting uh obama about one
[2:36:35.340 --> 2:36:41.740]  third are undecided and about one third were mccain or or or republicans by the way that's the
[2:36:41.740 --> 2:36:48.140]  actual number yeah you had what 60 turn out he got like 57 percent of the vote so we calculate that
[2:36:48.140 --> 2:36:53.340]  out of the nation he's got about a third of the people at the time of election a little bit more
[2:36:53.340 --> 2:36:57.980]  than a third supporting him and now that's eroded so it's less than a fact and it is eroding very
[2:36:57.980 --> 2:37:05.420]  quickly and yet he does have this base of just blind blind obedient people and it was kind of
[2:37:05.420 --> 2:37:09.820]  interesting the other day i was in a cough shop and we were i was talking to a buddy about getner
[2:37:09.820 --> 2:37:17.580]  and about the goldman sacks and about aig and about the transfer of wealth and this lady comes up and
[2:37:17.580 --> 2:37:23.820]  she was not part of the conversation she puts her head and she says i love obama and this is a white
[2:37:23.820 --> 2:37:31.500]  woman very well dressed and we and i go okay great uh do you support the one wreck no do you think
[2:37:31.500 --> 2:37:38.300]  that we should send more troops into afghanistan no well and i said obama is who i'm against that
[2:37:38.300 --> 2:37:44.860]  i said are you did you was obama a candidate for peace she said you bet he was i said are you aware
[2:37:44.860 --> 2:37:51.340]  that he's putting missiles in poland ukraine and georgia and so when she realized that we were
[2:37:51.340 --> 2:37:59.740]  dealing with facts with real issues not emotions she she goes well he's better than bush he's better
[2:37:59.740 --> 2:38:04.700]  than bush and we just sat there and went we're not talking about bush this is not about bush versus
[2:38:04.700 --> 2:38:13.100]  obama we didn't support bush and then she goes well i do all this reading i said well why don't
[2:38:13.100 --> 2:38:18.300]  you look in here and here she says i can't do that i can't do that and then she then her voice
[2:38:18.300 --> 2:38:24.380]  goes way up she says you're trying to tell me what to do and it's because psychologically
[2:38:24.380 --> 2:38:32.940]  she could not accept that what her investment of her time and energy was not in the right place
[2:38:32.940 --> 2:38:40.380]  and so in a very deep emotional place she blocked off and she became very offensive
[2:38:40.380 --> 2:38:48.780]  and went fine and the funny thing was that she walks out and gets in a catalac escalate i mean
[2:38:48.780 --> 2:38:56.220]  this big suv catalac i mean you talk about a limousine liberal and you know these people are
[2:38:56.220 --> 2:39:05.020]  absolutely stealing her money stealing her family's money but she hasn't in her mind that this guy is
[2:39:05.020 --> 2:39:11.820]  the savior and there's many people bush had his same cadre who supported him the same way and it
[2:39:11.820 --> 2:39:18.620]  took a while but very very quickly the truth is getting out there and we're breaking through the
[2:39:18.620 --> 2:39:24.380]  illusion that this guy is a savior and once we've discredited both the left and the right the pattern
[2:39:24.380 --> 2:39:28.940]  of control and the false paradigm is shattered now we can move on to go on after the real problem
[2:39:28.940 --> 2:39:35.660]  the globalist bankers now you know getting back to their psychology she made it about you're trying
[2:39:35.660 --> 2:39:40.380]  to control me you're trying to tell me what to do yeah then it became very childlike like you know
[2:39:40.380 --> 2:39:46.300]  i'm taking my ball and going home yeah when she had come over and she had gotten in george
[2:39:46.300 --> 2:39:51.500]  humphrey's face about this and i've noticed a lot of obama people are saying yeah he is bad but
[2:39:51.500 --> 2:39:55.820]  you know he's better than bush that isn't what it's about it's that he's a puppet it isn't about
[2:39:55.820 --> 2:40:01.020]  him being better than bush and and and being better than bush just means he's better at conning
[2:40:01.020 --> 2:40:06.700]  and suckering people to go along with the agenda next constant lying and sometimes people can't
[2:40:06.700 --> 2:40:11.820]  get lying about lobbyists are lying about wars are lying about bailout money are lying about
[2:40:11.820 --> 2:40:16.380]  saying he's against the bonuses when he wrote the executive order forum i mean yeah clearly this guy
[2:40:16.380 --> 2:40:19.820]  is a congenital liar the worst i've ever seen and he's only getting started i mean this is
[2:40:19.820 --> 2:40:26.140]  unbelievable new level he walks up to the king of saudi arabia he bows completely down i mean
[2:40:26.140 --> 2:40:32.780]  where he's straight i mean to completely prostrate completes supplication or or or or be a minion
[2:40:32.780 --> 2:40:38.140]  behavior the international media points this out the saudi's love it uh... you know the saudi
[2:40:38.140 --> 2:40:42.780]  leadership of the newspaper say how great and then he lies and i have the press reports the
[2:40:42.780 --> 2:40:47.980]  white house is all the president had dropped something and then there's clear video he walks
[2:40:47.980 --> 2:40:53.900]  up he he takes his hand and then completely bows he's not picking anything up a clear video of it
[2:40:53.900 --> 2:40:59.420]  and photos from all different angles then he said oh you know what the prince is so short which
[2:40:59.420 --> 2:41:05.020]  or the king is so short obama had to been down to shake his hand another lie they're right on the
[2:41:05.020 --> 2:41:11.580]  same level he gets his hand and then bows and so i mean what is it the people don't get then he
[2:41:11.580 --> 2:41:16.380]  goes before before that prince philip he's saying oh i met with world leader he says oh and prince
[2:41:16.380 --> 2:41:19.660]  philip laughs and says oh you can tell the difference and starts laughing and then goes
[2:41:20.620 --> 2:41:27.180]  and obama says uh... yes sir and turns around cnn put up fake subtitles where they're saying oh
[2:41:27.180 --> 2:41:31.500]  wonderful day very successful when you can clearly hear and the russian news got this right and so
[2:41:31.500 --> 2:41:37.660]  did british he's clearly saying to him uh... that uh... you know making fun of him and saying turn
[2:41:37.660 --> 2:41:43.100]  around and obama says absolutely yes uh... so so speak to that i mean all the other world leaders
[2:41:43.100 --> 2:41:49.420]  aren't bowing to the royalty this is about humiliating america this is about humiliating us this is
[2:41:49.420 --> 2:41:55.100]  about we're bowing we're slaves our president is like a tinker toy that the royals of the planet
[2:41:55.100 --> 2:42:01.660]  have bought an auction and once again this goes back to that wonderful document called the constitution
[2:42:01.660 --> 2:42:08.940]  of the united states and our founding fathers made it very clear that we were not supposed to have
[2:42:08.940 --> 2:42:15.580]  royalty or aristocracy within our government they were breaking away from that old paradigm
[2:42:16.140 --> 2:42:22.380]  they made it very clear that you're not supposed to have aristocracy within our government and that
[2:42:22.380 --> 2:42:30.780]  also means that our our leaders are not supposed to be bowing to the prince philip or the prince of
[2:42:30.780 --> 2:42:39.260]  saudi arabia or whatever show them courteous respect just like you do with any other leader but we
[2:42:39.260 --> 2:42:46.140]  don't bow to a prince from saudi arabia that was created a hundred years ago or to a false king
[2:42:46.140 --> 2:42:53.820]  from england this is just insanity and the reality is the reality is is that the royal
[2:42:53.820 --> 2:43:03.020]  family of england is one of the top members or players within the illuminati and friends
[2:43:03.740 --> 2:43:10.700]  all you have to do is look at how obama is acting with those people deferring giving away
[2:43:11.500 --> 2:43:18.460]  we're he's the president united states he is not the prince of england well expanding on that
[2:43:19.020 --> 2:43:23.180]  it's a room full of world leaders none of them are bowing obama walks up takes his hand
[2:43:23.180 --> 2:43:28.540]  and completely bows this is the most disgusting thing i've ever seen in my life this is about
[2:43:28.540 --> 2:43:34.460]  our humiliation then he lies about the slaves uh just like he says i'm not for a carbon tax and
[2:43:34.460 --> 2:43:37.500]  he's for it and he says i'm not for putting satellite tracker boxes in your car but they're
[2:43:37.500 --> 2:43:41.260]  for it yeah or i'm not going to hire lobbyists but they're for it let's go ahead and this has
[2:43:41.260 --> 2:43:45.260]  this is from spanish tv in spain uh this has spanish behind it but for those watching
[2:43:45.260 --> 2:43:49.100]  present planet dot tv you can see it if not you're listening on the radio we have the youtube
[2:43:49.100 --> 2:43:54.220]  video up on info wars dot com then the next clip i believe we have that too is him groveling to prince
[2:43:54.220 --> 2:44:21.340]  phillip in the queen of england here it is
[2:44:21.340 --> 2:44:30.140]  hey i i just want to say is that years ago when i was a city councilman uh prince charles came to
[2:44:30.140 --> 2:44:35.580]  austin texas and i had the pleasure of meeting him we had a nice talk but i never bothered that son
[2:44:35.580 --> 2:44:39.740]  of a gun you know i liked him go ahead and call him a son of a bitch well no he's just you know he
[2:44:39.740 --> 2:44:45.820]  likes him on a personal level he was very charming and we had a nice talk about horses
[2:44:45.820 --> 2:44:50.620]  but i wasn't gonna bow to some guy like that i mean i like him well that's what albert spear
[2:44:50.620 --> 2:44:55.420]  that's what albert spear and you know the head of the you know the ministry of the interior
[2:44:55.420 --> 2:44:59.740]  for germany said and he got off at nirnberg but he said when you're standing next to the devil
[2:44:59.740 --> 2:45:03.900]  and he's so charming he's got his arm around it you don't know it's the devil absolutely and lbj
[2:45:03.900 --> 2:45:09.100]  was probably one of the most charming people in the whole world now is lbj a good guy well
[2:45:09.100 --> 2:45:15.580]  that's up to you but you know just because somebody is charming like barack obama it doesn't mean
[2:45:15.580 --> 2:45:19.820]  that they're telling you the truth well what humiliation for our country now here is the video
[2:45:19.820 --> 2:45:26.700]  in audio where but the point is seeing input fake subtitles in here okay they put in the fake
[2:45:26.700 --> 2:45:31.820]  subtitles of oh then it's going very well it's very excellent and then meanwhile he really said
[2:45:31.820 --> 2:45:52.300]  oh you can tell the difference then laughs at him and then goes yeah okay now here it is
[2:45:52.300 --> 2:46:02.700]  there's philip suggested with a laugh it maybe didn't let's play the words as done to tell them apart
[2:46:02.700 --> 2:46:13.100]  so
[2:46:21.660 --> 2:46:27.900]  prince philip is notorious for his inappropriate jokes sometimes which often offend minorities
[2:46:27.900 --> 2:46:34.540]  and foreigners for example on a visit to beijing some years ago he described it as a ghastly town
[2:46:34.540 --> 2:46:39.660]  and told british students living in the city of they stayed much longer they would become
[2:46:39.660 --> 2:47:01.260]  flitty eyed notice that cnn chooses to put up fake subtitles literally fake subtitles on cnn just
[2:47:01.260 --> 2:47:10.060]  now this is sick hey a picture is worth a thousand words all you have to do is watch it
[2:47:10.700 --> 2:47:14.940]  but then he loved but then obama lies and says he doesn't bow to the king of saudi arabia does he
[2:47:14.940 --> 2:47:21.900]  bow of course he does just look at the pictures it's really funny i mean at one level i mean
[2:47:21.900 --> 2:47:28.780]  it's like a theater bow where you go it's absolutely ridiculous that the president of the united states
[2:47:28.780 --> 2:47:34.780]  is bowing to this false prince in saudi arabia and this false king and queen in england i mean
[2:47:34.780 --> 2:47:46.300]  it's just wild we're not worthy we're not worthy man talk about the creation of feudalism again
[2:47:46.300 --> 2:47:50.220]  but you know what we're not going to do it we're not going to go back that way all right let's
[2:47:50.220 --> 2:47:56.220]  take some ringa dingy so steve in texas you're on the air welcome steve yeah good afternoon
[2:47:56.220 --> 2:48:01.500]  eilson jones uh no george and god bless both of you i appreciate the stand that you've taken um
[2:48:01.500 --> 2:48:06.140]  i just wanted to give you a heads up uh something i heard on glenn beck show this morning but before
[2:48:06.140 --> 2:48:11.420]  that out i want to let you know personal testimony i got the obama deception and i let a neighbor of
[2:48:11.420 --> 2:48:17.660]  mine bow it this guy's black real good guy the young guy with a wife and five kids let him watch
[2:48:17.660 --> 2:48:23.260]  it before i asked him did you vote in the last election well no well if you had who do you voted
[2:48:23.260 --> 2:48:28.620]  for well the guy that's in now so i gave him a bunch of information let him watch it he came back to
[2:48:28.620 --> 2:48:34.940]  me after watching it twice said he passed it on to his mother who was an ardent obama supporter as
[2:48:34.940 --> 2:48:40.300]  well as the rest of the family he is a bunch of people so now she's talking to her sister his
[2:48:40.300 --> 2:48:46.380]  aunt and a bunch of other people and so he's going to go and get the obama he said man i gotta get
[2:48:46.380 --> 2:48:51.660]  copies of this i gave you a website somewhere to go and i mean that's what we've got to do
[2:48:51.660 --> 2:48:56.220]  because just like you're saying when people see this if they have any kind of an open mind and
[2:48:56.220 --> 2:49:00.940]  they're using the brain god gave them and they and he said this all you gotta do is look at what's
[2:49:00.940 --> 2:49:05.180]  on the news all they're saying is what's on the news and his aunt had said oh that's just the
[2:49:05.180 --> 2:49:10.060]  republicans putting that out you know and she hadn't even seen it so you know but that's what
[2:49:10.060 --> 2:49:16.700]  we gotta do it'll go viral of each one of us does our part and i wonder what bottom line bottom line
[2:49:16.700 --> 2:49:21.420]  they want to betray folks that supported obama when they're done they're gonna blame everything on
[2:49:21.420 --> 2:49:25.340]  him and the new order keeps moving right we're trying to help folks that have been suckered by
[2:49:25.340 --> 2:49:31.500]  this we're all in this together and uh yeah all the emails i get that are against me it's it's all
[2:49:31.500 --> 2:49:36.300]  you're just a republican right and they don't understand no but but uh tell me what uh mr

[2:55:58.540 --> 2:56:05.100]  start of the movie you have the not one but you have two different very very articulate black
[2:56:05.100 --> 2:56:10.700]  rappers who are speaking their mind who are speaking their truth and that is incredibly
[2:56:10.700 --> 2:56:17.020]  important you have that jesse ventura you have willie nelson you have salente i mean you have
[2:56:17.020 --> 2:56:22.700]  folks on there who are articulate they have got they've got a sense of humor they have clarity
[2:56:22.700 --> 2:56:27.500]  and they have vision and they're speaking to the people they're not they're not speaking down to
[2:56:27.500 --> 2:56:32.620]  people they're speaking about no it's not like in a coffee table discussion yeah and it's not even
[2:56:32.620 --> 2:56:37.020]  really attacking obama it's saying doesn't even matter he's not about obama obama is a puppet
[2:56:37.020 --> 2:56:42.060]  and it's just not about bush but that's what it's about is showing you that it's a fake fight
[2:56:42.060 --> 2:56:45.260]  let's talk to joe in new mexico you're on the air with george hamford go ahead joe
[2:56:47.500 --> 2:56:53.020]  hey joe george i really agree with george on that obama deception assessment that's great and
[2:56:53.020 --> 2:56:59.420]  real quick alex man you are doing uh good work and i know it's not about you it's obvious when
[2:56:59.420 --> 2:57:04.220]  you talk to people even some of your interesting calls that come in you're always polite you're
[2:57:04.220 --> 2:57:09.340]  genuine and you're always focused on the issues well sir i mean i'm living with i'm living with
[2:57:09.340 --> 2:57:13.500]  death threats every day and stuff that i don't even get into on air so i mean that makes it real
[2:57:13.500 --> 2:57:17.740]  this isn't about ego i mean i'll be honest when i first got into this like 14 years ago i didn't
[2:57:17.740 --> 2:57:22.060]  like tyranny i wanted to keep a second amendment but it's fun to be known and fun to get up and
[2:57:22.060 --> 2:57:27.180]  you know that you're supposed to be that's normal but now now it's just pure passion for liberty
[2:57:27.180 --> 2:57:33.420]  and freedom and i and i it's not about me uh more than ego now though it's also about defeating
[2:57:33.420 --> 2:57:39.900]  enemies people that have tried to stop me it's more than just a competitiveness now uh in a way
[2:57:39.900 --> 2:57:43.580]  it's like a prison but at the same time it's empowering and what's yin yang george you know
[2:57:43.580 --> 2:57:47.340]  what i'm talking about well heck yeah i mean i remember when i first became aware of this about
[2:57:47.340 --> 2:57:54.540]  20 years ago my jaw just dropped and i i realized cow if i go into this i'll never be a ui i won't
[2:57:54.540 --> 2:58:01.580]  be a u.s congressman right now that i'll alienate a lot of my friends and then as i made the decision
[2:58:01.580 --> 2:58:07.820]  to tell the truth then i start finding all these new friends and in my life became better and more
[2:58:07.820 --> 2:58:14.540]  vibrant and aware now clearly there are many nights that i wake up and i'm in a sweat but i'll tell you
[2:58:14.540 --> 2:58:20.460]  what i wouldn't change a thing yeah no it's it's it's very but but then it's real when you're
[2:58:20.460 --> 2:58:24.620]  holding your children you're looking at the beautiful stars and trees when you're not risking
[2:58:24.620 --> 2:58:29.900]  your life and not challenging evil that we're meant to do that in this in this life you're not
[2:58:29.900 --> 2:58:35.660]  going to the next level and you know when you face your fear and go in through beyond past the fear
[2:58:35.660 --> 2:58:39.820]  then you actually go to the next level and that's what i want people to experience we'll be right

[3:02:27.100 --> 3:02:31.820]  house dot gov and they said yeah we're we're looking at doing this and then you read the
[3:02:31.820 --> 3:02:35.980]  documents oh we've been doing it for years testing but now we're going to make it public
[3:02:35.980 --> 3:02:42.940]  and they said worldwide for your safety it's just unbelievable but i really want to thank
[3:02:42.940 --> 3:02:47.260]  the the caller here the fact that you're going into police stations the fact that you have
[3:02:47.260 --> 3:02:52.140]  the courage to speak to these people and give them this information and let's say that you
[3:02:52.140 --> 3:02:57.980]  put out ten if only one of them watches it and gets the message you've done your work
[3:02:57.980 --> 3:03:04.540]  and i want to say this to everybody listening just today go out and talk to somebody new
[3:03:04.540 --> 3:03:09.660]  about the new world order about chemtrails about the bailout and about the obama deception
[3:03:09.660 --> 3:03:13.900]  but thank you for the call sir god bless you and be sure and writing notes about where it was if
[3:03:13.900 --> 3:03:17.100]  you want to be sourced don't just send me a letter saying you have the rights to use it
[3:03:17.100 --> 3:03:20.620]  you need to let me know do you want to be sourced in the film do you want to be thanked
[3:03:20.620 --> 3:03:24.700]  do you want to be in the credits or do you not want it there be very careful about that because
[3:03:24.700 --> 3:03:28.620]  i know we're going to get hundreds of tapes in and i'm really excited about this chemtrail film
[3:03:28.620 --> 3:03:35.180]  uh it's it's going to be awesome because again people can look up in his eyes wide shut and
[3:03:35.180 --> 3:03:41.020]  everybody that i get to look up they go yeah i'm kind of aware of it but most people don't look
[3:03:41.020 --> 3:03:46.220]  up but when they do they realize something's wrong exactly real fast mathis in texas mathis go ahead
[3:03:47.020 --> 3:03:51.820]  yeah um first i was trying to get to your screener um some of your information about what other
[3:03:51.820 --> 3:03:56.780]  networks are available i travel all through through texas throughout the day um and i can only hear
[3:03:56.780 --> 3:04:00.540]  you when i'm in austin and and when we're done i'm wondering if you can send me over let me know
[3:04:00.540 --> 3:04:05.820]  where else i might be able to be clear we don't have a call screener oh well the the gentleman
[3:04:05.820 --> 3:04:11.820]  that was asking me questions when i first called well we don't we don't screen the calls you mean
[3:04:11.820 --> 3:04:16.300]  well i called in somebody asked me my name oh yeah well that's not a call screener just so you
[3:04:16.300 --> 3:04:20.140]  know i mean you can use whatever name you'd like i mean we didn't ask you what you wanted to talk
[3:04:20.140 --> 3:04:24.620]  about did you did we oh no not at all not at all he just just a little there's a big internet
[3:04:24.620 --> 3:04:30.060]  hoax claiming we do right but but and it's all fake callers they claim uh but uh you know for
[3:04:30.060 --> 3:04:34.620]  i just want to get that straight we don't screen your phone calls unless i'm saying oh i want to
[3:04:34.620 --> 3:04:41.100]  hear from a police officer uh yeah um well by network sir i'm only on about 65 radio stations
[3:04:41.100 --> 3:04:46.780]  that sounds like a lot it's not uh i'm on the genesis network the shortwave satellite and internet
[3:04:46.780 --> 3:04:54.300]  and we only have three affiliates in texas uh so i'm i'm glad you're trying to look for how to find
[3:04:54.300 --> 3:04:58.300]  us just get an ipod download the free podcast every day at info wars dot com george thanks for
[3:04:58.300 --> 3:05:03.580]  coming in thanks buddy you bet we'll be right back stay with us hi this is alex jones did you know
[3:05:03.580 --> 3:05:08.140]  that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic
[3:05:08.140 --> 3:05:12.540]  circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[3:05:12.540 --> 3:05:17.100]  silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and
[3:05:17.100 --> 3:05:22.060]  it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together
[3:05:22.060 --> 3:05:28.460]  the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[3:05:28.460 --> 3:05:33.340]  supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[3:05:33.340 --> 3:05:38.860]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis
[3:05:38.860 --> 3:05:45.100]  garden so visit them today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give
[3:05:45.100 --> 3:05:57.020]  them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are
[3:05:57.020 --> 3:06:02.940]  the ultimate barter item this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com in the new world
[3:06:02.940 --> 3:06:09.340]  orders war against humanity barack obama is the tip of the spear we've got to have a civilian
[3:06:09.340 --> 3:06:16.140]  national security force that's just as powerful just as strong just as well funded the obama
[3:06:16.140 --> 3:06:21.420]  deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the best interest of the american
[3:06:21.420 --> 3:06:27.740]  people while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election if you have a demagogue
[3:06:27.740 --> 3:06:33.500]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of
[3:06:33.500 --> 3:06:39.900]  extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about left or right it's
[3:06:39.900 --> 3:06:47.020]  about a one-world government this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told and his

[3:07:01.660 --> 3:07:06.380]  more than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you have
[3:07:06.380 --> 3:07:10.940]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water that's
[3:07:10.940 --> 3:07:15.740]  because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin
[3:07:15.740 --> 3:07:21.580]  the kdf dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine
[3:07:21.580 --> 3:07:28.300]  lead mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria mold algae and fungus the kdf dual
[3:07:28.300 --> 3:07:34.300]  media shower filter typically lasts 10 000 gallons or one year whichever comes first hospitals restaurants
[3:07:34.300 --> 3:07:39.260]  and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine iron heavy metals and bacteria

[3:08:29.580 --> 3:08:46.300]  okay for those that are just now joining us you have ice condensation clouds that normally form
[3:08:46.300 --> 3:08:53.340]  above 20 000 feet when jet aircraft go through the right type of cloud formations it just forms
[3:08:53.340 --> 3:09:01.020]  clouds ice crystals but starting in the mid 90s suddenly we notice clouds at only a few
[3:09:01.020 --> 3:09:07.420]  thousand feet trails that would expand and turn into cloud banks and then planes right next to
[3:09:07.420 --> 3:09:15.660]  them wouldn't leave it and now people have done the deep research you know we have active climate
[3:09:15.660 --> 3:09:21.820]  stabilization particle physics based approaches to prevention of climate change a Nobel prize was
[3:09:21.820 --> 3:09:26.940]  one a decade ago plus in this this is the national academy of engineering symposium
[3:09:26.940 --> 3:09:33.100]  washington dc april 18 2002 the council on foreign relations that openly is calling for
[3:09:33.100 --> 3:09:40.380]  world government and globalism has come out and admitted in a whole bunch of papers they've put
[3:09:40.380 --> 3:09:46.460]  out council on foreign relations geoengineering workshop on unilateral planetary scale geoengineering
[3:09:46.460 --> 3:09:53.100]  or terraforming there is that article we're going to put all these up on screen as we go through
[3:09:53.100 --> 3:09:58.780]  the show today with our guests and then albroca obama's head science advisor in his first
[3:09:58.780 --> 3:10:03.180]  interviews is being approved a month ago tells the associated press london guardian and others
[3:10:03.180 --> 3:10:07.260]  in a press conference i just want you to know we may have to start geoengineering with aircraft
[3:10:07.260 --> 3:10:17.100]  spraying the skies to protect us from global warming now something is going on and a lot
[3:10:17.100 --> 3:10:21.340]  of newscasters have done studies they've had scientists look at it there's more than one
[3:10:21.340 --> 3:10:26.140]  program going on there's low altitude spring high altitude you'll see articles in california
[3:10:26.140 --> 3:10:31.420]  where they spray pesticides on the town for a moth or austin texas or they spray bacteria on every
[3:10:31.420 --> 3:10:37.580]  town and city in oklahoma with a bacteria that kills mammals and causes spontaneous abortions
[3:10:37.580 --> 3:10:42.300]  and then they just calmly announce you know so so so there's all this stuff going on
[3:10:43.980 --> 3:10:48.460]  and if you go to california skywatch.com it's one of the best most well-researched interview
[3:10:48.460 --> 3:10:54.700]  scientists urologists you know list goes on and on rosalyn peterson we're going to have her on we've
[3:10:54.700 --> 3:10:58.700]  had her on many times before but i want to have her on next week again an hour today is not enough
[3:10:58.700 --> 3:11:03.740]  rosalyn peterson is a california president and co-founder of the agriculture defense
[3:11:03.740 --> 3:11:08.460]  coalition the adc was founded 2006 to protect agriculture crop production from uncontrolled
[3:11:08.460 --> 3:11:11.900]  experimental weather modification programs atmospheric heating and testing programs
[3:11:11.900 --> 3:11:15.900]  and oceanic and atmospheric experimental geoengineering programs and the issue is
[3:11:15.900 --> 3:11:20.300]  once you don't call it chemtrails and you actually go look and use their terms it's all
[3:11:20.300 --> 3:11:25.420]  over every major university out there literally they're spraying everywhere they admit it and
[3:11:25.420 --> 3:11:31.900]  uh nasa admits they're doing it and the cfr is announcing it the presidents people are announcing
[3:11:31.900 --> 3:11:36.140]  it but then you tell the public and they say it doesn't exist like here's the council and
[3:11:36.140 --> 3:11:41.740]  fire relations international institutions and global governance program world order 21st century
[3:11:42.940 --> 3:11:48.300]  may first 2008 where they call for global government i have here today the international
[3:11:48.300 --> 3:11:52.380]  bank of settlements documents from 2006 where they said they were engineering the collapse
[3:11:52.380 --> 3:11:57.900]  for 2009 to bring in the new world order i mean that's how this is piling up where it's just
[3:11:57.900 --> 3:12:01.660]  everywhere like where is that i had that in my stack and then erin ran off with it needs now
[3:12:01.660 --> 3:12:06.220]  on an airplane anyways let's go ahead and go to rosalyn peterson rosalyn start at the beginning
[3:12:06.220 --> 3:12:11.500]  what we know the documented stuff that's that's on record of what's happening good to have you
[3:12:11.500 --> 3:12:19.020]  here with us well thank you very much for having me on your show today um there's any number of
[3:12:19.020 --> 3:12:23.820]  programs uh nasa and the u.s. air force are conducting atmospheric heating and testing
[3:12:23.820 --> 3:12:29.980]  programs and they're using the space shuttle and rockets to send up canisters um with toxic
[3:12:29.980 --> 3:12:37.660]  chemicals like barium and trimethyl aluminum strontium lithium um sulfur hexachloride ff6
[3:12:37.660 --> 3:12:44.860]  and other chemicals and then they super heat these canisters and conduct atmospheric and ionic
[3:12:44.860 --> 3:12:51.340]  ionic spirit um heating and testing programs then you've got weather modification programs
[3:12:51.340 --> 3:12:57.580]  ongoing across the united states there's more than 60 listed by the u.s. department of commerce
[3:12:57.580 --> 3:13:03.980]  and right now our weather can be modified without our consent they can use any chemicals and any
[3:13:03.980 --> 3:13:11.340]  experiments that they want a private individual a corporation a state a city a county the military
[3:13:11.340 --> 3:13:17.260]  federal government anyone can modify your weather at any time they don't have to have any there is
[3:13:17.260 --> 3:13:24.060]  no public oversight there is no prior public notification and except in a few small counties
[3:13:24.060 --> 3:13:31.820]  in some states and these programs are currently on grow ongoing and growing exponentially and
[3:13:32.620 --> 3:13:40.060]  now senator k bailey hutcheson of texas has just introduced um u.s. senate bill 601 to continue to
[3:13:40.060 --> 3:13:47.500]  allow anyone and everyone to mitigate and modify the weather um and they don't set up any uh government
[3:13:47.500 --> 3:13:54.140]  oversight no prior public notification there's nothing in this bill then you add um these
[3:13:54.140 --> 3:14:02.780]  persistent jet contrails um that turn into white haze a serious cloud man-made cloud that nasa
[3:14:02.780 --> 3:14:09.020]  studies show exacerbate global warming they show that they change our climate and they're showing
[3:14:09.020 --> 3:14:13.740]  that they negatively impact our natural resource that was the point i was going to make i've had
[3:14:13.740 --> 3:14:18.780]  top climatologist on i remember like four years ago and seven years ago nasa showed their own
[3:14:18.780 --> 3:14:23.820]  satellite photos of the whole u.s. and europe covered with the contrails which are really
[3:14:23.820 --> 3:14:29.100]  chemtrails is they didn't do this until this program started this huge black off project
[3:14:29.100 --> 3:14:34.060]  that's got to be in the hundreds of billions now and they admitted that these clouds were going to
[3:14:34.060 --> 3:14:40.140]  heat the earth so they're i think they're trying to really screw stuff up so they can panic people
[3:14:40.140 --> 3:14:45.340]  into accepting the global warming tax because now they come out and have you know in kids textbooks
[3:14:45.340 --> 3:14:51.580]  as you mentioned as folks have covered oh uh we're trying to stop the global warming and now the
[3:14:51.580 --> 3:14:57.020]  president's people are saying that when the science shows that this stuff causes u v to go through
[3:14:57.020 --> 3:15:02.540]  the clouds and then basically trap the heat under them that it's clear skies like the desert at night
[3:15:02.540 --> 3:15:11.980]  that let the heat go off world yes that's correct and um contrails too are made up of water vapor
[3:15:11.980 --> 3:15:17.660]  and of course debt fuel emissions and other toxic but now they're saying that this water vapor has a
[3:15:17.660 --> 3:15:23.740]  greenhouse gas and they say it exacerbates global warming and yet in no legislation that i can find
[3:15:23.740 --> 3:15:29.900]  anywhere at any level state or federal do they talk about remedying the problem or solving it
[3:15:29.900 --> 3:15:35.180]  they're starting now to talk about well we can put up more particulars into the atmosphere
[3:15:35.180 --> 3:15:40.140]  and space mirrors there's all kinds of fuel engineering projects in order to cool us down
[3:15:40.140 --> 3:15:46.140]  but they don't realize that the programs we have ongoing are what are exacerbating um this problem
[3:15:48.620 --> 3:15:52.540]  well you're absolutely right and i mean then there's just the whole issue of how this illustrates
[3:15:52.540 --> 3:15:56.700]  for people what the shadow government which they now admits in total control under the national
[3:15:56.700 --> 3:16:02.620]  security council's doing and now the cfr says we need global treaties for global let me give
[3:16:02.620 --> 3:16:12.460]  their exact quote here um for unilateral that means complete planetary scale geoengineering so
[3:16:15.100 --> 3:16:20.380]  and then you have the issue of them denying any of this is going on as the public says what in the
[3:16:20.380 --> 3:16:27.980]  world is going on here uh you know 15 years ago these these trails disappeared now they never leave
[3:16:27.980 --> 3:16:34.780]  they turn into whole cloud banks and then so we speak to that specifically how all the scientific
[3:16:34.780 --> 3:16:38.860]  data admits they're doing this but then when we complain they say we don't know what you're talking
[3:16:38.860 --> 3:16:46.540]  about well part of it is um uh let me go through three things here first of all the first time
[3:16:46.540 --> 3:16:52.620]  the in northern california that we saw contrails start to persist what it looks like from the earliest
[3:16:52.620 --> 3:17:00.300]  photographs and records we have was around 1989 and uh from that time forward uh beginning in
[3:17:00.300 --> 3:17:07.100]  the late 1980s scientists began to talk about geoengineering the word was kind of hidden from
[3:17:07.100 --> 3:17:14.140]  view and it started to spring up at universities and special courses and things but it wasn't
[3:17:14.140 --> 3:17:20.700]  talked about but so many began to filter into a whole group of scientists who started to work on
[3:17:20.700 --> 3:17:27.500]  as part of their curriculum at um another word Stanford University and other areas University
[3:17:27.500 --> 3:17:34.940]  of Irvine um and some government agencies began to work on these type of programs this geoengineering
[3:17:34.940 --> 3:17:40.860]  type program let me stop you uh it was interviewing Ben Livingston the father of weather weapons
[3:17:40.860 --> 3:17:44.460]  you know confirmed it was declassified we interviewed him first it was on foxy and
[3:17:44.460 --> 3:17:51.340]  in you name it it was stanford research institute from 1960 to 67 that did the study with him the
[3:17:51.340 --> 3:17:57.820]  meteorologist and certified weather weapons creation of hurricanes typhoons floods uh
[3:17:57.820 --> 3:18:03.500]  things like that and that they they had certified they could control the weather by 1967 and you
[3:18:03.500 --> 3:18:08.460]  just mentioned this stuff started as far as we can tell is in california with stanford
[3:18:08.460 --> 3:18:16.380]  it could be and so what but what's happened since that time we've been engaged since the 40s
[3:18:16.380 --> 3:18:21.660]  in hurricane modification weather modification lots of programs yes that most of the public is
[3:18:21.660 --> 3:18:28.940]  unaware and we were modifying the weather in vietnam um so that brought us the n-mod treaty
[3:18:28.940 --> 3:18:33.820]  which was signed by the u.s congress to stop weather modification for warfare purposes
[3:18:33.820 --> 3:18:41.260]  but now the military is talking about using it as a force multiplier in order to um in other words
[3:18:41.260 --> 3:18:48.620]  control anyone they want by controlling the weather that they have so this is on the scale
[3:18:48.620 --> 3:18:54.300]  of many many documents uh from the air force and the other services talking about weather
[3:18:54.300 --> 3:19:02.300]  modification as a force multiplier and then you add to this um in 2006 november uh there was
[3:19:02.300 --> 3:19:08.620]  a there was all of these uh scientists geoengineering scientists from all of the world went to napa
[3:19:08.620 --> 3:19:15.820]  aims for one week of meetings uh with regard to geoengineering programs and ken caldera
[3:19:15.820 --> 3:19:21.660]  professor ken caldera stanford university uh said well we'll have an open public forum
[3:19:21.660 --> 3:19:27.420]  we'll invite the press to come and as luck would have it i knew someone who was allowed to go to
[3:19:27.420 --> 3:19:35.500]  this and so i went and all of these uh professors uh gregory benford from uc irvine ken called the
[3:19:35.500 --> 3:19:41.500]  era um uh in other words a great number of them were all there and were speaking and that meeting
[3:19:41.500 --> 3:19:46.460]  became highly fascinating stay there let's hear about this maybe we'll get back and now
[3:19:47.100 --> 3:19:51.100]  they're announcing it all over the news oh we're going to control the weather we're going to spray
[3:19:51.100 --> 3:19:56.860]  the skies with sunscreen to protect you and that's what they're doing the particuli the nuclei to
[3:19:56.860 --> 3:20:02.700]  create these clouds but that's only one part of it and the chemicals they're using are toxic spring
[3:20:02.700 --> 3:20:08.780]  is here growing season the economy is not getting any better in fact it's getting worse think about

[3:23:04.700 --> 3:23:09.340]  of food but alex and i've decided that there's some of you that we really don't want to have food
[3:23:09.340 --> 3:23:14.220]  if you're a politician who voted for the bailout don't call e-foods direct if you agree with one
[3:23:14.220 --> 3:23:20.140]  guy screaming about global warming instead of 650 climatologists who know the earth is cooling
[3:23:20.140 --> 3:23:24.860]  don't call e-foods direct if you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people don't
[3:23:24.860 --> 3:23:29.260]  get food if you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending yourself
[3:23:29.260 --> 3:23:34.300]  and preventing the crime don't call e-foods direct if you believe the official report on 9 11
[3:23:34.300 --> 3:23:38.940]  you won't need food if you think the warnings on the alex joneshow are foolish don't call
[3:23:38.940 --> 3:23:46.300]  e-foods direct for the rest of you go to e-foods direct dot com or call 800 409 5633 you can't
[3:23:46.300 --> 3:23:51.180]  possibly know or control what government corporate america or others will do but you can control
[3:23:51.180 --> 3:24:07.660]  what you do complete your supply now e-foods direct dot com 800 409 5633 800 409 5633
[3:24:11.260 --> 3:24:17.980]  this is all psychology and they would have come out in the late 80s 90s when they started this and
[3:24:17.980 --> 3:24:22.700]  said we're going to terraform the planet and change the atmosphere we're government we're god
[3:24:23.260 --> 3:24:28.540]  people would have sued environmentalists what are you doing if they use weather weapons as weapons
[3:24:28.540 --> 3:24:33.340]  against our farmers or other countries as economic control people would know to blame them
[3:24:33.340 --> 3:24:37.660]  so that's why the government says there's no weather modification none of this exist is
[3:24:37.660 --> 3:24:42.540]  hundreds of universities thousands worldwide work on it and fleets of aircraft are spraying
[3:24:42.540 --> 3:24:47.740]  and so now after decades of us fighting and saying what's going on you know we're talking
[3:24:47.740 --> 3:24:53.980]  1415 years that i've known of people speaking about this it has that kook connotation so even
[3:24:53.980 --> 3:25:00.540]  when the government announces that people go oh no couldn't be happening just like the you know
[3:25:00.540 --> 3:25:05.900]  their documents said 20 years ago world government global carbon tax they said we were cooks didn't
[3:25:05.900 --> 3:25:10.380]  exist now when they announced it as they've done the last month people go oh well it still doesn't
[3:25:10.380 --> 3:25:15.740]  exist and and newspapers attack me saying it doesn't exist so that's the amazing psychology
[3:25:15.740 --> 3:25:21.900]  and talking about amazing rosalind peterson is probably the top overall you know uh person
[3:25:21.900 --> 3:25:26.940]  who is studying all the basic data and really integrating it uh in together uh rosalind please
[3:25:26.940 --> 3:25:32.060]  continue with well the psychology of them denying all this and then the meetings you've gone to go
[3:25:32.060 --> 3:25:40.620]  ahead well this meeting at stanford university um in november 2006 um they had a public section and
[3:25:40.620 --> 3:25:46.700]  the public section of the of this of this meeting had different scientists uh geo engineers talking
[3:25:46.700 --> 3:25:52.380]  about their various programs that they wanted to implement and what was fascinating about this group
[3:25:52.380 --> 3:25:57.900]  is they admitted right there that they had kind of hidden the word geoengineering for the public
[3:25:57.900 --> 3:26:04.540]  for a long time because they realized that if it came out the public would object so there was a
[3:26:04.540 --> 3:26:09.900]  there was kind of disquestered group that decided that they were going to work on this have the
[3:26:09.900 --> 3:26:16.220]  funding for this and then try to get it all set to go so that at some point they could implement
[3:26:16.220 --> 3:26:21.420]  putting these chemicals and particulates into the atmosphere to do these atmospheric experiments
[3:26:21.420 --> 3:26:26.140]  stop stop stop stop stop stop you go to this conference and there's copies of the minutes
[3:26:26.140 --> 3:26:29.260]  and things on the web so we and i've seen them we need to dig them out and get them posted and
[3:26:29.260 --> 3:26:34.380]  you've linked to them on your site think of the magnitude you've got all these top client climate
[3:26:34.380 --> 3:26:39.820]  scientists there and it's all and by the way these were the the mid levels being co-opted oh
[3:26:39.820 --> 3:26:45.740]  we just came up with a plan to secretly terraform but you can't let the public know they're not ready
[3:26:45.740 --> 3:26:50.460]  even though this is a semi-public meeting that's how the co-opt works when it's already being
[3:26:50.460 --> 3:26:57.260]  gone on you know for over a decade before this that is what is so key about this and this mindset
[3:26:57.260 --> 3:27:02.780]  of we can't let them know because they're too small minded specifically that is so important go back
[3:27:02.780 --> 3:27:08.380]  over that okay well what they did is they said the public would object because in other words
[3:27:09.100 --> 3:27:13.340]  they can't control the end result of their experiments they know that they would be putting
[3:27:13.340 --> 3:27:19.340]  harmful chemicals in the air they know that you know like sulfur for example or in other words
[3:27:19.340 --> 3:27:24.940]  salt particles there's all kinds of things that they've got planned that they could use in the air
[3:27:24.940 --> 3:27:32.780]  that would be toxic to us or to plants or crops whatever water supplies so what happened is they
[3:27:32.780 --> 3:27:37.980]  decided that that they were going to be the stewards of the environment and it was going to be them
[3:27:37.980 --> 3:27:43.500]  that was going to save the world and that we were essentially the unwashed as professor
[3:27:43.500 --> 3:27:48.380]  benford mentioned it was kind of like we were the the people were the unwashed masses who didn't
[3:27:48.380 --> 3:27:55.340]  understand that they were going to take care of us so it was kind of an odd I have some quotes from
[3:27:55.340 --> 3:28:01.340]  him which are quite interesting but it was an odd meeting so when I they had question and answers
[3:28:01.340 --> 3:28:07.180]  so when I got up and I spoke and I said well what about agriculture if you cover us over and you
[3:28:07.180 --> 3:28:11.660]  stop direct sunlight from reaching the earth there won't be any photosynthesis happening
[3:28:12.220 --> 3:28:17.820]  and that's another word photosynthesis direct sunlight hitting the earth is what allows plants
[3:28:17.820 --> 3:28:24.940]  to grow and and food crops to produce and if you remove the direct sunlight whether it's from man-made
[3:28:24.940 --> 3:28:31.900]  clouds or any of these experiments you're going to have lowered crop production because photosynthesis
[3:28:31.900 --> 3:28:39.980]  that plants get their strength and energy to grow from that process so we get vitamin D from the sun
[3:28:40.780 --> 3:28:45.180]  rickets is on the increase because we're in cloud man-made cluck over a lot of times
[3:28:45.180 --> 3:28:51.420]  so when I raised this issue about well was anybody talking about in other words the pollutants and
[3:28:51.420 --> 3:28:57.340]  what effect they were going to have on the trees was anyone talking about our food supply and if
[3:28:57.340 --> 3:29:02.540]  you put up all these chemicals that are toxic to plant life you reduce the amount of sunlight hitting
[3:29:02.540 --> 3:29:08.140]  the earth what's going to happen to agriculture you know in other words this area and I said and
[3:29:08.140 --> 3:29:13.260]  did anyone speak on this subject and they said well there were actually only two people in the
[3:29:13.260 --> 3:29:18.540]  whole conference that spoke on something to do with in other words plant life but that was it
[3:29:19.100 --> 3:29:24.700]  but they said the the majority of the speakers were all there into doing this atmospheric
[3:29:24.700 --> 3:29:32.140]  geoengineering and various forms of it so they see and and they they didn't really invite the public
[3:29:32.140 --> 3:29:40.140]  Ken Calviera invited a radio talk show host he from New York he invited the BBC and Al Jazeera
[3:29:40.140 --> 3:29:45.420]  to this meeting so when they met at Stanford they didn't even invite the major press to come
[3:29:45.420 --> 3:29:48.940]  to this meeting at all all right stay there I don't know there's any recordings of this
[3:29:48.940 --> 3:29:53.340]  we'll be right back I want to go through some of those quotes too riveting we're on the march
[3:29:53.340 --> 3:29:58.620]  the empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:30:02.860 --> 3:30:08.380]  with our economy spiraling out of control living in the soup kitchens may be right around the corner
[3:30:08.380 --> 3:30:14.700]  no one saw the financial collapse of 1929 many didn't make it and millions ended up in soup lines
[3:30:14.700 --> 3:30:22.540]  becoming vagrants begging for food unlike 1929 we can see this collapse coming we have been warned
[3:30:22.540 --> 3:30:27.580]  and right now we have a very small window of opportunity to get food storage into our homes
[3:30:27.580 --> 3:30:33.260]  before it's too late too late why is the Canadian government telling their citizens to stock up why
[3:30:33.260 --> 3:30:38.380]  and why are soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage supplies are running
[3:30:38.380 --> 3:30:43.180]  low having food storage today may be just as important to your family's survival as boarding
[3:30:43.180 --> 3:30:49.260]  the ark was in the days of noah order right now and receive free shipping and all one your supplies

[3:31:07.100 --> 3:31:13.180]  the spear we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful just as
[3:31:13.180 --> 3:31:19.980]  strong just as well funded the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working
[3:31:19.980 --> 3:31:25.180]  for the best interest of the american people while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since
[3:31:25.180 --> 3:31:30.300]  day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[3:31:30.300 --> 3:31:37.180]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's
[3:31:37.180 --> 3:31:43.340]  fascism it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government this film documents who

[3:33:00.140 --> 3:33:17.820]  needs rosalyn peterson she really is the preeminent chemtrail expert because she has just gone to
[3:33:17.820 --> 3:33:22.300]  the conference has done the research and she covers what is admitted what is documented what is on
[3:33:22.300 --> 3:33:27.820]  record and it is hellish now i understand their operation everything is eugenics like in-game
[3:33:27.820 --> 3:33:35.580]  documents that's their system and so the meeting she was at was a co-opting of oh we keep the secret
[3:33:35.580 --> 3:33:41.900]  and the low down for your own good we're going to save the earth for the global warming when the
[3:33:41.900 --> 3:33:46.220]  evidence shows it'll actually cause warming which we may actually need kind of going towards an
[3:33:46.220 --> 3:33:52.780]  ice age now this the sunspot show but side issue the point is they don't want the public knowing
[3:33:52.780 --> 3:34:01.180]  about this and it is just so incredible to understand that it's really public what they're
[3:34:01.180 --> 3:34:08.460]  doing and then so so saying it's to stop global warming is the cover because this is bad for
[3:34:08.460 --> 3:34:13.740]  plants bad for humans bad for the earth the sun is the main source of life on this planet
[3:34:14.540 --> 3:34:18.620]  and you've got some of the quotes of these people and and their meetings are sourced and
[3:34:18.620 --> 3:34:23.180]  quoted i think i have the meeting you're talking about the council on foreign relations mentions
[3:34:23.180 --> 3:34:27.820]  it so can you speak more about the meeting and and then more about i know you're going off what
[3:34:27.820 --> 3:34:32.460]  you know they're doing but clearly they're spraying now and and how many different programs there are
[3:34:32.460 --> 3:34:39.340]  from your research or the other experts and what it is they're putting out go ahead well i there
[3:34:39.340 --> 3:34:46.220]  there's a number of programs that i think are all interrelated we have communication systems
[3:34:46.220 --> 3:34:52.860]  programs for the military we have weapons systems that they're going to need to be able to use
[3:34:52.860 --> 3:34:59.100]  in other words the atmosphere above us either obscure the skies or to in other words or to be
[3:34:59.100 --> 3:35:04.860]  able to use certain types of lasers and so they're going to put up certain chemicals to do this and
[3:35:04.860 --> 3:35:11.180]  the documents are there and it's it's putting it forward to the public but more and more we're
[3:35:11.180 --> 3:35:17.340]  beginning to unravel all these different types of atmospheric military programs that are going on
[3:35:17.980 --> 3:35:25.100]  and weather modification is just one of them that they want to promote along with the cap and trade
[3:35:25.100 --> 3:35:30.220]  legislation it was interesting because they put weather mitigation right into the cap and trade
[3:35:30.220 --> 3:35:35.260]  bill senator barbara boxers cap and trade bill last year and i'm afraid the cap and trade bill
[3:35:35.260 --> 3:35:41.740]  will have weather mitigation and modification in it um in other words to help with climate change
[3:35:41.740 --> 3:35:47.100]  no obama's now said that so now we'll pay al gore and and and obama's private companies
[3:35:48.220 --> 3:35:52.700]  gore and blood is the one in england with mr blood and mr gore and and and literally
[3:35:52.700 --> 3:35:56.700]  that's not a pun folks and the one up in chicago the mercantile that obama's bought in on
[3:35:56.700 --> 3:36:02.780]  yeah no that's what they're saying we're gonna now publicly pay tax money to al gore to kim trellis
[3:36:02.780 --> 3:36:09.180]  you gotta love that well it's going to be interesting to see how this all works out
[3:36:09.180 --> 3:36:15.980]  i can tell you that there is an audio tape of the meeting um and i can get you a copy of the audio
[3:36:15.980 --> 3:36:21.580]  tape of that meeting uh because we because they allowed an audio tape to be made of the meeting
[3:36:21.580 --> 3:36:27.100]  no film but one audio tape and so i can get you a tape of the meeting and you can listen to these
[3:36:27.100 --> 3:36:31.900]  guys talk unbelievable this isn't out on the web yet i mean i mean is it okay if i get it because i
[3:36:31.900 --> 3:36:36.860]  don't want to wait making my kim trell film i don't do that i would immediately just put it on youtube
[3:36:36.860 --> 3:36:42.620]  um yes yeah yes um i it's on i mean i have children just like everybody else i don't
[3:36:42.620 --> 3:36:46.380]  want to breathe in kim trellis anymore i just want to get it out it's on the tape is on new
[3:36:46.380 --> 3:36:54.060]  york skywatch dot com i think and um but i can get you i think that there's it's it's about three
[3:36:54.060 --> 3:36:58.300]  quarters of the tape but i can get you the whole tape oh you are just a sweetheart in fact i was
[3:36:58.300 --> 3:37:03.660]  going to ask you how do we support what you're doing you are just a workhorse at this uh from
[3:37:03.660 --> 3:37:07.020]  doing my research i mean i've been interviewing for years but just finding out how much you're
[3:37:07.020 --> 3:37:10.460]  doing tell folks briefly i know i'm jumping around i'm going to have you back on soon
[3:37:10.460 --> 3:37:15.100]  how did you wake up to this how did you get involved and and and it's just so amazing
[3:37:15.100 --> 3:37:19.580]  what you're doing and how do folks support you uh and how do they go to the site at californi
[3:37:19.580 --> 3:37:25.740]  skywatch dot com and donate or what do they do well what's happening right now is that i started
[3:37:25.740 --> 3:37:32.940]  in 2002 when um a friend of mine um i was um working for the mendicino county probation
[3:37:32.940 --> 3:37:38.620]  department at the time and during my lunch hour uh he caught me down 10 and took me into his office
[3:37:38.620 --> 3:37:45.180]  and said that he knew that there was some programs going on and he wanted me to look up in the sky
[3:37:45.180 --> 3:37:51.020]  and he wanted me to really look on certain days and to see these jets leaving these big plumes
[3:37:51.020 --> 3:37:57.260]  so what happened is that particular day at lunch hour when we walked outside the jets were just
[3:37:57.260 --> 3:38:03.420]  blipsing the place with all these um there was a great number of tips and they were all leaving
[3:38:03.420 --> 3:38:09.500]  these huge contrails which just expanded and turned into these massive plumes and then covered our
[3:38:09.500 --> 3:38:15.980]  sky completely and from then on i was absolutely hooked because i realized that this wasn't right
[3:38:15.980 --> 3:38:22.700]  right and so then that's when my research started and since then i've been really dedicated with
[3:38:22.700 --> 3:38:29.900]  this uh for most of the time since then this is such a massive story and what did you think
[3:38:29.900 --> 3:38:33.260]  when i mean i know last year the cfr announced we're going to terraform the planet we're going
[3:38:33.260 --> 3:38:38.380]  to spray it's great uh we're going to save you when the scientists say it'll heat things but
[3:38:38.380 --> 3:38:43.820]  whatever and you know that's just a cover so the scientists go oh we're saving earth okay keep it
[3:38:43.820 --> 3:38:49.020]  secret from the from the unwashed you're using these arrogant eugenesis terms it's what it's all about
[3:38:49.020 --> 3:38:54.220]  to now having you know all these mainstream news articles and vbc saying oh we're doing this for
[3:38:54.220 --> 3:38:59.020]  your own good and then now having the president's chief scientist advisors saying we may have to
[3:38:59.020 --> 3:39:05.180]  start doing this for your safety i mean what is it like to see them just coming right out with it
[3:39:05.180 --> 3:39:09.660]  why do you think they're doing that because they've been doing it for a long time and we're getting
[3:39:09.660 --> 3:39:15.740]  closer and closer to figuring out all the programs and that that that they're dying to use it and do
[3:39:15.740 --> 3:39:20.460]  the experiments because they want the money they see that they're going to get federal funds for it
[3:39:20.460 --> 3:39:26.860]  for the first time and they can expand the programs and so why not try it out why not do the experiments
[3:39:26.860 --> 3:39:32.460]  we've been studying and researching and this is the payback for us so a lot of these universities
[3:39:32.460 --> 3:39:38.220]  and researchers and geoengineers are going to come and be get fully funded for a lot of these
[3:39:38.220 --> 3:39:43.980]  programs that have been sitting on in the wings for years so as bad as kim trailing as bad as
[3:39:43.980 --> 3:39:49.020]  kim trailing is they want it even bigger that's what the cfr says they say they want it globally
[3:39:49.020 --> 3:39:55.820]  everywhere speak to that and and right now where we know it's going on the worst well i really think
[3:39:55.820 --> 3:40:01.100]  that everybody says that their own area is the worst but i think the nato countries are being
[3:40:01.100 --> 3:40:06.540]  hit the hardest and i think that the united states and canada is being really hit hard
[3:40:06.540 --> 3:40:13.740]  um they're hitting brazil pretty hard in various places um so but but around the world it's pretty
[3:40:13.740 --> 3:40:19.020]  global around the world that you very rarely can see any pictures now with blue skies most of them
[3:40:19.020 --> 3:40:26.540]  are man-made clouds um professor rosenfeld from australia is talking about that uh at a meeting
[3:40:26.540 --> 3:40:35.340]  here um of the climate change commission epa in sacramento california he talked about that most
[3:40:35.340 --> 3:40:41.580]  about that most of clouds we see are man-made clouds and it i was early on in my research and i had
[3:40:41.580 --> 3:40:47.740]  to rather pause and go what and now when you go to the nato website you type in man-made clouds
[3:40:47.740 --> 3:40:54.540]  you got all kinds of studies all kinds of research and they talk about man-made clouds but the problem
[3:40:54.540 --> 3:41:01.980]  is that agriculture human health plant growth tree health everything depends on direct sunlight
[3:41:01.980 --> 3:41:06.540]  well let me stop you yeah i mean i'm i'm keeping a rubbing because you know we had a big garden
[3:41:06.540 --> 3:41:11.740]  out at our ancestral family farm and we've never seen a summer where plants wouldn't grow and not
[3:41:11.740 --> 3:41:17.420]  this summer the summer before it was chemtrails five six days out of the week even here my yard
[3:41:17.420 --> 3:41:25.500]  in the summer was dying it was raining and mush and the yard basically about half of it died trees
[3:41:25.500 --> 3:41:32.220]  were all dying and acting weird and it was just pure chemtrails the entire summer all over central
[3:41:32.220 --> 3:41:37.020]  texas and east texas where i was at i wasn't in other parts and and and in my uncle's garden
[3:41:37.740 --> 3:41:44.380]  just nothing even grew that's correct and it was just solid chemtrails just solid there was no sky
[3:41:45.020 --> 3:41:50.620]  right and when there's no and when there's no um when you have all these man-made clouds and these
[3:41:50.620 --> 3:41:56.140]  plumes and the haze you're not getting direct sunlight which means that your trees won't grow
[3:41:56.140 --> 3:42:02.940]  properly your crops won't produce well you don't your oceans don't function well either because
[3:42:02.940 --> 3:42:08.460]  they need direct sunlight in order to for all the processes here on earth to work and these
[3:42:08.460 --> 3:42:13.900]  scientists are beginning to say well we can put up you know we can pretend like we're a volcano
[3:42:13.900 --> 3:42:18.540]  like the one that just went off in alaska and we can and we can put up these particulates and we
[3:42:18.540 --> 3:42:24.860]  can cool us down but the but the you'll see that's but that's but backwards all the scientists agree
[3:42:24.860 --> 3:42:32.380]  volcanoes cause heating well they cause a degree of cooling well cooling at first but then heating
[3:42:32.380 --> 3:42:38.300]  but go ahead but anyway uh what my whole issue is they put out more more carbon dioxide that they
[3:42:38.300 --> 3:42:43.420]  say heats the earth and i know when krakatoa went off it went down a degree but then they got these
[3:42:43.420 --> 3:42:47.820]  calculations then saying it makes co2 go up and then later makes it go up i'm saying from what
[3:42:47.820 --> 3:42:54.540]  they claim but go ahead but what what happens with this is that if you start to put these
[3:42:54.540 --> 3:42:59.260]  particulates up in these you know they're even talking about fields and they're talking about
[3:42:59.980 --> 3:43:04.780]  all kinds of different you know the oh gosh they must have 40 or 50 different solutions
[3:43:04.780 --> 3:43:08.940]  to all of this that they all want to do at the same time so you won't even know what the
[3:43:08.940 --> 3:43:13.900]  synergistic effects are but the problem is that we've got a case of where that we're already
[3:43:13.900 --> 3:43:19.260]  getting a loss of direct sunlight called global dimming already and when we say well global
[3:43:19.260 --> 3:43:25.500]  dimming is going on and we're putting up more cloud cover and but but still we're warming
[3:43:25.500 --> 3:43:31.100]  well we're warming because this cloud cover and all of these artificial things that are being done
[3:43:31.100 --> 3:43:36.460]  are heating us up and exacerbating the global warming so we have to stop some of these man-made
[3:43:36.460 --> 3:43:42.220]  things and the earth would would come back to to more normal and we could reduce the pollutants
[3:43:42.220 --> 3:43:49.260]  by taxing the polluters like it like the EPA does now instead of thinking of that we're going to
[3:43:49.260 --> 3:43:54.220]  we're going to have these offsets and polluters can buy offsets in order to pollute more you see
[3:43:54.220 --> 3:44:01.100]  this this this cap and trade and this carbon tax and all these things that they're deciding
[3:44:01.100 --> 3:44:06.620]  isn't going to reduce pollution one iota okay specifically though specifically i want to go
[3:44:06.620 --> 3:44:12.060]  back from your scientific research and talking to scientists uh haven't they been reporting though
[3:44:12.060 --> 3:44:16.860]  that the chem trailing overall causes the radiation to go through the clouds and then
[3:44:16.860 --> 3:44:22.380]  bounce back up and keep the heat in so so so that part of the project is heating that part of the
[3:44:22.380 --> 3:44:27.500]  project is heating so what they're already doing is they're heating but see i think that there might
[3:44:27.500 --> 3:44:32.300]  be another you know this is speculation on my part and i'll jump here in the real speculation
[3:44:32.300 --> 3:44:40.220]  is that i know that in the arctic and in alaska i know that the oil companies and the military
[3:44:40.220 --> 3:44:47.100]  want to get into those areas and open up those areas for exploration and and military programs
[3:44:47.100 --> 3:44:51.420]  and see what they're doing is they say well if we we use water vapor and we heat it up
[3:44:52.220 --> 3:44:57.980]  up in alaska and we get it to melt then we can go in uh like xon mobiles doing right now and we
[3:44:57.980 --> 3:45:05.900]  can exploit the natural resources in those frozen areas so i'm not quite sure um if if if we're not
[3:45:05.900 --> 3:45:11.740]  doing some something deliberate here to warm up certain areas and then the geo engineers like it
[3:45:11.740 --> 3:45:17.900]  because then they can they can um you know call this a great you know problem that we're having and
[3:45:17.900 --> 3:45:22.940]  we're going to solve global warming but i think that they're exacerbating it and i think that the
[3:45:22.940 --> 3:45:28.380]  jets and these big plumes all of this stuff is heating us up so let me throw another question
[3:45:28.380 --> 3:45:31.900]  at you because you're such an expert i've got so many i apologize i keep interrupting have you
[3:45:31.900 --> 3:45:38.300]  heard about um an hash in this big australian movie about the government with chemtrails
[3:45:38.300 --> 3:45:43.580]  spraying viruses on people and then now it aired on australian tv and then they suddenly pulled it
[3:45:43.580 --> 3:45:48.940]  off imdb have you heard of this i've heard that it was pulled and and not available right now
[3:45:48.940 --> 3:45:55.740]  but i mean it was on tv and then suddenly pulled uh how bizarre is that let's let's play the trailer
[3:45:55.740 --> 3:45:59.900]  for that for folks right now watching at prison planet dot tv and listening on the radio here it is
[3:46:02.860 --> 3:46:10.060]  it's gonna it's loading slowly here you guys give me some audio hours ago we learned of a
[3:46:10.060 --> 3:46:16.300]  deadly virus that threatens the lives of the citizens who spoke and tess thanks for getting
[3:46:16.300 --> 3:46:22.220]  here so fast this is dr martin she's a specialist with the global health organization we have three
[3:46:22.220 --> 3:46:26.460]  new cases all presenting the same acute flu like symptoms but they're not responding to any of the
[3:46:26.460 --> 3:46:32.380]  treatment she's gonna be dead by the time i get the results back you must have some initial thoughts
[3:46:32.380 --> 3:46:36.780]  of what it could be it could be anything from the avian flu to the bubonic plague we're not
[3:46:36.780 --> 3:46:42.220]  gonna quarantine a whole town until we know what we're dealing with find the source make the diagnosis
[3:46:42.220 --> 3:46:46.860]  and you'll have your quarantine we're counting on you look quicker you tell me what you know the
[3:46:46.860 --> 3:46:53.660]  faster i can help all these people professor dylan corbin saw him after he came back from a trip
[3:46:53.660 --> 3:46:58.700]  and he wasn't well i say he's been dead two three days he had a mosquito bite on him and he's been
[3:46:58.700 --> 3:47:04.780]  to malaysia rush that's the plague professor corbin bring back more than just his luggage
[3:47:04.780 --> 3:47:08.220]  from malaysia are you following me it's more going on here than you know dr martin
[3:47:08.220 --> 3:47:14.220]  you're putting something in the jet fuel it's making people sad why would they want to do that
[3:47:14.220 --> 3:47:19.820]  keller makes a chemical called e 901 let me get the e 901 and compare with the jet fuel maybe you
[3:47:19.820 --> 3:47:24.940]  can help us figure out what's hurting people whatever he told you is totally aromas the patients
[3:47:24.940 --> 3:47:29.820]  are not responding to the antibiotics all the immune systems are completely shot the plague
[3:47:29.820 --> 3:47:33.420]  doesn't do that no i know but i think it's why they're not responding to the antibiotics so what
[3:47:33.420 --> 3:47:38.540]  do i do in these diagnoses they're rid of chem trails what if the chemicals are affecting the
[3:47:38.540 --> 3:47:44.940]  general population somehow they've killed before and they'll kill again this virus could have been
[3:47:44.940 --> 3:47:51.580]  spread all over the country by now humans is bleeding they're all gonna die if i can't find a cure
[3:47:51.580 --> 3:47:58.780]  i'm gonna die don't give up on me tell us where the vaccine is you can go to hell you don't have
[3:47:58.780 --> 3:48:06.140]  to worry about the vaccine you're both going to die before anyone gets a chance to use it and now
[3:48:06.140 --> 3:48:11.660]  they've pulled it off imdb they never put a film up and then pull it down and it's i mean folks
[3:48:11.660 --> 3:48:15.660]  here's the deal we have confirmed they're building mass graves all over the country we have the
[3:48:15.660 --> 3:48:20.060]  rocky mountain news where they have built incinerators and mass graves the executive order
[3:48:20.060 --> 3:48:24.700]  in colorado we have the feds going to the states confirmed in triplicate with the documents they're
[3:48:24.700 --> 3:48:29.900]  building mass graves for the bird flu uh the london telegraph admits they caught the government
[3:48:29.900 --> 3:48:34.380]  telling people it was a regular flu shot and killing them in europe with a live bird flu
[3:48:35.260 --> 3:48:39.580]  my god these people are psychopathic and and they always love to throw it in our faces in a movie
[3:48:39.580 --> 3:48:44.220]  or maybe an haste was trying to warn people that's why they pulled it this is getting a little crazy
[3:48:44.220 --> 3:48:51.740]  isn't it um well we're beginning to be railroaded into scare tactics into taking actions that we
[3:48:51.740 --> 3:48:57.420]  wouldn't take under normal circumstances we would think about it and we would have public discussions
[3:48:57.420 --> 3:49:02.380]  and right now we're more and more being told what they're going to do but we're not the public is
[3:49:02.380 --> 3:49:08.780]  not being become becoming part of the the conversation and so it's easier to jack up um
[3:49:08.780 --> 3:49:13.900]  in other words some conspiracy theory and say well the public that objects they don't understand
[3:49:13.900 --> 3:49:18.940]  they're ignorant or they don't you know they don't know what they're talking about and thus we the
[3:49:18.940 --> 3:49:24.940]  elite will will be will we will we will tell you what we are going to do and how we are going to
[3:49:24.940 --> 3:49:29.580]  save you or not isn't that what it's all about is playing god these people like i said we're the
[3:49:29.580 --> 3:49:36.220]  unwashed masses yeah uh it's it's playing god and i thought that these do engineers at stanford
[3:49:36.220 --> 3:49:42.300]  university were really playing god i i really believe that um because i was shocked when i was
[3:49:42.300 --> 3:49:47.740]  listening to them and i said well what about plant life what about photosynthesis i was talking about
[3:49:47.740 --> 3:49:53.900]  well what about you know crop production and uh they just they you know that this was this was
[3:49:53.900 --> 3:49:59.660]  so far out of their realm because they didn't want to talk about it um and they actually brought up
[3:49:59.660 --> 3:50:06.940]  in the meeting they they they one guy who didn't like my questions he he he said to the audience
[3:50:06.940 --> 3:50:12.940]  who was mostly professors and uh in other words people that were in in that field and he said
[3:50:12.940 --> 3:50:19.180]  well how many people believe in chemtrails and i i just sat there and i looked at him and i thought
[3:50:19.180 --> 3:50:25.820]  and so then he he went he he looked kind of funny because there wasn't any great show of hands for
[3:50:25.820 --> 3:50:31.340]  this for this phenomena within this audience because they they just sat there and he says oh
[3:50:31.340 --> 3:50:37.580]  well that's some sort of conspiracy theory and but but the thing is they got very angry with me
[3:50:37.580 --> 3:50:40.860]  in the break stop there i want to hear more about this notice they're admitting they're going to
[3:50:40.860 --> 3:50:47.420]  geo engineer things block out the sun you say well the plants need sun which is admitted photosynthesis
[3:50:47.420 --> 3:50:53.660]  no no no that's a conspiracy theory that plants have photosynthesis in fact that plants exist

[3:55:23.580 --> 3:55:29.020]  me government documents or uh in other words any type of public document government study
[3:55:29.020 --> 3:55:34.620]  university study on these subjects because the more that we know and can put all the pieces of
[3:55:34.620 --> 3:55:40.380]  the puzzle together the the sooner we're going to be able to step up and that's right pin them
[3:55:40.380 --> 3:55:45.740]  with the actual facts so that they can't just come back and do what the air force does uh write
[3:55:45.740 --> 3:55:51.820]  letters for senator diane feinstein uh to her constituents saying that there's no such thing
[3:55:51.820 --> 3:55:57.980]  as as uh chemtrails it's a hope and therefore nothing is going on and everything is wonderful
[3:55:57.980 --> 3:56:04.540]  and normal and those of us who have been around when when the skies were deep blue most of the
[3:56:04.540 --> 3:56:10.140]  time and clouds were real know that this is just not true because things are not like they used
[3:56:10.140 --> 3:56:15.420]  to be at all that's what i was about to say is that looking you know when you look at the uh
[3:56:16.220 --> 3:56:20.620]  you know different terms that you can google to pull up university studies it's it's not chemtrails
[3:56:20.620 --> 3:56:26.060]  it's uh what uh you know aerial aerosol spray that you know different terms you can look at
[3:56:26.060 --> 3:56:31.180]  weather modification there they are there they are doing it this is bigger than the manhattan
[3:56:31.180 --> 3:56:37.660]  project i mean this sucker is massive and they're publicly about to make it bigger yes and i think
[3:56:37.660 --> 3:56:42.380]  that they're going to say well you know they're going to railroad us into saying well the the world
[3:56:42.380 --> 3:56:47.580]  is warming and we need to fix it but i don't see them doing anything about the jet airplanes
[3:56:47.580 --> 3:56:53.020]  leaving these contrails that are exacerbating it and they don't talk about the aviation problems
[3:56:53.020 --> 3:57:00.380]  um that that this is causing so when we say we want to do something about global warming
[3:57:00.380 --> 3:57:05.420]  then no one is going to is how come no one steps up and says well look what we're doing
[3:57:05.420 --> 3:57:10.300]  why don't we reduce what we're doing and this would this would change it almost immediately
[3:57:10.300 --> 3:57:15.420]  well they want total domination it's like in 97 when secretary defense said we can now control
[3:57:15.420 --> 3:57:20.060]  the weather and he said that in a press briefing and so that's on record the secretary defense
[3:57:20.060 --> 3:57:24.380]  William Cohen uh they're playing god and just like they told us there's no new world order
[3:57:24.380 --> 3:57:28.380]  there's no royal government there's no bank of the world we're not planning a global currency and
[3:57:28.380 --> 3:57:34.140]  then oh we're setting up a north american union in a global government we just got the idea today
[3:57:34.940 --> 3:57:39.660]  you know they deny deny deny deny and then finally go okay it's a done deal we've been doing it forever
