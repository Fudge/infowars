[00:00.000 --> 00:09.440]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:09.440 --> 00:12.520]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12.520 --> 00:13.520]  That's right.
[00:13.520 --> 00:17.840]  I am going right into a special report by John Bowne.
[00:17.840 --> 00:24.320]  Obama's dangerous immigration numbers lie because it integrates with open globalism.
[00:24.320 --> 00:29.280]  Every foreign government you can imagine telling us we can't have Donald Trump just breaking
[00:29.280 --> 00:32.760]  our will, telling us that we are under international control.
[00:32.760 --> 00:38.520]  And now, from Bloomberg, stop Trump movement gets boost from Mexico efforts in the U.S.
[00:38.520 --> 00:41.720]  to turning legals into citizens to take over the U.S.
[00:41.720 --> 00:43.360]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[00:43.360 --> 00:48.840]  Recently, President Obama and his motorcade of citywide gridlock rolled into Austin, Texas
[00:48.840 --> 00:54.660]  to push more Big Brother-style federal control of the technology sector at the 2016 South
[00:54.660 --> 00:56.560]  By Southwest Festival.
[00:56.560 --> 01:01.280]  But it was a remark he made during his stop at a Democratic National Committee reception
[01:01.280 --> 01:06.840]  that drew ire to the ears of anyone paying attention to the growing threat building up
[01:06.840 --> 01:08.560]  on the Texas border.
[01:08.560 --> 01:14.080]  Obama claimed illegal immigration is lower than it's been in 40 years.
[01:14.080 --> 01:19.000]  This statement was nothing less than a bait and switch aimed at the supposed stupidity
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  of the American people and a dangerous statement to boot.
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.480]  While so, you ask, Obama was referring to the comparison of border patrol apprehension
[01:28.480 --> 01:32.120]  numbers in the 1970s to the present numbers.
[01:32.120 --> 01:39.120]  The DHS defines apprehension data as data representing events and not individuals.
[01:39.120 --> 01:50.360]  Since 1970, apprehension numbers rose from 231,116 to 888,729 by 1979.
[01:50.360 --> 01:55.000]  Preparations continue to increase, averaging in the millions through the 80s, the 90s and
[01:55.000 --> 01:56.800]  the beginning of the new millennium.
[01:56.800 --> 02:02.520]  Under George W. Bush, apprehension numbers began to decline in 2007 after Bush urged
[02:02.520 --> 02:07.400]  Congress to allow more than 12 million illegal immigrants to work in the United States under
[02:07.400 --> 02:09.760]  a temporary guest worker program.
[02:09.760 --> 02:14.800]  As the presidential baton was handed to yet another New World Order puppet, Obama opened
[02:14.800 --> 02:21.240]  the floodgates for mass exodus with an unconstitutional executive order protecting 5 million illegals.
[02:21.240 --> 02:27.560]  Meanwhile, in February of 2016, DHS quietly created a new policy making it mandatory for
[02:27.560 --> 02:33.200]  border patrol agents to release illegals without a notice to appear before a judge.
[02:33.200 --> 02:38.380]  The numbers don't lie, it's Obama's claim that is a bold-faced deception.
[02:38.380 --> 02:44.200]  The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that at least 2.5 million illegals have settled
[02:44.200 --> 02:49.840]  in the United States since Obama took office, far more than came in under Bush.
[02:49.840 --> 02:55.160]  But those numbers are hard to gauge as the border patrols' hands are tied on apprehensions.
[02:55.160 --> 02:59.320]  Although narcotics and illegal immigrant smuggling were conducted by organized crime, it was
[02:59.320 --> 03:03.720]  not nearly on the level we see the cartels operating today.
[03:03.720 --> 03:07.840]  There were even relatively small-time players conducting smuggling operations within a given
[03:07.840 --> 03:09.680]  area of operations.
[03:09.680 --> 03:14.520]  Although violence could and did erupt, the older generation of smugglers took the long-view.
[03:14.520 --> 03:18.760]  They would rather risk losing a load of narcotics to the border patrol than opening fire on
[03:18.760 --> 03:20.160]  agents.
[03:20.160 --> 03:25.000]  Violence brought unwanted attention on both sides of the border and that was bad for business.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.920]  This all began to unravel in the early 2000s with the emergence of the drug cartels.
[03:29.920 --> 03:34.360]  These cartels are well-organized, heavily armed, and pathologically violent.
[03:34.360 --> 03:38.980]  To give you a sense of the violence, the official death toll, as you quoted earlier, the official
[03:38.980 --> 03:42.440]  death toll from the cartel violence in Mexico is 60,000.
[03:42.440 --> 03:45.600]  This is more than the United States military lost in Vietnam.
[03:45.600 --> 03:52.360]  However, the unofficial death toll in Mexico is over 120,000 killed and another 27,000
[03:52.360 --> 03:54.520]  missing and presumed dead.
[03:54.520 --> 03:59.320]  In Mexico, the cartels kill without hesitation or fear of prosecution.
[03:59.320 --> 04:03.420]  In May of this year, cartel members shot down a Mexican Army helicopter in the state of
[04:03.420 --> 04:04.800]  Jalisco.
[04:04.800 --> 04:09.760]  Why would we expect them to behave any differently on the U.S.-Mexico border?
[04:09.760 --> 04:15.320]  In 2014, the border patrol apprehended and arrested just under 500,000 illegal immigrants,
[04:15.320 --> 04:21.840]  meaning that one in every five arrests last year by the border patrol was a criminal alien.
[04:21.840 --> 04:26.840]  Almost 50% of the criminal aliens supported in 2014 were convicted of aggravated felonies.
[04:26.840 --> 04:32.400]  These charges include murder, rape, sexual assault of a child, and drug and weapons trafficking.
[04:32.400 --> 04:36.720]  These are not petty criminals, and approximately 60% of those deported last year had already
[04:36.720 --> 04:39.000]  been deported at least once before.
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.120]  Now the immigration crisis has fallen into the laps of state game wardens, who are now
[04:44.120 --> 04:49.840]  using devices to detect radioactive material being smuggled into the United States that
[04:49.840 --> 04:53.240]  could be used in a nuclear terroristic event.
[04:53.240 --> 04:58.320]  Clearly, national security has been grossly compromised, and the New World Order puppet
[04:58.320 --> 04:59.960]  in chief has something nefarious.
[04:59.960 --> 05:03.400]  Today is Monday, March 21, and here are some of the top stories.
[05:03.400 --> 05:07.720]  The electronic voting firm that's counting Tuesday's Utah GOP election results is headed
[05:07.720 --> 05:09.240]  by George Soros and Cider.
[05:09.240 --> 05:13.320]  The chairman of the smartmatic group is Lord Mark Malik Brown, who is also on the board
[05:13.320 --> 05:18.040]  of Soros' Open Society Foundation and has close ties to the socialist billionaire.
[05:18.040 --> 05:22.520]  Soros, who has given over 13 million to Hillary Clinton for the election, formally warned Donald
[05:22.520 --> 05:26.560]  Trump that there will be, quote, consequences for his campaign to secure the U.S. border.
[05:26.560 --> 05:31.120]  In similar news, Mexico is pressuring its permanent residents in the U.S. to become citizens,
[05:31.120 --> 05:35.760]  a status that would enable them to vote, presumably against Trump if the Mexican government gets
[05:35.760 --> 05:36.760]  its way.
[05:36.760 --> 05:40.840]  Officially, Mexico claims it respects U.S. sovereignty and has no strategy to influence
[05:40.840 --> 05:42.560]  the results of the presidential race.
[05:42.560 --> 05:47.800]  Yet, Mexican diplomats are hosting free workshops to assist immigrants in gaining U.S. citizenship.
[05:47.800 --> 05:51.880]  And remember back in 2014 when radio host Glenn Beck was giving out free gifts to the
[05:51.880 --> 05:53.400]  legal surging across the border?
[05:53.400 --> 05:56.000]  Well, it turns out that Ted Cruz was also helping him.
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  For more news, visit infowars.com.

[08:17.520 --> 08:30.840]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance,
[08:30.840 --> 08:36.440]  it's Alex Jones.
[08:36.440 --> 08:43.480]  Just when I think the globalists can't get any more out in the open, they double down.
[08:43.480 --> 08:48.960]  Look at the headline from Bloomberg.
[08:48.960 --> 08:58.160]  And it's reporting that makes this incredible act of aggression and internal meddling in
[08:58.160 --> 09:09.480]  our national affairs look like it's just completely normal, standard, and kosher.
[09:09.480 --> 09:10.480]  Here's the headline.
[09:10.480 --> 09:18.400]  Bloomberg, stop Trump movement, gets boost from Mexico efforts in the U.S., and the
[09:18.400 --> 09:24.720]  Mexican government is running TV ads, running radio ads, running print ads, spending money,
[09:24.720 --> 09:34.960]  and working with, quote, Spanish language, news, and entertainment to push illegals,
[09:34.960 --> 09:38.520]  you name it, to, quote, hurry up and become citizens.
[09:38.520 --> 09:42.360]  That means hurry up and get driver's license in California and other states, and illegally
[09:42.360 --> 09:43.360]  vote.
[09:43.360 --> 09:44.680]  That's what this really is.
[09:44.680 --> 09:50.600]  Can you imagine if we were down in Mexico telling them who to elect, telling them what
[09:50.600 --> 09:52.520]  to do, they would laugh at us?
[09:52.520 --> 09:57.160]  Because for all Mexico's problems, they at least are nationalist.
[09:57.160 --> 10:04.600]  The communist Chinese government has come out and called him Hitler, Donald Trump, and
[10:04.600 --> 10:10.520]  threatened the United States and threatened Congress that you better not elect him.
[10:10.520 --> 10:17.080]  We have seen the British government, the current Mexican president, the former Mexican president,
[10:17.080 --> 10:24.640]  Saudi Arabia, the list goes on and on saying, listen, you better not elect Donald Trump.
[10:24.640 --> 10:28.000]  And why is that?
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.440]  Because Donald Trump has never gone through the regular political system.
[10:32.440 --> 10:35.320]  He's a maverick.
[10:35.320 --> 10:40.200]  And that's why they've created this giant hoax that he's racist and that what he's
[10:40.200 --> 10:47.480]  saying is outrageous so that a lot of trendies who have college degrees that they'll never
[10:47.480 --> 10:54.240]  get a job with, they'll be back in groceries for the rest of their lives, can feel like
[10:54.240 --> 11:01.720]  they're good people and go vote in polls, a national poll where 54% who were polled said
[11:01.720 --> 11:07.040]  we want to punch Donald Trump in the nose.
[11:07.040 --> 11:10.320]  These are the same people that wanted Obama and wanted free healthcare and didn't get
[11:10.320 --> 11:11.320]  it.
[11:11.320 --> 11:15.720]  And now they want Bernie Sanders because he's promising him the free healthcare.
[11:15.720 --> 11:19.640]  All you got was a foreign bank screw job.
[11:19.640 --> 11:27.000]  These people are consummate, pseudo-intellectual, ignorant, anti-free speech, hateful people.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.280]  I didn't even get to all the clips yesterday, I played one of the professors running up
[11:32.280 --> 11:36.520]  saying, get me some muscle, no free speech allowed and trying to attack people.
[11:36.520 --> 11:40.200]  And the other clips of the woman running up in Chicago saying, you're interviewing a
[11:40.200 --> 11:41.200]  woman of color.
[11:41.200 --> 11:45.120]  You're not allowed to do that because you're a white male with white privilege.
[11:45.120 --> 11:46.920]  No free speech.
[11:46.920 --> 11:51.080]  Leigh Ann McAdoo talked to folks downtown who would just sit there and say the most racist
[11:51.080 --> 11:58.440]  things about white people, but it was okay because they're a minority.
[11:58.440 --> 12:06.840]  And this is the climate being fostered and pushed for the swallowing up of this country
[12:06.840 --> 12:11.920]  into global fascism.
[12:11.920 --> 12:22.920]  And it really shows how far we've sunk that everyone just arrogantly does it because they
[12:22.920 --> 12:35.600]  know America on average are a bunch of rudderless, dumb down, mainstream media consuming, arrested
[12:35.600 --> 12:38.320]  development, boobs.
[12:38.320 --> 12:45.640]  When I say boobs, I say that for a reason, the popular term boob just means an idiot.
[12:45.640 --> 12:48.840]  No it doesn't, it's a booby.
[12:48.840 --> 12:54.360]  It's a dumb, stupid, hateful pirate.
[12:54.360 --> 12:58.240]  And that's what these folks are who, I don't care what color they are, they can't get
[12:58.240 --> 13:03.520]  a job, they don't want to work hard, they just dream of conquest, how in groups they're
[13:03.520 --> 13:10.720]  going to go vote to get some free goodies, and then I monitored Fox singing in MSNBC,
[13:10.720 --> 13:14.280]  the cover of the statesman this morning, almost bought one at the gas station, I just couldn't
[13:14.280 --> 13:19.720]  bring myself to do it.
[13:19.720 --> 13:25.240]  And it said Obama gets warm welcome in Cuba from Cubans.
[13:25.240 --> 13:30.520]  That's the Cubans that aren't locked up a half million of them for being political dissidents.
[13:30.520 --> 13:36.800]  The government warned everyone on loudspeakers and on radio and TV, do not come out in protest
[13:36.800 --> 13:40.040]  or you'll be arrested and basically permanently detained.
[13:40.040 --> 13:44.520]  And be on your best behavior and dress nice and work extra hard while Obama's here and
[13:44.520 --> 13:45.520]  keep the streets clean.
[13:45.520 --> 13:47.600]  And you know what, they follow their orders.
[13:47.600 --> 13:51.880]  The country is collapsing.
[13:51.880 --> 14:01.680]  It has basically no manufacturing, but it has a bunch of arrogant ruling class communists
[14:01.680 --> 14:06.720]  waddling around, bossing everybody about.
[14:06.720 --> 14:10.760]  Just like China has all these top generals and people making billions of dollars shitting
[14:10.760 --> 14:17.240]  on top slave factories, where they'll just decide at mines and factories to go, you know
[14:17.240 --> 14:22.160]  what, we're not paying you now.
[14:22.160 --> 14:31.680]  And they lock the workers up in container buildings and just keep them as slaves.
[14:31.680 --> 14:36.080]  And if you complain, they grab you and go and put you in a jail cell, blood test you,
[14:36.080 --> 14:39.960]  get your genetic type ready and prepare you for harvesting.
[14:39.960 --> 14:48.160]  This is who Zuckerberg and Obama and the globalist are in love with.
[14:48.160 --> 14:58.320]  This is who they are flaming, dripping, stinking, authoritarians who have taken the wealth of
[14:58.320 --> 15:05.280]  America and used it to buy off a bunch of idiots and keep it at subsistence level.
[15:05.280 --> 15:13.360]  Then they use class envy, the program, the masses, who dream of some red flag takeover
[15:13.360 --> 15:23.880]  where they'll be living in wealthy people's mansions.
[15:23.880 --> 15:27.840]  I can't tell you how many people came up to me and on air and in press interviews and
[15:27.840 --> 15:31.800]  say, but national healthcare is wonderful.
[15:31.800 --> 15:35.680]  It's wonderful in Canada, it's wonderful in England.
[15:35.680 --> 15:43.000]  And I'd say you can look at the dissatisfaction and national polls in both countries.
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.280]  They come here to get their healthcare, the middle class and wealthy.
[15:48.280 --> 15:55.480]  They don't get it in England and they have a two tier system like you pay property taxes
[15:55.480 --> 15:59.360]  but you don't send your kids to public school, you send them to private school, same thing.
[15:59.360 --> 16:05.120]  They have a elite clinic and hospital system that the government has to allow you to get
[16:05.120 --> 16:10.160]  to but if you're part of the insider club, then you're allowed to go get that just like
[16:10.160 --> 16:16.960]  in China and in Germany and in England and the rest of the UK, it's been in the news.
[16:16.960 --> 16:24.920]  They have special hospitals they go to, special MRIs, special clean vaccines, special organic
[16:24.920 --> 16:31.280]  reservations, I don't know, I was watching a PBS documentary over a decade ago and it
[16:31.280 --> 16:38.200]  was Prince Philip out at one of the largest palaces, it was actually, you know, hundreds
[16:38.200 --> 16:43.400]  of square miles and they had all these old villages there that they kept old fashioned
[16:43.400 --> 16:49.440]  with blacksmiths and cows and sheep and ducks and everything's organic and it was Philip
[16:49.440 --> 16:54.080]  going in himself to just say, I want this, I want that and going all organic, nothing
[16:54.080 --> 16:57.000]  but organic, nothing but pure, nothing but good.
[16:57.000 --> 17:03.000]  That's what they have in China, just search engine, the stories, Chinese elite have secret
[17:03.000 --> 17:16.320]  organic farms and they have the army growing it for them in greenhouses
[17:16.320 --> 17:28.840]  and they wear masks when they go outside and then you see all these soft, just incredibly
[17:28.840 --> 17:36.000]  stupid looking trendies who you talk to them and they're just arrogant morons who think
[17:36.000 --> 17:43.560]  they're smart because they repeat talking points they get from their local trendy publications
[17:43.560 --> 17:49.920]  and they think Mao is sexy, they think Cuba's sexy, they just get off on it as they lounge
[17:49.920 --> 17:57.080]  around in designer clothes and play on slave made iPhones, they are the biggest contradictions
[17:57.080 --> 18:01.720]  I've ever seen.
[18:01.720 --> 18:07.760]  There's a video up on infowars.com, we're going to play some of it coming up for a Tucson
[18:07.760 --> 18:11.880]  cop who happens to be black, says he didn't know what to think of Trump so he went to
[18:11.880 --> 18:17.200]  form the rallies, the Trump people are all incredibly polite, nice and then here come
[18:17.200 --> 18:22.800]  the trendies, the communists, the black lives matter people spitting and yelling and shoving
[18:22.800 --> 18:28.200]  and jabbing, he couldn't believe the Trump people sat there and took it and then of course
[18:28.200 --> 18:34.560]  they had announcements before too, don't resist, don't fight back and he just kept saying why
[18:34.560 --> 18:39.960]  is it this in the news, why do they keep saying Trump is inciting this, the few times there's
[18:39.960 --> 18:47.160]  been somebody swinging and punching and hitting people, Trump has said I'll go ahead and punch
[18:47.160 --> 18:54.640]  that guy back, it's totally normal response, if I was Trump I'd say we're not looking
[18:54.640 --> 18:58.800]  for trouble, we've got the police and secret service here but if some thug comes up and
[18:58.800 --> 19:06.240]  punches you you have a right to defend yourself but don't swing till they swing, no he's basically
[19:06.240 --> 19:12.280]  now just said I guess roll over to it and man you see these hateful dumb dirt bags that
[19:12.280 --> 19:18.400]  are doing this, these people don't have jobs, they are maxed out credit cards, maxed out
[19:18.400 --> 19:24.920]  student loans, maxed out everything and they live in these echo chambers on these universities
[19:24.920 --> 19:31.680]  in total fantasy land, they're not out there in America at the factories and the trucks
[19:31.680 --> 19:37.480]  and the people working hard every race, color and creed, trying to live a life trying to
[19:37.480 --> 19:43.200]  take care of your kids, they're just a bunch of spoiled snot-nosed idiots who like to live
[19:43.200 --> 19:50.400]  in Cuba even though they've never been there, I tell you if I see one more communists get
[19:50.400 --> 19:55.360]  out of a brand new Mercedes or Jaguar I'm gonna throw up too, these people a lot of
[19:55.360 --> 20:00.920]  know they're just a takeover fraud, a lot of know what they're doing.
[20:00.920 --> 20:05.400]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego, the old guys in
[20:05.400 --> 20:09.760]  the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head to head
[20:09.760 --> 20:14.760]  fitness tests, how is this even possible? Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part
[20:14.760 --> 20:19.520]  of a special test group for a doctor formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power

[22:33.920 --> 22:38.360]  was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River. I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[22:38.360 --> 22:43.520]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years. His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it.

[24:08.120 --> 24:11.960]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, we're here live. I host the first
[24:11.960 --> 24:18.200]  three hours then. It's InfoWars fourth hour overdrive. Today, Paul Watson will be quarterbacking
[24:18.200 --> 24:23.440]  the fourth hour. Okay, I need to get to the Cuba visit in specifics. I need to get into
[24:23.440 --> 24:29.680]  China censorship. Working with Zuckerberg, I need to get to Clinton emails reveal Google
[24:29.680 --> 24:37.600]  sought overthrow of Syria's Assad. Folks, when we went and covered Bilderberg four years
[24:37.600 --> 24:44.760]  ago in England, months before they had had Google with all these different intelligence
[24:44.760 --> 24:54.160]  agencies, Apple and Twitter meeting at the very same Watford estate, for months they
[24:54.160 --> 24:59.600]  had just closed it and used it as a command base to organize the Arab Spring. And that
[24:59.600 --> 25:06.520]  was in trade publications but not in the newspapers. Because the newspapers know not to report
[25:06.520 --> 25:13.080]  on that, but then the establishment still puts out reports bragging about their success.
[25:13.080 --> 25:21.360]  So again, we told you that five years ago, four years ago, it's now in her emails. And
[25:21.360 --> 25:28.120]  that's what I'm getting at. These technocrats, these big tech companies have been created
[25:28.120 --> 25:36.800]  by Incutel, the CIA, NSA and others. And they set up these corporate heads who are just
[25:36.800 --> 25:45.240]  fronts of these companies. Microsoft was set up by IBM. IBM is a OSS precursor. I mean,
[25:45.240 --> 25:49.440]  this is in the literature. You just have to read IBM and the Holocaust and other Pulitzer
[25:49.440 --> 25:55.800]  Prize winning books to actually get deep into the meat of it. It's a shadow government.
[25:55.800 --> 26:01.160]  In fact, you guys pulled me the Boston Globe out of the stack yesterday where top government
[26:01.160 --> 26:04.600]  insider comes out and says, listen, there's a whole shadow government. Everything's run
[26:04.600 --> 26:08.960]  by foreign interest. We're in trouble. And this is an establishment guy that came out
[26:08.960 --> 26:15.420]  and said this. They knew this in the 60s, ladies and gentlemen, when books like shadow
[26:15.420 --> 26:22.580]  government were written. And so we're here telling you fact. Occasionally I get into
[26:22.580 --> 26:26.640]  esoteric things and, you know, say all I know is whoever's running this world is evil.
[26:26.640 --> 26:31.240]  It's like the devil out of the Bible. And who's the devil? A fallen angel of this planet
[26:31.240 --> 26:36.960]  marooned here oppressing mankind. So they had literally over 20 publications last week
[26:36.960 --> 26:44.320]  say, Jones says the devil's a space alien and you know, is wants to destroy mankind.
[26:44.320 --> 26:48.920]  I've said whether you're an atheist or whether you're a Christian or whether you're an agnostic,
[26:48.920 --> 26:52.640]  the elite believe they're going to become gods. That's what Ray Kurzweil says. They
[26:52.640 --> 26:57.400]  believe that they're merging with machines. They believe humanity's obsolete. It fits
[26:57.400 --> 27:04.360]  the Bible narrative to a T so it's real or they're copying it and manifesting it and
[27:04.360 --> 27:14.880]  making it real. That's what I said again out of context. Obama is sitting up there with
[27:14.880 --> 27:22.840]  his surrogates hyping racial division, economic class warfare. You've got all these multinational
[27:22.840 --> 27:30.080]  foreign countries that own our debt like China built on the backs of hundreds of millions
[27:30.080 --> 27:43.040]  of slaves. And then stop Trump movement gets boost from Mexico's efforts in U.S. And then
[27:43.040 --> 27:47.040]  they just report it like it's no big deal. Oh, Mexico's mounting big efforts, spending
[27:47.040 --> 27:51.880]  a lot of money to tell folks when they go to the U.S., don't get a driver's license,
[27:51.880 --> 27:55.360]  go ahead and vote. See, they spend this like they're trying to do it legally. Well, we
[27:55.360 --> 28:02.200]  have the details actually in an occurred memo article on infowars.com that actually decipher
[28:02.200 --> 28:08.440]  this BS. Mexico attempting to subvert U.S. presidential election. That's right. Foreign
[28:08.440 --> 28:14.440]  power tries to take over America. And people say, oh, Mexico can't do that. Mexico is teamed
[28:14.440 --> 28:20.320]  up with the globalist to merge us into an NAU, North American Union integration by stealth.
[28:20.320 --> 28:28.320]  That's in the declassified Banff Canada, North American Union summit meeting 2007. And then
[28:28.320 --> 28:35.400]  what comes next? I remember reading the Washington Post 10 years ago where they had top generals
[28:35.400 --> 28:40.520]  being quoted saying, we're working with Canada and Mexico to put troops inside the U.S. to
[28:40.520 --> 28:45.120]  deal with insurrection and domestic terrorists. We believe the new threat will be patriot groups
[28:45.120 --> 28:50.240]  in the future. And then we get the Mayak reports and others where they say the military's
[28:50.240 --> 28:55.800]  main mission in Northcom is battling veterans, gun owners, Christians and conservatives.
[28:55.800 --> 29:00.280]  It's because the globalists are going to start a civil war. We're going to be forced to defend
[29:00.280 --> 29:04.880]  the Republic because we're not traders. And they're going to announce that we're the enemy
[29:04.880 --> 29:11.760]  and literally try to put us in reeducation camps. That's the army's name for it. Reeducation
[29:11.760 --> 29:19.600]  camp. Just type in army manual talks about reeducation camp. They use the Soviet term.
[29:19.600 --> 29:27.880]  They say reeducation camp. They are hiding it in plain view. Traders inside conditioning
[29:27.880 --> 29:34.040]  us to accept foreign rule, foreign troops, oppression and being arrested for your speech.
[29:34.040 --> 29:39.600]  And saying Trump deserves to die for saying milk toast stuff. Here's the article. Vote
[29:39.600 --> 29:44.680]  all you want. The secret government won't change. Boston Globe. We'll be back. Ladies
[29:44.680 --> 29:49.000]  and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, a ton of clips straight ahead.
[29:49.000 --> 30:00.280]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.280 --> 30:03.800]  Google wanted to overthrow Syrian President Assad, which would have allowed ISIS to gain
[30:03.800 --> 30:09.000]  complete control over Syria. You heard that right. Google in 2012 wanted to help the so-called
[30:09.000 --> 30:13.280]  Syrian rebels overthrow Assad, according to State Department emails recently released.
[30:13.280 --> 30:18.240]  In July 2012, Jared Cohen, the head of the companies Google's ideas division, wrote
[30:18.240 --> 30:21.960]  an email to several top glint officials and said, quote, please keep close hold. But my
[30:21.960 --> 30:25.720]  team is planning to launch a tool that would publicly track and map the defections in Syria
[30:25.720 --> 30:29.160]  and which parts of the government they are coming from. Cohen added, quote, given how
[30:29.160 --> 30:33.160]  hard it is to get information in Syria right now, we are partnering with Al Jazeera, who
[30:33.160 --> 30:37.280]  will then take primary ownership over the tool we have built, track the data, verify
[30:37.280 --> 30:41.680]  it and broadcast it back into Syria. But it's well known that virtually all the insurgents
[30:41.680 --> 30:45.200]  in Syria are either ISIS or have close ties to the Islamic State.
[30:45.200 --> 30:49.560]  And here's another thing. Al Jazeera is state funded by Qatar, a country which once sought
[30:49.560 --> 30:53.320]  out of power because the Syrian president refused a proposed pipeline running through
[30:53.320 --> 30:58.280]  Syria, which would benefit Qatar. For more geopolitical news, visit infowars.com. This
[30:58.280 --> 31:05.120]  is Kit Daniels reporting. Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our
[31:05.120 --> 31:11.040]  ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize
[31:11.040 --> 31:17.320]  and prepare a defense. Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled
[31:17.320 --> 31:23.400]  with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there
[31:23.400 --> 31:28.880]  are silent weapons for quiet war. Pathanogens added to the food and water, and to the lining
[31:28.880 --> 31:34.400]  of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey

[33:18.080 --> 33:46.160]  Our government has been taken over. In 1913, a private foreign banking consortium
[33:46.160 --> 33:56.640]  got three laws passed, two of them amendments. Of course, both really didn't pass. They
[33:56.640 --> 34:03.280]  ramrodded them through to the historical record. A law that never was written by Red Beckman.
[34:03.280 --> 34:12.720]  He traveled to all the states that existed in 1913. Forty-something of them. There it
[34:12.720 --> 34:24.840]  all was, the proof. They were ten states short. It was in the records the states hadn't
[34:24.840 --> 34:32.360]  ratified, but it didn't matter. We got the private federal reserve, we got the income
[34:32.360 --> 34:40.280]  tax, and we got the 17th amendment to take the senators from the states to make them
[34:40.280 --> 34:50.400]  popularly elected, not voted for and appointed by the legislature. Then in 1921, British
[34:50.400 --> 34:57.920]  intelligence activates their plan to retake the United States. Pratt House is established,
[34:57.920 --> 35:05.720]  Council on Fine Relations, New York City, Hollywood is given masks of British intelligence
[35:05.720 --> 35:15.920]  funding. Suddenly all the heroes on the movies are British swashbucklers and heroes. France
[35:15.920 --> 35:26.240]  is the enemy. Patriots are the enemy. Suddenly the Queen of England reviled in this nation
[35:26.240 --> 35:31.160]  is on coffee cups and tea mugs everywhere. It's in the women's and ladies' magazines
[35:31.160 --> 35:44.800]  how great the royal family is. And look what we've turned into today. It just gets worse
[35:44.800 --> 35:52.640]  and worse. Cecil Rhodes' plan launched in 1900 to take the British Empire underground
[35:52.640 --> 35:59.120]  with a corporate system worldwide of shadow governments, secret assassination teams, and
[35:59.120 --> 36:10.960]  narcotics trafficking as well as white slavery. And now it's all here. A world government
[36:10.960 --> 36:21.240]  built around enslavement. And America has been brought to the cemetery gates. They want
[36:21.240 --> 36:26.760]  to put us six feet under and complete the world government. But only after our blood's
[36:26.760 --> 36:35.160]  been sucked out of us to feed the beast. That beast is now standing on its two feet. No
[36:35.160 --> 36:44.880]  longer is it in a crib. It's hungry. It's coming. The battle is now just beginning.
[36:44.880 --> 36:52.240]  All right, let's go ahead and get right into this because when you look at an issue like
[36:52.240 --> 36:59.200]  Obama going to Cuba and meeting with Fidel Castro, the dictator, his brothers, the current
[36:59.200 --> 37:04.880]  dictator, they passed power hereditarily just like North Korea. It's royalty. But they
[37:04.880 --> 37:12.520]  have lots of red flags and crumbling houses and so everything's okay like North Korea.
[37:12.520 --> 37:18.880]  And now they're announcing, oh, the big corporations are going to come in with a monopoly deal
[37:18.880 --> 37:25.480]  and horrible low wages. And they're going to force the agrarian and fishermen of Cuba.
[37:25.480 --> 37:32.520]  This is all being announced to go work in the casinos and the hotels. And they're going
[37:32.520 --> 37:39.920]  to put restrictions in on fishing and farming and make you go to the cities and be a slave
[37:39.920 --> 37:50.320]  at factories. And then the generals and Raul and everybody will be billionaires just like
[37:50.320 --> 37:57.520]  the China one-party model. In fact, I would imagine Cuba will probably start selling organs.
[37:57.520 --> 38:10.640]  And I'm not kidding. This is a formula. And it's sick. I can walk into a grocery store
[38:10.640 --> 38:19.320]  in Mexico. I've done it. And by pancake mix. And I don't need to be able to read Spanish.
[38:19.320 --> 38:23.040]  I could see the three lines on the back and figure out it says milk and eggs. Just add
[38:23.040 --> 38:28.760]  that shake and bake. It's a formula. And I can look at Cuba. I can look at the Arab
[38:28.760 --> 38:35.240]  Spring. I can look at Syria. I can look at Ukraine. And I know who's behind it. And then
[38:35.240 --> 38:44.040]  it's in the news who's behind it. Google didn't put an Arab Spring in of real reformers and
[38:44.040 --> 38:52.080]  real liberals. No, no. They knew that was coming and was popular. So they overthrew the governments
[38:52.080 --> 38:58.800]  and put Saudi Arabian jihadists in because that's what they want. They want oppression
[38:58.800 --> 39:04.320]  and they want strong men and they want fugs to run the show. And but they sit up there
[39:04.320 --> 39:09.200]  and get all the liberal donor groups to give them money to bring freedom to the women of
[39:09.200 --> 39:22.360]  the Middle East. Think about how arrogant and out of control these people are. The CIA
[39:22.360 --> 39:29.360]  in more than 80 countries since its inception in 1947, look this up, has a preference to
[39:29.360 --> 39:37.080]  install Dick Chaitours. Oligarchies are even more preferable because you may have 10 or
[39:37.080 --> 39:43.680]  15 guys in a bureau that actually run things and have puppet presidents. That's even harder
[39:43.680 --> 39:54.560]  for the public to figure out. Hugo Chavez completely sold Venezuela out and built himself and
[39:54.560 --> 40:01.920]  his family, everybody else, huge Swiss palaces. And if you read the Davos forum from two years
[40:01.920 --> 40:09.760]  ago, they bragged that no one pays better international debts than communists. And you've
[40:09.760 --> 40:16.280]  only got to work with the leadership. You buy them off. They act like they're fighting
[40:16.280 --> 40:22.560]  the West. The West acts like they're fighting them. Those big multinationals come in. There's
[40:22.560 --> 40:30.360]  no unions. There's no environmental laws. There's no regulations. There's no safety net.
[40:30.360 --> 40:39.160]  You cut your arm off in a factory. You don't get anything. And if you complain, your wife
[40:39.160 --> 40:46.000]  gets fired from the state run bakery and then your kids get beat up in the school. You want
[40:46.000 --> 40:51.600]  somebody telling you what to eat, where to go, what you can say. You want to be a slave.
[40:51.600 --> 40:57.240]  You want to live in Bernie's big fat stinking plantation with a bunch of pseudo intellectual
[40:57.240 --> 41:05.000]  lazy hateful scum telling you how to run your life. You're a woman who wants to be in the
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.480]  theater. You ready to get down your hands and knees of the party officials, no matter
[41:09.480 --> 41:20.720]  how talented you are. You want to live a totally humiliated life with no choices. I look at
[41:20.720 --> 41:28.760]  these spoiled, rotten, stupid, moronic, unhistorical people running around demanding they get something
[41:28.760 --> 41:37.320]  free as if the mega banks want to give you anything free. You stupid, lazy, arrogant,
[41:37.320 --> 41:47.720]  dense fools. And the very same people that run censorship and organ harvesting are organ
[41:47.720 --> 41:57.600]  harvesting our babies here. And they are saying Donald Trump is Hitler. Donald Trump can't
[41:57.600 --> 42:05.840]  go to heaven. Donald Trump's so horrible and all the fad driven lottery ticket mentality
[42:05.840 --> 42:13.640]  people, they get up and they go, yeah, yeah. And they wave communist flags in front of
[42:13.640 --> 42:18.440]  Trump Tower cussing at families as they go in saying the revolution's coming. We're
[42:18.440 --> 42:23.040]  going to kill all of you. We're going to shoot you. We're going to murder you. And it came
[42:23.040 --> 42:31.960]  out in court with the weathermen that they would sit around just with top PhDs talking
[42:31.960 --> 42:36.840]  about how they were going to put 50 million Americans in forced labor camps and kill half
[42:36.840 --> 42:42.520]  of us and just getting off on it. And then I've been around Democrats and other professors
[42:42.520 --> 42:47.240]  who I had no idea were communists who've come here before and they've uncloaked in front
[42:47.240 --> 42:51.600]  of me and said, we're going to murder and kill everybody. You better join us and look
[42:51.600 --> 43:00.800]  at all psychopathic. These are cults of filth, dangerous, evil people. They want to rape
[43:00.800 --> 43:06.840]  your wife. They want to stop your guts out the forced labor camp. That's what they do.
[43:06.840 --> 43:12.200]  They want to hurt you. They want to dominate you. They don't want to grow fields of food.
[43:12.200 --> 43:17.200]  They don't want to fix cars. They don't want to build houses. They don't want to build
[43:17.200 --> 43:21.680]  swimming pools. They don't want to send their kids to a good college. They hate everyone
[43:21.680 --> 43:26.960]  that's more successful than them. They hate good looking families. They hate people who
[43:26.960 --> 43:33.300]  are informed. They hate people who are strong. They hate you because they're fallen, evil
[43:33.300 --> 43:40.600]  sacks of crap. You understand that? And they're coming for us and we better get that through
[43:40.600 --> 43:46.800]  our heads. Let me tell you, most of these bug-eyed maggots know exactly what they're
[43:46.800 --> 43:54.320]  doing. I've had all over this country, from New York to Austin to Denver to Los Angeles,
[43:54.320 --> 43:59.280]  California. Anarchists come up to me who are really communist. Everything's alive with
[43:59.280 --> 44:07.720]  them and punched me in the back and wait for me to attack them. And I'll say, you guys
[44:07.720 --> 44:11.880]  are communists. You're undercalling yourself anarchist and you're funded by big foundations
[44:11.880 --> 44:18.440]  and they'll go, of course we are. You filth. And when you control, you're dead. And you
[44:18.440 --> 44:22.240]  look at them. They're just weak little groups of scum that think killing good people is
[44:22.240 --> 44:29.520]  powerful. Let me tell you something, filth. You actually start a civil war. The patriots
[44:29.520 --> 44:38.440]  are going to mop the floor with you. You're pathetic. You come from bad families and evil
[44:38.440 --> 44:46.120]  people. I guarantee your entire family line is a bunch of scum. I'm so sick of you people.
[44:46.120 --> 44:53.600]  You dishonorable, cowardly pieces of garbage. Excuse me. I just can't. I just can't get
[44:53.600 --> 45:02.880]  around these people anymore. I just can't even think about them anymore. And the brainwashed
[45:02.880 --> 45:08.280]  bots of the state. I mean, look at this photo. China hides millions of layoffs, jails, miners,
[45:08.280 --> 45:13.280]  protesting, unpaid wages. And it shows the face of the military guard out front, the
[45:13.280 --> 45:21.040]  Mao image. They're at the Forbidden City. And you look at the power trip these guys
[45:21.040 --> 45:25.400]  are in. Remember, they're dragging political dissonance away by the throat to be putting
[45:25.400 --> 45:33.360]  suicide vans, suicide vans, execution vans. I remember I first saw people about 15 years
[45:33.360 --> 45:36.440]  ago about mobile execution vans before it was in the news. People didn't believe me.
[45:36.440 --> 45:45.720]  And then once it was in the news, they said big deal. See, these are people who aren't
[45:45.720 --> 45:50.080]  strong in and of themselves and don't build anything. They just join with the state, show
[45:50.080 --> 45:54.280]  how subservient and sycophantic they are. They create a cult of evil. Then they run
[45:54.280 --> 46:02.320]  around like vampires, feeding on the literal organs and tissue of humanity, shelling it.
[46:02.320 --> 46:11.680]  And that's what we've reduced ourselves down to. That's what this nation and this world
[46:11.680 --> 46:20.440]  is falling into because there is no standards. We won't stick up for each other. And then
[46:20.440 --> 46:24.360]  Donald Trump just says, we have to control our borders. Terrorists are coming across.
[46:24.360 --> 46:28.200]  People are coming across. They're getting all this free welfare. We're collapsing and
[46:28.200 --> 46:31.440]  people act like it's the end of the world. Let's play this short clip out of a larger
[46:31.440 --> 46:37.200]  report Leigh Ann McAdoo did with the folks on the street in Austin, the double standard.
[46:37.200 --> 46:43.920]  If this was a white person saying what this black guy is saying, it would be called racist.
[46:43.920 --> 46:47.560]  All parties need to stop throwing the race card out there and let's figure out what the
[46:47.560 --> 46:56.400]  hell we need to control because we know, you know what I'm saying, most terrorists come
[46:56.400 --> 47:00.880]  from the Muslim culture, not saying most terrorists are Muslim, but they come from that, you know,
[47:00.880 --> 47:06.400]  that side of life. Most immigrants and, you know, a lot of crime does come from outside
[47:06.400 --> 47:11.400]  people that we can't control because they're in illegally, but let's worry about controlling
[47:11.400 --> 47:17.120]  that first. Let's do shut our borders down. But you sound racist right now. I don't sound
[47:17.120 --> 47:22.120]  racist. I don't feel like I sound racist because I just want, if you were white, though, like
[47:22.120 --> 47:26.960]  they would be very racist. I agree. You know what I'm saying? I definitely agree because
[47:26.960 --> 47:31.800]  it seems like the tables are kind of flipping around now that, you know, my culture as as
[47:31.800 --> 47:36.840]  African Americans, we're able to say certain things. And then when Caucasians say the same
[47:36.840 --> 47:41.920]  thing, we kind of, you know, we kind of take it out of proportion.
[47:41.920 --> 47:45.200]  Powerful piece. But then she also interviewed a bunch of folks. It was just like F Trump.
[47:45.200 --> 47:49.720]  I want to kill him. I want to beat him up. I want him dead. Black, white didn't matter.
[47:49.720 --> 47:54.600]  We didn't have any facts. It just felt good to say, yeah, he's bad. We're all part of
[47:54.600 --> 48:02.760]  a club hating him. And so just like in Cuba, they censor everybody in jail, political dissidents
[48:02.760 --> 48:10.520]  in China. Mark Zuckerberg has gone to China to meet with the leader of the Chinese propaganda
[48:10.520 --> 48:15.600]  bureau. He met with the head of their internet censorship group last year and is implementing
[48:15.600 --> 48:21.840]  many of those systems. I put out a video this weekend that had 24,000 views during the live
[48:21.840 --> 48:27.400]  stream. They wouldn't let us put a name on it and delisted it. A normal Facebook mentions
[48:27.400 --> 48:32.440]  would have about 300,000 views like that. It had 25,000 views. They just blocked it.
[48:32.440 --> 48:37.480]  They just didn't let it go out. And that's the type of stuff that you'll that I was pointing
[48:37.480 --> 48:42.360]  out that Obama Soros are trying to launch a race war was the name of the video. And they
[48:42.360 --> 48:50.320]  wouldn't let it go out when Navy SEAL groups put out memes about Benghazi just pointing
[48:50.320 --> 48:56.480]  out what Hillary did. They wouldn't let that information get out. And when they're trying
[48:56.480 --> 49:00.280]  to do that, folks, that means you're only a few minutes from midnight of everything being
[49:00.280 --> 49:06.440]  shut down. And that's what we're trying to do is bully the Trump people. Report secret
[49:06.440 --> 49:12.120]  service Trump campaign increasing security at the threats to family and violent protests.
[49:12.120 --> 49:16.200]  You have counter assault assets. You have counter sniper assets. That says to me that this is
[49:16.200 --> 49:24.040]  a grave threat. NBC News. It's up on info wars.com. Majority of Americans say they'd like to punch
[49:24.040 --> 49:28.560]  Trump full in the face. That's up on info wars.com. Steve Watson article, 54% of national
[49:28.560 --> 49:33.840]  poll to Sean cop. We're going to play some of this when we come back anti Trump protesters.
[49:33.840 --> 49:41.480]  Most hateful people I've ever seen. Soros board member chairs firm running online voting
[49:41.480 --> 49:46.240]  for Tuesday's Utah caucus. What's wrong with that old Soros involved in your body? He's
[49:46.240 --> 49:53.160]  a good guy, right? He's a good, good old person chairs a lot about you. You won't believe
[49:53.160 --> 49:57.920]  what a liberal protesters just did to an energy of Donald Trump hung it burned it. And it's
[49:57.920 --> 50:04.520]  just how dumb these people are. And they just act like they're so cool. They're so tough.
[50:04.520 --> 50:09.600]  I mean, these are the most pathetic, dumb people who you know, don't have jobs, don't
[50:09.600 --> 50:13.760]  know how to tie their shoelaces, don't know how to wipe their noses. They just know how
[50:13.760 --> 50:21.400]  to go act tough and beat up a pinata. That's how they're going to get more free goodies
[50:21.400 --> 50:30.680]  is if you kill Donald Trump because it's so fashionable to hate a white guy, isn't it?
[50:30.680 --> 50:36.480]  It's so fashionable to just be part of this idiot moron culture. I mean, look at these
[50:36.480 --> 50:42.000]  liberal trendies in the video. They look like bows of the clown, all of them. They all look
[50:42.000 --> 50:47.560]  dumber than my dog. They just have that stupid look in their eye. I just cannot tell you
[50:47.560 --> 50:51.800]  that's why MSNBC always talks about how smart liberals are and how dumb conservatives are.
[50:51.800 --> 50:57.480]  It's because mainline liberals are the most trendy, vapid, empty, stupid people in the
[50:57.480 --> 51:00.400]  world. That's the big secret.
[51:00.400 --> 51:06.280]  You know about RVs. You've heard about bunkers, but surviving is not recreation. And men

[51:59.520 --> 52:05.120]  Hi, my name is Nick Lupo. One World Way has been by far the best protein that I've ever
[52:05.120 --> 52:09.360]  had. I take it three times a day, once in the morning as soon as I wake, once for a
[52:09.360 --> 52:13.840]  pre-workout snack and once for a post-workout recovery drink. It has helped me transform
[52:13.840 --> 52:18.440]  and sculpt my body into what I have now. I began taking the product about two years ago
[52:18.440 --> 52:22.640]  and boy, let me tell you, I'm in the best shape of my life. I have seen major muscle
[52:22.640 --> 52:27.360]  mass gains and have 0% body fat. I have had people in my gym ask if I compete in body
[52:27.360 --> 52:31.280]  building because of how lean and muscular I am. I used to suffer from everyday ache
[52:31.280 --> 52:36.000]  and pains from hard manual labor my whole life and arthritis that was to my family.
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.720]  But One World Way has helped me take that everyday pain from a 10 to a 3. Some days
[52:40.720 --> 52:44.560]  I feel no pain at all. It's just full of life and energy. It has also helped my skin
[52:44.560 --> 52:49.200]  look younger and healthier. Thank you, synergistic nutrition for One World Way.

[54:40.720 --> 54:53.040]  tournaments begun. The purple pipe up places tune, the choir softly sing. Three lullabies in
[54:53.040 --> 55:02.560]  an ancient tongue for the court of the crimson. Think about these headlines. Obama embraces Sadelle
[55:02.560 --> 55:11.040]  Castro in historic meeting. Not a word about the political dissidents, the executions, the torture.
[55:11.040 --> 55:16.400]  Zuckerberg meets with the communist Chinese leadership to help censor the internet.
[55:18.640 --> 55:25.680]  Stop Trump movement gets boost from Mexico's efforts in the U.S., Mexico getting illegals
[55:25.680 --> 55:30.560]  to go get driver's license and vote, and mainstream media doesn't call it subversion
[55:30.560 --> 55:36.720]  by a foreign power or treason with the administration working with them. No, it's a good thing.
[55:36.720 --> 55:44.880]  Thank God it helps here the cavalry to stop that evil real estate builder and jobs creator,
[55:44.880 --> 55:54.080]  Donald Trump. Oh, we're so lucky the communist Chinese, the greatest murderers in history are
[55:54.080 --> 56:02.080]  against him. And so is Vicente Fox. Oh, oh, we're so lucky. And the Wall Street Journal says
[56:02.080 --> 56:08.080]  People's Daily Chief warns of historic mistake if China loses grip on new media. So there's articles

[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.760]  Live from the infowarsteam.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:42.000]  Bill Gilbert, the filmmaker, gonna be joining us to talk Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and more of
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.720]  about 30 Minutes. Then joining us from DC is David Knight who's going to be covering the anti-Trump
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:55.040]  events and more there as he travels on to New York and other areas like Trump Tower to document
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:02.320]  what is unfolding. We're going to be deploying Joe Biggs out as well on the road and Richard
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.120]  Reeves because this is a big deal, this attempt to crush free speech. G. Edward Griffin, people
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.840]  have been really asking us to get him on. Always enjoy having G. Edward Griffin on. Author of
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.480]  creation from Jack Earl Island to talk about shadow government, world government and more.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:21.120]  He will be joining us and then Paul Joseph Watson will be haunt showing the fourth hour.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.960]  What's happening is the establishment's gone from denying they're establishing a world government
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:36.720]  but they're just admitting. There's no criticism of Cuba, there's no criticism of China
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.560]  and then China comes around lecturing us on what movies Hollywood can put out and what
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.480]  books can be published, openly threatening U.S. companies, buying large shares of them
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:56.160]  and in our criminal elite are more than happy to have this go on because this is the muscle they
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.680]  need. Mexico, China, all these other countries ganging up. There's only one country that's powerful
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:07.280]  that isn't ganging up on America and isn't involved in our domestic affairs
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:13.680]  and of course it's the country that has NATO trying to start a war with it and that is Russia.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.640]  Just thought you might want to notice that.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.400]  Truly sickening, the very same oligarchs that had taken over Russia and used communism as a
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:31.920]  management program are now doing the same thing here. They want an October revolution,
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:43.200]  they want a red terror, they want a Bolshevik filthbath run by big mega banks as usual.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.480]  It's exact same crud, exact same groups, exact same just will to total takeover
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:59.920]  and they're doing it here with class envy and they will get rid of something bad and bring
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:07.680]  in something 50 times worse. We're going to talk to Joe Gilbert when we come back but this is such
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:18.960]  a big deal. It's amazing to see just how they've lowered us, how they've trained us to put up
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.560]  with anything. I forget, somebody sent me a clip on YouTube of it like six, seven years ago,
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.560]  I didn't actually watch it. What's the series on HBO where the pimps are running the prostitutes
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:38.800]  and it shows this woman who's been run over by a car, beat up by him, cigarette burns on her and
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.720]  she's at the hospital and the pimp comes in front of the mother because he's so arrogant
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:49.200]  and he's like baby I'm sorry I'm gonna get back on the street, I'm gonna get back on the street,
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.600]  I'm sorry I'm not working hard, he goes that's right, that's right you're in trouble and the
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.920]  mother's like what have you done to my little girl, my little baby, he's like shut up lady.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.920]  The film crew is talking to him and like well what do you pay her, I don't pay her nothing,
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:12.320]  she's lucky if I get her a bucket of chicken. The woman's just groveling and that's the
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:18.960]  American people, just oh yes, oh we're sorry Pope, we're sorry Communist Chinese, we're sorry
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:24.240]  Vicente Fox, we're sorry to the current president, we're sorry to George Soros the Nazi collaborator,
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:31.680]  calling Trump a Nazi, oh we're so sorry, let us bow down to you, let us do whatever you say,
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:37.200]  you only knocked our teeth out, put cigarettes out on us, ran over us with a car, let 50 men a
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:43.520]  day basically rape us, it's okay, thank you, I'm sorry we only take 10,000 Chinese women a week
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:47.280]  to have their babies free and China doesn't let us have one person over to have a baby free,
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.200]  you're right, we deserve it because we're Christians, that's what it comes down to,
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.000]  even we're not Christian in practice anymore, we have this Christian guilt and we just love
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  being run over by criminals, that's not Christian. Today is Monday, March 21st and here are some
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.200]  of the top stories. The electronic voting firm that's counting two states Utah GOP election results
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:12.160]  is headed by George Soros Insider, the chairman of the smartmatic group is Lord Mark Malick Brown,
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:17.200]  who's also on the board of Soros's Open Society Foundation and has close ties to the socialist
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:21.760]  billionaire. Soros, who has given over 13 million to Hillary Clinton for the election, formally
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:25.680]  warned Donald Trump that there will be quote consequences for his campaign to secure the
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:30.400]  US border. In similar news, Mexico is pressuring its permanent residents in the US to become
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:35.040]  citizens, a status that would enable them to vote, presumably against Trump if the Mexican
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.600]  government gets its way. Officially, Mexico claims it respects US sovereignty and has no
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.760]  strategy to influence the results of the presidential race, yet Mexican diplomats are
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:48.400]  hosting free workshops to assist immigrants in gaining US citizenship. And remember back in
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.280]  2014 when radio host Glenn Beck was giving out free gifts to the legal surgeon across the border?
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.920]  Well, it turns out that Ted Cruz was also helping him. For more news, visit infowars.com,
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:04.000]  this is Kit Daniels reporting. Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.840]  and experienced it for themselves. I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months,
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:15.920]  needed to get my digestive system working correctly again, so I stumbled on the X2.

[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:05.200]  Brainforce, it's completely different. Try a bottle of it. Rob Dew joins us. You worked,
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.000]  I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what Brainforce did. I'd been working all day. I took a couple
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.760]  hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.360]  didn't feel like I was going to make it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:23.280]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there. I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later,
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:28.960]  it's like everything just kind of clears up. It's got four and a half stars. People really love it.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:33.440]  Read about it. Find out why. Third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:39.120]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:42.880]  pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:48.240]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brainforce
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:54.640]  and came in. You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:08:06.480]  call 888-253-3139. The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents The Alex Jones Show
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:14.320]  because there's a war on for your mind. Joe Gilbert is with us until about 40 after,
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:20.960]  then David Knight joins us from DC at the Communist slash Black Lives Matter, George Soros,
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:26.800]  anti-Trump extravagantices that are ongoing. Joe Gilbert is an amazing filmmaker. We carry
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:32.000]  both of his award-winning films, No Place Like Utopia and Dreams of My Real Father at infowarsstore.com.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.280]  I should add that. He's a Ted Cruz supporter. I'm a Donald Trump supporter. I get that Ted Cruz has
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:41.440]  been more of a purist than his votes in the Senate, but I have my concerns, like when he piles on and
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:47.920]  says it's Donald Trump's fault, his rhetoric is causing these attacks. No, we've been there,
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:54.160]  we've covered it, we've seen it. Donald Trump is not the one doing this. It is the horrible,
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:02.240]  anti-free market, Bill Ayers-led trash that he's an expert on, Mr. Gilbert is, that's out there
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:10.480]  leading all of this. And it is just the most racist, anti-white, anti-free market, liberation
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:15.200]  theology I've ever seen. This is directly out of the Ford Foundation, directly out of the White House,
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:21.520]  and we have Stop Trump movement. It's boosts from Mexico efforts in U.S. to get illegals,
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:26.320]  they'll get driver's license and vote or, quote, become citizens. I mean, it is just incredible
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:31.440]  to see the foreign insurrection from the Pope, the Mexican government, the Chinese government,
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.320]  the British government, the French government, the Saudi government, and then look at this.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:41.600]  Four U.S. senators meet with Saudi King Salman ahead of Obama visit. They own part of Fox News,
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.080]  they're telling us what to do. They're criticizing Trump. Even though they didn't like Trump,
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:52.720]  I'd back him now because this is about America running its own affairs. No one would put up
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:57.280]  with foreign meddling like this. Where are our instincts? And then there's this Boston Globe
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:06.400]  article, vote all you want, the secret government won't change. The people we elect aren't the ones
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:11.200]  calling the shots, says Tufts University, Michael Glennon. And this guy's an advisor to Homeland
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.800]  Security Congress presidents. In fact, they say in the article, he's not a conspiracy theorist.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:25.040]  No. No, he's in, you know, all these administrations. And then it goes through the fact how we have
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:30.800]  been taken over and are basically run by foreign and corporate interests. They call it the National
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.440]  Security Double Government. Oh, do I get an award that I talked about this 20 plus years ago?
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:43.440]  But the truth is there were books written on it by experts in Congress in the 60s and 70s.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:48.800]  It's been a long march. And now they want to say, Communist Cuba is good. Communist China is good.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:53.280]  It's America that's bad. Isn't that liberal, selling political dissidents organs?
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:59.120]  Chinese generals tax exempt, making billions, suicide nets? Well, Apple's liberal. I mean,
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:07.760]  you know, their CEO wears trendy outfits. The average liberal controller is not a liberal.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:15.040]  Like a Thomas Jefferson, they are social engineers using class warfare to divide and conquer and
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.680]  to sucker the public into collectivism, because the elite can sit on top the collectivism,
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:24.400]  pop the collectivism, exempt themselves from the taxes and regulations and laws,
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.920]  but then suck up their corporate welfare, all the money and more importantly,
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:33.200]  shut down all their competition in a managed economy. Look at Apple and Google and everybody
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:38.320]  else saying they want to go build factories in Cuba. Of course, where you got people paid 30
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:44.560]  cents an hour. And you'll be under a communist general at the factory who flies around helicopters
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:49.280]  and then you live in a house with a caved in roof. Literally, almost all the houses there are
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:55.520]  caved in. And then they send social workers around of your houses caved in and take your kids and
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:01.760]  raise them in a government dormitory. That's the plan. China does that too. That's what the
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:07.360]  great migrations, great leap forwards, all that crud is about breaking down, taking hundreds of
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.720]  millions of farmers off their land with their happy and self-sufficient, putting them into
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:16.160]  giant communes where half of them starve to death and the kids that turn in their own parents,
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:21.200]  they become officers in the military and the police. This is the red terror. This is malice
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:26.000]  brigades. You know the model at the University of Texas and all over the country. We go out and do
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:33.040]  pro-life events. Mal brigades show up, pull up in brand new $100,000 sports cars, get out,
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:38.320]  attack us and the police do nothing because of our white privilege. Blacks, whites, Hispanics out
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:44.160]  there for little babies. They are the Legion of Doom. Now, I know I'm ranting. I want to go to our
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:48.400]  guests, but I've got some clips I want to play. I don't want to go over some argument about Ted
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:54.480]  Cruz and the rest of it, but I mean, how do you square this? You have a viral video that's titled
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.720]  Champion of the Constitution where you go over, the Constitution strikes back the crusades starring
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:11.760]  Ted Cruz. My issue is it's going to be Trump and Joel, I want to hear your issues with Trump and
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:17.440]  then I want to ask you this question. Why then did you think the armies of Mordor,
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.320]  the Saudis, the Chinese Communist, Cuba, everybody's saying you can't have Trump? I mean,
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:30.880]  if Trump was a sleeper cell of Hillary, they wouldn't all be doing this. I mean, they're pulling
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.120]  their hair out. They're pulling out the stops, Joel Gilbert.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:40.400]  There's no question we're at a crossroads where everything is on the line. We never
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:45.840]  should have gotten to this point where an election would determine the fate of the United States.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:51.040]  It's something that's been building up for years. We've had the radical left since the
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:58.160]  80s have taken over the Democrat Party, have penetrated the media, entertainment, universities,
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:04.320]  and we've gotten to the point where they snuck Barack Obama in as president on a populist,
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.560]  moderate agenda. He ran as a moderate. He's going to cut the deficit in half.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.960]  He's going to support Israel. Obamacare is not a tax. Everything was a lie,
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.840]  but it was based on a lesson that the radicals from the 60s, the SDS Weather Underground,
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.800]  they looked you in the eye. They looked America in the eye and said, we want to destroy this
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.440]  country. We want to replace the Constitution with a communist manifesto. We want to put 50
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:32.160]  million people in reeducation centers and we want to divide the country between the Chinese,
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:40.320]  the North Vietnamese, the Russians, and the North Koreans. They went to jail for bombing
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:45.520]  government buildings. They went to jail for murdering policemen and they failed miserably
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.520]  because it was evil. When they came out of the underground in the early 80s, they all went to
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.680]  Chicago, entered educational institutions, and they taught people like Barack Obama
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:59.120]  the lesson they learned. The lesson was, don't reveal your true agenda. Look people in the
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:05.680]  eye and tell them you want to help them. Use their discontent to take power. Once you take power,
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.840]  you'll simply implement the original agenda. That's the playbook that Obama followed.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:16.720]  As I chronicled in Dreams of My Real Father, Obama is a red diaper baby. He's the child of
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:23.360]  a Communist Party USA member, Frank Marshall Davis. He surrounded himself with other communist
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:29.280]  red diaper babies, David Axelrod, both his parents Communist Party members, Valerie Jarrett, parents
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.960]  were Communist Party members. Her father-in-law was a colleague of Obama's father, Frank Marshall
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:41.360]  Davis, on the Communist newspapers in Chicago. This is playing out very poorly. We see the
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:48.720]  symbolism of Obama today standing in front of the mural of Che Guevara, the killer representing
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:58.480]  the United States. Certainly at a crossroads, Donald Trump has captured the initial energy
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:04.240]  that Ted Cruz did work on for several years in the Senate as an anti-establishment politician.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:13.600]  Trump, I'd say, co-opted and expanded upon this feeling and mission. You see both those
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:18.640]  candidates have captured about 80% of the vote, and I think we're headed for a very interesting
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.120]  convention in July, and I certainly hope one of those two will emerge.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.800]  Well, I respect your view. You're a very informed person, so I really want to know your view,
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.760]  your issues with Trump. I mean, now you've been for Cruz because he's more of a purist,
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.720]  at least on the surface, and I have my own issues with Trump. But they got dossiers on him,
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.680]  and I've talked to Dr. Corsi who's known him for 40 years and friends with him.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:47.120]  Yeah. A lot of other people behind the scenes, but not just Roger Stone, and they say, look,
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:50.960]  he knows more than you do, Alex. He knew about this before you were even around.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:56.240]  He's a patriot sleeper cell. We're not going to get into it, but don't worry. And then I've
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:01.520]  personally, I'm not going to get into his immediate run with it, but Trump has personally,
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:08.000]  you know, off record said, look, just wait, I know what's going on. And so he's either the greatest
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.240]  manipulator in history, or he's for real. And I legitimately look at the establishment running
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:19.280]  around like chickens with their heads cut off. They know something about him that scares them.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:24.560]  They're not just putting all this act on to make populist elect him in some shill operation. I mean,
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.840]  I at a gut level, this is real. What's happening? Or disagree with me if you think so.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:40.720]  Well, I'll compare the appeal or concerns over Cruz versus Trump with Cruz. His followers have
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:46.160]  seen him operate on the political scene for several years. And we've seen him stand up again
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:52.720]  and again, and not change who he is. And we understand his core principles based on his
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:57.760]  family background based on his constitutional DNA. He memorized the Constitution when he was in
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:03.040]  high school, and has always been a fighter for the Constitution. The concern over Trump with
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:08.720]  most conservatives is looking at his history of support for Hillary Clinton, support for liberal
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:14.400]  causes. We think it's great that, and we think everyone, including Hillary Clinton, should come
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:20.400]  and say conservative messages, just like Barack Obama did in 2008. He said, I'm going to cut the
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:26.320]  deficit in half. It's great to hear conservative messages from anyone. But the concern is once
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:31.200]  they take power, did they simply use that conservative rhetoric and they go back to their
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:38.400]  original DNA? So the concern over Trump is his long history as a deal maker with liberals.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:45.280]  And certainly, he has catastrophic polling numbers with women and minorities that might
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:51.440]  make it very hard for him to win in the general election. So the concern is, if we know we have
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.040]  someone who's a conservative fighter who can unite, I'm talking about Cruz now, but-
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:58.480]  Sure, and he's polling very well compared to other Republicans with black Americans or even
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:02.800]  a lot of Hispanic Americans. They got Gallup polls where 70% of Hispanics that are citizens
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:06.400]  don't want the borders up, but they're not suicidal. I mean, there's a lot of demographics
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:09.680]  that show he'd actually be a landslide winner. I've seen the other demographics claiming,
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:13.040]  well, he's not doing well with millennials. So, I mean, who knows?
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:20.960]  Yeah. Well, those are the basic concerns people have, and I have with Trump. Will he take office
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:28.320]  and be a deal maker and go back to some of his liberal DNA? Will he even be able to beat the
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:36.720]  Democrat? So Cruz has just been someone who's been so tried and true and dedicated and steadfast.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:41.520]  That's why we think Cruz is the better choice at this point, but Cruz himself would support Trump,
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:47.840]  and I would too. Sure. Well, I mean, I know this is such an exciting town to be alive,
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.080]  and we're all got front row seats to history. Hopefully we'll get off the bench, though,
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:55.920]  and get in the arena like Joe Gilbert and many others. Stay with us. We're going to come back
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:02.800]  and look at these leftist mobs. Hey, everyone, with 20 plus years as a radio host, I've seen
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:08.960]  about everything. One thing that keeps recurring, though, are these timeshare charlatans, these
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:14.560]  high pressure sales people who get folks to come out to some resort for a special weekend offer,
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:18.480]  then they get them in a corner and browbeat them and coerce them into buying a timeshare.
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.520]  They don't need, they don't want, and they can't afford. And then they're stuck with
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:26.240]  that thing forever, monthly payments, mortgage payments, annual fees that keep going up and up.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.600]  Well, up until recently, people thought they couldn't get rid of these things. You know,
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:33.040]  you can't get out of the contract. You can't get out of the deed or the membership. Well, that's
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:39.680]  not true. My friends at American Consumer Credit, a timeshare release company, can get you free.

[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:44.000]  You know in Paris, which has the toughest gun laws of the world, the world, no tougher gun laws than
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:52.720]  Paris, France, tough. Guess what? 130 people dead, no bullets were going in the opposite direction.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:25:00.160]  It was just boom, boom, boom. Same thing happened in California, 14 people, radicalized people.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:05.840]  She probably radicalized him. They went in and killed 14 people that they worked with,
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:11.280]  supposedly that they liked. It's not going to happen anymore, folks. It's not going to happen.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:17.040]  We're going to be smart. We're going to be vigilant. We're going to be the smart people.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:20.720]  We're going to know what we're doing. We're going to be proud of our country again.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:26.560]  It's the nationalism. It's saying a country can be sovereign to watch all these foreign
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.800]  governments, the Mexican government saying we're financing, getting illegals to get
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.840]  driver's license and vote involved in our election. It shows the disrespect everyone
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:42.080]  has for America. No other country would put up with this. Joel Gilbert, I think that's why they hate
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:49.120]  Trump so much, is that he is a populist. And I agree that it could be a bait and switch,
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:53.280]  but it's, you know, regardless, this is so historical. And then I don't mean to go off on
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:58.560]  a hateful jag about leftist, because I've always just been a libertarian. But I got to say,
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.920]  what they've bred at these universities that you've been around the country seeing,
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:09.600]  and what they've got in Europe are just free speech hating, evil authoritarian thugs who
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:14.960]  literally say we want your money. I mean, aren't these just pirates and they're not just useful
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:20.960]  idiots. They're such hateful people. You document this in your no place like Utopia.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:27.200]  Where do you see all this going? Why would the ruling class and the big foundations fund 50 years
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:34.480]  of creating such crap? I mean, I'm sorry, these are the most bug-eyed authoritarian,
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:41.920]  dangerous people I've ever seen. Yeah. And first of all, we saw Donald Trump in your clip,
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:47.920]  simply stating things that were considered quite normal in mainstream 30, 40 years ago,
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:53.440]  we're going to defend the country and defend ourselves. Now today, such rhetoric is somehow
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:27:00.160]  racist and far right and extremist. That's just an example of Donald Trump really being
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:07.280]  a mainstream normal person who's vilified as somehow being radical. Now the years and years
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:14.480]  we've had of the leftist penetration of every level of American society between government,
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:20.640]  journalism, entertainment, which I spoke about, this literally is the result. The intention
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:27.520]  was to polarize America because they felt if they polarized us that they would win because they have
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:34.080]  much more numbers of people who are not economically well off and they can convince
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.960]  them and trick them into believing that there's an evil straw man who's preventing them from
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:44.000]  being wealthy. Bernie Sanders' entire campaign, by the way, he's kind of an old communist. He
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.720]  didn't get the memo that you're supposed to lie about your agenda. So he simply says things like
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:54.160]  there's billionaires controlling the economy that are preventing you from being wealthy.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:59.920]  That's a lie. It's the government regulation and taxation which holds down the economy.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:07.680]  Sure, but it is select George Soros and other groups that are funding raising taxes to control
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:10.880]  the middle class and exempting themselves. That's the other part of the equation.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:18.080]  Right. The communist socialist society depends on wiping out the middle class and creating one
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:23.840]  big lower class with a select group of elites that control society, control the wealth.
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:29.360]  That ensures their long-term survival. The enemy of socialism is the middle class.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:35.120]  The church-going, hard-working middle-class Americans will never buy into this progressive
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:42.400]  nonsense about legalizing marijuana, freeing the criminals, empowering a group of elites
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:48.400]  and all those political correct nonsense. So from the get-go, Saul Alinsky, who acted Karl Marx, their
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:54.640]  ideology was to eliminate the middle class. Barack Obama, don't forget, he was and is a
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:00.000]  professional agitator. He had no interest in politics, and as you can see just from the
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.240]  microcosm of how many vacations he takes, he really doesn't have that much interest in being
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.640]  president. He's Obama. Bernie Sanders didn't have a job of paying jobs until he was 40.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:14.480]  Right. The presidency to Obama is simply a bully pulpit to agitate and divide the country,
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:20.080]  divide it along racial lines, along economic lines. Obama, I'm sure, will go back to being a
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:24.640]  professional agitator. That's what these guys do, and that's what he's been up to in office for eight
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:29.760]  years. Joel Gilbert, stay there when we come back. I want to play a few more clips and see where you
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:35.200]  think the controlled fascist left is going in the future, but also look at some of the quote
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:41.040]  problems in the right establishment as well. Then David Knight will join us from Washington, DC,
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:48.240]  the site of another anti-Trump, anti-free speech rally by subversive would be enslavers.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:55.840]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:03.600]  Google wanted to overthrow Syrian president Assad, which would have allowed ISIS to gain
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:08.800]  complete control over Syria. You heard that right. Google in 2012 wanted to help these so-called
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:12.880]  Syrian rebels overthrow Assad, according to State Department emails recently released.
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:18.080]  In July 2012, Jared Cohen, the head of the companies Google's ideas division, wrote an
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:22.160]  email to several top clean officials and said, quote, please keep close hold. But my team is
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:26.080]  planning to launch a tool that would publicly track and map the defections in Syria, which parts of
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:30.240]  the government they're coming from. Cohen added, quote, given how hard it is to get information
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.480]  to Syria right now, we are partnering with Al Jazeera, who will then take primary ownership
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:39.040]  over the tool we have built, track the data, verify it and broadcast it back into Syria.
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:43.040]  But it's well known that virtually all the insurgents in Syria are either ISIS or have
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:48.080]  close ties to Islamic State. And here's another thing. Al Jazeera is state funded by Qatar,
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:52.080]  a country which wants to sought out of power because the Syrian president refused a proposed
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:56.160]  pipeline running through Syria, which would benefit Qatar. For more geopolitical news,

[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:19.040]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:25.920]  If you go to infoworse.com, there's a new video out.
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:32.480]  Anti-Trump protestor who slapped police horse describes herself as a commie feminist. That's
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:40.240]  her words. And when you watch these videos, these people can hardly talk. And I got to say the most
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:44.800]  vicious evil ones are mainly white for some reason. They tend to be the leaders too. They're
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.600]  all condescending and come over to like minorities and go, I'm protecting you from the other white
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:55.040]  people. I mean, they are just the most condescending, arrogant people you could ever imagine.
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:00.560]  And look, I got big problems with the establishment right wing and some of the things they go along
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:05.680]  with. But the left is taking over the whole world right now. That's what the establishment's using,
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:08.480]  the crony capitalist. It's what the big foundations have funded.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:15.680]  They are coming after our freedoms big time right now. And so all hands on deck to fight
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:20.640]  these people. I mean, this is insane. Now, Joe Gilbert mentions the drug war.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:27.360]  I am for decriminalization because I understand it just makes a police state, puts young kids
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:32.320]  in prison, teaches them how to be criminals. But I don't want legalization because there's also
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.880]  another move to basically just turn everybody into drug addicts. So I don't like the drug culture.
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:41.360]  I don't like making it totally illegal because that puts too much money into it.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:45.120]  I don't like running to a police checkpoint, you know, searching for drugs or whatever.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:49.200]  You know, at the same time, I don't want drunk drivers, you know, driving around in both lanes
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:53.040]  of traffic. But I don't want to pull up to a checkpoint just be breathalyzed, you know,
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:59.760]  like it's Nazi Germany. So there's a balance there. But this is clearly an attempt to destabilize
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:06.160]  the country, overthrow it. I'm going to get Joe Gilbert's expert view on this and really destabilize
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:10.720]  things so much that they then bring in the Strong Cities Initiative of the Justice Department and
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:18.160]  the UN to bully local governments into submitting to their form of government or quote, everybody
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:26.640]  gets sued or fired. This is true bullying. This is true takeover. And I can't even believe it's
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:31.840]  happening this bad. What comes next? Joe Gilbert, what is their agenda? Are they beta testing
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:37.040]  a leftist overthrow and takeover? Or could they be getting ready to try it during this election?
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:40.480]  What do you think they're going to do at the RNC? We now know they're saying they're going to
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.840]  infiltrate delegates in and be on the inside. I've talked to Richard Reeves, who's a delegate in
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:51.360]  Texas. He was talking to top folks in San Antonio at their big event with the delegates and they
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:57.680]  said there were leftist operatives of Clinton in there who are becoming delegates and trying to
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:02.160]  sabotage and intimidate people and threatening people or the police have to be called. So
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:07.200]  I've never seen the Democrats activate to this level. It seems like they know this is their
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:13.280]  chance to really take over. Yeah, you have to be suspicious of everything the left is up to
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:18.240]  because these people have what I call a destructive passion. And their destructive passion is
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.960]  based on a fantasy. They look at the world differently from conservatives. We look at the
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:29.200]  world and say, wow, things are so problematic in the rest of the world in Cuba. They're all
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.880]  impoverished. We look at America and say America is the greatest place in the world to live.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:40.000]  Leftist look at America and compare it to a perfect utopia. And their conclusion is,
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.280]  it's not perfect. So we must destroy it and then rebuild a perfect utopian society.
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:49.680]  Never mind it. We'll have to murder millions of people along the way. That's why the woman who
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:53.600]  said no free speech in Chicago. She goes, listen, you don't have free speech because you're white
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:37:00.000]  unless you're here to dismantle your privilege. Exactly. And now you see the leftists allying
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.360]  themselves as they have for some years with the Islamists because Islamists and leftists
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.720]  have the same ultimate goal. They want to defeat Western economies, free market system,
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:17.200]  and freedoms because they view it as the ultimate target and obstacle to their taking power.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:20.960]  And that shows you how mentally ill they are. Merkel and Hollande run those countries,
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:25.440]  they're tax exempt, they get to screw everybody over, and they want to bring in 5 million radicals,
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:30.480]  jihadists, knowing a bunch of them are terrorists, and just to run around butchering the whole
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:36.880]  country. That just shows they have taken over. Why would you burn down your own castle? The
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:43.040]  Commies took over because it is a mental illness. I can't disagree with you on that. I call it a
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:48.560]  destructive passion. And they won't, even amongst the destruction, you know, you don't see Obama
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:54.880]  going to Cuba and looking around and saying, wow, these cars are all from the 1950s because socialism
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:00.640]  freezes everything in time. I visited the Soviet Union in the 80s. I visited Soviet
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:05.200]  Refuseniks who were trying to leave the country. And I remember I was in this old,
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:10.960]  dilapidated building with a wooden elevator and tiny rooms. And the people I visited said,
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:15.680]  well, you know, we got fired from our job. We're being arrested because we're not working.
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:20.960]  They raided our apartment. But thank God we live in a new building. And I said,
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:25.840]  what new building? This is from the 1920s. So literally the entire infrastructure,
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:31.520]  the technology stays frozen in time. So Obama flew over Havana and he saw the disaster of
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:35.200]  socialism. But instead of condemning it, of course, because he's one of them,
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:40.640]  he's busy praising Cuba and empowering them with this destructive passion.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:44.400]  And that's what the carbon tax is going to Africa two years ago and saying,
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:50.000]  you can't have cars or air conditioning as he walks off this jumbo jet with 20-something planes
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.280]  in tow with a red carpet eating filet mignon and caviar. That was what was on the menu that night.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:00.640]  Telling people you can't have a car or air conditioning. They want a permanent slave
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:05.600]  class. They know what they're doing. What do they call themselves? They call globalism their system.
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:10.400]  But they use communism as a management system they're exempt from. But what do they privately
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:16.160]  call themselves? Technocrats. They are the ones that run our lives. The true elite
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:21.760]  hate, discriminating against people, exempting themselves from what we're under. But with all
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:26.880]  this sophistic bull about unity and equality and all the rest of it.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:32.640]  Yeah, it's a complete fraud to control people. I'll give you one more example from my visit
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:38.080]  to the Soviet Union in the 80s. I went to a supermarket. It was a giant supermarket as big
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:43.520]  as Ralph's or Safeway. People were lined up around the corner. And when you go inside,
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:48.000]  there's no shelves. There's simply in one corner, there's a pile of fish on the floor.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.200]  There's a pile of bread in another corner and a pile of potatoes right in the middle.
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:57.440]  And people wait for hours to ration a few potatoes and a few pieces of bread.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:04.080]  Then I went down the street to something called the Biryoska. The Biryoska is a specialty store
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:09.040]  only for Communist Party and government officials or foreigners with foreign currency like myself
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:14.880]  in a U.S. passport. I walked into the Biryoska and it's like a modern day Safeway. Beautiful.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:21.040]  Every bit of food and every amenity you could possibly think of. So it's called what they
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:27.040]  call the new class. There's a class of elites who are socialists and communists that become
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:31.920]  the new class and the bourgeois that control everybody. And in order to do so, they have to
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:37.200]  take away the middle class and deprive everyone else of their rights. And this is the system
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:44.400]  that's been debunked and exposed as completely fraudulent. Yet the American communists and the
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:48.480]  Pope and many of these old communists never gave up despite the demise of the Soviet Union.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:52.720]  That's right. And now Zuckerberg is in China again learning how to censor the Internet and
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.760]  helping them and admitting it. And this guy's got tens of billions of dollars from the free market
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:04.080]  from the science of the West. And then he's just cozying up to these mass murderers and promising
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:10.000]  he can defeat Trump by manipulating Facebook. I mean, it's just insane. In my film, there's no
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  place like Utopia. I interviewed some Chinese students who were in Washington DC visiting
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.360]  and one of them was Christian and he talked about how you can't practice Christianity. You can't
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.480]  speak out about the government. They have labor camps still in China. They pick you up and send
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:34.400]  you away for a few years if you speak out against the government. It's a totalitarian system. It's a
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:41.120]  repression of freedom from China to Cuba. And our government and our business leaders strangely
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:48.960]  continue this destructive passion to somehow promote these tyrannical regimes and ignore the
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:53.200]  fact just like they did in the 60s. Bill Ayers and his gang would run around with the little red
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:59.840]  book of quotations of Chairman Mao, even though he killed 50 million people. Or none. They were
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:06.800]  quoting this guy, the Maoism. And we see that entire ideology and that movement resurrected in
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:10.640]  Black Lives Matter, kill the cops. I was about to say correct me if I'm wrong and I'll let you go
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:14.240]  and I appreciate your time. I want to have you back very soon, Joel. I've studied the Communist
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:19.920]  domestically on the ground. The main guy they follow is Mao and they call themselves Mao
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:26.800]  Brigade. It seems that he's now the guy. He was the guy in the 60s. This is what Bill Ayers and
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:32.560]  his gang remember their quote was, a single spark can start a prairie fire. And Obama quoted from
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:38.880]  that in a little different way in the 2008 election. He would say, a single conversation can change a
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:44.480]  room. A single room can change a building, can change a city. Single spark can start a prairie
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:49.280]  fire. That's their idea. If you kill policemen, if you bomb a government building, it'll create
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:54.480]  this massive revolution. All you need is the spark. And that's what the Black Lives Matter and these
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:59.600]  Occupy people are following this idea. And now that you've got Megan Kelly blaming
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:05.200]  Donald Trump on these Communist attacks. Joel Gilbert, thank you so much. We have obviously
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:10.880]  both of your films for sale, infoorstore.com. You've got several websites. What's the best one

[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:21.440]  And of course, Obama's realfather.com. All right. Thank you, my friend.
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.040]  Joel Gilbert and I. Thank you. We'll talk to you soon. Going now to David Knight.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:33.760]  All I can say is this, folks, there is nothing more evil than this global organized system.
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:38.960]  There is nothing more evil. And they take a bunch of young,
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:44.320]  dumb, spoiled, rotten middle class kids whose parents are liberal. They give them hardcore
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:50.240]  mal brainwashing. And they take the worst of them and put them in charge of the police review board
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:55.200]  to then take over the police department and put a bunch of scum like them in there. I mean,
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:44:00.560]  these people mean business. I'm trying to stop this from happening because I live in this country.
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:06.560]  I love freedom. And these people are just as dangerous. They call Trump Hitler. I mean, they're
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:14.320]  they're like an amalgamation of Hitler and Mao. These people are filth. I'm going to stop ranting
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:19.520]  just briefly before we go to David Knight here. We have several specials that will end today.

[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:42.480]  there at one of the Trump towers in DC where a press conference is coming up in a couple of
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:48.160]  hours. And he's there watching to see if any of the leftist groups that are Soros and White House
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:53.040]  manipulated show up. He's also going to be traveling to other cities to document what's
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:58.160]  happening as well. And he's got to have courage to do that because we should also add that a lot
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:02.560]  of folks are being attacked. The police in New York are being attacked. I mean I was arrested in
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:06.800]  New York for leading a demonstration against Fox News and the Iraq war. We were peaceful.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:11.440]  But the establishment wanted that war to go forward. So I was arrested.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:18.240]  And but then when they attack police and hit them and throw bottles at them and slap the horses,
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:24.560]  that's okay. Arrest aren't made. So because that's my white privilege. I can't protest but
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:29.200]  communists can as they wave red flags in front of Trump Tower in New York, videos on info wars.com
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:34.640]  saying we're going to kill you and your families. Communism, communism and slapping horses, hitting
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.600]  police saying I'm a feminist commie. Those videos are on info wars.com. David, I know you just got
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:43.520]  there yesterday. Great job. You and the crew getting up there. You drove up there and you're
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:47.520]  going to be on the east coast for about a week covering these activities. David, what have you
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:52.240]  witnessed so far? What's coming up? David night info wars.com. Alex, we're right here in front
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:57.200]  of Trump International Hotel soon to be. It's as you see the sign behind me. There's large Trump
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:02.560]  sign and above it it says coming 2016. Of course, Donald Trump himself will be here in just a few
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:07.840]  minutes. There's a massive press conference that's going on at 215 our time here on the east coast.
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:14.960]  Literally hundreds of press from all over the world going in there to cover this press conference.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:20.080]  And I guess we could say they're they're looking at a second coming of Donald Trump in 2017 is
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.160]  really what the sign should say. This was a historical site. They got the bids for it. They're
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:30.320]  going to make a massive hotel complex entertainment restaurant site out of this. And it looks like
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:35.920]  it's just about completed. But there's not very many protesters that have shown up at this location.
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:40.080]  There's only about three or four protesters that have shown up. They're making their own signs.
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:45.680]  The big protests tonight are going to be at the APAC speech. And that's going to be this afternoon
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:50.800]  the three presidential candidates for the Republican Party are going to be speaking to the American
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:54.800]  Israeli Public Affairs Committee. That's what APAC stands for. But of course, what they really
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:01.040]  stand for is how are people going to they're betting the candidates on what their policy
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:06.320]  towards Israel is going to be exactly. I'm not I'm not anti Israel, but I am sick of the Mexican
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:11.040]  government, the Chinese government, the Pope, Israel, Saudi Arabia, everyone just openly here
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:16.240]  telling us what to do and how to behave. I mean, where is there an end to this? Can we just run
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:21.200]  our own country, please? And of course, in the past, we've only seen that from Israel. Now we're
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:24.720]  seeing it from everybody. We're seeing with the Mexican government directly trying to interfere
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:30.480]  in our elections, trying to get people registered to vote as quickly as possible. We have world
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:34.400]  leaders who are speaking out saying we don't want Donald Trump in. Well, they don't want Donald
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:38.800]  Trump in because he's going to act in America's interest, not in their interest. And that's the
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:44.080]  whole point. You've got South Korea, you've got Japan concerned because we've had a massive
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:49.840]  outflow capital. When you look at our trade deficit with Mexico, $60 billion, that's more than the
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:55.120]  gross national product of most of the countries of this world. And it's getting worse every day.
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:59.920]  And now they're dictating our internal policy and teaching us how to censor citizens. I mean,
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:04.160]  we're merging into a global government right now and they're using in totalitarian nations
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:08.480]  to leverage us out. All these multinationals can't wait to get into Cuba and get the slave
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:13.840]  labor. I mean, it's this fusion of top crony capitalism and communism is what they admit
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:18.000]  in all the financial times and publications is the dream scenario. I'm going to skip this break
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.800]  to give you a few more minutes, but I want you to get in there because I didn't realize the
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:24.080]  press conference was starting in just 25 minutes. I don't want you to get shot out, David.
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:28.080]  Well, we're still trying to see if we can get our credentials through. We thought there was
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:32.320]  going to be a rally as well as a press conference. We were more interested in covering what was going
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:36.320]  on outside, but since there wasn't much going on outside, we thought we would go in and do the
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:40.400]  press conference. The press secretary's number and they can get you in, but you might want to call
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.640]  him over because Reeves is back in Texas for a few days, but I'm going to let you go to go see if
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:50.400]  you can do that. But David, continue with what you're planning while you're out there on the east
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:56.080]  coast. Well, Alex, as I said tonight, well, actually after this, there's a private meeting
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:01.120]  that Donald Trump is going to be going to with a lot of Republican congressmen and senators.
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:05.920]  The leadership is not really going to be there, interestingly enough. They openly talked about
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:10.640]  how the leadership was not informed, was not going to be attending because it's the leadership
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:13.680]  of both parties that are opposed to Donald Trump. So he's going to be meeting with some
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:18.480]  of the congressmen. And then after that, he's going to be speaking at APAC along with Ted Cruz
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:22.800]  and John Kasich. There'll be a lot of protests there. I know people are going to be protesting
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:29.040]  APAC as well as Donald Trump at that conference. And then later tonight, he will be speaking
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:33.360]  with CNN. They're going to have the three candidates will be speaking to CNN sequentially
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:38.480]  tonight as well as I believe Hillary Clinton and I think Bernie Sanders is going to phone it in.
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:42.000]  So there's going to be an event there. There might be some protests. We're going to see if
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.520]  those protests are going on there. But one of the things I thought was interesting, Alex,
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:49.600]  was this piece, and I mentioned it briefly in my uploads that was put out by National Review
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:53.840]  last week, and then they have doubled and tripled down on it subsequently. And what they're doing
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:51:00.080]  is basically mocking the white middle class and saying, you people are losing not because of what
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:03.920]  we have done to you. And they put establishment in quotes. They put globalists in quotes. They
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:08.240]  say, no, it isn't the establishment globalists who are who are destroying your economy. You did
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:13.680]  it to yourself. And that's simply not true. These are the same people who evidently don't remember
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:18.000]  what happened less than 10 years ago when the American people lost their homes. And we also then
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.720]  had to bail out the banks. They don't realize that we've got a $60 billion trade deficit or they
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:26.960]  don't want to talk about it with Mexico. Like I said, it's more than the gross national product
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:32.080]  of most of the countries of Central South America and Africa. Most of them don't have an economy
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:37.440]  that that size. And we're exporting that and a net loss each year just to Mexico, not considering
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:44.240]  the other countries. There is a haughty arrogance. The National Review is showing itself as the CIA
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:51.440]  leftist control group that it's been declassified. It is and they're just saying for bitter clingers
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:58.640]  and for Christians. And yes, they're they're they're hatred of Christian whites. Yes. And it
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:02.880]  truly was hatred. And that was the amazing thing about it. I wasn't aware of the article and I
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:06.720]  heard MPR talking about it. And they said, well, if they were saying this about people of color,
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.400]  it would be racist. Well, you know what it is racist. And I'm not going to be told by National
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:14.560]  Review and this bunch of CIA shills that I got to sit at the back of the bus or I've got to use a
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:18.960]  separate restroom because that's the way they're taking it for white males. And I am sick and
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:23.520]  tired of those people. And of course, remember, it was National Review that did the unprecedented
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:28.480]  thing even for National Review that dedicate an entire magazine to trying to take down Donald
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:32.400]  Trump. It didn't have any effect. All they're doing is driving the nail. And I've talked to
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:37.280]  course in much other people last week, David, as you know, and it clicked. And they all of it said,
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:41.600]  look, Donald Trump's a patriot sleeper cell. They got dossiers on him. They actually know
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:48.160]  he's aware of all this. He's played them forever. They're scared to death because they they know
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:52.640]  he really wants to come in and actually turn America back on and be the ultimate hero. Why
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:57.600]  wouldn't he? I mean, even if he was a sociopath, he should want that and double cross the globalist.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:01.760]  And that's why they're so scared of him. Well, I think he's authentic on this trade stuff. He's
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:07.200]  been talking about it for 35 years. He took out $100,000 ad in New York Times 35 years ago to
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.720]  talk about this stuff. So, you know, he this is something that has has been a an issue with him,
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:19.840]  regardless of the other issues. He is opposing the globalists on their central critical path right
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:25.760]  now. The critical path is the open borders, these trade deals to destroy the Western economies. And
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:31.520]  then they want to build their new world order using climate change, change treaties, as well as
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:36.960]  this management of our trade. That's another part of building that's right. And getting countries to
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:43.040]  sell out to them by selling our industry to those groups. It's incredible. David, great job. Get into
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:47.040]  that press conference. And we'll continue to watch the live feeds you're doing. And we'll have clips
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:53.040]  on the nightly news tonight of the APAC situation. Be safe. Great job. Thanks. Thank you, Alex.
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:58.480]  All right, there goes David. Now, I'm gonna let him go so he can get into those meetings right now.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:04.880]  Great job with David Knight and the crew. And the great part is I don't usually hire people's family,
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:09.520]  but his wife has just gone out to events separately and always gotten powerful footage.
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:16.800]  And his son Travis works here separately. He's such a good camera person. And so I said, David,
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:24.000]  I want to send you for a week to the East Coast. He said, great. Can I take my wife and we take
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.920]  Travis? So it's a family affair out there. What other type of news organization has, you know,
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:35.040]  the dad, the son and the mom with the other daughter and the other son, we're both teenagers,
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:42.080]  you know, staying home here in here in Austin, Texas. Just great people. They pulled up stakes
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:45.760]  from North Carolina, sold their business, everything to come down here and work in the
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:49.840]  Info War. And it's very, very exciting to see that. I mean, we're a real organization, folks,
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:55.200]  that is dedicated to taking the global stand. We believe in individuals. I mean, David Knight
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:01.760]  didn't win a contest, a reporter contest. Jacari did. He does a great job. But I tell you, he was
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:07.360]  a runner up and then he's just, just been one of the best, best hires ever. And I just hired him
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:15.920]  off of a few videos he did and knowing that he was an engineer and part of a libertarian think
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:20.640]  tank that had infiltrated colleges and actually caused criminal investigations and indictments
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:26.320]  of them gassing students, not telling them in experiments so they could then create fraudulent
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:30.320]  numbers to try to ban cars. I mean, you know, David's been involved with some really, really,
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:36.240]  really great stuff for no pay. And that's what he was doing in North Carolina fighting these people
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:42.400]  and really exposing their criminal activities. So we're, we just salute David Knight and the
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:47.840]  whole team out there. Very, very exciting. And we're going to continue documenting this. In fact,
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:53.600]  we have the clip yet of anti-Trump protestor who slapped police horse describes herself as a commie
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:59.680]  feminist. I know the audio is not too good. There's a lot of cussing, but it's, it's there on the site.
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:03.680]  The anti-Trump protestor arrested in Kansas City for physically attacking a police horse describes
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:10.560]  herself as a commie feminist, close quote, waiting a giant red flag 29 year old April J. Foster was
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:14.480]  caught on camera yelling at the horse and trying to scare the animal as police attempted to control
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:19.680]  the early mob. She subsequently slapped the horse and tried to run away and police singled her out
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:25.840]  for arrest. But initially being able to flee, Foster's later charged with abuse of a police
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:31.440]  service animal. In Foster's Instagram bio, now deleted, the individual who apparently identifies
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:37.840]  as transgender describes herself as a commie feminist. Imagine my shock. No words yet emerged
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:42.240]  from Donald Trump as whether his campaign disavows the individual responsible for slapping the horse.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:45.760]  That's right. He has to disavow.
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:59.280]  And then I love how it's a bunch of Muslims wearing hijabs with transgenders and liberals.
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:04.320]  I mean, in a Muslim country, they would hang that person to death. They'd stone them and bash
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:09.520]  their brains out. But they don't care. They don't have any problem with Islam. They got a problem
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:14.880]  with the country that gives them iPhones and cars and medicine and high rises and swimming
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:19.760]  pools and shopping malls. And that is the problem with America. We just got too much wealth. It's
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:27.600]  too good for all this trash. They just don't appreciate any of it. And then now acting like
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:34.080]  this, it is going to drive everybody into the hands of the police system that the feds are
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:38.000]  controlling and then will accept any level of police state to protect us from the mobs of
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.160]  communists. And then our journey into tyranny is complete because again, they merge fascism
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:48.560]  with communism. All these ignorant liberals that get taught these phony political templates,
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:54.560]  they're always saying to me, what do you mean communism merges with fascism? Dude,
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:59.600]  those are opposite. But you read the economists, you read the financial times, you read Carol
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:03.760]  Quigley, you read the real documents, you read the communist party president in China,
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:10.640]  what 10 years ago was in the BBC said, China under Chinese communism, capitalism has been
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:19.280]  perfected. We are the essence of capitalism. And that's what this is. It's a bunch of ruling
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:25.760]  elite tax exempt with big slave factories that live above the law. Look at the big corporations
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:29.600]  looking their lips to go into Cuba. They're not freeing it. They don't have private property.
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:33.520]  The multinationals are going to move in there and now have slave labor. And our media will
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:38.480]  tell us how great it is. I mean, it's over the top. We'll be right back. Stay with us,
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:59:07.360]  we got a special guest joining us. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCN Live.com today.

[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:15.280]  All right, coming up the one, the only G. Edward Griffin is going to be joining us.
[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:18.720]  We'll be taking your calls in the second part of that interview than Paul Watson will be
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:28.960]  commanding, chairing, anchoring, producing the fourth hour. So much to break down here.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:33.200]  I want to play this clip. It's a long clip. It's a monotone, but the information
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:41.840]  is very, very, very important. Tucson cop says anti Trump protesters, most hateful people he's
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:48.160]  ever seen. And it went on to say that the media doesn't portray that they act like it's Trump's
[02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:52.560]  fault. So that's why Watson writes with this lady attacking the horse and the police, you know,
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:56.480]  Trump needs to disavow this lady immediately because all the violence is his fault.
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:05.600]  When they go out and do these things, it's his fault. After all, the Chinese communist leaders
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:10.800]  said so. It's his fault. They have mobile execution vans. It's his fault. They have
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:14.800]  suicide nets. It's his fault. They have rivers that catch on fire. It's his fault that they're
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:19.760]  ruling class over their tax exempt. It's his fault. It's his fault. It's his fault. It's his fault.
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:27.600]  It's his fault. It's his fault. And so for the masses of people that are dumbed down,
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:33.040]  that just sounds good to them, just like they want free health care. They forget they were
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:37.120]  supposed to get free health care and robotic care. So now they want Bernie Sanders to give them free
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:46.640]  health care. They're just desperate zombies. They're mentally ill. The definition of insanity
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:49.600]  is doing the same thing over and over again, thinking you're going to get a different result.
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:56.560]  And they just literally believe Cuba. I heard this in college and Russia is a utopia.
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:03.600]  They actually believe England has better health care than we do. They screwed up as ours is.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:10.880]  They just aren't cultured. They're not informed. But they're pseudo. They're pseudo. They're in
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:16.720]  a dream that they're smart. They read a book. Let's go to this clip with this police officer.
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:22.000]  But I personally, I feel uncomfortable. I felt like at any moment with the climbing of these
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:27.920]  protesters, this wasn't the people that was involved in Trump's rally. It was these protesters
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:34.000]  that at any moment I could get sucker punched by somebody because they're just outrageously screaming
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:39.600]  and yelling and not really saying anything but hateful slurs, calling them a racist, calling
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:44.320]  people that were involved, racists and haters. And the funny thing is, these people are the most
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:52.160]  hateful, evil people I've ever seen. I could not believe what I saw. That's right. He goes on for
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:58.640]  10 minutes. You've got to go see these people for yourself. They'll walk over and go, I'm going to
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:03.440]  kill you and your family. And then you turn around and go, go ahead and hit me, Alex. Go ahead and hit
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:10.000]  me. I'm like, you're not a communist. You work for the establishment. That's right. We do. We're
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:19.680]  going to get you. And you've got to see them for yourself. You've got to see them to believe it
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:26.400]  and to know what you're dealing with. I'm going to play a clip here. Migrants attack 60 minutes
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:32.080]  crew in Sweden. Any crew, people bring food or money into these refugee camps. They just beat
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:37.200]  you up. They attack you because these aren't even the regular Muslims. These aren't real refugees.
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:44.240]  These are military aged men and thugs from North Africa, the Middle East, everywhere else just
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:50.160]  beating everybody up. You don't go to a train station and have a crew and just all over Sweden,
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:56.720]  people just wander around beating everyone up and the police in the video won't even help them.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:04.800]  Read the story. See the videos in full wars.com. It goes on and on and on. Again, it's in
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:09.680]  Swedish, so we're not going to play it here for radio listeners, but we're playing video
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:18.480]  for viewers. And then they are attacking people in wheelchairs. That's another thing about these
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:23.600]  jihadis, man. They really love beating up women and old people and stuff. I've never seen such
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:31.040]  cowardly filth in my life. I mean, I just have an instinctive thing not to attack children or women.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.600]  Now, I see some big tough mean thug guy, so he wants to fight me. I want to fight a bigger
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:43.200]  and meaner. I just can't help but just women and children. Man, I tell you, it just makes me want to
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:50.400]  throw up that there's just where do these people come from? Who are their parents? What's in their
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:57.280]  genes? I just don't understand it. And why are we ruled by this trash? Go be back.
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:04.240]  Today is Monday, March 21st, and here are some of the top stories. The electronic voting firm
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:09.120]  that's counting Tuesday's Utah GOP election results is headed by George Soros Insider. The
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:14.000]  chairman of the Smartmatic Group is Lord Mark Malik Brown, who's also on the board of Soros'
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:19.040]  Open Society Foundation and has close ties to the socialist billionaire. Soros, who has given over
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:23.200]  13 million to Hillary Clinton for the election, formally warned Donald Trump that there will be,
[02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:28.480]  quote, consequences for his campaign to secure the U.S. border. In similar news, Mexico is pressuring
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:32.960]  its permanent residents in the U.S. to become citizens, a status that would enable them to vote,
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:38.240]  presumably against Trump if the Mexican government gets its way. Officially, Mexico claims it respects
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:43.120]  U.S. sovereignty and has no strategy to influence the results of the presidential race. Yet Mexican
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:47.680]  diplomats are hosting free workshops to assist immigrants in gaining U.S. citizenship. And
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:52.160]  remember back in 2014 when radio host Glenn Beck was giving out free gifts to the legals
[02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:56.400]  surging across the border? Well, it turns out that Ted Cruz was also helping him. For more news,

[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:34.160]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show. Well into the third hour now, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:41.440]  The balance of the hour, G. Ebert Griffin is our guest and of course he is the author of The Creature
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:50.400]  from Jekyll Island. That's right folks, thank you so much for joining us. The Creature from Jekyll Island, a
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:56.480]  second look at the Federal Reserve. Fifth edition is out. I guess this book was first published,
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:09:03.520]  was it 25, 30 years ago? Maybe longer, of course Ron Paul has written a lot about the book, talked
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:08.160]  a lot about it. Well I'll tell you, 30 years ago maybe one out of 100 people to the Federal Reserve
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:14.080]  was private and that its shareholders were secret. But now today most people know it's private and
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:18.880]  most people know it runs the economy. We've played clubs from CNBC, you name it, where they go.
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:23.600]  Aren't we all just slaves of the Federal Reserve and international banks? Don't they run and own
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:28.880]  everything now? And then all five pundits agree. So now that we've had this big victory and we've
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:33.600]  gotten to the point thanks to Ron Paul and G. Ebert Griffin and countless others that came before him
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:43.760]  to expose it. Where do we go from here? Because I showed an article earlier in the broadcast from
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:50.080]  the Boston Globe from last Friday. Vote all you want. The secret government won't change. I'm
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:54.880]  going to read some quotes from this in this hour. We've gotten to the point where they now go,
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:10:00.000]  okay the communist Chinese do own our debt and do tell us what we can do. Okay we're going to let
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.560]  Mexico have people come here and vote. That's in Bloomberg today. Stop Trump movement gets
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:10.640]  boost from Mexico's efforts in the U.S. Oh they are handing out driver's license. This is happening.
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:15.520]  So we now see how America is to be conquered and brought down.
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:23.040]  G. Ebert Griffin is an expert filmmaker, you name it, going back to the 60s, exposing
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:28.800]  the nightmare of collectivism, fascism, socialism, communism, all different
[02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:34.720]  flavors like Jim Jones had cherry, kool-aid, grape kool-aid, coconut kool-aid, all had cyanide in it.
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:38.080]  So those different flavors but it's pretty much the same thing at the end of the day,
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:44.400]  command and control. He's the head of freedom force rising across the world, great organization,
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:52.240]  educating people and I want to ask him where are we historically? Is this giant leftist move funded
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:56.320]  by the big banks and the foundations and universities? The red flags were settling in the streets
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:01.600]  everywhere, the radical jihadis being brought in destabilized. They seem to be launching
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:05.680]  everything they've got. Is that a counter offensive or a final offensive? Because
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:11.600]  they're weak in many ways and so I think they're pulling out all the stops to try to dominate
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:16.400]  and crush a burgeoning liberty movement that they can see the metrics of that will defeat them.
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:21.680]  In Hillary's own words, she's losing the info war or am I being too optimistic? I want to give
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:28.400]  us view on Donald Trump and so much more in this hour with the author of The Creature from Jekyll
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:35.360]  Island. Great to have you with us sir. Well thank you Alex. I really enjoy your introduction. It
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:39.680]  looks like we have a lot of ground to cover today. Where would you like to start? There's so much.
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:45.760]  Well you know me, I like to start with the big picture and then move into the details.
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:51.440]  Your question regarding where do we stand in the tableau of history or the movement of history,
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:58.000]  I think is a good one because I know that it's true that history does repeat itself.
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:02.800]  There's no question about that. But every once in a while something new happens in history.
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:08.400]  Some little detail that never really developed before and I think we're living through that
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:17.600]  situation right now. We've come to a point in the evolution of communication and the concentration
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:24.800]  of command as you put it so well. The globalization of society that the world has never experienced
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:30.160]  before. So in the past we've always had lots of options. You could escape from one country,
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:35.520]  go to another country. You could cash in your currency for one nation and go
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:42.640]  buy the currency of some other nation, all these things. You had some options and I think one of
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:50.080]  the characteristics of our day is that our options are being narrowed constantly. We can see that
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:56.560]  every day. Fewer places to turn. This has never happened before and I think the trend therefore
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:01.120]  that we're looking at what's happening to us, what's happening to America has to be viewed
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:08.480]  in that context that the old rules may not apply. For example you often hear well the economy always
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:12.880]  bounces back doesn't it? I mean we've been through this before but ups and downs we've had booms and
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:18.400]  busts but we always come back and that is true. That's the repeating of history that I was talking
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:24.400]  about but yet there's something new here and the idea was that we had something to come back to
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:29.200]  that there was a choice. There was another way we could come back to the free market for example.
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:36.000]  Get rid of all of the machinations of the market that you usually destroy in markets and go back
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:41.920]  to the concept of freedom of choice again and therefore nations and economies can rebuild and
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:48.320]  they can grow to proportions that never had been seen before. That's a different scenario today.
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:53.600]  The whole trend of the international scene today is to get rid of that option so there's no way to
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:58.800]  go back. You just stuck with what you've got and it gets worse and worse and worse and the end of
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:04.240]  that line is not an option to go back but to just buckle under and live under whatever the
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:11.040]  powers that be decide is best for us. That's the most disturbing part of all this because
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:15.520]  I think our time is running out. I don't ask me how much time we have. The question always comes
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:22.960]  up but I don't know. I have a feeling that it's coming up within a generation where maybe there
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:28.560]  will be no turning back. So that's the first observation I'd like to make is that the decisions
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:35.760]  that are facing the American people today, I have a new characteristic to them. It's a little
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:44.800]  frightening but at the same time it's hopeful in that once, if we're able to accelerate and
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:49.280]  extend this awakening that you were mentioning just a moment ago in your introduction that people
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:54.400]  are now aware of the Federal Reserve. They're aware that we have no options. They're aware
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:58.240]  that these things are being done to us. They're aware that our leaders are sort of thumbing their
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:03.600]  nose at us and saying what are you going to do about it? So where does that go? I think we see
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:08.480]  these two forces that are rising at the same time. Of course the forces of totalitarianism are
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:13.520]  well in advance that we're coming along late comrades but we're gaining on it and I think
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:18.560]  as we come to the finish line it's going to be a very close call and so there's a certain
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:25.200]  franticness I think that we see in the parts of these totalitarian forces. They want to finish
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:31.600]  the job real soon because otherwise the awakening that is now going on may overcome them and they
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:38.240]  also will lose the option. I agree. I want to expand on that. They're panicking. They went from
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:43.440]  denying all this to now just being arrogant and saying you poor pathetic white people your jobs
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:47.680]  will never come back. You don't have jobs not because of globalism because you were lazy and
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:55.360]  dumb in national review and just the weaponization of media and the nakedness of okay we are run
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:16:00.800]  by shadow grips big deal and the financial towns of London saying and now for world government.
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:06.400]  Of course there's world government and we're authoritarian because we know best. I think
[02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:12.800]  their attempt to just break our back and bully us is backfiring and I think they're really insulated
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:18.240]  despite a lot of their smarts. They're not smart enough to realize that either killing the golden
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:24.000]  goose bringing into totalitarianism it'll hang them as sure as it hangs us but also at the same time
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:28.640]  they really do think because there's all these yes men around them that they're insulated
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:35.680]  and history shows that's just not the case. Well I share that point of view. It's an optimistic
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:41.360]  point of view in a time when it's hard to find optimism but I do agree. I think that human
[02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:49.360]  nature is the one force that is the most powerful of all. It rises above economy, it rises above
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:56.960]  sociology, it rises above politics. Human nature is such that we have this innate desire for
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:02.560]  justice and we may have trouble trying to figure out what is just because we're fed false information.
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:08.400]  You know we're told that the good guys are really the bad guys and so we're irate because
[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:14.400]  we have the desire for justice and so we sometimes attack the good guys simply because of the
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:19.120]  info war that you talk about has convinced us that they are really the bad guys so that's the
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:25.520]  problem but still human nature is such and although our desire for justice and fairness
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:30.800]  and our innate wanting everybody to benefit even though we may be a little selfish and we
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:35.280]  said well we want to benefit first you know that's naturally less part of our human nature too
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:39.040]  we have to take care of ourselves first before we can take care of others in need
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:43.520]  we have to take care of our families first so that now we can take care of others that may need
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:49.120]  help that is true but still we want the best for most people so all of those things are not ever
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:56.560]  going to change and even though a totalitarian system may be forced upon us globally and I think
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:01.920]  they're calling me from Washington now to say that I'm on the wrong track but anyway in spite
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:06.560]  of that human nature I think eventually we'll rise above that don't any trouble with that scenario
[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:12.240]  is it may take a long time and I really don't want to see it take a thousand years I want to see
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:18.000]  this reversal happen if not in my lifetime certainly in the next generation let me ask you
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.560]  about Donald Trump and a bunch of other issues when we come back and in geopolitical issues as
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:29.360]  well but just separately isn't the problem with even having a partial free market is that it creates
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:35.360]  so much wealth that we let our kids and grandkids get get decadent disconnected and then allow them
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:40.320]  to be brainwashed at the foundation controlled universities and I think that really out of
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:45.280]  everything that really simplifies it because the people being raised by tv raised by college raised
[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:50.320]  by state-run schools they've got everything so good but they have class envy you know seeing
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:54.480]  the Kardashians and so they feel inadequate and Bernie Sanders says hey I'm going to give you
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:19:00.080]  everything free and so they're just basically beguiled by that because they've never had to
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:05.360]  actually fend for themselves well it's certainly true that's part of the human nature formula too
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:10.080]  but I think we have to recognize that there are two forces here one is the natural force these
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:16.000]  things do take place over a period of time societies that prosper do decay that's that's
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.960]  the repeating of history we're talking about but the new element is that there are groups
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:26.400]  who are consciously accelerating that yes they know that and they're playing upon it because
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:33.040]  it'll benefit them right now and by the way if he classified the CIA run by foreign ribs by the
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:38.080]  60s was trying to subvert the family and break things down to make us all atomized and by ourselves

[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:23.120]  short segment g edwards so let me just get to the trump situation then i want to ask you about the
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:30.800]  main lining of no criticism of china now and their horrible human rights abuses no criticism of kuba
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:36.000]  and they're pitching it like we're going to democratize kuba by leaving communist him
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:42.960]  and bringing in multinationals who will make perfect sweetheart deals basically for slave wages
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:51.840]  the chinese model of foreign capitalists working with communist i mean it's so sick to watch the
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:58.800]  immorality and to just see how they are merging us into this global system just as you and others
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:11.680]  warned back in the 1960s well my comment on that is that what we see unfolding is to me a kind of
[02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:18.720]  a refreshing development because the issues that previously have been well hidden from view are now
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:24.640]  right on the surface as you have so dramatically pointed out is right there in your face and they
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:29.520]  like to put it in your face because they want to they are boasting it they were there at that stage
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:36.960]  right now and the issue i'm talking about is the fact that this whole phony baloney message
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:45.760]  that we have been getting over the past 50 60 years about communism versus capitalism socialism in
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:52.320]  there and fascism and nazism and left and right and republicans and democrats all of these splits
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:57.280]  it's all phony because when you look at the leaders and all of these groups they share
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:27:03.920]  the fundamental idea the fundamental philosophy beneath all of this is the same and you use the
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:08.560]  word in your introduction it's collectivism you accurately said that all these are the things
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:13.360]  are really different flavors or different labels you peel off the label and underneath that you
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:18.880]  find this thing called collectivism now collectivism has two layers also on the surface it's an
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:23.520]  ideological thing it's it's the concept that they teach in school you know it's for the
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:28.320]  greater good of the greater number we must sacrifice the individual if necessary for society
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:34.000]  and all that sort of thing that's an ideological gloss over the top of it and it makes the young
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.040]  people especially and me i might add also i fell for that when i was in school made me feel good
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:43.680]  that we were taking care of the greater good you know the greater number but now we come to this
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:48.800]  point where the gloss is coming off and we see that underneath that there's still one more level
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:54.400]  and that is that this is nothing but organized criminality we are looking at an international
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:28:02.000]  criminal syndicate that really is using ideology and is using all these phrases to to appeal to
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:07.760]  that desire for justice in their own words weaponized ideology weaponize it and that's what they
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:13.920]  have done and so that makes us focus finally on the real essence of this battle it's a criminal
[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:19.920]  group and they share they don't care whether they're from russia or france or england or the united
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:24.720]  states or poland it doesn't make any difference they all are brothers and they just exactly and
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:30.240]  they opportunistically share formulas they have summits as you know they share ideas of scams
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:34.320]  they're always fine-tuning them they're jumping on both sides of an issue playing us all off against
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:40.480]  each other exactly so that's now so close to the surface if not on the surface that i think anybody
[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:46.480]  can see it so now we can finally finally begin to cut through all of that of that propaganda and say
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:54.720]  our common enemy is not communism socialism fascism it's not china it's not cuba it's not the
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:29:00.720]  republic of the democrats it's a mentality it's an ideology well not even an ideology it's a
[02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:04.480]  criminal mentality i was about to say when you run into communist on the street they're not well

[02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:25.280]  i might add i even participated in a couple of training courses and the idea was to to agitate
[02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:29.600]  people to the point that you fill them with hate so they stop thinking and then they will go out and
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:35.200]  do whatever you want they try to get cannon fodder in other words that's right gee ever griffin is

[02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:03.600]  google wanted to overthrow syrian president Assad which would have allowed isis to gain
[02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:08.320]  complete control over syria you heard that right google in 2012 wanted to help these
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:12.880]  so-called syrian rebels overthrow Assad according to state department emails recently released
[02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:18.720]  in july 2012 jared cohen the head of the company's google's ideas division wrote an email to several
[02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:22.880]  top clean officials and said quote please keep close hold but my team is planning to launch a
[02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:26.480]  tool that would publicly track and map the defections in syria which parts of the government
[02:30:26.480 --> 02:30:31.200]  that are coming from cohen added quote given how hard it is to get information in syria right now
[02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:35.840]  we are partnering with aljazeera who will then take primary ownership over the tool we have built
[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:40.640]  track the data verify it and broadcast it back into syria but it's well known that virtually
[02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:45.280]  all the insurgents in syria are either isis or have close ties to the islamic state and here's
[02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:50.080]  another thing aljazeera is state funded by guitar a country which wants to sought out of power
[02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:54.400]  because the syrian president refused a proposed pipeline running through syria which would benefit

[02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:24.320]  jones they call it social signaling there's other terms for it where you go along with
[02:33:24.320 --> 02:33:29.280]  political correctness just because you want to be polite and they take the fact that
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:34.560]  americans of every stripe on average just want to work hard and be successful and have a good
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:43.360]  future for them and their families and so they use our well-meaning inclinations against us
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:48.640]  and that's why it's time to be very stern with these people and get back in their face and
[02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:56.480]  use original language because now they're saying don't use the word mother or father
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:34:00.720]  or boy or girl or he or she at universities and high schools and elementary schools say
[02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:08.560]  he or he again they can get you to talk like a some type of ufo cult they got you they just
[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:13.360]  sit back and see what can we get them to do well let's have msnbc come out and say your

[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:36.640]  but you are going to go through a naked body scanner you must stop complying with the police
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:41.920]  state and not because you want to kill cops or hate the police themselves it's congress it's the
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:45.680]  it's the leaders it's the globalists that are turning us into a chinese-style tyranny
[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:53.600]  and just like a communist-style tyranny exempting when and whenever they want in our face to set
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:35:00.080]  the precedent that they are above the law it is an inversion of reality we're going back to

[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:06.720]  1995 we get it private label for the biggest high quality lab in the country same ones that supply
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:11.840]  the big whole food stores they sell for $24.95 even more we sell the exact same bottle private
[02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:19.760]  labeled 1995 and you get a free toothbrush that sells for like $8 in stores okay but it's basically
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:26.560]  a $5 value and we are doing that sets like $10 off what this should be info wars life.com
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:32.800]  info wars store.com and again it's fundamental I could sell our super metal vitality for $30
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:36.720]  more that's the industry standard for something that's good I got a probiotic coming out I could
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:43.600]  sell for $130 I sell for 80 that'd be discounted people say they won't appreciate if you discount

[02:36:56.880 --> 02:37:01.440]  want to dominate the market and that's what's happened we sell more colloidal silver than
[02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:07.200]  whole foods does from the manufacturer they've told us than the whole chain because we sell it
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:12.480]  for less I mean now we don't make much on it so it takes a lot to run this operation that's just
[02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:17.520]  one item of tens of thousands they sell but the point is we're trying to duplicate that on so many
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:22.720]  other fronts and it's made right here in America so check out the whole line of products info wars
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:31.840]  life.com or cold toll free 888-253-3139 we don't get stimulus money like NPR or PBS or MSNBC
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:35.520]  against government money we're funded by you buying our high quality products that's what the media
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:41.520]  freaks out and goes he sells books and t-shirts and videos and vitamins what a kook oh I'm so
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:47.040]  horrible all those big channels sell vitamins and stuff all of them do it all of them and then they
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:53.120]  get government money on top of it and then I'm bad because I sell high quality that the
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:38:01.840]  nutraceutical sites love the the supplement Nazis love because I went out and hired the most
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:07.120]  neurotic well-known companies out there because I knew he'd be a target of regulators everybody
[02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:11.920]  else that's why all everything we've got is California standard that's made where you can't pass it
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:17.280]  I've thought about not even going to that level because there's so many stuff we can't carry or
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:22.080]  produce but uh I'm on a rant here it's just kind of a free market angle as well both these specials

[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:34.720]  against the globalist I want to go to phone calls going back to G. Edward Griffin G. Edward
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:39.200]  looking at those points Trump I want your obviously you're going to tell me your real
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:45.680]  view on him I want to see obviously what you see is as victory points I see organic food 30 years
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:50.160]  ago couldn't get it anywhere it was very expensive as people bought it though it built the market
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:55.760]  now it's supplanting GMO pushing them off shells even at Walmart and Target that's an example of us
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:39:01.280]  changing our habits voting with our action game over I see examples of they're trying to ban guns
[02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:05.280]  but everybody's going out getting people to shoot the gun culture is growing there's so many examples
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:10.640]  where everybody's going analog or low tech with washers and dryers and appliances because they
[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:15.600]  work better they don't break and they don't cost as much that kills the whole smart grid that's what
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:20.320]  the taxes and control is there's hundreds of other examples but I just see people realizing the power
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:29.120]  they have to shop local to to to be involved in mom and pop you know operations as another front
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:33.680]  line against the globalist and again it goes back to individual actions that end up helping the
[02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:41.440]  collective but aren't directed by a top-down system so trump solutions good good things you see happening
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:48.000]  and what you think the big hurdles are as well thank you sir go ahead okay well that's a that's a
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:53.920]  big category let's let's just start with your comments on the the ma and pa operation I couldn't
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:40:00.480]  agree with you more Alex the the essence of a free market is the ability to enter the market at the
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:06.960]  low level and that's the very reason that the collectivist system has to have so many regulations
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:12.080]  and controls supposedly in the name of protecting the people of course they always have that out
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:17.760]  there as their excuse but the real the real advantage to the collectivist is that it eliminates entry
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:23.680]  into the system you can't just go out and set up your coffee table or your your card table and sell
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:28.480]  lemonade on the street anymore because you got to have a license now and you got to have somebody
[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:34.000]  test your lemonade to make sure it's pure and all that sort of thing well and that's a you know
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:39.600]  an absurd example but it does happen we see it all over the place where little ma and pa operations
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:45.440]  are going out of business little local hardware stores going out of business because they cannot
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:51.280]  compete with the big chains and the big box stores well it's not just because the big box stores have
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:58.400]  you know have the lower prices and all and the big deals it's also because of the regulations
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:04.160]  that they have to comply with if you if you try and sell vegetables that you grow in your own backyard
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:08.080]  you can sell them pretty cheap down there at the farmer's market every thursday if you want to
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:11.760]  but they won't let you do that because you now you have to have a license you have to have a
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:17.440]  certain improve that you're using certain fertilizers and no regulations so yes you're
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:21.840]  right on target everyone i think understands that that the collectivist system that's building
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:27.520]  around us does not want the small ma and pa operations because they're harder to control
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:32.720]  so naturally the big companies they go along with it because they're protected if the big company
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:38.400]  has a problem with the profit margins they simply go to washington spend a few uh thousand dollars
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:43.680]  a few hundred thousand dollars they buy a couple of politicians and they get legislation passed
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:48.080]  that makes it okay for them and it allows them to do certain things that they couldn't do
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:52.880]  in an honest free market so that's my comment and i think everybody understands that's what's
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:57.040]  going on and it's one of the things we have to reverse it's one of the dangers it's one of the
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:02.160]  pitfalls of collectivism is that it will always destroy the market for the little guy and it'll
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:08.080]  always ensure monopolies which is a side issue because most people think that the only way to
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:13.040]  prevent a monopoly is to have government regulations that that forbid it it's just the other way
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:20.240]  around monopolies can never really last they can never um exist for very long at all and without
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:26.160]  government protection every time a monopoly existed runs to washington and and insists or
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:32.320]  whatever government they exist in and they they buy politicians to pass laws that will ensure that
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:37.920]  their monopoly stays as a monopoly and prevents competition from knocking them off so anyway
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:42.800]  it's one of those things that the people down there in the street you know um protesting
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:47.520]  against the the capitalist system or what they think is the capitalist system they have to realize
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:52.480]  that the system they're protesting against is really a collectivist system some people would
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:56.960]  call it a communist system or socialist system it's all the same it's a collectivist system and as
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:02.560]  it becomes more and more centralized the prosperity goes and they're taught call for more collectivism
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:07.680]  that'll fix it of course that's the absurdity of it and you see these people on the streets and
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:13.040]  they're filled with rage and as i said earlier before i understand that because the the textbooks
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:18.720]  teach how to create rage they they get young people preferably young people idealistic young
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:23.680]  people into the streets protesting on behalf of what they think is an honorable objective higher
[02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:28.720]  wages let's say or the end of the war whatever whatever is good in your heart you feel that's
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:32.160]  good get them out there on the streets but they you manipulate them so that they're in
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:36.800]  confrontation with the police the police have to do their job they have to push them back
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:42.880]  and then then somebody uh probably an ajamp revocateur throws a fireball into the mix and
[02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:49.120]  all of a sudden the water hoses come on and the and the gas and the mace comes out and people feel
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:55.040]  that the processors get gas they get water hose and from now they've been victimized now they've
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:59.440]  been validated now the malice come to them and say don't worry we're going to overthrow and kill
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:03.520]  all these people that's right and they're filled with rage because they felt that pressure they
[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:08.000]  felt that water hose they smelled that mace and so forth so now they're changed or a different
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:12.960]  person they're ready to kill and this is a this is a scientific process that goes on and we have
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:18.320]  to recognize that so that that's my comment on that and and i suppose the most interesting thing
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:24.160]  in the news today is uh what about trump you know and i know i've been trying to avoid that
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:29.680]  issue quite a bit because i know it's controversial but might as well jump right into it uh i think
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:36.560]  that uh donald trump is an amazing phenomenon in that he's uh doing what i would have considered to
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:43.200]  be impossible a few months ago he's actually challenging the established political uh monopoly
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:51.840]  he's actually shaking him up and for that i i'm just i wish him good luck anything that would
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:56.880]  break up the establishment monopoly but is he only doing that to terrorize him into making a deal
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:45:03.200]  with him to make him regional king well now now we go to a little deeper what what is this motive
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:08.400]  and there are lots of possible uh reasons there first of all the one you just mentioned maybe
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:15.360]  he's playing the game to to create more uh violence and so that we can have an excuse for martial law
[02:45:15.920 --> 02:45:22.320]  maybe he's just setting up the scene so that when the uh the nominations come at the gop that people
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:29.040]  will accept a a new dark horse candidate like romney for example is the final solution to put
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:34.880]  forth a a candidate that doesn't trigger all of this violence maybe it's maybe it's a ploy at that
[02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:41.120]  level i don't know and and maybe it's just a it's just an accident of history that somebody
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:46.480]  is playing upon the anger of the american people they're so fed up as we've been saying
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:50.720]  by watching this happening and that's where i come from regardless he's saying things that
[02:45:50.720 --> 02:45:55.280]  even if he is a shill is damaging the power structure so much that's why they're hitting
[02:45:55.280 --> 02:45:59.920]  the panic button they don't know what he's doing they don't know if he's going to make a deal
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:04.480]  but the republican leadership won't even meet with him and i've talked to a bunch of insiders they
[02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:09.520]  say no trump has been a sleeper cell he actually is aware of the new world order even before you
[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:14.160]  were on air alex and just get ready next week he's going to come out against the fellow reserve
[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:17.920]  happens next week he's going to do this and then i've had trump point blank tell me you know thank
[02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:21.520]  you for what you're doing don't worry i know what's going on i'm going to take these global
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:26.080]  aston make america great again and he's just dumbing it down for the public i i think he
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:30.640]  really could be real uh but regardless he's a manifestation of the grassroots explosion
[02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:36.960]  yeah and the thing that bothers me about not trump but the whole issue surrounding trump
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:41.600]  is that we're back to the same old game again of looking at personalities it seemed like it's the
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:46.320]  contest of slogans and and sound bites did he really say that no how are people going to react
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:50.000]  to that what's his popularity this week is it going up or down and what are they going to do over
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:56.080]  here you know all about trump all about the election process and not one time not one time do we hear
[02:46:56.080 --> 02:47:01.360]  anything about the principles what he believes in his ideological political principles he's going
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:05.440]  to do this and going to do that he's now he loves the Mormons we hear that we heard that the night
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:10.240]  he loves everybody who no matter who he talks to i love you you know i love you you're good
[02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:14.880]  and that's his style and everybody they love it you know i mean they well the truth is he is being
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:20.080]  popular is actually unifying around nation state and sovereignty and against global trade deals so
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:26.880]  yeah yeah so anyway i just don't the thing that bothers me is is not trump so much it's the the
[02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:33.680]  process of covering the trump phenomenon is that at no point are we talking about fundamental
[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:38.080]  principles like the free market for example do you like the fact he wants to audit the Fed
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:44.320]  uh not particularly uh liar it's easy to say uh any politician uh no matter what they believe
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:48.080]  at this stage in the game say yeah i'll audit the Fed let me ask you this who do you like then
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:56.000]  to me do you trust Cruz uh elix my my mantra is i will never vote for anybody that i don't think
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:02.560]  represents my political view i would never vote for the lesser of two evils i might vote for the
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:08.480]  greater of two goods but never for the lesser of two or three or four evils i think that's what's
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:13.280]  been pushing the country into despair for so long we've been playing that game sure what is it about
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:18.560]  trump then then has the establishment having a cardiac arrest well he's breaking he's breaking
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:23.600]  the uh their control i mean they i don't think they control the guy now it's possible that they do
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:28.240]  and it's a game you know but i just don't think he in other words he's not a member of the club
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:33.120]  he hasn't paid his dues and i think that's uh that's the main thing that's what genridge said
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:38.000]  he's hadn't been initiated the secret societies yeah and that was a figure's speech of course but uh
[02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:45.200]  anyway because gingrich himself has we know that but anyway uh the thing that i'm looking at is that
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:52.480]  if if trump does go in and receive the nomination we need to look at who the vice president will be
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:59.280]  because trump himself is only a bullet away and that they were probably they probably put a cfr guy
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:03.840]  and he'll be surrounded by cfr people so and in the long game here it's not going to make an awful
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:09.360]  lot of difference if trump is surrounded by cfr people because it would be like reagan to a certain
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:15.520]  extent you know uh he the president really can't do much he's surrounded by all of his uh his advisors
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:20.320]  and his administrators well that's what this article of the boston globe says is that the permanent
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:25.040]  bureaucracy and the foreign interest run everything and and and this is like mainline top government
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:30.160]  advisors saying this so so i wonder why they are getting to the point of throwing this out in our
[02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:37.520]  face as you ever well i don't know i think it's um uh a couple of things come to mind first of all
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:44.240]  i have no choice it is in our face and so rather than uh try to hide it i think they're probably
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:48.560]  right it is trying to write it as though it's their idea sure that they're hiding in plain view
[02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:51.920]  just to just to try to standardize it i agree let's talk to sherry that we're going to break
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:55.200]  about a minute and a half but sherry and organ you got a question or comment for g ever go ahead
[02:49:56.640 --> 02:50:04.960]  hi mr johns hi welcome thank you i haven't ever talked on the radio show but i come across an
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:11.520]  info that was very game-changing from all this is thing is happening because i heard from very
[02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:17.520]  good friend of mine overseas that they were talking about that this whole agenda was well
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:25.360]  talked about it all of this is happening with trump everything because obama and the people
[02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:32.640]  are global they want to him for head of the un and once he becomes not everything he makes sense
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:38.800]  why he's in kuba why he done everything like that because once he gets that powers are being
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:45.680]  the head of un and doing all these things what they're doing with obama you know trump and
[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:52.480]  and they're going to be a riot and they're all make sense and stay there may only come back and
[02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:56.960]  flush out he's saying trump's gonna work with them around the u.s obama will be at the un because
[02:50:56.960 --> 02:51:01.680]  that is an angle i want to discuss with g ever to stay with us hey everyone with 20 plus years as a
[02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:07.120]  radio host i've seen about everything one thing that keeps recurring though are these time share
[02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:13.280]  charlatans these high pressure sales people who get folks to come out to some resort for a special
[02:51:13.280 --> 02:51:17.760]  weekend offer then they get them in a corner and browbeat them and coerce them into buying a time
[02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:22.080]  share they don't need they don't want they can't afford and then they're stuck with that thing forever
[02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:27.440]  monthly payments mortgage payments annual fees that keep going up and up well up until recently
[02:51:27.440 --> 02:51:30.960]  people thought they couldn't get rid of these things you know you can't get out of the contract

[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:32.000]  does but paul is particularly hard nose and focused let's go back to sherry sherry crystallize what
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:36.160]  you're saying i mean i get what you're saying about obama and the un it's no secret that hillary
[02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:41.040]  wants that bill clinton wants it obama wants it he's been positioning himself for that for a long
[02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:47.360]  time uh tony blare wants to be the head of the un these globalist leaders they want to graduate
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:53.840]  you know out of the nation state to the international so that's part of the scam but are
[02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:59.920]  you saying trump's involved in that or what were you saying oh not at all i i'm just saying that
[02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:05.040]  right now when they have all this riot and everything happening against trump industry
[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:13.200]  is well thought out because what's happening in here it makes so much sense to me that if if the
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:19.280]  obama becomes head of un he's not going to be able to do that if the america are strong
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:24.480]  or the people are against all of them absolutely absolutely because the entrée is to bring us
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:28.880]  pulling into the world government for obama or others be rewarded that's an important part of
[02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:34.160]  this i mean the strong cities initiative with the justice department admits putting cities under
[02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:40.400]  unedict i mean it's just unprecedented g edward well it is unprecedented but not surprising
[02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:44.720]  because they've been predicting it for a long time they've you know written about how it's this has
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:50.160]  to evolve and they've said that you don't build a world government all at once you have to build
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:58.000]  piecemeal and you have to do it in such a way that those people who are being inconvenienced by it
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:03.520]  who are giving up certain prerogatives giving up liberties giving up property rights and so forth
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:07.680]  it's a little piecemeal so that they don't object to it and they'll take a little bit of it whereas
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:12.080]  they wouldn't take a lot of it all at once so we know that's the strategy to do it in a gradual
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:16.320]  direction they sell it in the quote minority areas on the border and things like we'll stop
[02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:23.360]  the bad cops we'll stop people being mean to you the un is here it's just so sick uh let's talk to
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:29.920]  pat in florida you're on the air with gebra griffin go ahead yes hello wow what an incredible
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:36.960]  honor it is to speak with you mr griffin and alex jones my goodness you guys are awesome
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:42.160]  sweetheart you're awesome what's your point my well i've got a couple of questions for you
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:50.160]  what can a single woman do who owns a house uh you know just do to prepare for all this i've
[02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:56.000]  bought a lot of your products i got the water filter um i think i'm preparing but well that's
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:00.160]  just healthy not drink a bunch of poison water but but yes and support the broadcast thank you
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:05.200]  what can you do i would say number one meet local like-minded people that are into liberty
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:10.960]  get involved in issues and and having friends you can count on each other that's the truest
[02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:15.200]  safety net of anything out there have a garden you're already you know getting healthier i mean
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:21.760]  that right there g edward yes i agree that's the first step is to not be alone you've got to find
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:28.720]  people who are like-minded and but once you get your your security in place and it's a defensive
[02:57:28.720 --> 02:57:34.240]  mode that you have to take first now i think in order to look at the long view we have to push back
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:39.200]  we have to not just defend ourselves but counter attack we have to take the initiative we must
[02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:45.280]  uh look at a plan where we can recapture this system we can get the collectivist mentality
[02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:49.600]  out of it and replace it with people who have no let me ask you this great point what about the
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:54.160]  tactic where they infiltrate act like they're patriots and then are really communist socialists
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:59.920]  and fascists we won't do that as moral people i couldn't do make that but i have to know some
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:04.000]  people are actually going that route now in the military you name it and there are people what
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:08.320]  you call sleeper cells not to do crimes but to fight the takeover people that have actually

[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:55.040]  ahead hello thank you g ever griffon you inspired me uh since you were in that movie uh invisible
[03:00:55.040 --> 03:01:01.520]  empire you said that even labor leaders were part of the cfr and the secret society so i went
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:07.360]  i did research and i found that out it's true walter ruther was at a 1966 bill deberg meeting in
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:12.480]  germany and what my question is for you is let's say they have another bill deberg meeting in
[03:01:12.480 --> 03:01:19.120]  chantilly virginia at the maria if we all went and protested there and trump went and did a rally
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:25.920]  protest in front of the maria would you then change your mind about him you know uh i i don't
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:31.440]  forget i'm not really anti trump i'm simply saying that he's not a candidate that i would
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:38.560]  vote for because he doesn't represent my point of view i think mr trump is is a very shrewd
[03:01:38.560 --> 03:01:45.360]  person in that he knows what is upsetting the american people and he has put himself forth
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:50.960]  to say i agree with you i too am upset i do i too do not like the builder burgers i too do not like
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:56.800]  the cfr you know things like he'll say anything and uh he pretty much told us that in the early
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:01.280]  days of his campaign he said i will say anything to be elected he didn't say it in that many words
[03:02:01.280 --> 03:02:05.520]  but he said you know i know how to get things done i i work with both sides i contribute both the
[03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:09.120]  republicans and the democrats he said i'll work with them both doesn't make a difference to me
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:14.080]  because i know how to get things done so he in that statement he told us that he has no political
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:19.040]  principles at all just how to get things done and so to get elected he'll do whatever he needs to do
[03:02:19.040 --> 03:02:24.800]  to get elected and he'll he'll stand with any group that he thinks will send him votes now
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:29.120]  that's not the kind of guy i would vote for now i'm not anti trump at all because i think maybe
[03:02:29.120 --> 03:02:35.840]  he does get things done but what i don't don't in a in a true constitutional free market fashion
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:40.800]  exactly that's the whole point that issue is never discussed so when i when i vote for somebody i
[03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:44.720]  want to vote for somebody that represents the principles in which i believe otherwise it's
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:49.440]  a wasted vote sure there's something they're afraid of him on and and i've been told what it is i mean
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:54.480]  they say no he knows all this stuff and uh you know he knows about the fellow reserve the whole
[03:02:54.480 --> 03:02:59.600]  nine yards and that uh he says get things done he means you know turn the economy back on not do
[03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:04.400]  one-sided trade deals i think that's why david night's even supporting him now because clearly
[03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:09.120]  he's going against that key globalist rail where we make all these bad deals and sell our country
[03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:13.760]  out thank you james uh let's go ahead and go to cherry in minnesota you're on the air whiz you
[03:03:13.760 --> 03:03:21.920]  have a griffin go ahead yeah hi dr how are you guys go ahead okay anyway listen um i know your
[03:03:21.920 --> 03:03:27.440]  credentials uh alec and i've heard the doctors um i appreciate both um both your points my
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:32.480]  credentials are basically i'm one of the election of god um as far as trump is concerned um this is
[03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:37.440]  what my uh my take on it is um there's nothing more powerful than that bible because everything's
[03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:41.200]  in there so i don't know why people run around this planet looking for the needle in the haystack
[03:03:41.200 --> 03:03:45.600]  when sitting on most shelves as far as trump is trump's going to be president this is why
[03:03:45.600 --> 03:03:50.480]  there's no other there's no other entity in the political uh arena around this planet
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:54.720]  that could actually cause a deadly wound to the political system except for trump
[03:03:54.720 --> 03:03:59.440]  it's going down that way and and if you understand the parable of the victory it sets up the last
[03:03:59.440 --> 03:04:04.560]  generation and everybody knows that here i was even got a question comment for griffin if you
[03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:08.080]  want to even hold over what's in the talk to you but i want to try to get his response here at the
[03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:13.040]  end there are so many good christian people and i myself am a christian who interpret constantly
[03:04:13.040 --> 03:04:17.040]  the end of the world or this is this or this or that christ said constantly don't try to
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:20.880]  know the hour of the time only god knows that but all these preachers get on tv and say they
[03:04:20.880 --> 03:04:25.600]  know when the date is and it really discredits things i'm not saying the guy's wrong all i'm
[03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:30.720]  saying is interpreting this interpreting that it's it's just i think the bible says that's up to god
[03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:38.880]  isn't it g ebbard oh well yes i i think too i i don't consider myself to be qualified in the
[03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:44.560]  theological field i think uh i think people get into trouble when they try and measure
[03:04:44.560 --> 03:04:49.840]  events uh with that the art state absolutely well listen your website people need to join

[03:11:11.360 --> 03:11:16.800]  england to paul joseph watson paul first off tells what's coming up today and then i wanted to talk
[03:11:16.800 --> 03:11:22.320]  to you about a few things why do you think they're really this scared of trump and do you think that
[03:11:22.320 --> 03:11:28.720]  when dr corcy and roger stone and a bunch of other insiders before i was told us over a year ago
[03:11:28.720 --> 03:11:32.480]  there's no way this was planted by these people to tell me this because some of them are folks i've
[03:11:32.480 --> 03:11:36.480]  known in austin for many years wealthy folks that are well known to be friends with trump
[03:11:36.480 --> 03:11:41.520]  and they said man you don't know that trump is the you know the mainstreaming of what you do
[03:11:41.520 --> 03:11:47.040]  and that you're like the underground and like he's the you know operational person and that he knows
[03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:52.720]  all this like you ought to really talk to donald trump man he he knows and so he's like yeah i have
[03:11:52.720 --> 03:11:57.200]  to buy these politicians they take over my business it's legal i do it i don't like it yeah i don't
[03:11:57.200 --> 03:12:02.000]  like the fact that you can't compete men make stuff in america i want to change that i mean for some
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:07.120]  reason he's got him so scared so what's coming up today and why are they so scared of trump or
[03:12:07.120 --> 03:12:14.240]  or is it some elaborate double faint where they're they know that we're anti-establishment and so by
[03:12:14.240 --> 03:12:20.320]  attacking him they really want him elected i mean i just don't buy that well i think you
[03:12:20.320 --> 03:12:27.200]  know donald trump was created by the left by social justice warriors i mean they made themselves
[03:12:27.200 --> 03:12:32.480]  so hate worthy with their behavior and their activity which is now being emphasized at all
[03:12:32.480 --> 03:12:38.800]  these rallies where they're punching police horses they're wearing t-shirts that say if you vote trump
[03:12:38.800 --> 03:12:44.720]  you get jumped blocking ambulances blocking highways people are sick of that behavior they've
[03:12:44.720 --> 03:12:51.360]  been sick of it for years now so the reaction was this rush of support towards trump so it didn't
[03:12:51.360 --> 03:12:56.240]  really matter what his policies were and yes he's flip-flopped on a lot of issues just the sheer
[03:12:56.240 --> 03:13:03.200]  hatred engendered by these progressives who aren't progressives they're actually fascist behavior
[03:13:03.200 --> 03:13:08.080]  has created this rush of support for trump so it's it's not a debate where there is trump
[03:13:08.080 --> 03:13:12.400]  a good guy is he going to follow through on what he says what are his actual policies
[03:13:12.400 --> 03:13:17.920]  that's not what created the phenomenon of trump what created it was the sheer hatred
[03:13:17.920 --> 03:13:23.520]  towards social justice warriors and leftists and the new breed of fascists which is what they are
[03:13:23.520 --> 03:13:28.720]  because those people are so low that you know there's an equal and opposite reaction and
[03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:34.400]  trump represents the backlash to that that's why he's so popular so really they've only
[03:13:34.400 --> 03:13:40.880]  got themselves to blame now they're freaking out they're rioting and staging violence and of
[03:13:40.880 --> 03:13:47.280]  course blaming the victim and now the media is going along with that and again that was emphasized
[03:13:47.280 --> 03:13:54.320]  last week while you had the all right poll skype just broke up momentarily let me interrupt is
[03:13:54.320 --> 03:14:01.440]  your skype broke out the the article you wrote on info wars calm and prison planet calm of this
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:07.280]  of this woman poll your skype's breaking up hold a moment of this man woman whatever it is
[03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:13.520]  with a bunch of muslims attacking the police slapping the police force i mean doesn't this
[03:14:13.520 --> 03:14:17.840]  transgender person gets that in these muslim countries they'd be stoned to death i don't
[03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:25.520]  get why the liberal trendies just worship radical islam what is wrong with these screwballs paul
[03:14:29.520 --> 03:14:34.240]  yes his skype did continue to degenerate and just lost him we're gonna get paul back on well i guess
[03:14:34.240 --> 03:14:39.760]  it's a good thing when i came into the fourth hour with him i just had a lark to do it because his
[03:14:39.760 --> 03:14:44.640]  skype has degraded and cut out doesn't normally happen with the skype it's i was able to host
[03:14:44.640 --> 03:14:49.840]  host the show i for months whenever he would host the show he has money in here for backup in
[03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:55.040]  case it did but it never happened so now now it's happening i wouldn't have been here we just want
[03:14:55.040 --> 03:15:05.840]  to play the clip or something but it's just crazy to see what a television culture and a pop culture
[03:15:05.840 --> 03:15:13.920]  has done with these confused crazy mentally ill looking people stumbling around
[03:15:16.800 --> 03:15:22.880]  and then you've got muslims that basically keep their lives on leashes with feminist patting them
[03:15:22.880 --> 03:15:29.920]  on the head i mean these are just the most disingenuous oxymoronic hypocritical i don't
[03:15:29.920 --> 03:15:34.320]  have words to describe it you have to go out and see them for yourself the hissing the spitting the
[03:15:34.320 --> 03:15:40.000]  hatred it's like this black cop said i've never seen anyone so hateful in tucson anyone punching
[03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:45.200]  and spitting and kicking trying to get beat up and then it's donald trump's fault when they do it
[03:15:45.200 --> 03:15:51.200]  right paul wassen yeah that's that the entire median narrative is now to blame trump when you've
[03:15:51.200 --> 03:15:57.440]  got these people punching police horses blocking highways go and look at the soros agitator who
[03:15:57.440 --> 03:16:04.240]  was behind this highway shut down in arizona she's a woman called jacinta gonzález look at
[03:16:04.240 --> 03:16:11.280]  the thousand-yard stare in her eyes she's got a neck changed to a truck she looks like an extra
[03:16:11.280 --> 03:16:18.160]  out of children of the corn i mean just look at the glazed insane unhinged lock on her face we
[03:16:18.160 --> 03:16:23.440]  want to pull her up what article is she in this is the gateway pundit lead organizer who shut down
[03:16:23.440 --> 03:16:29.120]  highway to trump rally is soros fellow and then if you scroll down in that article there are two
[03:16:29.120 --> 03:16:33.920]  pictures the second pictures why do we allow a nazi collaborator to run around trying to overthrow
[03:16:33.920 --> 03:16:37.680]  our country when we know he's never thrown other countries i mean this guy should be kicked out
[03:16:37.680 --> 03:16:43.840]  of here and banned like russia has done immediately yeah and if you go on to the actual gateway
[03:16:43.840 --> 03:16:49.520]  pundit article you can see the glazed thousand-yard stare in her eyes she looks like children of the
[03:16:49.520 --> 03:16:55.600]  corn it's this this really illustrates what these people are all about then you had the rapper and
[03:16:55.600 --> 03:17:01.200]  prominent black lives matter activists who said we're gonna riot if trump wins then he deleted
[03:17:01.200 --> 03:17:07.120]  his tweet and claimed that somebody had made it up or somebody had hijacked his phone again these
[03:17:07.120 --> 03:17:12.480]  people say these things they threaten violence they stage violence and then they blame it on the
[03:17:12.480 --> 03:17:17.200]  victim and say that you're a racist because you made this up when the one about the trump tower
[03:17:17.200 --> 03:17:22.160]  people with red flags saying we're gonna kill you and your children yeah they carry around these
[03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:28.160]  communist red flags 200 million people dead as a result of communism last century alone but that's
[03:17:28.160 --> 03:17:35.200]  tolerant that's liberal and the media gives these people cover every time as that black cop said
[03:17:35.200 --> 03:17:41.680]  they're the most violent spiteful hateful people you could ever wish to me and i should know because
[03:17:41.680 --> 03:17:46.800]  i deal with them every day you should know because you met them out of the red gods protest there in
[03:17:46.800 --> 03:17:53.120]  austin these are the most despicable people and yet the media you know exhibits them as they literally
[03:17:53.120 --> 03:18:00.160]  go i'm fat i'm ugly i have hair under my arms i stink i love satan i love killing babies yeah and
[03:18:00.160 --> 03:18:06.560]  they've got the nerve to grandstand and have all this fake you know righteous indignation you don't
[03:18:06.560 --> 03:18:12.240]  have the moral high ground when you're waving a flag that's responsible for the death of 200 million
[03:18:12.240 --> 03:18:17.280]  people i'm sorry you don't have the moral high and they're trying to intimidate our free speech
[03:18:17.280 --> 03:18:21.840]  i'm all for free speech when people start calling for violence and organized crime it's not speech
[03:18:21.840 --> 03:18:27.280]  it's organized racketeering it's a criminal subversion and they need to be dealt with at this
[03:18:27.280 --> 03:18:33.200]  point and i'll expand on that mexico's saying we're going to have our illegals get licenses in vote
[03:18:33.200 --> 03:18:37.680]  china involved i mean i've never seen such a ganging up on our country and i look at england
[03:18:37.680 --> 03:18:45.120]  you're run by the eu even your own liberal mayor of london says it's wrong no it's amazing and if
[03:18:45.120 --> 03:18:50.560]  you're blocking a highway you're preventing people from peaceably assembling you're blocking their
[03:18:50.560 --> 03:18:56.800]  free speech you're imposing your will to infringe on their rights that's not the first amendment you
[03:18:56.800 --> 03:19:04.320]  don't have that right but the media still frames this as protesters they're not protesters they're
[03:19:04.320 --> 03:19:10.160]  agitators they're preventing other people from expressing their rights to peaceably assemble
[03:19:10.160 --> 03:19:16.000]  and it was a private event again so it is not your first amendment right to stop other people from
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:21.360]  having their free speech no matter what the media narrative is which it continues to be these are
[03:19:21.360 --> 03:19:27.200]  just protesters any violence that happens is donald trump's fault even though it's being staged by
[03:19:27.200 --> 03:19:33.280]  these crazy literal guy with an oxygen tank and a white cat who is the latest james bond villain
[03:19:34.080 --> 03:19:39.520]  i mean on record george soros is the new villain of the james bond movie and then he is running
[03:19:39.520 --> 03:19:46.480]  communist groups i mean that nazi collaborator needs to be thrown out of this country paul i'm

[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:37.840]  but we're going to dive into this news bright bar reports migrant gangs lead severed head on
[03:24:37.840 --> 03:24:43.440]  amsterdam street in amsterdam a severed head was found laying in the open street it's just the
[03:24:43.440 --> 03:24:49.520]  latest gruesome murder in what is being called the mokro war involving north african migrants
[03:24:49.520 --> 03:24:56.080]  from morocco so you've got all these migrant gangs from afghanistan from siria from morocco
[03:24:56.640 --> 03:25:03.680]  not only attacking europeans but attacking each other you see it every day in these migrant camps
[03:25:03.680 --> 03:25:10.080]  now they've found a severed head on the streets of amsterdam more cultural enrichment i guess the
[03:25:10.080 --> 03:25:17.200]  answer is just to keep the borders open and let in a million more bright bar also reports journalist
[03:25:17.200 --> 03:25:25.360]  punch kicked and rammed with car in sweden's little mogadishu no gozo now excuse me but i was told
[03:25:25.360 --> 03:25:32.640]  by the media for about two three years running that muslim no go gettoes don't exist they're a
[03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:39.520]  conspiracy theory they don't exist even though myself joe biggs and michael zimmerman walked
[03:25:39.520 --> 03:25:46.400]  directly through one and got chased away in mollenbeek again these muslim no go areas don't exist
[03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:53.120]  even though the swedish film crew went to do some recording in one and within a minute and a half
[03:25:53.120 --> 03:25:59.120]  and you can watch this video in the article it's at the bottom of the article within 90 seconds of
[03:25:59.120 --> 03:26:05.920]  them arriving in this muslim no go getto which doesn't exist and is a conspiracy theory they're
[03:26:05.920 --> 03:26:12.880]  verbally assaulted and then physically assaulted by these migrants one of the cameramen is run over
[03:26:13.600 --> 03:26:19.040]  by one of these migrants who then speeds off in the car they then call the police the police say
[03:26:19.040 --> 03:26:24.640]  oh we can't be seen to be protecting you because then they'll attack us that's why they don't go
[03:26:24.640 --> 03:26:29.440]  into these areas in the first place because the police get attacked so the police stay off in the
[03:26:29.440 --> 03:26:36.480]  distance this film crew walks through this shopping square in this swedish town and again within
[03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:43.760]  minutes they're verbally assaulted and then again violently assaulted somebody else is punched in the
[03:26:43.760 --> 03:26:51.440]  face in this muslim getto this muslim no go zone that again according to the media does not exist
[03:26:51.440 --> 03:26:56.800]  just like the one in mollenbeek doesn't exist and we didn't get chased out of it none of that ever
[03:26:56.800 --> 03:27:03.520]  happened well of course they caught one of the paris massacre terrorists in mollenbeek which
[03:27:03.520 --> 03:27:10.720]  doesn't exist and is a conspiracy theory just a few days ago salah abdeslam he'd been hiding there
[03:27:10.720 --> 03:27:16.480]  for months and they only just caught him and why is that well because as reuters reports
[03:27:16.480 --> 03:27:23.920]  paris fugitive helped more by friends and neighbors than islamic state so again after every single
[03:27:23.920 --> 03:27:30.400]  terror attack we hear this often repeated narrative in the media not all muslims are terrorists well
[03:27:30.400 --> 03:27:37.600]  that's true but unfortunately a lot of them are islamists and a lot of them as we see in mollenbeek
[03:27:37.600 --> 03:27:45.120]  will actually protect terrorists after the paris attack security forces searches searched far and
[03:27:45.120 --> 03:27:51.520]  wide for prime suspects law abdeslam who vanished after returning to brussels believing islamic
[03:27:51.520 --> 03:27:56.640]  state could have spirited him away to turkey syria or morocco remember this is the guy who
[03:27:57.360 --> 03:28:03.680]  was driving back from the paris massacre he was supposed to blow himself up they actually caught
[03:28:03.680 --> 03:28:08.560]  him they apprehended the car the police did but let him go again so he was able to sneak back
[03:28:08.560 --> 03:28:15.600]  into mollenbeek the g had his ghetto in brussels belgium and it appears that europe's most wanted
[03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:21.600]  man never left the belgian capital and it was family friends and petty criminals who helped
[03:28:21.600 --> 03:28:26.720]  him evade a manhunt for four months before he was arrested on friday in the neighborhood he
[03:28:26.720 --> 03:28:33.120]  grew up in not from from his parents home so he's basically been in mollenbeek for the past four
[03:28:33.120 --> 03:28:39.920]  months living in someone's basement and because not one single resident of that g had his ghetto
[03:28:39.920 --> 03:28:46.160]  which doesn't exist and is a conspiracy theory not a single one of them alerted the police to
[03:28:46.160 --> 03:28:52.480]  his presence because it's a police no go zone there were no police whatsoever when we walked
[03:28:52.480 --> 03:28:59.600]  through it the day after the raid which caught the mastermind behind the paris massacre so not
[03:28:59.600 --> 03:29:05.600]  a single neighbor or friend alerted authorities to the fact that this guy europe's most wanted
[03:29:05.600 --> 03:29:11.840]  terrorist was there for the past four months and in fact when the police actually went to arrest him
[03:29:11.840 --> 03:29:18.560]  this is out of the express missiles thrown at police in mollenbeek by sular abdeslam supporters
[03:29:18.560 --> 03:29:25.200]  they're sick hero so they went to arrest the guy responsible for the massacre of dozens and dozens
[03:29:25.200 --> 03:29:31.760]  of innocent people in paris and the uh gentle tolerant people of mollenbeek the g had his ghetto
[03:29:31.760 --> 03:29:38.400]  that doesn't exist and is a conspiracy theory they attacked the police and hailed the paris massacre

[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:26.960]  that the majority of americans say they'd like to punch trump full in the face again this is the
[03:34:26.960 --> 03:34:35.120]  tolerant nonviolent peaceful anti-trump protesters who like to block ambulances and punch horses in
[03:34:35.120 --> 03:34:40.320]  the face they're really peaceful paul reveals that majority of americans would like to smack
[03:34:40.320 --> 03:34:45.600]  donald trump in the face with their fists according to the findings by wallet hub
[03:34:45.600 --> 03:34:51.600]  54 percent of respondents said they love to hit trump in the marsh trump's punchability
[03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:57.360]  ranks way higher than hillary clinton who was placed second in the survey with 14 percent of votes
[03:34:57.360 --> 03:35:05.440]  president obama is down on 13 percent while any congressman is placed in fourth with 12 percent
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:14.960]  so by and i mean trump even beats tax attorneys in accountants so even even the punchability
[03:35:14.960 --> 03:35:20.560]  of hillary clinton doesn't quite come up to the standard of donald trump so again it emphasizes
[03:35:20.560 --> 03:35:26.000]  the point that many of the people opposing donald trump are violent and intolerant people
[03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:33.760]  while the media portrays them as being peaceful protesters we've also got this article up on
[03:35:33.760 --> 03:35:40.320]  info wars dot com anti-trump protestor who slapped police horse describes herself as a commie feminist
[03:35:41.120 --> 03:35:45.520]  the anti-trump protestor arrested in kansas city for physically attacking a police horse
[03:35:45.520 --> 03:35:51.840]  describes herself as a commie feminist this was on her own instagram bio and you've probably seen
[03:35:51.840 --> 03:35:57.760]  the video by now if you haven't it's in the article but it's 29 year old april j foster who was
[03:35:57.760 --> 03:36:04.640]  basically she was at this rally in kansas city waving a giant communist red flag the political
[03:36:04.640 --> 03:36:09.360]  system responsible for the deaths of 200 million people in the last century because she's really
[03:36:09.360 --> 03:36:17.040]  peaceful and she starts screaming and yelling at this police horse as if that's going to do any
[03:36:17.040 --> 03:36:23.120]  as if she's going to intimidate the police horse into backing away or something then she
[03:36:23.120 --> 03:36:30.320]  slaps it in the face now peter has come out and condemned this but in her own bio foster described
[03:36:30.320 --> 03:36:38.640]  herself as a commie feminist these are the peaceful protesters who the leftist media has given cover
[03:36:38.640 --> 03:36:46.160]  to you know describe them as tolerant reasonable rational people when they're the ones engaging
[03:36:46.160 --> 03:36:54.240]  in violence as i mentioned earlier lead organizer who shut down highway to trump rally is a soros
[03:36:54.240 --> 03:36:59.760]  fellow from new orleans yesterday four left open border activists shut down the highway leading
[03:36:59.760 --> 03:37:06.960]  to the trump rally in fountain hills arizona for two hours so if you are dying in an ambulance
[03:37:06.960 --> 03:37:12.560]  and you wanted to get through that highway well tough luck because though a social justice warriors
[03:37:12.560 --> 03:37:18.240]  they're carrying signs that said donald trump is a racist and that's more important than sick
[03:37:18.240 --> 03:37:24.560]  and injured people getting to the hospital because these are really really pleasant people now look
[03:37:24.560 --> 03:37:31.200]  at this picture just into gonzalez this is the lead organizer behind this protest the shut down
[03:37:31.200 --> 03:37:38.240]  the highway to block other people from expressing their free speech okay that's not your first
[03:37:38.240 --> 03:37:44.480]  amendment right to block other people from exercising their right you're imposing on their
[03:37:44.480 --> 03:37:51.040]  rights that's not a freedom that you have and just take a look at this picture of just sinter
[03:37:51.040 --> 03:37:58.800]  gonzalez i mean talk about children of the corn she's tied herself by the neck to this vehicle
[03:37:59.840 --> 03:38:06.720]  and she's got the thousand-yard stare the typical glazed unhinged social justice warrior look
[03:38:06.720 --> 03:38:12.880]  look this just completely emphasizes what these people are all about now let me let me know if
[03:38:12.880 --> 03:38:19.280]  you've got the guest ready by the way but we'll continue with news two song cop anti-trump protesters
[03:38:19.280 --> 03:38:24.560]  most hateful people i've ever seen now you've probably seen this video up on informers.com
[03:38:24.560 --> 03:38:31.120]  it's a 10 minute video of a cop who went to a donald trump rally as a neutral observer
[03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:36.880]  just to try and get a sense of what this was all about he's seen the media portrayals he's seen
[03:38:36.880 --> 03:38:44.320]  the narrative of trump people as violent unhinged dangerous people he found out that the opposite
[03:38:44.320 --> 03:38:48.640]  was true so you can go and watch that video on informers.com but we've got our guest now
[03:38:49.520 --> 03:38:54.000]  syrian girl who of course she's been on the show today before geopolitical analysts and
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:59.840]  contribute to neo-journal and spotnik international now syrian girl we haven't got much time so i'll
[03:38:59.840 --> 03:39:05.200]  go straight to the first question now you're a muslim of course donald trump who opposed the
[03:39:05.200 --> 03:39:10.240]  iraq war from the start has called for a temporary ban on muslims entering the us due to terrorism
[03:39:10.240 --> 03:39:17.040]  concerns he was called a hateful bigger for doing so hillary clinton on the other hand
[03:39:17.040 --> 03:39:22.720]  voted for a war which killed nearly a million muslims she oversaw a policy in libya and syria
[03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:27.680]  which ruined those two countries and led to the international migrant crisis who's the
[03:39:27.680 --> 03:39:33.520]  bigger threat to muslims in your view is it donald trump or is it hillary clinton it's of
[03:39:33.520 --> 03:39:39.920]  course hillary clinton you know trump can say whatever he wants about syrians or muslims
[03:39:39.920 --> 03:39:47.360]  he can insult every curse word but at least he's not actually killing us like hillary clinton
[03:39:47.360 --> 03:39:52.640]  and you know hillary clinton has shown herself to be the psychopath she led to the rise of ices
[03:39:52.640 --> 03:39:57.920]  but it just so happens that bill berg have chosen her to be the us president and that's
[03:39:58.640 --> 03:40:04.800]  obviously the reason why trump is being attacked in the media and he says if he says what he says
[03:40:04.800 --> 03:40:10.080]  he will do um he will overturn the tables on the globalists he says he wants to get out of the
[03:40:10.080 --> 03:40:15.840]  business of regime change um it's ironic because it seems to be that they're regime changing him
[03:40:15.840 --> 03:40:22.720]  and just in a typical fashion you know dorge soros funded protesters are accusing him of attacking
[03:40:23.360 --> 03:40:27.040]  you know protesters he's not even the president yet and they're already trying to do it
[03:40:29.120 --> 03:40:36.320]  and i mean not the police go ahead just one one other thing you know the idea of the people
[03:40:36.320 --> 03:40:43.440]  coming in to the states with claiming to be syrian refugees with syrian passports as we know
[03:40:43.440 --> 03:40:48.640]  these many syrian passports that are fake and i don't want to hear another story in the media
[03:40:48.640 --> 03:40:55.280]  about a fake syrian passport being found near a terrorist attack so the only real way to vet
[03:40:55.280 --> 03:41:02.400]  people going into the states is to ask the syrian government if the number the number on the passport
[03:41:02.400 --> 03:41:08.960]  is real and that requires actually opening diplomatic channels which clinton and co have
[03:41:08.960 --> 03:41:15.680]  refused to do um and in obama so uh that is you know what i'm trying to say is as well as
[03:41:15.680 --> 03:41:23.840]  there's a sanity in what trump is saying and that's why he's attracted more support amongst
[03:41:23.840 --> 03:41:28.320]  muslims in the u.s than all the other g.o.p candidates combined and that was a poll out of
[03:41:28.320 --> 03:41:33.840]  care the you know islamic relations organization in america and that was when marco rubio was
[03:41:33.840 --> 03:41:39.280]  still involved in that race though if he's such a massive islamophobe why is he attracting more
[03:41:39.280 --> 03:41:43.440]  support from muslims than the other candidates well it's obvious because of the reasons you
[03:41:43.440 --> 03:41:48.960]  just outlined but moving on of course russia recently pulled out of syria saying it had
[03:41:48.960 --> 03:41:55.040]  accomplished its mission the suddenness of that announcement took a lot of people by surprise
[03:41:55.600 --> 03:42:01.440]  hooten says that you know mosco can go back in with fighter jets very quickly if necessary
[03:42:01.440 --> 03:42:08.000]  but explain to the audience the wider geopolitical calculations behind this russian pullout
[03:42:09.360 --> 03:42:15.680]  well there's been a lot of reasons that could possibly be the cause you know from the start
[03:42:15.680 --> 03:42:20.240]  they'd already outlined that the operation would last three to four months so it shouldn't
[03:42:20.240 --> 03:42:25.360]  come as too much of a surprise that they pulled out they said that it would be this short it's
[03:42:25.360 --> 03:42:30.720]  probably because of the amount of money that it takes to invest in such a pullout and the fact
[03:42:30.720 --> 03:42:36.960]  that they'd already sort of changed the situation on the ground it could also have to do with
[03:42:36.960 --> 03:42:44.320]  negotiations in geneva and trying to you know deescalate there's also been talk about at the
[03:42:44.320 --> 03:42:51.280]  same time as this pullout talk about federalizing syria and i'd like to make some points about that
[03:42:52.480 --> 03:42:58.080]  yeah that's why i've read it just before the show writers is reporting that Kurdish forces
[03:42:58.080 --> 03:43:03.040]  are now moving towards declaring an autonomous federal state in that region of northern syria
[03:43:03.040 --> 03:43:08.880]  which they now control of course they've been battling isis but you claim that in some cases
[03:43:08.880 --> 03:43:14.640]  the Kurds are now resorting to isis-style atrocities tell us what's happening and why it hasn't
[03:43:14.640 --> 03:43:20.800]  received much media coverage well in the first place the plans to balkana syria were made public
[03:43:20.800 --> 03:43:28.800]  by gonzalez arise in 2006 and the reason why the Kurds have been so positively shown in the media
[03:43:28.800 --> 03:43:33.280]  without any of the negative aspects shown is because they fit this objective but in reality
[03:43:34.080 --> 03:43:41.200]  the Kurds in northwest of syria came to syria as illegal immigrants in the 1920s when the
[03:43:41.200 --> 03:43:46.880]  turkish atatürk at the time hired them to slaughter the assyrian christians which are
[03:43:46.880 --> 03:43:53.200]  actually the original inhabitants of that area and you wouldn't hear that from the mainstream media
[03:43:53.200 --> 03:44:00.160]  the fact that the Kurds in north syria are actually a minority there and that many of the
[03:44:00.160 --> 03:44:04.960]  people they live amongst are actually assyrian christians and arabiduans and they're oppressing
[03:44:04.960 --> 03:44:11.040]  the assyrian christians they've been vandalizing the assyrian christian history because it reminds
[03:44:11.040 --> 03:44:18.560]  people that it is the assyrians that are historically owning that land and the Kurds are only here
[03:44:18.560 --> 03:44:25.760]  since the 1920s in al-hasakeh and they make they're still a minority so it boggles the mind
[03:44:25.760 --> 03:44:30.560]  that people would support giving a minority of people six percent of syria's population
[03:44:30.560 --> 03:44:40.880]  all of syria's oil the Kurds are iranian sunni nomads that walked across from iran across
[03:44:40.880 --> 03:44:48.320]  into iraq across into turkey and now a little part of syria and you know letting in illegal
[03:44:48.320 --> 03:44:56.240]  immigrants has now resulted in them claiming our land and everybody seems to be uploading this is
[03:44:56.240 --> 03:45:04.880]  quite ironic and the the fact that the assyrian history is not even being shown in the media
[03:45:04.880 --> 03:45:12.320]  because it breaks this agenda now reuters is reporting us dismisses russia call for urgent
[03:45:12.320 --> 03:45:17.120]  talks on syria ceasefire the united states on monday rejected russia's call for an urgent
[03:45:17.120 --> 03:45:22.240]  meeting over violations of syria's three-week cessation of hostilities saying that its concerns
[03:45:22.240 --> 03:45:27.680]  were already being handled in a constructive manner is this ceasefire genuine is it going to
[03:45:27.680 --> 03:45:34.000]  hold and what's the immediate future look like for syria are we seeing the end finally of this
[03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:40.880]  civil war in syria unfortunately i don't think so i think it's probably going to go on for a few
[03:45:40.880 --> 03:45:46.960]  many years to come um and unfortunately you know these these people who want to tear the
[03:45:46.960 --> 03:45:55.520]  fabric of nations and push sectarianism everywhere and basically carve out mini states they they
[03:45:55.520 --> 03:46:01.040]  really um they don't want to let go and the syrian military has been fighting us is now for five
[03:46:01.040 --> 03:46:10.080]  years unfortunately i think that it's going to continue okay now where can people find
[03:46:10.080 --> 03:46:17.760]  more information about your reports about this information please add yourself to my youtube

[03:46:46.720 --> 03:46:52.640]  security after threats to family and violent protests that's right violent protest now of course
[03:46:53.360 --> 03:46:58.720]  one of trump's sons received or his son's wife i believe received some powder in the mail last
[03:46:58.720 --> 03:47:03.920]  week again that was probably donald trump's fault but now there's been an uptick in threats once
[03:47:03.920 --> 03:47:08.880]  again the secret service and the presidential campaign of donald trump are increasing security
[03:47:08.880 --> 03:47:13.120]  for the candidate and his rallies after threatening letters were received by trump family members
[03:47:13.120 --> 03:47:20.480]  and violent protest by leftist broke out a string of several trump rallies nbc news reported
[03:47:20.480 --> 03:47:25.840]  secret services ramping up their presence around donald trump as the joint terrorism task force
[03:47:25.840 --> 03:47:31.040]  investigates a suspicious envelope with the powder that was delivered to trump's son and again
[03:47:31.040 --> 03:47:37.920]  if you go on twitter every single frigging day while the media says that trump is inciting
[03:47:37.920 --> 03:47:46.240]  violence you have violent leftists threatening to assassinate donald trump and yes in most cases
[03:47:46.240 --> 03:47:52.320]  it's just a crass vulgar joke if such a joke was aimed at hillary clinton or obama of course the
[03:47:52.320 --> 03:47:58.240]  leftist media would be up in arms but in some cases these threats are leading to secret service
[03:47:58.240 --> 03:48:05.040]  visits and still the ignorance of these people on twitter the uptick in threats just continues it
[03:48:05.040 --> 03:48:11.360]  accelerates every single day people threatening to assassinate trump so we've got the secret
[03:48:11.360 --> 03:48:17.840]  service now becoming more nervous about his safety now last week we had the story about the top
[03:48:17.840 --> 03:48:25.840]  black lives matter activist deaf po tweeting we will incite riots everywhere if trump wins of
[03:48:25.840 --> 03:48:31.280]  course the update to that as i mentioned briefly earlier in the show was that after he was called
[03:48:31.280 --> 03:48:38.720]  out on this after it got picked up by info wars by bright bar by other news organizations he went
[03:48:38.720 --> 03:48:45.200]  back and claimed that he had never made these comments he was like that's use the n word of
[03:48:45.200 --> 03:48:50.080]  course he was like that's not a word i would ever use i never made this tweet well the problem for
[03:48:50.640 --> 03:48:58.320]  deaf po is that people have the ability to look at archives on twitter this is the internet
[03:48:58.880 --> 03:49:06.640]  it's 2016 anything you post on the internet remains on the internet doesn't matter if you
[03:49:06.640 --> 03:49:12.560]  delete it off your twitter profile so not only did he not apologize for these comments which in
[03:49:12.560 --> 03:49:19.920]  in you know directly inciting riots he lied and claimed that he never made the comments in the
[03:49:19.920 --> 03:49:26.800]  first place and then he retweeted he retweeted he didn't retweet anything he deleted it he
[03:49:26.800 --> 03:49:33.040]  retreated to his safe space he blocked me of course that's the natural inclination of all
[03:49:33.040 --> 03:49:39.760]  social justice warriors when they get called out on their bs they run away and hide but again it
[03:49:39.760 --> 03:49:44.400]  emphasizes the point that this black lives matter group and this is a prominent leader
[03:49:45.200 --> 03:49:49.680]  is a violent hateful group does that mean that all the people who march with black lives matter
[03:49:49.680 --> 03:49:57.680]  of violent and hateful no but when you've got the ideological inspiration behind blm being a convicted
[03:49:57.680 --> 03:50:02.800]  cop killer who is on the fbi's most wanted domestic terrorist list to sartre chicor
[03:50:03.520 --> 03:50:09.280]  then it's a problem imagine if the oregon militia had their ideological inspiration
[03:50:09.280 --> 03:50:16.320]  as timothy mcvey and they were calling for riots and killing cops would the media give them cover
[03:50:16.320 --> 03:50:21.920]  would time magazine come out with articles you know in defense of rioting no they wouldn't
[03:50:22.480 --> 03:50:28.240]  they ignore this and any violence any violent threats that are made by black lives matter
[03:50:28.240 --> 03:50:34.560]  by leftists in general are always blamed of course on donald trump we had another incident at a
[03:50:34.560 --> 03:50:41.200]  donald trump rally the other day where a black donald trump supporter punched one of these leftists
[03:50:41.200 --> 03:50:45.760]  who was agitating in the face of course what they didn't show you was that right next to him
[03:50:45.760 --> 03:50:52.960]  was another leftist wearing a kkk uniform so they always talk about the violence they never talk
[03:50:52.960 --> 03:50:57.920]  about the provocation we'll be back with the final segment of the alex joneshow fourth hour
[03:50:57.920 --> 03:51:04.880]  overdrive don't go away do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain blood pressure

[03:54:08.800 --> 03:54:26.800]  go back to the final segment of the fourth hour of the info wars overdrive on paul joseph artson the washington examiner is reporting sheriffs writ obama silence on murdered police say he backed those that killers despite a 300 percent surge in the shooting deaths of police this year
[03:54:26.800 --> 03:54:47.120]  resident obama has done little to signal his regret leading law enforcement to charge that he is condoning the slayings well he has a microphone in his face almost every moment he's awake and has unprecedented access to the media he could certainly take a moment to acknowledge these events and give us the same support he provides those that attack and killers
[03:54:47.120 --> 03:55:08.800]  carol county md sheriff james t we stole secrets so again you have obama getting up on jimmy kimmel and saying that the ferguson riots were understandable you've got a 300 percent surge in the shooting deaths of police and again he says nothing whatsoever about it
[03:55:08.800 --> 03:55:30.240]  because it doesn't play into this race war division narrative that they're trying to stir in the run up to this election over in germany land of cultural enrichment daily caller reports germany is running out of prison cells because of refugee crisis germany is about to run out of prison cells due to the unprecedented
[03:55:30.240 --> 03:55:54.240]  migrant influx in the country foreigners make up 9 percent of germany's population that's soon to rise but close to 30 percent of its prison population so they're disproportionately more likely to commit crimes that's another racist fact the number is even higher among incarcerated people awaiting trial as there is a risk they will leave the country
[03:55:54.240 --> 03:56:21.600]  the wave of refugees is not without consequence for the german prisons the federal union of prison staff head anton back said in a statement so they have run out of room to house the prisoners because the migrants are disproportionately more likely to commit crimes and therefore be prisoners that's the cultural enrichment of germany and they're going to let in yet more migrants
[03:56:21.600 --> 03:56:34.160]  in sheffield my hometown in england students that have to be shown how to use the toilet top university puts up bizarre warning signs in campus lose after complaints about awful mess
[03:56:34.160 --> 03:56:45.200]  now you can go and look at this picture on the daily mail they're having to put these signs up everywhere throughout this university telling people how to use a toilet
[03:56:45.200 --> 03:57:05.280]  now if you scroll down into the article they're having to do it because well international students don't know how to use the toilet now in india unicef has to have an education program every single year because 600 million people half the population crap in the streets
[03:57:05.280 --> 03:57:25.040]  and it leads to horrible childhood infections and diseases so now they're having to introduce similar educational programs here in the united kingdom because of the increasing influx of migrants and they all should be celebrated again as cultural enrichment if you don't do so
[03:57:25.040 --> 03:57:42.000]  you're a bigger you're a racist even though immigrants is an erase now over in sweden which again is another epicenter of cultural enrichment where film crews get attacked in muslim no-go ghettos that don't exist and are a conspiracy theory
[03:57:42.000 --> 03:58:03.360]  sweden is set to spend more on housing refugees than national defence this is out of zero hedge sweden's refugee crisis has gone through the breaking point even dovish politicians concede the pace of refugee spending which is on track to surpass that for national defence in sweden for the first time this year
[03:58:03.360 --> 03:58:21.680]  can't be sustained without revisions to a social contract based on high taxes cradle to grave entitlement tight regulation and triple a credit though now even the liberals in sweden are saying enough is enough where completely overwhelmed this has to stop
[03:58:21.680 --> 03:58:39.360]  that's going to wrap it up for this fourth hour overdrive of the alex jones show of course alex will be back with the live radio show 11 to 2 tomorrow also be sure to tune into info wars nightly news tonight and check out all the breaking news at info wars dot com
