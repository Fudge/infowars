[00:00.000 --> 00:11.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.640 --> 00:19.200]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.200 --> 00:33.600]  Texas Alex Jones well years ago the CIA connected satire publication Charlie
[00:33.600 --> 00:43.920]  Hebdo based in Paris France put out the now infamous Mohammed jihad cartoons and
[00:43.920 --> 00:51.400]  quite frankly it paled in significance to some of the stuff in Team America well
[00:51.400 --> 00:59.240]  now we've seen the backlash from China on the remake of Red Dawn that film being
[00:59.240 --> 01:04.160]  shelved for a year while China was edited out we've seen the threat of jihadi
[01:04.160 --> 01:08.760]  al Qaeda elements threatening to attack the satirical newspaper over the last
[01:08.760 --> 01:14.960]  few years well they reportedly did it today gun attack on French magazine
[01:14.960 --> 01:19.320]  kills 12 the White House has come out and said that wait a minute let's not
[01:19.320 --> 01:25.960]  call this terrorism just like they did for a few years with the Fort Hood
[01:25.960 --> 01:35.240]  shooting with Major Hassan I was thinking this morning about making a sick
[01:35.240 --> 01:39.920]  joke about the White House but it really wasn't a joke about how soon till
[01:39.920 --> 01:45.920]  they blame the Tea Party for the attack on the newspaper in Paris and then I was
[01:45.920 --> 01:49.840]  going through the news at info wars.com and prison planet.com and drudge
[01:49.840 --> 01:55.000]  report.com and other places and there it was the headline the White House came
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.680]  out and said they're not sure this is terrorism and of course Obama came out
[02:00.680 --> 02:08.440]  and said basically those that slander the Prophet Muhammad better watch it. Here's
[02:08.440 --> 02:12.920]  my issue with this it is a classical part of the Renaissance and Western
[02:12.920 --> 02:22.440]  culture to satirize or lampoon kings queens presidents prime ministers. This
[02:22.440 --> 02:25.720]  is all part of the stage class of civilizations that the project for New
[02:25.720 --> 02:31.080]  American Century talks about. Bring in folks from radical countries allow them
[02:31.080 --> 02:35.960]  to organize have the media demonize anybody that mildly criticizes them
[02:35.960 --> 02:41.440]  then allow these groups to attack and use those attacks as a way to take free
[02:41.440 --> 02:47.920]  speech away as the answer to stopping the problems. Remember Obama when they
[02:47.920 --> 02:55.440]  arrested the maker of the satire film about Muhammad? Now I don't sit here and
[02:55.440 --> 03:01.880]  engage in what I'd call Islamophobia. I don't sit up here and demonize Muslims
[03:01.880 --> 03:05.880]  in general. I understand the clash of civilizations we need to stop that. We
[03:05.880 --> 03:11.560]  need to realize the manipulation the attempt to cause a global civil war. But
[03:11.560 --> 03:16.000]  at the same time we better recognize that radical Islam is taking over the
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.160]  Middle East and Islam so whether it was always radical or it's just radical now
[03:20.160 --> 03:25.400]  isn't even up for debate because it is becoming radicalized and is not
[03:25.400 --> 03:32.280]  tolerating free speech and is allied with the left that demonizes, persecutes, and
[03:32.280 --> 03:37.640]  bans from entering Europe of the UK. Anyone that even mildly criticizes
[03:37.640 --> 03:41.640]  radical Islam like Michael Savage. We'll try to get Michael Savage to
[03:41.640 --> 03:44.840]  pop in. I know he's got his own broadcast to give us his take on this
[03:44.840 --> 03:48.840]  today or tomorrow even if it's 10 minutes. Niko call us producer or I've got a
[03:48.840 --> 03:52.040]  cell phone it's in the computer. Call him see if he wants to pop in for 10
[03:52.040 --> 03:55.960]  minutes. That'd be a favor. Tell him I'm asking him as a favor to give us his
[03:55.960 --> 04:00.000]  take on it because he's someone directly affected by this and when they're
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.760]  done taking Michael Savage's free speech away they're gonna take yours and mine
[04:03.760 --> 04:15.400]  away. I will face it, you will face it. So here's the deal. We call US senators
[04:15.400 --> 04:20.520]  when they talk about restricting free speech fascist monsters. Diane Feinstein
[04:20.520 --> 04:27.120]  was called a fascist by Matt Drudge and rightfully so. Then we have to call
[04:27.120 --> 04:31.640]  radical Islamist and I'm not somebody that's into stunts burning the Korean
[04:31.640 --> 04:35.680]  and stuff like that but at the same time I really think everybody should retweet
[04:35.680 --> 04:40.000]  these images and talk about them in the face of this or we're gonna lose all our
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.840]  free speech. And so maybe for the nightly news tonight I should go through the
[04:44.840 --> 04:49.800]  cartoons on the big screen and just review them for everybody and then
[04:49.800 --> 04:55.600]  review other satirical stuff about Bill Clinton or the Queen of England. Just to
[04:55.600 --> 05:00.400]  discuss the fact that this is free speech. The government's Department of
[05:00.400 --> 05:04.040]  Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time they're
[05:04.040 --> 05:08.240]  restricting civilians rights to own and purchase firearms. Can you put two and
[05:08.240 --> 05:12.720]  two together? Infidel Body Armor can stop every round including hollow points

[06:16.320 --> 06:21.040]  because they are not of the very highest quality or because they're not 100%
[06:21.040 --> 06:25.680]  organic or because they don't ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are

[08:15.920 --> 08:21.840]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the
[08:21.840 --> 08:26.600]  resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[08:39.920 --> 08:45.720]  Dramatic footage from Paris about eight hours ago in broad daylight, the brazen
[08:45.720 --> 08:53.480]  attack on the satirical comedy magazine similar to Mad Magazine, Ebb Doe. A few
[08:53.480 --> 09:01.600]  years ago you remember the magazine began publishing images, cartoon images of the
[09:01.600 --> 09:07.880]  Prophet Muhammad with his turban as a bomb and things like that and the
[09:07.880 --> 09:13.840]  jihadis use it as a recruiting tool and promised that they would kill the
[09:13.840 --> 09:19.640]  editor and also that they would kill the cartoonist. I find it very, very
[09:19.640 --> 09:23.960]  suspicious. There's now 12 dead including two police officers. We have dramatic
[09:23.960 --> 09:27.320]  footage of one of the officers that has been wounded begging for his life and
[09:27.320 --> 09:34.160]  being killed, being shot execution style in cold blood. I find it very
[09:34.160 --> 09:39.280]  suspicious that they're using Western military hand signals. If you watch the
[09:39.280 --> 09:46.360]  footage, they are very calm going about their business killing people and they
[09:46.360 --> 09:49.800]  knew when to be at the newspaper when most people in newspapers nowadays work
[09:49.800 --> 10:03.080]  from home when the editor and the cartoonist were both there running
[10:03.080 --> 10:07.720]  around screaming Allah Akbar. I don't know that audio will translate over AM
[10:07.720 --> 10:19.200]  radio but it will for FM listeners and internet listeners. Now warning in a
[10:19.200 --> 10:22.800]  moment if you're a TV viewer or mainly a radio broadcast but millions do tune in
[10:22.800 --> 10:27.920]  every week via the InfoWars video feed at infowars.com forward slash show or
[10:27.920 --> 10:34.000]  via infowarsnews.com we're going to show the unedited unblurred footage. I'll
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.280]  probably blur this later for YouTube of one of the killers executing a police
[10:41.280 --> 10:47.120]  officer that he's already wounded who is on the ground. Now we show images like
[10:47.120 --> 10:50.800]  this because the media will not show these images but they'll let you see
[10:50.800 --> 10:54.640]  violent video games that simulate the same thing more graphically. We'll all
[10:54.640 --> 10:58.480]  watch violent movies and that's supposedly okay but then the real
[10:58.480 --> 11:04.520]  thing oh we're not supposed to see that so we're going to roll that footage right
[11:04.520 --> 11:06.760]  now.
[11:06.760 --> 11:29.920]  don't shoot don't shoot don't shoot I guess it's Universal English from
[11:29.920 --> 11:34.120]  watching all my Hollywood movies people getting shot that is why English is the
[11:34.120 --> 11:39.360]  world language is that everybody uses it so that cop knew he was doing he thinks
[11:39.360 --> 11:42.760]  he's talking to foreigners he says don't shoot that's the world language
[11:42.760 --> 11:46.480]  that's why they don't want Hispanic immigrants learning English to neutralize
[11:46.480 --> 11:50.840]  you and keep you under Democratic Party barrio control just a little side issue
[11:50.840 --> 11:55.760]  let's play this dramatic shocking footage for TV viewers one more time the
[11:55.760 --> 12:04.160]  unedited YouTube is posted on infowars.com the minute I got up at 6 a.m. this morning
[12:04.160 --> 12:09.280]  and saw this footage I could tell that it looked like Western military trained
[12:09.280 --> 12:17.600]  people or Russian they're also not as skinny as jihadis usually are I'm not
[12:17.600 --> 12:20.520]  saying they're not jihadis because they had a lot of them were trained in the
[12:20.520 --> 12:24.480]  Russian military and ended up defecting through chetching other areas into the
[12:24.480 --> 12:32.240]  jihad but they're very calm and they give military signals to tell the other
[12:32.240 --> 12:37.960]  vehicles to move out they don't hide the license plate of their vehicle probably
[12:37.960 --> 12:43.440]  stolen I don't know what's behind this at this time I'm going to reserve
[12:43.440 --> 12:50.600]  judgment I'm going to analyze it we have a former NSA security head Wayne
[12:50.600 --> 12:54.280]  Madsen one of the biggest NSA whistleblowers in history he just doesn't
[12:54.280 --> 12:57.640]  get any attention because he is so big he's testified to Congress testified to
[12:57.640 --> 13:02.560]  the EU and to the British Parliament he will be joining us at the bottom of the
[13:02.560 --> 13:10.400]  hour in approximately 16 minutes to give us his fresh take on this I don't know
[13:10.400 --> 13:14.480]  Wayne Madsen's take on this his first approximation I don't know Dr. Steve
[13:14.480 --> 13:19.240]  Pachinic who ran major anti-terror operations against jihadi groups all
[13:19.240 --> 13:23.520]  over the world and has exposed a lot of false flags and co-authored books with
[13:23.520 --> 13:28.400]  Tom Clancy he's going to be joining us for about 15 minutes at the end of the
[13:28.400 --> 13:33.800]  broadcast today to give us his take I don't know what his take is I'm not one
[13:33.800 --> 13:39.440]  of these people that just instantly comes out with my view on something until
[13:39.440 --> 13:44.280]  I've had a chance to analyze it on the day of 9-11 it was on CBS radio back
[13:44.280 --> 13:50.320]  what was still called CBS news radio at 425 I heard him say they're going to
[13:50.320 --> 13:54.440]  blow up the Solomon Brothers building 7 to protect the other buildings then I
[13:54.440 --> 14:00.640]  got home and had videotape of the news saying it and I played the clips and
[14:00.640 --> 14:05.040]  people said they must be fake even though others called in saying yeah we
[14:05.040 --> 14:11.520]  heard them say they blew it up it was on NPR too we now have BBC CBS news CBS
[14:11.520 --> 14:19.640]  radio ABC CNN NPR saying we're going to blow up building 7 I don't know
[14:19.640 --> 14:23.000]  exactly what happened on 9-11 but they announced they were going to blow it up
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.920]  and then it blew up and fell they protected the hijackers into the U.S.
[14:28.920 --> 14:32.200]  I've interviewed the head of the U.S. Embassy Visa Department Springman who
[14:32.200 --> 14:36.120]  was ordered to let him in it was called their CIA I'm not going to go on for 10
[14:36.120 --> 14:43.280]  hours here the deputy director of the FBI John O'Neill quit one week before
[14:43.280 --> 14:47.360]  Shane quote they're going to allow al-Qaeda to attack us he died on 9-11
[14:47.360 --> 14:53.800]  strangely enough in the World Trade Center you can't make this stuff up I'm
[14:53.800 --> 14:59.080]  not going to go back into 9-11 today but there are three different types really
[14:59.080 --> 15:01.840]  four different types well there's there's one type of terror that is a subgroup
[15:01.840 --> 15:06.320]  but there are three different types of terror pure original real asymmetrical
[15:06.320 --> 15:12.720]  warfare launched by groups that don't have as high-tech of weapons it's
[15:12.720 --> 15:16.880]  guerrilla warfare and when it's projected at any globalist power it's called
[15:16.880 --> 15:22.600]  terrorism I think it's terrorism when it's aimed at men women and children who
[15:22.600 --> 15:28.120]  aren't in a military unit and a lot of the jihadis do that and it is terrorism
[15:28.120 --> 15:35.360]  now that happens that goes on then you've got provocateur terror where they
[15:35.360 --> 15:43.640]  go out and they just stir up groups and fun groups sometimes through different
[15:43.640 --> 15:48.640]  levels where the group doesn't even know who's funding them criminal groups you
[15:48.640 --> 15:52.640]  name it to carry out a terror attack and the subgroup of that is sometimes it's
[15:52.640 --> 15:59.160]  not misguided trailer trash clan heads or jihadis from you know dirt floor
[15:59.160 --> 16:04.560]  villages who don't know what planet they're on sometimes it's criminal
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.920]  networks that are funded to carry out the attacks and then plant evidence of the
[16:08.920 --> 16:14.880]  group they want to frame so there's real terror normally low level not
[16:14.880 --> 16:18.280]  sophisticated there's stage terror that has a lot of variants I'm just saying
[16:18.280 --> 16:25.320]  two right now then there is aiding and abetting where you kind of open the
[16:25.320 --> 16:30.640]  door and protect terror groups that are operating and then of course there is the
[16:30.640 --> 16:39.080]  purely stage type of terror but most terror is synthetic that is it's
[16:39.080 --> 16:43.920]  artificial it's been produced it's been shepherded it's been protected it's been
[16:43.920 --> 16:49.120]  open-doored it's been coddled they've got some hoax terror as well where it's
[16:49.120 --> 16:53.960]  not even really a terror attack so it's kind of a fifth group like the mutalib
[16:53.960 --> 16:58.760]  attack on Christmas Eve we had two witnesses on board later Congress had
[16:58.760 --> 17:02.240]  testimony admitting that an unnamed US intelligence agency had helped get him
[17:02.240 --> 17:07.120]  on the plane without a visa or proper passport he clearly was drugged he gets
[17:07.120 --> 17:10.640]  up near the end of the flight a man gets up to the house behind him starts
[17:10.640 --> 17:16.600]  videotaping before he even gets up he starts basically stumbling around and
[17:16.600 --> 17:20.920]  then a firecracker goes off in his pants two weeks before all the naked body
[17:20.920 --> 17:25.040]  scanners purchased a year before were set to roll out then they announced on the
[17:25.040 --> 17:28.320]  news they're putting naked body scanners in and the former head of
[17:28.320 --> 17:32.160]  Homeland Security himself made more than ten million dollars billions were made
[17:32.160 --> 17:36.120]  turd off became the head of the company they announced we're putting them in
[17:36.120 --> 17:41.200]  because of the underwear bombing you understand that it's like saying the
[17:41.200 --> 17:44.920]  Austin Police Department buys a bomb truck a year before but it doesn't get
[17:44.920 --> 17:49.600]  delivered till the day a bombing happens and they say oh we just got it today to
[17:49.600 --> 17:53.520]  deal with the bombing or or oh we're getting one tomorrow because we didn't
[17:53.520 --> 17:57.720]  have a bomb truck but you learn they ordered the bomb truck a year before it's
[17:57.720 --> 18:04.040]  very suspicious and the stuff just keeps adding up there's another bigger facet
[18:04.040 --> 18:09.080]  to this PNAC the project for your American Century with Jeb Bush Dick
[18:09.080 --> 18:17.200]  Cheney and others involved Warren Rudman Gary Hart they were all involved they
[18:17.200 --> 18:24.680]  wrote in September of 2000 issued the report a year before 9-11 they would use
[18:24.680 --> 18:28.680]  a catalyzing Pearl Harbor event for a clash of civilizations between the
[18:28.680 --> 18:32.600]  West and Islam and that out of that global crisis they would bring in the
[18:32.600 --> 18:35.520]  corporate world government so they're going to play what's left of the West
[18:35.520 --> 18:39.440]  and our Western freedoms off against radical Islam they're helping protect
[18:39.440 --> 18:45.560]  globally NATO Interpol the UN Republican Party Democratic Party they'll have
[18:45.560 --> 18:50.640]  rhetoric against it while protecting it and they'll use that global threat as a
[18:50.640 --> 18:54.400]  way to take our liberties remember the movie about Muhammad that was just a
[18:54.400 --> 19:00.320]  trailer that they blame Benghazi on turn out that was a fraud they arrested the
[19:00.320 --> 19:06.960]  filmmaker of that and he was in jail for a year and a half for a movie that just
[19:06.960 --> 19:19.280]  showed Muhammad beating people and stuff so you think about that long and hard
[19:19.280 --> 19:23.120]  ladies and gentlemen that they want to set the precedent to take our free
[19:23.120 --> 19:27.640]  speech and to censor the internet and things in the name of countering this
[19:27.640 --> 19:31.520]  now I'm not somebody here that wants a class of civilizations I don't want to
[19:31.520 --> 19:35.440]  fight between the West and Islam but the globalist have opened the borders
[19:35.440 --> 19:38.920]  brought in the most radical funded the groups and then Islam is always
[19:38.920 --> 19:45.480]  demanding we lose our free speech the Islamists are for them so we don't get
[19:45.480 --> 19:50.320]  any speech we have to adopt whatever they want and the whole leftist system
[19:50.320 --> 19:54.360]  backs them up this is that wedding between the socialist and radical
[19:54.360 --> 20:00.880]  Islamist to give it a foothold to cause the clash the CDC just announced flu

[24:18.360 --> 24:24.640]  Jones your host thank you for joining us NSA whistleblower really geopolitical
[24:24.640 --> 24:29.560]  expert Wayne Madsen is going to be giving us his first look take on the
[24:29.560 --> 24:34.440]  attacks that took place I guess eight nine hours ago now over in Paris in
[24:34.440 --> 24:43.280]  broad daylight on the newspaper the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo that
[24:43.280 --> 24:46.480]  had I mean they make fun of the French president they make fun of the US
[24:46.480 --> 24:53.100]  president they make fun of Hollywood stars it's a satire newspaper and they
[24:53.100 --> 24:59.760]  were death-threaded you name it they were fire bombed and the cartoonist said
[24:59.760 --> 25:04.160]  I would rather die standing than live kneeling which is a paraphrase of a
[25:04.160 --> 25:10.040]  famous refrain it's better to live on your feet and to die than to basically
[25:10.040 --> 25:15.280]  grovel on your knees in the ditch plus people that grovel on their knees end up
[25:15.280 --> 25:21.080]  getting killed anyways so this thing really stinks to high heaven there are
[25:21.080 --> 25:25.320]  al-Qaeda groups out of Yemen that are taking responsibility basically there
[25:25.320 --> 25:30.200]  are other government groups saying that here's the big backdrop problem you've
[25:30.200 --> 25:34.520]  all heard the clips of Ted Cruz will play him again later saying we shouldn't
[25:34.520 --> 25:38.960]  be al-Qaeda's air force in Syria you've heard Rand Paul come out in our own
[25:38.960 --> 25:44.800]  military come out and say yes basically 90% of the jihadis in Syria and Iraq are
[25:44.800 --> 25:50.680]  al-Qaeda affiliated they've changed their name to ISIS the West has been funding
[25:50.680 --> 26:02.480]  them Turkey France especially the United States Germany England have been
[26:02.480 --> 26:12.000]  openly saying that they are funding these groups and we have been here
[26:12.000 --> 26:19.320]  warning you that bad things would end up happening and now indeed you call it
[26:19.320 --> 26:22.920]  blowback whatever you want I don't know if this is a staged event I don't know
[26:22.920 --> 26:28.880]  if it's a provocateur event if you watch the close-up video off the roof as
[26:28.880 --> 26:35.520]  they're preparing to leave or ex-fil trade I guess if you look at basic NATO
[26:35.520 --> 26:40.200]  hand signs that are also used by police department SWAT teams if your TV viewer
[26:40.200 --> 26:47.960]  we have a graphic of this you can see that when they're leaving they do the
[26:47.960 --> 26:52.440]  hand sign for come as the leaders walking towards the car that's waiting
[26:52.440 --> 26:57.840]  and then he does the symbol of his hand up with his finger in a circle meaning
[26:57.840 --> 27:06.760]  rally point come to the car and if you watch the video closely they're giving
[27:06.760 --> 27:18.520]  other signals before that does al-Qaeda have Western hand sign tactics not in
[27:18.520 --> 27:31.800]  videos I've seen they have their own goofy tactics the body language this is a
[27:31.800 --> 27:35.120]  first look looking at a lot of soldiers watching a lot of video over the years
[27:35.120 --> 27:42.800]  as they look like Russians and by Russians the bearing the body language
[27:42.800 --> 27:48.560]  looks like Russian style special forces or something now there's a lot of Russian
[27:48.560 --> 27:53.960]  Muslims a large portion large groups that have ended up going to the Middle
[27:53.960 --> 27:59.880]  East going to Syria going to Iraq out of Chechnya and other areas so there's a
[27:59.880 --> 28:03.920]  good chance that's why I'm seeing this they also had the classic Kalishnikovs
[28:03.920 --> 28:09.720]  AK-47s that means nothing that's the most produced firearm in the world just the
[28:09.720 --> 28:16.040]  first look at this video they look and act and behave like Russian trained
[28:16.040 --> 28:22.480]  groups I'm not saying Russia's involved in this I'm telling you that when I
[28:22.480 --> 28:28.800]  looked at this video at 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. and then on the elliptical at 8 a.m.
[28:28.800 --> 28:35.960]  they looked and acted and behave like Russians I have no idea what we're
[28:35.960 --> 28:39.600]  going to hear from Wayne Madsen who was also in the military but also in the
[28:39.600 --> 28:44.520]  NSA and has proven to be accurate over and over again on at an uncanny level
[28:44.520 --> 28:54.680]  he also has a lot of sources if you expand on that we're also gonna have
[28:54.680 --> 28:58.400]  Steve Pacinac pop in for about 15 minutes I don't know what his take is like I
[28:58.400 --> 29:02.600]  told my producer don't ask him what their take is I want to hear it raw
[29:02.600 --> 29:08.360]  uncensored one of the guys kind of does have mannerisms and I've just noticed
[29:08.360 --> 29:16.960]  this by watching military groups in their outfits of a Yemenese or of someone
[29:16.960 --> 29:20.800]  I mean folks you can find you can tell someone in the army or the Marines want
[29:20.800 --> 29:24.400]  to show you this stuff enough even when they're older just the mannerisms all
[29:24.400 --> 29:33.160]  of it and I've just watched this so long that I may end up being wrong but my
[29:33.160 --> 29:39.760]  gut tells me look at all the pieces I'm not ready to make a statement yet I'm
[29:39.760 --> 29:45.480]  gonna think about this some more but I'm working on it right now I'm working on

[33:23.040 --> 33:28.880]  give you my first approximation on what is unfolded in Paris but it has very
[33:28.880 --> 33:35.360]  convenient timing right after the German government threatened to ban anti
[33:35.360 --> 33:41.000]  open borders anti radical Islam rallies the left came out in massive
[33:41.000 --> 33:45.720]  solidarity surrounding the peaceful demonstrators even attacking some of
[33:45.720 --> 33:50.640]  them in areas of Germany the lap dog media praise the leftist groups
[33:50.640 --> 33:58.080]  demonizing Germans who I mean in all fairness Germany's more like Turkey now
[33:58.080 --> 34:04.440]  there is Germany it's gonna be like when we have 40 million immigrants a year
[34:04.440 --> 34:09.480]  coming in of the government has their way with visas in a decade or less these
[34:09.480 --> 34:12.960]  the United States will look like India and I don't mean to look like India
[34:12.960 --> 34:16.880]  because I look like Indians I mean will look like Calcutta because of the
[34:16.880 --> 34:22.160]  population you add to that the social welfare and the fact that government
[34:22.160 --> 34:25.560]  wants to give people a bunch of freebies to politically control them we're gonna
[34:25.560 --> 34:30.000]  be so bankrupt with a giant mass of dependent people talk about a nightmare
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.200]  we're gonna break all this down coming up we're also gonna read some of the
[34:36.200 --> 34:44.160]  statements of Charlie Hebdo's editor Stefan Charbonnet if I pronounced that
[34:44.160 --> 34:50.600]  right wow I pronounced it right I'm gonna read some of his statements because
[34:50.600 --> 34:55.840]  you can see whatever you want about them they had a lot of wave o's well they've
[34:55.840 --> 35:01.480]  been firebomb death-threaded you name it but how did the shooters know to come to
[35:01.480 --> 35:05.960]  a newspaper I mean 20 years ago 10 years ago everybody be at the newspaper
[35:05.960 --> 35:11.760]  but to catch the editor and to catch the cartoonists together when most
[35:11.760 --> 35:16.280]  cartoonists work from home and to get them all do they have a mole inside to
[35:16.280 --> 35:20.800]  know about a company meeting was it the day before it published because yeah
[35:20.800 --> 35:25.000]  maybe everybody be on deck then how did they know to catch them all and kill 10
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.480]  inside then two police officers outside I don't know the answer to that but we
[35:30.480 --> 35:35.320]  have Western governments that have been caught staging stuff before but now
[35:35.320 --> 35:39.760]  they've created a giant recruiting ground for radical jihadists in Syria and
[35:39.760 --> 35:44.880]  Iraq use this blowback from that but France is involved arming the jihadis
[35:44.880 --> 35:49.840]  probably more than even Turkey or Israel and it's a shame on the West that
[35:49.840 --> 35:54.200]  they're openly arming these folks that have killed over 300,000 people the last
[35:54.200 --> 35:59.280]  four years in Syria don't ever forget that blowing up churches and mosque and
[35:59.280 --> 36:05.240]  markets and hotels of a reforming country that wanted to work with the West
[36:05.240 --> 36:09.960]  just like Gaddafi came in from the dark put his money in with the West let US
[36:09.960 --> 36:14.080]  companies come in they turned it over to Al Qaeda we're talking to Wayne Madsen
[36:14.080 --> 36:19.240]  who's been to Turkey been to Syria former NSA officer high-level whistleblower
[36:19.240 --> 36:23.880]  one of the biggest ever next to William Benny as big as Snowden folks we're
[36:23.880 --> 36:27.240]  gonna be talking to him getting his take on this in a moment but I know this
[36:27.240 --> 36:37.040]  regardless now the press is rushing to the aid of this newspaper and saying we
[36:37.040 --> 36:43.600]  support free speech we shouldn't be intimidated where were you before when
[36:43.600 --> 36:48.800]  Michael Savage was banned from traveling to the UK and others if they can
[36:48.800 --> 36:58.760]  criticize and then get banned we can all get banned from travel or anything else
[36:58.760 --> 37:05.840]  if we criticize somebody it's free speech and I've got to tell you in general
[37:05.840 --> 37:11.280]  you see an alliance between the fake fascist left and radical Islamists to
[37:11.280 --> 37:14.680]  in free speech in the West and the neocons are more than happy to have a
[37:14.680 --> 37:18.960]  clash of civilizations out of which they'll get the police state so it's a
[37:18.960 --> 37:23.400]  serious situation with Dr. Wayne Madsen here in about two minutes but here's a
[37:23.400 --> 37:30.320]  piece produced almost three years ago by my son Rex Jones he listens to the show
[37:30.320 --> 37:34.440]  he's well-informed historically he's 12 now he was nine and a half when we
[37:34.440 --> 37:38.920]  produced this he wrote most of this I'd say I'm 25 percent of it a board game
[37:38.920 --> 37:45.880]  came in put out by a board game novelty group that's instead of risk it's
[37:45.880 --> 37:51.200]  worldwide terrorism and in the board game it shows how powerful corporate
[37:51.200 --> 37:55.600]  interest or base or busy financing terrorist to destabilize things so Rex
[37:55.600 --> 37:58.720]  was playing with it one day when he was up here spending a day with me at work
[37:58.720 --> 38:02.680]  as part of his homeschooling at the time and he said I've got an idea to do a
[38:02.680 --> 38:06.160]  video on this well so we got to cover your face though you know your mom didn't
[38:06.160 --> 38:11.200]  want your face on TV at neither do I so he's wearing a guy Fox mask and did it
[38:11.200 --> 38:15.600]  in a British accent my son is not British people tend to get confused by
[38:15.600 --> 38:19.560]  that it's kind of like Guy Fox is British or V for Vendetta's British so
[38:19.560 --> 38:23.440]  just answering some of those questions that come up when we air this maybe once
[38:23.440 --> 38:44.400]  a year or so but here is terrorism 101 for my son Rex Jones
[38:44.400 --> 38:54.000]  first off our terrorist group needs a scary name can you say LCI ADA let's try again LCI ADA
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.240]  ah it does roll off the tongue LCI ADA it's a perfect name now let's say the
[39:00.240 --> 39:05.800]  green piece here represents the terrorists a terrorist then move into
[39:05.800 --> 39:12.600]  Pakistan or Afghanistan or whatever stand is not under banker control the
[39:12.600 --> 39:17.400]  media then joins in to hype up the terror threat dry hand operates with the
[39:17.400 --> 39:25.840]  impunity from safe havens the inside fascism what he's up in the back once the
[39:25.840 --> 39:30.520]  terror threat is established the banksters puppets send in the troops to
[39:30.520 --> 39:34.920]  take out the terrorists they put in there in the first place then the bankers
[39:34.920 --> 39:39.120]  install their own dictator to take control of the resources and oppress the
[39:39.120 --> 39:45.720]  people as a bonus the banks via the black ops and intelligence agencies
[39:45.720 --> 39:50.160]  will then ship the drugs back into the host country so they can imprison their
[39:50.160 --> 39:55.000]  own citizens for using the drugs make huge profits selling the drugs which
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  finance other terror operations around the globe and the cherry on the top is
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.120]  billions upon billions made on money laundering operations for the bankers
[40:05.120 --> 40:10.400]  in a sense you're watching as this opium is being grown I know it grinds at
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.080]  your gut how do you deal with it what are you doing about oh frankly this is a
[40:15.080 --> 40:19.640]  part of the culture so while it might grind in my gut it's what they do and
[40:19.640 --> 40:25.560]  if the citizens of the host country gets wise to these schemes or get up a T the
[40:25.560 --> 40:30.200]  banks via media will hype in nuclear terror threats or the underwear bomber
[40:30.200 --> 40:35.000]  or Christmas tree bomber any excuse to take the American people's right
[40:35.000 --> 40:41.880]  huh well that just about wraps it up for terrorism 101 how terrorism really works
[40:41.880 --> 40:47.080]  I'm your friendly neighborhood patriot and now remember what big brother and
[40:47.080 --> 40:53.920]  other authoritarian say whatever you do don't visit info.com oh no the control
[40:53.920 --> 40:59.600]  freaks don't like it oh that's right folks info wars comm and you're the

[41:47.560 --> 41:52.440]  censor as easy and you're supporting the very tip of the spear of free speech
[41:52.440 --> 41:58.560]  and even if you disagree with speech you should support the right of people to
[41:58.560 --> 42:03.680]  put out controversial speech so that you don't lose your right to free speech I
[42:03.680 --> 42:07.840]  know that's common sense but it's a serious vote for liberty and a vote for
[42:07.840 --> 42:12.200]  freedom when you become a member of prisonplanet.tv so I want to thank all
[42:12.200 --> 42:16.320]  of you that have done that all right for the balance of the hour we go to Wayne
[42:16.320 --> 42:21.520]  Madsen formally with the NSA before that with the anti-submarine warfare at the
[42:21.520 --> 42:26.520]  Navy he worked in a key internal unit of internal security inside the NSA and
[42:26.520 --> 42:31.520]  again he's testified to Congress the EU British Parliament you name it he's a
[42:31.520 --> 42:36.280]  best-selling author the Wayne Madsen report.com I don't know Wayne's take on
[42:36.280 --> 42:41.920]  this yet this just happened 10 hours ago or so in Paris at the satirical
[42:41.920 --> 42:47.280]  newspaper and again this sends a very scary message also if you have any
[42:47.280 --> 42:53.440]  questions for Wayne Madsen myself or others tweet your images if you want to
[42:53.440 --> 42:56.680]  retweet some of these images that the radicals say we're not allowed to put
[42:56.680 --> 43:02.280]  out and video clips to us at real Alex Jones or your comments or questions at
[43:02.280 --> 43:10.800]  real Alex Jones with pound sign Charlie Hebdo again pound sign Charlie Hebdo
[43:10.800 --> 43:16.080]  tweet real Alex Jones with the hashtag Charlie Hebdo and we will get to some of
[43:16.080 --> 43:21.040]  those questions as well throughout the day but going to Wayne Madsen Wayne you
[43:21.040 --> 43:24.600]  but on hold for about 10 minutes hearing me play that clip and also give some of
[43:24.600 --> 43:29.600]  my views on this it's a multifaceted issue but obviously I want to get your
[43:29.600 --> 43:34.240]  take first on the clash of civilizations regardless we just saw Al Qaeda go from
[43:34.240 --> 43:39.520]  supposedly nothing after 12 years and then the last two being resuscitated
[43:39.520 --> 43:46.080]  rising again as ISIS now this is being linked to Al Qaeda what are your sources
[43:46.080 --> 43:51.720]  saying of any I know it's early on what's your gut on this Wayne Madsen oh yes
[43:51.720 --> 43:56.920]  Alex first I want to say I enjoyed listening to the next John Oliver on
[43:56.920 --> 44:02.920]  HBO your I think your son has a great future ahead thank you television but
[44:02.920 --> 44:11.800]  anyway my initial take and I heard you mentioning how come so many of the
[44:11.800 --> 44:16.960]  cartoonists and editors for Charlie Hebdo were present and that this happened
[44:16.960 --> 44:23.200]  to be Wednesday is their weekly editorial staff meeting at the newspaper
[44:23.200 --> 44:30.080]  headquarters which is in on the right bank of the Senate in North Paris I'm
[44:30.080 --> 44:34.960]  very familiar with the area because I worked for a newsletter nearby called
[44:34.960 --> 44:40.720]  Le Monde de Rossignol years ago which is not too far away but Le Figaro is
[44:40.720 --> 44:47.680]  also in that area and one thing I know from being in these newspaper offices
[44:47.680 --> 44:53.280]  is you just can't stroll in off the street at the very least they either have
[44:53.280 --> 44:58.680]  a buzzer system where someone has to let you in through the door or there's a
[44:58.680 --> 45:05.560]  safer lock system and since there were threats against Charlie Hebdo and
[45:05.560 --> 45:11.840]  also another satirical magazine it's not too far away either the canal all
[45:11.840 --> 45:19.240]  Shawnee which is the chain duck in English the police have been posting a
[45:19.240 --> 45:24.920]  presence at these various offices so I'm not sure whether the two policemen who
[45:24.920 --> 45:28.520]  were killed were part of the regular detail or they just happened on the
[45:28.520 --> 45:37.120]  scene but the mere fact that these assassins used two getaway cars and
[45:37.120 --> 45:42.920]  apparently have escaped after heading into the northern Parisian suburbs would
[45:42.920 --> 45:49.120]  indicate to me that this was more than just a run-of-the-mill
[45:49.120 --> 45:57.160]  amateur terrorist attack this looks like it was well planned with information
[45:57.160 --> 46:07.200]  about when the this particular newspaper had its weekly editorial meeting and
[46:07.200 --> 46:15.440]  and we have to also remember that France recently antagonized certain parties
[46:15.440 --> 46:22.240]  by voting in favor of Palestine joining the United Nations and that was the
[46:22.240 --> 46:27.320]  French vote UN Security Council well there's a documentary film that won an
[46:27.320 --> 46:31.960]  Academy Award guys Google it I think it's seven days in September or is it
[46:31.960 --> 46:37.240]  November I've it's it's narrated by a famous Hollywood actor but I remember
[46:37.240 --> 46:42.960]  going and seeing it shortly after 9 11 it's narrated by Michael Douglas and they
[46:42.960 --> 46:47.440]  admit at the end that German intelligence had been working with the head
[46:47.440 --> 46:50.960]  of the terrorist group from the beginning they had patsies under them
[46:50.960 --> 46:56.440]  that they staged a hijacking so that they could then release the terrorist of
[46:56.440 --> 47:04.560]  the Munich Olympics so here at the end of the film they admit it was basically
[47:04.560 --> 47:09.360]  staged all along but even the low-level jihadis taking the hostages and
[47:09.360 --> 47:14.040]  shooting people didn't know it was staged so this is usually ends up being a
[47:14.040 --> 47:19.080]  staged event you had the big German protest against the Islamification of
[47:19.080 --> 47:25.160]  Germany yesterday and calls to restrict their fees a free speech but you're
[47:25.160 --> 47:31.040]  right I mean the whole thing suspicious I know this the body language of the
[47:31.040 --> 47:35.320]  shooters I've seen so many al-Qaeda and ISIS videos of them in their getups
[47:35.320 --> 47:40.880]  doesn't fit the body language and the signaling that I've seen from hundreds
[47:40.880 --> 47:47.520]  of real jihadi videos it looks very Western and they're giving the classic
[47:47.520 --> 47:53.640]  rally signs they're giving the classic you know come to me and then the rally
[47:53.640 --> 47:59.720]  points it looks like tactics I've only seen out of Russians or NATO yeah and
[47:59.720 --> 48:03.360]  the fact that they were hooded we don't even know what you know who these people
[48:03.360 --> 48:10.720]  are they're still at large and it's very similar to the if you recall the attack
[48:10.720 --> 48:16.400]  on the shopping mall in Nairobi Kenya that was again as you say done with
[48:16.400 --> 48:24.280]  military precision sort of like a special operations attack not certainly an
[48:24.280 --> 48:32.200]  amateur one and right so right now my my gut feeling is that I will not I'm not
[48:32.200 --> 48:37.320]  going to go with the people are saying this is this is a typical Islamist
[48:37.320 --> 48:45.080]  terrorist attack I think there's much more to this and I think after so many
[48:45.080 --> 48:52.040]  false flag operations the the the onus is on the corporate media to prove
[48:52.040 --> 48:58.360]  otherwise that it it was in fact what they're saying it was my default is not
[48:58.360 --> 49:03.560]  to believe it at first at first well sure the default is you automatically can't
[49:03.560 --> 49:06.440]  believe what they're saying and then you have to try to figure out the truth for
[49:06.440 --> 49:14.320]  yourself I just don't see who stands to gain from any angle when France is up
[49:14.320 --> 49:20.000]  their eyeballs with Saudi Arabia publicly flogging invasions and bombardments
[49:20.000 --> 49:26.520]  of Syria it just it just why then with the jihadis I mean I would expect a
[49:26.520 --> 49:30.120]  crude truck bomb or something from a real jihadi or you know somebody's
[49:30.120 --> 49:34.680]  shooting some people up front not grabbing you know one of the workers
[49:34.680 --> 49:37.760]  forcing them to give them the key code which they're now saying getting into
[49:37.760 --> 49:41.080]  the building here's another question you can get guns in France as you know
[49:41.080 --> 49:44.360]  course you've lived there under some limited permits you've got to expect
[49:44.360 --> 49:47.800]  that this is a popular satirical publication that they would have some
[49:47.800 --> 49:51.840]  armed guards there or that they would have guns in there I mean did they just
[49:51.840 --> 49:56.000]  roll over and not fight back I mean if three guys showed up here with AK-47s
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.440]  I mean I guarantee you and we got a whole bunch of vets working here a bunch
[50:00.440 --> 50:03.680]  people know how to use guns I know how to use guns I mean they'd be in deep
[50:03.680 --> 50:07.200]  trouble or is this just how domesticated the French have gotten well I
[50:07.200 --> 50:13.480]  think in this particular case this particular magazine probably didn't
[50:13.480 --> 50:17.760]  take all those precautions it would be like it's very similar to the onion here
[50:17.760 --> 50:23.120]  in the United States but with a little bit more of a political edge to it not
[50:23.120 --> 50:27.840]  as satirical certainly as the onion but you know one could ask what does the
[50:27.840 --> 50:33.000]  onion have what kind of security do they have at their editorial offices Mike I
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.560]  don't know I've never been there but I would not imagine it's it's very much
[50:36.560 --> 50:39.520]  well look I mean I'm not an Islamophobe that wants to have a clash of
[50:39.520 --> 50:42.680]  civilizations I get that's part of the paradigm but there is a large real
[50:42.680 --> 50:47.360]  Islamic contingent that you know you're for women's rights so am I Wayne they
[50:47.360 --> 50:50.760]  throw us in a dungeon over that or they grab our daughters and you know sexually
[50:50.760 --> 50:54.800]  mutilate them I mean what do we do about real radical Islam being stirred up by
[50:54.800 --> 50:59.960]  globalists when we come back I want to ask you that question silver has always

[54:11.640 --> 54:16.120]  to tweet out the image that's on drudge report.com during the next break at real
[54:16.120 --> 54:19.480]  Alex Jones and I would encourage you to retweet it it's taken from drudge
[54:19.480 --> 54:25.200]  report.com one of the former covers of the French style onion satire newspaper
[54:25.200 --> 54:31.160]  that's been around for decades and there is the cover it shows the Prophet
[54:31.160 --> 54:41.200]  Muhammad in French making a statement about killing people and now it is being
[54:41.200 --> 54:46.040]  reported by the Daily Mail that Kareen Ray the secretary and her daughter saw
[54:46.040 --> 54:52.240]  two other cartoonists being killed the cartoonist reveals terrorists threatened
[54:52.240 --> 54:57.000]  to murder her toddler unless she let them in how she coward with her child
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.880]  under a desk as the massacre took place she says the man who spoke perfect
[55:00.880 --> 55:05.920]  French claimed to be al-qaeda terrorist attackers reportedly heard shouting the
[55:05.920 --> 55:09.560]  Prophet has been avenged here's all I'm saying I've watched a lot of these
[55:09.560 --> 55:13.560]  jihadis eat hearts cut people's heads off do all these horrible things be funded
[55:13.560 --> 55:16.480]  by the West and that's like no big deal when they're doing it's like oh it's
[55:16.480 --> 55:20.800]  just part of a war John McCain says when they're gutting Syria and killing
[55:20.800 --> 55:27.280]  every Christian they get their hands on and Saudi Arabia is behind it but these
[55:27.280 --> 55:33.720]  guys don't look in their mannerisms or act like what I've seen before so when
[55:33.720 --> 55:37.680]  we hear that they're you know al-qaeda out of Yemen or something that's not a
[55:37.680 --> 55:42.000]  French speaking area that could just be a cover story we don't believe what the
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.520]  gunmen are telling people with mask on their heads I'm not saying it's a
[55:45.520 --> 55:53.200]  governmental operation I I'm trying to look at every angle of this Wayne I mean
[55:53.200 --> 55:58.440]  I know you're permeating this or going over in your mind trying to causitate on
[55:58.440 --> 56:03.120]  it going through permutations I should say any other ideas who stands to gain
[56:03.120 --> 56:09.560]  from this and then also what do we do then about the clash of civilizations
[56:09.560 --> 56:13.960]  because we know it's stage but the same time there is an attempt to support
[56:13.960 --> 56:17.760]  radical Islam and let it get a foothold well I think it's very interesting
[56:17.760 --> 56:23.240]  what you just reported about that the these killers said that they were with
[56:23.240 --> 56:30.200]  al-qaeda we have been told in Syria and Iraq that al-qaeda is more moderate now
[56:30.200 --> 56:37.360]  than the ISIL Islamic State for Iraq and the Levant or ISIS or Daesh as it's
[56:37.360 --> 56:42.760]  known in Arabic we've been told that though we may have to ally with some
[56:42.760 --> 56:47.520]  al-qaeda groups against ISIL which is more radical and you know at the end of
[56:47.520 --> 56:51.560]  this month the the CIA and the military our military are going to start
[56:51.560 --> 56:57.880]  training so-called members of the Syrian rebel army in Turkey well we know who
[56:57.880 --> 57:02.760]  they are there's Jabhat al-Nusra the al-Nusra front and they claim to be an
[57:02.760 --> 57:07.960]  al-Qaeda affiliate I I think all this stuff about the Khorasan group and
[57:07.960 --> 57:14.480]  and ISIL and and Jabhat al-Nusra and these al-Qaeda affiliates it's all
[57:14.480 --> 57:19.680]  smoke and mirrors it's all one group and the young people including many French
[57:19.680 --> 57:27.480]  including including some French Jews have gone to Syria to join these groups
[57:27.480 --> 57:34.560]  to fight against Assad and I like in this these are I don't think these are
[57:34.560 --> 57:38.480]  Islamic people at all I don't think they're Muslim people because when you
[57:38.480 --> 57:43.080]  look at their rhetoric and the awful things they do this sort of satanic
[57:43.080 --> 57:47.320]  eating hearts as you mentioned cutting off heads I'm beginning to think it's
[57:47.320 --> 57:54.400]  some sort of cult that has used Islam as some sort of rallying cry but it's the
[57:54.400 --> 58:02.720]  furthest thing from Islam and I liken it to this this there's this cartoon
[58:02.720 --> 58:10.880]  character that goes that convinces young teens to like murder their their
[58:10.880 --> 58:15.760]  parents their mothers burned down the house and I liken it to that kind of a
[58:15.760 --> 58:22.720]  cult and it certainly makes me wonder whether we're not seeing some sort of
[58:22.720 --> 58:29.200]  old CIMK ultra operation play out here to radicalize the Middle East and bring
[58:29.200 --> 58:34.600]  on this clash once again a renewed clash sure it's a global civil war at every
[58:34.600 --> 58:37.440]  level come back let's do five more minutes and then I've got some shocking

[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:19.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:37.000]  Alex Jones back when the French newspaper was getting firebomb the onion
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.540]  didn't really come out in defense job it they came up with an image saying no one
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:50.600]  murdered because of this image and it's Moses Jesus Vishnu and Buddha I can't
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:56.520]  show it all having sex together and see that's that's what irritates me the
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.200]  globalists are going to pick something that has some real issues some real
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.440]  weight and then exacerbated fan the flames put salt in the wound and and
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.000]  Wayne's been all over the Middle East he's dealt with it he's seen it first
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.240]  hand he understands it but clearly the West is funding and trying to stir this
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:19.300]  up Wayne I just can't believe that they're getting away with it where do
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.800]  you see all this going how do you think the war against Russia and the war
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:27.960]  against US wildcatter oil producers is going a few minutes on the big picture
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:35.320]  Wayne and other points well I noticed that these this new Republican class in
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:42.760]  the Senate wasted no time in calling for increased homeland security powers in
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:50.760]  our country as a result of this attack in Paris you know insane McCain and his
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.480]  boyfriend Lindsey Graham were right out right out of the gate on this one
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.120]  meanwhile he's been meeting with the very groups getting them funds and
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:04.960]  millions of dollars that's too rich yeah yeah I mean McCain wants to wants to try
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.160]  to convince everybody that it must have been a doppelganger that was in Syria
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:16.600]  meeting with ISIL and I just think that you know the recruiting effort and that
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:23.880]  that many of these people that join ISIL don't even have any Muslim lineage they
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.840]  they're they have Irish names they're from Catholic families they're from
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:33.560]  Jewish families in some cases they're from Buddhist families in Asia and Hindu
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.280]  families in India and I just I couldn't think of the name of the car of the
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:43.120]  character but slender man I think of it as some sort of mind control operation
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:48.000]  like this slender man comic that convinces some this character convinces some
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.640]  young people to go and kill their parents well sure I mean it's a way it's like
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.880]  joining the French foreign legion in bizarro world you get to go kill steal
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:01.280]  and destroy you get to go fight in a renegade criminal army and and I look
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:06.720]  at the eyes and the faces of these jihadis they're like cartoon crazy yeah
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.040]  I mean this is all central casting absolutely and now now the people that
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.400]  carried out the attack against Charlie Hebdo I think are not these types of
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.820]  individuals as we were talking oh they're obviously the opposite they're
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:25.360]  totally cold-blooded totally calm right right and where do I see this going now
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:31.160]  well obviously we're seeing you know calls for increased security here you
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:35.400]  know the McCain's and there's some new senator from Oklahoma named Lanford
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:40.200]  who's already on the Homeland Security Committee yacking this up and they're
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:44.000]  gonna you know this is going to be used by some of these new freshmen senators
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.680]  as a chance to introduce themselves to the American public as we're tough on
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:56.200]  terrorism yeah the timing of this is very very suspicious coming as the new
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:05.520]  Congress has has convened and also so soon after the problems in Germany with
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:10.920]  the anti-Muslim and you know pro-Muslim right demonstrations and the
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:17.320]  French vote UN Security Council in favor recognizing Palestine and making them a
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:22.520]  full member of the UN so I think there's a lot of play here but there are
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:27.800]  certainly people that are now going to use the current situation to try to
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:35.080]  further exacerbate tensions and with the plunge in oil prices of course look at
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:41.080]  look at where the exacerbation of these tensions are taking place in some of the
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.520]  oil producing nations not only Russia but also in the Middle East and Venezuela
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.560]  among others sure it's a global energy war and it's all starting to come to

[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:16.880]  the lives of 12 people including two police officers of the satirical
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:25.440]  magazine Charlie Hebdo we have the unedited videos of them executing the

[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.480]  dot com you're gonna watch violent video games of simulated murder all day on
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.800]  television you might as well see the real thing that's politically correct
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:43.120]  world and the old days on the news they'd show real violence but then they
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:47.440]  wouldn't show simulated violence because simulated violence made real violence a
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:51.880]  joke now they show simulated violence conditioning you to accept it but then
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:57.920]  won't show you real violence it's up on info wars dot com right now coming up I
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.760]  want to read some of what the editor had to say before he was killed in an
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.760]  article about extremists don't need an excuse as he told her spiegel we are
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:12.240]  only criticizing one particular form of extremist Islam albeit in a peculiar
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:16.920]  and satirical exaggerated form we are not responsible for the excesses that
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.760]  happen elsewhere just because we practice our right to freedom of
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:26.280]  expression within the legal image the White House has come out and said that
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:33.200]  they're not sure this is terrorism isn't that interesting so it's okay to make
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:39.040]  fun of Merkel of Germany or Cameron of the UK or Obama of the US actually it
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:43.240]  isn't okay they call it racist when you criticize him but don't you make fun of
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.440]  anything Islamic and again I'm not getting sucked into hating Muslims that's
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:53.360]  not what we're about it's not what we do but Muslims coming to the West and a
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.120]  lot of them are fleeing here to get away from oppression need to know we have
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.960]  freedom of speech we're laws a fair that's the way it is and that's how
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:07.840]  we're gonna stay just like feminists came out and said you know fire the guy of
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:12.360]  the space mission because he was wearing a shirt with girls and bikinis on it
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:16.600]  well his girlfriend made it for him so what shut up free speech you're a
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.680]  tyrant you make me sick dying feisty I want the sense of the internet you're
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:24.800]  a witch but let me tell you a bunch of jihadis want to shut my free speech up
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.360]  and then a lot of these mainline Islamic groups want to shut down free speech in
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:33.920]  America I don't care if it's the FCC Obama Al Gore's wife I don't care who it
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:40.760]  is no do you got it I may totally disagree with something the new black
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.800]  Panther Party says a bunch of racist black clan members I'll die for them to
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.600]  have the right to say it I disagree with what the clan says but I'll die for
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.400]  their right to say it as long as you don't call for violence against somebody
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:59.000]  specifically saying go kill such and such it's free speech they were trying
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.840]  to ban people protesting open borders and the Islamification of Germany
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:07.560]  yesterday in big nationwide protest I mean Europe is turning into a tyranny and
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.880]  a fake clash of civilizations now I wanted to get past for manning on for
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:17.600]  30 minutes today get an update on his bold move to call for Al Sharpton to be
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:21.400]  basically boycotted and fired now again people can say well that's calling for
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.760]  censorship no it's not saying if saying he shouldn't be able to have a
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.000]  publication anywhere censorship if you go out for somebody sponsors that's
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.680]  called a boycott and Al Sharpton is an FBI rat he's been caught dealing drugs
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.960]  he's been linked to people dying everybody knows about the stuff he's
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:44.840]  done and now he's linked to hyping up this race war garbage he has no viewers
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:48.640]  he's already basically fired the point is to be in Harlem where he's the king
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:56.040]  rat is a bold move by Pastor Manning we'll talk to him then coming up a
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:02.200]  special report flu claims the lives of a whole bunch of little girls in one
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:08.840]  town alone after getting the flu shot also Hawaii is having record-breaking
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:14.160]  cold but California has started a global warming tax at the gas pumps we're
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:20.400]  gonna tie that into all this other tyranny a bunch of drone news it's all
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:27.960]  coming up today that we are joined by the head of a very successful large
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:34.840]  church there for 30 years hotlet.org Pastor Manning joins us today
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:41.720]  Pastor James David Manning but but since we already have this this is
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:45.480]  lamification radicals on this occasion happening I want to get his take on that
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.480]  as he's spoken out against it we're actually going to pull up the video I
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.720]  forgot to tell you guys to find it it's in a speech I have the quote where
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:57.400]  Obama basically cursed those that make fun of the Prophet Muhammad we don't
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:02.920]  need a president attacking people who engage in their free speech he could
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:07.600]  say I disagree with them but they have the president saying basically bad
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:12.240]  things will happen to people is an encouragement while they found radical
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:16.520]  Islam to go into Syria and Iraq and kill every Christian in Jew and non radical
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:21.360]  Muslim Alawite or Shiite they can find it's pretty disgusting
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:27.320]  Pastor Manning what's your take on the tragic shootings in Paris and overall
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.080]  where do you see all this going in the master plan what's your discernment your
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:35.640]  gut tell you is behind it. I've got two things Alex first of all it's good to be
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:39.600]  on your broadcast again thank you so very much for a second invite I've got
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:44.640]  two things about what happened in Paris over the last 18 hours or so number
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:51.040]  one is that France itself has become a very radical if you will atheistic if
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:56.240]  you must non believing politically correct nation and they have welcome
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:03.200]  and embrace Muslims into their nation for various reasons and allowed them to
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:08.280]  build a large population that's the second largest religion in France well
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.160]  Pastor Manning we're having an audio problem again with you let's go to
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.280]  phone I'm gonna put you on hold will they go to phone and then we're gonna
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.200]  come right back to you to get your take on that thank you Pastor Manning of
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:23.840]  otla.org is our guest and I want to give him the floor to break all of this
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:30.920]  down I have it here in my stack in fact I'm going to dig it out but where are
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:37.200]  all these journalists that are racing to show solidarity with the newspaper in
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:41.000]  France after the terror attack free speech must not be silenced in the wake
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.880]  of the Charlie Hebdo attack where was everybody and I and some of them were
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:54.320]  there when there have been calls to silence people criticizing big
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.880]  government or people criticizing Obamacare being called racist that's
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:03.520]  quite a demonization label on someone that exposes Obamacare for what it is a
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:11.400]  giant stinking fraud and where is the press coming out when Obama has been
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.160]  critical of those that criticize quote Muhammad remember when I did that after
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:22.840]  Benghazi he was blaming a film for the riots all over not not blaming riots
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.880]  taking over the Middle East funded by the West on the people rioting and
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:31.720]  killing no blaming it on America's free speech in fact guys I had that in my
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:35.040]  stack I know you gave it to me just reprint me the quote where Obama
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:39.520]  attacks those critical of the Prophet Muhammad I want to read his actual quote
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:47.760]  on air because it's just stunning to see where all of this is going because I
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:51.800]  don't care who was behind it in the final equation you're not taking my free
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:56.160]  speech do you understand and that future must not belong to those who slander the
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:02.760]  Prophet of Islam but to be credible those who condemn that slander must also
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:07.520]  condemn the hate we see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated or
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:14.520]  churches that are destroyed or the Holocaust that is denied okay sounds
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:19.040]  reasonable except Obama is part of the Western power structure arming the
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:23.360]  radical jihadis and that's on record that we're Al Qaeda's Air Force in Syria
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:27.720]  member Ted Cruz we have Pastor Manning now we didn't have audio problems so he
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:31.240]  went live we're gonna diagnose this problem again later and have you back
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:35.000]  on sir but I'm sorry you've got the floor go ahead yeah well a couple things
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:43.560]  out of Alex one is that I'm concerned that France being a very liberal if you
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:50.080]  will politically correct atheistic nation that has embraced a large amount of
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:58.080]  Muslims into the fabric of their society that they should expect these
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.440]  kinds of things to happen embracing a very radical if you will group of
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.880]  people but France has become a very radical nation itself is one of our
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:11.400]  point up but my other point is this is that why did this happen in Paris and
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:17.600]  not in New York City why did it happen in Paris and not in Washington DC and my
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.400]  question is why is it that we haven't seen something like this in America not
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.480]  that I'm advocating that it should mind you God forbid that's not what I'm
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:33.240]  advocating what I'm stating is is there a reason why sister fraud of 911 that
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:38.880]  Muslims have been cobbled and embraced and then thought of as a people that are
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:45.280]  not people to be feared and we've had no major event here in America is it
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:50.680]  because the somehow another Barack Hussein Obama having a Muslim name in
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:57.560]  Muslim ties and praising Islam that it has not taken place in here in New York
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:01.200]  and that we're looking to see this happen at some point but later on in a
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.800]  very violent way those are my two concerns something is suspicious here I
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:11.000]  mean when the West funds al Qaeda to take over Syria and then renames them
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.960]  ISIS and they double back and go into Iraq there's a very complex global
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:22.040]  destabilization going on here again in your gut in your discernment but also
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:27.080]  studying the news every day where do you see all this going well as you said
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:31.640]  something suspicious is happening here I mean we have joined forces with Al
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.280]  Qaeda in Syria as you have stated and been supportive of a large number of
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:44.040]  Islamic acts around the globe so are we being protected by because we are
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:50.640]  supportive of Islamic activity, jihadist activity, Al Qaeda, Taliban, ISIS
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:56.000]  I'm just suspicious that we haven't had any attack here in Paris or France has
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.120]  had and others have had as well there's somehow another dispute that we're being
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:04.840]  protected now listen I'm not encouraging that we should have an attack
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.880]  no I totally get it you're asking why is everybody else getting attacked and we're
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:11.680]  not absolutely well aren't we the big dog aren't we the biggest world power
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:16.240]  why should it would be the target of these kinds of attacks unless there's
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:22.000]  some sort of deal that's being cut that we don't know about that is advancing
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.120]  about the same time now not being attacked that we are opening up the
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:29.560]  doors for others to be attacked this is simply what I'm asking as a question
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:34.120]  well I think at a certain level that's definitely going on and then the army
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.760]  has to go over whenever Al Qaeda or ISIS gets outside the coloring and the
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:44.760]  numbers when they get off the reservation you know like a flock of locust a
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:49.360]  horde of locusts then our own military has to go in and actually fight the very
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:53.680]  group our own military has said they're fighting our own weapons
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:59.080]  you know ISIS is taking over Syria and part of the northern part of Syria and
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:06.760]  the western part of Iraq who is to say that ISIS did not do this event under
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:12.400]  the guise of protecting the the legacy or the the reputation of the Prophet
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:17.800]  Muhammad but but really what they want to do is to try to set up an Islamic
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:23.320]  state in France a nation that is very weak politically and very weak
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:27.840]  militarily I don't have a lot of respect for the military the French have
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.040]  totally given up their culture and even demographers say that it's been
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:36.400]  colonized by Islam with another generation will be Islamic so Germany
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:42.800]  absolutely so why would not this be a shot across the bow that I just would
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:47.480]  like to be able to take over France as well and this would be the way in
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:51.800]  demonstrating the striking fear in the hearts of both most French people and
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:56.520]  Parisians in particular that's my concern that those are my concerns about
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:00.640]  this event I think it's a horribly event you know I'm one with the people who are
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.640]  directly affected by this but I see a political motive behind all of this if
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:08.840]  you ask me all right shifting gears into other issues and then you're gonna
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:11.720]  leave us in 10 minutes and I appreciate your time I'll get back into this the
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:16.000]  latest news and a host of other issues including 10 earthquakes rocking North
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.360]  Texas centering around the cowboy stadium what a bizarre headline from CBS news
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:26.160]  but going back to Pastor Manning you are standing up for free speech going up
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:31.800]  against the kingpin there Al Sharpton recap what you announced last week how
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.880]  that's going and if you've had any repercussions going after the king of
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:42.680]  scum as you called him up there in Harlem. Al Sharpton in addition to being the
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:50.120]  king of scum is a liar he's a race baiter he is a pimp he's a snitch he's a rat
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:56.600]  he's a drug dealer and what we're proposing that MSNBC fires Al Sharpton
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:01.160]  has nothing to do with free speech but everything with the inciting of riotous
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:06.000]  behavior that has led to many deaths and we believe in fact the drums are
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.560]  stating that we're having a great inroad into the psyche of MSNBC first of all
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:15.440]  they don't have anybody listening to them watching them at all at present but
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:19.960]  the other thing is is that he is a liability to them I am mounting a
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:26.600]  campaign Alex calling it 70 million Americans strong and I'm looking at the
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:32.680]  number of Americans who have the right constitutional American beliefs Christian
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:38.040]  beliefs that we should all employ that to unite the boycott against every
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:44.480]  advertiser of MSNBC and to pull these 70 million strong together we are running a
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:48.400]  campaign by placing an end in the Wall Street trouble as I made mention of last
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:55.880]  week but also by having this kind of a boycott to take down Al Sharpton we can
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:00.280]  begin to cease the ability return to America again right now there's a wall
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:05.400]  there's a race war going on between young black men or black men in particular
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:11.160]  unknowingly and police officers I mean either one of the two groups don't know
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.880]  when there's going to be a confrontation that has been spawned by people like
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:20.400]  Obama Al Sharpton in particular and these recent if you will marches and
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:25.640]  protests that have been led by Al Sharpton most black men right now who are
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:32.840]  the reputable who don't have any beef with the police officers are now
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:37.480]  concerned that they may become targets because you police are very jumpy black
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.000]  people jumping and all of this because of Al Sharpton there is no reason why
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.440]  this man should continue to be on a venue like MSNBC we're gonna take him
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:53.600]  down that much I can promise America Al Sharpton will not be on MSNBC very much
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:24:02.680]  longer 70 million Americans are uniting to bring him down elaborate on why the
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:07.560]  power structure supports him so much well one of the way it is a very simple
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:15.360]  reason quite frankly racism sales racism drives black people to the polls it also
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:22.120]  drives white people to the polls as well racism is a great vote getter it raises
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:27.400]  funds it gets money and when you've got someone who says you can call and I
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:32.640]  probably shouldn't use this but it makes the point you can call Al Sharpton
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:40.280]  the Michael Jordan of races I mean he is a superstar and everybody knows it the
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:45.200]  Democrats love it the left the Leo Nenonist Leninist they love it so that's
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:50.320]  why he's so popular because he drives political votes he gets people out to
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:55.320]  the polls to get people elected basically simply on the on the basis of race
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:01.240]  itself but this has to stop America you cannot continue to function like this
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:07.120]  with such a small segment of his society 11 to 12 percent black people who are
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:12.880]  now wagging the dog through this racism business I'm calling for white America
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:18.400]  to step out of the shadows and stop being afraid of being called a racist I
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:21.880]  think that's one of the ways in which we've seen our nation go down the tubes
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.720]  and we have this race war going on now but that's the reason why he's so
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:32.360]  important and critical to the left well looking at 2015 now is it safe to say
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:38.280]  that 2014's the year that the race card was no longer king because it's still
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:44.440]  somewhat effective but more and more it's been so overused that if you don't
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:50.200]  support any part of the globalist agenda you're called a racist well people
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.280]  used to be afraid of being called racist but they're so sick of being called it
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:58.480]  when they're not that it just doesn't have the same effect anymore and it kind
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.320]  of worries me because then when you've got real racism going on and really
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:09.640]  unsavory stuff happening by either group it isn't even listened to anymore
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:13.480]  because people are getting sick of it I'm concerned that it's going to cause a
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:18.640]  revival of some white racism because people are going to be recruited by
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:24.080]  racist because they're sick of being called racist they're going to then buy
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:29.160]  into even more radical ideologies you know I would I would agree with you on
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:33.480]  the revival I don't know whether I would continue the thought that will be a
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:39.400]  revival of white races I think I might want to say that it would be a revival
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:48.280]  of patriots Christians who can be labeled nefarious in some degree but
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:51.800]  people who would say well that we've just had enough of this we've you know
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:55.920]  obviously that's going on I'm just talking about a minority a very small
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:00.280]  minority of whites that will then go to the other extreme because of the
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.080]  extreme black racism we see getting pushed towards whites I'm saying I
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:09.200]  think that's the attempt is the Balkanization well if you're talking
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:13.040]  about a very small group of people yeah you're going to have that I think in
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:17.760]  fact I'm sure that those groups are already strategizing on how they're
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:22.400]  going to deal with this but I think the larger issue here is how are we going to
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.920]  resolve it I mean I believe that by cutting off the head of the snake
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:33.840]  Al Sharpton that we can begin to bring civility back to America and we began
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:39.920]  we can begin to bring back harmony between the races I recognize as well
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.960]  that I'm going to take a lot of heat and already catching it as a result of
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:51.400]  having publicly stated that we are calling for MSNBC to fire Al Sharpton I
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:56.760]  realized that I understand that but I think ultimately in the end we're going
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.280]  to discover that even people who in some way may pass at least support Al
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:06.920]  Sharpton will recognize that he's done more damage to America as a nation and
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.400]  to black people in particular than you could ever begin to think about what
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:18.000]  any strong races white group have ever thought about doing to black people in
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.240]  terms of destruction of the families destruction of the morale probably the
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:26.880]  loss of employment capabilities and possibility doubling in black unemployment
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:32.520]  52% of abortions being black I mean the Democratic Party is a black killing
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:37.520]  machine right absolutely right so anything that any group that would rise
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:42.960]  up to consider doing would be minor if not minuscule compared to what Al
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:46.760]  Sharpton has already done no no I totally agree I'm saying people like Al
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:51.600]  Sharpton are there to make it a mindless racist debate instead of one about
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.920]  economics and real equality and the content of people's deeds and their
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:01.000]  hearts not tell what color they are yeah and and so you know the question you
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.840]  raise I think is a very poignant question how did he get to this position of
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.920]  being coddled you know Bill de Blasio the mayor of New York City calls him
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:15.360]  caught and stated early on before the killing of the two police officers and
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:21.720]  the Eric Garner the jury verdict that he calls Al Sharpton constantly for
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:27.760]  advice on the affairs of the city of New York he's an it is a deputy mayor or the
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:31.680]  assistant mayor you know there's something dreadfully wrong with the
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:35.760]  psyche of the American people that this is going on it's a sick joke it's a
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:39.840]  totally sick joke he's a clown he's a crook in my view doesn't even pay us
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:43.480]  taxes but wants to raise ours a pastor manning great job we'll get another

[01:40:52.640 --> 01:41:00.600]  these headlines Wall Street Journal schools on guard as flu deaths rise
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.600]  officials concerned this year's vaccine may not fully protect against the virus
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:09.560]  oh because they take it and then they die oh so it wasn't protecting against the
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:12.920]  virus it's like you shoot yourself in the head with a gun you go that wasn't
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:17.160]  protecting against gunshots stick your hand in the garbage disposal that wasn't
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:20.920]  protecting my hand against garbled garbage disposals that's how they spend
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:26.400]  it healthy Iowa three-year-old dies from flu after getting flu vaccine no it's
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:36.040]  died from flu vaccine flu victim fought hard family says 14 dead got a six-year-old
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:41.800]  dead here all in the same town where Rob has lived and Rob do news director of
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:46.880]  info wars nightly news is in here breaking this down I drug him in here to
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:49.440]  talk about this we're gonna play as report here in a minute or two but this
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:53.360]  is truly sickening that the Gardasil shot killed a bunch of people banned in
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:42:00.000]  Japan banned in India the same thing this is really sick I was talking to a
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.040]  lady I've known for six years saying your bell they told you your due date was
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:11.680]  the was the sixth oh they're gonna induce you don't let him induce you wait a
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:14.400]  few weeks there's a lot of complications a lot of problems I've been through it
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:18.000]  three kids she went in the doctor said we're gonna go ahead and induce you and
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.360]  is now having all these complications but they get more money I mean it's just
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:26.760]  like but people do what the medical system tells them Rob do well here's
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:31.280]  another one flu claims life of feisty Des Moines seven-year-old now this kid
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:34.480]  had a heart condition and he was on a list for a heart transplant but he was
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:38.800]  running around normal kid they get the flu shot have been vaccinated against
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:42.200]  the flu and but the family you know he was probably told by his doctors he had
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:45.960]  a heart problem made him it vulnerable and then he dies and these kids are
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:50.080]  dying very quickly after they get the flu shot then they get the flu and then
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.480]  next thing you know two three days later they're in the hospital on death well
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:57.040]  they tell pregnant women now take the shot until six years ago it said on the
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:01.120]  insert never do that yeah there are videos out the wazoo just doing this
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:04.440]  research and these are doctors that are sitting up there yet even pregnant
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.120]  women should get it and they're sitting there looking at the camera lying to
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:10.560]  people about how long is this video it's about five minutes long and it goes
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.880]  into a lot of different things I show some clips from different newscast talks
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:16.440]  about what's in the flu I know it's on the nightly news I usually watch the
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:19.680]  nightly news only caught part of it last night taking care of the kids but this
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:22.960]  is the dessert on the nightly news last night I mean you've got three children
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:27.200]  I've got three children it makes me physically ill I've done the research I
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:31.440]  wish they had clean vaccines I wish they were they're not no they're not I
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:35.080]  mean they admit they the flu shot has never helped anyone have you been
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:38.240]  confronted by people in stores or on the street so you better get your flu shot
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:41.880]  oh yeah and I tell him have you read the insert do you have you seen what's in
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:44.680]  what they want to inject in your body and I said it doesn't even protect you
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:48.160]  from this year's flu strain it never does they always ignorant and huff and
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:51.520]  puff well yeah and then they always have well the CDC said it mutated so
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:54.920]  there's nothing we could do about it that does that every year though that and
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:58.640]  every year we do this every year we come back to the same thing when we put out
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:01.800]  videos we did the one with the the Prozac the clown it's just like they said
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:05.360]  until the 70 cigarettes were good for your lungs and people in the 20s said
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:09.520]  they weren't they were called conspiracy theorists right vaccines are killing you
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:14.800]  folks it's a globalist operation just like the fluoride let's go to this the
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:17.920]  two kids in there they said perfectly healthy before that and they say that
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:21.960]  in that Wall Street Journal article most of the kids that die are no health no
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:25.240]  known health conditions except for getting the flu shot but they don't put
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:28.600]  it in all the articles well then they spin it they go yeah must mean the flu
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:33.160]  shot didn't defending them against the flu right exactly it's the flu shot doing
[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:37.280]  and it's not that it lowers your immunity bare minimum how many studies say
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.520]  that it attacks the brain that's it it causes autoimmune defense and then the
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:44.960]  cops come and say you shook the baby yeah it's sad it said it but you're
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:49.600]  blessed when the child just dies there at the clinic but if they die in the
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:53.480]  car at home or don't wake up you're going to jail see it's not enough to kill
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:57.760]  your kid they're gonna take you to prison as well so just go ahead go get
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:02.720]  induced for labor don't listen eat your GMO drink your fluoride drink your
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:08.320]  gas and just do it fine just believe the system let's go to Rob do's report
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:12.840]  info wars.com we're gonna post this video right now for radio listeners and
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:16.400]  info wars.com and present plan. The three-year-old Aisley McCarthy was buried
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:21.200]  today in Elkhorn her family tells me she died Monday morning at Blank Children's
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:26.800]  Hospital in Des Moines not even 48 hours after she started showing flu-like
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.840]  symptoms. Hey guys Rob do here for info wars.com and info wars nightly news and
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:35.240]  here's a story that I wanted to share with you and I want you to get this out
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.720]  to anybody you know especially if someone you know out there is thinking
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:42.360]  about getting the flu shot. Family's devastation after their healthy three-
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:46.160]  year-old daughter dies from flu less than 72 hours after she began feeling
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:50.880]  unwell and this is the story of Aisley McCarthy a beautiful little three-year-old
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:55.760]  girl who started complaining of symptoms just after Christmas and in 72 hours her
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.400]  parents were holding her in a wrapped up cloth at the hospital as she died in
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:04.880]  their arms. Very heartbreaking story and it really disturbed me as I read this
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:08.880]  article and then went to the source link which is the Des Moines register but
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:12.200]  here's what they had to say at Daily Mail. She began complaining to her mother
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:15.720]  that her legs hurt so much she couldn't walk and in less than 72 hours she'd be
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:20.680]  dead at Children's Hospital in Des Moines Iowa and of course the family is
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:25.320]  shocked and confused they don't know why she contacted this and was dead such a
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:29.120]  short while later but here's where it gets really interesting here in the
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:33.360]  Des Moines register healthy Iowa three-year-old dies from the flu third
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:38.880]  sentence down she was healthy and she had her flu shot said Amber McCarthy
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:44.440]  Aisley's mother the whole thing is unreal and it is unreal when you think about
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:47.640]  this day and age and we have all this medical technology that a little girl
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:52.320]  could get a flu shot and then become sick with the flu and actually the same
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:58.840]  types of flu that are in the flu shot and then die in 72 hours but what really
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:03.960]  angered me was a quote from the health department there in Polk County and this
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:07.720]  is Nola anger who said if people would get the flu shot it can limit the
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:11.840]  severity of flu symptoms if they do get it the shot offers protections for other
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:16.440]  strains this is a serious illness and can affect healthy people apparently it
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:21.800]  affected this little girl so they say in the Des Moines article that she came
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:27.800]  down with influenza type A and B let's look at what's in the flu shot here it
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:32.440]  is on the CDC website traditional flu vaccines called trivalent vaccines are
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:37.640]  made to protect against three flu viruses including influenza A H1N1
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:43.720]  influenza A H3N2 and an influenza B virus so if you go back to the Des Moines
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:47.480]  register article you'll see that she tested positive for influenza A and B at
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:52.000]  the time she was admitted into the hospital this year and my main tip is to
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.840]  not get the flu vaccine it's amazing how many people are sick and even the death
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:01.680]  set have occurred because what they're doing now is they're using these
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:07.720]  trivalent vaccines that protect against three strains of the flu and this year
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:18.560]  the 2014-2015 vaccine contains influenza A H3N2 and it contains influenza A H1N1
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:25.000]  that's right they actually put the H1N1 in this year's flu vaccine and influenza
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.080]  B now let's look at what else is in the flu shot this from Dr. Tinpenny.com the
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:33.080]  truth about the flu shot it also contains egg proteins including avian
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:38.240]  contaminant viruses gelatin which can cause allergies polysorbate 80 which is
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:42.200]  known to cause severe allergic reactions and also is associated with
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:47.720]  infertility and mice formaldehyde Triton X100 a strong detergent table sugar
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.520]  resin known to cause allergic reactions an antibiotic and thimerosal mercury
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:57.680]  which is still in the multi-dose viral flu shot vaccines. Mercury containing
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:01.760]  vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:05.680]  journal pediatrics there have been widespread concerns that mercury based
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.160]  preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:13.320]  children these new studies suggest that the opposite that the preservatives may
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:17.880]  actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance so these
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:21.080]  are also the things that you're injecting into your children and into
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:24.640]  your elderly parents and into yourself if you get the flu shot in addition to
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:28.320]  three different types of flu viruses doctors told the family the cause of
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:34.200]  death was a combination of influenza A influenza B and sepsis the family says
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:39.360]  before Saturday Aisley was perfectly healthy and had no pre-existing medical
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:44.920]  conditions and so the mother in this story Amber is left with no child and
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:48.360]  wondering why she did everything right she said she had her child vaccinated
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:52.200]  she even got the flu shot and this is what happened it's still the same
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.960]  outcome she succumbed to the virus that she was supposed to be in protected
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.480]  against that's because it really doesn't offer you protection and you can read
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:02.200]  that on the insert they just say that so they could get these people out there
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:05.600]  and get these flu vaccines into people and some money-making scheme and what
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:08.920]  does it do for most people it makes them sick which will then make them go to the
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:12.480]  doctor which then they'll be prescribed more drugs and don't take my word for it
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:15.280]  there's countless of other people out there that have done studies on the flu
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:19.680]  vaccine and it's in effectiveness they found that if someone your neighbor or
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.040]  kids in school or anybody that you hang out with got the flu vaccine that it
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:30.840]  can spread to other people for 17 for up to 17 to 25 days later so you need to
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:34.120]  look at this story I'm providing the links below you can read it for yourself
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:39.020]  and you need to feel bad for this family because they were caught up in the
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:42.120]  ruse they were caught up in the medical industrial complex ruse that's right
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:44.800]  hey if you get the flu shot you'll be protected there's about a minute left of
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.480]  the report it's very powerful audio it's powerful but video we have all the

[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:17.080]  calm and prison planet calm a log bar God is great mass terrorists with
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:20.760]  collision of cops and rocket launcher said prior to killing staff at French
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:26.560]  magazine that's info wars calm media censoring Muhammad
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:31.240]  cartoons amid Paris shooting even the London independent now in tweets and
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:38.120]  previous articles they did on it is blurring out the magazine so we're
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:43.880]  going to click on that article media censoring Muhammad cartoons and we're
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:47.600]  going to I guess involve ourselves in the great mega thought crime of us
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.760]  showing it look how they've blurred it out right there if you're a radio
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:54.640]  listener go to the website and you can see it truly disgusting and then I was
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:58.320]  reading the magazine is there's PDFs online we should post some of those in
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:06.640]  our articles very mild stuff but if it was extreme that is their free speech
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:10.720]  I mean this is just crazy only in America do we say come here and we'll
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:16.520]  give you free everything or come to France leave you free welfare and then
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:21.840]  all of this goes on but but separately on the issue of the flu vaccine if
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.200]  something was like the black plague and was killing people in mass and they had
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:28.080]  an inoculation against them that had danger but they admitted the cost
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:33.920]  benefit analysis and in the greater some I thought I could get black plague or my
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:41.800]  kids could I might decide to take a vaccine but I've researched it most
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:46.880]  people got polio from the polio vaccine including my grandmother a month that
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:52.560]  she'd been vaccinated most people in Europe in Eastern Europe in Central
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:57.040]  Asia get it after they've taken it look it up they have flu shot trials all the
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:01.280]  time it's like homeless people and they'll vaccinate 40 and 25 of them die
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:07.720]  you can just search that term homeless dying bird flu test and it's like oh
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:12.240]  they're just dead it's no big deal I remember once when a Rick Perry's top
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:16.000]  people came to my showing of in game at the Albany draft house and he called I
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.560]  remember as I've seen you on television yeah I mean he goes yeah I spend the
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:22.640]  army and medic and yes take troops in and give shots they'd be dead two days
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:25.000]  later we have to wear like you know basically spacesuits and they're
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.680]  cleaning it up I don't know what they were giving them there it is London
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:35.440]  telegraph again homeless people died for bird flu vaccine trial in Poland I said
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:39.760]  25 died I was just going for memory how many to say died it was 20 something the
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:46.080]  issue I'm getting at here is this is not my opinion so do you know how they cook
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.600]  up I mean the the anthrax shots were killing the troops in mass back in 2000
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:54.360]  2001 till the army doctors refused to give the shots they started court
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:57:00.200]  marshaling some but then backed off and stopped it bunch of journalists died that
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:05.360]  went on with the military when they give smallpox in 2003 it was killing them
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:09.040]  causing heart attacks it causes an immune response in the heart and the
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:14.120]  brain folks it'll kill you almost everyone I know has either almost died or
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:21.600]  has family that almost died or did die in my family my personal trainer knows
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:26.400]  people you know people rob that almost died and I went on this brief jag I want
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:29.800]  to get your brief take on this in the next segment then we've got calls coming
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:34.000]  up and the latest on what's happening with this whole shooting in France the
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.760]  new distraction but within it is a larger debate it's important I had a
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:43.200]  different doctor another doctor to last two children it's a catch-and-play to I
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:46.560]  don't want to have a kid at home in the bathtub I admire people that do it and
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:50.640]  statistically I've seen the numbers they're safer than a hospital but I want
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:56.560]  to have a hospital I want to have a doctor the day my wife was due they said
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:00.600]  we're inducing you tomorrow you're having a kid well back in the old days back
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:02.600]  when they knew what they were doing because by the way infant mortality has
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:08.000]  gone back up now look it up in the US they would wait at least a week or two
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.760]  or three depending on the position of the baby before they would induce then the
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:16.560]  cervix doesn't dilate properly but then they get to do cesareans they get to do
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:20.960]  epidurals spinal blocks and they get five times more money and I told this lady I
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:24.120]  know who's a friend of mine I like her I said don't vaccinate here's the
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:27.440]  statistics and they're gonna try to induce you they even try to set the
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:31.360]  dates early now to always induce they want to make childbirth totally unnatural
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:34.840]  it'll soon be a conspiracy theory that women ever had a bad boy she still went
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:39.200]  in let them do it add the complications I mean it's just incredible we'll be back

[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:32.960]  to hear from military people police officers you name it with a view on the
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:37.160]  footage the shooters we're already hearing that they're actors with no
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:40.840]  evidence of that I'm being attacked as a government stooge by commenters on
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:46.080]  info wars.com show me some evidence Sandy Hook is his phonies a $3 bill I
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:50.240]  caught blue screens the same kids going back in the school we have top school
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:54.360]  safety experts that wrote the book on it saying it's fake on and on and on for
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:01:02.120]  days but it's not all fake ladies and gentlemen there's a lot of real stuff
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:08.200]  out there and let me tell you they're shooting that cob in the head that looks
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:15.080]  real I mean I've had to shoot animals that have been
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:18.320]  shoot up by Cody's and her have a lot of cows you name it deer that are caught
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:21.080]  up in fences I know what it looks like when you walk up and shoot a mammal in
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:25.680]  the head at close that's exactly what it looks like looks I'll tell you or
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:29.720]  special effects then see we're over here trying to find reality we're not
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:33.720]  conspiracy theorist then you've got the establishment that puts out its own
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:36.840]  delusions and then people online that they can put out whatever reality they
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:42.160]  want I'm looking for the real reality Rob do any take of finishing up on your
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:47.320]  wife and then and then trying to induce her or whatever and then any comments on
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:51.560]  this situation that just took place in Paris well with the video there you can
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:55.760]  actually see the ricochet coming I guess it either went through the guy's
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:00.560]  head or behind but you can see something hit the sidewalk you know
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:04.000]  following the path of the bullet so I don't think that's fake at all that
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.040]  looks like totally real what happened well deer get caught a lot in fences
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:12.000]  cattle fences and you'll see one in total pain sometimes tied up for a week
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.120]  and a fancy go and shoot it in the head I mean I haven't taken pleasure in a
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:18.120]  cow that had its back broken and cows have been eating on it it was still a
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:21.480]  lot of they did the back first I shot it in the head I mean I'm not I'm not I am
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:24.400]  proud of that took out of its misery but I know what it looks like it looks real
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:28.440]  to me yeah and then with what you were talking about was getting induced with
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:34.160]  my third son when he was born the doctor wanted to induce my wife and she was
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:38.160]  already in labor and they wanted to break her water to make it speed up the
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:43.160]  process and I personally believe it was because the doctor wanted to you know
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:46.080]  she was there for eight hours and she wanted it to be done in her shift and
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:49.200]  didn't see if it's one thing if you're in labor already that that's bad enough
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.960]  what about when you're not in labor and they induce it yeah well yeah it's I
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:56.400]  there's so many other things that can happen with with my first son there was
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:59.400]  an army of specialists that came in because she had a blood pressure issue
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:03.960]  that came in and we're standing there in the back of the hospital of the room and
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:06.400]  I said what are these guys here for and they were just all standing there she
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:09.360]  goes well they're here in case anything happens I'm like what what what could
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:14.280]  happen after the baby was born fine they all march out that was a $10,000 bill
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:20.000]  for having those guys just stand there $10,000 yeah so the screw job by the
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.080]  hospitals the screw jobs by the insurance companies now their answer is a bigger
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:28.280]  screw good job called Obamacare exactly and then with this the flu video if you
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:31.400]  watch the end of it there's a doctor Oz talking about how people need to get
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:34.240]  their flu shot to protect everybody he talks about the risks but then he says
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:38.200]  he doesn't give his kids the flu shot because his wife won't let him so we
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:41.800]  need to have parents out there stand up to the system and if your kid happens to
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:45.800]  die of the flu shot or has some complications after we get out there
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:48.920]  and talk about it don't be afraid to talk about it to warn other people you
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:52.280]  don't want this happening to other people's children exactly and look
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:56.080]  tetanus shot even though they're caught spiking it more than anyone because they
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:00.360]  can really manipulate you in the genetics with that by adding pathogens to
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:04.600]  it I won't go off on a jag about it but a tetanus shot you could argue for or a

[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:18.600]  going on they've been tweeting at real Alex Jones with hashtag the name of the
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:28.480]  newspaper Charlie Hebdo I still have trouble pronouncing that now let's move
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:35.760]  into some of the other news that I have here in my stack Hawaii breaks records
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:41.160]  winter weather breaks records again in Hawaii with cold weather and they've
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:47.080]  also a few weeks ago had snow on their mountain tops Star Tribune reports that

[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:58.240]  they're saying that that's global warming that is causing that Kit Daniels wrote
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:05.880]  a story for info wars.com global warming fee added to California gas prices
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:10.920]  remember George Soros and everybody came out Larry Summers in the White House
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:13.640]  came out and said now it's time for carbon taxes because gas prices are down
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:18.040]  you may accept it well California just went ahead and did it global warming
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:22.320]  fee added to California gas prices before sales tax drivers now paying a tax
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:26.240]  on top of global warming tax California drivers are now paying a little
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:29.520]  warming fee added to the price of gasoline before sales tax forced them to
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:34.360]  pay a tax on top of a tax the state is charging gas retailers a new global
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:38.360]  warming cap and trade fee and paying it right to Al Gore and Clinton and other
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:42.600]  kingpins it's got to be nice doesn't it and retailers are passing the cost on
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:46.840]  to consumers but the consumer sales tax is calculated from the full pump price
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:50.800]  which includes the cap and trade fee you know they're not smart here they like
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:54.640]  to rub it in our face Australia passed the carbon tax four years ago but they
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:58.720]  passed a law that you couldn't tell people about it and couldn't add it on
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:04.400]  to the bill still people backlash and it's been partly repealed
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:11.440]  continuing here with news House Republican files first plan to defund
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:21.280]  Obama immigration action that's lawmaker in Alabama Martha Robbie so that's
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:27.880]  definitely a good move there 10 earthquakes rock north Texas in 25 hours

[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:12.560]  your phone calls right now police military I want your take if you've
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:17.320]  seen the footage of the shooters killing the cop shooting the people screaming
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:20.160]  Allah Akbar they look pretty professional they're doing military
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:25.480]  hand signs have come to me and rally point this is where we're meeting we're
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:32.200]  going let's go ahead and go to Wayne in Texas former military on the shooting
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:39.200]  topic what do you think watching those videos Alex it looks real to me I mean
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:49.680]  these guys are dressed in almost like almost like a police what outfit and I
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:54.760]  think it's another precondition force everything they roll out on us they
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:15:00.680]  roll out over there first in Europe and in those Middle Eastern countries so you
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:07.280]  know here we are once again with all the money that we spend on defense open
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:14.480]  borders no water patrol you know we've got all these issues that are being
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:19.720]  financed and they're not working that the war on drugs not working but we're
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:24.960]  financing it and you know all these other schemes that they've dreamed up on
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:32.720]  us this once again it's just a preconditioning that it's real but you
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:38.280]  know all Seattle is all over it in my opinion well I mean I couldn't say it
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:42.400]  any better and it was a famous quote I forget who said it that when you make
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:48.240]  wars unprofitable you will make wars impossible you've got criminal interest
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:51.880]  worldwide playing countries and groups off against each other who make money
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:57.600]  and get power and who can take liberties out of global destabilization and
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:01.720]  crisis it looks real to me I don't think it's actors I don't think it's a
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:06.000]  staged event the question is then who would really do this how why would Al
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:10.280]  Qaeda who normally acts like a bunch of idiots when you see videos of them be
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:15.520]  able to carry out 9-11 or speak perfect French and carry this operation out so
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:22.080]  well this doesn't look like the normal boobies that we see in their own videos
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:29.120]  what do you say no no not at all and a matter of fact I mean we're admitted as
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:33.760]  training them I mean the American forces have trained these guys the CIA is
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:39.120]  trained these guys so why wouldn't they look like us or are they us you know is
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:45.000]  the CIA standing in front of you or is it Al Qaeda that has been trained by those
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.600]  guys yeah you know you got to get down to these questions and say you know who's
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:55.840]  really behind it well Tony Schaefer our frequent guest who's also trained with a
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:01.360]  CIA and of course worked me running major operations in Afghanistan says that
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:06.040]  quote they were very professional very organized it was well-timed you can't
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:09.560]  pull off something like this without military training he said whoever they
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:14.560]  were they were highly trained in military tactics so you got these two
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:18.200]  different al Qaeda's it doesn't make sense something is suspicious thank you
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:23.720]  Wayne Paul and Boston's former military then we'll talk to him and Washington
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:27.720]  there's a police officer and then Tom and Michigan Paul what do you think's
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:33.640]  going on here Alex hi first-time caller what you know what Alex I've been
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:38.480]  watching this video over and over again from that I guess it's a shooting
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:45.680]  standpoint right out in front of the the actual event of the the the
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:50.400]  assassination of that police officer I keep what it's just a little unusual
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:58.000]  because you can see like if you watch it you can see the fire the gun like pin
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:04.080]  off off the ground and you can see like a spark off like face cement but I mean
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:10.400]  that could be calibrated to just what it was the word I'm thinking of of some
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:15.120]  like a dud but well I mean I've done a lot of shooting videos and I've slowed
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:20.200]  down the footage and when you shoot at an angle like that that's exactly what
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:25.200]  firearms do you can kill somebody at about an inch away or two inches away
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:31.640]  with a rifle point blank with a handgun that's shooting blanks just the gas and
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:34.320]  by the way that's an untraceable way to kill somebody I'm not telling about any
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:38.440]  secrets I'm not telling killers any secrets you can put like a 357 Magnum
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:43.320]  somebody's head with a blank and it will fire gas into the person's brain
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:47.960]  scrambling their brain it'll shoot a hole through the skull if you put it snug
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:51.960]  up against them and there's no ballistics because there is no bullet but
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:58.120]  that's another another day go ahead right where I see that he's wounded on
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:02.240]  the ground like I I mean just watch I mean I'm saying from video I mean it
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:06.560]  seemed pretty clear that you didn't see I'm not saying I'm not trying to be rude
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:10.360]  not trying to be anything like no blood splurge or anything that even before
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:14.840]  like wherever this police officer was wounded and I know you're saying that it
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:18.320]  looks real and stuff like that and you know everyone has their opinion it just
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:24.640]  looks a little on especially at that close range you don't really see anything
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:30.920]  at the last resort of this terrorist well I mean I've shot a lot of wild hogs
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:34.640]  in the head and deer that I wounded when you come up 20 months later and they're
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:39.800]  still alive and I've shot shot him in the head and there's and then a lot of
[02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:42.880]  times there's not a lot of blood it depends on how the bullet goes in but
[02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:49.280]  when when he shoots him in the head he's there on the ground five seconds
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:53.080]  later you really don't see a bunch of blood but that's pretty routine I don't
[02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:56.080]  know I mean when you get to the point where you just don't believe anything's

[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:29.600]  give us his take on what we're seeing unfold in Paris where the newspaper the
[02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:35.680]  satirical newspaper like the onion it's not even as hardcore as the onion as
[02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:40.400]  irreverent as the onion got attacked 12 dead including two police officers who
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:43.920]  do you think has a motive in this do you see anything what do you think watching
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:51.360]  the footage what's your gut yeah good afternoon well welcome in what's your
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:58.180]  view on this well I it's obvious okay the police officer was executed I don't
[02:24:58.180 --> 02:25:03.680]  know if the coppers or the regular patrol officers carry weapons in Paris on
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:08.520]  duty I couldn't tell from the footage they do most of them carry guns okay
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:13.640]  but very obvious I don't know why he did return fire maybe his arms were injured
[02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:17.580]  but it's sad I've been there I lost a partner several years ago that was
[02:25:17.580 --> 02:25:22.800]  murdered by an illegal alien so I've been there and I feel for his family and
[02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:28.800]  co-workers it's terrible but I I think you're right Mr. Jones he said several
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:33.920]  times in the past I think we're gonna see more of this around the world and I
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:39.640]  know in my area we're training up to combat this problem I mean we have I
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:42.720]  mean you don't know if you've never been involved in shooting you don't know
[02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:46.080]  how you're gonna react until you're there but we are definitely trained to
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:51.880]  fight through it get rid of the threat and I know that we're all on alert we've
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:56.520]  got heads on our swivel eat from the big town to a small town because I could
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:59.960]  tell the police and Austin are on alert they're really jumping now when I see
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:05.640]  them well this is the thing though in the area I work in we work well with our
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:11.040]  with our you know the citizens I mean we're we're we're servants and I'm I'm
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:15.080]  grateful that most people in our area respect us and we respect them and we
[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:20.720]  don't have the issues they're going on these bigger cities so I'm I'm thankful
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:24.720]  and blessed in that area but I do think that there is gonna be a war on police I
[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:28.480]  think there's gonna be a war on just average citizens I think that the
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:34.280]  globalists have an agenda and let me tell you fear breeds new rules and people
[02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:38.040]  are willing to give up anything for freedom or for security and that's and
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:42.440]  that's scary because you get neither well as best we can tell a cop car pulled
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:48.160]  up and they shot him in the car then the cop basically fell out of the car as
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:54.120]  best we can tell and these shooters had amazing precision at up to 150 yards
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:57.920]  they were shooting into moving vehicles front windshields and taking out the
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:02.680]  driver so just like Colonel Schaefer said these people were highly trained not
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:07.040]  your run of the mill Al Qaeda yeah but I'm talking about the officer though that
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:10.440]  was on the sidewalk when the guys got out of the no I understand yes yes you're
[02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:13.480]  talking about that one that got shot in the head well it's just horrible
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:16.880]  footage to watch it and then we're hearing how we have to give up free
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:21.640]  speech and give in to the threat and we're hearing how we've got to give up
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:25.840]  our rights no we shouldn't give up any rights in the face of this we should
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:30.000]  proliferate the right to use arms whether it be about police or anybody else
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:36.440]  so that an armed society can repel these type of bullies I agree but let me
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:41.920]  just let me just leave it on this note so that people can talk police officers
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:46.280]  citizens whatever listen we can't give up our freedom that that is the goal that
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:51.040]  these these elitists around the world want and they're going to bring it by
[02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:56.480]  fear and let me tell you if you're going to be cowardly and it's like these
[02:27:56.480 --> 02:28:00.000]  knuckleheads that keeps saying that kill the police and all that I guarantee you
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:03.200]  if somebody's kicking down their door at two o'clock in the morning they're
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.920]  gonna be cowering in their corner urinating themselves trying to call
[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:10.240]  911 and you know what we're gonna show up regardless of how they feel about us
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:15.040]  because that's our job so that the people that are protesting police I
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:18.720]  don't really listen to them I mean a lot of them are just they're just I think
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:21.560]  like you said they're bait they're silver spoon babies you know they have
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:24.320]  nothing better to do than complain and they don't like to be told what to do
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:29.600]  and we have a segment of society that is that way they do not like to be held
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:33.240]  accountable and they don't like to be told when they make mistakes well sure the
[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:36.720]  cop of guys that are the street shooting cops will beat up an old man because
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:40.720]  it's an easy target or knock out some old lady and you know next they'll be
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:45.480]  praying on you know you know their own mom but yeah a lot of the people online
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:49.720]  shooting their mouths off they're like video game heads I'm not saying all
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:52.400]  video game heads are bad I'm just saying it they tend to be video game heads as
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:55.440]  we've gone back and looked at their handles and who they are and they're in
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:59.960]  a fantasy land so they think it's manly to talk about killing people when I
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:03.160]  guarantee you if they blew somebody's brains out they'd start throwing up or
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:05.800]  they wouldn't have the nerve to pull the trigger you know in the real world or
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:08.880]  once they did they'd realize it wasn't a video game and they would start crying
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:12.840]  for mommy and that's why so many people say let's just get a civil war going
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:16.560]  well that's obviously what the globalist want that's why we've got to stop it

[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:35.000]  that's not why he joins us just for about 10-15 minutes then I go to Mark Tom
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:40.520]  Mike and others I wanted to just out of the gates he has a lot of sources and
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:43.960]  intelligence agencies all over the world cover up some books with Tom Clancy
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:47.200]  former head of psychological operations of the State Department ran the camp
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:51.080]  David Accord's help found the Delta Force you know who he is came out and
[02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:54.880]  told us about the bin Laden situation 12 years before it turned out to be
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:35:00.760]  accurate exposed 9-11 as a stand-down bare minimum he joins us former member
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:04.360]  of the council on farm relations before he resigned he joins us I don't know
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:08.560]  what he's gonna say I don't know his view I didn't know Wayne Madsen's view
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:12.680]  earlier from the Twitter comments at real Alex Jones I'm hearing people think
[02:35:12.680 --> 02:35:16.520]  it's Israel that's about a third of the Twitter comments or they think it's fake
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:23.360]  and TV fakery you know I mean Sandy Hook was fake we had blue screens and the
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:26.640]  kids going in circles and out of the building and it wasn't even really a
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:31.600]  real school that we can prove is fake some stuff is fake but this looks real
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:38.040]  to me maybe I'm wrong maybe Steve Pachinik Dr. Steve Pachinik can correct
[02:35:38.040 --> 02:35:42.560]  me doc I don't know your view on this but give us your first approximation or
[02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:45.920]  maybe you've talked to your sources and know what happened what are you hearing
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:49.760]  about what went on in Paris Alex always a pleasure to come on your show but let
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:53.000]  me tell you I grew up in France and to lose and I'm looking at one of the
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:58.920]  cartoons which literally implies exactly what it's gonna happen we are always
[02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:04.080]  on alert and we want to wish you a happy new year until the end of January we
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:08.160]  have not been attacked so far so from my point of view this is a highly
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:13.520]  provocative newspaper cartoon it's not about freedom of speech it is about
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:18.440]  provocation it is about instigation in the world of intelligence this type of
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:25.400]  agitation propaganda cartoon would require an attack by Al Qaeda whether
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:29.560]  it was a Yemeni or not that's not as relevant as the fact that I think this
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:34.080]  is a major distraction this attack from the real problem that Hollande has in
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:38.800]  France which is a major bankruptcy of the economy the fact that Hollande has
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:43.440]  been a total disaster the fact that socialism is a disaster the unemployment
[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:48.480]  is up into the 20th the fact that euro is falling repeatedly oil is going down
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:54.000]  so this to me is nothing more than an opportunity occasion for distraction
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.000]  intentionally or unintentionally it's not relevant but the French have a very
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:02.200]  good intelligence system it's called a disdain bureau they know exactly what to
[02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:06.800]  do they know how to go in to ask the people and they have as anywhere from
[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:12.680]  about six to about 15 million legal and illegal first second and third
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:18.280]  generation Moroccans Algerian and Maghreb Muslims they know the problems
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:22.200]  are there but the real issue Dan is not the freedom of speech this is
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:27.040]  absolute nonsense what this was these cartoons as I'm looking at them are
[02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:31.160]  nothing more than incredible agitation propaganda on the part of the French
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:36.640]  which reflects no no ability to express freedom of so what is the point of the
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:41.120]  edge of prop we know prop was that to distract from a much major but much more
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:45.960]  to be a problem Europe is falling apart France and Germany cannot get along
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:51.200]  Germany has warned repeatedly on the Merkel that France must remain under a
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:56.080]  sphere program France cannot do it France is bankrupt in effect their
[02:37:56.080 --> 02:38:00.080]  sovereign funds are almost empty they cannot maintain so are you saying
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:03.880]  Hollanda or the French intelligence may have staged this well I don't know if
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:07.360]  they stage it but they certainly allowed it to happen because here's a cartoon
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:12.320]  that says so far hey we're okay until the end of January and lo and behold they
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:15.680]  got attacked just at the point by the way I haven't seen all those and I don't
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:19.560]  speak French like you do French but if you look at the various cartoons you
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:23.440]  can see this is far more than freedom that's breaking news tell me can you
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:26.680]  tell me what issue that is so we can find it well it's the latest issue it's
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:31.120]  literally the one that says to George they got down down on France that means
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:35.560]  that don't date it means wait watch we are okay to the end of January we haven't
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:40.000]  been attacked so far and literally if that's not an invitation for an attack
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:44.360]  either intentional or unintentional I would be surprised well I mean it did
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:48.800]  come out when this first broke three years ago that this facility is connected
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:54.360]  to the CIA and British intelligence but I mean a lot of stuff's connected to
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:58.400]  intelligence if this was intelligence I would say this is very poor intelligence
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:02.920]  because when you do agitation propaganda you don't really have to go out of your
[02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:08.760]  way and show a Mohammed the Holy Prophet Mohammed as a gay you don't have to say
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:12.960]  that the Quran is shit these are things that are totally beyond the realm of
[02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:18.920]  even effective intelligence it shows a very low level of our effectiveness the
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:23.880]  French British or American just the way we did in 9-11 this is shows you such
[02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:28.600]  immaturity in terms of intelligence and in freedom of speech that you know this
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:32.800]  is just waiting to happen whether it was intentional or not sure let me shift
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:38.360]  gears and throw a curveball at you huge news breaking with Clinton and others
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:43.360]  connected to this big financier convicted of pedophilia with dungeons in
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:46.960]  the Caribbean and all this I mean clearly some of that stuff's going on the
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:51.600]  royal family connected to it but the question is why is it all coming out
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:58.320]  now it just reeks of an internal power structure blackmail war and notice this
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:01.640]  has gotten that out of the papers do you have any intel on that well what I would
[02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:07.320]  say and I wrote it this way that Alan Dershowitz who's been me a puppet boy for
[02:40:07.320 --> 02:40:12.600]  the Israeli lobby repeatedly has been attacked and this is let's say the way
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:18.000]  of the system retaliates to say okay enough is enough Israel's out of control
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:22.560]  you out of this with you're out of control you can denigrate it your
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:27.960]  legitimacy is in question at the same time it's a clear message to Hillary
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:32.400]  Clinton and the Clinton family in general to stand down under no condition
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:36.480]  should she proceed to run in the elections because this is only the
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:41.080]  beginning of what's going to come out in the future and it's going to be much
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:46.480]  worse because Bill Clinton will be the one person who will literally deny
[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:51.760]  Hillary Clinton the presidency of the United States he did in 2008 he will do
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:58.400]  it again in 2016 his narcissism is so malignant that he cannot help but destroy
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:03.000]  Hillary Clinton and the process and that's what he's doing it's a bad sign
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:06.480]  that they've been defending this pedophile and so have the royals
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:10.880]  circling the wagons you know the royal family isn't royal it's a German family
[02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:14.760]  they're not very bright they're quite stupid the real royal family is really
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:20.040]  the Queen mother who was Scottish and Diane Spencer that's royal the Windsor
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:23.840]  is the nothing more than the name of the building in which they live in most of
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:28.600]  them are German and they are total idiots they have nothing to do but if
[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:32.160]  Brent wants to pay for idiots they'll be there well you know that's actually true
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:36.240]  you know most of Queen Elizabeth's brothers and sisters are mentally ill
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:40.560]  because of the inbreeding and have to be locked up in fact stupid I mean well
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:44.680]  whatever the reason is if you want to pay a fortune and then England can't afford
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:48.760]  it they're going to be leaving the euro and the pound is not all that great
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:52.840]  England has not been moving and they have a very serious unemployment problem
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:56.080]  you want to pay that kind of money for idiots that's your that's your
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:41:59.800]  prerogative I don't believe in it the United States didn't believe in it we
[02:41:59.800 --> 02:42:05.040]  fought three wars against Britain one in the 1776 the second one in 1812 the
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:09.040]  third one the Civil War so we don't need to talk about Britain France is a
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:12.360]  problem France has to get its act together but I think it will be a
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:16.560]  totally bankrupt you made an astute statement there it is on record but
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:20.360]  most people don't know it deep in the history that British intelligence did
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:24.480]  stir up the South and kicked off the whole Civil War and then denied the
[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:28.720]  South the armaments they promised them once it started but that didn't end up
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:32.680]  working that's no British intelligence was the one that literally wanted us to
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:36.240]  be broken apart it did not want a republic because the Republic would have
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:40.480]  been a very severe threat to its financial interest mercantile and then
[02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:44.520]  subsequently Queen Victoria was the greatest drug pusher in the world
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:49.040]  sure they talk about it the great with Adam now she was the greatest drug
[02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:54.440]  pusher in the world with opium and cocaine coming right out of China so the
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:58.480]  nonsense of Britain it's really the nonsense of Britain more importantly we
[02:42:58.480 --> 02:43:02.080]  have to understand where America stands in this and the fact that we are not
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:07.200]  threatened by these acts if we do stupid things like the CIA torture or the
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:12.560]  stand down or our military goes out of its way to facilitate stupid acts then
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:16.920]  we will pay you know the price that we need to pay and we will internally
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:20.920]  punish our own people but as far as France is concerned they have a very
[02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:24.840]  good intelligence system and they have a very strong national police force but
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:28.800]  for me to believe that this was accidental or unintentional very hard
[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:33.520]  given the fact that I'm reading these cartoons in French and they're way out
[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:38.320]  of proportion this is beyond disrespect of any religion if you put Christianity
[02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:43.000]  in the same position you would be ashamed and appalled are you saying it's
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:48.640]  beyond it's beyond the public financing of piss Christ I'm sorry remember the
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:53.040]  famous crucifix and urine yes I know the man I mean I know the man who did it
[02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:57.080]  he was a friend of Bloomberg it was a Brooklyn Museum it was ridiculous it
[02:43:57.080 --> 02:44:01.160]  did nothing more than to get his name in the paper and nobody remembered it no
[02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:05.200]  I know but I mean here's what I'm saying it is true that there's a lot of
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:09.480]  anti-islam stuff meant to be provocative and it gets ignored Christianity sure
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:12.680]  sure but I mean this did get a lot of attention at the time and it appeared
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:17.520]  they were hyping this up if this was a long-term operation what is the point
[02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:20.680]  I mean you've seen the video obviously of the shooters they look very
[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:26.040]  professional Colonel Schafer says they look like above Al Qaeda what do you
[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:29.960]  who do you think they are I mean any ideas very well trained Yemeni whether
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:33.760]  they were supported by the French who have very strong presence in the Maghreb
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:39.400]  and in Yemen near Saudi Arabia the French have had the foreign legion which
[02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:46.200]  you can put you wow and then get in Calvi and of course you know the French
[02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:50.720]  have allowed this to happen it's as simple as that if this is not anything
[02:44:50.720 --> 02:44:54.840]  that's you know a higher-order intelligence it occurred in Toulouse when
[02:44:54.840 --> 02:45:00.120]  you had a sole bomber who shot a few several orthodox Jews that was real and
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:05.320]  now hold on and classically you have a country that isn't such a city I can't
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:10.520]  tell you how bad shape France is in that it's beyond redemption if they don't get
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:14.840]  rid of Hollande they don't get rid of the socialist system they don't get rid of
[02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:20.240]  yeah they have a hundred percent tax excuse me 101 percent tax on the
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:25.080]  basically new vorice now why and then the socialists have been caught with secret
[02:45:25.080 --> 02:45:30.120]  Swiss bank accounts and they don't pay the taxes just like you know the rat
[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:34.640]  from New York Al Sharpton wants to raise my taxes but he owes five and a half
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:39.120]  million that's correct but why would you want to stay in France unless you
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:43.560]  unwell fit most of the people there are looking for retirement even the young
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:47.680]  kids in their fifties right now when they go into 20 when they come into the
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:52.080]  workforce to the age of 20 to 50 they're looking at about retirement there is no
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:56.600]  money in France the euro is not worth anything you're talking about the
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:46:00.920]  collapse of the euro this is way beyond you've been saying that for years but
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:06.600]  now it's now every demographic shows it now how when is it coming in and what
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:10.840]  will it cost coming now the euro has been falling from one three four to one
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:15.040]  one nine it'll go down way below one because the price of oil they're not
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:19.760]  able to grow there is absolutely no growth capacity within France the
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:24.160]  unemployment has always been secret if you want to talk about freedom of speech
[02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:27.920]  the fact is the French government it's been one of the biggest liars and
[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:32.640]  miscreant behavior in the world including Sarkozy and the socialists
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:39.120]  they've been putting around factories all over France shutting them down and
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:41.840]  then declaring they were bankrupt or they're not bankrupt and they're
[02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:45.560]  shifting around everybody but they're not producing anything other than wine
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:49.440]  and cheese and a nuclear power they really can't produce very much
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:54.560]  airbus is about the only plane that will be sold at this price at a much lower
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:47:02.480]  value and then Germany's gone off a demographic cliff they're dying Spain
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:07.800]  Italy right now Italy has 45 percent unemployment Spain has 25 percent on
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:13.240]  employment Portugal 25 percent unemployment Sweden is anti-Islam Holland
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:19.520]  anti-Islam Britain anti-Islam France has has just begun to see the beginning to
[02:47:19.520 --> 02:47:25.040]  what anti-Islam is every day you can go to Paris or Toulouse or Balboa any city
[02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:30.280]  and you will see protests either against working against the system or pro-Islam
[02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:34.640]  anti-Islam the country's dysfunction just a bunch of idiots fighting with each
[02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:37.680]  other yeah I've talked to family that's been over to France lately and who
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:41.360]  have been there many times and they say there'll be a leak in the hotel pouring
[02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:45.840]  water and no one wants to fix it everyone's on vacation the police aren't
[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:50.800]  working I mean it's just it's just a joke it is a joke but unfortunately it's a
[02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:55.160]  sad joke that can spill over into the United States our job is to make sure
[02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:59.600]  that our counselor officials do not give visa that's the appropriate time and
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:03.360]  those who want to leave France and leave France the other parts of the world but
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:07.620]  I've told my family repeatedly they should leave over 30 years and they
[02:48:07.620 --> 02:48:11.920]  don't listen so that's up to them why I point of view this has been going on for
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:16.320]  well over 20 to 30 years but when you look at the cartoon Alex let me tell
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:21.160]  you in French this is really disgusting it's disgusting because it's not humorous
[02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:27.560]  it's not in any way fatirical it is nothing more than a an insult to choose
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:32.220]  to Muslims to everyone there's nothing what a slap in the face but the honest
[02:48:32.220 --> 02:48:36.840]  slap in the face you don't have to call you know it Muhammad you don't have to
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:40.440]  show him as gay you don't have to say the Quranic shit this is totally
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:44.040]  inappropriate if we were to do this with the Catholic Church that was once
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:48.920]  dominant in France believe me they would come back after you with revenge
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:52.640]  that you've never seen and the French were no sweethearts during the war
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:57.160]  remember they took out 74,000 Jews without the Germans asking them to do
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:01.200]  anything so the French have a very strong history of collaboration of
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:06.440]  surrender ineffectualness and war they've never won a war since Napoleon and
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:11.400]  Napoleon wasn't French he was Corsican so this nonsense that we see now is
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:16.160]  nothing more than a distraction which is a far greater problem all right well
[02:49:16.160 --> 02:49:20.320]  Dr. Pachinic thank you so much for the time again your e-book is available for

[02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:15.080]  all right final segment of the main broadcast I may do some internet only
[02:54:15.080 --> 02:54:18.560]  overdrive into the fourth hour I'm going to Tom and Mark and others but an
[02:54:18.560 --> 02:54:23.000]  article that was on info wars.com yesterday on the front page is still
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:26.920]  there scroll down to the bottom Middle East officials question quote
[02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:32.440]  convenient mistakes of U.S. airdrops to al-qaeda so our military refuses to
[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:36.080]  fight for al-qaeda so now they get ordered to airdrop supposedly to the
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:41.600]  Kurds and others but it's always to al-qaeda missiles hand grenades huge
[02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:46.560]  crates of machine guns United States military portrays the recent weapons
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:54.160]  and supplies by ISIS as entirely accidental and then the article by
[02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:58.520]  Brandon Tuberville from activist post goes through a bunch of links to
[02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:04.440]  mainstream news admitting it in mainstream news Arab officials that
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:09.560]  aren't for al-qaeda see how obvious it is so see you see open collusion right
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:15.440]  there it's just everywhere and doesn't mean our whole government our own
[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:19.760]  military has been saying no and blowing the whistle I've had the folks that fly
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:28.920]  the aircraft on the show and then they get subpoenaed by the Justice Department
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:34.400]  so don't say people would speak out of this was happening they are speaking out
[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:39.920]  let's go to Mark and then Tom Mark in Texas former police what's your view
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:44.720]  on this what's your gut level response or any other things you've seen well it's
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:50.280]  my good level response that this is definitely the Islamic State or ISIS
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:55.080]  whatever you want to call them and very precise and all that but actually you
[02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:59.880]  actually stole my thunder just now because I was gonna say that what's
[02:55:59.880 --> 02:56:06.120]  happening is this government okay our illustrious government is supplying
[02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:11.480]  supporting arming and even training ISIS in the name of some kind what do they
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:17.520]  call themselves a Syria the Free Syrian Army yes yeah okay and what's
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:22.280]  happening is it's kind of like let's say you have a neighbor who's an
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:26.560]  exterminator and he puts a bunch of hornets a nest of hornets in your house
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:31.120]  okay wow you know he can't control those hornets but the hornets are going to do
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:34.200]  what they normally do when they're going to start singing people and all that
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:38.000]  okay so now you're going to run over to your neighbor and you're going to get
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:41.400]  them exterminator and say okay do you please come and get rid of the hornets
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:45.480]  for me this is basically what they're doing they're letting these people loose
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:51.720]  that they're overthrowing non-Islamic nation you know like secular Arab
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:56:56.920]  nations and then they're coming into this country and into France and England and
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:01.280]  they say oh well you know what we got to sit up to TSA we got to fill you up we
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:05.480]  got to get you go go for radiation all sort of stuff we're going to have a
[02:57:05.480 --> 02:57:08.600]  police state we're going to have we're going to arm the police like no longer
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:12.960]  peace officers but more like a military force okay all that for your safety
[02:57:12.960 --> 02:57:16.840]  because we've got to protect you from the big bad ISIS and in the meantime they
[02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:20.840]  try to take away our guns one thing that keeps our America safe really is an
[02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:24.920]  armed citizenry then fortunately a lot of police a lot of police unions
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:30.000]  including the one I used to belong to believe in harming the American people
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:33.800]  and just having no harm themselves are so that's that's what it basically comes
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:41.360]  down to and like I said it's basically like you you definitely just looking at
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:45.200]  them looking to preside I know that ISIS is pretty well trained and probably
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:51.400]  from our unfortunately from our own special forces and this is what you have
[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:57.080]  and I'm sorry to say it like that but I'm unfortunately why to do it I think
[02:57:57.080 --> 02:58:00.920]  they just want control they want to take away our freedoms in this country we
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:05.920]  have a criminal class to infest major Western governments that is working with
[02:58:05.920 --> 02:58:11.040]  with one hand radical Islam as a pretext to take our freedoms it's very very
[02:58:11.040 --> 02:58:14.720]  simple and they'll have our troops go out and actually fight the jihadis they've
[02:58:14.720 --> 02:58:17.960]  helped create it it's not saying they're not real it's not saying we're on a real
[02:58:17.960 --> 02:58:23.920]  war it's just that it's on record now that it's being stirred up and given
[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:27.520]  oxygen by the establishment I'm gonna go to break come back to Tom and Michigan

[02:59:59.960 --> 03:00:17.360]  fix bayonets we are now entering over drive with your host Alex Jones
[03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:22.600]  broadcasting live from the front lines if you are receiving this transmission
[03:00:22.600 --> 03:00:29.000]  you are the resistance you know Chris Kyle's fate was sealed when his story
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.720]  started unraveling and they had to get rid of him because Clint Eastwood was
[03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:35.400]  already signing up to make a movie about it and now they are hyping the
[03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:38.280]  daylights of this film it's about to come out it's so sad people want to
[03:00:38.280 --> 03:00:43.160]  believe in this John Wayne image and a lot of it just doesn't add up so they
[03:00:43.160 --> 03:00:48.200]  they killed him so just remember that just like Pat Tillman started going
[03:00:48.200 --> 03:00:56.240]  sideways on them remember the private Lynch didn't go her team started to die
[03:00:56.240 --> 03:01:01.600]  pretty creepy Tom and Michigan former army was to give us his take on the
[03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:06.160]  pair of shooting what's it look like to you well I haven't seen an Alex but
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:10.640]  info wars rocks and wish you guys the best luck and I really like you I was
[03:01:10.640 --> 03:01:14.000]  an airborne medic in the United States Army and I worked with small units I
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:19.320]  was specifically research and teaching and you can figure it out from there well
[03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:23.400]  that's awesome I bet many the videos all over the news that you've missed it what
[03:01:23.400 --> 03:01:27.840]  do you think of the calls to restrict free speech or radical jihadis will come
[03:01:27.840 --> 03:01:33.800]  shoot us I mean I I mean obviously I'm not going to give into that well the key
[03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:37.800]  thing here is to focus on the evidence if you only have one focal point to
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:42.520]  examine what happened at the scene then you're extremely limited what you need
[03:01:42.520 --> 03:01:50.520]  to find is a army and seal that has training in Warsaw packed tactics and
[03:01:50.520 --> 03:01:54.960]  they compared from there are you saying that's what al-Qaeda basically got was
[03:01:54.960 --> 03:01:59.040]  Warsaw packed tactics I mean I know some of the Arab countries got Soviet training
[03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:06.440]  but a lot of them got Western training well we the Soviets and Americans both
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:11.800]  use Warsaw packed tactics and the Soviets also use NATO tactics so you're
[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:16.480]  gonna have to find a former NCO not a commissioner officer I understand to look
[03:02:16.480 --> 03:02:20.800]  at the tactics well I'm no tactics expert but I've followed them and their
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:25.120]  tactics look like NATO tactics to me but you there's not enough footage to be
[03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:29.280]  able to be completely clear they form one perimeter after they left their
[03:02:29.280 --> 03:02:35.440]  vehicle or two perimeters there was two vehicles correct you know I'm trying to
[03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:39.680]  collate it all but it looks like there were two vehicles yeah and the other
[03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:43.320]  thing is they had an evacuation plan they carried it out successfully correct
[03:02:43.320 --> 03:02:49.280]  yes well that's not a Muslim tactic I was about to say that's what my cousin
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:52.520]  ran in there and said at the start of the show is that usually they would just
[03:02:52.520 --> 03:02:59.560]  try to stay there and fight to the death hello so I mean like what I'm trying to
[03:02:59.560 --> 03:03:03.000]  say is I'm not gonna tell you how to figure it out over the phone but I'll
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:09.520]  find a former NCO in the US Army that was at least five years in Warsaw
[03:03:09.520 --> 03:03:13.840]  tactics fully understand is that they can find the little idiosyncrasies
[03:03:13.840 --> 03:03:18.240]  those feel where this came from it's not that difficult if you know what you're
[03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:21.280]  looking at you can because because each group trains a little bit different you
[03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:28.160]  can pick up on the body language well definitely and my heart goes out to the
[03:03:28.160 --> 03:03:33.480]  families of those that were assassinated and I wish you guys the best of luck
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:37.440]  YouTube brother you're awesome God bless you have a great new year we're
[03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:39.840]  showing that footage you know the cop getting killed even though it's blurted
[03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:45.880]  out it's disgusting to see anybody being gunned down like an animal bill real
[03:03:45.880 --> 03:03:48.880]  quick we got about a minute and a half left thanks for calling from Texas
[03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:52.600]  former military pretty interesting point that he just made I'm glad he brought
[03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:58.640]  that up that's not the al-qaeda jihadi tactics to act like this to behave like
[03:03:58.640 --> 03:04:02.520]  this and then get away and the woman said they were speaking perfect French
[03:04:02.520 --> 03:04:11.080]  that's pretty suspicious if they're from Yemen you cannot you can tell all the
[03:04:11.080 --> 03:04:15.760]  training came from for these guys don't you know that the 24th Mu out of
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:21.840]  legion in I believe 2011 through 2013 was in Jordan they admitted on their own
[03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:25.720]  page there you can pull it up while we're talking about this that they were
[03:04:25.720 --> 03:04:30.800]  training people in Jordan you wonder where the NATO training came from it
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:35.240]  came from the United States Marine Corps in Jordan for two years from the 24th
[03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:40.560]  Mu I forgot about that the Marines were in Jordan training the Free Syrian Army
[03:04:40.560 --> 03:04:44.920]  I think we'll have that on the nightly news thank you for reminding me great way
[03:04:44.920 --> 03:04:52.000]  to end it Bill anything else yeah that's where the NATO training that could be
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:56.800]  it's it's pretty pretty suspicious okay we're out of time we'll see you back
[03:04:56.800 --> 03:05:03.800]  tonight 7 o'clock Lord Wellin
