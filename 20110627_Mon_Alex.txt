[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:32.680]  well this is obviously going to be an extremely important and historical
[00:32.680 --> 00:39.480]  broadcast today on a host of fronts and issues the euro is now accelerating its
[00:39.480 --> 00:44.160]  collapse into the next phase of world government by design resistance is
[00:44.160 --> 00:49.440]  mounting at levels the globalist were not ready for and they are concerned
[00:49.440 --> 00:56.400]  about that we also of course have the International Criminal Court calling for
[00:56.400 --> 01:02.240]  the arrest and issuing an arrest warrant for Muammar Gaddafi we also have the spy
[01:02.240 --> 01:06.360]  grid of the federal government expanding headline now Obama sending out
[01:06.360 --> 01:12.280]  snoopers to pose as patients so they can check up on doctors New York Times US
[01:12.280 --> 01:16.520]  planned stealth survey on access to doctors there they're moving towards
[01:16.520 --> 01:20.080]  making doctors take Medicare and Medicaid doctors you know private practice
[01:20.080 --> 01:23.480]  can refuse to be involved with the government now they're moving to gather
[01:23.480 --> 01:27.880]  the data to try to make it law and basically nationalize the doctors
[01:27.880 --> 01:33.080]  that's where all of that is going today we're gonna be breaking that down also
[01:33.080 --> 01:39.520]  Fukushima residents now showing high levels of radiation in their urine we
[01:39.520 --> 01:43.720]  also listeners were reporting this two weeks ago to us and getting mad that we
[01:43.720 --> 01:47.000]  weren't confirming it I mean I could have gotten on an airplane and flown out
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.720]  there but it looks like what listeners have been saying has been right they
[01:49.720 --> 01:53.440]  say it was already flooded weeks ago but now seeing and others are having a
[01:53.440 --> 01:57.040]  report and there's some other reports that it looks like it may be a cover-up
[01:57.040 --> 02:00.240]  some are saying it's melted down I don't see any evidence of that
[02:00.240 --> 02:05.760]  berm protecting Fort Calhoun nuclear plant breaks plant flooded it's now an

[02:22.840 --> 02:28.400]  generators put to use at Nebraska nuclear plant we've also got very very big
[02:28.400 --> 02:33.440]  concern wildfires near Los Alamos labs that's full of all sorts of nuclear
[02:33.440 --> 02:39.000]  material and when the areas where nukes were tested get lit on fire it will put
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.200]  more radiation in the atmosphere it's like radioactive hell is being released
[02:43.200 --> 02:47.280]  they've got a big reactor obviously leaking months ago in Canada directly
[02:47.280 --> 02:52.680]  into major lake system and our media is saying it's no big deal so we'll be
[02:52.680 --> 02:59.360]  going over that today as well also a very good report boiled down at info
[02:59.360 --> 03:04.120]  wars.com from the American dream genetic modification gone wild 10 signs that our
[03:04.120 --> 03:08.520]  world may be destined to resemble a really bad science fiction movie and I
[03:08.520 --> 03:12.120]  want to go over those 10 signs just just 10 that have been the news last few days
[03:12.120 --> 03:17.120]  for you this is ongoing also Monsanto trying to take over world seed supply
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.720]  nation by nation FDA officially declares the sun unsafe though so next

[03:30.400 --> 03:35.080]  get the sunlight that then produces the vitamins inside your body you need but
[03:35.080 --> 03:39.800]  the Cass Sunstein said his regulations are it's gonna be illegal to get son he
[03:39.800 --> 03:44.280]  said and you should be arrested if you say son is good for you I'm not joking
[03:44.280 --> 03:48.680]  he also said of your 9-11 truth or war question global warming you can't make
[03:48.680 --> 03:54.560]  up this level of tyranny so that's coming up also the EPA and the courts the
[03:54.560 --> 03:58.800]  co2 question excellent article from Pittsburgh Tribune Review getting the
[03:58.800 --> 04:02.960]  fact this wasn't a victory that California called for more carbon taxes in
[04:02.960 --> 04:06.760]  the Supreme Court said no because in the ruling they say only the EPA has the
[04:06.760 --> 04:10.400]  authority and don't worry they're gonna start taxing that for you and then
[04:10.400 --> 04:14.280]  they're saying the states have no rights so very very dangerous tent amendment
[04:14.280 --> 04:20.080]  attack and of course it attacks other facets as well and more empowers the
[04:20.080 --> 04:24.080]  out-of-control environmental protection agency that is outside of Congress's
[04:24.080 --> 04:26.960]  authority Supreme Court says well they're author their authorizing their
[04:26.960 --> 04:32.480]  Congress Congress didn't pass the new carbon taxes but the EPA is implementing
[04:32.480 --> 04:38.080]  them by executive fiat so that's coming up and of course the big news the big
[04:38.080 --> 04:42.760]  news we've got joining us from Tripoli Webster Griffin Tarple he's been there

[06:09.880 --> 06:13.480]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[06:13.480 --> 06:18.480]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[06:18.480 --> 06:23.120]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[06:23.120 --> 06:27.440]  citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[06:27.440 --> 06:32.720]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[06:32.720 --> 06:37.000]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.520]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[06:40.520 --> 06:45.760]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[08:04.160 --> 08:11.960]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does
[08:11.960 --> 08:19.480]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas
[08:19.480 --> 08:22.960]  Alex Jones.
[08:27.440 --> 08:33.320]  This is going to be an incredibly important broadcast. I am begging you
[08:33.320 --> 08:38.080]  out there to think for yourselves, to check the information I'm going to give
[08:38.080 --> 08:43.360]  you and to really, really open up your mind and hear what I am about to say.
[08:43.360 --> 08:49.920]  Everything is accelerating more and more on every front, economic, spiritual,
[08:49.920 --> 08:57.960]  military, health-wise. Everything is coming to a head and then that head will
[08:57.960 --> 09:03.480]  explode and then it will lead to a greater cascade. The world is going into
[09:03.480 --> 09:09.920]  an just amazing time of flux. Corruption and those that are attracted to its
[09:09.920 --> 09:16.320]  dark light is expanding virally. Goodness at the same time throughout history
[09:16.320 --> 09:22.400]  only is roused and awakened when things get bad. And the corrupt forces, the
[09:22.400 --> 09:26.080]  social engineers have written countless white papers on how they've set up the
[09:26.080 --> 09:30.400]  final tyranny, the final revolution. They've studied how goodness, how
[09:30.400 --> 09:35.200]  wholesomeness, how those of us that love light and beauty and all that is good
[09:35.200 --> 09:41.760]  builds and then explodes against evil. Always when evil comes in, its archetypes,
[09:41.760 --> 09:49.120]  at its point of total takeover, is when good rises. And the system has
[09:49.120 --> 09:53.080]  studied this and it is cold-bloodily trying to sell death, destruction,
[09:53.080 --> 09:58.600]  ugliness, all the vampire movies, all the Lady Gaga, all the rappers now about
[09:58.600 --> 10:02.640]  serial killing and kidnapping and murdering women and children and women
[10:02.640 --> 10:08.760]  killing their husbands and we're being sold a nihilistic view so we don't tune
[10:08.760 --> 10:13.920]  into our survival instinct that directs us so that we will basically allow
[10:13.920 --> 10:20.120]  ourselves to think it's sexy to lose, sexy to fail, to think it's cool to give
[10:20.120 --> 10:25.280]  into weakness. And this can only be sold during a time of incredible decadence.
[10:25.280 --> 10:30.920]  People who are spoiled rotten from birth, have no connection to reality, are
[10:30.920 --> 10:35.600]  involved in arrested development, they basically are taught that evil and
[10:35.600 --> 10:41.320]  darkness and corruption is powerful and cool and that somehow it's fun to
[10:41.320 --> 10:47.280]  spiritually align yourself with it. That is the great crossroads we're at and
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.040]  that's why they're pumping pure death, pure destruction into us as a type of
[10:52.040 --> 10:56.320]  psychological warfare mechanism and I'll talk more about that in the third hour
[10:56.320 --> 11:01.400]  today. Joining us in T-minus 22 minutes, Webster Griffin Tarpley from Tripoli. He
[11:01.400 --> 11:04.400]  would have been on Friday, he would have been on Sunday, the phones have been out
[11:04.400 --> 11:10.280]  under intense NATO bombing. Historian and economist Webster Tarpley in Tripoli
[11:10.280 --> 11:15.160]  under bombardment if he's able to join us coming up in T-minus 21 minutes. We
[11:15.160 --> 11:18.880]  weren't supposed to talk about it until he did this first interview but he's now
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.240]  there in place and we're gonna have him on today coming up. Wayne Madson has
[11:23.240 --> 11:25.960]  also been to Tripoli, investigative journalist, former of the National
[11:25.960 --> 11:29.200]  Security Agency. He'll be joining us at the bottom of the next hour. It'll be
[11:29.200 --> 11:34.280]  open phones and news and key break nouns of other intelligence after that
[11:34.280 --> 11:40.520]  coming up in the third hour today. Now all of that said, let me just read you the
[11:40.520 --> 11:47.560]  stacks here, okay? Just the first article in each stack. US plans stealth
[11:47.560 --> 11:52.880]  survey on access to doctors ahead of nationalizing doctors, forcing you to
[11:52.880 --> 11:58.840]  serve in the national health care service. New York Times, Daily Mail, now
[11:58.840 --> 12:03.000]  Obama's sending out snoopers to pose as patients so they can check up on doctors.
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.880]  This is every industry. The preachers, the police, anybody quote infrastructure
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.840]  protection, they're giving security clearances to the TSA, they're giving it
[12:13.840 --> 12:17.840]  to bridge repair people and then they got a little petty power trips at their
[12:17.840 --> 12:22.520]  secret police and it's a total takeover. We're gonna be going over that.
[12:22.520 --> 12:28.840]  Obviously, Greece's deputy prime minister warns of tanks in the streets, mass
[12:28.840 --> 12:33.600]  suicides, if second bailout vote down by Greek parliament. Remember what we were
[12:33.600 --> 12:39.400]  told in 2008 and October? Give the banks tens of trillions. It's an open window of
[12:39.400 --> 12:43.400]  870 billion that they got over and over again. Over 27 trillion. Last time we got
[12:43.400 --> 12:47.560]  the numbers. Most of it to offshore private families and banks.
[12:47.560 --> 12:52.360]  Paulson told the closed sessions of House and Senate, you do what we say or
[12:52.360 --> 12:55.800]  there'll be martial law in blood the streets. Same things being said. This will
[12:55.800 --> 12:59.560]  be the second bailout for Greece, which is really a payment to the banks. If they
[12:59.560 --> 13:05.760]  go along with it, their future is totally doomed to third world them. By the way,
[13:05.760 --> 13:08.880]  they're getting rid of homework now in Southern California and this is by
[13:08.880 --> 13:11.760]  design because the people are so dumbed down. It's now a third world country.
[13:11.760 --> 13:15.840]  People say, well, education's failing. No, this is in the government documents that
[13:15.840 --> 13:18.800]  Charlotte is there before we had a policy department of education documented.
[13:18.800 --> 13:24.160]  It is to turn us educationally, chemically, into the servile creatures.
[13:24.160 --> 13:28.040]  Land of the free, home of the brave, the roughest, toughest, most adventurous,
[13:28.040 --> 13:36.200]  swashbuckling, trailblazing pirates, killers, madmen, sick shooters. Look what
[13:36.200 --> 13:39.320]  we've turned into, ladies and gentlemen, whether you're black or white or Native
[13:39.320 --> 13:43.280]  American, you all went through adversity and absolute endless war and hardcore
[13:43.280 --> 13:50.200]  Conan the Barbarian activity. Look at you now. What happened to us? Scientific
[13:50.200 --> 13:55.680]  dictatorship happened. Rekindle your instincts to be a wild, free human. Turn
[13:55.680 --> 13:59.520]  on your instincts. Turn on the life force, ladies and gentlemen. It's
[13:59.520 --> 14:04.880]  unstoppable and you'll truly be alive. You can only see what I've seen. If you
[14:04.880 --> 14:09.280]  can only commit to history, you'd realize why you're so weak, why you feel
[14:09.280 --> 14:13.800]  so powerless, why you behave like jellyfish. It's because you don't have a
[14:13.800 --> 14:20.600]  fire in your soul. Only liberty, only the spirit of 1776, the animating spirit of
[14:20.600 --> 14:25.440]  liberty that God can breathe into men and women will quench your thirst. Sorry.
[14:25.440 --> 14:31.080]  Sorry. I'm sorry. Let me continue. It's all coming down, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:31.080 --> 14:34.640]  Meanwhile, they're threatening the same thing here in the United States saying
[14:34.640 --> 14:43.920]  we'll lose our debt rating if we don't give the bankers even more money. Threat
[14:43.920 --> 14:50.400]  of 100 billion hit of US top rating loss, financial times of London. It's all
[14:50.400 --> 14:54.760]  happening right now. We're going to break this down. As the economic
[14:54.760 --> 15:00.800]  dictatorship, the banker occupation rolls on. We've got incredible nuclear
[15:00.800 --> 15:05.920]  reactor news in the United States. Turns out that the facility has been flooded.
[15:05.920 --> 15:11.600]  The power is off. They're on diesel generators at Fort Calhoun. Our listeners
[15:11.600 --> 15:14.200]  said this was happening weeks ago from people they knew in the plant. We were
[15:14.200 --> 15:16.560]  flooded with calls, but I couldn't confirm it. I guess I could get on an
[15:16.560 --> 15:19.880]  airplane, but those facilities have got guys with guns guarding them. How am I
[15:19.880 --> 15:24.080]  going to find out? Again, under national security, they hide what's really going on
[15:24.080 --> 15:28.880]  here. Los Alamos is on fire. Very, very big concern. Wildfire near Los Alamos
[15:28.880 --> 15:33.320]  Lab. It's already on the nuclear testing areas, so it's reigniting all that stuff
[15:33.320 --> 15:40.280]  and getting into the atmosphere. That's MSNBC. It is all coming up. But first,
[15:40.280 --> 15:45.240]  before I get into the incredible treachery, the off-the-charts betrayal,
[15:45.240 --> 15:50.480]  duplicity that I have never even seen from Bill Clinton or Al Gore, who were
[15:50.480 --> 15:56.280]  masters of duplicity and deception, of slickness, of sliminess, Rick Perry and
[15:56.280 --> 16:03.120]  the speaker of the Texas House and the leader of the Senate, Dewhurst, they make
[16:03.120 --> 16:11.960]  Clinton and Obama and Bush look like pikers, look like addled idiots. Okay,
[16:11.960 --> 16:17.400]  this information, and yes, we're going to have a citizen filibuster today,
[16:17.400 --> 16:21.040]  tomorrow, and Wednesday. We're going to make sure we're going to go talk to our
[16:21.040 --> 16:24.400]  representatives. I'm going to tell you what a citizen filibuster is. I'm inventing
[16:24.400 --> 16:30.440]  it today. I invented it this morning out of anger at 7 a.m. talking to Paul
[16:30.440 --> 16:33.760]  Watson and reading over the legislation. I'm going to break it all down for you.
[16:33.760 --> 16:38.160]  But starting at 4 o'clock today at that Capitol, in fact, start now. Get over
[16:38.160 --> 16:42.160]  there now. I'm going to explain what a citizen filibuster is. I'm inventing it
[16:42.160 --> 16:47.800]  here. Only you can breathe life into it. Only you can animate it. Will you animate
[16:47.800 --> 16:51.120]  it? Will you step forward into history? Before I do that, I want to play a clip
[16:51.120 --> 16:55.440]  from Bugs Life we played from time to time about why the feds are so upset,
[16:55.440 --> 16:58.800]  why they're twisting arms, and why they've engaged in extremely dirty tricks to
[16:58.800 --> 17:03.320]  get this. Because if Texas stands up and people, the feds can only have victory
[17:03.320 --> 17:07.720]  after victory. If they ever have a defeat at the state level, it's starting
[17:07.720 --> 17:12.120]  to happen all over the country in different ways, the idea that we can use
[17:12.120 --> 17:16.760]  the Constitution to overthrow their tyranny will get purchased. It will get
[17:16.760 --> 17:24.240]  a foothold and their time is over. So this is very exciting that we pushed
[17:24.240 --> 17:27.600]  them into a second session and that we're going to push them into a third.
[17:27.600 --> 17:32.960]  First pray that the regular session, second session, and then a second
[17:32.960 --> 17:37.200]  special session, a third session, it ends Wednesday. We need to get in there, tell
[17:37.200 --> 17:40.800]  the state reps, tell the senators, look, just don't show up for votes, talk to
[17:40.800 --> 17:45.280]  others, kill all the legislation, and explain to them you're not going to get
[17:45.280 --> 17:48.760]  all your other garbage through until you do this. And I'm going to explain
[17:48.760 --> 17:53.280]  Perry's duplicity in a moment and what's happened. They've killed the bill. This is
[17:53.280 --> 17:58.240]  they killed it on Friday, they've officially put nails in it today. Okay,
[17:58.240 --> 18:01.600]  and I'm going down there at four o'clock today, but you could start going now, and
[18:01.600 --> 18:04.240]  I'm going to break it all down. But first, here's a bug's life as we go out to
[18:04.240 --> 18:09.880]  break. There was that ant that stood up to me. Yeah, but we can forget about him.
[18:09.880 --> 18:18.880]  Yeah, it was just one ant. Ooh, one ant. You're right. It's just one ant. Yeah,
[18:18.880 --> 18:27.880]  boys, they're puny. Puny? Say, let's pretend this brain is a puny little ant.
[18:27.880 --> 18:43.880]  Didn't that hurt? Nope. Well, how about this one? Are you kidding? Well, how about this?
[18:43.880 --> 18:50.680]  Dump's a giant container of grade on him. Instead of one, it's hundreds. You let one
[18:50.680 --> 18:58.960]  ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up. Those puny little ants outnumber
[18:58.960 --> 19:04.680]  us a hundred to one. And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of
[19:04.680 --> 19:11.960]  life. It's not about food. It's about keeping those ants in line. That's why
[19:11.960 --> 19:20.520]  we're going back. Does anybody else want to stay? And they all turn their wings
[19:20.520 --> 19:27.640]  on and fly out to go oppress the ants. Now, we're at the crossroads. If they can
[19:27.640 --> 19:33.160]  make 95 year old women going home to die with their family, take a diaper off and
[19:33.160 --> 19:37.320]  stand for 45 minutes while they strip search them. If they can grow up little
[19:37.320 --> 19:43.080]  girls and if they can microwave you in the porno scanners, if they can make you
[19:43.080 --> 19:46.880]  walk through the athlete's foot laden, use dirty gloves on you, they can do
[19:46.880 --> 19:50.960]  anything. Like go to school proms as they're now announcing. This is the
[19:50.960 --> 19:54.680]  federal power grab. This is the 10th and 9th Amendment fight. This is what our
[19:54.680 --> 19:59.440]  ancestors fought. We'll be right back with the treachery, with the treason. We'll
[19:59.440 --> 20:03.560]  want to stay with us. The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[20:03.560 --> 20:07.400]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet and
[20:07.400 --> 20:10.840]  even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal
[20:10.840 --> 20:14.760]  progress. What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals,
[20:14.760 --> 20:19.600]  chemicals and drugs? It is glutathione. Glutathione is the master any oxidant

[21:39.720 --> 21:43.080]  Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a
[21:43.080 --> 21:46.240]  greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi Ted

[24:04.720 --> 24:11.160]  Okay what's happened is with the states rights battle the fourth amendment
[24:11.160 --> 24:19.240]  battle the dignity battle where strangers with no due process no proof of a
[24:19.240 --> 24:23.000]  crime grab your genitals and actually squeeze them to find out what they are
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.520]  this is found this has happened to miss USA it's happened to state reps in Texas
[24:27.520 --> 24:32.160]  it's happened to Ron Paul Jesse Ventura the list goes on and on I've watched it
[24:32.160 --> 24:36.880]  happen to children the naked body scanners the lies about radiation all
[24:36.880 --> 24:41.320]  of it this is about a federal power grab and what's happened is a long train of
[24:41.320 --> 24:46.000]  deception Rick Perry said he supported it then when they pass unanimously in the
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.120]  house and they had a near unanimous one vote against in the Senate David Dew
[24:50.120 --> 24:53.040]  Hurst went in there and killed it they didn't let it come to the floor and it
[24:53.040 --> 24:56.160]  came out that he'd done that and Senator Patrick and others are very prominent
[24:56.160 --> 25:00.320]  came out and said they witnessed it then they did what Perry always does act
[25:00.320 --> 25:03.880]  like you're for something but then kill it remember this is Al Gore's former
[25:03.880 --> 25:07.040]  chief of staff this is a guy that tried to force girls to take force in
[25:07.040 --> 25:10.360]  occupations of a deadly vaccine they knew was killing people in the trials this
[25:10.360 --> 25:15.240]  is the guy that got a ward in 2005 from Vicente Fox for setting up sanctuary
[25:15.240 --> 25:21.240]  cities and giving free in-state true tuition to illegals look it up we've
[25:21.240 --> 25:24.960]  written articles with links to mainstream news this guy is like Bill
[25:24.960 --> 25:31.000]  Clinton on steroids but he talks about being conservative and so they killed
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.560]  it then Perry wouldn't put it on the legislative session the special session
[25:34.560 --> 25:38.560]  he waited till a couple weeks of it was over then he lied on record and said
[25:38.560 --> 25:41.840]  well it's too late to put it on when he could put it on he's one that can do it
[25:41.840 --> 25:44.440]  and then he said there's not enough time and they said well you're the one that
[25:44.440 --> 25:49.000]  can put it on you can call for another session if you want and so he did and
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.760]  last Monday then they said wait till Friday we'll vote on it then the Senate
[25:52.760 --> 25:56.760]  didn't show up the Speaker of the House who'd voted for the bill when it was
[25:56.760 --> 26:01.440]  voted for unanimously came out and said it's a stunt it does nothing when the
[26:01.440 --> 26:05.280]  Attorney General had even been involved writing it and it clearly said it's
[26:05.280 --> 26:08.880]  official oppression for a police officer state police it's already on the books
[26:08.880 --> 26:13.720]  anybody to come up and grab your genitals without a warrant or due process
[26:13.720 --> 26:17.480]  you know if a cop sees you shove a gun in your pants I think you're about to do
[26:17.480 --> 26:20.120]  something then they could tackle you and try to get it out of your pants but
[26:20.120 --> 26:23.320]  you don't just line people up and do this it's the end of innocent until
[26:23.320 --> 26:28.240]  proven guilty and so all of that happened and the whole country's watching
[26:28.240 --> 26:33.600]  this and so now suddenly first they kill it the Senate for politics then they
[26:33.600 --> 26:36.880]  pat okay now it's your turn to take a political hit they tell the Speaker of
[26:36.880 --> 26:43.440]  the House he comes out and says it's dead now this is one of the chief authors
[26:43.440 --> 26:48.440]  of the bill this is representative David Simpson we've interviewed many times
[26:48.440 --> 26:53.960]  this is TSA tyranny their website not all the dis info okay TSA tyranny
[26:53.960 --> 26:59.000]  withdraws support from House version of TSA anti-groping bill HP 41 they blocked
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.240]  it last week now they've gutted it as basically just a resolution with no teeth
[27:05.240 --> 27:09.200]  where it won't do anything now we've got today to try to get them to rescramble
[27:09.200 --> 27:14.000]  it and bring back the old bill but the point is we don't need to have little
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.320]  permitted you know demonstrations out front that are ignored with cops bugging
[27:18.320 --> 27:22.840]  their eyes out as we need to go in and talk to our representatives our
[27:22.840 --> 27:30.000]  servants with what I'm dubbing a citizen fellow buster and I'm inventing this now
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.120]  what you do is you go in legally and lawfully go in any entrance you want
[27:34.120 --> 27:38.120]  four o'clock today I say start getting there now and you go in to the Speaker
[27:38.120 --> 27:41.840]  of the House the governor's office you go into the Lieutenant governor's office
[27:41.840 --> 27:44.960]  the culprits and you let them know that you're upset with what's happening but
[27:44.960 --> 27:50.360]  more importantly you then go and tell your servants in a focused serious but
[27:50.360 --> 27:54.840]  polite way look at them in the eye you then go to your House members you then
[27:54.840 --> 27:59.880]  go to Senate members and you go in and you say I am going I want on record where
[27:59.880 --> 28:07.560]  you are don't try to duck this you need to talk to to say that you're not going
[28:07.560 --> 28:10.960]  to show up for votes and you're gonna get others to stand down like it did last
[28:10.960 --> 28:15.040]  Friday to kill the bill they tentatively killed it then pretty much
[28:15.040 --> 28:19.920]  officially today or did David Simpson others I agree with their analysis so
[28:19.920 --> 28:22.440]  there's a lot of people that just want to get a fake resolution to declare
[28:22.440 --> 28:27.000]  victory that's the we're not here to be given fake things we want the real deal
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.440]  and we want the federal state constitutional challenge we want the
[28:31.440 --> 28:35.400]  constitutional crisis just like we want the House and Senate to stand up to
[28:35.400 --> 28:38.920]  Obama for not even getting authorization for them for the war and
[28:38.920 --> 28:44.040]  saying he doesn't need authorization because he has the UN big things are
[28:44.040 --> 28:51.160]  happening right now and and and history is unfolding right now and I need
[28:51.160 --> 28:57.360]  everybody all over Texas to get in your cars now I'll be there at four and I'll
[28:57.360 --> 29:02.480]  come in there at the South entrance you know the one where Congress comes right
[29:02.480 --> 29:06.760]  up four o'clock right-eyed bushy tailed I'm gonna be there and I'm going into
[29:06.760 --> 29:12.120]  that capital and I'm gonna go in to the different House and Senate offices and
[29:12.120 --> 29:17.120]  I'm gonna bring my citizen filibuster to them and say look hold up all the other
[29:17.120 --> 29:20.200]  legislation that's what the House and Senate members should do those of you
[29:20.200 --> 29:23.720]  that have filibuster power going in filibuster the entire session that's
[29:23.720 --> 29:28.880]  what you're supposed to do in a crisis like this and so we can block all the
[29:28.880 --> 29:32.680]  other bills they're trying to pass most of them you know globalist power grabs
[29:32.680 --> 29:38.240]  to force a whole nother special session to force Perry out in the open again to
[29:38.240 --> 29:42.320]  put it back on that legislative session to continue keeping this issue front
[29:42.320 --> 29:47.160]  center who wins the fight against tyranny is who wants it most you got to

[32:13.600 --> 32:17.800]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[32:17.800 --> 32:22.280]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[32:22.280 --> 32:27.000]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.800]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[32:30.800 --> 32:34.440]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[32:34.440 --> 32:38.760]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[32:38.760 --> 32:41.920]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[32:41.920 --> 32:45.560]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[32:45.560 --> 32:50.360]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[32:50.360 --> 32:54.600]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[32:54.600 --> 33:18.520]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[33:18.520 --> 33:23.040]  yeah I want to say Don Kershain I love you I appreciate you all the listeners
[33:23.040 --> 33:27.080]  out there or the incredible job you've been doing spreading the word about
[33:27.080 --> 33:30.480]  liberty and freedom the actions you've been taking none of us are going to save
[33:30.480 --> 33:36.840]  the world by ourselves but incrementally by reaching out to others
[33:36.840 --> 33:45.520]  incrementally by continuing to to resist corruption you basically expose it you
[33:45.520 --> 33:49.880]  basically are able to then call it out we're gonna be talking to Webster Griffin
[33:49.880 --> 33:55.240]  Tarpley doctor of history and also an economist who bravely traveled to
[33:55.240 --> 33:58.840]  Tripoli we knew about this last week but weren't able to announce it until now
[33:58.840 --> 34:02.920]  he would have been on Sunday but the bombardments have knocked out the
[34:02.920 --> 34:07.920]  telephones now we have the International Criminal Court which is a total
[34:07.920 --> 34:12.120]  kangaroo court on record which is completely phony that usually they
[34:12.120 --> 34:17.640]  kill you in custody like Slavoj Milošević because you know they don't
[34:17.640 --> 34:22.880]  want all the real evidence coming out but they are calling for his arrest now
[34:22.880 --> 34:27.320]  and there's a bunch of generals over the weekend testifying to Congress it's
[34:27.320 --> 34:30.720]  now come out in closed session that they do want ground invasion as we told you
[34:30.720 --> 34:39.920]  a few weeks ago so that is coming up now continuing here Texans to launch
[34:39.920 --> 34:48.680]  Texans to launch citizen filibuster over TSA groping campaign seeks to pressure
[34:48.680 --> 34:52.160]  public servants into following will the people this just went live at
[34:52.160 --> 34:56.160]  prisonplanet.com please get this article out to everyone you know Twitter
[34:56.160 --> 35:00.800]  everyone call friends call the local radio tell everybody citizens are going
[35:00.800 --> 35:04.760]  to be in the capital today tomorrow and Wednesday in the last days of the
[35:04.760 --> 35:10.720]  session and the tactic is go in and ask your state reps to filibuster and to
[35:10.720 --> 35:14.360]  block all the other legislation so they're forced to either do the right
[35:14.360 --> 35:17.760]  thing we've already had a unanimous vote in the house and ban the TSA
[35:17.760 --> 35:23.200]  engaging in criminal activity or just enforce the existing law and at the
[35:23.200 --> 35:30.440]  same time get those state reps and Senate members to let the the Lieutenant
[35:30.440 --> 35:34.880]  Governor the Speaker of the House and the Governor know that if they don't fall
[35:34.880 --> 35:38.600]  the will the people the law and the unanimous house and then in the near
[35:38.600 --> 35:43.120]  unanimous Senate if they continue to to to violate House and Senate rules and
[35:43.120 --> 35:48.200]  and and had the leadership kill the bill they've now got a watered-down version
[35:48.200 --> 35:52.120]  and David Simpson is saying he's withdrawn his support it's just a
[35:52.120 --> 35:58.080]  glorified resolution so we need to go in there and be there today tonight
[35:58.080 --> 36:04.280]  tomorrow and the next day and basically chant and chant outside the doors of the
[36:04.280 --> 36:08.720]  house and Senate to the point that they get the message and understand either
[36:08.720 --> 36:14.280]  pass the bill because you've already voted for it before and in force the law
[36:14.280 --> 36:18.960]  or we're gonna force this thing into another special session and that's the
[36:18.960 --> 36:23.200]  last thing Rick Perry wants right now Rick Perry does not want that because he
[36:23.200 --> 36:26.240]  has to wait till the sessions over because he's pledged to do it before he
[36:26.240 --> 36:29.640]  announces to run for president so believe me this has got him really really
[36:29.640 --> 36:33.000]  concerned I'm going down there at four o'clock I don't particularly want to go
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.760]  down there but it's my duty I'm gonna be down there for a few hours you can show
[36:36.760 --> 36:40.320]  up at four six ten whatever you can they'll be going to midnight the next
[36:40.320 --> 36:44.440]  few days get there early in the morning get there in the afternoon tomorrow but
[36:44.440 --> 36:49.000]  the big time to show up is today at four o'clock so the next three days we need
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.960]  citizens of Texas and people that love freedom be crawling all over that
[36:53.960 --> 36:58.600]  capital it's our house and if we don't use it we'll lose it so more coming up
[36:58.600 --> 37:02.640]  the next hour Texan to launch citizen fellow buster over TSA groping I
[37:02.640 --> 37:07.400]  explained what this tactic is at info wars.com and prism planet.com other big
[37:07.400 --> 37:13.200]  article new document proves TSA mischaracterized safety aspects of full
[37:13.200 --> 37:19.000]  body scanners big breaking news at prism planet.com and info wars.com but
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.160]  again a TSA tyranny David Simpson site withdraw support for house version of
[37:24.160 --> 37:28.120]  TSA anti groping bill HP 41 that's coming up for a vote in the next few
[37:28.120 --> 37:32.320]  hours because it is a gutted whitewash and they break it down that's also an
[37:32.320 --> 37:38.600]  info wars.com and prism planet.com now going to Tripoli Webster Griffin
[37:38.600 --> 37:43.320]  Tarpley is our guest the author of the unauthorized biography of George
[37:43.320 --> 37:47.640]  Herbert Walker Bush and Barack Obama a doctor of history and an economist
[37:47.640 --> 37:52.040]  Tarpley you let us know the day before you were leaving last week but that we
[37:52.040 --> 37:55.200]  couldn't talk about it till you got into the country understand why you've got a
[37:55.200 --> 37:58.520]  lot of courage my friend you're well-traveled why are you there what
[37:58.520 --> 38:03.760]  are you witnessing in Tripoli as the globalist admit top general admits to
[38:03.760 --> 38:09.480]  Congress they're preparing for ground war. Well I'm sort of on a fact-finding
[38:09.480 --> 38:15.320]  mission Alex thank you for having me on the idea here is to come here and see
[38:15.320 --> 38:19.160]  what is actually happening and there have been a number of people coming
[38:19.160 --> 38:23.880]  through here you've probably seen Cynthia McKinney might have seen Wayne Madsen
[38:23.880 --> 38:28.480]  number of academics from the United States people from other parts of the
[38:28.480 --> 38:35.560]  world have been invited so there's a kind of a modest flow of people coming in
[38:35.560 --> 38:42.040]  to do a potentially a fact-finding mission and I think it's these are
[38:42.040 --> 38:47.080]  things that people are to be aware of this is a very very extreme case of
[38:47.080 --> 38:51.480]  imperialism like what you might call the New World Order this this is the in many
[38:51.480 --> 38:55.840]  ways the leading edge of it and I would just like to share some impressions
[38:55.840 --> 38:59.480]  first of all that what happens when you when you get here you you can't come in
[38:59.480 --> 39:02.920]  the normal way through an airplane or even through a boat you could come from
[39:02.920 --> 39:08.080]  Italy by boat but they won't let you let you do that they have a no-fly zone so
[39:08.080 --> 39:13.440]  there's no commercial aircraft traffic and even the Libyan fishing boats along
[39:13.440 --> 39:19.480]  the Mediterranean coast are now being shot at by predator drones of the United
[39:19.480 --> 39:24.240]  States as they go out and try to try to provide some some fish for people's
[39:24.240 --> 39:29.080]  dinner tables and the food here is it's excellent but it's very heavily based
[39:29.080 --> 39:33.640]  on on fish so what happens is you cut you drive in essentially a drive across the
[39:33.640 --> 39:40.040]  the Tunisian border usually and the first thing you see is there are these
[39:40.040 --> 39:46.920]  checkpoints every five to ten kilometers I think probably we went by maybe 40 or
[39:46.920 --> 39:51.480]  maybe even 50 of these checkpoints then you're driving through the North
[39:51.480 --> 39:56.200]  African desert right through the Libyan Maghreb Desert in the night the roads
[39:56.200 --> 40:02.280]  are filled with heavy trucks because there is commerce going on these these
[40:02.280 --> 40:06.920]  sanctions are not as as watertight as people think and you come to these
[40:06.920 --> 40:12.680]  checkpoints and this is partly the Libyan army but they're also supplemented by
[40:12.680 --> 40:17.680]  volunteers and many of them are women volunteers and quite a lot of them are
[40:17.680 --> 40:25.200]  black women volunteers and what you could see is Gaddafi has a very serious
[40:25.200 --> 40:29.960]  space of support or maybe it's more accurate to say the Libyan government
[40:29.960 --> 40:33.880]  he's now handed out two million machine guns grenade launchers hand grenades
[40:33.880 --> 40:38.600]  and and when the US NATO force rolls in there in October it is going to be an
[40:38.600 --> 40:43.120]  absolute bloodbath I think that's that's very important Alex this is
[40:43.120 --> 40:47.520]  something that they've told us about they've essentially given one to two
[40:47.520 --> 40:54.400]  million Kalashnikov storm these assault rifles as you mentioned and that's
[40:54.400 --> 40:58.840]  people's war and if you really are a dictator this is something you cannot
[40:58.840 --> 41:04.600]  do if Gaddafi had been in reality what the US propaganda says he is well as
[41:04.600 --> 41:08.200]  soon as everybody got those Kalashnikovs that would have been the end of the
[41:08.200 --> 41:12.680]  current government and instead they now admit Amnesty admits the State
[41:12.680 --> 41:16.600]  Department no rape gangs with Viagra they admit the baby incubator story was
[41:16.600 --> 41:21.040]  fake it's the same group doing that they admit he didn't run to Venezuela all
[41:21.040 --> 41:25.000]  those times that was that he stabilized and they now admit the top admirals
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.120]  come out admitted yes we're trying to kill Gaddafi well obviously when they're
[41:28.120 --> 41:30.880]  blowing up all of his houses and government buildings every time he's
[41:30.880 --> 41:34.040]  in them obviously they're trying to do that it you know they tell us it's not a
[41:34.040 --> 41:39.720]  war it is a war and and I meant to give the reports yesterday I mentioned it but
[41:39.720 --> 41:43.880]  even Reuters and AP are admitting that Congress has been told yes the ground
[41:43.880 --> 41:47.280]  forces are ready and are going to be needed the troops have told us this for
[41:47.280 --> 41:51.920]  late September early October this is absolutely insane but but please
[41:51.920 --> 41:58.400]  continue from Libya telling us what you're saying well just in terms of this people's war I
[41:58.400 --> 42:04.240]  I would I would warn everybody that the US or NATO or anybody's invasion of
[42:04.240 --> 42:09.200]  Libya it's going to be an active and calculable folly and this is it is
[42:09.200 --> 42:13.760]  simply a gratuitous bloodbath it's gonna make black Hawk down look like a
[42:13.760 --> 42:19.240]  picnic a picnic and even with all of the bombing that has gone on for so so far
[42:19.240 --> 42:25.360]  what I'm amazed at is the the the plastic attitude of the of the Libyan
[42:25.360 --> 42:28.680]  people like normally you think that a foreigner right of a country that's
[42:28.680 --> 42:33.280]  bombing Libya that you'd be lynched to you'd be in danger and nothing could be
[42:33.280 --> 42:37.080]  farther from the truth there's still a tremendous interest in people coming
[42:37.080 --> 42:40.680]  from abroad and if they're grateful to have you to have you here but now an
[42:40.680 --> 42:45.160]  invasion is going to be very different I talking to an ambassador a
[42:45.160 --> 42:50.920]  distinguished older man extremely cultured perfect American perfect
[42:50.920 --> 42:57.240]  French you know knows the ways of the world and he said well if the if the
[42:57.240 --> 43:02.040]  invasion comes he said we in my household with my wife and my kids an
[43:02.040 --> 43:06.600]  extended family we did a kind of the census right what we could do
[43:06.600 --> 43:12.360]  militarily and he said well we figured we had enough RPGs to knock out about four
[43:12.360 --> 43:19.480]  tanks and enough ammunition and Kalashnikovs to to take care of I don't
[43:19.480 --> 43:24.440]  know what a couple of platoons and that's just one family and remember the
[43:24.440 --> 43:28.680]  the Libyan population is six million and it breaks down about one million are
[43:28.680 --> 43:33.000]  under this rebel council under this this gang of terrorists because they're
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.760]  under the Al Qaeda Al Qaeda commander that's it's what it is and and these
[43:37.760 --> 43:41.640]  the the rest of the five the other five million are loyal to the government and
[43:41.640 --> 43:46.360]  and to the to the institutions that have been really successful here in raising
[43:46.360 --> 43:50.280]  the standard of living from one of the lowest right rock bottom in Africa
[43:50.280 --> 43:53.960]  notice Al Qaeda used against the Russians Al Qaeda used against the Serbs
[43:53.960 --> 43:58.840]  Al Qaeda used against the Iranian Shiites now they're putting an Al Qaeda back
[43:58.840 --> 44:03.000]  Muslim Brotherhood people in Egypt I mean don't folks get it and we're all
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.600]  a lucky hanging out the Pentagon Mutala the underwear bomber gotten on the
[44:06.600 --> 44:11.160]  plane by the government Al Qaeda is a secret army of the private banking
[44:11.160 --> 44:15.680]  cartel right it certainly is and but but in terms of what what happens with
[44:15.680 --> 44:21.120]  Libya the other thing about it is it is a tribal society and as people talk
[44:21.120 --> 44:24.720]  about it right they say everyone is a member of one or the other of the tribes
[44:24.720 --> 44:29.560]  now what that means though is that even if the government is the type of
[44:29.560 --> 44:33.160]  decapitated or these other things they're trying to do that will not solve
[44:33.160 --> 44:39.280]  the problem for NATO because there is a ready-made combat organization which is
[44:39.280 --> 44:44.560]  available in the form of the tribes and there is no way around this no matter
[44:44.560 --> 44:49.520]  what you do as long as anybody lives here at all and you can't buy them all
[44:49.520 --> 44:54.600]  and you can't buy them all off no you can't because there's a very strong
[44:54.600 --> 44:59.400]  sense of nationalism there's a devotion to having a united country so I would
[44:59.400 --> 45:04.360]  simply urge people if you look at that boat in the House of Representatives last
[45:04.360 --> 45:11.800]  week it was 238 to 180 in concerning cutting off the money and it means that
[45:11.800 --> 45:19.240]  it lost 238 voted for war 180 voted for for no money and no war now that simply
[45:19.240 --> 45:25.000]  means if you could shift 30 votes from the war column into the peace column you
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.600]  would cut off the the funding and I think that's worth a worth a real try
[45:28.600 --> 45:33.800]  number one if people are from the Tea Party or Republicans or conservative
[45:33.800 --> 45:39.480]  Democrats they've got to realize this is al-Qaeda the people that run Benghazi
[45:39.480 --> 45:44.560]  and Dharna and to book those are terrorists those are veterans of Iraq
[45:44.560 --> 45:48.920]  and Afghanistan the leader admits he killed Americans in Iraq and we're
[45:48.920 --> 45:54.520]  unpatriotic as we don't support al-Qaeda Webster there we go and the other one
[45:54.520 --> 45:59.400]  though is the the massacre the atrocities against black Africans people
[45:59.400 --> 46:05.880]  from Mali or Somalia or Chad under the under the rebel regime that ought to be
[46:05.880 --> 46:10.640]  enough to move the entire black caucus out of the war war column and into the
[46:10.640 --> 46:14.800]  peace column if they're not there already and then there's this this great
[46:14.800 --> 46:20.520]  man-made river and the fact that when they talk about revolution everybody in
[46:20.520 --> 46:24.680]  this country will say Gaddafi and his government that's the revolution of it
[46:24.680 --> 46:29.960]  that's the anti-colonial anti-imperialist revolution that actually
[46:29.960 --> 46:35.360]  means something where these people in Benghazi those are monarchists those are
[46:35.360 --> 46:42.040]  religious obscurantists they're the Muslim brotherhood and al-Qaeda well
[46:42.040 --> 46:47.440]  they openly want the old British monarchy a back monarchy group put
[46:47.440 --> 46:54.080]  back in yes and in fact that's that's what they would do so I think the
[46:54.080 --> 46:57.880]  militarily the stuff you hear about about the progress of the rebels this is
[46:57.880 --> 47:01.280]  simply nonsense but I want to go back to those checkpoints in the night because
[47:01.280 --> 47:05.000]  I want people to understand if you want to know where the front line of the
[47:05.000 --> 47:11.320]  fight of civilization is it's those Libyan soldiers volunteers women many of
[47:11.320 --> 47:16.160]  them standing out there in the night knowing the only hope of those rebels
[47:16.160 --> 47:21.200]  is to get terrorists into the city of Tripoli and they're gonna have to get
[47:21.200 --> 47:24.920]  them through those checkpoints and they're not gonna do very well because
[47:24.920 --> 47:28.720]  they're getting there's a checkpoint every five or ten kilometers and we were
[47:28.720 --> 47:32.840]  lucky that we got to go by because we had we had you know a little bit of
[47:32.840 --> 47:38.080]  extra you know getting getting through some of these some of these checkpoints
[47:38.080 --> 47:42.400]  but the from for a lot of people it's it's a laborious process but they're
[47:42.400 --> 47:47.040]  willing to do it and again the support it seems to me is is virtually
[47:47.040 --> 47:51.840]  seamless and nobody here is gonna let NATO come in and nobody here is gonna
[47:51.840 --> 47:56.560]  let those those Benghazi tribes come in a lot of those people in Benghazi turn
[47:56.560 --> 48:01.480]  out actually to be foreigners they're from from Afghanistan or Pakistan or
[48:01.480 --> 48:06.640]  wherever they're from they're from Egypt some of them it's same old al-Qaeda
[48:06.640 --> 48:12.360]  al-siaida now now Webster their only hope then is to kill Qaddafi Qaddafi knows
[48:12.360 --> 48:16.440]  that he's committed to stay and I'm not saying he's an angel but compared to
[48:16.440 --> 48:22.120]  al-Qaeda I mean I'll I'll pick you know that I think we'll take it yeah I'm
[48:22.120 --> 48:25.200]  sorry I'm not for al-Qaeda folks I know that makes me an American I mean we're
[48:25.200 --> 48:28.760]  true real history you know our government created al-Qaeda and I'm against it so I'm
[48:28.760 --> 48:34.840]  anti-government but now now Webster their only hope is to kill Qaddafi and in
[48:34.840 --> 48:38.440]  it's on I mean it's now in the news that they're telling Congress behind closed
[48:38.440 --> 48:41.560]  doors it's come out in major newspapers that yeah the invasion is on
[48:41.560 --> 48:45.360]  September October they're gonna call it a peace mission that's also in the news
[48:45.360 --> 48:50.440]  rolling the tanks in I mean and and and whether this was a good war or not he
[48:50.440 --> 48:54.680]  didn't even go to Congress at least Bush did that this is high treason and
[48:54.680 --> 49:00.160]  even Nadler you know the obese gun grabber up in New York has said Obama is
[49:00.160 --> 49:05.600]  becoming a king an emperor this is unacceptable so this is anybody who
[49:05.600 --> 49:10.400]  believes in rule of law has got to be against this new war let me just comment
[49:10.400 --> 49:16.280]  on these attempts to kill Qaddafi because I've visited now Qaddafi's
[49:16.280 --> 49:21.680]  compound his villa I guess you'd say bombed out what what NATO seems to be
[49:21.680 --> 49:28.000]  using is these are these are kind of a projectile that divides into eight parts
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.080]  it seems to be it breaks up into a cluster bomb you will yeah but it's
[49:33.080 --> 49:37.800]  something more than a cluster bomb because it's more heavy-duty and so it
[49:37.800 --> 49:42.320]  just it's suitable to destroy you know something about the size of a football
[49:42.320 --> 49:46.800]  field but it destroys heavy buildings I mean it's not just a shrapnel
[49:46.800 --> 49:52.240]  fragmentation device so I've been in in Qaddafi's villa now a couple of things
[49:52.240 --> 49:57.880]  about this you go into the room where Qaddafi would receive the visits of
[49:57.880 --> 50:03.080]  the African leaders government said as of state another you know diplomatic
[50:03.080 --> 50:10.120]  events of state and you look at this this is not the palace of I don't know
[50:10.120 --> 50:16.040]  who this it looks like the the rec room of a you know a comfortable upper
[50:16.040 --> 50:21.800]  middle-class family but there's nothing you know bombastic about this there's
[50:21.800 --> 50:27.600]  nothing super luxurious I mean there's no the point is he lives in a tent web so
[50:27.600 --> 50:32.040]  we got to go to break time absolutely I want to come back here the point is he
[50:32.040 --> 50:36.120]  they say oh look he's got all this money a sitting on gold knowing that when he
[50:36.120 --> 50:40.600]  got invaded he would be able to pay for things ladies and gentlemen a totally
[50:40.600 --> 50:46.120]  illegal UN war backed by Al Qaeda started by the West four months ago a month
[50:46.120 --> 50:51.680]  before the UN ridiculous resolution now the International Court of Criminals
[50:51.680 --> 50:55.240]  they are the criminals is seeing a res Qaddafi and they're telling you this

[54:12.640 --> 54:16.200]  Webster Tarpe a little bit of the next hour with us this is his first interview
[54:16.200 --> 54:21.680]  from Tripoli he's been there for several days left late last week Webster
[54:21.680 --> 54:25.600]  you've got the floor continue to break down what you're witnessing and what
[54:25.600 --> 54:29.560]  does it signify they have international criminal court other people they grab
[54:29.560 --> 54:34.040]  like Milajevic it's on record they poison so you don't ever go to trial there
[54:34.040 --> 54:38.080]  it's total kangaroo you can't call witnesses this is the private court of
[54:38.080 --> 54:41.560]  the private bankers and they're trying to get the Supreme Court to rule they
[54:41.560 --> 54:46.200]  can grab Americans whenever they want and Obama's saying they are the boss now
[54:46.200 --> 54:52.560]  he takes his orders from them not from Congress so this is just incredible
[54:53.200 --> 55:03.200]  Webster yes break down what's happening continue sure the thing you see with
[55:03.200 --> 55:09.360]  you you go out sometimes in the daytime or at night and you hear the sound of
[55:09.360 --> 55:13.560]  these NATO aircrafts up in the up in the air and you realize that they can
[55:13.560 --> 55:19.600]  let's fly at any time and that they're killing people just about every day now
[55:19.600 --> 55:24.720]  we've been rather lucky here in Tripoli for the last three days we haven't had
[55:24.720 --> 55:30.200]  as far as I could see any big bombing here in the city the bombing has been
[55:30.200 --> 55:34.640]  concentrated in Braga out on the on the fighting front against these terrorists
[55:34.640 --> 55:41.680]  along the Mediterranean coast but they have a kind of an idea that four
[55:41.680 --> 55:45.360]  o'clock in the morning is the hour of the wolf and that's when the NATO
[55:45.360 --> 55:49.920]  killers can strike right and there's absolutely no warning and these
[55:49.920 --> 55:54.240]  projectiles break up into eight parts and it destroys a compound another
[55:54.240 --> 55:59.000]  compound we visited was it's in a place called Sormon if you look on the map
[55:59.000 --> 56:06.920]  SORMA and 70 kilometers west of Benghazi I'm sorry of Tripoli here and this was
[56:06.920 --> 56:10.760]  the home of an important guy they were trying to kill him too they tried to
[56:10.760 --> 56:16.280]  kill Gaddafi in his compound one of the other generals that joined the Gaddafi
[56:16.280 --> 56:21.840]  in the coup d'etat of 1968-69 that overthrew the monarchy and created a
[56:21.840 --> 56:27.680]  modern state because that's what this is is a guy called Al-Hueldi Al-Khamidi
[56:27.680 --> 56:34.280]  Al-Khamidi sorry Al-Hueldi Al-Khamidi he's a general and in this ruined
[56:34.280 --> 56:39.280]  compound of his you could see a picture of him meeting with Egyptian President
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.280]  Nasser right back in the back in the 60s presumably so this isn't one another one
[56:44.280 --> 56:49.360]  of the top people and the NATO bombers were attempting to kill him just it's
[56:49.360 --> 56:56.120]  just it's a policy of assassination murder mayhem gratuitous killing and this
[56:56.120 --> 57:01.640]  is in some ways the most heartbreaking moving event I've seen in the trip so
[57:01.640 --> 57:09.920]  far his son is a guy called Khalid Al-Hueldi who's an engineer trained in
[57:09.920 --> 57:15.160]  the United States right talks like an American speaks you know English as well
[57:15.160 --> 57:21.080]  as anybody and what had happened to him was that his wife had been killed and
[57:21.080 --> 57:27.960]  whose two children had been killed is one of his children was a four-year-old
[57:27.960 --> 57:32.880]  girl who was gonna have her fifth birthday now in the 28th of June another
[57:32.880 --> 57:38.760]  was a four-year-old boy but Obama brought them peace Webster hold on Obama told
[57:38.760 --> 57:42.480]  the media last week this is not a war he brought peace to that four-year-old
[57:42.480 --> 57:48.840]  he's a man of peace Al Qaeda is helping how dare you be against I mean that four
[57:48.840 --> 57:53.400]  years and another kid another one of these little kids it just becomes he
[57:53.400 --> 57:58.560]  just became six his birthday had been four days before his death there was
[57:58.560 --> 58:03.840]  one of their ads and then they had a Sudanese cook an African guest worker in
[58:03.840 --> 58:09.320]  his wife so ten people killed at about two two to three o'clock in the morning
[58:09.320 --> 58:14.720]  when NATO delivers their cowardly strikes from 40,000 feet against the
[58:14.720 --> 58:20.760]  defenseless women and children and the crowning hypocrisy and
[58:20.760 --> 58:27.280]  depravity this is NATO claims that this compound was a military base well I'm
[58:27.280 --> 58:32.440]  sorry I walked around this we looked in the rubble obviously you don't want to
[58:32.440 --> 58:36.280]  get too close to the rubble because it's filled with depleted uranium oh my

[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:27.160]  Alex Jones Webster Tarpoli journalist investigative reporter historian
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:34.000]  economist is in Tripoli and he has visited the homes of families murdered
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:41.040]  hit by the demolition bombs and he was just breaking down how they're using
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.880]  Twitter not only to foment these fake revolutions which the Pentagon admits
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.880]  they're doing but also to target who to kill that's how they get their new
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.920]  intelligence they don't have the head of MI6 lie about WMDs is now admitted they
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.440]  just claims somebody Twittered that's why CNN and Fox always say oh look we're
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.440]  getting weather reports from people on Twitter is to then kind of legitimize it
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:08.120]  well Twitter said Gaddafi was roasting babies please continue Webster yeah the
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:12.600]  the way in which the targeting was done of this compound in in
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:18.840]  Sormon where the 10 people were killed the women and the four I guess four
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:23.480]  children killed and it was because they're all in the family of this guy
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:30.360]  I'll quality I'll I'll come 80 one of one of Gaddafi's top colleagues right so
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:35.240]  the Revolutionary Command Council or what that used to be the way they seem
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:40.080]  to have done it this is now the Libyan contention clearly is that they they had
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:47.040]  some infiltrated spotters who got up in a in a local sort of you know microwave
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:53.200]  tower and they had some kind of handheld lasers and they spotted the rubes of
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.600]  these buildings and that's what guided the NATO bombs down to do the killing
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:06.160]  and somehow tip-offs or information went over Twitter say the Libyans so that
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.280]  maybe that puts this this kitty new world of the social media in some kind of
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:19.000]  a different life so I think this is just it's horrifying it's disgusting as an
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.880]  American you are confronted what this regime is doing in your name with your
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:29.800]  tax money and I think it's it's time to to do something about it the very least
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:34.240]  anybody can do is there are going to be these congrats there's a congressional
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:38.200]  recess now for the 4th of July these characters are going to be around and
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:43.240]  you're just going to have to go to them and say look this this war with Libya
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.640]  has to end and normally the congressional comeback would be well we
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.480]  can't abandon our troops who are in harm's way well in this case the
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:55.880]  argument from Obama is there are no troops in harm's way so so there's no
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:00.840]  no you know blackmail that can be done on this issue or you know you're
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.560]  abandoning the troops because Obama says there are no troops that there are
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:11.960]  troops but the Obama claims that there are not so that I think is is the
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.760]  between wait a minute are you challenging Obama this is not a war this is a
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:21.360]  Nobel Peace Prize movement yeah they admit it's killing a lot of women and
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.760]  children but but that's not civilian deaths and you know what Obama's a great
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:32.480]  guy I mean he's he cares about us Webster what we had is the UN resolution
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.800]  says the defense of civilians are the NATO aircraft are acting in defense of
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.000]  armed terrorist gang and they're killing civilians in the process but somebody
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.320]  who knows something about peace a very interesting person to meet this is the
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:51.840]  Bishop of Tripoli Giovanni Martinelli and this is a guy who goes back and
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:57.120]  forth to the Vatican and and has talked to the Pope about this situation and
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:01.960]  Martinelli you know he's obviously horrified by the war he says you know
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:08.880]  how can you expect to bring peace with the with bombs and he also says that
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:15.440]  you have to realize Gaddafi has given full religious freedom the Roman Catholic
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:21.600]  Church in Libya can act perfect with perfect freedom they have nuns they have
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.520]  hospitals they have social services it turns out there are a lot of immigrant
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.800]  workers here from the Philippines the staffs of the hospitals of which there
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.120]  are quite a few and actually quite good are largely Filipino and most of those
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.480]  are Catholic so the Catholic community here used to be Italian but now it's
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.920]  Filipino stay there I want to hear I want to hear about your intel on Western
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.400]  forces are there quote advising and helping with the peace I want to get

[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.680]  about a federal goon spy force over everything to the New York Times they're
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.000]  spying on doctors now the feds are getting ready to nationalize them
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.960]  gathering up then they call it a survey they call them don't know and don't let
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:15.400]  you know who they are it's legal and lawful for doctors to have private

[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.720]  they want they're getting ready to get rid of that that's coming up we've got
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:27.600]  the incredible news with the euro now going into freefall sorrow says there
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.040]  will be countries that exit I want to talk to Tarpley about that in a moment
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:34.960]  but it's so incredible this is Webster's first interview since he got into
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.960]  Tripoli a few days ago he's been unable this was a secret mission he didn't want
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.040]  to obviously be stopped trying to get over there he's got a lot of courage
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.960]  folks Webster Griffin Tarpley speaks four or five languages and he's in North
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.920]  Africa right now in Tripoli and it's because of bombing the cell phones were
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:54.080]  out until today it's in the middle of the night he's got a cold but he's joining
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.640]  us what do you make of Congress saying we don't authorize it but here's the
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:03.600]  money the Italians now shifting gears and saying we now are against this war
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.720]  it's time to stop the Germans as you know a month and a half ago pulled
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.040]  completely out and then meanwhile it's on info wars calm the British have now
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.880]  announced they're preparing to move forward with the ground force they're
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.160]  moving ahead with their fake moral authority having international court of
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.040]  criminals who routinely kill people before they try them whether they're
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.240]  guilty or innocent like Milosevic regardless what you thought of slobo
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:31.480]  they're now issuing the arrest warrant this is going into high gear and a top
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:35.680]  general told Congress yes they're preparing to invade but it'll be a
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:41.680]  peace force with heavy armor so we've now entered actual 1984 and I guess as US
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:45.480]  troops are coming home in body bags they'll tell us that it's it's not a war
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:51.560]  and that it's a kinetic action Webster well I think if they really do take that
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:57.520]  path of absolute strategic insanity they will face extravagant losses their
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:02.040]  attack will break down with great loss and they will be caught in the quagmire
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:07.160]  which will essentially be the open-ended and that maybe that will lead to the
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:11.960]  collapse of the Obama regime certainly might lead to the collapse of Sarkozy and
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:18.080]  Cameron and the other people here in in Europe I think there's a probably the
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:23.120]  best combination we've got in the United States to put an end to this again move
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.440]  those 30 votes out of the war column and into the peace column and it will
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:32.280]  become even more illegal than it is now and might say well that's only the house
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.800]  what can they do they can't get it through the Senate there is one thing the
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:40.320]  house can do and that is to impeach and maybe that deserves to be brought up
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:45.160]  Obama is in violation of the war powers act that is a question of life and death
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:50.680]  it's not miss Lewinsky and it's not any of this other minutiae but it's life and
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:56.520]  death and war and peace and Obama really really needs to be impeached and
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:01.640]  again I would contrast the depravity of Obama with the very good sense of this
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:09.000]  Italian Bishop Martin Edley who you know he says bombs and Christianity don't
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.120]  mix they're they're incompatible and that you cannot base human civilization
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:19.920]  in today's world on a policy of bombing it's just well look bombs to defend
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.920]  yourself is one thing but preemptive war people ask how the Germans did what
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:29.920]  they did Hitler had all sorts of fancy excuses and reasons to go into Danzig
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:36.480]  and then Poland and Czechoslovakia and then finally you know into France and
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:43.920]  this is how this is done this is how wars start and it's on record now even
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.920]  Democrats like Nadler and others in Ron Paul has said Obama if he gets away with
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.520]  this has turned the presidency into an imperial post and there's no reason to
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:57.280]  even have a Congress if this is the case I mean this is earth shattering this has
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:03.560]  never happened in US history I mean this is I mean at least Bush for his evil
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:08.680]  wars got authorization Webster he went through the motions Obama has been
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:14.040]  undoubtedly a step down and I think you and I have been you know ahead of that
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:19.400]  most of it most of the time over the last three years the other webster you
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:23.960]  been on target and Obama deception you said he's gonna invade North Africa as
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:30.120]  a base to create a total destabilization continent-wide Obama deception calls it
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.840]  with total precision people are now watching it and flipping out that it
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.560]  was made more than two years ago yeah that's true well and again that we just
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.440]  need to go from that to not to taking these actions to to shut it down the
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.800]  other thing that's amazing the NATO position is that Sarkozy this tin pot
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:53.880]  dictator in his own right depraved the story of this guy could not be told
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:59.680]  without violating the FCC rules they say they refuse to negotiate they they
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:03.360]  will the Philippian government says come and negotiate we'll be glad to
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:07.600]  negotiate you with you for you know no precondition and the answer of the
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.120]  British and the French is no no negotiations and as the Bishop here
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:19.120]  pointed out dialogue is the daily bread of the Arab and the Bedouin it is the
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:23.200]  characteristic feature of this civilization that there's a constant
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:29.640]  process of negotiating everything it's a kind of a deeply rooted cultural
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:34.800]  tendency and instead what NATO is saying is no we don't want any of that now
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.760]  let me just another scene right what they're saying is your fate is sealed
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:43.040]  we're gonna come in and destroy your industrial base and carry out our soft
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.640]  kill genocide against you and they're saying you have no hope we're coming
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.360]  and that's gonna form total resistance while a bunch of globalist Bilderberg
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:55.160]  group people sit around playing God destabilizing North Africa Middle East
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.040]  Central Asia trip more troops building up in and around Pakistan there's no
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:04.160]  doubt this is leading in a world war three give us one more scene this is the
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:09.040]  tableau at the ship arrived in the harbor here in Tripoli yesterday it's a
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:14.440]  beautiful harbor it looks kind of like Baltimore but much newer and this is a
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.160]  city of more than two million people it's the size of what almost Chicago it's
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:24.720]  a very large and modern compared to Tunis it's much more modern and people
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:29.120]  that I've talked to here with you know that been been here you know five years
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:34.040]  ago ten years ago are marveled by how many new buildings and you know that
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:38.400]  the horizon is covered with cranes buildings are going up everywhere the
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.120]  the oil money is being used and I you know to a significant degree being used
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.880]  wisely wisely so here comes the ship the ship is coming from Benghazi and it's
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:53.160]  carrying refugees what kind of refugees refugees fleeing the terrorist regime
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:57.560]  people who don't want to be in Benghazi anymore and they don't they don't want
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:02.760]  to have any more any more grief with with these terrorists so they come into
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:08.560]  here and and they you know they get off the ship and here you got I saw you know
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:14.320]  the Washington Post the Associated Press the whole media scrum was there I
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.560]  thought the woman who was the correspondent of the first program of
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:24.440]  French television comes in there and she tries to find a woman who's got an
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:29.760]  Islamic burqa on right when this you know complete coverage and she what she's
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:35.600]  trying to do is to say that it's those fundamentalists that leave Benghazi and
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:39.920]  come to be with that with get out of it which is absolutely makes no sense it's
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.400]  the rebirth so you're witnessing the corporate media trying to frame it
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.640]  like who al-Qaeda is with Qaddafi they try to score points against Qaddafi
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:54.760]  any way they can even if it's a total absurdity and these press whores on the
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:17:00.760]  on this dock they have nothing but contempt for the human suffering of
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.600]  the people on that boat who have been forced to flee their horrible people
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.160]  that have sold their souls to be part of the system they're the most vapid I've
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:12.400]  met them they're just vapid gibbering giggling scum who are gonna have all
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:17.040]  their money taken by the bankers don't worry you little servile snakes your
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:20.680]  masters are gonna really give you some of the same stuff you're given these
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:26.320]  North Africans and so therefore you know it's time it's time to put an end to the
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:31.520]  power of these of these little bubbles right these little slime balls of the
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:35.600]  of the press and it's simply the spell is broken nobody can believe them they're
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:42.440]  they're fools buffoons they're just idiots so I think it's it's this is pretty clear cut there
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:47.360]  would be much more to say about the the in the dynamics of these terrorists and
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:52.200]  how they work NATO is violating the UN resolutions like man they're flying in
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:58.240]  weapons they have flown in a plane into Western Libya with special weapons on
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.440]  board they try to seize the area along the Tunisian border they're of course
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:07.840]  operating in in the sort of the middle northern part of the country you know
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:14.320]  especially from from Benghazi towards towards the West this one one top terrorist
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:19.320]  by the name of Hassadi had been the boss of Darna and he'd got himself into the
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.280]  world press and they got embarrassed about him so they shipped him out to
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:27.520]  Egypt but they seem to have brought him back to Mizorata now if you look at that
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:31.280]  battle in Mizorata that is the site of the one of the biggest steel mills in
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.080]  Africa one of the biggest industrial plants in any Arab country watch Mizorata
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:41.560]  and the the Libyans are saying that they think that the the city of Mizorata the
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:45.920]  rebels there are going to get wiped out but a couple of things about these the
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:51.520]  terrorists inside this Benghazi rebel council you have a rivalry there are two
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.120]  people who are supposed to be the top military honchos you have the guy called
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:19:00.880]  Eunice and this other guy called Hafter Hafter was the one who was in northern
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:06.360]  Virginia Eunice had been a minister in one of Gaddafi's government so they
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:12.200]  fight about presidents right who's going to be the top the top commander and the
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:18.440]  way they do it is you have a unit of rebels out in the field here and then
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:22.880]  you know a couple miles away you've got a unit commanded by by Hafter so Eunice
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.360]  who's got his group and Hafter's got their group one of the ways that these
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:31.920]  NATO atrocities happen is the Hafter group calls in and they call in NATO
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.680]  airstrikes on the Eunice group both rebels both terrorists and the Eunice
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.400]  group does the same thing to the Hafter group so one of the reasons NATO is
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:45.120]  killing the rebels is because one rebel group is getting NATO to bomb their
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.920]  rivals and their competition and getting them killed that way and I'm sure
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:54.320]  stop there I want to leave Tripoli now and look to Europe the United States in
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.880]  the short segment coming up I want to look at the huge global financial

[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:27.880]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:31.680]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:12.080]  only on the GCN radio network well we'll get updates from Webster Griffin
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:15.040]  tarply in the days to come as long as the phone lines are up they've been down
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:20.240]  from the peace bombs that are being dropped Webster also said they're not
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.560]  seeing the helicopters as promised only drone helicopters have been shot down
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:28.040]  because there are so many RPGs in the citizens hands and again dictators
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.520]  don't hand out RPGs and millions of Kalashnikovs to a population of six
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:37.120]  million which is so outrageous but they are going ahead with the ground war
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:41.320]  because the globalist again had to just sell the fact that they can do whatever
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:45.480]  they want whenever they want when do the Libyans believe the ground invasions
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:50.680]  coming are confirmed intel is late September early October Webster
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:57.120]  this part of their thinking is maybe not so so obvious I mean what what we have
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:01.240]  tried to convey is the stuff that's in the public domain thanks to your work
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:05.880]  and others right what is widely known it's also known here so I guess they
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:12.120]  would they would converge on that and in some ways they they they they really
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:16.120]  wonder if the ruling elite of the United States is that insane on the other
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:19.560]  hand they've had plenty of lessons that they are that insane that that kind of
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:23.960]  fight forward is exactly what they're what they're likely to do there's a
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:30.840]  kind of calm waiting going on right saying we hope that they're not that
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:35.560]  insane but if they really are then we're pretty much ready the people are
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:41.960]  organized the tribes are mobilized the the system of government by town
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:48.080]  meeting as one what do they think of Obama now the great peace god lovingly
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:55.560]  giving them bombs that is basically his his magic right his deception act is
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:01.760]  finished right that that racket is over with for about 99 percent and the
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:07.280]  people the people who still want to give Obama the benefit of the doubt have
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:13.000]  actually been defecting as as one officially told us he said we had some
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.440]  rats in our government we had rats that had gotten into the government over a
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.320]  period of 40 years and one of the advantages of all this horror is that
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.920]  the rats are now gone so there won't be any need to deal with the rats anymore
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:32.320]  okay we're almost out of time shifting gears now grease deputy prime minister
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.640]  warns of tanks in the streets mass suicides if second pay off to the
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:40.280]  bankers doesn't happen he warns greek parliament london telegraph Greek
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.360]  minister warns of chastrophy if parliamentary revolt leads to austerity
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:50.000]  bill being blocked continuing european leaders prepare for greek default enter
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.640]  the dragon to save the euro the chinese are publicly saying apathetic
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:59.160]  england is idly government tensions rise over austerity plans there there's a
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:02.040]  threat to get rid of the u.s. triple-a writing if they don't give trillions
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:06.600]  more to the bankers so we're seeing the economic terrorism of the banking cartel
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.200]  if people don't raise taxes cut benefits and pay everything to the fraudsters and
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:16.560]  now soros is saying it looks like the euro may collapse that's in bloomberg
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:20.360]  what does that mean webster tarpley in the three minutes we've got left well
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:23.560]  again the only way to make the dollar look good is to make the euro look very
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:27.480]  bad and that's that the attack on the euro by us hedge funds using credit
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:31.640]  default swaps has been going on now for more than a year and a half getting to
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:38.280]  be almost two years I would recommend for the Greeks no more bailouts no
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:43.400]  austerity program austerity doesn't work that's what the papandreou well it's
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.960]  meant to shut their economy down and they've done the actual worries and say
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:49.880]  if we do this we'll never get out of the fraudulent debt that you created so it
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:53.800]  is a third world them they're delivering to them and therefore what they need is
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:57.840]  a debt moratorium they need to declare an immediate unilateral freeze on all
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:03.840]  payments of debt principle and interest with the goal of reducing it by you know
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:08.720]  the maximum amount possible if they can get it you know minus 90 percent they
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.200]  should do that but the only way you can successfully negotiate with the banker
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:18.080]  is to put yourself on an equal footing these bankers are of course zombie
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.920]  bankers the irony the whole thing is that those bankers themselves are more
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.680]  bankrupt than Greece and the people that he gets the bailout is not going to
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:30.200]  Greece no Greek gets any money out of this it goes to the Deutsche Bank 50
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:35.360]  billion euros the French banks 30 billion euros and the British banks maybe
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:40.080]  20 billion euros so this complete monstrosity there's nothing wrong with
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:44.520]  the Greeks they were simply victimized by a cabal of hedge funds with sorrows
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:47.760]  and the rest of them using credit default swap and they now admit that it's
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:52.000]  going to move on to Italy Portugal England the United States and and it's
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.480]  as you it's a black hole there's no way to ever pay it back but it consolidates
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.360]  power for the criminals so they're rampaging forward it's a physical
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:03.680]  impossibility to pay it back so why not just face the physical impossibility and
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:08.000]  say there's no point in ruining the country trying to do something that is
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.040]  prima facie impossible therefore we're essentially going to freeze this debt
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:16.360]  with a view to canceling it at the earliest possible
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.480]  Webster we want to commend we want to we want to commend your amazing courage
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.440]  they're now admitting that we never came out of the recession so the truth is
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:28.640]  starting to dawn here you're in Tripoli go with God be safe we appreciate you
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:33.440]  there being a reporter and somebody to observe the reality of what happened and

[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:41.080]  precisely that's what I hope to do let's try to find a couple you know a little

[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:03.360]  on doctors the New York Times reporting the same things has already been going
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:11.040]  on also if you go to info wars.com there's a report Google updates page rank
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:16.360]  top alternative news aggregator punished and Google's already been taking our
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:21.080]  honors away on YouTube they own it not letting people see our videos blocking
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:26.320]  them and then they removed that last week under protest and they're saying
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:30.320]  that sites and info wars in prison planet most the traffic is our articles
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.760]  and people that write articles for us but we also post blurbs of articles with a
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:37.760]  link to them so you can see what we're claiming you know if I say this is
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:43.040]  happening that's happening or we post whole bills which is you know absolutely
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.840]  authorized to do it's it's it's congressional information if you repost
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:50.400]  anything they're going to quote delist you or start knocking you down the
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:54.840]  rankings and if you throw that back up on screen I'll read the headline out to
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:59.840]  folks again that's why you need to email your entire email list with info
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:05.040]  wars.com that's why you need to email your entire email list with prison
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:08.960]  planet.com that's why you need to tell people about info wars.com that's why
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.320]  I need to get the bumper stickers and put them on your cars because the sites
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:18.440]  are scaring the system and they openly admit they're censoring us we're being
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:22.920]  censored at public libraries universities military bases they have
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:29.400]  these software packages that list things as hacking sites porn sites gambling
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:35.240]  sites hate sites and we get listed as hacking sites and as extreme as sites
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:39.920]  so that you can't access it on many you know public systems in Europe the
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.240]  Watsons have have have covered that so again putting that article on screen
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:52.440]  it's up on info wars.com and the article headline is Google updates page rank
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:57.920]  top alternative news aggregator punished by Eric Blair at info wars.com
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:01.320]  the last time we wrote an article about this drudge picked it up but the
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.760]  headline dealt with overall Google to punish alternative news and drudge is
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.240]  of course a pure aggregator well he rewrites some articles and the man
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:13.040]  who does research and tracks whatever's the hottest so it's targeting all of
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:17.600]  that we need to counter these people and that's realizing how special these
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:22.280]  sites are how important sites like info wars.com and prison planet.com and
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:25.720]  drudge report.com and Wayne Madsen report.com and things like that are
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.640]  because as Hillary said earlier this year the globalists are losing the info
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:34.280]  war that's a quote because there's so much alternative media doing better more
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:39.120]  original reporting and not lying not spinning and so the newspapers the
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:42.840]  mainline sites the TV the networks they're dying they're in freefall all
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:48.200]  of them Glenn Beck's going to internet only pretty much you know on TV Howard
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.080]  Stern's talking about you know almost left XM just to do it only internet
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:56.360]  because that's the future will not under internet to they want to start
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.640]  curtailing that and controlling it and controlling its architecture and that's
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:07.000]  what Bilderberg covered 2011. Now we're going to Wayne Madsen here in a moment
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.920]  I'm going to be down there today at four o'clock of the Texas Capitol just if you
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.360]  want to be part of historically the media called it storming the Capitol we
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:18.640]  didn't storm the Capitol it's our right to go in through the metal detectors nice
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.920]  police there state police lot of nodding and agreeing with us you know that this
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.640]  is wrong unanimous vote of the house against the TSA groping bill cops know
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:31.360]  they can't do that they don't want to do that most of them why can these barely
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:35.360]  trained TSA people do it now they claim the TSA can read minds off your face and
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:39.800]  they admit its cases of a guy's looking down and looks sad they take him into
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.720]  interrogate him he says I'm going my brother's funeral he died three days
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:47.760]  ago I'm sad you know it's total quackdom now they have computers that scan your
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:51.760]  face and quote tell of your a terrorist when decades ago they had to admit that
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:55.480]  lie detector tests were a fraud they just have fancier ones now just a bank of
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:02.800]  blinking lights we're gonna break down the treachery by three men the speaker
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:11.040]  of the house the leader of the Senate and of course the governor and now you
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.040]  know he tried to say nice things about him earlier last week he's having to
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:19.040]  admit a state rep David Simpson is having to admit that yes the Republican
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:22.840]  leadership killed it and his quote was why do we even have a house and Senate
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:26.440]  in Texas then so they're killing it they have all the votes they're killing it
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:30.800]  killing it killing it and then demonizing it so Perry wants to act like
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:33.960]  he's for this while he tried to keep it off the special session we're gonna go
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:38.240]  down there with a citizen filibuster and go and and I've now defined this new
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:44.680]  term that means going in and going up to your house and Senate members and
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:48.400]  telling them to go filibuster or for them to walk out because they got three
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:51.760]  days left in the special session today Tuesday and Wednesday so that another
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:55.560]  session has to be called we've got a month more to try to pass this you're
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:58.480]  like but we already they killed it once we brought it back they're killing it
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:03.640]  again it's fight fight fight and expose the politicians for their tricks you
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:07.280]  don't just fight once you fight over and over again it's who wants it most like
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:10.760]  George Washington he lost most of the battles over seven years but he
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:15.240]  persevered now we're going to Wayne Madsen here in just a moment but I want

[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.720]  Wayne thanks for joining us via video Skype hi Alex good to be with you good
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:56.320]  to have you there my friend so break down the latest I mean you've been to
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:01.000]  Tripoli you've covered it what's happening okay well I was over in Tripoli
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.840]  on a dignity delegation at the former representative sent the image put
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:13.800]  together I had been with her in October 2009 and she asked for journalists to go
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:19.960]  go back because she said look what's happening here is not being reported by
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:27.280]  the Western media and sure enough after we went from we flew to Milan and then
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.280]  to Tunis and then took a plane from Tunis to the island of Gerba right near
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:37.800]  the Libyan Tunisian border they went by car because of the air embargo the
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:44.720]  Tripoli it was quite clear that we saw no current signs of rebel activity
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:49.640]  anywhere from the Tunis for the trip with that as a matter of fact we came across
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:55.880]  one okay Wayne your video was clear from to Wayne Wayne when your video Skype
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:00.200]  was clear now the audio is breaking up while they just try to go audio only on
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:03.400]  Skype if that doesn't work we'll call you on phone while we get this key
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:06.480]  intelligence again you've been there several times you just returned from a
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.360]  trip there for folks that had trouble making that out and this is a big deal
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.280]  I mean even Democrats and Republicans are saying Obama is becoming an emperor
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:19.480]  and saying the UN is his authority he doesn't need Congress Congress
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:23.960]  traitorously tried to give him authorization a few weeks ago and Obama
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:27.040]  said I don't need your stinking authorization this isn't a war it's
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:32.680]  humanitarian the UN says so and they got drones murdering whole families bombing
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:39.760]  apartment buildings I mean it is on and they are just okay Wayne continue so you
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:44.320]  just got back yet from from Tripoli break down what's happening right there there
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:49.480]  was no current sign of rebel activity anywhere from the Tunisian border all
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:55.040]  the way into Tripoli there had been back in when the rebellion first started in
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:01.200]  February it looks like the NATO countries may have inserted people in
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:05.600]  the area to cause problems but we came across an impromptu pro-Qaddafi
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:10.240]  demonstration on the main coastal highway from the Tunisian border into
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:15.080]  Tripoli once we got to Tripoli life was normal and this was not being reported
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:21.440]  by the media that since constant the Rixos Hotel in downtown Tripoli life was
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:25.920]  normal except for the constant nightly NATO bombardments the only planes you
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:30.560]  could hear of course in the air at night were NATO aircraft and you knew when
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:34.560]  you heard them get ready because the bombs are coming next and sure enough
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:41.240]  you'd you'd see the explosions and feel the rumble if you were outside at night
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:45.920]  and you would also feel it as I did in the hotel room I was on it on the 10th
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:50.640]  floor you mean you would see the kinetic piece yes we would see the kinetic
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:55.760]  military action they were constantly bombarding the Qaddafi military compound
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:01.160]  which was about a kilometer and a mile from our hotel this was where people
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:05.160]  were gathering every night offering themselves as human shields these were
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:11.440]  people men women kids from all walks of life going there after they got off from
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:17.960]  work cheering Qaddafi you know and we went as Americans and thinking well what
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:22.000]  kind of a reception are we gonna get and and to a person they said we love
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.120]  America but you're pre-Obama we thought he was great we're Africans he's an
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:32.000]  African-American but now he's bombing our country what's wrong with them and
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:37.120]  this was a constant question we were asked by the people of Libya there were
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:44.640]  even a traffic policeman out on the streets directing traffic who were not
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:50.400]  even armed so the fact is that people like people like John Burns from the
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:54.840]  New York Times one of these war correspondents that goes from US war to
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:46:00.000]  US war and broadcast Pentagon propaganda and Simon Denier formerly from Reuters
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  and now with the Washington Post basically broadcasting or writing from
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:09.600]  Tripoli that you know the city's under siege and life is not normal Qaddafi's
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:14.360]  on the ropes none of this was true this was rank propaganda from these and
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:19.200]  other journalists so it's like the rough riders charging a hill where no one
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:23.880]  was it's like it's like Hearst publishing you give me the photos the
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:28.520]  paintings the illustrations I'll give you the war or more recently what you
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:32.640]  have the Qaddafi forces running around naked with bottles of Viagra though no
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:37.480]  yeah yeah well that's another one you know and that was not that wasn't true
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:42.320]  of course here's another thing and this is gets some more serious issues there
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:47.400]  have been many people who originally went with the rebels who have now go try
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:52.280]  to go back to Qaddafi because they say look of course we wanted a more open
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:56.760]  society but we did also didn't want a NATO invasion of our nation and they
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:02.200]  have tried to get back to Qaddafi and we've heard these cases of NATO bombing
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:06.520]  rebels by mistake quote-unquote by mistake it's quite clear from
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.840]  intelligence I picked up from people in Tripoli that some of these rebel
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:16.720]  movements were rebels trying to get back to Tripoli to rejoin Qaddafi to fight
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:20.840]  with him against the NATO invasion and that's why they were targeted by NATO
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:26.000]  Tarpoli was on with us earlier Webster Tarpoli he says also some of the rebel
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.760]  groups are calling in airstrikes on other rebel groups that they're fighting
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:36.200]  with overpower and that it's a type of high-tech fragging well that's it and
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:41.000]  and the the other thing that's very disconcerting and there is an economic
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.800]  embargo against Western Libya even fishing vessels can't go out to get
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:51.240]  their daily catch because they're interdicted by NATO vessels and that's genocide right
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:56.000]  there keeping folks from food right and there's also the gas shortage the gas
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.880]  there's long long gas lines some of the miles and miles long taxis have one
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:05.680]  trucks have another for diesel others but here you have ambulances we're
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:10.240]  bombing civilian residences and and there you know there's a shortage of
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:14.840]  gasoline even for ambulances this is collective punishment this is no
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:19.640]  different than the collective punishment that we see Israel do against the
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:23.760]  people of Gaza NATO is doing the same thing against the people of Western
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:28.920]  Libya and and and these people are innocent they're caught in this civil
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:34.280]  war this civil war that's basically being supported by NATO and I visited one
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:38.080]  man in a hospital who had been hit in the abdomen with shrapnel from a NATO
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:44.040]  bombing and he was a history teacher high school history teacher and he knew a
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:48.440]  lot about American history and he said I don't understand why you're bombing our
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:54.640]  country we never attacked you even with the nonsense that you know the US was
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:59.240]  supposedly said that Libya was behind the blowing up a pan am 103 when there's
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:04.080]  ample evidence to show that it was Iran it did that and George HW Bush it wanted
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:08.880]  to blame Qaddafi because he needed Iran to stay neutral because he had designs
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:15.240]  on invading Iraq in those days operation Desert Storm so they the people
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:18.920]  will it be a are wondering why have you done why are you attacking us we've
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:23.480]  never attacked you and what do they think of the statements by the governments
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:29.080]  that this is a war well of course they know it's war now after I left I was
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:33.960]  there for a little over four days Cynthia McKinney stayed even longer and then
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:37.680]  after we left of course now they're bombarding during a day so it's day and
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:43.320]  nighttime bombardment and they're trying to basically wear the people down all
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:48.360]  the Psyop all the information war fair going on that one thing that wasn't
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:53.760]  reported at all in this country was that the rebels are huge crooks remember
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:57.400]  Ahmad Shalabi and Iraqi National Congress and now there's 18 billion
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:03.920]  dollars lost that we kicked over to these Iraqi anti-Saharan people well we
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:08.720]  have the same thing playing out in Libya now when the rebels took over Benghazi
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:15.560]  they looted the central bank of Benghazi of 900 million dollar 900 million and
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:23.040]  Libyan dinars in cash and 500 point five million in US dollar currency and now
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:28.320]  they want the Libyan assets unfrozen even people in our Treasury Department don't
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.760]  want to do that because they say look they've they've stifled off all this
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:35.720]  money out of the Libyan central bank now they want to steal more money and
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:39.520]  obviously to put in your Swiss bank and we know that there's Al Qaeda commanding
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:44.000]  it and we're on patriotic for saying don't give billions of dollars to Al
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.320]  Qaeda stay there I want to get your take on the it's now admitted in Congress

[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:28.720]  House the speaker to kill the bill that was going to be voted on unanimously
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:32.440]  they well it's been voted on unanimously before they had almost unanimous
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:38.880]  votes lined up Perry was forced put on special session and now he wants to be
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:41.840]  able to have his cake and eat it too that's his specialty is to even introduce
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:48.120]  bills that he later secretly kills it's it's unbelievable dirt baggadness so
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:53.720]  what do you expect from Al Gore's former chief of staff campaign manager oh you
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:55:01.720]  didn't know that yeah now continuing here with Wayne Madsen Wayne oh you're
[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:04.880]  there in DC you're covering all this you get ready to leave the US again you've
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:09.400]  been to Tripoli they're now admitting they're getting ready for US slash
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:14.360]  British slash NATO peace force that will invade Tripoli and they're they're
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:18.160]  saying you will not resist us or its terrorism so now we're gonna have the
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:21.880]  spectacle of heavy armor rolling and firing and if you fire back you're now
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:27.120]  a terrorist I mean this is this is total mind control well that's right and
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:32.840]  what we do know is that the Libyan government is distributing 1.3 million
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:39.040]  weapons to people in in Western Libya I spoke to one Libyan official who said
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.120]  look hey we're we have something really nice cooked up for the American troops
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:45.960]  when they arrive they're really gonna like what we're gonna serve them
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:52.400]  obviously he's not talking about meals ready to eat so that guy's a terrorist
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:57.280]  he should join Al Qaeda in the East and join the people that run America he
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:01.600]  should thank them for the bombs killing children everywhere and how dare him say
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:06.480]  that he would fight back against tanks with a gun he's a coward right and I'll
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:10.640]  tell you the other thing that's not being reported is that the 1.3 billion
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:15.080]  dollars stolen by Goldman Sachs from the Libyan sovereign wealth fund it's quite
[01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:18.520]  clear that this was part of an investigation being conducted by the
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:23.040]  Gaddafi government the anti-corruption agency was looking at the siphoning off
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:29.320]  of billions of dollars from Libyan oil revenue by certain government ministers
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:34.280]  and isn't it funny almost to a person these are the very ministers who defected
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:39.280]  to the rebels heralded oh they've they're quitting Gaddafi going to the other side
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:42.160]  they're going they went to the other side because they were about ready to be
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:46.800]  indicted and they were going to go on trial for for fraud and siphoning off
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:51.600]  that money and it's it's thought that when Saif Gaddafi's Gaddafi's son said
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:57.160]  look we bankrolled Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign in France and that
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:01.160]  some of that money from Goldman Sachs may have been the money that want a wound
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:04.420]  up and of course he made a deal with them it's in mainstream news they stole
[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:09.600]  tens of billion but again when you want me to believe Goldman Sachs would double
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:15.200]  cross somebody that is how Goldman Sachs are good people oh yeah and and the
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:19.960]  other thing isn't it funny it's Sarkozy who was the first to go after Libya he
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:24.560]  was the first to recognize the rebels obviously that the the first target of
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:30.000]  the NATO aircraft happened to be the anti-corruption agency in Tripoli that
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.160]  had all the files well all this missing money well we all know our government's
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:39.240]  good that wouldn't be happening come on there they're fighting they're fighting
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:44.880]  to give freedom to Al Qaeda man yeah that's right I mean I wish we saw the
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:49.240]  video because I also we went to the the bombed-out resonance of Gaddafi's son
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:54.480]  and I picked up a piece of rubble I'm gonna try to have this tested for the
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:58.440]  pleaded uranium but it's quite clear that NATO said that was a military target
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:03.680]  well it happened the only thing I saw in the compound there was a petting zoo
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:08.080]  where Momar Gaddafi was feeding the animals when they hit the main built the
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:12.320]  main structure that's the only reason he survived so they were trying to kill him
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:16.840]  I saw I picked up this piece of rubble next to the first lady of Libya's and bag
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:22.840]  and a shoe how would somebody like to go to Camp David and find the singed handbag
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:27.120]  and shoe of the first lady Michelle well that handbag is actually a proton bomb
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:32.200]  and those camels and rabbits whatever they had are actually have big vampiric
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:37.280]  fangs like in the the Monty Python holy grail the deadly rabbit that did I mean
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:47.520]  that rabbit can attack tanks evil you are listening to GCN visit GCN live com

[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:49.760]  me on the ground but it's not gonna be you know on the ground military action
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:53.400]  even though there's already reportedly u.s. troops to that have been killed
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:58.480]  mercenaries dying videos of them directing artillery it's on and they're
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:01.440]  racing to go ahead and get the full war going because then a lot of people will
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:05.120]  still say well gotta support the trips well how about you support them by not
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:10.080]  putting them in illegal wars you know if you were in Nazi Germany in 1939 it
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:15.200]  would be supporting the troops to not go along with invading Poland but America's
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:19.960]  going to be a known like Nazi Germany and let it be on record that I spoke out
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:23.520]  against this and I was against this and having the UN tell the president what to
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:28.040]  do so Sarkozy and others can bag all that cash they stole from the Libyans
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:33.200]  but continuing here they've already double-crossed their old dictator Mubarak
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:36.600]  now they're going after Gaddafi made deals with them what signal does this
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:40.480]  send to other leaders around the world about playing footsie with the New World
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:45.080]  Order Wayne well let's look what happened just in Tehran the last few days
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:50.200]  we had an anti-terrorism summit in Iran attended by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:54.840]  who shows up president Taliban of Iraq president Karzai of Afghanistan and
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:59.640]  presidents are Dari of Pakistan all supposedly US allies going to hear
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:04.520]  people in Iran say the United States is a terrorist nation so what does that do
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:09.000]  it was all of our supposed allies are running away from us they say hey you
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.680]  know we got it we got a throw in our lot with Iran and the other countries and
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:18.360]  build up a coalition and an axis of intelligence against the Saudis over
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:23.120]  under the Russians and so the Pakistanis to the to the Chinese absolutely and
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:28.080]  and and the the other the other thing is I I've got up on my website my home page
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:34.760]  today 1998 Libyan request for an interpol red notice arrest warrant against
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:39.720]  Osama bin Laden it was granted there was an arrest now today the International
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:44.000]  Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Moammar Qaddafi the
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.360]  International Criminal Court never issued one of those for Osama bin Laden ever in
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:54.440]  its existence since 02 because I think the reason they had to stage this phony
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:03:00.080]  death of bin Laden was what if Qaddafi's captured put on trial and he says well I
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:03.400]  want to call bin Laden as a witness because I was the first world leader to
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:08.480]  put in a arrest warrant against this guy because the British and a military
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:13.400]  intelligence and CIA were using a bin Laden to try to kill me Moammar
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:17.280]  Qaddafi wouldn't that have been embarrassing so dead men don't tell no
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:22.880]  tales they had it they had to officially declare bin Laden dead with that phony
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:27.680]  well it's very un-American for you to talk about about bin Laden now that
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:32.720]  there are main allies fighting Qaddafi I mean next George Washington is gonna be
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:36.560]  a bad guy you're some kind of sicko I so am I I guess because I think this is a
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:40.200]  war and the government says it's not so let's not be conspiracy theorist Wayne
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:45.360]  Madsen of the Wayne Madsen report calm in closing do you think overall I mean
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:49.960]  NATO can't back off now do you think the ground invasion is on well what we
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:53.160]  already see the Italians wanting to leave the coalition they want to cease
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:57.680]  fire I think I think what we're gonna see is NATO is gonna is the coalition's
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:03.520]  gonna fray and if anybody goes in guess so it's gonna be it's gonna be US maybe
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:07.600]  French and British ground troops and and that's gonna be it and what do you
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:10.600]  predict you've been there many times what do you predict is gonna happen to
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:16.200]  those troops a bloodbath if I were if I were able to invest money I would be
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:21.920]  investing money in companies that sell coffins and body bags to the Pentagon
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:27.160]  yeah because the North Africans will fight like the devil absolutely
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:34.200]  absolutely and and at 1.3 million armed Libyans including the home guard women
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:40.200]  they're all gonna go out and and welcome the Americans with with the AK-47s
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:47.440]  well I mean look I'm pro-US so I'm with Al Qaeda now and I'm just get get
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:52.680]  Gaddafi get him get him okay Wayne it's wrong to talk bad Al Qaeda's now our
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:57.920]  friend okay Obama said so that's why they're changing their name yes thank
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:03.000]  you so much for joining us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.440]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:11.440]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:14.880]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:19.400]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:23.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:27.960]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:31.760]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:35.360]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:39.720]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:42.880]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:46.560]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:33.480]  okay we've got a lot of important news to cover this shower and I'm going to
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:40.240]  cover the waterfront here it just so happened that Tarpleys in Libya Madsen
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:44.520]  just got back this is heating up constitutional crisis al Qaeda forces
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:49.840]  started the war US-British NATO backed it's on record the Qaddafi finance
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:54.840]  Sarkozy this is some weird double-cross with the big bank stealing the
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:59.600]  country's money these are just such crooks and I'm not a fan of Muammar
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:05.800]  Qaddafi but compared to most people in the region I mean he's a schoolboy and
[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:09.760]  he is a military guy and he's bought a lot of high-tech weapons and they're
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:14.120]  waiting quote with the surprises under their hat and their countries getting
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:18.720]  bombed for three plus months with Western backed al Qaeda rebels pouring in
[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:22.720]  same ones that attacked the Russians the Serbs the Iranians and people are
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:27.080]  really sick of this and every al Qaeda guys gotten on the plane drugged up with
[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:31.160]  their underwear bombs their shoe bombs they try to light with matches you don't
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:36.120]  like plastic explosives with a match folks it's a electrical charge I mean
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:41.440]  it's all fake it's of the top five al Qaeda guys what four of them born in the
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:46.640]  US publicly protected allowed to fly anywhere anytime a country arrest them
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:52.200]  the US goes and gets them out I mean it's very elementary the Muslim extremist
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:57.880]  work for the bankers period they don't want secular Western governments they
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:01.240]  don't want to get along with the Arabs they don't want to get along with Islam
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:06.640]  they want to put radicals in and they do it does and then a lot of the radicals
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:11.160]  didn't go finance crazies who really do hate America and then attack us and the
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:16.240]  bankers go we'll take your rights to keep you safe I mean it's so elementary
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:21.720]  it's last night I was in a store and I was talking to this guy he goes I like
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:25.560]  your show but my buddy's in the FBI and he's worried about Muslims and Sharia law
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:29.640]  and all this stuff and I'm like well if you're more if you're concerned about
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:33.240]  more extreme forms of that you better learn who finances it he goes no
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:36.840]  actually my buddy the FBI was talking about that too and doesn't know why the
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:45.200]  government does it you don't know why the government does it because Muslim
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:50.760]  extremists are perfect to be handled by double agents and we'll go out and carry
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:54.360]  out heinous acts that are then used to take everybody's freedoms and invade
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:58.520]  these countries and take them over the globalist use it as a skeleton key to
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:02.120]  take our rights and give trillions of dollars to military industrial complex
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.600]  in the name of protecting us and to go and invade all these countries and get
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:15.400]  trillions of dollars into that military black hole it's called full spectrum
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:20.880]  dominance and if you're in full spectrum dominance you want to manipulate and
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:25.000]  control all sides and then you sit outside of that paradigm and then only
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.800]  you were left standing I forget the James Bond movie that it was but it was
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:37.240]  one of the early ones with Sean Connery I've never seen it it starts with him
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:41.880]  well it starts with an evil guy on some boat and he's explaining to his agents
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:47.160]  in the in the group chaos or whatever the name or specter I forget what it
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:53.320]  was specters get smart and then it was I guess chaos I forget the point is and
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:58.200]  he's got Chinese fighting fish and there's three of them in there and he
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:02.200]  goes look at the smart one it waits and it waits for the other to fight one's
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:07.840]  dead the others weakened and then the smart one comes in and kills the weakened
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:11.400]  one he goes that is what we will do we'll play groups off against each other
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:14.880]  and of course those books that were made into films were written by one of the
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:20.360]  top people in MI6 formerly OSS let me give you a more modern-day example of
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:25.120]  how this works please and I remember the New York Times the Washington Post at
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:30.560]  the time that Revenge of the Sith came out cheesy Star Wars movies but George
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:34.640]  Lucas they were saying what does the plot mean we don't understand it and he
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:37.160]  said what do you mean you don't understand it it's exactly what our
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:41.760]  government's doing today Emperor Palpatine is George W. Bush he said
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:47.040]  that it cans film festival and I talked to so many adults who have such a blind
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:52.320]  spot they couldn't understand the plot of a movie designed for ten-year-olds
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:57.000]  much much of it almost unwatchable I don't even like it but I like the plot
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:03.400]  line okay and and and folks I might even go over the plot line if adults can't
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:06.920]  figure out the plot line of a children's movie of course you can't figure out
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:12.200]  what's happening today of course you can okay I've got a lot of key news to
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:15.680]  cover and the big TSA protest we're gonna have at four o'clock today inside the
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:19.040]  Capitol or to be technical we're gonna go talk to our representatives it's not
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:24.000]  even a protest it's a citizen filibuster and I'll explain that in a moment so
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.600]  wherever you're listening in Texas even if you're up in the Dallas right now
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:31.720]  listening to us on fine stations the DFW area get in your car drive down and I'll
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:34.640]  see if the Texas Capitol four o'clock or get there at six o'clock seven o'clock
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:37.760]  so what we're gonna be there for three days off and on I'll be there for three
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:42.360]  days off and on you need to be there as well can't come today come tomorrow but
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:47.880]  four is when we really need you to have that good showing for the media let me
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:52.520]  just briefly explain revenge of the Sith plot line because at the time we
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:56.240]  wrote articles about it because the media said we don't understand this what
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:02.720]  this makes no sense the most popular of the three prequels they made total sense
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:09.240]  Emperor Palpatine was a little-known senator from Naboo small planet he
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:16.320]  finances terrorists to attack the planet and then he plays victim and says
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:21.840]  says that the pacifist republic isn't doing enough to help him with the
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:27.600]  terrorist invasion the trade federation invasion who even speak in Chinese
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:33.280]  accents it's all geopolitical and so yeah little aliens with Chinese accents he
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:39.360]  then goes and complains and catapults himself in the crisis into the role of
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:44.880]  chancellor because you know he was the victim but now he he demanded something
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:50.040]  be done he'd been a pacifist previously now he's chancellor episode two launches
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:55.880]  terror attacks all over the galaxy with groups he's secretly financing through
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:00.080]  his backers in the trade federation he turns around double crosses in the end
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:06.280]  Lord Veda kill vice-royal gunray and everyone else in the so basically in
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:09.600]  the end they knock out all of the people that backed him which always happens
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:16.040]  Nazi Germany Soviet Russia Malish China learn from history then in episode so he
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:21.960]  uses that to build up the power of the Empire in episode two and now he's got
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:26.200]  this big imperial army but it's not imperial yet but it's it's the storm
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:30.480]  troopers the outfits the weapons systems to counter this outside threat run by
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:34.000]  Count Dooku that the Osama bin Laden guy that actually works for him and they
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:40.400]  meet in secret now in episode three he launches an attack on the imperial

[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:54.640]  side Anakin Skywalker to make him Darth Vader and in the end he then sets up

[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:02.560]  terrorist and has the anti-terror forces going and wipe him out and then he
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:08.720]  says he's launching a global intergalactic war to bring peace now
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:13.520]  the media could could not understand wait and they actually wrote articles
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:19.240]  Emperor Palpatine's attacking himself it makes no sense adults cannot understand
[02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:26.680]  children level ideas okay child level ideas child level are we saying Count
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:31.800]  Dooku is good no we're not saying bin Laden's good are we saying the trade
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:36.520]  Federation's good no but they're being played the globalist went and hired the
[02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:40.640]  Chinese in the 70s to be part of this larger deal to muscle out the industrial
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:47.720]  base of the West they're gonna be set up and George Lucas big you know insider
[02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:53.200]  THX 1138 about digital high-tech tyrannies of the future you know one
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:58.760]  child policies he comes out and in like two paragraphs says this is exactly
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:03.160]  what's happening today I wrote this decades ago but I rewrote it for what's
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:08.560]  happening in the in the world today this movie is a allegory of what's really
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:16.280]  happening what how can you not understand it okay very simple all right
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:23.360]  I'm done I've wasted a bunch of time ladies and gentlemen the modern slimy
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:29.240]  politician is all about deception Obama tells you that's national free
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:32.160]  health care we're gonna get the rich guys and give you money turns out it's
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:34.840]  written by the health insurance companies to make you buy it lowers the
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:38.720]  standard of care and exempts people with pre-existing conditions and as a total
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:46.760]  scam and he exempts all his buddies it's the same thing over and over and over
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:51.800]  again with what you're told something is for the reason you're told something's
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:57.120]  being done and we're seeing similar tricks today with Rick Perry Rick Perry
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:00.840]  says it's a priority that this anti-groping bill passes he passes
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:05.400]  unanimously he has David Dewhurst former CIA block op commander kill the bill
[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:10.680]  senators go public Dewhurst is under heat it's very politically unpopular
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:13.400]  what he did so he says okay I'll put it in the special session of the governor
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:17.160]  will the governor runs out the clock says it can't pass says nobody can add it
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:20.120]  knowing full well he's the one that adds it he gets caught with his pants down
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:24.480]  adds it then they have the speaker of the house kill it last Friday now to
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:28.760]  bring out a new watered-down bill there's nothing more from what representative
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:36.080]  David Simpson has said and I've scanned over the bill then a kind of glorified
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:42.400]  resolution it does nothing now regardless the point is this is a great
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:48.000]  example of the duplicitous type manipulation that we see it's like
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.200]  George Bush said I'm passing along trying to get Congress pass a law to give
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:57.160]  you health freedom and to protect your medical records did the opposite they
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:00.880]  call the Patriot Act the Patriot Act they call a federal plan to drug half the
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:07.000]  kids in America new freedom initiative this is how they do it so what is a
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:14.080]  citizen filibuster us depending on parliamentary rules in a house or
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:19.480]  Senate federal state house members Senate members can stand up and filibuster
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:23.440]  legislation they don't like and hold up an entire session to make sure a bill
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:26.760]  gets killed and that's an emergency procedure in the state and federal
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:31.080]  constitutions to block really bad things well what we're saying is today
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:34.160]  tomorrow the next day we're doing a citizens filibuster we're going into
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:38.320]  their offices to talk to them and to tell them we want the members to go
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:41.800]  launch their own filibusters or to withdraw themselves from the votes to
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:46.280]  talk to colleagues to tie all this up so another special session has to get
[02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:50.400]  launched and announced after Wednesday we're running the clock out on them here
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:54.280]  they're trying to do that to us now we're gonna reverse that and do that to
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:58.120]  them this is a this is a military tactic in legislation everything's

[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:20.400]  here's some interesting news about a CNN money X City group vice president
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:25.240]  charged with 19 million dollar fraud and I've been predicting this would happen
[02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:27.760]  they're going to burn some vice presidents and people in that big show
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:31.760]  trials on TV they've already had congressional hearings on you know
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:36.040]  smaller timber wolf stuff done by a Goldman Sachs and others and they'll
[02:24:36.040 --> 02:24:41.360]  burn some low-level people for 19 mil but if you launder 376 billion in your
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:46.920]  Wacovia and Wells Fargo no problem are you still tens of trillions to take it
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:52.960]  offshore no problem but Gary Foster a former city group executive I mean vice
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:57.560]  presidents these companies are dime a dozen was arrested Monday on charges he
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:01.480]  embezzled more than 19 million from the bank so he's being arrested for stealing
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:06.720]  from the bankers and he's gonna go to the wall but it'll also be paraded as if
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:10.960]  he did everything or in a criminal complaint unsealed in New York Foster
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:14.280]  allegedly transferred millions of dollars from various city group accounts and it
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:17.920]  was personal account at JP Morgan Chase on eight separate occasions well I mean
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:23.920]  you hired him to do that I mean come on Foster 35 is accused of using fraudulent
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:29.040]  contracts and deal numbers to amass the transfers I mean Bank of America takes
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:32.440]  houses that are paid for they don't even have a deed to I mean why not I mean oh
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:36.240]  but I understand it's okay when it's done to us or veterans have their death
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:40.600]  benefits taken by big banks that's good but you don't see when I was first given
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:43.960]  the article I thought oh they charged somebody oh he stole from the banks I'm
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:49.960]  sorry he's he stole from Al Capone and you don't do that now I want to
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:53.760]  specifically when we come back open the phones up and I want to hear if you're
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:58.120]  outraged by the unanimous vote and then they killed it in the Texas House the
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:02.360]  whole country watching they kill it in the Senate then they bring it back Perry
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:06.880]  says he can't put it on the session folks know that he can we force him to he
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:09.840]  waits till the end and then they have the speaker of the house come out and
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:13.400]  badmouth the bill saying oh it's a stunt oh really I've read the bill the
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:17.440]  attorney general signed off on it Texas said yeah it's official oppression they
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:20.240]  just come up and randomly stick your hands down people's pants or squeeze
[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:25.000]  their genitals you can't do that and now the speaker comes out and says it's it's
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:31.440]  it's a bad thing nope this is bad and it's not our job at the state to do this
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:35.440]  it's the feds well why even have a state why even have a speaker of the house in
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:40.760]  Texas why even have you because you're already violating the rules and blocking
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:44.800]  it last Friday and now they reportedly are set to vote on some some facsimile
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:49.000]  whitewash and David Simpson and his lawyers have gone over it and they put
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.160]  out a press release this morning saying they are withdrawing support for that
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:56.600]  bill so it's simple and it's up to you folks if you're listening to my voice

[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:41.760]  what we think and we'll then go to individual members offices and citizens
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:47.200]  and talk to our public servants not our officials not our authorities not our

[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:30.680]  and a citizen fellow buster going to their offices and talking to them and
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:35.120]  tell them hey you don't like being buffaloed you don't like being run over
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:38.720]  you don't like the House Speaker and the Senate leader and others behind the
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:43.520]  scenes when they claim they supported it now 180 and being honest and killing it
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:46.320]  you know being honest about the fact that they're traders against state
[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:50.240]  sovereignty the 4th Amendment and 10th Amendment 9th Amendment then don't go
[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:57.040]  vote on any of these votes abstain go get your other colleagues to filibuster
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:29:00.400]  get up even if you can't some of them because I forget the entire House rules
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:03.760]  every state's different but I know some fellow busters are allowed by senior
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:07.880]  members definitely of the Senate guys will you pull up Texas filibustering
[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:14.760]  rules for me please Texas filibustering rules we're gonna pull that up during the
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:18.360]  break so I can check that but the point is even if you can't filibuster they can
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:24.000]  do technical filibusters where members talk about each bill and and and and and
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.680]  spend time on all the bills and just hang the whole thing up and this is an
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:32.600]  American institution to do this we're gonna go lobby for them to filibuster
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:36.440]  lobby for them to bring up technical points that's when I'm dubbing a citizen
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:42.000]  filibuster we don't just have the jury box the grand jury box or the voting box
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:47.080]  we also have the pamphlets the press and we have the power of the citizen

[02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:40.680]  hours because I have to I'll be down there at four o'clock and I was correct
[02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:46.280]  from memory it's the Texas Senate can do a filibuster technically house members
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:50.520]  can speak on rules or on a point for quite a long time the national record
[02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:57.480]  either federal or state is held by Senator Bill Miller state senator for the
[02:33:57.480 --> 02:34:02.080]  state of Texas he has the national record as well 43-hour filibuster on
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:13.880]  a SB 1275 during the 65th regular session in 1977 senator Meyer objected to the
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:17.840]  provision of the bill which would have prevented public inspection of the
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:24.120]  records of an industrial accident that's good that was to have sunshine on
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:29.800]  things senator Bill Meyer said that wrong three times an hour twice was the
[02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:36.000]  longest filibuster a filibuster is a prolonged discussion of a bill by an
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:39.320]  individual intended to delay legislative action or filibusters allow the state of
[02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:42.760]  Texas filibusters are permitted in the Senate but not in the House
[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:46.160]  representatives filibusters are governed by the Senate rules and by
[02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:52.520]  precedents interpreting the rules and he requires a member to stand at their
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:56.920]  desk the member speaking may not sit lean or use the desk or chair in any
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:01.920]  way bathroom breaks are not allowed man I could do a filibuster but not my
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:10.240]  more than 24 hours can you imagine 43-hour filibuster 43 hours standing up
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:16.240]  and non-stop talking you think I can talk ladies and gentlemen back this three
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:20.400]  hour show a lot of times is nothing but a ranting filibuster against air any I
[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:25.880]  can imagine 43 hours I did off and on you know for 27 hours for that money bomb
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:33.360]  we did and that was nothing I'm a wimp that's it I got to do a 24-hour radio
[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:38.240]  show and do non-stop without commercials I feel pathetic but hey I'm proud of
[02:35:38.240 --> 02:35:42.840]  Texan has the record in the United States so we're going down there I mean
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:47.800]  our ancestors could stand there for 40-something hours non-stop not eating
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:52.200]  not drinking not going to the bathroom for freedom can you get in your car and
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:55.440]  drive down there in two and a half hours can you go will you go talk to your
[02:35:55.440 --> 02:36:01.000]  representatives it was very effective last time we got it back on now they've
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.360]  engaged in more sneakiness to get it back off but it shows how desperate they
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:09.440]  are the feds know if states start standing up if states start exercising
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:13.360]  their power especially a big prominent state as go Texas goes the rest of the
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:17.840]  nation the globalist will start losing they have to keep up this arrogant
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:24.600]  con artist idea of infallibility and invincibility they are not I want to see
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:33.320]  you down there 1-800-259-9231 we'll take some calls and I've got some other
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:38.200]  incredible news on big brother federal spy snooping new Obama program sending
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:43.680]  out snoopers to pose as patients so they can check up on doctors well they
[02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:49.280]  might be al-Qaeda also the euro collapsing I talked about this briefly
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:54.720]  yesterday but I do got to talk some time about the star spangled banner being
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:59.600]  booed 80 plus percent of the people in the stadium for the Mexican team in
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:04.640]  California Southern California and booing the American team pretty much
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:08.680]  constantly and that happens in some games but not at this level and certainly
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:13.200]  not during a national anthem and and the interviewed the folks in the LA
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:18.480]  Times I said well I live here in the US but I'm for Mexico and see that's the
[02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:25.120]  issue that's the problem with identity people can't even wear American flags
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:29.920]  now in many high schools in America that is not allowed that's political
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:34.880]  correctness ladies and gentlemen and it just shows what what the globalists
[02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:40.440]  are doing to this country but if you just joined us Rick Perry had David do
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:43.760]  hers kill the bill when he unanimously passed the house and they had a near
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:47.440]  unanimous in the Senate one vote against he killed it wouldn't let it come to a
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:50.560]  vote but they had the votes lined up then tried to cover up he did it then
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:55.720]  under pressure he added it Perry added it right at the last minute they held it up
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:59.240]  to a vote on Friday and then the house speaker came out who voted for it
[02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:04.320]  previously and said I'm not gonna let this come to a vote now they don't want
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:07.720]  this conversation with the feds Perry's getting ready to move up to the federal
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:10.520]  level they're getting ready to run him for president he doesn't want another
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:14.080]  special session because he's pledged not to run for president then he said well
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:17.320]  I'm gonna break my pledge maybe but I'll wait till the sessions over he does
[02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:22.360]  not want another legislative session and so we say okay you ran the clock out on
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:26.280]  us we're gonna go down there and ask other members of the Senate go to
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:29.960]  senator's offices and say we want filibusters on other bills that you
[02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:33.520]  already don't agree with to hold up the entire session because the globalists
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:36.600]  want a bunch of these bills through so they have to have a whole nother session
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:43.520]  see how Rick Perry likes that this is the a reverse of their stalling tactic now
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:48.160]  we're gonna stall them with a citizen filibuster that citizens lobbying for a
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:52.680]  filibuster and lobbying at point-blank range inside a capital I've now defined
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:58.160]  it guaranteed it's gonna be a new favorite okay let's go ahead and it was
[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:04.960]  like a George Bush land let's go ahead and go ahead and talk to Travis in
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:09.680]  Texas Travis you're on the air my friend hey Jeff Jones how's it going today oh
[02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:14.080]  I gotta go down there and face the scum again well that's what I was calling
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:17.080]  about I'm a little bit frustrated I went up there eight o'clock this morning and
[02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:20.360]  told them I was in support of the bill and now I'm hearing that it's completely
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:24.320]  changed it's not even in the best interest of what we're looking to do
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:28.720]  here well well well here's the deal we need to support the original bill that
[02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:32.360]  Simpson wrote that well there's been two the second version I've read it it's
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:37.520]  good the new one Simpsons on record and we've gone over the bill TSA tyranny
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:41.440]  withdraws support from House version of TSA anti-groping bill now they're
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:46.040]  saying that it may have been added back in we're not sure we're going down there
[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:49.360]  to investigate what's going on we're gonna get answers they're gonna try a
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:53.200]  little tricks and things and we're gonna find out what's going on we're going

[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:08.480]  absolutely anyway anyway I'd love to be there again I'm not gonna be there at
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:11.840]  four but if anybody is listening to this you need to get down there and stand up
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:15.680]  for your freedom well I'm seeing headlines like Texas Governor Rick Perry
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:23.360]  revives TSA bill LA times blog critics Fort Worth Star Telegram Amarillo TV
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:31.040]  literally 696 articles about how he is fighting the TSA he's the one killing
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:36.800]  it think of that level of deception folks the sneakiness of Al Gore's former
[02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:41.480]  campaign chairman oh yeah you didn't know that that that he tried to keep it off
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:45.560]  then when it passed he killed it then he put it back on because of pressure and
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:50.920]  then had it killed again through his minions disgusting and now state rep
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:55.400]  who'd been trying to be friendly with Perry David Simpson has had to admit
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:58.720]  that that's what's going on but things are changing we're gonna put pressure on
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:02.600]  them we're gonna get down there today everybody needs to be there and then

[02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:53.400]  Alex I met you at the talkers conference here in New York I just wanted
[02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:59.720]  a call and say I mean I literally have been saying what you have been saying
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:06.080]  for my entire life I mean one thing I don't hear it brought up too much on
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:10.280]  your show but I just feel like it's you know it's always like the family and
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:16.000]  there's there's so much abuse that goes on in families and I tried to you know
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:20.960]  kind of like wake people up to this you know for my entire life I mean we are
[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:26.160]  taught this stuff at home we're taught this stuff in in families to bow down to
[02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:32.120]  the system you know we learn to you know hit the canvas like so to speak like
[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:36.200]  you said Americans have not been free for a long time and licking the boots of
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:42.160]  government is the opposite of what this country was all about I literally have
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:46.360]  been saying it all my life people you know like like no one listened to you
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:51.280]  it's like you know they just totally ignore you it's the opposite happening
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:54.560]  Catherine it was it was good to meet you there at talkers but listen folks I
[02:43:54.560 --> 02:44:00.520]  open the phones up about specifically about the TSA and all of this think
[02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:05.600]  about how outrageous that is that Perry continues to say he's for it then quietly
[02:44:05.600 --> 02:44:09.640]  kills it in the Senate then he said oh I can't reintroduce it it comes out he's
[02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:15.240]  a liar he puts it back on then has the leader of the house kill it and bad
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:20.240]  mouth a bill that he voted for a month ago and then now they've got some
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:23.840]  resolution watered down and David Simpson says he's removing his support
[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:28.520]  for it get down to the Capitol now get down there I'll be there at four o'clock
[02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:32.920]  send it out in fact I got so busy that I never even sent it out on my Twitter I'll
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:39.960]  try to do that right now during a break Kenny in Florida you're on the air go
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:45.760]  ahead honor hey Alex this is an honor I'm 80% disabled vet and I've been
[02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:49.840]  listening to you for about four years now and day without the troops like a day
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:54.440]  without sunshine and we appreciate everything you do reason I called up
[02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:58.120]  there's a thing on YouTube called Martin Luther King why opposed the war in
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:03.400]  Vietnam and he quoted Dante and said the hottest places in hell are reserved for
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:07.680]  those who in a time of moral crisis maintain their neutrality I want to
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:11.360]  grab people and just shake them Alex it's time to wake up man and you're in
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:15.560]  my prayers and and give them hell down there at the courthouse well thank you
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:21.040]  sir what's your view on I mean this is even more evil than Bill Clinton Bill
[02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:27.120]  Clinton would lie about a bill he didn't like to get it killed Perry actually
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:31.080]  gets bills introduced like sanctuary city bans and other things because he
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:36.960]  knows in 05 he got an award from Fox for sanctuary cities and tuition free
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:41.240]  legals and so then he introduced his bills to only have his people kill them
[02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:46.800]  and we've caught him doing the same thing with the TSA bill now twice I
[02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:51.920]  mean that is a new level of deception word across roads here and it's like
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:55.600]  Ron Paul said if we'll let them stick their hands down our children's pants
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:46:02.960]  then this word across roads here brother and it's time to wake up and get
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:07.120]  out on your knees and start stalking the man upstairs and he will make things
[02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:11.480]  happen because of people like you and I make copies of your DVDs I just got me
[02:46:11.480 --> 02:46:15.880]  an enforce t-shirt and I'm proud of it buddy well God bless you sir because I
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:24.960]  am very thankful you know at one level I Kenny I get nervous because I realize
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:28.080]  so many people are listening and I know that nobody's perfect and I don't do the
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:33.560]  best job a lot of the time I try my hardest though I really do and so the
[02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:38.160]  responsibility is pretty overwhelming but at the same time the fact that from
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:43.360]  nowhere in 16 years we built a media platform that is growing exponentially
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:47.640]  that's why Google admittedly starting to censor us and block us out we've got a
[02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:51.240]  big article out at info wars dot com on that that's why it's more important than
[02:46:51.240 --> 02:46:55.520]  ever make a homemade info wars t-shirt or buy them an info wars dot com and
[02:46:55.520 --> 02:47:00.200]  support us folks are paying for info wars dot com billboards around the country
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:06.680]  thank you TV station owners are airing my films on their local broadcast TV not
[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:10.560]  just access good don't I get calls all the time asking permission just do it
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:15.240]  just don't wait just get it out there I mean my films really are waking people
[02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:22.520]  up and there's some other good ones out there as well but when you give into
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:26.880]  corruption everything collapses and slowly we've given into more and more to
[02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:30.760]  the point that Obama's launch in wars until in Congress he doesn't need their
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:36.960]  approval I mean that that's big and it's like state rep Simpson said he said
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:42.120]  why do we even have a legislature if the governor the lieutenant governor and
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:46.800]  the speaker of the house are violating the rules and blocking legislation why
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:50.320]  don't we just have three men and the feds say we don't need a state so why
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:55.320]  even have a governor because they they have to represent us they they have to
[02:47:55.320 --> 02:48:00.640]  answer to us and it's time they answer today and and they look folks we're not
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:04.800]  gonna win the war against tyranny today you win the war against tyranny by not
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:08.680]  laying down to it and we've gotten so deep in this hole it's gonna be hard to
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:14.320]  get out of it but we don't have a choice the water is pouring in here I mean it
[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:19.080]  every time I look at my children and I don't want to go down to the Capitol or
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:22.000]  I don't want to come up here at midnight and work or I don't want to bust my
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:26.560]  butt and make a film or I don't want to do a TV interview because believe me
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:31.480]  folks I don't have some ego thing that drives me in all of this maybe 15 years
[02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:36.600]  ago a little bit it was fun now it is nothing but responsibility and it's
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:42.800]  empowering I'm very alive but at the same time it's just the analogy is like
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:47.280]  a hot dog eating contest I like a hot dog maybe two hot dogs maybe three hot
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:51.440]  dogs watch these guys on hot dog eating contest they can eat a hundred and
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:56.480]  fifty 200 hot dogs and I've seen two interviews and they say yeah I look at
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:49:00.960]  a hot dog now I want to throw up but many of you have never even been
[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:05.760]  politically involved at any level eat a hot dog or two folks eat a hamburger or
[02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:11.320]  two and a hamburger eating contest you know it's crazy analogy if it's just
[02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:17.080]  that I would love to be unknown now I would love to be left alone now I would
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:20.200]  love to not have to manage people and not have to organize things because I'm
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:24.840]  not a big organizer but at the end of the day I have no future if I don't do
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:28.280]  this and folks you've got to own it you got to realize you're being enslaved
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:32.080]  there are people trying to run your life they're bad people and there's nothing
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:35.040]  creepier than a bunch of organized crooks getting together through government
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:38.960]  it's called tyranny all right let's go another phone call here let's talk to
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:44.480]  Teresa in Texas then Jim in Texas and others Teresa you're on the air Alex
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:50.200]  yes it's good to talk to you I just want to say thank God for people like you
[02:49:50.200 --> 02:49:54.600]  I'm a homemaker in Corpus Christi Texas and would I would love to be at the
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:49:58.800]  Capitol today with my homeschooled son but I can't do it but I will try to
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:04.360]  catch another one but I had an idea and that is I think we need a game plan
[02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:10.400]  when these things happen at the TSA and we see people being violated or it's
[02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:15.720]  happening to us you know just like we tell the kids stop drop and roll for a
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:20.000]  fire emergency if we could have a combined effort of we're gonna do this
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:24.600]  this and this every time we see that happen I think we could instead of
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:30.200]  standing by like we don't know what to do and we fill in videotaping it do you
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:33.640]  know what I'm saying like yeah and then they act like the authorities and they
[02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:38.600]  yell at you it's all about training you it's prisoner induction total sexual
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:46.480]  assault is what TSA stands for or you know tyrannical slave assimilation there's
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:49.920]  a lot of different terms you can use but it is happening this TSA issues
[02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:56.080]  bringing everybody together it's waking up the world it's it it's another major

[02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:37.920]  jamming Texas you're on the air thank you for holding
[02:54:37.920 --> 02:54:45.360]  Alex if you can hear me yet yes okay cool this is actually a lot bigger than
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:48.160]  what people really expected me this is kind of one of those things where the
[02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:54.880]  feds gone just a little bit too far they can't let us back them down okay and I
[02:54:54.880 --> 02:54:58.360]  disagree with the whole thing you know we don't need to say we don't need any
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:02.360]  of stuff I agree with the fact that it's just no but you're right it's about the
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:06.640]  feds getting away with bloody murder and if one state stands up they're all
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:12.160]  gonna stand up this is a lot bigger than the TSA right and then if we if one in
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:16.240]  if they push back against the states so they push back against Texas do whatever
[02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:20.320]  they feel like they're gonna do either blockade the state or whatever we gotta
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:27.360]  call the bluff we yes we have to we need to because if Texas say for instance
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:33.600]  you know asks for an amulet amicable divorce a secession then then there'll
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:37.960]  be other states to follow that in the federal government is not gonna
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:45.240]  survive this if we stand our ground I prefer personally believe we need to
[02:55:45.240 --> 02:55:51.000]  take and start over from a constitutional government but the
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:56.680]  Constitution the Bill of Rights and rebuild from there but you know my
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:00.560]  ideas are even more radical than that it's like with it with a holding
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:07.680]  corporations to the pre-frank and Franklin Delano Roosevelt restrictions
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:11.120]  you know so we don't get these well there's no doubt that that they're
[02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:13.960]  engaged in pure tyranny I hope everybody's there at four o'clock today
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:17.720]  and if you can't make it then come tonight or tomorrow what do you think of
[02:56:17.720 --> 02:56:23.440]  my citizen filibuster idea you know I hope I hope I hope you get the turn out
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:27.280]  you need I'm at work and I have 12-hour days right now so that's just not gonna
[02:56:27.280 --> 02:56:31.440]  happen for me but see that's part of it that's part of how they keep that's part
[02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:35.840]  of how they keep the average person from making these tracks by the way we've
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:38.440]  covered the government documents where they admit they're wanting to dumb
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:42.000]  people down they're admitting they want everybody to have to work so hard so you
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  can't ever do anything else they use the fact of poverty and overworking people
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:55.560]  to control them you're absolutely right and it's sickening if we just stand if
[02:56:55.560 --> 02:56:59.840]  we can get the states that want to fight this can just stand and with
[02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:05.320]  stand the onslaught so to speak until it finally comes to the point that
[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:09.000]  everybody and their brother realizes there's nothing you can do but succeed
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:13.080]  well there's something else that's happening here we're forcing Perry out
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:18.760]  in the open we're exposing the former Al Gore campaign manager and the and the
[02:57:18.760 --> 02:57:23.560]  amnesty promoter that he's introduced bills to then kill him on record his
[02:57:23.560 --> 02:57:26.960]  people kill him so that he can claim he was for it but then it never goes
[02:57:26.960 --> 02:57:32.520]  through I mean he's the new model of globalist and our new stories on
[02:57:32.520 --> 02:57:37.160]  drudgereport.com new documents prove TSA mischaracterized safety aspects of
[02:57:37.160 --> 02:57:40.600]  full-body scanners there's a flesh-eating bacteria and studies confirm
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:45.120]  the gloves and the floor thousands walking across it it's all illegal it's
[02:57:45.120 --> 02:57:49.080]  a total sickening insane power grab but if they can do this they can do anything
[02:57:49.080 --> 02:57:51.880]  I told you years ago they'd be on the streets because that was always their
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:56.000]  plan it's happening God bless you sir and I'm sorry I'm just well I want to go
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:02.040]  to I want to go to a few other people from Texas but I am just flat out of
[02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:07.640]  time here I am just flat out of time because I need to get ready for the
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:10.740]  fact that we're gonna do something we don't get a little permit and sit out
[02:58:10.740 --> 02:58:16.160]  front you know and have the media ignore us no when we march in to our house
[02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:19.560]  that we paid for with our representatives that we elected who work
[02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:23.720]  for us you don't just vote for them and then the elections over we're going in
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:28.200]  there to say look Bill of Rights Constitution why even have a house if
[02:58:28.200 --> 02:58:34.640]  if the traitorous Republican leadership is in here killing this legislation you
[02:58:34.640 --> 02:58:38.440]  get in there and you get that bill passed or you go for another special
[02:58:38.440 --> 02:58:42.240]  session we'll be right back tomorrow live oh well hold on hold on to come right
[02:58:42.240 --> 02:58:45.400]  back actually I forgot some I'm going to overdrive I forgot some it's too
[02:58:45.400 --> 02:58:54.160]  important visit GCN live comm today hundreds of nations have fallen to
[02:58:54.160 --> 02:58:58.880]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive
[02:58:58.880 --> 02:59:03.160]  history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[02:59:03.160 --> 02:59:07.120]  underneath the Americans at home I've turned members influence on our
[02:59:07.120 --> 02:59:11.320]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[02:59:11.320 --> 02:59:16.560]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:21.120]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:59:21.120 --> 02:59:25.520]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:59:25.520 --> 02:59:29.240]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[02:59:29.240 --> 02:59:33.200]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[02:59:33.200 --> 02:59:38.760]  like nobody does care right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[02:59:38.760 --> 02:59:44.440]  the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com
[02:59:44.440 --> 02:59:51.280]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:57.320]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.320 --> 03:00:20.280]  Broadcasting Network that's right we are gonna fail over and over again in the
[03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:23.560]  fight against tyranny like George Washington did but we're gonna win in
[03:00:23.560 --> 03:00:27.600]  the end resistance is victory I want to take a few final calls and this
[03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:31.240]  emergency overdrive for just the next five minutes but the main reason I
[03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:34.720]  wanted to overdrive is to let audio video internet listeners because we're not
[03:00:34.720 --> 03:00:39.320]  on AM and FM stations right now I guess some are carrying it I meant to plug
[03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:41.440]  this during the show I just forget everything because there's so much
[03:00:41.440 --> 03:00:47.600]  going on we're gonna have a blurb posted at about three o'clock at info wars
[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:58.200]  in prisonplanet in a red link that is going to have embedded on it a Justin
[03:00:58.200 --> 03:01:03.920]  TV what's the other name of the other system we use a u-stream that we found
[03:01:03.920 --> 03:01:08.400]  works even better people complain about the Justin TV ads it's a free service
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:13.680]  we're not getting that money Justin TV we're able to stream live and get it to
[03:01:13.680 --> 03:01:17.080]  you but then there's an ad I'm sorry it's what it is you got you stream the
[03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:20.800]  same way why I'm even bringing that up you go ahead and complain I'm gonna be
[03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:25.280]  down there at the Capitol we're gonna have that video up at info wars com
[03:01:25.280 --> 03:01:29.200]  with live streaming from the Capitol I don't know how well it'll work so we've
[03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:34.400]  got Quicks you stream and Justin TV three different things rigged up on the
[03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:41.800]  iPhone 4 and so we're gonna have Aaron and Rob down there with me and so they'll
[03:01:41.800 --> 03:01:45.160]  be shooting video on high quality to document what's happening to be put
[03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:49.000]  up tomorrow in the next few days but we'll also be having live streams and
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:55.080]  so there'll be a page on info wars that says live coverage of March March on
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:02:00.640]  Texas Capitol or something like that and it'll have my Twitter feed for photos
[03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:06.080]  it'll have a bunch of other things there so in case something happens we can get
[03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:12.040]  it out live so definitely be watching that starting around four o'clock as we
[03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:16.160]  walk up we'll start shooting some video and please call everybody you know even
[03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:19.240]  if you can't be there and tell them to get down to the Capitol and it don't
[03:02:19.240 --> 03:02:22.400]  always thank me and count on somebody else to do it folks you got to get down
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:25.160]  there it doesn't even mean we're gonna win this thing but we made them go in
[03:02:25.160 --> 03:02:28.760]  a special session we made them bring it back we exposed Perry's killing this
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:34.240]  behind the scenes that's a big deal because by probing the globalist you
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:37.680]  expose their operations you just lay down they're gonna roll over the top of
[03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:44.360]  you mark in Texas you're on the air thanks for holding I'll be down there
[03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:49.720]  I'm leaving Houston in a five minutes and I thought of a bunch of reasons why
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:55.960]  you know you know excuse is actually why I shouldn't you know because it's a
[03:02:55.960 --> 03:02:59.400]  two-hour drive and this and that I gotta pick my wife up at the bus stop at the
[03:02:59.400 --> 03:03:02.560]  work is that I'm saying wait a minute I can make arrangements to have her picked
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:07.640]  up anyone who doesn't get up who can get there you know physically
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:11.160]  make it there within a couple hour radius and I don't think they'd even
[03:03:11.160 --> 03:03:16.520]  deserve the freedom that you're fighting for us for even fighting a long time for
[03:03:16.520 --> 03:03:21.520]  us you know and I've done nothing people at Bunker Hill got gunned down by the
[03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:26.080]  Red Codes half of George Washington's troops I've read the French and other
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:30.640]  records of it would be marching through the snow from Ticonderoga and the and
[03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:35.040]  the British captured guns with blood in the snow you ever had your shoes
[03:03:35.040 --> 03:03:39.200]  breakdown those old-fashioned shoes of breakdown these are guys in zero
[03:03:39.200 --> 03:03:43.120]  temperatures did you know I forget the number it was something like 50 men died
[03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:49.280]  froze to death the night the night march across the frozen Delaware to go into
[03:03:49.280 --> 03:03:53.120]  Trenton New Jersey and take on the overwhelming German troops the British
[03:03:53.120 --> 03:03:58.800]  Mercs I mean the whole bunch of the men froze to death in their old-fashioned
[03:03:58.800 --> 03:04:03.120]  cloaks froze to death so that we would have a little bit of freedom we've got
[03:04:03.120 --> 03:04:07.000]  so I don't deserve any credit I'm not freezing to death I'm not walking
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:11.240]  through snow dragging giant guns behind me men through snow till their shoes
[03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:15.160]  broke off dragging the guns in it was something like a hundred miles dragging
[03:04:15.160 --> 03:04:21.200]  giant guns men dragging guns on ropes through the snow with no shoes with a
[03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:27.120]  trail of blood behind them so God bless you my friend anything else yeah I just
[03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:31.280]  wanted to say that you know I'm sure you would have been there if we were back
