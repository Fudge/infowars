[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:34.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.280 --> 00:46.280]  it is Wednesday the fifth day of December 2012 and I am your host Alex Jones we
[00:46.280 --> 00:50.160]  are going to have open phones today we don't have any guest have a bunch of
[00:50.160 --> 00:55.520]  breaking special reports we're gonna air here on day here on the show today
[00:55.520 --> 01:02.640]  obviously if you hear that my voice is deeper than normal I went out to a
[01:02.640 --> 01:07.360]  federal building in Austin Texas yesterday one of my photographers and
[01:07.360 --> 01:14.520]  researchers Molly Rogers was in and around downtown Austin taking photos of
[01:14.520 --> 01:20.880]  surveillance cameras so we have stock footage of the Big Brother control grid
[01:20.880 --> 01:27.360]  as any publication online or in print does and they came out to her on the
[01:27.360 --> 01:31.000]  sidewalk and said will arrest you you look shady it's illegal to photograph a
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.800]  federal building so I went back down there yesterday and to find parking had
[01:37.800 --> 01:43.920]  to park about a quarter mile away left the bullhorn in the car in the truck
[01:43.920 --> 01:49.560]  forgot it and so when I got there I can still scream extremely loud for about
[01:49.560 --> 01:54.280]  30 minutes I screamed at the top of my lungs a pretty eloquent breakdown and
[01:54.280 --> 01:58.720]  speech and said come out here and tell me it's illegal because you know it's not
[01:58.720 --> 02:02.920]  you know you engage in color of law criminal activity and then about 30
[02:02.920 --> 02:08.480]  minutes in we start leaving and I'll tell the story later and then we should
[02:08.480 --> 02:12.480]  have the video ready by the nightly news tonight or tomorrow who knows we've got
[02:12.480 --> 02:17.040]  so much on our plate right now but we will we will play that video here on the
[02:17.040 --> 02:20.480]  radio because it's it's got audio obviously as I give a speech to them and
[02:20.480 --> 02:28.160]  then as we're leaving security guards come out and inform us that their
[02:28.160 --> 02:34.240]  listeners and that we have every right to photograph or videotape the facility
[02:34.240 --> 02:38.200]  because this is not North Korea and they said in fact we'll open the gate up for
[02:38.200 --> 02:41.640]  you why don't you try to go into the metal detectors and talk to the federal
[02:41.640 --> 02:50.120]  police officers shall we go in there and they blow up at our cameras and then I
[02:50.120 --> 02:54.600]  tell them this isn't North Korea and explain that they'd come out and the
[02:54.600 --> 02:59.680]  federal police officer that done it to Molly was not there I said is that him
[02:59.680 --> 03:03.480]  is that him she said no and she described him and they said well we
[03:03.480 --> 03:06.400]  apologize it's not illegal we understand how that could have scared you
[03:06.400 --> 03:09.800]  because you know she came back to work and said really it's it's it's not
[03:09.800 --> 03:13.560]  illegal I didn't think it was illegal I didn't even know that was a federal
[03:13.560 --> 03:16.880]  building I was just going around downtown was sent her out there to do it but
[03:16.880 --> 03:20.560]  she said really they'd lie to me and said they'd arrest me and of course you see
[03:20.560 --> 03:23.400]  that in the news all the time where they do arrest people you see the courts
[03:23.400 --> 03:27.720]  ruling obviously that's unconstitutional but they just keep doing it and so I
[03:27.720 --> 03:30.360]  told them I said they were kind of getting our face and I said well I'm
[03:30.360 --> 03:33.840]  gonna sue you then for civil rights violation First Amendment official
[03:33.840 --> 03:38.560]  oppression and they went whoa whoa whoa whoa so we shook hands and they said
[03:38.560 --> 03:42.360]  okay here's a number for you or a place for you to file a complaint we'll try to
[03:42.360 --> 03:46.280]  find out who did it which I'm sure is just trying to get us out of there but
[03:46.280 --> 03:49.600]  I'm not just there trying to get the face of the federal government I know it's
[03:49.600 --> 03:54.240]  an incredibly criminal dangerous horrible thing that runs Al Qaeda
[03:54.240 --> 04:00.760]  publicly that's in the news today but if we let them operate like this is North
[04:00.760 --> 04:05.400]  Korea pretty soon they'll be sending us to reeducation camps if we don't cry at
[04:05.400 --> 04:09.920]  public events properly like in North Korea and and I'm not joking that's how
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.480]  tyranny works you give into it it takes you all the way it's like tying a giant
[04:15.480 --> 04:19.600]  10,000 pound lead weight to your ankle and throwing yourself into the ocean but
[04:19.600 --> 04:23.080]  the lead weight you're going to the bottom you're dead that's how tyranny
[04:23.080 --> 04:27.120]  works it's got a big weight it keeps going all the way until it hits
[04:27.120 --> 04:33.360]  resistance okay and so I don't like being the tip of the spear because they
[04:33.360 --> 04:38.840]  are dangerous but it's got to be done that's why we went down to the NSA to say
[04:38.840 --> 04:42.480]  hey it's not illegal to film here and they had to admit it hey they they detain
[04:42.480 --> 04:47.000]  and rob San Antonio Express news newspaper reporters with cameras TV
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.400]  stations they take their stuff because they don't know how to say hey don't
[04:50.400 --> 04:54.480]  you engage in criminal activity you got to put the sunglasses on like they live
[04:54.480 --> 05:00.440]  and once you can see they go I got one that can see we'll be back have you ever

[09:01.680 --> 09:09.760]  day of December 2012 and I was on mancals show this morning and during a
[09:09.760 --> 09:13.600]  break he's like man what's going on your voices are getting even deeper I was on
[09:13.600 --> 09:20.960]  there with Jesse Ventura and I'm like no my voice isn't getting deeper I hope it
[09:20.960 --> 09:25.360]  doesn't or all it won't have any voice I I yelled and screamed at the federal
[09:25.360 --> 09:28.760]  building here in Austin for about 30 minutes down a big confrontation
[09:28.760 --> 09:33.240]  yesterday and we were out till about 6 30 at night working on that we're trying
[09:33.240 --> 09:38.280]  to download the footage right now and not really edit it but cut it down some
[09:38.280 --> 09:42.560]  because it's 30 minutes long or more so we can get it on the radio it'll
[09:42.560 --> 09:46.400]  probably be on the news tonight if not it'll be on the radio tomorrow but that
[09:46.400 --> 09:49.440]  is a pretty powerful stuff and why do we go down to the federal building they
[09:49.440 --> 09:52.840]  told one of my photographers that you they would she would go to jail for
[09:52.840 --> 09:56.120]  photography of the federal building and we all know that's not true we know it's
[09:56.120 --> 10:00.840]  a fraud well at least informed people do Supreme Court just ruled last week you
[10:00.840 --> 10:05.280]  can't do that and they keep arresting people though Illinois State Court just
[10:05.280 --> 10:09.160]  ruled that it's illegal to arrest people for filming the police in public or
[10:09.160 --> 10:13.000]  government buildings the NSA's lost lawsuits over it I mean think about it
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.320]  the NSA is spying on you without warrants on record now every time they do
[10:17.320 --> 10:20.480]  it it's a felony government doesn't care they're just doing it the president
[10:20.480 --> 10:24.560]  says the military is now under NATO UN command Congress can just sit out and
[10:24.560 --> 10:29.960]  shut up in public letter statements and three different congressional hearings
[10:29.960 --> 10:35.200]  belligerence by the Joint Chiefs of Staff arrogance towards Congress and Congress
[10:35.200 --> 10:39.520]  is a bunch of criminals but they are the that is the rightful body that
[10:39.520 --> 10:43.520]  represents the people on legislative matters and on the power of the purse
[10:43.520 --> 10:48.120]  and declaration of war my point is is that you're in a lot of trouble folks
[10:48.120 --> 10:52.760]  when the feds and the local police tell you can't videotape them and it happens
[10:52.760 --> 10:57.600]  all the time you know I see videos every week where a cop pulls somebody over
[10:57.600 --> 11:01.320]  they go is that a camera you've got taping me you're going to jail that's
[11:01.320 --> 11:06.400]  illegal and they try different things they say obstruction of a police officer's
[11:06.400 --> 11:12.920]  duty they say interfering with a police officer obstruction of justice wire
[11:12.920 --> 11:17.280]  tapping and they know full well it's a fraud and let me tell you something when
[11:17.280 --> 11:21.160]  you misappropriate the law and twist it and put that into the court systems
[11:21.160 --> 11:25.680]  that's official oppression it's a civil rights violation it's a violation of the
[11:25.680 --> 11:31.040]  Constitution it's a violation of your oath and it is beyond despicable and let
[11:31.040 --> 11:33.640]  me tell you the foreign banks that run this country are trying to convert this
[11:33.640 --> 11:37.200]  nation over to a North Korea style system because they've stolen all the
[11:37.200 --> 11:42.520]  wealth they've set up the police state and they're all going to go to jail when
[11:42.520 --> 11:45.760]  this thing comes down it's designed to come down and make us all poor third
[11:45.760 --> 11:52.680]  world slaves with the mega elite living in armored gated rural communities and
[11:52.680 --> 11:58.760]  central scientific government hubs in major mega cities and that's the stated
[11:58.760 --> 12:05.840]  plan of agenda 21 and they're they're doing it and so all of you that serve
[12:05.840 --> 12:11.920]  the system need to know that you are destroying yourselves it's called
[12:11.920 --> 12:15.480]  killing yourself to live and the globalists want to get us to a point
[12:15.480 --> 12:18.640]  where we're so bankrupt so deindustrialized where our farming
[12:18.640 --> 12:23.640]  communities in our agrarian system is so defunct that we're absolutely dependent
[12:23.640 --> 12:26.480]  on them they've doubled the number of food stamps the last three and a half
[12:26.480 --> 12:31.800]  years it's set to double again you've got over a hundred million people totally
[12:31.800 --> 12:36.440]  dependent on the government one form or another this this this is the process of
[12:36.440 --> 12:43.360]  going into bondage right now and it's going to get horrible but everyone needs
[12:43.360 --> 12:47.920]  to just speak out and point out this is premeditated and yeah it's not fun to
[12:47.920 --> 12:55.360]  go confront the feds and even get going to the building that's right they opened
[12:55.360 --> 13:02.680]  the gate up and brought us in and what a story this is it was the security guards
[13:02.680 --> 13:06.360]  were listeners and they had security guard after they finally came out said
[13:06.360 --> 13:10.000]  no you got a right to filming they want to go file a complaint opens the gate
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.680]  up and we go in there and the federal police that were hiding inside went
[13:14.680 --> 13:23.480]  completely ape the wicked flea with none pursue I gotta tell you I mean you
[13:23.480 --> 13:27.360]  guys came out to a little lady and said you throw her in jail and that she looks
[13:27.360 --> 13:30.920]  shady and can be a terrorist and all the rest of it and so we went down there I
[13:30.920 --> 13:35.680]  mean just said look this isn't North Korea I mean you know you have a five
[13:35.680 --> 13:42.840]  foot four or five blue blonde you guys are telling her she's gonna go to jail
[13:42.840 --> 13:45.600]  and freak her all out and she's a terrorist I mean just come on is that
[13:45.600 --> 13:49.800]  really what you want to be you really want to play drama queen all day like
[13:49.800 --> 13:54.240]  they're real terrorists out there your bosses run the terrorist FBI deputy
[13:54.240 --> 13:59.640]  director O'Neill John O'Neill gave what London telegraph interview and a few
[13:59.640 --> 14:03.920]  others saying the government was going to stage a terrorist attack or allow
[14:03.920 --> 14:07.800]  Alcada to do it to take our liberties and attack Afghanistan I've made films
[14:07.800 --> 14:13.120]  about it it's on record any journalist listening can can pull that up and he
[14:13.120 --> 14:16.320]  still wasn't that smart though he's a smart guy in a patriot showing the whole
[14:16.320 --> 14:19.840]  federal government's not criminals but at the very top they are it's the folks
[14:19.840 --> 14:24.200]  that ran fast and furious others like that and he got given the contract that
[14:24.200 --> 14:32.960]  ended September 10th his first day on the job was September 11th this is like
[14:32.960 --> 14:39.240]  New York Times folks you can go look this up guess who had the contract Marvin
[14:39.240 --> 14:42.800]  Bush had the contract and said he was in the attack on the subway when it
[14:42.800 --> 14:46.360]  happened and it was so interesting that was actually an AP interview you can
[14:46.360 --> 14:50.440]  look it up it's also one in Guardian it was so interesting that he was in the
[14:50.440 --> 14:54.080]  subway he got it cleaned his stuff out that morning handed it over to O'Neill
[14:54.080 --> 15:02.600]  at about 8 30 in the morning and left unbelievable you cannot make that type of
[15:02.600 --> 15:07.360]  stuff up you cannot and if you're a new listener folks you can just search what
[15:07.360 --> 15:12.560]  I just said Marvin Bush had a World Trade Center security or John O'Neill
[15:12.560 --> 15:16.360]  deputy FBI director head of counterterrorism dead in the towers
[15:16.360 --> 15:20.560]  cover in New Yorker magazine even covered it and said isn't an interesting
[15:20.560 --> 15:25.920]  isn't it a coincidence isn't it a coincidence that the Bush's former
[15:25.920 --> 15:31.520]  president Bush was meeting at the car law group private shareholder meeting in
[15:31.520 --> 15:38.480]  DC a mile or two from the Pentagon when it got hit at the bin Laden table they
[15:38.480 --> 15:42.440]  even like to tell you that oh he was at the bin Laden table with the sheik
[15:42.440 --> 15:47.720]  bin Laden the head of the family and they were the only ones allowed to leave
[15:47.720 --> 15:51.080]  the country in the next three days dozens of flights that's all on record
[15:51.080 --> 15:55.760]  seat when you have a memory and I don't know football scores or you know what's
[15:55.760 --> 16:01.560]  some closer picture did in college you know I mean I mean men out there their
[16:01.560 --> 16:04.520]  favorite teams they know what all the players did their whole life they know
[16:04.520 --> 16:08.440]  their mommy and daddy's name and men are real proud of this you know that I know
[16:08.440 --> 16:13.520]  all this stuff so you have the capacity to be a winner in business a winner with
[16:13.520 --> 16:18.560]  your family a winner in life if you took all that time and energy you spent on
[16:18.560 --> 16:21.960]  sports and put it into the stock market let's say you don't want to save
[16:21.960 --> 16:26.560]  America and save freedom you just want money if you didn't spend all day
[16:26.560 --> 16:33.760]  lazily learning all about male male soap operas sports or watching action

[16:55.480 --> 16:58.440]  putting sodium fluoride in the water how they're dumbing us down what they're
[16:58.440 --> 17:01.080]  gonna do how they're gonna turn the power plants off how they're only gonna
[17:01.080 --> 17:05.640]  shut off us energy and they're now they got all the colleges getting ready to
[17:05.640 --> 17:10.320]  move and shut down the energy sector and and what an idiot you are and I'm

[17:20.160 --> 17:24.800]  science are and I'm sitting here while they just and I watch everything they
[17:24.800 --> 17:28.520]  say they do I've read stuff they wrote a hundred years ago they've done it all I
[17:28.520 --> 17:32.800]  read stuff they wrote 50 years ago they've done 70% of it I read stuff they
[17:32.800 --> 17:36.200]  said 10 years ago they've already implemented 30 40% of it I mean they're
[17:36.200 --> 17:41.000]  doing it and when they don't succeed they try try again and we've got them
[17:41.000 --> 17:44.280]  held back seven eight nine ten years depending on which actuary you look at
[17:44.280 --> 17:47.840]  and the globalist give perspective reports on that their war against humanity
[17:47.840 --> 17:51.480]  their war against the family the war against have you turned on the sitcoms

[18:08.960 --> 18:12.200]  car and order you to stop walk up to you in a store tell you you got too many
[18:12.200 --> 18:18.400]  kids they're just yes man boy they're inch programmed house slaves of the new
[18:18.400 --> 18:23.400]  world order oh you don't think they just had black women who were house slaves
[18:23.400 --> 18:27.480]  that comes from Rome you bring the women in the house keep the men out there you
[18:27.480 --> 18:33.080]  beat them and you torture him and you do you don't let them learn how to talk you
[18:33.080 --> 18:36.760]  take the women and you set them up as the bosses and boy they're going to carry
[18:36.760 --> 18:42.320]  it out we're following a 2,000 year old Roman slave manual literally they've
[18:42.320 --> 18:46.800]  got university studies on that I've discovered from the 70s did you know
[18:46.800 --> 18:50.640]  the slave manuals in the Americas from the Caribbean sugarcane fields to the
[18:50.640 --> 18:57.240]  cotton fields of Georgia were retranslated Roman slave manuals from
[18:57.240 --> 19:04.000]  Latin had to learn about the real world see I know about slave manuals I don't

[19:07.160 --> 19:10.680]  around killing each other I could care less about that I've been around some
[19:10.680 --> 19:14.840]  of these professional athletes and they are so arrogant and on power trips

[19:23.640 --> 19:27.360]  that mean and I've got trouble dealing with their false reality because it is

[19:33.600 --> 19:37.160]  even care about combing my hair putting makeup on this is it I've got on my head

[24:12.160 --> 24:16.040]  central in full or tonightly news back Sundays 4 to 6 with a live radio show
[24:16.040 --> 24:24.120]  the live this Sunday okay wow I mentioned this report yesterday Al Qaeda link
[24:24.120 --> 24:30.120]  grouped Syrian rebels once denied now key to anti Assad victories and it goes on
[24:30.120 --> 24:34.720]  to admit that it's real Al Qaeda and they say that they are gonna attack
[24:34.720 --> 24:39.640]  America with missiles that they've been given by America after they bring down
[24:39.640 --> 24:43.440]  Assad and that's part of the plan they'll be let in they'll blow up
[24:43.440 --> 24:47.840]  aircraft and the TSA will show up on highways everywhere and grope your
[24:47.840 --> 24:51.080]  wife and beat the living daylights out of you and drag you to a FEMA camp that's
[24:51.080 --> 24:53.920]  the next phase I told you 10 years ago they'd be on the highways everywhere
[24:53.920 --> 24:57.240]  told you they'd be in the malls because they said they would so I'm not just
[24:57.240 --> 25:00.840]  saying this is gonna happen I really believe it if I say something and I'm
[25:00.840 --> 25:05.400]  and it's not satire which I'll tell you when it satire occasionally I mean I
[25:05.400 --> 25:10.080]  really am saying this is gonna happen okay but let's get into Bob Costas here
[25:10.080 --> 25:15.240]  Bob Costas won't back down from anti gun remarks that's out of market watch and
[25:15.240 --> 25:22.480]  the Wall Street Journal he says that he will not back off and boy we have a
[25:22.480 --> 25:27.720]  clip of him on NBC that is about seven eight minutes long we're gonna play some
[25:27.720 --> 25:34.560]  excerpts it is unbelievable see he's got the backing of the NFL and NBC and he
[25:34.560 --> 25:38.280]  says you know we shouldn't be anti gun during the NFL we understand cuz like
[25:38.280 --> 25:45.240]  80% of NFL players we estimate are probably gun owners and he goes on Costas
[25:45.240 --> 25:49.320]  it doesn't back down from gun comments that's right blame the second amendment
[25:49.320 --> 25:54.080]  not the thug culture in the NFL not the spoiled brat steroid culture I mean I
[25:54.080 --> 25:59.160]  look at that guy he looks like he has the chin of somebody who's taken gallons
[25:59.160 --> 26:03.760]  of growth hormone oh but I bet we'll never hear the autopsy I guaranteed he
[26:03.760 --> 26:06.560]  was seeing a psychologist you they said he was on painkillers and other
[26:06.560 --> 26:10.760]  prescription drugs guaranteed on serotonin reuptake inhibitor prozac class
[26:10.760 --> 26:15.880]  they always are it always comes out later a year later so he fires back at
[26:15.880 --> 26:20.040]  his critics we're gonna be playing a disgusting clip of that in a moment and
[26:20.040 --> 26:29.000]  an amazing video I saw from a YouTube channel Mr. Colin Norr and it's a Bob
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.920]  Costas gun control speech response one minute 32 seconds very eloquent that's
[26:33.920 --> 26:39.840]  coming up in the next segment but right now first off he says it's disproportionate
[26:39.840 --> 26:44.960]  that's 65 out of 80 cults players he talked to own guns number one that's
[26:44.960 --> 26:48.600]  about the national average it's a little over 60% in the country owned guns
[26:48.600 --> 26:54.000]  punk it's I say 150 million dollars that was a number five six years ago it's
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.360]  more like a hundred and seventy million people own guns okay or a hundred most
[27:00.360 --> 27:05.840]  households don't have firearms it's closer to 70% and they have just
[27:05.840 --> 27:09.200]  department numbers that say it's over 55 but but our intel is a lot of folks
[27:09.200 --> 27:16.000]  just are quiet about it now rich people or wealthy high-profile folks they've
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.520]  pretty much all got guns or they've got bodyguards if you don't have guns and
[27:20.520 --> 27:25.280]  you are known to have tens of millions of dollars you better have guns or you're
[27:25.280 --> 27:30.400]  gonna be robbed okay you add to that there is some thug culture tough guy stuff
[27:30.400 --> 27:34.640]  going on Costas says me 25 year olds don't need guns
[27:34.640 --> 27:39.480]  well well you can join the military at 18 go kill people I a lot of family I
[27:39.480 --> 27:45.160]  know you do that joined you know in World War two when they were 15 16 do they
[27:45.160 --> 27:50.160]  can a it's all about getting people to grow up early and being around guns I
[27:50.160 --> 27:54.360]  mean how many military we have that have guns at 18 much less 25 how many
[27:54.360 --> 27:58.640]  police are 25 years old a lot oh you're gonna have trouble you're gonna have
[27:58.640 --> 28:02.520]  trouble period so don't you take my rights because there's people that have
[28:02.520 --> 28:06.600]  bad behavior out there that's how the Soviet Union worked if somebody on your
[28:06.600 --> 28:11.320]  street did something bad they'd randomly shoot three or four people the Nazis did
[28:11.320 --> 28:15.800]  that too in occupied areas you shot an SS officer they kill 100 people shot a
[28:15.800 --> 28:22.440]  regular German soldier they killed in somebody on a street killed somebody they
[28:22.440 --> 28:28.640]  would burn the whole street down or bring in bulldozers and that's how this
[28:28.640 --> 28:32.440]  works this is pure authoritarianism oh there's criminals with guns we're gonna
[28:32.440 --> 28:36.320]  take yours how's that sound let's let's well let's just go to breaks we have a
[28:36.320 --> 28:40.240]  long segment to play this to come back and analyze this Costas clip he said
[28:40.240 --> 28:45.040]  even of all those guns were obtained legally you can't have 65 guys in their
[28:45.040 --> 28:50.640]  20s and 30s aggressive young men subject to impulses without something bad
[28:50.640 --> 28:54.280]  happening really I've been super aggressive my whole life and you had
[28:54.280 --> 28:58.520]  guns everywhere never thought if I was arguing with my girlfriend or my wife
[28:58.520 --> 29:02.160]  and I had girlfriends before my wife my experience is it's usually women that
[29:02.160 --> 29:05.360]  start punching your wherever you know if there's an argument or you say you're
[29:05.360 --> 29:09.440]  leaving I mean we've all been through this and slap and they hit you or they
[29:09.440 --> 29:13.120]  throw something at you I mean I never thought about I just like I'm out of
[29:13.120 --> 29:16.240]  here or if they're jumping on you slam them down on the bed you know and say
[29:16.240 --> 29:23.520]  stop it but the point is that that now would never think of that what has
[29:23.520 --> 29:29.480]  people have breaks his steroids and pain pills and antidepressants I mean I
[29:29.480 --> 29:33.320]  look at those NFL guys when they're out there playing and they look like space
[29:33.320 --> 29:36.880]  aliens white black Hispanic you name it doesn't matter they look totally screwed
[29:36.880 --> 29:41.160]  up they're obviously on steroids and growth hormone and a bunch of other
[29:41.160 --> 29:45.680]  exotic stuff out of their minds you know that mother on Prozac
[29:45.680 --> 29:51.240]  brown or little children do we get a band bath tubs we're on the March the
[29:51.240 --> 29:58.360]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:40.720 --> 33:45.840]  coming up after I get into Bob Costas and he is savage demonization of the
[33:45.840 --> 33:50.200]  Second Amendment and the fact that he now is doubled and tripled down we're
[33:50.200 --> 33:53.960]  gonna play that video and audio here in a moment and then get into a powerful
[33:53.960 --> 33:57.920]  short response that I saw posted on YouTube and before we get into all the
[33:57.920 --> 34:00.920]  other geopolitical news I'm gonna cover a lot of news this hour than open phones
[34:00.920 --> 34:07.960]  the next two hours as well as news I was just I saw the news report I read it
[34:07.960 --> 34:12.360]  and then I during the break I watched it out of Chicago and when I opened the
[34:12.360 --> 34:16.360]  phones up I want to hear from folks in Chicago specifically this guy had a
[34:16.360 --> 34:21.080]  sweet little bull terrier puppy the police came to the guy's house to give
[34:21.080 --> 34:27.160]  him a ticket the dog walked out they just walked out didn't growl wagging his tail
[34:27.160 --> 34:30.640]  I've seen videos like this where a lab gets out of a car wagging its tail and
[34:30.640 --> 34:34.360]  the cop shoots it I mean obviously if it's a big mean dog running up growling
[34:34.360 --> 34:40.000]  I could see you shooting him in fact I would but all the time little dogs or a
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.280]  lab there's that famous video where they're you know giving the guy a ticket
[34:45.280 --> 34:51.440]  the cop searching the car the golden lab jumps out and is clearly wagging its tail
[34:51.440 --> 34:54.800]  and you know the dog wants to go running around hunting or something and I mean
[34:54.800 --> 34:59.480]  labs don't are the sweetest dogs around and the cop just kills it and I see this
[34:59.480 --> 35:05.280]  all the time but what's amazing is that Chicago police came back and got in the
[35:05.280 --> 35:11.040]  guy's face and said you shouldn't have called the media and this is like a
[35:11.040 --> 35:15.320]  well-spoken you know fella too on top of it I mean it's bad enough when the police
[35:15.320 --> 35:19.680]  are oppressing thugs because they think they can get away with it this is what
[35:19.680 --> 35:23.720]  happened to our reporter she's downtown taking photos last week doesn't even know
[35:23.720 --> 35:26.960]  that's a federal building right there because it's not marked down by the
[35:26.960 --> 35:31.320]  Capitol she's taking foes the Capitol and all the sudden the guy comes out with
[35:31.320 --> 35:36.160]  a badge and a suit and a tile you know dressed like men in black and says you
[35:36.160 --> 35:39.960]  look shady you can be a terrorist I could arrest you I could arrest you for you
[35:39.960 --> 35:43.280]  know for terrorism it's illegal to photograph a federal building and she
[35:43.280 --> 35:47.680]  came back freaked out and I said it is not illegal Molly Molly Rogers I said
[35:47.680 --> 35:50.160]  let me go show you they just had a Supreme Court ruling a few days ago and
[35:50.160 --> 35:53.720]  I showed her that and she said wow I can't believe they'd say it's illegal
[35:53.720 --> 35:58.360]  that I could go to jail and it's not and I'm go yeah I know that's scary isn't it
[35:58.360 --> 36:03.720]  it's a dangerous government this is a mafia gangster government and a lot of
[36:03.720 --> 36:07.080]  police departments aren't like that and and you know because they've got they
[36:07.080 --> 36:11.000]  come you know from from areas that support and protect the Bill rights
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.400]  Constitution that's that good leadership you normally either have a good
[36:14.400 --> 36:18.720]  history in a department or a bad history well Chicago is famous for a very
[36:18.720 --> 36:22.760]  corrupt police I mean that's not debated same thing with New York City you
[36:22.760 --> 36:28.440]  know we've had Serpa Co on many times and just to come to somebody's house and
[36:28.440 --> 36:32.440]  do that is amazing so we're gonna play that newscast and analyze it in fact
[36:32.440 --> 36:36.440]  guys I have the local news print out on that we but we print me that particular
[36:36.440 --> 36:40.280]  newscast print up so I can plug the station and the rest of it thank you
[36:40.280 --> 36:43.160]  because that's coming up here in a few minutes I'm gonna get into the Bob Costa
[36:43.160 --> 36:50.400]  situation here in a moment you know I print over 110,000 of Info Wars magazines
[36:50.400 --> 36:59.160]  and what happened is the the magazines we held back sold out in one day more
[36:59.160 --> 37:03.320]  than 30,000 held back sold out and it usually takes the three different
[37:03.320 --> 37:07.560]  distributors we have in in from Austin to San Antonio usually takes them about
[37:07.560 --> 37:16.120]  four days to to distribute 70,000 I mean they're everywhere and color lossy
[37:16.120 --> 37:21.600]  magazine it's an outreach we do free that's why we sell them at cost to you
[37:21.600 --> 37:24.120]  so you can give them to people but we got to pay the shipping and you know for
[37:24.120 --> 37:27.200]  the printing and all that and the graphics and the rest of it and and the
[37:27.200 --> 37:32.560]  reports money goes into it well I ended up it's kind of good this happened
[37:32.560 --> 37:35.880]  because I snap food I kept saying well pull this this route pull that
[37:35.880 --> 37:39.040]  distributor and they're like well this distributor last Friday's already

[37:45.680 --> 37:52.480]  additional 10,000 so this will be like only putting 50,000 on the street and
[37:52.480 --> 38:00.480]  having close to 50,000 actually sold that's good now you can get these in

[41:13.880 --> 41:16.520]  kind of working it out here I went and screamed at the federal building as I
[41:16.520 --> 41:21.120]  said because they told a reporter they can't take photographs in America and
[41:21.120 --> 41:26.200]  so I went and screamed at him for a while and then security guards came out
[41:26.200 --> 41:30.720]  and said hey we're listeners of the show you have a right to go file a complaint
[41:30.720 --> 41:34.800]  here at the gate I said you're gonna get in trouble and he goes nope it's my job
[41:34.800 --> 41:38.520]  it's your right going there and follow complaint so I went in there and he's
[41:38.520 --> 41:46.520]  like entering a beehive anyways but they're not all bad guys I mean it's
[41:46.520 --> 41:50.560]  federal marshals well one federal Marshall that sent me a bunch of
[41:50.560 --> 41:54.840]  unclassified stuff it wasn't restricted but not for the general public you know
[41:54.840 --> 41:57.800]  the Mayak Homeland Security report stuff like that that was state police with a
[41:57.800 --> 42:01.240]  Mayak report where they say veterans of the number one terror group and gun
[42:01.240 --> 42:06.680]  owners are evil and all those other traitorous stuff okay speaking of gun
[42:06.680 --> 42:12.000]  owners are evil here it is Bob Costas won't back down from anti-gun remarks
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.040]  Wall Street Journal here is the Daily Herald Costas doesn't back down from
[42:17.040 --> 42:22.680]  gun agenda comments Bob Costas fires back at his critics it's just totally
[42:22.680 --> 42:27.240]  disgusting and he doubled and tripled down blaming the Second Amendment and
[42:27.240 --> 42:33.240]  basically said men can't be trusted with guns and really the implication is
[42:33.240 --> 42:37.880]  because most NFL athletes are black is that blacks can't be trusted with guns
[42:37.880 --> 42:43.240]  and then you've got I mean that's really what he's saying and then you've got the
[42:43.240 --> 42:50.560]  you've got the black sports writer for Fox Sports saying the KKK wants guns
[42:50.560 --> 42:55.680]  legal so blacks kill themselves and I mean get he's saying blacks can't own
[42:55.680 --> 43:01.320]  guns I mean these people are acting like black people are just did you know
[43:01.320 --> 43:05.880]  just just can't be trusted with anything and that's the attitude of the
[43:05.880 --> 43:09.720]  left we're gonna put you in compact cities we're gonna break up your
[43:09.720 --> 43:13.400]  families we're gonna pay the women for 50 years not have men in the house we're
[43:13.400 --> 43:16.960]  gonna wonder why you go from 11% illegitimate seat over 90% we're gonna
[43:16.960 --> 43:22.520]  wonder why more than 10% of the black population is in prison and what is it
[43:22.520 --> 43:26.960]  close to 90% have felony records I mean that it's just unbelievable and then you
[43:26.960 --> 43:31.400]  send them it's happened to white kids Hispanic as well to the colleges of
[43:31.400 --> 43:37.040]  crime where that's it's like hunting it's like Comanche Indians raiding other
[43:37.040 --> 43:40.360]  Indians that's them you know the manly thing is to go out and rob liquor
[43:40.360 --> 43:45.680]  stores and the rap music put out by MTV I mean I've talked to high-level folks
[43:45.680 --> 43:50.560]  at MTV I'm just gonna leave it at that boy this is big in 1996 or so and they're
[43:50.560 --> 43:55.280]  telling people we're now gonna put out gangster death rap cop killer rap we're
[43:55.280 --> 43:58.160]  gonna kill rock and roll and all the rest of the music because this is the
[43:58.160 --> 44:03.080]  message that the establishment wants they force fed that to destroy the
[44:03.080 --> 44:07.200]  entire culture a lot of people say oh good I'm racist destroy the black people
[44:07.200 --> 44:10.280]  sell the drugs in their neighborhood it's like the godfather line which is
[44:10.280 --> 44:15.680]  very accurate about I don't want it sold to kids keep it with the colored
[44:15.680 --> 44:21.840]  people their animals anyways let them lose their souls that is the racist
[44:21.840 --> 44:27.840]  attitude that's going on but folks that's a no pun intended black hole to
[44:27.840 --> 44:34.320]  suck everyone into it okay that is what it is it's so dehumanized the
[44:34.320 --> 44:38.000]  globalist people say I'll kill them Arabs just nuke their whole area good I'm
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.400]  glad we've got al-Qaeda over there killing them as I've heard that so what
[44:41.400 --> 44:45.360]  just let them kill each other now we're using al-Qaeda big deal Alex well they're
[44:45.360 --> 44:49.480]  using al-Qaeda to take my rights to the globalist hate the American people
[44:49.480 --> 44:52.880]  because we have a history of liberty and fighting back more than anybody they
[44:52.880 --> 44:57.600]  hate us a lot more than the Arabs so you're like I let the blacks die kill
[44:57.600 --> 45:03.840]  each other look the Arabs kill each other and you know Roscoe Pico train
[45:03.840 --> 45:08.800]  boss hoggy there's all these people that think they're part of the power
[45:08.800 --> 45:12.200]  structure who aren't look you can't do bad stuff to other people and not have
[45:12.200 --> 45:18.720]  it come back on you okay I mean it is just unbelievable and here's what's
[45:18.720 --> 45:21.600]  happening there is a collective consciousness there's a collective
[45:21.600 --> 45:25.800]  it's been scientifically proven with computer breakdowns six cents has been
[45:25.800 --> 45:28.640]  proven they don't know really how it works but it's the same way I believe
[45:28.640 --> 45:32.280]  fish and birds and we were even more advanced know when a tornado is coming
[45:32.280 --> 45:38.440]  know when the cold front's coming to fly south it's why it's been proven because
[45:38.440 --> 45:41.040]  that's why we used to go down to hamburgers key and beliefs because we
[45:41.040 --> 45:43.800]  had friends that were microbiologists with government grants who lived on
[45:43.800 --> 45:48.640]  hamburgers key so my parents will go a lot more than I did and they were studying
[45:48.640 --> 45:52.320]  lobsters and groupers and things but it's now been proven off that 30-year
[45:52.320 --> 45:58.760]  research that that lobsters a half a day before a big storm hits in the coral
[45:58.760 --> 46:03.000]  that beats into death they that's how ancient natives knew that when a
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.800]  hurricane was coming before the wind was even blowing it was blue skies a half
[46:07.800 --> 46:13.560]  day a day sometimes two days before the natives say when the when the lobsters
[46:13.560 --> 46:16.800]  come out of their holes and walk out into the underwater sand dunes a
[46:16.800 --> 46:22.360]  hurricane's coming and it turns out all ancient cultures that lived in Pacific
[46:22.360 --> 46:27.680]  areas or tropical areas in their own translations say when the lobsters walk
[46:27.680 --> 46:36.520]  or when the crabs leave their holes and go out into the deeper water I mean how
[46:36.520 --> 46:41.280]  do they know that the brain folks is an incredible computer and it's been proven
[46:41.280 --> 46:46.880]  humans that guys type in you know studies prove our birds and fish but it's
[46:46.880 --> 46:54.040]  also humans birds and fish have have magnetic sensor cells and they've proven
[46:54.040 --> 46:57.240]  humans have a sixth sense you know what somebody's looking at you I can't tell
[46:57.240 --> 47:00.720]  you how many times I've been on our family ranch it doesn't have a lot of
[47:00.720 --> 47:06.840]  poachers on it it's big and we've had it since the 1830s and I'm walking through
[47:06.840 --> 47:11.440]  total woods you know a mile from any people and I'm walking the woods and I
[47:11.440 --> 47:15.400]  feel somebody looking at me and I feel it and I walk through a glade through an
[47:15.400 --> 47:19.800]  opening and somebody's like oh am I not supposed to be over here and a guy's up
[47:19.800 --> 47:25.720]  in a up in a tree stand I mean you know the guy had a rifle out and was sitting
[47:25.720 --> 47:29.360]  there like an idiot only look at that guy with the scope I felt those crosshairs
[47:29.360 --> 47:34.320]  on the back of my head one time I was down in Waco protect protesting the
[47:34.320 --> 47:37.040]  Ku Klux Klan we got that video somewhere around here a little bit of it's on the
[47:37.040 --> 47:39.720]  internet Mike Hansen's got the whole thing I know he doesn't might be put
[47:39.720 --> 47:44.120]  that up on YouTube please I know folks listen he has the Mike Hansen channel
[47:44.120 --> 47:50.240]  on YouTube and there's like a parking garage 500 yards away I just kept
[47:50.240 --> 47:54.240]  feeling something I'm protesting the Klan and they're saying my second
[47:54.240 --> 47:57.000]  amendment means I have the right to kill this guy it later came out the guy was a
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.600]  Fed I mean I knew that that's what it demonize the second amendment is have
[47:59.600 --> 48:01.920]  the Klan go around and promote it when they're actually the ones that were
[48:01.920 --> 48:08.880]  against it and I'm sitting there and I just feel it and I look up and I
[48:08.880 --> 48:12.240]  couldn't even see it 500 yards in the parking garage the cops with sniper
[48:12.240 --> 48:17.680]  rifles I just walk towards it and there were the cops as I walked up and Mike's
[48:17.680 --> 48:23.880]  with me he's got with the gun on me and I went over to the police and I said
[48:23.880 --> 48:27.480]  something and they said get out of here Jones and it turned out they knew the
[48:27.480 --> 48:32.120]  Klan were feds and they had called the Klan out to support the branch
[48:32.120 --> 48:34.960]  Davidians who didn't want them about half the Davidians were Hispanic or
[48:34.960 --> 48:38.400]  black just to demonize the Davidians and the cops were all in on it the
[48:38.400 --> 48:41.720]  Sheriff's Department the McClellan County Sheriff's Department I mean that is
[48:41.720 --> 48:48.760]  the dirtiness of this country that is how dirty dirty dirty and I was looking
[48:48.760 --> 48:56.720]  and the cops had their guns on us the protesters and not on the Klan and I was
[48:56.720 --> 48:59.320]  wearing a t-shirt and blue jeans but we're like I had some backpacking was
[48:59.320 --> 49:03.160]  suspicious they knew I was in McClellan County that's the county and we had just
[49:03.160 --> 49:09.280]  built a memorial church for all those that died there that's America ladies
[49:09.280 --> 49:15.400]  and gentlemen that's America that's the kind of stuff that goes on and I was
[49:15.400 --> 49:21.000]  getting off of this the point is there's a sixth sense and collectively they've
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.560]  pumped the image through the media and the culture that we're animals were
[49:23.560 --> 49:27.520]  ugly we're bad we need to die there needs to be a bio weapon release the
[49:27.520 --> 49:32.400]  world's be better off without humans they've sold that idea so that we
[49:32.400 --> 49:37.080]  collectively download that and decide we're failures so that we'll go out and
[49:37.080 --> 49:42.640]  be failures and this isn't metaphysical like it's some magic thing like the
[49:42.640 --> 49:47.240]  secret you say it'll happen it will you say it'll happen you start believing it
[49:47.240 --> 49:51.160]  will happen you will take actions that will make it happen not it just appears
[49:51.160 --> 49:55.720]  like a genie gave it to you if it's possible if it's we're made the image
[49:55.720 --> 49:59.160]  of the Creator of the universe folks we are creators we're the little creators
[49:59.160 --> 50:05.240]  but look what we've built and the devil and his fallen angels they are not
[50:05.240 --> 50:09.600]  creators they have to manipulate us to build things they want and they want to
[50:09.600 --> 50:12.560]  play God and even if you don't believe in all that the elite believe in it so
[50:12.560 --> 50:17.080]  they're manifesting that you notice revelations is starting to unfold with
[50:17.080 --> 50:20.040]  the chips and the big brother and all the rest of it and believe me folks you're
[50:20.040 --> 50:25.200]  not going to get raptured out of this that's a distortion and so you better
[50:25.200 --> 50:28.080]  make sure you get your soul right you're on the right side of this because
[50:28.080 --> 50:30.640]  that's all that matters no matter what happens to your body folks you're gonna
[50:30.640 --> 50:36.000]  die anyways you've got to step across the fear line into the empowerment area
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.320]  and and and realize that we all collectively are wishing for our own
[50:40.320 --> 50:44.480]  destruction right now at some level we all hate ourselves because we're not
[50:44.480 --> 50:49.520]  righteous we have become degenerate I'll get into Bob Bob Costa speaking of
[50:49.520 --> 50:54.120]  degenerate it is degenerate to blame law-abiding citizens or what a bunch of

[54:56.000 --> 54:59.280]  gonna be premiering an audio video here that breaks down the fact that it's an
[54:59.280 --> 55:04.240]  admitted fraud with Jakari Jackson and Melissa Melton and we've got a bunch of
[55:04.240 --> 55:07.120]  other reports we're gonna be premiering and I will give the phone number out
[55:07.120 --> 55:11.480]  starting in the next hour to get your take on all this but Bob Costas says
[55:11.480 --> 55:16.400]  he's not apologizing he's sorry he used the NFL to do it but now he's gonna go
[55:16.400 --> 55:22.560]  grandstand say you know what you don't have a right to own guns okay and of
[55:22.560 --> 55:27.320]  course that little scumbag you know has bodyguards and also has guns and he's
[55:27.320 --> 55:33.200]  saying NFL players in their 20s and 30s are stupid and cannot be trusted let's
[55:33.200 --> 55:37.880]  go ahead and play this clip Tony Dungey suspected people in all the sports on
[55:37.880 --> 55:41.720]  our program on Sunday night said that one year when he coached the Colts he
[55:41.720 --> 55:45.640]  had 80 players before they cut the roster down 80 players in training camp
[55:45.640 --> 55:51.920]  he said how many of you guys own a gun and roughly 65 hands went up even if
[55:51.920 --> 55:58.120]  all those guns were obtained legally you can't have 65 guys in their 20s and
[55:58.120 --> 56:04.080]  30s aggressive young men subject to impulses without something bad happening
[56:04.080 --> 56:07.760]  and I posed this question didn't have time to pose it on Sunday night but I'll
[56:07.760 --> 56:13.360]  pose it here give me one example of an athlete I know it's happened in society
[56:13.360 --> 56:18.340]  but give me one example of a professional athlete who by virtue of his
[56:18.340 --> 56:23.680]  having a gun took a dangerous situation and turned it around for the better I
[56:23.680 --> 56:28.800]  can't think of a single one that's pure ball right there dozens we need to go
[56:28.800 --> 56:31.840]  look that up because I've seen cases where people tried to rob professional
[56:31.840 --> 56:35.880]  athletes and they've protected themselves not just in football but in golf
[56:35.880 --> 56:41.280]  basketball I remember cases of that so so their idea is of course the real FBI
[56:41.280 --> 56:47.280]  statistics are for every crime where a gun is used it's more than 14 times some
[56:47.280 --> 56:50.760]  statistics over 20 that it's used to frustrate crime everybody knows lower
[56:50.760 --> 56:58.300]  crime rates more guns it's so simple you have less home invasions in areas the
[56:58.300 --> 57:03.600]  less gun laws the less home invasions Kennesaw Georgia made it the law decades
[57:03.600 --> 57:07.920]  ago you had to own guns the cyber of Atlanta they had a crime wave and their
[57:07.920 --> 57:12.680]  crime dropped by 87% in one year that's just department numbers you can pull
[57:12.680 --> 57:18.040]  those up there's been documentaries made about it but this idea and they go on
[57:18.040 --> 57:22.600]  from there it goes on and on it's like a seven eight minute clip we'll play some
[57:22.600 --> 57:25.360]  more of it coming up in the next hour but I want to go to break with this clip
[57:25.360 --> 57:32.000]  Bob Costas gun control speech response this is from a just a wise man on
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.120]  YouTube here it is as far as I'm concerned there is no current gun culture
[57:36.120 --> 57:40.080]  America's gun culture began at its inception America's gun culture will
[57:40.080 --> 57:43.560]  ensure more and more that the woman alone at home with her kid can protect
[57:43.560 --> 57:47.180]  ourselves when three armed men arrive at her back door and attempted mass
[57:47.180 --> 57:50.560]  shootings were no longer any countless lives lost where the husband and father
[57:50.560 --> 57:53.880]  can come home to his family after an attempted armed robbery hang on to give
[57:53.880 --> 57:57.680]  people a fighting chance on a world where heroes no respecter of man obeys no
[57:57.680 --> 58:02.320]  rules and whose appearance cannot be determined with any precision only that
[58:02.320 --> 58:05.600]  its appearance will definitely be made at some point in the coming days evil
[58:05.600 --> 58:09.320]  will be overlooked as too easy an explanation for why Javon Belcher did
[58:09.320 --> 58:12.520]  what he did but here's what I believe you take away guns from American history
[58:12.520 --> 58:16.080]  and there is no America there is no platform for Bob Costa to share his
[58:16.080 --> 58:19.720]  opinion on national television take away guns and you take away people's ability
[58:19.720 --> 58:22.920]  to protect themselves you take away people's ability to protect themselves
[58:22.920 --> 58:26.280]  in our world where evil does everything he can to the privacy of life you take
[58:26.280 --> 58:29.840]  away our right to life in the history of man and gun the gun has remained
[58:29.840 --> 58:33.920]  constant always at the mercy of man's influence to launch his project out at
[58:33.920 --> 58:37.080]  an intended target and as far as history is concerned man has always determined
[58:37.080 --> 58:40.680]  the target whether lawfully alright we're going to break we'll play the rest of
[58:40.680 --> 58:46.560]  this coming up second hour stay with us GCN the Genesis communications radio

[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:33.440]  Alex Jones all right my friends another hour of worldwide liberty as we wage
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:38.560]  war on corruption as we crash through the lies and disinformation as much
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.600]  tyranny is taking place in this world you do not want to miss a single
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:49.400]  broadcast or segment of this radio show because when we do confront tyranny when
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:54.240]  we do stand up against corruption it dissipates but when we roll over like a
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:59.760]  bunch of sheep to wolves our society will go to hell in a handbasket and the
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.760]  globalists want us to be a basket case society so we can be sent to hell in a
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:10.640]  handbasket all right if you just tuned in Bob Costas went on the news last
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.080]  night where play that clip again in a moment and says he does not back down
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:19.800]  from gun comments that's daily Harold Wall Street Journal Bob Costas won't
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:26.360]  back down from anti-gun remarks and he went on to imply people are stupid you
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.680]  know that the people are too stupid to own guns people don't know what he meant
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:34.400]  but he apologized for doing it during the NFL so here he is saying you shouldn't
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:39.360]  be able to own guns basically and endorsing the Fox sports writer who I
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:45.520]  played clips of yesterday saying quote the NFL and people that support the
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:51.720]  Second Amendment quote are the new KKK and a racist I mean it's like saying you
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.800]  know I like a steak instead of chicken oh that's racist oh I don't want the TSA
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.600]  to stick their hands to my pants oh that's racist oh I think you know what I
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.000]  like Bermuda grass instead of St. Augustine oh that's racist you know I
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.160]  think I want to have brown floors instead of white floors I think that's
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.400]  racist you know I like marble countertops that a stainless steel I think
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.360]  that's racist you know I tend to like coke over Pepsi I think that's racist you
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.560]  know I tend to like a Dosecki's beer over Budweiser I think that's racist you
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:22.280]  know I tend to like the summertime people say they don't like to eat I tend to
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:26.600]  like it I think that's racist I mean basically if you have any view opinion
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.200]  it's just you're a racist and and the people say it and stand back get ready
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.320]  for you to fall over and it's you know I government-run health care hardball
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.720]  Chris Matthews slimeball you're a racist we've played those clips you don't
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.440]  like big government you're a racist you're a racist you're a racist I mean it's
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.160]  just but you know the good news is the ADL does this if you don't like the
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.840]  police state if you don't like the New World Order if you don't like big
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.600]  brother if you don't like open borders because people come in and get free
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:56.440]  welfare and we're going bankrupt you're a racist and they say you're anti-semitic
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.640]  they lost a lawsuit where some theater chain owner was suing somebody over a
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:05.360]  contract and they just sued him and said he was or they came out and said he was
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:12.840]  a racist anti-semitic so he sued them in one I told the ADL once I was gonna
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.960]  sue them and they they removed something out of an article because it just
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:21.760]  wasn't true I mean you know I'm not a litigious angry aggressive person just
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:27.320]  out of the blue when Bob Costas comes out and says gun owners and guns are to
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:32.440]  blame for things in the corrupt NFL culture and then and and now comes out
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:36.280]  and says you can't trust men in their 20s and 30s to own guns I mean that's a
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:41.400]  quote here this is an attack on everyone if folks if they get the guns
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.720]  everything goes if they get the first amendment it all goes and they federalized
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:49.640]  the churches totally violates the first amendment the churches opted into it
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.360]  through fraud now they're forcing churches to do it that's how it always
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:56.000]  starts first it's voluntary then it's mandatory because they've got dumbed down
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.560]  enforcers that will go seize churches that aren't 501 C3 I mean this is
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:07.480]  outrageous what's going on and it's not my opinion there they're only getting
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:10.520]  away with this because of a sea of ignorance so we're gonna get back into
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.160]  this and then a bunch of other news on your phone calls I'm gonna move quick
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:19.840]  now but here's Bob Costas a clip from him on NBC last night even if all those
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.920]  guns here it is Tony Dungey one of the most respected people in all the sports
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:27.920]  on our program on Sunday night said that one year when he coached the Colts he
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.320]  had 80 players before they cut the roster down 80 players in training camp he
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:38.320]  said how many of you guys own a gun and roughly 65 hands went up even if all
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:44.680]  those guns were obtained legally you can't have 65 guys in their 20s and 30s
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:50.960]  aggressive young men subject to impulses without something bad happening and I
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.360]  posed this question didn't have time to pose it on Sunday night but I'll pose it
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:13:00.600]  here give me one example of an athlete I know it's happened in society but give
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:06.520]  me one example of a professional athlete who by virtue of his having a gun took a
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:10.920]  dangerous situation and turned it around for the better I can't think of a
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.800]  single one hit boss sadly I can think of dozens where by there you go yeah you
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.200]  got an out of control rock star culture look at rock stars all the bad stuff
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.080]  they do the killings the deaths the Rolling Stones caught with a dead kid in
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:26.400]  their room sacrifice didn't get in trouble in New York oh you know about
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:32.360]  that look at all the corruption the drug overdoses the murders that I mean
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.800]  that's most rock stars are white we're gonna say all the white people are
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:40.600]  criminals because because you've got a bunch of white rock stars acting like
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:45.640]  animals the same thing with predominantly black athletes I mean
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:51.120]  obviously on growth hormone roids you know heads that look like they're the
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:58.480]  size of you know heads on Mount Rushmore giant shins buffalo hump from
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:04.520]  steroids bleep breast I'm gonna say the real name of them the whole deal those
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:09.200]  guys are on drugs you can look at most NFL players and tell they are just
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.080]  roided out of their mind it's like looking at a tomato you can tell if it's
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.240]  radioactive and you know been non you know and been GMO you know it's it's
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:21.480]  it's ridiculous I mean I've worked out in a lot of gyms you can tell when
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:25.040]  somebody's on roids they're walking around sweating got zits all over them
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:32.200]  giant chin bloodshot eyes staring at you like they're real tough you know that's
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.000]  the type of stuff we're talking about and those guys are all on drugs just like
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.520]  Lance Armstrong was on drugs and almost all the cyclists they're almost all on
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:45.520]  drugs it's all corrupt it's all a joke it's all a scam it's a fraud just admit
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:53.080]  it's a fraud stop being so naive and he wants to sit there and say I mean I
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:56.600]  there have been so many cases of professional athletes getting robbed
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:00.520]  and defending themselves or people trying to car jack them I mean I just
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:04.960]  remember back during the back of my mind a bunch of cases show listeners send us
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.720]  examples because you got the bit collectively the big brain out there
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.720]  to show tips at info wars.com and I'm gonna have my folks call through that
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.600]  help us because I know there have been a bunch of examples of people that have
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.280]  defended themselves but I mean you see it every day where gangs come in with
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.600]  guns to a computer shop or a jewelry store and a woman a old man pulls a gun
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:30.000]  starts shooting them or runs them out I mean it's it's it's 14 19 24 times
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.400]  depending on which year and which justice department number and they're even
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:39.680]  trying to play it down where people dozens of times more often use weapons to
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:45.160]  frustrate crime than what it's used any police will tell you that I mean you go
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:49.480]  into areas of New York and Chicago where they've banned the guns and where the
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:54.280]  system has allowed the drug culture to flourish it's incredibly dangerous you
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:57.960]  don't tell me that they allow drugs to be sold and operate in these areas of
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:01.760]  East Austin where I used to have to go to be on local cable access I went down
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:05.520]  there for a decade and I mean I would try to find safe ways to get there because
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.560]  it was like ambulances and dead people everywhere and and and crack dealers
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:15.480]  running up and hookers running up to you and cops watching you when you're
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:18.600]  getting gas and hooker comes over and you're like I'm not with her but then
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.240]  the cops do nothing it's like it's like they harass they harass people going
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.280]  into the bat well they harass white people going into quote bad neighborhoods
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.160]  is what's going on because you must be there to do something they don't mess
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:31.560]  with the dealers themselves and I was going over there and of course I would
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.480]  have to go edit over there late at night because you can only get the editing
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.720]  rooms in the middle of the night because they were always booked up back
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:40.480]  before I even had computers or editing stuff I would go there and make my own
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:45.160]  films voice them on three-quarter inch tape I mean they had like 70s
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:49.480]  equipment when I first got into talk radio the first place like you can't
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.760]  use the computers since you're only on the weekend here you can use this real
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.720]  to real tape because the the little minion guy didn't like me the program
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.800]  director and the general manager did give me the job but some of the others
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.160]  didn't like me they were like Democrats and thought I was a big Republican I
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:08.200]  was in the guns and stuff and I'll never forget them going you can use this and
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.600]  it was like a real to real or you had to cut it and everything I was like okay
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.280]  and they got you figure out how to do it and I got somebody else they go we
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:19.360]  haven't used this in years but I'll show you that's what they say they showed me
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:24.440]  and I used it and you know what I'm on 140 radio stations and publish a
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.000]  magazine and reach hundreds of millions of people here on YouTube alone and I'm
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:34.800]  on XM you didn't stop me and I'm not like haha I'm a big shot I don't get into
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:39.040]  ego stuff I'm all about the feet in the globalist but I tell you one area is
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.240]  people that have tried to hold me down and people that have tried to stop me
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:47.640]  people that have tried to get in my way I do have a real pleasure out of the fact
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:51.240]  that they're literally I looked him I actually looked him up there a bunch of
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:55.920]  losers the guys that gave me the jobs are big winners they moved on to bigger and
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:59.240]  better things because they they they weren't intimidated by talent they
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.600]  weren't intimidated by liberty they were freedom lovers they knew to give me my
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:06.360]  shot and radio all the scum nobodies that really didn't do anything around

[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:31.080]  Bob Costas you know spool well there are many cases of NFL athletes defending
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:34.160]  themselves from carjackings and home invasions we've already found quite a
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:39.760]  few in the last five minutes listeners are sending us more but he knows that
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.600]  the NBC audience is a bunch of dumbed-down idiots on fluoride brain
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.880]  damage that means the elite revel in the how they've done to everybody down
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.280]  that's that that's what they count on so they don't care if we find 500
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:54.520]  examples they'll just tell you that guns never protect anybody and lie to you
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:58.560]  it's it's it's what they do but we're gonna boycott the NFL and we're gonna
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.640]  boycott NBC they're all backing him and we're gonna boycott you because you want
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:07.440]  to take our rights your tyrants posing as liberals who care about us when
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:13.600]  you're scum and Bob Costas of course tried to cover up the pedophile valley
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.680]  there at Penn State and he tried to do all that I mean he's just a piece of
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:24.320]  trash that's all I can say so there you go you are piece of garbage Bob Costas
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:27.920]  and we know you were put up to do this we know you're gonna be protected and
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:32.720]  that's fine but folks a lot of you will turn your guns in for the NFL I
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:36.440]  understand that so that's what matters and hey that's what you're into that's
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:43.520]  your manhood that's fine I want to go to this clip that I mentioned by Colin
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:50.040]  Norm here he is breaking down the facts of the Second Amendment the right to
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:55.160]  keep their arms some real knowledge condensed so listen up and listen good
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:59.760]  as far as I'm concerned there is no current gun culture America's gun
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:03.600]  culture began at its inception America's gun culture will ensure more and more
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:07.280]  that the woman alone at home with her kid can protect ourselves when three
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.720]  armed men arrive at her back door and attempted mass shootings with no longer
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.080]  any countless lives lost where the husband and father can come home to his
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.560]  family after an attempted armed robbery hangers give people a fighting chance on
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:22.320]  a world where he was no respecter of man obeys no rules and whose appearance
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.760]  cannot be determined with any precision only that its appearance will
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.000]  definitely be made at some point in the coming days evil will be overlooked
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.720]  that's too easy an explanation for why Javon Belcher did what he did but here's
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.400]  what I believe you take away guns from American history and there is no America
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.160]  there is no platform for Bob Costa to share his opinion on national television
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:43.680]  take away guns and you take away people's ability to protect themselves you
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:46.760]  take away people's ability to protect themselves in our world where evil does
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.600]  everything it can to the privacy of life you take away our right to life in the
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.520]  history of man and gun the gun has remained constant always at the mercy of
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.960]  man's influence to launch his project out at an intended target and as far as
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.200]  history is concerned man has always determined the target whether lawfully
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.360]  unlawfully negligently or recklessly to blame a gun for man's decision is to
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.120]  foolishly attribute free will to an inanimate object the ability to carry
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.440]  your own firearm is a right not a commandment and I respect the rights of
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:16.600]  any individual who chooses not to carry our own firearm I only ask that the same
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:21.640]  courtesy be granted to me when I choose to exercise my right to do so that's
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:27.520]  right and this liberal idea that if someone else is gonna do something bad
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:32.480]  we need to take your rights you know oh I guess you can't have a car people kill
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:35.920]  people with cars more people are killed with knives every year look it up
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.120]  worldwide not just here in the US then with guns we're gonna restrict knives
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:44.560]  people kill each other with bow and arrows gonna restrict those people kill
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.400]  each other with hatchets people kill each other with knives in prisons people
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:53.760]  use drugs in prisons you can't keep anything away from anybody that's why
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:58.160]  you've only have to have laws to prosecute people after a crime is
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:03.240]  committed against someone else or property anybody that says oh we're
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:11.480]  gonna be moral we're gonna ban drugs while big pharma pushes all these deadly
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:14.880]  drugs on us as well they're doing that so they can raise the price of it and
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.720]  control it and have a controlled market and corrupt the government the British
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.120]  brought down the entire Chinese government and then broke the country up
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:27.520]  into more than 10 parts resulting in the boxer rebellion other things over a
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:31.260]  50-year period of bringing opium into the country the Chinese made a big
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:34.240]  mistake they were the only country in the world at that time that outlawed
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:38.560]  opium you could buy opium in the United States you could buy opium in England you
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:42.320]  could buy it in Japan you could buy it in anywhere pretty much in Africa where
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:48.480]  there were apothecaries or shops you buy cocaine you name it China said opium is
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:54.040]  illegal and you know what happened something that was dirt cheap was now
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:59.840]  20 30 40 50 some cases 200 times what it was in other countries and the British
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.120]  ship captains that already controlled opium worldwide British East India
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.600]  Dutch East India Dutch East India that merged later they would come in they
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.220]  would pay off the Chinese police they took over those cities to come about a
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:15.680]  decade and they took over the next key cities up the highways up the trainways
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:20.040]  up the railways into the country they took over those cities they they took
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:24.240]  them more than five decades take over the entire country and then say we now
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:30.640]  rule break it down break them down and that's the drug war they got control the
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:34.520]  organized crime they got control the police they got control the mayors they
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:39.000]  got control the governors and then they brought down the dynasty and brought down
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.080]  the whole government and you know the rest and they broke the country up for
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:47.720]  the allied colonial powers to control it that's what's being done to America and

[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:19.320]  Alex Jones show yeah there is a friendly little dog that got shot in
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:23.080]  Chicago for walking outside I'm even growling at the police it's been released
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:26.960]  from the clinic earlier I said it was killed I was rereading the article but
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:31.040]  the owner says the police returned well it's actually on video and said why are
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:34.640]  you talking to the media you're not basically allowed to do that in America
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:38.280]  kind of like police say you're not allowed to film us all over the country
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:43.560]  and they arrest people for wiretapping I mean if we give into that folks we might
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:47.040]  as well move to North Korea or we can really get treated like proper slaves
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:56.440]  so that's coming up I'm also going to get into some of the economic news and
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:01.160]  police state news everyone in the US under total surveillance NSA whistleblower
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:07.880]  says that's already come out hacker locates John McAfee through smartphone
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:13.440]  tracks and reportedly he's now gotten into Guatemala we've got his number in
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:16.520]  Belize and we've been talking to people there he's he's not there so we need to
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:22.080]  hear from him but I think that was diss info they put out saying that they've
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:25.600]  been captured by the Belizean authorities and again whereas I don't
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.920]  think he killed that guy I think he I think he's getting into this James Bond
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:34.000]  stuff a little bit too much and it's a pretty eccentric person now that's my
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.200]  breakdown on that fellow and of course a lot of analysts say they don't believe
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:40.680]  he killed him either a lot of police analysts are saying that in the
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:45.440]  Belizean government is famously corrupt also doctor says genetically modified
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:50.960]  wheat a perfect chronic poison I want to get into 20 shocking examples of how
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:57.160]  sadistic and cruel people have become and tie it into this dehumanization that's
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:02.560]  coming on but before I do that let me just give out the number here on any of
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:05.680]  the issues I've covered or whatever you'd like to talk about what do you
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:12.400]  think about Bob Costas a toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:17.760]  800-259-9231 the reason I want to hear from you on this again is we had a lot
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.120]  of people calling the office and stuff wanting to get on air you can tell people
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.700]  are really hyped when that's happening when I want to make a point I want to
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:27.600]  make a point and obviously we've heard a lot of logic out there what would have
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:34.040]  happened if Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman would have had a gun when whoever
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:38.680]  came out of the dark with that knife was there what would have you know happened
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:42.920]  in Nazi Germany if people hadn't been disarmed I mean the examples go on and
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:46.800]  on and Bob Costas just thinks you're stupid when he says oh yeah you can't
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:51.240]  trust athletes to have guns 20 and 30 year olds oh when can we have them 40
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:55.080]  50 I mean can I be an adult let people used to become adults when they're 13
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:36:03.520]  or 14 Thomas Jefferson you know was doing adult things when he was 15 and by the
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:07.480]  way it's a lie that people got grew up earlier because they didn't live as long
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:13.920]  it there was double to triple depending on which era in which time of of infant
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:19.400]  mortality and child mortality worldwide from the equatorial areas to northern
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:23.000]  Europe it's pretty much the same throughout history that around 30 to 40
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:28.440]  percent on the low end of children die before the age of 10 and most of it when
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:33.280]  they're babies a lot of women died in childbirth I've got ancestors we've done
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.440]  the genealogies because it's very interesting and that family that's done
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:41.120]  them all in detail on both sides my family genealogy is actually a lot of
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:46.040]  books so my mother's got a lot of those and I've read some of them and I mean I
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:51.360]  had like great great great grandpas who had like four wives and in 40 something
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:54.880]  kids and they would just wear them out and it wasn't that the women were being
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:58.760]  abused it was just what humans did you know had one wife had seven kids had
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:02.480]  another had 12 kids had another had nine kids I don't know I mean it was just
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:08.720]  armies of children you know living to 90 something years old so if you take out
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:14.360]  women dying in childbirth and children dying people lived over 80 on average and
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:19.160]  they've got major historical breakdowns of this okay our life expectancy is
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.400]  lowering and they now officially admit that okay let's get that straight people
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:28.440]  live on average less even with the worst infant mortality from the 17th and 18th
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:33.680]  century okay if you made it past 10 folks you were tough as nails all right
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:41.240]  and that's how it is okay so there's all these lies about this stuff and I don't
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:46.280]  know how I got off into all that but just how my brain works well what was I
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:50.720]  talking about to get off into mortality and life expectancy and lifespan and all
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:56.120]  the rest of it the age of gun owners well yeah no no people were being sent
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:02.160]  when they were 10 if they showed the aptitude and were serious that more than
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:04.920]  intelligence it was steadfast and sincere people were being sent when they
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:09.400]  were 10 as couriers they were being used in war they were being used as trusted
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:15.080]  you know a 10-year-old assassins culture-wide all cultures kids are some
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:19.480]  of the best fighters there are out there and and the whole issue is you're
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:24.800]  supposed to grow up and just get more and more manly more and more knowledge
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:32.440]  more and more strong okay and instead you know you're supposed to be a kid till
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:35.840]  you're 20 and woman have fun in college now and getting all this debt and then
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:38.840]  oh I'm just working to make money now I'm working for retirement well now I'm
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:43.720]  retired I don't want to be involved it's all a lie stealing your humanity from
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:52.520]  you and I'm just thankful that my parents basically you know said there's two
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:56.120]  ways to raise somebody you either totally shelter him or throw him to the
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:01.440]  wind and I was thrown to the wind and that was a good thing it was good for
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:06.280]  me because nature puts out a lot of stuff to quote KRS one looking for the
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:11.080]  one I'm not saying I'm the one but obviously all of us out there have been
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:16.560]  successful generally it's because you've actually seen some things and I look
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:19.320]  back on growing up the things I saw the things I've it's been a what's been a
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.640]  giant adventure it's this stuff I've done and seen I'll never say on air
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:26.400]  because no one would believe it you know and and and people see what I've done
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:29.920]  the last 17 years on air and our exploits and our adventures and they
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:35.080]  don't think that's real because they're living these catatonic lives in their
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:39.880]  basement never getting out scared of everything and and I've lived a
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:45.640]  primitive life I not not not compared to Navy SEALs that do 300 missions a year
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:50.560]  or people like that see that that's why even though we're a corrupt empire and
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:54.280]  what those guys are doing on average is evil and bad you still have to respect
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:59.280]  it because it's real you see they're actually out there seeing real things
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:06.240]  doing real things and that's what makes you a human is the adversity is getting
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:12.120]  past your fear is taking action I mean 99.9% of people aren't gonna march into a
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:18.600]  federal building you know a closed you know secretive shop and and get into
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:23.240]  the building through the fence and then get in and then confront them and and
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:27.200]  those feds were like what is this a one-eyed one-horned flying purple
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:30.920]  people leader same thing when we storm the Capitol twice that's not a big deal
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:37.760]  that's what you're supposed to do or your slave so I'm not exceptional the
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:43.600]  general public is incredibly unexceptional okay I mean I go back and
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:48.040]  research my ancestors just all of them it just goes on and on and on the
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:54.320]  adventures and the shootouts and the wars and the fighting bandits to deliver
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:41:01.960]  cotton to Houston and just an ending stuff and you know somebody's rude to
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:06.040]  you church let's go outside get your gun buddy you know and there wasn't
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:09.120]  actually a lot of that going on because people were polite because if you cross
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:14.080]  somebody they'd be real nice to you but you crossed okay let's go outside you
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:21.160]  want to handle this with fists or swords or guns Hollywood popularized guns
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:25.800]  most time people just went outside let's go outside only a coward would use a
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:30.040]  gun that was in the cases where it was bad guys bandits they wanted to use a
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:34.680]  gun because they didn't want to get in a fight with some frontiers person don't
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:38.360]  don't you understand where you come from no matter what color you are every
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:41.120]  culture has gone through incredible adventures every culture has gone
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.760]  through adversity and we have become these decadent blobs in this
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:50.240]  artificial civilization I'm not defending the civilization the globalist say
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:54.080]  they want to replace it they want to replace it with something worse they
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:42:00.200]  want to make it more decadent more controlled more stratified I'm ranting
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:06.520]  I should I go to your calls the issue is that now you can't have a gun when
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:12.800]  you're 20 to 30 quote from Costas guys in their 20s and 30s aggressive young
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:19.120]  men subject to impulse without something bad happening well that they
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:22.720]  haven't had the life experiences up to that point now they've got 20 million
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:26.000]  dollars and now there's people getting in their face in fact I'm reading what
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.840]  football players are saying how they get robbed how people try to carjack them
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:36.040]  because they're big targets and like Luke Scott believes guns are necessary for
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:40.600]  the safety of athletes will no kidding I mean most people that are wealthy are
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:44.080]  under celebrities are scared to go out and take bodyguards with them I mean
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:49.760]  I've been every Hollywood person I've known has to take two or three bodyguards
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:52.960]  out you know who stand there in the bushes while you sit there and eat hot
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:57.000]  dogs or whatever because people will run up and throw themselves on you
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:03.400]  schizophrenic women will run up jump on you and then say you raped them and so
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:06.400]  of course the athletes have guns and then some of them are decking it they're
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:09.680]  on drugs there's gonna be problems don't take my guns because of that I know
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:14.480]  I'm ranting here and so that's why I went off into all that you know people
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:22.240]  need to grow up younger people need to people need to be in sports but I mean
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:31.600]  full contact mixed martial arts boxing all of it people need to get in the ring
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:34.680]  and fight back my children have been in some of them I'm gonna put them I just
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:38.400]  and I'm putting them into everything because I know all the stuff and I don't
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:45.440]  even put it into function people need to be in fights they need to to to to but
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:48.880]  instead now people don't fight and all of a sudden somebody just pulls a gun out
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:52.480]  shoot somebody because they're such cowards they want to act like a gangster
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:55.680]  they start a fight with somebody oops this person's gonna beat me down let me
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:00.760]  just pull a gun out anyways I'm ranting about this thing to be in controlled
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:07.400]  combat they need to be in that so they have respect for it but instead no
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:10.760]  wonder the left ones people's guns they want to enslave us and controls at the
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:15.840]  top but the average left jellyfish literally walks around like a self
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:21.360]  propelled stomach talks in a cowardly voice on purpose is absolutely scared
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:28.040]  of everything and kind of just sneaks around everywhere and we need to not
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.880]  let these people run our culture we need to rediscover testosterone we need to
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:35.280]  rediscover strength we need to rediscover the frontier spirit we need to
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:41.160]  rediscover respect as well and that's my 500 cents on it because I've made a lot
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:46.800]  of points here let's go to West in Ohio on the NFL issue thank you for calling
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:51.560]  today West what's on your mind on the NFL sir how you doing today good good
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:55.920]  I you heard you earlier say something about Bob Costas come out with this
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:02.760]  garbage about he can't find one example of an NFL player that had a firearm could
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:06.520]  defend itself does anybody remember son Taylor 2007 when a truder broke in his
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:09.800]  home and shot and killed him he had a firearm he could have defended itself
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:16.760]  very simple math well that's right but many we've found a bunch of cases here
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:20.600]  we're gonna have Paul Watson or one of our other great writers do a report on
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:24.640]  it but I mean it's not just NFL we're finding all sorts of athletes folks
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:33.600]  send us golf baseball soccer basketball I mean I've seen so many cases of
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:38.120]  professional athletes running and truders off or hands up you know catching
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:41.560]  people robbing their houses I mean you're crazy if you live in some five
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.080]  ten million dollar house in a wealthy neighborhood and you're a celebrity and
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:49.160]  you don't have a gun I mean I don't have bodyguards I got guns I got a gun in my
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:53.360]  car I got a gun right here in my desk I got guns and I mean it's like a tool
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:57.160]  like this pen you know anybody ever tries to come after me I mean you know I
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:00.040]  don't live in fear they can walk up behind me and kill me you know they just
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:04.320]  turned me into a martyr but the point is I don't live in fear but at least if it
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:09.240]  if I see it coming you know you better hope I don't see you coming anything else
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:15.440]  sir you made a great point and hung up all right Bryce in Missouri you're on
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:21.160]  the air thanks Alex for taking my call and yeah I just want to make a comment
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:25.520]  about the gun control issue and then at the beginning of the show you talked
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:31.200]  about revelation unfolding and and I think I need some clarification on that
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:36.840]  but but I kindly disagree with you on that but on the gun control I was used
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:41.960]  I used to be an actual person who didn't like guns and I thought they should be
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:45.720]  outlawed and we don't have a need for them because it would you know that whole
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:51.040]  Kool-Aid bit and and a history teacher told us in high school that you know the
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:54.840]  reason why nobody's taken over this country whether it be domestic or foreign
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:58.560]  is because we have the right to bear arms so I'm thinking domestic what's
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:02.240]  domestic you know we don't have any domestic enemies unless somebody tried
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:07.160]  to invade the country well he explained that you know in case of government has
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:12.920]  too much power and wants to enslave humanity etc you're not able to do
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:17.880]  that with with 145 million people with guns so I thought that was very
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:21.960]  interesting and that was you know 20 years ago now you know you talk about
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:27.120]  gun it's such a loaded word no pun intended that you know it's like you
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:30.880]  don't even talk about gun because if you talk about gun oh that means you know
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:34.040]  all these things come up all this propaganda and Kool-Aid that's thrown
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:39.120]  in your face on a daily basis today comes up so you know I hope people can
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:42.960]  teach the truth and the public schools out there for any public teachers and
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:47.880]  stuff but Alex no no I agree with you listen I'm not going to get into the
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:51.000]  religious debates it's all been scrambled up one side and down the other
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.640]  to deceive the people but my Bible says that the rapture happens after the
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:59.640]  devil is defeated it's clearly a five-year-old can read it and see that
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:03.360]  and then that's all how that's interpreted but the Bible has become a
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:08.040]  giant and it's distortion a giant cop out with Romans 13 and revelation to say
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:11.560]  praise the Lord they're trying to put chips in people that means Jesus is
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:15.560]  coming back next week we'll be out of here and all these cultures when they're
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.360]  being massacred you know the tootsies by the Hutus they were Christians they
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:22.760]  thought they were about to be raptured or people Christians in Germany thought
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:26.400]  they were going to be raptured and it's just a Chinese under mouth thought they
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:30.720]  were going to be raptured and it is a demonic cop out and God's not going to
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:34.480]  give me Christians out there you think you're just going to lay around all day
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:38.600]  and let evil take over and and just go to your church and feel good about
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:43.440]  yourself God's gonna say I don't know you go get out of here go away for me I
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:48.160]  don't know you because what you do to the least of these you do to me but I
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:51.760]  don't want to get into a debate okay I just know there's a career of the
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:55.320]  universe I have a spiritual connection I know what I need to do and there's a
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.960]  bunch of Pharisees talking about don't listen to music or don't do this or
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:01.600]  that but they're not out protesting abortion clinics they're not out
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:04.580]  speaking about cancer viruses and the vaccines they're just a bunch of
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:08.600]  Pharisees the same ones telling Christ don't hang out with that prostitute don't
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:11.920]  hang out with a tax collector don't hang out with these people why do you think
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.520]  he was hanging out with them to bring them the information I mean I've been
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:21.240]  friends with Joe Rogan since I guess 14 years it's about 98 smart guy I like him
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:24.520]  funny don't agree with some of the things he says or what he stands for don't
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:27.440]  particularly like some of the worldliness not that I'm perfect but man
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:31.880]  plus I like him plus having him on we're gonna air a big thing with him
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:36.680]  tomorrow a big interview I did this weekend it gets his entire audience
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:40.560]  tune in here duh now we're waking him up to the cancer viruses and the
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.200]  vaccines you know now we're now we're I mean I was on Chicago TV this morning
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:49.320]  talking about cancer viruses and the vaccines and reading over documents I
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:54.040]  mean I want to warn people about cancer viruses I want to reach them I want to
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:50:00.720]  reach the worldly people I want to affect them yeah I remember Doug stand up
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:04.840]  when I first met him about 11 years ago you know right after 9-11 he didn't
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.720]  believe it was you know thought it was wrong now he says it's an inside job now
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.440]  he says the bin Laden rates totally fake Doug stand hope incredibly funny
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:18.040]  incredibly profane very you know eugenics based doesn't understand that
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:22.720]  but by being friends with him and that's not why I do it I learned how it turned
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:27.080]  into something good I then can reach out to all his huge fans and now I'm
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:31.440]  changing him you see doesn't mean I fully changed him but I'm changing him
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:38.280]  I'm changing him do you understand that hello yes you understand that oh yeah
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:42.000]  no I agree no hey I don't want to talk about the rapture that's not the point
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.880]  it's that the revelation we're talking about the end times there's a lot of
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:49.520]  conspiracy theorists out there that think all this stuff is pointing towards the
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:52.720]  end times and that's not understand listen I don't believe the end of the
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:57.520]  world or revelation with 70 AD in the sacking of Jerusalem by Titus believe
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:02.280]  me I know all this information sir making the right decisions is a
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:06.040]  challenge to investors are we going to see economic growth slide into a

[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:22.400]  haven but what do you do when the US government overextends itself and spends

[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:22.040]  there's not one example of them ever doing something good with a gun you know

[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:10.880]  air I promise all right let's move to the next person let's talk to Nicole in
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:17.120]  Michigan you're on the air hello Alex I want to mention a couple of things first
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:20.760]  off I'm an herbalist and I would recommend that you get yourself some
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:29.360]  peppermint and honey tea to help soothe your throat right now and secondly I was
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:35.400]  under the misguided I'm using sarcasm here but I was under the misguided notion
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:39.720]  that we've got terrorists all over the place shouldn't we as American people
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:43.440]  be able to defend ourselves against these evil terrorists that we keep getting
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:48.760]  told that are all over well the problem is that's a good point is that when you
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:52.680]  get all the training manuals that are public there's nothing about al-Qaeda
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:57.760]  it's all about American gun owners and conservatives and veterans and how we
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:00.320]  need to be disarmed and put in reeducation centers that's now in the
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:04.720]  official army manual we've literally given you the code number four probably
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:11.160]  50 times and here's McClatchy LA times you name it al-Qaeda groups Syrian
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:16.640]  rebels once denied now key to anti Assad victories the CFR three months ago said
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:21.840]  they're commanding al-Qaeda US aircraft carrier rise off Syria US now ready for
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.400]  direct military confrontation that's a prison planet dot com but direct links
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:31.240]  to the Australian newspaper debco file and turkey newspapers and so they're
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:34.320]  now ready for a direct confrontation with the Assad regime backed up by the
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:38.760]  Russian government and our government has put in at least 50,000 al-Qaeda
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:43.080]  fighters and has given them missiles shoulder-fired service to air to bring
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:47.040]  down aircraft they are shooting down helicopters jets you name it and they
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:52.040]  are in the news Syrian rebels and this is in McClatchy newspapers when we
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:56.520]  finished with Assad we will fight the US so we need to have articles prepare for
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:58:01.120]  missiles to bring down aircraft and the feds love it they will let them in blow
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:04.360]  up they will shoot aircraft when you take off from your local airport they
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:08.480]  will blow the engine off they will kill you and the media will say we've got to
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:11.160]  give our rights up and there'll be no discussion that our government gave on
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:13.800]  the missiles and runs al-Qaeda what do you think of that
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:19.520]  oh yeah I believe it there's one other thing I wanted to mention sure um there's
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:26.320]  a diverse I don't know if diverse is the word but there's a clear difference
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:32.520]  between the the people that grow up with the parents teaching them how to go

[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:54.800]  is the best let's talk to Nicole in Michigan she was finishing up getting
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:59.840]  into well restate what you were saying go ahead well the thing I've noticed is
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:05.200]  that you know the families that the parents teach the kids there's you know
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:12.000]  how to use the guns gun safety and they make it a family thing to go out and go
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:18.800]  hunting and forge for their own food have less gun related issues less
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:23.360]  accidents no I agree a lot of people don't get guns over 20 or 30 and they
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:26.520]  think it's all movies and then it's like they've noticed if you put somebody in a
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:30.040]  uniform they act authoritative or you put somebody in lingerie they you know
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:34.960]  they suddenly get sexually excited it's the same thing of here's a gun they get
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.560]  all crazy with it's like a deer hunter who's 30 years old never gone deer hunting
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.400]  the first year they see they start shaking and freak out or shoot the
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:45.640]  neighbor's cow because you know they call it buck fever you know it's kind of
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:49.120]  like these greenhorn cops that can't even swim can't even fight now they're
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:51.840]  pulling you over they're so scared they shoot you because they think you're
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:56.400]  al-qaeda because the news told them so but also when you take your kids out in
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:59.320]  the garden or you take them out hunting or you take them out camping they're
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:03.920]  designed to do this and they get into the ugabuga mode and start you know
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:08.040]  really getting excited but if you don't do it when they're young they never get
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:11.560]  into it so it's part of the domestication process I agree sorry go
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:17.280]  ahead yep my father when when he noticed I was getting in interested in his guns
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:21.280]  the first thing he did was went to the grocery store and bought some water
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:25.520]  melons and shot him in front of me to show me how dangerous guns really are
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:30.720]  because you can't tell a guy a kid how dangerous a gun is with words because
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:36.320]  kids they see information the hearing information doesn't register as well and
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:42.560]  so he shot up some water melons to show me these are not toys you don't touch
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:47.120]  these these can kill you yeah what's done what's done in the country is you're
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:51.560]  always slaughtering pigs or cows and what you do is you know you take somebody
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:55.600]  out you say don't touch the guns and people say oh this is so primitive no
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:59.200]  this is what humans have done with swords and things we look back and you know
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:02.760]  you got to butcher it and you shoot the cow in the head the kids think it's
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:05.640]  interesting because they're designed to not think it's it's false that they be
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:09.120]  freaked out butchering fish or cows or whatever and then you know the tractor
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:12.480]  pulls them up by chains in the barn and you butcher the cow right there and
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:15.560]  they learn how to do it that's real interesting there's the liver there's
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:19.520]  the kidneys there's the there's the cows three stomachs and but they
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:24.400]  understand you do you aim this at something it kills it now I've seen
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:28.520]  stuff butcher but that's how I was taught when I was about four years old I was
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:31.400]  interested in guns and they took me out and let me shoot Folgers coffee cans
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:35.360]  with a 410 shotgun and I wanted to shoot the 12 gauge let me shoot that thought
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:38.880]  it was great that's why I shoot 50 cows handheld don't think they kick people
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:41.200]  think guns have kicks I don't know what they're talking about you pull it in
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:44.680]  your shoulder and then my dad said all right see that tweedy bird up there in
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:47.960]  that tree it was a bird you're not supposed to hunt but that's you know how
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:51.520]  you teach him whatever's available and he takes the 12 gauge blows the tweedy
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:54.840]  bird to bits and I thought that was a little sad as little feet it was all
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:04:00.280]  that was left he said you don't touch these ever and and then that's and then
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:04.480]  nobody in farming towns you ever get shot my dad my dad went to a pretty big
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:08.560]  farming school he went hunting with his coaches on their farms and people and
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:12.680]  with the principal and stuff and they all brought their shotguns unloaded with
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:15.420]  their boxes shells put them right in their lockers and they'd all go out
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:21.280]  hunting together I mean that's just what you did and that's so alien to people
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:28.000]  today I'm sorry go ahead the sad part is most of our children today learn how
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:34.400]  to hunt through video games their parents are absent in that regard their
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:40.800]  parents don't realize that these kids are sitting in their rooms using the
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:44.760]  computer in the video game to babysit them exactly and then it's been proven
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:48.080]  to dehumanize you were real killing doesn't affect you anymore that's why
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:51.680]  real men would get upset by death because they knew it was real I mean
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:55.400]  we tell you when you got a buck 20 yards below you with a compound bow pulled
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:58.520]  back and he looks right in your eyes and you let that thing go I mean you know
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:03.000]  it's something when they fall over to die now that we have moved into the
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:08.480]  winter season there is an increased need to support our immunity and health at

[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:15.880]  pervert it's all about being dominated by these people and we've got that report
[02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:18.960]  coming up in Chicago where they shoot the guy's dog for no reason and the cops
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:21.960]  show up all the media is there and say you're not allowed to talk to the media
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:25.800]  I mean that's North Korea you want to live in North Korea there it is they
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:32.240]  want you under their thumb it's a very sad Mike in Oregon you are on the air
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:39.360]  listening via free Android app welcome Mike I'm doing good brother what's on
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:44.280]  your mind today after all the topics we've covered well I'm kind of still
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:48.800]  upset about the cost this in Whitlock remarks and I actually got a comment for
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:57.600]  the both of them along for mr. Costas 2009 slide forth mr. Steve McNair good
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:03.040]  quarterback he was killed in his sleep or shot by some thing it was like his
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:08.280]  ex-wife or something but if he had had a gun he probably would still be alive
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:15.320]  today but another long following up this other comment about a room 20 25-year-old
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:21.080]  steroid addicts all pumped up having handguns what about the 40,000 18 to 21
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:25.280]  year olds in Afghanistan under hangers that are just brainwashed and to kill
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:29.440]  them people well that is the issue they listen the average person gets in the
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:33.520]  military at about 20 the average service is about five years you look this up
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:37.480]  and I was thinking that this morning Costas is saying you can't trust 20 to
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:40.960]  30 year olds with guns he said that I played the clip twice for you just tuned
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:46.400]  in the clips up at info wars.com you want to go watch it you know the full
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.120]  clip of Costas and he came out and said I don't apologize in fact people
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:55.760]  shouldn't even have guns if they're 20 to 30 years of age period and so Wall
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:59.440]  Street Journal says that he refuses to apologize and throws it in everybody's
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:03.880]  face so Costas here it is Bob Costas won't back down from anti-gun remarks
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:12.400]  that's Wall Street Journal and it shows that he wants your guns and if there
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:17.240]  are bad 20-year-olds out there I need my gun to protect myself but there's this
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:20.520]  idea that we can only trust the government what about all the steroid
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:25.160]  cops out there some police departments admit their police are on steroids like
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:32.040]  in Fort Worth it's been in the news where their chief has said steroids is
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:36.560]  good for the four of them and you know I understand with the Bistrein LA and the
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:40.280]  feminizing hormones they put in the food and water on purpose and bloodless brag
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:44.400]  about how they do that by the way that's not my opinion that maybe moderate for
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:49.440]  some of those guys if they are sysified I can see putting them on it a little bit
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:56.080]  but I mean I couldn't imagine having at your testosterone I've got plenty so my
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:01.280]  hair is falling out but the point is well I'm just ranting about this what
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:04.720]  about all the roided up soldiers coming back and cops and all the rest of it and
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:09.080]  the answer is well the government says those that don't join them are
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:13.120]  terrorists and those that do join them are above the law and godlike and in
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:16.520]  Chicago tell people well we shot your dog you can't talk to the media we're
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:23.960]  God anything else sir yeah statistically cops kill way more people than
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:28.000]  average citizen along with their own fellow cops along with their little
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.520]  drug raids they go and shoot one of their fellow cops then they blame it on
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:35.560]  the guy they just mowed down by the way that does happen a lot that's been
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:38.800]  confirmed I appreciate your call there are a lot of good police departments out
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:43.600]  there overall but there are a lot of bad ones and they're getting worse and we
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:47.680]  need to rein it in but the globalists want a bunch of people that'll follow
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:51.560]  orders they want authoritarian thugs and that's where we're going in this
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:57.840]  country it's not good for anybody let's talk to brawn in Alabama let's talk about
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:03.520]  the NFL and for those that don't know the sports writer at Fox who that Costa
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:07.480]  said he agreed with and quoted he says gun ownership is racist and all gun
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:12.960]  owners are Ku Klux Klan members now the NRA is Ku Klux Klan I played the clip
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:17.800]  yesterday and the people on the show with them agree even though the Ku Klux
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:22.160]  Klan is on record getting the south to pass gun gun restrictions the first
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:26.240]  gun laws after the Civil War so blacks couldn't defend themselves so they could
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:29.720]  go burn down their houses and kill them and lynch them and they kept blacks from
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:34.720]  getting guns and they killed him so so that he takes the truth and literally
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:39.520]  inverts it on its head and the media praises him so there's that's that's a
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:45.880]  news core for you I'm sorry I go ahead to brawn you're right that speaks to the
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:50.280]  whole disconnect but you know that's exactly why I called because I had a
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:54.120]  suggestion for you because you could really maximize your Twitter following
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:58.320]  just by doing a few more things basically I think that it you know it
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:03.960]  especially if you tweeted directly at people like that Jason Whitlock and you
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:08.160]  know Bob Costa if you use Twitter often enough but I agree I don't know how
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:13.400]  Twitter works and I've got some of the crew using and who knows something but
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:17.360]  most of it's me or I tell them to do something and then it's not their fault
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:20.160]  and I'll give them directions and some stuff goes out that I don't agree with
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:24.240]  I need to get to take more control of the Twitter you see stuff at night or on
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:27.640]  the weekend it's me during the week I say hey tweet this out and it goes out
[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:31.240]  then they overall do a pretty good job but you're right I see that we need to
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:36.640]  tweet at at the people attacking them baiting them in we need to get people to
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:40.760]  follow us we need to because I the Twitter is one area where we used to have
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:44.080]  like seven or eight accounts and we combined them it was like 600,000 people
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:49.400]  our biggest one only has 120,000 and then we'll kind of promote little things
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:54.040]  we're doing but not the big things and it's my fault I'm not directing the the
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:58.120]  one lady that works here and kind of works on PlanetInFullWars.com does a
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:02.320]  great job moderating some of the stuff and also with the real Alex Jones on
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:08.120]  Twitter so tell me how I maximize my tweeting sir well you know I run that
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:13.600]  WTFROY.com site you retweeted a lot of stuff that David Amber Lion was on and
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:17.960]  you know just little things like that you know little quotes and very specific
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:22.880]  things that are relevant to exactly what you you know need to convey at that
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:26.520]  point just by putting that out there on Twitter so many people come across that
[02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:30.600]  because Twitter is a completely you know it falls in so many different
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:35.760]  directions and just just the searchability of that and the SEO would
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:40.320]  would really you know help spread it in completely new directions for people that
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:44.520]  don't even have never heard of you. Well we all saw and they've been doing that
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:47.400]  we need to have the graphics department with simple political statements send
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:52.000]  out images we need to do that more on Facebook Facebook makes you pay now if
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.080]  you're big to send it out to people so you know we have millions so we can't
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:59.480]  really use it it's all about info wars.com and prisonplanet.com we need
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:04.320]  you guys to help us because you know I can be seen by hundreds of millions on
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:09.320]  YouTube I can be all over national TV shows I can be on 140 AM and FM
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:13.080]  stations I can be on Hexam the list goes on and on but we need to get that
[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:18.440]  Twitter up to a million people and it's twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:24.840]  and I guess we need to create a at Alex Jones Twitter somehow because I've been
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:30.760]  told that by everybody so you're right any other points sir. Well basically one
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:33.880]  way I think you could really do it is by tweeting at a specific group of people
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:39.160]  multiple of them at one time with one specific article in the headline and you
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:43.080]  never know you know if they read they might actually discuss it with some of
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:47.840]  the friends you know they were actually no I agree sometimes if I send like like
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:52.360]  Dave Mustaine this morning was just asking me if I'm getting feedback from
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:55.520]  him tweeting us to his millions of people and and I'm just so busy I don't
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:58.600]  even have time we need to be tweeting to Dave Mustaine Billy Corrigan we need to
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:03.960]  be tweeting to you know people like Joe Perry of Erasmus need to be tweeting to
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:06.360]  Charlie Sheen I've never even tried to get him to send out a tweet for me he's
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:10.040]  got eight million that's I just don't think about it I need to I mean I use it
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:12.600]  and like it I just don't think about making it big I'm starting to do that
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:17.840]  now I need to get a man count a tweet stuff for me I need to get Joe Rogan
[02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:21.720]  you know the tweet to him we've tweeted before he's tweeted this so yeah we need
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:26.160]  to really do it that way and you're absolutely right more more gold and ideas
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:31.920]  sir tell me basically the last thing that I think is is is you take all that
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:35.560]  and you start tweeting at people like it's in groups three four five people at
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:39.480]  time these celebrities and those get retweeted so many times just by their
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:42.800]  followers and that you know that's how you can start really spreading is that
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:47.360]  and you know a couple of great we're gonna send a tweet but I need to write
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:57.920]  this something like Bob Costas why are you lying to people about guns and then
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:02.920]  send it to him to NBC Sports to a bunch of others and then attach to it an
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:08.880]  article we're doing Bob Costas why are you lying and saying athletes don't
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:12.000]  protect themselves with guns or something like that and then get people to
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:19.720]  notice that he's lying about this that's a great idea right so the last thing is
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:26.640]  that I know I also usually quote you know double times day I put one out there
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:31.240]  today about the KKK article and I think that you know if you start tweeting
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:34.440]  certain things and then you put those in your articles you can embed it so that
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:38.360]  you know rich content and and it takes you directly to that person's
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:41.640]  counter it takes you to your account so they can follow you right there you know
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:45.160]  just just putting it in front of people's space right then and there will
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:49.720]  at least make it however much more likely for them to click it you know to
[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:55.160]  follow you and spread that information that way now you're right and we need to
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:59.840]  go after these celebrities that are promoting promoting Satanism and you
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:03.320]  know pushing all sorts of stuff and and and get people debating what they're
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:07.280]  saying what they're doing because I'm the master they don't put out a YouTube
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:10.200]  video on a news piece and have a million views of what other people can't get
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:14.200]  that done I need to be able to dominate this Twitter thing because that's the
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:18.480]  new email and I know that and people can go to info wars.com forward slash
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:23.960]  newsletter and they can sign up there on the site and they can then get the free
[02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:28.680]  magazine the digital version they can get key alerts and things but people sign
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:31.680]  up for it we use a big establishment email system to make sure there's no
[02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:36.760]  spam and they'll be lazy and they'll hit the spam button to delete my email
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:41.920]  instead of delete and then and then you know it causes problems so it's I got
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:45.080]  to get away from this email thing because I try to give people a free
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:48.280]  magazine they sign up for it and they're like I don't want your free magazine
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:52.680]  you know it's we're gonna send the magazine back out today for people that

[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:30.720]  Houston there are let's just say they federalized the school the schools as
[02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:39.400]  well as the teachers now few months ago you had a special showing how the the
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:46.400]  police and others were given kids you know young adults drugs drugs of their
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:53.000]  choice in exchange for spying well they're doing the exact same thing with
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:56.640]  the teachers and by the way people I've got to hear this people didn't believe
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:26:00.640]  it when a major Capitol reporter in Minneapolis St. Paul who's broken big
[02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:05.520]  stories broke it here and then a month later or three weeks later the governor
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:10.400]  all of them it came out the state police were running it yes they run the drugs in
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:15.640]  most cities unbelievable tell us what else happened tell us well to make a
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:19.200]  long story short and I would like to give you guys my information later to work
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:23.760]  we should talk more because it's it's one of those things I'd have to explain
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:29.120]  all of it for any of it to make sense but I've been approached by FBI by homeland
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:36.000]  security and by CIA the later of which was a gentleman from the CIA about a
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.720]  month ago just literally showed up at my house and told me that they were going
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:44.600]  to make my life a living hell okay so you discovered they're putting the kids on
[02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:48.320]  not just their riddling in Prozac but on their schmack and coke and the rest of
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:52.280]  it is that what happened no no no what I've discovered is that they are putting
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:59.440]  the teachers themselves they are given the teachers cocaine they're given the
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:07.360]  teachers marijuana in in exchange for spying the teachers of themselves are
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:11.680]  spying on people it's not just the kids anymore with the computers they're using
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:16.480]  the teachers no I know you know actually this goes on I mean the biggest drug
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:21.600]  pushers funny people are always trying to make connections to me in the CIA and
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:24.720]  saying I'm government instead of judging you know the fruits of the tree
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:28.880]  there's no way I'm globalist I mean it's a miracle I'm alive but then I but then
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:33.720]  they always ignore where I admit I've had family that was in the CIA and who
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:39.520]  got out because they were told told exact stuff like you're saying and they
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:43.080]  wouldn't do it I mean they would do some hardcore stuff overseas because they
[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:46.600]  thought they were fighting communists but they brought them back here to do
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:52.080]  incredible stuff in fact with one family member it was it was deal drugs and
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:56.400]  kill people in Chicago army officer who they wanted to sheep dip and he was
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:28:01.000]  older too and he wouldn't do it but I mean it's just so incredible I'm sorry
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:07.440]  go ahead well it in particular what I would like to do is give you guys the
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:11.560]  hard facts but but that's something I'm gonna have to do shortly at another time
[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:20.960]  well just how does you discover this well well basically on Facebook this
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:26.560]  woman just out of the blue sent me a message and I mean she's a drop dead
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:33.000]  gorgeous woman and so you know we talked on through Facebook for about a week
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:39.920]  and a half sure they use sex operatives so man and check this out she was she
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:46.400]  worked about two blocks down the street from my house coincidence I think not now
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:51.400]  the strange thing is that there were times when I would pray about these
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:57.600]  matters and I would ask my subconscious to give me a sign whether or not this
[02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:04.240]  woman was a spy and one time she called me from school and the phones actually
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:09.840]  start to gain this interference and I can actually hear one of her supervisors
[02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:14.680]  probably from some type of fusing center talking to her and telling her what
[02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:21.400]  to ask me and she started to pick up on the fact that the lines were getting
[02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:25.720]  crossed or something to that effect and she hung up but not before I could
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:30.120]  actually hear what these people were saying now now get this the first night
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:35.520]  that we that we met we met the day before I was to do a radio interview
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:41.440]  talking about specific technology that has been weaponized technology that
[02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:45.560]  Richard Hogan has alluded to hold on it's probably because of where you work

[02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:19.400]  go before I sleep I I know I've been talking about this over and over again
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:24.240]  but you know you heard the caller call in and I don't know if he's telling the
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:27.280]  truth or not he sounds legitimate but I but I remember when a prestigious you
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:31.040]  know I mean a reporter has broken a lot of big news stories got video with his
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:37.080]  undercover team of the police going and getting Occupy Wall Street demonstrators
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:40.600]  and offering him cocaine heroin marijuana alcohol whatever they wanted to
[02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:44.760]  go stir up trouble and delivering them back with drugs bombed out of their
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:49.400]  brain and it's like flashbacks it makes me sick when I wasn't using drugs in
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:54.680]  high school you know I tried a few I'd smoked marijuana made me feel like I
[02:36:54.680 --> 02:36:59.840]  was run over by a truck and didn't you know didn't really like it tried a few
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:04.880]  other things and nothing floated my boat but she went to back and beer and
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:10.080]  then I watched cops deal drugs in Rockwall Texas and later the sheriff
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:14.560]  went to jail for it flying in bunch of stuff into the airport and another
[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:18.320]  police got caught selling drugs to the department itself not just the Sheriff
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:22.760]  Department and you know there'd be cops in there and and getting in lockers and
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:26.400]  drug dogs and the cops would pull me over when I was riding with friends and
[02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:31.560]  I was like 1415 and you know we're gonna search your car and blah blah blah and

[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:58.680]  fine it's San Diego Harold Tribune for washing your car I just you've got to
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:01.880]  wake up where it's all over okay I'm ranting sir real quick finish your
[02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:05.440]  story we'll get your number we'll give you our email if you can send us some
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:09.840]  documentation if you do have bombshell info they're gonna kill you if you don't
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:13.360]  go public with it all soon that's the type people that get killed or get set up
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:16.680]  if what you're saying is true and you know we prove that up in Minneapolis
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:20.080]  St. Paul the police had a giant program drugging everybody and selling the
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:24.480]  drugs because they're drug dealers and they need to prime the pop thing to get
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:28.000]  new customers that's what drug dealers do and they push prozac riddling and
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:31.640]  deadly vaccines on your kids and I'm not saying all departments do this but
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:37.120]  Dallas Texas they've caught the the entire detective force dealing drugs or
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:41.680]  and framing people to take their property they've caught the Houston police
[02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:46.440]  doing it and a fake crime lab they've got Chicago New York LA San Francisco
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:54.080]  Tulia Texas little I mean just every town almost every town okay and and you've
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:57.400]  always got the goody-to-shoot cop who wonders why he's been on the force 20
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:02.160]  years and never moves up because you're a joke to them they're drug dealers okay
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:06.400]  I mean I don't know how to explain it to you but cops pull you over and say
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:13.080]  got any drugs in the car and I'm like you sell drugs leave me alone and boy once
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:16.840]  I started talking about it oh we're gonna kill you oh we're gonna they would
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:22.200]  pull me over and just once I was 16 and would say you are drinking and when I
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:26.800]  wasn't we're taking you to jail you or we'd pull up in a bonfire I wasn't even
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:30.880]  drinking had just gotten there okay you're being disorderly Jones we're
[02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:35.480]  taking you to jail and then again through a lawyer we were told you know
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:38.920]  they kill people in rock wall and they told us a few people they'd hung in the
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:42.240]  jail and they said your son's gonna be hung in the jail and my dad sold his
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:45.960]  general offices when we moved to Austin Texas so that's why I hear this stuff it
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:51.720]  really upsets me because because your naivete America is gonna let total
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:55.560]  evil take over because it's not enough the government deals drugs they deal
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:41:00.920]  little kids too you think Penn states anything that's normal in the circles
[02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:06.840]  of the elite okay you understand that now let's go back briefly to will in
[02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:13.120]  Texas go ahead will yeah and you know like I said it it sounds strange but
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:18.920]  but two things first of all I'm a reverend here in Houston oh that doesn't
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:24.120]  sound strange Co and tell pro spies on all pastors even if they work for the

[02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:49.160]  before my radio interview the first night I met her she got naked in a car in her
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:55.880]  car in the parking lot the first night well yeah the government run sir the
[02:41:55.880 --> 02:42:01.800]  government runs the hookers the escorts most times yeah no and believe me man

[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:09.640]  you what you're saying is true you sound like it's on the truth you're in a lot

[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:25.840]  and and and if you do go public they'll leave you alone okay put him on hold get

[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:33.720]  these big city preachers have got a string of hookers running them and sex
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:37.760]  operatives and they got a lot of the pastors running the drugs for them they
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:40.960]  I mean they've got to have the pastor stand down with the government snatching
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:49.000]  kids out of the congregation people are so naive Michael no we don't have time to
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.720]  go to calls yet I'm gonna have to skip this network break I've got to quit doing
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:58.960]  this I'm so out of control this is our little satire piece it's up at
[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:02.840]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com please help us get it out to everybody it's in
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:06.720]  the featured news section breaking bin Laden raid footage released by White
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:10.400]  House satire report and it's got like a cartoon part because you're gonna hear
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:13.840]  the audio where it shows a cartoon with bin Laden's head on it with predator
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:17.720]  drones dropping bombs on him it's really funny but then it goes into all the
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:21.640]  documentation that the bin Laden raid was fake it's all a fraud and we should
[02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:25.280]  rename them the new film zero dark Easter Bunny here is that report with
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:30.640]  Melissa Melton and Jakari Jackson. I'm Melissa Melton reporting for info wars
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:35.320]  nightly news zero dark 30 the film supposedly based on the true story
[02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:39.240]  official accounts of the killing of Osama bin Laden is set to release in US
[02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:47.800]  theaters December 19th we are still no closer to defeating our enemy 20 detainees
[02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:55.640]  recognize that photo. In analyzing the clip you just saw Jessica Chastain
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:44:00.640]  stars as CIA operative Maya a woman obsessed with capturing the man supposedly
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:05.000]  behind the September 11th terrorist attacks the New York film critics guide
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:10.240]  was apparently so moved they named zero dark 30 film of the year now let's
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:15.440]  analyze a clip of actual Osama bin Laden raid footage info wars.com has
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:19.840]  acquired this official White House approved raid footage so we bring to
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:25.440]  you now the world premiere of the Osama bin Laden raid.
[02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:33.720]  That's one of those little 19 cartoons, by the way zero dark 30 I've seen the trailer
[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:42.560]  looks like a made for TV movie, low budget, produced this whole thing themselves. They already tell the boy what to do but now they want to run it and be the
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:46.200]  movie stars themselves and it's just ridiculous. Actually we can't be sure if
[02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:50.520]  that's legitimate footage or not you see so much misinformation and disinfo came
[02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:53.640]  out in the wake of the raid that it's really hard to understand what's real or
[02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:58.280]  what's not anymore and really shouldn't the makers of zero dark 30 be concerned
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:02.960]  about the same thing. If you'll recall Osama bin Laden was supposedly taken down
[02:45:02.960 --> 02:45:08.200]  in a raid at a compound in Abbottabad in 2011. The death of bin Laden marks the
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:12.160]  most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda.
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:17.200]  President Obama addressed the nation late Sunday evening to say that just hours
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:21.840]  before Osama bin Laden had been killed in the middle of a major populated city
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:27.960]  in a palace compound. My friends this is a complete and total hoax and we
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:32.440]  predicted with total precision with inside sources going back more than
[02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:37.480]  eight years ago exactly what would happen. Then bin Laden's body was buried at
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:42.280]  sea all within 24 hours after the raid. Our government claimed his burial was
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:46.240]  per Islamic tradition but many Muslim scholars have come forward to point out
[02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:51.520]  that this like so much else in the official story is false. Over the years
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:56.040]  many people from intelligence analysts to heads of state including former
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:59.960]  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright former Pakistani Prime Minister
[02:45:59.960 --> 02:46:04.840]  Benazir Budo and former FBI head of counterterrorism Dale Watson have gone
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:10.720]  on record to say that bin Laden died in 2001. Dr. Steve Pechenik who has worked
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:14.960]  with five different US presidents and the Department of Defense has even come
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:20.040]  out to say that Osama bin Laden died in 2001 of Marfan syndrome a degenerative
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:25.560]  genetic disease with no permanent cure. With the intel with the CIA reports you
[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:28.960]  were reading with as much proof as you can give us without giving up your
[02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:34.360]  sources of knowing that bin Laden was dead and when he reportedly died
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:39.080]  so that we can look at the big news story now in context of why they've
[02:46:39.080 --> 02:46:46.520]  launched this this hoax today. Well let me just say the issue of why he was
[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:52.120]  dead it was exactly what I said before he died of Marfan syndrome. Bush Jr. knew
[02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:56.400]  about it. The intelligence community knew about it. He had Ellis Waheri who was
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:47:00.920]  a physician with him who is still a physician. I don't know where he is but
[02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:06.560]  we knew he was already dead by 9-11. In fact two separate high-level sources have
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:12.120]  told Alex Jones directly that not only was bin Laden dead since 2001 but his
[02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:16.340]  death would not be announced until the most politically opportune moment. This
[02:47:16.340 --> 02:47:23.480]  all came out right at the time that Obama's approval rating was dropping
[02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:27.560]  like a rock an all-time low this far into a president's administration as the
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:33.960]  dollars dropping as support for Iraq Afghanistan Libya and the drone attacks
[02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:38.960]  in Pakistan was imploding right as the Pakistanis were threatening to kick the
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:42.560]  US out of Pakistan and to kick their drones out. Right as this happens there's
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:48.400]  this big propaganda victory and what do they do? They take the body and throw it
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:52.680]  in the ocean they say do you really believe that no one is buying that. When
[02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:56.200]  the announcement finally came that Osama bin Laden was dead the White House
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:48:00.760]  changed its story so many times it was hard to keep anything straight. First the
[02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:06.040]  raid involved a 40 minute shootout then there was no shootout then only one
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:11.640]  unnamed man was armed then bin Laden was armed then he wasn't armed and it was
[02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:16.120]  reported that he used his wife as a human shield. To go along with the ever
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:20.840]  changing official story the White House also released a situation room photo
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:24.760]  depicting a grave President Obama and Hillary Clinton with her hand over her
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:30.160]  mouth supposedly watching the bin Laden raid live but CIA director Leon Panetta
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:34.360]  later admitted that wasn't possible as the live feed had been cut before the
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:38.800]  Navy SEAL team even went in. Speaking of the Navy SEALs that carried out the raid
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:41.960]  controversy intensified when our government announced that some members
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:46.560]  of SEAL Team 6 responsible for the raid died in a helicopter crash two months
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:51.480]  later. I have two sources inside the Army and I have another source inside the
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:57.320]  Marines a colonel who have confirmed and talked to members of the family of SEAL
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:03.640]  Team 6 that supposedly was shot down a few days ago over Kabul, Afghanistan that
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:09.800]  they were killed to shut them up about what they know about the staged raid on
[02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:14.000]  some of Bin Laden's compound. In the wake of the raid Disney even tried to
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:19.440]  copyright the name Navy SEAL Team 6. The situation room photo wasn't the only
[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:23.840]  photo proven a fraud either. A photograph the media pounced all over in the
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:28.520]  days following the raid reportedly of Bin Laden's body was also shown to be a
[02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:33.840]  manipulated fake. Multiple books were also released following the raid the
[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:37.680]  latest one published by a Navy SEAL who claimed his work was a first-hand boots
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:41.160]  on the ground account and that he witnessed Bin Laden's death with his
[02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:46.920]  own eyes. The publisher even claimed the book was not vetted by the Pentagon but
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:51.240]  as we witnessed with the arrest and detainment of Brandon Robb release of an
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:55.000]  unapproved book of this magnitude would garner a full-scale assault on its
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:50:00.280]  author. So let's recap 10 years later and the greatest manhunt in history as the
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:04.000]  movie puts it and we finally caught and killed the man responsible for one of
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:07.840]  the greatest crimes ever committed on US soil and yet we have no valid
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:14.360]  photographs and no conclusive proof. If you want a conspiracy theory to exist
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:20.200]  that's how you start it. The most elusive character on the face of the
[02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:25.880]  planet the most elusive human being the big foot of people and you catch them
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:30.800]  and kill them but yeah we we chucked them in the drink right away because we
[02:50:30.800 --> 02:50:34.600]  didn't want any more problems. The latest news to break on the Bin Laden raid
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:38.600]  came a few weeks ago when heavily redacted emails obtained through an
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:43.080]  Associated Press FOIA request revealed that no American sailors aboard the USS
[02:50:43.080 --> 02:50:47.520]  Carl Vinton had witnessed Bin Laden sea burial. Another email from the public
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:51.000]  affairs officer claimed that only a small group of the ship's leadership were
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:55.480]  even informed of the burial. Though the release of Zero Dark Thirty was delayed
[02:50:55.480 --> 02:50:59.560]  until after the presidential election supposedly to ward off accusations of a
[02:50:59.560 --> 02:51:03.320]  political agenda with a mountain of evidence showing we've never been given
[02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:07.200]  the full story here it's hard to think this movie has anything but a political
[02:51:07.200 --> 02:51:11.480]  agenda. So much propaganda was released following the Bin Laden raid it's
[02:51:11.480 --> 02:51:15.600]  unclear what really happened but saying this movie is based on a true story is
[02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:18.480]  a lot like saying Winnie the Pooh is based on a real-life bear named
[02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:22.800]  Winifred and a real-life little boy named Christopher Robin and yet I've never
[02:51:22.800 --> 02:51:27.520]  seen one talking tiger in real life. For Infowars Nightly News I'm Melissa
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:37.240]  Melton. All right great job Melissa you know it's even worse than what she says
[02:51:37.240 --> 02:51:40.960]  though and that's what happens every time I do a report it's always much worse
[02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:45.640]  than what we could even add to it that's what's so terrible about it people
[02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:49.160]  think I exaggerate most of the time it's it's not exaggeration it's it's that
[02:51:49.160 --> 02:51:55.720]  I'm underestimating because the White House is on record being involved in
[02:51:55.720 --> 02:52:02.840]  giving classified information classified baloney advisors the Pentagon this is
[02:52:02.840 --> 02:52:09.680]  the most integrated film ever into Hollywood production and you've got the
[02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:13.160]  folks that put out Hurt Locker and stuff that that's kind of the new mode
[02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:17.240]  where they don't just give them the script and pay them I mean it's on record
[02:52:17.240 --> 02:52:23.920]  there what's the number I saw a couple billion just for films in 2012 and 2008
[02:52:23.920 --> 02:52:28.240]  of taxpayer money to promote socialist healthcare so you're watching movies and
[02:52:28.240 --> 02:52:32.040]  wonder why they promote government-run healthcare and Obamacare by name your
[02:52:32.040 --> 02:52:37.280]  tax money paid that's like North Korea but they're not that slick where Nazi
[02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:40.960]  Germany did that with films Hitler was a master in Joseph Goebbels of having the
[02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:46.080]  films push the regime product placement propaganda placement they call it
[02:52:46.080 --> 02:52:49.880]  behavior placement I coined the term propaganda placement 15 years ago when
[02:52:49.880 --> 02:52:54.880]  there was no term and you add all the rest over 10 billion a year that we know
[02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:59.640]  about for paying the media it's one of the biggest secrets a lot of big talk
[02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:05.680]  stations on radio and TV have sponsored news and you're never told that we don't
[02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:09.240]  have sponsored news sometimes we have sponsors on occasionally pretty much
[02:53:09.240 --> 02:53:13.440]  rarely but you know where they have some info we want it's it's like 90% of it's
[02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:16.960]  not an infomercial but there is some of that and we don't do infomercials or to
[02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:19.880]  a few minutes already who does that but you know when you're like an hour and
[02:53:19.880 --> 02:53:22.240]  it's a sponsor it's because they're an interesting person and then they're a
[02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:24.960]  little bit about their thing at the end but we're transparent about that it's
[02:53:24.960 --> 02:53:30.720]  obvious I always say this is our sponsor they'll announce when news core
[02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:34.480]  reports on a Fox you know story or something or on Fox reports on that
[02:53:34.480 --> 02:53:38.080]  they'll tell people we're reporting on our parent company but when the
[02:53:38.080 --> 02:53:43.520]  government is involved paying off radio hosts TV hosts it's all come out just
[02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:49.720]  unbelievable amounts of money and they were keeping it secret remember when it
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:54.080]  came out with Bush paying half a million to this guy 240 something thousand of
[02:53:54.080 --> 02:54:02.200]  that guy but but the media only focused on personalities being paid let's shift
[02:54:02.200 --> 02:54:06.480]  gears we've been trying to feature stories here where police do the right
[02:54:06.480 --> 02:54:11.280]  thing where cops you know buy a guy a pair of shoes and it's not a PR stunt or
[02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:15.120]  where because we know it's not a PR stunt with the case in Albany New York with
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:18.480]  our reporters going up there our auxiliary reporter Jason Burmese and
[02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:21.400]  they tell you know the cop to throw him out and he goes well he's not
[02:54:21.400 --> 02:54:24.360]  interfering well give me his license well I can't if he isn't doing something
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:30.320]  wrong well and by the way that police officer did not get reprimanded he got
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:32.880]  commended by that sheriff's department that sounds like a pretty good sheriff's
[02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:37.080]  department I mean look just don't treat law-abiding citizens like scum and tell
[02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:40.560]  us we're in North Korea and can't do stuff when you're not interfering sure
[02:54:40.560 --> 02:54:43.280]  you can't go back in the checkpoint and get into what they're doing but you can
[02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:48.420]  be back there filming they're filming you so we try and we're looking for good
[02:54:48.420 --> 02:54:52.120]  things police are doing okay because we want to model good behavior and not
[02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:56.080]  just be one-sided bashing police here because that compacts cops more into
[02:54:56.080 --> 02:55:00.880]  their gang culture but I've seen countless videos and I've done reports on
[02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:06.960]  this before going to people's houses where cops busted in a no-knock raid for
[02:55:06.960 --> 02:55:12.080]  marijuana or whatever and didn't find it in one case I covered the lab is in the
[02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:17.520]  kitchen chained up so he doesn't go out the dog door doesn't even bark and they
[02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:20.640]  just kill it and let me tell you that creeps me out that if they ever swat
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:26.080]  team me for something made up or do one of those things where they somebody
[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:31.000]  calls in you know spoof your numbers as Megan I won't call a felony call you
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:34.080]  know a hostage call or something and they're gonna kill my chihuahua they'll
[02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:36.880]  kill my French Bulldogs I know they'll kill French Bulldogs because they look
[02:55:36.880 --> 02:55:40.960]  scary but that's a joke but it's not people on hiking bike trail you know
[02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:45.840]  they weigh like 25 30 pounds oh they just see a bulldog and this was a bull
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:50.160]  terrier really sweet dog it did live it's out of the vet just the police admit
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:52.760]  the dog walked out behind the guy when they were giving him a ticket and when
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:56.120]  they shot his dog they still gave him the ticket in Chicago but here's the
[02:55:56.120 --> 02:56:01.640]  big story now and this is a Fox piece we're about to play a clip of here now
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:05.480]  the police came to try to intimidate the owner here's a clip of that right now
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:12.440]  he's covered in blood and he said the cops shot the dog a Fox 32 exclusive
[02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:16.280]  tonight a Northside family furious over what they claim was an unjustified
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:20.420]  police shooting good evening everyone I'm Robin Robinson and I'm Bob Surratt the
[02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:24.440]  shooting happened Saturday in a quiet residential neighborhood the dog was off
[02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:28.480]  the leash but its owners say it never posed a threat now the owners say they
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:32.360]  are getting heat from police for telling us their story Fox 32 is Larry
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:36.560]  yelling with exclusive details tonight Larry Bob and Robin residents of the
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:40.600]  Northside Buena Park neighborhood are still upset tonight not just because
[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:44.680]  police shot the puppy they all knew as the Colonel but also because the
[02:56:44.680 --> 02:56:48.360]  shooting occurred not far from a preschool on a street where pedestrians
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:55.120]  including children could have been hurt meet Colonel Phillips a seven-month-old
[02:56:55.120 --> 02:56:59.680]  miniature bull terrier whose father was a champion show dog and whose owners
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:04.280]  hoped one day would be a show dog himself they looked like spuds Mackenzie
[02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:09.600]  you see in the Target ad one of those for the miniatures but on Saturday
[02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:13.640]  afternoon the Colonel became a target himself that pink belly shot by a
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:18.800]  Chicago police officer in front of his owners gated Northside home gated police
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:22.840]  were writing a parking ticket for a van belonging to Al Phillips the dog's owner
[02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:28.080]  so Phillips came out to move the vehicle my little bull terrier followed me
[02:57:28.080 --> 02:57:36.120]  out then and all I had boom boom two shots you shot the dog one eyewitness
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:40.080]  Charlene Dezagle told us she heard the officer warn Phillips about the dog
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:44.120]  being loose but the officer never sounded like he was in danger all of a
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:49.320]  sudden I heard him say get your dog and then the next statement was get your
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:54.560]  dog and then he just pulled out his gun and shot twice Morgan Phillips Al's
[02:57:54.560 --> 02:58:00.360]  daughter rushed the dog to an emergency vet he needed a five-hour surgery they
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:06.520]  took shrapnel out of his stomach he had a shell casing in his leg it lacerated
[02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:10.600]  the muscle we were gonna show him but we can't know while I interviewed the
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:15.400]  dog's owners I saw two police officers drive by 90 minutes later they were back
[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:21.080]  asking Phillips why he had contacted the media and then giving Phillips a ticket
[02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:25.400]  for not keeping the Colonel on a lease unbelievable that's enough folks this is
[02:58:25.400 --> 02:58:30.000]  the this is the mafia thugism hey bud hey Mack what you call the media when
