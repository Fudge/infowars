[00:00.000 --> 00:12.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.520 --> 00:21.320]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.320 --> 00:39.280]  well it's our next to last live transmission of 2010 thank you for joining us I'm going to
[00:39.280 --> 00:44.720]  attempt to focus and cover all of this news in front of me coming up in the next segment
[00:44.720 --> 00:53.560]  then we have Lou Rockwell of lourockwell.com coming on to talk about the economy the TSA the
[00:53.560 --> 01:01.600]  political conflict of the rise of liberty in the face of the accelerating tyranny his forecast
[01:01.600 --> 01:06.920]  where he sees that going of course former chief of staff for Ron Paul and much more Lou Rockwell
[01:06.920 --> 01:11.520]  and then Jim Mars haven't had him on in a while probably a year or something love Jim Mars we're
[01:11.520 --> 01:18.360]  gonna have him on on the same issues the economy world events new 9-11 information will take your
[01:18.360 --> 01:25.280]  phone calls when both men join us today Lou Rockwell and Jim Mars coming up today should be
[01:25.280 --> 01:33.440]  extremely informative talk radio I have the economic stack I have the anorexia stack here
[01:33.440 --> 01:39.280]  that's big in the news with the model that they used to advertise against anorexia dying
[01:39.280 --> 01:46.600]  and that ties into this whole culture of brainwashing and all these illnesses that are
[01:46.600 --> 01:52.600]  basically being generated by television mind control all these new mental illnesses will
[01:52.600 --> 01:58.240]  also get into the White House agenda for this year and next year they're promising to go
[01:58.240 --> 02:01.840]  ahead with the global warming taxes they're promising to go ahead with the government
[02:01.840 --> 02:07.760]  health care and the death panels and that all on the heels of this headline swede told he had
[02:07.760 --> 02:14.800]  cancer and forced to have his genitals his penis removed amputated following a year of
[02:14.800 --> 02:20.280]  misdiagnosis and this is standard eugenics standard death panel they know you got cancer
[02:20.280 --> 02:24.880]  they tell you go ahead and go until it's too late and it kills you and they've been caught in
[02:24.880 --> 02:29.960]  England doing this they've been caught all over Europe doing and here's another example I've seen
[02:29.960 --> 02:34.400]  Tony Blair back when he was Prime Minister admitted in the House of Commons that people have a
[02:34.400 --> 02:39.280]  brain tumor that's almost 100% operable if it's done in the first few months they'll make them
[02:39.280 --> 02:46.720]  wait a year and a half and they die so you got Bill Gates you know admitting that that this is
[02:46.720 --> 02:51.760]  what this is all about and the average person just can't get their mind around it because it's so
[02:51.760 --> 02:58.080]  diabolical I thought we'd look at that also we're looking at the economy at the fact that
[02:58.080 --> 03:05.440]  government can't and won't and never does protect you when there's big events whether it's Katrina
[03:06.560 --> 03:11.840]  or the situation that we're seeing right now in the Northeast now a week into being completely
[03:11.840 --> 03:17.760]  snowed in and a lot of deaths being generated by this and the government's too busy out there
[03:17.760 --> 03:22.800]  still writing tickets though I've got reports they're still getting tickets squeezing the
[03:22.800 --> 03:27.760]  petty slaves but hey you're stuck nine hours having a baby begging for help in the middle
[03:27.760 --> 03:31.680]  of downtown they're not going to come help you the baby's going to die because there's some money
[03:31.680 --> 03:36.960]  needs to be raised to pay those offshore banks of course they tell the cops hey we're going bankrupt
[03:36.960 --> 03:41.200]  you got to squeeze to get more money for your paycheck never explain to the police that the
[03:41.200 --> 03:45.760]  lion share of the money is going offshore now that's how this psychology works with government
[03:45.760 --> 03:51.520]  minions across the board and the same thing's happened in countless third world nations the
[03:51.520 --> 03:56.240]  taxes go up and up the regulations go up and up and up always in the name of keeping the government
[03:56.240 --> 04:02.880]  afloat when it's designed to implode the government into abject total poverty and debt that can never
[04:02.880 --> 04:08.880]  be paid back I keep seeing news articles about oh can the feds stave off total depression
[04:11.040 --> 04:18.160]  I mean can can Satan save your soul this is designed on record to give them all the power
[04:18.160 --> 04:23.120]  and the money it's designed to wreck the economy and I know as an audience you know that you've
[04:23.120 --> 04:27.120]  seen their quotes their statements the plans they've written up but the media now is starting to
[04:27.120 --> 04:33.840]  admit we're in a depression but they're saying the answer is the bankers they will save us they're
[04:33.840 --> 04:39.360]  they're trying they're they're working hard they they're very loving people and they've got your
[04:39.360 --> 04:46.800]  best interest at heart and if you believe that well I'll be happy to sell you Saturn or the moon
[04:46.800 --> 04:54.160]  or any other constellation you wish we'll be right back stay with us
[05:01.680 --> 05:07.280]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance
[05:07.280 --> 05:12.480]  to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[05:12.480 --> 05:18.240]  underneath the Americans at home have turned men's influence on our president in congress
[05:18.240 --> 05:24.400]  and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens
[05:24.400 --> 05:29.920]  to pay attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore
[05:29.920 --> 05:35.440]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[05:35.440 --> 05:40.560]  Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[05:40.560 --> 05:45.680]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC

[08:23.280 --> 08:28.720]  blue rock well live today i'm going to dive straight into the news uh but there's a story
[08:28.720 --> 08:35.920]  up at prison planet dot com by steve watson naked wheelchair protester targeted by tsa
[08:35.920 --> 08:42.240]  over buttocks agent single out woman who stood up to airport tyranny banning her from flying
[08:43.520 --> 08:48.800]  they're now saying when she tries to fly again that her buttocks look strange and maybe a mom
[08:48.800 --> 08:59.200]  and she can't fly uh you really cannot make this type of stuff up uh that's what news six in
[08:59.200 --> 09:04.160]  oklahoma city is reporting that they say that the unusual contour of her buttocks area she's
[09:04.160 --> 09:09.680]  now banned from flying for the shape of her buttocks now this is not a joke it sounds ridiculous it
[09:09.680 --> 09:17.520]  sounds crazy it's designed to be crazy this is psychological warfare when they can set the precedent
[09:17.520 --> 09:23.440]  to do bizarre things like say if you support ron paul you may be a terrorist and you're going to be
[09:23.440 --> 09:30.400]  spied on uh when the government can arrest uh students for having ludens cough drops that
[09:31.680 --> 09:35.360]  aren't even over the counter they're not even a drug they're a candy
[09:37.760 --> 09:43.440]  when they set the precedent to arrest you if you bring a plastic knife to put butter on your bread
[09:43.440 --> 09:53.680]  this quote zero tolerance is about not using your own individual mind in determinations it's
[09:53.680 --> 09:59.440]  about government minions corporate minions fully submitting to whatever corporate or government
[09:59.440 --> 10:06.400]  culture that they're basically put into but i have the mainstream news here uh the tsa says
[10:06.400 --> 10:12.560]  that the contour of the buttocks is not going to be allowed so now in the body scan if they don't
[10:12.560 --> 10:16.960]  like the shape of your body uh we also have mainstream reports and i hate to talk about
[10:16.960 --> 10:22.400]  things like this but i mean i'm not normally into uh like i'm never into potty humor and things like
[10:22.400 --> 10:29.840]  that but but i mean it's it's not humor it's it's it's serious um they are now singling women out
[10:29.840 --> 10:41.040]  and asking them and touching and asking what feminine uh menstrual uh things are and it's all
[10:41.040 --> 10:47.200]  about you being trained that something's wrong with you your bad government is good and their legions
[10:47.200 --> 10:52.800]  their armies of bureaucrats there are god and again this has all been on record that they'd
[10:52.800 --> 10:57.200]  have face scanning cameras up nationwide and license plate reading cameras up nationwide and
[10:57.200 --> 11:03.360]  worldwide that everything we're doing is being tracked in real time it's all illegal violations
[11:03.360 --> 11:08.720]  of federal and state law the government doesn't care they are setting the precedent to just break
[11:08.720 --> 11:15.760]  every law under the sun while creating new laws for the american people in fact jaren i had you
[11:15.760 --> 11:20.880]  repull it yesterday and i never got to it i want to cover those 14 things that show how americans

[12:25.280 --> 12:31.280]  tele screens bossing us around and spying on your neighbors and just just just just wall to wall
[12:31.280 --> 12:36.000]  super tyranny out in the open they're just right up in our face saying this is the way it is and we
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.640]  don't care what you think and they're going to take your pension funds everything i mean they're
[12:42.240 --> 12:47.200]  we haven't even gone into the tyranny yet this whole grid's being put in place to rob everybody

[12:52.640 --> 12:57.360]  they're going to worship government even more it will become even more religious to lick boots
[12:57.360 --> 13:03.920]  to prostrate yourself before tyranny in a uniform it is just going to be total degradation of the
[13:03.920 --> 13:10.400]  human spirit because america is being judged america loves the blood of 51 million dead babies
[13:10.400 --> 13:17.040]  and now america is going to literally sink into hell now on the other side of this
[13:17.040 --> 13:22.480]  by the way i was reading last night in fact i wanted i printed it in erin's office um
[13:23.200 --> 13:32.240]  there's a new show on mtv where they glorify how great and modern and cool and stylish abortion is
[13:32.240 --> 13:37.520]  for your average 13 year old that's the average age is about 13 and a half and the demographics
[13:37.520 --> 13:43.760]  for some of the redstone's mtv and parents put their children in front of it learning how cool
[13:43.760 --> 13:54.960]  abortion is it's so cool just like the national geographic had a big article about how cool it is
[13:54.960 --> 14:03.200]  that they have total tyranny in singapore i mean the whole article is just like man it is awesome
[14:04.240 --> 14:10.080]  and the first photograph of the article is a giant 1984 telescreen with a soldier on it with
[14:10.080 --> 14:16.160]  with everyone arrayed before it with a high-tech all-seeing eye above them in fact let me just
[14:16.160 --> 14:20.960]  show it to tv viewers if you don't believe me i mean it's just everywhere they are just selling
[14:20.960 --> 14:26.880]  pure evil torture secret arrest every form of corruption is just being flaunted in our face
[14:26.880 --> 14:33.520]  but then all over the nation federal uh federally funded checkpoints taking blood without warrants
[14:34.560 --> 14:38.320]  it's now going nationwide as we told you it would just like we told you tsa would go
[14:38.320 --> 14:43.760]  into the streets just like we because it's all public going back to this january 2010 issue
[14:43.760 --> 14:50.080]  that just came across last week um of national geographic they've got the um they've got the
[14:50.080 --> 15:03.200]  photo here the the the opening photo in the article about the singapore model and it is
[15:03.200 --> 15:09.600]  pure 1984 and then the whole article is about how great it is there it is all seeing eye with a
[15:09.600 --> 15:16.480]  soldier in the middle of it with everyone arrayed before it uh and they describe it as horrible
[15:16.480 --> 15:21.200]  but wonderful like splitting your wrist and getting into a hot bath and the population
[15:21.200 --> 15:24.800]  has the lowest reproduction rate in the world and how wonderful that is now they're all dying
[15:25.760 --> 15:31.360]  i mean it's just it's just wonderful just totally wonderful and of course how great
[15:31.360 --> 15:37.120]  the medical tyranny is being scanned on the streets and how you're executed for nothing and
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.640]  just how good and how great this guy is how he says we're all just animals and a social engineering
[15:42.640 --> 15:50.800]  control grid and that we want tyranny he's the minister mentor lee kwan you oh it's so good
[15:51.600 --> 15:55.760]  and how great it is that they're bringing in foreigners replace the dying population of a
[15:55.760 --> 16:04.160]  global plan as the model for the entire globe oh it's so good it's so good just total sickness
[16:05.600 --> 16:07.200]  selling death as good
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.280]  now continuing here um almost everything is a crime in america now 14 of the most
[16:15.280 --> 16:19.760]  ridiculous things that americans are being arrested for and since i read this article a few days ago
[16:19.760 --> 16:25.360]  and and i and i remember all the articles they linked to and this is the 14 examples i i
[16:25.360 --> 16:29.840]  instantly just this week had probably seen 20 30 things far worse than even what's in this article
[16:29.840 --> 16:35.920]  i mean it's far worse doesn't seem like almost everything's becoming a crime in america now
[16:35.920 --> 16:40.960]  americans are being arrested and charged with crimes for doing things like leaving dog poop on
[16:40.960 --> 16:47.760]  the ground opening up christmas presents early not recycling uh properly uh passing gas in class
[16:47.760 --> 16:53.920]  or having brown lawns but it is healthy for our society for the police to be involved in such
[16:53.920 --> 16:58.320]  silly things it's not silly it's training you that they're in your business that telescreens are
[16:58.320 --> 17:02.960]  bossing you when you're at checkout lines that they are going to intrude on you and that that's the
[17:02.960 --> 17:08.480]  way it is every single day in the united states inches closer to becoming a totalitarian society
[17:08.480 --> 17:13.680]  i got news for you they're still free speech limited but everything else is already gone
[17:13.680 --> 17:20.160]  that the second amendment they're coming after that while there are some that would welcome the
[17:20.160 --> 17:24.240]  shift the truth is that throughout history the societies that have experienced the greatest
[17:24.240 --> 17:29.440]  economic prosperity have all had at least a certain level of freedom businesses thrive when
[17:29.440 --> 17:34.320]  people feel free to live and work but see they don't want competition they want to consolidate
[17:34.320 --> 17:38.320]  when a good see they want to shut down travel they want to shut down tourism they admit that's
[17:38.320 --> 17:44.000]  their plan when a government tightens the grip too much many people just start shutting down
[17:44.000 --> 17:49.440]  that's exactly what they want just like places like north korea even though the rest of the world
[17:49.440 --> 17:53.920]  is sending them huge amounts of food starvation is still quite common in the totalitarian regime
[17:54.880 --> 18:00.960]  yeah i just wanted to add to that uh that you know for the average brain-numbed zombie that
[18:00.960 --> 18:05.120]  believes the police state's good and and it thinks that what's happening in america is good
[18:05.120 --> 18:11.280]  democrats who didn't like it now that obama's in they love it republicans that loved it under
[18:11.280 --> 18:16.800]  bush now that obama's here they don't like the police state because they they think that if their
[18:16.800 --> 18:22.000]  party's in it's somehow good your party it's bought and paid for by offshore banks grow up
[18:23.760 --> 18:28.640]  you understand it's almost too late it's too late if you keep sucking your thumbs for for
[18:28.640 --> 18:33.520]  new listeners out there who are laughing right now it isn't funny tyranny isn't funny history
[18:33.520 --> 18:43.680]  isn't funny and it just goes on to talk about the totalitarianism and how we're becoming that
[18:44.400 --> 18:49.520]  now now let's go into the 14 points they point out number one a michigan man has been charged

[33:25.920 --> 33:33.280]  tyranny i mean if i had to compare this tyranny to a type of liquor i'd be 10 000 proof it's just
[33:33.280 --> 33:39.360]  over the top there's a massive offensive going against every form of freedom there's all this
[33:39.360 --> 33:45.440]  propaganda about how much the government loves us and how great it is and they're clearly
[33:45.440 --> 33:51.600]  targeting good members of society we're seen as the milk cows we're seen as the bank tellers
[33:51.600 --> 33:58.560]  being robbed by these people it's the same deal political power goes out of a barrel of a gun as
[33:58.560 --> 34:05.920]  malice tongue said and the system knows that continuing here with these 14 uh pieces of
[34:05.920 --> 34:12.960]  police state news a few years ago a 70 year old grandma was actually put in handcuffs and hauled
[34:12.960 --> 34:18.160]  off to jail for having a brown lawn i see those articles every few days now why in the world anyone
[34:18.160 --> 34:24.560]  approve of police arresting ordinary americans for such things it seems like ever since 911 the whole
[34:24.560 --> 34:32.000]  country has gotten security fever it's not security i mean the number one threat to human
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.720]  liberty and history is government what about security against that that's what the united
[34:36.720 --> 34:42.000]  states was founded on was keeping government small keeping it under the confines of the
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.280]  constitution and bill of rights that's why america was special and then you get the internal
[34:47.280 --> 34:54.720]  homeland security and fbi memorandums and they're obsessed with attacking constitutionalist because
[34:54.720 --> 35:02.560]  we're the real americans we're being demonized and in many cases set up and hunted down many times
[35:02.560 --> 35:09.920]  the feds have tried to set us up it's i mean it's just incredible how many things they've
[35:09.920 --> 35:17.760]  tried to link us to bombings of the fire bombing of the governor's mansion police shootings i mean
[35:17.760 --> 35:26.560]  it's just ongoing because the interests that control this nation are far beyond evil evil is
[35:26.560 --> 35:35.920]  not enough of a word for these wicked ne'er-do-wells and it's like a bad dream people incrementally
[35:35.920 --> 35:43.040]  accept that until now we just accept anything all right i've been ranting on that subject let me
[35:43.040 --> 35:47.040]  get into the latest police state news that was just one little article from this week here's just
[35:47.040 --> 35:53.760]  the stuff in the last few days now here's why i get frustrated if i just come up here and say oh
[35:53.760 --> 35:59.840]  for two years they've been doing warrantless checkpoints taking blood from drivers people
[35:59.840 --> 36:05.040]  think well that's where you live that's austin there's the whole backstory to that now let me
[36:05.040 --> 36:11.040]  break it down bill clinton signed an executive order right when he got into office in 1994
[36:12.480 --> 36:18.640]  and there's a video of myself protesting and being arrested in 1997 in the article dealing
[36:18.640 --> 36:27.760]  with us today mandatory dui checkpoint blood test coming to florida and in the curt nemo
[36:27.760 --> 36:36.080]  article it breaks it all down and links to the mainstream news articles like news 10 no refusal
[36:36.080 --> 36:45.360]  dui checkpoint could be coming to tampa and at the bottom of it is the video from 13 years ago
[36:45.360 --> 36:50.880]  where i exposed what was going to unfold and happen and i read the executive order from
[36:50.880 --> 36:57.120]  whitehouse.gov where they went ahead and put it on the books now it's not really law but they
[36:57.120 --> 37:05.920]  enforce it is law and it said to get a driver's license uh you will be blood-jested uh at a clinic
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.600]  whenever the government sees fit now they hadn't put those in until this year in dc
[37:12.720 --> 37:18.720]  they announced oh we'll give you a discount on your driver's license if you give us blood
[37:20.400 --> 37:24.720]  that came out what a month ago listeners freaked out when that came out well it's already on the
[37:24.720 --> 37:29.200]  books but how do they introduce it oh just give us some blood we'll give you money that's to get
[37:29.200 --> 37:34.800]  the clinic in to get the staff trained that it's normal it's all dog training you're all seen as
[37:34.800 --> 37:42.960]  animals by these people just as the singapore model you know says we're animals in the state are the
[37:43.520 --> 37:53.120]  master controllers are our social controllers and now they're going to roll it out now i happen to
[37:53.120 --> 37:57.280]  have researched the whole backstory of this is a lot bigger than just warrantless blood checkpoints
[37:57.280 --> 38:00.960]  the feds have announced and under international agreements they're putting into motion
[38:00.960 --> 38:06.640]  that if you get pulled over for speeding they're going to take a thumbprint and a tissue swab they
[38:06.640 --> 38:10.880]  found that's less invasive than blood draws with a swab inside your mouth that will be put in a
[38:10.880 --> 38:15.600]  database and they're pushing to put that into place that's what the tsa is about getting you
[38:15.600 --> 38:23.040]  used to answering questions having hands put on you only people that are accustomed to that
[38:23.040 --> 38:29.760]  are serious ex-cons you're learning how to be a prisoner and by the way it's in the australian
[38:29.760 --> 38:34.080]  news parents are complaining in fact we pulled that from the article two days ago parents complaining
[38:34.080 --> 38:38.480]  about police state hospitals everybody who has a baby now in australia it's the same thing here
[38:38.480 --> 38:43.680]  now they come in they interrogate you they treat you as if you're an abuser you're bad and the
[38:43.680 --> 38:50.480]  headline was child protective services australia all parents are liars and the parents the courts
[38:50.480 --> 38:55.760]  are even complaining because it's happening to judges and people everybody you know one's exempt
[38:55.760 --> 39:02.000]  are saying you know the hospitals are now prisons that was the quote of course they
[39:02.000 --> 39:08.400]  are prisons this whole world is a prison planet in the building that's why we have prison planet
[39:08.400 --> 39:18.800]  dot com we're fighting the construction of the prison planet now going over the back store this
[39:18.800 --> 39:23.840]  is why when i read an article it does a disservice that's why i can't ever get to much of the news
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.200]  because i have to spend all my time on just a few things because i don't have time to get
[39:27.200 --> 39:32.400]  everything else if i just read an article about police want to stop drunk drivers uh and they're
[39:32.400 --> 39:42.000]  going to take blood from you uh at uh warrantless checkpoints people can ignore that or they can
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.080]  say well i don't like drunk drivers it has nothing to do with drunk drivers it's about
[39:46.080 --> 39:52.800]  medicalizing cadres of police to a violate the fourth amendment and to be be medically trained
[39:52.800 --> 39:58.480]  to extract blood and it's all on record just like i told you they were going to start putting tsa on
[39:58.480 --> 40:03.280]  the streets eight years ago i saw governor ridge say that was the plan you'll have an id card to
[40:03.280 --> 40:09.520]  leave your house to have a job people keep saying alex how do you predict all this they're telling us
[40:09.520 --> 40:15.840]  see that's what i want to get across to you this is not my opinion they're training the cops
[40:15.840 --> 40:21.040]  they're putting the federal fusion centers they're federalizing things illegally they're just rolling
[40:21.040 --> 40:31.040]  all of this out so they put on the books this executive order to take blood at to get a driver's
[40:31.040 --> 40:36.080]  license which again will be a national id card and now is one under the real id you have to have it
[40:36.080 --> 40:41.280]  to have a job so you got to give them your blood to have a job you don't submit properly now you
[40:41.280 --> 40:46.000]  can't fly you don't submit properly now your band from driving you don't submit properly now you
[40:46.000 --> 40:55.040]  can't leave your neighborhood i mean mit and the pentagon admit this is their plan i brought mit
[40:55.040 --> 41:00.880]  magazine in here years ago and showed it to you where they i mean this is diabolical you notice
[41:00.880 --> 41:06.320]  five years ago in felucia they face scan the entire population i have it on video with tom
[41:06.320 --> 41:13.520]  brokaw saying if they're caught without their id cards they are executed on the spot see they're
[41:13.520 --> 41:18.240]  practicing the evil out in the open now they've enrolled the troops in the same system now you're
[41:18.240 --> 41:23.040]  enrolled in it to get a driver's license see everything that's done to the iraqis is for us
[41:23.600 --> 41:28.960]  in fact the pentagon admits it's all a laboratory on how to control populations and they admit
[41:28.960 --> 41:34.800]  the system they developed for the us through mit that they call a control grid the grid
[41:34.800 --> 41:42.160]  is now a control grid that they're using in iraq so they learn from both angles now
[41:44.880 --> 41:49.440]  all over the country the feds have paid to put face scanning cameras in license plate reading
[41:49.440 --> 41:55.680]  cameras 15 years ago now they're announcing it now they're letting the slaves know now they're
[41:55.680 --> 42:00.480]  wiring it into the local federalization center known as threat fusion centers with cia openly
[42:00.480 --> 42:06.720]  in there illegally all illegal everything they're doing is illegal they don't care remember these
[42:06.720 --> 42:15.680]  are criminals and they laugh it's funny and when i was in the dmv 13 years ago with the state police
[42:15.680 --> 42:22.480]  handing out the executive order that this was part of a national id card plan implemented by stealth
[42:22.480 --> 42:27.840]  and that was part of a dna database system and i also exposed that they were taking babies blood
[42:27.840 --> 42:35.520]  and the i was handing out the executive order and the cops were just going it was so funny
[42:35.520 --> 42:41.440]  that i was giving them an executive order it was it was so funny because see 13 years ago
[42:41.440 --> 42:48.080]  we're going to take blood look at this crazy guy they were just i mean it's all on video they were
[42:48.080 --> 42:55.440]  just it was so funny 13 years later they're like absolutely we're going to take blood absolutely
[42:55.440 --> 42:59.600]  we absolutely we got face scanning cameras absolutely we got license plate readers
[43:00.960 --> 43:06.160]  absolutely the cia's in our command center we got photo cutter now i'm like oh here's all your
[43:06.160 --> 43:12.320]  internal training manuals it's really for gun owners well you are a threat see how they go from
[43:12.320 --> 43:22.960]  laughing at us i mean their faces would turn red they were see because they've been brainwashed
[43:22.960 --> 43:26.880]  by the television and the culture i don't mean that figuratively i mean literally to have a
[43:26.880 --> 43:32.800]  psychological trigger compulsion to laugh at things that they deep down know are true because
[43:32.800 --> 43:38.160]  they're scared so it's a defense mechanism now it's here all admitted now they're ready to roll it
[43:38.160 --> 43:42.240]  out because they beta tested it and completed it and the cops are like you bet we're going to do it so
[43:42.240 --> 43:46.640]  this is about a global dna database and if you don't believe that we've covered all the evidence
[43:46.640 --> 43:54.080]  in the past it's in my films but just look at the babies 39 years ago worldwide in every industrialized
[43:54.080 --> 44:00.000]  nation a un program was implemented to take blood from all babies at birth for bio weapons
[44:00.000 --> 44:07.440]  developments also the patent key proteins and dna strands and now it's all been announced a secret
[44:07.440 --> 44:13.280]  39 year program globally we're in a global government the same programs we have are the same
[44:13.280 --> 44:19.600]  programs they have under the same names in england australia germany japan this is all master controlled
[44:19.600 --> 44:31.680]  okay they are out in the open this is continuity of agenda so continuing
[44:34.240 --> 44:38.240]  it violates the fourth amendment it trains the police to violate it they're taking your blood
[44:38.240 --> 44:44.240]  and this is how they phase it in two and a half years ago they started doing warrantless checkpoints
[44:45.120 --> 44:51.040]  but to phase it in they said well a judge signs a master warrant and court said you can't do that
[44:52.480 --> 44:58.640]  that's not a real warrant doctors refuse to take the blood without warrants nurses refuse to take it
[44:59.840 --> 45:03.520]  the police started refusing to take it but they can always find people in the force that are stupid
[45:03.520 --> 45:10.640]  and will i remember this nine years ago in arizona and uh colorada we first started seeing it and i
[45:10.640 --> 45:19.360]  would have denver post articles on air and two sun articles uh and and people were calling saying i
[45:19.360 --> 45:24.560]  was lying because back then we weren't simulcast on you know web video they they wouldn't go check
[45:24.560 --> 45:30.640]  the article they just say i was lying see nine years ago people couldn't believe that the federal
[45:30.640 --> 45:37.040]  pilot was already going on with federal money now just two and a half years ago the state comes in
[45:37.040 --> 45:42.560]  and says you can't do that and people all thought it was art ace of veda doing it well i did some
[45:42.560 --> 45:46.480]  research on art ace of veda after he'd been a guest a few times on air and it turns out there's
[45:46.480 --> 45:53.280]  a special federal board that recommended him when he was in the highway patrol and took him to austin
[45:53.280 --> 45:59.360]  and made him chief and that most police chiefs in big cities are put in by the feds and i learned
[45:59.360 --> 46:04.560]  about that when i noticed uh this year the feds recommended him for the uh dalis police chief
[46:04.560 --> 46:09.760]  they recommended three he was the second choice dalis took the number one choice
[46:09.760 --> 46:14.480]  so the feds tell the city you got three choices here they are now you'll notice these federal
[46:14.480 --> 46:19.360]  police chiefs and i have no doubt ace of veda's definitely black ops i mean most big police chiefs
[46:19.360 --> 46:26.640]  are cia uh even the former you know uh police chief of la darrell gates admitted that years ago
[46:26.640 --> 46:33.280]  so that he was involved with the cia so we've got cia agents over us from the federal government
[46:33.920 --> 46:41.440]  and they roll it out and the state rules that the red light cameras are illegal he puts them in
[46:41.440 --> 46:47.280]  anyways uh the state says these checkpoints are illegal he keeps doing it because he's got full
[46:47.280 --> 46:53.600]  federal backing see i don't get to have an austin nighter somebody from texas is my police chief
[46:53.600 --> 46:57.760]  no i get to have somebody who was brought up in a communist state of cuba over me
[47:00.080 --> 47:02.880]  and when the cbc came to interview me to get a
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.920]  license to be able to film in the city of austin there's no law but they just do it
[47:08.480 --> 47:13.520]  the austin police said you don't want to go interview alex jones and the guy was shocked
[47:13.520 --> 47:19.120]  by what they said about me but wouldn't go into detail a professional big cbc you know producer
[47:19.120 --> 47:27.360]  sat right there interviewing me and after the interview started crying and said well i'm not
[47:27.360 --> 47:34.240]  going to get into it the point is that because they've got humanity see people who have brains
[47:34.240 --> 47:40.160]  folks know we're going to nazi germany so you think it's fun living in a city where uh you know
[47:40.160 --> 47:48.000]  we've got this nice glad handing very charismatic devil in art ace of eta now you expand on all of
[47:48.000 --> 47:57.440]  this feds police enforce mandatory blood test at florida checkpoints and you know the big issue
[47:57.440 --> 48:03.040]  here is these are federal grants they admit it going in all over the country no refusal
[48:03.040 --> 48:06.480]  no fourth amendment no probable cause we're going to take your blood
[48:09.120 --> 48:13.360]  we're going to take your blood and we're going to do it to protect you from the drunk drivers
[48:13.360 --> 48:19.200]  baloney here's another one illustrating what i'm talking about
[48:21.840 --> 48:27.600]  terrorist watch list one tip now enough to put name in database official say
[48:28.960 --> 48:36.320]  and they admit that one person ever calls into a tip line on you you're in the terror database
[48:36.320 --> 48:40.960]  and maybe denied flying traveling you name it no judge no jury and then if you're on the no fly
[48:40.960 --> 48:47.680]  you're on a no gun by they're trying to push through i mean you get this is classic authoritarianism
[48:47.680 --> 48:53.840]  internal passport behavior and they say they've got to do it because the nigerian man tried to
[48:53.840 --> 48:57.680]  blow up a detroit bound airliner and then they don't ever tell you here it's on record the u.s
[48:57.680 --> 49:02.240]  government helped him get on the plane and protected him see they never tell you the feds blew up
[49:02.240 --> 49:06.400]  oklahoma city and were caught red handed they never tell you that it's like oh we got to do it
[49:06.400 --> 49:11.520]  because this this idiot they drugged up and put on the plane the witnesses all said he was disheveled
[49:11.520 --> 49:18.800]  look drugged sharp-dressed man with you know no uh passport or nothing gets him on the plane
[49:19.600 --> 49:24.080]  security gets him on the plane the uh state department admits they were ordered to help
[49:24.080 --> 49:30.560]  him get on the plane but i'll just ignore all that and the news keeps saying they put the
[49:30.560 --> 49:35.600]  scanners in because of the christmas day bombing a year ago they already ordered him the year before
[49:37.840 --> 49:43.360]  i mean these are all pr rollouts in front of everyone can't you see it it's like even news we
[49:43.360 --> 49:50.800]  committed that 44 000 us troops 18 000 british troops two aircraft carriers all masked in the
[49:50.800 --> 49:57.760]  two months before 9 11 in and around afghanistan bush signed the launch order on september 10th
[49:57.760 --> 50:03.040]  to attack afghanistan then on september 12th he told you he was going to attack him
[50:04.960 --> 50:11.520]  because they'd attacked us i mean they planned this stuff right out in the open in front of
[50:11.520 --> 50:22.080]  everyone in front of everyone right out in the open they don't care and i know they're good
[50:22.080 --> 50:26.320]  bureaucrats and good police and others you better decide what side you're on right now
[50:26.320 --> 50:33.360]  okay there's no more time to screw around here people who think it's the safe path to keep their
[50:33.360 --> 50:37.920]  head down and go on to get along that is the sure course to destruction we are caught in the

[52:12.960 --> 52:18.080]  underneath the americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence on our president in congress
[52:18.640 --> 52:24.880]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[52:24.880 --> 52:31.280]  to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[52:41.440 --> 52:47.200]  the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen

[53:01.600 --> 53:06.480]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[53:06.480 --> 53:11.360]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[53:11.360 --> 53:16.160]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[53:16.160 --> 53:21.440]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[53:21.440 --> 53:26.400]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[53:26.400 --> 53:31.840]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[53:31.840 --> 53:36.960]  grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five
[53:36.960 --> 53:42.000]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.720]  in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old sponsors you can get
[53:46.720 --> 53:52.880]  more information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the
[53:52.880 --> 53:58.240]  government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com or call one eight seven seven three
[53:58.240 --> 54:17.840]  two seven zero three six five everything we see happening in europe and england is now
[54:17.840 --> 54:24.800]  being set up here right after the stage bombings in 2005 within a week of the bombings i was in
[54:24.800 --> 54:30.480]  england to cover it and police would walk up and just tell protesters you're not allowed to demonstrate
[54:31.200 --> 54:35.360]  and the law wasn't in place yet it was going into place the week after but they still just
[54:35.360 --> 54:40.240]  said we'll arrest you leave they tell me you're not allowed to videotape in the downtown i go but
[54:40.240 --> 54:44.880]  you've got cameras on me they'd say well let's just the way it is steve watson paul watson they've
[54:44.880 --> 54:50.560]  all been stopped steve watson was taking his girlfriend out to dinner nice part of london
[54:51.360 --> 54:56.880]  goons walked over police said line up everybody gives your papers in the nests of where you go
[54:56.880 --> 55:02.800]  and are you terrorist and and really got off on rubbing his face in it and and and we've seen
[55:02.800 --> 55:07.120]  this trend if you're a young man with a good-looking woman they get really mad because you think these
[55:07.120 --> 55:12.400]  guys can get women that's really their big problem is they're not successful they're not empowered
[55:12.400 --> 55:17.840]  and it's just like the soviet union line up answer secret police questions police
[55:17.840 --> 55:23.440]  demand new powers to stop and search terror suspects top officers tell government they
[55:23.440 --> 55:30.000]  want to replace section 44 law that was scrapped by human rights ruling and they just stop and
[55:30.000 --> 55:35.200]  talk to and they also have a so-called law that's been overthrown where they say you can't photograph
[55:35.200 --> 55:42.480]  police anywhere police have asked the government for new counterterrorism power to stop and search

[57:31.680 --> 57:35.600]  they claim they're defending net neutrality but when you actually read the fine print it says it
[57:35.600 --> 57:42.640]  allows companies to limit who can visit what websites and to control uh what sites get
[57:42.640 --> 57:46.880]  preferential treatment so not only is the FCC now announcing they have authority over the net

[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:18.960]  internet groups fear un could threaten cyberspace officials from 18 countries held an impromptu
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:24.080]  late night meeting earlier this month the united nations office in geneva and made a decision that
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:31.520]  rattled internet technocrats around the world autocratic governments like china autocratic
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.240]  that's a nice way of saying tyrannical wow you don't see that in american media talking about
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:42.320]  about the murdering chinese communists anymore they must have not got with the times in um
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:47.360]  monroe did you know china is now the model of the planet according to the council on foreign
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:53.840]  relations autocratic governments like china and i ran attended the meeting and it did several
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:00.000]  democratic ones despite protests from portugal united states that's the us again they played the
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.840]  good cop it's not our government anymore they voted to uh to staff a working group on the
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:10.800]  future of the internet conference forum an important theater of discussion on matters of
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:16.880]  cyberspace by governments alone and then it goes on with with the admissions that they're calling
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:21.680]  for the end of net neutrality governments to be able to control the internet shut it down if they
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.880]  wish it's a long story but it's got it all in there the seemingly arcane move are berberated
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:31.840]  through a community of technical experts academics and civil society groups who felt that they had
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:40.160]  been unfairly excluded 14 14 technical organizations that help oversee how cyberspace runs wrote an
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:45.120]  open letter asking the un commission on science and technology for development to reserve its
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:50.240]  decision and to reverse it meanwhile the internet society an umbrella group that helps manage
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:56.000]  technical standards online posted a petition to its website and protest a significant fuss has
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.520]  been kicked up about it said byron holland president ceo of the canadian internet registration
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:07.520]  authority which manages the ca domain the un's trying to take all that over it's funny earlier
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:14.320]  this year the u.s government and i can transferred more authority to the un so they're all involved
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:20.880]  in this i remember our government created the un so they always blame it for their own initiatives
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:31.280]  continuing even google waited into the fray vent surf a vice president on the online behemoth
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:35.600]  and one of the pioneers of the internet added his name to the petition alongside
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:42.000]  2600 others he also attacked the un decision on december 17th blog posted on google's website
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.880]  so they don't like the chinese and others taking over the web for themselves they want it for them
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:51.440]  it's not that they actually want a free web we don't believe government should be allowed
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:59.520]  to grant themselves a monopoly on internet governance surf wrote the current bottoms up

[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:21.280]  because there's a war on for your mind well joining us for the next 52 minutes use a blue rock
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:27.280]  well of blue rock well dot com of course he's worked for many years with ron paul's uh organization
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:35.840]  formerly uh in congress uh he's the head of the ludwig von mis institute he's the chairman of it
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:42.240]  and he joins us for the next 52 minutes to cover the march of tyranny to talk about ron paul ran paul
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:49.920]  we're going to get his take on the tsa on the warrantless federal checkpoints taking blood
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:56.080]  the threat fusion centers all of it with lou rockwell today but lou first off great to have
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:02.800]  you here as we prepare to close out 2010 uh what do you think's most important on your radar screen
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:07.760]  well alex i i think we've got a very exciting year ahead both in a good sense and in a bad
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.960]  sense uh no question that the the the sort of tyranny that you and i have been fighting against
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:19.520]  for so long and have worried about its approach is coming very fast now i mean the the police
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:26.560]  state the erection of the police state is um very frightening uh the wars that they're running the
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.160]  concentration camps that they have the torture that they engage in the fact that we've had two
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.440]  presidents in a row that now have said if they determine that you're a bad guy they can secretly
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.520]  arrest you kidnap you of course what's happening take you to a secret prison secretly torture you
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.800]  secretly kill you or to secretly keep you there for the rest of your life so you know if if i mean
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:53.360]  that sounds more to me like brezhnev than it does like what's supposed to be an american president
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.600]  so we have we have a very alarming thing and then of course we have what they're doing to the economy
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:02.080]  we have what uh bernanke and and the and the rest of the the gang at the federal reserve and
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:07.520]  conjunction with the big banks is doing to vastly expand the money supply uh they're destroying the
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:14.400]  dollar they're setting us up for uh another bubble and then another greater crash and by the way
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:20.080]  this current bubble uh is not going to feel like prosperity to any real person just to the big banks
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.920]  and then the big wall street firms of the government itself of course so we have what they're doing
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.040]  economically we have the police state we have the wars that they're running uh and there's never been
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:34.000]  a government as big as the u.s. government in the history of the world i mean this is the biggest
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:40.160]  most powerful richest government ever to exist it has untrammeled powers like no other government
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.120]  uh they can and part of that is the reason they can just print the money that they expect to want
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:50.640]  to it's to spend they have these gigantic counterfeiting presses that we call the federal reserve
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:56.320]  but i think that's that these are all reasons why the thing is actually going down because um
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:02.320]  they're going to destroy the dollar uh they're going to destroy the government economically
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.400]  the treasury the fed and all the rest of them therefore they're not going to be able to keep
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:12.240]  up the empire with its 700 gigantic military bases all over the world they're going to be forced i
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.680]  think in hope to bring the troops home uh and to really cut back and the government that goes
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.440]  they're going to be screaming about this they're going to be warning us that all the terrorists
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:27.200]  are going to get us and you know all the rest of their mythical uh mythical cries but they're i
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.080]  believe and i don't know when it's going to happen it could happen this next year might be five years
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.880]  from now might be 10 years from now but i think within the lifetime of virtually everybody listening
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:44.240]  to this show today that we are going to see the u.s. government forced to get back not to a
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:49.920]  constitutional level probably but significantly cut significantly less powerful that'll be good
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:55.200]  for us it'll be good for the world it'll be something to which you're about i agree with you
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:01.280]  but i clearly and i've even read this in some of the public white papers from cfr rand corporation
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:07.360]  and others that the military industrial complex is is basically planning to continue to fund
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:14.640]  themselves out of a type of third world casino gulag model and that it'll be good for the rest
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:21.840]  of the world that the colossus is going to implode but here domestically if we don't expose them for
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:28.640]  their crimes and reverse what they've done all of these imperial forces that are torturing and
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:35.120]  drug dealing and kidnapping and and and all the rest of it are going to be back here concentrated
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:40.640]  so whereas the vampires have been spread all over the world subbing on a million iraqis
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:45.680]  you know murdering people in syria georgia you name it now all the vampires are going to come
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:51.520]  back here and it's going to be scary well of course as as the great classical liberals and
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:57.440]  libertarians have have always held you can't have an empire overseas and a limited government at home
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:04.000]  you either have if you have an imperial government overseas it's imperial at home too and and uh
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.040]  it treats the american people like peons so we shouldn't be treated like peons people in other
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.480]  countries shouldn't be treated like peons and the the exact process that you're talking about
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:20.560]  because we saw with the cia which very early became a major drug dealer properly in the 1940s
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:27.600]  certainly by the time of the vietnam war uh the cia then and still is um maybe the major drug
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:32.080]  dealer in the world this of course is one of the reasons for the afghan war the u.s is in league
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:38.560]  with the the so-called northern league who were the pro-communist drug lords uh in afghanistan so
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:44.080]  this stuff is still continuing and it gives the cia which of course is spying on us here at home
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.920]  even though it's illegal for them to do so it gives them power and money so you you know it's
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:57.760]  this is a a many faceted gem of evil that we face and you're exactly right we we have to educate
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:02.720]  people as to what's going on sound the alarm and i believe that if the american people
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:06.880]  actually withdraw their consent from this operation in washington it can't actually
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:12.880]  succeed we saw a little bit of that with the tsa you mentioned you of course were heroic against
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:20.240]  the tsa um uh this is i think an extremely important issue and we actually saw them push back
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:25.600]  a little bit because of all the popular opposition uh around the time of thanksgiving and and and
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.880]  since then so of course they're going to scan start up all their the porno scanners the the
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:36.880]  dangerous radiation scanners all the horrific feel ups and so forth that are designed not to
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.240]  find a terrorist but to humiliate us to make us feel like cattle so they can just show us that they
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.240]  can do anything to us if nothing can happen to them so all those kinds of procedures they're
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:52.160]  going to try to start them up again um we that's why we have to start up our anti tsa campaign
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:58.160]  again to go after these people to alert americans uh so this is just pure time i don't think there's
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.400]  ever been anything i don't think even hitler or stalin did this stuff i mean it's quite it's
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:07.840]  quite an astounding and humiliating and disgusting business they're doing in the airports and they
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.880]  can be beaten they can be pushed back we saw it again the end of last year and i think it's
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.840]  going to be a very important thing again this year lou rockwell was our guest uh the chairman of
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:21.840]  the louis von mis institute i want to get into the economy i want to get more into the tsa
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:27.280]  and this control grid that clearly is training us to have government get in our comfort zones
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.640]  to teach us that we're the terrorist i saw ridge announced eight years ago uh right as homeland
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.960]  security was getting cabinet position in a two hour c span piece and i've been warning people
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:41.440]  ever since that they would be on the streets they would be at checkpoints you'll have to have an i d
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:48.000]  card to have a job a internal passport they now admit that indeed uh this is what they're doing
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.160]  but uh you literally stole my thunder uh there lou my next point was dealing with nazi germany
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:02.240]  even hitler and i've studied it deeply and even stalin now they didn't put on paper
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:07.280]  that they were secretly torturing people for confessions they didn't put on paper that they
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:12.160]  could torture children in front of their parents like john you and albert gonzalez and others
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:18.400]  they didn't put on paper uh that they were involved in narcotics trafficking uh now fox news comes out
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.760]  with herald rivera and the troops admit yes we help them grow the opium it's being you know produced
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:31.280]  at record levels i mean is this just hubris or i believe from studying them it's more of a psychological
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.840]  warfare op where they're trying to because we've exposed them just bring it all out in the open
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:45.200]  and inoculate us to psychologically to accept anything and everything i mean first it's oh you
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:49.600]  don't like this body scanning you now we'll grope you now we'll do both now we'll put our hands in
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:54.560]  your pants i mean they literally go in the pants and squeeze the underwear and squeeze the genitals
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:01.680]  what do you think i mean is it just power mad or is there something more to it well i think i think
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:07.920]  it's first of all they enjoy it there's something about the kinds of f a high act the great austrian
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:12.960]  economist uh had a chapter in his book the road to circle why the worst rise to the top and he
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:18.480]  was talking about government in general the the kinds of conduct that don't get you anywhere in a
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:24.800]  business rise you right to the top in government whether it's uh a successful lying demagoguery
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:31.440]  uh being power power mad so these people they love it they love taking an innocent person
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:35.680]  and putting their boot on the neck and pushing your face in the mud i mean they actually like
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:40.560]  that this is not of course just the american criminals it's criminals and in in governments
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.280]  all over the world to briefly interrupt it's from 1984 yeah oh brian's torturing winston
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:49.600]  then he says you want to know the future winston it's a boot stopping on a human face forever
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:54.640]  well that's of course that's what that's what they want and they so they not only wanted it to in
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:59.920]  order to maintain the power in order to enrich themselves but they also want it because they
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:07.440]  like it yes like doing it and so you can see it in the eyes there's a wonderful uh many novels
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:13.040]  written about this sort of thing of course uh orwell was so great but there's something about
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:18.880]  the eyes of these people uh when i was a boy the cops were i thought at least in the middle
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:26.080]  class town i lived in pretty much decent guys uh but today the cops are not decent guys for the
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:32.320]  most part there are some but they're they go after the damaged guys from iraq and from afghanistan
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:38.400]  and they put them in there and they treat them uh and train them to think of us as the people who
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:43.920]  they're occupying they really are um you know melt whatever whether malcolm x was right at the time
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.880]  or not he'd be right today the cops are an occupying force well i'm gonna say it exactly you had some
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:53.760]  big cities with corrupt predatory police forces you can see the photos and old newsreels and those
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:59.600]  corrupt cops with with the predatory eyes look like a lot of the cops today but even back when i
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:05.360]  was young i mean cops and a lot of old cops i know they were really into being real tough guys they
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:11.360]  were into protecting people and they like people bringing them pie and coffee and and you know knowing
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:18.000]  the locals and really did hate criminals and did enjoy you know defending the republic on average
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.560]  now they are automatons who are on power trips more and more and it's just it and you can see the
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:30.320]  tyranny i mean not just the actions your instinct when you see a crazed cop you know as a man i
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:35.440]  literally get my hackles up and i go that's a you know that's an enemy that's that's somebody who isn't
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:41.040]  you know who who well let's talk about when we come back uh the points i just made uh elaborating
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:47.120]  on what lou just said and how we somehow reverse this the full federalization of police and more

[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:26.400]  it's very simple when you militarize the police the military is trained to kill people and break
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:31.680]  things to fight a foreign enemy and decades ago the police would deny they were being federalized
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:38.640]  they would deny that they were being militarized now they call themselves paramilitary organizations
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:44.720]  uh lou you got cut off by the break continue with your point well you know you're
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:51.280]  courier to uh uh follow up on your point just now i remember when richard nixon evil nixon
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:58.480]  and the republican party started the uh open militarization and federalization of local police
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:02.880]  forces with the law enforcement assistance administration as they called it uh back in the
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:09.040]  1970s and it's been a steady steady uh increased today so that yeah the local the local cops are
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:13.200]  adjuncts of the federal government and they all look like soldiers i mean is there anybody
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:19.200]  listening to this show when they see a cop car or a cop think oh thank god i'm going to be protected
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:25.280]  i mean none none of us think that and even in the little town i live in the cops look like
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.160]  so that out of star wars i mean they're all wearing body armor and they have uh you know
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:35.520]  all kinds of advanced weapons and they're in the trunk of their police car and if they have
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:39.600]  it's just it's very alarming i mean they clearly are becoming an occupation force
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:46.560]  but you know there's one thing i want to bring up one um optimistic point uh there was a man
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:52.080]  called eddie and dillard weddie who was a french uh thinker in the 16th century mary rothbard uh
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:58.480]  writes about him uh and makes the same point david hume living on mesis others the governments
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.480]  can depend on the consent of the government uh even totalitarian governments depend at least
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:10.560]  on the tacit consent because if if you remember what happened in romania when the people had
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:15.760]  finally had enough of chauchescu and his people didn't matter that they had the army didn't matter
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:22.320]  that they had the secret police they went down because the number of of uh victims of the government
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.760]  is far vaster than the number of people living off the government and no amount of propaganda
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:33.520]  could stop that from happening and chauchescu hours before he was overthrown was up there
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:39.360]  bossing them around in a rally but cop started beating people up and the people just finally
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:46.080]  said that's it we're done it's over and chauchescu of course was tried and executed uh within uh
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:52.400]  just a day or so uh of that and again a lot of police and i want to be positive about this
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.440]  despite all the brainwashing and the fact that they've tried to train the police at the public
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.880]  is their enemy a lot of police are starting to see through this uh as well and realize what's
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.920]  happening i think that's true and i think that there are um a lot of good guys in the police
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:12.400]  forces and there are a lot of good people who work for the government in fact when we actually
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:18.160]  really start to make uh progress against this whole regime we'll see a lot of people in the
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:22.800]  government joining us this is this is what's happened in any other similar instance in
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:29.440]  in human history the rulers can no longer count on their own troops or their own police
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.760]  we saw a little bit of this back during the vietnam war i've always argued that the reason
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:38.560]  that they couldn't keep up the vietnam war which is a war of aggression against innocent people
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:47.440]  entirely evil entirely rotten um probably there were six million people killed um uh martin
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:53.440]  and crevel the great israeli military historian um has said the u s was responsible for the death
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:28:00.000]  of six million people in laos in south vietnam in north vietnam and in cambodia because no america
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.560]  those names are not on a wall any place in washington nobody cares about that sort of thing
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:10.560]  but at some point the american troops started to mutiny they started to refuse their orders
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:16.160]  they started to have sit-down strikes and i think that when that started happening scared the pants
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:21.200]  off the people in washington the striped pants and they had to start getting the troops out
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:25.680]  they had to end the war and something even similar happened that after world war one when
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:31.520]  Winston Churchill the evil Winston Churchill wanted to take over all of the ottoman empire make it
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:37.520]  part of the british empire and conquer it and make them actual colonies of britain and he writes
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:42.640]  about this in his private letters it says it's so horrible that the british troops that had enough
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.800]  of war they wanted to go home they weren't going to fight anymore they weren't going to go conquer
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:53.600]  um what was has since become iraq and syria and lebanon and so forth so that is actually what's
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:59.760]  going to happen um this is what they fear most when their own troops their own soldiers even
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:04.960]  their own spies are going to put the people first instead of the government first we're going to
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:09.680]  go to break long segment coming up uh lube but when we come back i want to get your take on what
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:15.200]  you were already alluding to in fact i did an audio blog a few days ago on this specific issue
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:21.200]  that the system whenever we're ready to stand up and fight back they always retreat but then
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.960]  when we get comfortable again they always reemerge we've seen that with the tsa they backed off not
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:32.320]  just on thanksgiving day but have backed off in in many respects since then and as you said they're
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:38.960]  now trying to come back a month later to start enforcing it they don't want us to ever gain
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:44.800]  critical mass and and they don't ever want us to learn that we can have political victories just
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:54.080]  like you mentioned with the troops uh in uh vietnam stay there we're on the march the empires on the

[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:23.680]  after thank you for joining us it's the next to last a live transmission of 20 janets we hurdle
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:31.040]  the 2011 and beyond blue rockwell of blue rockwell dot com is our guest our websites of course are
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:39.600]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv uh lou going back to the point that i was uh starting
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:45.840]  to make before the break i mean i guess to simply quantify it they don't ever want us to have a chance
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:50.800]  to fight them out in the open peacefully and show the power of the people show that we have common
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:56.080]  sense and the majority and the republic on our side and we see them back off and i've
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:02.000]  have read the histories as uh as uh you covered and and can concur that it was finally when the
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:09.280]  troops started saying no they didn't want that message to be sent that the ruling powers had
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:15.600]  lost control they wanted to then shift and behave like they had decided to end the war that was just
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:23.280]  a black hole for drug dealing and uh there are no bid contracts uh and more and more i see the
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:29.680]  establishment not having just that psychopathic gleam of the priest of power but more and more
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:35.920]  i am seeing desperate fear now can you elaborate on your statement but then also get into uh what
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:41.680]  you think the state of this of this corrupt global government is and how you see liberty versus
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:48.080]  tyranny colliding in the future you know alex is no question that they're terrified and i i always
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:53.600]  get a kick out of it when there's some little sesna that flies by mistake over capitol hill
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.080]  and all of a sudden they're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off and going
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:05.760]  crazy just recently they they they shut down the pentagon stop on the metro that the the dc area
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:12.640]  subway system because somebody had a had a flashing uh christmas uh ornament and so they you know
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:17.920]  shut down the subway shut you know and they're all terrified and uh on the metro for example they
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:23.120]  have a friend who just told me they have the groups of five armored troops or maybe they're
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:29.040]  armored police i don't know but automatic weapons patrolling around well this of course is to is
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:34.960]  to go after us not terrorists and to terrorize us to make us afraid but it's also because the
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:38.720]  government is afraid i think i think the government has been afraid for maybe they've
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.640]  always been afraid maybe they maybe they always have realized that they're literally like a bunch
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:48.160]  of fleas um on a dog and they're always afraid we're going to scratch them off and we can scratch
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:52.880]  them off and they are constantly terrified because that can mean that they're even more brutal
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:58.400]  than normal because they're terrified but they can't actually if the if the people refuse to go
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:06.880]  along they can't actually do anything to us so uh and we only need peaceful resistance uh after
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:13.280]  all the the tools of violence of murder of the uh all the weapons and the bombs and that sort of
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:18.080]  thing those are the tools of government they're not the truth the tools of of of uh of a peaceful
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:24.480]  resistance we don't need that stuff i believe that we can do it just by telling them no by withholding
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:30.640]  our consent um you know i take if i take the very radical position for example i don't vote i don't
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:35.200]  i don't somebody enjoys voting we'll go right ahead but i would argue that's actually a negative
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:40.480]  to vote um but because it's the sacrament of the state sacrament of the democratic religion
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:46.480]  that you're supposed to partake in this um they want you to be focused on them focused on the
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:53.840]  politicians love the politicians um be cheering for you know gangster a versus gangster well that's
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:38:00.400]  what all the telescreens now in 9 000 locations first it was 800 walmarts now 9 000 stores to have
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:05.920]  huge telescreens where they force their way into your life in the market where they force their way
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:11.200]  into your life in the school telling kids that men with uh you know turbines are under the table
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:17.040]  about to climb out and hurt them i mean it literally is a religion of them being front and center
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:22.560]  and playing the part of our god but then meanwhile they act so afraid of the public we get their
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:26.960]  internal training manuals that law enforcement leaked to us and others and they're totally afraid
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:33.760]  of ron paul of bob bar of libertarians of gun owners of returning veterans all tyrants hitler
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:40.560]  was afraid of the military i mean this is classic tyranny and i reminded of proverbs 281 the wicked
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:46.480]  flea when no man pursue with them they act guilty they're not just guilty on the intellectual
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:52.720]  evidence they act like crooks well they know they're crooks and i remember the great leisander
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:56.720]  spooner the 19th century american anarchist who said the difference was the difference
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.720]  between a congressman and a highway man and he said the difference is the highway man doesn't
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:06.880]  ask you to call him the honorable so that's i mean these people you know as marie rottbart said
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:12.880]  government is the gang of thieves writ large it acts like a gang of thieves it has the morals of a
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:18.080]  gang of thieves and just like a regular gang of thieves they're terrified that the victims
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:24.320]  might organize against them and that's it and our forefathers weren't perfect but you notice
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:28.560]  how much time the media and education spends demonizing them it's because i've studied a
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:34.800]  wide spectrum of history there's never been a more truly educated group of people a never more
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:40.240]  a flower of renaissance and awakening and and and i mean literally trying to read their letters
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:46.880]  they weren't showing off with complex words and prose these were people who who who who it was
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:54.160]  it was honored to be an inventor or a trailblazer or a scientist uh or or an inventor and so because
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:40:02.240]  that was what the competition was about it accelerated uh an amazing again a flower of
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:08.640]  of the renaissance and is the greatest example of anything that we've developed so far and that's
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.640]  why they're trying to pull it down and destroy it well you'll notice that schools of course
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:17.440]  children are no longer taught about great businessmen great inventors other great figures in the
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:21.120]  private sector they're only taught about alleged great people in the government and you're you're
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:26.560]  right they were supposed to forget anybody in the 18th century or before in fact the current
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:31.920]  american regime was founded by abraham lincoln uh you only have to i urge anybody if you have the
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:38.320]  unfortunate um a duty of having to go to washington dc make sure you go look at the lincoln temple
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:45.040]  this was built in the progressive era a time of vastly increasing government like our own and uh
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:50.080]  this thing is a is is modeled after the temple of jupiter best and greatest in asian realm the
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:56.160]  chief god of the roman state abraham lincoln is in his throne he's got fascis the fascis uh uh on
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:01.920]  either side of the of his throne and uh this is not this is this is a god so yeah the government
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:06.000]  always is a competition with god the government would like to beat god i think they look to the
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.760]  days of the pharaoh when that was the best time when the government actually was god well that's
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:13.520]  why they're symbol in the new world order is the pyramid and for those that don't know what fasci
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:18.400]  are in rome their main symbol and what their armies carried and what was carved on their temples
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:23.680]  and government buildings is a bundle of sticks tied together with hatchets on the top meaning
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:29.920]  we enslave you we bind you and force or what mal said political power goes out of the barrel of a
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:36.480]  gun they'll force uh impels you to serve us and you're right uh they brought into the senate what
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:42.400]  in the last 80 years or so uh and and suddenly everywhere fasci it's on our money i mean they're
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:47.360]  telling you what they are well it's true and of course this is what the fascist party in the system
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:53.600]  of fascism is therefore uh named after and by the way fascism and fascist is not just an epithet
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:59.120]  this is an actual political philosophy it's an economic philosophy and it is the current regime
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:05.440]  in america it may be a form of so far soft fascism but this government big business big
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:10.240]  government partnership against the people that is fascism and that's of course the way the
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:15.840]  government runs the huge corporate interests uh in league with a huge government uh to rip off
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.560]  the american people and rip off in fact the people of the whole world through the federal reserve
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:25.920]  and all the the world bank and the un and all the rest of things the u.s government and uh it's
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:34.080]  uh the power elite set up so this is uh fascism is a very real thing i i myself i don't ever i
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:38.880]  never thought commune even though communism was you know maybe the worst thing ever to exist in
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.840]  terms of uh the way countries were run uh but it was never i don't think there was ever any any
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:49.760]  danger of americans becoming communists but i must say after federal failure day on the 9-11-1
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:55.600]  uh when i saw the reaction of americans and since then i thought you know now i understand
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:01.120]  how hitler came to power now i understand how people you thought of as decent great people in
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:06.720]  germany could overnight all of a sudden be cheering for a police state and for all kinds of other
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:12.560]  harino and and and demonizing well that's what's scary is i've studied weimar germany and the
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:20.000]  people low crime rates very moral by our standards very hard working and they bought the kool-aid
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.280]  because they'd been in a depression they were scared that they'd been demoralized and they just
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:31.840]  and by the way 20 million germans died in that war folks so i mean look at what it cost them
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:37.520]  buying into that big government fraud well it's true and if you know that a key thing is as you
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:44.160]  pointed out it was the weimar depression and the weimar inflation uh which was forced on germany
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:48.720]  even john mated kain said wrongly uh after all there were other people responsible for starting
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:54.400]  world war one it wasn't just germany russia france and the britain too but they didn't have any
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:59.360]  reparations put on them it had a horrific they were on record upset at germany's rise the british
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:03.760]  empire couldn't compete with them no they that's course this was all about that's what the war
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:10.320]  was about and uh so they crushed it's always an evil thing agustin talked about this it's an evil
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:15.760]  thing in a war as bad as war is one of the worst things in wars to seek to totally crush the
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:20.640]  opposition to grind them into the ground destroy their society destroy everything about them
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:26.240]  it's it brings just hate and more evil and of course we had the second installment of world war
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:32.560]  one and just a few years later world war two but uh the germans went through this hyperinflation
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:38.240]  which has tremendous not only a tremendous economic effects but tremendously bad cultural and
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:44.640]  moral effects on a people it destroys people's belief in anything permanent and it had a very
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:50.080]  very bad effect on the germans and with fact that that's something we face today in this country
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:56.480]  we face the possibility certainly of a 1970s style inflation maybe something much worse
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:01.840]  we can't know for sure because things depend on uh the subjective opinions of the of the people
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:05.520]  it's not just what the government does the government's printing the money it's depends on
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:10.640]  what our view is of what's happening overall confidence but the indicators are the debt ratios
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:15.520]  are astronomically bigger as you know as the head of the von mis institute compared to what they were
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:21.280]  in the 70s and people know real unemployment's 22 they know it's not 9.8 and that was my next
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:26.480]  question for you uh ron paul has stated this dr paul you've stated it people who've really studied
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:32.720]  history and and and finance the great danger is and i want you to elaborate lou rockwell i hear
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:40.080]  with us today is that during this crisis period they may actually use it to bring in the more
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:46.320]  hardcore fascism and that might come out of the republican party or something as the solution uh
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:53.280]  and uh so instead of using total government slash fascist failure as a way to get our
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:59.360]  republic back and more freedom it may go the other direction into just hardcore hyper tyranny
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:05.120]  well we're in a crisis we're facing a greater crisis and in a crisis this is when radical
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.600]  change can happen but of course it can be radically bad as well as as well as radically
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:15.440]  good um back in and under the i mentioned nixon before into the nixon regime and the evil arthur
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:22.880]  burns it was the Bernanke of that period uh they ginned up inflation and in order to prevent prices
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:28.320]  from going up and nixon thought that in order to be reelected he had to have a startup an artificial
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:33.520]  bubble an artificial boom by having the federal reserve massively increase the money supply
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:38.240]  but to prevent that from having effects on prices he put on price and wage controls which is
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:42.240]  entirely a totalitarian measure where the government is putting a gun to the head of
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:49.040]  every businessman yeah that's Hugo Chavez they pardon that's Hugo Chavez well yeah all these
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:54.480]  you know all these guys i mean this is this is the this is the uh the weapon of the dictator the
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:47:01.360]  the uh the price of wage controls capital controls uh foreign exchange controls so yeah if they are
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:07.520]  going to try this um i think the difference is there are you know thanks to you and thanks to
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:13.440]  uh the work of so many other people the american people are far more aware today at least the
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:18.960]  minority uh of what's going on they understand what's going on they don't believe the government
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:25.680]  and i think uh you know it's it's a race between us and them i mean can we inspire and educate
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:30.240]  enough americans so that they will stand up and they'll say no to the government or are they going
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:35.920]  to become you know brown shirts i mean that's that's what we that's the that's the that's the
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:41.520]  battle we face uh i happen to be optimistic i think we're i think we've got uh more economic
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:48.640]  trouble in the meantime uh criminal the criminally created economic trouble by a very bad man uh
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.720]  using the government to enrich themselves and their and their cronies and hurting the rest of us
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:58.240]  and it's so out in the open i mean never before tens of trillions disappearing and congress says
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:02.560]  where's the money in committee hearing after committee meeting and we see the spectacle
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:08.480]  of private bankers saying i'm not going to tell you i mean this is insane well i've been fighting
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:14.000]  the fed for like 40 years and i can tell you for the vast majority of that time you couldn't get
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.240]  anybody interested no you know it might have it was just a little name on the bill in your pocket
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:25.520]  otherwise it it it had no meaning because of ron paul now there's a huge number of americans who
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:31.920]  not only are aware of the fed aware of the fed's depredations but they hate the fed and that is
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:38.800]  a very very good thing so i think you know we uh uh we don't want to hate people i mean i think
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:44.880]  you know i can say that gustin was right you you uh hate the sin love the sinner so we want to hate
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:49.680]  the federal reserve what the federal reserve does and try to convert the people who are doing these
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:54.720]  bad things to us but we regardless of whether we can convert them or not we have to stop them well
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:49:00.960]  lou as you know that's an example of how much liberty has grown and and and and the fact that
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:05.680]  we've had a game changer and we're really starting to win is 10 years ago ron paul couldn't get one
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.000]  co-sponsored out at the fed he passed it in the house this year they watered it down in the senate
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.080]  but the beginning of the end has happened and it's the big brzezinski a few months ago was bemoaning
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:19.760]  this to the council on foreign relations that people are finally awake not to the public politicians
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:27.360]  but to the big mega banks who aren't free market who want a socialist system to transfer it through
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:33.680]  fascism they socialize collectivize us to put us on the the plantation but then use a fascist system
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:40.320]  through government on top of it kind of caked on top with the icing to transfer the funds to them
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:46.160]  it's the beginning of the end when the general public now over 80 major polls know the federal
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:51.040]  reserve is the problem and want to get rid of it i mean there's no way that they're going to be able
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:57.680]  to reverse that and and and people expect instant victories they expect that oh ron paul should have
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:04.080]  won in 2008 he won in getting the real issues out now look what it's turned into today oh absolutely
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:10.400]  he had a huge that was a huge educational victory and there was a funny article in forbs maybe a
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:16.720]  year and a half ago where the the writers said look where this is extremely dangerous the fed
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:22.000]  has to be boring he said if the fed becomes interesting and then the great technocrats who
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:27.200]  are running our lives and who know better than us and are taking care of everything won't be able
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:31.840]  to operate and he said this is the real damage that ron paul is doing and he's making the fed
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:35.840]  interesting well of course ron paul has done that he has made the fed interesting it should be
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:41.200]  interesting because they're ripping us off they are ripping you off they're ripping your children

[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:20.640]  starting to have uh together is all the tyranny we've forewarned people about is now unfolding
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:25.760]  i only got about four minutes left with lou rockwell of lou rockwell.com lou i wanted to bring up
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:33.200]  some of the tricks the social engineers have one of them is stage crises or using a crisis uh like
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:38.480]  a manual said to the wall street journal don't let a good crisis go to waste uh ron paul's talked
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:46.240]  about the gulf of tonkin uh i was going to bring up to you you know staged events uh or or mutalib
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:52.080]  admittedly being you know uh given a visa because an unnamed agency told the state department to
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:58.720]  give the underwear bomber uh the the weapon uh what's your take on staged events well i think
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:02.720]  that certainly takes place you mentioned gulf of tonkin the pearl harbor uh with something
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:07.280]  franklin rooseville wanted to have happened uh would wilson wanted us into world war one and
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:13.920]  and uh wanted the lucetini attacked um so you know governments love wars i mean uh for those
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:18.400]  for the rest of us we think of a war is you know horrific i mean dead people won't people property
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:25.120]  destroyed i mean just the anti-civilization uh these people they they love war and uh so they're
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:28.800]  very different from us on the other hand i think we always have to take into account that the
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:34.960]  government is a very stupid organization it has to do with the economics of bureaucracy uh it's
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:42.000]  it's a dangerous organization think of it like a like a huge blind um a rabbit dog so if it's
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:47.600]  on you boy you're dead if it grabs you by the jaws you've had it but it is possible to avoid it
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:52.320]  so yes they're capable of anything i don't think you know if if the government doesn't do something
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:56.160]  evil uh it's only because they don't think it's in their interest or they didn't think of it or
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:00.640]  they can't figure out how to do it but uh there's nothing that's beyond the morally they're glad
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:06.160]  to start wars kill people en masse i mean there's nothing nothing beyond them but again as the
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:12.080]  bureaucracy is stupid uh so thank goodness thank goodness they're not smart and uh thank goodness
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:20.000]  uh that private intellectuals private people uh private study private shows like yours private
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:28.560]  organizations private books private websites we are able to uh to refute and resist these people
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:33.520]  we're able to spread the truth about history about economics about all the things that are
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:38.560]  going on in the world today and all the things they're doing to us so i think uh again the
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:44.720]  the government again is capable of anything evil but um they are a stupid organization
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:50.160]  that's the reason that we can win but you do support a new 9 11 investigation oh sure i'd
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:55.120]  like to see and i'd like to see a new pearl harbor investigation i mean i think i'd like to see
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:58:00.960]  i'd like to see uh uh an actual you know i remember the heroic church hearings of the 1970s
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:06.000]  when senator frank church actually looked into the cia and we got some great information of the
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.800]  sort we sort of knew existed but it's great to have the facts about the murders and the coups
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:15.840]  and all the evil deeds of the cia so i'd like to see this for everything that everything about
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:19.920]  the government absolutely well incredible interview i want you to have a great new year in 30 seconds
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:27.440]  do you agree with me uh that the tide is starting to turn i think the tide is turning absolutely
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:32.880]  i think the tide is i i'm gonna say i was very pessimistic right after 9 11 but uh i think today
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:38.640]  absolutely people are waking up people are learning they're educating themselves so i again even though

[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:45.040]  gone away by dr paul craig roberts and it says anyone who doesn't believe that the u.s is an
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:52.640]  in sepid fascist state needs only to consult the latest assault on civil liberties by fox news
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:01:01.120]  instead of informing citizens fox news informs on citizens jason deets reports from fox news
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:07.040]  no longer content to simply shill for a growing police state folks we have to stand together
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:13.760]  or hang separate really nobody came to our aid a few months ago when fox news reported us repeatedly
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:19.600]  to homeland security that says turning in a grandmother to the department of homeland security
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:24.800]  for making anti-american statements and fox news said that she criticized the government
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:30.560]  i've got fox news video where they say taser 9 11 truthers put us in secret jails you know i've
[02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:36.880]  put that in my films clips of it it goes on the media have segwayed into the police attitude which
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:45.920]  regards uh insistence on civil liberties and references the constitutions as signs of extremism
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:53.840]  especially when the constitution is invoked in defense of dissent or privacy and or a placard
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:58.240]  or bumper sticker and then it goes into the fox piece calling homeland security on somebody
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:05.280]  that criticized the government well what happened here what happened here uh this is an article
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:14.000]  from march 31st 2010 what eight months ago or so uh fox news calls for obama to be killed
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:21.120]  while framing alex jones for instigating violence and then we have the clip of the video clip where
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:27.360]  they call for one of their hosts call for obama to be killed no secret service came there uh of
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:32.240]  course michael reagan got to call for mark dies to be killed he said i will give you money i want
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:36.960]  him shot i will pay for the bullets i mean if i said that i'd be arrested in hours and should be
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:41.840]  and i got millions of listeners somebody could very well go out and kill somebody if i told them to
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:49.360]  instead fox news put out a story claiming i was calling for violence and then calling through
[02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:54.720]  comments on the website trying to claim i was supporting calls for violence people ask why
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:03:00.720]  after a few weeks comments get erased that's the only way we don't have time to go through them all
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:05.200]  and find calls for violence and so the comments are there while the stories are getting attention
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:08.880]  people can have their debate and then it all gets memory hold because i can't have the secret
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:15.520]  service here every month and fox news and the adl crawling through comments and reporting it like
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:20.880]  i'm calling for it we ought to just get rid of the comments entirely i'm telling you and that forum
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:26.240]  is nothing but problems fbi secret service i mean i can't handle it federal subpoenas
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:32.640]  and i want people to be able to debate and discuss but it continues mass murdering uh
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:38.720]  promoting fox news the network that was instrumental in pushing uh lies about weapons of mass destruction
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:42.960]  that resulted in the deaths of over a million innocent people is so concerned about violent
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:47.120]  comments on the internet that it employs teams of people to troll through anti-establishment
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:52.560]  websites and they listed info wars dot com is terrorist looking for reasons to report alex
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:57.680]  jones of the authorities and then we've got links to their stories doing that so it's not just this
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:03.520]  woman they call homeland security on they called them on us repeatedly we discovered it's fox news
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:10.400]  the adl and the southern poverty law center uh that are doing this to us and don't forget within
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:17.280]  two hours of richard ploskey killing those three cops in pittsburgh a year and a half ago the southern
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:22.720]  poverty law center connected rider had been given access to the computer thousands of urls have been
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:27.920]  visited and then they said that he was a fan of alex jones and they had some suspicious guy on tv
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:35.200]  within minutes saying and after they got him in custody okay and then we went and looked at his
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:40.560]  comments on my site he was a white supremacist attacking me and saying i was wrong for not being
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:46.640]  for violence so who does the southern poverty law center and the feds and the cops think of when
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:52.880]  there's three dead cops who's the first person they think of alex jones pin that scarlet letter on his
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:05:03.680]  chest tell cops he wants them dead so he can sick cops on him unbelievable hundreds of nations have
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:09.920]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:15.120]  finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath americans at home i have
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:20.880]  a tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:27.120]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention full of the republic

[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:45.120]  the rise of the fourth rite the secret societies that threaten to take over america uh he joins us
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:50.800]  now but the first thing i want to talk about with jim mars is this issue people like to say it's a
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:59.120]  catholic conspiracy or it's a jewish conspiracy or it's a masonic conspiracy or it's an alien
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:07.120]  conspiracy or it's a the truth is from my research i want to get jim's take on this it is a scientific
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:14.400]  dictatorship conspiracy of predatory psychopaths that that that that build governmental and corporate
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:20.720]  structures to carry out their eugenics operations it's just like everything hitler did he learned
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:25.360]  from the united states in england on record it wasn't a thousand it was tens of thousands of
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:31.360]  nazis brought here to run every facet of our government so it's not a nazi conspiracy the
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:38.000]  nazis are only one branch of this then why does it come out uh that uh israel carried out eugenics
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:47.600]  against tens of thousands of their children uh it's it's it's a very dark system behind all of this
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:53.280]  and at the top of all these pyramids whether it's the vatican or the masonic orders or the main
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:59.760]  protestant churches you find the same people interlocking together and that's how the globalist
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:04.880]  control society it's now been declassified confirming what whole timers reported that it was true our
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:10.320]  government was funding the soviets the whole time again it's not our government they create the enemy
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:15.600]  to then build up the police state to counter it just like al qaeda was government created by zbigniew
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:21.520]  brazinski i mean you get where i'm going with this gem and when you get right down to the deepest
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:28.400]  levels of this what is the new world order who are the head honchos well you just hit the nail on
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:37.920]  the head alex uh you know when you ask well is it a communist conspiracy is a Zionist conspiracy
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:45.600]  it is a is it a masonic conspiracy it is that luminati and you know and the answer is yes all of
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:53.600]  the above because as you know and as you just very well articulated and as i have found out by
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:12:00.160]  tracking these folks all the way back through recorded history there has been a little knot of
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:05.600]  people okay if you want to call them people you call them psychopaths and i think and obviously
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:13.200]  they uh they're not operating that uh with a full load they have wanted to control and it's all about
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:20.080]  power and control uh everyone talks about greed and all the corporations they're all just greedy and
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:25.200]  and the pharmaceutical corporations they're just greedy well yeah they're greedy but and they want
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:32.320]  money but money to them is not the objective it's just the means to the objective and the objective
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:40.000]  is power and control they want to control everybody and this is why if you'll think about it in the
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:49.840]  grandest sense uh of history that uh throughout uh all our recorded history we find that starting
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:56.880]  with man's first recorded civilization at least in the western hemisphere uh started between the
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:04.080]  tiger's new freight east rivers uh which in which is now iraq and then it spread north into the
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:10.080]  carcass mountain regions and then uh into what is now southern russia and then into eastern europe
[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:17.120]  to western europe and it spread southward through palestine into egypt greece rome and again into
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:22.160]  western europe to the british isles and then civilization spread to the east coast of the
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:28.480]  united states and during the 1800s of course there was that huge westward expansion until we
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:35.040]  filled up north america and reached the pacific coast why were these people all why moving why
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:40.880]  was everybody moving when everybody happy with where they were no and history makes no secret
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:49.440]  about it they were all moving trying to escape religious and political tyranny everybody they're
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:55.680]  trying to control them but we just moved but alex as you will know more than anybody else
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:14:03.040]  there's no place left to go we're going to have to turn and fight right yes you're absolutely right
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:10.960]  you know jim you've been one of the deepest researchers on the nazis and uh anthony sutton's
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:15.680]  work on record our government did finance them i wouldn't say totally control them but had them
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:20.880]  infiltrated built them up told them to invade areas of europe you know use the nazis to create
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:26.560]  the crisis to offer the un world government a solution of course hitler wanted a world government
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:31.360]  as well and uh you know really brought in the modern olympics as we know it but now it's the
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:37.360]  new york times last week or two weeks ago oh more nazis than we thought brought in it turns out
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:42.640]  simon weasenthal and all that stuff it was just a show they track a few little low level guys but
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:48.880]  all the real top nazis they weren't just protected they were put in positions over everything because
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:54.800]  they were ruthless they believed in eugenics they would do what they were told uh so of course
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:15:00.240]  you wrote rise of the fourth rike and uh man i tell you now it's coming out mainstream news
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:06.400]  about the bushes and the nazis yeah it's all it's all it's all turning out to be all too true
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:10.720]  but let me tell you something that i did not stress i don't think hard enough
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:15.200]  in my book the rise of the fourth rike and that you're going to really resonate with
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:22.560]  and that's with we all know that wall street the city of london these wealthy western bankers
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:29.760]  and financiers they bankrolled hitler and the nazis they created them okay so then wait a minute
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:37.920]  why do we have to fight world war two uh to stop the nazis well what happened there well let me
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:40.640]  let me uh throw this at you um
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:51.120]  when hitler took over germany in january 1933 economically it was on its knees half the country
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:56.720]  was out of work inflation was even eating them up hyperinflation we remember the stories about how
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:04.160]  these germans had to take wheelbarrow loads of cash just to buy a loaf of bread okay in two years two
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:13.840]  years hitler had turned that completely around okay and by the 1936 olympics of 1936 uh the
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:23.440]  berlin olympics uh germany was a showcase of economic strength and viability why okay how
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:31.520]  did that happen because here's where hitler made his greatest mistake he did not borrow
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:38.800]  so debt entangled money from the international bankers he created his own money through the
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:47.440]  geucha bank uh the rags uh marks and he used the state-issued money to then pay off people
[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:52.480]  working on public projects like the autobahn building big buildings and stuff everybody
[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:57.760]  got a job he put everybody back to work everybody got a paycheck they were spending their paychecks
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:03.840]  money was flowing through the economy and they became very prosperous the international bankers
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:10.320]  could not let that continue to exist because then every other country like the united states which
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:17.760]  now is a wash in debt and and we can't seem to do anything because we're 14 trillion dollars in debt
[02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:26.160]  you know they had to stop hitler and in fact uh i did quote in my book rise and forth right
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:33.120]  Winston Churchill who said quote you must understand that this war is not against hitler
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:40.160]  or national socialism but against the strength meaning the economic strength of the german people
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:45.680]  which must be smashed once and for all regardless of whether it's in the hands of hitler or a
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:51.600]  Jesuit priest okay in other words they weren't against national socialism we they pushed
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:58.080]  they're pushing that in this country right now and uh but they did not want germany
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:04.000]  leading the financial economic order well that was the same reason for one on record right
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:12.960]  exactly it all goes back to the money but it's again it's not just money per se it's the
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:19.520]  control and power that money brings well it's the controlling of the issuance of currency
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:23.440]  and credit uh i want to get your take on the time we've got left in this segment i want to
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:27.440]  come back and get into a wiki leaks that you've been hot on the trail of i want to get your
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:31.360]  perspective on that and a lot more and what's happening with a trillion dollar conspiracy
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:38.960]  or new york times best-selling book but what's your take on the tsa overall oh listen this is
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:45.040]  an agency we need to do away with uh this is just insane let me tell you something we're coming
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:50.960]  right off of talking about hitler and the nazis uh the gestapo was bad enough if they caught you
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:55.520]  got you in their clutches that yes they would take you to their underground dungeons and they would
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:03.680]  commit unspeakable acts okay but even the gestapo even the ss even hitlers nazis did not have the
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:12.800]  audacity to try to strip down and grope the genitals of the german people or the europeans of the 1930s
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:17.440]  and 40s they knew they wouldn't allow be allowed to get away with the government always wants more
[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:22.640]  more more if they get away with this what's next well we know federally funded warrantless blood

[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:32.880]  criminal beat reporter driving around with the police radio he was reporting you know back
[02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:42.000]  during the jfk assassination he taught the first course in college on the jfk assassination from
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  the conspiracy perspective and now look at the polls upwards of 90 percent today say the official
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:55.520]  story of the jfk assassination is a fraud in a lie before we get into the wiki leaks the other
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:01.360]  issues i raised jim in the short segment uh what do you think of uh judge andrew napolitano or
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:06.960]  rola revero all these other people coming out and saying they don't believe the official story of 911
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:14.080]  that has got a really scare of the system that uh their big enchilada their big event is being
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:22.080]  exposed uh i know it's incredible everything you you know we we touched on the tsa thing which is
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:28.400]  just absolutely incredible and and everything else is going on and of course the wars are
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:33.200]  continuing in afghanistan and iraq and then they then the guys are coming back they're
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:39.680]  going to have Gulf War syndrome 2 3 uh it's just everything and the money that's been siphoned out
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:47.360]  of the system uh and and it all goes back to 9 11 but alex let me tell you something having lived
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:53.040]  through the kennedy assassination and then dealt with that for so many years for about 15 years
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:26:00.800]  after the kennedy assassination which was november the 22nd 1963 for 15 years it was just considered
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:07.360]  impolite to even bring it up and discuss it in decent company you just weren't supposed to talk
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:15.120]  about it and i submit to you alex that we are in a somewhat similar situation today with 9 11 you're
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:20.400]  just not supposed to talk about it and if you do bring it up then you must be some kind of conspiracy
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:27.600]  kook but let me tell you something just like the kennedy assassination 9 11 is not going to go away
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:35.120]  okay because the evidence the questions the inconsistencies the anomalies are they make
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:41.840]  the kennedy assassination look like truly a deep dark mystery and today as you well know because
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:48.240]  you and i both look deeply into the kennedy assassination if you in general sense the details
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:53.920]  we don't know but in a general sense anyone who studies it can now know exactly what happened
[02:26:53.920 --> 02:27:00.640]  in the kennedy assassination which was a coup d'etat in the united states but it makes that look
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:08.000]  like a really deep mystery compared to the in-your-face evidence concerning 9 11 and so we they can't
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:17.040]  keep it hidden forever and heraldo and others janin depolitano eight six out of the 10 9 11
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:26.160]  commissioners uh have stated that uh you know raised questions about 9 11 in fact um last year
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:33.360]  in a book entitled the ground truth by john farmer and and john farmer is not a conspiracy
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:37.600]  he was the head lawyer on the commission he was the head law he was the senior counsel
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:43.600]  and he says quote in the course of our investigation the national responsive tax the 9 11 commission
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:48.320]  staff discovered that the official version of what had occurred that morning that is what
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:53.120]  government military officials that told congress the commission the media and the public about
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:28:01.520]  who knew what win was almost entirely and inexplicably untrue now that's the head of the 9 11 commission
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:06.800]  amazing information and i do what you just did all the time janin depolitano has not come out for
[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:11.840]  9 11 truth it was andrew depolitano right now i do the same thing all the time he always jokes
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:17.360]  and calls her his cousin though she's not his cousin so what are they going to do as the majority
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:22.160]  of the public is beginning and polls show this to wake up to the fact it's an inside job what are
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.400]  they going to do next time when they need to blow something up to poses our saviors this has got to
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:31.040]  really be hurting the globalist right now well it's going to pose them a huge problem when they
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:38.080]  try to pull off their next false flag operation because just like the kenny assassination 9 11
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:43.600]  hit us in the face like a wet rag you know the american public was just not prepared for that
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:49.680]  and it was such a shock such a trauma that uh you know took us a while together our senses
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:53.760]  but i think more and more people are going to be on the lookout next time and they're not going
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:58.800]  to be able to pull something like that quite as easily i agree that's why they're going with pat
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:04.480]  sees now where they find mentally ill teenagers drug them up uh get them on airplanes try to give
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:08.880]  them to blow up christmas trees right and and even mainstream media is now admitting wow this is all
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:17.440]  provocateur yeah exactly so well that you know this is actually kind of a good point it's a good
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:23.040]  thing uh i don't know about you alex but would you agree with me that the new world order is
[02:29:23.040 --> 02:29:28.400]  somewhat in disarray right now they're they're kind of running for cover and they're trying to cover
[02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:34.080]  their backsides and they they're not really quite clear on exactly which way they should go
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:37.280]  i agree with you let's come back and talk about wiki lakes and we'll get into

[02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:34.640]  barons called his work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:39.680]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye opener i can't
[02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:44.240]  stress this enough you should at least watch this free video online today he explains everything you

[02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:12.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover up you want answers well so does he so do i it's alex
[02:33:12.960 --> 02:33:22.080]  johnson's yeah gcm radio network i get excited when i think about the fact how much traction
[02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:28.480]  liberty is getting to watch the tyranny exploding makes me angry but i know it's a defense mechanism
[02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:35.600]  by the globalists knowing that uh their time is short they're hoping that the pre-programmed fake
[02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:41.360]  christians it's only a hundred and fifty year old doctrine or less keep thinking it's the end of the
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:46.560]  world and the rapture all these hollywood movies about it so they all stand down and think it's a
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:53.360]  foregone conclusion give in to evil no it's not and we're not going to give in to evil and we can get
[02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:59.920]  the hundred year to reprieve like neneva you know it just shames me that it was christians that led
[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:07.040]  the fight against slavery in this country before that that led the fight uh to to start our nation
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:11.600]  and to see christians being some of the biggest supporters of evil makes me sick because you're
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:20.000]  not christians you're following this masonic christianoid garbage now before i go any further
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:24.800]  another thing masons will say well we helped found the country we're fighting tyranny really where are
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:32.080]  you half these cops are masons out there destroying the bill of rights in fact we'll talk with jim mars
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:37.200]  about that where he thinks masonry sits in all of this at least the illuminati version of it that
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:42.240]  washington wrote about and warned about but before i go any further into wiki leaks mars has got a lot
[02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:46.800]  on that that's why i originally got him on i want to tell you about my solar backup dot com it's a
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:51.600]  great plug and play solar panel system with the charger and the controller we've been promoting
[02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:56.000]  these for over three years our listeners just give us great reviews from the folks from solutions
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:05.520]  from science it's one word my solar backup dot com or 877-327-0365-877-327-0365 my solar backup
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:14.800]  dot com also i'm going to tell you about prepair dot pro that's p-r-e-p-a-r-e-d dot pro these folks

[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:39.360]  prepared dot pro for professional crisis preparedness and it doesn't mean you're scared
[02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:44.080]  when you get this type of stuff it means you're prepared it means you're on the offense and a

[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:42.560]  all right going back to jim mars legendary researcher and author multiple time new york
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:50.800]  times bestseller good old-fashioned straw hat police crime beat reporter jfk research grand
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:58.240]  poobah his book along with one other book were integrated into the film robert groden of course
[02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:06.320]  was seminal as well and the jfk film with oliver stone continuing with the wiki leak
[02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:13.200]  situations a very complex issue but give us your um your shrewd take on that jim mars
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:23.200]  what's your take on wiki leaks jim we must have lost jim's connection i'm here hello
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:29.280]  yes what's your take on the wiki leaks well if before we get the wiki leaks can i just throw in
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:36.560]  something about the california missile oh absolutely this is huge this is let me tell you
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:45.520]  this is china slips a submarine 35 miles off our coast fires off an icbm type missile and our
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:53.040]  pentagon who had to be under the orders of the commander-in-chief all right tells us that oh well
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:58.320]  there was no danger to the united states and actually we think it was just an airplane contrail
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:05.840]  and nothing there folks alex this would be like hitler invades poland in september of 1939 starting
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:11.600]  world war two and our media says there was a traffic jam on the highways in western poland
[02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:17.200]  this morning come on well maybe it was sand in this reindeer we've had a lot of guests on
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:21.920]  like wane madson who says he has the sources in the government that it was a missile trail a
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:26.960]  Polaris copy you know launch from under the water they've had one of the former chairman of the joint
[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:31.760]  chiefs of staff or one of the members of the joint chiefs of staff we've had all these nasa
[02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:38.160]  top rocket scientists say it was clearly a missile but then the government says it was a
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:43.680]  condensation trail here's the one in telegraph today this has been announced by the chinese
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:49.280]  military china preparing for armed conflict in every direction china's preparing for conflict
[02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:53.840]  in every direction the defense minister said on wednesday and remarks that threaten to overshadow
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:58.800]  a visit to beijing by us counterpart next month quote in the coming years our military will push
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:05.680]  forward uh preparations for military conflict in every strategic direction said lang gwan guile
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:11.680]  an interview published by several state-backed newspapers we may be living in peaceful times
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:17.760]  that we are never forgetting war never send the horses south or put the bayonets on the guns away
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:26.080]  uh he said and remember over 98 percent now of rare earth minerals are coming out from chinese
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:34.240]  buying up the areas in africa uh south america and uh australia and the globalist and the cfr
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:39.200]  have done this by design they've used the u.s to fund their world government now they're gonna
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:44.240]  bankrupt us destroy our name and the chinese are our absolute rulers because they got one child
[02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:50.880]  policy they got eugenics i mean you know they want to put lithium in the water they are the future
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:59.920]  and uh this is it and and they and they already have a pyramid power system structure of government
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:05.200]  okay in other words at the very top is one guy or a handful of people and then they tell everybody
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:11.120]  else what to do so how easy is it going to be to simply put them on the board of directors
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:16.080]  or buy them off and then you control all the chinese and by the way if anybody's doubting this
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:22.400]  there are literally hundreds of mainstream news articles i've seen worshiping singapore run by a
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:30.400]  communist uh chinese individual who went to oxford and is admittedly mi6 he stages the
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:37.440]  kick out of the british in the 1960s he takes over and national geographic admits uh in their
[02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:47.120]  january issue from uh you know 10 months ago or so or 11 months ago earlier this year they admit
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:52.160]  in here that the singapore model is a test and that this is going to be the model of the world
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:57.840]  and it's total fascism i'll show folks a document cam shot of this where they have giant all-seeing
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:03.280]  eye telescreens with troops where you're executed for criticizing the government and they just say
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:08.480]  it's wonderful to be slaves they say they basically believe in eugenics and that we're animals and that
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:16.240]  we want tyranny and i mean it is just so crazy to see our media introducing evil as if it's a good
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:22.000]  thing and and china and they admit china is now going off the singapore mi6 model
[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:31.280]  yep and the thing is they're all basing this on the the current scientific dogma which says
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:36.480]  it's all in our dna you know whatever you dna may know we don't have free will we don't have
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:42.480]  any free will except now they're finding out that you do you realize you can take the nucleus out
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:49.840]  of a cell and the cell continues to function so in other words the it's not the brain okay something
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:58.480]  else it makes us who we are and it's it's not the gene okay the genes are just the means well look
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:05.280]  we're reproducing and and giving us motion you know well jim that's a con exactly it's a con game
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:10.800]  to say you don't have free will you're not allowed to have a view nothing matters but by the way do
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:16.400]  everything we say follow what we say i mean it's a mind trick it's a Jedi mind trick to say you
[02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:22.320]  don't have any free will you're an animal so you're my slave that's right and what's what's wild is
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:29.200]  is that they've always pointed to the science to say see science shows that we're just these biological
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:35.280]  robots at the mercy of the genes or whatever and yet cutting-edge biology is showing us quite the
[02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:41.040]  opposite and then it's the environment it's the experiences in other words it's the it's the universal
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:48.560]  energy that guides us not not the biological gene well god if you will i mean mainline science is
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:57.680]  now saying that dna is a receiver of some type right so where's the transmitter that's incredible
[02:42:57.680 --> 02:43:04.560]  i mean look we we we don't know one one millionth of what we really are that's true but but we're
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:11.520]  told to listen to the hired experts who say oh here's who you are you know so in other words
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:20.080]  we're down to a situation where it's just like uh whether you're a witness in daily plaza in 1963
[02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:26.800]  or whether you're watching the plume go off the california coast on november the 8th it comes down
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:35.280]  to well who you're going to believe uh entrust your government or your own line at it's incredible
[02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:40.960]  give us your breakdown on what this means what the message was from the chinese right as obama
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:46.480]  was meeting with him yeah well that's the key to the point is the timing okay first off a few
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:52.960]  months before we had conducted naval exercises in the south china sea and we were firing off missiles
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:58.880]  and doing all this stuff we were flexing our military muscle at china you know in preparation
[02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:05.440]  for uh obama's trip over there where he's begging them to continue to take the us dollar as a
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:12.080]  trading and their message was we can blow la off the map in five minutes exactly now exactly so they
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:17.760]  were just it was different that it's the same or saber rattle for saber rattle except here's the
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:24.160]  thing the pentagon and the government cannot admit that that was the chinese missile even though it
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:29.520]  was not aimed at us it didn't blow up it didn't cause any harm it was just a little show of force
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:34.800]  but they can't admit to it because think about it alex if they admit that the chinese are able to
[02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:42.000]  slip a submarine up to within 35 miles of our coast and fire off a large missile then the trillions
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:50.240]  of dollars that we've poured into our anti-missile defense system is wasted well i mean if it's a
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:55.840]  suicide mission they can't ever stop submarines the chinese have hundreds and hundreds of them
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:45:02.080]  they just pull up and fire their Polaris knockoffs thanks to bill clinton and donnell rumsfeld they
[02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:08.000]  transferred all that stuff in the mid-1990s through lauren hues to him that's right and i've said
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  and i've said for years now remember telling you this alex that should have been impeached
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:20.000]  absolutely but it shouldn't have been for sex it should have been for given our weapons technology
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:28.160]  and nuclear technology to china but that's what the cefr wanted exactly to watch those traders
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:32.800]  sit around and brag how they're destroying america and how and they're more east strong all of them
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:38.800]  moving to china i'm telling you now china is the biggest owner of our debt i'm sick of it but but
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:45.840]  alex i have to admit i do have a i am puzzled by one thing china obviously is building a huge
[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:52.400]  military their military leaders as you have said and and i've seen in the past have said that war
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:59.440]  with the united states is inevitable but wait a minute why would they want to work knock off
[02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:05.040]  their greatest consumer base i mean go to walmart everything in there's made in china but that's
[02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:12.000]  a phase to destroy all small businesses in europe england the united states they're they're using
[02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:18.320]  globalism and mercantilism to deindustrialize for a post-industrial world once they've consolidated
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:24.320]  all power and wiped out their competition then the wars the starvation uh the bio weapons will
[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:31.840]  be used to wipe the population out as henry kissinger said in 1973 so i okay it is part
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:37.840]  of the eugenics plan and part of the depopulation plan which by the way alex i cover in my new
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:44.080]  book the uh trillion dollar conspiracy uh you know and just to show that these folks they're not
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:49.840]  they're not just saying that if we don't change our ways we're going to have over population
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:57.200]  problem they prince philip i quoted prince philip he says if if i can cut if there is reincarnation
[02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:05.200]  i want to come back as a deadly virus to help solve the overpopulation problem problem so alex
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:09.840]  as you will know but most people hadn't quite got to this point these folks they're not just
[02:47:09.840 --> 02:47:14.720]  wanting to control it they want to kill it they they want to reduce the world's population it's
[02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:18.960]  all there no it's all official i've now got the rockefeller foundation documents how they put
[02:47:18.960 --> 02:47:24.160]  it in the vaccines yeah what they do and and that comes back to the chemtrails and everything else
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:30.480]  the fordation of the water the cat chemicals bad food uh they want to kill us and people need to
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:36.400]  understand this because we're when you're sitting there uh preaching on street corner alex and you're
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:43.840]  it's not just a philosophical debate this is a matter of life and death i know and i see bureaucrats
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:48.480]  and people and cops laugh at me sometimes most of them don't i mean because you got a uniform
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:53.120]  and a badge you think you're part of the system so the system couldn't do wrong i mean my biggest
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:59.120]  piece of evidence is the tens of thousands of admitted uh murderous uh chemical biological
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:03.680]  radiological test that our own government's done and every other major government's been caught
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:11.040]  murdering their own military their own bureaucrats i mean these people practice evil to see if they
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:17.680]  can get away with it it's it's all very scientific now listen give me your wiki leaks data okay quickly
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:26.400]  well the wiki leaks thing obviously is a ploy uh in a in a step towards trying to destroy the
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:32.160]  internet uh but when you go back to it and look at it from its broadest perspectives you number one
[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:40.000]  you have to wonder about this uh massage character where he came from who are his ties the thing that
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:48.240]  really gets me is is that uh wiki leaks is uh is on pirate bay uh p2p services out of Stockholm
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:55.200]  sweden which is owned by carol lindstrom a self-professed swedish neo-nazi so you know
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:49:00.400]  wait a minute is this all again another false flag thing they've admitted that none of the
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:06.320]  information that has been made public through wiki links has actually done any harm it's just
[02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:12.080]  kind of been bearish it's that these governments okay so it's kind of like a limited hangout to
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:18.800]  uh to get everybody upset and and now you have idiots that are i'd say calling for july and
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:26.080]  asos today they're calling for his execution you know and and here's the thing years ago if everything
[02:49:26.080 --> 02:49:32.240]  was if the playing field was level as we've all been taught and government's in its place to serve
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:37.040]  and protect us and god's in the heaven and is all right with the world well then you know i would
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:43.200]  tend to say yeah that's kind of bad releasing out uh secrets from the government but when you go back
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:48.960]  and see that the government has been caught lying to us not once twice three times four times multiple
[02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:55.200]  on and on and on all they do is lie to us then i'm sorry anyone who tries to bring out truth good
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:50:01.440]  bad or indifferent uh you know we should be uh supporting that rather than condemning it but
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:07.920]  i think it's so simply considering the connection is just simply a ploy to raise up this public
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:13.520]  indecision well that's the psychological warfare op they make you support asange because if you
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:17.840]  don't support him they're going to set the precedent to shut down the web and arrest people that are
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:24.000]  leaked uh information like you or i who've gotten many leaks over the years but expanding on that
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:28.720]  they now admit they're going to use it to start curtailing the web and the un has announced that
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:35.280]  just a few uh days ago ctv out of canada internet groups for un could threaten cyberspace
[02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:40.560]  they want to bring in a new sedition act uh in the year he got the cyber security act of 2010
[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:46.080]  they're trying to push through which gives the president a kill switch yeah no it's it's it's
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:53.440]  very suspected and asange admits he's excised stuff uh at the request of agency so i'm not even i can't
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:58.320]  sit in judgment of asange but the thing doesn't pass the smell test and everything we predicted
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:03.280]  whether it's now unfolded final segment with jim mar straight ahead a very wealthy u.s citizen

[02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:34.800]  be awakened and you're also supporting the alternative press we were talking about the
[02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:40.480]  alternative media i've seen statistics even from cnn going back about two years ago the
[02:54:40.480 --> 02:54:46.560]  alternative media two years ago passed the rubicon and became more influential more readers more
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:52.640]  viewers and is more trusted more than two to one than the mainstream corporate media so we've
[02:54:52.640 --> 02:55:00.560]  got this perfect storm of old media government mega corporations all pushing now to censor

[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:21.360]  for example uh it's now it's global uh they could try to you know china is still having
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:25.680]  all kinds of problems because they've tried to shut it down over there but when you can put up
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:31.440]  servers in in sweden and then russia and bounce it around to south africa and then come back to
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:38.720]  india i i think the genie's out of the bottle and i unless there's some way to just you know
[02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:42.880]  completely turn off all electricity in the world i don't see how they can shut it down
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:49.200]  now china just banned skype i mean how do you ban one of the most popular computer programs out
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:54.560]  there exactly but that shows how desperate they're getting and of course they're they're
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:55:58.800]  getting desperate in this country too and they even have a worse problem here because they've
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:04.640]  got to somehow uh bulldoze their way through congress and and and through everything else
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:10.720]  through the fcc and uh you know they've gotten a lot of control but they don't have total control

[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:39.760]  time and i appreciate you joining us here one of the last shows uh of the year uh to to give us
[02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:47.200]  a synopsis of the book okay well it's basically it's uh here's what's wrong with this country
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:52.480]  here's who's behind it and here's what to do about it uh and a lot of my past books rule
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:58.640]  but secrecy uh and uh the rise of the fourth rite etc uh people always say we always tell us this
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:03.840]  bad news you know what what can we do about it what's the good news so actually there's a whole
[02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:09.440]  section in the back of my new book the trillion dollar conspiracy that says here are ways to fix
[02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:15.920]  the broken uh society and there's a lot and unfortunately though most of them would all
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:23.520]  come back to either rescinding or or passing new legislation which then brings it back to congress
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:31.440]  which is either bought and paid for or totally intimidated through secret terror so we've got
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:36.720]  to do something about shaking up congress we thought we had the opportunity this year in the
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:45.040]  off uh presidential election year elections but uh as we can see the computer voting machines
[02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:50.240]  once again seem to have trumped public opinion no things are a lot worse than we can even see
[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:55.200]  on the surface folks if the water looks rough on the surface imagine what's going on right under
[02:57:55.200 --> 02:58:01.680]  the surface i mean this is the very serious times we everyone needs to put out their maximum effort
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:08.560]  to resist the lies the tyranny and to offer the solutions of liberty every day the fight is on
[02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:16.560]  and as we end 2010 going into 2011 these are the times that try men's souls it was the best of
[02:58:16.560 --> 02:58:22.400]  times the worst of times a lot of bad things are happening but it isn't till things get rough that
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:28.720]  people finally get up off their hind ends and that's starting to happen the destiny of our society
