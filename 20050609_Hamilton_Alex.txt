[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]  Obviously, we're going to go through this Lee Hamilton, former Vice Chairman of the 9-11 Commission,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]  appeared on C-SPAN on May 26th on Washington Journal.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  They took around 10 callers throughout the course of the 48-minute show,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]  and six of them raised issues related to the true story behind 9-11.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]  He must have been on another C-SPAN show, because I saw another clip of him on an afternoon show,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]  and he took more calls than that.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  I haven't watched all this new video you put up this hour.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  This was the May 26th?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]  May 26th.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]  You might check their archives.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]  I think there's another one where he was on with the other Chairman.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  Please continue.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  The majority of the callers raised issues relevant to the true story of government involvement in 9-11.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]  It was very interesting to see Hamilton and Brian Lamb, who attacked you last year,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]  have to sit and squirm through this barrage of truth on live television.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]  So we got six clips, short clips to play.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  All right, we'll also take calls.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]  There's a bunch of other news as well.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]  Everybody, don't touch that dial.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]  This is powerful info coming at you.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]  And remember, DU is nutritious.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]  The Army's own documents say it's deadly poison and builds up in the body
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]  and gives cumulative radiation poisoning.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  This guy says it's nutritious, basically, and I'm evil for talking about it.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]  But getting back to one of the whitewashers, the co-chairman of the 9-11 Commission,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  Paul, let's start going to these clips and then we'll get into some other news and take some calls.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]  Let's go ahead and roll this first clip from C-SPAN as Lee Hamilton gets this first call.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]  Go ahead.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]  A call in John, Connecticut.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  Go ahead, please.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]  Yes.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]  Good morning, Brian, and thank you for taking my call.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]  I'm a Washington Journal junkie.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000]  I just want to ask the following question, which is PBS aired a documentary called America Rebuilds
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  in which Larry Silverstein, who held the leases on the towers, admits to pulling,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  which is another word for imploding World Trade Center Building 7.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]  And I'm just wondering why World Trade Center Building 7,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  which was half the height of the other two towers, wasn't even mentioned in the report.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]  And I'd also like to give the following website, which has archived at least parts of this documentary,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  which is www.prisonplanet.com backslash 011904wtc7.html.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]  And I'd like if you could please comment on this.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]  Thank you.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]  We had a lot of very difficult decisions to make in putting the report together about what to include
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  and what to exclude.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000]  We collected a horrendous amount of material, stacks and stacks of it, interviewed thousands of people,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]  went over several million pages of documents.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  The emphasis at the site, of course, were on the towers,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]  and that's where the loss of life occurred overwhelmingly.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000]  It's where, if corrections are made, you can save the most lives if anything like that occurs in the future.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  And so some things were left out of the report.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  I do not recall offhand whether Building 7 was discussed in some of our annex material.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]  It wasn't.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  It may have been.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]  But I think the report itself had to focus on the primary targets.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  Shelby Township, Michigan.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]  All right, good pause.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]  That's the first clip.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  So they don't put it in the report.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]  The report says there's no support columns in the middle of the building, even though old plans say that.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  Paul, that was a great caller.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]  We commend her.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]  But yeah, Larry Silverstein says they blew it up.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  But Lee Hamilton, we didn't discuss it.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]  He just kind of glazed over it, Paul.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]  Well, that's what he tries to do on all of them.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  In some cases, they just cut the callers off as soon as they talk about something important.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  But again, it's this whole independent commission force.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  I mean, the chairman, Keane, in business with the Bin-Lardens was appointed directly by Bush.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  How is that independent?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000]  And in fact, Hamilton himself, in a different clip, we haven't got that clip, but it's on the video,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  is confronted by his past activity in whitewashing other investigations related to Bush's father.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  And he tips and squirms on that one as well.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  So I mean, that's the first clip.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  Second clip is even more important.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  It talks about how Cheney, as the plane which hit the Pentagon came in,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  was giving the order to let the order stand as it got closer and closer, 40 miles, 30 miles, 20 miles.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]  So that question is raised in the second clip.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]  Let's go ahead and roll that.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]  Start rolling again.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  Columbia, Maryland.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  Go ahead, please.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]  Good morning, C-SPAN.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]  Sir, I would like to ask you this question regarding the testimony of Laura Mineta,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]  the Secretary of Transportation who appeared before you guys on May 23, 2003.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]  And Norman Mineta was at the Emergency Operations Center in the White House with Vice President Dick Cheney
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]  around 9.20 on September 11, 2001.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000]  And during that time, Norman Mineta said to you guys that while he was there,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  during the time that the airplane was coming into the Pentagon,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]  there was a young man who would come in and say to the Vice President,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]  the plane is 50 miles out.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  The plane is 30 miles out.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]  And when it got down to 10 miles out, the young man also said to the Vice President,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]  do the orders still stand?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]  And the Vice President turned and whipped his neck around and said,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]  of course the orders still stand.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]  Now, this had to be the Pentagon, the flight that hit the Pentagon.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]  How can Dick Cheney know this and Donald Rumsfeld not know it?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]  The President not know it.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]  The military not know it.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]  And another question, sir.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]  First, I want to ask you how often do you get these kind of questions,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]  because there seems to be a whole world out there that revolves around every jot and tittle of everything
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]  that's ever been said.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  I'm suspecting that this is a conspiracy.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]  Well, that's right.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]  Hit pause.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]  Hit pause.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  Rewind it about 10 seconds.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]  We'll come back with the answer.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]  A conspiracy?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  That's the testimony?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]  That's the testimony?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  He was ordering Norval to stand down.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]  It's admitted.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]  All stay there.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]  There's a lot more coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  It just, the sun came up this morning.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]  It's a conspiracy.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]  We're on the march.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]  wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]  which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  Check out this new product.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]  I know.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  You're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.

[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]  or petroleum-based products.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]  that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]  Try No-B-O.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]  It comes with a 100% money back offer.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.

[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]  but did you know that in 25% of the cases,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]  the first symptom of blocked arteries is death?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  Don't take unnecessary risks.

[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  All right.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  Movement and Chris and Brian and Jerry and many others
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]  were still keeping that line open with the caller earlier
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  who was basically saying that we're evil because we say DU is bad.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]  Well, you've done it now.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  I was already intending to get a bunch of DU scientists back on,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]  but that's it.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]  I'm getting all the top ones in the world who wrote the books
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]  for the military unit.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  And I'm going to keep challenging you to call in and deal with it
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  and tell scientists that it's nutritious and that we're evil.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  But most of Dr. Rocky's team, by the way, have died.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  He went there for the cleanup in 1991 after the Gulf War.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]  But Paul, continuing with these clips,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]  this guy brings up a really good point of Cheney,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]  and we know what that order was even though he declared national security,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  in control of the whole quote war game
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]  and ordering the stand down the entire time.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]  Any other comments before we finish up his comment to the question?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]  Well, you said with the first clip you simply evaded it by saying
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  that it wasn't in the report.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]  Well, this was.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]  It's a direct quote, so it's not any kind of conspiracy.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]  But again, he still manages to sidestep the issue
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  and tried to absolve Cheney of anything.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  And Brian Lamb, who spent an hour and a half attacking me last year
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  but wouldn't let me on to defend myself,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]  Brian Lamb calls it a conspiracy.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]  And every jot and every tittle, you know,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  like we were a bunch of evil people for wanting to know
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  what Dick Cheney did when he was doing it.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  It's incredible, Paul.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]  It's a blatant sell, but they were pretty much on the back foot
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000]  throughout the entire show because the over half the calls were of this nature.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]  They were rocking back on their heels like they were in the corner on the ropes.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]  Let's go ahead and play the rest of that question.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]  And another question, sir.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]  First, I want to ask you how often do you get these kind of questions
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  because there seems to be a whole world out there.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  It revolves around every jot and tittle of everything that's ever been said.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]  I'm just expecting that this is a conspiracy.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]  Well, that's right.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]  Look, we're still arguing about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]  And we're arguing about John F. Kennedy's assassination.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  September 11th is one of the most traumatic days in the history of our country,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]  maybe the most traumatic.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]  We on the 9-11 Commission took our best crack at it.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  We were ordered by the statute to tell the story of 9-11,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]  put aside the recommendations.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]  We did the very best we could on that.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]  But it's a dynamic situation.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]  Information continually comes up,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]  and there's a lot of suspicion about what we found and what we didn't find.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  So these stories will continue.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]  Now, with regard to Cheney's action, he was the person in the White House.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]  The President at the time was in Sarasota, Florida,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]  and speaking to that small group, really, of children.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]  And communications were not as good as we would like them to have been
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]  between President Bush and the White House at that time.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]  And incidentally, that's one of the things we think have been corrected since that time.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]  Okay.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  But the Vice President was in the operation.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]  Oh, keep going, I'm sorry.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]  He was in communication with the President as quickly as he could be at that point in time.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  And yet, we did find a flaw in the communication problems.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]  Okay.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]  Before we go to the next clip, again, if there's a flood,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]  the President cancels what he's doing to go grandstand.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]  He saw the first plane hit, he said.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]  Then he saw the second one in the green room.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]  We have the Times of London photos.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  Then he went out and lied about it and said he never even had an idea.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  Then he said, okay, I did see the planes hit.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]  And we have all this going on.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  That was for the photo ops so we could see the President respond on national TV.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]  They talk about Kennedy assassinations, conspiracy theories, Abraham Lincoln.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  No, this is in the report that Dick Cheney was in control.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]  And in doing all of this, we know that.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]  We know they ordered NORAD to stand down.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]  We know all that happened.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]  And they just throw out the term conspiracy theory, Paul.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]  Well, yeah.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]  And we got the photos of Bush sitting in the school
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]  with the video of the second tower smoking behind him.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]  And he's on the phone as the plane is coming in to the Pentagon.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]  So he is in communication.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]  And again, it's this whole thing, it's all a big mistake.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000]  Well, a call arises on the fourth clip, the fact that if it's all a big mistake,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  why is no one connected with it being reprimanded?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]  And in fact, many were rewarded, including the visa personnel
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000]  who let the supposed terrorists into the country in the first place, got giant bonuses.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]  Well, the FBI agent that threatened to arrest the other agent
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]  so they didn't follow W199I and stand down, they got a record cash bonus.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]  But Paul, I mean, listening to these two, people say,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  well, 9-11 is so big they never get away with it.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  They're not.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  We're the majority now.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]  People are waking up.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]  Ninety-plus percent of the people in America believe the government killed Kennedy.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  I mean, anybody who looks at the facts.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  So basically, they knew it was going to come out,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]  and they just think they'll be able to ride this bucking bronco.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]  But they're not going to be able to do that, Paul.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  Well, no.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]  That's what we can talk about after the clip.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  All right, let's go to the next clip.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]  What's the third clip?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  The third clip is a little bit longer.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]  It's about three minutes.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]  Somebody raises David Ray Griffin's lecture on C-SPAN and his book.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]  All right, go ahead and roll that.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]  You're in Concord, Massachusetts.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]  Oh, good.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  I'm sorry.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]  Good morning.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]  C-SPAN's book TV recently did a lecture from the University of Wisconsin.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  And I'll wrap up the events surrounding 9-11.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]  The lecturer, a person by the name of David Ray Griffin,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  is a professor emeritus at the University of Charmant.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]  And he certainly is no freaky conspiracy theorist.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]  He is a man with gravitas.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000]  And it was his conclusion based upon the evidence that 9-11 was a
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  that the government was complicit in and engineered 9-11.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  Now, before you dismiss this as nonsense,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  the audience of over 400 people gave the person a standing ovation.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]  It seems that these theories are starting to take currency in the country.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]  And it appears that you have a lot of explaining to do.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]  Caller, let me ask you, why would the government want 9-11 to happen in Europe?
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:14.000]  Because the pretext for war, the pretext for the planning of the operation of the war in the Gulf,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]  you needed a pretext, and this was it.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]  Okay, let's assume that that's correct.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]  Why would the government want to go to war in Iraq?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000]  Well, I think there were three reasons.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]  One was to make the Middle East safe for Israel.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]  The other one was to bring market forces into that area.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  And the third one was to establish military bases.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]  Good pause.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  And then rewind it five seconds.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  Now, let me give you the reasons what PENAC said.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  Four trillion in oil in Iraq.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]  Three trillion in Afghanistan.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]  And that's discovered oil ready to be pumped down.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]  Hundreds of billions in weapons sales per year.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  A domestic police state here in America in a way to silence the sinners
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]  and put in the national ID card and the biometric control grid.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]  And, Paul, there's other reasons, too.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]  Well, yeah, primarily it was the launch pad for the war on Iran,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000]  which they kind of screwed up the planning on that one somewhat with the insurgency.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]  But, yeah, as you mentioned, there was the crackdown at home.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]  I mean, Tony Blair, right before the war started,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]  as a million people marched in London, had tanks rolling around Heathrow
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]  for a terror alert to do with missiles that later turned out to be fake.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]  And fake Ryerson reports and fake reports about Saddam's WMDs.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]  All right, back to the 9-11 white washer.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]  Back to Lee Hamilton. Go ahead.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]  The other one was to bring market forces into that area.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]  And the third one was to establish military bases.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000]  I'm not familiar in any detail with Professor Griffin's work,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]  so I don't know that I can respond.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]  But the charge, of course, that the United States government was complicit in 9-11
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]  is just extraordinary.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  And we found no, zero, evidence of that.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]  Our government planned that attack.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]  So I think the burden of persuasion is on their side here.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]  And I'd be very, very skeptical of it.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]  He said the evidence is very strong. I haven't seen that evidence.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]  Have you read David Griffin's book?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]  No.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]  Have you heard about David Griffin's book?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]  Yes.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]  And what do you do when you get a book like that?
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]  Do you have people to go over it?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000]  Well, look, we have hundreds of people like that commenting on our report,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]  maybe thousands looking at every detail.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]  We had 1,600 footnotes. They look at 1,700. They look at every footnote.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  And that's okay. That's the way it ought to be.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]  We cannot respond to every critic.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  If we spent all of our time responding to critics,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]  we wouldn't have gotten anything done at all.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  All right. I mean, this is too rich, Paul.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]  We have Operation Northwood as the official U.S. government plan to carry out 9-11.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]  Then we have the prima facie motive on the face of it.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]  We have Rick Cheney, Brzezinka Brzezinski, and then Pentagon planners saying we need, quote,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]  helpful Pearl Harbor events.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]  We have the Gulf of Tonkin never happening.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]  58,000 Americans then died.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]  Presidential libraries now release that.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  We have the blowing up of the main.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]  We have Hitler blowing up the Reichstag.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]  We have our own government with the USS Liberty.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]  We have just Operation Gladio, which was carried out.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]  Our government admits they carried out bombings and killed people to blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]  I mean, what is he talking about?
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]  What's the relevance of that, Paul?
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000]  Well, I mean, he says that it's ridiculous that the government would be responsible.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]  He is the government.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]  He's been a government pin, Paul, his political life,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]  which a caller raises in a different call, the fact that he covered up for them before.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]  So, of course, he's not going to accuse himself of being involved with it,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]  because that was his job.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]  He was staffed to do it.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]  Well, somebody should have called in about how it's, quote, an independent commission.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]  They tried to have Kissinger in his place at first, but no one bought that.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]  It was too big of a joke.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]  And, I mean, Bush appointed these people.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]  Yeah, and Keane has business connections to the Bin Laden family, just like the Bushes do.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]  And so does the chief staffer of the commission.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000]  And the rest of it that we won't feature, because it's obviously 48 minutes long,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]  is Brian Lamb basically throwing in the left-right paradigm.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]  Oh, Richard Benvenista was on the panel, so surely that makes it impartial and nonpartisan.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]  We had Democrats as well, and they're just as involved as the Republicans were.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000]  You know, Clinton having several opportunities to kill Bin Laden before Bush came to power,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]  in every instance, he refused to do it.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]  Sudan offered to hand him over.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]  Afghanistan offered to hand him over.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]  And it never took place, because he works for the same people.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]  All right, let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]  What's this next clip?
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]  The next clip is about the fact that if it was all a mistake,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]  then why is no one held responsible for it?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]  All right, here it is.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]  I'm sorry, Pontiac, Michigan, you're on the air.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]  Hi, I'm a first-time caller.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]  Thank you for letting me call.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]  I just have a couple questions.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000]  This commission, to me, held no one responsible.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]  There is no accountability.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:35.000]  That and the fact that there's so much more that was left out of the commission,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]  it leads to people speculating, I think.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]  We should be more forthright.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000]  If there's things that may not even make us happy as Americans,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]  we should be aware of those things as well.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:00.000]  If we made some poor decisions, we should have people in higher power take more accountability.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]  Did anybody anywhere in our government lose their job over 9-11?
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]  I don't think so, not so far as I know.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]  Now, who knows for sure?
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]  I mean, George Tenet left, but I think under different circumstances, so far as I know.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]  But the question of accountability is one that we wrestled with,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]  and I'd have to go back to my earlier comment here.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]  I do not believe you can say one person was responsible for 9-11.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000]  I do think you can go back and say a lot of mistakes were made.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:39.000]  Now, I mean, this guy is just mind-boggling the things that they're saying,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]  the things that they're doing, Paul.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]  And again, you said earlier, the people that were involved in 9-11, they were all promoted.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]  The people that exposed government involvement, they all got in trouble.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]  Well, exactly.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]  I mean, he's reading straight from the playbook.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]  The whitewash is to make everybody believe that it was a mistake,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000]  and you'll even have people who supposedly come out of left field to attack the government,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]  criticize the government, but it's always on the grounds of this person made a mistake,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]  this agency made a mistake.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]  And that only fulfills the whitewash that they intended in the first place,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]  which is to make people believe that it was just an error, a lack of communication,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]  when it was a directed conviction to carry out this attack, which the master plays.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]  I wish somebody would have brought up to them in their report,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]  they said that there was no support columns in the middle of the building,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]  when the towers had the biggest support columns of any building in the world.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]  And in their report, they just said there were no support columns, Paul.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]  Well, exactly, but in every case, he doesn't directly address the question,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]  which is obviously 101 what you would do in that position if you were trying to cover it up.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]  Well, also, he said he didn't know Griffin, and then he said he did.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]  Let's go ahead and go to the next clip. Here it is.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]  Head, please.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]  New York City.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]  Oh, I'd like to ask you a very, very important question.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]  How is it that you gave General Myers and Donald Rumsfeld a free ride?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]  And they had said they had no idea about NORAD on that day,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000]  when Cynthia McKinley had asked them questions in the middle of the night on C-SPAN,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.000]  and they did 100% acknowledge that there was five war games that morning,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]  and in addition to that, that Donald Rumsfeld was in total control.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]  And we also want to know who shut down the sand missiles.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]  Thanks, Paula.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000]  We think NORAD made some mistakes on the lead-up to 9-11
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]  and could have reacted more aggressively and robustly than they did.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]  We did not hold General Myers or Secretary Rumsfeld responsible for that,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]  but we did make some critical comments about NORAD
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]  and their ability to respond to these kind of attacks.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]  There's a couple of stories out there.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]  Well, I'll tell you, you can hear them coughing, chaffing,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]  really under the hot lights there,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]  and you hear lambs starting to cut people off pretty quickly, don't we, Paul?
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]  Well, yeah, and he does that again in the next clip.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:26.000]  That one, again, blaming NORAD when we know that NORAD were confused by those drills.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]  They were replacing people in the command structure
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000]  with rookies who, it was their first day on the job.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]  That came out, Tom Flocker reported that, and Willnette Daly as well.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]  And three months before, they took the power away from the generals
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]  to shoot aircraft down, which they'd had since 1957,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]  and gave it just to Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]  Let's play the next clip. Go ahead and roll it.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]  Hamilton, I'm going to go to Augusta, Georgia. Good morning.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]  Mr. Hamilton, Terry McDermott of the Los Angeles Times
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]  confirmed in an article that U.S. support of Israel
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]  was a major influence on Sheikh Khalid Mohammed,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]  who's mentioned on page 147 of the 9-11 commission report.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]  He's been driven to attack the World Trade Center tragically
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]  because of U.S. support for Israel.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]  Why isn't U.S. support of Israel one of the 41 suggestions
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]  in the 9-11 commission report?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]  You can actually see the covering war panel in which Terry McDermott,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]  again, this Los Angeles Times war on terror reporter, is on.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.000]  It repeats this coming weekend on C-Span 2 at 2 p.m. East Coast time.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]  It was from the outstanding C-Span 2 coverage
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]  of Los Angeles Times Festival of Books.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]  And Terry McDermott is asked point blank,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]  and a reference is made to the James Bamford book.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]  I'm sorry. This is the guy that calls us about every three days.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]  It's all right. Nothing wrong with his questions,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]  but he constantly violates our 30-day policy.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]  What did you hear that you want to talk about?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]  We looked at the question very hard, is why they attacked us.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]  All right. We'll be right back, folks. That's a total whitewash.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]  You know, oh, we're evil. We made the Arabs attack us.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]  That's kind of the Ward Churchill angle.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]  So we'll get Paul's comment on that,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]  and then go to your calls on the other side.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]  Stay with us.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]  Hey, folks. Alex Jones here.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]  One look in the mirror,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]  and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]  Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]  You see them here with their hands cut behind their backs.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]  were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]  This information is absolutely vital
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]  for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]  Order your video today.

[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]  during outdoor sporting activities,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]  and in hospital filtration environments
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]  such as local or national emergencies.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]  cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]  to below-detectable levels.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]  It also removes foul tastes and odors
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]  like that rotten egg smell of sulfide,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]  and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]  like lead and mercury,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]  while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]  your body needs.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]  from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]  with its rechargeable LED lighting system
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]  so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]  by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]  Finally, for millions of Americans at risk with high cholesterol,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]  there's Liquid Quell.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]  Doctor-recommended, safe, effective, affordable cholesterol control

[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]  I recommend Quell to my patients because it's been shown
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]  to be effective and safe in reducing cholesterol.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]  Quell is an easy way to improve your cholesterol profile

[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]  Here's Cheryl Gee in California.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]  Quell lowered my cholesterol significantly in 30 days,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]  something I couldn't do without an exercise in 2 to 3 years.

[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:32.000]  Paul, I guess that's all the clips of Lee Hamilton.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]  That's right, yeah.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]  And there's a few others where he got grilled,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]  so the majority of the calls were, they're exposing what they're up to.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]  You know, one other thing is, they said at the beginning
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]  of the White Wash Commission that they weren't there to find guilt,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]  just ways to keep us safe, and their recommendations were
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]  expand the Patriot Act, national ID cards, total federalization.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]  And so all that is now happening.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]  Exactly.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]  And in relation to those clips, the last two callers,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]  they kind of tried to counterbalance the whole thing
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]  because the last two callers,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]  the first of which mentioned the capture of Al Libby,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]  so-called Mr. Al Qaeda Number Three,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]  which turned out to be a spelling mistake.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]  He was actually a guy with a similar name, differently spelled.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]  He was not Al Qaeda Number Three.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]  London Times described him as floats and jets,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]  and they just picked him up.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]  He was a nobody.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]  But they used that as an example of how the war on terror is succeeding
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]  and how the Patriot Act and all this is having such a great success
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]  in fighting Al Qaeda.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]  And then another caller called in about the fact that
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]  everybody's talking about weapons of mass destruction
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000]  or the lack thereof.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]  But what about the Scud missiles that Saddam had?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]  And the British government,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]  the American government's own report stated that
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]  most of those missiles couldn't even reach the neighboring country,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]  never mind anywhere else.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000]  Yeah, 1950s-era Soviet pieces of absolute garbage falling apart.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000]  So that was used to prop up the Iraq War on the last call as well.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]  So they tried to turn it around desperately in the end,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]  but I don't think it worked.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]  Well, this is happening everywhere, Paul.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]  I talk about it.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]  I do other talk show interviews every day.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]  And I was in Chicago this morning, and it's also on an L.A. syndicated show.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]  And I got to go up against Arnold's new biographer.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]  People agree with us.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]  They don't agree with the establishment.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]  Their fraud is coming down.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]  We're going to start the third hour here in just a minute.
