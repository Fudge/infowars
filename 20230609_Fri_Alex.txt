[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  It's Friday, June 9th, 2023, and the 45th President of the United States has been federally indicted by a U.N. official.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000]  Here is President Trump last night responding to this deep state public coup to interfere and block the re-election of President Trump.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]  This is open dictatorship by an oligarchy they established in our republic. This is treason.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  Very sadly, we're a nation in decline, and yet they go after a popular president, a president that got more votes than any sitting president in the history of our country, by far.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  And did much better the second time in the election than the first.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000]  And they go after him on a boxers hoax, just like the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, and all of the others.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000]  This has been going on for seven years. They can't stop because it's election interference at the highest level.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]  There's never been anything like what's happened. I'm an innocent man. I'm an innocent person.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  They had the Mueller hoax, the Mueller report, and that came out. No collusion after two and a half years.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]  That was set up by Hillary Clinton and Democrats. But this is what they do. This is what they do so well.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  If they would devote their energies to honesty and integrity, it would be a lot better for our country.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]  They could do a lot better. They could do a lot of great things.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000]  But when you look at what's happened to our country in the last three years, we were energy independent.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  We had a strong military that wasn't woke. We were doing so well. We were respected all over the world.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]  The biggest tax cuts in history, biggest regulation cuts in history.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  And what do you do? You have a president where an election was taken.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]  Got more votes than any sitting president in history by far. Never anything even close.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  And they come after me because now we're leading in the polls again by a lot against Biden and against the Republicans by a lot.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]  But we're leading against Biden by a lot, a tremendous amount.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000]  And we went up to a level that they figured the way they're going to stop us is by using what's called warfare.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  And that's what it is. This is warfare for the law. And we can't let it happen.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]  We can't let it happen. Our country is going to hell.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  And they come after Donald Trump weaponizing the Justice Department, weaponizing the FBI.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  We can't let this continue to go on because it's ripping our country to shreds.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]  We have such big problems. And this shouldn't be one of them. It's a hoax.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]  The whole thing is a hoax, just like Russia, Russia, Russia, just like the fake dossier was a hoax.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]  You saw the Durham report. You saw the Mueller report. It was all a big hoax.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]  You had two impeachments and they lost and we won and we had tremendous support.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]  But that was a hoax and a scam. And now they're doing it again.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]  It's just a continuation. Seven years, even after I'm out. But it's called election interference.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]  They're trying to destroy a reputation so they can win an election.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  That's just as bad as doing any of the other things that have been done over the last number of years and especially during the 2020 election.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  So I just want to tell you, I'm an innocent man. I did nothing wrong.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]  And we'll fight this out just like we've been fighting for seven years.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]  It would be wonderful if we could devote our full time to making America great again.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  And that's exactly what we did. But now, again, our country is in decline.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]  We're a failing nation. And this is what they do. I'm an innocent man.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]  We will prove that again. Seven years of proving it. And here we go again.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]  Very unfair. But that's the way it is. I just want to thank everybody.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  We are doing something very special for our country. We're putting America first.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]  I always put America first. And that's why we were in a position.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]  Unfortunately, that position is no longer valid because they've done such a poor job.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  But we're in a position where we're going to make America great again.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  I'm innocent and we will prove that very, very soundly and hopefully very quickly.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  Thank you very much.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  Make no mistake. This is the assassination of Kennedy 2.0.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  But they're assassinating him criminally and politically and taking your right to vote for who you want.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]  Proof they stole the 2020 election. They're doing it now up front because the landslide is going to be so huge.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  The deep state is in big trouble.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]  Sold out for more than a year, we now have back in stock a limited run of our extremely popular

[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]  Do I stay?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.160]  Do
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]  Do I stay?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  Do I stay?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.500]  Do
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.000]  Do I stay?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]  Do I stay?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]  Do
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  Do I stay?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]  Do I stay?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]  It's Friday, June 9th, 2023.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, very honored to be here with you today.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]  Well, I knew they were getting ready to indict Trump,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  but when they did it, it was still a punch in the stomach.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]  And I'm going to do my best here today,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  Roger Stone's coming up in about 25 minutes,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  to really go through the meat and potatoes of this,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]  because I've been watching a lot of the other pundits and political analysts
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]  that are some of the smartest people out there that I know,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  and they still don't get the full import of this,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  and how serious and dangerous this is, and how reckless this is.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]  This is the first time in U.S. history in our 250 years, roughly,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  that a former or current president has been indicted by a federal grand jury.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  Now, you then look at this Jack Smith character,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]  he's known for false prosecutions.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]  In fact, he has a record, a record, he's a young prosecutor comparatively,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  for having his high profile prosecutions overturned.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]  Now, you think that means he's a loser.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]  No, it means he'll take cases that are so criminal, that are so illegal,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]  but he'll still take a shot at you, and here's the difference.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]  He's planning to indict Trump four times in the next few months.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  The document hoax, the January 6th hoax,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]  the Georgia election meddling hoax, which is also a state grand jury,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  but so are the feds, and they're looking at the cash payments as well,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]  and a whole other raft of things.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  Now, this is right as the FBI, under congressional orders,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]  released its own internal documents that, indeed,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]  Biden is a Russian-slash-Ukrainian-slash-Chinese agent.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  He's like a vending machine, you just put money in, you get it.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]  He's an agent of selling us out.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]  Not a Chinese agent, not a Russian agent, not a Ukrainian agent.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]  You put money in, you get what you want out of it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]  So that document's out that he got five million from Burisma,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  which, of course, his son was working there,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]  for massive amounts of money as well,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]  and all he knows how to do is smoke crack and have sex with underage hookers.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]  So with this insane backdrop, the same day that broke,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]  this Jack Smith character,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]  who hasn't even lived in the United States for the last decade,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  he is a U.N. war crimes prosecutor,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  and he's been on the tribunals,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]  because you don't get jury trials with the U.N.,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]  you get a tribunal of these whack jobs.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  And, of course, they couldn't convict Sullivan Milosevic,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]  so they just poisoned him to death in his cell.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]  And this guy worked on that.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]  So if you want to get your neck broken in your New York federal cell, he's the guy.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  If you want to kill somebody in their cell, he's your guy.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  If you want to set up stuff, he's your guy.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]  Then his wife is this vicious libtard
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  who produces all these anti-American TV shows and movies and documentaries,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]  including the Netflix Big Mike special on Michelle,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  I mean, Obama calls him Michael, his wife, Michael,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]  in two different speeches.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  We have the clips coming up.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  And my wife, Michael.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]  So it's all just a big joke in our face.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]  It's all about rubbing it in our face.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]  Here he is at a military commencement calling him Big Mike.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]  So that's where we get the term.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  And here she is saying he's Big Mike.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]  John Rivers was murdered by having gasoline poured down her throat two weeks later.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  Literally, the people who saw it, it was like she was fire breathing when she died.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  That's what you get.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  So I'm not laughing.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]  It's just crazy.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]  How'd she die?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]  Oh, well, her head caught on fire.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]  We're not sure.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]  So seriously, I'm not joking.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]  Look it up.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  Can't make this stuff up.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]  So that's all coming up today.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]  But just stunning, even though I knew it was coming, stunning.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]  So you say, well, you know, this whole kangaroo court thing in New York,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  that'll get defeated.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  And, oh, you know, this president can declassify anything he wants.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  And they're floating around this audio tape, a transcript of it, where he's like,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]  well, I can declassify whatever I wanted to.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]  But I decided not to declassify this Iran attack plan, but I kept it.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]  Well, he can declassify it for his archives.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]  That's what the law says.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]  It's its own branch of government.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]  And the minute other branches control it, you don't have an executive branch.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  That's why they've never indicted a president.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  Because then you're a banana republic.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  Then it's bye-bye.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]  So Jack Smith, this U.N. prosecutor, and that's actually him
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]  and his U.N. prosecutor, baby blue and black robes, is a joke.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  He's on a power trip.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  He thinks he's doing things no one's ever done before.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  No, you're doing what they do in Nazi Germany and Venezuela
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]  and the old Soviet Union.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]  And so he is a U.N. stooge.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]  We're going under U.N. treaties for our health care,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]  U.N. control of our power, our electricity.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  Everything's being turned off.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  And now, kind of a cherry on top, we have an active U.N. prosecutor
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  and tribunal member for the first time in U.S. history
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]  prosecuting the guy we all know won the last election,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000]  who is, depending on the poll, 10 to 25 points.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]  The polls where he does, these are scientific polls.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]  10 to 25, that's the range.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]  I mean, a supreme whopping lead on Joe Biden.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  Never before any number has been seen like this.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]  Five points ahead is huge, generally, with two major, quote, contenders.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]  Then you've got him in a Rasmussen poll out of a national field of Republicans,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]  69% against five other candidates.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]  Sixty-nine percent.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]  Other polls show him with similar numbers.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  Talk about Trump.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]  So they're crapping their britches because there's not enough mail-in ballots,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000]  not enough illegal aliens, not enough people that have moved out of their district
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]  who've had their identities stolen to put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]  I mean, again, they banned Tucker Carlson.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]  He goes from 5 million viewers to 100 million a day plus.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  So here's the problem here, though.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]  They keep doubling down, and even the British Ministry of Defense said
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]  the world's never been in greater danger of nuclear war
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]  and said maybe it's time to just go ahead and do a peace deal.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]  But Biden says we're never stopping nuclear wars on the table.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]  So it's all completely cuckoo land.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  These people are not going to stop.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]  And civilization, as we know, can end at any time.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]  By the way, we've now got the satellite footage and images confirming what
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]  major forestry former officials have come out and said in Canada.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]  I mean, former deputy heads of their forestry service,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]  former deputy heads of their firefighting service have come out and said,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  listen, you don't have 25 fires break out in one hour hundreds of miles apart.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]  Somebody's setting these.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  And then the government isn't going out and battling them.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]  It's all part of the crisis creation.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  And so Chuckie Schumer says pass our carbon tax rules,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]  shut down more U.S. power plants.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]  That'll put the fires out in Canada.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]  No, if you wait till there's dry weather and high winds and you send a team
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]  of 10 people out to set three or four fires apiece, and you know who it is.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]  It's a leftist cult of forest rangers.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]  That's who's doing it.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]  They go out and they set the damn fires all over the country.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  It's just 25 fires set in 100 square miles in one area of eastern Canada.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]  It's the whole country got lit on fire last week.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  And remember, over a dozen Antifa members got caught setting fires.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]  That's the police catching them.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  Good job, police.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]  Imagine who they didn't catch.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  Remember all the fires in 2020?
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]  Just in California, they were running around setting fires everywhere.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]  They're gremlins, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]  They're gremlins.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]  I mean, I don't know if gremlins really exist.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  In World War II they claimed they saw them.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  Little green men like breaking equipment on the planes.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]  We don't know what the hell they were doing.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  They just would appear in a green fog and start wrecking equipment.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  By the way, local Las Vegas News is reporting that.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  Giant green men popping up in backyards, huge flying saucers crashing.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  The police said they saw it too.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  I mean, stuff's getting really weird, folks.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  Stuff's getting really cuckoo now.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  I don't know if gremlins are real, but the Democratic Party and the communists are gremlins.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]  And this is what they do.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]  They wreck borders.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]  They wreck countries.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  They wreck families.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  They wreck it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]  There's footage of the police shot of the green UFO landing.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  They drove to the spot, and people said there were 10-foot aliens running around.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]  Everything's gone insane.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  Stay with us.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]  Do you like RainForce?
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]  Yeah.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]  So, my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]  two books with Alex Jones?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the next
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]  four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000]  So, it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  All right.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]  We love you.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]  But before we go to break, please remember, we're listener-supported.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]  We're not subscriber-based.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]  We're supported by you buying products at InfowarsStore.com, and they're excellent.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]  We're selling out of X3.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]  It's our best seller.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]  We have to end the sale because at current sales rates in two weeks, it will be gone.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]  Triiodine, incredible for your immune system, your electrochemical activity.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]  Every cell in the body, it's essential.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]  Without it, without iodine, you die.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]  That's why they're targeting iodine, taking it out of the diet.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]  You need it.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  They put the bad halogens in to block the iodine and the chlorine, the fluoride, and the bromine.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]  You need this product.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  Takes about two weeks to kick in on average.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]  Take a few drops a day.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]  InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  And it's 25% off.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]  It is your last chance.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  Discover the power of activated iodine, triiodine, trunascent.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]  Iodine takes your system just to the next level.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]  InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]  is a historic book that documents the globals in their own words, planned for our future.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]  That is the hellish future.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]  at bookstores, Amazon, or InfowarsStore.com.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]  a signed copy, at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfowarsStore.com
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]  or give them to the local school.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax. Not for a second.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:06.130]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:35.850]  Emergency broadcast Friday, globalist controlled DOJ hijacking 2024 president's election with
[00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:36.850]  Trump indictment.
[00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:42.010]  We break down exclusive intel on Trump's next move with Roger Stone, next segment.
[00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:47.490]  The deep state's indictment of President Trump is nothing more than JFK 2.0, instead of physically
[00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:53.210]  blowing his head off, they are politically and criminally assassinating him, completing
[00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:59.570]  our journey into banana republic plutocratic dictatorship.
[00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:02.170]  And that's a mouthful, but that's really what's going on.
[00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.650]  Not a shred of exaggeration there.
[00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.290]  In fact, I'm understating how bad this is.
[00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:10.290]  Now here's what's even scarier.
[00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.450]  This is going to blow up in their face super bad.
[00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:18.730]  You're like, well, isn't that good, except these crazy people never give up.
[00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:25.210]  And so this escalates out of control and ends with a whole bunch of horrible scenarios unfolding
[00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.570]  in different permutations.
[00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:32.610]  And the global is totally defeated and a very good chance we're all dead too.
[00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.410]  And they're going to keep holding us hostage.
[00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:35.410]  And we're not going to stop.
[00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.170]  And so this is it.
[00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.170]  Okay.
[00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.170]  It's called a war.
[00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:47.290]  It's all a bunch of really cocky, crazy lawyers who live in their own weird UN bubbles and
[00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:51.130]  New York bubbles and strut around and act tough to each other and everything.
[00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:55.970]  And they have no idea they got a tiger by the tail.
[00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:01.010]  But the way they do, I mean, that's why Comey would look totally freaked out with Jen Psaki
[00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.010]  a few days ago.
[00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.690]  He is confronted peacefully by the people everywhere he goes, this beautiful thing.
[00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.610]  And there's that little political operative that lied to Congress over and over again.
[00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.130]  I know nothing about leaking.
[00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.770]  No, the FBI is not leaking anything.
[00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:17.730]  He spits letters like, well, I gave it to a law professor and a media professor to leak
[00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:18.730]  it.
[00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:19.730]  I mean, I didn't leak it.
[00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:27.050]  And that's like the Gambino crime family saying, well, I, as the Don, didn't order them to burn
[00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.210]  down that grocery store because they didn't pay protection money.
[00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:35.410]  I gave somebody else the order to order or I didn't give the order for that murder.
[00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.370]  I just gave my captain the order to have them give the order to murder.
[00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.330]  I'm giving you an order to tell them to murder.
[00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:42.330]  OK, that's right.
[00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.370]  I'm telling you to tell them to murder.
[00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.370]  And so there he is.
[00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.730]  He's like, well, of course, I mean, I leaked everything, but I didn't leak it.
[00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.410]  I told them to leak it for me.
[00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:56.810]  And he's up there on Monday, he says, well.
[00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.170]  We've got to indict Trump.
[00:22:58.170 --> 00:22:59.170]  He's coming after us.
[00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.570]  I mean, we've got to not let him be the president.
[00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.410]  I mean, he'll he'll he'll he'll get control of the Justice Department.
[00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:07.730]  They'll all will all go to jail.
[00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.250]  And they just sit up there actually being honest about that.
[00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.330]  We're criminals.
[00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.730]  We're all going to go to jail.
[00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.170]  And so we've got to stop the popular president.
[00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.810]  We already stole the election once.
[00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:26.250]  Now he's 20 points ahead of Biden, 30 points, 35 points ahead of DeSantis.
[00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.570]  Chris Christie is pulling like two percent.
[00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.890]  These people are all complete jokes compared to Trump now.
[00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:36.330]  And didn't they know indicting him in New York or having that fake show trial about
[00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:40.330]  rape civil trial would only make him more popular.
[00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.850]  People see that now a federal indictment.
[00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:48.810]  And as people learn that he's a U.N. war crimes prosecutor and lives in the Netherlands and
[00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:53.330]  just came back a year and a half ago to take this over.
[00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:58.090]  And that his wife's good friends with Michelle Obama and Obama and makes movies about Big
[00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.410]  Mike.
[00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.030]  And they've got witnesses coming forward.
[00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:11.090]  They were offered money and judgeships if they would lie about Trump.
[00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.210]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.650]  This is super dangerous.
[00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:21.170]  But again, they've all convinced themselves as a political group.
[00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:22.170]  They're unstoppable.
[00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.410]  And oh, they've got the media and oh, they've got the Justice Department and oh, they've
[00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.810]  got the you know, and they could turn the power off and blame it on us.
[00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.850]  They could stage an attack and say we're white supremacist and they could they could kick
[00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:35.090]  the Russians asses and they could ship in fentanyl and they could flood the border and
[00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.610]  they could and they could cut off the power plants and they could and they're just doing
[00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.650]  it all as if rubbing our faces in it.
[00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.250]  They're like, well, we're losing.
[00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.930]  Well, just bankrupt, everybody.
[00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.130]  That'll show them to love us.
[00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:48.810]  And then we'll pose as the saviors.
[00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:53.930]  No, everyone who's got a brain knows it's you guys.
[00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.450]  And so, oh, Jack Smith.
[00:24:55.450 --> 00:25:01.090]  Oh, my gosh, his wife makes Netflix movies about Obama and his and his and his husband.
[00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:02.570]  And oh, so amazing.
[00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.170]  And Hollywood's so cool.
[00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:09.650]  And oh, Rupert Murdoch's so powerful and oh, you're so scary and oh, look, you're wearing
[00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:14.370]  purple blue, you know, Klingon outfits like Klaus Schwab at the UN.
[00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.570]  Oh, you're so magnificent.
[00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:17.770]  I never got this clip yesterday.
[00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:22.090]  The deputy head of the EU is like, and we will teach you Americans that you will not
[00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:27.410]  challenge us if you engage in speech we do not like, we will have you arrested.
[00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.330]  I mean, this is a real quote.
[00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:37.090]  So we are watching you Americans very closely and you will eat the bugs and you will give
[00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.090]  us your children.
[00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.730]  And oh, and we're going to cut your daughter's breast off.
[00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.810]  This is old and you will, of course, drink sewage.
[00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:51.610]  And we're closing half the Dutch farms and Ireland is passing laws and you will not have
[00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.650]  any food anymore.
[00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:59.170]  And we bring in the Muslims to stab the children at the park.
[00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.130]  Good stabs the babies.
[00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:16.410]  Meanwhile, all the major universities, Jews run the world, kill them, they're the devil,
[00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:17.610]  they're the worst people ever.
[00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:24.410]  And meanwhile, the ADL's Trump's a Nazi, so is Alex Jones.
[00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:28.570]  Pull Trump off the wailing wall in his yarmulke and stand him up against a firing squad.
[00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:29.570]  He's Hitler.
[00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.450]  Meanwhile, George Soros loves Hitler.
[00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:32.450]  He's good.
[00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:36.610]  It's cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.
[00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:41.210]  And yeah, a large part of the public can't find their ass in both hands.
[00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.690]  But those people don't matter.
[00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:44.770]  They're just your stooges.
[00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:51.290]  But the thinking people of every color, race, gender, you name it, know exactly what's going
[00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.850]  on.
[00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:56.170]  And you guys are not going to get away with this.
[00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.330]  But I'll give it to you.
[00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.090]  You may just destroy the planet.
[00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.090]  And you know what?
[00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.090]  Let's just start over.
[00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.010]  It's kind of like Medvedev said a month ago.
[00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:05.010]  All right.
[00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.010]  Let's just have a nuclear war.
[00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:10.970]  I mean, at a certain point, I mean, let's just kill all the Russians, they can kill
[00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:11.970]  all of us.
[00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.210]  And they'll get me, but they'll get the globalists too.
[00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.210]  So you know what?
[00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:17.210]  Absolutely.
[00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:21.010]  Before you cut off more children's penises and everything, God, maybe it is just time
[00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.890]  to just wipe us off the face of the earth.
[00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:28.010]  And if I get stepped on in the process, I'll just kiss your foot while it stomps me flat
[00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.770]  or in a pancake.
[00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:31.770]  But you know what?
[00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:32.770]  The children don't deserve that.
[00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:34.370]  So we've got to fight to preserve civilization.
[00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.690]  But I got to tell you, I wouldn't blame God one bit if he didn't blow this whole thing
[00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.390]  up.
[00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.690]  But God's sparing it for the children and wants to see what we're going to do in this
[00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:44.690]  situation.
[00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:49.730]  But I can tell you right now, we've forgotten God, it's why we're a cursed nation.
[00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:54.090]  And the feds are crazy.
[00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:58.890]  It's a mob of criminals at the top who've convinced themselves, because they've gotten
[00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.210]  away with all this crime, that they're going to go to the next thing.
[00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:06.650]  No, everyone sees you doing it, and it's sitting with their mouths hanging open, you maniacs.
[00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:07.650]  And all the crime.
[00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:12.170]  It'd be one thing if Biden was clean cut and wasn't a pedophile, and his son wasn't a pedophile
[00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.810]  and taking money from foreign governments and all the corruption.
[00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.050]  But he's like cartoon corrupt.
[00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.450]  And Trump is the opposite.
[00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:24.050]  Trump wants power and to be the guy that turns the country around and be the turnaround savior.
[00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:25.770]  Trump wants to be the savior.
[00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.750]  He wants milk and honey, prosperity.
[00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.050]  He wants to be the hero.
[00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:32.850]  He's got blind spots, but he cares about people, okay?
[00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:37.290]  You guys want to screw everybody over and are the biggest jerks the planet ever saw
[00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:42.330]  because you have a needle dick syndrome of looking down on anybody else doing well.
[00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:47.450]  And you're indicting Trump for nothing while we have this criminal stumbling around, crapping
[00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:48.450]  his drawers.
[00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.370]  I mean, what the hell is your major malfunction?
[00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.730]  What is your problem, you stupid ass devil worshippers?
[00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:23.370]  No.
[00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:24.370]  Only a few hundred bottles left.
[00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:28.290]  But the good news is we have several thousand bottles left of super female vitality.
[00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:29.450]  That's the same formula.

[00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.450]  It boosts women.
[00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:32.450]  It works great.
[00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.970]  But women like pink labels.
[00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.890]  Men like different color labels.
[00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:37.930]  So it works for men as well.
[00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:39.010]  It's the same formula.
[00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.010]  It's an incredible formula.

[00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.810]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:23.250]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every
[00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:28.330]  day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.370]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:36.730]  I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:37.730]  us.
[00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:38.730]  I know you spread the word.
[00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:39.730]  I know you pray for us.
[00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:40.730]  It's wonderful.
[00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:41.730]  Keep doing it.
[00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:45.730]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowars store dot com and you never buy great
[00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.610]  products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:52.890]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowars store
[00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:53.890]  dot com.
[00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:58.130]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowars store dot com, our funding problems
[00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.130]  will be over.
[00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.450]  Please take action now.
[00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:06.130]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:07.570]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:24.080]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:30.080]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:38.080]  All right, if you go back to 1776, July 4th, the Declaration of Independence,
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.080]  The majority of folks that signed onto that lost everything they had, including their families.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.080]  Some got put on prison ships, some died.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:51.080]  And John Hancock signed his name about four or five times bigger than everybody else's at the bottom.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:55.080]  Because he said, if I'm going to be on the death warrant list and sign my death warrant,
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.080]  if we lose, I want to be at the top of the list.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:03.080]  And he did that to show courage, not a flex, but to say, hey,
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.080]  a lot of folks are writing their names really, really small.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.080]  So I've been very critical of Trump over the poison shot.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.080]  I know how he got manipulated into it.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.080]  I've been very positive with him on Roe v. Wade and want to stop World War III
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:17.080]  and control the border and stand up to China and make us energy independent.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.080]  And the list goes on and on about taxes.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:25.080]  But when they indicted him in New York and had this rape Sybil show trial and all the rest of it,
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.080]  I said, OK, I'm backing Trump.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.080]  And the American people said that, too.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:35.080]  Now we get 69 percent of the vote in a nationwide poll of Republican candidates.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.080]  He's 20, 30 points ahead of Biden on average, 15 to 20, 30 points.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.080]  They're in total panic mode.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.080]  He is the will of the people.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.080]  They stole the 2020 from him.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.080]  And they're definitely stealing it now.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.080]  This is election meddling writ large.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.080]  So they assassinated JFK with a bullet, several bullets.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.080]  Dealey Plaza was just there earlier this week, shot a report there.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:00.080]  It's more eerie every time I go there, 60-year anniversary coming up this November.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:08.080]  And this time they're assassinating Trump with death by 100 cuts politically and criminally.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:14.080]  And if you think the deep state gets away with persecuting and prosecuting Trump
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.080]  and that we're not all next, you're a fool.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:19.080]  So I am now 100 percent, because I'm not a coward.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.080]  If I turn against Trump, they leave me alone.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.080]  They have grand juries open on all of us.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.080]  I'm 100 percent behind Trump.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:30.080]  And I pledge myself to get him reelected and to fight these illegal charges and this fraud,
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.080]  because I must be with the man in the arena.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:37.080]  I must be with the lion surrounded by the hyenas, because I am not a hyena or a rat.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.080]  I am a lion as well.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.080]  And I challenge all of you that have been on the fence to get behind Trump,
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.080]  because you know a man by his enemies, and they're coming for him at every level.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.080]  And so he's pigheaded.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.080]  I've got problems with him.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:52.080]  But the enemies of this country hate his guts and are trying to thwart your right.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.080]  You've decided to vote for him.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.080]  All the numbers show he's our rightful president.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.080]  So I stand with the people, and I stand with President Trump.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:04.080]  So I sign my John Hancock today, Friday, June 9, 2023, as big as I can on here,
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.080]  and say, all right, you guys harassed me and attacked me trying to make me not support Trump.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.080]  I backed off Trump because I don't like his mistakes and his pigheadedness.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:16.080]  But now, because of you persecuting me and Trump and others, I'm 100 percent behind him.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.080]  2024, Trump, let's go.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.080]  All right, that's my say.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.080]  That's what I wanted to get out there.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.080]  I've made my statement.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.080]  And now Roger Stone pardoned for things he didn't commit.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.080]  We all know that now.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.080]  Durham Report exonerates everybody.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:38.080]  And the preposterous idea that a right-wing Nixonian that actually helped arrest communists famously
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.080]  is a Russian agent is preposterous.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:46.080]  But, Roger, that in the past, now River and Mira, this insane crossing of the Rubicon
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:51.080]  by this U.N. prosecutor and his wife that makes movies about Michelle Obama
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.080]  and is a huge donor to the Democratic Party.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.080]  I mean, this is naked.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.080]  This is brazen.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:01.080]  And even Chris Cuomo says that this is America becoming a banana republic.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.080]  Alex, you're absolutely right.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.080]  It's very, very sad.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:10.080]  I mean, I was physically sick last night when I heard about these charges.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.080]  It is a historical continuation of a trend.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.080]  You're right.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.080]  They physically assassinated JFK.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.080]  They took Richard Nixon down in a silent coup.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:25.080]  They tried multiple times to take Donald Trump down when he was in office.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:34.080]  And now he poses such an existential threat to their entire world construct and their plan for the new world order
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:41.080]  that they seek not just to eliminate him as a political foe, not just to defeat him, but to destroy him,
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:47.080]  to send him to a federal prison where at 76 years old today, he would almost certainly die.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.080]  It is an extraordinary overreach.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:57.080]  But the irony here is that you and I are talking about the charges, yet we haven't even seen the charges.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.080]  I understand that Trump's lawyers have not yet seen the charges.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:09.080]  All they've seen is a summary of the charges, which allows the legacy media to go crazy in terms of speculation.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.080]  Which, by the way, is illegal, but they never get in trouble for it, including Comey.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.080]  But let me just say this again because I'm interrupting.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.080]  I'm skipping this break so you have more time.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.080]  This is an assault on our country and the end of it.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.080]  I want people to understand this is not about Trump.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:27.080]  Roger is physically ill because he's having his children and grandchildren's future stolen and he's in the crosshairs.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.080]  Empathy is not some loving thing.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:33.080]  It's a cellular selfishness of self-preservation.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.080]  Everyone like Trump always says they're not coming after him.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.080]  They're coming after you and I.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:42.080]  This is unbelievably dangerous, unbelievably criminal, unbelievably insane.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.080]  And you add it to everything else going on.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.080]  We are in a crisis of leadership.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:52.080]  We have a bunch of crazy lawyers who don't understand the world that have lit the planet on fire,
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:56.080]  that are getting rid of all these known conventions for hundreds of years that built civilization.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.080]  Because when you cross these lines, you unleash hell every time.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.080]  These people have committed us to a nightmare scenario.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.080]  Go ahead.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.080]  You're absolutely right.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:13.080]  And I think once again, if we look at the historical pattern, just as Russian collusion was really not about Russian collusion.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.080]  It was about distracting from the crimes of Hillary Clinton and her inner circle.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:23.080]  They were the ones profiteering off of their relationships with Vladimir Putin.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:30.080]  They were the ones making millions of dollars in business deals, banking deals, mining deals, insurance deals in Russia.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.080]  It is the same thing.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.080]  So they are absolutely naked.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.080]  They're fully exposed in the U.S. Congress.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:45.080]  Joe Biden and his son both took five million dollar bribes each to bury the prosecutor in the Burisma case.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.080]  It is coming out.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:53.080]  What is the single best way to deflect public attention from their epic corruption?
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:57.080]  Oh, Donald Trump and his handling of all these documents.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:03.080]  Meanwhile, Joe Biden has a thousand plus boxes of documents that he never turned in.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.080]  But don't look over there, folks.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.080]  Look over here.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:10.080]  It is it is absolutely a strategy of deflection.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.080]  They are so nakedly exposed.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.080]  Yet you see on CNN, MSNBC.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:22.080]  Oh, no, these are discredited charges invented by Rudy Giuliani.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.080]  False.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.080]  There are documents.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.080]  There are witnesses.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:30.080]  The FBI and Attorney General Bill Barr knew all about this.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.080]  They have sat on it.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.080]  They've done nothing.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.080]  We do have a crook in the White House.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.080]  They're now desperate to save him.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.080]  They know he can't beat Donald Trump in an election.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:46.080]  They know that they that they can't survive impeachment if it gets that far.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.080]  So what do we do?
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.080]  We indict Donald Trump on pardon the expression Trump up charges.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.080]  It's it's sickening.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080]  It is.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.080]  You're absolutely right.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.080]  There's a Constitution matter.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.080]  Is there any elementary fairness in our judicial system?
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.080]  I guess we're going to find out.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.080]  Well, let's be clear.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.080]  The reason nobody ever indicted a president and some obviously deserved it is it creates
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:12.080]  a permanent constitutional crisis where any local or federal prosecutor can become king
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.080]  and take over.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.080]  And that caused the decline of Rome.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.080]  It caused the decline of third world countries.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.080]  This is cancer.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:25.080]  This is guaranteed to now create sectarian destabilization and total destruction of the
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.080]  country.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.080]  This always leads to the collapse of empires.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:34.080]  They have literally fed the government and the country a fricking Sinai bill doing this.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.080]  It is insane.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.080]  I could not I could not agree with you more, Alex.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:44.080]  We have crossed an important Rubicon and and there's more.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.080]  I don't think we're finished yet.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:51.080]  In other words, you still have grand juries in Washington, D.C., looking at Trump's fundraising.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.080]  You still have grand juries studying January 6th.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:00.080]  There's a constant effort of guilt by association to pull you and I into that, even though we
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.080]  know nothing about it and had no involvement there.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:09.080]  They want a belt and suspenders that they want to be absolutely sure.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:13.080]  And look, I think it probably disturbs them that they have to.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:19.080]  For reasons we get into on the other side, try him in Florida, a judicial district they
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.080]  don't have complete and total control of.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.080]  And that's a little bit of a roll of the dice for the deep state.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.080]  Yeah, right.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.080]  I cut you off.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.080]  So I'm going to skip the breaks.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.080]  You get more time.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.080]  But let's explain that.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.080]  A roll the dice with this Florida indictment.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.080]  Seven counts at least.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.080]  It's all over the news.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:39.080]  We don't see it till Tuesday when he shows up for this arraignment.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:44.080]  And then, of course, you've got the D.C. jury open on January 6th and looking at Trump
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.080]  denying the election.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.080]  They're trying to say and raising money off it that it's illegal to say the election was
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.080]  stolen and raise money to fight it.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.080]  That's your First Amendment.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.080]  So let's talk about these different indictments and how this plays out and what they think
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.080]  is going to happen.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.080]  I mean, because how is the deep state convincing itself every time they indict him?
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.080]  He goes up 20, 30 points.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:06.080]  So you went up 20, 30 points with this ridiculous idiot in New York.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:14.080]  Now they have this Darth Vader s character, a U.N. prosecutor going after our president.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.080]  This guy doesn't even live here.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.080]  He offices out of the Netherlands.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.080]  I mean, what the hell?
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:27.080]  Well, Alex, evidently, there is a recent Supreme Court decision that holds that American citizen
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:35.080]  has to be tried in the jurisdiction in which the crime they allegedly committed took place
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:41.080]  in this case, because the cases announced yesterday all pertained to Trump's handling
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.080]  of documents as a former president in Palm Beach.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.080]  That would mean in the Southern District of Florida.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:54.080]  If they charged him in Washington, D.C., where they have an iron grip on the entire judicial
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:44:00.080]  system and where the chances of him getting a fair trial or a reasonable jury are nonexistent
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:07.080]  and he successfully appealed that conviction because it was brought in the wrong jurisdiction,
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:11.080]  they would have no ability to retry him in a new jurisdiction.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.080]  That is why they have filed these charges in Florida.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:21.080]  The Southern District of Florida has a number of judges who were not appointed by Barack
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.080]  Obama or Bill Clinton.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:29.080]  Although I would point out the last time Trump filed a comprehensive RICO action against
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:36.080]  Hillary Clinton and her entire criminal gang, it was dismissed by a judge here in this district
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.080]  appointed by Bill Clinton.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:44.080]  There is, I think, some reasonable chance, at least, that Trump could get a fair trial
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.080]  in South Florida.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:49.080]  And that is a roll of the dice that I don't think Jack Smith is going to take.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:53.080]  And that's why he's getting ready to file more indictments in different jurisdictions.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:45:00.080]  And not to mention this Georgia nonsense that we continue to hear about, where Trump most
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:07.080]  definitely did not tell the secretary of state to go out and find 11,870 votes.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:12.080]  If anyone will listen to the entire transcript, he tells him you have inadvertently and improperly
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.080]  counted that many votes.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.080]  And once you throw them out because they were illegal, convicted felons voting, people
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.080]  who were dead voting.
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.080]  Which, by the way, in hindsight was all proven true.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.080]  Same thing, not just there, but Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.080]  So let me ask you this then.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.080]  What is the deep state calculations when all these indictments only show the public that
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.080]  they did steal 2020?
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.080]  They're openly trying to disqualify him from running now.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.080]  This is election meddling 101.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.080]  Gut level.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.080]  How does this unfold?
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:45.080]  If Trump stays hard, doesn't back down the timeline, can they disqualify him from the
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.080]  election if they get a bogus conviction, even though it's on appeal?
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.080]  What's what's the best information on that?
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.080]  Well, the problem here is understanding the timeline.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.080]  Look, I'm not a lawyer.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:59.080]  As you know, lawyers I talk to still believe, even with the timing of these charges, that
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:05.080]  it could be extraordinarily difficult for them to get to a trial prior to the nomination
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:10.080]  phase of the party prior to to the election.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:15.080]  The real question is now, because I've been in this situation, do they put a gag order
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.080]  on Donald Trump?
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.080]  Do they restrict his travel so that he can't leave South Florida?
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.080]  That's what they did to me.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.080]  I was allowed to go to D.C. for my trial.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.080]  Other than that, I needed permission from the court.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.080]  How do you run for president with those kind of restrictions on your First Amendment rights
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.080]  and on your free travel?
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.080]  So this all remains to be seen.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:41.080]  The judge, as I understand it, is Judge Cannon, who was appointed by Trump.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.080]  I believe that is correct.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.080]  But I suspect you have more indictments.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.080]  Why are they doing this now and still at the end of the summer as originally reported?
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:55.080]  Because I think they want to expedite trial to try to destroy Trump's chances to be nominated
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.080]  and elected president.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:02.080]  By the way, I predict his numbers in the polls go up among Republicans and he will be flooded
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.080]  with new campaign donations.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.080]  Well, I think that's not even a prediction.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.080]  That's an absolute fact.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.080]  So let's talk about this.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.080]  You mentioned the Burisma documents.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.080]  The FBI has been told by Congress, hand stuff over.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.080]  They have.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.080]  And it's like, yes, we know.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.080]  Five million wired by Burisma to the crackhead pedophile.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.080]  Five million to the crackhead pedophile's pedophile dad.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.080]  All open and shut.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:27.080]  And as you said, this was covered up years ago.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.080]  The same day this comes out, I'm going to show the document, the articles.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.080]  It's Fox News.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.080]  Even CNN has been forced to report on it.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.080]  The same day this info comes out.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:41.080]  As you said, they rush this indictment of Trump to change the story and have shark eyes, you
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.080]  know, parading around.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:48.080]  So it seems to me that the that the action here, assuming that everything that has been
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:54.080]  reported about these documents, about the whistleblower, about the cover up by the FBI
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:48:01.080]  is accurate, then the only news story that would trump the indictment of Donald Trump
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:05.080]  is a vote by the House Republicans.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.080]  Joe Biden, they have the votes.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.080]  If they really have the evidence, then they should.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.080]  That isn't precisely what they should do.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.080]  This then becomes a game of chicken.
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:20.080]  Trump may be going to trial in Miami, perhaps in other jurisdictions, but Joe Biden will
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:23.080]  have to go to trial in the U.S. Senate.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.080]  And I would suggest and he's not my favorite guy, but he's a hell of a smart guy.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:32.080]  I would put Ted Cruz in charge of the prosecution within the Senate.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:36.080]  Other angles, because nobody's more informed than you on all this.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.080]  I agree.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:43.080]  Cruz will eat their lunch exposing this, but continue with what with what else this means.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:49.080]  Well, I mean, look, this is this is an effort to ensure that they are allowed to stay in
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.080]  power.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:55.080]  Despite the very best efforts of Governor DeSantis and a parcel of other candidates,
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:59.080]  Trump's position in the party has only improved.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.080]  They've already seen the backfire of the two New York actions.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:10.080]  One, the ridiculous idea that he changed business records in 2017 to affect the outcome of the
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.080]  election in 2016.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.080]  Literally impossible.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:18.080]  And then this crazy woman who goes out and says that, oh, most most women think rape is
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.080]  sexy.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.080]  That's a fantasy of theirs.
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.080]  Well, I think her testimony was a fantasy.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.080]  That's my opinion.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:28.080]  Yet Trump is never allowed to show that interview in the court proceeding.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.080]  So those actions were meant to destroy him.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:37.080]  And they had the exact opposite effect is his poll numbers took a huge spike up.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.080]  Sure.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.080]  Let me just interrupt here, because, look, Tucker Carlson goes from five million viewers
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.080]  a day to one hundred and five million a day.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.080]  Doesn't the system get the world's turning against them?
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.080]  All the numbers show that massive political realignment, not towards even conservatism,
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:54.080]  but just towards common sense and free market and freedom and prosperity and security.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:50:00.080]  But what concerns me is they just keep doubling down with World War three.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.080]  And it's like they're trying to wreck.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.080]  Why?
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.080]  I just think we're doomed because these people are still in control and they're not going
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.080]  to stop.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:13.080]  Well, I don't think we're doomed because I put my faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.080]  And I believe the Bible tells us that good triumphs over evil in the end.
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:24.080]  Remember, Alex, in every battle in the Bible, the Lord's forces were overwhelmingly outnumbered,
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.080]  yet they were always victorious.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.080]  So I'm Roger.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.080]  I totally agree with you.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.080]  I'm trying to speak to people that don't believe in God that support the system.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:35.080]  Can't minions of the system see everyone sees you?
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:38.080]  Most people hate you and you're destroying everything.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.080]  And you're you're idiots.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.080]  I'm trying to say to them, they don't believe in God.
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.080]  You're destroying everybody along with yourself.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:46.080]  What is your problem?
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:50.080]  Because they actually think that they didn't hit Trump hard enough in New York knows the
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:56.080]  reason it didn't work was because we didn't hit him hard enough that that arcane business
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:02.080]  deal in which they claim some woman was paid hush money because of this alleged rape.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.080]  That wasn't harsh enough.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.080]  So now let's hit him with essentially charges of treason and espionage.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:13.080]  Although it would be nice if the court would release the charges so we could find out exactly
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.080]  what it is he's been accused of.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.080]  He's not even in that position yet.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.080]  So they just keep ratcheting up.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:23.080]  They also know, frankly, that the system is a broken system.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:29.080]  Look, I was stupid enough to think the morning that twenty nine FBI agents raided my home
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:35.080]  at six o'clock in the morning, you know, in full SWAT gear, brandishing fully automatic
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:42.080]  M4 assault weapons showing up in 17 armored vehicles with a helicopter and amphibious units.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:45.080]  I was stupid enough to think I was going to get a fair trial.
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:50.080]  I was stupid enough to think that I would be able to put on, you know, a cogent defense.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.080]  What was I wrong?
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.080]  So they think that they can game the system.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.080]  They think that there is no way they can lose.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:04.080]  And Trump, particularly an enlightened Trump, a Trump who has the experience of his first
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:11.080]  term fully and completely now understands the evil of the deep state and the broken two
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:16.080]  party duopoly in Washington, where unbeknownst to him, half the Republicans were trying to
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.080]  screw him while he was president.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.080]  Now he's fully awake.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.080]  And that's the last thing they can possibly afford.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:28.080]  States who understands who is trying to undermine and destroy the country.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.080]  And by the way, Roger, interrupt you.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:32.080]  You've been saying that for two and a half years, that Trump's reenergized, more dangerous
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.080]  than ever.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.080]  He wasn't going to run it first.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.080]  They decided to.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.080]  That's what Comey said last weekend with Jen Psaki.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.080]  We've already played the club.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:40.080]  I'm not going to bore folks with it again.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.080]  But, I mean, he said, well, he's going to arrest us and prosecute us.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.080]  So we've got to take him out.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.080]  They're openly admitting that.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.080]  So this is just insane.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:51.080]  This is so dangerous.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:56.080]  Yeah, this is the same James Comey who now we know, thanks to the Durham report, was running
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:01.080]  around insisting that the PP tape and the Steele dossier was real long after it had
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.080]  been fully discredited internally.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.080]  And he knew it was all BS.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:10.080]  I have to admit, I love the way that Jim Comey, who's almost seven feet tall.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.080]  He's a very big guy.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.080]  He's completely and totally intimidated by little Laura Loomer.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:18.080]  She just shut him down.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.080]  And then more recently by our friend Owen Schroer.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.080]  These folks are patriots.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.080]  He's a physical coward.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.080]  He can't even answer questions in his own defense.
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.080]  He is so epically corrupt.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:35.080]  And remember, they convicted you in a kangaroo court of lying to Congress when you never
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.080]  lied.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.080]  I was in the middle of it.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.080]  Everything you said was true because we were talking about it.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.080]  You had sources that knew Assange.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.080]  Assange was all over the news back then.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.080]  You were trying to find out what he had.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.080]  He said it's Clinton stuff.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.080]  You said this is going to be big.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:52.080]  You were literally convicted for telling Congress that you were not talking to Assange when
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.080]  you never talked to Assange.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:59.080]  And then now here is Comey admitting he leaked all the stuff on Trump.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:04.080]  But it's OK because he gave it to a media professor to do the leaking.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.080]  That's the same thing as leaking.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.080]  But Hillary Clinton is doing cartwheels today.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:13.080]  She's out selling hats that say, what about the email?
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.080]  Yeah, what about the emails?
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:21.080]  Hillary Clinton destroyed with a hammer and beach blitz 33,000 emails, including classified
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:24.080]  information that was on an illegal server.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.080]  And she was never prosecuted.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:29.080]  James Comey gave her a pass.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:33.080]  She is rubbing our face in it right now that Donald Trump has been charged.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:39.080]  She she's out screaming, crowing about the fact that there's a two tiered justice system.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:43.080]  By the way, there's no statute of limitations on treason.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:47.080]  You don't think it's occurred to her that Donald Trump gets back in the White House.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.080]  She and her husband might be prosecuted.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:57.080]  I mean, they did sell top secret missile targeting information to the Chinese in return for illegal
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.080]  campaign contributions.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.080]  You don't think that's dawned on her?
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.080]  It's incredible.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:06.080]  When they first got into office, the Clintons gave the ICBM multi warhead reentry device
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.080]  technology that's so critical.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:12.080]  So instead of having one warhead and ICBM coming back in to the atmosphere, you can have dozens
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:17.080]  and including dummies so that the targeting systems don't take out all the warheads.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.080]  Absolutely critical to nuclear war.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.080]  If you're going to have it to the mutually assured destruction doctrine.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.080]  Speaking of that, let's play a clip of him.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:29.080]  This is when he's on C-SPAN years ago bragging that they fired the prosecutor.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.080]  Now we know that he got a five million dollar bribe.
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:35.080]  So here he is bragging about crimes on television.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:41.080]  I remember going over convincing our team or others to convincing us that we should
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.080]  be providing for loan guarantees.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:48.080]  And I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:54.080]  And I was going supposed to announce that there was another billion dollar loan guarantee.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:56:01.080]  And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.080]  against the state prosecutor.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.080]  And they didn't.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.080]  So they said they had, they were walking out to press conference.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:09.080]  I said, no, I said, I'm not going to, we're not going to give you the billion dollars.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.080]  They said, you have no authority.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.080]  You're not the president.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.080]  The president said, I said, call him.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.080]  I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting a billion dollars.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.080]  I said, you're not getting a billion.
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.080]  I'm going to be leaving here.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.080]  I think it was what, six hours.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.080]  I look, I said, I'm leaving in six hours.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:26.080]  If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.080]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.080]  Got fired.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.080]  And they put in place someone who was solid.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:39.080]  Now, look at the body language of Richard and Haas and the other guy.
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:42.080]  The smugness of them being above the law.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:44.080]  They can brag about crimes in public.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.080]  Pride go before a fall, Roger.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.080]  There's no way these criminals get away with this.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.080]  It's so naked.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.080]  The world's turning against them.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:53.080]  Closing comments on where you think this all goes.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.080]  We should obviously be praying for President Trump.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:57.080]  But he seems, you know, do five more minutes with us.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.080]  You got to go.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.080]  Just real quick.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.080]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.080]  Super female vitality is selling out.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.080]  But super female vitality, because women want a different package,
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.080]  is the same as female vitality.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.080]  It's amazing.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.080]  50% off.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.080]  It's the last day, and it is the last day for X3 to be 25% off.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.080]  It's selling out.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.080]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:20.080]  And, Roger, how do people find your 5 p.m. nightly show that's so popular?
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.080]  Go to stonezone.live.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:26.080]  Stonezone.live at 5 o'clock Eastern, 4 o'clock Central today.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.080]  We're going to be talking all about the Trump endorsements.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.080]  Stonezone.com, my website.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.080]  Stonezone.com.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:34.080]  I'm going to talk five more minutes with you on the other side of this two-minute break
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:37.080]  about how Trump's holding up and what you expect him to do,
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.080]  because he always gets stronger under attack.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.080]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone and then a ton of news after that.
[00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:51.230]  You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce?
[00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:56.230]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley. How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:57:56.230 --> 00:58:00.230]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:06.230]  and now two books with Alex Jones? That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:10.230]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:14.230]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:19.230]  The one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:23.230]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:27.230]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:33.230]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:34.230]  All right, we love you. We'll be right back.
[00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:39.230]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at infowarstore.com.
[00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:41.230]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:54.230]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:58:54.230 --> 00:59:00.230]  We made it even stronger, the strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:07.230]  TurboForce is back in stock at infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:13.230]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:15.230]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:20.230]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:27.230]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:30.230]  It is the super fuel.
[00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:32.230]  RainForce Plus is great. RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:37.230]  They're two different nootropics. They go good with this, but this is the king kong.
[00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:39.230]  This is the boss.
[00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:43.230]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, infowarstore.com.
[00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:46.230]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:57.230]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:57.230 --> 01:00:09.230]  All right, we've got so much news and a huge guest coming up as well in the third hour
[01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:12.230]  on all this crazy UFO stuff that's going on.
[01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:14.230]  We've got the inside scoop on what's really happening.
[01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:19.230]  Insane supposed big green flying saucer crashed in Las Vegas a few days ago
[01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:23.230]  and multiple witnesses and houses saw 10-foot green aliens running around.
[01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:26.230]  I think it's a psyop. We'll be talking about that in the third hour.
[01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:33.230]  Front and center is the president indicted by a political operative who's a former U.N. prosecutor,
[01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:36.230]  a globalist, donates to the Democratic Party.
[01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:41.230]  His wife makes movies about Michelle Obama, made-for-TV reality shows with her,
[01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:43.230]  good friends with her, totally preposterous.
[01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:46.230]  Everything they say Trump's doing, they've done.
[01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:48.230]  It's just an insane backdrop. You can't make this up.
[01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:51.230]  But in closing, the time we have with the great Roger Stone,
[01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:54.230]  former political prisoner in his own right, pardoned by the president
[01:00:54.230 --> 01:01:00.230]  in this ongoing seven years of persecution, how is the big guy doing?
[01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:02.230]  He obviously expected this.
[01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:04.230]  I know you can't get into the inside baseball talking to him.
[01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:08.230]  But how's the president doing and can we pray for him?
[01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:10.230]  What should we do and what should we know?
[01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:13.230]  I think that, first of all, he is resolute.
[01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:17.230]  He's angry, as he should be, because this is insulting.
[01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:23.230]  But he is not hysterical or unhinged or any of the things that the media will try to say.
[01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:26.230]  I think he's angry, but he's extraordinarily resolute.
[01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:29.230]  And he's going to slug this out.
[01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:33.230]  I have some concern about his lawyers.
[01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:41.230]  He announced a little while ago that two of his lawyers, Jim Trustee and John Rowley, had resigned.
[01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:45.230]  Todd Blanch, the lawyer that he has in the New York matter,
[01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:49.230]  frankly, I have found underwhelming in his handling of the New York cases.
[01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:53.230]  I hope the president will seek first-rate political counsel.
[01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:56.230]  Don't you like people like David Schoen?
[01:01:56.230 --> 01:02:00.230]  I think David Schoen, I watched him last night with Laura Ingraham.
[01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:01.230]  He was brilliant.
[01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:04.230]  I watched him with the Jackals on CNN.
[01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:05.230]  He beat them back.
[01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:07.230]  I think he's the smartest lawyer I know.
[01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:12.230]  I would hope the president will call out to him, but that is, of course, not my call.
[01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:15.230]  The point is, this is going to be a multi-front war.
[01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:17.230]  He needs more than one lawyer.
[01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:20.230]  There's no way one lawyer can handle all of this.
[01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:22.230]  But he's in a fighting spirit.
[01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:29.230]  And by the way, for those of you who think this may end his campaign for president, not a chance.
[01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:32.230]  Not even a scintilla of a chance.
[01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:36.230]  He remains committed to taking this country back and making it great again.
[01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:39.230]  And he understands that this really isn't about him.
[01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:40.230]  It really isn't.
[01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:41.230]  It's about us.
[01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:43.230]  He's just in the way.
[01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:49.230]  So they have to take him out because they want to continue the downward spiral of America.
[01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:55.230]  And they know they can't win a free, fair, honest, transparent election.
[01:02:55.230 --> 01:03:02.230]  And the fact that they haven't stopped him yet with everything they've thrown at him just makes them more hysterical.
[01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:04.230]  Makes them make mistakes.
[01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:06.230]  I think this is going to prove to mistake.
[01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:10.230]  It's kind of like that which does not kill me makes me stronger.
[01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:13.230]  I think Donald Trump is going to emerge stronger than ever.
[01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:15.230]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:16.230]  That's what's been happening.
[01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:19.230]  And they think he's like a coward like them.
[01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.230]  A Harvard social climber.
[01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:26.230]  He's part of that Harvard cult of a bunch of cowards and people that just scratch each other's backs.
[01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:28.230]  They keep thinking he'll finally give up.
[01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:29.230]  He'll finally be intimidated.
[01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:32.230]  No, he's crossed the Rubicon.
[01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:35.230]  Totally turned himself over to the fight.
[01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:36.230]  Committed to the destiny.
[01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:37.230]  That's what you've done.
[01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.230]  That's what I've done.
[01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:39.230]  That's what we're all doing.
[01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:43.230]  All they're doing is inspiring everybody to commit to the fight as well.
[01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:47.230]  And even if they wipe him out like the Texans at the Alamo, that will only encourage people more.
[01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:50.230]  But they keep thinking we're cowards like them.
[01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:52.230]  No, the Alamo didn't intimidate Texans.
[01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:53.230]  It pissed them off.
[01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:54.230]  And so they killed Trump.
[01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:55.230]  It only makes it stronger.
[01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:56.230]  I hope that doesn't happen.
[01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:58.230]  But I just hope they understand we have the fighting spirit.
[01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:59.230]  We built the country.
[01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:00.230]  We love God.
[01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:01.230]  You love Satan.
[01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:02.230]  You will be defeated.
[01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:04.230]  You know where he is right now, Alex?
[01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:06.230]  He's out playing 18 holes of golf.
[01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:08.230]  Does that tell you everything you need to know?
[01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:10.230]  He's not cowering under his bed.
[01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:12.230]  He's out playing golf.
[01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:16.230]  They have really bit off more than they can chew, Roger.
[01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:20.230]  Do you think the average globalist knows how much trouble they're in right now?
[01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:28.230]  No, actually, I think they think they have the upper hand because smugness and arrogance is the trademark for these people.
[01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:33.230]  What do you think Rupert Murdoch thinks with Tucker Carlson getting 105 million views per show now?
[01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:35.230]  Oh, wait a minute.
[01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:42.230]  I read in the book that that was a disaster, that Tucker's show was an extraordinary disaster because he didn't have the bells and whistles of Fox.
[01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:45.230]  I think the two shows I've seen have been extraordinary.
[01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:46.230]  I agree.
[01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:48.230]  We're going to play some of it coming up right now.
[01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:49.230]  Roger, we love you.
[01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:51.230]  We'll see you at 5 o'clock today with your own show.
[01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:52.230]  God bless you.
[01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:53.230]  Be safe, my friend.
[01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:54.230]  Thank you.
[01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:55.230]  I love you.
[01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:56.230]  All right.
[01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:57.230]  I love all the viewers.
[01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:58.230]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:59.230]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:04.230]  In the short time we have, I can't get into all the incredible ingredients in Superfemale Vitality.

[01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:20.230]  Supermale Vitality is selling out.
[01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:23.230]  It's an incredible formula for stamina, energy, libido.
[01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:24.230]  Only a few hundred bottles left.
[01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:29.230]  But the good news is we have several thousand bottles left of Superfemale Vitality that's the same formula.
[01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:30.230]  It boosts men.
[01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:31.230]  It boosts women.
[01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:32.230]  It works great.
[01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:34.230]  But women like pink labels.
[01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:36.230]  Men like different color labels.
[01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:38.230]  So it works for men as well.
[01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:39.230]  It's the same formula.
[01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:40.230]  It's an incredible formula.
[01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:41.230]  And it funds our operation.

[01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:08.230]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:13.230]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:15.230]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:26.230]  We are coming on the air with historic news.
[01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:32.230]  For the first time ever in American history, a former president of the United States has been indicted.
[01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:41.230]  I never thought anything like this could happen in America.
[01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:47.230]  This is the boldest election interference ever attempted in this country's history.
[01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:49.230]  They're not prosecuting President Trump.
[01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:51.230]  They're persecuting him.
[01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:57.230]  And it's all because he's the leading Republican candidate for the presidential election for 2024.
[01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:59.230]  I think the Democrats know this has nothing to do with the law.
[01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:01.230]  They're sending a message.
[01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:07.230]  And the message is they will use any power that they have to interfere in the next presidential election.
[01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:08.230]  Trump is obviously innocent.
[01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:10.230]  This is obviously political persecution.
[01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:13.230]  And the Democrats are obviously the most corrupt political party in American history.
[01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:15.230]  Nobody should be violent over this.
[01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:19.230]  I'm really concerned they could stage a false flag, a provocateur something.
[01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:22.230]  They've really primed the media that Republicans are going to be violent.
[01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:24.230]  That's the last thing we need.
[01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:25.230]  We're not anti-vote.
[01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:26.230]  We're not the left.
[01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:31.230]  According to news reports all over the country today, the arrest of Donald Trump is imminent.
[01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:34.230]  Maybe as early as this week, Thursday or Friday, so we hear.
[01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:38.230]  I mean, it's this crazy world that Donald Trump has dragged this country into.
[01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:43.230]  But he could be wearing an ankle bracelet while accepting the nomination at the Republican convention.
[01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:47.230]  And could be wearing an ankle bracelet and be elected in November.
[01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:52.230]  Yes, but you could have a president who is potentially incarcerated when he's elected president.
[01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:59.230]  Congressman James Comer revealing that he has identified at least $10 million that the Biden family has taken in
[01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:02.230]  from foreign companies looking for inroads into America.
[01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:06.230]  We have people that want to come forward, but honestly, Maria, they fear for their lives.
[01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:12.230]  Their informant will be killed if unmasked based on the info he has brought forward about the Biden family.
[01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:15.230]  Folks, the FBI is a growing threat to the Republic.
[01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:20.230]  We all know it's time to fire this rogue government that's hijacked our country.
[01:08:26.230 --> 01:08:31.230]  Well, everybody says they'd like a chance to save the country or be part of history.
[01:08:31.230 --> 01:08:33.230]  At least most people I know say that.
[01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:35.230]  Well, look around you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:38.230]  This country was born in 1776.
[01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:41.230]  We had to fight like hell to secure it.
[01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:46.230]  And now it's being taken over right in front of your eyes.
[01:08:46.230 --> 01:08:48.230]  By not King George III.
[01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:53.230]  He was an angel, a saint compared to these people.
[01:08:53.230 --> 01:09:03.230]  These are technocrat, transhumanist that think they're God and love to have sex with children and worse.
[01:09:04.230 --> 01:09:08.230]  A cult of crazy people.
[01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:10.230]  A death cult.
[01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:16.230]  And we are sitting here with them pissing in our faces.
[01:09:20.230 --> 01:09:27.230]  And we've got so many yes men and so many yes women in the Hollywood system
[01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:30.230]  and the whole corporate culture now in the world
[01:09:31.230 --> 01:09:38.230]  that is about subservience to lies, subservience to illogical, mindless fallacies.
[01:09:40.230 --> 01:09:42.230]  And this is how it works.
[01:09:42.230 --> 01:09:46.230]  First they say, we're going to arrest you if you say the N word.
[01:09:46.230 --> 01:09:50.230]  And you say, well, I don't agree with hurting people's feelings about what color they are.
[01:09:50.230 --> 01:09:53.230]  I don't agree with arresting them, but okay.
[01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:56.230]  And then next, don't say mother and father.
[01:09:56.230 --> 01:09:58.230]  And next, don't say there's two genders.
[01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:01.230]  Or we'll arrest you in California.
[01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.230]  I have articles today about it.
[01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:07.230]  Oh, and if you speak up against little girls having their breasts cut off,
[01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:09.230]  little boys their genitals cut off,
[01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:14.230]  and then horrible open wounds put in their bodies that never heal,
[01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:16.230]  well, you're the bad person.
[01:10:17.230 --> 01:10:23.230]  These are all litmus tests to see what craziness you'll submit to.
[01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:26.230]  That's what cults do.
[01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:29.230]  They tell you, stand on one leg and bark like a dog.
[01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:33.230]  They tell you, go rob that liquor store and shoot the clerk in the head for no reason.
[01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:37.230]  They tell you, cut your son's penis off.
[01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:39.230]  That's who they are.
[01:10:40.230 --> 01:10:43.230]  And then we sit here and watch all this tyranny around us,
[01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:45.230]  and we wonder why it's happening,
[01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:52.230]  because it's psychologists and psychiatrists and this guild of control freaks
[01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:54.230]  that want to play God.
[01:10:54.230 --> 01:10:57.230]  I'm not saying all psychologists are bad and all psychiatrists are bad,
[01:10:57.230 --> 01:11:01.230]  but in the main, the Germans and the British 200 plus years ago
[01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:04.230]  developed the mind sciences to control populations.
[01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:08.230]  They developed all the terms and all the names for human nature and what we do.
[01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:10.230]  They didn't create it.
[01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:13.230]  They just defined it and then manipulated it.
[01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:19.230]  And they're using mind science on us to control us,
[01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:24.230]  but they themselves are the degenerate, insane, twisted, messed up freaks
[01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:26.230]  because they're willing to do these things.
[01:11:27.230 --> 01:11:30.230]  We can go study manipulation and lies and fraud and evil.
[01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:34.230]  We can set up systems of evil, but we don't want to do that.
[01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:35.230]  Why would we want to hurt people?
[01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:38.230]  Because we feel good about ourselves.
[01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:40.230]  We have honor.
[01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:43.230]  We want to help other people because, quite frankly, we're confident.
[01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:48.230]  We can see beauty and see goodness, and we want to promote it.
[01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:51.230]  And we don't need to put people down to feel good about ourselves.
[01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:53.230]  We innately have a connection to God,
[01:11:53.230 --> 01:11:57.230]  and we understand God's prime directive to go out and be the light of the world.
[01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:04.230]  But let me just do this because I've got so much to cover,
[01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:05.230]  and it's so frustrating.
[01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:08.230]  I get in here so many days, and after the show, I go,
[01:12:08.230 --> 01:12:09.230]  man, I covered five stacks.
[01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:10.230]  There were 30 stacks.
[01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:15.230]  Today, there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
[01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:21.230]  16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 stacks.
[01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:23.230]  Some stacks are 30, 40 articles.
[01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:24.230]  Some stacks are five articles.
[01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:25.230]  30-plus stacks here.
[01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:31.230]  Each one of these is an incredible story illustrating these people.
[01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:33.230]  Each one of these is a whole show.
[01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:41.230]  A psychotic Islamic Arab running around, stabbing eight people,
[01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:43.230]  many of them babies, with a butcher knife.
[01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:46.230]  And if you try to say he's a Muslim, you're banned off the Internet,
[01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:48.230]  and the EU is threatening to have Elon Musk arrested
[01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:50.230]  if he allows this video to be seen on Twitter.
[01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:52.230]  I have a clip of them saying that.
[01:12:53.230 --> 01:12:55.230]  The crime isn't stabbing babies.
[01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:03.230]  The crime is letting you know it's happening.
[01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:06.230]  And the crime is those women.
[01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:10.230]  I mean, what woman would go out anywhere without a handgun in their purse?
[01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:12.230]  Oh, sorry, can't have it.
[01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:14.230]  Imagine if that was Texas.
[01:13:14.230 --> 01:13:15.230]  There's 20 women at that park.
[01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.230]  Guarantee you two of them, three of them would have a gun.
[01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:19.230]  If that guy tried that, he'd be dead in seconds.
[01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:23.230]  She'd unload that revolver or that handgun right to his filthy chest.
[01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:25.230]  He'd be gone, gone, gone.
[01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:28.230]  But instead, he could run around in Al-Akhbar
[01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:31.230]  and stab a bunch of these French women.
[01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:37.230]  How many of those French women do you think voted for open borders
[01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:38.230]  and think it's cute and fun?
[01:13:39.230 --> 01:13:42.230]  Not so fast now when he stabs those babies in the head.
[01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:46.230]  Yeah, I got some footage of him stabbing the baby in the stroller right here.
[01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:49.230]  And look how weak that guy is, man.
[01:13:51.230 --> 01:13:53.230]  Yeah, I'd like to spit some beach nut in that dude's eye
[01:13:53.230 --> 01:13:55.230]  and shoot him with my old .45.
[01:13:58.230 --> 01:14:00.230]  You know, and I'm too confident of a person.
[01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:03.230]  I got guns in all my cars and guns in my house.
[01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:06.230]  But I got a tendency to not conceal carry even though I got a license.
[01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:08.230]  I know you don't need a license, blah, blah, blah.
[01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:10.230]  But I got it back when I was a thing.
[01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:13.230]  But I'm pledging henceforth to carry at all times.
[01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:15.230]  I'm kind of lazy.
[01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:18.230]  I don't like having to carry it even though it's a compact block on my side.
[01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:19.230]  My belly hangs over a little.
[01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:21.230]  But you know what?
[01:14:21.230 --> 01:14:23.230]  I have a responsibility to carry at all times.
[01:14:24.230 --> 01:14:25.230]  Starting today, I'm going to carry at all times.
[01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:27.230]  Because you never know.
[01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:29.230]  See, that's just one of the stories.
[01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:32.230]  And that ties in.
[01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:34.230]  See, what I do is I tie it into things.
[01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:36.230]  I've got about eight stories concerning that.
[01:14:37.230 --> 01:14:40.230]  Then Gavin Newsom proposes 28th Amendment to ban the Second Amendment.
[01:14:42.230 --> 01:14:47.230]  The DOJ got caught trying to bribe attorney for Trump's valet in exchange for testimony against Trump.
[01:14:48.230 --> 01:14:49.230]  You've got that.
[01:14:49.230 --> 01:14:52.230]  You've got congressmen coming out saying they've seen the footage.
[01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:54.230]  It won't be released.
[01:14:54.230 --> 01:14:55.230]  But some has been released.
[01:14:55.230 --> 01:14:59.230]  A plainclothes police commanding people to break in and telling them to attack police.
[01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:00.230]  I mean, we already knew that.
[01:15:00.230 --> 01:15:01.230]  But now we've got that.
[01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.230]  Now we've got that.
[01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:12.230]  We've got more than 66% of U.S. at risk for power outages due to Biden's green transition.
[01:15:14.230 --> 01:15:15.230]  What a green transition.
[01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:16.230]  It's a post-industrial world.
[01:15:18.230 --> 01:15:23.230]  FBI arrests Nate Paul, the real estate mogul in Austin who works with Ken Paxton.
[01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:28.230]  So they're closing the net on Paxton that Trump was looking to be his next attorney general.
[01:15:29.230 --> 01:15:34.230]  We've also got Biden making some incredible statements about he doesn't work for America.
[01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:36.230]  His interests are all for NATO.
[01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:40.230]  Satellite imagery of fires being simultaneously set all over Canada.
[01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:46.230]  And we got jaw-dropping numbers on multiple fronts of victory.
[01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:48.230]  Let me hit some of the victory news.
[01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:51.230]  Some of the really positive news when we come back.

[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:18.120]  Tri-iodine, incredible for your immune system, your electrochemical activity,
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.120]  every cell in the body, it's essential.
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.120]  Without it, without iodine, you die.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:24.120]  That's why they're targeting iodine, taking it out of the diet.

[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.120]  Please take action now.
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.120]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil,
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.120]  which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:11.120]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.120]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:18.120]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.120]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:26.120]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.120]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:35.120]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:40.120]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface,
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:46.120]  our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:52.120]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:59.120]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:06.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:36.470]  I must've dreamed a thousand dreams, been haunted by a million screams, but I could hear them marching feet, they're moving into the street.
[01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:39.470]  Now did you read the news today?
[01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:44.470]  Imagine all the incredible crimes, the Clintons, the Obamas, the Bidens.
[01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:47.470]  But I can see the fires still lighting.
[01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:50.470]  The incredible arrogance, all of them caught red-handed.
[01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:52.470]  Into the night.
[01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:56.470]  And the Justice Department, they control their coup over America.
[01:20:56.470 --> 01:21:08.470]  Now indicts the real president for having classified documents that all these presidents have, that he's allowed to have, that he can classify, declassify anytime he wanted to.
[01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:10.470]  It's his own branch of government.
[01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:12.470]  That's how he can pardon people.
[01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:15.470]  And the only judge is you at the ballot box.
[01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:24.470]  But as soon as these courts and the executive branch itself is over the president, they have now made themselves the executive.
[01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:27.470]  The president's the closest thing we have to a sovereign.
[01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:34.470]  Because our founders fought a war to stop a king, but they said in emergencies, in serious situations, you've got to have somebody in charge.
[01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:37.470]  And that's dangerous.
[01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:42.470]  But instead, they just turned all these lawyers and bureaucrats into little mini-presidents.
[01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:46.470]  And that's what they've just done.
[01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:53.470]  I mean, I'll tell you, if local prosecutors indicted Biden, I would say that's dangerous.
[01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:55.470]  He should just step down and go away.
[01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:57.470]  That's why Napoleon, they never put him in prison.
[01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:59.470]  They just sent him to an island.
[01:21:59.470 --> 01:22:06.470]  Because if you start doing that, there's constant coup attempts over the leader.
[01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:09.470]  There's a reason this isn't done.
[01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:11.470]  It's really bad.
[01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:18.470]  And the fact that they can contain it, Republicans are now going to start indicting Democrat presidents.
[01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:27.470]  And the time to indict them is when they're not in office like Hillary Clinton was never president.
[01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:33.470]  And I don't want to say it's a necessary evil to have presidents, you know, quote, be above the law.
[01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:35.470]  They're not above the law.
[01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:38.470]  And they can be impeached in Congress and removed.
[01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:47.470]  But when you can have federal prosecutors go out and do this, all the separation of powers is gone.
[01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:51.470]  But let's talk about some positive things that are happening, because this is all really negative.
[01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:53.470]  The good news is the people broken with the system.
[01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:54.470]  Look at this.
[01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:56.470]  Jaw-dropping stats.
[01:22:56.470 --> 01:23:03.470]  Reports of Bud Light Memorial Day sales dropping 60 percent as brand boycott continues.
[01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:06.470]  First it was 10 percent drop.
[01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:07.470]  Then it was 20, then 40, now 60.
[01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:15.470]  As the word spreads that that's liquid cultural poison, it will end up not being able to be given away.
[01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:18.470]  And it's not just Bud Light.
[01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:20.470]  Anheuser-Busch is down 30 plus percent.
[01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:23.470]  Number one beer company in the world now collapsing.
[01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:28.470]  We'll probably end up going bankrupt within 12 months is my estimation.
[01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:36.470]  Because people don't like a weird skinny dude, an Andy Kaufman, making fun of them and messing with kids.
[01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:37.470]  We're tired of it.
[01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:40.470]  It doesn't matter how many corporations gang up.
[01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:44.470]  It doesn't matter how many of you pull all this stuff.
[01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:46.470]  We are rejecting you.
[01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:52.470]  So they're trying to collapse us, but they're collapsing themselves in the process.
[01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:53.470]  But here's a bigger one.
[01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:56.470]  People say, oh, get woke, go broke.
[01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:57.470]  That's not really true.
[01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:59.470]  They always tell you that's not successful.
[01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:01.470]  Because, oh, Hollywood's lost trillions, but they're still there.
[01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:02.470]  No, they're bankrupt.
[01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:03.470]  They're just propped up.
[01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:04.470]  They're a zombie.
[01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:06.470]  Here's another example on The Telegraph.
[01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:14.470]  Worst month ever for ESG funds as British investors pull 300 million pounds in one month.
[01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:20.470]  Hundreds of billions have been pulled in the U.S., trillions worldwide as people go, wait a minute.
[01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:24.470]  If I'm invested in BlackRock or Vanguard or these key areas of their funds,
[01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:28.470]  I'm supporting cutting off coal power plants and ending oil drilling,
[01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:32.470]  and I'm supporting cutting off pipelines, and I'm supporting open borders,
[01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:35.470]  and I'm supporting what BlackRock CEO Fink said,
[01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:39.470]  where we use control of money to force people to behave the way we want.
[01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:42.470]  We're governing them with money and with the ESG.
[01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:46.470]  So people up front, and attorney generals in the U.S. and others,
[01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:50.470]  are pulling state pension funds out of the ESGs.
[01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:57.470]  And so BlackRock had to say a few months ago they were going to stop supporting the carbon taxes for now,
[01:24:57.470 --> 01:25:03.470]  but they got caught using their thousands of billion-dollar subsidiaries
[01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:05.470]  and sub-companies they control to do it,
[01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:13.470]  and kamikaze-ing their companies they control like Target, like Anheuser-Busch, like North Face.
[01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:17.470]  They're being given orders to kamikaze by Fink.
[01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:19.470]  So Fink goes, oh, I'm going to stop this.
[01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:25.470]  Then he kamikazes, promising them, does it matter if you lose 50 billion, 20 billion, 10 billion?
[01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:28.470]  We will rebuild you with fiat money later.
[01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:30.470]  Now I'm giving you an order, attack.
[01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:32.470]  And they attack.
[01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:36.470]  But again, once you understand BlackRock, Vanguard, owned by the same people,
[01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:39.470]  gets all the government funding and the pension funds and your investment,
[01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:43.470]  you're investing in your own destruction.
[01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:47.470]  You can go watch your stock market go up all day, but you're literally destroying your life.
[01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:50.470]  You can individually go invest in the stocks you want.
[01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:52.470]  Don't be with Vanguard.
[01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:54.470]  Don't be with BlackRock.
[01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:55.470]  Takes more time.
[01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:56.470]  Takes more fees.
[01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:57.470]  Takes more energy.
[01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:59.470]  But would you like to control your own life?
[01:25:59.470 --> 01:26:03.470]  Instead of a boycott, which you're great, how about a boycott?
[01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:04.470]  Support Infowars.
[01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:05.470]  Support our broadcast.
[01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:06.470]  Look at Tucker Carlson.
[01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:10.470]  They ban him, 5 million views to 100 million views.
[01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:11.470]  It's the same thing.
[01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:13.470]  Rally behind who they're attacking.
[01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:17.470]  Rally behind the companies they don't like.
[01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:19.470]  Yeah, are some electric vehicles cool?
[01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:20.470]  Absolutely.
[01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:23.470]  Did Elon Musk make amazing cars?
[01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:24.470]  He's driven in a lot of Teslas.
[01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:25.470]  They're cool.
[01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:28.470]  And if they had unlimited energy and if they weren't cutting off the electricity
[01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:31.470]  and if we had plenty of stuff to make the batteries, which we don't,
[01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:34.470]  and they weren't so toxic, I would have electric cars, folks.
[01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:38.470]  But they're trying to make us have them to not have a future
[01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:44.470]  and undermine the petrochemical system we have that we have plenty of for 100 years or more.
[01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:49.470]  So, yeah, I'm all for zero-point energy cars or hydrogen cars or electric cars,
[01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:55.470]  but don't give me things that destroy the earth, don't save the planet,
[01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:58.470]  are a fraud as a bridge to nowhere.
[01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:59.470]  You got a Tesla?
[01:26:59.470 --> 01:27:00.470]  I'm not judging you.
[01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:02.470]  You got one of these other cool EVs?
[01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:06.470]  Great, but don't lie to yourself that it goes half as far
[01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:12.470]  and it can't pull as big a load and it's super toxic.
[01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:17.470]  And then it releases incredible RF.
[01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:20.470]  I mean, do you know what those high-powered batteries do
[01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:23.470]  when you're sitting on top of them and they're broadcasting?
[01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:27.470]  Do you think living with a high-wire, high-tension wire,
[01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:33.470]  high-powered power cable between your legs is good for you?
[01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:36.470]  The cops learned real quick that sitting there on their motorcycles or in their car
[01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:40.470]  with the radar detector between their legs wasn't good.
[01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:45.470]  If you think the radio frequency out of a radar detector is bad, folks,
[01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:50.470]  and now that's coming out, why don't AM radios work in electric cars?
[01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:55.470]  Because they're putting off so much RF, it blocks the signal.
[01:27:55.470 --> 01:28:00.470]  Electric cars, particularly the new high-powered ones,
[01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:05.470]  are sitting on top of a particle beam accelerator.
[01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:09.470]  The cables out of those batteries into that engine
[01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:13.470]  are spitting incredible amounts of electricity into there.
[01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:16.470]  Electricity is a particle beam.
[01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:21.470]  And yeah, if they put 500 pounds of lead shielding on it,
[01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:24.470]  your testicles aren't going to roast.
[01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:29.470]  But when you sit there on top of those, you're roasting your testicles.
[01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:32.470]  Just another little news flash for you.
[01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:36.470]  What do you think electricity is?
[01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:39.470]  It's not a laser beam. It's not fiber-optic-like. It's totally clean.
[01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:41.470]  That's great for communication.
[01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:44.470]  No, it's a particle beam.
[01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:48.470]  It's accelerated electrons and neutrons.
[01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:51.470]  And it'll cook your testicles right off and your other organs.
[01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:54.470]  But your testicles are sitting right down next to the cables.
[01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:56.470]  Bye-bye, testicles.
[01:28:58.470 --> 01:29:01.470]  Sold out for more than a year,

[01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:54.470]  So take action now.

[01:29:58.470 --> 01:30:00.470]  You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce?
[01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:03.470]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:05.470]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:07.470]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz,
[01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:09.470]  four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:11.470]  and now two books with Alex Jones?
[01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:15.470]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:19.470]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:23.470]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:28.470]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:32.470]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:36.470]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:40.470]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day,
[01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:42.470]  and it helps me with my writing.
[01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:43.470]  All right, we love you. We'll be right back.
[01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:48.470]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:50.470]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[01:30:58.470 --> 01:31:00.470]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book,
[01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:02.470]  The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:05.470]  is a historic book that documents the globals in their own words,
[01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:08.470]  plan for our future that is a hellish future.
[01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:11.470]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:14.470]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:17.470]  at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:20.470]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:23.470]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:31:23.470 --> 01:31:25.470]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:28.470]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:30.470]  a signed copy, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:34.470]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:37.470]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:40.470]  you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:43.470]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book,
[01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:44.470]  or unsigned copies.
[01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:47.470]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet
[01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:50.470]  to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get a signed copy
[01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:53.470]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:55.470]  or give them to the local school.
[01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:58.470]  This is an InfoWar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[01:31:58.470 --> 01:32:01.470]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars
[01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:03.470]  financially and with word of mouth and prayer.
[01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:06.470]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists
[01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:10.470]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover
[01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:11.470]  is because of you.
[01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:14.470]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:17.470]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsTore.com
[01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:20.470]  like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration,
[01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:21.470]  so much more.
[01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:24.470]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation
[01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:27.470]  so we get almost 100% of the money to fund our operation
[01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:28.470]  during this critical time,
[01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:32.470]  go to InfoWarsTore.com and right at the top
[01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:35.470]  you'll see a link to make a straight donation,
[01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:38.470]  a one-time donation of $5, $10, $50,
[01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:41.470]  or a recurring donation you can cancel any time.
[01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:42.470]  I want to thank all of you that have donated.
[01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:44.470]  I want to encourage those of you out there
[01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:46.470]  that want to support freedom to take action now
[01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:48.470]  and be part of the global awakening,
[01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:51.470]  the new renaissance that's countering the Great Reset
[01:32:51.470 --> 01:32:53.470]  by going to InfoWarsTore.com
[01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:55.470]  and clicking on the Donate button and giving today.
[01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:57.470]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:58.470]  Please take action.
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:36.240]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:42.679]  For decades, starting in the 70s right through into the 2000s, we were told we'd reach peak
[01:33:42.679 --> 01:33:46.200]  oil and that there would be a new dark age.
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:50.400]  We had to get rid of oil and fossil fuels because we would all run out of it, despite
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:55.300]  the fact you can make fuel, diesel out of coal, we have enough coal around the planet
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:34:01.040]  for 10,000 years, that's discoverable coal, they have clean ways to use it, and now of
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:05.880]  course a few years ago they found the biggest oil discovery in the world, not in the North
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:09.760]  Sea, not in Alaska, but in West Texas.
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:14.559]  In West Texas, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be getting to some of that in a moment.
[01:34:14.559 --> 01:34:18.679]  But now they just tell you, sorry, we're going to ban oil and natural gas because it's bad
[01:34:18.679 --> 01:34:20.240]  for the earth.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:25.000]  Worst month ever for ESG funds as British investors pull massive amounts of money.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.760]  But that's okay, because Biden doesn't care.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:36.400]  More than 66% of U.S. at risk for power outages due to Biden's green transition warn regulators.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.200]  And back when Texas two years ago during that freeze had the power go off because the feds
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:45.240]  ordered the state not to increase power output.
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:51.080]  Germany faces electricity shortages and can expect to see industries leave the country,
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:56.559]  reports the government as their last nuclear plants and coal plants close.
[01:34:56.559 --> 01:35:02.120]  And of course NATO, along with the U.S., blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:08.880]  Starting to get the picture of what's going on here, and we've got all the crime causing
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:11.559]  big box stores in blue cities nationwide to close.
[01:35:11.559 --> 01:35:16.240]  Now the owner of San Francisco's largest hotel, the Hilton Union Square, is walking
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:21.920]  away, surrendering it to its lender, saying the city has collapsed.
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:29.160]  This is all done by precision design to destroy the country.
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:34.080]  Fort Worth area oil company makes a major discovery in West Texas, biggest discovery
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:37.080]  in U.S. history.
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:48.639]  417 billion cubic feet, or 74.2 million barrels in just one field.
[01:35:48.639 --> 01:35:54.240]  And again, my grandfather and my grandmother both were in the oil business after World
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:36:01.679]  War II, and they both bought modest amounts of land in West Texas and in New Mexico.
[01:36:01.679 --> 01:36:06.200]  And over the years, my grandmother gave most of it to the Baptist church and to charities.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:11.840]  She was a very frugal woman, but she kept a little bit of it and gave it to my mom
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:12.840]  like 20 years ago.
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:17.320]  And my mom would get like $500 a month or something off this old played out oil field
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.160]  in West Texas, like a hundred acres or something.
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:21.120]  I've never been out there.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.880]  Suddenly the oil's flooding back into it.
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:23.880]  My mother's getting big checks.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:29.960]  Of course, she's giving that to charity, which is fine, but it gets a little ridiculous at
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:30.960]  a certain point.
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:31.960]  Charity starts at home.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:39.400]  But the issue I'm getting here is these oil fields fill back up, like the planet's living,
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:42.200]  or like somebody put it here all for us.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:48.639]  So all of that BS about peak oil is just that, baloney.
[01:36:48.639 --> 01:36:51.880]  And again, the earth used to have higher carbon dioxide.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.880]  Plants used to grow bigger and healthier.
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:54.880]  Humans used to be healthier.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:55.880]  They've dug up the bones.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:01.480]  In the last 10,000 years, the level of carbon dioxide's gone way down, and it's a great thing.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.599]  We found all this and have been burning it.
[01:37:03.599 --> 01:37:04.599]  It's life-giving.
[01:37:04.599 --> 01:37:07.400]  All the real studies show that.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:12.160]  And then this pro-death cult that's hijacked the world tells you it's bad and lists carbon
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:18.160]  dioxide as a poison gas, because the public is scientifically ignorant.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:21.440]  It's not carbon monoxide that'll kill you dead in a hammer.
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.200]  It's carbon dioxide.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:28.320]  But that's like if you go out, and we've done this ourselves, so have Penn and Teller.
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.719]  You can go out to university, any libtard area.
[01:37:30.719 --> 01:37:35.559]  One time Liam McAdoo did it, the guy was like, yeah, I got a degree in chemistry from Cornell.
[01:37:35.559 --> 01:37:36.559]  I agree.
[01:37:36.719 --> 01:37:40.440]  He banned dihydrogen monoxide.
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:44.599]  She's like, dihydrogen monoxide is really, it's everywhere.
[01:37:44.599 --> 01:37:45.920]  It's used in industrial stuff.
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.320]  It can make you increase your urination.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:52.719]  Of course, it's water.
[01:37:52.719 --> 01:37:55.280]  But it sounds scary, dihydrogen monoxide.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.120]  Have you heard the technical name for salt?
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:01.320]  Oh, most people say ban it immediately.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:07.480]  So I think if they said ban oxygen, because it's carbon, the media would agree with it.
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:08.480]  The public would agree.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.480]  They'd say, let's do it.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:15.120]  Because, I mean, the Netherlands banning, right now, half their farms, 90% by 2030.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:16.120]  Creates one third.
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.120]  No, not one third.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:21.080]  It's the world's third largest food exporter.
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:27.440]  You heard John Kerry a week and a half ago, we must shut down farms to stop starvation.
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:33.400]  We must shut down food production, or people will starve.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:37.160]  We must slit our throats, or we might bleed.
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:41.840]  We must pour gasoline on ourselves and light it, or we might burn up.
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:44.639]  We must play in traffic, or we might get hurt.
[01:38:44.639 --> 01:38:49.200]  We must jump off a 50-story building, or we might fall to our deaths.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:55.840]  We must shoot ourselves in the head, or we might, speaking of that, let me go ahead and
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:58.639]  get to this little tidbit.
[01:38:58.639 --> 01:39:01.840]  There's other ways to commit suicide we'll get to as well, like bringing in a bunch of
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:06.880]  radical Islamics, putting them on welfare, and watching them go crazy.
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:11.880]  Why Elliot Page is speaking out about being trans in this climate of such intense hostility?
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.120]  What, you want to sterilize our kids, and cut their body parts off, and have Hellraiser
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:17.920]  movies about it, and we don't like it, so we're like, this is crazy?
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:24.440]  It turns out, the once beautiful young woman, and quote, movie and TV star, here she is,
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:34.440]  here she is now, a skinny dude, had her breast tissue removed, and now it turns out, she
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:39.840]  actually put this on her Instagram, Elliot Page has revealed to the Los Angeles Times
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:45.840]  that she realized she was transgender when she started hearing and talking to a voice
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:49.679]  in her head following a psychotic episode of self-harm.
[01:39:49.679 --> 01:39:59.480]  Days later, a doctor gave approval for her breast to be removed, yes, one night, he tried
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:03.639]  to knock himself out, took his knuckles to his face, and pounded over and over until
[01:40:03.639 --> 01:40:09.280]  bruises formed, he did, she, for days after, the mentally ill woman sat in a lawn chair
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:17.400]  on the porch, ashamed of his face, sore, and then he heard a voice, you don't have to feel
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:26.480]  this way, cut your breast off, yes, I'm sorry, cut your, cut your breast off, oh, the doctor,
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:31.280]  oh, you hear voices say cut body parts off, yes, let's cut those off right now, I heard
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:36.160]  a voice that told me to cut my son's five-year-old penis off, oh, let's do that right away, and
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:42.200]  it said make a big bleeding wound that never heals, and tortures him, I mean her, yes, yes,
[01:40:42.679 --> 01:40:48.840]  let's start the surgery right away, it was a small voice, barely discernible, but it kept echoing
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:54.920]  in his head, a way out, it was as if something in my brain turned around, recalls page now 36,
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:41:00.120]  the agonizing voice saying no, no, you're not, you can't be switched off, and becomes very
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:08.679]  gentle and loving, or maybe I'm trans, why don't I explore that, yes, within weeks,
[01:41:08.679 --> 01:41:14.280]  he, a woman, scheduled a Zoom consultation with a doctor to discuss top surgery, the procedure
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:19.719]  was scheduled for November, a month later, he, a woman that cut her breast off, announced to fans
[01:41:19.719 --> 01:41:26.760]  on Instagram, who have known him since the release of Juno, 13 years prior, that his name was Elliot,
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:34.440]  you hear a voice, cut your penis off, yes, yes, boys, jump off the cliff, yes, yes,
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:42.760]  cut, cut your genitals off, take the butcher knife, cut the genitals off, do it now, yes,
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:47.719]  yes, master, kill the children, go into the school, kill them, yes, yes,
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:52.840]  take the butcher knife, go to the playground, and stab the children, yes, yes, I will,
[01:41:55.719 --> 01:42:01.080]  I mean, cuckoo, cuckoo, no, no, seek medical assistance, doctor, what do I do?
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:06.200]  Well, obviously, we'll sign you right up, you got insurance, we'll get rid of that penis or
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:11.160]  that uterus and those breasts right away, and then when you get depressed and kill yourself later,
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:17.880]  it's because they didn't embrace you and attacked you, these horrible, crazy people that don't want
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:23.480]  you cutting parts of your body off, they're the bad ones, yes, they're coming to take me away,
[01:42:23.799 --> 01:42:29.480]  oh, and we're the crazy ones because we don't want to do that,
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:37.080]  end of civilization level stuff, look at Big Mike when we come back,
[01:42:37.719 --> 01:42:43.559]  there's some big developments in the Big Mike saga, oh, and like I told you,
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:48.280]  it's hard for the Russians to invade a country with high-tech weapons the US gave them,
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.200]  but it was hard to then invade the Russian held areas, it takes three to one superiority to do
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:55.480]  that and the Ukrainians got slaughtered, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:26.200]  Most people have iodine deficiencies, go to infowarstore.com,

[01:44:03.719 --> 01:44:07.719]  I want to say brain force is great, I want to say turbo force is amazing, it is,
[01:44:07.719 --> 01:44:13.960]  but if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it, the fish oil is better than it,
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:19.880]  and that's an example of what I'm talking about, fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart,
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:24.360]  the cleanest, the best out there, krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:29.000]  I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free, the krill is hallucinogenic,
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.280]  it's so good in my view, I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something,
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:36.920]  and I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night,
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:43.320]  so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is,
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:49.160]  so we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess,
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:53.000]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.
[01:44:58.519 --> 01:45:04.120]  There is a war for the future happening right now, there is a war that will control my destiny,
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:08.519]  your destiny, our children's destinies, and that war is something that we can win,
[01:45:08.519 --> 01:45:13.799]  but it takes dedication, it takes commitment, that's why I ask listeners respectfully to go

[01:47:07.050 --> 01:47:33.850]  All right, so Jack Smith, the U.N. prosecutor at the U.N. Puppet International Criminal
[01:47:33.850 --> 01:47:38.530]  Court where there's no jury, it's just a star chamber.
[01:47:38.530 --> 01:47:47.590]  He was a big Democrat Party donor, but his wife followed Michelle for years and did a
[01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:52.690]  made-for-TV reality show with her for Netflix with a big mic.
[01:47:52.690 --> 01:48:00.810]  So these people are heavily embedded with the real puppet president of the third administration
[01:48:00.810 --> 01:48:06.370]  of Barack Obama that is ongoing, but has now decided to just disqualify the actual people
[01:48:06.370 --> 01:48:10.610]  and not let us have who we want for president, though they're never involved in election
[01:48:10.610 --> 01:48:13.850]  meddling even when they do it in plain view.
[01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:19.730]  So here's Joan Rivers a few weeks before she died talking about what everybody knows is
[01:48:19.730 --> 01:48:20.730]  the truth.
[01:48:20.730 --> 01:48:22.610]  And I'm not joking when I say it.
[01:48:22.610 --> 01:48:26.570]  We even know the name of him where he went to football when he did.
[01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:32.530]  But I don't dislike Big Mike because he wanted to be a woman and Obama wanted to be able
[01:48:32.530 --> 01:48:38.370]  to marry his boyfriend, or the fact that the daughters really aren't their daughters.
[01:48:38.370 --> 01:48:40.810]  That's well known.
[01:48:40.810 --> 01:48:43.290]  This is how they blackmail and control Obama.
[01:48:43.290 --> 01:48:45.410]  It's all part of the big joke in all our faces.
[01:48:45.410 --> 01:48:50.930]  Look, if Big Mike wants to dress up like a woman, that's fine.
[01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:58.330]  It's just that we're going to talk about the fact that Jack Smith, the prosecutor,
[01:48:58.330 --> 01:49:01.010]  the U.N. prosecutor's wife, works for him.
[01:49:01.010 --> 01:49:03.010]  That's a major conflict of interest.
[01:49:03.010 --> 01:49:05.090]  So here's Joan Rivers talking about Big Mike.
[01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:08.130]  Ms. Rivers, how are you?
[01:49:08.130 --> 01:49:11.930]  You made a ton of news officiating the wedding in New York yesterday.
[01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:14.290]  Is this like a new cottage career move for you?
[01:49:14.290 --> 01:49:15.290]  I am so excited.
[01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:18.090]  And I should do very well because I don't joke.
[01:49:18.090 --> 01:49:20.530]  And do you think that the country will see the first, the United States will see the
[01:49:20.530 --> 01:49:22.250]  first gay president or the first woman president?
[01:49:22.250 --> 01:49:23.250]  We already have it with Obama.
[01:49:23.250 --> 01:49:24.250]  So let's just calm down.
[01:49:24.250 --> 01:49:25.250]  Got it.
[01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:26.250]  You know Michelle is a trans...
[01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:27.250]  I'm sorry, she's a what?
[01:49:27.250 --> 01:49:28.250]  A transgender.
[01:49:28.250 --> 01:49:29.250]  We all know.
[01:49:29.250 --> 01:49:30.250]  Oh my gosh.
[01:49:30.250 --> 01:49:31.250]  Oh gosh.
[01:49:31.250 --> 01:49:32.250]  It's okay.
[01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:33.250]  She does the...
[01:49:33.250 --> 01:49:51.410]  And there's photos of Obama in college and after college with his boyfriend, I mean in
[01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:56.410]  his own publications before he got the hair extensions and all the rest of it.
[01:49:56.410 --> 01:49:59.690]  So we'll put some of that up on screen for you.
[01:49:59.690 --> 01:50:05.370]  But that's how this all works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:05.370 --> 01:50:07.210]  And they all think we're idiots.
[01:50:07.210 --> 01:50:09.530]  They all think we're morons.
[01:50:09.530 --> 01:50:11.530]  They all think we're fools.
[01:50:11.530 --> 01:50:22.970]  And it's a cult, absolute, total, and complete cult that's coming after our children.
[01:50:22.970 --> 01:50:25.410]  And the world is rejecting it.
[01:50:25.410 --> 01:50:32.890]  I don't hate adults that want to try to be other sex.
[01:50:32.890 --> 01:50:39.450]  I just don't have to pay for it and don't promote it to kids.
[01:50:39.450 --> 01:50:41.890]  Don't promote any of it to kids.
[01:50:41.890 --> 01:50:44.250]  Yeah, show some pictures of Big Mike.
[01:50:44.250 --> 01:50:45.250]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:50:45.250 --> 01:50:47.410]  Those are real photos.
[01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:50.450]  That's Big Mike like 25 years ago starting to transition.
[01:50:51.250 --> 01:50:56.250]  Hey, go ahead and play the clip, guys.
[01:50:56.250 --> 01:50:59.930]  This is Obama calls, he's done this twice.
[01:50:59.930 --> 01:51:02.250]  On the stage, Michelle Obama, Michael.
[01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:03.250]  Here it is.
[01:51:03.250 --> 01:51:13.650]  Most of all, Admiral Mullen, Deborah, Michael and I also want to acknowledge your son Jack
[01:51:13.650 --> 01:51:16.730]  who's deployed today.
[01:51:16.730 --> 01:51:23.770]  All of you have performed extraordinary service to our country.
[01:51:23.770 --> 01:51:28.690]  He does it other times too, calls her Michael.
[01:51:28.690 --> 01:51:31.770]  So it's all just part of a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:31.770 --> 01:51:36.650]  I mean, look, I mean, if you haven't been around Michelle Obama, I've just seen photos
[01:51:36.650 --> 01:51:38.730]  of close videos like next to big dudes.
[01:51:38.730 --> 01:51:43.770]  I mean, we're talking linebacker material NFL here.
[01:51:43.770 --> 01:51:47.930]  So that's just the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:48.930]  That's the reality.
[01:51:48.930 --> 01:51:49.930]  But don't worry.
[01:51:49.930 --> 01:51:50.930]  Jack Smith works for him.
[01:51:50.930 --> 01:51:53.050]  So everything is a okay.
[01:51:53.050 --> 01:51:55.530]  Here's the photo I wanted to show the overhead shot, please.
[01:51:55.530 --> 01:51:56.850]  Michelle Obama is a man.
[01:51:56.850 --> 01:51:57.850]  It's the screenshot of that.
[01:51:57.850 --> 01:52:02.330]  And you can see Michelle Obama, Michelle Obama right there.
[01:52:02.330 --> 01:52:08.010]  So it's all part of the big joke, all part of the big game.
[01:52:08.010 --> 01:52:11.730]  All part of flying it in our face.
[01:52:11.730 --> 01:52:16.130]  And hell, the same group tells us two men can have a baby and that, you know, two women
[01:52:16.130 --> 01:52:22.130]  can have a baby in prison when it's a biological man raping them.
[01:52:22.130 --> 01:52:27.090]  You know, I haven't gotten to this footage and I really don't want to air it.
[01:52:27.090 --> 01:52:33.610]  But because because the EU is threatening and keeping it from airing, I'm going to air
[01:52:33.610 --> 01:52:34.610]  it.
[01:52:34.610 --> 01:52:36.850]  What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do it the first five minutes, the next hour.
[01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:43.090]  I'm going to show multiple young babies and citizens of France, eight people stabbed,
[01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:48.730]  some in critical condition, stabbed in the face, the abdomen by an Islamic nutball running
[01:52:48.730 --> 01:52:55.270]  around at a city park in France.
[01:52:55.270 --> 01:53:03.690]  And we're going to tie that together with all of the major gun control initiatives that
[01:53:03.690 --> 01:53:09.810]  are now unfolding and being announced and being pushed around the world.
[01:53:09.810 --> 01:53:14.890]  So I'm going to do that before our special guest on all this UFO activity and what just
[01:53:14.890 --> 01:53:24.930]  happened in Las Vegas, where multiple police body cams pick up a big spinning green thing
[01:53:24.930 --> 01:53:26.170]  that falls out of the sky.
[01:53:26.170 --> 01:53:33.010]  There's a huge crashing noise and then the police go to where it fell and people are
[01:53:33.330 --> 01:53:39.290]  freaking out, saying that there are 10 foot, eight to 10 foot green aliens running around
[01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:43.530]  their backyard.
[01:53:43.530 --> 01:53:47.850]  And the police took it as very credible because they heard the crash.
[01:53:47.850 --> 01:53:52.890]  It got picked up on ring cameras, everything, the big crash.
[01:53:52.890 --> 01:54:00.330]  And I don't know what's going on, but it's totally insane.
[01:54:00.330 --> 01:54:02.370]  But we know there's a larger side dealing with all of this.
[01:54:02.370 --> 01:54:07.410]  And so, as I said, I think on Monday or was it Tuesday on Crowder, expect more and more
[01:54:07.410 --> 01:54:12.370]  of this weirdness to start happening, because whatever you want to call it, demonic activity,
[01:54:12.370 --> 01:54:15.490]  blue being government manipulations, it is intensifying.
[01:54:15.490 --> 01:54:21.930]  Continuing with all the censorship, woke Marvel eliminates the Punisher due to problematic
[01:54:21.930 --> 01:54:23.930]  conservative fan base.
[01:54:23.930 --> 01:54:29.530]  So because a lot of military people like the Punisher and adopted it, Marvel is removing
[01:54:29.530 --> 01:54:32.250]  and getting rid of the character for good.
[01:54:32.250 --> 01:54:33.890]  It just shows total control.
[01:54:33.890 --> 01:54:40.050]  Idaho team banned from walking at graduation, loses job for saying there are only two genders.
[01:54:40.050 --> 01:54:43.650]  Boy, we're really in a free country, aren't we?
[01:54:43.650 --> 01:54:52.090]  Oh, but now Anheuser-Busch has got 60 percent down in sales with Bud Light.
[01:54:52.090 --> 01:54:55.290]  So you push your war, we'll push ours.
[01:54:55.290 --> 01:54:58.890]  We know you're trying to force us to do something.
[01:54:58.890 --> 01:55:03.050]  You know, the left can be trying to force me to drink pure, clean water, but if they
[01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:05.690]  were pushing my head down to make me do it, I'd say, hey, I'm not going to do this because
[01:55:05.690 --> 01:55:06.850]  you tell me to.
[01:55:06.850 --> 01:55:07.970]  You're not in charge of me.
[01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:09.290]  You're not my God.
[01:55:09.290 --> 01:55:13.050]  But they're not pushing us to eat our Wheaties and drink water.
[01:55:13.050 --> 01:55:17.610]  They are pushing us to let them have relationships and sexualize children because they can screw
[01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:19.330]  them up for life and get control of them.
[01:55:19.330 --> 01:55:20.330]  That's all they're doing.
[01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:21.330]  They admit it.
[01:55:21.330 --> 01:55:24.290]  The corporate documents have been covered for 20 some years that they want relationships
[01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:30.730]  with kids to sexualize them and then connect that sexual identity to a political party,
[01:55:30.730 --> 01:55:33.170]  to corporatism, to socialism, to leftist garbage.
[01:55:33.170 --> 01:55:34.610]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:55:34.610 --> 01:55:35.610]  It's a cult.
[01:55:35.610 --> 01:55:36.610]  It's a gang.
[01:55:36.610 --> 01:55:40.530]  It's you keep your kid away from MS-13 or the KKK.
[01:55:40.530 --> 01:55:46.170]  Well, the KKK and MS-13 are not trying to cut your son's penis off or your daughter's
[01:55:46.170 --> 01:55:50.370]  breast off and trying to have sex with them when they're eight years old.
[01:55:50.370 --> 01:55:55.290]  So as much as I don't like the KKK or MS-13 or the new Black Panther Party, they are the
[01:55:55.290 --> 01:56:00.650]  least of our problems compared to the corporate agenda selling all this.
[01:56:00.650 --> 01:56:04.810]  So much more jam-packed, massive third hour today.
[01:56:04.810 --> 01:56:06.730]  Special guests I'll tell you about when they join us in a moment.
[01:56:06.730 --> 01:56:07.730]  Viewer discretion advised.
[01:56:07.730 --> 01:56:12.690]  I'm going to get to this Islamic rat running around doing this and how the media is trying
[01:56:12.690 --> 01:56:14.330]  to cover it up.
[01:56:14.330 --> 01:56:17.170]  Man, I wish somebody had a gun.
[01:56:17.170 --> 01:56:23.290]  But I guess if you shot him here in Austin, the Soros D.A. would indict you, but at least
[01:56:23.290 --> 01:56:25.530]  the kids wouldn't be dead and dying.
[01:56:25.530 --> 01:56:28.170]  By the way, I'm serious.
[01:56:28.170 --> 01:56:32.810]  He just let a guy out that was caught raping six women, the Soros D.A.
[01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:35.450]  He raped a sixth woman and broke her leg.
[01:56:35.450 --> 01:56:40.450]  They released him four times, and he was just given probation after he admits he raped her
[01:56:40.450 --> 01:56:45.210]  and broke her leg and tore her clothes off on the hiking bike trail, and the D.A. said,
[01:56:45.210 --> 01:56:47.690]  man, you're on probation.
[01:56:47.690 --> 01:56:49.770]  I'm not saying go rape the D.A.
[01:56:49.770 --> 01:56:50.770]  In fact, don't.
[01:56:50.770 --> 01:56:58.250]  But if somebody randomly tied him down in the Travis County or Austin, you know, high
[01:56:58.250 --> 01:57:01.610]  rise or parking garage, somebody waited until he got out.
[01:57:01.610 --> 01:57:02.610]  I'm not saying do this.
[01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:03.810]  It's hypothetical.
[01:57:03.810 --> 01:57:08.570]  And hog tied him and then raped him and then just broke his leg for good measure.
[01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:11.210]  You'd spend a life in prison, guaranteed.
[01:57:11.210 --> 01:57:17.810]  But if you rape five, six women, sweetheart, you're free as a bird because I'm George Soros's
[01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:21.050]  minion and I'm here to bring it all.
[01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:22.050]  Yeah.
[01:57:22.050 --> 01:57:23.050]  Yeah.
[01:57:23.050 --> 01:57:24.050]  Oh, liberal, baby.
[01:57:24.050 --> 01:57:28.490]  By the way, they haven't taken the sell down yet, but it's going down today.
[01:57:28.490 --> 01:57:34.210]  I'm told X3 selling out 25 percent off and super female vitality is back in stock.
[01:57:34.210 --> 01:57:39.050]  Supermill is selling out, but it's 40 percent off one bottle, 50 percent off the second
[01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:40.050]  bottle.
[01:57:40.050 --> 01:57:41.050]  And it's the same form of supermodel vitality.
[01:57:41.050 --> 01:57:42.050]  So what?
[01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:43.730]  I've been 50 percent off in a long time.

[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:19.540]  It boosts women.
[01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:20.540]  It works great.
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:22.540]  But women like pink labels.
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:24.540]  Men like different color labels.
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:26.540]  So it works for men as well.
[01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:27.540]  It's the same formula.

[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:14.540]  Taking it out of the diet.
[01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:15.540]  You need it.

[01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:54.540]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:56.540]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:59:56.540 --> 02:00:09.540]  More than 30 years ago, the French government followed other EU nations,
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:11.540]  incompensating even the hunting rifles.
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:13.540]  First they banned the semi-auto.
[02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:15.540]  Then they banned personal defense.
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:17.540]  Then they banned everything.
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:19.540]  Here's some headlines today about it.
[02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:23.540]  Weapons amnesty begins for French owners of illegal arms, which is all guns.
[02:00:23.540 --> 02:00:25.540]  That was November of last year.
[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:26.540]  Well, it's the last week this week.
[02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:29.540]  France launches week-long campaign to collect personal firearms.
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:32.540]  Last chance and the amnesty just ended.
[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:37.540]  Well, right on time, one of the five million Islamics brought in to France
[02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:42.540]  in just the last decade, 90% of them are on welfare and never get a job.
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:44.540]  Giant areas are no-go zones.
[02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:51.540]  Well, Mr. Cool here went out and went to a park and stabbed four babies and four women.
[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:53.540]  What a tough guy.
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:55.540]  Four of them are fighting for their lives.
[02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:59.540]  Stabbed them with a butcher knife.
[02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:01.540]  Remember the old Alex Jones song?
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:04.540]  I'm going to stab your daughter at the mall.
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:08.540]  I'm going to stab your wife, your son.
[02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:13.540]  And then the police chief says, we love our Somalis.
[02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:16.540]  We love our Muslims, too.
[02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:17.540]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:19.540]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:20.540]  You know, we got our special guest coming up.
[02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:25.540]  Can we get the version that Rob Dew added documents to to prove everything I was saying?
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:28.540]  The Alex Jones does Bon Iver song.
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:31.540]  It had, like, 20 million views when they took it off YouTube.
[02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:32.540]  Somebody re-uploaded it.
[02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:34.540]  It's got, like, 10 million views the last time I saw it.
[02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:36.540]  It had, like, 300 million views on Spotify when they took that down.
[02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:37.540]  300 million views.
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:40.540]  That's a platinum triple record right there.
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:41.540]  We're very proud of it.
[02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:43.540]  But I shouldn't make jokes about it.
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:46.540]  Here is a bunch of women howling and screaming.
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:50.540]  And no one even told them, hey, you're in a super high crime country.
[02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:56.540]  The Muslims literally feed on you like jackals on field mice or something.
[02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:57.540]  Maybe you should have a butcher knife.
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:01:59.540]  Maybe you should have a club or something.
[02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:00.540]  No.
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:05.540]  You just scream and scream as he plunges the knife lovingly.
[02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:07.540]  And it was a Soros prosecutor.
[02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:11.540]  Like, here, he'll walk because we deserve it.
[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:12.540]  We deserve it.
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:15.540]  We deserve the kiss of Islamic love.
[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:16.540]  The kiss.
[02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:38.540]  I take that knife away from him and shove it right up his throat.
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:47.540]  Ah!
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:53.540]  Nice guy.
[02:02:57.540 --> 02:02:58.540]  Just stabbed that woman.
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:01.540]  Hey, why are we showing the censored version?
[02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:03.540]  Let's show him stab the baby in the head.
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:04.540]  Guys, get the uncensored.
[02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:06.540]  We want everybody to see what we're not supposed to see.
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:09.540]  Now he comes over to the baby carriage.
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:10.540]  He's got a couple stabs in.
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:14.540]  But, hey, he's, they're white, he's brown.
[02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:15.540]  They deserve it.
[02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:20.540]  Imagine, you wake up in the morning,
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:24.540]  I think I'll drop by the local jungle gym and stab some babies and toddlers.
[02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:33.540]  So, this is a very nice person.
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:37.540]  And then a man starts chasing him and he runs off.
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:43.540]  I wonder if a Soros prosecutor, because he's putting them in there too,
[02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:47.540]  will arrest that evil white man that tried to fight him with a book bag
[02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:50.540]  and then actually got the knife out of his hand and stopped him so he ran off.
[02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:52.540]  Man, they ought to arrest that guy with the,
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:56.540]  with the backpack that fought the guy with the knife.
[02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:58.540]  What a freaking white supremacist.
[02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:02.540]  Did you see that KKK grand dragon attack that god?
[02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:05.540]  It was just trying to free France.
[02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:09.540]  But, I mean, the French are committing suicide.
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:10.540]  They love it.
[02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:12.540]  They love it.
[02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:13.540]  They love their Macron.
[02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:15.540]  Actually, they don't love it.
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:18.540]  But they had their guns taken away.
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:19.540]  It's actually very, very sad.
[02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:23.540]  But this is how the West is committing suicide.
[02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:27.540]  And this is where it's going.
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:30.540]  But his instinct is,
[02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:34.540]  these are non-Muslims, they gotta die.
[02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:37.540]  Just like some towns in the UK have thousands of little kids,
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:39.540]  the youngest eight kidnapped by Muslims in sex slavery,
[02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:41.540]  and the police won't do anything.
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:43.540]  In fact, in most cities, they're involved in it.
[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:46.540]  Because the Brits roll over, the French roll over.
[02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:48.540]  If you roll over, the wolves get you.
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:50.540]  Stop acting like sheep.
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:51.540]  Become sheepdogs.
[02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:53.540]  Stop being soft targets.
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:54.540]  Fight back.
[02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:55.540]  We'll be right back.

[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:08.540]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:10.540]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:15.540]  Alex Jones is Bonvier or Bon Iver,
[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:17.540]  potato patata.
[02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:19.540]  Look at our special guest.
[02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:22.540]  This is, what, a seven-year-old music video,
[02:06:22.540 --> 02:06:25.540]  hundreds of millions of views and listens.
[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:27.540]  And it's been, they've tried to censor it,
[02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:29.540]  but it gets re-uploaded constantly.
[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:31.540]  And then we're going to B-roll over,
[02:06:31.540 --> 02:06:34.540]  running around stabbing women and children at a playground,
[02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:36.540]  over it.
[02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:38.540]  Here it is.
[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:02.540]  Apple, white, this people.
[02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:05.540]  Apple, white, this, this is gone.
[02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:09.540]  They literally crawled out from under the tree
[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:10.540]  and they're looking stupid.
[02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:12.540]  And they run around screaming,
[02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:15.540]  We love Satan, we want to eat babies.
[02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:19.540]  I have them on video.
[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:21.540]  I f***ing love Satan, so f*** you.
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:23.540]  I kill my kids.
[02:07:23.540 --> 02:07:27.540]  Hillary's in the creepy weird six-step man.
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:30.540]  We came, we saw, he died.
[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:34.540]  She sleeps in the same room with that creepy weirdo woman
[02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:37.540]  whose mother wears a hood over her head.
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:38.540]  What the hell?
[02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:41.540]  That woman number one is ugly.
[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:45.540]  Imagine how bad she smells, man.
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:49.540]  I'm told her and Obama just stink.
[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:54.540]  Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:57.540]  There's a guy on the radio
[02:07:57.540 --> 02:07:59.540]  who apparently trumps on his show frequently.
[02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:01.540]  He says me and Hillary are demons.
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:03.540]  Said we smell like sulfur.
[02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:05.540]  Ain't that something?
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:08.540]  I had never seen or smelled any woman like that, ever.
[02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:10.540]  People are telling me she smells.
[02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:12.540]  Who could not notice someone who smelled that bad?
[02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:14.540]  We're here to move them body parts,
[02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:16.540]  they're the goblins
[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:19.540]  hobbling around coming after us.
[02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:22.540]  My spirit gets close to that evil
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:28.540]  and I feel it go ah, ah, ah.
[02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:31.540]  We'll stuff ourselves in the crap
[02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:32.540]  we don't even notice
[02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:36.540]  and it's self-rising up against us.
[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:38.540]  Millions of pointed people
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:40.540]  of the very worst type,
[02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:44.540]  and I'm so pissed.
[02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:48.540]  We're gonna stab your daughter at the mall.
[02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:52.540]  Oh, oh, oh.
[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:56.540]  We're gonna stab your wife, your son.
[02:08:56.540 --> 02:08:59.540]  Ooh.
[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:02.540]  We're gonna stab you with a butcher knife
[02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:06.540]  and then the police chief is gonna say
[02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:09.540]  we love our Somalis,
[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:11.540]  we love our Muslims.
[02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:13.540]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:15.540]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:21.990]  I was watching Fox News as I worked out this morning, and they had the police chief on
[02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:24.710]  making excuses from that town in Minnesota.
[02:09:24.710 --> 02:09:28.950]  And they had the Fox News host, this is the Fair and Balanced channel, going, Donald Trump
[02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:30.870]  really stepped in at this time.
[02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:36.110]  He said it was a bombing before it had officially been called a bombing, and Hillary's on him,
[02:09:36.110 --> 02:09:48.510]  and she's got some really good points.
[02:09:48.510 --> 02:09:53.630]  Well he was on with us two, three months ago and predicted that the system would start
[02:09:53.630 --> 02:09:56.990]  staging more fake UFO invasions and attacks.
[02:09:56.990 --> 02:09:59.750]  There's a larger, deeper psyop to this.
[02:09:59.750 --> 02:10:02.950]  And now we'll get to it, coming up in about 30 minutes, I'm going to get to the current
[02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:05.710]  stuff and some of the latest stuff, then get to this.
[02:10:05.710 --> 02:10:10.470]  A big blue UFO crashes in Vegas, people see eight, ten-foot aliens run around their backyard,
[02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:16.230]  and the police see it crash, I mean, this is psyop written all over it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:16.230 --> 02:10:21.150]  And I'm not saying aliens couldn't be real, couldn't be happening, but the ongoing psyop
[02:10:21.150 --> 02:10:26.790]  of an intel officer says that they've seen the bodies of the craft, and he's the first
[02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:30.390]  intel officer to say it, really, it's like 50 of them have said this.
[02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:33.150]  And so what's the bigger implication here?
[02:10:33.150 --> 02:10:36.470]  What's really going on and why are they hyping it up now?
[02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:42.430]  Dark Journalist is what he goes by, is an independent reporter and filmmaker from Cambridge, Mass.,
[02:10:42.430 --> 02:10:47.230]  who coined the term Dark Journalism to introduce crucial ideas and areas of research and investigation
[02:10:47.230 --> 02:10:49.830]  that the mainstream media refuses to touch.
[02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:53.710]  And he has a weekly live video series that reaches hundreds of millions of people total.
[02:10:53.710 --> 02:10:58.950]  His documentary, X Project Aerospace Assassins, tells the story of a shadowy group inside the
[02:10:58.950 --> 02:11:02.710]  National Security State Defense Contractor Aerospace Wing.
[02:11:02.710 --> 02:11:05.070]  Darkjournalist.com on YouTube, Dark Journalist.
[02:11:05.070 --> 02:11:07.550]  Okay, good to have you here.
[02:11:07.550 --> 02:11:10.510]  I want to try to give you the floor the next 10 minutes or so to just lay out big picture
[02:11:10.510 --> 02:11:11.510]  what's happening.
[02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:16.070]  I want to drill into so many areas that are unfolding, and do you think I'm right that
[02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:20.390]  this is part of the rollout of the ongoing psyop, or is something different happening?
[02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:21.390]  Great to have you here with us.
[02:11:21.390 --> 02:11:24.310]  Well, it's great to be here, Alex.
[02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:25.310]  Thank you very much.
[02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:26.310]  Well, I'll start.
[02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:31.710]  I'll tell you, I think that you're right on the right track, and it's interesting.
[02:11:31.710 --> 02:11:36.670]  I keep bringing the UFO threat aspect into campaign 2024.
[02:11:36.670 --> 02:11:41.190]  It has to be right at the forefront of those campaigns, so when you have Trump out there
[02:11:41.190 --> 02:11:47.350]  and you have Bobby Kennedy out there, these guys are deep in their family and their background
[02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:52.550]  with the UFO file, and that puts them on a very level playing field with the people that
[02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:58.190]  are giving them so much trouble, and it's the missing element in so much of this reporting
[02:11:58.190 --> 02:11:59.830]  when it comes to the presidential race.
[02:11:59.830 --> 02:12:01.310]  It has to be brought forward.
[02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:07.350]  This is a good time to do it, because the system itself, this deeper state, I call them
[02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:11.230]  the ex-protect folks who are holding the UFO secret.
[02:12:11.230 --> 02:12:16.910]  This part, they're really playing for all the marbles right now.
[02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:19.790]  So what you're saying is this could bring down the deep state, and it was Kennedy set
[02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:24.670]  up NASA, and of course Trump's got family heavily involved in it, heavily involved in
[02:12:24.670 --> 02:12:30.350]  the Tesla technology, and Trump talks about SpaceX, and he talks about Space Force and
[02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:32.110]  suppressed information.
[02:12:32.110 --> 02:12:37.470]  They're really threatening the establishment with the fact that we've got a breakaway civilization
[02:12:37.470 --> 02:12:42.390]  that if it gets caught is going to pose as aliens, is that what you're saying?
[02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:47.470]  Yeah, that's actually, there's so many good points in there, because crucial to this is
[02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:51.790]  that Trump, when he sits across the table from them, when he got involved in this, if
[02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:57.950]  you go back far enough in his history, you run into his uncle, John Trump, who was directly
[02:12:57.950 --> 02:13:01.470]  connected and was the mentor.
[02:13:01.470 --> 02:13:06.150]  He was mentored by Vannevar Bush, who controlled the UFO file, and Vannevar Bush controlled
[02:13:06.150 --> 02:13:08.110]  the UFO file for three decades.
[02:13:08.110 --> 02:13:14.790]  So John Trump, who Trump brings up over and over again when he gets into these informal
[02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:19.070]  settings and interviews and stuff, he'll just start talking about his uncle for some reason.
[02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:23.390]  And there's a key reason for that, which is he's deep on the UFO file.
[02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:27.030]  He doesn't talk openly and come out with it.
[02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:28.630]  He's always hinting around about it.
[02:13:28.630 --> 02:13:34.630]  When he created the Space Force, that was a clear attempt to pull that X technology,
[02:13:34.630 --> 02:13:40.750]  the hidden technology, back under executive branch control, when it got lost right in
[02:13:40.750 --> 02:13:44.070]  that period of Eisenhower and Kennedy.
[02:13:44.070 --> 02:13:49.590]  And that's a major piece and a major problem that they have with Trump beyond America First
[02:13:49.590 --> 02:13:54.430]  and beyond his other issues, is that when he sits across the table from them, he's got
[02:13:54.430 --> 02:13:56.110]  Roy Cohn in his background.
[02:13:56.190 --> 02:14:03.950]  Well, Roy Cohn was part of Defense Intelligence Security Command, and Cohn has a big, deep
[02:14:03.950 --> 02:14:05.790]  aerospace footprint.
[02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:10.710]  So when we go back and we look at the forces behind Trump putting him in that position,
[02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:16.510]  the UFO file is a big key piece, but it's very rarely talked about.
[02:14:16.510 --> 02:14:17.510]  Incredible information.
[02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:21.950]  Why do you think suddenly the whole corporate system is promoting aliens?
[02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:24.630]  I mean, I've never seen such a push.
[02:14:24.630 --> 02:14:25.630]  What's going on?
[02:14:26.150 --> 02:14:32.750]  They started in earnest five years ago with the TTSA and the New York Times article.
[02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:36.310]  This whole piece, that's the UFO threat on steroids.
[02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:38.550]  They needed that part and they needed it quickly.
[02:14:38.550 --> 02:14:43.310]  You know, I'm fond of saying when I do my show that if you thought the COVID op was
[02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:47.230]  something, just wait till they get to the UFO threat op, because that really gives them
[02:14:47.230 --> 02:14:49.150]  total power.
[02:14:49.150 --> 02:14:54.390]  And they have a number of things in place for continuity of government emergency control
[02:14:54.430 --> 02:14:56.950]  related to the UFO file.
[02:14:56.950 --> 02:15:01.870]  And the problem is that the field that covers UFOs is not very deep.
[02:15:01.870 --> 02:15:05.870]  They don't have any of the deep state knowledge around this, and that's a big problem.
[02:15:05.870 --> 02:15:08.510]  They think the CIA is going to give them disclosure.
[02:15:08.510 --> 02:15:10.350]  That's this latest whistleblower.
[02:15:10.350 --> 02:15:15.150]  He comes straight out of intelligence and NRO, which was an organization that was around
[02:15:15.150 --> 02:15:17.510]  for 30 years before anyone even knew it existed.
[02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:18.790]  That's how secret those guys are.
[02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:21.470]  That's the head start that they have.
[02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:27.390]  And Grush is the whistleblower's name, and he's come out and put things on the record,
[02:15:27.390 --> 02:15:29.910]  but he hasn't presented any evidence for anything.
[02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:34.670]  So when we get to this, we see this is another piece of this longstanding thing, and they
[02:15:34.670 --> 02:15:38.390]  rolled it out with Tom DeLonge and the To The Stars Academy thing.
[02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:42.030]  They thought, hey, you know, we'll put this kind of Bobo Rockstar as the face of it.
[02:15:42.030 --> 02:15:43.430]  That didn't work so well.
[02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:46.110]  So now they're trying a lot of other intel people.
[02:15:46.110 --> 02:15:50.790]  But if you look even one inch deep into these people, they're connected to the same group
[02:15:50.830 --> 02:15:54.070]  that's been pushing this over the last five years, and that's all intel.
[02:15:55.950 --> 02:16:00.910]  Wow. Well, you're really the guy that focuses on this more than anybody, and I know that
[02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:05.110]  Greer basically saying a lot of the similar things to you, that they've got this whole
[02:16:05.110 --> 02:16:09.750]  fake program so they can control populations, but they're also trying to block other real
[02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:14.470]  stuff. What's your overall from your deep research, your cosmology, your dead reckoning on
[02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:15.470]  what's really going on?
[02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:21.030]  Yeah, it's a great question, actually, because there there is a real UFO file and a lot of
[02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:26.430]  the things that they're doing to obscure the UFO file is to give us false versions of it,
[02:16:26.430 --> 02:16:29.430]  and that includes the gray aliens and this whole thing.
[02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:32.230]  There's a real factor involved.
[02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:36.030]  You know, there's someone here from somewhere else, but there's also the incredible
[02:16:36.030 --> 02:16:41.710]  development of human technology, and that gets us into a whole historical piece because
[02:16:42.710 --> 02:16:44.750]  we have those explanations in history.
[02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:48.830]  You know, we've had shows about it for years, ancient aliens and Von Daniken and all that,
[02:16:48.830 --> 02:16:54.190]  but it does tie into some of the older stories around the mystery schools holding this
[02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:58.550]  technology after a very advanced civilization had the technology.
[02:16:58.550 --> 02:17:02.750]  They had flight. You know, you look at things like the Nazca Lines, for example, and you
[02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:06.110]  know that we had flight because you can't see those things without being in the air.
[02:17:07.310 --> 02:17:09.350]  Things like the Great Pyramid, et cetera.
[02:17:09.950 --> 02:17:15.070]  We understand when we look at that, that there was something unexplained, a chapter missing
[02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:18.470]  in history, a kind of an amnesia incident.
[02:17:18.470 --> 02:17:23.150]  And now we're going forward and they're redeveloping the technology.
[02:17:23.150 --> 02:17:26.790]  And those secret societies have access to that history.
[02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:30.550]  And if you detail it and go through it, you can see that this whole wave around
[02:17:30.550 --> 02:17:33.550]  aerospace actually started in the 19th century.
[02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:36.070]  Wow. Continue.
[02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:44.750]  When I'm looking at groups like, you know, the Delshao Aerospace Group and that whole
[02:17:44.750 --> 02:17:48.790]  thing is connected to the Trump family, it's in those paintings and we're lucky to have
[02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:54.150]  those paintings. Delshao was an artist whose paintings were brought out in the end of the
[02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:58.990]  20th century, but he was around in the 19th century, early 20th century, and he was making
[02:17:58.990 --> 02:18:01.550]  these incredible paintings of airships and things.
[02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:08.230]  Well, interestingly enough, right in the middle of this, there was Trump 45 and, you
[02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:10.070]  know, this thing has been displayed in museums.
[02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:11.670]  It's not a hoax and all the rest.
[02:18:12.110 --> 02:18:14.630]  So there's some older connection with that.
[02:18:14.630 --> 02:18:21.790]  And so when you get John Trump coming in to MIT and being greenlit by Vannevar Bush to
[02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:26.070]  get into space research and then you have Trump bringing out the Space Force, which
[02:18:26.070 --> 02:18:30.110]  no one really talks about what's going on with Trump there and the Space Force.
[02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:35.550]  Why did was he the person to create this whole different unit that is directly related?
[02:18:35.790 --> 02:18:40.590]  That's sort of his effort to pull the UFO file under his control when he was president.
[02:18:40.590 --> 02:18:45.430]  And I think a lot of the people and the reason that Biden hasn't done much with the
[02:18:45.430 --> 02:18:47.830]  Space Force is because it's honeycomb with Trump people.
[02:18:48.510 --> 02:18:51.110]  And he was coming from a totally different place on this.
[02:18:51.470 --> 02:18:56.750]  So there's been a background battle going on and this goes into black projects and it's
[02:18:56.750 --> 02:18:57.990]  not in the public side.
[02:18:57.990 --> 02:19:01.990]  The public basically sees on the surface assassinations.
[02:19:03.070 --> 02:19:06.630]  You know, we see all these battles, people trying to put other people in prison, get
[02:19:06.630 --> 02:19:10.350]  them, you know, out of presidential politics and all the rest of it.
[02:19:10.550 --> 02:19:13.550]  It's directly related to this advanced technology question.
[02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:17.630]  And the thing about the advanced technology is it's exotic technology.
[02:19:17.630 --> 02:19:22.350]  So it doesn't ascribe to normal scientific patterns in this way.
[02:19:22.350 --> 02:19:26.910]  We're talking about a technology that, you know, blows the minds of the people who are
[02:19:26.910 --> 02:19:31.550]  working on it. And very often of the people that they get to experiment with, it can't
[02:19:31.550 --> 02:19:36.710]  use it because unless you have a certain type of ability, in many cases, it's psychic
[02:19:36.710 --> 02:19:40.910]  abilities. You can't operate anything about the UFO crash retrieval technology.
[02:19:42.270 --> 02:19:47.750]  And I've talked to some high level people in NASA off record, and it wasn't Raymond
[02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:50.950]  Teague, he was in mission control over the cameras and communications, and he said there
[02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:52.630]  was a lot of secret stuff going on.
[02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:58.030]  But I talked to other people and NASA is really a cover program for psychic ability,
[02:19:58.030 --> 02:19:59.110]  clairvoyance, you name it.
[02:19:59.470 --> 02:20:04.990]  And that's they're really scooping up the best minds and young children really beyond MK
[02:20:04.990 --> 02:20:09.550]  Ultra, not to create assassins like the CIA was doing, but trying to find children that
[02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:14.030]  can immediately psychically recognize all these communication patterns and languages.
[02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:17.190]  And it looks like it is for some type of alien technology.
[02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:18.430]  Is that what your research is finding?
[02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:21.030]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:20:21.310 --> 02:20:25.750]  That's exactly the area we should be looking in with this.
[02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:30.510]  And too often they're trying to push us into the, oh, there's, you know, there's an alien
[02:20:30.510 --> 02:20:35.190]  and it's a threat. And the whole thing about the development of Arrow, which is this
[02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:41.070]  office that Senator Gillibrand and Senator Rubio put together, that's all about having a
[02:20:41.070 --> 02:20:44.230]  UFO defense office or UFO DOE, as I call it.
[02:20:45.310 --> 02:20:50.310]  And they got that attached to the National Defense Authorization Act for the first time
[02:20:50.350 --> 02:20:54.110]  last year. And this is an extraordinary thing because again, that's why they're hyping the
[02:20:54.110 --> 02:20:58.110]  aliens are going to attack us when clearly it looks like drones, advanced vehicles,
[02:20:58.110 --> 02:21:00.310]  harassing our own people, probably our own government doing it.
[02:21:00.910 --> 02:21:06.150]  They're now actually getting money for the first time, not to fight aliens.
[02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:12.830]  Right. And this is this is extraordinary, because when you're looking at this, you know, I
[02:21:12.830 --> 02:21:17.430]  call it the breakaways breaking back in because they've been keeping this breakaway
[02:21:17.430 --> 02:21:20.550]  technology at least since the 1930s.
[02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:24.630]  So, you know, in my research, it goes further back, but I'll just deal with it on that
[02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:30.790]  clip. And that includes literally, you know, assassinating personalities, that is taking
[02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:35.150]  these people down in the public eye and ruining the career of certain astronomers and
[02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:39.390]  other people. One of the guys who was the interface in the middle of this was J.
[02:21:39.390 --> 02:21:42.950]  Allen Hynek, who tried to bring out disclosure in the 1970s.
[02:21:43.470 --> 02:21:47.710]  Well, what's very interesting about him is in private, when someone asked him what was
[02:21:47.710 --> 02:21:53.030]  the answer to the UFO file, he said it was in Rudolf Steiner's book, Theosophy.
[02:21:54.350 --> 02:21:59.590]  And so for me, you know, for someone on that deep level who originally was in Blue Book,
[02:21:59.950 --> 02:22:04.750]  the public Blue Book, not CIA Blue Book, which was the real program, but he was in
[02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:08.110]  public Blue Book. And then he came out and said, you know, Blue Book was a sham and I
[02:22:08.110 --> 02:22:10.750]  want to bring you the real thing and close encounters and all that.
[02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:12.910]  And he died there in the early 80s.
[02:22:13.230 --> 02:22:18.710]  But for him to track this back to a public mystery school in the work of Rudolf Steiner,
[02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:23.710]  for example, is extraordinary and gives us a much better idea of what the UFO file is
[02:22:23.710 --> 02:22:24.630]  really all about.
[02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:29.030]  Well, if you look at Skull and Bones and all these groups, they're trying to contact
[02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:34.750]  interdimensional entities they call angels or offworld or not of this realm.
[02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:38.710]  So the elites do believe they're in contact with these things and getting divine
[02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:42.190]  inspiration. So it sounds insane to us, but they're really into it.
[02:22:42.190 --> 02:22:46.510]  Of course, Steiner believed that there were, you know, higher dimensions, connections
[02:22:46.510 --> 02:22:47.950]  with that and all this going on.
[02:22:47.950 --> 02:22:53.510]  And you're saying these these government UFO high level people were basically saying
[02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:56.310]  that that it's not so much off world as it's interdimensional.
[02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:59.230]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:22:59.230 --> 02:23:03.910]  And when you get into well, if you look at Steiner's cosmology, anthroposophy, you're
[02:23:03.910 --> 02:23:06.590]  dealing with our harmonic forces.
[02:23:06.590 --> 02:23:10.830]  And when you look at what he says for the 21st century, he's really talking about a
[02:23:10.830 --> 02:23:12.430]  technological takeover.
[02:23:12.430 --> 02:23:15.950]  And he's talking about this astral force Armand that comes in.
[02:23:16.310 --> 02:23:18.790]  And Armand is a strange name for him to be using.
[02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:23.350]  It comes out of Persian mythology, but it's one of those names that sort of vouchsafe back
[02:23:23.350 --> 02:23:28.070]  there. But his stuff became so predictive that, you know, we often hear about people and
[02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:29.950]  their predictions and things that don't come true.
[02:23:30.310 --> 02:23:35.030]  But this guy was writing, you know, in 1910, 1920, and he's looking out into the 21st
[02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:38.030]  century and he's predicting the Internet and all these other things.
[02:23:38.510 --> 02:23:43.350]  And the idea is a few minutes for people who don't know, because I've only I read like
[02:23:43.350 --> 02:23:46.710]  one of his books, a scan of some of his research and his architecture and things.
[02:23:46.710 --> 02:23:50.510]  But for people who don't know about Steiner, what a visionary he was, whether he was
[02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:54.630]  right or just theoretically a genius, he predicted the modern world.
[02:23:54.990 --> 02:23:56.590]  Tell me about some of the things Steiner developed.
[02:23:56.630 --> 02:24:01.670]  Yeah, it's an excellent point of Steiner's, an Austrian mystic, and, you know, he
[02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:06.510]  definitely was a genius and a scholar in that period, and he was part of theosophy,
[02:24:06.830 --> 02:24:11.230]  which was a rollout of these mystery techniques that included things like psychic
[02:24:11.230 --> 02:24:13.070]  development back in the 19th century.
[02:24:13.470 --> 02:24:18.270]  You know, it created a lot of the spiritualism craze, but he broke away from that
[02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:22.750]  because he thought it was getting to Eastern and he thought, oh, this is a period for the
[02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:26.270]  Western initiators. This is the deeper mystery school aspects.
[02:24:26.310 --> 02:24:30.750]  And the idea was that there was basically a war inside those secret societies and
[02:24:30.750 --> 02:24:32.670]  mystery schools in the 19th century.
[02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:37.710]  Many of them didn't want to bring out a lot of these secrets involving our history and
[02:24:37.710 --> 02:24:41.350]  true history, Atlantis and things of this nature, because they were used to keeping
[02:24:41.350 --> 02:24:45.590]  secrets. But the other group was looking at it and saying, in a decade, we won't
[02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:50.310]  recognize humanity if we don't do this because of this scientific materialism.
[02:24:50.430 --> 02:24:56.430]  And he drew that in his cosmology into Ahriman, which is that force and spirit he
[02:24:56.430 --> 02:25:00.590]  predicted for the 21st century would be coming through the technology, and that would
[02:25:00.590 --> 02:25:03.030]  be the great challenge for humanity.
[02:25:03.390 --> 02:25:07.270]  But this is someone who developed biodynamic farming, for example.
[02:25:07.310 --> 02:25:13.630]  He developed the Waldorf schools for early childhood education and Eurythmy, which is
[02:25:13.630 --> 02:25:18.070]  a movement theater, you know, that goes all around the globe with these performances.
[02:25:18.070 --> 02:25:22.750]  And right in the middle of that, Rudolf Steiner is somebody who, you know, those
[02:25:22.750 --> 02:25:27.870]  schools, one of the first things that happened during the vaccine craze is those
[02:25:27.870 --> 02:25:31.390]  schools were heavily attacked because those people who were familiar with Steiner's
[02:25:31.390 --> 02:25:36.510]  concepts knew that he had predicted things about a vaccine that would remove someone's
[02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:40.510]  spiritual connection and that this would be a great challenge in the 21st century.
[02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:44.550]  Now, there are quotes of him saying that that are kind of rifling around the Internet.
[02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:45.550]  But in fact, it's true.
[02:25:45.550 --> 02:25:47.950]  I've read the particular book where he said that a hundred years ago.
[02:25:48.350 --> 02:25:54.510]  So looking at this with this Ahriman thing, he says, coming through the machines, the
[02:25:54.510 --> 02:26:01.710]  ghost machine in other religious cosmology or in union archetypes, is this like a
[02:26:01.710 --> 02:26:05.230]  Mordor figure or is it an evil figure or what is it?
[02:26:07.550 --> 02:26:10.230]  It is. It's the embodiment.
[02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:12.390]  It's the Mephistopheles character.
[02:26:12.430 --> 02:26:13.630]  It's the embodiment.
[02:26:13.630 --> 02:26:15.950]  It's the Mephistopheles character.
[02:26:15.950 --> 02:26:18.030]  It's the true devil in that sense.
[02:26:18.030 --> 02:26:22.910]  And he said he's tied up in the earthly evolution in anthroposophy.
[02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:24.150]  That's the way he describes it.
[02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:29.310]  But the idea is that it's a challenge for humanity to take this on at this particular
[02:26:29.310 --> 02:26:34.670]  time. And what Steiner was saying was this force was trying to develop something he
[02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:36.110]  called the eighth sphere.
[02:26:36.190 --> 02:26:39.070]  And the eighth sphere is basically a virtual reality zone.
[02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:43.910]  You know, when I see what they're doing with meta and the metaverse and all that, I
[02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:47.870]  can see it. You project yourself into this world and then basically you become the
[02:26:47.870 --> 02:26:49.070]  puppet of that thing.
[02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:50.470]  And it's like the Matrix.
[02:26:50.470 --> 02:26:54.350]  I mean, so many of those things from Twin Peaks to the Matrix to all these things,
[02:26:54.350 --> 02:26:56.710]  they all borrowed from Steiner, but they never mentioned him.
[02:26:56.790 --> 02:27:00.950]  And he had so many of these concepts deep there.
[02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:01.990]  But it's a warning.
[02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:06.230]  I could say that he spent basically about 40 years developing this.
[02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:07.950]  And he was in Germany.
[02:27:07.950 --> 02:27:08.950]  He was in Austria.
[02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:12.190]  The Nazis tried to run him out.
[02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:17.630]  They burnt down his Gurtianum and they saw him as a competitor on the esoteric side
[02:27:17.630 --> 02:27:22.590]  because their whole movement was wrapped up deeply as well with this.
[02:27:23.070 --> 02:27:25.710]  And, you know, they were deep in the occult on their own end.
[02:27:25.950 --> 02:27:30.750]  But Armand is interesting in this, which is that Steiner decided at a certain point to
[02:27:30.750 --> 02:27:34.830]  tune into it. And that sculpture you were just showing there is something that he
[02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:37.790]  sculpted himself about this force.
[02:27:37.790 --> 02:27:41.950]  And he said that when he tuned into it, he felt heavy, like he was in concrete.
[02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:48.870]  And then he realized that this force, this harmonic force was trying to make humanity
[02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:50.910]  into a gigantic deep freeze.
[02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:52.390]  This is where we get the nuclear piece.
[02:27:52.390 --> 02:27:54.190]  This is where they get the technology piece.
[02:27:54.430 --> 02:27:57.550]  It's pure mineral consciousness.
[02:27:57.710 --> 02:28:01.870]  And it's synthetic, it's silicon anti-carbon.
[02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:03.710]  Exactly.
[02:28:03.710 --> 02:28:08.590]  When you get into A.I. and so many of the transhumanist aspects, that's pure Armand.
[02:28:08.590 --> 02:28:11.350]  I mean, Steiner was a century ahead of his time on that.
[02:28:11.350 --> 02:28:15.230]  He psychically saw the future imprint of the silicon alien takeover.
[02:28:16.510 --> 02:28:17.510]  Exactly.
[02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:22.830]  And there's an interesting crisscross there with what we call alien also, because he
[02:28:22.830 --> 02:28:25.870]  does say that there's something trying to interfere with our life way.
[02:28:25.870 --> 02:28:28.910]  Well, stay there. Let's explain this, because here's the deal, folks, we're all looking
[02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:32.270]  for little green men in tin cans falling out of the sky.
[02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:34.790]  No, this is this is beyond.
[02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:35.870]  This is all dimensions.
[02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:39.310]  It's a force that wants us to build our own structure.
[02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:41.910]  That's what a real adversary does.
[02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:45.910]  It doesn't show up like we think of and line up like a revolutionary war and shoot each
[02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:48.510]  other with muskets and little green men with laser beams.
[02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:49.950]  Happens. That's how it works.
[02:28:49.950 --> 02:28:52.110]  It's a spiritual seduction.
[02:28:53.070 --> 02:28:54.190]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:28:57.310 --> 02:29:00.310]  You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce?
[02:29:00.310 --> 02:29:02.310]  Yeah. So, my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[02:29:02.310 --> 02:29:05.310]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[02:29:05.310 --> 02:29:07.310]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz.
[02:29:07.310 --> 02:29:09.310]  Four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers.
[02:29:09.310 --> 02:29:11.310]  And now two books with Alex Jones.
[02:29:11.310 --> 02:29:14.310]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[02:29:14.310 --> 02:29:18.310]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[02:29:18.310 --> 02:29:22.310]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[02:29:22.310 --> 02:29:27.310]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[02:29:27.310 --> 02:29:31.310]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer.
[02:29:31.310 --> 02:29:35.310]  And I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[02:29:35.310 --> 02:29:40.310]  So, it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day.
[02:29:40.310 --> 02:29:41.310]  And it helps me with my writing.
[02:29:41.310 --> 02:29:42.310]  All right. We love you.
[02:29:42.310 --> 02:29:43.310]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:43.310 --> 02:29:48.310]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at infowarstore.com.
[02:29:48.310 --> 02:29:49.310]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[02:29:52.310 --> 02:30:01.310]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[02:30:01.310 --> 02:30:06.310]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words plan for our future.
[02:30:06.310 --> 02:30:07.310]  That is a hellish future.
[02:30:07.310 --> 02:30:11.310]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[02:30:11.310 --> 02:30:14.310]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[02:30:14.310 --> 02:30:17.310]  at bookstores, Amazon, or infowarstore.com.
[02:30:17.310 --> 02:30:20.310]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[02:30:20.310 --> 02:30:22.310]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:30:22.310 --> 02:30:25.310]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:30:25.310 --> 02:30:28.310]  So, get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[02:30:28.310 --> 02:30:30.310]  a signed copy, at infowarstore.com.
[02:30:30.310 --> 02:30:34.310]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.

[02:30:44.310 --> 02:30:48.310]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarstore.com
[02:30:49.310 --> 02:30:53.310]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[02:30:53.310 --> 02:30:55.310]  or give them to the local school.

[02:33:03.310 --> 02:33:05.310]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:26.460]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[02:33:26.460 --> 02:33:27.460]  the InfoWar.
[02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:34.720]  Alright, I've been on air 29 years, and one of the biggest criticisms I ever got from
[02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:41.160]  listeners was, we cover UFOs less than mainstream media, and if you're, quote, a conspiracy
[02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:43.700]  show, why haven't you covered it?
[02:33:43.700 --> 02:33:48.920]  And it's because I've been studying it and looking at it for so long, and realizing that
[02:33:48.920 --> 02:33:56.160]  most of it is advanced government and corporate technology, and then also knowing that the
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:00.680]  different esoteric schools, the different mystery schools, and it goes right back to
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:04.800]  all the ancient texts, the Middle East, and, you know, Asia, was that we are visited by
[02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:08.760]  these off-world creatures, and they have manipulated the development of humans, and the creatures
[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:13.640]  even say they work for something that they say is God, you know, the cosmology of Christianity
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:16.600]  with the angels, the fallen angels.
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:22.720]  But if I couldn't get people to admit there were COG martial law plans when that was legislation,
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:28.200]  or that vaccines are having cancer viruses added to it when that's in the mainline documents,
[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:29.440]  why should I get into all this?
[02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:34.680]  But now, as I've said the last six, seven years, as they get ready to really go with
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:41.640]  this alien takeover invasion idea to really unify the planet under their control, now
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:43.240]  is the time to talk about it.
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:48.200]  But they don't make jokes about this around the billionaires and the elites.
[02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:51.000]  They know it's very real, but they say, we're going to be God.
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:52.400]  We're in a race to merge the machines.
[02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:54.520]  We're making new creatures.
[02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:58.760]  We're making silicon and synthetic DNA.
[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:02.000]  So we're thinking about the Hollywood image of the little gray men, the little flying
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:07.240]  saucer from Hollywood, and all these intelligence officers saying, oh, yeah, little gray men,
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:13.520]  little flying saucers, that blinds you to the fact that they're making new synthetic
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:14.520]  life forms.
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:16.160]  They're merging animals and humans.
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:18.400]  They're saying, we're creating a new AI life form.
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:22.600]  Yuval Harari, I played the clip yesterday, said, we're going to make AI God soon.
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:23.600]  It'll rule you.
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:25.360]  So that's the issue.
[02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:29.600]  And I see this all as a diversion.
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:33.880]  You're a polite guy, but you're also a really smart, dark journalist, darkjournalist.com.
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:38.000]  Just get in the big picture in the time we have left and cover the waterfront for us,
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.960]  what you think's really going on, what you think's about to happen.
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:43.160]  Well, that's great.
[02:35:43.160 --> 02:35:44.160]  I appreciate it.
[02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:49.039]  You know, what's happening really is the UFO threat is on overdrive.
[02:35:49.039 --> 02:35:53.560]  And there's a program back there, and I'm glad that you've talked about continuity of
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:57.320]  government all these years, because it's a crucial piece with this, because they've
[02:35:57.320 --> 02:36:02.440]  looked at different areas where they can seize those emergency powers through continuity
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:03.440]  of government.
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:08.280]  And the COG program is something that I got into in college because of Professor Scott's
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:09.520]  work.
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:12.280]  And Professor Scott was onto this before anybody.
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:13.880]  He was writing about it.
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:16.280]  And you know, there we have someone really from the left coast.
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:17.920]  So this is not a left or right issue.
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:20.720]  This is something everyone needs to know about.
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:25.960]  And he realized there were tremendous resources pouring into this program, and no one knew
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:26.960]  anything about it.
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:32.220]  And this is a program that came out directly of the Truman and Eisenhower administrations
[02:36:32.220 --> 02:36:37.600]  to create massive underground bunkers in the event of a nuclear attack.
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:41.560]  But later, they started to develop their own communications network.
[02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:44.960]  And the idea was generally a good one at first, which is you're going to survive a nuclear
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:49.119]  war with the Russians, just in case you need a secondary government.
[02:36:49.119 --> 02:36:54.960]  Well, over time, they morphed that and changed the wording to say nuclear emergency to any
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:56.480]  emergency.
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:37:00.400]  And Dick Cheney was heavily involved with that planning, along with Donald Rumsfeld,
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:03.640]  North, and that whole gang in the 80s.
[02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:09.600]  And what that group did is they went to Reagan with a scientist named Norm Berggren.
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:15.800]  And Berggren said, I'm looking at gigantic craft in the rings of Saturn.
[02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:19.000]  And he wrote later a book called Ringmakers of Saturn.
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.760]  And this guy was a NASA scientist.
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:26.440]  And this apparently scared Reagan, who knew all about the UFO file.
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:31.039]  And there was a famous story about him hosting Steven Spielberg at the White House.
[02:37:31.039 --> 02:37:35.160]  And when they played E.T., when they turned the movie off, he said, everyone in this room
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:39.880]  knows that that's actually an autobiography story.
[02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:40.880]  It's the real thing.
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:42.560]  It's not fiction.
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:47.840]  And Spielberg went over to him and shook his hand and said, thank you for admitting that.
[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:49.880]  So they had this other 80s piece.
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:55.680]  And we know Reagan talked extensively about the world joining against an alien threat.
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:00.600]  Mikhail Gorbachev came out and talked about this with Charlie Rose before Rose went down
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:01.880]  in his big sex scandal.
[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:04.800]  And he's sitting there in this room in New York.
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:09.119]  And he says, you know, actually, Reagan took me aside in Reykjavik and said, will you help
[02:38:09.119 --> 02:38:14.440]  us fight the aliens, you know, and will you help us in this alien invasion?
[02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:17.119]  And he said he was absolutely serious when he said it.
[02:38:17.119 --> 02:38:21.520]  Now, this is one of the reasons why they like to keep these leaders away from each other,
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:25.280]  because when they get together without State Department interference, they'll talk about
[02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:26.640]  the UFO file.
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:32.400]  And that is the biggest secret inside the U.S. government, far beyond the nuclear secrets.
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:37.240]  And you know, the type of technology that they have in relation to the UFO file surpasses
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:38.240]  that.
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:43.000]  And as a matter of fact, I've heard them talk in their own documents saying that the torsion
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:49.360]  physics around the UFO file make the nuclear program look like a firecracker.
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:53.680]  So when we think of it that way, we have to really understand the level of secrecy that
[02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:58.680]  they're keeping it on, but also the intense advantage that they have as a ruling structure.
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:02.300]  So the UFO file is the biggest secret that they have.
[02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:07.960]  And what they need to do is find a way after having developed this breakaway group, this
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:12.560]  breakaway technology to break it back in because they have the advantage of the technology
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:13.800]  they want to profit from it.
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:18.280]  They want to consolidate and they don't want the entire culture to freak out while they're
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:23.600]  doing that, realizing that they're operating on a totally different level than the public
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:27.960]  and that the public's been footing the bill, not only for that, but for an entirely secret
[02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:29.560]  space infrastructure.
[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:30.840]  This is what we've been dealing with.
[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:31.840]  Can we just go?
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:32.840]  I'm going to skip this break, too.
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:33.840]  This is too important.
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:34.840]  Can we go back?
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:38.860]  I remember reading about that later with a top NASA official with these superpower telescopes
[02:39:38.860 --> 02:39:41.140]  seeing giant craft.
[02:39:41.140 --> 02:39:43.940]  And then I've talked to NASA officials, but it's come out even on Discovery Channel.
[02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:44.940]  It's real.
[02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:47.340]  The Apollo missions then being followed by craft.
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:51.660]  Now the Russian, the Chinese, the Japanese, the Indian probes go to the moon.
[02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:52.660]  Something blows them up.
[02:39:52.660 --> 02:39:54.660]  Is that the U.S. doing it or something else?
[02:39:54.660 --> 02:40:00.660]  But even though it's the U.S. now, who was there following the Apollo program every time?
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:02.700]  Exactly.
[02:40:02.700 --> 02:40:06.100]  And this is the nature of the problem when you go back into that era.
[02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:09.539]  If you look at a number of these missions, they all get thwarted.
[02:40:09.539 --> 02:40:14.500]  And missions to Mars, when we send out these rovers and things, they get completely thrown
[02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:15.500]  off course.
[02:40:15.500 --> 02:40:18.740]  So somebody else is operating in the space.
[02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:19.740]  That's crucial.
[02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:20.740]  Number one.
[02:40:20.740 --> 02:40:23.860]  They understood that during the development of the moon programs.
[02:40:23.860 --> 02:40:27.940]  They were tipped off about that by the paperclip Nazi scientists who've been studying it for
[02:40:27.940 --> 02:40:32.100]  a long time and were way ahead on that Nazi rocket program.
[02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:37.580]  So by the time you get to NASA, basically one of the big ideas is we need to go up there
[02:40:37.580 --> 02:40:40.340]  and we need to see who else is operating up there.
[02:40:40.340 --> 02:40:45.860]  And we need to be able to maintain the secrecy around that because if you find yourself going
[02:40:45.860 --> 02:40:51.780]  to the moon or Mars and you find ruins there extensively, well, it blows away everything
[02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:54.940]  that you've been saying about there are no off-world civilizations.
[02:40:54.940 --> 02:40:58.539]  So there's a big problem in relation to NASA.
[02:40:58.539 --> 02:41:01.060]  It's the ultimate secret keeper.
[02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:04.300]  And they developed it and they got people involved.
[02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:10.220]  One of the guys who was involved directly with NASA was Lloyd Berkner.
[02:41:10.220 --> 02:41:15.460]  And he was somebody who headed up the Robertson panel, which was the UFO study in 1952.
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:18.539]  So the NASA UFO crisscross is huge.
[02:41:18.539 --> 02:41:22.980]  There's a weird little historical footnote about Berkner as well, which is the person
[02:41:22.980 --> 02:41:28.740]  that Kennedy was going to see when he was about to get assassinated in Dallas, the person
[02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:33.380]  at the trademark that he was going to hand the White House flag to was Lloyd Berkner
[02:41:33.380 --> 02:41:35.860]  and they were going to make a statement together.
[02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:40.500]  So that's just very unusual when you think of Berkner.
[02:41:40.500 --> 02:41:45.260]  He was one of these guys inside the Robertson panel, the early UFO development and the
[02:41:45.260 --> 02:41:47.060]  early UFO secrecy.
[02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:53.300]  And I think what you're looking at there is we have an entirely different history on one
[02:41:53.300 --> 02:41:56.580]  hand, one, two, an entirely different technology.
[02:41:56.900 --> 02:42:02.900]  And that technology secures an advantage in science, in medicine, you know, in space
[02:42:02.900 --> 02:42:08.700]  travel. And the idea that we haven't gone back to the moon in 50 years, you know, proves
[02:42:08.700 --> 02:42:11.100]  that out. Suddenly they're like, hey, we're going back to the moon.
[02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:13.020]  Well, what have you been doing for 50 years?
[02:42:13.140 --> 02:42:14.619]  Well, let's well, let's raise this point.
[02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:19.539]  Then I see them discrediting things and putting out their own disinfo movements like
[02:42:19.780 --> 02:42:21.380]  nobody censors the Flat Earthers.
[02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:24.940]  And I actually see that being pushed to where they go, oh, no, nothing you've been told
[02:42:24.940 --> 02:42:28.180]  is real, even though I can look at a telescope, my own personal telescope, see the moons
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:29.420]  of Saturn, see it turning.
[02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:32.340]  You see things are spheres that that's what it is.
[02:42:32.660 --> 02:42:34.980]  But but then people discredit the whole systems.
[02:42:34.980 --> 02:42:37.300]  They say, no, it must all be a lie.
[02:42:37.619 --> 02:42:43.140]  And I really see the system pushing an anti-science understanding and really dumbing
[02:42:43.140 --> 02:42:46.020]  the public down. So they have no understanding of what's happening to them.
[02:42:47.619 --> 02:42:52.340]  Exactly, the Flat Earth is the best example of that, that's pure psyop brought to you by
[02:42:52.340 --> 02:42:53.619]  the intelligence agencies.
[02:42:53.860 --> 02:42:56.860]  And, you know, no one with a brain believes anything about the Flat Earth.
[02:42:56.860 --> 02:43:02.020]  It's absurd. Well, they say stuff like if the Earth's spinning at twenty five or thirty
[02:43:02.020 --> 02:43:03.820]  thousand miles an hour, why don't we fly off of it?
[02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:07.300]  How do you sit in an airplane at six hundred miles an hour and not fly out of it because
[02:43:07.300 --> 02:43:09.460]  it's going at its speed and the Earth's going at its speed?
[02:43:09.460 --> 02:43:11.700]  I mean, it's just it's just ridiculous.
[02:43:11.700 --> 02:43:13.780]  It's absolutely no nothing about science.
[02:43:13.900 --> 02:43:15.100]  And I want to get mad at them.
[02:43:15.140 --> 02:43:17.340]  It's just that it's just it's ridiculous.
[02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:22.380]  Well, this is interesting, isn't it, because if you inundate people with enough
[02:43:22.380 --> 02:43:26.860]  concepts, there's there's so many mind blowing concepts of the actual reality and
[02:43:26.860 --> 02:43:29.100]  we're in a great period of discovery.
[02:43:29.340 --> 02:43:33.300]  But if you can sort of maneuver the discovery so that people think, ah, you know, I'm
[02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:37.260]  getting the UFO file, it's this CIA group is going to bring it to me.
[02:43:37.260 --> 02:43:39.020]  The CIA wants to bring me to Jesus.
[02:43:39.020 --> 02:43:43.900]  This is great. You know, before the regular UFO researchers understood that the CIA were
[02:43:43.900 --> 02:43:45.700]  the ones who invented the secrecy.
[02:43:45.700 --> 02:43:47.220]  They created the secrecy wall.
[02:43:47.220 --> 02:43:51.060]  And the thing that they were really good at in the intelligence agencies was lying to
[02:43:51.060 --> 02:43:53.340]  people. That was the nature of it.
[02:43:53.860 --> 02:44:00.500]  So, you know, now we have a situation where these agencies from CIA, DIA, NRO, the
[02:44:00.500 --> 02:44:06.020]  Homeland Security, you know, they all have their own mode of how to deal with the
[02:44:06.020 --> 02:44:09.500]  public on this. And if anyone gets too close to it, they're discredited.
[02:44:09.500 --> 02:44:14.740]  One or in some cases, there's a whole list of UFO researchers who are just dealt with.
[02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:17.060]  They were bumped off, you know, going back to the 50s.
[02:44:17.060 --> 02:44:21.580]  And by the way, for TV viewers, this is official stuff shot from Apollo missions of what
[02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:24.180]  they see flying around. And the astronauts have given interviews.
[02:44:24.500 --> 02:44:25.780]  This is what they saw.
[02:44:26.140 --> 02:44:28.420]  And I've talked to NASA controllers that were friends of mine.
[02:44:28.420 --> 02:44:30.340]  One of them died a few years ago, Raymond Teague.
[02:44:30.340 --> 02:44:34.460]  And he said, no, they saw this on their RCA TV screens that was being beamed back to
[02:44:34.460 --> 02:44:36.060]  Earth. I mean, what in the hell is that?
[02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:38.300]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:44:38.300 --> 02:44:39.619]  That's incredible footage.
[02:44:40.619 --> 02:44:45.820]  There was a guy who just took the feeds off of NASA for a while, and he definitely
[02:44:45.820 --> 02:44:48.340]  showed. And this is back in the early 2000s.
[02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:53.460]  And we were you'd see all sorts of stuff flying at like 50,000 miles an hour and even
[02:44:53.460 --> 02:44:55.020]  beams from Earth trying to shoot it down.
[02:44:55.020 --> 02:44:57.780]  Remember that? Yes, exactly.
[02:44:57.980 --> 02:45:00.260]  We were trying to get that's SDI in action, right?
[02:45:00.260 --> 02:45:02.660]  That's the actual Star Wars program, if you think about it.
[02:45:03.539 --> 02:45:06.980]  And we have a space defense development that came out of that.
[02:45:06.980 --> 02:45:09.340]  A guy named Philip Corso revealed a lot of that.
[02:45:09.340 --> 02:45:14.220]  And he got, you know, really by the end of his life, there were so many lawsuits against
[02:45:14.220 --> 02:45:17.180]  him. But he'd been in the government in the 50s and 60s.
[02:45:17.180 --> 02:45:23.140]  And the what he said was that the Kennedys tracked the UFO file very closely and that
[02:45:23.140 --> 02:45:27.180]  some of the planes that were developed in that period, like the X-15, were to chase
[02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:29.380]  UFOs. They wanted to see what was going on there.
[02:45:29.380 --> 02:45:31.980]  And these things were way too fast for them, of course.
[02:45:31.980 --> 02:45:36.780]  So there's some other operational piece going on there with the UFO file.
[02:45:37.100 --> 02:45:41.380]  We ought to dig up that official NASA footage shot at the International Space Station
[02:45:41.380 --> 02:45:44.940]  where you see these things just flying around and you see the beams trying to shoot.
[02:45:44.940 --> 02:45:46.140]  And I forgot about those films.
[02:45:46.300 --> 02:45:47.539]  And they admit that's all real.
[02:45:47.539 --> 02:45:49.820]  It's not debated. I mean, it's just like insane.
[02:45:50.740 --> 02:45:53.700]  Well, here's the other thing that's interesting about that, which is if you think
[02:45:53.700 --> 02:45:59.300]  about it, before we got into CGI heavily and before, you know, we got into all the
[02:45:59.300 --> 02:46:04.300]  modern advances around being able to manipulate video now, basically anything that
[02:46:04.300 --> 02:46:05.860]  comes out, you can't trust at all.
[02:46:06.060 --> 02:46:10.820]  So the recent case in Las Vegas, you know, where they have some footage of this thing
[02:46:10.820 --> 02:46:13.780]  crashing, I'm not saying something didn't, but, you know, the story and they were like,
[02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:17.140]  oh, these beings were walking around and there's no real evidence to it.
[02:46:17.180 --> 02:46:17.940]  It's very easy.
[02:46:17.940 --> 02:46:22.420]  Well, you can also just have a craft above Bluebeam that's creating a hologram and
[02:46:22.420 --> 02:46:23.220]  doing it all for you.
[02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:29.539]  Yes, exactly, they're on such an advanced level with that, and, you know, the
[02:46:29.539 --> 02:46:34.020]  hologram thing is important, too, when it comes to the UFO file, the problem that we
[02:46:34.020 --> 02:46:38.860]  have is that the understanding around the government and the media and how they
[02:46:38.860 --> 02:46:42.180]  obfuscate the UFO file needs to be really out there.
[02:46:42.180 --> 02:46:45.860]  We've got a big softening of that whole thing with the whole idea that, hey, the
[02:46:45.860 --> 02:46:49.460]  government is finally giving us the UFO file and what they're doing is they're
[02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:50.580]  trying to drum up a threat.
[02:46:50.580 --> 02:46:54.100]  Whenever you look at these headlines, they're always going into the idea that
[02:46:54.100 --> 02:46:55.580]  there's a threat involved in that.
[02:46:55.580 --> 02:46:57.740]  They've been pounding that home heavily.
[02:46:57.740 --> 02:47:03.180]  There's a guy over here at the Harvard Astronomy Lab, Avi Loeb, and he has the
[02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:04.220]  Galileo project.
[02:47:04.220 --> 02:47:08.539]  It's all these intelligence people, and their whole thing is, oh, the Oumuamua
[02:47:08.539 --> 02:47:12.900]  object that came in from interstellar space, that was an AI probe, and they're
[02:47:12.900 --> 02:47:17.220]  sending all these probes out into, you know, the world, and, you know, their
[02:47:17.220 --> 02:47:18.020]  ships are already here.
[02:47:18.020 --> 02:47:22.619]  And say that again, a few years ago, that big, giant, probe-looking rock that they
[02:47:22.619 --> 02:47:26.260]  said, you know, didn't look like it was naturally occurring, what's the name of
[02:47:26.260 --> 02:47:26.500]  that again?
[02:47:26.500 --> 02:47:27.180]  We'll pull that up.
[02:47:28.180 --> 02:47:29.980]  Oumuamua, yes.
[02:47:30.380 --> 02:47:36.220]  The Oumuamua space object, guys, pull that up, and let's expand on that.
[02:47:36.220 --> 02:47:38.860]  We have a ranch in East Texas, family property.
[02:47:38.860 --> 02:47:39.860]  We used to go there all the time.
[02:47:39.860 --> 02:47:41.020]  I lived in Dallas growing up.
[02:47:41.020 --> 02:47:42.020]  We still go there sometimes.
[02:47:42.020 --> 02:47:46.580]  But I remember being about seven years old, driving in my dad's truck.
[02:47:46.580 --> 02:47:49.619]  We'd been down to the ranch to see his family and, you know, shoot some guns and
[02:47:49.619 --> 02:47:52.060]  stuff, and it's like 10 o'clock in the morning.
[02:47:52.060 --> 02:47:56.100]  We're on I-45 driving to Dallas, and my dad goes, look at that.
[02:47:57.100 --> 02:48:01.619]  And there were three stealth fighters that they didn't bring out for, like, 20
[02:48:01.619 --> 02:48:07.580]  something years, but with camouflage, but, like, Navy camouflage, like light blue and
[02:48:07.580 --> 02:48:11.340]  gray, and I still remember them, like, going, and then they hit their afterburners
[02:48:11.340 --> 02:48:14.700]  with, and they were only, like, 500 feet, and my dad goes, look at those secret
[02:48:14.700 --> 02:48:18.940]  aircraft, and I remember just seeing them go, and it was only, like, 10 seconds, and
[02:48:18.940 --> 02:48:24.220]  we're driving to the car, and we see them, but the point is, that's a UFO.
[02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:26.260]  Never seen that craft, don't know what it is.
[02:48:26.260 --> 02:48:29.900]  Somebody else thought it was an alien, but I remember all the years later, when
[02:48:29.900 --> 02:48:32.740]  they finally rolled out the stealth fighter, I guess at the first Gulf War, I
[02:48:32.740 --> 02:48:34.820]  went, oh, I saw those when I was a kid.
[02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:38.380]  So, again, so much of it is that.
[02:48:38.380 --> 02:48:44.180]  There's no question, and what's amazing is they've had this footage, a TV group,
[02:48:44.180 --> 02:48:50.900]  and there was a whole TV crew in Australia in 1979 that filmed a UFO over an airport,
[02:48:50.900 --> 02:48:53.820]  coming into the airport, and they filmed it for three hours.
[02:48:53.820 --> 02:49:00.220]  So, you know, the idea that the CIA rolled out UFOs in 2017, and that, oh,
[02:49:00.220 --> 02:49:05.220]  hey, we have UAP, you know, which is their made-up Intel name for UFOs, and that
[02:49:05.220 --> 02:49:08.660]  they can kind of recreate this thing and give it a whole different trajectory in
[02:49:08.660 --> 02:49:13.100]  history, instead of admitting to the fact that they've hid these occurrences and
[02:49:13.100 --> 02:49:17.980]  this technology for 80 years, and part of that is they don't want us to know that
[02:49:17.980 --> 02:49:22.660]  there's something up there that, you know, they're not in complete control of, and
[02:49:22.700 --> 02:49:26.340]  they want to give us their version of it, which is the UFO threat part.
[02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:31.340]  And there's no question that these craft, when they occur, certainly demonstrate
[02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:34.820]  abilities far beyond anything that we have.
[02:49:34.820 --> 02:49:38.500]  Sure, but let's get back to that object a few years ago that came through the solar
[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:42.780]  system that, I mean, obviously was, by the way, that's exactly what I saw when I was
[02:49:42.780 --> 02:49:47.780]  a kid, I mean, for TV viewers, but it had different camouflage paint on it.
[02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:52.100]  I mean, what's the best thing, you know, what that giant object was?
[02:49:54.460 --> 02:50:00.780]  Well, it was interesting because when it came in, it's unusual in the history for
[02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:04.820]  us to have anything that big sort of roaming around the solar system and
[02:50:04.820 --> 02:50:11.619]  coming in, and there were all the speculations and Harvard physicists and
[02:50:11.619 --> 02:50:15.740]  scientists were coming forward saying, oh, that's an AI and it's giving us the
[02:50:15.740 --> 02:50:19.300]  advantage, you know, the ability to develop our AI to talk to it.
[02:50:19.300 --> 02:50:24.140]  And, but there was something very unusual about the appearance of this thing.
[02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:28.060]  It almost seemed engineered and the stories that came out afterwards.
[02:50:28.060 --> 02:50:33.420]  So, there's this whole idea now deep inside Harvard that we can communicate
[02:50:33.420 --> 02:50:37.900]  with this and there are pieces of what it left behind, and they actually have funded
[02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:44.260]  programs going to look for what Oumuamua left behind on the planet and deposit it
[02:50:44.260 --> 02:50:45.340]  into oceans.
[02:50:45.340 --> 02:50:49.779]  And it's interesting because there's a gigantic ocean and river signature
[02:50:49.779 --> 02:50:51.580]  associated with UFOs.
[02:50:51.580 --> 02:50:56.300]  Even if you go back into some of the best cases like Betty Hill and that whole case
[02:50:56.300 --> 02:51:02.180]  in New Hampshire, she said that there were, for months after her sighting, all of
[02:51:02.180 --> 02:51:06.860]  these UFOs that were coming out of the water, people in New Hampshire were lining
[02:51:06.860 --> 02:51:10.020]  up along the river watching these things come out of the water.
[02:51:10.020 --> 02:51:14.220]  And it became almost like, you know, a block party of people watching the UFO
[02:51:14.220 --> 02:51:15.140]  activity.
[02:51:15.140 --> 02:51:19.260]  So, there's definitely something heavy duty that's operating there.
[02:51:19.260 --> 02:51:25.420]  The question is identifying the stuff that they're projecting on the government
[02:51:25.420 --> 02:51:29.260]  side, the false CIA disclosure versus the real thing.
[02:51:29.260 --> 02:51:33.420]  And that's crucial in this period because they're trying to build, you know,
[02:51:33.420 --> 02:51:35.340]  the whole street legend is Blue Beam.
[02:51:35.340 --> 02:51:38.100]  This is the thing that they've been trying to build up because it gives them
[02:51:38.100 --> 02:51:41.700]  absolutely indisputable emergency power.
[02:51:41.740 --> 02:51:42.860]  It gives them so many angles.
[02:51:42.860 --> 02:51:45.420]  They can attack us and say it's aliens.
[02:51:45.420 --> 02:51:49.180]  If a satellite with nuclear weapons blows up, they say it's aliens.
[02:51:49.180 --> 02:51:52.820]  They've already pre-programmed us that aliens are imminent.
[02:51:52.820 --> 02:51:55.140]  So, it's almost like a new God cosmology they control.
[02:51:55.140 --> 02:51:58.700]  But then, as you said, Reagan was worried about these huge craft that NASA was
[02:51:58.700 --> 02:52:00.660]  scanning out in space.
[02:52:00.660 --> 02:52:03.860]  And now, this object you talked about comes through.
[02:52:03.860 --> 02:52:07.380]  I'm no physicist, but physicists agreed, that isn't getting formed in an asteroid
[02:52:07.380 --> 02:52:08.060]  belt.
[02:52:08.060 --> 02:52:10.980]  I mean, that looks exactly what physicists predicted, that aliens that were really
[02:52:10.980 --> 02:52:16.740]  going over large masses would be inside giant asteroids for protection and that
[02:52:16.740 --> 02:52:19.980]  they would be aerodynamic, basically, in those spaces of vacuum.
[02:52:19.980 --> 02:52:23.940]  And then, indeed, that's what this thing cruising through our solar system looks
[02:52:23.940 --> 02:52:24.740]  like it's doing.
[02:52:24.740 --> 02:52:25.700]  I mean, this is bizarre.
[02:52:25.700 --> 02:52:29.500]  And the Hellbop cult killed themselves believing there was something behind
[02:52:29.500 --> 02:52:29.900]  comets.
[02:52:29.900 --> 02:52:32.820]  But I've talked to amateur astronomers and others and people that actually work
[02:52:32.820 --> 02:52:36.420]  at the McDonnell-Douglas one, and they say, no, they routinely see big stuff
[02:52:36.420 --> 02:52:38.420]  following and inside comets.
[02:52:38.420 --> 02:52:41.140]  Do you have any intel on that?
[02:52:41.140 --> 02:52:43.340]  That is really fascinating.
[02:52:43.340 --> 02:52:45.700]  Well, they have so much that they've been tracking.
[02:52:45.700 --> 02:52:51.100]  For example, SpaceX has tremendous amounts of UFO video that they've been tracking
[02:52:51.100 --> 02:52:52.380]  from their position.
[02:52:52.380 --> 02:52:55.420]  They have all the agreements of governments with satellites and everything else that
[02:52:55.420 --> 02:52:55.980]  they can track.
[02:52:55.980 --> 02:52:58.300]  Starlink is completely set up there.
[02:52:58.300 --> 02:53:03.220]  I wouldn't be surprised if half of Starlink isn't set up just to track UFOs.
[02:53:03.220 --> 02:53:06.900]  No, exactly, it's a cover story for communications, but it's the Earth Defense
[02:53:06.940 --> 02:53:08.460]  Network.
[02:53:08.460 --> 02:53:09.220]  Exactly.
[02:53:09.220 --> 02:53:11.100]  And they tried this once before.
[02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:13.740]  This was the first satellites that we set up.
[02:53:13.740 --> 02:53:16.220]  They said, oh, we're going to keep an eye on the Soviet Union.
[02:53:16.220 --> 02:53:18.820]  But everyone else noticed that on the back end, they could look out into the
[02:53:18.820 --> 02:53:19.700]  universe.
[02:53:19.700 --> 02:53:22.980]  So they were tracking what was coming in as well as looking down on the ground.
[02:53:22.980 --> 02:53:24.340]  Let me tell you a story.
[02:53:24.340 --> 02:53:30.180]  Okay, so this is six years ago.
[02:53:30.180 --> 02:53:35.220]  Trump's in office about a year, and I'm going to leave it at this.
[02:53:35.220 --> 02:53:38.700]  But I'm talking to people high up with Elon Musk who were in the White House
[02:53:38.700 --> 02:53:40.980]  meetings with Trump and Trump Green.
[02:53:40.980 --> 02:53:42.940]  And I was asked, why are you telling me this?
[02:53:42.940 --> 02:53:44.500]  Because this is like dangerous.
[02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:47.220]  They said, no, we've chosen you to let you say this.
[02:53:47.220 --> 02:53:49.940]  I mean, this is like, I'm going to leave it at this, okay?
[02:53:49.940 --> 02:53:51.460]  And I said, so I'm allowed to say this?
[02:53:51.460 --> 02:53:52.340]  And it was just this info?
[02:53:52.340 --> 02:53:55.060]  And they go, well, you decide, but this meeting happened.
[02:53:55.060 --> 02:53:56.619]  And these are good sources.
[02:53:56.619 --> 02:54:00.660]  So Trump Green lit some giant secret project on the dark side of the moon.
[02:54:00.660 --> 02:54:04.300]  So obviously, people can't see it and satellites and telescopes can't see it.
[02:54:04.300 --> 02:54:06.460]  Just like what was the Brad Pitt movie came out a few years ago,
[02:54:06.460 --> 02:54:07.940]  where they go to the dark side of the moon,
[02:54:07.940 --> 02:54:10.140]  there's a big launch base to Mars and beyond there.
[02:54:10.140 --> 02:54:13.820]  That's where you want to build it because it's protected from the sun,
[02:54:13.820 --> 02:54:15.140]  solar radiation, all that.
[02:54:15.140 --> 02:54:16.500]  We want to build it just right over the edge.
[02:54:16.500 --> 02:54:17.980]  They said, no, that's actually there.
[02:54:17.980 --> 02:54:21.460]  And that reportedly Elon Musk already had a test going, but
[02:54:21.460 --> 02:54:26.060]  he got green lit for giant 3D printers and a whole new base.
[02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:28.860]  He says he wants to launch from the dark side, so it's not a secret.
[02:54:28.900 --> 02:54:35.220]  But I was told that he's running a secret space program,
[02:54:35.220 --> 02:54:39.340]  it's basically Space Force, and that the base is already set up and
[02:54:39.340 --> 02:54:43.180]  that he was getting funding for part two of it on the dark side of the moon.
[02:54:43.180 --> 02:54:44.700]  And again, people think that sounds crazy.
[02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:47.940]  Buzz Aldrin told me two years before the Indians found water with a probe
[02:54:47.940 --> 02:54:49.900]  that would be announced in one year they were going to crash a probe,
[02:54:49.900 --> 02:54:51.060]  they would find water.
[02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:55.380]  He told me 15 years before it hit the news that they'd actually sent astronauts
[02:54:55.420 --> 02:55:00.540]  to the moon of Mars, and that there's an obelisk there that 2001's based on and
[02:55:00.540 --> 02:55:02.900]  all this other stuff, and then years later that came out.
[02:55:02.900 --> 02:55:05.900]  Now, maybe he was giving me part of the disinfo op that's coming out later, or
[02:55:05.900 --> 02:55:09.980]  maybe it's true, but I mean, Buzz Aldrin said all that on my show and
[02:55:09.980 --> 02:55:13.220]  more in private, so the point is a lot of weirdness is going on.
[02:55:13.220 --> 02:55:14.619]  So what do you make of that?
[02:55:16.260 --> 02:55:17.619]  Well, that's absolutely fascinating, and
[02:55:17.619 --> 02:55:19.820]  I'm glad you put Musk right in the center of it.
[02:55:19.820 --> 02:55:23.380]  Because this is a guy who, they've made the new Howard Hughes and
[02:55:23.380 --> 02:55:29.100]  everything else, but with SpaceX, this is his crucial role, in my opinion,
[02:55:29.100 --> 02:55:33.540]  which is the ability to set up and cash in on that space infrastructure.
[02:55:33.540 --> 02:55:38.460]  Now, it's a little known thing that some of those early SpaceX trials and
[02:55:38.460 --> 02:55:43.980]  things all come out of a program called OTROG, which was in the 1980s.
[02:55:43.980 --> 02:55:46.540]  And they were setting off rockets in the Congo,
[02:55:46.540 --> 02:55:49.340]  they called it an Area 51 in the Congo.
[02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:53.779]  And the people who were associated with that originally were the leftovers
[02:55:53.779 --> 02:55:56.900]  of the paperclip group that came in and ran NASA.
[02:55:56.900 --> 02:56:00.140]  And one of the people in that whole group was Kurt Davis,
[02:56:00.140 --> 02:56:03.300]  who was one of the people who helped us get to the moon.
[02:56:03.300 --> 02:56:10.020]  And his signature was that he got all the UFO file reports from NASA.
[02:56:10.020 --> 02:56:15.580]  So there's a direct link from NASA, the UFO file, through OTROG into SpaceX,
[02:56:15.619 --> 02:56:19.779]  which makes the whole Musk thing, we have to get much deeper with that.
[02:56:19.779 --> 02:56:22.740]  And he has to really, when he's talking about aliens and
[02:56:22.740 --> 02:56:24.700]  blowing it off, that's ridiculous.
[02:56:24.700 --> 02:56:27.980]  That's because he's not allowed to talk about certain things.
[02:56:27.980 --> 02:56:30.740]  But we're looking at a number of different things,
[02:56:30.740 --> 02:56:34.060]  because if you look also, there's a group called Autech,
[02:56:34.060 --> 02:56:38.100]  which operates off of Bimini, and that's A-U-T-E-C.
[02:56:38.100 --> 02:56:41.700]  And they're the underwater Area 51, they also-
[02:56:41.740 --> 02:56:43.740]  You got to come back soon to talk about all that,
[02:56:43.740 --> 02:56:49.700]  because this is all exactly underwater, 77% of the Earth, that's huge right there.
[02:56:49.700 --> 02:56:51.180]  Yes, exactly.
[02:56:51.180 --> 02:56:53.260]  Well, there's more sightings there off Bimini
[02:56:53.260 --> 02:56:55.860]  than there is anywhere else in that whole area.
[02:56:55.860 --> 02:56:58.619]  Well, that's what William Cooper said, but you nailed it.
[02:56:58.619 --> 02:57:00.060]  People ask me, who is Elon Musk?
[02:57:00.060 --> 02:57:02.180]  He's Howard Hughes 2.0.
[02:57:02.180 --> 02:57:04.380]  For those that don't know, he was a total CIA front.
[02:57:04.380 --> 02:57:07.500]  So they repeat the same thing where they have this boy genius type,
[02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:11.140]  who's their guy, and it's not the government, it's this genius.
[02:57:11.140 --> 02:57:12.420]  But why did they choose Elon Musk?
[02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:15.060]  Do five more minutes with us, then Jay Dyer is going to take over.
[02:57:15.060 --> 02:57:16.380]  I'm going to ask him to continue a little bit.
[02:57:16.380 --> 02:57:17.700]  He always is well-prepared.
[02:57:17.700 --> 02:57:21.619]  Sure, he's got a whole other topic to cover, but man, this is just wild, folks.
[02:57:21.619 --> 02:57:23.500]  The point is, we were never in Kansas.
[02:57:23.500 --> 02:57:24.660]  We're not in Kansas.
[02:57:24.660 --> 02:57:26.340]  We're on a planet in the middle of space.
[02:57:26.340 --> 02:57:30.740]  Fantastical stuff's all around us, and they don't want us thinking about it.
[02:57:30.740 --> 02:57:31.900]  Take one of the moons of Saturn.
[02:57:31.900 --> 02:57:32.619]  It's the Death Star.
[02:57:32.619 --> 02:57:37.220]  It's where Lucas got the idea for it, and it literally looks like the Death Star.
[02:57:37.220 --> 02:57:39.940]  I mean, it's just all of this, they're telling you something.
[02:57:39.940 --> 02:57:41.900]  We'll be right back with hour number four.
[02:57:41.900 --> 02:57:43.380]  Stay with us.

[02:58:59.020 --> 02:59:01.660]  We have to end the sale, because at current sales rates in two weeks,
[02:59:01.660 --> 02:59:02.779]  it will be gone.

[02:59:05.020 --> 02:59:06.300]  your electrochemical activity.

[02:59:07.940 --> 02:59:09.660]  Without it, without iodine, you die.
[02:59:09.660 --> 02:59:13.180]  That's why they're targeting iodine, taking it out of the diet.
[02:59:13.180 --> 02:59:13.779]  You need it.
[02:59:13.779 --> 02:59:15.820]  They put the bad allergens in, the blocked iodine,
[02:59:15.820 --> 02:59:18.860]  and the chlorine, the fluoride, the bromine.

[02:59:47.200 --> 02:59:53.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:53.200 --> 02:59:55.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:16.200 --> 03:00:21.240]  The DMT test for 50 years, the CIA and other systems, with like astronaut, like people
[03:00:21.240 --> 03:00:25.800]  mapping and communicating with these entities, it's all been taken very, very seriously.
[03:00:25.800 --> 03:00:28.240]  We should take it very, very seriously.
[03:00:28.240 --> 03:00:35.120]  But in closing, the whole question about Elon Musk, about Trump, is everything what it seems?
[03:00:35.120 --> 03:00:37.000]  What about this insane indictment of Trump?
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:40.200]  So just closing comments here in the five minutes we have left and I really appreciate
[03:00:40.200 --> 03:00:41.200]  your time.
[03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:43.400]  It's great to be here, Alex.
[03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:45.860]  I appreciate it.
[03:00:45.860 --> 03:00:49.500]  One of the things I'll say in relation to Trump is there's no question in my mind that
[03:00:49.500 --> 03:00:53.700]  half of trailing after him relates to the exotic technology.
[03:00:53.700 --> 03:00:55.020]  There's no question about it.
[03:00:55.020 --> 03:00:59.420]  He's alluded to it himself with his references to his uncle over and over again when he's
[03:00:59.420 --> 03:01:00.420]  in interviews.
[03:01:00.420 --> 03:01:05.660]  But he also talks about things like we have invisibility or we have flying cars and things
[03:01:05.660 --> 03:01:06.660]  of this nature.
[03:01:06.660 --> 03:01:07.660]  Oh, he said it at his inauguration.
[03:01:07.660 --> 03:01:08.660]  I'm going to interrupt.
[03:01:08.660 --> 03:01:11.620]  He said, we've got a lot of secret technology and live extension, we're going to release
[03:01:11.620 --> 03:01:12.620]  it.
[03:01:12.620 --> 03:01:13.620]  Exactly.
[03:01:13.620 --> 03:01:14.620]  Right.
[03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:17.540]  So here he is coming out and saying that.
[03:01:17.540 --> 03:01:22.980]  Space Force, also a gigantic indication that this is a guy who wants to pull for the first
[03:01:22.980 --> 03:01:27.500]  time since JFK, the UFO file back under the presidency.
[03:01:27.500 --> 03:01:32.700]  When Reagan tried to do that, they used it for SDI, but it was a little bit different.
[03:01:32.700 --> 03:01:34.580]  I think in Trump's case, he's very knowledgeable.
[03:01:34.580 --> 03:01:40.100]  I mean, I understand the traditional story about Trump is he was the real estate billionaire
[03:01:40.100 --> 03:01:44.740]  who had a good attitude about America, and he came on the scene and tossed over the
[03:01:44.740 --> 03:01:45.860]  tables and stuff.
[03:01:45.860 --> 03:01:47.460]  That's partly true.
[03:01:47.460 --> 03:01:51.020]  But his connections with Roy Cohn, that goes really deep.
[03:01:51.020 --> 03:01:52.020]  And Roy Cohn basically ran.
[03:01:52.020 --> 03:01:55.700]  Yeah, Roy Cohn was at the top of the anti-communist deal, hooked into Eisenhower.
[03:01:55.700 --> 03:01:57.620]  Why do they hate Trump so much?
[03:01:57.620 --> 03:02:00.260]  Or is it a psyop to make us love him more?
[03:02:00.260 --> 03:02:02.700]  Well, see, you have to.
[03:02:02.700 --> 03:02:08.500]  Yeah, I like that level that you think on because they love the opposites and they love setting
[03:02:08.500 --> 03:02:11.740]  off these patterns of people facing off against each other.
[03:02:11.740 --> 03:02:15.740]  They'll use the archetype, whether it's really in the person or not.
[03:02:15.740 --> 03:02:18.780]  So they'll say over here, you know, you've got Trump.
[03:02:18.780 --> 03:02:20.700]  Everyone on the liberal side loves to hate him.
[03:02:20.700 --> 03:02:24.140]  And over here you have Biden and everyone on the conservative side.
[03:02:24.140 --> 03:02:27.940]  It's very easy to skewer this insane man wobbling around.
[03:02:27.940 --> 03:02:32.980]  And you know, the only thing he seems to be concerned about basically is, you know, trans
[03:02:32.980 --> 03:02:34.740]  in the military.
[03:02:34.740 --> 03:02:38.380]  And he doesn't have any plan for getting us out of Ukraine.
[03:02:38.380 --> 03:02:39.380]  All the rest of it.
[03:02:39.380 --> 03:02:43.660]  So, you know, they've set up these caricatures for us to face off and vote against.
[03:02:43.660 --> 03:02:47.580]  Ultimately, there's no question that they want division in the United States.
[03:02:47.580 --> 03:02:54.460]  And in my opinion, they want to get to an emergency situation so they can have General Van Hurk
[03:02:54.460 --> 03:02:57.860]  in continuity of government from North Com take over.
[03:02:57.860 --> 03:02:59.300]  That's what they're looking for.
[03:02:59.300 --> 03:03:03.540]  And I don't think they want to do it with something as messy as nuclear interactions.
[03:03:03.540 --> 03:03:06.460]  I think they want to pull the UFO false flag.
[03:03:06.460 --> 03:03:08.980]  That's the one that they've been creating in the background for a decade.
[03:03:08.980 --> 03:03:09.980]  And I totally agree.
[03:03:09.980 --> 03:03:12.820]  And they're definitely thinking about playing the card.
[03:03:12.820 --> 03:03:16.100]  So now they've taken it out of the freezer and are warming it up and getting it ready
[03:03:16.100 --> 03:03:17.100]  to serve.
[03:03:17.100 --> 03:03:18.100]  Doesn't mean they're going to serve it.
[03:03:18.100 --> 03:03:19.340]  But I think they're really thinking about it.
[03:03:19.340 --> 03:03:21.060]  Is that what you're saying?
[03:03:21.060 --> 03:03:24.580]  There's no question if if we weren't talking about it and pushing back against it, they'd
[03:03:24.580 --> 03:03:25.860]  be a lot closer to it.
[03:03:25.860 --> 03:03:30.100]  But look, in the last four weeks, they've had NASA UFO hearings.
[03:03:30.100 --> 03:03:35.340]  They've had Gary Nolan's big friend of Fauci going out and saying, yeah, we have alien
[03:03:35.340 --> 03:03:36.340]  bodies.
[03:03:37.220 --> 03:03:39.940]  He's an immunologist who's deep in this UFO thing.
[03:03:39.940 --> 03:03:45.140]  And how'd you like to have Dr. Fauci mixing with your UFO file research?
[03:03:45.140 --> 03:03:47.220]  So, you know, we're getting into some weird territory.
[03:03:47.220 --> 03:03:52.940]  And then you have this guy, Grush, and that's all Intel for the UFO file.
[03:03:52.940 --> 03:03:55.380]  And then you have the Las Vegas beings walking around.
[03:03:55.380 --> 03:03:57.540]  I mean, that's a lot for three weeks.
[03:03:57.540 --> 03:04:00.660]  Oh, you know, we're definitely in the thick of it right now.
[03:04:00.660 --> 03:04:03.340]  And they're on the UFO threat overdrive.
[03:04:03.340 --> 03:04:04.340]  Their whole thing.
[03:04:04.340 --> 03:04:06.300]  You know, the street legend was Blue Beam.
[03:04:06.300 --> 03:04:10.060]  The real thing is the takeover with the UFO threat.
[03:04:10.060 --> 03:04:11.700]  And that includes continuity of government.
[03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:16.620]  And they've got more hearings with this whistleblower coming out who says he's the first time an
[03:04:16.620 --> 03:04:19.380]  Intel officer is exposed that there's bodies and crap.
[03:04:19.380 --> 03:04:23.900]  But like you said, Corso and all these others have come out and said that it's actually
[03:04:23.900 --> 03:04:24.900]  right there.
[03:04:24.900 --> 03:04:25.900]  That's not true.
[03:04:25.900 --> 03:04:26.900]  It's always the exact same story.
[03:04:26.900 --> 03:04:28.980]  Ten cans, little green men.
[03:04:28.980 --> 03:04:29.980]  Exactly.
[03:04:29.980 --> 03:04:30.980]  Yeah.
[03:04:30.980 --> 03:04:33.260]  And that's what he needs to do.
[03:04:33.260 --> 03:04:37.860]  He needs to come forward and say, you know, oh, you know, the traditional line, I'm breaking
[03:04:37.860 --> 03:04:38.860]  the silence.
[03:04:38.860 --> 03:04:39.860]  I'm a whistleblower.
[03:04:39.860 --> 03:04:46.100]  Well, if you're such a whistleblower, why is the I.G. the actual counsel for the inspector
[03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:47.460]  general defending you?
[03:04:47.460 --> 03:04:48.460]  Why is he your lawyer?
[03:04:48.460 --> 03:04:51.100]  He's calling it urgent and real.
[03:04:51.100 --> 03:04:52.100]  Great point.
[03:04:52.100 --> 03:04:53.100]  Stark Journalist.
[03:04:53.100 --> 03:04:54.100]  Starkjournalist.com.
[03:04:54.100 --> 03:04:55.100]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:55.100 --> 03:04:56.100]  Jay Dyer takes over.
[03:04:56.100 --> 03:04:57.100]  Stay with us.
[03:04:57.780 --> 03:05:03.700]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[03:05:03.700 --> 03:05:05.060]  supply.
[03:05:05.060 --> 03:05:09.660]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:05:09.660 --> 03:05:13.860]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:05:13.860 --> 03:05:16.700]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:05:16.700 --> 03:05:20.020]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:05:20.020 --> 03:05:25.240]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:05:25.240 --> 03:05:28.520]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:05:28.520 --> 03:05:33.280]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[03:05:33.280 --> 03:05:39.880]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our InfoWars
[03:05:39.880 --> 03:05:44.760]  Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:05:44.760 --> 03:05:50.920]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[03:21:55.400 --> 03:22:00.600]  So when you had this experience on the tour bus, how long ago was this? Was this recent or a few
[03:22:00.600 --> 03:22:06.120]  years ago? When was this? This was a few years ago. I prayed the prayer. The next day, the next
[03:22:06.120 --> 03:22:11.720]  evening, this happened. And my sound guy and I looked at each other like, what just happened?
[03:22:11.720 --> 03:22:17.640]  You know, and that was the day I was convinced God was real. But I didn't. That was just kind
[03:22:17.640 --> 03:22:22.840]  of him opening the door, I guess, and revealing himself to me. And then it was a journey of
[03:22:22.840 --> 03:22:27.640]  discovering, you know, getting born again, getting baptized, receiving the Holy Spirit,
[03:22:27.640 --> 03:22:33.560]  having the eyes to see, getting deliverance, getting healed. And, you know, I'm still a baby,
[03:22:33.560 --> 03:22:36.840]  and it's just like kind of a journey with Jesus. We're walking hand in hand.
[03:22:37.720 --> 03:22:43.240]  But I wanted to share this story because this is a real thing that happens to people. And
[03:22:43.240 --> 03:22:49.480]  no, it didn't happen as a child, but it happens to children in horrible ways that you couldn't
[03:22:49.480 --> 03:22:58.360]  possibly imagine. And so I think that the body of Christ needs to get curious about deliverance.
[03:22:58.600 --> 03:23:07.200]  Now, yeah, so when this occurred, like what before this event, like what was your attitude
[03:23:07.200 --> 03:23:12.600]  towards, you know, the divine or things transcended? Do you think there was no God or maybe there's
[03:23:12.600 --> 03:23:15.160]  a God or like, what was your attitude?
[03:23:15.160 --> 03:23:20.400]  Maybe I wasn't sure, you know, I was always one thing I was always searching for was the
[03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:27.160]  truth. And I definitely had an awakening in my early 20s. Thanks to David Ike. Actually,
[03:23:27.160 --> 03:23:31.160]  I mean, his material was so insane that it was the only thing that made sense to me. And
[03:23:31.160 --> 03:23:37.160]  I, I was blown away that I knew chemtrails were real, but yet nobody seemed to want to
[03:23:37.160 --> 03:23:42.520]  acknowledge it, things like that. So I had an awakening then, but then I went back to
[03:23:42.520 --> 03:23:47.640]  sleep. We're being bombarded on all sides by all these things to put us to sleep, to
[03:23:47.640 --> 03:23:53.200]  keep us stupid, to keep us sick. And I went back to sleep, but you know, that's, that's
[03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:59.120]  just like expert level gaslighting when you have the spring in the sky and you can see
[03:23:59.120 --> 03:24:03.600]  it with your eyes and Google's telling you that it's a conspiracy theory. And as someone
[03:24:03.600 --> 03:24:11.000]  who's a survivor of, of SRA and narcissistic abuse. Now, when that happens, my fire alarms,
[03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:16.440]  my internal alarms just go off. So it's, I guess it's good that I went through those
[03:24:16.440 --> 03:24:22.560]  things and came out the other side because now I'm a weapon against this. And I told the
[03:24:22.560 --> 03:24:27.960]  Lord, just use me as a, you know, just use me to blow up the enemy's camp. I'm just sick
[03:24:27.960 --> 03:24:29.000]  of it. Let's go.
[03:24:31.080 --> 03:24:36.920]  Did you, um, you said that you kind of had an awareness of some of these elements of
[03:24:36.920 --> 03:24:41.000]  the new world order and what was going on. Was that prior to the conversion experience
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:45.760]  or was it the conversion experience? And then you really saw the, how this battle that ran
[03:24:45.760 --> 03:24:49.120]  isn't just a geopolitical thing. It's also a spiritual thing. Is that what you're saying?
[03:24:50.120 --> 03:24:55.160]  Yeah, I saw it and I didn't connect it with the spiritual until I had a spiritual awakening.
[03:24:55.160 --> 03:25:00.840]  And now it's like the whole thing makes sense. Um, and, and I really credit David Ike with
[03:25:00.840 --> 03:25:08.480]  connecting a lot of seemingly unrelated dots, um, and Alex and people who can see and expand
[03:25:08.480 --> 03:25:13.320]  their vision and see the bigger picture. Um, that's, that's something else like, and it,
[03:25:13.320 --> 03:25:16.760]  and when you do have the spirit of truth and the Holy spirit, you are given a level of
[03:25:16.760 --> 03:25:19.280]  discernment. It's undeniable.
[03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:25.040]  Yeah. I mean, absolutely. That's one of the gifts that's mentioned, uh, in, I think the
[03:25:25.040 --> 03:25:30.840]  Corinthians passage. And I'm curious because, you know, right now we're seeing this barrage
[03:25:30.840 --> 03:25:34.960]  of news that deals with aliens and all this kind of nonsense. And I've, I've always
[03:25:34.960 --> 03:25:38.360]  believed that there's a, there's a deep seated deception involved in this alien
[03:25:38.360 --> 03:25:44.000]  phenomenon. You can go back to people involved working with the Pentagon who then came
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:49.040]  out and said, this is actually a mass level deception. Like Jacques Vallee, the famous,
[03:25:49.040 --> 03:25:53.680]  uh, uh, DoD computer scientist guy. He says, this is a malevolent deception. He's not
[03:25:53.680 --> 03:25:57.880]  even a Christian, but he's able to recognize that there is something involved in this.
[03:25:57.880 --> 03:26:02.120]  That's more than just human beings at a manipulation level. There's also something
[03:26:02.120 --> 03:26:06.960]  spiritual going on, but he actually says that the, the, the, the entities involved in
[03:26:06.960 --> 03:26:11.000]  this, uh, they're not extraterrestrial. They're actually terrestrial. They're part of
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:17.320]  this planet. Uh, and they are involved in a mass deception to steer in a social
[03:26:17.320 --> 03:26:21.840]  engineering way, human beings into some kind of world government or something like
[03:26:21.840 --> 03:26:24.920]  this. Would you agree with that? What's your take on the whole alien phenomenon?
[03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:30.760]  I could definitely see that. I mean, I definitely don't put that past them. Um, I
[03:26:30.760 --> 03:26:35.120]  think it's demonic. I think it's connected. It's beyond my understanding, certainly.
[03:26:35.120 --> 03:26:40.760]  And if you have people in the government kind of leaking this information, um, is
[03:26:40.760 --> 03:26:45.200]  the mainstream talking about it? Probably not. Um, I don't know too much about the
[03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:50.080]  alien thing. I think it's, I believe it was Alistair Crowley that said he had
[03:26:50.080 --> 03:26:55.960]  conjured some entity that said, you know, you call us demons, they call us aliens.
[03:26:55.960 --> 03:26:58.880]  And one day you'll know that it's one in the same, something along those lines. I
[03:26:58.880 --> 03:27:04.040]  don't want to misquote, but, um, I think a lot of the things that seem alien or just
[03:27:04.040 --> 03:27:09.640]  are demonic and they really are not fallen angels bound in cosmic realms. I mean, that
[03:27:09.640 --> 03:27:10.760]  sounds alien to me.
[03:27:12.520 --> 03:27:19.560]  Yeah, no, I think that the element of it that is demonic is, is precisely, you know, it's
[03:27:19.560 --> 03:27:22.760]  a fallen angel situation. That's what I'm saying. It's, I'm not saying it's all, I
[03:27:22.760 --> 03:27:26.280]  think there's multiple things going on, so it's not just, just the government engaging
[03:27:26.280 --> 03:27:30.600]  in black ops. I think there's a real phenomenon that's going on. I'm not saying
[03:27:30.600 --> 03:27:35.160]  every little grainy clip on YouTube is a demonic, but I'm saying that there is an
[03:27:35.160 --> 03:27:40.280]  element by which, for example, if you look at people who've done DMT or people who've
[03:27:40.280 --> 03:27:45.320]  done a lot of acid or the psychonauts like Terrence McKenna or Timothy Leary or John C.
[03:27:45.320 --> 03:27:49.880]  Lilly, when they talk about their trips and when they talk about interacting with these
[03:27:49.880 --> 03:27:52.920]  interdimensional entities, you know, it's the same type of thing that David Ike talks
[03:27:52.920 --> 03:27:57.160]  about that you mentioned. They always say that the message that they've been given
[03:27:57.160 --> 03:28:02.840]  is have a world government. You need to depopulate. You can't run the planet correctly
[03:28:02.840 --> 03:28:08.040]  because you built bombs. And if you just do what we say and you worship us, then you're
[03:28:08.040 --> 03:28:13.720]  going to get the utopia, the kind of a socialist tech utopia. So, I mean, that to me just screams
[03:28:13.720 --> 03:28:18.600]  the demonic. I mean, demons have always engaged in prompting human beings to do the same types
[03:28:18.600 --> 03:28:23.240]  of activities like offer up your firstborn to us, right? You know, this kind of stuff.
[03:28:23.240 --> 03:28:29.400]  So, that's exactly what the entities that are speaking to people are saying. It's no
[03:28:29.400 --> 03:28:35.960]  different than what, I mean, Alex was saying, you know, Ellen Page today, like her process
[03:28:35.960 --> 03:28:40.760]  of hearing a voice telling her to mutilate herself. I mean, to me, that is, again, why
[03:28:40.760 --> 03:28:47.160]  is no one accepting the best explanation for these phenomena is the demonic? What do demons
[03:28:47.160 --> 03:28:50.680]  do? They hate human beings. We're going to go to this break. When we come back, we are
[03:28:50.680 --> 03:28:55.080]  talking to rock and roll star Dorothy. This is The Alex Jones Show. Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:57.000 --> 03:28:59.880]  All I want is your word of mouth and to tell people to tune in to the show and to share

[03:29:57.880 --> 03:30:02.760]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:30:03.320 --> 03:30:06.520]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:30:07.320 --> 03:30:11.400]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:30:12.200 --> 03:30:17.880]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[03:30:17.880 --> 03:30:23.160]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just
[03:30:23.160 --> 03:30:27.560]  incredible. So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:30:28.200 --> 03:30:33.160]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[03:30:33.160 --> 03:30:37.240]  us. I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us. That's wonderful. Keep doing it. But
[03:30:37.800 --> 03:30:42.680]  most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTore.com and you never buy great
[03:30:42.680 --> 03:30:46.440]  products that enrich and empower your life all at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:30:46.440 --> 03:30:50.200]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:30:50.760 --> 03:30:54.280]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com,
[03:30:54.280 --> 03:30:57.000]  our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.

[03:31:58.920 --> 03:32:04.040]  Yeah. So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley. How do I write all the books that I do? Four books with
[03:32:04.040 --> 03:32:08.680]  Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with
[03:32:08.680 --> 03:32:15.480]  Alex Jones? That's because I use RainForce every day. What I always need is I always need
[03:32:15.480 --> 03:32:21.480]  some sort of boost in the morning. And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins. But
[03:32:21.480 --> 03:32:27.960]  the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce. I'll take RainForce
[03:32:27.960 --> 03:32:33.320]  in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the next four or five hours
[03:32:33.320 --> 03:32:38.280]  writing a whole lot of stuff. So it really is true that RainForce is something I use
[03:32:38.280 --> 03:32:42.040]  every day, and it helps me with my writing. All right. We love you. We'll be right back. Get

[03:32:47.240 --> 03:32:51.400]  back with our number two.
[03:32:57.640 --> 03:33:05.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.400 --> 03:33:16.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:33:16.080 --> 03:33:21.480]  I want to remind you, too, that if you want to get deep into that alien nonsense and all
[03:33:21.480 --> 03:33:24.840]  the breakdowns that I've done, if you go to Bandai Video, you can search my name and you'll
[03:33:24.840 --> 03:33:30.760]  find at least four or five different fourth hours that I've done deconstructing the alien
[03:33:30.760 --> 03:33:32.480]  stuff from my vantage point.
[03:33:32.480 --> 03:33:36.960]  You can go to my YouTube channel, Jay Dyer, and you can find the most recent podcast that
[03:33:36.960 --> 03:33:40.560]  we did a couple of days ago, just kind of mocking and making fun of this.
[03:33:40.560 --> 03:33:45.600]  I want to note, too, that if you look at Isaiah 11, there's a really interesting passage.
[03:33:45.600 --> 03:33:50.640]  It's one of the most famous messianic passages predicting the Messiah.
[03:33:50.640 --> 03:33:55.199]  It says, "...shall come forth a root from the rod of Jesse, a flower shall grow out
[03:33:55.199 --> 03:33:56.240]  of his root.
[03:33:56.240 --> 03:33:57.960]  The Spirit of God will rest upon him.
[03:33:57.960 --> 03:34:03.240]  The Spirit of Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Might, Knowledge, Godliness, the Spirit of
[03:34:03.240 --> 03:34:07.240]  the Fear of God shall fill him."
[03:34:07.240 --> 03:34:12.240]  And of course, David being the son of Jesse there, that is a reference to the Davidic
[03:34:12.240 --> 03:34:15.240]  lineage of Jesus the Messiah.
[03:34:15.240 --> 03:34:20.160]  And so we have these spirits that are mentioned, these seven spirits.
[03:34:20.160 --> 03:34:25.080]  And Paul in 1 Corinthians mentions these gifts of the Spirit, and so I'm assuming that that's
[03:34:25.199 --> 03:34:31.720]  where Dorothy got the inspiration for her most recent album a few months ago, which
[03:34:31.720 --> 03:34:33.960]  is Gifts from the Holy Ghost, right?
[03:34:33.960 --> 03:34:35.560]  I think so.
[03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:40.359]  I actually named the album before I had ever opened the Bible.
[03:34:40.359 --> 03:34:44.119]  I feel like God can give you downloads, and this happened.
[03:34:44.119 --> 03:34:46.440]  I woke up in my hotel room in New York City.
[03:34:46.440 --> 03:34:48.800]  I was writing and recording the record.
[03:34:48.800 --> 03:34:51.520]  I woke up, and the first thing I heard was Gifts from the Holy Ghost.
[03:34:51.520 --> 03:34:56.000]  I wrote it down, and I didn't know what the gifts from the Holy Spirit were, what the
[03:34:56.000 --> 03:34:58.640]  fruits of the Holy Spirit were.
[03:34:58.640 --> 03:35:01.240]  Church made me nervous, you know.
[03:35:01.240 --> 03:35:04.440]  So I wrote it down, and I thought, that sounds like a great album title.
[03:35:04.440 --> 03:35:11.199]  I finished the last song, Gifts from the Holy Ghost, which I feel has very rich spiritual
[03:35:11.199 --> 03:35:12.720]  messaging.
[03:35:12.720 --> 03:35:16.320]  And there it was, and I ended up getting saved after that.
[03:35:16.320 --> 03:35:21.480]  So God's really funny with his perfect divine timing of doing things so that you know it's
[03:35:21.480 --> 03:35:21.980]  him.
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:32.640]  Absolutely, Divine Providence is what I think, you know, before I got into this worldview,
[03:35:32.640 --> 03:35:35.080]  you tend to see things as synchronicity, right?
[03:35:35.080 --> 03:35:39.320]  Let's like Carl Jung's synchronicity, but then you start to realize, well, synchronicity
[03:35:39.320 --> 03:35:43.200]  doesn't really make sense if it's like coming from my psyche, right?
[03:35:43.200 --> 03:35:45.320]  That's what the way Carl Jung pictures it all.
[03:35:45.320 --> 03:35:49.640]  It's like even as an essay where he talks about UFOs and he says, oh, the UFOs are
[03:35:49.640 --> 03:35:52.280]  a manifestation of our unconscious, right?
[03:35:52.280 --> 03:35:56.760]  But that doesn't really make sense because it's not our unconscious that's manifesting
[03:35:56.760 --> 03:35:57.760]  these things.
[03:35:57.760 --> 03:36:02.600]  There is a divine mind, a divine consciousness, you could say, and that makes sense for how
[03:36:02.600 --> 03:36:07.720]  reality can be organized via Divine Providence, by our free will working together with Divine
[03:36:07.720 --> 03:36:08.720]  Providence.
[03:36:08.720 --> 03:36:12.840]  To me, that makes a lot more sense in this idea that our psyche manifests it like Carl
[03:36:12.840 --> 03:36:13.840]  Jung says.
[03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:21.320]  Yeah, I think that on the notion of spiritual warfare, too, and we didn't really mention
[03:36:21.320 --> 03:36:26.840]  this in the pre-interview discussion, but, you know, I'm Orthodox and it's ironic because
[03:36:26.840 --> 03:36:32.920]  only as to my knowledge, only the Orthodox Church still does the ancient form of exorcism
[03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:33.920]  at baptism.
[03:36:33.920 --> 03:36:39.280]  So in the early church, they would actually do a ritual of exorcism as part of the baptismal
[03:36:39.280 --> 03:36:40.280]  ritual.
[03:36:40.840 --> 03:36:44.600]  I'm not knocking, you know, your conversion or anything like that.
[03:36:44.600 --> 03:36:49.120]  I'm just saying that one of the reasons I found Orthodoxy appealing was that when you
[03:36:49.120 --> 03:36:53.120]  look into the history of the church, you have this ancient baptismal rite and they would
[03:36:53.120 --> 03:36:57.880]  always include the ritual of exorcism as part of baptism.
[03:36:57.880 --> 03:37:02.520]  And to me, that suggests that, you know, the church has to have this notion of the reality
[03:37:02.520 --> 03:37:03.520]  of spiritual warfare.
[03:37:03.520 --> 03:37:10.800]  And a lot of the Orthodox hymnography, a lot of the chants that we sing, they're rife with
[03:37:10.800 --> 03:37:14.720]  this notion of spiritual warfare and battling the demonic realm.
[03:37:14.720 --> 03:37:18.960]  And I think that that's an element that I'm not personally charismatic, obviously, but
[03:37:18.960 --> 03:37:22.160]  a lot of charismatics get that element correct.
[03:37:22.160 --> 03:37:26.000]  Like they realize there is a reality to spiritual warfare and some charismatics can go crazy
[03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:27.000]  with this.
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:31.640]  But a lot of it might be a lot of the Protestant churches kind of have a fractured element
[03:37:31.760 --> 03:37:35.000]  where they, like different ones have pieces of truth, right?
[03:37:35.000 --> 03:37:38.680]  But I think that if we understand the notion of authority, if we understand the notion
[03:37:38.680 --> 03:37:43.800]  of the church possessing this power, you know, Jesus said, you will do these things.
[03:37:43.800 --> 03:37:47.000]  You will cast out demons, he says to the apostles in Luke, right?
[03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:51.320]  And he says, I've given you authority over the scorpions, over all the enemy and so forth.
[03:37:51.320 --> 03:37:56.760]  So I appreciate that, you know, you've incorporated that into your music and into your worldview
[03:37:56.760 --> 03:37:58.680]  about how you approach writing.
[03:37:58.680 --> 03:38:01.880]  Do you find that to be difficult when you write with the people that you write with?
[03:38:01.880 --> 03:38:05.960]  Because you just have this big thing drop what, I know you've got your album, which
[03:38:05.960 --> 03:38:10.280]  is out some months ago, but you have a new song that just dropped with Nita, right?
[03:38:10.280 --> 03:38:15.680]  Yes, Nita Strauss, Victorious, fellow believer.
[03:38:15.680 --> 03:38:20.200]  And we wanted a very empowering song that was going to encourage young women.
[03:38:20.200 --> 03:38:21.600]  I think we accomplished that.
[03:38:21.600 --> 03:38:24.920]  So yeah, her and I talk about this.
[03:38:24.920 --> 03:38:25.920]  It's true.
[03:38:25.920 --> 03:38:27.560]  Spiritual warfare is a real thing.
[03:38:27.560 --> 03:38:31.600]  Believers have been given authority by Jesus, and a lot of them don't know their authority
[03:38:31.600 --> 03:38:34.040]  and the enemy will hammer them.
[03:38:34.040 --> 03:38:36.720]  And it's so obvious because the devil never has any new tricks.
[03:38:36.720 --> 03:38:40.120]  I mean, it's always before a big interview or before some big blessing.
[03:38:40.120 --> 03:38:45.440]  And if you can just nail your flesh to the cross, so to speak, and not react to the
[03:38:45.440 --> 03:38:49.280]  flesh and pick up your tools, go into praise and worship.
[03:38:49.280 --> 03:38:53.000]  Use the word of God, which is the sword of the Spirit.
[03:38:53.000 --> 03:38:55.960]  Command that enemy to leave you in the name of Jesus.
[03:38:55.960 --> 03:39:00.920]  Command those spirits, Jezebel, whoever's attacking you, to go in Jesus' name.
[03:39:00.920 --> 03:39:05.520]  And if you know your authority and you've been given it by Jesus, they have to obey
[03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:06.520]  you.
[03:39:06.520 --> 03:39:10.520]  And yeah, of course, the devil wants you to worship him, but he hates humans.
[03:39:10.520 --> 03:39:11.640]  He hates us.
[03:39:11.640 --> 03:39:15.960]  So why would you worship something that hates us, that wants to see your demise and your
[03:39:15.960 --> 03:39:16.960]  destruction?
[03:39:16.960 --> 03:39:21.640]  I mean, that sounds like, you know, masochism to me.
[03:39:21.640 --> 03:39:23.520]  That's a really good point.
[03:39:23.520 --> 03:39:27.880]  I think that a lot of times people that are getting more and more serious about their
[03:39:27.880 --> 03:39:32.360]  Satanism, for example, they actually do get into harming themselves.
[03:39:32.360 --> 03:39:38.160]  You know, if you go back to the Old Testament, when not just the fall, when Jesus says that
[03:39:38.160 --> 03:39:40.400]  Satan was the first thief and liar, right?
[03:39:40.400 --> 03:39:41.400]  He lied.
[03:39:41.400 --> 03:39:42.960]  He stole man's life.
[03:39:42.960 --> 03:39:44.800]  That was what he did in the garden.
[03:39:44.800 --> 03:39:50.240]  If you fast forward to the time of Elijah, when he's dealing with the prophets of Baal,
[03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:54.040]  when they're on the mountain having that spiritual confrontation, what is it that the prophets
[03:39:54.040 --> 03:39:55.560]  of Baal are doing?
[03:39:55.560 --> 03:40:01.760]  They're cutting themselves and they're trying to invoke Baal, Baalzebub, right?
[03:40:01.760 --> 03:40:08.360]  By cutting themselves, self-harm, and the release of the blood and whatnot, they thought
[03:40:08.360 --> 03:40:11.600]  would bring this entity, that would bring this power to them.
[03:40:11.600 --> 03:40:12.600]  And it didn't.
[03:40:12.600 --> 03:40:14.360]  Nothing happened, right?
[03:40:14.360 --> 03:40:16.200]  It only harmed them.
[03:40:16.200 --> 03:40:21.280]  And if you look at other instances in Scripture, for example, where we see people who are mentioned
[03:40:21.280 --> 03:40:24.600]  committing suicide, there's only a few of these in Scripture.
[03:40:24.600 --> 03:40:29.920]  There's Judas and there's Saul, and in both cases, Judas and Saul were specifically said
[03:40:29.920 --> 03:40:33.240]  to be possessed in, I guess, different degrees.
[03:40:33.240 --> 03:40:38.160]  I think Judas was a lot more possessed than Saul was, but both of those guys killed themselves.
[03:40:38.160 --> 03:40:44.080]  So we have two instances in Scripture of suicide, and in both cases, the people were specifically
[03:40:44.080 --> 03:40:45.920]  demonically possessed.
[03:40:45.920 --> 03:40:51.640]  So the theme here that I'm getting at is that every time we see this manifestation in
[03:40:51.640 --> 03:40:55.080]  Scripture of the presence of the demonic, it's always self-harm.
[03:40:55.080 --> 03:40:59.800]  Remember the guy in the tombs, when Jesus cast out the demon, the guy wandering in the
[03:40:59.800 --> 03:41:04.280]  tombs, it says that he kept throwing himself into the fire and trying to kill himself.
[03:41:04.280 --> 03:41:09.240]  So every time suicide appears, it's always in the presence of the demonic, and that to
[03:41:09.240 --> 03:41:15.160]  me suggests that self-harm, mutilating oneself, this is very relevant for a lot of what's
[03:41:15.160 --> 03:41:17.560]  going on in our culture right now.
[03:41:17.560 --> 03:41:23.200]  It has a spiritual root, it's not just bad ideology, it's a spiritual problem, and until
[03:41:23.200 --> 03:41:27.560]  we address the spiritual problem, the problems can't be fixed.
[03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:30.160]  You can't fix these things with politics.
[03:41:30.160 --> 03:41:31.160]  What do you think?
[03:41:31.160 --> 03:41:35.160]  Well, yeah, and I want to point out that the blood covenants, the drinking of the blood
[03:41:35.160 --> 03:41:40.160]  in Hollywood, the cutting, the releasing of blood, blood is the highest currency in the
[03:41:40.160 --> 03:41:41.960]  spirit realm.
[03:41:41.960 --> 03:41:48.120]  That's why Jesus gave his blood for us and made a mockery of Satan and disarmed him and
[03:41:48.120 --> 03:41:49.920]  defeated him and took the keys back.
[03:41:49.920 --> 03:41:51.600]  It was the power in the blood.
[03:41:51.600 --> 03:41:59.120]  The reason is that blood is the highest currency in the spirit realm.
[03:41:59.120 --> 03:42:02.040]  It's definitely demonic when you hear voices telling you to cut yourself.
[03:42:02.040 --> 03:42:07.600]  I would suggest getting some deliverance and coming to know God, because he can set you
[03:42:07.600 --> 03:42:09.640]  free from all that.
[03:42:09.640 --> 03:42:14.480]  You could have sold your soul to Satan himself or have it embedded in your bloodline and
[03:42:14.480 --> 03:42:16.240]  still be set free.
[03:42:16.240 --> 03:42:17.360]  Satan doesn't own your soul.
[03:42:17.360 --> 03:42:18.880]  He doesn't have any right to it.
[03:42:18.880 --> 03:42:20.800]  He has no authority over it.
[03:42:20.800 --> 03:42:25.320]  God does, and God's name is literally printed on your DNA.
[03:42:25.320 --> 03:42:26.880]  I think that settles that.
[03:42:26.880 --> 03:42:32.000]  I want to remind everybody that they can follow you.
[03:42:32.000 --> 03:42:36.440]  We still got another segment after this, but they can follow you over on your channel at
[03:42:36.440 --> 03:42:37.440]  Dorothy.
[03:42:37.440 --> 03:42:42.440]  You can check out the new album, Gifts from the Holy Ghost, relatively new, past few months.
[03:42:42.440 --> 03:42:46.280]  And then your new song with Nita is on, I think, her channel.
[03:42:46.280 --> 03:42:49.320]  And they can follow you on Instagram as well, right?
[03:42:49.320 --> 03:42:50.320]  Right.
[03:42:50.320 --> 03:42:51.320]  Just add Dorothy.
[03:42:51.320 --> 03:42:52.320]  I got lucky.
[03:42:52.320 --> 03:42:53.320]  I got the handle.
[03:42:53.320 --> 03:42:54.320]  Nice.
[03:42:54.320 --> 03:42:55.320]  This is the...
[03:42:55.320 --> 03:42:56.320]  You wanted to plug Rainforce.
[03:42:56.320 --> 03:42:57.320]  Do you like Rainforce?
[03:42:57.320 --> 03:42:58.320]  Yeah.
[03:42:58.320 --> 03:42:59.320]  Yeah.
[03:42:59.320 --> 03:43:00.320]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[03:43:00.320 --> 03:43:04.040]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:43:04.040 --> 03:43:08.000]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:10.360]  and now two books with Alex Jones.
[03:43:10.360 --> 03:43:13.680]  That's because I use Rainforce every day.
[03:43:13.680 --> 03:43:17.600]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:43:17.600 --> 03:43:23.280]  And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins, but the one thing that I have really
[03:43:23.280 --> 03:43:27.000]  found that makes a difference is Rainforce.
[03:43:27.000 --> 03:43:32.080]  I'll take Rainforce in the morning, right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the
[03:43:32.080 --> 03:43:33.920]  next four or five hours.
[03:43:33.920 --> 03:43:34.920]  I'm not writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:43:34.920 --> 03:43:40.520]  So it really is true that Rainforce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[03:43:40.520 --> 03:43:41.520]  All right.
[03:43:41.520 --> 03:43:42.520]  We love you.
[03:43:42.520 --> 03:43:43.520]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:43.520 --> 03:43:46.960]  Get your Rainforce Plus, Rainforce Ultra, and Turbo Force at infowarstore.com.
[03:43:46.960 --> 03:44:02.240]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[03:44:02.240 --> 03:44:03.680]  I want to say Rainforce is great.
[03:44:04.440 --> 03:44:05.440]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[03:44:05.440 --> 03:44:06.440]  It is.
[03:44:06.440 --> 03:44:11.120]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:44:11.120 --> 03:44:14.360]  The fish oil's better than it, and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:44:14.360 --> 03:44:20.040]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:44:20.040 --> 03:44:23.600]  Krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry.
[03:44:23.600 --> 03:44:24.600]  You want something like this?
[03:44:24.600 --> 03:44:25.600]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:44:25.600 --> 03:44:26.600]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:44:26.600 --> 03:44:27.600]  It's so good, in my view.
[03:44:27.600 --> 03:44:30.840]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:44:30.840 --> 03:44:37.120]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:44:37.120 --> 03:44:44.640]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:44:44.640 --> 03:44:48.080]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever
[03:44:48.080 --> 03:44:50.480]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:44:50.480 --> 03:44:51.480]  I just can't do it.

[03:46:21.120 --> 03:46:22.880]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:46:22.880 --> 03:46:28.320]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[03:46:28.320 --> 03:46:33.560]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[03:46:33.560 --> 03:46:34.560]  it.

[03:46:39.360 --> 03:46:40.360]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[03:46:40.360 --> 03:46:41.360]  They're two different nootropics.
[03:46:41.360 --> 03:46:45.240]  They go good with this, but this is the king kong.
[03:46:45.240 --> 03:46:46.640]  This is the boss.

[03:46:57.720 --> 03:47:03.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.300 --> 03:47:16.580]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:47:16.580 --> 03:47:24.179]  I want to remind you that if you are in the L.A. Hollywood area, we will be live in L.A.
[03:47:24.179 --> 03:47:31.179]  July 6th with Jamie Kennedy, yes, Jamie Kennedy from the Jamie Kennedy Experiment, from Malibu's
[03:47:31.179 --> 03:47:39.460]  Most Wanted, from Scream, Randy Meeks in person, how would you not want to be there for that?
[03:47:39.460 --> 03:47:41.900]  It's a blast, our live events are the bomb.
[03:47:41.900 --> 03:47:46.119]  If you don't know, it's more like a five-hour party at our live events.
[03:47:46.119 --> 03:47:52.019]  We do comedy, we do impressions, we do serious stuff, we actually get into a lot of real
[03:47:52.019 --> 03:47:53.740]  hardcore information.
[03:47:53.740 --> 03:47:57.980]  My wife will be doing a discussion on esoteric Hollywood, which you guys know I have two
[03:47:57.980 --> 03:48:03.779]  books on that, and I will be doing a presentation on my new book, Metanarratives, the essays
[03:48:03.779 --> 03:48:09.460]  on philosophy and symbolism, so I'll be covering a lot of philosophical topics, as well as
[03:48:09.460 --> 03:48:15.619]  doing a lot of ridiculous nonsense, and as you guys may or may not have seen, I performed
[03:48:15.619 --> 03:48:21.420]  my first Cringecore song live last weekend at Courtney Turner's event, and so the crowd
[03:48:21.420 --> 03:48:26.140]  got trolled, they didn't know what they were going to get, and they actually got a live
[03:48:26.259 --> 03:48:32.859]  version of my Matthew McConaughey song, pure cringe, pure live, and I might actually do
[03:48:32.859 --> 03:48:36.820]  quite a few of those if you come to the L.A. event, as well as serious stuff, so if you
[03:48:36.820 --> 03:48:40.859]  head on over to my website, JasonAlsace.com, you'll see under every post there is the
[03:48:40.859 --> 03:48:49.980]  link of the live events, get your ticket to the July 6th Los Angeles event in the links
[03:48:49.980 --> 03:48:54.460]  there, the Eventbrite links, it's going to be a lot of fun, and then of course Jamie will
[03:48:55.380 --> 03:48:59.900]  be the headliner doing some stand-up, and you can also get on over to his merch table
[03:48:59.900 --> 03:49:04.699]  and meet him and get a few pics with him, he's a great dude, very cool.
[03:49:04.699 --> 03:49:09.019]  Let's get back to this notion of spiritual warfare, I think again, think about what we're
[03:49:09.019 --> 03:49:16.820]  told with alien nonsense, aliens are these inter-dimensional entities, the message is
[03:49:16.820 --> 03:49:24.420]  always that if you just have a world government, if you just worship us, if you just depopulate,
[03:49:24.420 --> 03:49:28.420]  we'll give you solutions, we'll give you advanced technology, this is the message of
[03:49:28.420 --> 03:49:29.420]  Childhood Zen.
[03:49:29.420 --> 03:49:36.900]  Remember Arthur C. Clarke was himself a confessed Krolian, a confessed Luciferian, he had some
[03:49:36.900 --> 03:49:42.859]  weird predilections in terms of the pedo stuff, as Alex just talked about this week, and in
[03:49:42.859 --> 03:49:50.980]  his book he actually writes that Karelian, the overlord, is a freaking demon, he's got
[03:49:50.980 --> 03:49:57.580]  hooves, he looks like a giant demon, and people can't figure this out, the soy nerds
[03:49:57.580 --> 03:50:02.460]  are out there like, oh it's science, oh they're advanced from another civilization, and they're
[03:50:02.460 --> 03:50:07.820]  gonna bring me a coon pod and I can just have fun forever, oh it's gonna be so great, no,
[03:50:07.820 --> 03:50:11.699]  it's a demon dummy, it even looks like a freaking demon and you can't tell it's a demon, come
[03:50:11.699 --> 03:50:17.720]  on now, come on, what is wrong with you people?
[03:50:17.720 --> 03:50:23.000]  It's a massive deception, now in scripture we have this story early on in Genesis, it's
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:28.439]  implicit in Genesis and then it's explained later on by chapter 3 and then as the text
[03:50:28.439 --> 03:50:34.880]  progresses we get the story of, before man's fall there was another fall, did you know there
[03:50:34.880 --> 03:50:38.679]  was another fall before man fell?
[03:50:38.679 --> 03:50:45.640]  That was the angelic fall, and that angelic fall happened outside of time and space, outside
[03:50:45.640 --> 03:50:51.320]  of the normal phase of human experience of time, it happened in the spiritual realm,
[03:50:51.320 --> 03:50:55.859]  the aeon is what the church fathers called it, and so the angels, because they don't
[03:50:55.859 --> 03:51:02.000]  exist in time like humans do, they were tested at once, and outside of time when they fell
[03:51:02.000 --> 03:51:09.199]  it was an instantaneous fall, and angels from every one of those ranks of the nine choirs
[03:51:09.199 --> 03:51:15.800]  that are listed in the various texts of scripture, fell, John says that one third of the angels
[03:51:15.800 --> 03:51:21.920]  fell with Satan, and so they launched into this rebellion against God and against humankind,
[03:51:21.920 --> 03:51:25.080]  as Dorothy said, they hate humans, why?
[03:51:25.080 --> 03:51:29.119]  Well in orthodox theology we understand that they hate human beings because humans are
[03:51:29.119 --> 03:51:34.960]  made not just in the image of God but also to be raised as Paul says above the angels,
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:42.160]  so there's a fundamental envy that Satan and his hosts had against man because man was
[03:51:42.160 --> 03:51:48.599]  made in the image of the Logos, in our view in the garden it's man that's walking around
[03:51:48.599 --> 03:51:56.039]  with the Logos, with the pre-incarnate Christ, man is made in the image of Christ, Adam,
[03:51:56.039 --> 03:52:03.560]  Paul says Adam is after the image of Christ in his letters, so it's a more specific notion
[03:52:03.560 --> 03:52:06.960]  of being made in the image of God, not just in the image of the Trinity but also in the
[03:52:06.960 --> 03:52:13.160]  image of the Logos, the pre-incarnate Logos who would then become incarnate, so man himself
[03:52:13.160 --> 03:52:17.720]  in the garden is kind of a prefiguring, a foreshadowing of the incarnation.
[03:52:17.800 --> 03:52:28.119]  And thus, Satan's hatred of humankind results from this envy and desire to destroy the thing
[03:52:28.119 --> 03:52:31.359]  that reminds him of his creator, Christ, you see.
[03:52:31.359 --> 03:52:34.679]  In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God.
[03:52:34.679 --> 03:52:36.920]  All things came to be through the Logos.
[03:52:36.920 --> 03:52:39.320]  Christ is the creator, even of Satan.
[03:52:39.320 --> 03:52:46.480]  And so the angelic fall created this race of entities, you could say, angelic race.
[03:52:46.480 --> 03:52:54.199]  Then Dead set on destroying humankind at first until the birth of Christ to destroy and persecute
[03:52:54.199 --> 03:52:58.080]  Israel because Israel would give birth to the Messiah.
[03:52:58.080 --> 03:53:05.080]  And then now the church, to destroy the church because the church is the body of the Messiah
[03:53:05.080 --> 03:53:07.480]  on earth.
[03:53:07.480 --> 03:53:08.480]  Read Isaiah.
[03:53:08.480 --> 03:53:10.480]  Isaiah is the fifth gospel.
[03:53:11.480 --> 03:53:13.480]  So I want to go back to Dorothy.
[03:53:13.480 --> 03:53:16.480]  Dorothy, you were talking about the spiritual warfare.
[03:53:16.480 --> 03:53:22.279]  When you, before you were interested in these topics, before you had your conversion experience,
[03:53:22.279 --> 03:53:23.800]  how did you look upon Christianity?
[03:53:23.800 --> 03:53:28.560]  Did you see it as a bunch of goofballs and goobers that were duped and believed a bunch
[03:53:28.560 --> 03:53:29.920]  of stupid stuff?
[03:53:29.920 --> 03:53:35.720]  Or was it because they didn't talk about the reality of the spiritual warfare and the reality
[03:53:35.720 --> 03:53:37.800]  of what you saw in Hollywood?
[03:53:37.800 --> 03:53:41.320]  Or what was it that, how did you see it before?
[03:53:41.320 --> 03:53:43.400]  I saw it the way the world sees it.
[03:53:43.400 --> 03:53:48.119]  You know, I couldn't, I couldn't sit in church and during worship, it made me cringe.
[03:53:48.119 --> 03:53:53.000]  You know, I, the one or two times I had gone to church, I felt completely uncomfortable
[03:53:53.000 --> 03:53:55.199]  crawling out of my skin.
[03:53:55.199 --> 03:53:59.279]  Probably because I was demonized and they really don't like that, you know.
[03:53:59.279 --> 03:54:06.800]  But when, when you accept Jesus, you give him legal authority over your life and now
[03:54:06.800 --> 03:54:11.000]  you get, the veil comes off and you see the truth.
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:16.279]  And I honestly can't believe I'm sitting here and I'm saying, yes, I read about Jesus and
[03:54:16.279 --> 03:54:20.880]  I talk to Jesus and I pray and I, I know what spiritual warfare is.
[03:54:20.880 --> 03:54:24.679]  I love it when the Satanists say, you know, Satanism is just about self worship.
[03:54:24.679 --> 03:54:25.679]  There's no devil.
[03:54:25.679 --> 03:54:33.359]  Yes, there's a devil and the demons are spirits without bodies, you know.
[03:54:33.359 --> 03:54:35.920]  And those that have the eyes to see, you can see them.
[03:54:36.039 --> 03:54:40.279]  So you're not crazy, body of Christ, you're not, you know, you're not losing it.
[03:54:40.279 --> 03:54:46.679]  You've been given a gift that can be uncomfortable to operate in sometimes, but you're, you know,
[03:54:46.679 --> 03:54:51.400]  we're trying to save as many souls before it's time to go.
[03:54:51.400 --> 03:54:55.400]  And the last thing, one of the last things I wanted to say is no matter what you've done,
[03:54:55.400 --> 03:54:58.039]  you can still get, be saved and get delivered.
[03:54:58.039 --> 03:55:01.000]  And all sin is the same when it's nailed to the cross.
[03:55:01.000 --> 03:55:03.039]  I mean, Paul was murdering Christians, right?
[03:55:03.039 --> 03:55:08.400]  So just remember that when you start to listen to the flaming arrows of the enemy coming
[03:55:08.400 --> 03:55:14.400]  into your mind with the shame and the condemnation and the guilt, the devil will lie to you in
[03:55:14.400 --> 03:55:17.800]  your own voice and the mind is the battlefield.
[03:55:17.800 --> 03:55:21.119]  And if you go into praise and worship, that will break.
[03:55:21.119 --> 03:55:22.119]  That's one tactic.
[03:55:22.119 --> 03:55:24.599]  So it's absolutely real.
[03:55:24.599 --> 03:55:30.199]  And here I am, I would never go back to my life before Jesus for all the money in the
[03:55:30.199 --> 03:55:35.320]  world, for all the fame, for all the dreams, all the fruit that the devil wants to give
[03:55:35.320 --> 03:55:36.320]  you is poison.
[03:55:36.320 --> 03:55:37.320]  It's tainted.
[03:55:37.320 --> 03:55:42.080]  And the demons always come to collect their pound of flesh, you know, and everything he
[03:55:42.080 --> 03:55:44.480]  has is just a sad counterfeit.
[03:55:44.480 --> 03:55:47.359]  And I would never, my life now is just too good.
[03:55:47.359 --> 03:55:49.439]  Serving God is just so fulfilling.
[03:55:49.439 --> 03:55:51.119]  I don't feel alone.
[03:55:51.119 --> 03:55:55.679]  And since everyone is feeling so alone and isolated, and that's just an epidemic in our
[03:55:55.679 --> 03:55:58.640]  world, maybe they need to try God.
[03:55:58.640 --> 03:56:02.400]  Because I have a sense of just being loved and cared for and connected with the body
[03:56:02.400 --> 03:56:03.400]  of Christ.
[03:56:03.400 --> 03:56:06.840]  I will run into people I don't even know, and we will pray together.
[03:56:06.840 --> 03:56:11.880]  And we know that God orchestrated that meeting as a divine appointment that day because someone
[03:56:11.880 --> 03:56:12.880]  needed it.
[03:56:12.880 --> 03:56:14.920]  So it's pretty miraculous and supernatural.
[03:56:14.920 --> 03:56:19.119]  I mean, I serve an awesome God, and I'm still going to play rock and roll.
[03:56:19.119 --> 03:56:22.119]  So it's the best of both worlds.
[03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:29.480]  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, David, multiple people in the Old Testament were skilled musicians.
[03:56:29.480 --> 03:56:31.279]  So, you know, nothing, there's nothing wrong.
[03:56:31.279 --> 03:56:37.800]  The talents that we have are talents given to us by God, you know, to use for that purpose.
[03:56:37.800 --> 03:56:40.039]  So really cool to have you on.
[03:56:40.039 --> 03:56:42.359]  Thank you for giving your testimony, your journey.
[03:56:42.359 --> 03:56:47.320]  I think that people should understand that as things get more insane, as we see more
[03:56:47.320 --> 03:56:51.240]  and more evil, that's actually a call to repentance.
[03:56:51.359 --> 03:56:56.279]  It's a call to noticing that there's objective good, right?
[03:56:56.279 --> 03:57:00.439]  Evil is not a thing that exists or has being in the sense of, you know, everything that
[03:57:00.439 --> 03:57:03.439]  God created, it exists as good.
[03:57:03.439 --> 03:57:06.240]  And what evil does is that it's a privation.
[03:57:06.240 --> 03:57:08.480]  It's a negation against the good.
[03:57:08.480 --> 03:57:10.240]  It's always an act against the good.
[03:57:10.240 --> 03:57:11.240]  That's it.
[03:57:11.240 --> 03:57:12.519]  That's all it ever can be.
[03:57:12.519 --> 03:57:18.240]  And so the more that we see evil in the world, it should wake people up, especially people
[03:57:18.240 --> 03:57:20.720]  who are skeptics or people who don't think that way.
[03:57:20.720 --> 03:57:25.759]  Why is there a commonality amongst all of the ancient empires of the world having this
[03:57:25.759 --> 03:57:31.880]  anti-human agenda where the empires enact the worship of some weird, you know, deity
[03:57:31.880 --> 03:57:37.920]  or ruler or tyrant, Nimrod, Babel, and they require human sacrifice.
[03:57:37.920 --> 03:57:42.920]  If there's objective evil, there's objective good, and that means God exists.
[03:57:42.920 --> 03:57:44.000]  This is The Oxygen Show.
