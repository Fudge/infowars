[00:00.000 --> 00:11.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.800 --> 00:19.360]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.360 --> 00:27.360]  Texas Alex Jones well we knew we had him coming on a couple days ago but I like
[00:27.360 --> 00:31.500]  to surprise the listeners so out of the gates for the first 30 minutes of the
[00:31.500 --> 00:38.240]  live transmission today Lou Dobbs of course syndicated radio host former CNN
[00:38.240 --> 00:42.840]  host host of Lou Dobbs tonight on Fox Business Channel one of their number
[00:42.840 --> 00:48.280]  one programs over there is our guest for the next 30 minutes and I can't wait to
[00:48.280 --> 00:52.840]  pick his brain and get his take on the economy the new war in Libya the
[00:52.840 --> 00:56.580]  inflation who is Glenn Beck's replacement gonna be could it be Lou
[00:56.580 --> 01:00.760]  Dobbs or Andrew Napolitano I hear they're certainly being looked at right
[01:00.760 --> 01:05.240]  now from some of the Fox insiders but we're gonna discuss it all but in this
[01:05.240 --> 01:08.920]  short few minutes we have in this opening segment Lou of all the things
[01:08.920 --> 01:13.640]  going on what do you think is most important in the world today what's
[01:13.640 --> 01:18.480]  number one on your radar screen well number one first of all I'll great to
[01:18.480 --> 01:22.960]  be with you again at the opportunity to talk about these issues but the number
[01:22.960 --> 01:27.200]  one issue as far as I'm concerned right now is restoring the rule of the
[01:27.200 --> 01:31.840]  majority to our government and making certain that's great constitutional
[01:31.840 --> 01:39.240]  Republic is led and conduct itself in concert with our national values and
[01:39.240 --> 01:43.080]  ideals whether we're talking about foreign policy whether we're talking
[01:43.080 --> 01:48.240]  about the wars that are underway in Iraq Afghanistan and Libya or whether
[01:48.240 --> 01:52.560]  we're talking about the how to restore prosperity to this country and to create
[01:52.560 --> 01:57.840]  jobs at wealth and to get this great country moving well when you talk about
[01:57.840 --> 02:02.080]  the Constitution under assault undoubtedly I mean out of the gates
[02:02.080 --> 02:06.840]  going back now four weeks ago the UN comes out and says we have a resolution
[02:06.840 --> 02:12.400]  to stop to start bombing Libya and Obama didn't even the president didn't
[02:12.400 --> 02:16.600]  even consult with Congress at least Bush went and got a resolution for force
[02:16.600 --> 02:22.160]  exactly and by the way is it the man who this president is a candidate accused
[02:22.160 --> 02:27.480]  of being a unilateralist went before the United Nations and got their
[02:27.480 --> 02:32.800]  approval support that cooperation as well as the United States Congress and
[02:32.800 --> 02:39.400]  they did it twice both in Afghanistan and Iraq if you will the the
[02:39.400 --> 02:45.760]  contradiction is stunning on the part of mr. Obama and now it's a stalemate and
[02:45.760 --> 02:49.520]  they say it's not going well so there's more and more discussions by top
[02:49.520 --> 02:54.880]  generals of putting ground troops and not just CIA advisors unfortunately
[02:54.880 --> 02:59.760]  that's exactly right and the military analysts with them I've spoken to and a
[02:59.760 --> 03:05.520]  number of former generals who are very close to to obviously the general
[03:05.520 --> 03:09.960]  staff of the Pentagon same point blank that they cautioned this
[03:09.960 --> 03:16.320]  administration against taking on Omar Gaddafi and opening up hostilities
[03:16.320 --> 03:21.360]  against Libya and now they are cautioning against the ground troops
[03:21.360 --> 03:25.200]  because they have said from the outset that nothing can be assured without our
[03:25.200 --> 03:32.040]  forces on the ground and as we know whether particularly the interests of
[03:32.040 --> 03:39.480]  Afghanistan Alex we know that doesn't assure a timely outcome either no it
[03:39.480 --> 03:43.120]  certainly does it and that's four different major conflicts Pakistan
[03:43.120 --> 03:48.160]  Afghanistan Iraq and now Libya right and we have the French pouring into the
[03:48.160 --> 03:54.280]  Ivory Coast removing one thug and now openly installing the other rebel
[03:54.280 --> 03:57.960]  leader who they admit has been running around with his people with machetes
[03:57.960 --> 04:02.360]  chopping up men women and children the involvement of the French and the
[04:02.360 --> 04:07.600]  Ivory Coast wherever the French have gone over history as you will know they
[04:07.600 --> 04:12.640]  have left independent nations that were former French colonies in horrible
[04:12.640 --> 04:17.120]  shape the Ivory Coast to being exploited by the West for its natural resources
[04:17.120 --> 04:24.760]  most perfect most prominently oil this is a mess and for the one styles that is
[04:24.760 --> 04:29.520]  NATO or the French and the United Kingdom or the United States and NATO or
[04:29.520 --> 04:33.440]  just the United States but somebody needs to take a very deep breath and say
[04:33.440 --> 04:40.040]  wait a minute is this who America is is this who Americans are is this the
[04:40.040 --> 04:45.760]  nation that we want to be and I think most Americans would say absolutely not
[04:45.760 --> 04:50.280]  absolutely the polls show that Lou Dobbs host the Lou Dobbs night on Fox
[04:50.280 --> 04:54.320]  Business Network Lou Dobbs.com will be right back with him to continue along
[04:54.320 --> 05:02.200]  this important line of discussion these UN wars stay with us hi folks this is

[06:06.280 --> 06:12.920]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[06:17.040 --> 06:26.480]  it is Friday the 15th of April 2011 and we've got a real treat as far as those
[06:26.480 --> 06:30.680]  that want to know what's really happening in the world with a wide breadth of
[06:30.680 --> 06:35.960]  analysis on the economy geopolitical developments he was one of the founding
[06:35.960 --> 06:42.600]  members there at CNN when it kicked off in the early 1980s he of course needs no
[06:42.600 --> 06:48.280]  introduction Lou Dobbs and he's the host at what 7 p.m. Eastern on Fox business
[06:48.280 --> 06:54.520]  network of Lou Dobbs tonight he also from 2 p.m. Eastern on also hosts a very
[06:54.520 --> 06:59.360]  successful syndicated radio broadcast the websites Lou Dobbs.com of course our
[06:59.360 --> 07:05.720]  websites are info wars.com prison planet.com and GCN live.com and there's a
[07:05.720 --> 07:10.280]  host of issues Donald Trump you know does Lou think he's really gonna run as Lou
[07:10.280 --> 07:14.200]  heard any word about who's gonna be replacing Glenn Beck during that slot
[07:14.200 --> 07:18.200]  what's his take on inflation the budget we're gonna cover it all with Lou
[07:18.200 --> 07:23.240]  Dobbs here today but out of the gates Lou going back a decade or more I
[07:23.240 --> 07:29.280]  remember watching you on CNN you're the real trailblazer on mainline cable
[07:29.280 --> 07:33.720]  television you were just going off their own statements the UN's own statements
[07:33.720 --> 07:38.280]  the council on foreign relations own statements about a supernational private
[07:38.280 --> 07:43.760]  corporate banking world government a rotting national sovereignty media
[07:43.760 --> 07:49.040]  matters George Soros others really targeted you when you did it in a very
[07:49.040 --> 07:53.360]  level headed well-documented way you know really you're the precursor on
[07:53.360 --> 07:59.240]  mainline TV of some of the things Beck did in a little bit more I guess you know
[07:59.240 --> 08:03.960]  carnival type way and and I mean I don't mean that meanly it's so I understand
[08:03.960 --> 08:08.520]  and so here you are completely vindicated you were always vindicated
[08:08.520 --> 08:11.920]  because you were just going off the documents and the elitist own statements
[08:11.920 --> 08:16.880]  but now open announcements every day and the Washington Post financial times of
[08:16.880 --> 08:24.240]  London global government private banking system end of the dollar just Obama
[08:24.240 --> 08:28.480]  following the orders of the UN not even consulting Congress to start this new
[08:28.480 --> 08:32.600]  war now they're talking about ground troops what is it like a decade after
[08:32.600 --> 08:37.280]  you began to be the first to expose this on mainline TV to be demonized to be
[08:37.280 --> 08:41.040]  attacked to have somebody shoot at your house to go through all of this to
[08:41.040 --> 08:46.720]  expose the North American Union and now it's it's almost passé but but you
[08:46.720 --> 08:51.840]  were demonized for it and and of course as you know how that's the reflex of the
[08:51.840 --> 08:59.360]  left in this country and I expect to you know to be attacked or you know take
[08:59.360 --> 09:03.760]  positions that are popular with with the left of that and that's fine because
[09:03.760 --> 09:10.320]  what my interest is America and America and you know that is just where I
[09:10.320 --> 09:15.520]  that's where I happen to reside intellectually emotionally physically
[09:15.520 --> 09:20.200]  and I make no apology for being an American who was concerned most about
[09:20.200 --> 09:24.920]  America and America if that's straightforward and to see whether it
[09:24.920 --> 09:29.680]  and what my great concern in all of us over the years has been you know aside
[09:29.680 --> 09:33.840]  from a position on any one of these developments so that our audience
[09:33.840 --> 09:40.320]  understand that when we make a deal with the United Nations when we sign on to
[09:40.320 --> 09:45.080]  the World Trade Organization when we for that matter when we're part of NATO we
[09:45.080 --> 09:53.000]  are at some margin at some level in some cases at a extreme level consigning the
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.560]  way this nation sovereignty and we are deferring national interest to a
[09:57.560 --> 10:01.120]  broader interest whether it be a European interest whether it be a global
[10:01.120 --> 10:07.520]  interest or whether it be an Asian it doesn't matter but our leaders our
[10:07.520 --> 10:14.240]  elite have on too many occasions sought to obfuscate that reality and and to
[10:14.240 --> 10:19.760]  act to pretend as though there's no consequence or implication for the
[10:19.760 --> 10:24.840]  well-being of the American people or the national interest and I find that to
[10:24.840 --> 10:29.280]  be not only hypocrisy but frankly unamerican.
[10:29.280 --> 10:34.400]  Lou Dobbs is our guest. Lou when you over the last decade talk about globalists
[10:34.400 --> 10:38.120]  talk about elitist you would put up quotes from the Council on Foreign
[10:38.120 --> 10:43.640]  Relations from Robert Pasture from the internal SPP documents that judicial
[10:43.640 --> 10:49.400]  watch suited God and then judicial watch and others you had on your show had
[10:49.400 --> 10:52.960]  the documents but but still media matters and others would imply it was a
[10:52.960 --> 10:57.800]  conspiracy theory but but from your research who are these international
[10:57.800 --> 11:04.840]  interest who are these elitist and what is their overall goal and from your
[11:04.840 --> 11:10.520]  research why is that basically in direct opposition to the interest of our free
[11:10.520 --> 11:15.120]  republic. Well the answer the latter part first of
[11:15.120 --> 11:20.320]  I mean Alex and that is this free this free republic this great constitutional
[11:20.320 --> 11:26.640]  republic is utterly dependent on an informed citizenry and an engaged in
[11:26.640 --> 11:33.800]  participatory sentences and what is occurring now is that is a constraint of
[11:33.800 --> 11:39.680]  information one would think that given the internet all of the variants media
[11:39.680 --> 11:44.720]  that all of the vehicles of communication that American citizens would be
[11:44.720 --> 11:50.480]  better informed than ever no far more about the public policy choices that are
[11:50.480 --> 11:53.600]  being made whether that Congress whether to the bureaucracy of the
[11:53.600 --> 11:58.880]  executive whether to the judiciary but in point of fact we know less today than
[11:58.880 --> 12:02.920]  we did 50 years ago about what our government is doing and the and the
[12:02.920 --> 12:07.960]  reasons for it are many but among them I it's been a decision among elites and
[12:07.960 --> 12:13.040]  by the way I'm talking about frankly both political party in one way or another
[12:13.040 --> 12:21.000]  being involved in an effort to simply preside rather than to represent and to
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.680]  do so with a view that they somehow are ordained to lead rather than dependent
[12:27.680 --> 12:31.720]  upon the consent of the government so when we start talking about the elites
[12:31.720 --> 12:37.920]  that are if you will not necessarily conspiring but certainly acting as
[12:37.920 --> 12:46.320]  if they were in a collusion and concert to create the North American Union it's
[12:46.320 --> 12:51.200]  an empirical statement it's based on fact it's not a question of ideology it's
[12:51.200 --> 12:55.720]  not a question of philosophy or partisanship the reality is the security
[12:55.720 --> 12:59.240]  and prosperity partnership is the foundation it was attended as a
[12:59.240 --> 13:03.920]  foundation to bring three countries together Mexico the United States and
[13:03.920 --> 13:08.560]  Canada and that harmonization as they like to call it but I'm talking about
[13:08.560 --> 13:13.760]  the elites of the United States military and that of the Canadians at
[13:13.760 --> 13:19.120]  Mexico our business elites our political elite and frankly they're
[13:19.120 --> 13:25.640]  represented again by both political parties are working to bring about not
[13:25.640 --> 13:34.760]  only a custom union not only a common currency but an actual our consolidation
[13:34.760 --> 13:40.280]  of three nations into one well that's what's so frustrating is that you are
[13:40.280 --> 13:44.800]  covering real information like if you were a weatherman and a thunderstorm
[13:44.800 --> 13:49.920]  blew through and the and the water you know measuring meters set an inch and
[13:49.920 --> 13:53.040]  a half a rain fell and you're sitting there with the rain gauge showing the
[13:53.040 --> 13:57.400]  rain everybody knows this is happening and then they're moving forward these
[13:57.400 --> 14:01.280]  elites with these programs but then they have no respect for the general
[14:01.280 --> 14:06.560]  public and play this deceptive game of saying Lou Dobbs is lying to you when we
[14:06.560 --> 14:12.160]  have this ruling political international class that as you said tries to rule by
[14:12.160 --> 14:18.440]  deception and doesn't want the people involved in governing through their
[14:18.440 --> 14:23.720]  representatives you use the word rule I would use the word in attempt to
[14:23.720 --> 14:29.560]  influence and you know the effect in some instances may be the same Alex but
[14:29.560 --> 14:35.040]  what we are truly watching is that is an effort on the part of a group of
[14:35.040 --> 14:43.760]  elites worldwide who wish to bring about a one-world order it may not be
[14:43.760 --> 14:47.360]  particularly a new world order such that the effort has been underway for some
[14:47.360 --> 14:53.560]  time but but that is one of the tensions but obviously working our global
[14:53.560 --> 14:59.160]  society and you look at this global order they're trying to establish it's
[14:59.160 --> 15:05.080]  very undemocratic it it is against sovereignty it is always openly
[15:05.080 --> 15:09.360]  anti-family anything that is independent anything that they can't
[15:09.360 --> 15:13.520]  control they they want us dependent that's what these elites want these
[15:13.520 --> 15:17.880]  mega corporations that aren't free market that's their goal I want to read to
[15:17.880 --> 15:21.760]  you a headline if we put it back on screen and I first saw this in the
[15:21.760 --> 15:25.880]  news in 2002 and when I would cover it even in the Washington Post as a foot
[15:25.880 --> 15:30.440]  note people couldn't believe it but here is the Ottawa citizen one of the big
[15:30.440 --> 15:35.720]  papers in Canada for those that don't know February 22nd 2008 this is three
[15:35.720 --> 15:39.320]  years ago and there's new articles on this as well as part of the continental
[15:39.320 --> 15:43.760]  security perimeter and it says Canada U.S. agree to use each other's troops in
[15:43.760 --> 15:47.480]  civil emergencies and if you read the Pentagon agreement with Canada and
[15:47.480 --> 15:53.560]  Mexico it says we will aid each other during civil unrest so and I've had
[15:53.560 --> 15:58.960]  generals on who retired that say yes this has been the works for a long time
[16:00.360 --> 16:04.680]  you've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator infuses the
[16:04.680 --> 16:07.840]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[16:07.840 --> 16:11.680]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs system and
[16:11.680 --> 16:15.440]  how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.880]  body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs
[16:19.880 --> 16:24.200]  generator not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and
[16:24.200 --> 16:28.360]  ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators
[16:28.360 --> 16:33.080]  and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target
[16:33.080 --> 16:40.400]  areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally
[16:40.400 --> 16:44.400]  for the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of
[16:44.400 --> 16:50.440]  the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how
[16:50.440 --> 16:54.880]  the Silver Lungs system works as well we are always ready to answer any
[16:54.880 --> 17:01.360]  questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com this is Alex Jones with
[17:01.360 --> 17:05.120]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[17:05.120 --> 17:08.880]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[17:08.880 --> 17:13.400]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[17:13.400 --> 17:16.960]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[17:16.960 --> 17:21.360]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[17:21.360 --> 17:25.680]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[17:25.680 --> 17:29.440]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[17:29.440 --> 17:33.520]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[19:57.440 --> 20:05.600]  zero nine five six three three coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening
[20:05.600 --> 20:10.840]  to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network network
[20:10.840 --> 20:26.920]  defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[20:26.920 --> 20:31.480]  and I've had generals on who retired that say yes this has been the works for a
[20:31.480 --> 20:37.160]  long time to use foreign troops in America and vice versa I mean it doesn't
[20:37.160 --> 20:43.600]  get any more crazy or new order than that and it is again for the very reason
[20:43.600 --> 20:49.320]  to stated it is not a matter of public knowledge it is not a part of the
[20:49.320 --> 20:55.440]  consciousness of the American society and the voting public and this this
[20:55.440 --> 20:59.840]  reflect that has grown up over the course of the last particularly the last 30
[20:59.840 --> 21:06.080]  years in this country speaking only about America then that either political
[21:06.080 --> 21:12.240]  party leaders elected the leaders of this country would in any way seek to
[21:12.240 --> 21:19.800]  deny a larger body of public knowledge it is to be contemptible and the
[21:19.800 --> 21:27.240]  national media has too often worked as not only a willing but an eager
[21:27.240 --> 21:32.720]  accomplice particularly to the left and and the Democratic Party itself I mean
[21:32.720 --> 21:38.600]  when you look at the Washington Post the New York Times ABC CBS NBC evening news
[21:38.600 --> 21:45.280]  I mean these are effectively you know house organs for the Democratic Party and
[21:45.280 --> 21:49.560]  that's unfortunate because we need watchdogs on our fourth estate not
[21:49.560 --> 21:55.120]  lapdogs and unfortunately most of the national liberal media focus it is
[21:55.120 --> 22:00.320]  actually focused on performing that role role of lapdog and help and helper
[22:00.320 --> 22:06.840]  rather than watchdog well that was my next issue as the establishment media
[22:06.840 --> 22:13.120]  kind of circles the wagons with the political class we're seeing J. Rockefeller
[22:13.120 --> 22:18.800]  we're seeing Lieberman we're seeing all these statements Cass Sunstein about
[22:18.800 --> 22:23.400]  restricting the free press fairness doctrine taxes on what they call
[22:23.400 --> 22:27.400]  conspiracy theories things that they and Cass Sunstein of course the
[22:27.400 --> 22:31.960]  regulations are listed not believing in man-made global warming well we see
[22:31.960 --> 22:35.880]  Ariana Huffington saying how do we shut down Fox News how do we shut down
[22:35.880 --> 22:39.800]  Glenn Beck we see two weeks ago in Politico I don't know if you saw it the
[22:39.800 --> 22:44.480]  chilling memos from the head of media matters saying we are gonna gorilla
[22:44.480 --> 22:50.000]  infiltrate with spies in organizations we're gonna destroy not just Fox News
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.680]  but this list of conservative sites and you go there you're being demonized I'm
[22:53.680 --> 22:58.680]  being demonized Judge Napolitano I mean these people aren't what even you'd
[22:58.680 --> 23:03.440]  call liberal I mean they're more like Joe Stalin or something I mean I mean they
[23:03.440 --> 23:09.600]  really are authoritarian and scary they are authoritarian in an outlook and and
[23:09.600 --> 23:15.640]  I think in in value structure which makes them extraordinarily dangerous not
[23:15.640 --> 23:22.520]  necessarily to Fox News but to the to the country when when media takes on a
[23:22.520 --> 23:29.960]  role that is utterly destructive in intent and purpose and and that is
[23:29.960 --> 23:34.680]  precisely what many of these advocacy organizations do and they pretend to be
[23:34.680 --> 23:41.560]  some sort of watchdog organization but they they pretend to be forming that
[23:41.560 --> 23:46.080]  role when they are fact advocacy and activist organizations but the great
[23:46.080 --> 23:50.120]  thing Alex is that the American people are getting a very clear look at who
[23:50.120 --> 23:55.560]  but what they are and what their designs are that's healthy for the for the
[23:55.560 --> 24:00.720]  nation and I'm delighted to see that light shine very brightly on who they
[24:00.720 --> 24:05.360]  are and what they're up to well I don't want to spend all our time on that group
[24:05.360 --> 24:11.880]  but I mean they are 501c3 and I know mild libertarian groups who have their
[24:11.880 --> 24:17.400]  501c3 jerked for just getting involved you know in stating their opinion how
[24:17.400 --> 24:22.680]  can they be a pure house organ of George Soros openly calling for the end of
[24:22.680 --> 24:27.400]  free speech in America and then be given 501c3 I mean that that that is very
[24:27.400 --> 24:36.520]  discriminatory it is it's a very least curious and the use of 501c3 in our
[24:36.520 --> 24:39.800]  society is something I think that ought to be looked at irrespective of the
[24:39.800 --> 24:48.520]  ideology or the intent and we have become a nation of nonprofits that are
[24:48.520 --> 24:54.160]  starting to supplant in many ways to be Alex traditionally the function of
[24:54.160 --> 25:01.000]  government particularly at the local or county and state level I worry less
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.120]  about the federal level honestly the national level but we need we need to
[25:05.120 --> 25:08.480]  understand what the implications are for all of these nonprofits that have
[25:08.480 --> 25:11.320]  grown up over the years that they've grown up by the way they number in a
[25:11.320 --> 25:16.840]  billion some of them with the very best of purposes but the fact is we we are
[25:16.840 --> 25:21.520]  diluting our system of government through those through those nonprofits
[25:21.520 --> 25:28.480]  NGOs and other entities that have been created I'd much prefer people turn to
[25:28.480 --> 25:33.040]  government for the services that ship well isn't that an unfair playing field
[25:33.040 --> 25:36.720]  to me the UN model is these NGOs I mean I mean here's an example I want your take
[25:36.720 --> 25:41.840]  on this thousands of waivers handed out to fortune 500 but even smaller groups
[25:41.840 --> 25:45.640]  that have given campaign contributions to the Democrats and Obama with its
[25:45.640 --> 25:48.760]  hundreds of thousands of employees McDonald's gets a waiver on buying
[25:48.760 --> 25:53.080]  insurance for its employees but I'm if this stuff you know gets implemented
[25:53.080 --> 25:56.800]  I've got to get insurance for all of my employees and I will take part of their
[25:56.800 --> 26:01.160]  check to do it so isn't that an unfair trade advantage that a hamburger place
[26:01.160 --> 26:04.720]  right next to McDonald's the mom and pop they've got to get insurance but
[26:04.720 --> 26:08.880]  McDonald's doesn't so if you go you know pay money to the emperor he then waves
[26:08.880 --> 26:12.760]  his wand and gives you an unfair trade advantage I don't think there's any
[26:12.760 --> 26:17.760]  question about it whatsoever it's it is not only unfair but so
[26:17.760 --> 26:23.040]  transparently patronage that it's nauseating when you look at the
[26:23.040 --> 26:28.680]  principal beneficiary of these waivers they you're not auto United auto
[26:28.680 --> 26:34.920]  workers you the first what is the principal beneficiary of these waivers
[26:34.920 --> 26:40.560]  you go beyond that it the supporters of this administration who received the
[26:40.560 --> 26:44.920]  greatest amount of money which by the way wasn't even revealed publicly by the
[26:44.920 --> 26:49.120]  bit the administration of the Democratic leadership but in Obamacare the
[26:49.120 --> 26:53.280]  principal beneficiary of the early retirement support program which amounts
[26:53.280 --> 26:57.960]  to five billion dollars goes to the United auto workers here so I mean it
[26:57.960 --> 27:03.120]  just goes on and on incredible a lot of other questions in a limited time we've
[27:03.120 --> 27:07.680]  got left for you what do you see coming up in this next election we see the
[27:07.680 --> 27:11.200]  forty billion dollar cut Ron Paul has come out and said that it was all
[27:11.200 --> 27:14.280]  basically stuff that had already been agreed to cut and what was left over
[27:14.280 --> 27:19.320]  from highway funds he's even saying Ryan's budget isn't going to fix things
[27:19.320 --> 27:23.320]  if we don't stop the banker bailouts and deal with what the Federal Reserve's
[27:23.320 --> 27:28.520]  doing monetizing the debt and devaluing the currency that all of this is
[27:28.520 --> 27:32.920]  window-dressing Lou Dobbs is a real financial expert decades in the trenches
[27:32.920 --> 27:36.760]  what's your view on what's happening with the budget well I had the opportunity
[27:36.760 --> 27:41.520]  to talk with the congressman two days ago and we discussed exactly these
[27:41.520 --> 27:47.880]  issues Alex and and the congressman does question whether or not any of this
[27:47.880 --> 27:52.760]  is sufficient given that there are larger issues than his views that of
[27:52.760 --> 27:57.720]  course principle among those the Federal Reserve and the banking system and the
[27:57.720 --> 28:01.040]  reforms that are necessary it's unquestionable that we need to reform
[28:01.040 --> 28:07.480]  our bank system that we need to take a very strong look and and reorganize in
[28:07.480 --> 28:12.720]  my judgment the Federal Reserve but that is a long that is a long-term effort
[28:12.720 --> 28:17.480]  it's going to take years to accomplish what I am so pleased with is that
[28:17.480 --> 28:22.720]  congressman Paul Ryan has come forward with the boldest most effective in my
[28:22.720 --> 28:32.200]  opinion budget plan to deal with deficit not the national debt but deficit in
[28:32.200 --> 28:36.040]  history unfortunately that's the kind of plan that is necessary because we've
[28:36.040 --> 28:40.640]  got as you know the greatest debt and the most preventive steps in our history
[28:40.640 --> 28:48.320]  but he has with a I think an opening with an opening state set the bar very
[28:48.320 --> 28:53.920]  high and as we watch the president close to it with the with a rather evil
[28:53.920 --> 28:59.840]  political policy speech that he gave at George Washington University Wednesday

[33:47.040 --> 33:51.160]  out the Associated Press is confirming the White House tried to get standard in
[33:51.160 --> 33:57.440]  pores to not start to move towards delisting the United States is a triple
[33:57.440 --> 34:00.920]  A rating that means that our interest rates will go up on the debt and we'll
[34:00.920 --> 34:05.080]  basically become like Argentina or the Weimar Republic that's coming up at the
[34:05.080 --> 34:09.880]  start of the next hour I've also got this incredible confirmed news that
[34:09.880 --> 34:13.640]  police all over the country are being issued these wireless systems that
[34:13.640 --> 34:18.480]  download everything off your cell phones without warrants and they're also the
[34:18.480 --> 34:22.040]  demanding at checkpoints to grab your phone and plug them in and download

[34:38.400 --> 34:42.640]  week dollar there's the Washington Post article actually AP also has it
[34:42.640 --> 34:47.240]  Obama administration officials tried to keep S&P rating at stable and they have
[34:47.240 --> 34:51.640]  the nerve to say upping budgets and raising the debt ceiling that that will
[34:51.640 --> 34:56.000]  stop a default when S&P and every other major economic institution with common
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.360]  sense it's not hard it's like saying up is up down is down left is right black
[35:01.360 --> 35:05.480]  is white it you know it's simple we're saying up is up they're saying up is
[35:05.480 --> 35:09.880]  down it's amazing and then meanwhile they're saying no more debt will keep us
[35:09.880 --> 35:13.720]  from defaulting when we're actually technically defaulting because they're
[35:13.720 --> 35:18.000]  now hyper-inflating and monetizing over 70% of the T bills but that's coming up
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.280]  next hour and then Steve Watson writer for info wars.com and
[35:21.280 --> 35:25.760]  prisonplot.com joins us from London via video Skype as well to break down
[35:25.760 --> 35:29.360]  things like the royal wedding and the Republicans aren't allowed to go out and
[35:29.360 --> 35:33.000]  protest but everybody else is allowed to celebrate we'll also get his view as a
[35:33.000 --> 35:40.640]  political scientist on what's happening with the situation in Libya and in the
[35:40.640 --> 35:44.160]  Middle East but Lord Christopher Moncton 3rd Viscount of Moncton and
[35:44.160 --> 35:49.760]  Brentially is the leading there's no doubt defender of science and reality
[35:49.760 --> 35:54.760]  when it comes to the fraud that is man-made global warming and the Kinley
[35:54.760 --> 35:59.320]  Al Gore plan to tax all human activity he's a British politician public
[35:59.320 --> 36:02.960]  speaker former newspaper editor and hereditary peer formerly a member of
[36:02.960 --> 36:06.800]  the Conservative Party he now formerly also headed up the UK Independence
[36:06.800 --> 36:10.960]  Party he served in the Conservative Central office also worked as one of the
[36:10.960 --> 36:15.400]  top advisors on science to Margaret Thatcher at number 10 policy unit in the
[36:15.400 --> 36:19.440]  1980s he also worked for the universe the sunny telegraph today and the
[36:19.440 --> 36:25.040]  evening standard his website is scienceandpublicpolicy.org or UKIP.org
[36:25.040 --> 36:29.120]  and here are the headlines today we'll cover this first before we get into the
[36:29.120 --> 36:33.880]  latest on the social engineers trying to seize the energy sources of the world
[36:33.880 --> 36:41.080]  UKIP launch their manifesto manifesto reveals intention for tough approach and
[36:41.080 --> 36:43.960]  we're gonna be breaking that down of course Nigel Farage of the UK
[36:43.960 --> 36:49.160]  Independence Party in the EU Parliament from England also a frequent guest here
[36:49.160 --> 36:53.000]  and survived that plane crash we're very thankful for that Lord Moncton thank you
[36:53.000 --> 37:12.200]  for joining us today from Scotland for those that don't know who the UK
[37:12.200 --> 37:16.640]  Independence Party is in the US it's basically similar to the Tea Party or
[37:16.640 --> 37:20.560]  the Ron Paul type folks that openly speak out against the global government
[37:20.560 --> 37:27.520]  openly quote the the scallywags on their plans and openly fight them and your
[37:27.520 --> 37:32.440]  party not just in the UK but in Europe similar groups are exploding and gaining
[37:32.440 --> 37:39.240]  ground tell us about this new D-Day invasion of the new order system well
[37:39.240 --> 37:44.680]  what is happening now is that in in Britain the United Kingdom Independence
[37:44.680 --> 37:52.120]  Party is very much on the March we only were founded 17 years ago by an
[37:52.120 --> 37:58.920]  academic and now suddenly we have grown into being the second biggest party in
[37:58.920 --> 38:03.440]  British politics in European Parliament elections of course the European
[38:03.440 --> 38:07.680]  Parliament isn't a real parliament it's not like your Congress it can't make
[38:07.680 --> 38:12.280]  laws it's just a kind of talking shop like the do mark of John Nicholas the
[38:12.280 --> 38:18.040]  second it shows the will of the British people so the will of British people it
[38:18.040 --> 38:22.600]  does show the will because we came second we beat everybody except the
[38:22.600 --> 38:26.920]  Conservatives that time and then in the recent by-election for the British
[38:26.920 --> 38:32.040]  Parliament in the seat of Barnsley where the former Labour member is now
[38:32.040 --> 38:37.660]  serving time in prison for having fiddled his expenses we came second
[38:37.660 --> 38:42.000]  beating the Conservative and Liberal parties who formed the coalition
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.120]  government here and coming second owned it to the Labour Party and if you put up
[38:46.120 --> 38:49.480]  a donkey for the Labour Party in Barnsley it's an old mining constituent
[38:49.480 --> 38:53.080]  it's Arthur Scargill's headquarters they'll always vote Labour there but
[38:53.080 --> 38:58.560]  UKIP came second now we're fighting local government elections all round
[38:58.560 --> 39:02.760]  Britain we have local government elections in in England we have Scottish
[39:02.760 --> 39:06.840]  Parliament elections in Scotland and the Welsh Assembly elections in Wales
[39:06.840 --> 39:12.560]  UKIP are contesting all three I am leading the UKIP effort in Scotland
[39:12.560 --> 39:17.880]  and in particular we're beginning to make some headway because the Scottish
[39:17.880 --> 39:23.720]  National Party which effectively is communist they are at present the
[39:23.720 --> 39:28.480]  ruling clique in in the Scottish Parliament and they came out with a
[39:28.480 --> 39:31.880]  manifesto earlier in the week which they said that they were going to generate
[39:31.880 --> 39:37.560]  100% of Scotland's electricity by so-called renewable means which they
[39:37.560 --> 39:43.080]  mainly mean wind-builds in just nine years time and I found myself at a
[39:43.080 --> 39:49.000]  Hustings just a few days ago opposite Rosanna Cunningham who is the so-called
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.120]  environment so-called minister for the so-called Scottish so-called government
[39:54.120 --> 39:58.520]  and she knows nothing about the environment because most politicians
[39:58.520 --> 40:02.480]  don't and she was saying well it is necessary to save the planet and of
[40:02.480 --> 40:06.520]  course it isn't but I said look if you believe that you'll believe that you
[40:06.520 --> 40:10.320]  really believe that in nine years time you're going to have enough windmills
[40:10.320 --> 40:14.360]  doing their thing to generate all of Scotland's electricity you only have to
[40:14.360 --> 40:20.160]  go back as far as last December when we had no wind for an entire month we had
[40:20.160 --> 40:27.120]  the second coldest winter in Britain since records began in 1659 that's what
[40:27.120 --> 40:31.040]  global warming means to us at the moment it was very very cold and the
[40:31.040 --> 40:36.840]  percentage of the UK and Scottish electricity contributed by all the windfarms
[40:36.840 --> 40:41.280]  that we have over that bitterly cold month and we needed all the electricity we
[40:41.280 --> 40:49.560]  get was at 0.0% amazing but to be clear you are now standing for the Scottish
[40:49.560 --> 40:54.720]  Parliament you are now running for office that's right it's most unlikely
[40:54.720 --> 40:58.000]  that I'll succeed this time round we're not the kind of politicians that
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.200]  pretend we're going to win when it's clear we're not we're too new in
[41:01.200 --> 41:07.400]  Scotland to expect to storm the gates yet and the press here are terrified of us
[41:07.400 --> 41:12.920]  but here they are with the the SNP the ruling faction here coming out with
[41:12.920 --> 41:18.160]  this mad I mean heroically lunatic policy of generating electricity with
[41:18.160 --> 41:25.720]  with the wind and at huge cost taxpayers of course the only elections that has
[41:25.720 --> 41:30.840]  from the outset opposed all these stupid windbills is the United Kingdom
[41:30.840 --> 41:35.200]  Independence Party and can we get ourselves onto a television program or
[41:35.200 --> 41:40.160]  into a newspaper virtually not at all they will not let us anywhere near the
[41:40.160 --> 41:44.560]  media here it's a closed shop it's a little kind of Marxist cozy between the
[41:44.560 --> 41:49.680]  liberals and the socialists and the SNP and which of them is more communist is
[41:49.680 --> 41:54.240]  not for me to say but they're all pretty far to the left and the media up here
[41:54.240 --> 41:57.880]  exactly the same they don't want the truth told they don't want the voice of
[41:57.880 --> 42:01.680]  democracy to be heard and I'll give you a little vignette which will really make
[42:01.680 --> 42:05.480]  you laugh Alex this was absolutely wonderful when Nigel Farage who's a
[42:05.480 --> 42:10.600]  regular guest on your show came up very kindly to support me and do the launch
[42:10.600 --> 42:16.520]  in Edinburgh all new hips manifesto one of the topics on that on that
[42:16.520 --> 42:21.220]  manifesto is that we want to give people the same right as they have in
[42:21.220 --> 42:27.080]  Switzerland so that if the people think that the governing class is not
[42:27.080 --> 42:30.640]  representing them on a particular subject that the people that matters to the
[42:30.640 --> 42:36.120]  people they can call a referendum if one percent of them sign a request saying we
[42:36.120 --> 42:41.840]  want a recall then yeah exactly that and then that referendum on any subject
[42:41.840 --> 42:47.520]  they like has to be held and the result is binding on the Scottish Parliament the
[42:47.520 --> 42:52.080]  Westminster Parliament and of course the the unelected digital commissars of
[42:52.080 --> 42:55.920]  Europe and that was our policy
[42:59.920 --> 43:05.480]  a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[43:05.480 --> 43:09.920]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything
[43:09.920 --> 43:14.400]  about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your children and even
[43:14.400 --> 43:17.800]  how you take care of your health and your own family now this man has made some
[43:17.800 --> 43:22.040]  outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you
[43:22.040 --> 43:26.000]  see he predicted the collapse of GM Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.880]  biggest small-owner general-growth properties in fact Barron's called his
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.340]  work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[43:34.340 --> 43:37.760]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a
[43:37.760 --> 43:41.680]  real eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this
[43:41.680 --> 43:45.080]  free video online today he explains everything you need to know including

[44:01.480 --> 44:05.200]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[44:05.200 --> 44:09.960]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[44:09.960 --> 44:13.880]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[44:13.880 --> 44:17.760]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[44:17.760 --> 44:22.720]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[44:22.720 --> 44:28.000]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.560]  nano particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[44:32.560 --> 44:36.800]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[44:36.800 --> 44:41.680]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[44:41.680 --> 44:46.440]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to
[44:46.440 --> 44:52.040]  www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of
[44:52.040 --> 44:58.280]  the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[45:00.680 --> 45:05.560]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[45:05.560 --> 45:11.080]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[45:11.080 --> 45:14.800]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've tremendous
[45:14.800 --> 45:19.880]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[45:19.880 --> 45:25.200]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[45:25.200 --> 45:30.120]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[45:30.120 --> 45:34.520]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[45:34.520 --> 45:38.240]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[45:38.240 --> 45:42.200]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[45:42.200 --> 45:47.840]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[45:47.840 --> 45:53.880]  Republic yet your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're
[45:53.880 --> 46:00.280]  watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV this is
[46:00.280 --> 46:03.640]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[46:03.640 --> 46:07.600]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[46:07.600 --> 46:11.840]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[46:11.840 --> 46:16.120]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[46:16.120 --> 46:20.480]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[46:20.480 --> 46:24.560]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[46:24.560 --> 46:29.120]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[46:29.120 --> 46:33.240]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[46:33.240 --> 46:37.240]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[46:37.240 --> 46:41.040]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[46:41.040 --> 46:43.760]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[46:43.760 --> 46:48.720]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my
[46:48.720 --> 46:52.840]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government
[46:52.840 --> 47:00.760]  doesn't own the Sun should go to my solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365
[47:00.760 --> 47:06.840]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[47:06.840 --> 47:22.960]  Broadcasting Network now I've been interviewed by a BBC reporter who it was
[47:22.960 --> 47:27.400]  quite clear was again from the Marxist wing of the BBC which means about 99.9
[47:27.400 --> 47:31.520]  percent of it and I said to her just a matter of interest what did you think of
[47:31.520 --> 47:35.840]  the idea of letting the people decide what matters to them and this is this was
[47:35.840 --> 47:41.080]  her reply to classic BBC it's classic Marxism and it really illustrates the
[47:41.080 --> 47:46.080]  problem that democracy now faces really worldwide she said well of course you
[47:46.080 --> 47:50.880]  know the thing about the people is that if you let them decide what matters they
[47:50.880 --> 47:54.720]  will vote for trivialities won't they they'll vote for trivial things things
[47:54.720 --> 48:00.240]  that don't matter that was the absolute instinctual profound deeply held
[48:00.240 --> 48:06.520]  contempt that the BBC and the person of this dopey little reporter had for the
[48:06.520 --> 48:11.400]  rights and freedoms and democracy of ordinary people that's what we're up against
[48:11.400 --> 48:16.480]  Alex this governing class which is sort of taking over and is gradually
[48:16.480 --> 48:21.200]  dismantling democracy everywhere as we speak it's largely gone as you know in
[48:21.200 --> 48:25.840]  the UK we've talked to this before well I want you to go Europe sure I want you
[48:25.840 --> 48:31.640]  to go over that Lord Moncton but but first digressing back yeah since she
[48:31.640 --> 48:36.120]  raises same thing here in the US they create regional governments that are
[48:36.120 --> 48:40.840]  basically appointed by the federal bureaucracy and then they tell the
[48:40.840 --> 48:48.080]  counties the cities the states what to do and you've got Obama telling the EPA
[48:48.080 --> 48:53.000]  to shut down coal power plants and other plants and even hydroelectric dams
[48:53.000 --> 48:59.720]  with no law behind him and then when states sign stand up against them the
[48:59.720 --> 49:03.440]  feds will come in and even seize the facilities but then meanwhile general
[49:03.440 --> 49:07.600]  electric who paid no taxes last year they had up the president's economic
[49:07.600 --> 49:12.760]  council Obama has given them waivers to open new plants and not upgrade their
[49:12.760 --> 49:16.840]  dirty coal plants but everyone else basically the head of the energy
[49:16.840 --> 49:21.200]  department has said they're going to start shutting down I mean people call
[49:21.200 --> 49:24.840]  them mindless environmentalists are well-meaning idiots they're not idiots
[49:24.840 --> 49:30.120]  they're gangsters creating oligopolies creating monopolies shutting down their
[49:30.120 --> 49:33.360]  competition and it's the same thing in England where you have government
[49:33.360 --> 49:37.640]  funded media and then they won't let the UK Independence Party get on TV but
[49:37.640 --> 49:42.080]  regardless you guys run a couple times in every new area and then start winning
[49:42.080 --> 49:46.640]  as people hear your common sense being injected so for those that don't know
[49:46.640 --> 49:54.920]  describe how over 70% of UK laws are are handed down from the EU because this is
[49:54.920 --> 49:59.000]  something a lot of Americans don't understand that's a very good point and
[49:59.000 --> 50:06.680]  it's actually 83% it's five laws in six handed down by the unelected commissars
[50:06.680 --> 50:12.400]  that is the official German title for the commissars that hated communist term
[50:12.400 --> 50:17.040]  for the people who ran the Soviet government the commissars the whole
[50:17.040 --> 50:21.840]  Soviet Constitution has moved westward 83% of Europe's laws that includes
[50:21.840 --> 50:27.640]  Britain's laws and Scott's laws are made by people that nobody elects we can't
[50:27.640 --> 50:31.560]  hold them to account we can't question them we don't even know who they are we
[50:31.560 --> 50:35.960]  can't remove them and we can't replace them these people are the enemies of
[50:35.960 --> 50:40.400]  freedom and democracy they have their own agenda which is not an agenda which you
[50:40.400 --> 50:45.720]  or I or the vast majority of good red blooded Americans Alex would ever dream
[50:45.720 --> 50:51.480]  of going along with and they make the laws and shall I describe how they do it
[50:51.480 --> 50:58.960]  because it is a fascinating process and it starts by them meeting in secret to
[50:58.960 --> 51:03.440]  decide the commissars this is 27 of them they meet in secret behind closed doors
[51:03.440 --> 51:06.800]  press not allowed in nobody allowed to know what they're talking about it's
[51:06.800 --> 51:13.000]  entirely secret and then every three hours day and night 365 and a quarter days
[51:13.000 --> 51:19.440]  a year they issue a new directive that's what they call the law in Europe not a
[51:19.440 --> 51:25.080]  democratic bill or act a direct and directive as you know is the root of
[51:25.080 --> 51:32.440]  dictator that's it it is an instruction from our new masters on how we are to
[51:32.440 --> 51:38.240]  behave and the so-called parliament of the individual member states like the
[51:38.240 --> 51:42.680]  Westminster Parliament and the Scottish Parliament it is their duty to enact
[51:42.680 --> 51:48.200]  these directives into the law of the individual member states and if they
[51:48.200 --> 51:53.600]  don't then the government can be fined unlimited amounts of money by the
[51:53.600 --> 52:00.200]  commissars until they do comply and so what happens is that first stage of the
[52:00.200 --> 52:04.320]  law is this directive is proposed in secret then it is passed from the
[52:04.320 --> 52:10.120]  commissars to another secret committee indeed a committee so secret but until
[52:10.120 --> 52:16.160]  just a few months ago its very existence was not even mentioned on the European
[52:16.160 --> 52:20.320]  Union's own website and this is the committee of permanent representatives
[52:20.320 --> 52:24.560]  by the very phrase permanent you can tell that they're not elected because
[52:24.560 --> 52:30.440]  election is not a permanent state but they are appointed bureaucrats nobody
[52:30.440 --> 52:34.840]  knows who they are they meet in secret to do what you in Congress would call the
[52:34.840 --> 52:38.720]  markup which is the detailed consideration of the legislation and we
[52:38.720 --> 52:43.520]  would call the committee stage and that again we would do it in public you do it
[52:43.520 --> 52:48.600]  in public they do it in secret and they are not elected to do it then it goes
[52:48.600 --> 52:55.320]  from them to would you believe a third body also meeting in secret this one is
[52:55.320 --> 52:58.600]  called the Council of Ministers do you think our ministers perhaps they're
[52:58.600 --> 53:02.760]  elected yes they are but they don't sit on the Council of Ministers but not very
[53:02.760 --> 53:05.880]  often anyway normally the Council of Ministers is you've
[53:05.880 --> 53:11.120]  guessed it another group of unelected bureaucrats meeting in secret to decide
[53:11.120 --> 53:16.440]  whether the law proposed by the commissars and worked on by this
[53:16.440 --> 53:20.720]  committee of permanent representatives shall become the supreme law of Europe
[53:20.720 --> 53:28.200]  and if they say no that's the end of it if they say yes then and only then it is
[53:28.200 --> 53:32.400]  put in front of the only elected institution in Europe this is the
[53:32.400 --> 53:36.400]  European talking shop or it's called a parliament that's a joke word for it
[53:36.400 --> 53:41.240]  really and the talking shop can express an opinion but it cannot decide the
[53:41.240 --> 53:45.320]  legislation it cannot either decide in favor or against all it can do is express
[53:45.320 --> 53:51.800]  an opinion if it says yes then the legislation even then doesn't necessarily
[53:51.800 --> 53:55.480]  go through because the commissars have been known to put forward kind of
[53:55.480 --> 53:59.080]  stalking horse legislation they don't want to go through so then it goes through
[53:59.080 --> 54:02.760]  all these stages wasting everybody's time then the commissars say we want to show
[54:02.760 --> 54:06.840]  who's boss and we're going to not let that legislation proceed and so they can
[54:06.840 --> 54:11.760]  then overrule the European elections and it goes on and on but the reasons is
[54:11.760 --> 54:16.360]  important I must give you the next day the next day sure go ahead one more
[54:16.360 --> 54:22.280]  stage it then goes to the parliament of the member states for debate but of
[54:22.280 --> 54:26.200]  course we don't get debate in our parliament on this it goes to the
[54:26.200 --> 54:30.600]  legislative scrutiny committee of the House of Commons and you've guessed it
[54:30.600 --> 54:34.640]  that's the only committee of the House of Commons but meets behind closed doors
[54:34.640 --> 54:39.720]  in secret now if you read the Madison papers and you see how insistent they
[54:39.720 --> 54:45.760]  were that the Congress that they created with article one section one of your
[54:45.760 --> 54:51.160]  great constitution of liberty was to meet in public so that those who had
[54:51.160 --> 54:54.920]  elected the members of both houses of Congress of course it was one house
[54:54.920 --> 54:59.320]  originally but now both has Congress could see what it was that those who
[54:59.320 --> 55:04.080]  they had elected were doing and saying on their behalf democracy doesn't work
[55:04.080 --> 55:10.760]  and that legislation is considered in public but every state of the legislation
[55:10.760 --> 55:15.840]  that is now imposed upon us from Europe is conducted in secret Lord Moncton
[55:15.840 --> 55:20.600]  studying these systems is there not a continuity of agenda through the
[55:20.600 --> 55:23.000]  bureaucratic class
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.840]  if there is I mean it's very clear that the European model which is
[55:26.840 --> 55:31.240]  tyrannied by Clark as we call it is that's the model they're now going to
[55:31.240 --> 55:36.120]  try and spread worldwide they've grown tired of democracy they don't like the
[55:36.120 --> 55:40.400]  voters coming along and saying we don't like the arrangements you have made for
[55:40.400 --> 55:45.200]  us we want another lot to take charge they hate that they hate being thrown out
[55:45.200 --> 55:49.440]  after they've had all the trappings and motor cars and red boxes and everybody
[55:49.440 --> 55:53.560]  calling them minister and secretary of state they love all that and they don't
[55:53.560 --> 55:57.520]  like it taken away and they realize the way to make sure it never gets taken away
[55:57.520 --> 56:02.200]  again it's simply to take democracy away and so the European Union was set up
[56:02.200 --> 56:07.840]  right from the start with elaborate care to make sure that no point did
[56:07.840 --> 56:13.000]  democracy get anywhere near the real decision-making and so when it came to
[56:13.000 --> 56:18.800]  setting up the world government which the UN would like to set up save the
[56:18.800 --> 56:25.120]  planet from supposed climate change they used you and they use EU advisers and
[56:25.120 --> 56:29.920]  their fingers were all over the dockets I read in Cancun last December at the
[56:29.920 --> 56:33.920]  latest round of this kind of rolling international conference they have and
[56:33.920 --> 56:39.280]  it's quite clear that they've decided the way to go is the EU way but without
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.000]  even bothering to have the fig leaf of an elected parliament they're not even
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.920]  going to have it as a fig leaf it's going to be openly anti-democratic and they
[56:48.920 --> 56:52.840]  reckon they're going to get away with it but I reckon they're not because one
[56:52.840 --> 56:56.520]  of the things that's happening is that when I first began talking about world
[56:56.520 --> 57:00.400]  government people said to me oh yes you're another world government
[57:00.400 --> 57:05.360]  conspiracy theorist pointy head don't you have more sense than that so the
[57:05.360 --> 57:09.600]  first person that said this to me was Kevin Lybin who was a journalist very
[57:09.600 --> 57:14.000]  distinguished journalist actually on the the National Post in Canada which is a
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.840]  very major newspaper and I had been speaking to the petroleum club of Cal
[57:18.840 --> 57:23.400]  Korea's about two years ago three years ago and I said this world government is
[57:23.400 --> 57:27.400]  coming the treat is already in draft this was the draft Copenhagen treated
[57:27.400 --> 57:30.880]  eventually failed but I said it's quite clear that what they want is world
[57:30.880 --> 57:33.680]  government he came up after to know World Government World Government is not
[57:33.680 --> 57:37.640]  you know this is just conspiracy theory I said I have three words for you Kevin
[57:37.640 --> 57:40.400]  he said what I said read the treaty
[57:40.400 --> 57:44.640]  he said you mean there is one I said do you think I'd just sit here and make stuff out
[57:44.640 --> 57:53.440]  so I sent him a copy of it a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in
[57:53.440 --> 57:58.840]  2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years he
[57:58.840 --> 58:02.840]  says it will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest

[58:06.080 --> 58:09.440]  family now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[58:09.440 --> 58:14.200]  the crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM

[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.920]  30 minutes but he's graciously staying with us under 20 because I've got a
[1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:35.080]  bunch of questions we haven't even gotten into I constantly study the mega
[1:00:35.080 --> 1:00:38.440]  corporations that are not free market teamed up with government bureaucracies
[1:00:38.440 --> 1:00:44.400]  trying to set up a mafia system where you've got to get an imperial seal from
[1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:47.600]  them to be able to do business and that's what this is all about so the next
[1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:51.400]  segment we'll talk about the fact that they're down but they're not out exposed
[1:00:51.400 --> 1:00:56.680]  by climategate now two years ago how they're trying to counter strike back at
[1:00:56.680 --> 1:01:01.960]  the forces of liberty with literally the leading mind and believe me I do a lot
[1:01:01.960 --> 1:01:05.080]  of research folks he's the leading guy there's been a hundred percent spot on
[1:01:05.080 --> 1:01:09.340]  in all his mathematical calculations on what he broke down about what were
[1:01:09.340 --> 1:01:13.520]  frauds the UN had put out I mean he almost like he has a crystal ball Lord
[1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:17.920]  Christopher Monkton of science and public policy.org this is a short
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:21.480]  segment the next segment we'll get into their latest attacks on our liberty and
[1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:25.760]  how we stop them globally because it's the same program worldwide but finishing
[1:01:25.760 --> 1:01:32.960]  up you were getting into a police state example Lord Monkton and then we'll come
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:40.200]  back and get into their latest operations. 18 months ago Jason McGoldrick who had gone
[1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:45.440]  over to Hungary to set up a company there which had failed came back to the UK a few
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:52.760]  months after that the serious organized crime agency that's our KGB
[1:01:52.760 --> 1:01:58.600]  kicked down the door of his house at three in the morning took him away without
[1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:03.720]  telling his wife and family where they were taking him took him in front of a
[1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:09.080]  judge in London who had no power to stop what was happening next and put him on a
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:13.800]  plane to Hungary at the request of the prosecuting authorities there who said
[1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:18.400]  they were ready to prosecute him for fraud they there was no hearing to
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:21.720]  discover whether there was any evidence against him before he was shipped off
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:27.040]  overseas habeas corpus which is written into Magna Carta I was reading it in
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:32.240]  the original that in only the other day has now been taken away by this procedure
[1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:36.280]  called the European arrest warrant he was flung into jail without his parents or
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:40.720]  anybody or his children knowing or his wife knowing where he was he was fed on
[1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:47.240]  rancid pork fat three times a day which is effectively torture under UK law
[1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:50.640]  anyone who did that to you would be prosecuted for torture and that's a very
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:55.600]  serious criminal offense and he was kept there for four months and he got in touch
[1:02:55.600 --> 1:03:00.320]  with a conservative member of the European Parliament and now you'll know
[1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:03.120]  why I'm not a conservative because that conservative member of the European
[1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:07.800]  Parliament said to him I don't care whether you say you're innocent or not
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:13.000]  if one of our fellow governments in the European Union says you're guilty that's
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:18.200]  enough for me we don't need trials these days and you can stay right where you are
[1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:22.480]  and I'm not lifting a finger to help you and that was the extraordinary reply
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:26.480]  this man got eventually in prison so he got in touch with my noble friend the
[1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:30.480]  Earl of Dartmouth who is a sitting member of the European Parliament in the
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:34.120]  UKIP interest United Kingdom Independence Party they said to him will you help and
[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:40.400]  Dartmouth got on the next plane went to the prison and got him out and got him
[1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:45.960]  out I've got to stop you sir sir I was not aware of this I knew this was going
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:51.640]  on I have seen on our local news they bring Japanese police here and are
[1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:57.040]  signing deals to allow them to grab US citizens they bring EU police here they
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:02.840]  send our police there it's unelected there are no laws they just do whatever
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:07.760]  they want and this is this new world order system where as long as it's a
[1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:12.280]  EU UN member you are now under their laws and they're now saying Americans
[1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:17.200]  will be under the anti free speech laws of Canada via this SPP we're going to
[1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:20.240]  break but I want to come back and give you the floor because some stations
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:24.800]  don't carry this segment to recap this story in great detail and get into it
[1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:29.600]  because because there's so many facets to this and you bring them all up and for
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:34.520]  those that aren't concerned this is one of the main reasons we had 1776 in this
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:39.200]  country is because they had kangaroo courts and the king and bureaucrats
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:45.600]  would haul a colonist who were British citizens on to boats and deprive them of
[1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:50.200]  English law and Magna Carta and take them to these kangaroo courts sometimes
[1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:54.960]  in other possessions I mean this is as tyrannical as it gets Lord Christopher
[1:04:54.960 --> 1:04:58.960]  Monkton this is unbelievable we're gonna pull some news articles up on this when
[1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:08.880]  we come back unbelievable tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has
[1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:13.640]  become reality it really says that the state is God the United States is now
[1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:18.280]  recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth this
[1:05:18.280 --> 1:05:22.760]  film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now
[1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:27.280]  being expanded nationwide this documentary exposes how the continuity of
[1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:31.280]  government program has established an all-powerful shadow state police state
[1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:35.760]  for chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic is formed prepare to

[1:06:09.040 --> 1:06:13.440]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:27.640]  by the way dr. Jerome course he's got a book coming out on obama and he's gone
[1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:32.520]  all over the world indonesia kenya you name it and they've expunged the records

[1:06:36.440 --> 1:06:41.520]  sataro did give up his u.s. citizenship well that's all over the news today but
[1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:45.120]  I just want to point out that Webster Tarpley we carry both of his books by
[1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:50.520]  the way reported this years ago and in total detail the full spectrum with
[1:06:50.520 --> 1:06:55.400]  Barack H. Obama the unauthorized biography but going to Webster Griffin
[1:06:55.400 --> 1:06:59.720]  Tarpley it was Tarpley several months ago when the Libyan rebellion began that
[1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:04.720]  wrote the articles at tarpley.net we posted them at info wars dot com that
[1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:08.520]  broke down how the State Department was publicly funding these al-qaeda groups
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:12.840]  even the LA Times two days ago admitted NATO al-qaeda Taliban behind
[1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:16.960]  uprising they're now Orwellian terms saying it's peaceful bombs they're
[1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:21.040]  dropping it's humanitarian they're actually taking the ground troops are
[1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:25.160]  going to be humanitarian force with weapons who are going to go out and enter
[1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:29.040]  the city's Qaddafi's in and if he fights back then they're going to bring in a
[1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:33.160]  larger ground force so we've actually entered 1984 and there's a lot of
[1:07:33.160 --> 1:07:38.360]  mainstream news articles now admitting that the full ground invasion is on with
[1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:42.280]  the UN ordering the United States to contribute troops the Marine Corps ships
[1:07:42.280 --> 1:07:46.360]  that are already there more getting into place so Webster Tarpley a huge
[1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:50.720]  development over a month ago you said the Saudis are being double-crossed the
[1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:54.160]  globalists are devaluing the dollar this is a system to overthrow the entire
[1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:57.920]  Middle East now the Saudis as you said months ago except this last year are
[1:07:57.920 --> 1:08:02.440]  running to the Russians running to the Chinese I mean it's incredible Dr.
[1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:06.560]  Tarpley of history and also an economist that you broke all this down now
[1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:11.520]  it's all evident there what does this signify and there's also some mainstream
[1:08:11.520 --> 1:08:16.280]  articles today that the Arab Spring is not going completely well for the
[1:08:16.280 --> 1:08:22.280]  globalist precisely the the basic idea is that you had all of these countries be
[1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:28.280]  it Libya be it Saudi Arabia Pakistan and others lots and lots of countries in
[1:08:28.280 --> 1:08:33.760]  the Empire that we're trying to get out from under this suffocating US British
[1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:38.800]  IMF domination and in order to do that they were playing the Russian card the
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:44.440]  China card the Iranian card or trying to build themselves on this card
[1:08:44.440 --> 1:08:48.800]  it's not quite gonna do it because it's a little bit heterogeneous but yes
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:52.720]  something like that individually the bricks although the bricks as a as an
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:57.760]  entity is not it's not really coherent but specifically now the news is this
[1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:03.320]  Saudi Arabia of course is a huge target of this ultimately you might say Saudi
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:08.040]  Arabia is the main target after Egypt they had to get Egypt out of the way to
[1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:11.760]  go into Libya to bring the weapons in you said months ago Mubarak wasn't playing
[1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:17.160]  ball on that then Saudi Arabia then Iran it's the whole deal right now here's
[1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:21.280]  here's what we've got is an attempt by the Saudis to defend themselves to
[1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:25.920]  maintain their national independence and to stop this this tremendous CIA
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:30.280]  intervention and national endowment for democracy intervention into their
[1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:34.760]  internal affairs at the end of March we have Prince Bandar the head of the
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:39.360]  National Security Council and as far as I can see the dominant personality of
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:45.480]  the whole regime of the royal family going to Pakistan and meeting with the
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:49.920]  Prime Minister of Pakistan Gilani but I'm sure also with the Pakistani army and
[1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:55.120]  the ISI and the Washington Post has had a couple of freak out articles about
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:10:00.240]  this one by Martin Indic the former US ambassador to Israel this is a guy who
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:05.600]  remembers an Australian nationalized here very very strange guy the the idea
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:11.040]  is that the Prince Bandar has arranged that if the US starts a color revolution
[1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:16.680]  inside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia the Pakistanis will send a division or more
[1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:22.240]  of troops to put it down there is a tradition for this in the 1970s 1980s
[1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:27.680]  at various times the Saudis kept a division of Pakistani troops inside
[1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:33.440]  Saudi Arabia for security to put down any eventual rebellions and those were
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:37.280]  the people I think that went into the the holy places that they're in the Hodge
[1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:44.840]  in 1978-79 when when there were some violent incidents there but you can
[1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:50.960]  see the idea that that Bandar is turning to an alliance with Pakistan in order to
[1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:56.440]  defend Saudi Arabia against the US is a kind of strategic revolution up to now
[1:10:56.440 --> 1:11:01.520]  Saudi Arabia has relied on the United States for security but now the people
[1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:06.800]  in around Bandar see obviously that Obama is the main threat that the US
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:11.440]  regime the CIA the NED are the main threat to the internal security of
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:16.120]  Saudi Arabia so they're looking for an option now once you say Pakistan of
[1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:20.360]  course you're also saying nuclear weapons you can say in a certain way it's
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:25.720]  quite possible that Bandar has arranged that Saudi Arabia is now under the
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:31.120]  Pakistani nuclear umbrella this is this is quite a new thing in world affairs
[1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:34.920]  these are two countries Pakistan and Saudi Arabia who have been under the
[1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:40.320]  US yoke totally dominated by the US bombed in the case of Pakistan who are
[1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:43.840]  trying to make a jailbreak and because of globalist treachery they were fully
[1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:47.200]  under the Anglo-American system but because of the attempted over throws
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:52.000]  and assassinations of Ben Isar Budo and others and I've had the former head of
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:55.600]  Pakistani intelligence on confirming this Hameed Ghoul folks doesn't get
[1:11:55.600 --> 1:11:59.280]  anymore I powered out of Pakistan he incurs all the doctor partly is saying
[1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:02.880]  they now know they've been double-crossed the Saudis and again you said this last
[1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:08.520]  year I'm blown away partly by your by your foresight they now admit they're
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:13.000]  being double-crossed same thing six months ago said by our oil company
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  connections through Lindsay Williams and so the globalists were attempting
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:21.640]  through the Rand Corporation Brzezinski model for a global destabilization from
[1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:26.040]  North Africa Middle East into Central Asia as a pretext to move giant forces
[1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:30.840]  in to then menace China and Russia I mean this is an incredibly bold move
[1:12:30.840 --> 1:12:36.040]  actually the first attempt of Bondar the first thing that we did but at least I
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:41.440]  learned about was in July of 2009 I was on your program to call the tension to
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:45.760]  the fact that Bondar was playing the Russian card it made numerous visits to
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:49.240]  Russia he had been meeting with Putin they were talking about Russian
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:55.920]  military assistance also there for Saudi Arabia so that goes back almost two
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:13:00.880]  years and in reality more most likely since then there was a period about a
[1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:05.200]  year when Bondar disappeared from view and we weren't exactly sure what had
[1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:09.880]  happened to him but now the word in various publications is Bondar is back
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:14.280]  and I have to remind people you may still have the idea that Bondar is this
[1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:18.960]  guy who's basically a slave of George Bush the younger Bondar Bush close
[1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:23.120]  friend of the Bush family this is ultimately all irrelevant he's a
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:27.080]  survivor and now it's even in Reuters that the Saudis are saying they're
[1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:31.240]  being double-crossed so he leaves health's arrest he's now back right and
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:34.600]  the house arrest but we have to see whether that was really house arrest or
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:40.440]  not but the the idea now is that if the US starts this color revolution that
[1:13:40.440 --> 1:13:43.800]  there will be Pakistani assistance that you look at look at how the US is
[1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:48.680]  attacking Saudi Arabia one way is through Yemen that entire thing in Yemen
[1:13:48.680 --> 1:13:53.440]  is basically a sideshow the target of everything that happens in Yemen is
[1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:58.600]  Saudi Arabia if you have the split up of Yemen above all the emergence of al-Qaeda
[1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:06.040]  in the Arabian Peninsula AQAP led by Chiri a Guantanamo six-year alumnus
[1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:10.640]  brought in by the United States to run it and of course our dear friend Al-Laki
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:15.960]  the CIA Laki born in New Mexico shipped over obvious double agent those two
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:20.720]  guys one from Guantanamo and one from well from the intelligence community are
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:25.440]  running al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula so that's one source of a huge
[1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:29.920]  destabilization for Saudi Arabia and now that's even admitted in the LA Times in
[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:35.240]  Washington Post they're not even denying this brazenly they think we're so done
[1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:40.040]  they say bombs are humanitarian ground trips are humanitarian al-Qaeda is bad
[1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:44.800]  when we say good when we say simultaneously I mean do you think they
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:49.520]  can really sell this to people well they're trying hard I just wanted to
[1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:53.760]  mention the other angle is Bahrain now Bahrain is this island right it's one of
[1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:58.000]  these little Emirates along what amounts to the coast of Saudi Arabia the
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:03.880]  Gulf Coast the Persian Gulf Arabian Gulf Coast of Saudi Arabia now there we have
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:09.400]  the Saudi troops have intervened in support of the Sunni royal family
[1:15:09.400 --> 1:15:15.400]  against the Shiite protesters this is obviously intended not just it's not
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:19.640]  really a destabilization of Bahrain because the fifth fleet base is there
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:23.200]  there is an angle of putting pressure on the royal family because they don't
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:27.360]  want the base to be used for a war with Iran but Webster I want to be clear it's
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:30.560]  a soft underbelly I want to be clear and it's spread the contagion to Saudi
[1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:34.360]  Arabia I can't stand the corrupt Saudis put in by British Intel a hundred plus
[1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:38.800]  years ago I can't stand Qaddafi the point is why are the globalist moving
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:42.600]  against their allies their old enemies they now admit it's all over the news
[1:15:42.600 --> 1:15:46.760]  that they are destabilizing and the Saudis respond by saying we're gonna
[1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:51.640]  slash oil production and yes we're two days after they met with Gates and tried
[1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:56.360]  to make a deal the Secretary of Defense they did run to Russia and China and so
[1:15:56.360 --> 1:16:01.520]  this could be a big miscalculation by the Anglo-American globalist when you're
[1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:08.280]  out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but if the
[1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:13.320]  unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets there's a

[1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:16.520]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:20.880]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:24.960]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:17:24.960 --> 1:17:29.520]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:33.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:14.280]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in
[1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:18.880]  this influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:24.160]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:28.160]  attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:33.360]  criminal off-short cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:37.000]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:40.560]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:45.800]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[1:20:06.960 --> 1:20:11.120]  Broadcasting Network
[1:20:11.120 --> 1:20:24.200]  the idea I think is that these countries are targeted not because of their
[1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:27.880]  internal regimes and of course the Saudi internal regime is quite
[1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:33.200]  distasteful to put it mildly but the main issue is that they're attempting to
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:38.440]  rebel against Anglo-American domination I think globalism is not exactly the
[1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:42.760]  right term this is US British imperialism that's all that ever was
[1:20:42.760 --> 1:20:47.320]  globalism implies that there's a place at the table for Russia or China and so
[1:20:47.320 --> 1:20:51.040]  forth and it's not those companies are all targeted they're all ultimately on
[1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:55.040]  the heaving end of color revolutions. Well Webster we're gonna skip this
[1:20:55.040 --> 1:20:59.080]  network break so stations should carry this and I don't want to get fighting
[1:20:59.080 --> 1:21:03.080]  going on here but I really respect your foresight your understanding but it's
[1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:08.760]  admitted now again we read three mainstream news articles yesterday LA
[1:21:08.760 --> 1:21:13.800]  Times you name it admitting that okay the West did orchestrate this in Egypt
[1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:19.280]  in Libya in Syria the State Department admits I mean they're doing all of this
[1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:25.040]  and then I get Lenin Lerougeon for the first time ever and I think he's got a
[1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:28.320]  lot of interesting ideas and you know it's right about the Anglo-American
[1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:32.880]  system and almost 90 years old and you know a very distinguished person but
[1:21:32.880 --> 1:21:37.360]  when I brought it up to him that this was all a Western destabilization program
[1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:41.400]  at the time it was admitted it was he basically said it was a real revolution
[1:21:41.400 --> 1:21:45.360]  now I understand the people have real reasons to be upset and the globalists
[1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:49.800]  recognize that climate politically and then triggered it but it's not debatable
[1:21:49.800 --> 1:21:53.560]  that they've triggered it and and off air you were mentioning that to me do you
[1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:57.280]  have any statements about it well it certainly the thing that Lerougeon was
[1:21:57.280 --> 1:22:01.800]  saying was that this was all genuine and spontaneous and I think that is
[1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:08.520]  absolutely wrong it the grievances are real the potential was real just as the
[1:22:08.520 --> 1:22:14.080]  potential under Metternich in in in Europe in 1848 was real but the
[1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:20.640]  detonation and then the shaping the leadership the program and the general
[1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:26.720]  direction of these things is totally provided by the CIA MI6 and and any day
[1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:30.360]  I found it was interesting when you asked Lerougeon that he immediately dodged the
[1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:33.840]  question he said the only thing I can say about it is it's all totally
[1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:40.600]  spontaneous and in 1782 the King of France made a mistake now the 1782 King
[1:22:40.600 --> 1:22:45.080]  of France made a mistake actually leads to an argument that the French
[1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:50.560]  Revolution was actually a destabilization of France provoked and
[1:22:50.560 --> 1:22:53.840]  promoted by the British but it was let me let me stop you this has all been
[1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:57.240]  declassified by the British if you read mainline history you're a doctorate of
[1:22:57.240 --> 1:23:02.220]  it but the general public doesn't know that it's on record that the South had
[1:23:02.220 --> 1:23:06.760]  real grievances they had them two decades two decades before we are two
[1:23:06.760 --> 1:23:12.000]  and a half decades earlier with Andrew Jackson they had real tariff issues the
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:17.640]  slavery you know was never an issue that's just a modern fiction but the
[1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:21.800]  British were in there openly manipulating the South and then stationing
[1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:26.560]  troops in Canada threatening to invade that's all mainline history this is the
[1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:31.480]  grand stratagem great game right now I was actually talking about about the
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:34.960]  French Revolution not not so much the American Civil War but it did I know I
[1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:40.480]  know but I mentioned the French and then I shifted gears yeah of course the
[1:23:40.480 --> 1:23:44.920]  the the the Confederate States of America was a project that was that was
[1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:49.200]  detonated and promoted by Lord Palmer's been Lord John Muscle British
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:53.960]  intelligence and so forth support for this in a certain way comes from
[1:23:53.960 --> 1:23:58.160]  unexpected quarters Jeff Steinberg that you recently had on your program has
[1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:04.400]  been following Bondar for two years back in July of 2009 when Bondar was playing
[1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:08.600]  the Russian card and beginning this attempt to free Saudi Arabia from total
[1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:14.080]  US domination this is the precisely the moment that Steinberg chose to attack
[1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:20.200]  Bondar for various issues about scandals and 9-11 and and so forth really
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:23.720]  those those pretext meaning meaning not very much but mainly the idea attacked
[1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:28.520]  Bondar and now precisely at the time when Bondar is preparing his trip to
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:33.200]  Pakistan which really means an opening to China we have Steinberg again
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:38.760]  attacking him and in the pages of that magazine on in this case it's an article
[1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:43.360]  that says the two worst guys in the Middle East are Bondar and Gaddafi now
[1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:47.400]  isn't that interesting this coincides precisely with the two main people that
[1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:52.160]  the that the US and the British are concerned about in the region so that's
[1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:56.960]  a very very interesting pattern that we have there but the general idea I think
[1:24:56.960 --> 1:25:02.080]  is clear but if Bondar goes to Pakistan this is a little bit like Nixon going to
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:05.720]  China right you the way you go to China is sometimes through Pakistan that's our
[1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:10.280]  Nixon did it 40 years ago maybe that's how Bondar is doing it in a certain sense
[1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:15.680]  once you're in an alliance with Pakistan you will you're also then connected to
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:20.040]  Pakistan's ally China and I would assume that Bondar has kept up his
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:25.640]  connections to Putin and to Russia now this gives us Russia Saudi Arabia
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:31.120]  Pakistan and China now that's a coherent alliance that's a step beyond the
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:36.120]  Shanghai Cooperation Organization and certainly way beyond the bricks the
[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:39.840]  bricks that that have just been meeting that's an interesting group but in
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:44.440]  terms of strategy you've got the fact that India sitting right in the middle is
[1:25:44.440 --> 1:25:49.680]  essentially an ally of the US against China so they may agree economically but
[1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:54.200]  strategically I don't see how they will if we have Russia Saudi Arabia Pakistan
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:58.960]  and China that could become something that would be strategic and military but
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:02.880]  it could also become monetary and economic that is a better than alliance
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:07.680]  with real world-shaping potential and again it's much stronger than these
[1:26:07.680 --> 1:26:13.280]  sort of things that we've seen so far now we are seeing press reports admitting
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:17.200]  that the West is involved in all this but that it's not going well how do you
[1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:21.760]  see this ending right now well let me just one other scenario is this guy
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:26.840]  Michael shoyer from the CIA of course CIA veteran was the bin Laden desk I've
[1:26:26.840 --> 1:26:30.720]  always called them the head of the bin Laden fan club in Langley he's on
[1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:36.160]  television saying that if the Saudis crack down in Bahrain and start killing
[1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:41.840]  Shiites then the Iranians will invade Bahrain and essentially be at war with
[1:26:41.840 --> 1:26:47.800]  Saudi Arabia and therefore the US will have to intervene again that's the
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:51.880]  Brzezinski dream of the kamikaze event playing them off against each other
[1:26:51.880 --> 1:26:55.520]  right but you can see what he's doing he's speaking very bluntly but the whole
[1:26:55.520 --> 1:26:59.960]  idea of this is to scare Saudi Arabia back onto the plantation right back on
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:06.800]  to the US imperial ship the thing in Libya that you've been mentioning the
[1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:12.360]  news this morning is that British French and Italian advisors are going to be
[1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:17.040]  present on the ground in Libya with this al-Qaeda infantry right but they've
[1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:21.320]  always been there now they're beefing the force right precisely that they're
[1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:24.160]  now they're going to be there openly they've been there for six or seven
[1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:28.720]  weeks since since probably the middle of February and and even earlier so this
[1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:32.240]  looks like we should creep very interesting anniversary we just had the
[1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:37.560]  50th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs and it's exactly parallel except that when
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:44.960]  Alan Dulles and his crackpots of the CIA invaded Cuba in in April of 1961 when
[1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:50.840]  the first phase failed when the irregular forces that failed to to get an
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:55.840]  insurrection in Cuba Kennedy was then asked by Alan Dulles we you know we
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:28:00.400]  need air support we need actual invasion with Marines and Kennedy said to him
[1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:03.720]  no I'm not giving you the air support I'm not giving you the Marines and by the
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:07.300]  way you're fired that was a real president well it came out even on
[1:28:07.300 --> 1:28:13.760]  nightline excuse me frontline that they fired him he fired that whole group when
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:17.280]  they brought him north woods and said let's stage terror attacks and blame it
[1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:21.240]  on Cuba to invade right the number of causes but certainly within it within
[1:28:21.240 --> 1:28:25.560]  what a year after the Bay of Pigs Alan Dulles was out on his ear tremendous
[1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:29.880]  hatred in the CIA for Kennedy ever since but what happens now in this case
[1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:34.080]  Libby is same example you've got a secret army in this case that's by El
[1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:40.560]  Qaeda terrorist that you've released from Guantanamo and they failed to overwhelm
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:45.760]  Gaddafi so now we have the second phase what you never saw in the Bay of Pigs
[1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:50.000]  you are seeing now you are seeing the mission creep that happens when you
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:54.640]  don't have a real president and the CIA comes back and says look our our secret
[1:28:54.640 --> 1:28:59.600]  army is not working we need boots on the ground we need we need air strikes we
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:04.000]  need all this stuff over the last year Alex has told you about and many of you

[1:33:45.440 --> 1:33:48.560]  Before we go back to him, I want to give you a few program notes.
[1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:57.440]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and InfoWars.com readers, there's a new article out at InfoWars.com

[1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:09.400]  as well right now.
[1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:10.960]  Very important information.
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:16.960]  Yesterday morning we put out a video that's got more honors than any recent video we've
[1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:17.960]  put out.
[1:34:17.960 --> 1:34:22.400]  It's got more than 20 honors all over the world and it's one of the top videos on the

[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:35.200]  It's titled, Alex Jones Joins the New World Order and it says at the bottom of the video
[1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:41.680]  that it's satire and it's clearly satire and some of my detractors of course have picked
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:43.840]  it up and say it's real.
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:45.160]  They know it's not real.
[1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:46.840]  They're going after weak-minded people.
[1:34:46.840 --> 1:34:48.920]  I didn't join the New World Order.
[1:34:48.920 --> 1:34:49.920]  It's satire.

[1:37:07.040 --> 1:37:12.800]  Okay, shifting gears now to Gerald Salente.
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:23.520]  And Gerald Salente is one of the leading, if not the leading, long-term trend forecasters.
[1:37:23.520 --> 1:37:29.160]  And he said early last year, he said by the end of 2010, the U.S. will be technically
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:31.520]  bankrupt and will be in a depression.
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:36.040]  Now, most of the other economists and analysts we interviewed at that time said, yes, we
[1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:41.240]  are now at the point of no return, the dollar has been devalued, commodities are going up,
[1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:44.520]  we never left the recession, we're in a depression.
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:48.600]  But we're now under 21st century mind control where they tell us the economy is rebounded
[1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:54.360]  and is great, even though S&P has come out and said that it's a negative outlook on
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:37:58.360]  the U.S. keeping its credit rating will basically become like a third world nation.
[1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:03.000]  The Chinese are dumping the dollar at record rates, the Saudis know they've been double
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:07.280]  crossed with the attempted military overthrow by the globalists there and surrounding them.
[1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:14.000]  So they've said that demand is low, so they're cutting production with demands of an all-time
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:15.400]  high.
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:19.480]  There's no doubt we're in the first stages of a serious economic depression.
[1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:21.800]  And Gerald Salente was right.
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:27.040]  But it's just like people send me emails and media makes jokes, Jones says buy gold.
[1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:28.040]  What a coo.
[1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:29.040]  They actually say this.
[1:38:29.040 --> 1:38:33.000]  Merce said buy it at 216, now it's 1510 bucks.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:37.120]  He said buy silver when it was five, now it's 46 plus.
[1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:43.240]  It's like saying, man, this guy told you your house was on fire and it was on fire.
[1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:44.240]  He's a nut.
[1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:49.840]  I mean, we've entered a la-la land world where they tell us the war in Libya isn't a war.
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:53.080]  Ground troops on the ground isn't a ground war and there won't be a ground war, though
[1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:57.320]  they say it's a ground war, but it isn't a ground war.
[1:38:57.320 --> 1:39:01.920]  They've raised the radiation levels between 1,000 to 100,000 times what they say was safe
[1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:08.000]  previously because we have over 500 times safe levels in cesium, cesium and radioactive
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:09.960]  iodine 131.
[1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:18.600]  We are now entering a la-la land Orwellville that is so bizarre where they knowingly think
[1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:24.840]  the public's dumbed down and continue to tell us that up is down, down is up, black is white.
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:27.680]  Old Salente, how do you quantify what's happening?
[1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:30.680]  Has civilization gone crazy?
[1:39:30.680 --> 1:39:34.960]  Everything is the presidential reality show.
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:37.240]  People have lost their minds.
[1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:43.320]  They become prescription drug addicted and fast food fattened.
[1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:45.400]  America doesn't have a fight anymore.
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:49.160]  As I mentioned to you, you know, people say, oh, you're a gloom and doomer.
[1:39:49.160 --> 1:39:57.800]  I had came out with Trends 2000, my book back in 1997, a Warner book, and I was so optimistic
[1:39:57.800 --> 1:40:03.320]  about the nation, you know, people were talking about moving forward in positive ways.
[1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:06.400]  And as you said, you know, up is down and down is up.
[1:40:06.400 --> 1:40:13.960]  They don't call a war in Libya a war, it's what, a time-limited, scope-limited action.
[1:40:13.960 --> 1:40:20.600]  The UK is now sending over, quote, advisers and Italy and France officers.
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:22.120]  You know, what am I, six years old?
[1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:24.000]  And they were already there months ago.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:25.240]  They were there before it started.
[1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:27.760]  Well, I know, but now they're admitting it.
[1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:31.040]  But they're putting these white shoe boy names on them.
[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:32.040]  You know, advisers.
[1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:34.200]  Yes, they call the Vietnam War.
[1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:36.280]  Hey, remember Korean War?
[1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:37.760]  That was a police action.
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:39.720]  You know, nothing's really changed.
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:41.480]  It's only getting worse.
[1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:45.760]  And as you're talking about the economy, you know, I read something from Jim Sinclair.
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:47.280]  He really put it well.
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:52.160]  He said something to the effect of Orwell's 1984, you know, how they used to keep blasting
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:55.560]  out these messages and putting them on the big screen.
[1:40:55.560 --> 1:41:01.720]  He said, now, you know, the business networks are the 1984, putting out the propaganda.
[1:41:01.720 --> 1:41:03.240]  And that's all it is.
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:06.720]  It's more propaganda on top of all propaganda.
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:09.520]  They won't call a spade a spade.
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:13.760]  Everybody knows that the only reason that this economy is keeping up at any level at
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:19.280]  all is because of all the digital money that they've dumped into the system, the trillions.
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:20.400]  Look what gold is doing.
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:23.480]  You mentioned I called gold at 275.
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:25.440]  You called it at 260.
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:26.440]  And look where it is now.
[1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:29.800]  Oh, and by the way, here's one for you.
[1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:32.440]  Go to Forbes magazine.
[1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:34.120]  They did a big story on me.
[1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:35.120]  You know what they called it?
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:39.240]  They called it something about doomsayers of forecasting.
[1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:45.240]  And we had forecast at that time, gold was around $720 an ounce.
[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:50.280]  They interviewed my assistant, but when she came to work for us, for us, a bond company
[1:41:50.280 --> 1:41:51.280]  went bust.
[1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:55.880]  She cashed out all her 401ks and put it into gold.
[1:41:55.880 --> 1:41:59.680]  And then now remember, gold is about 725 at the time.
[1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:02.640]  It's more than doubled since then a few years ago.
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:03.640]  Exactly.
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:05.440]  So now they write this.
[1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:12.880]  Well, you know, Sollenty's a doom and gloomer and gold could go down as easily go down below
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:13.880]  fall.
[1:42:13.880 --> 1:42:14.880]  No, that's what I'm saying.
[1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:17.440]  We're bad because we're right.
[1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:22.640]  So now we contacted these little weasels that Forbes.
[1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:27.120]  This guy would be nothing if his daddy didn't have any money, right?
[1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:29.360]  Now, you know, he's the big mouth out there.
[1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:31.960]  Do you know they won't even write a retraction.
[1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:34.360]  They won't even say that we're right.
[1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:41.040]  After they took a cheap shot at me, that flabbermouth out there, he's all over the place, Sollenty
[1:42:41.040 --> 1:43:01.040]  was right, Forbes was wrong.
[1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:03.040]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons.
[1:43:03.040 --> 1:43:05.680]  You should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:10.040]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:14.360]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:15.680]  allows you to have.
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:16.680]  It's true.
[1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:21.360]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:43:21.360 --> 1:43:25.680]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:43:25.680 --> 1:43:29.680]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:33.160]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:43:33.160 --> 1:43:36.880]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:41.520]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:45.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:46.800]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:19.440]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[1:44:19.440 --> 1:44:29.040]  I'm worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:34.760]  I'm looking for America.
[1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:36.440]  Wear American and be proud.

[1:44:40.280 --> 1:45:05.200]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies
[1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:08.000]  and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.400]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:12.760]  Folks, this is Steve Shank with E-Foods Direct.
[1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:17.280]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:19.040]  You must act automatically.
[1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:22.480]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[1:45:22.480 --> 1:45:23.680]  No time to think.
[1:45:23.680 --> 1:45:24.680]  Just act automatically.
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:29.480]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds or the knock comes on your door.
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:33.640]  You'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:38.760]  You need a five-day extreme emergency kit with serious supplies and real food to secure
[1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:40.560]  to adults for five days.
[1:45:40.560 --> 1:45:47.400]  This powerful $300 extreme emergency kit is free with an order of at least $995 from

[1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:05.800]  Tyranny is here.
[1:46:05.800 --> 1:46:09.680]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:12.120]  It really says that the state is God.
[1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:16.680]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[1:46:16.680 --> 1:46:17.920]  on earth.
[1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:22.760]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:24.560]  expanded nationwide.
[1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:28.840]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:30.480]  powerful shadow state.
[1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:34.680]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[1:46:34.680 --> 1:46:39.120]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:44.960]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[1:46:44.960 --> 1:46:48.440]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[1:46:48.440 --> 1:46:50.480]  The police state isn't coming.
[1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:51.880]  It's here.

[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:24.560]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run.
[1:47:24.560 --> 1:47:32.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:47:32.880 --> 1:47:45.240]  Look, look at the numbers, home real estate values are down to worst and great depression
[1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:46.240]  levels.
[1:47:46.240 --> 1:47:48.160]  How's that for a depression era level?
[1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:55.040]  Go to John Williams shadow statistics, look up the unemployment rate, it's around 22%.
[1:47:55.040 --> 1:47:59.920]  Here try this one on Alex, yeah there's a recovery, you know where the recovery is coming
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:00.920]  from?
[1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:10.600]  10% of the population in the United States owns 90% of all the stocks, all the bonds,
[1:48:10.600 --> 1:48:16.480]  all the mutual funds, 5% owns 63% of everything.
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:23.960]  No, there's not a depression, oh in the meanwhile out there, everybody's wages have declined,
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:29.520]  oh but there's not inflation out there, oh no, they cooked those numbers too.
[1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:33.280]  Of course there's a depression going on, people are losing everything.
[1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:37.360]  Alright, I want to go back because you can always remember what journal, what date and
[1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:42.760]  people can go to your website and pull it up and see it for themselves but I remember
[1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:48.200]  over a year ago because it was early 2010, you said it's going to be clear that it's
[1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:52.840]  a depression by the end of the year and it's clear a few months ago and you said there's
[1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:57.560]  going to be war and it's going to be in the Middle East, it's going to be in Central Asia
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:03.080]  and you absolutely called it, what journal was that so people can go to Trends Research?
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:10.960]  The Spring 2010 Trends Journal, it was the Great War and then this past autumn we came
[1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:17.840]  out with off with their heads 2.0 and the Trends Journal had just came out yesterday,
[1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:25.440]  the whole issue is devoted to the first great war of the 21st century.
[1:49:25.440 --> 1:49:30.680]  You put all the pieces together, Alex, when you're talking about the police state we're
[1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:37.080]  living in because they know it's happening, it's out of control and the last thing they're
[1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:42.160]  going to do is to control us, that's all the plan.
[1:49:42.160 --> 1:49:54.000]  Look, Libya is not a one off, Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Yemen, Algeria, Morocco, Syria, Jordan.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  How did you know?
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:56.920]  How did you know?
[1:49:56.920 --> 1:50:02.200]  Because the whole, you know I know for the same reason Bernie Madoff knew.
[1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:08.600]  Bernie Madoff did an interview recently and he said what we've been saying all along.
[1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:11.800]  It's nothing more than one big Ponzi scheme.
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:17.920]  When they came out with the top bailouts in 2008 we sent out a trend alert and we said
[1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:24.720]  in that trend alert that when all else fails they take you to war.
[1:50:24.720 --> 1:50:26.480]  That's what's going on.
[1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:31.800]  They can't bail out any more European banks, oh and by the way this hardly made the news.
[1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:37.800]  As you know Finland just voted in a new party, they're not going to be party to the bailouts.
[1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:43.880]  If all the European nations, the emunations don't go into the bailouts it doesn't happen.
[1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:45.720]  Where are they, what's a bailout by the way?
[1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:48.240]  Oh here's a bailout for you, what bailout?
[1:50:48.240 --> 1:50:49.960]  How about bailing in?
[1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:51.920]  They give you more debt.
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:54.800]  They cannot handle the debt.
[1:50:54.800 --> 1:50:59.800]  Well the bankers get the money and then we get to pay them interest for the right to
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:02.640]  give them money, that's how sick this is.
[1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:11.040]  The Wall Street Journal reports today a 77% profit in 2010 for General Electric who basically
[1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:18.360]  runs the White House Economic Council and paid zero corporate tax ladies and gentlemen
[1:51:18.360 --> 1:51:28.160]  and it's GE and their MSNBC scapegoating the middle class, Alex Jones, Gerald Solente,
[1:51:28.160 --> 1:51:35.200]  doctors, lawyers, professors, we're being scapegoated and told we've got to pay more
[1:51:35.200 --> 1:51:40.640]  to quote fix the debt but the money that we pay goes right to the bankers.
[1:51:40.640 --> 1:51:46.760]  Exactly and that's why we came off with the off with their heads trends journal and that's
[1:51:46.760 --> 1:51:48.840]  what's going on in Europe.
[1:51:48.840 --> 1:51:55.040]  The only reason why Europe hasn't imploded yet like the Middle East is because there
[1:51:55.040 --> 1:52:01.960]  in the Middle East people have the autocrats, the monarchs, the dictators, in Europe they're
[1:52:01.960 --> 1:52:07.760]  still living under the illusion that they have a democracy.
[1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:13.760]  So like in Ireland they just put in another criminal group to replace the other criminal
[1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:20.880]  group, they're still living under the illusion that you can change it in the ballot box.
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:25.880]  Let me stop you, the system knows the illusion is wearing thin and so now everything we've
[1:52:25.880 --> 1:52:30.520]  told people about because it was public is now being announced, not just Apple, all smart
[1:52:30.520 --> 1:52:36.960]  phones under federal law, telecommunications act of 96, track you in real time, upload
[1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:43.040]  your location, give them all your data, police all over the country, I have wireless systems
[1:52:43.040 --> 1:52:47.040]  with back doors, they don't even hack it, they get into your phone and steal everything
[1:52:47.040 --> 1:52:48.480]  off of it, they're just doing it.
[1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:53.840]  They pull you over for speeding, grab your phone without a warrant, plug it in, steal
[1:52:53.840 --> 1:52:59.720]  your data, TSA doing the same thing when you try to fly, steal your laptop data, I mean
[1:52:59.720 --> 1:53:06.080]  they are so criminal Gerald and you go back last year, Bloomberg reports, 11 years ago,
[1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:11.240]  secret deal signed, veterans affairs with the big insurance companies to secretly steal
[1:53:11.240 --> 1:53:16.000]  the life insurance money of world war through vets, through current vets, I mean to even
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:23.160]  get my mind around how unbelievably criminal they are and that they've been authorized
[1:53:23.160 --> 1:53:29.000]  to do it, it staggers the imagination that they're going for broke, they've committed
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:31.880]  so many crimes Gerald, they're not going to stop.
[1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:37.720]  Alex, you know that I was one of the first people when they started all these bailouts
[1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:43.560]  on the bush and they continued under Obama and they called it socialism and Marxism,
[1:53:43.560 --> 1:53:50.400]  I said no it's not, it's fascism, fascism has come to America, the merger of state
[1:53:50.400 --> 1:53:56.640]  and corporate powers, you just talked about GE, do you have to go any further than that,
[1:53:56.640 --> 1:54:00.960]  you could keep going down the line, you're talking about all the apps and everything
[1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:07.120]  else with how the companies are all working in tandem together to rob us, fascism has
[1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:16.720]  come to America, here try this one on, I unilaterally decided that our core interests
[1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:24.840]  and that of our allies are at stake, so we're going to bomb Libya, what ever happened to
[1:54:24.840 --> 1:54:28.720]  we the people, that's a really, you know, an arcane concept.
[1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:30.920]  Whatever happened to Congress is illegal.
[1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:38.680]  Exactly, but they're saying it's gone, it's over and that's what our issue is, the first
[1:54:38.680 --> 1:54:48.600]  great war and what we're telling people to do is to prepare, survive and prevail because
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:56.240]  people better grow up here, the game is over, look what they're doing, now they're putting
[1:54:56.240 --> 1:55:02.960]  the guise of war as humanitarian missions, you know, at least Bush called it a preemptive
[1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:10.240]  issue, now they're taking us to war under the guise of humanitarian and they're using
[1:55:10.240 --> 1:55:16.560]  that again as part of the nomenclature and it's exactly right, the traders are amongst
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:22.400]  us and the people, again the people have lost the fight in this country, I just read an
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:31.360]  article about in Ohio for example, there are more kids dying from overdosing on prescription
[1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:37.720]  drug painkillers than an auto accident, it's a drunk driving, you know, so that the whole
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:44.480]  morality of the nation is being rotted out, I was mentioning before the break about what
[1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:53.360]  I read today, Hillary Clinton chastising Gaddafi for using, it's allegedly using cluster bombs
[1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:58.040]  and I said to myself, wow that's interesting, how about all that depleted uranium, the United
[1:55:58.040 --> 1:56:05.760]  States dumped all over Iraq, oh that's okay, and now Libya, oh yeah and how about Israel,
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:11.800]  you know, bombing Lebanon with cluster bombs, oh not a peep about that, you know, so they
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:17.160]  have, oh and how about those predator drones, listen Gaddafi's a rookie, I mean he should
[1:56:17.160 --> 1:56:25.760]  be picking up America's atrocities, could you imagine if they had a Abu Ghrae in Libya,
[1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:31.000]  how they would be talking about that and the mainstream media, you know what I've come
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:38.160]  up with the name for them, they're nothing more than prostitutes, they're whores for
[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:47.280]  the people in power, it's the revolving door, you have this guy, Karni, James Karni, the
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:53.320]  White House spokesperson, hey where did he come from, he's Time Magazine, he couldn't
[1:56:53.320 --> 1:56:58.440]  have been a Yali could he, you really mean Harvard, Princeton Yali, bullets, bombs and
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:07.320]  banks, so the whole thing Alex, it is a world order and all you have to do to see the proof
[1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:17.160]  is to see who took most of the money from the Fed discount window, foreign banks, what's
[1:57:17.160 --> 1:57:23.920]  Fed money going to bail out foreign banks, $20 trillion worth of back end deals on the
[1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:31.840]  other end going to Bank of Scotland, Japan to the Deutsche Bank on and on, so anybody
[1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:37.760]  that, I used to say I had this new world order, come on, the golden rule, those who have the
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:47.320]  gold rule and the gold is coming out of our pockets, stealing stolen by the Fed and spread
[1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:53.800]  over to the other world banks that are running the show, hi folks this is Alex Jones, I'm

[1:58:50.600 --> 1:58:55.040]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator,
[1:58:55.040 --> 1:58:59.600]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill, number
[1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:04.240]  two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[1:59:04.240 --> 1:59:09.840]  you to have, it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:59:09.840 --> 1:59:15.080]  is coming, number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:59:15.080 --> 1:59:20.280]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem, number four dangerous
[1:59:20.280 --> 1:59:24.480]  weather is always a threat to local grids, every year thousands of families lose their
[1:59:24.480 --> 1:59:29.120]  power from weather related onages, number five a solar power generator provides powerful
[1:59:29.120 --> 1:59:33.240]  backup insurance and peace of mind, folks I really believe in the solar power generators
