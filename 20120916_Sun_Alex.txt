[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.500 --> 00:09.500]  Waging war on corruption
[00:09.500 --> 00:33.500]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War
[00:33.500 --> 00:57.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this worldwide Sunday transmission. Events dictate that I'd be absolutely focused, cogent and on target today because undoubtedly we are entering a phase in human civilization that is one of the most dangerous, if not the most dangerous, we have ever faced as a society.
[00:57.500 --> 01:11.500]  We are going to be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday evening, four to six p.m. central and back of course tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m. central, 12 noon Eastern for the three hour weekday transmission.
[01:11.500 --> 01:37.500]  Obviously on the radar today, QE infinity hyperinflation. Another big ratings agency now lowers we were triple a double a now a minus for the US dollar, Federal Reserve running the Republic into the ground, a foreign banking cartel that has captured this nation to a great extent.
[01:37.500 --> 01:53.500]  They don't have full control. They've got control over monetary and over most of the federal government and the state government. So we've got that information coming up and obviously when you get ready for the big collapse, not this ongoing slide.
[01:53.500 --> 02:10.500]  What do globalists do they start big wars. That's 101 of geopolitical imperial operations. We are now entering that with the whole situation in the Middle East going up in flames. The dead ambassador, the political hyping of all this.
[02:10.500 --> 02:19.500]  Obama's UN ambassador making utterly ridiculous statements today that this was not a coordinated attack on the embassy in Libya.
[02:19.500 --> 02:28.500]  That's like saying the sun didn't come up this morning and all the political back and forth that's happening with that. All of it.
[02:28.500 --> 02:51.500]  Pales and significance quite frankly because we can handle financial degradation. We can handle Muslims burning down cities. What we cannot handle is a nuclear war with Russia or China and many top generals, many top analysts are on records saying this could easily get out of hand and turn into a World War three scenario.
[02:51.500 --> 03:03.500]  The world's much more dangerous than it was at the height of the so called Cold War. That's not just Alex Jones saying that. That's a big Nebrazinski. That's people like Webster Tarpoli. That's countless others.
[03:03.500 --> 03:17.500]  The magnitude of what we're facing. Now you remember two months ago and the videos and articles went viral. I said the preparations are being made for martial law in late October, early September.
[03:17.500 --> 03:26.500]  And you heard the police officers call in breakdown crying and saying we've been told prepare for total breakdown. Prepare to call in Air Force airstrikes and the American people.
[03:26.500 --> 03:34.500]  Prepare to totally cordon and round people up military speaking out army manuals publicly released for reeducation camps.
[03:34.500 --> 03:41.500]  The government is running around like a chicken with their head cut off right out here at the Austin airport, former sack base.
[03:41.500 --> 03:51.500]  They've leased areas all around it with the military. Every city is the same. Every major key strategic city. They're digging in.
[03:51.500 --> 03:59.500]  More than they did at the height of the Cold War in the 50 60 70s. Okay, they're running around like it's the end of the world.
[03:59.500 --> 04:06.500]  Now I've said hey 2012 and I don't believe in the Mayan stuff. That's all a bunch of bull. But the globalist, they believe in stuff like that.
[04:06.500 --> 04:17.500]  They're a bunch of occultist lunatics. All I can tell you is my family's getting ready. This is real.
[04:17.500 --> 04:24.500]  I mean, I've told my crew out there this isn't a game. They know it's not a game. Let me tell you, this is the real deal.
[04:24.500 --> 04:32.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, when our ancestors faced the start of World War One and World War Two, if this thing kicks off will look like a walk in the park.
[04:32.500 --> 04:42.500]  And I'm talking to high level generals, former top spies. You name it, they're scared. They're scared.
[04:42.500 --> 04:49.500]  Okay, this is serious. We're going to be back in 60 seconds. I'm going to lay it all out. Stay with us.
[04:49.500 --> 04:54.500]  We're going to be back in 60 seconds.
[05:20.500 --> 05:28.500]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen. If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[05:28.500 --> 05:35.500]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network. You'll also find it in FullWarshop.com.
[05:35.500 --> 05:53.500]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up. We're also carrying behind the green mask, You in Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey. This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover. The greater good, the most professional and up to date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[05:53.500 --> 06:08.500]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[06:23.500 --> 06:52.500]  I feel like saying a prayer at the beginning of this broadcast. Something I've never done. I don't know how I get people to pay attention. I mean really pay attention.
[06:52.500 --> 07:10.500]  Just how much danger this world is in right now. Just how hardcore this corporate banking world government is and just how sinister they are. They are playing civilizations, nations, groups off against each other.
[07:10.500 --> 07:25.500]  And that is the important thing to know and understand. Again, thank you for joining us on this 16th day of September, 2012. I am your host, Alex Jones. I have, of course, the syndicated broadcast.
[07:25.500 --> 07:43.500]  Carried by XM on 166 weekdays from 12 noon to 3pm Eastern on over 115 AM and FM affiliates. And then we also come back Sundays for the Sunday transmission, 4 to 6pm Central, 5 to 7 Eastern, 2 to 4 Pacific, 3 to 5 Mountain.
[07:43.500 --> 07:56.500]  We are broadcasting worldwide on global shortwave, WWCR and of course on several satellite systems as well as the audio streams at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[07:56.500 --> 08:19.500]  Okay, you know about the Middle East going up in flames. You know about US troops getting killed all over the Middle East and Africa and Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan. You know about the embassy being attacked in Benghazi and the US ambassador being killed.
[08:19.500 --> 08:28.500]  You know about the announcement by the private Federal Reserve of quantitative easing unlimited or quantitative easing infinity.
[08:28.500 --> 08:42.500]  Obviously, most of you know about the massive domestic arms buildup by the federal government against the American people, the 1.4 billion bullets the last year, the giant armored vehicles by the hundreds ordered every few months.
[08:42.500 --> 08:53.500]  The mobile armored pillboxes, the staging of military supplies including treaded tanks in every major US city by the thousands spread out across the United States.
[08:53.500 --> 09:08.500]  This is a buildup for World War III. But not the type of war our daddies or granddaddies fought. This is a globalist banker directed war against the nation states so they can have us basically battle it out.
[09:08.500 --> 09:21.500]  All controlled and run by the very same global banking system. They brag about this by the way they write books about it. They put out policy papers. It's not hidden. They just think you're so stupid.
[09:21.500 --> 09:32.500]  And only watch you know the television news programs and that you'll never even understand it. That's their arrogance and that may be their undoing. Let's hope.
[09:32.500 --> 09:47.500]  Now we do have Dr. Steve Pachennick, who is the person who helped co-write many of Tom Clancy's books. He is the person that the character of Mr. Ryan is based on from Patriot games.
[09:47.500 --> 09:53.500]  And I'm not going to get into his whole bio, but he's overthrown governments run assassination squads all over the world.
[09:53.500 --> 10:04.500]  And as a psychiatrist and among other things. And we have him on occasionally as you know. He'd been talking to me the last few days quite a bit.
[10:04.500 --> 10:12.500]  And what shocked me is I called up Webster Tarpley. Dr. Tarpley also lives there in D.C. and has his ear to the ground.
[10:12.500 --> 10:24.500]  And the two men basically told me pretty much the same thing, which was what I had also basically from the research understood.
[10:24.500 --> 10:28.500]  So they're going to be joining us coming up about 20 minutes. Dr. Pachennick's going to join us.
[10:28.500 --> 10:36.500]  And then we're going to have Dr. Tarpley on after that to give us his perspective on all this.
[10:36.500 --> 10:46.500]  But you're not going to get just talking points here and mindlessness. So if you're a new listener and you want to really know what's going on in the world, you're going to get it here.
[10:46.500 --> 10:54.500]  Okay. As close as you're going to get to it. Not because I'm that smart. The mainline system lies to you on purpose.
[10:54.500 --> 11:00.500]  Okay. It's not hard to actually know what's going on if you study this stuff.
[11:00.500 --> 11:13.500]  From a historical perspective and actually follow the continuum of developments and read the memoirs of globalists and spies and foreign memoirs and research.
[11:13.500 --> 11:25.500]  Let me just boil it down to you very, very simply. There are six global banks that are above the law that have created 1,500 trillion plus in global derivatives just based on the dollar.
[11:25.500 --> 11:35.500]  It's fraudulent counterfeit money. They've sold it to the Russians, the Chinese, the Americans, to your police pension fund, to the school pension fund, to the private pension funds, everything.
[11:35.500 --> 11:43.500]  It infects everything by design. They have gotten all the governments with their operatives that they've worked for decades to get into place.
[11:43.500 --> 11:52.500]  Shining us onto their debt and the media tells us that it's our debt when over 90% of it is not even national debt or personal debt. It's their debt. It's fake derivatives.
[11:52.500 --> 12:10.500]  It's a black hole of fraud. But when they get you up to the point of bankrupting the world and bringing in a global depression, they have to be in the position of posing as the saviors during the global reorganization like the Marshall Plan after Europe was wrecked.
[12:10.500 --> 12:18.500]  And it's actually the same corporation that's at the top of it, the OECD. They have to be able to reorganize everything after they collapse it.
[12:18.500 --> 12:27.500]  And to do that, they have to have a big war going on because they know now that you know the Federal Reserve is private and part of a foreign European banking cartel.
[12:27.500 --> 12:34.500]  They know now that you're starting to wake up, as Brzezinski just wrote in his book that came out this year, and that the elite are in trouble.
[12:34.500 --> 12:52.500]  So they've always run Al-Qaeda. They created them. They've always run them. I told you they put them in Libya. They put them in Syria. They put them in Africa. And I told you they'd put Afriqam in Africa and then have their operatives. Al-Qaeda works for these banks.
[12:52.500 --> 13:07.500]  And our troops are trained in order to train them and give them weapons. That's all on record, hiding in plain view. And they dump them out to murder Christians, other Muslims, you name it, destroy infrastructure, so the globalists can then come in and carpet bomb the country,
[13:07.500 --> 13:14.500]  thinking you're so stupid you won't remember that just a year and a half ago, they put them in charge in Libya. That's when the whole thing started.
[13:14.500 --> 13:23.500]  And eight months ago, started this new war against Assad in Syria. By the way, Dr. Pacinac was actually arrested by Assad's father.
[13:23.500 --> 13:32.500]  And that's how much globetrotting he's done. But we'll get his take on this whole situation when he comes up here in about 15 minutes.
[13:32.500 --> 13:49.500]  The point is, is that they are gearing up for a giant war with Iran and beyond, not just as an October surprise to control the election or cauterize Obama.
[13:49.500 --> 13:58.500]  At the top, it's the same power group. Sure, they've got political arms that fight with each other. And for the mid-level operatives who think they're at the top, they think there's different camps.
[13:58.500 --> 14:13.500]  But at the very top, they've got a focused group pushing this that wants to cause giant regional wars, bordering on Third World War or major world war,
[14:13.500 --> 14:20.500]  to re-engineer global society and bring in a total police state that's already in place, but they want to fully roll it out.
[14:20.500 --> 14:28.500]  Face scanning to buy and sell, total control, checkpoints at the end of your street. This has all been geared up. You're the target.
[14:28.500 --> 14:33.500]  Remember, I told you 10 years ago, Al Qaeda works for the globalists. They're going to give up your rights in the name of fighting Al Qaeda.
[14:33.500 --> 14:36.500]  Then they're going to tell you that domestic groups are the new terrorists.
[14:36.500 --> 14:46.500]  Now, they've said gun owners, libertarians, returning veterans, constitutionalists, the old-fashioned family who aren't the new normal, we are the bad guys.
[14:46.500 --> 14:54.500]  That's in all the law enforcement manuals, Homeland Security, the police have sent us, that's made national news. You've seen that in the news, you know that.
[14:54.500 --> 15:02.500]  This is all for you. This is a global banking cartel, getting nations to get into fights with each other so that everybody goes into deeper debt,
[15:02.500 --> 15:07.500]  and so we politically don't understand how we've been economically conquered.
[15:07.500 --> 15:20.500]  Now, notice, we said that these big wars would start with civil unrest and with Al Qaeda they put in all these countries when the global acceleration of dollar devaluation and other currency devaluation,
[15:20.500 --> 15:27.500]  because they're all pegged to the dollar, whenever that started. And it's been gradual, but now it's reached an acceleration point.
[15:27.500 --> 15:38.500]  So, there's no doubt, ladies and gentlemen, and not just my intellectual acumen, my spidey sense, my sixth sense, I know yours as well, has gone past the point of getting chills over this.
[15:38.500 --> 15:46.500]  Now, I'm locked in, well, I just got one right there, locked in, focused, it's game time, okay?
[15:46.500 --> 15:53.500]  Get ready, ladies and gentlemen, unless we get the word out about what's really happening, we're probably going to have World War III and a global depression.
[15:53.500 --> 15:58.500]  That'll make the Great Depression look like a piece of cake. We'll be right back.
[16:23.500 --> 16:30.500]  A piece of mind knowing that you can create endless supply of silver anytime, anywhere, for any application.
[16:30.500 --> 16:37.500]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.

[17:13.500 --> 17:19.500]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.

[18:59.500 --> 19:04.500]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative. But not all silver is equal.
[19:04.500 --> 19:11.500]  Silver Soul is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[19:11.500 --> 19:15.500]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.

[20:01.500 --> 20:04.500]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[20:04.500 --> 20:08.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:15.500 --> 20:21.500]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[20:21.500 --> 20:24.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:26.500 --> 20:36.500]  There are times in history when you see governments lining up on different sides of the battle line.
[20:36.500 --> 20:38.500]  And that's happening right now.
[20:40.500 --> 20:50.500]  Because the global banking cartel has created a Ponzi scheme that if they don't get governments to sign on to, they're all going to go to jail.
[20:50.500 --> 20:54.500]  Now they tell us, hey, sign on to the Ponzi scheme or everything will collapse.
[20:54.500 --> 21:15.500]  But mathematically, mathematically by many orders of power, it's impossible to ever get out of a collapse if, this is very, very important, if we don't decouple ourselves from the derivatives fraud.
[21:15.500 --> 21:24.500]  These people have taken the world over through this fraud and the globalists are absolutely opportunistic.
[21:24.500 --> 21:26.500]  They don't serve anything but raw power.
[21:27.500 --> 21:28.500]  What do I serve?
[21:28.500 --> 21:30.500]  I have people ask me that all the time.
[21:30.500 --> 21:35.500]  Major media executives, generals, famous spies, like who are you really working for?
[21:35.500 --> 21:37.500]  There's nobody out there who doesn't work for somebody.
[21:37.500 --> 21:38.500]  Really?
[21:38.500 --> 21:40.500]  I don't like bullies.
[21:40.500 --> 21:41.500]  I don't like losing my liberty.
[21:41.500 --> 21:43.500]  I don't like losing my freedom.
[21:43.500 --> 21:45.500]  I don't like being a slave.
[21:45.500 --> 21:48.500]  I don't like seeing my republic destroyed.
[21:49.500 --> 21:55.500]  I'm upset by gangs of lesser men getting together and taking over government and sucking off of me.
[21:56.500 --> 21:59.500]  I really do believe in a level playing field.
[21:59.500 --> 22:02.500]  I really do believe in free association.
[22:03.500 --> 22:04.500]  That's not old fashioned.
[22:04.500 --> 22:06.500]  That's not being a romantic.
[22:06.500 --> 22:12.500]  We're in this situation because we stopped being romantics who stood up for ideas of real freedom.
[22:12.500 --> 22:14.500]  We got lazy and stupid.
[22:14.500 --> 22:19.500]  Now we've got a bunch of kleptocratic elites getting ready to bring us into a major war.
[22:19.500 --> 22:22.500]  There's a reason there hadn't been a world war since World War II.
[22:22.500 --> 22:25.500]  It's called hydrogen bombs.
[22:25.500 --> 22:27.500]  It's called bio weapons.
[22:27.500 --> 22:31.500]  But the globalists have all gotten into eugenics and kind of hyped themselves up that,
[22:31.500 --> 22:35.500]  oh, well, we'll use the national security state to get total power out of this coming crisis.
[22:35.500 --> 22:38.500]  No, you're going to end up destroying our civilization.
[22:38.500 --> 22:40.500]  And I'm sick of you.
[22:40.500 --> 22:44.500]  I listen to talk radio as people try to understand what's happening.
[22:44.500 --> 22:49.500]  We told you they put al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria and all over Africa and Sudan.
[22:49.500 --> 22:56.500]  We told you, ladies and gentlemen, our troops are in Afghanistan to grow 93% of world opium.
[22:56.500 --> 22:59.500]  It was less than 10% before the liberation 10 years ago.
[23:00.500 --> 23:03.500]  We told you they're running al-Qaeda.
[23:03.500 --> 23:08.500]  And now it's been in the LA Times, the New York Times, and the CFR saying we need al-Qaeda.
[23:08.500 --> 23:10.500]  And al-Qaeda are good guys.
[23:10.500 --> 23:17.500]  And then al-Qaeda starts killing US troops all over the world and goes and attacks an embassy
[23:17.500 --> 23:19.500]  and was able to get through.
[23:19.500 --> 23:22.500]  And then al-Qaeda brags, we know your security procedures.
[23:22.500 --> 23:25.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Pachennik is going to come on the show.
[23:25.500 --> 23:30.500]  Dr. Pachennik, when he was on months ago, said he confronted Admiral Mullen at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[23:30.500 --> 23:32.500]  Turns out later that came out in the news.
[23:32.500 --> 23:36.500]  And Mullen came out and said, don't blame the US when Israel hits Iran.
[23:36.500 --> 23:39.500]  What do you think all this is about?
[23:39.500 --> 23:45.500]  Pachennik says it was Israel and elements of the Pentagon that hit that facility.
[23:45.500 --> 23:51.500]  You just think al-Qaeda, who they put in Libya and Syria and in Pakistan just did this on their own.
[23:51.500 --> 23:54.500]  They work for the globalist, period.
[23:54.500 --> 24:02.500]  And you've got Obama out there running around telling everybody that, oh, everything's fine now.
[24:02.500 --> 24:04.500]  And oh, no, it wasn't coordinated.
[24:04.500 --> 24:05.500]  It wasn't organized.
[24:05.500 --> 24:10.500]  This is an October surprise to cauterize Obama.
[24:10.500 --> 24:12.500]  But it's bigger than Romney.
[24:12.500 --> 24:14.500]  Understand that.
[24:14.500 --> 24:23.500]  This is very sophisticated because there's people within the Obama administration that are involved at this just as much as people in the Republican power structure.
[24:23.500 --> 24:26.500]  Because at the top of the pyramid, it's the same people.
[24:26.500 --> 24:31.500]  That's even what most of their high-level operatives don't understand about this system.
[24:31.500 --> 24:39.500]  They're planning what PNAC wrote, what Dick Cheney wrote back in September 20th of 2000 and rebuilding America's defenses.
[24:39.500 --> 24:40.500]  Look it up.
[24:40.500 --> 24:49.500]  It's public that they would cause a clash of civilizations by funding and radicalizing Muslims and then letting them attack.
[24:49.500 --> 24:53.500]  Meanwhile, the police aren't trained into fight radicalized Muslims, folks.
[24:53.500 --> 24:58.500]  They're trained to take your guns and take you to a reeducation camp because you're a red-blooded American.
[24:58.500 --> 25:06.500]  You're the target. And I hear these people dripping with salivating enjoyment on talk radio about Obama blew it.
[25:06.500 --> 25:07.500]  It's over for him.
[25:07.500 --> 25:11.500]  Yeah, Al-Qaeda, you know, Obama tried to say they were our friends.
[25:11.500 --> 25:13.500]  But look, he's getting it.
[25:13.500 --> 25:15.500]  This was the policy under Brzezinski.
[25:15.500 --> 25:20.500]  This was the policy under Carter, the policy under Reagan, the policy under Bush 41.
[25:20.500 --> 25:22.500]  On and on and on.
[25:22.500 --> 25:25.500]  It's the policy under George W., under Obama.
[25:25.500 --> 25:29.500]  They're puppets.
[25:29.500 --> 25:30.500]  The whole world is a stage.
[25:30.500 --> 25:33.500]  Each of us, players upon it, will not me.
[25:33.500 --> 25:34.500]  Not me, man.
[25:34.500 --> 25:36.500]  I'm not playing part in your World War III stage.
[25:36.500 --> 25:39.500]  We're in that St. PNAC document, rebuilding America's defenses.
[25:39.500 --> 25:42.500]  We just showed on screen if you're watching us at prisonplanet.tv.
[25:42.500 --> 25:47.500]  If you're a radio listener watching us online, the TV side of this, you can go read it where they go on to say,
[25:47.500 --> 25:52.500]  we need to legitimize the use of bio weapons to wipe out certain races.
[25:52.500 --> 25:55.500]  We need the media to legitimize that use.
[25:55.500 --> 25:58.500]  These are mad men.
[25:58.500 --> 26:02.500]  And they say we're mad because we don't want to engage in things like that.
[26:02.500 --> 26:05.500]  They also say they're history's actors.
[26:05.500 --> 26:07.500]  And that what we say and do doesn't matter.
[26:07.500 --> 26:11.500]  They'll decide reality and change what reality is day to day.
[26:11.500 --> 26:15.500]  The only people starting to change reality are the ruling class who've watched Touch with it.
[26:15.500 --> 26:21.500]  Just like Nero and Caligula and Hitler and so many others, you guys are smoking your own dope.
[26:21.500 --> 26:23.500]  You guys are drinking your own Kool-Aid.
[26:23.500 --> 26:25.500]  You people are crazy.
[26:25.500 --> 26:34.500]  You always bite off more than you can chew because you BS people so much you start losing touch with what's reality.
[26:34.500 --> 26:36.500]  You destroy the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[26:36.500 --> 26:45.500]  You create a surveillance state pointed at the people because you want to secure the country you took over as the heart of your global empire, your homeland.
[26:45.500 --> 26:49.500]  The pit you dig for us is the one you're going to fall into.
[26:49.500 --> 26:51.500]  You get rid of due process.
[26:51.500 --> 26:54.500]  You get rid of separations of powers.
[26:54.500 --> 26:59.500]  You allow the nastiest people in the system to go to the fore.
[26:59.500 --> 27:03.500]  That's why there's always a race to the bottom once evil is allowed in.
[27:03.500 --> 27:08.500]  So I'm going to state it for you very, very simply here in succinctly, okay?
[27:08.500 --> 27:11.500]  The Federal Reserve said it will never do quantitative easing three.
[27:11.500 --> 27:13.500]  That would cause hyperinflation.
[27:13.500 --> 27:18.500]  Instead, they've announced unlimited quantitative easing, but not just to the people.
[27:18.500 --> 27:20.500]  The people don't get any of this money.
[27:20.500 --> 27:24.500]  It all goes to mega offshore banks to buy their bad derivatives.
[27:24.500 --> 27:32.500]  And then the media tells you you're in debt because it's your debt when almost none of it is your debt because you don't have economic understanding.
[27:32.500 --> 27:37.500]  The average political know-it-all is like Miss Teen USA who couldn't even talk.
[27:37.500 --> 27:39.500]  We're going to play a clip of her later.
[27:39.500 --> 27:41.500]  You think that woman's a moron?
[27:41.500 --> 27:47.500]  You're a moron when you try geopolitical analysis because you're not taught a real system on the news.
[27:47.500 --> 27:52.500]  They give you one-dimensional or two-dimensional at most systems.
[27:52.500 --> 27:55.500]  And this thing is three-dimensional chess on so many other levels.
[27:55.500 --> 27:59.500]  It's like playing 100 games of chess at the same time, okay?
[27:59.500 --> 28:06.500]  You only can have a historical understanding to be able to even war game this because humans act the same over and over again.
[28:06.500 --> 28:09.500]  That's the only way to understand this.
[28:09.500 --> 28:11.500]  Here's the deal. Here's the news.
[28:11.500 --> 28:14.500]  Al Qaeda in Yemen urges Muslims to kill US diplomats over film.
[28:14.500 --> 28:17.500]  The film has nothing to do with it. It's just an excuse.
[28:17.500 --> 28:20.500]  Military Afghan inside attacks kill four US troops.
[28:20.500 --> 28:23.500]  Sudan rejects US request to send Marines to guard embassies.
[28:23.500 --> 28:28.500]  NATO copter destroyed by Taliban at Bagram Air Base.
[28:28.500 --> 28:31.500]  Americans killed in Libya was on intel mission to track weapons.
[28:31.500 --> 28:35.500]  What, the 10,000 missiles that Al Qaeda got that our government gave them?
[28:35.500 --> 28:38.500]  Armada of British naval power,
[28:38.500 --> 28:41.500]  massing in the Gulf as Israel prepares to strike Iran.
[28:41.500 --> 28:43.500]  London Telegraph.
[28:43.500 --> 28:45.500]  Notice all this is happening.
[28:45.500 --> 28:47.500]  They're devaluing the currency globally.
[28:47.500 --> 28:49.500]  The World Reserve currency, the dollar.
[28:49.500 --> 28:52.500]  That causes people in third world countries to start starving to death,
[28:52.500 --> 28:54.500]  accelerating the rioting,
[28:54.500 --> 28:58.500]  and the globalists want to ride this storm order out of chaos.
[29:02.500 --> 29:07.500]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans,
[29:07.500 --> 29:10.500]  here is the Cal Bend Soap Company.

[31:02.500 --> 31:06.500]  Get off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[31:06.500 --> 31:08.500]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country,
[31:08.500 --> 31:11.500]  I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[31:11.500 --> 31:13.500]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[31:13.500 --> 31:16.500]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks
[31:16.500 --> 31:21.500]  because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[31:21.500 --> 31:25.500]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts
[31:25.500 --> 31:29.500]  and if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[31:29.500 --> 31:32.500]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science

[33:22.500 --> 33:26.500]  All right, we've only got him a little bit into the next hour.
[33:26.500 --> 33:32.500]  So I'm going to try to give him the floor, but have him get right into it in a language that all of us can easily understand.
[33:32.500 --> 33:38.500]  Dr. Steve Pechenik, MD, PhD, is an American psychiatrist, former State Department official,
[33:38.500 --> 33:41.500]  author, publisher, and co-wrote a lot of Tom Clancy's books.
[33:41.500 --> 33:43.500]  Had a lot of his books turned into big films.
[33:43.500 --> 33:46.500]  He's a critically acclaimed author and psycho-political thrillers
[33:46.500 --> 33:51.500]  and the co-creator of the best-selling Tom Clancy op-center in Tom Clancy's net for his paperbacks.
[33:51.500 --> 33:56.500]  He was trained in psychiatry at Harvard University International Relations at MIT.
[33:56.500 --> 33:58.500]  His novels are based on over 20 years.
[33:58.500 --> 34:03.500]  He was a colonel in Black Ops, wrote the book on psychological warfare for the State Department,
[34:03.500 --> 34:07.500]  then adopted by the CIA, helped overthrow government assassinations.
[34:07.500 --> 34:10.500]  He won't get into it, but you can look him up if you'd like to.
[34:10.500 --> 34:12.500]  Very serious, personally, got on the line.
[34:12.500 --> 34:18.500]  A member of the Council on Fine Relations, he told me on air when he was on about a month and a half ago,
[34:18.500 --> 34:21.500]  the interviews are there, they're posted at infoworks.com.
[34:21.500 --> 34:22.500]  Just look at the last interview.
[34:22.500 --> 34:26.500]  He said, yeah, I just confronted Dempsey, got in his face and said,
[34:26.500 --> 34:28.500]  that's the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[34:28.500 --> 34:32.500]  And then it came out in the news later, actually, that Dempsey had been confronted.
[34:32.500 --> 34:35.500]  They didn't say it was Pachinic at a Council on Fine Relations meeting.
[34:35.500 --> 34:39.500]  And then Dempsey came out and said, hey, the U.S. won't be behind the Iran attack.
[34:39.500 --> 34:40.500]  We don't want the blame.
[34:40.500 --> 34:41.500]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[34:41.500 --> 34:42.500]  We're going to be sucked into it.
[34:42.500 --> 34:44.500]  So just amazing inside info.
[34:44.500 --> 34:49.500]  He's not supposed to talk about what goes on inside the meetings of the Council on Fine Relations,
[34:49.500 --> 34:52.500]  but we've only got him for, again, three segments.
[34:52.500 --> 34:57.500]  We're going to get him back on later in the week because they're gearing up for a giant Iran strike,
[34:57.500 --> 35:08.500]  huge carrier task force groups, British buildup, 20 nations plus have their 25 nations are converging on the Strait of Hormuz.
[35:08.500 --> 35:14.500]  You've got the killing of the U.S. Ambassador in Benghazi.
[35:14.500 --> 35:19.500]  And I've talked to a lot of my sources and they all say, including Pachinic,
[35:19.500 --> 35:22.500]  October surprise basically to Carterize Obama.
[35:22.500 --> 35:26.500]  And by the way, Pachinic worked for Carter, George Bush Sr. and others.
[35:26.500 --> 35:29.500]  So he's bipartisan in his quote, service of the country.
[35:29.500 --> 35:37.500]  But here to break this down for us, the point we're at geopolitically right now is Dr. Steve Pachinic.
[35:37.500 --> 35:41.500]  StevePachinic.com is his website if you want to find out about his best selling books.
[35:41.500 --> 35:42.500]  Good to have you here with us, Doc.
[35:42.500 --> 35:45.500]  I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor because we don't have a lot of time.
[35:45.500 --> 35:48.500]  But please break down where we are right now.
[35:48.500 --> 35:51.500]  I mean, I know you were against Obama exposed to the bin Laden things.
[35:51.500 --> 35:55.500]  It's not like you're for him to expose that this is meant to be blamed on him, this killing.
[35:55.500 --> 35:58.500]  But clearly the media is trying to deep six Obama.
[35:58.500 --> 36:01.500]  What's behind this geopolitically?
[36:01.500 --> 36:08.500]  What's behind this geopolitically is the extension of what you were brave enough and your audience was brave enough to understand.
[36:08.500 --> 36:14.500]  This is all an extension of the 9-11 disinformation and false flag episode.
[36:14.500 --> 36:20.500]  It continued into the issue of the CIA and the confrontation between the CIA and our military
[36:20.500 --> 36:25.500]  and the President of the United States continuing on their covert activities
[36:25.500 --> 36:31.500]  and trying to reposition themselves in the Middle East while the military on the General Petraeus
[36:31.500 --> 36:35.500]  and under other generals are trying to pull us out of the Middle East.
[36:35.500 --> 36:42.500]  What's happening now is we have the overview of a Shiite power, the Iranians fighting the Sunnis,
[36:42.500 --> 36:49.500]  which is Saudi Arabia, but in the middle is Israel continuously playing with all of the players,
[36:49.500 --> 36:56.500]  including Saudi Arabia and particularly the diaspora Jews and the Jews of the United States
[36:56.500 --> 37:04.500]  as a way of putting pressure on Obama, as a way of pushing pressure on General Dempsey and General Petraeus
[37:04.500 --> 37:12.500]  to say that we want red lines in order to be able to attack Iran and the answers repeatedly,
[37:12.500 --> 37:15.500]  even by General Dempsey, the answer is no.
[37:15.500 --> 37:20.500]  We will not give you a red line, General Petraeus said, not only we will not give you a red line,
[37:20.500 --> 37:25.500]  but we want you to know under no circumstances, and I do not talk to General Petraeus.
[37:25.500 --> 37:27.500]  I'm a great admirer of his.
[37:27.500 --> 37:32.500]  I know what he is doing is that he has repeatedly stated, as I had,
[37:32.500 --> 37:37.500]  that from a geopolitical point of view Israel is a strategic liability
[37:37.500 --> 37:41.500]  and has been a strategic liability for over 20 years.
[37:41.500 --> 37:48.500]  Since 1968 we have had no need for Israel other than the fact that it covered us under the Soviet Union
[37:48.500 --> 37:51.500]  on the eastern, southern and northern flank.
[37:51.500 --> 37:59.500]  For the first time since 1948 geopolitically Israel is confronted by Hezbollah, a proxy for Iran,
[37:59.500 --> 38:07.500]  by Hamas and his proxies on the eastern bank in Jordan and on the south by the Islamic Brotherhood or Al-Qaeda,
[38:07.500 --> 38:10.500]  all of which they were part and parcel of.
[38:10.500 --> 38:17.500]  It's not innocent of any activity and contrary to Bibi Netanyahu's speech today to CNN
[38:17.500 --> 38:22.500]  where he wished everybody a happy new year, I in return wish Bibi Netanyahu and Israel
[38:22.500 --> 38:26.500]  a happy new year and wish that he first began to tell the truth,
[38:26.500 --> 38:30.500]  that the involvement of Israel was in 9-11.
[38:30.500 --> 38:34.500]  Over 130 former side operas were picked up in 9-11.
[38:34.500 --> 38:36.500]  The FBI picked them up, debriefed them.
[38:36.500 --> 38:42.500]  They were clearly involved with the Pakistani ISI and Saudi Arabian intelligence.
[38:42.500 --> 38:49.500]  Then we get to the old issue of Osama bin Laden which Obama said incorrectly in light of the public
[38:49.500 --> 38:52.500]  that Osama bin Laden was killed by Field Team 6.
[38:52.500 --> 38:55.500]  Admiral McRaven had lied repeatedly.
[38:55.500 --> 39:02.500]  Unfortunately this is a decent admiral but for whatever reason he repeatedly insisted
[39:02.500 --> 39:08.500]  on saying Field Team 6 killed Osama bin Laden when in fact on your radio show 10 years ago
[39:08.500 --> 39:10.500]  I said he was already dead.
[39:10.500 --> 39:16.500]  The Navy Field Team 6 will be disciplined by General Petraeus and others in the Special Forces.
[39:16.500 --> 39:21.500]  So what this means in effect is that we had an ambassador who was a very honorable ambassador
[39:21.500 --> 39:25.500]  working in the State Department under very good Secretary of State,
[39:25.500 --> 39:29.500]  Hillary Clinton who's been doing an excellent job keeping everything quiet
[39:29.500 --> 39:33.500]  alongside of a lot of diplomats including Mark Grossman and others
[39:33.500 --> 39:38.500]  and a president who's tried to maintain this warrant contained it in a very effective way
[39:38.500 --> 39:44.500]  and may have been undermined by the following people who once again came out of 9-11.
[39:44.500 --> 39:51.500]  Your friends in mind, the neokine chicken hawks, Paul Wolfowitz once again hiding behind Mitt Romney,
[39:51.500 --> 39:58.500]  Elliot Abrams hiding behind Mitt Romney, Chertoff, the head of Homeland Security
[39:58.500 --> 40:05.500]  and now has the Chertoff Group which is nothing more than a cover for this CIA and FBI run by Charles Allam,
[40:05.500 --> 40:14.500]  a former CIA operative, all hiding behind Mitt Romney who himself has no idea of what he's talking about in foreign policy.
[40:14.500 --> 40:21.500]  So you have a presidential candidate who can utter even the right words with an entire team
[40:21.500 --> 40:29.500]  like Bob Zellick, Roger Ailes and Murdoch he has no idea that the most important enemy he says is Russia.
[40:29.500 --> 40:32.500]  No, Russia is not our most important enemy.
[40:32.500 --> 40:39.500]  We are a super parent as Colin Powell has said repeatedly, cool at Mitt Romney and get your facts straight.
[40:39.500 --> 40:47.500]  Mitt Romney is being run by a guy named Don Fenzer, a prodigy of the neo-convultures Paul Wolfowitz,
[40:47.500 --> 40:55.500]  Richard Perle and once again what we have is a fight between the neo-con-jews, Israel on that side
[40:55.500 --> 41:02.500]  and the fact that we have an intelligence service that is split under General Petraeus,
[41:02.500 --> 41:09.500]  trying to maintain peace and stability in the Middle East, a state department that's trying to maintain peace and stability
[41:09.500 --> 41:17.500]  and a situation that has been provoked through agitation propaganda through local Libyans and as well as foreigners,
[41:17.500 --> 41:25.500]  foreigners meeting mercenaries and others concerned with agitation propaganda in order to destabilize Libya
[41:25.500 --> 41:29.500]  and to particularly assassinate our ambassador.
[41:29.500 --> 41:31.500]  Why this particular ambassador?
[41:31.500 --> 41:36.500]  I think it's very important for your audience to understand who Christopher Stevens was.
[41:36.500 --> 41:40.500]  He was considered and the key word here is an Arabist.
[41:40.500 --> 41:47.500]  It's a very rare word to use in the description of an outstanding foreign service officer.
[41:47.500 --> 41:55.500]  An Arabist was a term that was used by the neo-con, the Israelis and others who did not like experts
[41:55.500 --> 42:02.500]  who were specially trained in Arabic studies, spoke Arabic, were sensitive to the Arab culture,
[42:02.500 --> 42:08.500]  were trained specifically in what was considered the Protestant college developed in the 1800s
[42:08.500 --> 42:12.500]  by famous mercenaries on our part.
[42:12.500 --> 42:20.500]  This was all Presbyterian missionaries, which eventually became the Lebanese, the Beirut University of Lebanon,
[42:20.500 --> 42:27.500]  where subsequently great men like Mr. Kerr and others were trained and an Arabist who might have worked with.
[42:27.500 --> 42:32.500]  The only peace treaty that has ever existed was part of Christopher Stevens.
[42:32.500 --> 42:33.500]  Well, stay there.
[42:33.500 --> 42:35.500]  Basically, Doc, we've got to go to break.
[42:35.500 --> 42:37.500]  Come back and explain it in layman's terms here.
[42:37.500 --> 42:42.500]  I know you're talking to the intelligence community, but obviously you're not a fan of Obama either.
[42:42.500 --> 42:47.500]  But you told me, you're saying Israeli intelligence with Saudi intel is who killed the ambassador.
[42:47.500 --> 42:58.500]  This is pretty big news. Stay there.
[43:17.500 --> 43:22.500]  These filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth. There's no priming required.

[47:04.500 --> 47:08.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:08.500 --> 47:10.500]  Network.
[47:10.500 --> 47:20.500]  We are on the march.
[47:20.500 --> 47:23.500]  The Empire is on the run.
[47:23.500 --> 47:28.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[47:28.500 --> 47:34.500]  That's right, an empire of corrupt criminals that work together who want to destroy liberty and freedom worldwide.
[47:34.500 --> 47:36.500]  It's real simple. You're for freedom or you're for tyranny.
[47:36.500 --> 47:38.500]  I stand with liberty.
[47:38.500 --> 47:43.500]  Now, Dr. Pritchett won't brag about himself, but over the years interviewing him now for about 11 years or 10 years,
[47:43.500 --> 47:46.500]  I've looked him up and you come across him.
[47:46.500 --> 47:54.500]  He was the main psychiatrist or psych warfare guy that Jimmy Carter had in the Camp David Accords with Anwar Sadat
[47:54.500 --> 47:59.500]  and actually got him to do the deal by actually really talking to him.
[47:59.500 --> 48:01.500]  So he knows what he's talking about here.
[48:01.500 --> 48:05.500]  So what they're saying is this ambassador, well, I mean, it's simple.
[48:05.500 --> 48:11.500]  You want to get a war going, you kill the ambassador, you get your jihadis that are in there to start blowing stuff up
[48:11.500 --> 48:12.500]  and then you blame Obama for it.
[48:12.500 --> 48:13.500]  Now, let's be clear.
[48:13.500 --> 48:14.500]  I don't like Obama.
[48:14.500 --> 48:18.500]  I don't like Mitt Romney and I really don't like Obama on his anti-gun, all the rest of it.
[48:18.500 --> 48:22.500]  I mean, Dr. Pachinnick's worked for George Bush Sr. and Brent Scrowcroft.
[48:22.500 --> 48:24.500]  So he's not political as well.
[48:24.500 --> 48:26.500]  He's just giving you what he believes is really going on.
[48:26.500 --> 48:34.500]  I mean, do you really believe anybody that a bunch of jihadis went through all those special forces guys they had guarding the ambassador?
[48:34.500 --> 48:36.500]  Do you really think there were only four security guards there?
[48:36.500 --> 48:41.500]  I mean, Al Qaeda quote bragged that we know your security.
[48:41.500 --> 48:42.500]  So this is amazing.
[48:42.500 --> 48:47.500]  So just tell me what you told me privately in that 45-minute conversation we had yesterday, Dr. Pachinnick.
[48:47.500 --> 48:50.500]  I mean, tell people where we're standing right now.
[48:50.500 --> 48:53.500]  I mean, how this ties into Iran, where this is going.
[48:53.500 --> 48:59.500]  What we are is a brink of war that's being precipitated by two major countries.
[48:59.500 --> 49:06.500]  Israel, particularly Bibi Netanyahu, who knows his country's feeling economically, socially, politically.
[49:06.500 --> 49:09.500]  He is isolated by the United States.
[49:09.500 --> 49:14.500]  What General Petraeus two years ago said correctly is a liability.
[49:14.500 --> 49:26.500]  He already immediately tried to take action to draw us back in by mobilizing the Jewish committees like APEC, the Zionists, the Neocons, the Mitt Romney and all the men behind them.
[49:26.500 --> 49:30.500]  By the way, you're Jewish, Dr. Pachinnick. You're Jewish, so you're not Jewish.
[49:30.500 --> 49:35.500]  I come out of the Holocaust, but remember Netanyahu did not come out of the Holocaust.
[49:35.500 --> 49:44.500]  Contrary to everything Netanyahu is telling America and is telling Obama, everything he says is a lie, including what his father wrote.
[49:44.500 --> 49:46.500]  His father was a teacher, Cornell.
[49:46.500 --> 49:57.500]  What he continuously says, and I'm saying this as a Jew on the eve of a holiday, is that the Israel was the foundation of salvation for the persecution of Jews.
[49:57.500 --> 50:05.500]  Nothing could have been a greater lie than the fact that Israel or Palestine at the time was of no value to the Israelis.
[50:05.500 --> 50:18.500]  On the contrary to the Jews, on the contrary, when Eichmann came and he was trained in Hebrew in 1927, a deal offered by Hitler to save thousands of Hungarian Jews.
[50:18.500 --> 50:24.500]  In return for trucks and glories, he said, I would rather have 400 cows than one diaspora Jew.
[50:24.500 --> 50:42.500]  Repeatedly Israel turned down any help to help the diaspora Jew. They did, however, in 1933 in Palestine, take 36,000 German Jews in return for money and worked with Hydrick and worked with Hydrick, who was a Jew.
[50:42.500 --> 50:44.500]  I'm talking as a diaspora Jew.
[50:44.500 --> 50:53.500]  There were 165,000 German Jews called Michelin during the Hitler's army, none of which Netanyahu wants to talk about.
[50:53.500 --> 50:57.500]  This is super deep history you're getting into.
[50:57.500 --> 51:06.500]  Let me just say something. Everything Bebe is saying to America and to the American Jews is an absolute unmitigated lie.
[51:06.500 --> 51:20.500]  Since 1968, when Israel ever interested in the diaspora Jew or using the Holocaust, then they created a machinery to use the Holocaust as a way of mobilizing guilt and anxiety over the world.
[51:20.500 --> 51:24.500]  But they're not the only culprits. The next culprit is Saudi Arabia.
[51:24.500 --> 51:31.500]  And the summary of seven, that is, the wife of King Abu Dalakis. Let's put it this way, very simply.
[51:31.500 --> 51:37.500]  The Faisal and Saud families are not legitimate heirs to Saudi Arabia. It was created by England.
[51:37.500 --> 51:42.500]  They created in a concept called the Biden Conqueror, a family that came out of Doria.
[51:42.500 --> 51:50.500]  Most of you saw that in the Lawrence of Arabia film, it does not exist. They are Wahhabis. They distort the Quran.
[51:50.500 --> 51:57.500]  The message of the Quran throughout history has always been peace and love and working with all of the religions.
[51:57.500 --> 52:01.500]  They were formidable. And the Wahhabis are the total distortion.
[52:01.500 --> 52:06.500]  The true descendants of Mecca and Medina are not the King Faisal or Saudis.
[52:06.500 --> 52:13.500]  They are the Hashemites. But the British took them away from Saudi Arabia, put one in Iraq who was four years old,
[52:13.500 --> 52:21.500]  and another one in Jordan so that they would never have an ability to have the true leaders of the prophet of Muhammad.
[52:21.500 --> 52:32.500]  So what we have here is a collusion between Saudi Arabia and the Neocon Jews of America and Israel against a president
[52:32.500 --> 52:41.500]  who, whether I like or dislike and may have lied on Osama bin Laden, is the son of a CIA operative,
[52:41.500 --> 52:47.500]  the grandson of a CIA operative who understands very well what the issues of intelligence are,
[52:47.500 --> 52:52.500]  including the United States ambassador who understands very well what's happening.
[52:52.500 --> 53:02.500]  Put it in layman's terms though for people, bottom line, what's the point of killing the ambassador?
[53:02.500 --> 53:09.500]  The point of killing the ambassador is to precipitate a war so that Israel can finally get into Iran and try to destroy Iran.
[53:09.500 --> 53:14.500]  It will be the beginning of the end of Israel. It's Armageddon for Israel.
[53:14.500 --> 53:21.500]  Israel wants to go in, but it wants to force America to take it out of its trouble in Iran
[53:21.500 --> 53:25.500]  because Israel cannot succeed in any flight into Iran.
[53:25.500 --> 53:31.500]  It is impossible, logistically and strategically, Israel lost every war since 68.
[53:31.500 --> 53:37.500]  There is not one war they have succeeded in despite what they may say to everybody else.
[53:37.500 --> 53:42.500]  And the last war where they lost thousands of men will be a reminder to the Israeli mothers
[53:42.500 --> 53:47.500]  that every time they send their children to war, they will die in multiples,
[53:47.500 --> 53:51.500]  no Americans will come to help you. Betrayers will not come.
[53:51.500 --> 53:56.500]  The MC will not come. Neither will any other soldiers or intelligence operatives.
[53:56.500 --> 54:03.500]  So what we have here is an eternal strife against Saudi Arabia and the United States
[54:03.500 --> 54:10.500]  attacking one of our ambassadors and killing them in the name of the fact that he was a representative
[54:10.500 --> 54:12.500]  of the United States and he was an Arabist.
[54:12.500 --> 54:16.500]  Now let me tell you when an Arabist is very quickly the audience understands.
[54:16.500 --> 54:23.500]  They were famous people who helped to develop a treaty, the only treaty that has ever been done
[54:23.500 --> 54:28.500]  between Israel and a Muslim tribe in Egypt was called the Camp David Accord,
[54:28.500 --> 54:30.500]  of which I was privileged to be a member.
[54:30.500 --> 54:36.500]  And one of the most famous people there was Herman Iots, the ambassador to Egypt, an Arabist.
[54:36.500 --> 54:42.500]  Another one was Frank Wisner, who should have been Secretary of State, a great foreign service officer.
[54:42.500 --> 54:48.500]  Another person is the man by the name of Chas Freeman, who was accused by the neocon
[54:48.500 --> 54:52.500]  of being pro-Israel, anti-Israel, because he speaks Arabic.
[54:52.500 --> 54:55.500]  He's a scholar. He's a foreign service officer.
[54:55.500 --> 55:02.500]  So what you're seeing here is a division within the United States by Zionists, not Jews only,
[55:02.500 --> 55:09.500]  but Zionists, Israeli Mossad operatives, and Saudi financing in order to denigrate the value
[55:09.500 --> 55:17.500]  of our foreign service officers who are trained in culture, Arabic studies, including April Glassby.
[55:17.500 --> 55:23.500]  And the president who got rid of all of our Arabists under neocon pressure was Clinton.
[55:23.500 --> 55:27.500]  Ironically, Hillary Clinton was trying to maintain a peace.
[55:27.500 --> 55:34.500]  Her husband was totally intimidated by the neocon Jews to get rid of every Arabist
[55:34.500 --> 55:38.500]  in the State Department and put in people like Martin Indyk.
[55:38.500 --> 55:44.500]  Martin Indyk, who was ambassador to Israel, was nothing more than an Australian spy
[55:44.500 --> 55:50.500]  who within one day became an American citizen, was appointed by Dennis Ross, another neocon,
[55:50.500 --> 55:54.500]  who works with Paul Wolf, and made our ambassador to Israel.
[55:54.500 --> 55:59.500]  Let me stop you. Doc, doc, doc, we're going to have you back up very early this week
[55:59.500 --> 56:02.500]  for an hour and a half, because you, I mean, obviously you need to go over this whole history
[56:02.500 --> 56:04.500]  for people that don't understand it.
[56:04.500 --> 56:08.500]  But here's the issue. We're about to go to break.
[56:08.500 --> 56:11.500]  But what I need you to understand here is you've got the British fleet massing.
[56:11.500 --> 56:15.500]  They never go somewhere unless there's a war. You've got 25 nations all gathering.
[56:15.500 --> 56:18.500]  This is hardly in the news. You've got QE Unlimited starting.
[56:18.500 --> 56:21.500]  You've got our government digging in, like it's the end of the world.
[56:21.500 --> 56:27.500]  All the evidence I see says they're going ahead in October, late October with this,
[56:27.500 --> 56:30.500]  and it could lead to World War III. Is that accurate?
[56:30.500 --> 56:34.500]  That is accurate. It could be earlier than October because we have Yom Kippur,
[56:34.500 --> 56:39.500]  and I predicted on your radio show, and I predicted to our national security people,
[56:39.500 --> 56:44.500]  privately, that Bibi Netanyahu would start something on Rosh Hashanah.
[56:44.500 --> 56:47.500]  This was over a year ago, and I said it on your radio show.
[56:47.500 --> 56:52.500]  He was as predictable as the clock, and the Israelis will be very predictable.
[56:52.500 --> 56:58.500]  Yom Kippur, in a couple of weeks, they will try to initiate another war,
[56:58.500 --> 57:03.500]  unless they're ex-Mosad operatives and they're action that will take down Netanyahu
[57:03.500 --> 57:08.500]  and do to Netanyahu what happened to Rabbi. They know what I'm talking about.
[57:08.500 --> 57:14.500]  Otherwise, these people bring down Israel, the world, and there will be a Third World War.
[57:14.500 --> 57:18.500]  Turkey is trying to help us. Russia is trying to help us.
[57:18.500 --> 57:21.500]  Well, Dr. Botanik, I think everybody knows what you were talking about right there.
[57:21.500 --> 57:25.500]  Again, I'm in over my head. This is pretty hardcore stuff.
[57:25.500 --> 57:29.500]  All I know is I want peace. I don't want a world war, and I see the police.
[57:29.500 --> 57:34.500]  Everybody digging in for what they say is the end of America, and I don't like it.
[57:34.500 --> 57:38.500]  I don't like where this is going because a bunch of people want the end of the world.
[57:38.500 --> 57:43.500]  People in Israel, people in Iran, and a bunch of Christians who I don't think are very Christian.
[57:43.500 --> 57:47.500]  We'll be right back. Stay with us. Second hour coming up. This is Real Radio.
[57:50.500 --> 57:53.500]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[57:53.500 --> 57:59.500]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at infowars.com.
[57:59.500 --> 58:06.500]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[58:06.500 --> 58:11.500]  And that's Dreams From My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at infowars.com.
[58:11.500 --> 58:15.500]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[58:15.500 --> 58:19.500]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.

[58:24.500 --> 58:26.500]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[58:26.500 --> 58:30.500]  None dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[58:30.500 --> 58:34.500]  We're also carrying behind the green mask, You in Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[58:34.500 --> 58:37.500]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[58:37.500 --> 58:44.500]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[58:44.500 --> 58:49.500]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[58:49.500 --> 58:55.500]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[58:55.500 --> 58:57.500]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[58:57.500 --> 59:03.500]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there, Bar None, is ProPure.
[59:03.500 --> 59:06.500]  And it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[59:06.500 --> 59:10.500]  Its filters are silver and pregnated to prevent bacterial growth.

[59:14.500 --> 59:17.500]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[59:17.500 --> 59:21.500]  Easy to set up and use, doesn't require electricity.
[59:21.500 --> 59:24.500]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[59:24.500 --> 59:27.500]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[59:27.500 --> 59:31.500]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[59:31.500 --> 59:34.500]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[59:34.500 --> 59:36.500]  It's what my family uses.
[59:36.500 --> 59:42.500]  infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure, but if you add the promo code WATER at checkout,
[59:42.500 --> 59:45.500]  you get an additional 10% off and infowars.com.

[59:50.500 --> 59:54.500]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[59:54.500 --> 59:59.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[59:59.500 --> 01:00:07.500]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:11.500]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:30.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am just absolutely stunned right now
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.500]  by the things that Dr. Pechenick is talking about.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:38.500]  Clearly the way the mainstream media is absolutely pouncing on
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:44.500]  and going after Obama is just so clear.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.500]  I don't like Obama. I hate him. I hate his socialism, his anti-gun, all of it.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:51.500]  I wish Romney was an alternative. I'm not saying vote for either one of them.
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:55.500]  And I know Pechenick is apolitical when it comes to this.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.500]  Talk to me about five minutes left. You've really dropped some bombshells here,
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:02.500]  but most analysts say this could easily lead to World War III.
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:06.500]  And the neocons are trying to destabilize Russia and overthrow them,
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.500]  trying to turn them into a new enemy, a new arms race.
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.500]  Doesn't the military industrial complex know if they start World War III?
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.500]  There won't be anywhere to spend all that money they're getting?
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:21.500]  Well, the military industrial complex at this point is totally denuded.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:25.500]  What they're afraid of is the $2 trillion substitution,
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.500]  the decrease in money that they're going to get in the military.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.500]  But the military right now is divided.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.500]  What you have is military generals who've had experience
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:37.500]  and no longer want to go into Iraq and Afghanistan
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.500]  and have told the president and others this is enough.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.500]  We have to get out of the sandbox, as General Petraeus says.
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:48.500]  And we have to leave. We have a bigger issue that's much more important
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:53.500]  than Middle East for us and that cyber war, as Keith Alexander said,
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:59.500]  and the issue as Obama said, East Asia and the Pacific and China's growing in.
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:03.500]  The United States has lost all of its soft power by going in there,
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.500]  among other things, to quote, help Israel.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.500]  And notice these invasions haven't helped Israel.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.500]  Israel is more insecure than ever.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:15.500]  That's correct. Because of their own paranoia and continuous paranoia
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.500]  and the insecurity, they keep feeding it in a loop
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.500]  at what happens if their soldiers are no longer equipped.
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.500]  Remember, these are not the same Zionists that came in
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:28.500]  and established the State of Israel in 1948, which, by the way,
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:33.500]  they then committed in 1948 euthanasia and genocide,
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.500]  which subsequently the Israelis admitted to as their children.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.500]  The ringworms killed the Palestinians.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:44.500]  Well, they also killed a bunch of the Sephardic Jews with the radiation.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.500]  You know about that?
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:50.500]  Yes, I also know that they created a lot of agitation and propaganda in Morocco
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:55.500]  in order to force the Moroccan Jews to leave a very friendly friend
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.500]  to the Jews, King Hassan of Morocco.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.500]  So the Israelis and the Zionists have created,
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.500]  used the Jews to the diaspora.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:06.500]  That means the Polish, Russian Jews and Sephardic Jews
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:12.500]  as a weapon to manipulate world opinion, to create agitation propaganda
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:17.500]  in the same way Saudi Arabia is using their people, the Salafis,
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:22.500]  to be the thugmen against United States that use it in the term of al-Qaeda
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:26.500]  or any form they want, but Saudi Arabia, which is falling apart now
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:31.500]  because it's only a second and third generation illegitimate ruling class
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:36.500]  from an illegitimate king is now in the process of failing apart.
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:41.500]  Both states, Israel and Saudi Arabia, are in desperate situation
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.500]  and they're trying to force America back into the Middle East.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.500]  Well, you got Dempsey.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.500]  I'm not correctly saying no.
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.500]  And while Petraeus is saying no,
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:54.500]  while Dempsey is saying we will not go to war in order to protect you.
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:57.500]  Well, Doc, in closing, we're going to get you back up in the next few days.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.500]  We appreciate your time.
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.500]  StevePachennik.com.
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.500]  Thank you.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500]  In closing, you did confront Dempsey.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.500]  You told us about it.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:09.500]  Later, he came out after that and said, hey, don't blame the U.S. or me
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.500]  of Israel attacks.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.500]  I think the answer, short of what you were talking about,
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:17.500]  which I certainly don't want earlier, is to have our military
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.500]  and our government unify and say, we're not going to do this.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:25.500]  Stop it, because if they don't call this out,
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.500]  this looks like false flag sitting to me, because if elements in Israel
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.500]  are this arrogant right now, they might pull a false flag.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.500]  What do you say in 20 seconds?
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.500]  They will absolutely pull the false flag.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:37.500]  This is a false flag.
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:42.500]  Our military clearly pointed out to me that the Libyan embassy was very far away
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.500]  when they had two days' notice and basically no one did it.
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.500]  I'll tell you what, do two more minutes.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.500]  We've got our next guest coming up.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.500]  I'll do two more minutes.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:49.500]  One minute break.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.500]  Come back and make the point about embassy security.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:56.500]  Dr. Pachennik's our guest.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.500]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts,
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.500]  and if you don't have a backup system in place,
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.500]  I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.500]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:36.500]  are offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit.
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.500]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.500]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:46.500]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.500]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:54.500]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at beattheblackouts.com.
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:06:19.500]  That's beattheblackouts.com.
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:26.500]  We've got our next guest coming up.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:35.500]  We've got our next guest coming up.
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:44.500]  We've got our next guest coming up.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:54.500]  We've got our next guest coming up.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:07:04.500]  We've got our next guest coming up.
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:14.500]  We've got our next guest coming up.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.500]  He's been on the show off and on for 10 years.
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.500]  Really is frightening because he's not pulling any punches now.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:44.500]  I mean, Dr. Pachinnick knows where the bodies are buried.
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:47.500]  Doc, you're going to be back with us Tuesday for an hour and a half
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.500]  because this is moving quickly, World War III, financial collapse.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.500]  That's why all this is happening.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:57.500]  But talk about the embassy and the killing of the ambassador in Benghazi
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:01.500]  and the point you've made that your average jihadist
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:04.500]  basically couldn't do this and the message that was sent
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.500]  and how that ties into your sources, you were telling me off air,
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:12.500]  that your Pentagon sources, I mean, they know who really killed this guy
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500]  and the message it's meant to send.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.500]  Well, the message he was meant to send, the Pentagon sources have informed me
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.500]  that the distance between the Libyan embassy where our ambassador was
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:28.500]  and where the rioters were, it was so large and two days of delay in response,
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:34.500]  meaning simply that they were professionals ready to take out our ambassador
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.500]  who was an Arabist.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:39.500]  And the reason I say he's an Arabist, it was basically they wanted to kill him
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.500]  because he was too influential in the Arab world.
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:46.500]  He was too dangerous to Israeli interests, to Saudi interests,
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:50.500]  and to certain American national security interests run by the neocon.
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:54.500]  Now, when we say that Obama's by Carter, I work for Jimmy Carter
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:59.500]  and Jimmy Carter was the only president in the United States ever make a Camp David B support,
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:04.500]  the only president in the United States to implement the human rights issues
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:09.500]  and the only president of the United States to fire 4,000,
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:14.500]  listen to me very carefully, 4,000 human operatives of the CIA.
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:19.500]  He realized how disastrous the CIA had been
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:24.500]  and what General Eisenhower had said all along that this is a legacy of ashes
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:29.500]  and it will destroy our country until we contain and restrain the CIA.
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:33.500]  And this is where Jimmy Carter, a great president in retrospect,
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.500]  and I think Obama should be very proud of that,
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:40.500]  but the neocons of the great had to say this is our Jimmy Carter.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:45.500]  Jimmy Carter was the only president who ever made a peace treaty with Israel.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:50.500]  I worked with Anwar Sadat, I went with Menachem Begin, I worked with Terminals.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.500]  You got arrested by Assad.
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.500]  Yes, Freeman.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.500]  I mean, you got arrested.
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.500]  He was a great man.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.500]  Well, you know, someday you've got to come on and talk about all the amazing things.
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.500]  I mean, I know most of it's classified, but you know what's...
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.500]  It's not, I'll talk about it, but let's have some more time
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.500]  and I want to talk to your audience and thank them for listening and thank you.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.500]  Well, let me ask you this question briefly here, Dr. Pachennick.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.500]  Sure.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.500]  What is the strategy?
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.500]  Because I know you were on here a few months ago criticizing Obama.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.500]  I mean, I'm, again, I'm not, I'm apolitical.
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.500]  I'm not Romney or Obama.
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.500]  I want to get your perspective.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.500]  I respect your view and perspective.
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:22.500]  We're going to get another one here in a moment.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.500]  I want listeners to really, you know, hear this inside info for themselves
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.500]  and decide if they think it's accurate or not.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.500]  But what, how do they think they're going to get away with this?
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:31.500]  Putting al-Qaeda...
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:35.500]  We're going to get away with it because, as I told you on the last show,
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.500]  there's a real issue that MC had presented to the whole group of us
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:42.500]  that we're the military and our American military.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:47.500]  It's really concerned about, and that is a few minutes delay time
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:51.500]  or prepositioning time that Israel will not give the United States
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:55.500]  and it will launch an attack which are, presumably, by Netanyahu
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.500]  and the Israeli Defense Forces.
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:04.500]  Strategy will think, will force us into saving them from total destruction.
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:09.500]  And the answer is Netanyahu has no idea that Petraeus will not save him.
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:13.500]  Dempsey will not save him. Our Navy will not save him.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.500]  McRaven will not save him. Neither will Obama.
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.500]  He cannot get that message through.
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:23.500]  So he's pushing this through until he kills one of our ambassadors,
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:27.500]  precipitates what we call agitation propaganda,
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.500]  only with the approval of Saudi Arabia.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.500]  Saudi Arabian and Israel are twins.
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:37.500]  The doppelganger is no way you can separate Israel from Saudi Arabia
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:41.500]  or Saudi Arabia with Israel. They go back all the way to 9-11.
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.500]  They go back to the days when Jimmy Carter had fired 4,000 operatives
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:48.500]  because the people went to Saudi Arabia,
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:53.500]  those people who were left in the agency went to Saudi Arabia, the Mossad,
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.500]  and the Pakistani ISI to reconstitute an intelligence service
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.500]  which was totally illegal.
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:03.500]  And many of those who came in the Carter administration, Jews,
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:08.500]  by Dennis Ross, Martin Indeck, who was an operative underneath the Australian government,
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:11.500]  was an American citizen for only one day.
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.500]  He was appointed an American ambassador to Israel.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.500]  So Dennis Ross, the neocon, could control him.
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.500]  Let me stop right there.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:23.500]  Dr. Ramey, back on Tuesday to break this down.
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:29.500]  But bottom line, the 25 fleets, this is London Telegraph Associated Press,
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:34.500]  they're converging. 25 nations are converging on the strategically important thread of Hormuz.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.500]  They've never done this in the last five years of saber-rattling.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:42.500]  My intel is right now Israel has tentatively green-lit an attack
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:45.500]  anytime in the next month and a half against Iran.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:50.500]  Iran will then attack US bases all over the Middle East
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.500]  with their missiles drawing the United States in.
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:58.500]  By having the al-Qaeda groups that Saudi Arabia runs start attacking US facilities.
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:02.500]  They believe that will create a sympathetic response domestically in the US
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:09.500]  for a call to attack Arabs because people are politically and geopolitically totally ignorant
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.500]  to the level of basically being brain dead.
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:15.500]  And so now there's this saber-rattling, yeah, let's bomb the Arabs.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.500]  You can see the manipulation.
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:21.500]  The propaganda is what targeted about a five-year-old mentality.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.500]  Briefly, do you concur with that analysis?
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.500]  Yes, basically I'll summarize it in this.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.500]  He created the first holocaust of the Jews.
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:35.500]  The Netanyahu will be responsible for the second holocaust of the Jews in the 21st century.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:40.500]  He will be the Hitler of the 21st century to the Jews.
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.500]  On this New Year's Eve, this is what I say about Netanyahu.
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.500]  He was part of 9-11.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:51.500]  He was part of the conspiracy, the agitation propaganda, the killings,
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.500]  and now the agitation, the agitation of war.
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:58.500]  When that war goes, we will have a holocaust and a pogrom,
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.500]  the likes of which we haven't seen since the days of Hitler.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.500]  This is our new Hitler.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.500]  Okay, wow.
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:05.500]  Dr. Pachennick, thank you so much.
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:06.500]  We'll talk to you Tuesday.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.500]  My pleasure.
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.500]  Bye.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.500]  All right, there he goes.
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.500]  We have Dr. Webster Griffin tarply waiting,
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.500]  and I didn't even know this would go in this direction.
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:17.500]  I am in way over my head, and I study this stuff 24-7.
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.500]  Folks, if you knew who Dr. Pachennick was,
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.500]  I mean, he's been in every black op you can imagine.
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.500]  He's the guy Jack Ryan's based on in Patriot games.
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.500]  I mean, Webster Tarply is a doctor of history,
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.500]  an economist who's been all over the world,
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.500]  been to Tripoli under bombardment,
[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.500]  just been to Syria.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:37.500]  Pachennick's been arrested by Assad's dad before,
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.500]  back when he was the leader.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.500]  I mean, it's just, it's so wild.
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.500]  I don't even know what to say about this.
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.500]  Pachennick is pulling no punches.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:46.500]  I mean, I had no idea that would even go in that direction.
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:51.500]  And, you know, as for Netanyahu being Hitler, again,
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:52.500]  I don't have a dog in this fight.
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.500]  I just want my Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.500]  I don't want World War III.
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:59.500]  And, you know, you've got two famous Jews,
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.500]  like Netanyahu and you've got Pachennick who's Jewish,
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.500]  over there in this fight going on.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.500]  It's above my pay grade.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.500]  I'll tell you right now.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:09.500]  We're going to break Webster Tarply for the rest of the hour,
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:12.500]  who I highly respect on this issue.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.500]  Geopolitically, there's two people I respect more.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.500]  He's incredible in his historical understanding and analysis.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.500]  And I'm somebody that's somewhat learned.
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.500]  We'll just leave it at that.
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:23.500]  And we're going to come back with him.
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.500]  I am just absolutely flabbergasted right now.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.500]  And I'm speechless.
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:30.500]  But you're going to see a lot of wild stuff happen, folks,
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.500]  because the dollar is going into hyperinflation.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.500]  They're gearing up for martial law in the U.S.
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.500]  That's now publicly admitted.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.500]  1.4 billion bullets for Russia.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.500]  The Russians are lining up for war.
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.500]  The Western interests are trying to overthrow Russia,
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.500]  stirring them up.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:48.500]  There's fleets off the coast of China menacing them.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:51.500]  Japan's being agitated into conflict with China.
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.500]  And you've got just all of this craziness taking place.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:57.500]  This is the stuff you see before World Wars.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.500]  We'll be back.
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.500]  If you want an American company with American products
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.500]  made by Americans,

[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.500]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.500]  runs from bad to worse.
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:10.500]  The globalist model is to shut down societies
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.500]  and starve patriots out
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.500]  until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.500]  That's why we've assembled the most vital

[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:44.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:48.500]  Alright folks, Armada, a British naval power
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:52.500]  massing in the Gulf as Israel prepares an Iran strike.
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:55.500]  An Armada of US and British naval powers
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.500]  is massing in the Persian Gulf in the belief
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.500]  that Israel is considering a preemptive strike
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:00.500]  against Iran's covert nuclear weapons program.
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.500]  Now you've heard all my police sources,
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:05.500]  FBI, Defense Intelligence, you name it.
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:10.500]  I told you two months ago, late October, early November,
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.500]  even police departments, and you've heard the cops
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:15.500]  calling in mass when I say, here, just listen to police.
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:18.500]  They're being told in the intelligence units,
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:22.500]  get ready for total absolute collapse,
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:24.500]  airstrikes called in on US cities,
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:27.500]  martial law locked down in October,
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.500]  late October, early November.
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.500]  That doesn't mean this is going to happen.
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.500]  But the 1.4 billion bullets that have been purchased,
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:39.500]  that the media spun into 174,000 for the Department of Health
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:42.500]  and Human Services or Social Security.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:45.500]  That's how they strawman that when it finally broke
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.500]  and they gave a big story.
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.500]  Hundreds of millions more being purchased.
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:50.500]  Paul Wasen's got an article coming out tomorrow
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.500]  at infowars.com on that.
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.500]  I'm a guy that wants freedom.
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.500]  And to defeat the globalist and the global corporates
[01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.500]  that are anti-liberty, I've had to study reality.
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:05.500]  And I have really found a lot of how things tick.
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:08.500]  And I'm here to tell you folks that what you hear on the news
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.500]  and you see all the Sunday news shows,
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.500]  they normally worship Obama, turning on him today
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.500]  and grilling the UN ambassador for the US.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:20.500]  They are trying to do an October surprise to Carterize Obama.
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:23.500]  That's the article from Webster Tarpley up at infowars.com.
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:26.500]  That doesn't mean I like Obama.
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:29.500]  I would love for Mitt Romney to be a good guy.
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.500]  The point is, you can't sit here and just go,
[01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.500]  oh, well, Obama's an idiot.
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.500]  Look, he put Al Qaeda and Libby in Syria.
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:39.500]  Webster Tarpley went there and decried this policy.
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.500]  It's a ship of criminals.
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:44.500]  Okay, I mean, Hillary, Obama, scum.
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:47.500]  The point is, is that the facts are the facts.
[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:50.500]  All the lines lead back to the neocons
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.500]  and what happened to this ambassador.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:55.500]  Webster Tarpley, break down in layman's terms,
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:59.500]  where the world is today, the precipice we're at,
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.500]  and if you disagree that we're on the verge
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.500]  of what could be a World War III
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.500]  or financial collapse with QE Unlimited,
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.500]  and then get into what's happened with the ambassador,
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.500]  the rioting, the jihadis,
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.500]  that they admit our government runs,
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.500]  because if Obama put all the Al Qaeda in,
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.500]  why now are they turning against him?
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.500]  I mean, this is very complex.
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:18.500]  It's making my head spin.
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:20.500]  Webster, Dr. Tarpley, go ahead.
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.500]  Why don't we just proceed methodically
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:25.500]  and we can start with the attempted coup d'etat
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.500]  inside the United States,
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.500]  and then we can see what the ramifications might be
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.500]  in terms of October.
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.500]  The first thing to understand is
[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:37.500]  the agency that's making the Middle East blow up
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.500]  is the Romney campaign.
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.500]  The Romney campaign in the broadest sense,
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:45.500]  and of course the Romney campaign doesn't just mean,
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.500]  you know, this little clique of people in Boston.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.500]  It means the entire complex of forces
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.500]  that want Romney in and Obama out.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.500]  Now, in order to understand this,
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.500]  we've got to start with this CIA Mormon mafia.
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.500]  It's a faction in the CIA.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.500]  It's a faction in the FBI.
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:05.500]  It's known the Mormons send the young men overseas
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.500]  for two years to be missionaries.
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.500]  They learn foreign languages.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.500]  They come back, they go right into the CIA,
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.500]  and they had a protector in high places.
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:16.500]  For many years, this entire establishment
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.500]  was dominated by Henry Kissinger,
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.500]  but Henry Kissinger had a right-hand man,
[01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:22.500]  and that's Brent Scowcroft,
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.500]  and Brent Scowcroft was a top Mormon.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.500]  So using this policy that they have
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.500]  of promoting their own people,
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.500]  mutual admiration society,
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.500]  it's kind of like the neocons,
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:37.500]  the upper reaches of the U.S. national security bureaucracy
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.500]  are full of Mormons,
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.500]  and they realize that they want Romney
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.500]  because that will allow them to complete their careers
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.500]  at the highest possible level
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:49.500]  and have more power than they could have any other way.
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.500]  So CIA Mormon mafia.
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:54.500]  Now merged with that, as I've tried to point out,
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.500]  are the neocons.
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.500]  The neocons that were with Bush Cheney,
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.500]  some of them are more or less in the shadows.
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.500]  We've got a whole new group of neocons.
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:06.500]  John Bolton is probably the one element of continuity,
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.500]  but we've got Dan Sr.
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.500]  We've got Robert Joseph.
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.500]  We've got Robert Kagan.
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.500]  We've got a lot of these people, right?
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.500]  There's a different clique of neocons
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.500]  that want to get these posts.
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.500]  I call your attention to John Bolton, right?
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.500]  The guy with the mustache
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.500]  looks kind of like a walrus.
[01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:26.500]  You've seen him on TV.
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:28.500]  The guy who has very interesting admitted divorce papers.
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.500]  I don't know about that,
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.500]  but he's the big hater of the United Nations, right?
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.500]  He's built his career as being UN ambassador
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.500]  and saying that he hated it.
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.500]  He couldn't get confirmed by the Senate.
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.500]  Couldn't get confirmed by the U.S. Senate
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.500]  to be UN ambassador.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.500]  So this is one group.
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:46.500]  Now, separate from this,
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.500]  but allied, is, of course,
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.500]  Netanyahu and the Likud.
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:52.500]  What we've had in this past week
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.500]  is this huge intervention
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.500]  by Netanyahu into U.S. politics
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.500]  in favor of Romney.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.500]  Remember, Romney and Netanyahu
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.500]  are joined at the hip.
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.500]  They have been closest buddies
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.500]  since 1976
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.500]  at the Boston Consulting Group
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:10.500]  when they sat together in the same cubicle.
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:12.500]  It's been an alliance all these years.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.500]  BB gives MIT
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.500]  advice about politics.
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.500]  MIT gives BB advice about
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.500]  finance and how to design
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.500]  sanctions and so forth.
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.500]  You saw Netanyahu coming out saying
[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.500]  you cannot give us a red light
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.500]  because you don't have a red line.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.500]  So the United States is supposed to commit
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.500]  to war under some
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.500]  future eventuality.
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.500]  That would be unconstitutional,
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.500]  because we do have this question to the Congress.
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:40.500]  So Netanyahu also
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:42.500]  he doesn't have a red line.
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.500]  He has never said under what circumstances
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.500]  he would strike.
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.500]  So Netanyahu wants the U.S.
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:50.500]  to be more Israeli than the Israelis
[01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.500]  to be all the way out in front
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.500]  on this crazy idea
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.500]  of attacking Iran. We also had the deputy
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.500]  head of the Israeli Knesset
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.500]  on Morning Joe, on MSNBC.
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.500]  Let me just stop you. I want to tell
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:04.500]  all the good old boys.
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:06.500]  Calling for immediate war.
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.500]  No, I will, but I just want to add
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.500]  for all the good old boys that want to
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.500]  start a war and think it's fun.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.500]  I hope they enjoy $10 a gallon gas
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.500]  and the trade war moves kids close. Go ahead.
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.500]  Yeah, and of course it's
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.500]  the sky's the limit with this stuff.
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.500]  So we've got the Mormon Mafia.
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.500]  We've got the Neocons
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.500]  having joined the
[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:28.500]  Romney campaign.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.500]  You've also got to figure that the Saudis are in on this.
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.500]  I think the Saudis would rather have
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.500]  Obama out Romney in.
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.500]  The importance of them
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.500]  is that they're the paymasters
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.500]  of these terrorist groups, right?
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.500]  The al-Qaeda groups, the Wahhabites.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.500]  They're the handlers. The Salafis.
[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.500]  They're the handlers, but they're also the guys
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.500]  who pay, right, along with Qatar
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.500]  and with the United Arab Emirates
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.500]  and the rest of these reactionary monarchies
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.500]  in the Gulf. So what did they do?
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.500]  There are a number
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.500]  of sides to this thing. It's a multi-pronged
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.500]  faction converging
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.500]  on this and they've got intersecting
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.500]  operations.
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:06.500]  Maybe we should start with this film.
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.500]  Now the film is not the cause
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.500]  but the film is the public relations
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.500]  cover. It's a kind of
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.500]  atmospheric that allows people
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.500]  to think they understand what's going on.
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.500]  So this is now
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.500]  the film, The Desert Warriors
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.500]  and then it became the innocence
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.500]  of bin Laden
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.500]  and then it became the innocence of Muslims
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:28.500]  and it's
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.500]  15 or so minutes of
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.500]  garbage, right? It's scurrilous.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.500]  Stay there. We're going to come right back Webster
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.500]  and we've got a hard break here for news.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.500]  When we come back, we'll look at this.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.500]  By the way, Webster Tarpley wrote the unauthorized
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.500]  biography on Obama. To be clear,
[01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.500]  he doesn't like Obama.
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.500]  This is not a political hack up here.
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500]  See, our love of the truth,
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.500]  our love of what's really going on, that comes
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.500]  first. You're not going to hear this anywhere else.
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:54.500]  Which is kind of scary.
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:56.500]  This is really
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.500]  amazing stuff we're watching happen.
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.500]  We'll be back.
[01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.500]  We'll be back.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.500]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.500]  Did you know that the global elite
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.500]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.500]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.500]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.500]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.500]  than silver or gold? It's true,
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:14.500]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.500]  before in this country and it's possible
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.500]  that could even happen again. So our friends
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.500]  at Solutions from Science have put together
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:22.500]  the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.500]  They call it a survival
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.500]  seed bank and it can produce
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.500]  an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.500]  for you and your family.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.500]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.500]  been genetically modified in any way
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.500]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.500]  a full acre crisis garden.
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.500]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.500]  That's survivalseedbank.com
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.500]  or give them a call
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.500]  at 877-327-0365.
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.500]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:54.500]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.500]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:58.500]  This is Alex Jones for
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:26.500]  survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.500]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.500]  that requires no maintenance
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.500]  nor replacement parts for the life
[01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:36.500]  of the unit. This product
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:38.500]  was designed to be an invaluable part
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:40.500]  of your vital preparations.
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.500]  For a detailed report on the differences
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.500]  between ionic silver, colloidal silver
[01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.500]  and what most silver solution
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.500]  manufacturers are producing,
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:50.500]  please visit our website at
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.500]  www.silverlungs.com
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.500]  for more information on why you
[01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:56.500]  should be producing your own silver solutions
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.500]  right from your home forever.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:28.500]  Thank you for watching.
[01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:58.500]  We now take you live
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.500]  to the Central Texas Command Center
[01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:02.500]  in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:30.500]  Well, Webster Griffin Tarpley joins us.
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.500]  Here are three books on Obama
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.500]  and the criminals that run him.
[01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:36.500]  And now, here he is on air
[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:38.500]  to an Obama.
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.500]  And now, here he is
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.500]  telling us that, well,
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:44.500]  the forces behind Mitt Romney
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.500]  that won a big war
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:48.500]  in a new arms race, basically,
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.500]  that they
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:52.500]  are the ones
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.500]  behind all this unrest.
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:56.500]  Well, then Obama sure fell into their trap
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:58.500]  because Obama is the one,
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.500]  the peace prize winner that
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:02.500]  bombed Libya and is now using
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.500]  al-Qaeda to attack Syria.
[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.500]  And Webster has been to both countries
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:08.500]  under bombardment. Webster has
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.500]  had a lot of courage to do that.
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.500]  So it really shows you that once you get into
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:14.500]  all this cloak and dagger stuff,
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:16.500]  basically the ruling class here is so
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:18.500]  reckless and so amoral
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.500]  that they're biting themselves
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.500]  in the, you know, what?
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.500]  I mean, it really comes to a point
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.500]  where Hitler turns east towards Russia,
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.500]  Napoleon does it, other empires
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.500]  go to Afghanistan to die.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.500]  It shows a hubris, a contempt.
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.500]  Webster, I know you want to walk through
[01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:36.500]  the continuum of all this. We have your
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:38.500]  article, October Surprise to
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:40.500]  Carterize. Explain that, Obama.
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.500]  Again, October Surprise to Carterize Obama
[01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:44.500]  up at infowars.com
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:46.500]  and prisonplanet.com right now, along with
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.500]  all the other insane news. But you can see
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.500]  the embassies getting attacked,
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.500]  the American flags getting burned,
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.500]  the, and this cover
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.500]  boits this film, even though this started
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:58.500]  before that even got hyped up.
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:00.500]  Clearly this is being orchestrated
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:02.500]  to try to do just like 1980
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.500]  where all the, you know, the Muslims
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.500]  respected Mitt Romney when he, you know,
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.500]  when he gets in, they'll stand down.
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:10.500]  And again, the whole thing staged.
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.500]  I'm not supporting Obama either.
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.500]  I know that you haven't been an Obama
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.500]  supporter. The point is, this could
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.500]  lead to World War Three as every main
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.500]  line analyst is saying, even the chairman
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.500]  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.500]  Dempsey, who's been pro-war in the past
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.500]  came out and said, if Israel attacks,
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.500]  we're not involved and we're not helping,
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.500]  that's a serious message. So now,
[01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:32.500]  this is a way to prod the U.S.
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:34.500]  into action.
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:36.500]  I mean, at least that's what it seems like.
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.500]  So you've laid out some of the pieces here.
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:40.500]  Tell us what the game
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:42.500]  plan is from all your sources
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.500]  there in D.C., where you live there,
[01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.500]  next to D.C. and Maryland,
[01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.500]  and where you see this going, and what the
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:50.500]  larger strategy is
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.500]  to strike Iran. Is it purely political,
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.500]  or is Israel really worried
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.500]  about nuclear weapons?
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:58.500]  The essence of the strategy right now is to put
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:00.500]  Romney in the White House, and then Netanyahu
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.500]  gets everything he wants, with war
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:04.500]  or without war. A lot of the war talk
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:06.500]  right now is a hype to try
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:08.500]  to get people to stampede in the direction of
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.500]  Romney. But let me just go back. This
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:12.500]  film, okay, the film that we started
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.500]  to talk about, the key guy
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:16.500]  in the group of people around that film
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:18.500]  is this guy Nazrallah. Nazrallah
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:20.500]  the Coptic Christian.
[01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:22.500]  And he leads you directly
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:24.500]  into the so-called Islamophobia
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:26.500]  network. It leads
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:28.500]  to a group of people that includes Pamela
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:30.500]  Geller. It's an organization
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:32.500]  called Stop Islamization
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.500]  of America
[01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.500]  Now. There's one
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:38.500]  called Stop the Islamization
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.500]  of Europe Now. There's Stop the
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:42.500]  Islamization of All Nations Now. It's
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:44.500]  an international network. They've got
[01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:46.500]  that guy Gert Wilders from Holland
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.500]  Islamophobic
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.500]  Racebader. But you
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.500]  go from Nazrallah
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.500]  to this Islamophobia network. And who
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:56.500]  do you find in the middle of the Islamophobia
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:58.500]  network? John Bolton
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.500]  Top Neocon and
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:02.500]  likely Secretary of State
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:04.500]  in a Romney administration. Sure, all this goes
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:06.500]  without saying Webster that
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:08.500]  it's a cartoon. It's just
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:10.500]  like the Mohammed cartoons put out
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:12.500]  by the Neocons and the media covers it
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.500]  so the Muslims burn down
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.500]  half of Europe so they have a pretext
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:18.500]  to then invade more.
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.500]  Four. Bolton
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:22.500]  spoke on WMA already or here in Washington
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:24.500]  this week. Here's Politico
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:26.500]  and he says, I come back
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:28.500]  to Tehran in 1979
[01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:30.500]  if we're not careful here we're going to see
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:32.500]  a repetition of that crisis
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:34.500]  which was of course a major factor
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:36.500]  in contributing to the destruction
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:38.500]  of the Jimmy Carter administration. So it's
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:40.500]  clear what they want to do. They've been
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.500]  managing Obama on a Carter
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.500]  plan
[01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:46.500]  up to now, right, the trilaterals
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:48.500]  the builder birds, all these people Wall Street
[01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.500]  and now they want to get him out
[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:52.500]  and in order to get him out what do you need? Well what
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:54.500]  got Carter out? A hostage crisis
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.500]  and an October surprise. In the case
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:58.500]  of the October surprise
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.500]  it was to prevent Carter from freeing
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.500]  the hostages, right, the famous negotiations
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.500]  of George H. W. Bush
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:06.500]  Bush the elder talking to the
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:08.500]  mullahs in Iran
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:10.500]  telling them don't free any
[01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:12.500]  hostages, deal with us later on. I think
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.500]  they learned to regret this.
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:16.500]  So there is no doubt
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:18.500]  that the film is essentially a production
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:20.500]  of the Romney campaign. Now let's
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.500]  go to the death of the ambassador
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:24.500]  this Arabist ambassador
[01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:26.500]  new Arabic, new
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:28.500]  French, this is J. Christopher
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.500]  Stevens.
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:32.500]  Why would he be killed?
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.500]  Well first of all you get many signals
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:36.500]  of an inside job
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:38.500]  right, he was according to the things I've seen
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:40.500]  he was not at the actual consulate
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.500]  he was over
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.500]  at a safe house nearby
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:46.500]  which should not have been known to the
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.500]  people attacking the consulate
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:50.500]  whatever that was. But it was
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.500]  known and they began attacking with mortars
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:54.500]  right, people have talked about the professional
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:56.500]  coordinated
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.500]  high level quality of the attack on the safe
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:00.500]  house which eventually killed
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:02.500]  Ambassador Stevens.
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.500]  Who killed him?
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:06.500]  Well the indications coming out of
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:08.500]  Libya, of course it was planned
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.500]  and it was carried out by an organization
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:12.500]  called Ansar Al-Sharia
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.500]  and the head of that
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:16.500]  is a guy called Kumu
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.500]  Q-U-M-U
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:20.500]  Kumu. So this guy
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:22.500]  Kumu is a graduate
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:24.500]  of the Guantanamo Bay
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:26.500]  training school because that's what's going on
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:28.500]  in Guantanamo now. Guantanamo
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:30.500]  one of the reasons Obama couldn't close it
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:32.500]  it's used for training
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:34.500]  because they let these people out
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:36.500]  after they've been carefully prepared
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:38.500]  to do what they want to do. There was
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:40.500]  this guy Shiri was let out
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:42.500]  he created Al-Qaeda
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.500]  in the Arabian Peninsula. He's now I think
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.500]  been killed a couple of weeks ago. No, it's a training camp
[01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:48.500]  under the cover. A training camp. So
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:50.500]  Kumu is a CIA
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:52.500]  asset and Kumu then goes and
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.500]  kills the US Ambassador. Now that's where
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:56.500]  I'd say call the Mormon
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:58.500]  Mafia and ask them what's going
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:00.500]  on with that. Why is
[01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:02.500]  a CIA asset killing a
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:04.500]  US Ambassador, right? Why did they
[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.500]  agree with Pachinic, Dr. Pachinic
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.500]  that it was Israel
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.500]  the Likudniks
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.500]  with Saudi Arabian intelligence because
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:14.500]  why is- I'm telling you it's the
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.500]  CIA Mormon Mafia. Let's get right
[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:18.500]  to the heart of the matter. Without the CIA
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:20.500]  the CIA ran that guy.
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.500]  He was trained in Guantanamo
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:24.500]  to do what the CIA wanted.
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:26.500]  Always beware these people
[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:28.500]  who are telling you, blame somebody else.
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.500]  Blame somebody, you know, blame
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:32.500]  somebody- Got it.
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:34.500]  Let's talk about- hold on
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:36.500]  Webster. Webster, let's talk about
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:38.500]  let's talk about then
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:40.500]  Obama. Why is he having
[01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:42.500]  the Ambassador co-out on TV
[01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:44.500]  and say, oh this wasn't coordinated.
[01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:46.500]  It was a few protesters
[01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:48.500]  and Obama
[01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:50.500]  called people and everything's fine now.
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.500]  Why is Obama playing in
[01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.500]  to the lie then?
[01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:56.500]  Well Obama of course
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:58.500]  is a feckless puppet, right? Obama
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.500]  is a Wall Street puppet.
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:02.500]  I think Obama has figured out
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:04.500]  by now that his former patrons
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:06.500]  and masters have decided to dump him.
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:08.500]  That's what makes this moment
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:10.500]  so interesting. It's a little bit like
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:12.500]  Harry Truman in 1948,
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:14.500]  right? The reactionary Wall
[01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:16.500]  Street people wanted to dump him, but somehow
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.500]  he was able to stay on.
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:20.500]  So I think people have to go- Alright, give us
[01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:22.500]  big picture. Where is it all
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.500]  headed? I mean the intel we're getting
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:26.500]  is- It's headed towards
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:28.500]  the seizure of power by Romney and the
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:30.500]  neocons. Now what does that mean?
[01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:32.500]  It means another reversal of the field,
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:34.500]  right? Remember we had
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.500]  Bush chaining neocons, war in
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:38.500]  all directions, bomb them, invade them,
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.500]  rivers of blood
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.500]  for the U.S., you know, tremendous
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:44.500]  expenditures, and then we had Obama
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:46.500]  and Obama says, no, I do it all
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.500]  with color revolutions. I do it all
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:50.500]  cheaply. He has
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:52.500]  drones, he has special forces.
[01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:54.500]  He did have the one
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:56.500]  that- That's the Pentagon model. That's
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:58.500]  what the Pentagon likes, Obama.
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.500]  The divine plan. It's a CIA
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:02.500]  plan. CIA is a guy called
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:04.500]  divine. So it's not the divine plan
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:06.500]  in the sense of God, but it's
[01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:08.500]  DEVINE, and this is
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.500]  what they're carrying out. Now
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:12.500]  the neocons- Which is Brzezinski.
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:14.500]  The neocons say that's not good enough.
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:16.500]  We want to start, you know, smashing
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:18.500]  more people. And they also say the Russians
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.500]  and the Chinese continue to defy us.
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:22.500]  We just had 30
[01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:24.500]  countries meeting in Tehran as
[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:26.500]  friends of Syria. We just had
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:28.500]  130, 140 countries meeting
[01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:30.500]  in Tehran. They're saying their strategy
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:32.500]  isn't working. So the idea would be
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:34.500]  to reverse the field and go back
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:36.500]  to a war-like
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:38.500]  aggressive foreign policy, and for
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.500]  that they would like Romney and the
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:42.500]  neocons, and Secretary of State John
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:44.500]  Poulton, who's got his fingers in this
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:46.500]  movie somehow. Yes,
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:48.500]  absolutely. Now let's talk about where
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:50.500]  all this goes, though, with
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.500]  the Iran strike. I mean, they don't have the police
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:54.500]  running around digging in for World War 3
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:56.500]  for nothing. They're not buying 1.4
[01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:58.500]  billion bullets for Homeland Security to play
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:22.500]  deadly wanks.
[01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:30.500]  This is what my family uses.
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:32.500]  InfoWars.com already has the lowest price

[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:02.500]  For thousands of years,
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:04.500]  silver has been used as both a medicine and a
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:06.500]  preservative. But not all silver is equal.
[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:08.500]  SilverSol is an amazing new technology that has
[01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:10.500]  been clinically shown to be several hundred
[01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:12.500]  times more effective than colloid or ionic
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.500]  silvers. It can destroy thousands of times
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:16.500]  more pathogens than older silver technology.
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.500]  SilverSol resonates at the same frequency
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.500]  as germicidal light used in labs
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:22.500]  to kill bacteria and viruses, enabling it
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:24.500]  to kill without direct contact.

[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:22.500]  To counter this is to freeze
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:24.500]  your food cost to today's prices
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:26.500]  by getting your own supply of foods
[01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:28.500]  from Eat Foods Direct now. As the price
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:30.500]  of raw ingredients increases, Eat Foods
[01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:32.500]  will have to raise prices too. Now is the time
[01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:34.500]  to get your supply. I recently increased
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:36.500]  my supply from Eat Foods Direct because
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:38.500]  we've all known this was coming. You know about

[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.500]  for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.500]  and avoiding the rising food cost. Don't wait.

[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.500]  11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central tomorrow
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.500]  at Noon Central,
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:36.500]  1 p.m.
[01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:38.500]  Eastern.
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:40.500]  So 1 p.m. Eastern, 12
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:42.500]  Noon Central. We're going to have
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:44.500]  Website Carplion for a full hour tomorrow,
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:46.500]  maybe even a second hour and take phone calls
[01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:48.500]  because we're trying to get down into real
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:50.500]  issues here. Not, hey,
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.500]  there's some brown people over there
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:54.500]  and they're burning our flags
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:56.500]  so let's attack Iran
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:58.500]  when it's the Wahhabist out of Saudi
[01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:00.500]  Arabia that are Sunni
[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:02.500]  that the globalist control that
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:04.500]  they're using to do all this
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.500]  and our media says Iran's behind
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.500]  al-Qaeda. I'm not a fan of the
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:10.500]  moulas. I don't want to live under that type
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:12.500]  of, you know, control. I'm not
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:14.500]  for Iran. I'm for freedom.
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:16.500]  I'm for not having World War 3
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.500]  and they think you're so stupid, folks.
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:20.500]  They tell you Iran is al-Qaeda.
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:22.500]  I mean, the Sunnis
[01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:24.500]  and Shiites hate each other more
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:26.500]  than
[01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:28.500]  there's any strife between Christians
[01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:30.500]  and Muslims, but the system
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:32.500]  plays on your inherent
[01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:34.500]  ignorance. Now, here's the deal.
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.500]  The government is digging in.
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:38.500]  Government is preparing. I've interviewed
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.500]  police off record
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:42.500]  and on record, as you've heard
[01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.500]  her on the air, but my sources all
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:46.500]  over the country, including police chiefs
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:48.500]  have been told
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:50.500]  late October all hell is going to break
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:52.500]  they said just get ready
[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:54.500]  is going to be like nothing you've ever seen.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:56.500]  They've got the fleets massing
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:58.500]  like never before.
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.500]  I talked to one of my sources
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:02.500]  earlier this week
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:04.500]  out of
[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:06.500]  West Texas town. I'll just leave it at that
[01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:08.500]  where the B-1 bombers were based, which are
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:10.500]  good weapons, but they also break
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.500]  a lot, so they never use them unless they're
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:14.500]  about to have a war. They've been sent to the Middle East
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:16.500]  and I called my other source. They said,
[01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:18.500]  yeah, the B-2 bombers, the B-1
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:20.500]  bombers, they're all over there now.
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:22.500]  Everything is matched, okay?
[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:24.500]  So they're getting ready.
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:26.500]  With the backdrop is the world financial meltdown
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:28.500]  and the banks looting everybody.
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:30.500]  Webster, we've got about ten minutes left.
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.500]  You've got the floor to take a sound.
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.500]  Pull back. Give us the big picture here.
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.500]  Where is all this going?
[01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.500]  How serious is the Iran strike
[01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:40.500]  threat? What should we expect
[01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:42.500]  if there is that strike?
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:44.500]  Well, just remember, the Iran strike
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:46.500]  would be best conducted
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:48.500]  from the point of view of the ruling class
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:50.500]  by Romney with the neocon
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:52.500]  administration. Now
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:54.500]  there is the problem of
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:56.500]  Obama right now that they'd like
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:58.500]  to get rid of.
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:00.500]  One of the problems in their way
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:02.500]  is that the Romney campaign is so
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.500]  stupid, so bungling and so inept,
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:06.500]  they could have come out of this
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.500]  week with a big advantage and
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:10.500]  I'm not sure they've come out with any.
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:12.500]  The hope that they have is that they'll
[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:14.500]  make up for it in coming weeks. When this
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.500]  stuff began to happen, when you had
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:18.500]  the demonstration at the U.S. Embassy
[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.500]  in Cairo, Egypt and then you had
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:22.500]  the killing of a consular
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:24.500]  official, as they heard it,
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:26.500]  in Benghazi, Libya
[01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:28.500]  in the terror corridor
[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:30.500]  right, the Benghazi,
[01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:32.500]  Derna, Tobruk terror corridor.
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:34.500]  That's when Romney decided to shoot
[01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:36.500]  his mouth off. He had said,
[01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:38.500]  oh, 9-11, I won't say anything.
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:40.500]  I'll have an embargo.
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.500]  But he couldn't restrain himself
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:44.500]  because Romney had written a book called
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.500]  No Apologies, and obviously the
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:48.500]  neocons had ghostwritten a book
[01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:50.500]  for him. It's the Republican
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:52.500]  talking point that Obama apologizes
[01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:54.500]  all the time. It's not really clear
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.500]  that that's true, but this was
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.500]  something, Romney was Pavlovian dog
[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.500]  trained to react to this.
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:02.500]  So as soon as somebody said
[01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:04.500]  we regret or we don't believe
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:06.500]  in this, Romney
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:08.500]  sees that and said, alright, you're
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:10.500]  apologizing. So he had to put out
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:12.500]  very badly timed
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:14.500]  press release, right?
[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:16.500]  There is a question with Romney, even
[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:18.500]  with the ruling class on his side,
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:20.500]  can he get himself elected?
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:22.500]  Because he's such a bungler.
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:24.500]  Now, let me at this
[01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:26.500]  point, I've got to ask this, we'll talk about it more tomorrow.
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:28.500]  Could the
[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:30.500]  Obama controlling faction of the globalist
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:32.500]  could they go ahead
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:34.500]  and launch the war or
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:36.500]  authorize Israel to
[01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:38.500]  as their own October surprise? I see
[01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:40.500]  it more of two camps fighting
[01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:42.500]  over who gets to launch the war
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:44.500]  and be the hero. There is
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.500]  this question, right? There is the
[01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:48.500]  complication of the rally
[01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:50.500]  round effect. In other words, the
[01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.500]  neocons, I think
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:54.500]  they've shown their political stupidity
[01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:56.500]  repeatedly in practice and Netanyahu
[01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.500]  in terms of
[01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:00.500]  international politics has shown how stupid
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:02.500]  he is. But the point
[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:04.500]  is if you have a big international
[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.500]  crisis, most
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:08.500]  Americans will rally around the president
[01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.500]  whoever that is. And you can see
[01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:12.500]  that even under Carter, right? Carter
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:14.500]  when you had the
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:16.500]  Desert One, right? The failed attempt to rescue
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:18.500]  the hostages in the spring
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:20.500]  of 1980. Carter
[01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:22.500]  got a bounce out of that that helped him
[01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:24.500]  win the Democratic primaries against Teddy
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:26.500]  Kennedy. So they're playing with something
[01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.500]  which is a problem for them. But
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:30.500]  I think underneath it, it's not so much
[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:32.500]  the election that they're
[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:34.500]  worried about right now, although they want to win
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:36.500]  the election for Romney, it's how could
[01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:38.500]  you get Obama
[01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:40.500]  to emborse an attack?
[01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:42.500]  You have to stampede him.
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:44.500]  And the idea with that is the big
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.500]  danger of the Israeli attack on Iran
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:48.500]  or maybe
[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:50.500]  somebody attacking Syria, right? Maybe
[01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:52.500]  some European country
[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:54.500]  NATO country, right? Maybe France
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:56.500]  something like this, attacking Syria.
[01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:58.500]  This could then be used to
[01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:00.500]  browbeat Obama and get him
[01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:02.500]  to do things that I don't think he wants to do
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.500]  not because he's a patriot but because
[01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:06.500]  of his very narrow interest
[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:08.500]  in staying in power and not screwing up
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.500]  his relations with his own base.
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.500]  So if you're going to have an attack
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.500]  and you want to stampede Obama
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:16.500]  you got to do that in the last
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:18.500]  week, 10 days, 2 weeks
[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:20.500]  maybe before
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:22.500]  the election so that you can tell Obama
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.500]  if you don't join in this attack
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:26.500]  you'll be denounced as a traitor.
[01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:28.500]  I agree and the reason I raise
[01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:30.500]  this analysis is that's what I see happening
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.500]  here. The minute it started
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:34.500]  it's two way and I agree it's CIA
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.500]  or a faction that's neocon connected
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:38.500]  in the final equation that did do this
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:40.500]  with command and control
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.500]  and handling by the Saudis as you said
[01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.500]  so in a way you do agree with Pachennik
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:46.500]  but correct me if I'm wrong. The issue
[01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.500]  here is that
[01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:50.500]  they've got to stampede
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.500]  the kind of Chicago mafia
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:54.500]  Clintonista arm
[01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:56.500]  into politically
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:58.500]  not being able to deal with burning American flags
[01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:00.500]  embassies attack, U.S. troops killed
[01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.500]  ambassador killed and so the
[01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:04.500]  CIA is in control of that
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.500]  al-Qaeda network they use to take over Libya
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.500]  and now part of Syria and so
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:10.500]  they're in control and they're like
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:12.500]  hey Obama we just have this network
[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:14.500]  you know
[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:16.500]  attack some of your holdings
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:18.500]  we're going to blame you now for not responding
[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.500]  so it is clear who's running
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:22.500]  this channel the question is
[01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:24.500]  is it going well for those factions
[01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:26.500]  will they now double down and intensify
[01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.500]  the destabilization program
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:30.500]  well as I say
[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:32.500]  the ineptitude and bungling
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:34.500]  of Romney is right now a factor
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.500]  in world history in its own right
[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:38.500]  that his obvious play
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:40.500]  this past week was to shut up
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.500]  don't say anything and let Obama
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.500]  take the heat for what's happening
[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:46.500]  because everybody would then turn around and blame
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:48.500]  Obama but Romney had to get himself
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:50.500]  in the middle of it and half the Republicans
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:52.500]  then turned against him
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.500]  but again these are not the main
[01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:56.500]  things I think the idea is
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:58.500]  to create hysteria now
[01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:00.500]  you're talking about these police chiefs
[01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:02.500]  and others being told that something big
[01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:04.500]  is going to happen consider this
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:06.500]  in recent world
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:08.500]  history we have the so-called pre-Munich
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:10.500]  plot right that Chamberlain
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:12.500]  wanted to appease Hitler
[01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:14.500]  he wanted to give Hitler everything
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:16.500]  he wanted and in
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:18.500]  the various series of meetings
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:20.500]  that we think of as the Munich
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:22.500]  process right the Munich sellout
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:24.500]  there were three meetings
[01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:26.500]  at least got a minute and a half left
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:28.500]  in the middle of all this
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:30.500]  Chamberlain creates this hysteria
[01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:32.500]  right Chamberlain wants to sell out to Hitler
[01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:34.500]  so he has start digging trenches
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:36.500]  in the park give everybody a gas
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:38.500]  mask convince them that war is at
[01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:40.500]  hand and then they'll
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.500]  support whatever you do now it
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:44.500]  could be that this intelligence
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:46.500]  agency faction and again I
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.500]  no no no I agree they're always telling
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:50.500]  they're always telling people that
[01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:52.500]  you know that this is coming
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:54.500]  it's just I've never seen this level of chatter
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.500]  plus B1 bombers B2 bombers
[01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:58.500]  25 nations fleets
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:00.500]  massing while the dollar
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:02.500]  begins to implode I mean Webster
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:04.500]  so you're saying you're not worried about an Iran strike
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.500]  oh I'm worried I'm worried about a serious
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:08.500]  strike perhaps even more I think
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:10.500]  the serious strike would have to be the prelude
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.500]  to the Iran strike sure that's
[01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:14.500]  that's the one that's that's more on the
[01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:16.500]  on the take it out first and you were just
[01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:18.500]  in Syria recently we're going to talk
[01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:20.500]  about this tomorrow Webster
[01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:22.500]  amazing I have to say I agree with
[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:24.500]  your analysis from all of my research
[01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:26.500]  this is a very dangerous time
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.500]  because I think the ruling class
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:30.500]  is even fighting with each other and
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:32.500]  you know it's good to have separation of powers
[01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:34.500]  but man this is this is crazy
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:36.500]  what is the time you've got
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:38.500]  you've got this ongoing financial
[01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:40.500]  collapse in the background right you've got
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.500]  you you you always have to figure that
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:44.500]  you know the the biggest
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:46.500]  danger at any point in the year is this
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:48.500]  September October
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:50.500]  period right the transition from the third quarter
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:52.500]  to the fourth quarter because of all the traditional
[01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:54.500]  payment deadlines and everything
[01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:56.500]  together with that so we've got Spain
[01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:58.500]  on the brink right these
[01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:00.500]  Spanish
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:02.500]  states right Catalonia under Lucia
[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:04.500]  going bankrupt
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.500]  Draghi saying that he's going to
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:08.500]  provide support for the
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:10.500]  bonds but only if you
[01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:12.500]  agree to the IMF
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:14.500]  conditionalities and now we've got this
[01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:16.500]  the QE3
[01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:18.500]  would have been a help to Obama but I think
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:20.500]  it's coming too late for Obama so
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.500]  I still think that the ruling class
[01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:24.500]  is in favor of Romney not
[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:26.500]  Obama and that becomes a very important
[01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:28.500]  sure it shows how petty they are that as soon
[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:30.500]  as Romney attacked
[01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:32.500]  Bernanke and said he would get rid of him
[01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:34.500]  Bernanke then did the QE Unlimited
[01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:36.500]  we're going to talk about it tomorrow Webster in-depth
[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:38.500]  we'll start tomorrow on the financial situation
[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:40.500]  11am
[01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:42.500]  central tomorrow info wars.com
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:44.500]  www.tarpley.net
[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:46.500]  thank you so much Webster and thank you
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:48.500]  to all the listeners for listening and taking action
[01:57:48.500 --> 01:58:14.500]  good job crew
