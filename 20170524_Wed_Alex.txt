[00:00.000 --> 00:25.620]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show in these historic times on planet Earth, in the country known
[00:25.620 --> 00:30.400]  as the United States of America. Filling in for Alex Jones is Owen Troyer today. We will be
[00:30.400 --> 00:36.080]  hearing from Alex, I'm sure, at some point along the road. We will also be having Dr. Ed Group in
[00:36.080 --> 00:42.660]  studio for the last two hours. He will be joining me. We'll be talking health, winning battles that
[00:42.660 --> 00:46.620]  we're winning right now in the health battle, making people healthier again, getting some of
[00:46.620 --> 00:51.960]  the poisons out of our food. But right now, I've got stacks of news to cover. So just briefly,
[00:51.960 --> 01:00.540]  we'll go over kind of the waterfront here. President Trump has a boost in the daily tracking
[01:00.540 --> 01:06.060]  polls. He's up to a 48% approval rating. That's not the highest he's been, but it's higher than he
[01:06.060 --> 01:12.580]  has been at any other point in, I think the last seven days or so. You know, and I was sitting here
[01:12.580 --> 01:17.780]  thinking about this. I mean, my support of President Trump waivers, I would say right now,
[01:17.780 --> 01:24.980]  it's probably close to about 90%. The 10% would be the foreign policies that I don't like,
[01:24.980 --> 01:31.220]  the Kushner negotiations that I don't like, or whatever influence Kushner has on this White
[01:31.220 --> 01:37.620]  House that none of us voted for. But I'm wondering, I'm scratching my head, what would Donald Trump's
[01:37.620 --> 01:44.140]  approval rating be without the fake news? What would Donald Trump's, what would President Trump's
[01:44.140 --> 01:51.340]  approval rating be without the fake news attacking him 24 seven? And that's not just the fake news
[01:51.340 --> 01:59.820]  that's been attacking Donald Trump for the last two years, also the Russia narrative. You know,
[01:59.820 --> 02:07.500]  I can't even believe this. Whether Seth Rich was the DNC leaker to WikiLeaks or not, whether it
[02:07.500 --> 02:12.700]  was Seth Rich or not, there is literally more evidence that would point to it being Seth Rich
[02:12.700 --> 02:17.860]  than the Russians. Now, we're not getting that from the DC police, are we? We're not getting
[02:17.860 --> 02:23.740]  that from the FBI, are we? No, it has to be Americans on the internet doing work for themselves.
[02:23.740 --> 02:28.660]  And now Sean Hannity, who is reporting on this for Fox is backing off. We'll talk about Seth
[02:28.660 --> 02:36.460]  Rich. There's more developing on this. It's just, it's just, it's just crazy. And again,
[02:36.460 --> 02:43.980]  John Podesta, we found it in the WikiLeaks. Hmm. How I don't even know if irony is the right word
[02:43.980 --> 02:49.820]  for this. I mean, Seth Rich, here's a guy who's just a good old fashioned American member of the
[02:49.820 --> 02:55.180]  Democrat Party who wants to see a fair election. That's all. How dare you interfere with Hillary
[02:55.180 --> 03:00.940]  Clinton stealing the election. But again, hey, maybe it wasn't Seth Rich. John Podesta said
[03:00.940 --> 03:09.420]  in the emails that he would make an example, whether it was the leaker or not. No investigation
[03:09.420 --> 03:15.740]  into that. Instead, we're spinning tops looking for Russia all day long. And I'm sitting here
[03:15.740 --> 03:21.780]  thinking about this and we'll talk with Ed Group about this, but people are have literally gone
[03:21.780 --> 03:29.220]  completely mental. They have completely lost their minds. Think about all of the time, all of the
[03:29.220 --> 03:35.860]  energy, all of the resources that we're spending on this Russia investigation. And President Trump
[03:35.860 --> 03:41.060]  is sitting here handcuffed because here's a businessman who wants to cut the fat. He's already
[03:41.060 --> 03:45.860]  cutting into the budget. We'll talk about that taxpayer first budget cuts. That's good. We'll
[03:45.860 --> 03:52.020]  cover that. But he must be seeing this Russia investigation and wanting to pull his hair out.
[03:52.020 --> 03:59.700]  What a waste of time. What a waste of money. What a total waste. We might as well be sending
[03:59.700 --> 04:05.940]  these people to the Hill to play cards or to play tiddlywinks with one another. Investigating
[04:05.940 --> 04:12.100]  the Russia probe for two years. I mean, what? And then they have the news that says, oh, well,
[04:12.100 --> 04:18.580]  it was Hillary that invented the Russia meddling thing. But it was, they knew that they were
[04:18.580 --> 04:25.620]  going to lose this election. Okay, trust me. Alex Jones and Infowars and the people on the alt
[04:25.620 --> 04:30.100]  right weren't the only people that knew Hillary was going to lose, folks. They knew she was done.
[04:30.100 --> 04:34.500]  They knew Hillary Clinton was doomed. That's why the fake news was so strong against Trump.
[04:35.060 --> 04:38.900]  That's why they tried to steal the election. That's why they had to use superdelegates to
[04:38.900 --> 04:44.740]  keep Bernie out. Because Hillary never had a chance. The only chance she had was the fake news
[04:44.740 --> 04:49.700]  and it failed her. We'll be right back. Alex Jones show on Troy filling in Alex Jones on the other side.
[05:01.220 --> 05:09.140]  Fox News has a new television host and she wants you to stop spreading conspiracy theories
[05:09.140 --> 05:15.300]  about Seth Rich. Let the rich family get the closure that they need properly and not with
[05:15.300 --> 05:20.740]  your crazy conspiracy theories on the Internet. Save them for Bigfoot. In the post Roger Ailes
[05:20.740 --> 05:28.420]  era of the Fox News Network, liberal Democrat host Julie Roginski went after Seth Rich conspiracy
[05:28.420 --> 05:32.900]  theories. Listen, WikiLeaks was in collaboration with the Russians. How do we know this? Because
[05:32.900 --> 05:37.060]  the entire intelligence community said that the Russians were the ones that hacked into these
[05:37.060 --> 05:43.700]  emails. Meanwhile, evidence continues to surface that Seth Rich did in fact have contact with
[05:43.700 --> 05:50.500]  WikiLeaks before he was murdered. Seth Rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and
[05:50.500 --> 05:56.340]  suicide victims with close ties to the Clinton crime family. I'm Darren McBreen and you can
[05:56.340 --> 06:02.980]  learn more right now at Infowars.com. We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it
[06:02.980 --> 06:08.740]  together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave
[06:08.740 --> 06:13.460]  us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield. Toxic
[06:13.460 --> 06:19.540]  metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from
[06:19.540 --> 06:24.100]  nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infomer.
[06:24.100 --> 06:29.860]  It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[06:29.860 --> 06:34.980]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you
[06:34.980 --> 06:39.620]  can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of
[06:39.620 --> 06:45.220]  this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can
[06:45.220 --> 06:50.900]  be because we need you the remnant of America to reignite those brush fires the next level and to
[06:50.900 --> 06:55.140]  be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and your prayers together we're
[06:55.140 --> 07:00.020]  changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and FullWarsLife.com.
[07:00.020 --> 07:06.420]  Emdix Essentials. That's my middle name. I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big
[07:06.420 --> 07:12.580]  national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care
[07:12.580 --> 07:18.820]  products that's organic and high quality. This is one of the top three selling organic brands
[07:18.820 --> 07:24.020]  in the country that puts out high quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it and
[07:24.020 --> 07:28.740]  they're such patriots they have led us basically keep their well-known packaging. It is an answer
[07:28.740 --> 07:33.140]  to prayer and because we're cutting out the middleman 20% off retail, sign a ferrato ship,
[07:33.140 --> 07:40.020]  an additional 25% off. It's all there. The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash,
[07:40.020 --> 07:44.900]  all of it is truly game-changing. It is the exact same product just the name is different.
[07:44.900 --> 07:50.740]  Emdix Essentials and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores buying it directly
[07:50.740 --> 07:55.220]  from infowarstore.com. Help us win the info war while getting products everybody needs.
[07:55.220 --> 07:59.460]  infowarslife.com where you'll find the entire line of Emdix Essentials.
[08:08.820 --> 08:18.580]  Live from the infowars.com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Owen
[08:18.580 --> 08:31.940]  Troyer. The people of the United States, the people of the UK, the people of Europe and the world
[08:31.940 --> 08:35.300]  have a decision to make. Are we going to roll over to Islamic intimidation?
[08:35.940 --> 08:40.660]  Are we going to roll over to their censorship? Are we going to roll over to the past president
[08:40.660 --> 08:44.900]  that just left office saying don't use the word Islamic extremism or Islamic terror?
[08:44.900 --> 08:51.620]  We have been censored on our main Facebook page and also on Paul's page that have millions
[08:51.620 --> 08:58.820]  and millions of likes because Paul posted a article about how he's given all these death threats
[08:58.820 --> 09:03.140]  by Islamists and Facebook won't take it down. They won't take down the pages with hundreds of
[09:03.140 --> 09:08.020]  thousands of likes saying kill Donald Trump. They'll only censor libertarians and conservatives
[09:08.020 --> 09:13.620]  and nationalists because we're telling the truth and our messages are strong but we won't be censored
[09:13.620 --> 09:17.940]  by you. We won't be shut down by you and then today they locked out our Facebook account so we're
[09:17.940 --> 09:23.540]  not doing Facebook mentions because that's been taken from us because we violated community
[09:23.540 --> 09:28.900]  guidelines pointing out that the leftists are saying just carry on have a stiff upper lip
[09:29.620 --> 09:34.900]  go have peace vigils with the Muslims as if that's going to stop the Islamic attacks when it's the
[09:34.900 --> 09:39.540]  governments themselves and the left that brought in these people and let them carry out the attacks
[09:39.540 --> 09:45.220]  and then cover up for them every single time. The people are sick of this and they're tired of it
[09:45.220 --> 09:49.060]  but let me tell you something I'm a lot more mad at the globalist and the social engineers and the
[09:49.060 --> 09:56.260]  UN population system the whole UN refugee program than I am at the Islamist. The globalists go to
[09:56.260 --> 10:01.380]  stabilize the Muslim countries they destroy their borders they then open up Europe they have the
[10:01.380 --> 10:07.940]  these people flood into their countries and then they're basically prepped by leftist to then go
[10:07.940 --> 10:12.580]  out and carry out their jihad to intimidate the general population into giving up their rights
[10:12.580 --> 10:18.260]  to the central government police state to protect them that's all this is the real enemies here are
[10:18.260 --> 10:23.620]  the globalist social engineers that have been protecting radical orthodox Islam and turning
[10:23.620 --> 10:29.140]  it loose all over Africa all over Asia all over the Middle East all over central Asia to wreak
[10:29.140 --> 10:35.460]  havoc against non-radical Muslim countries like Iraq and like Syria and like Libya and like Egypt
[10:35.460 --> 10:40.740]  it goes on and on and it's disgusting to see they've written books bragging how they use
[10:40.740 --> 10:46.820]  Islam as the sword of globalism and how they're supposed to come here and colonize us millions
[10:46.820 --> 10:53.700]  and millions of military-age men and our western men are taught to be cooked and passive and roll
[10:53.700 --> 10:58.340]  over but the Muslim men can just run around and beat up and attack and rape and kill and the liberals
[10:58.340 --> 11:04.420]  go give them roses when they do it and Stockholm and in Berlin and they have anti-racism pro-Islam
[11:04.420 --> 11:09.140]  uh rock concerts and the Muslim men just line up and just rape the women as they beg the police
[11:09.140 --> 11:14.820]  for help for hours on video and no one helps them because it's a sacrament to give into Islam
[11:14.820 --> 11:19.540]  it's a sacrament per British town in some cases thousands of little girls grabbed and put into
[11:19.540 --> 11:26.900]  sex slavery who disappear who some cases are found dug up dead but it's all kept quiet because uh uh
[11:26.900 --> 11:30.980]  it's Muslims and it's brown people and they can't do anything wrong that's what this has become
[11:30.980 --> 11:37.460]  and then Katy Perry comes out of her rat hole and says no borders no division we will all come
[11:37.460 --> 11:41.700]  together when she has bodyguards and she's all protected and these rich white liberals live in
[11:41.700 --> 11:48.020]  the most segregated white areas in the world they are conquering everyone with their Islamic sword
[11:49.060 --> 11:53.140]  morelessly a big liberal but a classic liberal came out and said how dare you all you live behind
[11:53.140 --> 11:58.020]  armed guards just they have some vigil and you know move forward and put smiley face avatars up
[11:58.020 --> 12:04.180]  or put your British flags up union jacks no that's all just a sav by the very political elite that
[12:04.180 --> 12:08.340]  brought these people in knowing they come from third world hell holes where all they do is kill
[12:08.340 --> 12:13.780]  each other they're incompatible in their own damn religion so ladies and gentlemen on this
[12:13.780 --> 12:17.300]  Wednesday understand this they think you're broken they think you're defeated they think they can
[12:17.300 --> 12:23.780]  bring in millions of military age men have them rape kill bomb do whatever they want see our president
[12:23.780 --> 12:28.340]  go to the heart of Islam and say no more Islamic terror we're throwing down the gauntlet they bomb
[12:28.340 --> 12:33.940]  the next day showing just how absolutely arrogant they are and how they believe the whole world's
[12:33.940 --> 12:40.020]  theirs because we act like such cupped cowards because we act like such pathetic people that
[12:40.020 --> 12:44.420]  will roll over to the so-called religion of peace that is the religion of oppressing women
[12:44.420 --> 12:48.980]  and the religion of absolutely trafficking in slaves they invented the African slave trade
[12:48.980 --> 12:53.140]  and then taught westers how to do it so they teach in schools that the west did it when the west
[12:53.140 --> 12:59.700]  ended it everything is a giant inverted stinking fraud and i for one have had enough of it and i
[12:59.700 --> 13:06.340]  look at uh the grande lady who where this event happened calling for open borders saying trump
[13:06.340 --> 13:12.660]  satirist saying he terrifies her and then she's not saying a word against ices or islam right now
[13:12.660 --> 13:17.540]  but they just blew up 22 of her fans and killed them with their guts and skin blown everywhere
[13:17.540 --> 13:21.380]  oh but if i say that i'll be banned off youtube you can't even talk about the victim's death
[13:21.380 --> 13:25.620]  and their blood they want to show us people that have been nerve gassed to start a syrian war
[13:25.620 --> 13:30.180]  gulping for air that's okay up close but i just say they blow up these little girls and humanize
[13:30.180 --> 13:34.820]  them we'll be banned probably already off facebook because you see you don't humanize it the other
[13:34.820 --> 13:41.060]  thing we got blocked on facebook for our accounts frozen for videos live feeds is that we did
[13:41.060 --> 13:46.020]  humanize them instead the little girls were blown into pieces and that that won't bring them back
[13:46.020 --> 13:51.140]  saying let's carry on stiff upper lip no let's stand up against the radical islam let's stand
[13:51.140 --> 13:55.060]  up to the open borders let's stand up to the EU saying you'll let these people in or we'll find
[13:55.060 --> 14:01.220]  you a hundred thousand pounds per person you don't let in think about that think about that think
[14:01.220 --> 14:06.020]  about how crazy they are think about how arrogant they are think about the mayor who said just get
[14:06.020 --> 14:12.740]  used to terrorism last year in london the london stand new mayor of the islamist he said he's proud
[14:12.740 --> 14:17.940]  of islam and it's spread he's not an uncle tom he's here to let islam take over he hasn't repudiated
[14:17.940 --> 14:23.060]  isis or al qaeda or any of it he has it because you know what he's the big politico that uses the
[14:23.060 --> 14:27.380]  terror to get more of your freedoms and more of your rights and more surveillance in fact they've
[14:27.380 --> 14:31.540]  got the british police everywhere cracking down on folks that even mildly criticize islam or say
[14:31.540 --> 14:36.580]  it's time to stand up against it because we're all being basically turned into slaves and islam's
[14:36.580 --> 14:41.140]  being used as the weapon to put us into slavery and we're not putting up with anymore and we see
[14:41.140 --> 14:47.540]  through the globalist operation it is so incredible to see their arrogance and to see even after
[14:47.540 --> 14:53.940]  that her fans were blown up 50 plus injured 22 dead that she won't even sit there and repudiated
[14:53.940 --> 14:59.460]  islam it's more attacking the west say we didn't surrender to islam enough we didn't cut off enough
[14:59.460 --> 15:03.860]  women's genitals we didn't put enough hoods over women's heads we didn't we didn't sit there and
[15:03.860 --> 15:08.660]  throw enough gay people off buildings seriously that's the cuckold stockholm syndrome we didn't
[15:08.660 --> 15:14.100]  go to enough islamic you know rock concerts would be raped to prove you know that swedish women are
[15:14.100 --> 15:20.260]  sorry for being white we didn't do enough and so we're so sorry to george soros who runs the un
[15:21.300 --> 15:26.100]  migrant council program with all these different globalist organizations and who literally has
[15:26.100 --> 15:31.220]  taxis out in north africa from libya bringing the jihadis over the thousands every day i mean you
[15:31.220 --> 15:38.020]  cannot make this level of crap up but then moracy comes out and tells the truth so this is about
[15:38.020 --> 15:40.980]  survival do you have any survival instinct left let's look at some of these articles
[15:40.980 --> 15:47.700]  here it is facebook punished me for complaining about the death threat that's the one thing that
[15:47.700 --> 15:51.140]  poll has been blocked out of his account for you can also scroll down here and see the other thing
[15:51.140 --> 15:55.140]  about the girls being killed or we just mentioned they were killed and saying you know all your

[15:59.460 --> 16:07.540]  say it you see continuing here we've got the fact that the muslim terrorists kill innocent young
[16:07.540 --> 16:13.860]  beautiful girls but that's okay white house blames exhaustion for donald trump's islamic
[16:13.860 --> 16:18.900]  terrorism dog whistle because he wasn't supposed to say that but he did say it's islamic terror
[16:18.900 --> 16:24.580]  so the media had both they said oh he was tired when he said it but also he never said it oh he
[16:24.580 --> 16:31.700]  backed off in saudi arabia see again that's their total double-feaked mind control remember the
[16:31.700 --> 16:37.460]  san bernadino attack they don't call it islamic terror attack they just call it an attack they
[16:37.460 --> 16:41.380]  wouldn't shot people around the christmas tree ask if they were jewish and shot them
[16:41.380 --> 16:46.420]  niece attack what we know about the best deal date killings oh not an islamic attack huh

[17:15.620 --> 17:20.820]  you're never going to be able to shut us down and look at this katie barrier all our bodyguards and
[17:20.820 --> 17:27.300]  all the rest of it says no barriers no borders we all just need to coexist hey katie can you go to
[17:27.300 --> 17:32.260]  saudi arabia and walk around in your egyptian outfit no you'll be put in the slave pit katie
[17:32.260 --> 17:36.980]  can you walk around kissing girls in saudi arabia no you'll be executed can your gay dancers go
[17:36.980 --> 17:40.580]  around in saudi arabia no they'll be thrown off cliffs they'll be thrown off the top of buildings
[17:40.580 --> 17:45.140]  hey katie can you go to syria and live in peace can you go to libya and live in peace no because
[17:45.140 --> 17:49.860]  our government wouldn't put radical muslims in to sell women into slavery and murder hundreds of
[17:49.860 --> 17:54.020]  thousands of christians but that's okay because you shoot your mouth off about no barriers when you've
[17:54.020 --> 17:58.500]  got a big wall around your mansion and you've got at least seven or eight bodyguards i've seen you
[17:58.500 --> 18:02.580]  out in austin before who pack guns but of course you don't support the second amendment either
[18:02.580 --> 18:10.820]  only for your big fat pathetic satanic ass you're sick and you're a cuck to anything that you see
[18:10.820 --> 18:16.260]  as criminal and alpha alpha is a criminal alpha is strong and stands for what's right and goes
[18:16.260 --> 18:21.060]  against the peer pressure and i will not submit to the peer pressure of orthodox islam or the left
[18:21.060 --> 18:25.620]  and it's a death cult that hates the west and hates real christianity and hates prosperity and hates
[18:25.620 --> 18:31.220]  open free societies this whole embrace of islam and hajib signs all over austin saying where you're
[18:31.220 --> 18:37.220]  hajib at gap and everywhere else is about an assault on free societies and free will and it's an
[18:37.220 --> 18:43.940]  assault on everything that's held true in the renaissance and we will never submit to islam
[18:43.940 --> 18:49.060]  islam means submission we will never submit to the god of death we will never submit to the god of
[18:49.060 --> 18:54.660]  suppressing women we will never submit to george soros and his nazi loving satanic death cult either
[18:54.660 --> 19:00.500]  all of you are going to the ash heap of history we're going to have a reformation in islam some
[19:00.500 --> 19:04.740]  say al qaeda and i says this is reformation well then if that's his reformation i'll tell you what

[23:57.620 --> 24:14.980]  so i think donald trump said it best when he was campaigning when he was talking about
[24:14.980 --> 24:18.980]  radical islam terrorist attacks everything that's going on in the middle east and that
[24:19.860 --> 24:24.020]  is when he asked we need or when he said we need to figure out what the hell is going on
[24:24.020 --> 24:30.100]  on yeah we need to figure out what the hell is going on just saying tolerance and changing
[24:30.100 --> 24:36.900]  your avatar is not going to do anything so i'm going to try to put my understanding of what is
[24:36.900 --> 24:43.940]  going on and we'll hear from callers later on in the show i'm sure we'll hear from alex on this too
[24:43.940 --> 24:52.260]  so what you have is you've got the middle east which is rich in resources but people that seem
[24:52.260 --> 25:00.100]  to be in conflict all the time so what you have is governments in europe and in the western world
[25:00.100 --> 25:06.980]  want to impose regime change so that perhaps private i don't know oil companies or central banks
[25:06.980 --> 25:13.620]  can come into these countries establish their way and establish the western way of life and when
[25:13.620 --> 25:21.460]  it doesn't go the way we like well we have bombs being dropped or we have to stage events like 9 11
[25:21.460 --> 25:26.420]  or we have to lie about what happens on 9 11 in order to move into the middle east
[25:26.420 --> 25:31.220]  and get these agendas going so then what happens you have ticked off people in the middle east
[25:31.220 --> 25:35.700]  because we're trying to come in and then we have people that hate us already so they're preaching
[25:35.700 --> 25:39.380]  to their youth how bad we are and they're preaching hate against the western world hate against the
[25:39.380 --> 25:46.820]  european world so then liberal morons open up their borders to these very people and then they
[25:46.820 --> 25:53.460]  come into their countries and they inflict violence they inflict death and they bring pain and suffering
[25:53.460 --> 26:02.820]  to these nations so that's what's going on as far as my understanding and it's ridiculous
[26:03.700 --> 26:08.180]  that you can't see it's like it's like the same debate it's like having a debate about global
[26:08.180 --> 26:12.660]  warming but not mentioning that geoengineering is going on we're going to sit here and debate
[26:12.660 --> 26:19.380]  global warming anthropogenic global warming oh yes but we're going to actually ignore the literal
[26:19.380 --> 26:24.420]  anthropogenic global warming that's going on spraying chemicals in the air we're going to ignore
[26:24.420 --> 26:30.980]  all that but we're going to talk about how humans are warming the planet it's like okay you know
[26:30.980 --> 26:34.580]  we're going to talk about all these different things oh there's terrorist attacks here there's
[26:34.580 --> 26:39.300]  terrorist attacks here we're invading here we're infiltrating regime changes here well it's all
[26:39.300 --> 26:43.620]  connected and donald trump said it what the hell is going on we need to figure out what the hell is
[26:43.620 --> 26:48.260]  going on but for the safety of your country at this point you want to close the borders
[26:48.260 --> 26:54.100]  they're calling it an invasion of europe that is correct we are at war right now whether you like
[26:54.100 --> 26:57.940]  it or not whether they're going to say that or not there is a civil war going on right now in
[26:57.940 --> 27:04.980]  washington dc and there is cold war hot wars going on for regime change against terrorism
[27:04.980 --> 27:08.820]  which is a nice thing that they can call it so that they can keep these wars going on so there's
[27:08.820 --> 27:13.540]  all these different angles of course there's radical extreme islam you know of course what's
[27:13.540 --> 27:18.820]  going on in the middle east in some regimes is inhumane and we shouldn't tolerate that on the
[27:18.820 --> 27:23.380]  other hand you can't let these people into your country because we're bombing them
[27:24.820 --> 27:31.220]  donald trump signs a travel ban from several seven countries that were bombed for eight years under
[27:31.220 --> 27:40.020]  the obama regime yes that would make sense wouldn't it so it's time to figure out what's going on
[27:40.020 --> 27:45.140]  but when these people keep flooding into europe flooding into america it just makes the situation
[27:45.140 --> 27:55.540]  worse and as alex said you ruin the society you bring the culture to ruins and then you have people
[27:55.540 --> 28:00.820]  begging for the police state because they just want to feel safe if they can leave their house
[28:00.820 --> 28:06.180]  which look at the news so here's all the news i don't even get to it a man gets arrested there's
[28:06.180 --> 28:16.020]  a knife man who gets arrested as the queen is going down the road the armed guards in in england
[28:16.020 --> 28:21.700]  had to arrest him and so now there's security everywhere and manchester bombing trigger security
[28:21.700 --> 28:25.380]  crackdown with soldiers scrambled the patrol west minster as they joined armed cops in
[28:25.380 --> 28:30.740]  raised to foil imminent second attack so that's nice another attack that would have killed a bunch
[28:30.740 --> 28:37.620]  of young people the police have now said it's clear we're investigating a network and so now
[28:37.620 --> 28:41.700]  they're raiding homes they're making arrests they've got all these leads it looks like maybe
[28:41.700 --> 28:46.900]  they're finally doing something maybe the bombing at the ariana grande concert was finally the last
[28:46.900 --> 28:52.340]  draw oh yeah and so by the way and then you and then you see this it's just it's so ridiculous it's
[28:52.340 --> 29:02.500]  so messed up these refugees are going into europe they're getting taxpayer funded um stipends and
[29:02.500 --> 29:09.060]  then they go on vacation back to the countries that they fled you've never heard of such a
[29:09.060 --> 29:15.700]  crazy thing so again this policy is just ridiculous this open border policy is just ridiculous and
[29:15.700 --> 29:20.740]  it doesn't stop there but that's one issue that needs to be addressed so now in france
[29:20.740 --> 29:27.380]  they have now heightened their state of emergency with the very high threat france said to extend
[29:27.380 --> 29:33.300]  state of emergency and now here in america a false alarm at a baseball game in atlanta
[29:34.500 --> 29:41.060]  so everybody's on edge now everybody's worried and i'm just curious when will hollywood change
[29:41.060 --> 29:46.500]  its stance if people stop going to movies stop going to concerts stop going to ballgames maybe
[29:46.500 --> 29:49.700]  hollywood in the establishment will change their stance when people are afraid although they'll
[29:49.700 --> 29:54.020]  just bring in the police state you'll beg for it we'll be right back on the other side alex jones
[29:54.020 --> 30:07.380]  and the gcn radio network box news has a new television host and she wants you to stop spreading
[30:07.380 --> 30:14.740]  conspiracy theories about seph rich let the rich family get the closure that they need properly
[30:14.740 --> 30:19.860]  and not with your crazy conspiracy theories on the internet save them for bigfoot in the post
[30:19.860 --> 30:27.460]  roger ailes era of the fox news network liberal democrat host julie roginski went after seph rich
[30:27.460 --> 30:32.500]  conspiracy theories listen wiki leaks was in collaboration with the russians how do we know
[30:32.500 --> 30:36.580]  this because the entire intelligence community said that the russians were the ones that hacked
[30:36.580 --> 30:43.460]  into these emails meanwhile evidence continues to surface that seph rich did in fact have contact
[30:43.460 --> 30:50.500]  with wiki leaks before he was murdered seph rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and
[30:50.500 --> 30:56.580]  suicide victims with close ties to the clinton crime family i'm darin Mcbrane and you can learn

[33:11.220 --> 33:31.700]  transmission you are the resistance and now your host Owen shroyer
[33:31.700 --> 33:40.420]  in america's 240 plus year history we have seen veterans from the first battles at leisington
[33:40.420 --> 33:48.580]  and concord right through to our military trying to take out ices today fight their hearts out and
[33:48.580 --> 33:54.100]  in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice and that's what memorial day is really all about
[33:54.100 --> 33:59.700]  is remembering the service men and women that have given their lives and service this country
[34:00.340 --> 34:06.100]  and i'll be honest with you i was brought up supporting our military and supporting the troops
[34:06.100 --> 34:12.020]  but here in how great america was and how wonderful texas was and how we were the best
[34:12.580 --> 34:19.220]  growing up i kind of saw that as a little bit arrogant until i traveled the world
[34:19.780 --> 34:24.980]  and until i studied the news around the world and found out that as bad as america is in some
[34:24.980 --> 34:32.180]  cases we are so much better than places like north korea and venezuela and what the russians were
[34:32.180 --> 34:37.300]  under in the soviet union and so many other case point examples there are few countries
[34:38.180 --> 34:44.500]  that are as good as the united states of america and there are certainly none that are as diverse
[34:44.500 --> 34:49.460]  and vibrant in their histories that's why people from all over the world wanted to come here
[34:50.180 --> 34:56.100]  because this is a place where no matter what color you are or what your family background was
[34:56.100 --> 34:59.860]  or whether you were rich or poor you could really do true independent things
[34:59.860 --> 35:07.140]  at a level never before seen and full wars is the classic americana story 22 years old
[35:08.260 --> 35:13.300]  this organization that i started when i was 21 has really changed the course of history
[35:13.300 --> 35:18.580]  not because of what i did but because of what you the listeners and viewers did i was simply
[35:18.580 --> 35:24.260]  bringing back classic americana and challenging the controlled left and the globalists and the
[35:24.260 --> 35:29.940]  controlled right who are trying to bring in this whole corporate system of serving the establishment
[35:30.660 --> 35:36.020]  and not having true diversity of thoughts and ideas and we see political correctness assaulting
[35:36.020 --> 35:42.500]  our institutions assaulting our free speech and that's why as we approach memorial day it's more
[35:42.500 --> 35:50.100]  important than ever in 2017 to realize we're in the middle of a giant historical power struggle
[35:50.100 --> 35:56.500]  because we grew out of the tectonic forces of liberty and tyranny colliding and the great mountain
[35:57.620 --> 36:03.460]  that is our republic that was far above all the other nation states and peoples of the world
[36:03.460 --> 36:12.100]  with invention and low taxes and a level playing field is now sinking into the sands of time
[36:12.100 --> 36:19.060]  into an ocean of oblivion into the quagmire of oligarchies and special interests and those
[36:19.060 --> 36:24.660]  oligarchs recognize something and info wars that threatens them and threatens them greatly
[36:25.300 --> 36:29.940]  and it's that we're bona fide we're legitimate we're real i'm not reading off a teleprompter
[36:30.500 --> 36:35.540]  i'm certainly not perfect i make mistakes but i believe in prosperity i believe in free market
[36:35.540 --> 36:42.020]  i believe in religious freedom i believe in jesus christ and so the globalists see that as competition
[36:42.020 --> 36:47.860]  because i'm a free man i'm an empowered man who wants to live out my own destiny and wants to see
[36:47.860 --> 36:53.940]  you live that out i don't feel bad when i see you being successful i feel empowered just like you
[36:53.940 --> 36:59.060]  do that as well the globalists they want winners and losers and they want to pick the winners and
[36:59.060 --> 37:05.300]  losers they don't want to non-zero some game and that's why in hundreds and hundreds of publications
[37:05.300 --> 37:11.060]  a day they put out outrageous lies about us or they cherry pick what i've said out of context
[37:11.060 --> 37:16.180]  to misrepresent what we're doing because if they can destroy the idea of info wars and of
[37:16.180 --> 37:23.700]  how it shows you're truly they can destroy the idea of any man or any woman being an independent
[37:23.700 --> 37:30.740]  individual and changing history ladies and gentlemen we have a sacred birthright as americans
[37:30.740 --> 37:36.420]  of a race color and creed to trail blaze in the future for future generations just as past
[37:36.420 --> 37:41.860]  generations did for us and that's why during this memorial day i want to thank the veterans that have
[37:41.860 --> 37:47.300]  fought but of course most importantly those that have died because that's what this holiday and
[37:47.300 --> 37:53.460]  remembrance is all about is those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building
[37:53.460 --> 37:58.100]  a better world didn't mean every war was good didn't mean they didn't get con didn't mean they
[37:58.100 --> 38:02.420]  didn't get used but i'm here to tell you they were at least people that were willing to stand up
[38:02.420 --> 38:08.420]  for something and that's worlds apart from so many of the trendies and globalist wannabes and
[38:08.420 --> 38:14.340]  minions of the establishment that want to take the easy road that easy road leads into stagnation
[38:14.980 --> 38:22.820]  leads into collapse leads into enslavement leads into humiliation and poverty and betrayal
[38:23.700 --> 38:29.700]  and as for me the greatest part about my quest to promote liberty and freedom is that i have met
[38:29.700 --> 38:36.340]  men and women again of every race color and creed who all bleed red blood and who were of one race
[38:36.340 --> 38:41.060]  the human race who have a dream to have a better future for our children just like martin Luther
[38:41.060 --> 38:47.380]  king talked about and that dream is closer than ever that's why the forces of evil are pushing
[38:47.380 --> 38:53.460]  their system of tyranny harder than we've ever seen and that's why as we approach this memorial day
[38:53.460 --> 38:59.140]  i want to thank all the info warriors out there that have made this broadcast possible and that's
[38:59.140 --> 39:04.980]  why i want to also have a promotion here to help funder operation in the face of these attacks
[39:04.980 --> 39:11.140]  that is one of the biggest sales in our history at infowarstore.com where you'll get great high
[39:11.140 --> 39:17.620]  quality game changing products that also help us continue in the face of the enemy onslaught
[39:17.620 --> 39:22.980]  that again is attempting to shut down our free speech and ultimately your free speech take advantage
[39:22.980 --> 39:27.460]  of these unprecedented specials and help support the tip of the spear in the fight against the
[39:27.460 --> 39:35.060]  globalist while supplies last our highest quality name brand silver bullet that we private label

[40:29.460 --> 40:34.980]  it's the best seller it's been sold out why am i discounting it because i know it's a tough economy
[40:34.980 --> 40:39.060]  out there i know the globalists have been trying to stop the trump recovery and i know this is a
[40:39.060 --> 40:44.500]  powerful product and so if you try it i think you're going to continue to want to buy it especially
[40:44.500 --> 40:52.100]  if you sign up for auto ship that's an additional 10 percent off when you add that in to 65 percent
[40:52.100 --> 40:57.060]  off silver bullet it is a loss leader then for sure you add that to the 30 percent off super

[41:40.500 --> 41:45.860]  continually support us that's what this is all about is building our own economy having our own
[41:45.860 --> 41:51.220]  communities funding the good guys that's why the globalists don't want free market that's why they
[41:51.220 --> 41:56.900]  want insider deals that's why they want to shut in full wars down because they can't compete with a
[41:56.900 --> 42:02.820]  level playing field now obviously those that made the ultimate physical sacrifice are way above
[42:02.820 --> 42:07.780]  those of us that just make the sacrifice in our families and our daily lives and with our names
[42:07.780 --> 42:12.660]  to take on the globalists but make no mistake it is a war and so i want to commend all of you that
[42:12.660 --> 42:16.340]  have spread the word about info wars and that have stood up for the broadcast and that have prayed
[42:16.340 --> 42:21.140]  for us because i know you get attacked as well and i want to thank you for purchasing the products
[42:22.100 --> 42:27.460]  and for continually supporting us those of you who've been with us sometimes for more than 20 years
[42:27.460 --> 42:32.100]  just understand that without you there'd be nothing so when i thank you for your support it's not
[42:32.100 --> 42:37.060]  because i'm patronizing you it's because you are the info war and you're the reason we've had the
[42:37.060 --> 42:43.140]  success we've had so without you there's nothing so for myself the entire info wars crew i salute
[42:43.140 --> 42:48.660]  you and thank you for all your prayers and all your support on this memorial day hope everybody
[42:48.660 --> 42:56.420]  has a safe weekend coming up and i hope and pray all of you work as hard as you can to wake up as
[42:56.420 --> 43:00.900]  many people as you can because if you don't engage in the info war and take it to the next level if i
[43:00.900 --> 43:06.340]  don't as well we're gonna lose this thing it's that close we're on the knife's edge right now
[43:06.340 --> 43:16.820]  we are in that crucible we are in that fulcrum we are at that crossroads
[43:16.820 --> 43:18.820]  so
[43:30.420 --> 43:35.620]  take advantage of those specials at infowarstore.com folks some of the best specials we've ever offered
[43:35.620 --> 43:41.940]  in honor of memorial day and those who have served this country died for this country died
[43:41.940 --> 43:46.740]  for the freedoms that we have in this country that people at berkeley university are willing
[43:46.740 --> 43:54.980]  to throw in the trash what a bunch of scum hey shocking bbc news told members of the public
[43:55.780 --> 44:02.500]  called the anti-terrorism hotline warning about the manchester bomber several years ago
[44:02.500 --> 44:11.460]  so how do you like that shocking shocking oh wait he was known to law enforcement shocking
[44:12.980 --> 44:21.860]  oh wait he traveled to libya before shocking there's no pattern of events here at all
[44:22.420 --> 44:28.740]  no no no no no no no pattern of events here but you know what cnn decided that they were
[44:28.740 --> 44:36.820]  going to go ahead and go full mental and they blamed the alt right or the right wing on uh for
[44:36.820 --> 44:50.420]  this attack at the concert guys go ahead and roll this clip all right so we're still going to go
[44:50.420 --> 44:58.100]  ahead and wait on that clip then so we'll just go ahead and move forward then so we've got now the
[44:58.100 --> 45:04.900]  seth rich thing is taking on entirely new levels folks it's reached uh new proportions on fox news
[45:04.900 --> 45:11.380]  new proportions on the internet uh kim dot com making statements now and you have the left
[45:11.940 --> 45:16.820]  which is still busy looking for russian collusion up each other's butts they're just ignoring it
[45:16.820 --> 45:21.220]  they're saying it's fake news even though there's more evidence that it was seth rich whether it was
[45:21.220 --> 45:25.700]  or not there is more evidence that would lead you to believe it seth rich then there are to
[45:25.700 --> 45:31.460]  lead you to believe that it was russia but as i said this is taking uh new levels so
[45:32.980 --> 45:39.620]  family of d dnc staffer seth rich he's more than just a dnc staffer by the way i hate um how they
[45:39.620 --> 45:45.540]  just say dnc staffer and he's more than just dnc staffer he was in charge of uh voter rolls
[45:45.540 --> 45:53.060]  and voter reach out and he and he was in the tech he was into tech is very uh it savvy as well so
[45:54.740 --> 45:59.700]  the family is asking the dc police to reveal details of its murder investigation or the lack of
[46:00.900 --> 46:05.700]  and i think that this is a you know again we've seen the video of seth rich's parents on the
[46:05.700 --> 46:11.780]  internet we've heard about the private eye the retraction all of this craziness but perhaps maybe
[46:11.780 --> 46:18.180]  this is and i don't even know i i'm not in contact with seth rich's parents um i i just want to find
[46:18.180 --> 46:22.420]  out the truth about this i think that there's a deep deep corruption going on here and a whole
[46:22.420 --> 46:27.620]  list of body counts that they all may be tied together known as the clinton body count but
[46:27.620 --> 46:34.580]  apparently sean hannity who is talking to the rich family has said that he's going to back off of
[46:34.580 --> 46:39.700]  his reporting on it and his investigation uh because that's what the family has requested
[46:39.700 --> 46:46.260]  it again i i've not had that request or been in contact with the family um i certainly don't want
[46:46.260 --> 46:53.860]  to upset them but it is my understanding um that they want independent investigation going on on
[46:53.860 --> 46:58.020]  this because they're not getting what they want out of the dc police and that would lead me to
[46:58.020 --> 47:04.660]  believe why they make this announcement asking the dc police to reveal investigation uh details
[47:04.660 --> 47:11.380]  or the again the lack thereof uh but so it goes on to a new level now and sean hannity has gone
[47:11.380 --> 47:16.260]  onto twitter he said spoke to many advertisers they are being inundated with emails to stop
[47:16.260 --> 47:22.180]  advertising on my show this is soros clinton but brock liberal fascism yes sean hannity welcome
[47:22.180 --> 47:26.740]  to the club brother media matters is hoping advertisers will give into the pressure and
[47:26.740 --> 47:31.140]  they will silence freedom of speech liberals do you support this effort well yeah they do
[47:31.140 --> 47:38.740]  support sever because you support trump but this is something that i think is starting to reach
[47:40.900 --> 47:47.620]  more echelons than just info wars dot com and really starting to wake people up because there
[47:47.620 --> 47:52.820]  are true liberals still out there they may be tricked or brainwashed but they do still exist
[47:53.380 --> 47:57.220]  and when they see this attack on free speech no matter who it is
[47:57.220 --> 48:04.900]  is it does send up red flags so yeah info wars has been under attack by media matters
[48:05.460 --> 48:12.660]  and all these consortium of fake news collaborators saying we're fake news but now sean hannity
[48:12.660 --> 48:16.580]  is really getting the pressure upped on him why would that be going on
[48:18.500 --> 48:23.060]  couldn't be because of his seth rich reporting no no no couldn't have anything to do with that
[48:23.060 --> 48:30.420]  i'm sure that that has nothing to do with it at all hey by the way uh david brock you know i've
[48:30.420 --> 48:36.020]  actually interviewed andrew kerr before andrew kerr did a great uh investigative report on
[48:36.020 --> 48:41.860]  david brock and all of his packs this guy he is he is i mean seriously this guy is doing some shady
[48:41.860 --> 48:49.460]  stuff to be uh to be polite he's got all of his packs all of his super packs in dc all located
[48:49.460 --> 48:55.220]  in the same office all funneling money back and forth between one another while he takes a hit
[48:55.220 --> 48:59.940]  off of every money exchange so he and his super packs are taking a hit they're taking in the
[48:59.940 --> 49:04.500]  donations they're funneling them in between one another who's all located in the same office
[49:04.500 --> 49:09.620]  they're all making out like millionaires meanwhile they're trying to shut down real news because they
[49:09.620 --> 49:15.300]  want the fake news because the fake news isn't going to report on david brock super packs laundering money
[49:15.300 --> 49:25.460]  allegedly so now andrew kerr has put out another report on david brock is david brock's foundation
[49:25.460 --> 49:37.540]  falsifying expenditures shocking i would have never believed not david brock not david brock oh my
[49:37.540 --> 49:42.820]  gosh so you know what i'm actually gonna i'll actually reach out to andrew kerr i'll see if
[49:42.820 --> 49:46.660]  he uh can maybe come on and uh talk to me about this for the nightly news or something
[49:48.020 --> 49:55.300]  but now you see it again you report on set rich on hannity you report on perhaps some deep state
[49:55.300 --> 50:02.820]  things going down some election fraud going down and well what do you know you're attacked by david
[50:02.820 --> 50:08.820]  brock another pattern there's all these patterns forming why do people just ignore these patterns
[50:08.820 --> 50:13.140]  folks okay so we'll play this video you guys got the cnn clip ready before we go to break
[50:13.140 --> 50:20.180]  this is cnn blaming the right wing on the ariana grande concert bombing it's also be noted that in
[50:20.180 --> 50:26.420]  recent months uh in europe there've been a number of false flag uh plots where uh right wing extremists
[50:26.420 --> 50:33.780]  have tried to frame islamists uh for uh for terrorism we've seen that in germany inflamed the
[50:33.780 --> 50:39.940]  right wing is inflaming islamists if they want to come on and say they're being inflamed by
[50:39.940 --> 50:45.220]  fake wars and proxy wars and now more weapons going in the region okay maybe i can understand
[50:45.220 --> 50:50.180]  but to just blame the right wing well you're clearly out of your mind cnn we'll be right back

[1:00:23.540 --> 1:00:27.540]  welcome back to the alex jones show olyn shroyer sitting in for alex today
[1:00:28.420 --> 1:00:34.980]  he is on the road working hard as always we're about to be joined by dr group and we're going to
[1:00:34.980 --> 1:00:39.780]  cover some uh current events with dr group we're going to play some clips here and we're going to
[1:00:39.780 --> 1:00:44.500]  talk about health issues dr group has some health victories that he is seeing happening right now
[1:00:45.380 --> 1:00:51.780]  which is good for us to be getting healthier because i think that a lot of the problems that
[1:00:51.780 --> 1:00:57.620]  we're facing right now is due to poor health and i want to talk to dr group about how physical
[1:00:57.620 --> 1:01:03.860]  health can lead to mental health whether that be good or bad but just look at the current
[1:01:03.860 --> 1:01:10.260]  psychological madness that we are experiencing in this country with the stockholm syndrome
[1:01:11.220 --> 1:01:16.420]  just the confirmation bias the fake news propaganda look at look at what it is built and
[1:01:16.420 --> 1:01:21.540]  i've tried to i've tried to take all this down and look at this from a centrist point of view
[1:01:22.260 --> 1:01:29.860]  non-biased to just say hey look this is double think in the flesh this is psychological madness
[1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:36.420]  in the flesh no matter where you stand politically we should at least be able to logically reason that
[1:01:36.420 --> 1:01:42.820]  hey this is double think there's something wrong with these people's minds so for an example just
[1:01:42.820 --> 1:01:46.740]  just and this happens all the time i just wanted to put together this list to try to understand it
[1:01:46.740 --> 1:01:54.820]  here again we've got media we've got people we've got politicians crying russia russia russia russia
[1:01:54.820 --> 1:01:59.620]  collusion all this russia collusion investigation ongoing 17 intelligence agencies yet somehow
[1:01:59.620 --> 1:02:04.820]  they can't put any proof out there somehow they can't present any evidence yet whether it was set
[1:02:04.820 --> 1:02:10.820]  rich or not there's more evidence that it was set rich so imagine all the time spent by our
[1:02:10.820 --> 1:02:17.300]  government by the media by these people protesting all this time spent on fake news that is the russian
[1:02:17.300 --> 1:02:24.660]  collusion theory fake news started by the democrats to make an excuse for hillary clinton
[1:02:24.660 --> 1:02:32.980]  and to begin the delegitimization process delegitimization delegitimization process
[1:02:32.980 --> 1:02:39.140]  of president trump which they are continuing to ongoing so that's our tax dollars at work
[1:02:39.140 --> 1:02:45.380]  investigating fake news to discredit our president that we put in power now you also have a group
[1:02:45.380 --> 1:02:53.060]  of people that preach women's rights homosexual rights and overall tolerance yet they have allied
[1:02:53.060 --> 1:03:00.260]  with radical islam and sharia law or they will tell you that radical islam doesn't exist but
[1:03:00.260 --> 1:03:08.660]  they're upset if you say there's only two sexes again this is just this is just common sense logic
[1:03:08.660 --> 1:03:14.900]  that just somehow befuddles these people if you say that donald trump is a misogynist or i'm sorry
[1:03:14.900 --> 1:03:20.180]  they will this same group of people will say that donald trump is a misogynist yet they voted or
[1:03:20.180 --> 1:03:24.900]  would vote for hillary clinton who's married to bill clinton who settled multiple rape cases
[1:03:25.940 --> 1:03:33.060]  whose assistant huma abadine was married to anthony weiner who is guilty for sexting young
[1:03:33.060 --> 1:03:42.340]  teenagers but trump's the misogynist folks again this is mental madness and now this is something
[1:03:42.340 --> 1:03:49.540]  that i'm just now seeing and i am a news junkie a political news junkie i'm literally monitoring
[1:03:49.540 --> 1:03:54.580]  mainstream news like 24 7 even right now on my computer i've got three broadcasts up i've never
[1:03:54.580 --> 1:04:02.260]  seen this before in the over four years that i've been obsessed with covering this stuff cnn msnbc
[1:04:02.260 --> 1:04:09.140]  and the washington post have literally become a cyclical echo chamber it gets reported in the
[1:04:09.140 --> 1:04:15.060]  washington post then cnn and msnbc cover it it gets reported in new york times then cnn and msnbc
[1:04:15.060 --> 1:04:18.980]  cover it then the next day washington post has a twist on it then the next day the new york
[1:04:18.980 --> 1:04:23.060]  times has a twist on it which all of these are probably coming from leaks which i think trump
[1:04:23.060 --> 1:04:29.860]  is going to address when he comes back to dc so you've got this echo chamber of cnn msnbc
[1:04:29.860 --> 1:04:35.060]  fake news from the new york times in the washington post and they're fortifying their own madness
[1:04:35.060 --> 1:04:40.660]  they're fortifying their own fake news by reporting on it all day long and it doesn't matter that
[1:04:40.660 --> 1:04:46.580]  they're wrong almost all the time they still think that they're real and people still believe them
[1:04:46.580 --> 1:04:50.820]  because they report on each other's fake news so we're going to talk about this mental madness
[1:04:50.820 --> 1:04:54.340]  and what's leading to it with dr group on the other side of this break owen shroyer filling in for
[1:04:54.340 --> 1:05:06.900]  alex jones don't go anywhere box news has a new television host and she wants you to stop spreading

[1:08:18.740 --> 1:08:33.300]  jones welcome back to the alex jones show oh and shroyer and dr ed group with you and
[1:08:34.020 --> 1:08:40.260]  on the way out of the last break dr group i was explaining this what i view is genuine mental
[1:08:40.260 --> 1:08:45.380]  disorders i really think that there is something going on here where people are experiencing
[1:08:45.380 --> 1:08:50.260]  whether it be brainwashing or you know mindwashing whatever they want to say mind control
[1:08:50.260 --> 1:08:54.980]  it's very real it's very palpable and i think that there's a reason for it obviously there's
[1:08:54.980 --> 1:09:00.180]  a scyop going on with the fake news but dr group i think that there's more to it i think that there
[1:09:00.180 --> 1:09:04.580]  is chemicals that are being put in the food and the water whether it be intentional or not
[1:09:05.140 --> 1:09:10.180]  they are there and i think that this is also adding to some of the madness that these people
[1:09:10.180 --> 1:09:15.940]  are experiencing right now it definitely adds to the madness i mean if you look at the world the
[1:09:15.940 --> 1:09:23.700]  way it is right now you have look at all these terrorist attacks the the fear the political
[1:09:23.700 --> 1:09:30.260]  instability right now around the world i mean every single person that we talk to and you can look
[1:09:30.260 --> 1:09:36.020]  at the you can look on google look you can look at the psychiatric reports coming out you have the
[1:09:36.020 --> 1:09:41.220]  majority of the population which are suffering from mental illness yeah and then you have the
[1:09:41.220 --> 1:09:44.980]  majority of college students that are getting prescription pills that doesn't help either
[1:09:44.980 --> 1:09:50.260]  but you have babies being diagnosed and mothers being given medications for depression
[1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:54.580]  while they have babies in the womb right now i mean the whole goal is to get everybody on
[1:09:54.580 --> 1:09:59.540]  medications and even most medications believe it or not contain fluoride and fluoride is
[1:09:59.540 --> 1:10:04.180]  damaging to the pineal gland and you can link a lot of these mental disorders to
[1:10:04.180 --> 1:10:09.620]  you obviously what we've done and what we've been telling people about for years and years and years
[1:10:09.620 --> 1:10:15.060]  is the fluoride the phthalates the chemicals in the air that they're spraying from the chem
[1:10:15.060 --> 1:10:20.420]  trails the chemicals and toxins in the food supply the chemicals in the water supply the
[1:10:20.420 --> 1:10:25.620]  beverages that people are drinking the parasites it's all linked to mental illness look at all
[1:10:25.620 --> 1:10:30.900]  the studies that have come out lately on gut health and how gut health is linked to mental illness
[1:10:30.900 --> 1:10:38.340]  as well it's just is really sad when you see so much corruption and so much devastation that's
[1:10:38.340 --> 1:10:44.980]  happening in the world right now but the good news is we are accomplishing these victories these
[1:10:44.980 --> 1:10:51.700]  small victories that are taking place i just pulled up an article from cvs or an article in
[1:10:51.700 --> 1:10:58.260]  teen vogue actually and cvs announces removal of harmful chemicals from beauty products and
[1:10:58.260 --> 1:11:04.420]  we've been saying for a long time oh and it's we the people that are creating the change
[1:11:04.420 --> 1:11:10.500]  in america and around the world these days the retail chain will be removing all products
[1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:16.340]  containing harmful known toxins like parabens and phthalates as well as the most common for
[1:11:16.340 --> 1:11:23.700]  maldehyde contributors from their store-based beauty products this will go into effect in 2019
[1:11:23.700 --> 1:11:30.820]  over nearly 600 beauty products and according to cia tucci the vice president of store brands and
[1:11:30.820 --> 1:11:39.620]  quality assurance it all comes back to listening to the customer and what they truly want you know
[1:11:40.260 --> 1:11:46.340]  we've always been saying and alex has said for a long time too we are the ones that are making
[1:11:46.340 --> 1:11:55.940]  the difference we are the ones ones that are focusing on changing the world and we're the ones
[1:11:55.940 --> 1:12:01.860]  that are out there refusing to buy these products and it's amazing to me because you talk about
[1:12:02.580 --> 1:12:07.300]  this report how they're saying we're going to remove these known full harmful products and
[1:12:07.300 --> 1:12:11.940]  you're sitting here thinking that basically what all of these companies are saying now and you're
[1:12:11.940 --> 1:12:15.700]  seeing it in the food industry fast food market i was talking about how you're starting to see it
[1:12:15.700 --> 1:12:20.740]  in retail stores and you know these new marketing campaigns all natural removing this removing that
[1:12:20.740 --> 1:12:26.340]  basically these campaigns are saying hey we're not poisoning you anymore congratulations you've
[1:12:26.340 --> 1:12:31.220]  woken up to the poisoning we've decided not to poison you anymore and i think that that has a
[1:12:31.220 --> 1:12:35.300]  lot to do with some of the madness we're seeing here uh just with the psychological issues that
[1:12:35.300 --> 1:12:39.860]  people are dealing with in this country with the um with the double thing and you know one of them
[1:12:39.860 --> 1:12:44.980]  alex talked about this earlier we're going to play this video clip dr group so you have a terrorist
[1:12:44.980 --> 1:12:51.380]  attack in manchester england and i asked the question when will hollywood change their stance on
[1:12:51.380 --> 1:12:56.900]  open border and liberal policies will it be when there's more movie theater attacks or more concert
[1:12:56.900 --> 1:13:01.780]  attacks and people quit going to concert and movies uh or ball games will they stop it then
[1:13:01.780 --> 1:13:06.500]  well katie perry came out and perhaps answered that question right off the bat this was katie
[1:13:06.500 --> 1:13:12.180]  perry's response to the attack in manchester back to uh concerts of course uh the news from
[1:13:12.180 --> 1:13:18.020]  manchester from ariana grande's outside her concert last night uh you go through these phases of your
[1:13:18.020 --> 1:13:24.020]  you're in shock you're afraid and then you're mad and then you want to do something about it
[1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:27.860]  and the first thing i thought of this morning was i can't wait to go to a concert i just want
[1:13:27.860 --> 1:13:32.580]  to prove to the world that we need to get together and have festive get-togethers like your tour that
[1:13:32.580 --> 1:13:39.220]  you just announced what are your thoughts on that i you know i can't really uh tell anyone else how
[1:13:39.220 --> 1:13:45.460]  they should feel but i just feel devastated yeah yeah yeah and so you should we all should
[1:13:45.460 --> 1:13:51.780]  it's a sad thing uh people getting together for is what is supposed to be the elevating
[1:13:52.660 --> 1:13:58.900]  show and you know what they will continue but the thing of it is like you know besides like all the
[1:14:00.020 --> 1:14:06.020]  weird stuff that goes around on the internet which is you know sometimes a great place but an absolute
[1:14:06.020 --> 1:14:13.700]  you know underbelly mob pit of horribleness right oh i think like the greatest thing that we can do
[1:14:13.700 --> 1:14:21.940]  now is just unite as people as like fan bases all of it you know because i think like they're like as
[1:14:21.940 --> 1:14:28.900]  much you know what i got news for you katie perry isis isn't in your fan base they're not in ariana
[1:14:28.900 --> 1:14:35.060]  grande's fan base they want to blow that fan base up i think that the greatest thing we can do is just
[1:14:35.060 --> 1:14:40.740]  unite and love on each other and like no barriers no borders like no barriers no borders we all need
[1:14:40.740 --> 1:14:47.620]  to just coexist coexist you know what dr group i think i'm going to go coexist with some poisonous
[1:14:47.620 --> 1:14:52.420]  rattlesnakes in a cage for an hour i'm just i'm going to bring in my heart with love i'll be fine
[1:14:52.420 --> 1:15:00.180]  right yeah you'll probably die i mean uh yeah it's uh the breaking news obviously the manchester
[1:15:00.180 --> 1:15:05.300]  scenario so what do you think is going to what do you think that the main well here's what i'm
[1:15:05.300 --> 1:15:10.500]  noticing dr group and i think that this is universal i mean any any human being that has a soul left
[1:15:10.500 --> 1:15:15.300]  is heartbroken by this they're heartbroken by the images they're heartbroken by the fact that it's
[1:15:15.300 --> 1:15:19.940]  almost reached the point where we're numb to it now it happens there was a study that uh i think
[1:15:19.940 --> 1:15:24.980]  every nine days now in europe there's a terror related incident i mean that is all heartbreaking
[1:15:24.980 --> 1:15:31.140]  stuff everybody seems to be heartbroken but nobody wants to change anything nobody wants to address
[1:15:31.140 --> 1:15:37.940]  the root of the issue now the root of the issue probably goes way way way way deep you know deep
[1:15:37.940 --> 1:15:44.980]  deep decades decades old conflicts that have been going on here that are now being used by globalists
[1:15:44.980 --> 1:15:49.380]  to try to bring in unity of these countries and open borders and everything and eventually the
[1:15:49.380 --> 1:15:55.940]  police state but it's amazing because everyone's heartbroken everybody's upset but they don't ever
[1:15:55.940 --> 1:16:02.820]  mention the issue they just say oh love oh peace oh everything's fine no everything is obviously not
[1:16:02.820 --> 1:16:07.620]  fine that approach has not been working so i think there's a lot of issues here dr group but i think
[1:16:07.620 --> 1:16:15.060]  the first thing that you can do is say there is an issue if you can't even admit that there's an
[1:16:15.060 --> 1:16:21.060]  issue i mean they won't even say the words radical islamic terror whatever the cause of it is they
[1:16:21.060 --> 1:16:25.860]  won't even say that it exists so if you can't admit that there's a problem how are you ever going
[1:16:25.860 --> 1:16:29.780]  to address that there's a problem that's what i've been saying for a long time it's about addressing
[1:16:29.780 --> 1:16:34.820]  the root cause of the problem and when you look at the majority of the conflict that we're dealing
[1:16:34.820 --> 1:16:40.020]  with today first you have to ask yourself who created isis i mean and that's a whole another
[1:16:40.020 --> 1:16:45.780]  subject that we can go down but then what is the root cause of the problem and how to effectively
[1:16:45.780 --> 1:16:50.900]  fix the situation instead of continuing on and on and on i can remember when i was growing up
[1:16:52.020 --> 1:16:57.460]  you never heard about these things i mean now it's so commonplace that there's some terrorist
[1:16:57.460 --> 1:17:02.420]  attack or there's something going on practically every week that you just you know it's just a
[1:17:02.420 --> 1:17:06.180]  whole new segment for a week and then you just move on to the next terrorist attack and then
[1:17:06.180 --> 1:17:11.940]  you move on to the next terrorist attack and it's just especially if you don't confront the situation
[1:17:11.940 --> 1:17:20.660]  head on and you say okay these are radical islamic individuals that are hurting and maiming people and
[1:17:20.660 --> 1:17:26.980]  creating fear in society and you say oh you know the uk reports that come out and say oh this is
[1:17:26.980 --> 1:17:33.380]  just a soccer player or this is just an individual and they you know it's not politically correct
[1:17:33.380 --> 1:17:38.260]  to say anything or to blame anybody for anything or to look into any investigation or any warnings
[1:17:38.900 --> 1:17:43.460]  right or and you know i always wonder what happens to these guys that they that they so
[1:17:43.460 --> 1:17:47.620]  that are you know involved in all these suicide bombings and everything you never hear about
[1:17:47.620 --> 1:17:53.220]  what happens to them and and it's never followed up on after that it's a tragic event there's no
[1:17:53.220 --> 1:17:59.780]  doubt about it and to me i look at it as how is that going to affect the consciousness of the
[1:17:59.780 --> 1:18:07.940]  planet and how is that going to affect the health of individuals and it's just another big damaging
[1:18:08.660 --> 1:18:15.540]  thorn in society because what happens when you're stressed out about something your immune system
[1:18:15.540 --> 1:18:19.700]  drops 50 percent i mean now people are going to be scared to go outside their homes are we going to
[1:18:19.700 --> 1:18:23.780]  be living in a society later on where you feel like you can't even walk down the street because
[1:18:23.780 --> 1:18:29.300]  you have to watch out there might be a bomb going off and it's you know people don't understand what's
[1:18:29.300 --> 1:18:32.900]  going on in europe because they've never been there and of course for a lot of people in europe
[1:18:32.900 --> 1:18:38.500]  probably daily life goes on as normal but this is a slow progress this is slowly happening now in
[1:18:38.500 --> 1:18:43.940]  england you have armed guards protecting you know landmarks and such and you know i think what might
[1:18:43.940 --> 1:18:52.420]  be going on here doctor group is the political left is so deeply into this group think they're so
[1:18:52.420 --> 1:18:58.820]  deeply in the hive mindset that they can't go against radical islam because even in the threat
[1:18:58.820 --> 1:19:05.540]  of their consciousness hillary clinton and barack obama are so tied in with isis you know just in
[1:19:05.540 --> 1:19:11.300]  the threat of consciousness those two names clinton obama are so tied in with isis those two names
[1:19:11.300 --> 1:19:16.260]  just in the last eight to ten years are so tied in with regime change in the middle east that because
[1:19:16.260 --> 1:19:20.580]  these are the politicians they support they don't want to go against isis they don't want to call
[1:19:20.580 --> 1:19:25.700]  out radical islamic tear because a it's politically incorrect but b you know what maybe their leaders
[1:19:25.700 --> 1:19:29.460]  maybe their candidates might have something to do with it so they don't want to call them out
[1:19:29.460 --> 1:19:37.540]  yeah i mean i think that as things start to unfold you know and as the consciousness wakes up and
[1:19:37.540 --> 1:19:42.900]  more information is released to the public we've studied all the stuff for years and years years
[1:19:42.900 --> 1:19:47.540]  but obviously there's a big huge fight going on right now and i think that i'm hoping at least
[1:19:47.540 --> 1:19:53.300]  that the public will start to learn how deep this goes no i'm sorry i'm sorry we have to preempt this
[1:19:53.300 --> 1:19:57.780]  i need to look into a russia collusion there if they are trying to put in every office of every
[1:19:57.780 --> 1:20:00.740]  country in the whole world we're going to look into this on the other side opera now valid in all

[1:32:09.940 --> 1:32:15.860]  deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[1:32:15.860 --> 1:32:21.140]  and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the good halogen
[1:32:21.140 --> 1:32:26.660]  out and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening

[1:33:31.140 --> 1:33:35.940]  the great products the great memorial day special um let's get into some other news now real quick
[1:33:35.940 --> 1:33:39.540]  i just want to go back for a second on the seth rich thing because i'd like to hear your opinion now
[1:33:39.540 --> 1:33:50.660]  the biggest thing to me where we stand right now is that the fact that it's being dubbed fake news
[1:33:50.660 --> 1:33:54.900]  or conspiracy theory about seth rich is just absurd you have john pedestrian his own email
[1:33:54.900 --> 1:34:00.820]  saying whether it's a leaker or not we'll make an example of him you have kim dot com saying he
[1:34:00.820 --> 1:34:05.860]  knows that it was seth rich you have wiki leaks offering a reward for any information on seth rich
[1:34:05.860 --> 1:34:10.020]  you have it acclaimed robbery yet nothing was robbed you have the dc police which seem to be
[1:34:10.020 --> 1:34:14.180]  standing down in this investigation you have heather podesta who's involved with the police uh the dc
[1:34:14.180 --> 1:34:22.100]  police board um but with all of that they still want to say it was russia that was that was meddling
[1:34:22.100 --> 1:34:28.900]  but more importantly russia that leaked the dnc emails to wiki leaks so i'm just curious where
[1:34:28.900 --> 1:34:33.860]  do you think the evidence stands right now if you if you were a judge and you had to say
[1:34:33.860 --> 1:34:39.540]  based on the evidence that we've been presented who do you think gave the emails to wiki leaks seth
[1:34:39.540 --> 1:34:45.700]  rich or the russians or perhaps neither no i think there's just a huge cover up of what's
[1:34:45.700 --> 1:34:51.940]  currently going on in washington right now when you look at the podesta the wiki leaks the collusion
[1:34:51.940 --> 1:34:59.540]  with the russian story i mean all of the mainstream media is trying to cover up what i think they don't
[1:34:59.540 --> 1:35:07.860]  want people to find out and that's how deep the collusion between the governmental swamp has been
[1:35:07.860 --> 1:35:16.340]  for years and years and years and how many people are actually involved i mean you have evidence of
[1:35:16.340 --> 1:35:22.820]  the clinton family and all of the people that have been linked to the clinton family including
[1:35:22.820 --> 1:35:29.220]  seth rich that have been killed mysteriously or suicides 40 people it's just a coincidence
[1:35:29.220 --> 1:35:34.260]  over the years and you know what i'm hoping is that eventually all of this stuff will be out in
[1:35:34.260 --> 1:35:41.140]  the open and one of the good things that we do have free speech that we do have independent
[1:35:41.140 --> 1:35:45.540]  journalists which are being labeled as fake news but aren't really the fake news they're the real
[1:35:45.540 --> 1:35:50.820]  news and that's why people are just getting sick and tired of watching msnbc and cnn and everything
[1:35:50.820 --> 1:35:57.060]  just because it's they don't report on the real issues that people want to hear about and that's
[1:35:57.060 --> 1:36:01.620]  another weird thing that's going on right now dr group when i go out on the streets and i talk to
[1:36:01.620 --> 1:36:06.420]  the trump haters okay even the trump haters even the people that are never trumpers they know
[1:36:06.420 --> 1:36:12.260]  cnn is fake news they know msnbc is fake news they hate the fake news as much as anybody
[1:36:12.260 --> 1:36:17.540]  yet they still buy all of the nonsense that they're selling i'd say what i mean if you just look at
[1:36:17.540 --> 1:36:25.140]  the at the obama administration and you know you look at the trump administration every single word
[1:36:25.140 --> 1:36:31.620]  is changed into this conspiracy that you know trump said this and this can you imagine if the
[1:36:31.620 --> 1:36:38.820]  mainstream media even 100th of the stuff that happened under the obama administration with
[1:36:38.820 --> 1:36:45.140]  the birth certificate and this and that and all of the uh support of you know the muslim
[1:36:45.780 --> 1:36:51.460]  terrorists and the brotherhoods and all of the information i mean if yeah i was talking to you
[1:36:51.460 --> 1:36:58.660]  that we just got a report today uh from circa from sarah carter the obama administration was spying
[1:36:58.660 --> 1:37:04.660]  illegally for eight years yeah i mean they can do whatever they want and it's no one even you
[1:37:04.660 --> 1:37:09.540]  know bats a finger at it yet we get into a new administration and they're just wanting scared
[1:37:09.540 --> 1:37:14.740]  is my opinion i mean i i have insiders and i talk to people as well because pretty much everybody
[1:37:14.740 --> 1:37:21.140]  regardless of who they are has health problems and a lot of them come to me and you know what i'm
[1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:27.700]  hearing is just that it is so big the swamp is so big there's so many people involved that
[1:37:28.420 --> 1:37:33.140]  you know so many people would go down if the truth comes out so that's why there's such
[1:37:33.140 --> 1:37:38.740]  a suppression of truth just like a suppression of all of the cures that we've had you know all
[1:37:38.740 --> 1:37:45.140]  the suppression of all of the chemicals that are sprayed on us a suppression of all of those things
[1:37:45.140 --> 1:37:50.020]  because they don't want the general population to find out what's really going on and thank god for
[1:37:50.020 --> 1:37:55.300]  info wars and thank god for all of the you know info warriors that are out there that are making
[1:37:55.300 --> 1:38:01.700]  a difference every single day and actually changing the world because it's the we the people that are
[1:38:01.700 --> 1:38:08.900]  making a difference out there so it's it's really upsetting that you have a murder slash
[1:38:08.900 --> 1:38:17.620]  suicide with seph rich out there and it's getting no attention there's you know obviously there's
[1:38:17.620 --> 1:38:22.580]  collusion and interactions between the dnc and different types of parties involved there
[1:38:22.580 --> 1:38:27.860]  and i just hope that i mean i know hanity is is not going to be covering the seph rich story
[1:38:27.860 --> 1:38:33.060]  anymore because of the family doesn't want him covering that but i just hope that the truth
[1:38:33.060 --> 1:38:38.820]  comes out and i think that the truth is coming out and people are starting to look in different
[1:38:38.820 --> 1:38:45.060]  places for the truth i mean it's also sickening to see google and facebook and all the censorship
[1:38:45.060 --> 1:38:50.500]  that's going on right now you know six months ago a year ago you could type in seph rich
[1:38:50.500 --> 1:38:57.620]  and google and you would actually be able to get on the first page a non biased results i mean sure
[1:38:57.620 --> 1:39:03.140]  you you could make your own conclusion is this fake news or is this you know real reporting or
[1:39:03.140 --> 1:39:10.100]  independent journalism going on and now it's just nothing but the mainstream you know what google
[1:39:10.100 --> 1:39:15.940]  wants you to see and what google wants you to read for the first three pages because they know
[1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:21.700]  that no one is going to go past the third page and we've we've exhibited that in real time and i
[1:39:21.700 --> 1:39:25.220]  can just say from my use of the internet you know i'm a news reporter i'm always looking for stories
[1:39:25.220 --> 1:39:29.700]  i'm always doing this i can just tell you from my experience how i've seen the difference um in the
[1:39:29.700 --> 1:39:35.460]  changing of the priority of what gets ahead too and you can do the test for yourself you can go to
[1:39:35.460 --> 1:39:40.180]  Bing uh actually a new a new website that i actually use instead of google now when i'm doing research
[1:39:40.180 --> 1:39:45.220]  is duck duck go duck duck go is a great search engine there's some aspects of it i think they're
[1:39:45.220 --> 1:39:49.620]  still behind uh google but they definitely don't filter their results which is which is huge when
[1:39:49.620 --> 1:39:53.940]  you're trying to do some of this research but you know i think that you just hit the nail on the head
[1:39:53.940 --> 1:40:00.580]  and we're all thinking it but you kind of just crystallized it the real collusion is the swamp
[1:40:00.580 --> 1:40:06.580]  that's the real collusion it's all the corruption that's been going on for 10 20 30 40 50 years how
[1:40:06.580 --> 1:40:12.500]  long these people have been in office that's the real collusion is covering that up hiding that
[1:40:12.500 --> 1:40:17.300]  not letting the public get that intel to know that that's the swamp that's the collusion that's
[1:40:17.300 --> 1:40:22.340]  who's been screwing this country over not donald trump who just decided to run for office two years
[1:40:22.340 --> 1:40:27.540]  ago not the deplorables that elected him the deep state that's the collusion and it's a
[1:40:27.540 --> 1:40:33.300]  soloski technique to blame your opposition for the thing that you're doing so they're the ones
[1:40:33.300 --> 1:40:38.500]  colluding so then they blame russia for colluding with trump they blame trump for colluding with
[1:40:38.500 --> 1:40:44.260]  russia obviously fake news and here's why i think the truth about seth rich is so near and dear to
[1:40:44.260 --> 1:40:55.620]  me and so important if we can get the truth about seth rich out there in triplicate cold undeniable
[1:40:55.620 --> 1:41:01.780]  provable facts where even the dumbest of the dumb liberals who would deny their own hand in front
[1:41:01.780 --> 1:41:08.420]  of their face would have to accept that seth rich was the leaker to wiki leaks maybe we never know
[1:41:08.420 --> 1:41:13.860]  what happened to him maybe we never know what happened to with the murder okay but if we get
[1:41:13.860 --> 1:41:19.140]  the cold out evidence and we know for a fact that it was seth rich indeed who gave the dnc emails to
[1:41:19.140 --> 1:41:26.420]  wiki leaks that will change everything that that changes everything it exposes everyone in government
[1:41:26.420 --> 1:41:31.380]  who's been crying russian collusion for the last two years as a total fraud it exposes everyone in
[1:41:31.380 --> 1:41:37.140]  the media who's been crying the russian collusion narrative for two years as a total fraud we know
[1:41:37.140 --> 1:41:43.780]  the frauds we know who they are this can be the skeleton key this can be the pandora's box that
[1:41:43.780 --> 1:41:49.860]  will end the real fake news and the real collusion that's why i want to get the truth about seth rich
[1:41:49.860 --> 1:41:57.140]  because i truly believe that even the liberals because seth rich was a democrat for bernie sanders
[1:41:57.140 --> 1:42:03.620]  even the liberals will have to say okay you know what it was seth rich i cannot believe that the
[1:42:03.620 --> 1:42:09.860]  government and the media lied about russia i guess that's the question just like can they accept
[1:42:09.860 --> 1:42:16.260]  which they couldn't accept the realities of obama or hillary clinton can they accept the reality
[1:42:16.260 --> 1:42:21.380]  that it was an inside source that leaked the dnc emails and that's what cost hillary the election
[1:42:21.380 --> 1:42:27.460]  not russia can they get over that brainwashing that that mind control russia narrative if we get
[1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:31.380]  the truth about it out there i guess that's the next question dr ruth think about how much money
[1:42:31.380 --> 1:42:37.540]  is being spent by the american taxpayers millions months okay how long does it take to figure out
[1:42:37.540 --> 1:42:43.380]  if there was a conversation between donald trump and the russians that was detrimental to national
[1:42:43.380 --> 1:42:48.820]  security which doesn't even address the issue it it's just it has nothing to do with wiki leaks
[1:42:48.820 --> 1:42:53.860]  yeah they just keep making stuff up and making stuff up but again once again it all goes back to
[1:42:54.420 --> 1:42:58.580]  the root cause if you look at washington over the last hundred years and you look at lobbyists
[1:42:58.580 --> 1:43:02.580]  and you look at the pharmaceutical industry and you look at the oil and gas industry and you
[1:43:02.580 --> 1:43:09.700]  see that the fda is run by monsanto and pharmaceutical past pharmaceutical leaders there's a great
[1:43:09.700 --> 1:43:14.580]  vin diagram if you guys can pull that up the vin diagram with the fda and monsanto showing all the
[1:43:14.580 --> 1:43:18.340]  people that work for both of them i think mike taylor was the main guy go ahead so i mean all it
[1:43:18.340 --> 1:43:22.020]  is is about you know you talk about the swamp and you talk about the deep state and they're really
[1:43:22.020 --> 1:43:28.420]  illusion it really yeah talk about collusion i mean the nothing but nothing from the democrats
[1:43:28.420 --> 1:43:32.420]  on that collusion though if you want to go deep state you know look at the club do your research on
[1:43:32.420 --> 1:43:37.460]  the club of rome mk ultra programs all the top secret uh governmental operations that have been
[1:43:37.460 --> 1:43:42.820]  going on even dating back to putting fluoride in the water i mean it's all the thing is they
[1:43:42.820 --> 1:43:48.500]  the illuminati's and the people that are running the world and trying to control the population
[1:43:49.540 --> 1:43:54.500]  it's all out in the open what we talk about here is not something that we're just making up out of
[1:43:54.500 --> 1:43:59.140]  thin air and saying all this is happening now too you know it's it but that's part of the whole plan
[1:43:59.140 --> 1:44:03.700]  because they have to make it obvious lighting you it's hollywood and they have to show you
[1:44:03.700 --> 1:44:08.340]  years in advance that this is going to take place and then this is going to take place and it's
[1:44:08.340 --> 1:44:12.740]  controlling your mind with all these suicide bombings and making you believe that you know
[1:44:12.740 --> 1:44:18.340]  in in fear with terrorist attacks and then trying to manipulate you through the media
[1:44:19.060 --> 1:44:22.980]  really is the main source and that's another reason i think they're running scared right
[1:44:22.980 --> 1:44:28.900]  now it's because they they're realizing for the first time that the media is actually losing control
[1:44:28.900 --> 1:44:35.300]  the people are taking information under their own discernment right now mm-hmm people are waking up
[1:44:35.300 --> 1:44:38.660]  people are waiting so but here's the thing too dr rube and this is something that's obviously
[1:44:38.660 --> 1:44:42.500]  developed with all the new technologies it has to do with the chemicals in fact there was a new
[1:44:42.500 --> 1:44:47.620]  study that just came out uh they just released this study that vaccines lead to an increase in
[1:44:47.620 --> 1:44:52.980]  adhd okay that's a big problem in our society so you've got this news cycle now where people can't
[1:44:52.980 --> 1:44:58.020]  really operate outside of a 24-hour news cycle they can't think about the bigger picture think
[1:44:58.020 --> 1:45:03.940]  about it like this just look at the last 20 years and under 20 years how the narrative has changed
[1:45:03.940 --> 1:45:08.100]  this is the gas lighting that i think you're talking about so september 11th happens and it's like
[1:45:08.660 --> 1:45:14.020]  boom radical islamists just attacked your country boom we're going to war we're gonna lie all about
[1:45:14.020 --> 1:45:19.140]  it but don't worry radical islam attacked your country radical islam killed thousands of americans
[1:45:19.140 --> 1:45:23.780]  so we're gonna invade the middle east we're gonna fight tear but now what's the case 15 to 20 years
[1:45:23.780 --> 1:45:28.900]  later be tolerant there's no such thing as radical islam this doesn't exist wait did you ever hear
[1:45:28.900 --> 1:45:35.540]  of al qaeda before 9 11 me personally no i would you know about it no no no i didn't know about
[1:45:35.540 --> 1:45:39.380]  anything okay was he a baseball player for the brave or something that's what i would ask but no
[1:45:39.380 --> 1:45:43.380]  no it's just like all of a sudden we hear about al qaeda right after a terrorist attack and then
[1:45:43.380 --> 1:45:46.980]  all of a sudden al qaeda is gone and then all of a sudden there's a new one isis which we never
[1:45:46.980 --> 1:45:51.220]  heard about ice and they don't even 11 either and they don't even report on the fact see that's the
[1:45:51.220 --> 1:45:57.460]  thing they won't even report how years before you know al qaeda was created by the u.s. government
[1:45:57.460 --> 1:46:03.060]  to force regime changes in areas of russia and the middle east they don't ever talk about that
[1:46:03.060 --> 1:46:08.340]  because we if you look at what's taught to our children in school these days it's just bogus
[1:46:08.340 --> 1:46:16.660]  mind manipulating subjects that's why our kids these days are have hard communication skills
[1:46:16.660 --> 1:46:20.100]  they they were because of all the technology and everything they're not learning the right
[1:46:20.100 --> 1:46:25.380]  things that they need to learn in schools it's all done on purpose to try to control even
[1:46:26.180 --> 1:46:31.620]  you know i was doing research and looking at dating back how are they how is this whole
[1:46:31.620 --> 1:46:37.540]  process taking place look at your home like everything in your house is designed to make
[1:46:37.540 --> 1:46:43.860]  you sick take your kitchen for example okay you might have radon being emitted in your kitchen
[1:46:43.860 --> 1:46:48.020]  you have tap water that you're cooking with coming out of your kitchen sink and you have
[1:46:48.020 --> 1:46:51.940]  fluoride concentrates when it's heated up yeah you have all the fluoride and all that that you're
[1:46:51.940 --> 1:46:56.180]  cooking your food with oh the introduction of microwaves this is just the kitchen we can go
[1:46:56.180 --> 1:47:02.420]  room by room and i can explain to you how by design the rooms in your house you were fired up because
[1:47:02.420 --> 1:47:07.140]  you had a list of all the things that are in your kitchen that are poisoning you yeah and
[1:47:07.140 --> 1:47:11.540]  we'll cover that in the next hour because i really think it's important but it also goes back to
[1:47:12.180 --> 1:47:16.820]  the whole point that we're trying to make with the the deep state and how deep it actually
[1:47:16.820 --> 1:47:20.660]  so let's get back to that for a second okay so we've got this video this is brennan
[1:47:20.660 --> 1:47:26.100]  who i don't trust brennan as far as i could throw him but even brennan this is brennan saying now
[1:47:26.100 --> 1:47:31.300]  again this whole narrative is kind of different but this is brennan talking about the allegation
[1:47:31.300 --> 1:47:37.300]  that donald trump tried to shut down the russia probe via firing james comey here's john brennan
[1:47:37.300 --> 1:47:43.300]  uh fall upon a comment that i made in the opening statement uh and that is with respect to number
[1:47:43.300 --> 1:47:49.060]  the allegations there's adam shift recently total power that the president or his aides may have
[1:47:49.060 --> 1:47:54.660]  sought to enlist the help of members of the ic or director comey himself to drop the flint
[1:47:54.660 --> 1:48:01.780]  investigation uh have any members of the ic shared with you uh their concerns that the president was
[1:48:01.780 --> 1:48:06.500]  attempting to enlist the help of people i see his intelligence community to drop the flint
[1:48:06.500 --> 1:48:13.540]  investigation no sir um are you aware of any uh efforts the president has made to enlist the
[1:48:13.540 --> 1:48:19.140]  support of inner uh intelligence community personnel to push back on uh a narrative
[1:48:19.140 --> 1:48:23.860]  involving the collusion issue that mr rooney was asking about i am unaware of it so this is why i
[1:48:23.860 --> 1:48:28.180]  said earlier that president trump is handcuffed right now because i'm telling you like you were
[1:48:28.180 --> 1:48:32.900]  saying all of the money and time that's being wasted on this russia thing i guarantee you trump is
[1:48:32.900 --> 1:48:37.220]  pulling his hair out over this he's a businessman he's about the bottom line this is a waste this
[1:48:37.220 --> 1:48:41.700]  is putting us into the red but he's handcuffed because if he comes out and he says that if he
[1:48:41.700 --> 1:48:46.420]  comes out and he says we need to stop it then he's colluding then he must be working with russia
[1:48:46.420 --> 1:48:52.500]  even though when it was alleged that he tried to do that to shut down the investigation comey may
[1:48:52.500 --> 1:48:57.620]  have perjured himself in this case or he lied well either he perjured himself and lied or he
[1:48:57.620 --> 1:49:03.460]  just lied but even they are saying donald trump never tried to interfere with this investigation
[1:49:03.460 --> 1:49:08.340]  why because he's smart and he knows if he did even though he's pulling his hair out over this i
[1:49:08.340 --> 1:49:12.580]  guarantee it if he did they would be attacking him all day long saying that this proves he's the
[1:49:12.580 --> 1:49:20.580]  russian agent well because his job as a ceo as a business leader is to create change and make that
[1:49:20.580 --> 1:49:26.900]  business great again and right now the business is making america great again we're 20 trillion
[1:49:26.900 --> 1:49:32.020]  or more than that in debt right now that's happened over the last and i'm not saying it was just the
[1:49:32.020 --> 1:49:38.100]  obama administration it dates back before they're the bush administration too his job is to make sure
[1:49:38.100 --> 1:49:43.540]  that we look at all the spending that we have where we're wasting money because washington
[1:49:43.540 --> 1:49:49.220]  has been nothing but flushing money down the toilet for years and years and years and over
[1:49:49.220 --> 1:49:55.540]  spending on everything yet for the most of most of the stuff they overspend on doesn't do us any
[1:49:55.540 --> 1:50:01.220]  good as a society but it's all about what you were talking about the deep deep state and the
[1:50:01.220 --> 1:50:06.900]  collusion between it took a hundred years okay when the am a was developed america medical
[1:50:06.900 --> 1:50:12.660]  association you look back a hundred years oil and gas industry it took a hundred years republican
[1:50:12.660 --> 1:50:21.220]  and democrat with the deep state being run by illuminati type forces to to get all of that in
[1:50:21.940 --> 1:50:28.580]  with the chemical approvals with all of the all of the stuff that's killing not only us but killing
[1:50:28.580 --> 1:50:32.980]  the planet as well at the same time and they're saying oh it's climate change but when you look
[1:50:32.980 --> 1:50:36.980]  at the amount of chemicals that we're putting in the air that are approved by the epa and all the
[1:50:36.980 --> 1:50:42.020]  other stuff then you start saying well no it's not really climate change but the thing is or it is
[1:50:42.020 --> 1:50:46.980]  man-made climate change they're literally here they're seeing a hundred years worth of work start
[1:50:46.980 --> 1:50:52.660]  to slowly crumble because they don't have one of their own in office we're beating it and and again
[1:50:52.660 --> 1:50:56.580]  whether you like trump or not he's not with him and we've got more on trump cutting the deficit on

[1:54:23.140 --> 1:54:28.980]  of news and uh we were just about to talk about trump's budget the deficit in this country that's
[1:54:28.980 --> 1:54:32.980]  spiraling out of control trump is actually doing something about it wow i didn't even know that was
[1:54:32.980 --> 1:54:43.380]  possible but we're going to take your calls in the next hour 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231
[1:54:43.380 --> 1:54:49.300]  we'll take your calls uh myself and dr group in the next hour but so i've got some news here we
[1:54:49.300 --> 1:54:54.020]  were just talking about the debt it was almost reaching a point doctor group where i didn't
[1:54:54.020 --> 1:54:58.100]  think anything could even be done with the debt it's just like a ticking clock that just goes
[1:54:58.100 --> 1:55:04.740]  up and up but trump is actually cutting the the budget right now which is a start it's a start
[1:55:04.740 --> 1:55:10.660]  it's not a be all end all but a couple stories from the daily caller here trump proposes 3.6
[1:55:10.660 --> 1:55:22.420]  trillion cut to welfare state thank you this is how you look you know if i'm in debt if i'm broke
[1:55:23.140 --> 1:55:28.020]  okay and i drive by uh you know a homeless guy on the side of the road but i don't have any money
[1:55:28.020 --> 1:55:34.020]  to give him i don't have any money to give him i can't help him okay we've got a government that
[1:55:34.020 --> 1:55:41.380]  is broke why are we paying non-citizens to come here and live let alone anybody that's a citizen
[1:55:41.380 --> 1:55:50.660]  here how about all the non-citizens so trump 3.6 trillion dollar cut to the welfare state that
[1:55:50.660 --> 1:55:59.860]  is huge and i'm imagining here's another one trump budget aims to eliminate tax credits for
[1:55:59.860 --> 1:56:07.140]  illegal immigrants wow america first policies president donald trump's budget proposal for 2018
[1:56:07.140 --> 1:56:11.620]  prevents illegal immigrants from claiming two major tax credits for low and middle income people
[1:56:12.580 --> 1:56:18.340]  according to the white house documents released uh tuesday morning the 4.1 trillion budget cut
[1:56:18.340 --> 1:56:25.380]  would restrict eligibility for the ietc and the child tax credit to tax players who are authorized
[1:56:25.380 --> 1:56:33.220]  to work in the us so no longer are non-citizens getting these tax cut benefits uh that they were
[1:56:33.220 --> 1:56:38.420]  before that americans most likely aren't getting or aren't taking advantage of so there you go
[1:56:38.420 --> 1:56:44.180]  dr group it seems like an impossible task to cut the budget it seems like an impossible task for
[1:56:44.180 --> 1:56:50.900]  peace in the middle east but trump does appear to be going after both right now that all sounds good
[1:56:50.900 --> 1:56:56.180]  i mean it all sounds good i'm all for helping people um but if you look at society and we're
[1:56:56.180 --> 1:57:00.580]  we're always hiring people and trying to hire as many people as we can and i know info wars is as
[1:57:00.580 --> 1:57:12.340]  well um you know it's it's really hard these days uh because there's such you know all of these
[1:57:13.140 --> 1:57:19.140]  problems that we've had over the last 20 years you're starting to see it in the workforce when
[1:57:19.140 --> 1:57:25.780]  you i'm like listen let's get people to work all the time let's help as many people as we can but
[1:57:25.780 --> 1:57:31.300]  we also have to educate people the right way and we have to let them know that they and train them
[1:57:31.300 --> 1:57:37.460]  the right way and it all goes back to the proper type of schooling and it all goes back to identifying
[1:57:37.460 --> 1:57:42.340]  the root cause of the problem when you put somebody on welfare for a long period of time
[1:57:43.300 --> 1:57:47.220]  why would they want to work they're not going to want to work anymore i mean it's a thing with
[1:57:47.220 --> 1:57:51.220]  we talk we talk to these guys that are looking for jobs and they've been out of work six months
[1:57:51.220 --> 1:57:55.940]  they've been out of work a year they've been out of work two years in today's society you
[1:57:55.940 --> 1:58:01.220]  almost if you're gone for six months you're so far behind already so what happens is we're paying
[1:58:01.220 --> 1:58:07.540]  these guys you know all this this work compensation for so long and why do they want to go back to
[1:58:07.540 --> 1:58:11.780]  work when we're paying them all this workers compensation fees and when they do want to go
[1:58:11.780 --> 1:58:17.860]  back to work it's just creating more and more situations that we're having to deal with but
[1:58:17.860 --> 1:58:22.420]  i'm glad we're taking this on and trying to create a societal problem and it also creates
[1:58:22.420 --> 1:58:27.460]  a debt problem so it's a two it's a two-edged sword yes and we're stabbing ourselves with it but it
[1:58:27.460 --> 1:58:31.780]  looks like president trump is finally starting to do something about it we will start to take
[1:58:31.780 --> 1:58:44.660]  your calls on the other side i'll ensure your doctor group filling in for alex jones will be right back
[1:58:44.660 --> 1:58:46.980]  visit gcnlive.com today
[1:58:50.500 --> 1:58:56.980]  in america's 240 plus year history we have seen veterans from the first battles at lecington and
[1:58:56.980 --> 1:59:02.340]  concord right through to our military trying to take out isis today fight their hearts out and in

[2:00:42.660 --> 2:00:50.420]  lined up oensroyer dr group with you we've got a lot more news to cover as well you know we were
[2:00:50.420 --> 2:00:55.300]  talking outside of the break it's talked about trump's brink's brinksmanship it's talked about
[2:00:55.300 --> 2:01:04.900]  trump playing 6d chess i do think that trump is a lot smarter than than even he himself is probably
[2:01:04.900 --> 2:01:10.420]  letting on and he does have a lot of things that are planned for the future and he's kind of moving
[2:01:10.420 --> 2:01:17.220]  in a in a kind of paced out timescale and one of the big things is that he's dealing with right now
[2:01:17.220 --> 2:01:21.700]  is leaks in fact we'll play that video in a second and then we'll take your calls and get the more
[2:01:21.700 --> 2:01:28.020]  news on the other side but let's recall that and i remember talking to alex about this when this
[2:01:28.020 --> 2:01:33.300]  came out joe Lieberman was allegedly being considered for the fbi director position
[2:01:34.260 --> 2:01:39.540]  and dr group i remember saying on air to me this feels like perhaps a fake leak this seems
[2:01:39.540 --> 2:01:43.700]  like maybe trump leaks this out to a member of his cabinet or this or that and he sees
[2:01:43.700 --> 2:01:49.140]  where it goes if it goes legs and then he says oh here's a leaker what do you know and now it comes
[2:01:49.140 --> 2:01:55.460]  out today joe Lieberman no longer being considered so i'm wondering if joe Lieberman was ever really
[2:01:55.460 --> 2:02:00.020]  actually being considered for that role or if that was just a trump troll that he put out there
[2:02:00.020 --> 2:02:04.260]  now i agree i think that there's definitely some chess games being played now considering
[2:02:04.260 --> 2:02:08.500]  what's happened obviously that we've been watching since the trump administration has started
[2:02:08.500 --> 2:02:16.340]  i uh you know i'm an american i i was in the military so you know my job was to always support
[2:02:16.340 --> 2:02:21.540]  the commander in chief and i think that you know you have the chuck schumer's out there you have
[2:02:21.540 --> 2:02:28.100]  the maxine waters you have the nancy polosi's out there i mean talking about mental health and you
[2:02:28.100 --> 2:02:34.260]  look at people in our government in their case a lack thereof a lack thereof is what i was trying
[2:02:34.260 --> 2:02:39.540]  to get i mean nancy polosi she even has a hard time pronouncing china and it's just it's it's
[2:02:39.540 --> 2:02:45.140]  amazing to me when you see this and the attacks how can people be so negative and so violent
[2:02:45.140 --> 2:02:51.860]  i don't remember anybody on the republican side coming out with so much violence and you know that
[2:02:51.860 --> 2:02:58.500]  is but but dr group you can speak to this that is a side effect when elderly people start to go
[2:02:58.500 --> 2:03:04.660]  through stages of dementia or Alzheimer's or other you know mental defects like that they start to get
[2:03:04.660 --> 2:03:10.580]  angry that actually is an issue that they have right i think everybody in government over the age
[2:03:10.580 --> 2:03:16.660]  of six over the age of 60 should go through some sort of a mental evaluation and i'm not just saying
[2:03:16.660 --> 2:03:23.060]  that now i'm just saying it mental health is becoming one of the world's largest situations
[2:03:23.060 --> 2:03:28.820]  that we're having to deal with and one of the most expensive in health care and just today as a
[2:03:28.820 --> 2:03:33.940]  matter of fact you know speaking of health care which has been very quiet the the health care
[2:03:33.940 --> 2:03:40.420]  reform today is the day the senate can begin the health care discussions uh because they're going
[2:03:40.420 --> 2:03:45.700]  to finally get the official word from the congressional budget office so i have submitted
[2:03:45.700 --> 2:03:53.620]  multiple requests uh to the to the president to the office at addressing the root cause of our
[2:03:53.620 --> 2:04:00.180]  health care problems in america today which is the toxic food the toxic water the toxic air
[2:04:00.180 --> 2:04:04.980]  and all the chemicals that the government the toxic and the and the in the vaccines and everything
[2:04:04.980 --> 2:04:09.060]  it sounds like a broken record all the time talking about all these toxins everywhere but
[2:04:09.060 --> 2:04:16.500]  when you spend 20 years tracing to the root cause of all disease and knowing that the root cause of
[2:04:16.500 --> 2:04:21.220]  all disease is basically too many chemicals and toxins coming into your body and not enough coming
[2:04:21.220 --> 2:04:27.940]  out and we were talking about the home and how that was specifically designed to make you sick
[2:04:27.940 --> 2:04:31.780]  when you live in a home or an apartment and we were talking about the kitchen and thinking about
[2:04:31.780 --> 2:04:38.180]  how many chemicals and toxins are in your kitchen alone you look at the two places that people
[2:04:38.180 --> 2:04:41.860]  spend the most time the kitchen and the bedroom and we'll come back right after this with your

[2:08:19.300 --> 2:08:24.340]  about how epic these times are and i mean we both recognize how epic they are and even we
[2:08:24.340 --> 2:08:28.500]  probably can't even fully comprehend how epic these times are the revolutions that are going on
[2:08:29.460 --> 2:08:33.940]  truly just it's unbelievable what history will say about these times in 20 30 40 years and people

[2:12:47.700 --> 2:12:53.380]  and if it wasn't for all the products because listen how many people the the big companies
[2:12:53.380 --> 2:12:57.460]  and corporations out there they just want to advertise on the mainstream news i mean they
[2:12:57.460 --> 2:13:02.020]  you know they don't want to be associated with this so alex has to fund this operation
[2:13:02.020 --> 2:13:08.020]  through other methods so all the donations that people send in all the support for the products
[2:13:08.020 --> 2:13:11.620]  which you're going to take the products you're going to feel great you're going to have changes
[2:13:11.620 --> 2:13:16.660]  in your health you're going to be smarter the iodine is going to detoxify the chlorine the
[2:13:16.660 --> 2:13:21.860]  bromine and the fluoride that people you don't need this technology you don't need the nano cells
[2:13:21.860 --> 2:13:27.860]  god gave us a body that can repair itself and be great with the actual natural organic elements
[2:13:27.860 --> 2:13:33.380]  of earth god gave us a self healing mechanism and all we need to do is activate it and cleansing
[2:13:33.380 --> 2:13:39.140]  and detoxification and giving the body the clean food and the clean water and the proper supplements
[2:13:39.140 --> 2:13:44.660]  that have been taken away from us in order for us to heal ourselves and that's really how you
[2:13:44.660 --> 2:13:48.980]  change the health care system i mean that's what i've been trying to get across to these guys
[2:13:48.980 --> 2:13:54.500]  for 15 years and insurance companies they need to cover and i'm hoping i'm really hoping that
[2:13:54.500 --> 2:13:58.660]  the changes that they're going to make to the hsa and the health care plan are going to support
[2:13:58.660 --> 2:14:04.980]  more preventative medicine because if you can prevent people from getting sick educate people
[2:14:04.980 --> 2:14:11.540]  on why they're getting sick then they won't get sick and it won't be such a burden on
[2:14:11.540 --> 2:14:15.620]  all of us in the united states and and the health care system as a whole united states
[2:14:15.620 --> 2:14:20.500]  is ranked almost last but we spend the most in the world and we spend the most money yes so let's
[2:14:20.500 --> 2:14:26.180]  get to some calls well i just want to say this to health insurance starts with self consciousness
[2:14:26.180 --> 2:14:30.260]  it should be upon yourself to take care of yourself not the government all right with that
[2:14:30.260 --> 2:14:36.100]  we'll go to some calls let's go to eric in wisconsin who says he wants to start a petition to audit
[2:14:36.100 --> 2:14:43.380]  the media that is an interesting notion go ahead eric other than going on uh what's up doctor group
[2:14:43.380 --> 2:14:51.700]  uh great job today oh and you're really destroying as usual uh doctor group your products changed my
[2:14:51.700 --> 2:14:58.420]  life um thank you so much for the work that you do uh i just wanted to call today because i found

[2:16:45.540 --> 2:16:54.740]  gets done about it i mean there's no independent investigation uh you know organizations that are
[2:16:54.740 --> 2:16:59.860]  put together to look at all this stuff and you know yet we have some tiny phone call where we have the
[2:16:59.860 --> 2:17:04.900]  whole senate and congress and the whole government looking at it indeed you know these are the this
[2:17:04.900 --> 2:17:10.420]  is the kind of corruption that i'm hoping will eventually end the government and that's my
[2:17:10.420 --> 2:17:14.980]  thing too dr group like i mean i'm honestly not the smartest guy in the world i can barely even
[2:17:14.980 --> 2:17:21.540]  do any math okay but i have a knack for following all the news connecting the dots and then coming
[2:17:21.540 --> 2:17:25.780]  on here like tasmanian devil and trying to bring people to news but then there are actual people
[2:17:25.780 --> 2:17:31.460]  who are smart who can go into the muck and explain this stuff like andrew kerr who then files the
[2:17:31.460 --> 2:17:37.860]  report breaks down the numbers gets the information gets the addresses shows you where it happens
[2:17:37.860 --> 2:17:42.660]  and then nothing gets done and so we report on it we try to get it out there thank you eric for
[2:17:42.660 --> 2:17:48.020]  the call and uh we'll we showed the article there and uh we'll try to actually find the original

[2:24:41.060 --> 2:24:45.860]  soon as trump takes off the new york's time times publishers a story the washington post
[2:24:45.860 --> 2:24:52.820]  publishes a story both smearing trump with leaks from inside now trump's been gone and the leaks
[2:24:52.820 --> 2:24:59.460]  have stopped it comes out joe Lieberman is not being considered anymore but is president trump
[2:24:59.460 --> 2:25:06.260]  preparing to fire multiple staff members for leaks here's a report on that information good
[2:25:06.260 --> 2:25:11.060]  evening from the north lawn of the white house we come to you tonight with breaking news sources
[2:25:11.060 --> 2:25:16.020]  telling one american news today that president trump will be firing multiple staffers when he
[2:25:16.020 --> 2:25:22.340]  returns from his trip abroad these staffers are said to be fired for leaking classified information
[2:25:22.340 --> 2:25:27.620]  again uh we are getting word tonight here in the nation's capital that president trump will be
[2:25:27.620 --> 2:25:33.140]  making a number of dismissals from his white house staff a source here today at the white house
[2:25:33.140 --> 2:25:38.100]  told me that three people have been identified as leaking classified information this has been a
[2:25:38.100 --> 2:25:43.620]  major issue for the trump administration since president trump came into office on january 20
[2:25:43.620 --> 2:25:49.380]  inauguration day here in washington dc one of the sources that i spoke with today though telling me
[2:25:49.380 --> 2:25:53.940]  that this is criminal and that people could go to jail that source went on to say that this is
[2:25:53.940 --> 2:26:00.500]  dangerous and also terrible yes drain that swamp president trump it's time for you to start firing
[2:26:00.500 --> 2:26:05.620]  people at will i would not complain about that for one second but you know it's interesting this
[2:26:05.620 --> 2:26:12.420]  double standard that i continue to see dr group they all want to complain about donald trump the
[2:26:12.420 --> 2:26:16.420]  never trumpers the anti trumpers the democrats they want to complain about donald trump leaking
[2:26:16.420 --> 2:26:22.100]  intel donald trump giving classified intel to him who her the other this which way that and the other
[2:26:22.100 --> 2:26:29.620]  thing but let's not forget it was hillary clinton that had a private server that was most likely
[2:26:29.620 --> 2:26:36.420]  hacked that had dozens of classified documents on it so if trump has anything to do with
[2:26:36.420 --> 2:26:41.940]  classification documents being leaked or classified intel being leaked send the hounds after him but
[2:26:41.940 --> 2:26:50.260]  if it's hillary clinton there was no intent she's an innocent angel we're not going to question
[2:26:50.260 --> 2:26:55.220]  hillary clinton and the classified information that she leaked out we've got to stop trump
[2:26:56.020 --> 2:27:00.580]  after all he's the one that's been in government for decades oh wait no that's hillary clinton
[2:27:00.580 --> 2:27:04.580]  he's the one that made the iranium deal with right oh wait no that's hillary clinton
[2:27:04.580 --> 2:27:09.620]  he's the one that took all the foreign money into his foundation no wait that's hillary clinton
[2:27:09.620 --> 2:27:14.100]  he's the one whose campaign advisor john put estimate stock deals with the no wait that was
[2:27:14.100 --> 2:27:19.620]  hillary clinton too oh okay let's take some calls let's go to john in wisconsin he's actually got
[2:27:19.620 --> 2:27:26.900]  a question for dr group go ahead john yeah actually i got uh questions for both of you but
[2:27:26.900 --> 2:27:34.420]  dr group first um in your research and or feedback have you gotten anything from people who suffer
[2:27:34.420 --> 2:27:44.980]  from tbi traumatic brain injury and what uh yeah yes yes yeah that's actually a lot of soldiers
[2:27:44.980 --> 2:27:52.340]  uh coming back from the war that were involved uh with explosions uh they have temporary brain
[2:27:52.340 --> 2:27:58.420]  inflammation or some sort of uh brain damage from that and there are some things that you can do to
[2:27:59.540 --> 2:28:06.260]  really you know kind of repair some of that damage number one is obviously going to avoid
[2:28:06.820 --> 2:28:12.180]  any you know metals that you're bringing in you can get your mercury amalgams removed and you
[2:28:12.180 --> 2:28:16.100]  want to look at what are the things that really affect the brain tissue a lot of its aluminum
[2:28:16.100 --> 2:28:20.340]  mercury and you have your fluoride and your halogens so you know really cleaning up your
[2:28:20.340 --> 2:28:24.900]  food supply i tell you though i've been doing a lot of research on fasting lately and this goes
[2:28:24.900 --> 2:28:31.140]  back thousands of years and and i've myself have completed a five-day water fast recently and have
[2:28:31.140 --> 2:28:34.900]  been doing intermittent fasting and kind of doing a lot of research projects on myself
[2:28:36.100 --> 2:28:40.500]  and there there have been a lot of studies that have come out on how fasting literally
[2:28:40.500 --> 2:28:46.580]  regenerates tissue as a matter of fact usc came out with a study saying three days 72 hour fast
[2:28:46.580 --> 2:28:53.860]  regenerate your immune system and fasting actually recreates stem cells unfortunately in my research
[2:28:53.860 --> 2:28:59.540]  i found that a lot of that scientific material was burned because it was very popular think about it
[2:28:59.540 --> 2:29:06.340]  if you a hundred years ago 200 years ago if you don't have the knowledge of herbs or anything
[2:29:06.340 --> 2:29:12.260]  like that what did people do when they got sick they use the sun they use the air and they use
[2:29:12.260 --> 2:29:17.060]  the water to heal themselves i mean healing the body doesn't have to be super super hard it really
[2:29:17.060 --> 2:29:23.460]  everything is in simplicity and all the mineral spas all of that stuff that was around for ages
[2:29:23.460 --> 2:29:29.460]  was all burned and was all shut down so i would say look into fasting the dna force also as well
[2:29:29.460 --> 2:29:34.100]  as the survival shield x2 should be some products i would recommend and you talk about the heavy
[2:29:34.100 --> 2:29:39.060]  metals that attack the brain specifically the pineal gland survival shield x2 is amazing

[2:33:22.340 --> 2:33:29.300]  may he rest in peace apparently he committed suicide after taking a pharmaceutical pill
[2:33:29.300 --> 2:33:37.220]  that says right on the insert suicidal thoughts are a side effect so may chris cornell rest in
[2:33:37.220 --> 2:33:42.100]  peace you'd be amazed at how many kids are committing suicide on anti psychotic drugs
[2:33:42.660 --> 2:33:49.380]  and military for that as well 20 22 to 25 suicides a day it's it's uh so you're they're
[2:33:49.380 --> 2:33:54.260]  giving you an anti psychotic and it's causing you to create this is it look there was a five
[2:33:54.260 --> 2:34:01.220]  year old kid that stabbed his dog to death not too long ago because he was put on anti psychotic
[2:34:01.220 --> 2:34:07.060]  drugs and children are literally hanging themselves in the closets i mean it is sick it is absolutely
[2:34:07.060 --> 2:34:11.860]  sick what's going on out there and that's you know that's what our mission is is to try to help as
[2:34:11.860 --> 2:34:17.460]  many people as we can because it's not that the kids see again they're not addressing the root
[2:34:17.460 --> 2:34:22.980]  cause of the problem it's not that the kid has these mysterious mental illnesses you look at
[2:34:22.980 --> 2:34:28.500]  what causes mental illness i mean aside from ptsd which is obviously uh you know associated with
[2:34:28.500 --> 2:34:37.060]  some traumatic event all these other mental illnesses are a direct relation to your gut
[2:34:37.060 --> 2:34:43.700]  how toxic you are the gmo foods that you're eating the msg the excitotoxins the artificial
[2:34:43.700 --> 2:34:48.740]  colors the artificial sweeteners the vaccinations that the kids are getting i mean it's all linked
[2:34:48.740 --> 2:34:53.700]  you can find all of the documented science and research there so what do the what do the doctors
[2:34:53.700 --> 2:35:00.820]  do oh uh little johnny you're having problems with the anxiety here's a pill that actually contains
[2:35:00.820 --> 2:35:06.020]  50 florida anyway because they use fluoride and all the anti psychotic medication and i might get
[2:35:06.020 --> 2:35:10.660]  a little dumb as you down i might get a little greenbacks for prescribing this to you as well
[2:35:10.660 --> 2:35:15.860]  and prescribing it to little susie and then little peter and then little paul and then little nancy
[2:35:15.860 --> 2:35:19.780]  we're going to get them all on the pill and then little paul pushes his sister down the stairs and
[2:35:19.780 --> 2:35:24.100]  you know or course commits and then needs and then needs even more pills the rest of his life and
[2:35:24.100 --> 2:35:30.260]  in the medical industry is never responsible you know how many deaths such a racket doctor group
[2:35:30.260 --> 2:35:35.220]  there's so many deaths every single year hundreds of thousands of deaths medical mistakes oh more
[2:35:35.220 --> 2:35:40.980]  than heroin more than heroin you have more opioid deaths than heroin and you have more uh
[2:35:41.700 --> 2:35:46.580]  medical malpractice deaths than heroin let me just say one thing if someone out there is addicted
[2:35:46.580 --> 2:35:51.940]  to opioids which is huge uh most likely you're constipated which i would recommend taking oxy
[2:35:51.940 --> 2:35:59.940]  powder but you have to go out i gifted oxy powder to a friend of mine oh the phone calls i got the
[2:35:59.940 --> 2:36:06.580]  next week oh my gosh well what i'm saying is the uh you know i forgot what i was talking about now
[2:36:06.580 --> 2:36:10.100]  because i was thinking about oxy powder but it's you know pharmaceuticals getting into your
[2:36:10.100 --> 2:36:14.340]  pharmaceuticals are getting into your gut they're destroying you and the answer is simple all you
[2:36:14.340 --> 2:36:18.980]  need to do is cleanse your body on a regular basis i know we want to go back to this phone call here
[2:36:18.980 --> 2:36:23.780]  yeah we had uh yeah go ahead i just wanted to let everybody know that today i printed out a
[2:36:23.780 --> 2:36:28.820]  sec of articles to show that we are making a difference and i just wanted to run through
[2:36:28.820 --> 2:36:33.220]  these real fast because we don't hear about all the good things a lot of times we don't hear about
[2:36:33.220 --> 2:36:39.140]  all the positive changes that children and people are making all over the world and so here's a guy
[2:36:39.140 --> 2:36:46.660]  in china because we know china is so infested with smog that is invented a filter to put on
[2:36:46.660 --> 2:36:52.340]  the bicycles so you can see the bicycles right here that on the handlebars he's invented a little
[2:36:52.340 --> 2:36:58.180]  filter so people can drive around the city in smog because the government is not taking action
[2:36:58.180 --> 2:37:04.660]  and the point of this is people just like you just like me just like all the info warriors out there
[2:37:04.660 --> 2:37:10.100]  are actually taking action and saying let's do something to change the world let's do something
[2:37:10.100 --> 2:37:15.540]  to change the city that we live in and let's make a difference in the world so these are air purifiers
[2:37:15.540 --> 2:37:22.580]  the elective pure air purifier info warsore.com here's a kid right here in her name is claire
[2:37:22.580 --> 2:37:27.700]  vlasse she's an eighth grade girl who led a student campaign to raise a hundred and eighteen thousand
[2:37:27.700 --> 2:37:34.500]  dollars so that solar panels can be installed at her middle school i mean these are all individuals
[2:37:34.500 --> 2:37:39.060]  that are making change why didn't that middle school have solar panels you know years and years ago
[2:37:39.940 --> 2:37:45.380]  we have a plastic problem all over the world we have plastic the size of texas an island floating
[2:37:45.380 --> 2:37:51.700]  around in the ocean all of a sudden a guy notices his beehives the wax worms in the beehives he puts
[2:37:51.700 --> 2:37:59.220]  them in a plastic bag and he notices holes in the plastic bag a chance discovery just by chance
[2:37:59.220 --> 2:38:06.100]  revealed that for the first time maybe we can have a solution to our plastic problem and it was right
[2:38:06.100 --> 2:38:13.780]  there with wax worms so these are all things that independent people are doing that are making a
[2:38:13.780 --> 2:38:18.740]  difference in the world right now i think it was an independent inventor too that invented a
[2:38:18.740 --> 2:38:25.460]  you know a surface scraping device on the ocean that can help get some of that oil spills out i
[2:38:25.460 --> 2:38:30.660]  think that that was another independent guy that came out with that right i mean it's the point is
[2:38:30.660 --> 2:38:36.740]  that we are making little little differences and little changes add up to big differences and big
[2:38:36.740 --> 2:38:42.340]  changes and one of the things we've been talking about is the problem with seeds we have medicinal
[2:38:42.340 --> 2:38:49.940]  herbs and plants going extinct every single day and here we have just announced on the 26th today
[2:38:50.900 --> 2:38:58.020]  match.com of seed savings so we have 75 percent of seed varieties have disappeared since the dawn
[2:38:58.020 --> 2:39:04.260]  of the 20th century and the vast majority of what remains now rests in the hands of guess who
[2:39:04.260 --> 2:39:10.260]  monsanto and singento oh good lord so now we have a global seed network it's an online tool for small
[2:39:10.260 --> 2:39:15.540]  growers to share their heirloom heirloom seeds and protect that i've been talking about how
[2:39:15.540 --> 2:39:22.980]  monsanto and singenta and the seed project that bill gates is involved with for years is destroying
[2:39:22.980 --> 2:39:29.620]  our seeds through soil amendments through pesticides through it's a total power grab
[2:39:29.620 --> 2:39:34.580]  that's going on underneath if you control the food and you control the water which is nestly
[2:39:34.580 --> 2:39:38.900]  is trying to do you control everything but we are not we are fighting back and we're making a
[2:39:38.900 --> 2:39:46.740]  difference i do want to give some props though to cheerios they are actually put together a
[2:39:46.740 --> 2:39:51.620]  campaign to try to save the bees talking about bees and and i've always said that the glyphosate
[2:39:51.620 --> 2:39:57.860]  and the pesticides and look if the bees die uh people are saying that we might die now i think
[2:39:57.860 --> 2:40:02.500]  einstein said if the bees die humans have three years till they die yeah i agree because they're
[2:40:02.500 --> 2:40:08.100]  the pollinators but anyway the company announced monday plans to have a hundred million wildflower
[2:40:08.100 --> 2:40:15.860]  seeds planted across the country by offering to send wildflower seeds to people for free so way to go
[2:40:16.820 --> 2:40:20.980]  although the cereal you know i mean they could definitely improve and take some of the toxic
[2:40:20.980 --> 2:40:25.860]  stuff out of the cereal which we are starting to see we were talking about that you know if you go
[2:40:25.860 --> 2:40:31.060]  to your local market or retail store whatever you can start to see these marketing campaigns all
[2:40:31.060 --> 2:40:35.300]  natural removing preservatives all this stuff like well thanks you poisoned me for 10 years now
[2:40:35.300 --> 2:40:39.940]  you're not going to but it is happening it is happening which is great here's another story
[2:40:39.940 --> 2:40:45.140]  totally biodegradable electronics could help solve e-waste problem we have a huge problem with all
[2:40:45.140 --> 2:40:50.500]  this electronic waste yeah people get a new cell phone every two and all this stuff so it's uh this
[2:40:50.500 --> 2:40:55.540]  is a new device that disintegrates in a month by using apple uh apple cider vinegar just regular
[2:40:55.540 --> 2:41:01.860]  vinegar for that matter and water there's 50 million tons of electronics will be discarded this year
[2:41:01.860 --> 2:41:08.580]  alone 50 million tons and most of that stuff is toxic plastics and yeah they don't dispose them
[2:41:08.580 --> 2:41:18.980]  properly that cause disease so those are just pulled up a stack of good news a stack of victories
[2:41:18.980 --> 2:41:23.940]  that have been pulled up just within the last few days that's happened i mean so it's incredible
[2:41:23.940 --> 2:41:28.980]  that people are taking action i just wanted to thank everybody out there because these children
[2:41:28.980 --> 2:41:34.660]  that are taking it upon themselves individuals that are that are seeing the situations that are
[2:41:34.660 --> 2:41:41.220]  causing us to suffer and making positive changes out there and don't think that you can't make a
[2:41:41.220 --> 2:41:47.380]  positive change just everybody not buying the chemicals not buying the the chemical cosmetic
[2:41:47.380 --> 2:41:54.420]  shampoos soaps all the stuff in your house it really does work and it really does make a change
[2:41:54.420 --> 2:42:00.660]  well and the food babe um vani harry has been leading the way i think in exposing the poisons
[2:42:00.660 --> 2:42:04.420]  that are in food and calling these people out forcing them to respond i think subway is a great
[2:42:04.420 --> 2:42:09.940]  example but you know let's also not forget the power of the dollar doctor group and the power of
[2:42:09.940 --> 2:42:17.060]  the free market we the people by spending our money on food products or health products that are
[2:42:17.060 --> 2:42:23.220]  all natural or don't have the poison or with info wars uh people that have similar values and share
[2:42:23.220 --> 2:42:28.020]  the same thoughts and ideas of you that's how we can take the market back as well and when these
[2:42:28.020 --> 2:42:33.700]  companies start to see their products that have uh you know all these preservatives in them or all
[2:42:33.700 --> 2:42:38.500]  these gmo's or completely gmo's they're not selling anymore they're going to stop making them they're
[2:42:38.500 --> 2:42:44.020]  going to stop going to the gmo and um that's also how you can change the market so that is good news
[2:42:44.020 --> 2:42:48.500]  we had uh john who said he had one more question so let's go back to john real quick john what was
[2:42:48.500 --> 2:42:55.060]  your other question uh before we let you go and move on to the next caller well actually it was
[2:42:55.060 --> 2:43:01.300]  uh an idea i got that nobody else seemed to pick up on it yet about the seft rich situation
[2:43:02.100 --> 2:43:11.540]  go ahead and him being in he he was the it manager okay yep he was in control and operated
[2:43:11.540 --> 2:43:19.220]  at all all computer systems yeah he was in charge of the voting the voter rolls yes now there's
[2:43:19.220 --> 2:43:24.020]  one of the guys that are behind the scenes of info wars mentioned that there was a woman that said
[2:43:24.020 --> 2:43:31.540]  that he was gonna release uh yeah that was me yeah that was me mm-hmm but here's the thing though
[2:43:31.540 --> 2:43:37.380]  here's the thing i can't verify that that letter that's why i couldn't really run run with the report
[2:43:37.380 --> 2:43:42.020]  i talked about the letter but i can't verify who that came from so i don't really know if that's
[2:43:42.020 --> 2:43:48.580]  true but obviously the position that set the rich was in with the it department uh specifically in
[2:43:48.580 --> 2:43:54.660]  charge of voter logs yes that was very key especially considering how the democrats uh
[2:43:54.660 --> 2:43:59.940]  stole the election from bernie and the allegation is that and again this is like this is the stuff
[2:43:59.940 --> 2:44:05.220]  where i fall short this is the stuff where i need people who are actually good at breaking down
[2:44:05.220 --> 2:44:11.140]  numbers in the process of this stuff but apparently the democrats were engaging in some shady work with
[2:44:11.140 --> 2:44:18.340]  actually the polls and where you go to vote um and not doing that um particularly right but again
[2:44:18.340 --> 2:44:25.220]  that's somebody who's more educated in how the primaries work how the voter i d logs work and
[2:44:25.220 --> 2:44:29.940]  how they they count these things and call these things i don't fully understand that i can just go
[2:44:29.940 --> 2:44:35.540]  off a letter that was allegedly from seth rich's girlfriend saying that he had proved that the
[2:44:35.540 --> 2:44:42.660]  dnc was rigging the voter rolls to skew the results in hillary's favor but i can't clarify that letter
[2:44:42.660 --> 2:44:47.860]  so there's nothing really more i can report on that thank you for the call john let's go to robert
[2:44:47.860 --> 2:44:57.220]  in california another petition uh caller what's up robert oh and dr grip what an honor so this is
[2:44:57.220 --> 2:45:02.820]  is this robert guys i'm sorry i can't see who's on air right now yes it's robert okay thanks robert
[2:45:02.820 --> 2:45:09.940]  go ahead hey listen i'm in a small pocket here in california just south of prezno i can't get a
[2:45:09.940 --> 2:45:17.300]  petition going and what i wanted to get out to most of the people is that we need petitions we
[2:45:17.300 --> 2:45:23.620]  need to get a petition out to repeal the the patriot act we need a we need a petition so we
[2:45:23.620 --> 2:45:32.100]  can go after these corporations and uh go after them because you know if you go after one
[2:45:32.100 --> 2:45:38.340]  you know they they're so well what corporations are you talking about exactly what corporations
[2:45:38.340 --> 2:45:42.500]  because we can go after corporations by not spending money with them anymore
[2:45:44.420 --> 2:45:49.540]  you know these are also corporations that you have to have because they're they're almost
[2:45:49.540 --> 2:45:58.020]  like a necessity take 18p or so you're talking about commodities and yeah well you know they're
[2:45:58.020 --> 2:46:03.300]  they're able to take your information and spread it around and this is one of the things that we
[2:46:03.300 --> 2:46:10.980]  need so this is an interesting point so it used to be that facebook basically had a monopoly
[2:46:10.980 --> 2:46:16.900]  on getting all the algorithms all the details all the metadata and sharing that donald trump
[2:46:16.900 --> 2:46:22.100]  signed a bill whether you like it or not i suppose perhaps you don't like it but he signed a bill
[2:46:22.100 --> 2:46:30.020]  making it so anybody can do it now for isan at&t all that metadata all that data that when you
[2:46:30.020 --> 2:46:34.740]  check except the terms and conditions you share that's all your data you give it all up to them
[2:46:34.740 --> 2:46:39.780]  so now anybody can have it and anybody can use it so i you know i don't know if the
[2:46:39.780 --> 2:46:43.380]  government is going to be able to step in or do anything about that i would say it's up to the
[2:46:43.380 --> 2:46:50.820]  consumers to kind of dictate that flow again if nobody's using facebook and it's obvious because
[2:46:50.820 --> 2:46:55.300]  they don't like their information being shared guess what facebook is going to stop sharing your
[2:46:55.300 --> 2:47:02.820]  information and bowing at that these guys you know they don't care they get they get the next
[2:47:02.820 --> 2:47:09.620]  new thing going this is what i'm saying you can't hurt them in in their pocketbook because
[2:47:09.620 --> 2:47:16.100]  they're so you've seen the graph where they're all connected you you boycott let's say some
[2:47:16.100 --> 2:47:20.580]  stereo no i i already saw about you know but i'm the government and the continuity of all these
[2:47:21.300 --> 2:47:26.900]  establishment corporations i can guarantee you that over the last 10 years we've put a huge
[2:47:26.900 --> 2:47:32.340]  dent in the pocketbooks because 10 years ago no one even knew what genetically modified foods are
[2:47:32.340 --> 2:47:40.020]  we had march against monsanto now because there's so many foods that have that non-gmo seal on it
[2:47:40.020 --> 2:47:46.420]  and because it's public knowledge right now you have the big corporations that look they
[2:47:46.420 --> 2:47:51.620]  ridiculed organic foods i mean for years when whole foods came out it was the only organic
[2:47:51.620 --> 2:47:57.540]  store where you could get organic food now you can find organic food in the airport i mean i can go
[2:47:57.540 --> 2:48:01.940]  in the airport and go to any of the stores in there and find organic stuff to eat you can find
[2:48:01.940 --> 2:48:07.940]  it everywhere so at first they they they push up against it and they and they ridicule it and they
[2:48:07.940 --> 2:48:15.860]  say no no no no no but when it starts hurting their pocket and the money starts leaving them
[2:48:15.860 --> 2:48:21.060]  and going to organic then they make the change and it's not seen that in big companies and you've
[2:48:21.060 --> 2:48:25.380]  seen that across the board so we are making a difference i can tell you that because i'm right
[2:48:25.380 --> 2:48:30.500]  in that every single day it's not an overnight process you know this is a very huge entrenched
[2:48:30.500 --> 2:48:34.820]  establishment that we'll have to chip away at so so and doctor group had the stories there are
[2:48:34.820 --> 2:48:39.140]  victories that are happening thank you for the call kg let's squeeze or i'm sorry that was robert
[2:48:39.140 --> 2:48:46.900]  let's squeeze in kg real quick before the break from arizona go ahead kg how's it going guys good
[2:48:46.900 --> 2:48:53.300]  um i just wanted to say it i just think it's hilarious well not funny but it's just ironic that
[2:48:53.300 --> 2:49:02.260]  the day after that bombing in the uk who comes on but the talking point for operation mocking
[2:49:02.260 --> 2:49:10.260]  work bird and john brennan that's gum yeah john brennan who wouldn't even do his oath on the bible
[2:49:11.380 --> 2:49:16.420]  he's a little hobbyist treasonous scum he works for he's a piece of trash
[2:49:17.620 --> 2:49:21.300]  yeah he he lies all the time about intelligence why would i trust john brennan
[2:49:21.300 --> 2:49:26.260]  so why isn't there an investigation on brennan you know what i mean it's like and that has to be
[2:49:26.260 --> 2:49:31.620]  the most frustrating thing doctor group you know i mean look i'm i'm just i am a reporter for info
[2:49:31.620 --> 2:49:39.700]  wars dot com okay i don't have any secret clearance i don't i don't hack into anything okay i am living
[2:49:39.700 --> 2:49:46.740]  on the same playing field of reality as everybody else and i can see john brennan is a known liar i
[2:49:46.740 --> 2:49:51.780]  can see john brennan shouldn't be trusted and i guess that's what the caller is voicing the frustration
[2:49:51.780 --> 2:49:59.940]  how is it he gets to continue to be hoisted up here as some voice of authority i mean it's clinton
[2:49:59.940 --> 2:50:05.700]  it's obama it's washerman schultz it's the democrats i mean it's non-stop how badly do the democrats
[2:50:05.700 --> 2:50:10.980]  have to be exposed via wiki leaks and project veritas yeah how bad what may schumer the the
[2:50:10.980 --> 2:50:16.020]  deleting expert on all this stuff what if you ask your questions if you walked into a deli and saw
[2:50:16.020 --> 2:50:23.380]  chuck schumer slice and pastrami what would you do get out of the deli everybody says the same
[2:50:23.380 --> 2:50:27.300]  thing chuck schumer who know you wouldn't you wouldn't buy a pastrami sandwich from the guy
[2:50:28.020 --> 2:50:34.260]  no no i mean i you know i hope people can see through i mean i think they're all of this and
[2:50:34.980 --> 2:50:39.220]  i i wish there was a way that you could just do an executive order and just get rid of them but
[2:50:39.220 --> 2:50:46.820]  but uh obviously that wouldn't go down too well you know we wanted trump to get in and be a wrecking
[2:50:46.820 --> 2:50:53.940]  ball he hasn't been in for a year yet so he's got plenty of time but um let's go president trump

[2:55:34.100 --> 2:55:39.220]  side of this hour we talked about the dnc lawsuit you were asking about this so basically what's
[2:55:39.220 --> 2:55:44.660]  going on is you have bernie sort bernie bernie sanders supporters in 45 states that have filed
[2:55:44.660 --> 2:55:50.820]  a lawsuit that they want to be repaid by the dnc for the funds that they gave for bernie
[2:55:50.820 --> 2:55:55.860]  spanner bernie sanders campaign to the dnc of course the dnc rigged it for hillary basically
[2:55:55.860 --> 2:56:00.980]  cheated so the bernie sanders supporters feel cheated and they would like their money back so
[2:56:00.980 --> 2:56:08.180]  uh the dnc is being sued right now class action lawsuit 45 states involved but of course the
[2:56:08.180 --> 2:56:14.180]  washington post the washington compost says that it's frivolous no it's frivolous to sue somebody
[2:56:14.180 --> 2:56:20.980]  that stole your money and lied about an election result no what's frivolous is to steal money and
[2:56:20.980 --> 2:56:29.540]  lie about an election and make it a selection and of course here's the irony meanwhile the democrats
[2:56:29.540 --> 2:56:37.780]  are so messed up dr group meanwhile the fbi is investigating bernie sanders wife so you've got
[2:56:37.780 --> 2:56:44.020]  the dnc that's being sued by bernie sanders supporters because they rigged the election for
[2:56:44.020 --> 2:56:49.700]  hillary so the dnc is getting sued by bernie sanders supporters meanwhile bernie bernie sanders
[2:56:49.700 --> 2:56:57.460]  supporters were duped themselves by the sanders so bernie sanders supporters got duped by the dnc
[2:56:57.460 --> 2:57:01.860]  and they also got duped by the sanders bernie sanders they've got multiple houses multiple cars
[2:57:01.860 --> 2:57:07.300]  claims to be some sort of bleeding heart liberal totally a fraud and then bernie sanders wife making
[2:57:07.300 --> 2:57:13.140]  sketchy land deals sketching sketchy uh she's being looked at for bank fraud right now and guess
[2:57:13.140 --> 2:57:19.460]  what the college that james sanders was running burlington college out of business so now you've
[2:57:19.460 --> 2:57:24.260]  got the dnc being looked at because of lawsuits by bernie sanders supporters meanwhile bernie
[2:57:24.260 --> 2:57:29.460]  sanders wife is being investigated for potential uh bank fraud and land deals so that's nice democrats
[2:57:29.460 --> 2:57:36.500]  are totally in disarray and it just adds to it this is from the daily caller poll split between
[2:57:36.500 --> 2:57:41.700]  democrats and the rest of country on trump russia narrative representative elisha comings there is an
[2:57:41.700 --> 2:57:47.860]  air of deception going on with white house and russia investigation yeah elisha you've been
[2:57:47.860 --> 2:57:57.540]  deceived bro it wasn't russia that leaked the emails it came from inside and the air of deception
[2:57:57.540 --> 2:58:02.660]  is the mainstream media and the deep state trying to distract from the fact that hillary clinton and
[2:58:02.660 --> 2:58:08.100]  john pedesta had russia collusion and that they were trying to steal the election the whole thing
[2:58:08.100 --> 2:58:12.660]  was set up for hillary clinton to win it was a rig job from the beginning trump came in with the
[2:58:12.660 --> 2:58:18.820]  deplorables and defeated it so all they're doing is blaming russia to try to delegitimize donald trump
[2:58:18.820 --> 2:58:25.060]  and to try to reaffirm themselves as a credible news source even though they were wrong the whole
[2:58:25.060 --> 2:58:31.860]  time and they're wrong about russia too the democrats are in total disarray right now the
[2:58:31.860 --> 2:58:37.060]  left is a complete mess we've got more of your calls for dr group and then roger stone on the other
[2:58:37.060 --> 2:58:45.700]  side thank you for listening to gcn visit gcn live com today
[2:58:50.100 --> 2:58:54.660]  dot a group you develop living defense for us it took you over a year to do it why is this so good
[2:58:54.660 --> 2:59:00.580]  because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most i mean i try
[2:59:00.580 --> 2:59:06.420]  to make sure that i don't put tops in some food and water and beverages in my system but right now
[2:59:06.420 --> 2:59:12.180]  we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives
[2:59:12.180 --> 2:59:17.540]  off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees uh spreading disease around we have
[2:59:17.540 --> 2:59:22.020]  biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about all the stuff
[2:59:22.020 --> 2:59:25.700]  that said there's so many things that are in it you have the name in there you have the organic
[2:59:25.700 --> 2:59:31.540]  clove bud the organic wormwood i recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right
[2:59:31.540 --> 2:59:34.980]  well i'm glad we've got some back in because i'm going back on it today it just came back in
[2:59:34.980 --> 2:59:39.300]  yesterday living defense info warslife.com and folks you can't lose it's full of stuff that's
[2:59:39.300 --> 2:59:44.980]  great for your body period and uh you support the broadcast info warslife.com thank you doctor
[2:59:44.980 --> 2:59:48.660]  group from the global healing center thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product
[2:59:48.660 --> 3:00:04.580]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:04.580 --> 3:00:24.820]  we are waiting to get roger stone on board in the meantime in the break
[3:00:24.820 --> 3:00:29.460]  dr group had asked me we were talking about the left pushing for impeachment he was saying yeah
[3:00:29.460 --> 3:00:33.540]  they're clearly mad oh do you really think they'll go for impeachment and then he asked me what do i
[3:00:33.540 --> 3:00:37.380]  think is going to happen the next 60 days i don't think it's necessarily 60 days i think the time
[3:00:37.380 --> 3:00:44.500]  frame that i'm looking at right now is the 2018 midterm elections basically i think that they either
[3:00:44.500 --> 3:00:54.180]  have a plan in place to impeach trump or they don't understand the epic loss they're going to take in
[3:00:54.180 --> 3:00:59.220]  2018 because nobody's buying this anymore so i do think they're going to continue with impeach impeach
[3:00:59.220 --> 3:01:05.220]  impeach at least to try to delegitimize him as president um but if they don't do anything by
[3:01:05.220 --> 3:01:10.420]  2018 they're done what do you think they know that what are the positive changes you see happening
[3:01:10.420 --> 3:01:14.980]  in the next let's say six months i think the 2018 midterm elections are going to be great
[3:01:14.980 --> 3:01:19.780]  for the american people i think that people are more concerned about politics now they're more
[3:01:19.780 --> 3:01:24.980]  engaged they're paying attention to these people uh you've got people that are now actually fired up
[3:01:24.980 --> 3:01:29.380]  to run against some of the swamp creatures like maxine waters who's going uh going to be going
[3:01:29.380 --> 3:01:36.180]  against oman avaro who's doing great work you've got shiva a real indian actually an indian from
[3:01:36.180 --> 3:01:41.940]  india in asia uh going against max or going against elizabeth warren a fake indian these are people
[3:01:41.940 --> 3:01:45.700]  who want to make america great again these are people who care about the american people and
[3:01:45.700 --> 3:01:51.140]  the districts they represent not just their own pocketbook so i think 2018 midterms elections
[3:01:51.140 --> 3:01:55.700]  are going to be great and either the democrats are so disillusioned they don't understand the
[3:01:55.700 --> 3:01:59.860]  epic loss they're going to suffer there or they really think that they can get trump out of office
[3:01:59.860 --> 3:02:05.700]  before that and then on go with the deep state globalist agenda that's what i think sounds good
[3:02:05.700 --> 3:02:11.060]  do you think that we'll have a ramification of the tax bill or health care happening this year
[3:02:11.060 --> 3:02:15.940]  they keep putting the tax bill off all of the victory laps that they took for the health care
[3:02:15.940 --> 3:02:20.340]  bill in the house is going to look foolish once it fails in the senate that's what i think you're
[3:02:20.340 --> 3:02:24.020]  ready to take a couple calls let's do it let's go to shon who's got a health question for dr group
[3:02:24.020 --> 3:02:30.660]  go ahead shon yes um before i get started i just want to let you guys know from here you will
[3:02:30.660 --> 3:02:37.620]  witness the final destruction of the empire and then end to the final rebellion the force
[3:02:41.620 --> 3:02:46.900]  yeah you guys might also know me as a humanity on planet earth but um that's for another time
[3:02:46.900 --> 3:02:52.740]  i'm right now i'm actually looking into um i'm auto didactic so i don't really go chasing around
[3:02:52.740 --> 3:02:58.900]  the paperwork from harvard and um all the other institutions i'm a big fan of marquette peseo
[3:02:58.900 --> 3:03:03.380]  who actually got turned on from you guys which is acronym if you break his name down comes out to
[3:03:03.380 --> 3:03:08.260]  map i call mr map because he really brought me to another level on a documentary called um
[3:03:08.900 --> 3:03:13.860]  christians no jesus was an anarchist and christians are statists you guys got to check that out
[3:03:13.860 --> 3:03:18.740]  it was really deep but anyway for dr group i have these fists on my neck and i'm looking to heal
[3:03:18.740 --> 3:03:24.180]  myself and i'm looking to uh into gcm af which i understand uh some doctors might have been
[3:03:24.180 --> 3:03:28.020]  getting murdered over and it's very hard to get here in the states and i was going to
[3:03:28.020 --> 3:03:33.540]  combine that with ozone therapy what are your thoughts on that well gcm af has been under attack
[3:03:33.540 --> 3:03:38.740]  now for probably about four or five years uh it was incredibly what is that i'm not i'm not it's
[3:03:38.740 --> 3:03:44.420]  the nagolas it's it's actually it works with the nagolas enzyme in the body and it's it's a way to
[3:03:44.420 --> 3:03:53.460]  regenerate and block any type of really it was focusing on cancer cells um it kind of shut that
[3:03:53.460 --> 3:03:58.340]  down that's a trillion nagolas is an enzyme that's being restricted in the body and gcm af actually
[3:03:58.340 --> 3:04:03.060]  turns on the nagolas enzyme and they found that the nagolas enzyme has very healing properties
[3:04:03.060 --> 3:04:08.340]  and actually prevents and heals tissue damaged tissue in the body whenever it whenever the
[3:04:08.340 --> 3:04:14.340]  body recognizes that there's been many doctors that have allegedly been killed because of their
[3:04:14.340 --> 3:04:21.300]  work with gcm af it's like the beginning of time when uh all of these cancer cures these natural

[3:05:36.340 --> 3:05:43.300]  into these emails meanwhile evidence continues to surface that seth rich did in fact have contact
[3:05:43.300 --> 3:05:50.340]  with wiki leaks before he was murdered seth rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and

[3:09:48.420 --> 3:09:56.340]  leftists attacked me not understanding that it was a fashion homage to bobby seal to ui newton to the
[3:09:56.340 --> 3:10:02.580]  panthers i didn't like their ideology but these guys looked great uh you see the problem with the
[3:10:02.580 --> 3:10:10.180]  left is they have no sense of style as well as no uh belief in america there we go you see wait a
[3:10:10.180 --> 3:10:16.420]  second yeah wait whoa whoa i've seen roger i've seen chunk yogurt i've seen chunk yogurt hosting

[3:10:46.980 --> 3:10:53.620]  doctor uh you know if i do a remake of back to the future he is the guy to kind of play that part
[3:10:54.500 --> 3:11:00.340]  and you guys are bringing unbelievable products to the info wars store i mean as you know
[3:11:00.340 --> 3:11:08.100]  brain force for me uh is almost a requirement given the high pace of beating back the senate
[3:11:08.100 --> 3:11:15.940]  and house intelligence committees in my demand to testify uh a keeping track of the seth rich
[3:11:15.940 --> 3:11:21.940]  murder probe which we're going to talk about uh a little later um uh following uh the president's
[3:11:21.940 --> 3:11:30.100]  trip nine days abroad that troubles me some nine days is a long time for the president to be out
[3:11:30.100 --> 3:11:37.140]  of washington uh but the stage craft i think has been generally good with a few problems we'll talk
[3:11:37.140 --> 3:11:44.420]  about what interests me is uh the poland continues to show real intensity and support for those who
[3:11:44.420 --> 3:11:50.740]  back the president see they're not buying the mainstream media take down something they couldn't
[3:11:50.740 --> 3:11:58.100]  achieve in the at the ballot box but they now seek to achieve through a deep state coup a collusion
[3:11:58.100 --> 3:12:06.020]  indeed between the mainstream media and the left wing of the democratic party roger you know i actually
[3:12:06.020 --> 3:12:11.460]  have a question for you there is talks right now about the obviously the leakers from the
[3:12:11.460 --> 3:12:16.100]  white house is a very real situation right now i think that everybody's kind of recognize that
[3:12:16.100 --> 3:12:21.220]  the leaks magically stopped uh as soon as trump took off right after the new york times and the
[3:12:21.220 --> 3:12:25.620]  washington compost published their smear pieces right after donald trump took off but then the
[3:12:25.620 --> 3:12:31.860]  league stopped now there's rumors that once trump gets back to america that some of these leakers
[3:12:31.860 --> 3:12:37.780]  have been identified and maybe on the way out do you have any intel on that well it is interesting
[3:12:37.780 --> 3:12:44.020]  that the leaking stopped when the president went abroad because of course uh perhaps the leakers were
[3:12:44.020 --> 3:12:51.060]  in the entourage perhaps those leakers are now back in washington we're we don't know for certain
[3:12:52.020 --> 3:12:57.700]  on the other hand there has been speculation in the newspapers that the president would bring in
[3:12:57.700 --> 3:13:05.860]  kori luandowski and david bossy uh as latter day plumbers guys in charge of finding the leaks
[3:13:06.580 --> 3:13:10.980]  this is a terrible idea first i don't think either one of them could find their
[3:13:11.540 --> 3:13:16.820]  arse with both hands as of our friend paul joseph lottson might say but secondarily
[3:13:17.380 --> 3:13:23.380]  they have they're not attorneys they have no law enforcement experience this reminds me of g gordon
[3:13:23.380 --> 3:13:29.300]  lady and e howard hunt these guys will end up in jail if the president wants to find the leakers
[3:13:29.860 --> 3:13:36.100]  do what linden johnson did rather than richard nixon a port a point a strong independent law
[3:13:36.100 --> 3:13:42.580]  enforcement man or woman to head the fbi someone like ray kelly the former new york police commissioner
[3:13:42.580 --> 3:13:50.980]  or someone like judge janine piero and do this legally uh the there's awesome investigative powers
[3:13:50.980 --> 3:13:56.980]  in the justice department and the fbi law has been violated here you see the difference between
[3:13:56.980 --> 3:14:02.500]  watergate and what we see going on with donald trump is there's no crime watergate began with a
[3:14:02.500 --> 3:14:09.380]  break in no one has yet proved the crime of russian collusion if that is even a crime brother
[3:14:09.380 --> 3:14:15.540]  dirshowitz says it is not so what we're seeing here is an orchestrated takedown uh and oh and i you
[3:14:15.540 --> 3:14:21.220]  have talked about this ad nauseam and i salute you for it yeah honestly it's it's getting i'm
[3:14:21.220 --> 3:14:24.740]  getting sick of it to be honest and i was talking about today i can't even imagine if you're donald
[3:14:24.740 --> 3:14:29.940]  trump a businessman who's worried about the bottom line your handcuffed you can't stop this witch hunt
[3:14:29.940 --> 3:14:35.940]  that's wasting taxpayer dollars wasting resources wasting time because your handcuffed if you do that
[3:14:35.940 --> 3:14:39.620]  they're gonna claim you're a russian agent so they handcuffed him there but you know you just
[3:14:39.620 --> 3:14:45.220]  mentioned uh the new fbi director who i'm sure is going to be announced sometime soon we don't know yet
[3:14:45.220 --> 3:14:49.700]  but it is a very important hiring i think for president trump because if he gets the right
[3:14:49.700 --> 3:14:55.860]  person in there who gets work done and actually wants to drain the swamp i think that that gives
[3:14:55.860 --> 3:15:01.220]  president trump a lot more operating room to get his agenda uh going without all of these
[3:15:01.220 --> 3:15:07.300]  false narratives being put out but i'm just curious was joe Lieberman ever really being
[3:15:07.300 --> 3:15:13.860]  considered for this job uh let's hope not i mean look i'm from connecticut joe Lieberman is a good
[3:15:13.860 --> 3:15:19.220]  friend of mine we don't agree on much other than the fact that he was a better u.s senator
[3:15:19.860 --> 3:15:27.380]  than lowell p wiker jr a republican better a snake in the grass than an asp in the bosom
[3:15:27.380 --> 3:15:32.660]  although that's unfair to joe Lieberman who i do agree with on some issues but his closeness to
[3:15:32.660 --> 3:15:37.780]  senator john mccain and the fact that he's a rock rib member of the washington establishment
[3:15:37.780 --> 3:15:45.060]  uh the two-party system that has brought this country to its knees the president needs someone
[3:15:45.060 --> 3:15:52.340]  who is not a neocon uh not uh not political someone who will restore confidence the new york
[3:15:52.340 --> 3:15:58.740]  times keeps reporting that the morale at the fbi is low they cite no sources because it's false
[3:15:59.300 --> 3:16:05.220]  i've talked to dozens of agents who believe that james comey politicized the agency there was no
[3:16:05.220 --> 3:16:14.260]  rhyme or reason to many of his stranger decisions he declined to pursue the obvious crimes of the
[3:16:14.260 --> 3:16:21.220]  clinton's uh so i agree with you this will be a pivotal decision uh i should mention because we're
[3:16:21.220 --> 3:16:27.460]  kind of under some kind of cyber attack here i'm relegated to the cell phone but i would be remiss
[3:16:27.460 --> 3:16:34.420]  if i didn't mention uh the president's trip i was very unhappy with the imagery of our president
[3:16:34.420 --> 3:16:41.540]  bowing down to get a medal from the saudi king you see president trump is a very tall man and
[3:16:41.540 --> 3:16:50.980]  he's broad-shouldered and the much i but i blame the handlers i believe those in charge of stagecraft
[3:16:50.980 --> 3:16:57.300]  i blame rank's previous for putting the president in a position to have a photo that the muslim world
[3:16:57.300 --> 3:17:06.420]  can now use as some kind of propaganda put the king on a riser if necessary it's advanced man
[3:17:06.420 --> 3:17:14.900]  101 i think that the the president's staff has dis-served him i note to you that he did not
[3:17:14.900 --> 3:17:22.420]  bow to the saudi's when he was first introduced to them uh he did not refrain from calling
[3:17:22.420 --> 3:17:30.500]  islamic terrorism what it is in his remarks in front of his saudi hosts uh and many americans
[3:17:30.500 --> 3:17:39.780]  myself included realize that a nuclear iran is a problem for both of our nations uh and while the
[3:17:39.780 --> 3:17:48.100]  saudi's did uh do play a double game and they did uh finance the attack on america we will have
[3:17:48.100 --> 3:17:54.420]  to bring them to account but first we must take care of the threat of nuclear annihilation
[3:17:54.420 --> 3:18:01.220]  from a bunch of lunatics uh in iran yeah and i wish that tray gowdy was um willing to take the
[3:18:01.220 --> 3:18:06.420]  fbi director position apparently he's not for the reasons of the way he just grills other
[3:18:06.420 --> 3:18:11.620]  politicians like the way he grilled brennan last week um but you know it's interesting i think that
[3:18:11.620 --> 3:18:16.420]  the reason why trump went on this trip was to prove he wasn't an isolationist and that he's
[3:18:16.420 --> 3:18:21.780]  willing to take his message abroad which i think that he did actually get those two things done
[3:18:21.780 --> 3:18:25.060]  but dr group actually had a question for me and i'd like to hear your opinion on this
[3:18:25.780 --> 3:18:29.540]  do the democrats really think that they can impeach donald trump
[3:18:31.220 --> 3:18:38.820]  well i think that there is a subset of the far left democrats abetted by their uh
[3:18:38.820 --> 3:18:45.620]  their compatriots in the mainstream media you know in the next segment i expect to talk extensively
[3:18:45.620 --> 3:18:52.180]  about the many comparisons of what happened to president uh richard nixon who was in fact taken
[3:18:52.180 --> 3:18:59.540]  down in a similar coup for similar reasons nixon was committed to peace peace in vietnam peace with
[3:18:59.540 --> 3:19:05.860]  the russians peace with the chinese he he caught a strategic deal for the uh limitation nuclear
[3:19:05.860 --> 3:19:12.260]  warheads opened the door to china and the deep state was deeply opposed now donald trump stands up
[3:19:12.260 --> 3:19:19.140]  for detente and peace with the russians rather than war over syria and we attack his patriotism
[3:19:19.140 --> 3:19:26.740]  and scream for impeachment what we'll get it we'll get into that in the meantime uh patriots i just

[3:24:25.140 --> 3:24:30.260]  welcome back to the alex joneshow olyn shroyer here momentarily uh as we're about to be joined
[3:24:30.260 --> 3:24:34.900]  again by roger stone he's got more breaking news but this is just breaking right now
[3:24:34.900 --> 3:24:41.940]  manchester bomber salman abedi's father and brother have been arrested and linked to isis
[3:24:42.500 --> 3:24:50.420]  and al-qaeda okay so a pattern is forming here let's recall that the manchester bomb
[3:24:50.420 --> 3:24:59.460]  uh traveled to libya um before this happened and let's recall that we had multiple warnings
[3:24:59.460 --> 3:25:07.700]  from people and he was known to authorities in england that he was indeed behaving strangely
[3:25:07.700 --> 3:25:13.940]  and may possibly do something like blow up a bunch of kids at an ariana grande concert
[3:25:13.940 --> 3:25:18.260]  so now his fathers and brothers have been arrested and linked to isis and al-qaeda
[3:25:18.260 --> 3:25:26.500]  so my question now is and i'll bring this to roger stone are the people in england and europe
[3:25:26.500 --> 3:25:31.140]  finally fed up are they finally willing to do something roger are they finally willing to
[3:25:31.140 --> 3:25:37.540]  put aside political correctness and do something to protect their homeland well i think the people
[3:25:37.540 --> 3:25:43.460]  are more than ready oh and the question is not the people the question is the elitist global
[3:25:43.460 --> 3:25:51.380]  leadership globalist leadership of a number of those nations i had uh dinner last night with
[3:25:51.380 --> 3:25:58.660]  tony fabrizio probably the four most republican pollster in the country he recently returned
[3:25:58.660 --> 3:26:07.060]  from france where he was working with uh madame le pen and the mainstream media there like here
[3:26:07.620 --> 3:26:14.500]  seeks to suppress popular popular sentiment but i think in germany in france in belgium
[3:26:14.500 --> 3:26:23.700]  the people are tired of swarms of arabic youths pillaging raping assaulting bombing
[3:26:24.660 --> 3:26:31.540]  stealing defecating in public fountains destroying public property turning over and burning police
[3:26:31.540 --> 3:26:40.100]  cars taking taxpayer dollars uh and uh it is uh it is what is driving the reform across the country
[3:26:40.100 --> 3:26:46.820]  it is what elected donald trump it is what scored in the uh the referendum in italy not long ago it
[3:26:46.820 --> 3:26:55.860]  is what gave us brexit it is uh it would have won france but for uh a uh problems that i think
[3:26:55.860 --> 3:27:02.340]  relate to the fact that the majority of french voters disagreed with the candidate who won
[3:27:02.340 --> 3:27:10.260]  the majority of french voters by large margins agreed with le pen but she was stigmatized and
[3:27:10.260 --> 3:27:17.700]  the connection to her father who she is not but who retains very high negatives i think
[3:27:18.260 --> 3:27:26.900]  cost us that race cost the the forces of freedom that race well i pray for the french people
[3:27:26.900 --> 3:27:32.820]  that is such an excellent point roger and it can be proven because look we see people do this on
[3:27:32.820 --> 3:27:38.980]  the streets of america you walk up to a trump hater or or a liberal and you tell them all of
[3:27:38.980 --> 3:27:44.660]  trump's policies but you just say them you know kind of in passing or just in general or say hey
[3:27:44.660 --> 3:27:49.860]  these are clinton's policies but you say trump's policies they agree with all of them but it's the
[3:27:49.860 --> 3:27:57.300]  stigmatism roger it's the exact same uh phenomena that we have seen well uh oh and i i want to talk
[3:27:57.300 --> 3:28:02.340]  about what i think is developing is the most interesting congressional race perhaps in the
[3:28:02.340 --> 3:28:11.620]  country debora waserman schultz right here in florida caught red-handed stealing the democratic
[3:28:11.620 --> 3:28:18.500]  nomination from bernie sanders busted by the people at wiki leaks the journalists at wiki
[3:28:18.500 --> 3:28:26.420]  leaks fired published this sorted tale now four years ago tim canova a bernie sanders supporter
[3:28:26.980 --> 3:28:33.940]  challenged her in the democratic primary uh and he raised a significant amount from the grass roots
[3:28:34.980 --> 3:28:42.100]  to finish with a very strong 43 percent in the end waserman schultz was able to win
[3:28:42.100 --> 3:28:49.220]  because she held on to the so-called kondo commandos who deliver a very large and essentially
[3:28:49.220 --> 3:28:57.780]  bossed senior citizen vote of older voters uh she won among jewish voters catholic democrats
[3:28:57.780 --> 3:29:05.620]  while her opponent won among progressives liberals people of color mr canova has indicated that he
[3:29:05.620 --> 3:29:15.220]  will have a rematch now carla spaulding uh a Haitian a registered nurse a woman of great
[3:29:15.220 --> 3:29:23.060]  character has emerged to seek the republican nomination in this district uh and on june 10th
[3:29:23.060 --> 3:29:35.300]  she headlines a rally outside uh the local affiliate uh channel 10 uh a non-censorship rally so this
[3:29:35.300 --> 3:29:41.940]  is a race to watch we're going to be following it very closely here at info wars because jebara
[3:29:41.940 --> 3:29:52.100]  waserman schultz deserves the challenge he's about to get we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:29:52.980 --> 3:29:55.860]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:01.060 --> 3:30:09.460]  box news has a new television host and she wants you to stop spreading conspiracy theories about
[3:30:09.460 --> 3:30:15.700]  seith rich let the rich family get the closure that they need properly and not with your crazy
[3:30:15.700 --> 3:30:21.380]  conspiracy theories on the internet save them for bigfoot in the post roger ailes era of the
[3:30:21.380 --> 3:30:28.820]  fox news network liberal democrat host julie roginski went after seith rich conspiracy theories
[3:30:28.820 --> 3:30:33.220]  listen wiki leaks was in collaboration with the russians how do we know this because the entire
[3:30:33.220 --> 3:30:37.380]  intelligence community said that the russians were the ones that hacked into these emails
[3:30:37.380 --> 3:30:44.340]  meanwhile evidence continues to surface that seith rich did in fact have contact with wiki leaks
[3:30:44.340 --> 3:30:51.620]  before he was murdered seith rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and suicide victims
[3:30:51.620 --> 3:30:57.620]  with close ties to the clinton crime family i'm darin Mcbrane and you can learn more right now

[3:32:10.260 --> 3:32:15.940]  today fight their hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice that's what this holiday

[3:33:10.100 --> 3:33:24.580]  this transmission you are the resistance and now your host roger stone well as kerry grant might say
[3:33:25.300 --> 3:33:37.220]  julie julie julie ruganski wrong you see we do respect seth rich's parents request for privacy
[3:33:37.220 --> 3:33:46.660]  privacy is very important but truth is more important now i let me say several things about
[3:33:46.660 --> 3:33:54.820]  the seth rich matter that need to be said many of you know the topic of seth rich has turned
[3:33:54.820 --> 3:34:01.940]  radioactive almost overnight the amount of energy being expended by the left to bury this issue
[3:34:01.940 --> 3:34:10.500]  and to end any questions and to try to chop off the legs of anyone associated with it is obvious
[3:34:11.300 --> 3:34:19.540]  suddenly the topic is supposed to be off limits now there is a good bit of information out here
[3:34:19.540 --> 3:34:29.220]  that is disinformation a email of john podesta where he is quoted as saying let's make an example
[3:34:29.220 --> 3:34:38.500]  of the leaker and relating that to seth rich is a trap in my opinion because that email was addressed
[3:34:38.500 --> 3:34:47.140]  at a much different time to joel benison and robbie mooke back in february of uh uh in 2015
[3:34:48.500 --> 3:34:55.540]  it had to do with potential members of the hillary campaign in the finance department
[3:34:55.540 --> 3:35:05.060]  who were quoted in the press uh this i think was used to discredit uh certain critics on the seth
[3:35:05.060 --> 3:35:15.460]  rich question uh i don't base my suspicions about seth rich on this email the important thing to
[3:35:15.460 --> 3:35:26.180]  remember is this mr rich headed a division of the dnc he was not a low-level it employee he
[3:35:26.180 --> 3:35:33.860]  was in charge of the division from which documents very clearly were perloined or hacked or turned
[3:35:33.860 --> 3:35:44.020]  over and showed up on wiki leaks none of the accuracy or the authenticity of those documents
[3:35:44.020 --> 3:35:50.900]  has been challenged by the mainstream media when we learned that the dc metropolitan police did not
[3:35:51.540 --> 3:36:00.260]  question the bartender or any of the employees in the establishment where mr rich was last seen
[3:36:00.260 --> 3:36:08.420]  when we learned that they did not request the security camera footage when we learned that
[3:36:08.420 --> 3:36:18.900]  a dnc crisis manager and fixer is now i believe still working for the rich family when the washington
[3:36:18.900 --> 3:36:26.740]  post the official house organ of the central intelligence agency the voice of the two-party
[3:36:26.740 --> 3:36:35.300]  duopoly of neo cons that have taken this country down the crapper tells us that we can't question
[3:36:35.300 --> 3:36:42.340]  what happened out of respect for the family's privacy well as i said earlier as much as i
[3:36:42.340 --> 3:36:51.380]  have sympathy for anyone over the loss of their son the truth and where it leads is a key question
[3:36:52.180 --> 3:36:59.780]  mr bowman who is representing the parents according to some uh is an unwanted interloper
[3:36:59.780 --> 3:37:07.700]  while others believe that he is uh assigned to handle the rich family bowman is a professional
[3:37:07.700 --> 3:37:15.540]  democratic crisis public relations consultant in washington dc and has been a frequent critic
[3:37:15.540 --> 3:37:23.700]  of donald trump well well it is interesting that the dnc has taken a little public action
[3:37:23.700 --> 3:37:30.420]  in trying to track down mr rich's killer but now suddenly they're committing to stopping and
[3:37:31.380 --> 3:37:38.500]  dedicating resources to the cover-up and attempts to make this story go away and while
[3:37:38.500 --> 3:37:45.860]  calls from sas family for respect should be heeded it is also safe to say that his family
[3:37:45.860 --> 3:37:53.060]  above all should want to know what happened on that fateful night when he was murdered
[3:37:53.060 --> 3:38:01.300]  taking three in the back it is only natural for his family to want to know what really happened
[3:38:03.140 --> 3:38:12.580]  we are in a situation in which kim dot com put forward a nothing burger now uh a founder of mega
[3:38:12.580 --> 3:38:20.580]  uploads a notorious hacker uh with a website famous for distributing uh pirated versions
[3:38:20.580 --> 3:38:28.660]  of copyright works in 2012 the federal government in tandem with several other agencies of international
[3:38:28.660 --> 3:38:37.700]  law enforcement raided mr dot com in new zealand where he had been living uh arrested him and seized
[3:38:37.700 --> 3:38:45.540]  all of his assets since then uh kim dot com has been fighting extradition to the us and just this
[3:38:45.540 --> 3:38:54.180]  past february he lost his last new zealand appeal he's now being processed for extradition it is
[3:38:54.180 --> 3:39:01.700]  entirely possible that kim did not do himself any favors by injecting himself into the seth rich
[3:39:01.700 --> 3:39:09.780]  narrative and debate sadly he has offered no new revelations backed by substantial proof last week
[3:39:09.780 --> 3:39:17.540]  and over the weekend he sadly revealed he has nothing of substance to add to the vital search
[3:39:17.540 --> 3:39:24.900]  for who murdered seth rich except for some secret information that he now says he will
[3:39:24.900 --> 3:39:34.660]  only provide to the uh to the fbi director new former fbi director new special counsel mr muller
[3:39:34.660 --> 3:39:43.940]  in exchange for immunity and save passage from new zealand to the usa and back i fear that this
[3:39:43.940 --> 3:39:52.180]  was a ploy to get another chance at fighting his case here in the united states while a free man
[3:39:52.180 --> 3:40:02.820]  living the high life and not in a federal prison cell i was sorry to see sean hannity uh and others
[3:40:02.820 --> 3:40:14.420]  in the alternative media community buy into what was most likely a ploy which had the net effect
[3:40:14.420 --> 3:40:23.300]  of distracting the american people from the inexorable need to know whether seth rich was
[3:40:23.300 --> 3:40:31.940]  assassinated for political reasons the british diplomat craig murray uh a man of impeccable
[3:40:31.940 --> 3:40:39.220]  integrity an excellent reputation says that he was in touch with rich and that rich
[3:40:39.940 --> 3:40:48.100]  passed to him certain documents in a parking lot near american university in washington dc
[3:40:49.620 --> 3:40:59.220]  it is also notable that uh mr rich um had uh without any question access to the material
[3:40:59.220 --> 3:41:08.580]  in question donald trump must tell his fbi director a person who should be of
[3:41:09.460 --> 3:41:18.500]  non-political background a law enforcement person a man or a woman who will put politics
[3:41:18.500 --> 3:41:28.100]  aside and get behind the effort to take this investigation from the metropolitan police of
[3:41:28.100 --> 3:41:35.620]  the district of columbia uh and conduct it in a professional manner in which no stone is left
[3:41:35.620 --> 3:41:43.940]  unturned we have seen the private investigator initially hired by the rich family he is an
[3:41:43.940 --> 3:41:51.700]  african-american of excellent reputation his contacts within the dc metropolitan police
[3:41:51.700 --> 3:42:02.260]  are first rate he is correct in my view that rich's computer his pc contained evidence that he was
[3:42:02.260 --> 3:42:13.860]  in touch with wikileaks fox is a conundrum of boiling internal politics you see the murdoch
[3:42:13.860 --> 3:42:22.340]  sons would like fox to become the sky channel and thus fox backed off what i believe is indeed
[3:42:22.340 --> 3:42:29.780]  an accurate early report that some 40 000 documents went from mr rich to wikileaks
[3:42:30.740 --> 3:42:38.260]  i believe sean hennedy knows it too and i'm disappointed that fox has undercut one of their
[3:42:38.260 --> 3:42:48.180]  leading conservative commentators and a staunch supporter of president trump indeed we are only
[3:42:48.180 --> 3:42:58.100]  beginning the question of mr rich and who murdered him and why i'd like to know wouldn't you
[3:42:58.100 --> 3:43:08.820]  do meanwhile the president is abroad now a nine day trip i think is another example of poor staff
[3:43:08.820 --> 3:43:17.860]  work by the people around the president uh just the same the stage craft is good and the president
[3:43:17.860 --> 3:43:24.900]  is having a most successful trip when he returns he will be confronted again with the partnership
[3:43:24.900 --> 3:43:33.460]  partisanship at a fever pitch uh and many on the both sides of the aisle seeking to get their mugs
[3:43:33.460 --> 3:43:41.620]  on tv with false accusations of treason and collusion with the russians this past week
[3:43:42.180 --> 3:43:50.100]  i complied with a u.s senate intelligence committee request for documents i turned over
[3:43:50.100 --> 3:43:58.900]  all documents regarding a very specific issue area pertaining to russia i have it on good
[3:43:58.900 --> 3:44:06.660]  authority that paul manifold the campaign chairman for donald trump did the same and i
[3:44:06.660 --> 3:44:15.780]  reiterate my desire to testify in public before the senate or the house committee see it's time
[3:44:15.780 --> 3:44:24.900]  for the feinstein's the frankins the warners and on the house side the shifts the swaw wells
[3:44:24.900 --> 3:44:35.780]  the spires to put up or shut up don't accuse paul manifold or roger stone of treason we may be tough
[3:44:36.660 --> 3:44:43.620]  and sharp elbow partisan political operatives but we are not traitors to the united states
[3:44:43.620 --> 3:44:52.020]  and the insinuation that we are uh is uh rankles against your constant phony claim
[3:44:52.580 --> 3:45:01.700]  for civility in politics and it will not be tolerated now general flinn may choose to plead
[3:45:01.700 --> 3:45:09.860]  the fifth that is not in our system necessarily proof of guilt and the general's legal strategy
[3:45:09.860 --> 3:45:18.020]  and his public relations strategy a bit of a mystery to me i must say is up to him but as for me
[3:45:18.900 --> 3:45:26.340]  i want to address the fake question of whether i knew about john padesta's emails being hacked
[3:45:26.340 --> 3:45:35.220]  in advance a lie proven to be a lie by fact check dot org hardly a right wing organization
[3:45:35.220 --> 3:45:43.700]  uh and i want to dismiss the question of whether i had specific advanced knowledge of the content
[3:45:44.420 --> 3:45:49.860]  of the incredible information that wiki leaks dumped on the american people indeed the world
[3:45:50.420 --> 3:45:59.700]  in october uh the idea that i colluded with assange the idea that assange is a russian asset
[3:45:59.700 --> 3:46:09.940]  the idea that gucifer 2.0 works for the russians is intelligence agency obama appointee poppy cock
[3:46:10.580 --> 3:46:20.260]  nonsense i say again when the agencies use the word assessment let your bs detector go up
[3:46:20.980 --> 3:46:27.940]  that means they know nothing that means they are telling you what fits their narrative
[3:46:27.940 --> 3:46:37.460]  not necessarily the truth and i applaud the appointment of a special prosecutor i have grave
[3:46:37.460 --> 3:46:44.500]  reservations about mr muhler and his wife a high powered attorney who have obvious connections to
[3:46:44.500 --> 3:46:54.580]  the clinton's and other power players in this drama i am hopeful mr muhler can run an impartial
[3:46:54.580 --> 3:47:06.020]  investigation he did after all tell george w bush that his meta data collection program violated the
[3:47:06.020 --> 3:47:17.220]  us constitution we are at a crossroads where the parallels between former president richard nixon
[3:47:17.220 --> 3:47:24.900]  and donald trump are indeed manifest you see nixon ended the war in vietnam he opened the door to
[3:47:24.900 --> 3:47:32.660]  china he reached a strategic arms limitation agreement with the soviets and we now know
[3:47:32.660 --> 3:47:41.220]  that the watergate burglary team was infiltrated by the cia we know that the uh that the uh judge
[3:47:41.220 --> 3:47:48.260]  in the watergate burglars case john sarika was meeting ex parteid with uh watergate special
[3:47:48.260 --> 3:47:55.780]  prosecutor archibald cox and leon jo warsky we know that the washington post was well aware of a
[3:47:55.780 --> 3:48:03.460]  complex pentagon spying operation inside the nixon white house where documents were being
[3:48:03.460 --> 3:48:10.900]  perloined from national security advisor henry kissinger and the president copied and sent to
[3:48:10.900 --> 3:48:19.860]  admiral thomas more the head of the joint chiefs in violation of law we know that richard nixon
[3:48:19.860 --> 3:48:28.340]  was taken down because he was a peacemaker now yes he gave them a sword there is no question
[3:48:28.340 --> 3:48:34.820]  but donald trump who has roused the passions of the silent majority and the forgotten americans
[3:48:34.820 --> 3:48:42.500]  like no president since richard nixon is now under assault from the same deep state sources
[3:48:43.060 --> 3:48:51.140]  the fbi the cia the washington post and the political intelligentsia manufacturing lies
[3:48:51.140 --> 3:49:00.900]  the president disclosed classified information to the russians about isis using laptops for
[3:49:00.900 --> 3:49:06.900]  bombs and getting them on planes well i believe that appeared in a hundred newspapers across america
[3:49:07.700 --> 3:49:13.220]  that story is a fabrication that is meant to discredit the president and then there's the
[3:49:13.220 --> 3:49:22.580]  new york times all the news that's fit to print embellished with a left-wing tint mr comey has
[3:49:22.580 --> 3:49:31.460]  a memo saying the president tried to impede his investigation who has seen such memo oh a person
[3:49:31.460 --> 3:49:41.220]  told a reporter on the phone and read from it bush why that's journalism no that's a hit piece
[3:49:41.220 --> 3:49:48.660]  by the new york times to take down and destabilize donald trump because he challenges the globalists
