[01:09.960 --> 01:14.960]  German government the British government the US government and other government leaders are
[01:14.960 --> 01:22.800]  having special flu shots for themselves that don't have the Marisol Mercury that don't have
[01:22.800 --> 01:29.160]  aluminum that don't have indra lukin 2 that don't have these other adjuvants in them that
[01:29.160 --> 01:35.960]  in many cases according to the medical doctors and brain surgeons and epidemiologists and
[01:35.960 --> 01:42.040]  endocrinologists and virologists we've interviewed here on this radio show in many cases the adjuvants
[01:42.040 --> 01:52.840]  are worse than the RNA and the cancer viruses that are in all the major vaccines and all over the
[01:52.840 --> 02:00.560]  world in the United States England you name it medical workers doctors nurses are refusing in
[02:00.560 --> 02:07.280]  mass the vast majority in polls to take the shot and so the public saying well then how can you
[02:07.280 --> 02:14.160]  try to force us to take the vaccine we'll be talking about that today in great detail I
[02:14.160 --> 02:20.160]  mentioned this Friday but never got to it it was a Wall Street Journal article Wednesday
[02:20.160 --> 02:26.280]  October 14th I read while I was in the airport in Los Angeles insurers stand against committees
[02:26.280 --> 02:33.160]  plan industry's opposition driven by weakened mandates for coverage widens divide with Congress
[02:33.880 --> 02:38.920]  influence still possible and they go on to admit that the insurance companies basically wrote the
[02:38.920 --> 02:48.120]  bill and that they want government-run health care see the control left says oh you're on
[02:48.120 --> 02:56.920]  insurance company payroll if you don't want government-run health care excuse me excuse me
[03:00.920 --> 03:05.560]  it's the insurance companies that are threatening to back out because it doesn't have
[03:06.680 --> 03:10.600]  all the big government health care in it now a lot of it's been stripped away it's still bad
[03:10.600 --> 03:19.160]  and they're in there saying they want liability protection they want to be able to
[03:20.920 --> 03:27.480]  put $5,000 fines on people a year not $2,000 fines from the government if you don't go buy
[03:27.480 --> 03:32.760]  insurance from them they want money kept out of your paycheck and given to them because the
[03:32.760 --> 03:38.520]  insurance companies are another arm of the banks and that's what the global carbon tax is that's
[03:38.520 --> 03:44.680]  what the income tax is that's what all these taxes are is to give more and more of your paycheck
[03:44.680 --> 03:48.520]  to the banks the same ones that have run the entire derivative scam
[03:50.440 --> 03:57.240]  so we're going to be breaking that down today also it's getting a lot of attention while we're
[03:57.240 --> 04:03.640]  busy looking at health care and busy worrying about the balloon boy and all the rest of this

[04:21.480 --> 04:28.440]  on air it's in the news it's admitted a global governance over carbon over all human activity

[07:09.240 --> 07:15.400]  and this will regulate and control every facet of our lives so we're going to be
[07:15.400 --> 07:24.040]  be breaking that down for people uh today again i'm alex jones your host i'm glad that you have
[07:24.040 --> 07:31.720]  decided to join us on this live sunday edition four to six p.m central standard time we're also

[07:40.600 --> 07:45.960]  here's another headline this is out of the associated press
[07:47.000 --> 07:53.640]  u.s senator global warming bill possible soon and senator barbara boxer goes on to
[07:53.640 --> 08:01.320]  say that she believes it will pass before the kopenhagen treaty is to be signed by barack obama
[08:01.320 --> 08:15.000]  in december now ladies and gentlemen the united nations states that this will be a tax on all
[08:15.000 --> 08:22.520]  the foods you eat your car electricity everything that goes on inside your home you will be given
[08:22.520 --> 08:32.360]  home inspections this is just government growing by a thousand percent and remember earlier this
[08:32.360 --> 08:38.120]  week arnold schwarzzenegger said as part of the carbon footprint they're going to tax all home
[08:39.480 --> 08:45.080]  appliances for their carbon footprint in california setting the precedent for the rest of the u.s
[08:45.080 --> 08:53.720]  and they're just going to outright ban 40 inch and bigger big screen tv's calling them power hogs
[08:53.720 --> 09:00.280]  so this idea of rationing and the united nation says that finally you're going to be taxed according
[09:00.280 --> 09:09.720]  to calories i read this in club of rum documents from 1963 by the way i was in the la airport and
[09:09.720 --> 09:14.280]  i didn't just buy this wall street journal to read while i was on the plane i bought a book called
[09:17.400 --> 09:26.040]  the endless war no the the forever war and i've almost finished that it's supposedly one of the
[09:26.040 --> 09:31.240]  best selling science fiction books ever and it was written in the early 70s
[09:31.240 --> 09:41.560]  and in between reading a wall street journal on the plane and and reading most of the forever war
[09:42.120 --> 09:49.400]  in the forever war the eugenesis take over the planet they only first let you have one child
[09:49.400 --> 09:55.800]  then they basically ban having children you've got to have them test tube and the whole global
[09:55.800 --> 10:00.920]  system is run off of calories and you're only given so many calories and they euthanize the
[10:00.920 --> 10:08.040]  old people now i know that author read u n and club of rome documents i know he read all this
[10:08.040 --> 10:15.000]  huxley documents i know that he read julian huxley reports i know he read bertrand russell because
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.320]  once you've read what the united nations has says they're planning to do you know everything
[10:21.320 --> 10:28.920]  that's going to happen it's just the amazing thing is now i watch popular culture and i realize
[10:28.920 --> 10:36.280]  that most people in the establishment even authors and tv producers know about this i watch very
[10:36.280 --> 10:41.800]  little tv maybe at 45 minutes a day when i'm running on the treadmill that's more than it in the past
[10:42.840 --> 10:49.560]  but the point is that i was on youtube a couple weeks ago late at night and i noticed they had
[10:49.560 --> 10:59.800]  the entire star trek episodes on there and i thought you know let me just randomly choose
[11:00.120 --> 11:06.920]  an episode so i clicked on the one that has con in it i guess you know decades later they make
[11:06.920 --> 11:14.120]  star trek to the wrath of con i watched the one with con in it and in that they're talking about
[11:14.120 --> 11:20.360]  how a world government got started carrying out eugenics and that the superhuman eugenics
[11:20.360 --> 11:26.440]  leaders were in were were were having these off war battles and almost destroyed the earth
[11:26.440 --> 11:33.160]  and con was one of them and of course i'd read about the eugenics wars in u n documents from the
[11:33.160 --> 11:38.920]  40s 50s and 60s how they planned to have this eugenics war against humanity but it was clear
[11:38.920 --> 11:43.960]  that gene roddenberry who'd written that episode had also read those u n documents
[11:46.360 --> 11:50.040]  i mean the point is i'm not even looking for this stuff i'm like oh this looks like a good
[11:50.040 --> 11:54.920]  science fiction book i'll take a break i just shot a tv and you know another episode or two
[11:54.920 --> 12:01.000]  episodes of jesse ventura's tv show that's coming up in the in the winter december and january
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.160]  on the true tv network let me just get a wall street journal a little bit of research while i'm
[12:07.160 --> 12:11.800]  about to get on the plane in an hour and let me just buy this book for entertainment
[12:14.520 --> 12:18.920]  and oh let me just click on a star trek and watch it and it's all about eugenics
[12:20.360 --> 12:27.400]  that's all any of this is about and then the larger question is how do i get the public
[12:28.200 --> 12:32.440]  to care about this how do you get the public to even think that this is important
[12:32.440 --> 12:40.840]  or past you know women care about how big their lips are if they're skinny and men care about
[12:40.840 --> 12:47.080]  other football teams doing and that's all fine and dandy you know i'm glad women like to look
[12:47.080 --> 12:52.760]  good i'm glad men like football or whatever but how do i get people to care they're putting poison
[12:52.760 --> 12:58.280]  in our water well the answer is the public just doesn't believe that i mean they don't care if
[12:58.280 --> 13:05.160]  it's in government textbooks they don't care if their kids drinking it i guess or their kids are
[13:05.160 --> 13:12.840]  taking these vaccines i took my children to uh jason's deli last night and almost every person
[13:12.840 --> 13:18.920]  including the employees was wearing university of texas burn orange and i sat there between
[13:19.480 --> 13:24.280]  a bunch of tables around me and all anyone was talking about was the university of texas
[13:24.280 --> 13:31.480]  and i thought what would happen if i could get them to all wear bill of rights shirts and teach
[13:31.480 --> 13:37.000]  their kids their rights or what would happen if i could get them to learn about global carbon
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.280]  taxes and what's that's how that's meant to shut down our economy and make us dependent on the
[13:42.280 --> 13:48.920]  government man then these people would have a destiny and have a future but they've been raised
[13:48.920 --> 13:56.920]  in entertainment and and raised to just accept their surroundings and and and literally just
[13:56.920 --> 14:03.640]  take stimuli from the government and the media and the tv and just regurgitate it and so i get
[14:03.640 --> 14:09.080]  up here and i tell them about the united nations they don't want to hear about that they don't
[14:09.080 --> 14:13.240]  want to know that a global tax is being set up they don't want to know they're going to have
[14:13.240 --> 14:19.400]  home inspections they don't want to know that government ministers and police and military
[14:20.520 --> 14:27.320]  doctors are refusing to take the flu shot they don't want to believe me that there's mercury in
[14:27.320 --> 14:31.800]  it and it says so on the insert they don't want to believe me it has adjuvants in it and live
[14:31.800 --> 14:39.800]  cancer viruses they don't want to read der spiegel and build and lefiguero and the bbc i mean it's
[14:39.800 --> 14:46.760]  actually in foreign news they don't want to it's even on fox news that people are taking the shots
[14:46.760 --> 14:53.240]  and getting paralyzed but they say well that's a good price to pay it's very very rare no it's not
[14:53.240 --> 15:03.160]  very very rare and because you know the average person just isn't ready to believe that any of
[15:03.160 --> 15:11.800]  this could be done by design and because they can't believe that something like this would be done
[15:11.800 --> 15:18.280]  by design because they don't understand eugenics i'll tell you the thinking intelligentsia does
[15:21.080 --> 15:23.880]  look how it's all over popular culture and in movies
[15:23.880 --> 15:37.400]  and and well i'm gonna go over this i'm gonna go over how the british government the german
[15:37.400 --> 15:43.480]  government they won't take the flu shots themselves and those that do have a special additive free
[15:43.480 --> 15:51.320]  one that they take i'm also going to go over a bunch of economic news you see the insurance
[15:51.320 --> 15:55.960]  companies are behind the government takeover of health care and they admit this in their own
[15:55.960 --> 16:00.120]  press releases but the control left goes oh no the insurance companies don't want it

[21:10.120 --> 21:16.600]  read the copenhagen treaty and i've scanned over it it states openly global governance and you can
[21:16.600 --> 21:23.560]  watch the g20 you can watch gordon brown you can watch tony blair you can watch uh people in the
[21:23.560 --> 21:30.520]  cabinet like hillary clinton and barack obama saying this is a new world order this is global
[21:30.520 --> 21:36.840]  governance hundreds of financial publications saying we're going to pay our carbon taxes
[21:36.840 --> 21:51.480]  to a new private bank of the world to a new private bank and i just am so sad for our country
[21:51.480 --> 21:59.560]  because the public is in a trance the public is in a complete trance only thinking about
[21:59.560 --> 22:04.920]  themselves individually in their job and the leisure they want to carry out and the ball games
[22:04.920 --> 22:11.480]  they want to go to and they're not even thinking about the wider world they don't know the united
[22:11.480 --> 22:15.880]  states is being conquered by offshore private banks they don't know the government's taking
[22:15.880 --> 22:22.360]  over health care as a new form of taxation has nothing to do with health care they don't know
[22:23.400 --> 22:28.360]  any of this they don't know the global carbon tax is meant to shut down industry that is
[22:28.360 --> 22:35.080]  controlled by the globalist thatcher advisor kopenhagen goal is one world government
[22:37.400 --> 22:41.320]  and here is the british lord speaking to the university of minnesota
[22:42.920 --> 22:53.480]  to a packed house breaking it down for everyone here it is and what are we doing instead at
[22:53.480 --> 23:03.640]  kopenhagen this december weeks away a treaty will be signed your president will sign it most of
[23:03.640 --> 23:06.520]  the third world countries will sign it because they think they're going to get money out of it
[23:07.160 --> 23:10.760]  most of the left-wing regimes around the world like the european union will rubber stamp it
[23:11.400 --> 23:18.600]  virtually nobody won't sign it i have read that treaty and what it says is this
[23:18.600 --> 23:25.960]  that a world government is going to be created the word government actually appears as the first
[23:25.960 --> 23:33.560]  of three purposes of the new entity the second purpose is the transfer of wealth from the
[23:33.560 --> 23:41.640]  countries of the west to third world countries in satisfaction of what is called coily a climate
[23:41.640 --> 23:46.520]  debt because we've been burning co2 and they haven't and we've been screwing up the climate we
[23:46.520 --> 23:51.960]  haven't been screwing up the climate but that's the line and the third purpose of this new entity
[23:51.960 --> 23:59.320]  this government is enforcement how many of you think that the word election or democracy or vote
[23:59.320 --> 24:05.720]  or ballot occurs anywhere in the 200 pages of that treaty quite right it doesn't appear once
[24:07.080 --> 24:15.880]  so at last the communists who piled out of the berlin wall and into the environmental movement
[24:15.880 --> 24:21.000]  and took over greenpeace so that my friends who founded it left within a year because they'd
[24:21.000 --> 24:29.320]  captured it now the apotheosis is at hand they are about to impose a communist world government
[24:29.320 --> 24:34.280]  on the world you have a president who has very strong sympathies with that point of view he's
[24:34.280 --> 24:39.000]  going to sign he'll sign anything he's a no-well peace lawyer of course he'll sign it and the
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.360]  trouble is this if that treaty is signed your constitution says that it takes precedence over
[24:44.360 --> 24:49.880]  your constitution and you can't resile from that treaty unless you get the agreement of all the
[24:49.880 --> 24:54.600]  other states parties and because you'll be the biggest paying country they're not going to let you
[24:54.600 --> 25:03.880]  out so thank you america you were the beacon of freedom to the world it is a privilege merely
[25:03.880 --> 25:12.200]  to stand on this soil of freedom while it is still free but in the next few weeks unless
[25:12.200 --> 25:21.320]  you stop it your president will sign your freedom your democracy and your prosperity away forever
[25:22.200 --> 25:27.400]  and neither you nor any subsequent government you may elect will have any power whatsoever
[25:27.400 --> 25:33.480]  to take it back again that is how serious it is i've read the treaty i've seen this stuff
[25:33.480 --> 25:39.560]  about government and climate debt and enforcement they are going to do this to you whether you like
[25:39.560 --> 25:50.440]  it or no but i think it is here here in your great nation which i so love and i so admire it is here
[25:51.640 --> 25:59.720]  that perhaps at this eleventh hour at the 59th minute and 59th second you will rise up and you
[25:59.720 --> 26:06.600]  will stop your president from signing that dreadful treaty that purposeless treaty for there is no
[26:06.600 --> 26:10.760]  problem with the climate and even if there were economically speaking there's nothing we can do
[26:10.760 --> 26:18.680]  about it so i end by saying to you the words that winston church you'll address to your president
[26:18.680 --> 26:26.040]  in the darkest hour before the dawn of freedom in the second world war he quoted from your great
[26:26.040 --> 26:39.480]  poet long fellow sail on oh ship of state sail on oh union strong and great humanity with all its
[26:39.480 --> 26:49.480]  fears with all the hopes of future years is hanging breathless on thy fate thank you
[26:49.480 --> 27:00.440]  all right that's lord christopher mocton now one of the most high power members of the house of lords
[27:01.560 --> 27:09.320]  now notice he says it's communist no the biggest banks the biggest oil companies are behind the
[27:09.320 --> 27:15.480]  global taxing system because it's going to be a private tax paid to them and they're going to
[27:15.480 --> 27:21.320]  regulate it and control it in fact here's a london guardian article today the world's future is

[34:02.280 --> 34:12.120]  you
[34:20.200 --> 34:23.960]  they don't have any respect for themselves
[34:23.960 --> 34:32.920]  they want to be slaves they don't want their liberties and freedoms that's not what they're
[34:32.920 --> 34:42.360]  into they want to just wear a football or baseball shirt and to be bossed around by black uniform
[34:42.360 --> 34:48.440]  police and and to have drugs forced on them and to have the state make their kids go to school year
[34:48.440 --> 34:55.800]  around and then phase in having your children raised in government dormitories i mean that's
[34:55.800 --> 35:16.120]  in all the government reports i mean what i talk about here is the truth i'm just telling people
[35:16.120 --> 35:27.800]  the truth and it isn't funny i'm very not even frustrated i'm just disgusted and sad
[35:29.880 --> 35:34.680]  because i know how real the new world order is i mean they're openly announcing world government
[35:34.680 --> 35:43.320]  all over the news and the public some of the public think it's cute and funny to still laugh at it
[35:43.320 --> 35:50.120]  and as if you laugh at something it makes it go away this is a very nasty tyranny that we're
[35:50.120 --> 35:57.080]  dealing with here these are very very evil people these are horrible horrible horrible
[35:57.080 --> 36:20.200]  horrible and it's hard to go through life doing the research being informed knowing the facts
[36:20.200 --> 36:27.640]  knowing i'm right interviewing former heads of state congressmen and women scientists top
[36:27.640 --> 36:35.880]  doctors all agreeing with me having all the textbooks and documents written by the eugenicist
[36:35.880 --> 36:42.520]  by the planetary rulers to see the plan they're setting up and to see humanity robbed of its
[36:42.520 --> 37:01.320]  destiny really makes my blood boil but i'm kind of hard boiled now i've i've gone past the point
[37:01.320 --> 37:15.320]  of just being angry everything is turned on its head everything is the opposite of what it really
[37:15.320 --> 37:23.400]  is and how do you explain that to people i mean how do you explain that both parties are controlled
[37:23.400 --> 37:29.720]  by the same financial interest and that these major elections are completely staged or how
[37:29.720 --> 37:35.000]  do you explain to somebody that the big insurance companies want government-run healthcare
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.480]  how do you explain to the third world who's now clamoring for the world carbon tax
[37:44.840 --> 37:50.680]  that the carbon tax is designed in the united nations own documents to shut down their industry
[37:53.800 --> 37:59.480]  but the united nations advertises it as we're going to get the rich greedy americans
[37:59.480 --> 38:05.480]  and british and germans and japanese we're going to give you their money the big private
[38:05.480 --> 38:11.480]  central banks aren't going to give you anything they're the same imf and world bank that have
[38:11.480 --> 38:20.440]  raped the third world i read the world population commission reports i read the commission on
[38:20.440 --> 38:27.800]  population i read the state department random 200 i read the united nations biological diversity
[38:27.800 --> 38:34.040]  assessment 1996 i read eco science i've read literally hundreds of their white papers and
[38:34.040 --> 38:39.320]  books i sit there at night with bloodshot eyes reading this stuff and horror
[38:41.880 --> 38:47.400]  and people look at me and they say look i don't care i don't care if they're poisoning my water
[38:47.400 --> 38:50.520]  or putting stuff in the vaccines i like football
[38:50.520 --> 38:59.320]  well i'm going to be selfish and i'm going to go live my life and i'm going to act like none of
[38:59.320 --> 39:05.720]  this exists and i don't care if my kid dies at 10 years of age of vaccine induced leukemia
[39:06.280 --> 39:11.400]  i don't care of bare pharmaceutical knowingly and over a million ampoules shipped out hiv to
[39:11.400 --> 39:16.120]  hemophiliacs and killed them that are in the hammer i don't care i don't care if they gave
[39:16.120 --> 39:21.640]  black men syphilis and let them dive it with this gigi i don't care if project shad they take our own
[39:21.640 --> 39:26.200]  troops and march them into chambers and nerve gas them and it's declassified i'm going to trust
[39:26.200 --> 39:30.760]  the government and i'm going to roll my sleeve up and i'm going to take whatever they give me
[39:30.760 --> 39:36.280]  and and i'm and i believe that carbon dioxide that plants breathe is a nerve gas itself and
[39:36.280 --> 39:50.360]  i want a tax put on it i know record numbers of people are listening
[39:56.200 --> 39:56.840]  but in a way
[40:00.840 --> 40:04.840]  in a way it's even worse it's like we know how we're being destroyed
[40:04.840 --> 40:10.200]  like like we're all here awake watching all the slaves loving their enslavement
[40:10.200 --> 40:15.080]  and the elite are sitting there laughing at us they laugh at us they write whatever they write
[40:15.080 --> 40:19.800]  books laughing at us about how the public will never wake up to what's happening i mean these
[40:19.800 --> 40:27.960]  guys write books about how stupid you are and how they're really going after your hardcore
[40:27.960 --> 40:39.160]  or how they are really tearing you up and i read the cap and trade bill that's past
[40:39.160 --> 40:46.520]  the house set to pass the senate it's it mirrors the copenhagen treaty it just gives unlimited
[40:46.520 --> 40:50.120]  power to 35 agencies to tax and regulate whatever they want
[40:50.120 --> 40:55.880]  and it'll take over every facet of our lives
[41:01.480 --> 41:06.120]  and then i just think well i could just get out of here go to some third world country
[41:06.120 --> 41:10.920]  what and wait for the tyranny to show up there wait for the global tyranny to unfold
[41:11.640 --> 41:15.960]  this this thing is moving fast now this is happening all over the world there's nowhere
[41:15.960 --> 41:24.120]  to run ladies and gentlemen there's nowhere to hide we're under social conditioning and engineering
[41:30.760 --> 41:36.440]  and i'm just so tired of watching con artists get away with their scams i'm so tired of watching
[41:37.000 --> 41:42.200]  the con artists that run the new world order with the gullible public that'll go along with anything
[41:42.200 --> 42:09.080]  i mean what's the point of even reading this stack of articles little kids women men getting
[42:09.080 --> 42:16.840]  paralyzed having seizures after the flu shot seasonal and h1n1 you know what go out and
[42:16.840 --> 42:21.320]  take it for yourself when you get Alzheimer's when you're 45 you get your heart right with god
[42:22.440 --> 42:29.800]  okay but here's mr spiegel chancellor and ministers are to receive special vaccine
[42:29.800 --> 42:34.440]  chancellor and ministers are to be protected after spiegel sources with special vaccine
[42:34.440 --> 42:46.680]  against pig flu an official of ministries and subordinate authorities likewise and it goes on
[42:46.680 --> 42:51.080]  to say that they don't trust the vaccine that it won't have the additives and the german armies
[42:51.080 --> 42:57.960]  getting a clean vaccine see they have to give government officials a different shot because
[42:57.960 --> 43:04.680]  they know what's going on have you heard that millionaire entrepreneur businessman your congressional

[47:19.560 --> 47:30.440]  planet dot com thank you for joining us you know i finally had a chance to listen to the new muse
[47:30.440 --> 47:36.040]  album we've had mr bellamy on the show he is a fan and it's total anti-new world order
[47:36.600 --> 47:42.520]  anti-left right paradigm it's about bringing down the new world order it's all about eugenics
[47:42.520 --> 47:50.120]  mega death's new album is about that as well inspired by my film in game and those are just
[47:50.120 --> 47:55.640]  a few of the benchmarks jesse ventura is now completely awake to the new world order i woke
[47:55.640 --> 48:02.040]  him up somewhat three years ago got him to come out for 911 truth two years ago now he's got a
[48:02.040 --> 48:10.360]  conspiracy theorist quote tv show the time warner has its hands deeply into but we'll see how that
[48:10.360 --> 48:16.840]  turns out and he's now fully awake he says his head spins at night as he learns more and more
[48:17.480 --> 48:23.640]  and that's what happens for a while and then you just get upset and focused and dedicated
[48:23.640 --> 48:29.160]  to fighting this system i'm going to go to james and chris and victoria and george and steve and
[48:29.160 --> 48:51.720]  many others that are holding here in a minute but i uh i just want new listeners to know
[48:51.720 --> 48:55.880]  something if you're tuning for the first time you better get your head out of the sand
[48:55.880 --> 49:04.600]  and wake up fast and study world history and what most governments end up doing to people
[49:05.160 --> 49:10.600]  and learn that tyranny and oppression and bondage are the norm and freedom is very rare
[49:12.680 --> 49:19.080]  because it is very upsetting for me to watch innocent people being abused and hurt by the system
[49:19.080 --> 49:27.240]  it is very upsetting to me to see cancer numbers and autism numbers and
[49:29.160 --> 49:35.240]  all these other degenerative diseases to know that in thousands of studies they've known for
[49:35.240 --> 49:43.080]  more than 50 years that vaccines are causing most of the degenerative and early onset and even
[49:43.080 --> 49:54.360]  juvenile onset of arthritis that vaccine autoimmune reactions are not associated with it's been proven
[49:55.560 --> 49:59.080]  that it is causing many of the early onset of diabetes
[50:01.480 --> 50:07.240]  and i have medical doctor after medical doctor on and all i want to do is warn people
[50:07.240 --> 50:15.080]  you know this is what we know about the government and these big pharma companies
[50:15.640 --> 50:22.280]  they are doing it by design there's no other way for me to try to explain that
[50:24.440 --> 50:31.400]  to people there's no other way that i can even try to get this across to you
[50:31.400 --> 50:37.560]  and i know it's heavy and i know that subconsciously you want to divert and distract
[50:38.280 --> 50:43.560]  often to other issues i understand that that that that people want to rationalize
[50:44.200 --> 50:46.920]  or cognitive dissonance kicks in and people make excuses
[50:53.160 --> 50:59.080]  it happens over and over again but i at least want you to know that the world government is now
[50:59.080 --> 51:04.920]  here and it is going to hurt all of us very very badly i'm going to go to your calls
[51:06.760 --> 51:10.040]  i want to get into the whole healthcare bill next hour and what's really behind that
[51:13.000 --> 51:17.320]  and i also want to get into an ap article there's also a time magazine article about
[51:17.320 --> 51:23.320]  weather modification and government weather control yeah we're not in kansas anymore folks
[51:23.320 --> 51:30.600]  and then like i said all over the world government officials are getting special vaccines that don't
[51:30.600 --> 51:37.960]  have the squalene the mercury the aluminum the ender luke and two meanwhile woman disabled by
[51:37.960 --> 51:44.200]  flu shot reaction fda admits medical doctors admit she's been paralyzed she was a cheerleader for
[51:44.200 --> 51:51.080]  the red skin so she took the shot two weeks ago that's just the regular flu shot german soldiers
[51:51.080 --> 51:59.800]  get added to free swine flu shot the public doesn't that's just some of the news i've got there
[52:01.880 --> 52:07.640]  i've got some other important announcements coming up as well but uh you know the biggest
[52:07.640 --> 52:14.360]  issue here is world government is openly being announced and it's exactly as we told you it
[52:14.360 --> 52:21.640]  would be announced and let me steal all my thunder here and explain something i know a lot of you
[52:21.640 --> 52:27.960]  heard me five ten fifteen twelve years ago thirteen fourteen years ago talking about this
[52:31.000 --> 52:36.120]  and you laughed at me but let's just steal the thunder from alex jones here real fast
[52:36.120 --> 52:43.960]  fast because now it's all admitted and our credibility is rising very fast
[52:45.480 --> 52:50.200]  all i was doing was reading government documents this is all public and so now and
[52:50.200 --> 52:54.360]  they're in the final phases they're announcing yeah it's going to be a private bank it's going

[53:08.040 --> 53:22.520]  control and the cornerstone of it isn't just going to be a toben tax or an oil wellhead tax
[53:22.520 --> 53:28.840]  it's going to be a tax on all human activity and it's going to be a free for all gang raping of
[53:28.840 --> 53:35.160]  the public with locals the cities the counties the states the feds the internationals all putting
[53:35.160 --> 53:43.320]  different taxes on different things television sets beef chicken pork fish watering your yard

[57:07.480 --> 57:13.000]  and arguing about me instead of warning your neighbor about the Gardasil shot or about the flu
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.720]  shot or warning people about cap and trade or warning people about government takeover of
[57:17.720 --> 57:25.400]  health care they're there just to frustrate us and confuse us and get us in fighting with each other

[1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:55.800]  hi alex um calling from uh calgary alberta uh with 9 11 truth here in calgary and uh
[1:00:56.440 --> 1:01:01.240]  i don't i just want to bring up a controversial issue i guess it seems to i don't know i've
[1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:05.880]  not sure if you've uh ever interviewed this guy his name is dr peter duesburg
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:14.920]  i think i have interviewed duesburg he says hiv doesn't cause aids and then hiv hiv is actually
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:22.040]  a cover uh for other soft kill weapons and the age drugs themselves and there's some truth to that
[1:01:22.040 --> 1:01:28.680]  but i've interviewed many times dr stan montee for medical doctor and what the studies show is
[1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:39.880]  that it is meant to kill africans or people of uh african descent okay it it uh anglo especially
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:47.000]  northern europeans germans and north don't even have the coupler points uh on their
[1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:57.800]  uh white blood cells that basically can't even get the hiv unless they get like a massive blood
[1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:03.880]  transfusion of solid but but if a black person comes in contact with just a few viruses they're
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:10.200]  dead in a hammer well that's uh that's interesting too i don't know because it just seems like
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:16.440]  uh duesburg's film that i watched it uh talks about how the azt basically the drugs that they
[1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:22.360]  give you after you yeah the azt turns off your immune system mm-hmm yeah yeah just destroys
[1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:27.320]  your body from the inside out pretty much and um so i don't know i just wanted to find out
[1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:31.640]  see that's the only way to kill somebody you tell them oh you're hiv positive then you give them a
[1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:37.080]  drug that kills them and you notice magic johnson all these people are alive 15 years later and they'll
[1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:41.480]  come out and make weird statements like i've been cured and that's because they do have cures for it
[1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:46.920]  sir i appreciate your call let me just say this here we have the government documents we've gone
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:53.960]  over them here on air they did develop autoimmune soft kill weapons autoimmune viruses that kill
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:03:02.120]  people slowly and in a degenerative fashion and that's what hiv is and uh you can google nobel
[1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:10.920]  prize winner says hiv aids manufactured fact let's let's do that we never do that anymore um nobel
[1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:25.400]  prize winner says hiv is man-made or hiv south africa has declassified a giant race specific
[1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:30.840]  bio weapons program dick cheney in the september 20 of 2000 rebuilding america's defenses said

[1:06:38.440 --> 1:06:45.240]  again foster children orphanage kids troops u.s troops but the russians did it the germans
[1:06:45.240 --> 1:06:51.720]  did it the u.s does it the french do it i mean they had thousands of tests the u.s did
[1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:56.840]  where they would march u.s soldiers in under project shadow their programs and nerve gas
[1:06:56.840 --> 1:07:04.120]  them to death and that the army did that to test and see if they could get enough doctors to promote
[1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:11.000]  the higher levels of race specific weapons to see if they had warped logic mackey of ellie and
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:16.520]  logic of n justifies the means and that they would go along with that to create the larger
[1:07:16.520 --> 1:07:26.680]  cadres i mean how do you read tens of thousands of different city sprayed with radiation school kids
[1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:32.920]  sprayed with anthrax i mean how do you know this and then anthrax gets mailed out and it's a u.s
[1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:37.160]  government strain and enemies of the white house gets sent it and we're like oh no the government's
[1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:43.400]  not involved in that then it turns out the whole white house is on the anthrax fighting
[1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:50.760]  antibiotic sypro 32 days before it pops up right at the time it was mailed out
[1:07:55.560 --> 1:07:57.400]  source on that's associated press
[1:08:00.440 --> 1:08:05.320]  i mean when when they write textbooks like eco science about how they're poisoning the water
[1:08:05.320 --> 1:08:12.040]  to sterilize this and then the new republic and salon magazine amongst others write hit pieces
[1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:17.880]  saying i'm insane and believe that the white house science are called for drug in the water
[1:08:17.880 --> 1:08:24.040]  i scan the thing in it's been in the associated press after we broke it i mean it's in the
[1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:29.880]  mainstream news you jackasses i don't have time to play games with you anymore
[1:08:32.040 --> 1:08:37.160]  you stupid people out there if you love your family you better get your heads out of the ground
[1:08:37.160 --> 1:08:45.480]  and start learning i'm tired of watching this stuff go on look at this look at this
[1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:53.080]  for prisonplanet.tv viewers you can see it flu shots defended but growing number of elderly
[1:08:53.080 --> 1:09:00.520]  refusing vaccine this is out of the houston news out of the houston post
[1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:06.280]  and smart listeners are going wait a minute the houston post has been closed for years
[1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:12.040]  that's right this is from october 17 october 15 1976
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:21.080]  i was wondering why i got confused when i got mailed this the one behind it's the houston post
[1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:30.120]  from kent state they sent me that too so why does it say 1970 and then in this page
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:38.440]  of the houston post it says uh friday october 15 1976 flu shots defended but growing number of
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:47.240]  elderly refusing vaccine houston health officials have faced thursday night with more physician
[1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:51.880]  cancellations for swine flu vaccine and a growing number of elderly persons refusing to take the
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:57.640]  shots but the texas department of health resources announced earlier in austin the statewide swine
[1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:04.040]  influenza program would resume monday it had been suspended following the deaths of several
[1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:08.600]  persons who've been given the vaccine federal scientists ruled out the vaccine is the cause of
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:15.240]  the deaths but then by 1978 the government had to admit that the flu swine flu shot did kill
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:20.600]  people so here is a blast from the past and meanwhile the new shots are killing people again
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:27.240]  and it's on the insert it's on the printout that it's got mercury and that it's got adjuvants and
[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:32.920]  that it's got aluminum and that it's got indra luke and two and that it can cause gillian beret
[1:10:32.920 --> 1:10:37.320]  and other neurological disorders that can paralyze your make you have be an epileptic
[1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:43.320]  i mean i've posted on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com the inserts and people
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:48.520]  don't want to believe it they go no i'm not going to read the insert it's a conspiracy theory i'm
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:56.840]  going to take the shot there is no such thing as a drug insert i will not read it i will not go down
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:11:03.000]  to walgreens and ask to see the insert i will just take it because there's no such thing as a conspiracy
[1:11:03.800 --> 1:11:09.480]  but the balloon family with the balloon hoax in colorado they're being charged with conspiracy
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:14.360]  i was on the treadmill today jogging at the gym after looking waits and
[1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:18.520]  they're listening to the police chief out there in that town saying we're going to charge them with
[1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:27.400]  conspiracy with conspiracy and they may even charge the kids with conspiracy but governments
[1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:34.920]  they don't conspire all right let's go to calls here christin florida the victoria george steven
[1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:40.840]  others go ahead chris you're hey alec thanks god i thank god for you being there and uh you're
[1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:46.840]  talking about the uh duffy stream specific uh a version of uh hiv that 90 percent of
[1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:53.160]  sub-saharan africans have causing them to be 40 percent more likely to contract hiv and when
[1:11:53.160 --> 1:12:01.320]  it uh when it comes to obama back on the uh back on uh um talk to the school kids back on
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:07.160]  september 8th he was encouraging them to work harder and find a cure for hiv and cancer and
[1:12:07.160 --> 1:12:13.800]  become better inventors and innovators and yet there's dr the late dr boyd grazed i know you're
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:20.520]  aware of who who uh happened to be black and he wrote to then candidate obama in november 2008
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:25.960]  regarding the synthetic nature of hiv as a race specific biological weapon and mentioned the
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:32.120]  duffy gene specific strain and he also brings up the single injection hiv cure tetrisill that's
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:40.200]  patent five six seven six nine seven seven and i'll tell you what else is amazing and that's that
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:49.240]  all it doesn't matter i was just thinking about i was just thinking about how evil it is go ahead
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:55.160]  well absolutely because oh you can't expect obama to to keep his word if it's if he's
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:59.240]  telling us that it's not going to be mandatory vaccinations you know you can count it on it
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:06.840]  being the opposite but uh there's dr late dr boyd graze wrote to obama um well before he made
[1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:12.520]  this speech on september 8th to the school kids and of course you mentioned all the the propaganda
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:17.560]  that we're already paying for for those who want to do a little more bit more research uh you know
[1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:23.560]  about Leonard horror with the emerging viruses on the synthetic nature of hiv there's a hooper's
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:30.040]  the river hillary johnson's ostler's web uh professor donald scott's journal of degenerative
[1:13:30.040 --> 1:13:35.560]  diseases by absolutely i look i've got a jump i just i know they're getting ready to try to force
[1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:42.120]  a new hiv vaccine on people and it's killed a lot of people in trials for people that don't believe
[1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:50.280]  me just google uh polio vaccine causes polio associated press like two months ago admitted
[1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:56.200]  it's killing people with a weaponized form of super deadly polio that the un is giving
[1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:03.480]  and they all know there's nothing wrong with the vaccines polio virus spreads in
[1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:11.800]  nigeria cbs news and then it goes on to admit that it's caused by the vaccine
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:20.600]  yeah it says it's caused by the vaccine used to fight it cbs news second paragraph mutant polio
[1:14:20.600 --> 1:14:26.920]  virus spreads in nigeria and then as a minor footnote they just add oh by the way it was from the
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:34.440]  vaccine mutant super and notice those kids show them again on prism planet dot tv we're simulcasting
[1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:41.240]  on the radio air look at that notice how they're giving them the liquid vaccine that's the one
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:49.880]  shop full of cancer viruses you know i've got a pediatrician here in town for my children who's

[1:14:54.120 --> 1:15:02.600]  want and he pulled me aside one day when my son was in there about two getting you know yearly
[1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:09.000]  checkup and he said don't quote me on air you know doctors volunteer a few times a year for clinics
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:15.560]  we're supposed to and a few years ago i was in austin at one of these vaccine clinics for kids
[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:25.560]  and we were giving the 1970s live sv 40 polio oral vaccine to the kids that's illegal inside the us
[1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:29.880]  and i knew it was illegal and he said well what do you think that was about alex
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:37.400]  and every dose of that's got live cancer virus that will probably kill you in it and that's
[1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:42.200]  admitted but look at these kids getting live polio wounding them or killing they'll be in

[1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:49.720]  shadowy mercenary organizations at first i thought it was some foreign merc takeover because they
[1:27:49.720 --> 1:27:55.240]  said it was with foreign police policing the town and running a bizarre fema camp in hardened
[1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:59.960]  montana that made national news after we went there you got a lot of attention thanks to listeners

[1:33:01.400 --> 1:33:08.600]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[1:33:08.600 --> 1:33:31.800]  of the world now none of this may succeed this time but this to me is sort of the outline
[1:33:31.800 --> 1:33:43.000]  by which someday in the next few years a solution will emerge where does this mindset come from
[1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:49.560]  why do the elites kill the largest masses of people when no one is resisting them when they've
[1:33:49.560 --> 1:33:55.320]  already attained total control what ideology drives the elite psychopath
[1:33:55.320 --> 1:34:04.040]  since play does time 2400 years ago state planners have openly proclaimed their desire
[1:34:04.040 --> 1:34:09.480]  to control every detail of the commoners life from breeding programs to mass extermination
[1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:13.640]  of undesirables the dark dream has continued on for millennia
[1:34:13.640 --> 1:34:28.360]  the scientific rationale for tyranny has always been attractive to elites
[1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:34.600]  because it creates a convenient excuse for treating their fellow man as lower than animals
[1:34:35.880 --> 1:34:41.000]  robert thomas mouth is famous for saying that a mass food collapse would be helpful
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:46.920]  because it would wipe out the poor his fictional scenario would later be called a malthusian
[1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:54.840]  catastrophe mouth is important because his ideas led to the rise of a new scientific field
[1:34:54.840 --> 1:34:59.800]  that would dominate the course of human history for the next 200 plus years
[1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:07.160]  charles darwin an admirer of the malthusian catastrophe model developed the theory of
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:13.720]  evolution its chief tenant being the survival of the fittest with the help of th hoxley
[1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:19.160]  known as darwin's bulldog for his strong support of darwin's theories darwin's theories were pushed
[1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:25.800]  into wide acceptance among key scientific circles throughout england and then the world darwin's
[1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:32.680]  cousin francis galton credited as the father of eugenics saw an opportunity to advance mankind by
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:38.120]  taking the reins of darwin's evolution theory and applied social principles to develop social
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:45.800]  darwinism the families darwin galton hoxley and wedgewood were so obsessed with their new social
[1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:53.160]  design theory that they pledged their families would only breed with each other they falsely
[1:35:53.160 --> 1:36:02.440]  predicted that within only a few generations they would produce supermen the emerging pseudoscience
[1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:08.040]  was only codifying the practice of inbreeding already popular within elites for millennia
[1:36:09.640 --> 1:36:15.240]  the four families experiment was a disaster within only two generations of inbreeding
[1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:21.640]  close to 90 of their offspring either died at birth or were seriously mentally or physically
[1:36:21.640 --> 1:36:27.400]  handicapped the moneyed class of the planet and particularly the royal families of the world
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:32.200]  who were already obsessed with breeding and filled with the predatory disdain for the underclass
[1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:36.440]  seized on the new science and began aggressively enforcing its aims worldwide
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:47.560]  biometrics appears to be a new science but it was actually developed by galton
[1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:54.440]  back in the 1870s as a way to track racial traits and genetic histories and as a way to decide who
[1:36:54.440 --> 1:37:01.160]  would be licensed to breed in 1904 the cold springs harbor research facility was started in the
[1:37:01.160 --> 1:37:06.920]  united states by eugenicist charles davinport with the funding of prominent robber barons carnegie
[1:37:06.920 --> 1:37:16.120]  rockefeller and heron in 1907 the first sterilization laws were passed in the united states citizens
[1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:22.680]  with mild deformities or low test scores on their report cards were arrested and forcibly sterilized
[1:37:23.400 --> 1:37:29.240]  you're 17 now two hours yes but what have you done with my folks well we're trying to help the
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:34.840]  malice and you too they were taken to the hospital this afternoon hospital wasn't none of them take
[1:37:34.840 --> 1:37:39.880]  this morning we thought it was necessary to present your family's case to the state medical
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:46.120]  commission not to an examination they decided it was that one important action to take to have
[1:37:46.120 --> 1:37:52.680]  your entire family sterilized why what's that i don't know what you're talking about now in this
[1:37:52.680 --> 1:37:57.800]  state we have a law which provides for such people to have an operation so there won't be any more
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:03.640]  children i see now we place your brothers in institutions where they'll be properly cared for
[1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:09.960]  you can go back to your job soon i'll arrange to have a hell open for you but i'm kidding my job
[1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:15.080]  i'm not going anywhere now you're going to the hospital too well and you mean they're going
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:22.520]  to stop me from having children ever exactly i'm all right i tell you i won't go to any hospital
[1:38:22.520 --> 1:38:26.440]  we don't want any trouble with you young woman if you refuse to go the officer here will take
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:34.200]  you by force in 1910 the us eugenics record office was set up by then the british had created the
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:40.280]  first network of social workers expressly to serve as spies and enforcers of the eugenics
[1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:47.560]  race cult that was rapidly taking control of western society the social workers would decide
[1:38:47.560 --> 1:38:53.240]  who would have their children taken away who would be sterilized and in some cases who would be
[1:38:53.240 --> 1:39:03.240]  quietly murdered
[1:39:05.080 --> 1:39:11.400]  in 1911 the rockefeller family exports eugenics to germany by bankrolling the kaiser velhelm
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:18.680]  institute which later would form a central pillar in the third rike at the 1912 international
[1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:25.160]  eugenics conference in london eugenics becomes an international craze and gains superstar status

[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:48.680]  through contested schools churches and its state fairs churches competed in contest with big cash
[1:40:48.680 --> 1:40:56.200]  prizes to see who could best implement eugenics into their sermons major denominations then tell

[1:47:08.120 --> 1:47:17.000]  network network by 1936 germany had become the world leader in eugenics for taking effective
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:24.520]  actions to sterilize and euthanize hundreds of thousands of victims the big three of american
[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:29.880]  eugenics davinport loflin and gulf were dispatched by the rockefellers to germany
[1:47:29.880 --> 1:47:33.880]  where they advised the nazis on the fine tuning of their extermination system
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:42.440]  with the strong support of the us in england germany had gone over the edge and tens of millions
[1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:51.960]  would pay with their lives at the end of the war the allies protected from prosecution the very
[1:47:51.960 --> 1:48:00.920]  nazi scientist that had tortured thousands of people to death the nazi brand of eugenics had
[1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:08.760]  embarrassed the elites but they had no intention of stopping their plans the allies literally
[1:48:08.760 --> 1:48:14.440]  fought with each other over who would get top nazi eugenicist it did matter of the ss doctors
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:21.480]  had tortured tens of thousands to death they were free to go the angel of death joseph mingala
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:28.760]  and his boss atmar von versher were not prosecuted and von versher even continued his work in germany
[1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:35.880]  after the war eugenicist were angry that their great work had been exposed they then scrambled
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:42.840]  to camouflage their agenda eugenics quarterly became social biology the american birth control
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:52.280]  league became planned parenthood new terms like transhumanism population control sustainability
[1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:58.440]  conservation and environmentalism replaced racial hygiene and social Darwinism
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:09.080]  many eugenicists of the previous period engaged in what they called crypto eugenics
[1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:15.800]  purposely taking their eugenics beliefs underground they became highly respected anthropologist
[1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:27.880]  biologist and geneticist in the post war world the allies then smuggled thousands of nazi
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:34.040]  scientists out of germany and placed them in key scientific positions ranging from bio weapons
[1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:42.440]  to rocketry throughout the military industrial complex the founder of ibm was a devout follower
[1:49:42.440 --> 1:49:51.240]  of hitler thomas j watson had supplied his punch card computers and ibm technicians to the nazis
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:58.680]  for use in the death camps tattoos on camp victims were ibm human identification numbers
[1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:05.880]  which fed into the computers ibm had used similar punch card systems as early as 1928 in a jamaican
[1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:14.040]  race mixing study the first real computers were literally invented by a eugenicist for eugenics
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:23.320]  un chieftain and unrepentant eugenicist julian huxley argued that since the leaders of eugenics
[1:50:23.320 --> 1:50:28.440]  had founded the environmental and conservation movements that they should be used as vehicles
[1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:35.640]  in the formation of a world government just as hg wells had envisioned this government
[1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:41.640]  would be controlled by a scientific dictatorship and would be guided by the principles of eugenics
[1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:48.840]  huxley created the world wildlife fund with bilderberg founder and former ss officer prince
[1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:57.560]  Bernhard of the netherlands and prince philip of england in the event that i am reincarnated
[1:50:57.560 --> 1:51:03.160]  i would like to return as a deadly virus in order to contribute something to solve over population
[1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:08.520]  prince philip reported by deutsche press agenture dpa august 1988
[1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:16.360]  oldest huxley author of brave new world and brother of julian huxley gave a speech at berkeley
[1:51:16.360 --> 1:51:24.280]  in 1962 shortly before his death he admitted that his best-selling book brave new world
[1:51:24.280 --> 1:51:34.680]  written in 1932 was based not on fiction but on what the elite were actually planning to implement
[1:51:35.080 --> 1:51:44.920]  and here i would like briefly to to compare what the parable of brave new world with
[1:51:44.920 --> 1:51:52.280]  another parable which was put forth more recently in george orwell's book 1984
[1:51:52.280 --> 1:52:00.200]  i'm inclined to think that the scientific dictatorships of the future and i think
[1:52:00.200 --> 1:52:05.640]  they're going to be scientific dictatorships in many parts of the world will be probably
[1:52:05.640 --> 1:52:13.480]  a goodie nearer to the brave new world pattern than to the 1984 pattern they will be a goodie
[1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:20.440]  nearer not because of any humanitarian qualms in the scientific dictators but simply because
[1:52:20.440 --> 1:52:26.040]  the brave new world pattern is probably a good deal more efficient than the other but if you can
[1:52:26.680 --> 1:52:32.600]  get people to consent to the state of affairs in which they are living the state of servitude the
[1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:38.760]  state of being well it seems to me that the the nature of the ultimate revolution with which
[1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:47.160]  we are now faced is precisely this that we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques
[1:52:47.160 --> 1:52:56.200]  techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy who have always existed and presumably
[1:52:56.200 --> 1:53:06.120]  always will exist to get people actually to love their servitude people can be made
[1:53:06.920 --> 1:53:14.760]  to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to enjoy and
[1:53:14.760 --> 1:53:24.680]  that these methods i i think are a real refinement on the older methods of terror because they combine
[1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:32.280]  methods of terror with methods of acceptance but then there are the various other methods which
[1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:38.120]  one can think of there is for example the pharmacological method this this was one of the things
[1:53:38.120 --> 1:53:49.320]  i i talked about in brave new world and the result would be that i mean you can imagine a euphoric
[1:53:49.320 --> 1:53:55.320]  which would make people thoroughly happy even in the most abominable circumstances i mean
[1:53:55.320 --> 1:54:00.520]  these things are possible
[1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:09.560]  the elite have left a massive wave of destruction behind them as they cold-bloodedly experiment
[1:54:09.560 --> 1:54:17.880]  on civilian populations as if we are lab rats a string of congressional investigations has
[1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:23.320]  uncovered more than 20 000 secret tests that were carried out against the american people
[1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:32.920]  between 1910 and 2000 one well-known eugenics study the tuskegee syphilis project killed
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:41.800]  hundreds of blacks and spanned 40 years until whistleblowers exposed it in 1972 from 1943 until
[1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:47.240]  present the british have tested lethal nerve gas on their own personnel on land air and sea
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:52.520]  many died instantly still others died grueling deaths over several years
[1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:59.960]  the federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non
[1:54:59.960 --> 1:55:06.520]  consenting patients hundreds of hospitals in the us injected healthy men women and children
[1:55:06.520 --> 1:55:13.080]  with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non therapeutic to lethal killing many
[1:55:13.080 --> 1:55:22.760]  of the test subjects pregnant wives of gis were given vitamins by base doctors that actually
[1:55:22.760 --> 1:55:30.760]  consisted of highly radioactive uranium 239 and plutonium 241 resulting in violent miscarriages
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:45.800]  and the death of the mothers soldiers sailors and marines were used as guinea pigs and hundreds
[1:55:45.800 --> 1:55:54.200]  of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests patriotic americans were radiated side by side with lab
[1:55:54.200 --> 1:56:05.640]  animals
[1:56:05.640 --> 1:56:21.560]  pilots were forced to repeatedly fly through mushroom clouds of dna destroying radiation
[1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:36.920]  from 1951 to 1961 the u.s. army paid israel's health ministry three million lira to conduct
[1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:43.160]  radiation testing on sephardic children that immigrated to israel the government run public
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:47.800]  schools would tell the children that they were going to get a medical checkup and that they
[1:56:47.800 --> 1:57:05.800]  were receiving an x-ray the pentagon had already radiated more than four thousand institutionalized
[1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:12.360]  children in the united states many of which had died more than a hundred and ten thousand of the
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:19.960]  darker skinned jews were given 35 000 times the maximum dose of x-rays to the head repeatedly
[1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:25.960]  many of the children died within months all of them lost their hair some still live today
[1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:33.640]  and endure excruciating health problems the covert testing of chemical biological and
[1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:41.560]  radiological agents on unsuspecting populations continues worldwide today from 1940 to 1979
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:46.920]  the vast majority of the british population was sprayed by aircraft more than 2000 times
