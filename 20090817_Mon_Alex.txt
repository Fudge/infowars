[02:28.320 --> 02:35.520]  Tarpley on for an hour and then surprise guest I will just leave it at
[02:35.520 --> 02:43.840]  that very excited about this surprise guest today yes I'm building up a bit
[02:43.840 --> 02:50.040]  of suspense but also the past I've announced a big guest and the people
[02:50.040 --> 02:53.800]  kind of called up and tried to sabotage the interview so that's the main reason
[02:53.800 --> 03:01.640]  I don't announce big guest but it also has the added surprise of the fact that
[03:01.640 --> 03:10.080]  it is a surprise a treat we like giving the listeners treats we like treats
[03:10.080 --> 03:15.560]  surprises are fun I was a kid my dad about once a month would take me to see
[03:15.560 --> 03:19.320]  a movie but he never tell me we're going to a movie sometimes it would be he'd
[03:19.320 --> 03:22.280]  say come on with me where we go and I'll tell you later it'd be the grocery
[03:22.280 --> 03:27.000]  store or it'd be the shooting range or he'd say oh we're driving out to go
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.400]  dove hunting on on this dove lease out here or we're going water skiing or
[03:32.400 --> 03:38.800]  we're gonna go fishing or but about once a month we're going to see a movie or
[03:38.800 --> 03:41.560]  she wouldn't tell me that we pulled up the movie theater and then it'd be a
[03:41.560 --> 03:46.240]  surprise what movie it was so maybe that's why I like surprises some people
[03:46.240 --> 03:50.240]  had bad surprises in their life and they don't like any surprises you know even
[03:50.240 --> 03:55.720]  with bad things happen to me now it's kind of like a neat surprise oh look
[03:55.720 --> 03:59.080]  guys are waiting for me in the parking lot oh one just punched me in the nose
[03:59.080 --> 04:06.160]  this is kind of a fun surprise maybe I'm just a sick person maybe that's all it
[04:06.160 --> 04:11.080]  is because then I get to give them a surprise see
[04:11.080 --> 04:18.320]  oh life is so wondrous so magical so incredible and you never know what is
[04:18.320 --> 04:25.480]  going to happen next but I guess my ancestors were adventurers were trail

[08:55.880 --> 09:00.120]  residence a close friend of Michelle Obama says the president is furious at
[09:00.120 --> 09:05.000]  his mother-in-law after learning what she is practicing san aria an African
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.840]  spirit cult in the White House ladies and gentlemen maybe we should get text
[09:09.840 --> 09:14.560]  Mars to pop in the next few days for a quick interview on this subject it is a
[09:14.560 --> 09:24.040]  fact on record that Obama carries bizarre charms in his pocket connected to
[09:24.040 --> 09:31.080]  cults in India Africa and the Middle East all sorts of bizarre san aria
[09:31.080 --> 09:36.480]  connected but hey Tony Blair's wife the former British Prime Minister admittedly
[09:36.480 --> 09:43.760]  is a practicing witch and practices all sorts of possession and even BBC reported
[09:43.760 --> 09:48.440]  that Tony Blair practice is being possessed by different spirits and
[09:48.440 --> 09:54.240]  flops around on the floor you cannot make this up he he flops around like out
[09:54.240 --> 09:58.720]  of the exorcist and is possessed by the spirit of light or the light giver
[09:58.720 --> 10:03.400]  doesn't call it Lucifer just calls it light giver light bearer that's of
[10:03.400 --> 10:08.120]  course the name of Lucifer is proper name so you can't make this up I mean
[10:08.120 --> 10:13.520]  you read the United Nations biological diversity assessment treaty and it says
[10:13.520 --> 10:18.760]  that they want to return the earth to a pagan religion of with human sacrifice
[10:18.760 --> 10:24.680]  look I know it sounds insane it is insane I'm not the one doing this people
[10:24.680 --> 10:32.120]  think I'm nuts because I'm the one reporting it I had a top geologist and
[10:32.120 --> 10:36.840]  best-selling author on yesterday from Australia never heard of me
[10:36.840 --> 10:43.560]  breaking down the giant eugenesis cult the death cult that runs everything their
[10:43.560 --> 10:48.680]  master plan for a world government you can read all these different books and
[10:48.680 --> 10:53.640]  State Department of Random's this is really what they believe this is really
[10:53.640 --> 10:59.200]  what they are pushing it is not a joke it is not a game and see people will see
[10:59.200 --> 11:05.760]  this article about san aria in the winehouse which is voodoo it's all it
[11:05.760 --> 11:12.920]  this is voodoo light it's white magic voodoo san aria is white magic voodoo
[11:12.920 --> 11:18.960]  voodoo as it's known as practice in the Caribbean is the black magic version of
[11:18.960 --> 11:23.080]  san aria okay for people that don't understand this people get confused by
[11:23.080 --> 11:28.980]  it that's all that's all and in and invariably the wackos that practice it
[11:28.980 --> 11:32.600]  get mad at somebody even if they're a white witch and end up doing the bat
[11:32.600 --> 11:37.880]  the bad stuff and when I say that I mean in their view my view it's all bad but
[11:37.880 --> 11:43.520]  this is the way their whacked out system works they are the most unhappy well
[11:43.520 --> 11:47.680]  just any country that adopts san aria goes directly down the rat holes
[11:47.680 --> 11:53.600]  directly down the toilet I mean if you want sewage rolling down the streets
[11:53.600 --> 11:56.600]  and chickens running around the streets and starving kids and people dressed up
[11:56.600 --> 12:03.160]  and skeleton outfits you want to live in Haiti or the worst parts of the
[12:03.160 --> 12:08.360]  Dominican Republic or other parts of the world other other armpits and but I
[12:08.360 --> 12:12.120]  mean that's what our country is I mean Hillary was doing seances in the
[12:12.120 --> 12:17.120]  winehouse Reagan every decision he made was run by an astrologer that's just a
[12:17.120 --> 12:23.960]  gateway into white magic more quackery more buffoonery more more idiocy these
[12:23.960 --> 12:30.040]  people make me sick and please don't send me 10,000 emails saying not all of
[12:30.040 --> 12:35.720]  its darker evil or occultic whatever I'm talking about the elite what they're
[12:35.720 --> 12:45.520]  into is Satan worship most strata's of the new order of Satan worship and then
[12:45.520 --> 12:49.200]  at the very top crust it's Lucifer worship and they're just a bunch of
[12:49.200 --> 12:54.680]  unhappy power tripping greedy selfish people and that's why they haven't
[12:54.680 --> 12:59.680]  found the real power and you just look at them they just radiate weakness but
[12:59.680 --> 13:03.920]  because they are weak inherently they try to mass power and and and federal
[13:03.920 --> 13:08.120]  military around them and try to control your life and they hate people with real
[13:08.120 --> 13:14.080]  power the power of life the power of creation the power of the universe I
[13:14.080 --> 13:20.040]  mean it isn't even a comparison the power of goodness compared to the power of
[13:20.040 --> 13:28.200]  evil I always liken it to cancer of cancer in a human body if it had a
[13:28.200 --> 13:32.800]  consciousness which it doesn't but if it had a consciousness it would imagine
[13:32.800 --> 13:35.520]  that it was having victory after victory that it was running through the
[13:35.520 --> 13:42.360]  flesh taking over systems doing whatever it wants raining but soon it kills the
[13:42.360 --> 13:48.320]  host it's like a dog dragging a 200 pound tick the tick is gonna kill its host
[13:48.320 --> 13:55.280]  and then die itself and that you know the tick will greedily keep sucking the
[13:55.280 --> 14:01.480]  blood as it injects the anti-coagulant into the flesh and it you know it will
[14:01.480 --> 14:06.840]  hold on with its mandibles if you try to dislodge it and whisper to you that
[14:06.840 --> 14:10.920]  it's doing it for your own good and it loves you and don't be mean don't be
[14:10.920 --> 14:16.400]  abusive be sweet to it you know it it's loving and good it gave you everything
[14:16.400 --> 14:25.840]  you have you're gonna die if you dislodge the tick and most societies most
[14:25.840 --> 14:34.000]  cultures allow the tick to stay on but true goodness true wholesomeness must be
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.960]  willing to stand up to the tick but the problem is the tick intimidates people
[14:39.960 --> 14:54.440]  and says go along with me and I'll not eat you but in the end the tick does the
[14:54.440 --> 14:59.760]  Valerie I mean I told you Michelle Obama is a Satan worshiper I can take one
[14:59.760 --> 15:03.960]  look at her eyes it's like I can look at Alistair Crowley's eyes are Tony Blair's
[15:03.960 --> 15:11.200]  eyes or Sherry Blair's eyes or any of these people and they are just smoldering
[15:11.200 --> 15:18.840]  and burning with Satanism I've said publicly on air Michelle Obama is far
[15:18.840 --> 15:25.240]  more evil than Barack Obama far more evil Barack Obama's more narcissistic
[15:25.240 --> 15:33.320]  and on a mindless power trip he's mainly into being an overachiever and being
[15:33.320 --> 15:44.200]  patted on the head by elites though he does like destroying good wholesome
[15:44.200 --> 15:49.040]  societies because that's part of his dominance but but Obama is able to sell
[15:49.040 --> 15:54.880]  evil better because he doesn't burn with a pure Luciferian light now Michelle
[15:54.880 --> 16:00.760]  Obama has a satanic light Treasury Secretary you could say I see their
[16:00.760 --> 16:05.280]  auras folks but I mean that just off their off studying these people if you
[16:05.280 --> 16:10.840]  look at Treasury Secretary former Treasury Secretary snow that is someone
[16:10.840 --> 16:16.600]  absolutely possessed with Luciferian energy I mean I every time I see that
[16:16.600 --> 16:19.720]  guy even on television I have to actually step back because you're looking
[16:19.720 --> 16:26.440]  Donald Rumsfeld has that energy but is able to cloak it a bit better snow just
[16:26.440 --> 16:34.480]  sees with it absolutely seething with it Treasury Secretary Paulson Henry
[16:34.480 --> 16:38.400]  Paulson former Treasury Secretary he is so overtaken with it he is just wrecked
[16:38.400 --> 16:44.080]  he is in another place he is meditating whenever he is at a podium he's not even
[16:44.080 --> 16:48.800]  there he is so possessed by it he isn't even in this plane anymore that's
[16:48.800 --> 16:54.280]  somebody who's been completely taken off and I know you don't believe this folks
[16:54.280 --> 17:03.880]  they believe it okay I I know you don't believe but see they believe it even if
[17:03.880 --> 17:06.920]  you're an atheist and you don't believe in good and evil you don't believe in
[17:06.920 --> 17:11.360]  different spiritual forces in this universe you're flying along on a giant
[17:11.360 --> 17:15.920]  planetoid orbiting a Sun in deep space there's magic and incredible energy all
[17:15.920 --> 17:26.000]  around you fools the fool has said in his heart there is no God and there are
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.720]  spiritual forces alive and operating in this dimension and other dimensions all
[17:31.720 --> 17:37.280]  around us there's no doubt no doubt about that but even if you don't believe in
[17:37.280 --> 17:41.920]  any of that every globalist I've ever run into or whose literature I've read
[17:41.920 --> 17:48.080]  Dr. Pionka at UT who says he wants to kill 90% of us on the UT website he's
[17:48.080 --> 17:53.840]  dressed in a juridic robe talking about Lucifer I mean you know with a Merlin
[17:53.840 --> 18:01.200]  staff with a Saramans I mean these people these people mean business folks
[18:01.200 --> 18:06.560]  they want to kill you period it is the it is the greatest exercise of power is
[18:06.560 --> 18:11.560]  to kill that's why you read the writings of linen he said I want a world
[18:11.560 --> 18:15.280]  government so that we can then develop a scientific weapon to destroy the earth
[18:15.280 --> 18:21.880]  and the Sun my one goal you can pull his poetry up his one goal written in the
[18:21.880 --> 18:25.760]  teens before he even had the revolution I think was one horrible poem was written
[18:25.760 --> 18:30.000]  in 1915 three or four years before he took over Russia about how he wanted to
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.840]  have created a scientific dictatorship and destroy earth I mean these people
[18:33.840 --> 18:41.680]  are I want to destroy you it's like Hellraiser event horizon hole in the in

[18:56.840 --> 19:02.080]  bodies and stinking dead corpses and people in black uniforms and marching
[19:02.080 --> 19:07.960]  around all with their eyes alight with death and hell oh and they tell you to
[19:07.960 --> 19:11.800]  stand down and they tell you to go along with them you cannot go along with
[19:11.800 --> 19:16.200]  them you cannot give in to them any army that wears a black uniform as an

[24:00.120 --> 24:08.280]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[24:11.720 --> 24:17.400]  all right I got sidetracked with a story about witchcraft in the winehouse and
[24:17.400 --> 24:27.520]  people can read this but if they don't know that all of the elite every single
[24:27.520 --> 24:34.720]  prominent member of the Democratic Party or the Labor Party in England that we've
[24:34.720 --> 24:38.840]  ever researched is heavily into the occult and then many Republicans and
[24:38.840 --> 24:42.760]  conservatives are members of skull and bones or different spin-offs of that and
[24:42.760 --> 24:47.360]  bohemian Grove and what do they do with skull and bones they have homosexual sex
[24:47.360 --> 24:53.440]  they worship Lucifer they kneel before someone dressed as Lucifer king of the
[24:53.440 --> 25:00.320]  world that is now publicly mainstream news ABC news admit it and conservatives
[25:00.320 --> 25:04.280]  whenever Bush is in office or they're like well you know that's just fraternity
[25:04.280 --> 25:09.160]  fun oh really and then his old men they go and do it too well it's kind of
[25:09.160 --> 25:13.760]  Christian for men to have sex in the woods and you know to worship Lucifer
[25:13.760 --> 25:23.440]  and to kneel before Molek so I'm not the one that's weird reporting on this they're
[25:23.440 --> 25:27.200]  the ones that are out of their minds so we need Watson or Steve Watson or Paul
[25:27.200 --> 25:31.880]  Watson or Kurt or Aaron or somebody to get to do a boil down occultism and
[25:31.880 --> 25:39.000]  politics and just go over it because these politicians really believe that
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  Satan is the God of this world they believe that again there's two different
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.920]  camps the Satanist and the Luciferians and there's a little bit of go between
[25:46.920 --> 25:50.840]  and when you actually get into higher level Luciferianism they lie to people
[25:50.840 --> 25:56.240]  and say oh we're loving oh we believe Lucifer's really Jesus but then they
[25:56.240 --> 26:01.720]  say though Lucifer does want us to kill the majority of the earth so they also
[26:01.720 --> 26:07.480]  lie it's all about deception and they really have just deceived themselves
[26:07.480 --> 26:11.680]  but I'll get into that later
[26:15.200 --> 26:21.720]  when you don't have Jeremiah Wright saying GD America you got grandma getting
[26:21.720 --> 26:27.840]  possessed by the devil spirits can you imagine the wild dancing the voodoo
[26:27.840 --> 26:32.320]  going in on there remember the Rolling Stones that time they got caught doing
[26:32.320 --> 26:36.520]  voodoo and a dead kid was there dead like 11 or 12 but they didn't get in
[26:36.520 --> 26:42.200]  trouble for it famous case that was in New York but they had strings to pull
[26:42.200 --> 26:46.960]  now you got a dead kid and some goat heads severed and blot everywhere what's
[26:46.960 --> 26:55.880]  the big deal I mean it's all in the seeking after the power to really show
[26:55.880 --> 27:04.340]  you got what it takes kill some innocent and see it's their religious sacrament to
[27:04.340 --> 27:13.400]  inject you with the cancer viruses and the adjuvants that cause brain damage
[27:13.400 --> 27:17.680]  when you get your Alzheimer's or your Gilean grenades or your muscular
[27:17.680 --> 27:23.640]  dystrophy all the hundreds of different brain disorders they give you it's all
[27:23.640 --> 27:31.560]  part of the sacrifice the wars are part of the sacrifice it's all part of the
[27:31.560 --> 27:40.160]  establishment showing themselves and their peers and their God that they're
[27:40.160 --> 27:45.360]  gonna give blood sacrifice in the Aztecs and the Mayans and the Babylonians and
[27:45.360 --> 27:53.860]  the Romans and the Egyptians and the the Vandals the Germans the Gauls the
[27:53.860 --> 28:07.320]  Norse they all do it the British the Scots every human culture plunges jaggers
[28:07.320 --> 28:13.760]  into babies and rips their guts and hearts out every culture does it every
[28:13.760 --> 28:18.640]  culture piles the dead bodies up in the sun and throws women and children into
[28:18.640 --> 28:23.560]  freezing water with the stones tied around them or throws them into fiery
[28:23.560 --> 28:30.760]  bonfires bonfires till their heads pop and most cultures pull the meat out after
[28:30.760 --> 28:36.720]  it's cooked properly and devour their own children with pleasure and what it is
[28:36.720 --> 28:40.680]  is sick cultures were the most degenerate control freaks get into
[28:40.680 --> 28:46.200]  control cow those of us that don't have their wicked spirit and then start
[28:46.200 --> 28:52.120]  feeding on us when will we rise up and smash the enemy when we rise up with
[28:52.120 --> 28:57.480]  righteousness and grab the neural order by its snake-like throat and crush it
[28:57.480 --> 29:02.920]  crush the head of the snake and truly build towards the stars but no cultures
[29:02.920 --> 29:06.480]  of evil set in and the minute you let control freaks and evil people get
[29:06.480 --> 29:11.280]  control it immediately races to the bottom the worse the most degenerate
[29:11.280 --> 29:16.560]  the most psychopathic the most sadistic of their numbers soon get into power and
[29:16.560 --> 29:24.320]  then it's all part of topping the last person first they sell you the evil and
[29:24.320 --> 29:29.280]  darkness is sexy and the weak are attracted to it like moss and flame
[29:29.280 --> 29:35.040]  then they build an army of weak scum and turn them against the righteous and the
[29:35.040 --> 29:40.160]  upright and the righteous and the upright stand down and let the weak
[29:40.160 --> 29:46.480]  cowardly lesser people run all over us it's time to activate it's time to
[29:46.480 --> 29:53.160]  rise it's time to destroy the new world order we're on the march the empires on

[33:37.440 --> 33:44.440]  economy when I saw the numbers that Congress put out last week as of
[33:44.440 --> 33:57.680]  August 11th Americans worked eight months or over half the year just to pay
[33:57.680 --> 34:05.360]  federal state and local taxes I mean they're already getting 60 plus percent
[34:05.360 --> 34:12.160]  of your money and they the OECD the organization of economic and cooperative
[34:12.160 --> 34:17.520]  development a big bank receivership arms set up during the Marshall plan for
[34:17.520 --> 34:21.800]  World War two but it's just a private banking receivership arm designed to
[34:21.800 --> 34:29.120]  take over countries the OECD says they want an 85 plus percent tax rate
[34:29.120 --> 34:34.920]  worldwide under world government rule and that of course is what time magazine
[34:34.920 --> 34:38.760]  and the financial Times of London and the Wall Street Journal and hundreds of
[34:38.760 --> 34:43.200]  other publications have said in the last year that to fix the economic crisis
[34:43.200 --> 34:47.880]  the banks created they want a new bank of the world that we all pay our carbon
[34:47.880 --> 34:53.160]  taxes and other taxes to and an 80 plus percent tax rate and tax rates and
[34:53.160 --> 35:00.000]  interest rates and currency rates set by a private banking cartel so they can
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.320]  game the markets even more and vertically integrate things through their
[35:03.320 --> 35:09.040]  crony capitalist model they socialize us they socialize the risk privatize the
[35:09.040 --> 35:14.280]  profit they socialize our lives to make us dependent on them but then you have
[35:14.280 --> 35:20.000]  private families that then own the majority of the planet can you and the
[35:20.000 --> 35:25.360]  death panels the euthanasia it's all in there you read the panels they want to
[35:25.360 --> 35:29.760]  set up then you go read what those panels are in the bioethesis boards and
[35:29.760 --> 35:34.680]  it is death panels Europe has it Tom Daschle wrote a book saying it and the
[35:34.680 --> 35:45.720]  people know their liars it's like when Obama says there is no just like when
[35:45.720 --> 35:49.120]  Obama comes out and says there are no gun control bills biggest gun control
[35:49.120 --> 35:53.800]  bills ever is like he says there is no cap and trade there is no tax he says
[35:53.800 --> 35:58.720]  this is not a tax when the whole thing is a giant 1300 page tax admittedly on
[35:58.720 --> 36:04.360]  record they just stonewall you and stonewall you they stonewall all of us
[36:04.360 --> 36:09.520]  so the debate is always about whether it exists or not instead of about do we
[36:09.520 --> 36:17.200]  want this and again it's a military tactic it's a military tactic to say
[36:17.200 --> 36:22.920]  you are not being assault you are not under assault they will broadcast that a
[36:22.920 --> 36:28.760]  peace deal has been signed while they bomb your country they will do it they
[36:28.760 --> 36:34.920]  will broadcast over your radio transmissions in a real war that your
[36:34.920 --> 36:39.120]  forces are losing and that a deal has been signed they will broadcast in your
[36:39.120 --> 36:44.240]  own language with your own codes that your commanders have told you to stand
[36:44.240 --> 36:51.800]  down or that your commanders have told you to surrender this is military this
[36:51.800 --> 36:57.400]  is one-on-one military conflict our government has been seized by offshore
[36:57.400 --> 37:03.080]  banks offshore corporations engaged in hardcore black propaganda black info
[37:03.080 --> 37:11.240]  war propaganda is a neutral term it just means information supporting your
[37:11.240 --> 37:15.800]  political or worldview white propaganda uses the truth it's the most powerful
[37:15.800 --> 37:20.160]  type but when you're lying criminals you're forced to use black propaganda
[37:20.160 --> 37:25.360]  and gray propaganda what is black propaganda there's millions of forms of
[37:25.360 --> 37:35.760]  it here's one used against me the feds come out knowing they're totally
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.320]  discredited and so they say I'm a fed all day and it's just meant to confuse
[37:40.320 --> 37:44.720]  people to moralize people and to keep people from moving forward as leaders
[37:44.720 --> 37:48.480]  and taking action when we're starting to have huge victories because it's black
[37:48.480 --> 37:53.760]  propaganda because it's a lie it isn't based in common sense or history or any
[37:53.760 --> 38:00.520]  studying or understanding of how things work but for ignorant people just now
[38:00.520 --> 38:09.520]  waking up black propaganda is effective now what is an example of white
[38:09.520 --> 38:16.320]  propaganda white propaganda is reading the different bill numbers on air where
[38:16.320 --> 38:20.640]  it states that it allows the attorney general to ban any handguns or rifles
[38:20.640 --> 38:25.080]  he wants with the stroke of a pin we've given those bill numbers white
[38:25.080 --> 38:30.560]  propaganda would be two three years ago when they were lying and saying that the
[38:30.560 --> 38:34.280]  Senate bill didn't was not amnesty but it was secret and the public couldn't see
[38:34.280 --> 38:38.480]  it and then senator sessions engaged in white propaganda he released the bill
[38:38.480 --> 38:42.240]  and gotten trouble for it under Senate rules he wasn't supposed to but
[38:42.240 --> 38:46.640]  everybody saw the bill and found out it was worse than amnesty it legalized all
[38:46.640 --> 38:50.000]  illegal aliens including felonies and allowed them to bring their family
[38:50.000 --> 38:57.800]  members here for six years until it was supposedly going to be revoted on that's
[38:57.800 --> 39:07.760]  white propaganda one of the biggest forms of black propaganda is to simply
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.200]  state there is no new world order as the globalists write hundreds of books
[39:12.200 --> 39:15.800]  hundreds of white papers really thousands of white papers giant university
[39:15.800 --> 39:20.720]  reports open announcements CFR publicly writing the laws that Congress passes
[39:20.720 --> 39:23.840]  Royal Institute of International Affairs writing the laws that parliament
[39:23.840 --> 39:32.600]  passes in England then saying there's no new world order it's very childlike
[39:32.600 --> 39:37.280]  level propaganda they use but the public is at a childlike level of
[39:37.280 --> 39:39.720]  understanding
[39:43.600 --> 39:50.640]  okay I'm ranting here we've got a bunch of guests coming up today including a
[39:50.640 --> 39:57.160]  surprise guest in the last hour we have a tarp like coming on about eugenics and
[39:57.160 --> 40:03.720]  about Obama plunging the approval ratings three points last week I never
[40:03.720 --> 40:07.960]  before happened to a president three points in one week in a bunch of
[40:07.960 --> 40:19.880]  different mainline polls so we've got that going on and I've got this I've
[40:19.880 --> 40:26.440]  got this militia individuals coming on called pale horse that the media has
[40:26.440 --> 40:31.400]  been showing a lot of the guy wearing a stocking over his face with an army
[40:31.400 --> 40:35.200]  helmet on top of it seems like a friendly fellow on the phone but we'll
[40:35.200 --> 40:39.280]  talk about his message and you'll get to hear him unedited by the mainstream
[40:39.280 --> 40:46.160]  media coming up in the next hour and I have some suggestions for mr. mr. pale
[40:46.160 --> 40:56.360]  horse as well so that is coming up I I really should have gotten into our top
[40:56.360 --> 41:02.120]  news right at the start of the show but just the sheer magnitude and importance
[41:02.120 --> 41:09.280]  of it really dumbfound me I can't believe it's happening exactly precisely the
[41:09.280 --> 41:14.720]  way I said it would man being this right folks and understanding the enemy to
[41:14.720 --> 41:18.600]  this level and then knowing they're just going to go on committing their crimes
[41:18.600 --> 41:22.760]  in plain view and knowing the government or eugenicists knowing their
[41:22.760 --> 41:26.400]  spraying us with barium salts and aluminum dioxide they admit they are now
[41:26.400 --> 41:31.080]  wall street journal associated press laughing at us knowing they're putting
[41:31.080 --> 41:37.640]  cancer viruses and brain damaging chemicals like adjuvants in all the
[41:37.640 --> 41:41.280]  major shots having their own documents where they're doing it on purpose and
[41:41.280 --> 41:50.120]  laughing about it it freaks me out I don't even know what to say anymore
[41:50.120 --> 41:56.000]  knowing that it's all real knowing I was right all these years I wish I was
[41:56.000 --> 42:03.360]  wrong I'm sick of doing this I'm sick of not being able to tear myself away from
[42:03.360 --> 42:09.400]  it and I and I'm sick of the problems it causes you know nobody's perfect but I
[42:09.400 --> 42:16.840]  need to be with my children more and I've got work I've got to do I've got a
[42:16.840 --> 42:20.640]  bunch of projects I'm working on a bunch of places I've got to fly in the next
[42:20.640 --> 42:25.720]  two weeks and I'm not whining and complaining I'm just saying that I want
[42:25.720 --> 42:33.840]  this nightmare to end I'm not in a one-upsmanship with the new world order
[42:33.840 --> 42:38.760]  and all these corrupt people my ego less and less is in it I don't have any
[42:38.760 --> 42:42.840]  other word to describe it so I'll use it I'm not in a pissing contest with
[42:42.840 --> 42:48.200]  anybody anymore in the past I did have more ego involved in this it was a
[42:48.200 --> 42:50.640]  little bit of a macho thing I mean I was doing it for the right reasons my
[42:50.640 --> 42:53.920]  heart was in the right spot but I'm going through changes right now and I
[42:53.920 --> 43:00.080]  know all of you are too it's a quickening of the spirit and tapping into
[43:00.080 --> 43:03.920]  this level of knowledge tapping into this level of understanding tapping into
[43:03.920 --> 43:08.760]  this level of love and then actually this level of discernment and seeing
[43:08.760 --> 43:13.560]  what I've been in the past and what I am it's just so huge that I'm
[43:13.560 --> 43:19.040]  speechless I I almost want to just go wander around in fact that's what the
[43:19.040 --> 43:24.000]  instinct is the drive the spiritual drive is to go to the countryside to get
[43:24.000 --> 43:32.760]  out of this because it's just the information is so incredible like I
[43:32.760 --> 43:35.720]  want to take a break a few minutes I'm gonna come back and cover all these
[43:35.720 --> 43:39.240]  public officials coming out saying the government's planning martial law to use
[43:39.240 --> 43:44.640]  a stage flu outbreak to do it the incredible success of the Joker poster
[43:44.640 --> 43:47.320]  contest on so many levels is indescribable I want to thank all of you
[43:47.320 --> 43:54.680]  that have been involved I just can't believe I'm in this position I it's
[43:54.680 --> 43:59.000]  also an over-driving understanding of that I'm not worthy to be in this
[43:59.000 --> 44:08.960]  position of leadership hi and by the spirit of resistance this tyranny the
[44:08.960 --> 44:16.920]  spirit of I mean it is this the Holy Spirit is is is is so strong against
[44:16.920 --> 44:21.520]  this evil that it's to a level I've never even experienced and and then I
[44:21.520 --> 44:25.440]  realize that there is a whole nother level that that that literally my flesh
[44:25.440 --> 44:29.920]  is almost holding back from from from taking me over I just can't even
[44:29.920 --> 44:35.960]  describe this play renegades John I gotta take a few minute break here and

[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  When it comes to heroes, renegade your mind
[48:01.000 --> 48:26.000]  When it comes to heroes, renegade your mind
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.000]  Up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com about the flu shot
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  The one they plan to force on every American
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.000]  That's confirmed
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  Killing large percentages of those in the trials
[48:44.000 --> 48:49.000]  I mean it's killing people fast and brain damaging and hurting others
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  But it's killing large percentages
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  Just like upwards of 25% died in Europe
[48:56.000 --> 49:01.000]  Last year during secret trials of a flu vaccine
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  And they're testing in the media
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.000]  They can just kill us in large numbers and there not even be a big deal
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.000]  See, because if the media hypes up a shark
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  Killing one person a year off the California coast
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  People stop, you know, large portions of the population
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  Stop swimming in the Pacific Ocean off California
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  One person gets killed
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  You're saying, what does that have to do with this, Alex?
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  With how they can hype fear
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.000]  See, if they don't hype the flu vaccines, killing people in mass
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  Then no one cares and people just take it and calmly die and go
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.000]  Yeah, my kid died or yeah, my daughter can't walk now and is in a wheelchair
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  She was a cheerleader last week, now she's in a wheelchair and has blood coming out her nose
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.000]  But since the media acts like it's oh good, she's dead now
[49:48.000 --> 49:54.000]  It's kind of like, oh good, people are dying, I'm still going to take it
[49:54.000 --> 49:59.000]  Oh, the Gardasil's killing all these people, good, I'm going to give my daughter that
[49:59.000 --> 50:05.000]  See, things that actually are deadly dangerous nobody cares about because the media doesn't hype it
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  And then things that aren't dangerous
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  I mean, when people are walking around in the woods at 2am
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  I've taken full grown men out with me, coyote hunting
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  They get scared in the middle of the woods at night with no flashlight
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.000]  They don't like their night vision, their own eyes turning on
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  The big secret is folks, you don't need night vision goggles, you just go stay outside for 30 minutes
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  Every person I've ever taken hunting, most people get scared out in the woods, they get spooked, it's fine
[50:31.000 --> 50:36.000]  But see, they have monsters in their psyche, so they're scared
[50:36.000 --> 50:39.000]  But meanwhile real monsters, they're not scared of
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  So see, they're testing right now, killing you out in the open and nothing happened
[50:44.000 --> 50:49.000]  This is unbelievable
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.000]  Alright, I'm going to get into all these public officials saying they're getting ready for martial law
[50:53.000 --> 51:20.000]  Under the flu, blanket, under the flu cover, and a lot more just stay with us

[52:13.000 --> 52:20.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election
[52:24.000 --> 52:29.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[52:29.000 --> 52:37.000]  Who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism
[52:37.000 --> 52:41.000]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one world government
[52:41.000 --> 52:48.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda

[54:49.000 --> 54:54.000]  And realizing we're all just individually self, part of a greater organism
[54:54.000 --> 55:02.000]  And the elite understand that, so they try to take over humanity, we are individuals acting freely that make up a greater whole
[55:02.000 --> 55:20.000]  Because the type of wicked individuals that seek to control society are the exact wrong type of psyches and souls that we need at the helm of humanity's destiny
[55:20.000 --> 55:35.000]  I don't know how anybody could be bored with life, all the wonderment, all the amazing beauty and all the ugliness, all of it, it's so amazing
[55:35.000 --> 55:56.000]  How could anybody not just be absolutely stunned by creation, how could anyone not in their very soul feel the great directive energy of God Almighty
[55:56.000 --> 56:21.000]  How could you not marvel at your consciousness, how could one not look at the stars and not see the face of God
[56:21.000 --> 56:29.000]  Instead you have the public with their souls basically sucked out of them
[56:29.000 --> 56:37.000]  Alright, here's what's going to happen, I've been waxing philosophic
[56:37.000 --> 56:50.000]  We've got this militia commander coming on who's been quite controversial in the media, Pale Horse, at 8 after we're going to go live at prisonplanet.tv in 3 minutes, 10 seconds
[56:50.000 --> 56:59.000]  When Pale Horse leaves us at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to get into all the latest developments here
[56:59.000 --> 57:09.000]  Now Dick Army, former leader of the Republicans, former House Majority Leader, Republican of Dallas, very prominent
[57:09.000 --> 57:20.000]  Warns that the government is planning to exploit a hype swine flu outbreak this fall in order to reinvigorate support behind its failing Obamacare agenda
[57:20.000 --> 57:25.000]  Congressman Brown is saying they want it for martial law, so is Ron Paul
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  And there could be no doubt, but this is indeed happening
[57:29.000 --> 57:34.000]  Now, I'm not tuning my horn, I say this so you'll pay attention to me
[57:34.000 --> 57:42.000]  I told you this in January before the flu ever broke out as the priming event to get you ready for the fall in April
[57:42.000 --> 57:48.000]  Now it's all manifesting exactly as I said, please!
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.000]  It's like telling a 5 year old, don't walk out in the street, you get run over
[57:52.000 --> 57:58.000]  I understand the enemy, please, I understand how to beat them
[57:58.000 --> 58:03.000]  And I'm going to talk about that at the bottom of the hour coming up after we get into this militia discussion
[58:03.000 --> 58:10.000]  We're going to dovetail that with all the mainstream news coming out, but dryly reporting on it
[58:10.000 --> 58:15.000]  About how the government's putting live polio in the vaccine killing people, AP
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.000]  How the government's putting live cancer viruses in the current flu shot
[58:19.000 --> 58:27.000]  Mainstream news, how it's causing degenerative brain disorders that are killing people in days they're so deadly
[58:27.000 --> 58:35.000]  I can't tell you how many people I know that go get a flu shot, have a convulsion and are paralyzed a week later and then dead a year later
[58:35.000 --> 59:01.000]  They're just killing us all over the place, we're going to talk about that, stay with us
[59:06.000 --> 59:23.000]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards
[59:23.000 --> 59:29.000]  Front site provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes
[59:29.000 --> 59:35.000]  This is real, don't miss out, secure a front site defensive handgun course
[59:35.000 --> 59:40.000]  Plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun
[59:40.000 --> 59:46.000]  Go to frontsite.com today, that's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com
[59:46.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  Go to frontsite.com for your training and free gun
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  You know one of my producers got approached by a fed last night, not going to say which one, he was at a bar by his house having a beard
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  The eye comes over, classic MO, starts talking about Alex Jones, starts talking about how he knows one of our former producers
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  It was very suspect and all this other stuff, all this inside info and just absolutely staged and started asking what we think about Obama and things here at the office
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  Again, we got feds all over us folks because we know they're planning on launching a deadly flu attack
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  They want to find one thing to march in here and take me to prison
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  And I just pray to God, I put everything in God's hands, whatever God's will is
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  If it's God's will, they kill me, God's will, they put me in prison and torture me
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  You know what, I don't even ask people to pray that God protect me
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  If it's Providence, that's the way it is, I believe I need to stay outside prison, outside the grave
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  And I want to continue my work but I'm not worried about dying, I'm not afraid of dying
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  And I don't want to leave my family unprotected but I know God
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  The only time I ask God for anything is that if I do get killed or imprisoned, then God will put up a hedge around my wife and children
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  I don't even want to get into it, I shouldn't even have talked about it, we just got feds everywhere
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  This is so criminal, man, they're so criminal
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  I mean, they know we're good, they know we're not terrorists, they know we know their bosses are terrorists
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  The banks are bankrupting America
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  Good people inside the Army sent me the Army document, how they follow me and Ron Paul around and how they go to our in the Fed events
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Then people didn't believe that document, it became national news, the Army admitted it
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  I mean, if you want to know the government's criminal folks, it's totally illegal to have the Army following us around
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  It's illegal to have the local threat integration fusion center with their informants going around
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  And this is happening to all the major we are change leaders, they go to a bar or they go to a restaurant or they go to church
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  People walk up and ask, hey, you ever thought about attacking the president?
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  I mean, I've had cops right out of central casting over and over again at the grocery store walk over
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  At a restaurant when I'm covering Bilderberg, you know, at a hotel 10 miles away
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  Hey Alex, I'm a big fan of you, you want to attack the State Department tomorrow and I'm like, leave me alone, cop
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  You know I'm nonviolent, I've even had the cops go, the feds go, well, you know, I'm just doing my job
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  And I'm like, so I, you know, I just can't handle it anymore, I'm just so sick of you
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  Listen you jackass, they're shooting your kids up with cancer viruses
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  You think it's cute? You think it's cute? The eugenicists are jacking the water and jacking you? I'm sick of it
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  How in the world do I shut up? How in the world do I not sit here and speak out and tell the truth?
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  How in the world do I go along with your crap? You stupid idiots
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  Even if you're evil, you FBI police criminals, even if you're really dark side people that deal drugs and kill people and all the other crap you do
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  Even if you are stealing drugs out of the impound department and the rest of it, this is a lot bigger than that, you fools
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  This is real, they are sticking stuff in your water
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  Do you understand how diabolical this is? This is a level of evil way above all your gangster crap
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  All above your macho societies, it's way above that, it's a thousand times darker, it's cold-blooded, it's scientific, it's religious
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  And I'm not part of the sacrament of death, I don't want to be fed into the maw of the new world order
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  But the final equation doesn't matter if I am, if it protects innocence, and I love other people's children as much as I love mine
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  I love innocence, and I love goodness, and as a man, I am here to stand up against evil
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  And that doesn't mean I'm perfect, and I'm just getting so sick of it
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  I do say this, anybody does anything to my people or my family, I do pray for people to pray that God bring justice to anybody that lays their hands on any of us
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  But I don't even need to say that prayer, you evil people have hellish lives because you are evil
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  And you're gonna learn the fear of God, you understand that?
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government doesn't own the sun yet
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  Food is your only ammunition, how much do you want? When do you want it?
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it?
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  How much will you need? We don't know
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  That even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  There is no job security. You are always in danger of losing your job
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  Unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  And he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  Involving the marketing of helpful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  And set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  It takes very little money and if you're interested
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  MZ wants to talk to you. Remember chocolate.ownmyself.com
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  The information war continues
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  We are live at prisonplanet.tv coming up in the fourth quarter of this hour
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  I'm going to get into governor's opposed DOD emergency powers
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  Multiple congressmen saying they're planning to use the flu as a martial law cover story
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  This is the governor's association
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  This is prominent members of Congress
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  This is Congressman Brown, former Republican leader Dick Armey
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  Ron Paul, current congressman
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  Folks, this is really happening
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  Criminals really do run the government
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  We're also going to get into how the flu shots are killing people in mass
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  So that's coming up
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  And then how we get the word out and stop these people
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  With grassroots campaign like the Obama poster
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  That idea, that system, is key
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  Alright, here's the bio of the individual we're about to interview for the next 30, 40 minutes or so
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  He's Pale Horse
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  His YouTube address is YouTube, Ohio Militia
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  YouTube.com, Forge Less, Ohio Militia
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Former enlisted army and founder of this section of the Northern Ohio Militia near Cleveland
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  And they train
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  It goes on to say
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Psy got hacked a couple days ago, but we still have some of his videos he's saying
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  Now, let's go ahead and play a clip of Pale Horse
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  Here it is
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  It has nothing to do with the fact that you have a black president
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  I started my group several years ago
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  Before we had a black president when Bush was in office
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  They're trying to make it look as if all of a sudden Obama's in office
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  And now all of a sudden these militants are taking up arms
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  I mean, a year ago before Obama was in office
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  There was all this stuff on YouTube
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  There was all these Myspace pages
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  Alex Jones was still doing the same thing that he's doing
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  It's all been the same
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  I'm sure more people have woken up since then
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  But, you know, it's not the way that the media is portraying us
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  Baggers, birthers, deathers, those on the outer fringe are on the rise
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  It should come as no surprise then that almost a death
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  Okay, so later we're going to play some of the actual newscast
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  Where they were demonizing him
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  And putting him up there but not really letting him finish a coherent statement
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  That way they could just use the scary sounding voice
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  To intimidate people
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  And I would think out of the thousands of militia videos that are out there
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  They probably chose Pale Horse's video
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Because the voice changer he's using to protect his identity
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  Does make it sound scary
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  And that's meant to scare little old ladies and people
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Living in their inner city crime compounds
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Pale Horse right now joining us live
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  We were able to get him on the show because he contacted us
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  Mr. Pale Horse, good to have you on with us
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  Thank you, this is an honor, definitely
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  Now, why are you not protecting your voice here on the radio?
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Well, really, you know, I get a lot of things on YouTube
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  Oh, the government knows who you are
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  You know, why are you covering your face, why are you disguising your voice
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  And really it was more, you know, I know the FBI and whoever
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  If they want to know who I am, they know who I am
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  And it was more or less as, you know, just to give the video a mystique
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  And clearly it worked because I ended up on, you know, corporate news
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Well, let me just be honest with you here out of the gates
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  I told my staff as soon as they saw this last Thursday when you emailed us
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Well, I'd seen it Tuesday and Wednesday on national television everywhere
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  But then I actually watched some of your videos even before
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  To ascertain and really assess from my research who and what you are
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  And then you contacted us and I said, I need some more time to look into this
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  But either you were doing this to get attention
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  Knowing that putting this mystique on it, as you call it
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Would make the media pick up on what you were saying
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  Because it was useful to them
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  Or you are a Adam Gadan type fed or foundation hired person
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  Meant to make the militias look dangerous and fringe and bad
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  I'm not here judging you, I'm not here saying you're a bad person
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  I'm just here to try to really, truly assess
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Now talking to you here on air and having more time to look at what you do
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  I think this may be more of an art project and that you did this to get attention
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  And that certainly worked, but we're going to try to ascertain that here today
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  But instead of me just talking at you pale horse
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and about your militia and what you guys stand for
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  Well basically, we're just a militia group like any other group
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  I started in the Washington state militia
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  And then upon moving back to Ohio, which is my native state
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  I began training with the Michigan militia
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  And I just got real proactive in the movement
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  And basically just started my own group eventually
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  And I'm just trying to get the word out there and just train to protect my family
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  And I think you have the wrong idea of who I am
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  Basically, I didn't put the video up to get attention
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  I had no idea that it would be as big as it was
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  100,000 plus views and being all over the news and everything
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  I thought you just said you wanted mystique
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  Well yeah, the idea of the video was that mystique
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  But at the same time, I had no idea that it was going to go as far as it did
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  You know what I mean? I was telling people to buy guns
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  And basically just prepare for what's to come
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  Same as you do
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  What are your influences?
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  I'm actually friends with Mark Kornacky
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  He's one of my big influences
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  I've read the book Behold a Pale Horse by William Cooper
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  Let me ask you a question
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  Did you read the part in there about holograms
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  And the aliens filming Jesus in a hologram
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  And flying submarines in the Bilderberg group
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  Meeting the Arctic Circle in submarines
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I've heard all the shape-shifting reptilians
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  No, no, no, you're not listening to me
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  I'm seeing if you actually read that book
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  Tell me about that book
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  Basically, he talked about how he was in the Navy at one point
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  And, you know, he's seen spaceships come out of the ocean
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  And I mean, he covers so many different things in there
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  Okay, does it talk about aliens sacrificing Jesus in holograms?
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  Yes, it does
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  Okay, so you read the book, all right
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Just making sure there
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  Listen, I'm not trying to
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  Listen, you may be a nice guy
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  I'm talking to you now
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  I'm not saying you're bad
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  And we all learn, we all try, we all grow
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  And so I'm just asking you this question
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  When you saw yourself on national television
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  On ABC and Fox and everywhere else
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  Why do you think out of all the militia videos out there
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  They chose you?
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  I would say because the fact that my face is covered
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  And because the scary voice modulator that I had on there
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  Because it's kind of saying, you know, this could be anybody
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  This could be your neighbor, you know what I mean
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  And it's easy to point the finger at a guy with no face
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  Rather than, you know, a specific person
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  Does that make sense?
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  Okay, listen
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  I want to hold you for a while
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  I want to give you a chance to give us your perspective
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  I'm not here attacking you pale horse
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  Why did you choose the name pale horse?
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  You know, pale horse is death
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  Yes
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  Well, you know, I want to say death to the NWO
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  And death to the Illuminati
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  So that is my message
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  My former name was Hobbes, you know, I just liked the name
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  And it really had nothing to do with, you know
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  Being the enemy of mankind or anything like that
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  I didn't think that
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  I was asking and I figured that was what you would say
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  I'm just really here trying to learn pale horse
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  There in Ohio
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  How many videos have you made?
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  How long have you been making videos?
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  Um, I've been posting them on YouTube for the past year
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  I believe the first one I put up was in October
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  And it was kind of snowballed from there
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  So I hadn't actually put out a video in quite some time
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  You know, due to being busy in my daily life
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  But, you know, when I was seeing myself on the news
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  And I felt that I had to put, you know, a response to that
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  Which you've seen and you have posted on your site
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  Absolutely, I mean, you notice when we posted your video
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  We didn't make a judgment
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  We said, here's what pale horse has to say
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  It's just here on air
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  I'm trying to flesh this out, aren't you?
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  I'm not making a judgment of you
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  I'm telling you, we said either this is a guy
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  Who wanted to get his message out and knew this would be spooky
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  And it would, which you're saying is the case
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  And I tend to believe you
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  Or this is ADL Southern Poverty Law Center
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  Or actual federal government
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  Because the lighting
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  The way you have your lieutenant behind you
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  Him wearing the gas mask
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  This is exactly how the feds would do it
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  I mean, this is directly with the proven fake al-Qaeda videos
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  And Adam Gadan and all of these
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  This is directly out of central casting
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  What you did
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  So you are a talented guy
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  The way you did this
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  You know, with your, again, you look like a bad guy
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  From a James Bond publication
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  From a James Bond movie
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  My issue is
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  I've always told the militia
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  You're constitutional
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  You're wonderful
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  You're the salt of the earth
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  We should be mainline
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  And run for sheriff
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  And have the shooting enthusiast clubs
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  So any group that's hiding and secret
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  And telling you to sneak around in the bushes with them, though
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  Is going to be filled with feds
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  And they're going to try to provocateur you
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  And plant pipe bombs on you
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  And so in my experience
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  Guys that showed up at city council in camo
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  Because I've gone and tracked these people
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  And I actually, one time to find out about them
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  Infiltrated a few of the groups
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  Like, oh, they'd be happy to have Alex Jones in them
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  I went as a true patriot and infiltrated
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  And found out there were feds in these
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  So I was like, whoa
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  So I have actually gone a decade ago
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  12 years ago and done research
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  I found one real militia group in central Texas
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  The others were commanded by feds
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  Okay, so I want to warn anybody
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  That gets involved with these militias
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  That you're going to be there with feds
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  Or foreign mercenaries
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  Or Mossad agents
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  Who are going to be trying to get you
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  To carry out acts of terrorism
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  So they can create the fictitious view
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  In the public with decoys
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  That there is actually a terror movement
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  So they can sick homeland security
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  On the American people
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  Did you ever think about that, pale horse?
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  Oh, of course
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  I mean, I know there's plenty of feds
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  Out there in the militia movement
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  But if you knew me personally
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  Which obviously you don't
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  You know that I'm the furthest thing from a fed
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  That you could possibly have
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  I mean, I'm just a regular guy
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  You know, I work
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  I have two children
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  And, you know, I just woke up
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  Eventually, like everyone should
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  And at that point
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  I did the same thing that you do
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  And I just decided to do the best that I can
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  To fight the New World Order
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  And, you know, just make a name for my group

[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical,
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist,
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  This is the end.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  There'll be weather still about 40 after or so.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  This pale horse from Ohio.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Look at this image here on screen at prisonplanet.tv or go watch his videos online.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  We have them linked on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  or on YouTube at YouTube slash Ohio, Malaysia.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  Perfect, how they've got the American flag behind them.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  And this is a multifaceted image.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  Now, if you hit on this by yourself, which may be true, I'm not saying you're a liar, then it's amazing
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  because this is exactly how the globalists would phrase it.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  They would put a lieutenant behind you, which is associated with third world dictators, thugs, things like that.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  He's also meant to look a bit ridiculous, a bit tubby with mixed matched uniforms
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  to disgust military people, spree decor.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  This is meant they're afraid of the military and police as the Southern Prairie Law Center said
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  when they attacked me and Stuart Rhodes and Ron Paul in their report last week.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  They're afraid of the military and police joining the spirit of 1776.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  So they're all into being in shape, and I'm not saying you're fat,
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  maybe it's just a lot of clothes you're wearing, into how they dress, what they look like.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  I mean, a gas mask, helmets.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  So this is meant to look Laurel and Hardy right here.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  But then your voice is also meant to scare little old ladies who don't get that message.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  It's just meant to scare them and kind of scare the gilded cowardly public.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  And then you've got your adjunct here or your many me behind you.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  I mean, I mean, sir, you have hit.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  Look, talking to you right now, your voice, everything you say sounds like you're not a fed.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  But then the image is just how did you perfectly hit what the new world order would want?
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  I mean, just magically, or I guess there's thousands of militias.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  Somebody out there is going to put out the image, the establishment once.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  It was actually very impromptu. I mean, having my friends stand behind me
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  was actually like a spur of the moment decision as we were filming this thing.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  It was a showing force, basically, that it's not just me.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  There's actually other people in my group.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  Like the Republic of Texas has admirals over bass boats.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  Yeah, I don't understand what you're saying.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  Look, I'm like, look, look, look, look, I think you're, I think you're obviously a good American.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  You, I mean, your voice, everything I couldn't tell off the voice on here.
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  And I'm not knocking you and a lot of these militia guys get mad
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  because they want to strut around an event and camo and walk around acting tough.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  And it's like some kind of adolescent, you know, deal or something.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  And then I see him go to prison. I see him get set up.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  He tells somebody join the militia. Yeah, we're going to case out the local police station.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  And then you find out it's the cops leading it and they bust you and they put a pipe bomb in your car.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  And it's militias plan to bomb the police station.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  And it comes out six months later in federal court that you weren't planning that,
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  but they got the feds created the Viper militia out of a meth dealing toothless biker gang on the west coast.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  So they could have the term Viper with militia.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  I've got stacks of news articles here. Massad double agent is script writer for bin Laden tape.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  Hardcore Zionist Adam Perlman, who once condemned Muslims as bloodthirsty terrorists behind latest scam.
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  The Intel center uploaded the Al Qaeda videos with their own watermark with the Al Qaeda watermark proven same people.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  Turned out the guy running Intel center was black ops commander under Rumsfeld in CIA and Pentagon both.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  Here's another one. White supremacist radio host Hal Turner was FBI informant came out in federal court.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  That's mainstream news. Miami Herald reports the major leaders of their white supremacist meetings there are feds.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  You have the Southern Poverty Law Center with Elohim city white supremacist compound founded and commanded by Southern Poverty Law Center.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  That came out mainstream news FBI documents running McVeigh out of there.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  Then you have the army involved camp grouper fueling the rider truck local cops saw it took photos thought it was suspicious.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  Look, they're loading that rider truck. Of course, then some of the cops that released that got killed.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  Oh, yeah, they kill cops. So you need to understand, bro, that I understand that maybe this is a feedback loop from old militia movies.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  The feds put out an old al-Qaeda movies. They've put out you picked up the archetypal image of this and maybe subconsciously recreated it here.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  Because when I saw this, it was like red alert. So do you get where I'm coming from?
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  Oh, yeah, totally. You know, I wish I was that clever to be honest.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  Really, it was this, you know, with the innovation of editing and everything, you know, I just sat there for 10 minutes, sweating under the heat lamp.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  And this said everything that was on my mind and edited it down and threw in a few news clips.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  And that was, you know, the basic, you know, format of the video, you know, I mean, I didn't really have a prewritten script or anything like that.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  Well, listen, listen, what you say is pretty good, which is another thing the feds would do when they put out fake messages.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  It sounds reasonable, but then the imagery is bad to make people then think you're bad when people hear the good message later.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  I've studied the enemy operations. Stay there. I want to let folks hear what Pale Horse actually has to say and who you really are on the other side.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  Do you really know what's in your tap water in a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor?
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  They found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  The Acola blue atmospheric water generator is a low cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  And one of the most important points is they manufacture it every week. They can the food, they prepare the food every week at their factory in Utah.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  This is not stuff from 10 years ago that's been sitting in a warehouse rotting filled with MSG. There's none of that.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  New and fresh, more than 10 years in climate controlled, 10 years if it's in your garage, like my house, so I don't have room for it.

[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  Run by Dr. Ignatius Piazza.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  Okay, going back to Pale Horse.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  Pale Horse, I've got a few final comments I want to make.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  But other points you'd like to add about being now the poster boy for the militia slash right-wing extremist slash white supremacist movement, because they first say white supremacists, then they connect it to militias that are a good thing.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  Then once they demonize militias, they connect that to gun owners, veterans, conservatives, people that don't want the healthcare bill.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  And I don't know if you've heard my show before, but I've been making the point last year that as soon as they reintroduce the militias, they're going to kill you propaganda.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  That means they're getting ready to stage a false terror attack and blame it on all of us out here fighting the New World Order.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  So we're now moving into that final phase, and none of us are perfect in our presentation here.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  I've certainly done plenty of the media to demonize, so I'm not here judging you.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  I'm just constructively saying that, well, there's a guy that wears a skull mask, but in a sharp marine dress uniform.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  They tracked him down off his IP address and threatened to court-martial him.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  They didn't stop.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  They were scared of that sharp uniform and a high and tight, focused person whose eyes were pointed straight and on target, because the eyes were showing.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  It's the eyes being covered up.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  If you're going to cover your face, show your eyes. This is contact with people.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  They don't respect somebody whose eyes they can't see.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  Get a uniform that's trim.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  I mean, there's such a thing.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  It all goes into military psychology, and I'm not here knocking you.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  This is stuff I learned over the years.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  Go ahead.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  Um, you know, I do agree, you know, I could be a fed, but at the same time, anyone who's in the militia movement should be weary of anyone that they don't know.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  But you don't have to be wary if you're at county commissioners meetings out in the open.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  And if you're doing things like the apple seed course where you're just out saying everybody come out, it's fun.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  We're shooting and rediscovering George Washington and we're the good guys.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  We're the majority.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  The feds are scared to death of that movement.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  They want it to be, you know, we're putting on our mask and hiding in the woods and, you know, sneaking up to cornrows and aiming our guns out when cops drive by acting like we're doing something bad.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  That's what's filled with feds.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  Do you understand?
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  Yeah.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  And if you look at my message, nowhere is there hate speech.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  I'm not a racist.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  And, you know, it's easy for people just to believe everything they see on the news that all these militias are bad and, you know, they're all white supremacists and things like that.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  You know, I've trained with African-Americans and other ethnicities.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  And, you know, I just think it's wrong the way that they're putting us out there like that.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  But I understand at the same time that, you know, being part of the militia, that that's one of the downfalls.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  Look, what's happened is being involved, covering the militia, a lot of these guys have never been in the military.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  I haven't either.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  I'm not up here being macho.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  And they want that experience and they know America's in trouble and they're good guys.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  Well, a lot of the leaders of the groups are actually former military.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  No, no, I understand that.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  I'm showing you what I've experienced and they're very easily led.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  They're easily led by feds to set you up and get you in trouble.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  All I'm saying is that the militia wants to be mainstream, which it's in the U.S. Code.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  It's in the Constitution and doesn't want to be demonized.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  We should be out in the open and out in the open about our liberty and freedom.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  And generally it's associated with bad guys wearing masks and wearing hoods.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  And it's easily associated with al-Qaeda, which is also a CIA creation, wearing masks and hoods.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  And I understand people that want to be secretive and they have their first amendment to be secretive and do this.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  I just think militias might want to have a public spokesperson who's good-looking and well-spoken who goes out and does the talking.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  Instead of people in masks looking like the PLO.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  That's all I'm saying.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  Yeah, and like I said, I didn't realize that all this was going to come to pass.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  And I've actually contemplated putting a video up where I'm not wearing any kind of mask or voice modulator.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  And I'm not afraid of the FBI or the government.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  It was more to protect my family and things like that and not bring any unwanted attention towards them.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  Like I said, my wife's been scared to death since this whole thing's come to pass.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  And I'm like, check it out, honey, I'm on the news, you know what I mean?
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  It was very surreal.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  But I do agree with you about covering your face and everything.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  Now, did YouTube take your videos down?
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  I don't know if YouTube did, but someone somehow hacked my computer.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  I had threats on my comments saying, we're going to hack you and things like that.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  And I didn't really take it seriously.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  And I got a phone call saying all your videos are down and I got on there and I had no more videos up.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  So I lost all my hits on my videos, but I am putting them back up and I'm going to try to take measures, you know,
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  put up a good firewall so that this doesn't happen again.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  Was the whole YouTube channel shut down or just your videos?
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  The channel itself was still up, but all the YouTube, all the videos were taken down and all my comments were erased
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  and they messed with a few other things on there.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  But, you know, as of now, it's back up and running, but I just don't have all my videos up yet.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  Well, I'm not going to tell you what to do, but if I was you, if you want your family to be safe,
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  I would come out, do a video, explain why you did it, because the feds will sick local dumb cops they use on you.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  And down the road, they may set you up with a pipe bomb or something to introduce you as the pale horse.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  Even that name, they're going to love you.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  Because it's all about simple branding.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  And I'm not saying you can't wear a mask and be on TV and have a scary voice changer.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  I'm just telling you, it plays directly into their hands.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  I mean, the majority of Texans in polls want to secede and have the Republic of Texas.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  So the feds went out and found the one group of people in a trailer who immediately declared themselves president.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  That's not how it's done.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  You have the revolution first, then you have an election of a president.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  And so they killed the people in their trailer, basically.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  And then because it was ridiculous to see hillbillies announcing themselves president.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  So they try to demonize any revolution by going to the more kooky or ridiculous angles out there.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  And we're not going to be able to stop this happening.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  It's just that we have to then make the public aware of how this whole battle of images works.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  And so I just want you to know that the way you did this video.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  I mean, anybody, how many al-Qaeda videos have we seen put out by the Pentagon?
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  It's now been admitted mainstream news.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  Do they do it just like this with a blue screen behind them, a lieutenant standing the same way, looking clownish.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  And somebody else with a scary looking gun, you know, the most scary type, what a semi-automatic Uzi or what is that?
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  In the newest video, that is the newsy semi-automatic.
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  Yeah, so you've got all of this going on.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  I'm just telling you, it's a nightmare out of central casting.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  And yes, if I was you, I'd show up on TV in a suit and tie and say, look, I just did this to get my message out.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  And maybe talk about these issues, you're free to use some of these clips as we sit here and discuss today.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  Because when we politically show up in a suit and tie, when we politically say we're mainstream and the establishment is bad,
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  think about how much we discredit the system by showing them in black ski mask.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  Does that discredit the New World Order to have their goon police in secret police outfits with automatic weapons?
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  Is that not an image of evil and oppression? Do people not instinctively not like that pale horse?
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  It seems that way, you know, but I think people sometimes focus too much on image and they need to focus more on the message.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  And once again, you know, I'm not giving a hateful message.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  Yeah, but I took my kids to Slytherbon yesterday and they had the Congo ride and it was supposed to be scary with a African mask going,
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  you know, it meant to make it fun and scary.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  And so when you do that, that's what this, it's tailor made.
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  That's why they said this is perfect.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  Now, now because you didn't say a bunch of bad stuff, they didn't show much of what you had to say.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  I'm not here preaching at you.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  I'm just for all the militia for all of us.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  This is a great teaching tool today.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  And maybe people disagree with me.
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  Maybe, maybe I should do the show.
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  You know, I, one time I did a show in a black scheme asking cammo.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  In fact, pull that up.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  Alex Jones, global love cop, but I did it as them to discredit them.
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  You understand?
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  Yeah.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  See, when I did a Joker, I did it as pro new world order to discredit them.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  And it was pointed at kind of the dumb down masses.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  And again, I'm not some master propagandist.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  I've had to learn how the enemy operates.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  I use truth.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  Okay, but I still will use some imagery more and more like used to.
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  I would just come in here in a t-shirt for the TV show.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  And I said, no, I'll buy a couple of sports jackets and some shirts because it's more effective.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  It's all presentation.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  I'm not on some high horse here, pale horse pun intended.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  I mean, there I am in the black scheme mask from like 1997, 98.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  And then we locally found the tape and reared it back in 05.
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  But I'm a SWAT team, new world order national police officer in this video.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  And I'm talking about how wonderful it's going to be to take your guns and you stage terror to bring in a new world order.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  And so, so see, I'm not on a high horse here with you.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  I'm saying when I did this, it was to discredit the establishment.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  Yeah.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  Well, you know, I mean, when I first put this video up, they got a tense, all this attention.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  You know, I mean, I just had no idea what was to come.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  I mean, there's millions of videos on YouTube and I never thought in a million years that mine would be singled out.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  You know, and I was happy to see that I was getting a lot of hits and things like that.
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  And but then it just kind of snowballed and kind of exploded in my face.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  And, you know, I mean, I am a little worried about, you know, being raided at any moment by the ATF or someone like that, you know.
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  But the fact is that, you know, I'm not doing anything illegal.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  And, you know, I guess I was not going to be raided, but they don't care.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  They will come in.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  The VATFE is the most corrupt agency out there.
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  Literally going back to their revenue or days when they were the whiskey tax police, the first illegal federal police force.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  Except for the U.S. Army.
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  They were the first.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  But the issue is they will come in your house.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  They will modify that Uzi and send you to prison.
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  They will, they will put a pipe bomb on you, knock your teeth out, put you in a vehicle, drive you around.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  And diesel you till your feet explode in your shoes.
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  I mean, I mean, these guys kill cops.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  You know who they send?
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  More and more, it looks like FBI didn't kill Terrence Yankee, the police officer in Oklahoma City.
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  It looks like BATF.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  Now BATFE killed him.
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  So let me tell you, you want to deal with hardcore murderers who enjoy killing people.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  You don't want to deal with the BATFE.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  These are hardcore murderers on average.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  Some of them investigate fires and explosives.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  But the special political division they've got is the most criminal group you can imagine.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  I would put the semi-auto Uzi at your parents' house and your cousins for a while.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  I would come out, clean cut the suit, explain why you did it, and explain, but look at your opinion.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  And I don't think they're going to come after you now that you've been on this show.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  If they were allowed to start using you as a poster boy, which they may start doing,
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  then they may bust you and set you up.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  I'm just warning you.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  No, no, and I've been told, you know, by some of the people in the militia movement that I'm friends with, you know,
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  I'm like CNN contacted me and, you know, this producer from CNN and she wanted to talk to me and he's like,
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  don't do it.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  You know what I mean?
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  He's saying that.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  Yeah, they will distort.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  They will distort anything and everything you say.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  They could try to make me the next Timothy McVeigh, you know what I mean?
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  That's what Tim McVeigh worked for Special Forces, confirmed.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  It's come out in federal documents.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  He was videotaped at military camps years after he was supposedly out.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  He thought he was an anti-militia movement, deep cover, and he thought he was running a VATF Easting,
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  and they set him up and then drugged him and then threatened to kill his family if he didn't go along with it.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  And the same thing with Oswald, you know?
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  Exactly.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  CIA on record, congressional testimony.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  We have a CIA control number.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  He worked at top secret YouTube spy plane facilities in Japan.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  Absolutely.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  I mean, even if you worked for them, they'll burn you.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  I'm just saying, don't play into their hands, but not just you.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  No one else out there.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  If you want to go out with your buddies and dress in camo for rural operations,
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  if you ever have to defend the Republic, fine, that's great.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  But most operations should be how to infiltrate peacefully.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  An operation is going to city council, getting signed in, going in, rallying people in a three-minute speech.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  The feds are taking over.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  The foreign banks are taking over our city.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  Please support me.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  Meet me at the back here after the city council meeting.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  Let's form a citizens group to fight this takeover.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  And being in a suit and tie, forming a group, having rallies, having demonstrations,
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  starting a radio show, starting a website, putting up flyers,
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  and then having an auxiliary shooting club, getting a member that has a piece of property,
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  somebody who's established in the community, that owns a feed store or a car wash,
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  who you know is not a fed, going out and training, second amendment for America.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  Just ride out in the open, red, white, and blue t-shirts on, and then your mainstream.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  Then we get the military and police.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  Then we take over.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  Then we get the republic back.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  We take back over from the new world order.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  You understand how this works?
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  Yes, definitely.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  And look, none of us are perfect.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  I've been a wild man all these years, and more and more I realize that the theatrics got me a giant audience.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  But more and more now that I am this leader, I've got to go to the next level and control myself, pale horse.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  And I've heard people call you a fed before, you know what I mean?
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  Well, that's what the feds do.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  They've got a lot of different tools.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  But a fed doesn't tell you you've got power.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  A fed doesn't tell you to peacefully get involved.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  A fed doesn't tell you to not creep around in the shadows.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  A fed tells you to hide in the dark, not stand up in the light.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  And then look at the fruits, look at how I've woken up the majority of people.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  Stay there.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  Well, that's all I've got to say about this.
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  Thank you so much for watching.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with doubly-nameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.

[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  Day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  It is an informal rule. There's a terrible balance. We don't want to be so into image that we're mainstream, that our knees are knocking, and we're scared to even reach out to people and have some communications director that crafts everything.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  Be wild, get angry, be focused, be serious, be happy. The world takes all different kinds to operate. It's just the feds operate in secrecy.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  They love secret militias that get seduced into doing things illegal.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  So the minute you're ever in a militia and here's somebody say, let's go case out the police station, you know immediately that's a federal informant.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have them at restaurants and bars and on vacation and everywhere I go. It happens to my producers.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  It happens when our guys go to an event and sell videos while I'm giving a speech.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  They come up and say, let's go attack cops. You can follow them outside. Sometimes they're even in an unmarked police car. They're there.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  And they will plant stuff on you. They've done this to a lot of other people, especially the Michigan militia, which is riddled with feds and a lot of deep cover feds.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  And so I just warned people about that. If you join the apple seed groups or local shooting groups, that's great.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  Or with your friends, start a local military history group or shooting club or hunting club.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  Just we're going to defend America. We're going to follow the Bill of Rights Constitution, like oath keepers say.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  And we've gotten to the point now where all these former governors and governor's association people and former members of Congress and current members of Congress
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  are saying the government plans on creating martial law on putting 400,000 troops on the streets. I mean, it's now mainstream.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  They sit in 1995 when the feds could just bomb a building and blame us and then shut us down. That's over.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  But they're still going to try it. And so I want to warn people that the feds are planning to bomb themselves and then try to go arrest some people.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  And I want to just let people know that this is very real.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  And if we don't stand up and say no to the globalists, they're going to take America and the world down into this neo-fascist eugenicist system,
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  this planetary government that's going to carry out the eugenics as the White House science are, says an eco science.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  So this isn't a game or a drill. And none of us are up to the challenge.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  You know, life is very tough in many ways.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  But even though none of us are perfect, none of us are up to it, we got to be up to it.
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  You know, the establishment, they're not invincible either.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  So even though we think we're not up to the challenge, we are.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  A pale horse. Final comments in the last minute and a half we've got.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  Basically, I just want to tell everyone to keep waking people up.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  And, you know, if you do want to train with the militia group, like he was saying, you know, don't get involved in anything that you wouldn't believe to be kosher or something that could get you in trouble.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  And I myself have never done anything like that. You know, I just do simple paramilitary training.
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  Have you ever had people, though, ask and say, hey, you think we ought to get violent? Think we ought to hit first?
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  Honestly, no.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  Well, see, that's another problem with the feds. There are so many militias, so many more now than there were in the 90s, and also lessons learned in the 90s, that there are just militias everywhere that are real and secret.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  And I'm saying it's good to have some that are secret, some that are lone wolf, as they're called, and some that are public.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  But, I mean, do you see the need for a public movement?
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  Well, you know, my group's been public. I myself, you know, remained anonymous, but, you know, I've had a website for years, and, you know, like I said, I have a MySpace channel and a YouTube channel, so, you know, my group is not underground whatsoever.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  Well, it takes all kinds. Pale horse, we'll talk to you again soon.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  Thank you for the opportunity.
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  The name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  Number three. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  Number four. The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  Number five. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:59:40.000 --> 2:00:05.000]  That's www.mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet, so go to www.mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  T-minus one hour. We've got a big, big, yes, wind up. I'm pretty excited about it. So that is coming up.
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  I want to say that I didn't comment on Pale Horse last week when he was on national news, because I didn't want to say the guy was a fed without looking into it.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  You know, with a voice changer with, I am the Pale Horse and, you know, his lieutenant behind him. Because I knew, because of the media archetypal image that he may have picked up on that from past stage government videos.
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  Though I did tell my crew, it may be a fed, probably is. But once we talk to him off air and on air, more and more it sounded like he was somebody that wasn't.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  And so we appreciate him coming on. If he is a fed, he's one of the best actors I've ever seen. The feds are very evasive, very weird, probably wouldn't have come on the air.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  I've just been around so many of them. I've been confronted by so many of them that I've learned. If he is one, he is CIA level.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  And I don't think that's the case. So, but we did have a good learning experience there. But I went over stacks of news earlier about white supremacists being feds, militia commanders being feds, trying to set people up.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  Kalamazoo white supremacist rally was organized by FBI informant. There's one.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  Here's salon neo nazis are in the army now, including commanders. Yeah, that's staged white supremacist radio host Al Turner was FBI informant.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  As hackers claimed a year ago, the FBI admitted in court.
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  So we've got those articles. And here's a new one. Now I told you, I haven't done the math on it, but I've never seen a swastika put on a black congressman's
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  congressional office or a swastika put on a synagogue or a swastika put on a or a KKK put on a black dorm students door.
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  I've never seen one that didn't turn out to be staged by the ADL by the Southern primary law center or by the students themselves wanting attention.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  I mean, how many women say they've been raped when they haven't been. It's a well known phenomenon.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  Or they get drunk, have sex with somebody and then say you raped him. I mean, that is that is very, very, very prominent.
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  I'm not saying there aren't real rapes that go on when a woman's really raped. They tend to not tell anybody.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  That's the weird thing about psychology. But when they don't get raped and they go and say you raped him.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  But this is a very widespread. I have found in media dealing with women.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  You got to women and men. If you disagree with them in any way or somebody didn't pay you for a thousand videos, you ship them or you tell somebody, hey, don't lie about me.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  They'll just say immediately you threatened to kill me. So now I've learned to always have witnesses.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  You know, when I'm sitting there, I'll talk to somebody on speakerphone with like four people in the room and then person doesn't know it.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  Then they say it's incredible folks. I didn't know people were this low.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  But it is a people that think they're weak women, minorities and others.
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  But white men do this as well. Make up stuff. They false flag themselves.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  They staged terror attacks on themselves. I'll tell you, I grew up white guy in Texas and never heard anybody say the n word except for some neighbors.
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  We had down the street who were from Louisiana and they would joke and say it.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  They were preacher's kids and one of them when he got excited, like my mom would say, we've got movie tickets to take you guys to Star Wars.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  And one of them would go, I love the devil. It was like, you know, like the most rebellious things he could say, you know, as a preacher's kid, you know, the neighbor kid from down the street.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  He was that type of like saying something taboo. I mean, like if one day he got a new motorcycle and he was like 10 and he got all excited and said, I love the devil.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  They weren't devil worshipers. It was a taboo. What, Harman, you don't know about preacher's daughters. How wild they are. It's like well known.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  Oh, you know about that. Okay. Well, here it is. Man pleads guilty to racial slur using fake Facebook account.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  An African-American man has pled guilty of being accused of impersonating white supremacists in a fictitious Facebook account to make death threats against African-American university students.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  And we've caught people doing this to us. So, Webster Tarpley coming up. Stay with us.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.

[2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:19.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  Alex Jones, I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  Will you go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  Mr. Griffin Tarpoli, we've got him for an hour because we have a surprise guest next hour. And boy, I do mean surprise. And that guest only was for 30 minutes. So in the last 30 minutes, I will do a focused report.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  I promise. On the government will hype swine flu, outbreak to save Obamacare warrants, Dick Army.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  We have Congressmen Brown saying they're going to use it to stage martial law.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  The Governor's Association sending a letter to Congress and the Department of Defense saying you can't put regular army to patrol America.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  400,000 total in deposit commentatus, total military dictatorship. It is now actually happening here in the good old US of A.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  So that is coming up and how that ties into all these flu vaccine deaths, Gillian Bernays disease, a bunch of others. It is all coming up today in the last 30 minutes after our surprise guest.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  But for the balance of this hour, Webster Griffin Tarpoli is on. I was going to have him on for two hours today. We had to switch our top guest.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  So Webster will probably back the next week with nothing but solutions. But I want him to give us a taste of those at the end of this hour.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  But right now, talking to Webster Griffin Tarpoli, I wanted to go into the second front opening up, not just conservatives and anti big government people waking up in the town hall meetings.
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  And his approval ratings dropping three points last week, depending on which poll you look at. He has a 47 at the top to a 42 at the bottom with Gallup and
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  Rasmussen and all these other polls. We've got them linked up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com. But I wanted to feed into Tarpoli's political brain data. I've noticed as well and get his take on that after we talk about the second front.
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  And his idea of getting Cindy Sheehan while Obama's on vacation for a month, they're always planning something when that happens to go out and confront him or go out and stand in front of the White House to try to reignite that attention
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:39.000]  and show people that she just wasn't this leftist figure and that she was discarded as soon as she actually really tried to end the war.
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  But Webster, I understand you talk about what you've researched and what you know, but clearly you see them saying militias are about to attack, gun owners are about to attack.
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  All gun owners are basically white supremacists that hate black people and they're going to, you know, the DHS reports demonizing gun owners, returning veterans.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  Now they're saying that, let me just finish this. Now they're saying that they're planning a stage terror attacks. They're hyping all this. And I see the Obama counter.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  I'm just going to tell you right now, not just being flu pandemic, being their cover unless we expose it, but staging Oklahoma style attacks domestically to shore up support for a foreign operation or maybe finally completing the Clinton
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  Error Stage Terror of finally saying the homegrown terrorists are working with Al Qaeda, a plan, a script they plan to go with a 95 backed off of and just went with the homegrown.
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  So I see this in the cards. I see this in the tea leaves as I stand over the cauldron here. I'm asking you with that data. Are you not seeing this chatter or do you have a comment?
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  Well, I would certainly say that if you go back to the 1990s, the militias were heavily infiltrated and to some degree a project.
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  Some of them were founded by the FBI and by the domestic counterintelligence and counterinsurgency apparatus.
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  And if you look in my book 9 11 synthetic terror, I've got a whole thing in there about in particular activities of British intelligence, because this was the playground in particular of British intelligence inside the U.S.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  And the advantage of using the British is that they're not susceptible to U.S. congressional investigations. In other words, you can do operations at arms length.
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  The British invite the U.S. to come into the United Kingdom and do things for them. And the U.S., the CIA and so forth will invite the British to come over here.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  Exactly. They also use Andreas Strasmeyer, whose father was a top SS general. It later turned out he was secret police anti-terror squad from Germany.
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  They brought him to Hancho, the white supremacist, and McVeigh and others out of Elohim City. That came out in FBI documents.
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  So I knew you'd be up on this. I know synthetic terror covers it. It's now coming out that Hal Turner was an FBI informant.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  The FBI admits that in court. It's now turning out that almost all these major white supremacist groups are not infiltrated but run by the feds, by the British, by the Germans, and by Israel.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  You'll have these white supremacist commanders with the classic Jewish archetypal Ashkenazi features.
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  I've been to some of these events to protest them and it's like, my God, there's the ADL on stage.
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  Like Adam Gadan, the al-Qaeda leader, ADL grandson, the grandson of the ADL Ed, arrested for beating up Muslims and then suddenly he joins and he's the guy fighting al-Qaeda.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  So great points. Elaborate on that because I see them rolling that out now.
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  Well, the Ku Klux Klan, just to focus on them, the Ku Klux Klan is, as far as I can see, a wholly owned subsidiary of the FBI and nothing but.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  So this is an apparatus of domestic provocateurs and you're very right to say now the way that the ideological conflict is going, right, the ideological fronts are turning once again.
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  And there obviously is a temptation to begin this demonization and when you see that Southern Poverty Law Center getting into the act, that is a group of shills, basically.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  They are paid apologists. They are there to provide some kind of a halfway plausible academic sounding explanation for whatever the counterinsurgency line inside the United States may happen to be.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  The fact that they point to this, we also have the Secretary of Homeland Security, Napolitano, otherwise known as totalitariano, and her idea that, right, the veterans and the right-wingers and all this.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  So that's the atmospheric and then you get a certain number of patsies, right? Look out for patsies because that's always how it's done.
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  And, you know, the attempt to try to mesh, you know, El Qaeda shows up somewhere in North Carolina or whatever this is, right? And they're all from the FBI.
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  I think that indicates a possible direction. I don't think it's conclusive, but the more you talk about it, the better it is, right?
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  The more this is ventilated and aired and people are inoculated, tell people that if this happens, this is 99.99% guaranteed to be a top-down false flag operation using patsies, using molds inside the government, and then using those technicians.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  Right? If any big, heavy operations have to be done, they're going to have to use government resources, so that will require the presence of technicians and molds to bring that about.
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  That's the classical typology of what's going on. I don't think that's the only one because there are competing priorities, right? There's a great desire to get something going vis-à-vis somebody, right?
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  Be it Sudan or Pakistan or Russia or China.
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  I want to look at the geopolitical operations outside North America. And I agree. They're going to hit us all. They're going to have stage terror.
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  Overseas stage terror domestically. They're going to have other economic crises, hyped up environmental crises, biological, medical. I agree, Webster.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  That's why I wanted to get your take on this. But when I interrupted you earlier, the British really are the masters of divide and conquer great game.
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  That was even Orwell's job as a member of the Imperial Police, as you know, when he grew up in India, before he had his first awakening to one level of the control paradigm.
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  But expanding on that Webster, it was the British now declassified and meted, as you know, but the listeners may not, that staged over 90% of the terror attacks in Northern Ireland and in England.
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  And it turned out that you would have the top three guys in the military IRA were all British intel and that they were actually killing lower members of IRA if they wouldn't go out and kill British policemen as a pretext to stay in Northern Ireland.
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  So it's very, very elementary to keep occupation imperial forces in the country, to occupy the United States with federal troops.
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:21.000]  They're going to need to stage terror to have the pretext that there's some type of hidden phantom menace that they're fighting.
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  And you're right. We have tracked British intel. I've actually had to deal years ago with attempted British intel insertion into our operation.
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  And I want the British to know we were aware of that. I'm now revealing this for the first time. Go ahead.
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  Well, in my book again, 911 synthetic terror, I told the story of Agent Steakknife.
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  He was co-ordinate Steakknife, and this was somebody that the MI5, MI6 had put into the top levels of the IRA.
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  And his job was to kill people. And they were, you know, they also had agents in the other side, right?
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  The Protestant counter gang to the IRA counter. The Orange. Well, the Orange, in this case, it's the Protestant extremist group.
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  So they were orchestrating a series of homicides, and this went right up to Thatcher.
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  And that would, Thatcher was absolutely informed of everything. Wonderful Maggie Thatcher, the goddess of the neocons and so many others,
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  and the goddess of the free marketeers, too, because they think she was the embodiment of their policies. I guess she was.
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  She was actively running these kinds of operations.
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  I just wanted to point out to listeners, this is a fact that governments do this, and it's a historical fact.
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  So we need people to realize this is an official Army field manuals that we showed people last week.
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  We're just talking about something as a matter of fact as hammers and saws and lawn mowers being available at Home Depot.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  We're stating like, you know, that ducks swim around in ponds or that fish swim around in lakes.
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  I hope listeners understand what you're stating as a historical fact, Webster.
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:11.000]  Yeah, this is probably the most documented historical fact that we can bring to bear.
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  I mean, it's been confirmed, you know, hundreds of times and maybe thousands of times.
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  Going back, I got to the ancient world, so I don't think there's any doubt about it, and the implication of thatcher in this stuff,
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  and you know, we can go back to the cases now in the United States, right, the various stunts that have been done,
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  and as time goes on, you get more and more background.
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  So certainly, if there's terrorism, look to the intelligence agencies, because that's the matrix.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  Our guest is Webster Griffin Tarpley. We'll look at the geopolitical front.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  Then we're going to get a little bit more indigenics and then some solutions.
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:56.000]  And I promise, next week, Webster Tarpley full hour on nothing but solutions, but things are moving so fast,
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  they could stage a terror attack before the next time he's on, we got to cover this.
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:04.000]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride, at less than 2 cents per gallon?
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine fluoride and contaminants from municipal water.
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  From the smallest to the largest systems, bigberkeywaterfilters.com has what you need.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter or two sport Berkey bottles absolutely free.

[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  Well Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.

[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  In the last 30 minutes of the show, I'm also going to break down the incredible success of the Obama poster campaign.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  Hey, I'm flattered. Cindy Sheehan was listening to the show when I was talking about Webster. I don't know if Webster's really involved.
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  I talked to him the other day. I talked to him Sunday, talked to him yesterday, and he said,
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  I'm trying to get Cindy Sheehan to go confront Obama. We need to fund her. We need to get behind her.
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  And here I'm doing Tarpley imitations while he's on Weathers. We love Tarpley around here.
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  Because I see him so much. He's in the last Obama film. I've known him for years. He's in the new Obama film.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  So I look at Tarpley every day. We interview him all the time. He's kind of like a little mascot,
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  our little Leonardo da Vinci of the Liberty Movement here at the office. I have another nickname for Tarpley, but he...
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  Anyways, Tarpley, I...
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  If I may, just one thing. Just a correction. Cindy Sheehan is going because she decided to go.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  I simply had gotten an email saying that she wanted to go and that she wanted to assemble the prerequisite.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  So I was simply reporting that. So this is all coming from her.
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  Okay, great. Yeah, because I mean, I talked to you during a one-minute part of a break when you were on with Burma.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  So I just heard you saying, get Sheehan, support her, get her to go to wherever Obama's vacationing.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  And I was like, okay, so, but pointless to argue about that.
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  The point is she's coming on in 10 minutes for five minutes with you, Webster.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  The issue is she's listening right now.
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  Wonderful. And again, let me say this is the credit all goes to her. Nothing to do with me.
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  Okay, well, nobody cares about that. That's fine. Webster.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  Although I welcome it. I think everybody... Let me call now. Everybody should support this. Everybody should go. Support her.
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  This is a wonderful thing. And this is now the... If you want to somehow break into this right-wing polarization that you're talking about in the earlier part,
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  the idea of using the demonization of conservatives or whoever they are, people that are considered right-wingers,
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  then the obvious way to do that is to the rebirth of the peace movement and people that would generally be considered leftists.
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  Because this is harder to demonize. And that's what I've always said, is that attacks against Obama coming from his left are much more effective than the kind of stuff you've seen.
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  Well, that's why the Obama deception... That's why the Obama deception, Webster, is so important, is because it doesn't attack from the left or right.
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  It attacks from common sense, populist, constitutionalist, and shows how both parties are controlled by these corrupt banks.
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  And then the partisanship all ends and people instantly break their conditioning. But look, she's coming up next segment in about 15 minutes.
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  So I want to get into the second front opening up against Herr Obama then. Right now we were talking about false flag.
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  The ace in the hole that the establishment has to play on us. You were talking about outside the country, what geopolitical regions...
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  Are we looking at Central Asia, Middle East, Europe? Where will the establishment stage terror next?
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  Well, that's obviously anybody's guess. But if we look at Afghanistan, the big operation by Obama right now is the massive escalation of the war in Afghanistan.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  And he's put a guy in there, General McChrystal, who is someone who is certified to have created a network of torture chambers across Iraq.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  When you think of Obama's rhetoric and running for president makes this whole thing extremely laughable, really a bitter, macabre irony.
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  So Obama's hand-picked commander to go into Afghanistan, replacing the previous general, who was simply McKernan, who was simply thrown out very brusquely.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  And a lot of people in the Pentagon are very angry about that the way it was done.
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  This guy is a special forces utopian, so that means that he's into doing things like working with the Taliban, working with Al Qaeda, working with various warlords and so forth.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  The danger there, of course, is that with the 10-year war perspective and the losses that are now escalating, some countries may want to drop out.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  How could you stop them from dropping out?
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  Well, you could, for example, if the British are about to drop out, then maybe some staged event regarding Britain could...
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  Replay of 7-7.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  The British are about to pull out of Gleneagles.
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  Boom, go ahead.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  And continental Europe also.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  So that would be one opportunity.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  The other thing would be if the breakup of Pakistan is taking too long, then something involving a group that advertises itself is coming from inside Pakistan.
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  And they have them.
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  The Taliban are basically Pushtunistan.
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  That's one of the components of Pakistan.
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  And then you have Baluchistan.
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  In Baluchistan, they have this Jundala.
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:09.000]  So Jundala comes on the scene.
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  That's a U.S.-British-run operation, and therefore you can go into Pakistan based on that.
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  Or how about Sudan?
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  There's a lot of bad blood.
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:26.000]  The General Bashir, the head of state, has been invited by the International Criminal Court.
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  But the entire African Union has rejected the International Criminal Court as a bunch of racist and colonialists.
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  So if you want to get something started there, maybe a Sudanese terrorist would suit the bill.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  Webster Tarpoli, stay there.
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  We'll come back, get into Obama's plunging approval ratings.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  And we'll talk about the peace activist second front Obama's left flank.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:55.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  The Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:40.000]  The Akola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:44.000]  That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe.
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:31:10.000]  This is Alex Jones. Have you heard of the millionaire patriot? Well, you should. He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you. That's right.
[2:31:10.000 --> 2:31:20.000]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.

[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:21.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:35.000]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  The government is our guest, a special guest coming up the next hour. Cindy Sheehan is going to be popping in in about 10 minutes.
[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  She just put out a new press release today. Cindy Sheehan to lead protest against wars near Obama's vacation spot on Martha's Vineyard.
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  So a replay of what we saw with her out at Crawford.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  And as long as she was useful to the Democrats, she was great, but as soon as they got into power or were getting ready to and wanted to continue the wars, well, now, no.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  So that's coming up.
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  Before we go back to Webster Griffin Tarpley, I have never had a t-shirt this popular, the Obama Socialist, Obama Fascist, ObamaInfoWars.com, Obama New World Order.
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  We have four different variants on the front, four different messages on the back, like in the Fed, stop the criminal, wake up before it's too late, with infowars.com under it on the back, with Obama on the front.
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  This upsets the establishment. They know the power of archetypal images. They want this loving, linen-esque image of him, hope and change.
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  They do not want this image of him as a master criminal.
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  Our contest went more viral than I could ever imagine. AP, Fox News, all international Spanish television out of Mexico.
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  The posters printed off infowars.com were put up in Tokyo, San Francisco, Rio de Janeiro.
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  They were put up in Moscow. They were just wild.
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  What's still going on? They have the state attorney general in Florida investigating and calling it a hate crime and all this unbelievable bull.
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  But you read the articles, the comments and the articles in the newspapers that with a straight face talk about the scared community, the victims of seeing the Obama poster on street corners.
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  But the public's finding all the statements of Obama thanking his supporters for putting up his picture on stop signs, which is illegal.
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  We haven't called for that. We've said do it in legal and lawful areas.
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:40.000]  They're aware that this is hypocrisy. They're aware that Bush was shown as a vampire and as a joker by yours truly as well, not just the media.
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  There was none of this knitting and hand wringing and at the at the at the demigod, the fur, the one, the chosen one.
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  And so the what happened is the public saw them ripping them down all over and went crazy and put up 10 times, 20 times more.
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  So it's out of my hands now. It's way past the contest will announce the winner and show you the videos Friday.
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  Videos are still pouring in hundreds and hundreds of videos.
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  It's unbelievable of people putting the posters up. Webster, before we get into the second front opening up against the Obamanoids and the globalist establishment,
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  is it important to pull down his image and to defile him as the image of our Lord and Savior so that he can't be this tool to carry out this agenda?
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  Is it American to put up posters of him in a bad line or should we be arrested for that?
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  I think it's a tremendous tradition of democratic expression to engage in political caricature and that can become quite vigorous and quite robust.
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  And again, I would vote for the fascist one because I think that is the one that is technically accurate and most damaging.
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  Because remember, Obama lives on left cover. He's got to be seen as a progressive, a leftist.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  He's got to be seen as a friend of the masses, somebody who cares about the poor, who cares about the people who don't have health insurance,
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  who cares about people who are denied medical care. This is the key to his entire racket.
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  And I've talked to the leftist and they say, we have to be nice to Obama because we're going to court him and curry favor with him and we're going to get our little cause advanced.
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  Whatever it is that they're interested in, I always say, this is exactly wrong.
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  The way you deal with Obama from the left in particular is you criticize him mercilessly, you expose him, you attack him, you caricature him,
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  you tear away this aura and show him for what he is. In other words, political realism.
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  Since he needs that left cover, if you begin to strip away the left cover, then he's got to do something.
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  He's got to give you concessions. He's got to throw you a shuck.
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  The lesbian, gay, transgender people, when they were boycotting a fundraiser that Obama had set up so they would come and give him money,
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  they found that they were able to get concessions from Obama immediately.
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  He gave them same sex marriage partner rights for certain federal employees in a limited way, but certainly it was a step forward for them.
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  And I think that's paradigmatic. If you're the peace movement and you want to do something about these war policies,
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  the only thing to do is get into the field and begin to criticize Obama, attack him, right?
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  From the point of view of the media, vilify him, certainly. The same thing with Bush.
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  And Webster and show the hypocrisy. They had the CPAC meeting this year. Ron Paul spoke.
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:48.000]  All your most staunch Republican supporters there, they were cheering and standing.
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  The majority of them, when he said it's not Republican to have wars, these wars were wrong.
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:39:00.000]  Showing most Republicans aren't pro war. That illusion shattering. Same thing with Democrats.
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  They've got to stand up and how outrageous total number of troops in countries is up.
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  Total number of dead is going back up again. How did you know this though?
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  Because back during the campaign, you said left cover is what he needs.
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  Only an attack from the left will help. He will love a limbaugh. He will make limbaugh his enemy.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  And then it turned out White House memos came out that they love making it about a limbaugh
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  as they run against him discredited with the Viagra and the hillbilly heroine, the oxy cotton,
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  all the weirdness and all the craziness and him drugged out of his mind at CPAC.
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  You were right about that. And so you're absolutely right. They need to not just have left cover.
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  They want to run him against the more buffoonish type Republicans.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  Certainly people like Limbaugh Hannity are viewed as ogres by probably two thirds,
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  maybe somewhat less than two thirds now. I disagree with them totally, especially on economics.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  But that's another story. If you can play yourself, if it's a choice between Obama and Limbaugh,
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  then Obama is going to win by 70-30 or 80-20 or whatever it is.
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  It's going to be a small and vocal minority that will go with Limbaugh.
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  So as long as you can define that as the universe of discourse, then Obama wins.
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  Now the critical thing about the second front, Obama is in Phoenix, Arizona today, I believe.
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:37.000]  This is the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention. There is an anti-war protest contingent there.
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  So I think the palm goes to them. I think this is, as far as I can see,
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  the first significant anti-war demonstration anywhere is taking place in Phoenix, Arizona today.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  So hats off to those guys. I hope they're vigorous.
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  Generally, it takes a while for people to realize the cynicism and the warmonger commitment of Obama.
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  Remember, Obama ran as the biggest warmonger, bigger than McCain, bigger than Hillary, bigger than Bush.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  He was the one who said, I want the unilateral bombing of northwest Pakistan with no consultation of the government.
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  We want to kill Pakistanis outside the unilateral territory. But it's worse than that.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  He didn't just run as a big warmonger.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  He early on got the pole position and got noticed and came to the fore by being super anti-war.
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  I'm going to end the Iraq war immediately. Then it was 16 months and 23 months and then they rewrote cities
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  so bases wouldn't be in the cities, a semantical game.
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  He rotated troops out of Iraq, those that did leave, to Afghanistan. Now he's replacing the troops in Iraq.
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  So duplicity, lying, twisting, all the things you've talked about.
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  Then he flip-flopped right into the campaign the last few months saying, I'm going to be where we need to be.
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  And as you said, now a huge new war in Afghanistan.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  Is that over those pipelines? Or, I mean, they've got to know it's a war they're not going to win.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  No, it's not a war to win. It's a war to create chaos. And remember, the escalation of Afghanistan
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  is a function of the plan to destroy Pakistan, to break it up into mini-states and microstates, right?
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  The five components, Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, Purshtunistan, Waziristan or tribal areas, whatever you want to call that.
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  And the goal there is that this is a Chinese ally.
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  Remember, the battlefield is now the Indian Ocean from Africa to Bangladesh to Pakistan, over to Thailand, right?
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  We've got Tsuchi and Burma and an anti-Chinese function.
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:40.000]  So the idea is anybody who is friendly with China is now a target.
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  Anybody who wants normal commercial relations, wants to sell oil, sell mineral, sell strategic raw materials,
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  do deals with the Chinese, you become an enemy of civilization.
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  You become an effective terrorist, except now you're going to be more than a terrorist.
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  You're going to be a human rights abuser. You're going to be a nuclear proliferator.
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  You're going to be a humanitarian disaster. So that's the targeting of Pakistan.
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  Okay, stay there, Webster. We're going to get back into what's happening geopolitically in about five minutes.
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  But I wanted, since you brought up the fact that it's great that she was considering you'd heard going out and speaking out,
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  because now that archetypal image of Cindy Sheehan to expose the foundation, big money run, fake war movement, and to expose Obama for what he is,
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  she's put out a press release, Cindy Sheehan to lead protest against wars near Obama's vacation spot on Martha's Vineyard.
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  Let's get this up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  Guys, please have Rob do tell the webmasters to post this, and everybody go there and expose him as a warmonger.
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  Cindy Sheehan, great to have you pop in with us today.
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  Hey, Alex, always nice to be on with you.
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  Always good to have you here. Okay, in a nutshell, tell us where you're going and what you're doing.
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  Well, I heard back in June that Obama would be vacationing on Martha's Vineyard in August, so we've been trying to put together a protest against him.
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  And finally, everything came together this weekend where it looks like we'll be able to go out there.
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  Part of the problem, and I heard you guys talking about it a little bit, is that the so-called anti-war movement doesn't want to have anything focused on Obama against the occupations and the wars of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq.
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  And, you know, Iraq's not over yet.
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  And so, anyway, we've come up against some considerable resistance from the left. But then, over this past week, when it looks like, oh, you know, there's a fake debate about healthcare and, you know, all these, you know, the right playing into the hands of the Democratic Party that doesn't want to give a public option for healthcare.
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:45:13.000]  And so, it looks like the White House is caving into that. And I'm like, well, why don't we on the left, the anti-war left, go out and exert pressure on him to start bringing the troops on from the Middle East and actually to, you know, enforce some kind of same-form policy instead of all these, you know,
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  and I think that, of course, the wars are for chaos, but the wars are also for profit. So, we have to exert the same kind of pressure, because if Obama can fold to the right, why can't he also fold to the left?
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  Well, Cindy Sheehan, of course, lost her son over in Iraq and has one of the big iconic image the last six, seven years exposing these fraudulent wars of hegemon. How do we expose the fact that the anti-war movement is foundation funded and demand that they stand up to Obama?
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  And I guess we do what you're doing, go out and expose that fraud or any other ideas of how we can get that done?
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  Well, I certainly think that we have to remain consistent and pure and try not to be co-opted by the same forces that co-opted many large anti-war groups in this country.
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  And so, we need to just, you know, stay pure and stay focused. And this isn't getting quite the attention that going out to the Bush-Rant spot.
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:35.000]  So, you know, there's a lot of false debates going on, so we need to re-correct it where the debate needs to be, and that's ending this empire, this military-industrial empire.
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  And we can't get anything else done in this country until that happens. And so, hopefully, when I go out to march this vineyard, like when I went to Crawford, Texas, the press will be there.
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:55.000]  People will start being able to hear that message. There's many people on the so-called left that still think Obama is some kind of a peace person.
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:47:00.000]  So, we really, that really needs to be exposed and that missed.
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:08.000]  That's because his election, obviously, has been used to totally get all these issues off the table. It's La La Land.
[2:47:08.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  The establishment craftily did that, making the war like it was just Bush's and not the establishment that controls both these presidents.
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  But Cindy, overall, I want to get Webster's comment on this, the incredible drop of Obama. His polls have gone from the 80s to the mid-40s now.
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  He lost three points last week, lowest approval rating of any president, eight months into their administration.
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  Are you worried about him staging any type of crises or terror attack, like we saw from Bush, as a pretext to try to continue this agenda?
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  You know, that's a concern that we always have to worry about, but that doesn't mean that we, you know, quit our activism or quit speaking the truth to the power.
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  We have to go forward and we have to, first of all, you know, I support 100% the 9-11 truth movement and I support the ballot initiative in New York City to get a new investigation going.
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  That's one thing that needs to be exposed over and over and over again is how our governments do have these, you know, and I'm not, I don't know, I don't know who caused 9-11.
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  I know you guys know, I don't know who caused it, but over and over and over again we have these, you know, so-called disasters that get us into one war after the other,
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  but not just wars, having our civil liberties taken away here at home.
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  So those things, we just have to keep talking about it and we can't let them get away with another event like that.
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  Well, Mrs. Sheehan, you know that it came out about Gulf of Tonka and all these other staged events, it's an Army manual.
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  Well, you start calling me Mrs. Sheehan.
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  Mrs. Sheehan?
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  Yeah, Cindy, I'm thinking about staged events though. We know about Gulf of Tonka, we know about other events.
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  We know Cheney did want to blow up US ships and blame it on Iran, so I would just, I think we defeat their false flag by pointing out that they may engage in false flag.
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  No, I agree with you.
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  So I'm not letting them play us off against each other in the left-right paradigm, which is very, very hard to do as they polarize things.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  Webster, any questions or comments for Cindy Sheehan?
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  I think that's wonderful news and the only question I have is, Cindy, how can people support you? Is there a website? Is there a PayPal?
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  How can people link up and how can they support you financially?
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  That's an awesome, awesome question.
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  If you go to CindySheehanSoapbox.com, there is a donate button, and if you do, use PayPal, my account is Cindy, at CindySheehanSoapbox.com.
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  And we just have to use all the tools that we have to expose the, you know, the robber class that I call them.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  It's all about, it's all about the robber class and it's all about this divide, and Bush and Obama are both members of it.
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  And it's not about the person, it's about the system and it's about the policy.
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  Exactly, the president, the personality becomes the distraction, the diversion from the real debate and the real issues.
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  Well, hopefully we can get you to pop in then when you're out there demonstrating from Martha's Vineyard.
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  Thank you so much, Cindy Sheehan. We'll get it up on the website.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  Thank you.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  God bless you. Take care.
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  Bye-bye.
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  We're going to come back closing five minutes from you.
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  Then we've got our surprise guest scheduled coming up in the final hour today.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  I will just leave it at that for everybody.
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  So stay with us.
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  Our websites are prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com.
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  We're streaming live right now at prisonplanet.tv.

[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  Thousands of years their Dark Order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:47.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:52.000]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com.
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  Or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  In-game blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  In the best part, you will receive almost 6,000 seeds that you can save and replant each season for only $79.
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  This means that these vegetables will only cost you about one penny for each one you grow.
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:46.000]  And in this economy, saving money is always welcome, especially when it comes to our food supply.
[2:53:46.000 --> 2:53:50.000]  Order now and these seeds will be shipped to you absolutely free.
[2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:58.000]  To learn more and to place your order, visit ejc.com. That's the letter E, the letter J, seed.com.
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  ejc.com. Order now.
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi. We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  Again, I do hope everybody visits infowars.com to get their Obama Joker posters. We also have one as Bush as the Joker.
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  I haven't gone this far yet, but I would guess that Tarpley does agree that Obama as Hitler might be a fair comparison or maybe Obama as Mussolini.
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  Mussolini is the adequate one. Yeah, we'll have you back up next week to really get into solutions.
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  I promise if you can do it, we'll set the time up right.
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:59.000]  But let me just maybe stress it if I could.
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  That Cindy Sheehan is a great voice and a great cause and now any peace activist in New England, if you're in Boston, if you're in New York City, you know what to do.
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  It's time to make tracks towards Martha's Vineyard and exercise your First Amendment rights and protest these wars and don't be fooled by left cover.
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  The way to do this is not to be exaggeratedly deferential. Please, dear Mr. President, we know you're a peace angel, but you haven't had time to listen to our pathetic little bleeding cries,
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  which is what the AWOL peace people have done, right, the people who have just disappeared.
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  Now we've got the genuine leader of this movement coming forward, I think quite effectively, saying that this has gone far enough and it's time to take a stand.
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  This is really going to hurt Obama, because how do you demonize Cindy Sheehan?
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  You're not going to be able to say, you know, you come out with this load of insults.
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  She was demonized by the neocons back in 2005-2006. So what are they going to do? Demonize her now from the left? It doesn't work.
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  So this is a significant factor now in Obama's predicament.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  Well, Webster, what they're going to do is they're going to ignore.
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  Well, they may look. The U.S. media may ignore her up to a point.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  I agree. So the alternative world, the world media will be there. The Russians, the Chinese, the Al Jazeera, they're going to be highly interested.
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  So this is going to have a worldwide effect. And I think that then kicks over back into the U.S.
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  because when it becomes a story around the world, they can't ignore it here.
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  Yeah, that's what I was trying to say there is that we also, though, have to, as activists getting past these political labels, say no and be involved here as well.
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  Webster, I carry all four of your books for listeners. And we have the book on the economic cataclysm.
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  We have the two books on Obama and the book Synthetic Terror, all available at infowars.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  Webster, as always, thank you so much. Webster is in our film, The Obama Deception.
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  He's in the new film coming out in October. So again, Webster, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  Bye-bye. You bet. Take care. There goes Webster. Okay, we had Alan Key's last week and he rescheduled a couple of times. Very busy.
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  Our next guest rescheduled a couple of times on us. We'll see if they show up for the show. They haven't rescheduled, so I believe we're about to have them on after we go to break here and come back.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:51.000]  I do want to get one more sponsor out of the way that made today's show possible and then we'll come back with our guest. And in the last 30 minutes, I'm going to get into the flu and all the other things that are happening.
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:58:08.000]  Okola Blue, okolablue.com, the super high quality atmospheric water generator that you know you can be drinking fresh, clean water made right from the air you breathe. No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book. Our sponsor, Okola Blue, with the Okola Blue 28 machine will allow you to do just that.
[2:58:08.000 --> 2:58:22.000]  It's easy to use and it will make up to 7.5 gallons of day out of pure, thin air. The water once generated passes through a seven-stage filter process, including reverse osmosis and carbon filter techniques, ensuring that you know exactly what you're drinking.
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  No chemicals or pollutants or fluoride. OkolaBlue.com, E-C-O-L-O, Blue.com or 1-800-691-6043, 1-800-691-6043, OkolaBlue.com. Fourth and final hour, it'll be jam packed straight ahead.
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:52.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:59:11.000 --> 2:59:22.000]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:50.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:00:05.000 --> 3:00:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I really enjoy doing this syndicated radio show because I get to talk to so many neat people.
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  And the new book is out. It's already a bestseller, Buzz Aldrin, Magnificent Desolation. And he really doesn't need much of an introduction. What a doctor, colonel in the military, one of the first guys to walk on the moon with Neil Armstrong.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  It's just amazing. And I got his book about two weeks ago. I've read almost all of it. One of the best books by an astronaut I've read. I love the name Magnificent Desolation. Here it is as we simulcast on the Internet as well for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[3:00:55.000 --> 3:00:58.000]  Buzz Aldrin, it's great to have you here with us.
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:08.000]  I'm happy to be with you. Life is great. The sun is beginning to shine here in Foggy, LA.
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  Absolutely. Out there in Los Angeles. There's so much to get into. Why the name Magnificent Desolation?
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  It wasn't given the challenge or really the opportunity of a formalized utterance on joining Neil on the surface of the moon. There was a little bit of conversation that included the word Magnificent and then beautiful.
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:53.000]  And so the two words just came together as a comparison of opposites. And so I said Magnificent Desolation.
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  And the Magnificence really was referring to the progress of the human species. From coming down from the trees to automobiles, airplanes, rockets, spaceships, and then journeying and two people from the planet Earth walking around on that object that humans had gazed up and looked at for...
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  all of civilization. So that was a magnificent testimonial to the progress that this human intelligence species was able to do.
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  But we were there at the most desolate site I could imagine. It had not changed in hundreds and thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years from just what we were looking at.
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:03:08.000]  The kind of rolling terrain, all shades of gray, maybe a couple of more centimeters of dust accrued in hundreds of thousands of years.
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  Fourteen days of daylight and darkness, no atmosphere, black sky, Earth sitting up there, almost straight up, and then the sun moving over because of the moon's rotation about the Earth.
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:38.000]  Just a forbidding place, not at all friendly or hospitable. So it was desolate.
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:44.000]  We've got a break in a moment. We've got a long segment coming up, plenty of time to go over the book. But I wanted to ask you...
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  I mean, obviously you had fear, concern on this mission, but what was it like to actually be there and actually carry out this dangerous mission? I mean, it's one thing to psychologically get ready for it, but another thing to actually be there.
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:20.000]  Well, it was for several years, five, six years, the culmination of everything we had been working for. NASA, since 1961, when the president said that we should go to the moon.
[3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  And my Air Force career, piloting and studying my doctorate at MIT and manned orbital rendezvous was just all pointing toward some humans being able to get to the moon, and there I was about to be one of them.
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:55.000]  And it's not a fearful, not a scary, not a worrisome. We learn how to deal with those things just naturally by realizing that fear, worry are all...
[3:04:55.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  We've got a break. We've got a break, Mr. Aldrin. We'll be right back with Buzz Aldrin. Stay with us.
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:16.000]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases. Now, what are you going to do about it?
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:41.000]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water. The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:59.000]  Then, you need to spray right, clean water, right from the air you breathe. Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043, or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecollo.blu.com
[3:05:59.000 --> 3:06:09.000]  The allusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center?
[3:06:09.000 --> 3:06:13.080]  Consist food that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[3:06:13.080 --> 3:06:14.760]  You don't have to cooperate.
[3:06:14.760 --> 3:06:16.200]  There is a solution.
[3:06:16.200 --> 3:06:19.620]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[3:06:19.620 --> 3:06:24.440]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[3:06:24.440 --> 3:06:29.560]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients, full of dense nutrition that gives you the
[3:06:29.560 --> 3:06:31.840]  energy you need and will keep you well.
[3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:37.040]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health
[3:06:37.040 --> 3:06:38.040]  manager.
[3:06:38.040 --> 3:06:42.720]  We love their Nutric Cafe, great organic coffee, infused with herbal extracts to boost your
[3:06:42.720 --> 3:06:43.960]  immune system.
[3:06:43.960 --> 3:06:48.040]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[3:06:59.880 --> 3:07:05.440]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:07:05.440 --> 3:07:09.040]  You're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm.
[3:07:09.040 --> 3:07:10.760]  How much ammunition do you want?
[3:07:10.760 --> 3:07:12.800]  My answer would be all I can get.
[3:07:12.800 --> 3:07:17.840]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[3:07:17.840 --> 3:07:19.080]  How much do you want?
[3:07:19.080 --> 3:07:20.160]  When do you want it?
[3:07:20.160 --> 3:07:22.080]  Now or after the battle starts.
[3:07:22.080 --> 3:07:23.200]  When will you need it?
[3:07:23.200 --> 3:07:25.360]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:07:25.360 --> 3:07:26.680]  Will there be any food?
[3:07:26.680 --> 3:07:28.160]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:07:28.160 --> 3:07:32.280]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:07:32.280 --> 3:07:33.440]  and be immunized?
[3:07:33.440 --> 3:07:37.200]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:07:37.200 --> 3:07:40.800]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:07:40.800 --> 3:07:42.040]  How much will you need?
[3:07:42.040 --> 3:07:43.040]  We don't know.
[3:07:43.040 --> 3:07:44.040]  How much do you want?
[3:07:44.040 --> 3:07:45.040]  All you can get.
[3:07:45.040 --> 3:07:46.040]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:07:46.040 --> 3:07:49.240]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:07:49.240 --> 3:07:56.760]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:07:56.760 --> 3:08:01.480]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:08:01.480 --> 3:08:07.400]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[3:08:07.400 --> 3:08:09.600]  a war on for your mind.
[3:08:09.600 --> 3:08:19.880]  Well, he's Buzz Aldrin II, total safety and safety in the walk from the surface of the
[3:08:19.880 --> 3:08:20.880]  moon.
[3:08:20.880 --> 3:08:21.880]  And he's got a long bio.
[3:08:21.880 --> 3:08:24.200]  He really doesn't need any introduction.
[3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:31.520]  His new book is Magnificent Desolation, the website is buzzaldrin.com.
[3:08:31.520 --> 3:08:40.360]  We've got links to that up on MySitesInfoWars.com and TheOtherSitesInfoWars.net.
[3:08:40.360 --> 3:08:46.520]  Your book gets into your idea of a unified space mission or direction.
[3:08:46.520 --> 3:08:51.800]  I notice we haven't gone back to the moon except with probes since the early 70s.
[3:08:51.800 --> 3:08:57.920]  And you talk about that in the book as well, so tell us about your idea with a doctorate
[3:08:57.920 --> 3:09:04.240]  in all of this and as one of the most famous astronauts, your vision of what you think
[3:09:04.240 --> 3:09:05.240]  we should do.
[3:09:05.240 --> 3:09:13.320]  Yeah, it says you just said unified space vision, not mission, it's many, many missions
[3:09:13.320 --> 3:09:16.320]  over a long period of time.
[3:09:16.320 --> 3:09:25.800]  And we came to a real tipping point with the accident of the Columbia on February 1st
[3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:27.280]  of 03.
[3:09:27.280 --> 3:09:33.440]  That left us with only three orbiters and we had to solve the problem of the safety
[3:09:33.440 --> 3:09:41.520]  of continuing to fly the space shuttle and the unfinished space station.
[3:09:41.520 --> 3:09:44.680]  And what is the future going to be?
[3:09:44.680 --> 3:09:51.960]  Before that accident, NASA was considering flying the shuttle until 2020, another 10 years
[3:09:51.960 --> 3:09:57.760]  from now, and maybe even 2025.
[3:09:57.760 --> 3:10:03.720]  And now it looked as though that was just not a good thing to do.
[3:10:03.720 --> 3:10:10.240]  My engineers were trying to work the problem and coming up with a modified shuttle launch
[3:10:10.240 --> 3:10:18.960]  system that could take up a replacement of the shuttle orbiter to take people up, but
[3:10:18.960 --> 3:10:24.960]  not large amounts of cargo, at least in the same spacecraft.
[3:10:24.960 --> 3:10:34.240]  And we were looking, my group of engineers were also looking for what kind of a space
[3:10:34.240 --> 3:10:38.960]  vision should we have in the future.
[3:10:38.960 --> 3:10:45.560]  But the accident and NASA studies during the summer combined with the accident board came
[3:10:45.560 --> 3:10:56.840]  up with a recommendation that the cargo and crew be separated, but not just in the spacecraft
[3:10:56.840 --> 3:10:59.600]  but on the launch vehicle.
[3:10:59.600 --> 3:11:07.480]  And I was concerned that that opened the door to have NASA develop two different rockets,
[3:11:07.480 --> 3:11:12.520]  one of them just for the crew and one of them just for the lander and the cargo, and I felt
[3:11:12.520 --> 3:11:15.680]  that was wrong.
[3:11:15.680 --> 3:11:22.240]  But NASA was pursuing sort of behind closed doors what they thought they should do for
[3:11:22.240 --> 3:11:36.380]  the future, and when they did come out with their vision for space exploration in January
[3:11:36.380 --> 3:11:44.800]  2004, it involved terminating the shuttle in 2010, finishing the space station, building
[3:11:44.800 --> 3:11:52.440]  spacecraft and rockets somehow to go back to the moon by 2020.
[3:11:52.440 --> 3:11:58.240]  I kind of went along with that, that sounded reasonable, but then as the progress in the
[3:11:58.240 --> 3:12:06.320]  launch vehicle that I disagreed with began to bog us down, I felt we need to look really
[3:12:06.320 --> 3:12:12.640]  closely examined why do we want to go back to the moon with humans when by the time we
[3:12:12.640 --> 3:12:19.960]  get there it will be 50 years from when we did it in 1969 and beyond.
[3:12:19.960 --> 3:12:27.840]  And shouldn't we be following the shuttle with something that has six to eight people
[3:12:27.840 --> 3:12:33.800]  in it but no cargo and lands on a runway, and shouldn't we be doing other things for
[3:12:33.800 --> 3:12:41.080]  a long duration space flight in the direction of Mars, isn't that where we should try and
[3:12:41.080 --> 3:12:45.520]  go with our major resources?
[3:12:45.520 --> 3:12:50.800]  Well Dr. Aldrin, Buzz Aldrin, didn't Werner von Braun draw up the space shuttle back in
[3:12:50.800 --> 3:12:58.240]  like the mid-30s, the idea for it, isn't it ancient comparatively in the space age?
[3:12:58.240 --> 3:13:08.720]  Well yes, what he felt we needed correctly was a laboratory in space and a reusable
[3:13:08.720 --> 3:13:16.720]  way to have rockets at spacecraft take people and cargo up to the moon.
[3:13:16.720 --> 3:13:23.640]  But that's two things and we couldn't build the laboratory until we had the shuttle and
[3:13:23.640 --> 3:13:31.800]  the shuttle was not well designed in the first place by trying to put a crew in the reusable
[3:13:31.800 --> 3:13:41.200]  booster so it had to be redesigned with solid rockets and I didn't agree with that and it
[3:13:41.200 --> 3:13:48.160]  ended up being quite a large vehicle to satisfy the Air Force needs for a big reconnaissance
[3:13:48.160 --> 3:13:55.800]  satellite and a one orbit mission returning to the same place that because of rotation
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:13:58.760]  moved 1500 miles to the east.
[3:13:58.760 --> 3:14:02.840]  Sure, not to interrupt you but in the time we have a reach and a half way point here,
[3:14:02.840 --> 3:14:08.400]  I'm going to skip this network break, you cover a lot of this in Magnificent Desolation
[3:14:08.400 --> 3:14:12.840]  which is a magnificent book but something I saw you get really excited about was on
[3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:20.200]  C-Span you talked about this monolith on the tiny potato shaped moon of Mars and I knew
[3:14:20.200 --> 3:14:27.440]  about its moon, I didn't know about this monolith and you got really sparkly eyed and animated
[3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:29.800]  about this.
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:34.200]  Tell us about this monolith and why you want to land on that moon first.
[3:14:34.200 --> 3:14:41.640]  Well I want to land on the moon first whether it has a monolith or not because it orbits
[3:14:41.640 --> 3:14:48.840]  around Mars in seven hours and is quite close, much, much closer than our moon is to the
[3:14:48.840 --> 3:14:59.480]  earth and from that moon people can control robots, rovers, all sorts of assembly processes,
[3:14:59.480 --> 3:15:05.680]  chemical processes, fuel processes and other things on the surface without endangering
[3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:12.320]  the crew and it's much easier to take people there actually than it is to take people to
[3:15:12.320 --> 3:15:19.240]  and from our moon because of the smallness of it, it takes longer to get there and when
[3:15:19.240 --> 3:15:26.360]  you get there you have to stay longer so it's a significant challenge but it is a major
[3:15:26.360 --> 3:15:36.280]  safe stepping stone before going to the surface of Mars and can be approached in inspiring
[3:15:36.280 --> 3:15:46.560]  logical steps from lower thorbid doing things that increase our capability some in the direction
[3:15:46.560 --> 3:15:50.560]  of our moon but not landing on our moon.
[3:15:50.560 --> 3:15:59.840]  And we have the experience to be the leaders of international nations, other nations, sending
[3:15:59.840 --> 3:16:04.320]  their astronauts or Takenots to land on the moon and we help them.
[3:16:04.320 --> 3:16:08.880]  So are you saying Mr. Aldrin that this should be an international mission?
[3:16:08.880 --> 3:16:16.760]  Well everything should be, the space station is international, we need refueling or going
[3:16:16.760 --> 3:16:25.040]  elsewhere in space and that should be commercial, not national, not government controlled and
[3:16:25.040 --> 3:16:28.040]  that means international.
[3:16:28.040 --> 3:16:37.400]  Yeah, now the monolith just happens to be a location of a Mars, Marsology, not geology
[3:16:37.400 --> 3:16:46.720]  feature that is a physical structure but it is very, very curious and it's quite close
[3:16:46.720 --> 3:16:49.120]  to where we would like to land.
[3:16:49.120 --> 3:16:56.800]  And Canadian studies extensively of going to FOBUS for science, the science team has
[3:16:56.800 --> 3:16:59.600]  said go for the monolith.
[3:16:59.600 --> 3:17:06.640]  So they think that is sufficiently scientifically attractive and it's close to where you want
[3:17:06.640 --> 3:17:14.560]  to be to observe from there the planet Mars itself.
[3:17:14.560 --> 3:17:22.080]  Commander Aldrin isn't this interesting, we have 2001 space odyssey, we have this what
[3:17:22.080 --> 3:17:27.080]  looks like almost a perfect monolith on this moon and then here you are one of the first
[3:17:27.080 --> 3:17:32.880]  moonwalkers when the eagle lands, you're on television saying we need to go there to
[3:17:32.880 --> 3:17:34.240]  see this monolith.
[3:17:34.240 --> 3:17:38.680]  You're saying it's very curious and again I saw your eyes light up on television, what
[3:17:38.680 --> 3:17:47.600]  is your gut this monolith is or what are Marsologists saying it could be?
[3:17:47.600 --> 3:17:58.520]  My opinion and the Marsologists opinion don't guide public opinion and curiosity for the
[3:17:58.520 --> 3:18:01.640]  unusual and the bizarre.
[3:18:01.640 --> 3:18:08.720]  We need lots and lots of public discussion about the pros and cons of going anywhere
[3:18:08.720 --> 3:18:09.720]  in space.
[3:18:09.720 --> 3:18:13.320]  Certainly it's a way to get people interested, I see that but what do you think this is?
[3:18:13.320 --> 3:18:17.920]  Tell me what your gut or as a person, a doctor who studies this, what does this look like
[3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:19.920]  to you?
[3:18:19.920 --> 3:18:23.160]  It's a big, big tall rock.
[3:18:23.160 --> 3:18:34.120]  Now I can say it looks like maybe a crude construction device by some creatures who
[3:18:34.120 --> 3:18:42.680]  practiced on Phobos and then landed in Egypt and built the pyramids.
[3:18:42.680 --> 3:18:51.120]  I don't really believe that but some people are liable to think that.
[3:18:51.120 --> 3:18:57.200]  While I'm looking at it, it looks like really clean cut edges and it's got a smooth top
[3:18:57.200 --> 3:18:59.880]  and I never even covered this stuff, Mr. Aldrin.
[3:18:59.880 --> 3:19:02.680]  Buzz Aldrin on the phone with us here from California.
[3:19:02.680 --> 3:19:09.680]  This is just amazing to have you and others talking about it and I see all your excitement
[3:19:09.680 --> 3:19:10.680]  dealing with it.
[3:19:10.680 --> 3:19:17.160]  Let me ask you in this way, what do you believe the destiny of humanity is because a lot of
[3:19:17.160 --> 3:19:20.080]  people feel like this species is far older than we even know.
[3:19:20.080 --> 3:19:25.160]  What do you believe man's destiny will be if we have the vision to go off world in a
[3:19:25.160 --> 3:19:26.160]  big way?
[3:19:26.160 --> 3:19:35.040]  Well, I think sooner or later the earth is just liable to be impacted by something that
[3:19:35.040 --> 3:19:44.560]  we as humans with all our technology could not prevent and it would be a good idea thousands
[3:19:44.560 --> 3:19:55.480]  of years maybe in the future or two weeks in the future to have a survivable off planet
[3:19:55.480 --> 3:20:01.160]  species to keep in going.
[3:20:01.160 --> 3:20:09.120]  Not just for the benefit of unborn people but think of the lives, the history that the
[3:20:09.120 --> 3:20:16.200]  human species has had here on earth and to have that wiped out, it's not just the lives
[3:20:16.200 --> 3:20:17.200]  of the future.
[3:20:17.200 --> 3:20:23.640]  Well, Dr. Aldrin, was it Saturn that got hit by Shoemaker Levy, the big comet that broke
[3:20:23.640 --> 3:20:24.640]  up?
[3:20:24.640 --> 3:20:27.280]  I mean they said if that hit the earth that would have basically killed all life on the
[3:20:27.280 --> 3:20:30.000]  planet or at least knocked out our civilization.
[3:20:30.000 --> 3:20:31.640]  No, that was Jupiter.
[3:20:31.640 --> 3:20:34.400]  Jupiter, that's right, Jupiter.
[3:20:34.400 --> 3:20:46.360]  Well, we just might find indications of a very crude form of life that might have arisen
[3:20:46.360 --> 3:20:50.600]  at Mars and then been transported to earth.
[3:20:50.600 --> 3:20:59.040]  So it might be the beginnings of life on earth that thrived whereas it died out on Mars.
[3:20:59.040 --> 3:21:02.000]  Are you saying we might be Martians?
[3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:10.640]  Well, we're a long evolution away.
[3:21:10.640 --> 3:21:16.960]  I don't believe that that means that there were rocket ships somehow that left Mars and
[3:21:16.960 --> 3:21:20.120]  landed here on earth.
[3:21:20.120 --> 3:21:24.240]  But meteor impacts you're saying which we know sin, Martian rock here could have brought
[3:21:24.240 --> 3:21:25.240]  it?
[3:21:25.240 --> 3:21:26.240]  Yeah.
[3:21:26.240 --> 3:21:28.240]  Or vice versa.
[3:21:28.240 --> 3:21:31.360]  Going back because that was so intriguing, you're saying it's similar to some of the things
[3:21:31.360 --> 3:21:39.640]  we see in Egypt this, this, no, no, no, no, I'm just saying that there is a lot of conjecture
[3:21:39.640 --> 3:21:41.360]  as to who built the pyramids.
[3:21:41.360 --> 3:21:42.360]  No, I understand that.
[3:21:42.360 --> 3:21:49.120]  I'm pretty well convinced that that they were slaves that were conned into building
[3:21:49.120 --> 3:21:54.120]  this edifice for the pharaohs.
[3:21:54.120 --> 3:22:00.720]  So the pharaohs could get to the other side in the holy land and put in a good word for
[3:22:00.720 --> 3:22:03.440]  all the slaves who built the pyramids.
[3:22:03.440 --> 3:22:04.440]  Sure.
[3:22:04.440 --> 3:22:05.440]  I'll just tell you now.
[3:22:05.440 --> 3:22:10.240]  I think when we talk about a Ponzi scheme, that was the biggest con game I ever saw.
[3:22:10.240 --> 3:22:15.240]  Well, again, Buzz Aldrin is our guest right now, author of Magnificent Desolation That
[3:22:15.240 --> 3:22:17.240]  I Hold in My Hand.
[3:22:17.240 --> 3:22:21.160]  What I'm getting at is this, and I respect you and I appreciate you coming on the show.
[3:22:21.160 --> 3:22:22.720]  I know we have advanced technologies.
[3:22:22.720 --> 3:22:24.160]  I know we have incredible men and women.
[3:22:24.160 --> 3:22:27.000]  I know we have amazing hand of spirit.
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:31.280]  We also know that there are a lot of secret military programs, a lot of advanced technology.
[3:22:31.280 --> 3:22:37.280]  We see astronauts hinting at it, hinting at knowing about things, and this is not even
[3:22:37.280 --> 3:22:38.880]  a UFO show.
[3:22:38.880 --> 3:22:42.000]  We just see other astronauts that say they've seen things out there.
[3:22:42.000 --> 3:22:45.200]  We've seen video from the space shuttle of things flying around.
[3:22:45.200 --> 3:22:51.760]  I was just wondering your view on life in the solar system outside Earth.
[3:22:51.760 --> 3:23:01.200]  We have zero evidence of any life in our solar system other than that which we can observe
[3:23:01.200 --> 3:23:02.200]  here on Earth.
[3:23:02.200 --> 3:23:10.160]  I think the distances involved to even the closest star having written a detailed science
[3:23:10.160 --> 3:23:20.920]  fiction story about another civilization from Alpha Centauri that had compelling reasons
[3:23:20.920 --> 3:23:25.640]  to advance their technology and to visit the Earth.
[3:23:25.640 --> 3:23:34.040]  They failed in their efforts to do that for logical reasons.
[3:23:34.040 --> 3:23:38.600]  But I don't believe they exist there on Alpha Centauri nor do I believe they exist on other
[3:23:38.600 --> 3:23:39.600]  places.
[3:23:39.600 --> 3:23:40.600]  Sure, it's hypothetical.
[3:23:40.600 --> 3:23:49.240]  I've always wanted a good story, but I believe the distances involved make it extremely improbable
[3:23:49.240 --> 3:23:59.520]  for any advanced life forms to be very close and within reach for star travelers from Earth
[3:23:59.520 --> 3:24:03.800]  for thousands and thousands of years.
[3:24:03.800 --> 3:24:05.200]  What about fold space?
[3:24:05.200 --> 3:24:06.520]  What about the solar matter?
[3:24:06.520 --> 3:24:15.480]  However, millions of years, I believe, that certainly creatures from Earth could have
[3:24:15.480 --> 3:24:23.640]  the technology to visit the closest star, Alpha Centauri, and other stars if we have
[3:24:23.640 --> 3:24:34.400]  a good reason to do that and the demise, the extinction of life on Earth probably is a
[3:24:34.400 --> 3:24:43.560]  good reason to want to invest the resources to reestablish civilization on some other
[3:24:43.560 --> 3:24:44.560]  star system.
[3:24:44.560 --> 3:24:47.880]  But that's very, very remote.
[3:24:47.880 --> 3:24:48.880]  Sure.
[3:24:48.880 --> 3:24:55.080]  Do any of your colleagues have suspicions about the monolith?
[3:24:55.080 --> 3:25:04.000]  Well, I've asked them to try and be interested in supporting the things that I've been doing.
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:09.720]  And there's very little response.
[3:25:09.720 --> 3:25:14.520]  There's one that didn't fly to the moon and some others who are shuttle people who are
[3:25:14.520 --> 3:25:23.600]  certainly interested in helping me advance the progress of human spaceflight.
[3:25:23.600 --> 3:25:26.120]  Mr. Aldrin, I always wanted to ask you this.
[3:25:26.120 --> 3:25:31.240]  We saw the photos, the little masonic flag to the moon and some of the names and the
[3:25:31.240 --> 3:25:33.680]  missions and the numerology.
[3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:37.200]  Is there anything to that or what is the masonic influence?
[3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:41.080]  We know there's a masonic influence in the founding of the country.
[3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:43.640]  What is the masonic influence on NASA?
[3:25:43.640 --> 3:25:48.320]  Well, as I can tell, zero.
[3:25:48.320 --> 3:25:56.200]  There were some masonic brothers of mine in Texas that wanted me to take some kind of
[3:25:56.200 --> 3:26:07.160]  a masonic emblem to the moon in some gesture of... I don't know what it would be, a gesture
[3:26:07.160 --> 3:26:16.480]  of, but I told them that it was not within my authority to do such a thing.
[3:26:16.480 --> 3:26:18.000]  Absolutely.
[3:26:18.000 --> 3:26:20.880]  One of the astronauts left a photo of his family, though, there.
[3:26:20.880 --> 3:26:21.880]  Oh, yeah.
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:25.200]  I think that's perfectly legitimate.
[3:26:25.200 --> 3:26:33.800]  I left several things, coins from Soviet cosmonauts killed, a patch from the Apollo 1 messages
[3:26:33.800 --> 3:26:42.200]  from 72 leaders of the world, and an olive branch, a gold pin that was my contribution.
[3:26:42.200 --> 3:26:43.200]  Wow.
[3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:45.240]  Well, again, it's just amazing getting to talk to you.
[3:26:45.240 --> 3:26:47.440]  The book is magnificent desolation.
[3:26:47.440 --> 3:26:51.040]  Let me bring up one other subject and then end on a very positive note.
[3:26:51.040 --> 3:26:52.760]  It's a great book.
[3:26:52.760 --> 3:26:56.040]  This has got a lot of attention lately.
[3:26:56.040 --> 3:26:59.880]  What do you think of the people that mistrust the government and the system so much that
[3:26:59.880 --> 3:27:03.920]  they say you guys couldn't have gone to the Van Allen radiation belt and that it was all
[3:27:03.920 --> 3:27:06.320]  a Stanley Kubrick film production?
[3:27:06.320 --> 3:27:18.920]  Well, I think they are self-serving individuals looking for attention, preying on gullible
[3:27:18.920 --> 3:27:27.000]  people, and they wouldn't exist if it were not for the gullible people who also like
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:38.320]  to encourage thinking about unrealistic, unsubstantiated things and titillate the public, and that
[3:27:38.320 --> 3:27:45.160]  includes all sorts of people, hate to say it, but includes yourself, but I sure understand
[3:27:45.160 --> 3:27:46.160]  that's humanity.
[3:27:46.160 --> 3:27:54.840]  That's the way we operate, and I'm not beyond using that to help publicize the reality of
[3:27:54.840 --> 3:27:55.840]  things.
[3:27:55.840 --> 3:28:02.040]  Well, sure, but I mean, Dr. Aldrin, we have to question, I mean, that's a human trait.
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:06.160]  I tend in the other direction because I know people that worked actually on the mission
[3:28:06.160 --> 3:28:09.800]  with the RCA cameras and things, and they say they believe it was real.
[3:28:09.800 --> 3:28:13.120]  My issue is, I know it goes in the other direction.
[3:28:13.120 --> 3:28:16.820]  I've talked to people, former head of Star Wars and others, they say there's so much
[3:28:16.820 --> 3:28:24.840]  classified stuff, space planes, that the real space program is robotic, and that most of
[3:28:24.840 --> 3:28:25.840]  its military.
[3:28:25.840 --> 3:28:27.840]  Do you have any comments on that?
[3:28:27.840 --> 3:28:35.520]  Well, robotic space program is much, much cheaper than a human one, and if I were financing
[3:28:35.520 --> 3:28:41.800]  the military, I would be pretty skeptical about sending military astronauts up there
[3:28:41.800 --> 3:28:45.840]  with all the expense if I could get the job done with robots.
[3:28:45.840 --> 3:28:53.480]  So yeah, but I think there certainly are limits to what can be done with robots and
[3:28:53.480 --> 3:29:03.120]  still keep that somewhat cloaked from the general public.
[3:29:03.120 --> 3:29:13.800]  The people that accuse the government of improperly cordoning off areas like Area 51 from public
[3:29:13.800 --> 3:29:17.640]  trespassing, what do you think we want to do?
[3:29:17.640 --> 3:29:24.880]  Do you think we want to open up every avenue of classified defense of our country?
[3:29:24.880 --> 3:29:32.120]  No, but I was just asking you with your knowledge, Mr. Aldrin, about secret government programs,
[3:29:32.120 --> 3:29:34.200]  because that is obviously very, very interesting.
[3:29:34.200 --> 3:29:40.920]  The book is Magnificent Desolation, Buzz Aldrin with Ken Abraham, and it's an amazing book.
[3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:43.520]  You're an amazing person, and we really enjoy you being on.
[3:29:43.520 --> 3:29:48.280]  I'd like to say bye to you as we go to break here in five seconds before we let you go,
[3:29:48.280 --> 3:29:49.280]  Mr. Aldrin.
[3:29:49.280 --> 3:29:51.920]  But again, we really want to thank you for coming on with Magnificent Desolation.
[3:29:51.920 --> 3:29:55.680]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.680 --> 3:30:01.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.440 --> 3:30:05.840]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:30:05.840 --> 3:30:06.840]  this summer.
[3:30:06.840 --> 3:30:10.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:30:10.720 --> 3:30:15.640]  Number two, our new energies wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[3:30:15.640 --> 3:30:16.640]  you to have.
[3:30:16.640 --> 3:30:21.680]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:30:21.680 --> 3:30:25.760]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:30:25.760 --> 3:30:28.200]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:30:28.200 --> 3:30:31.760]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[3:30:31.760 --> 3:30:35.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[3:30:35.400 --> 3:30:40.240]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:30:40.240 --> 3:30:44.400]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long
[3:30:44.400 --> 3:30:45.800]  time sponsor of ours.
[3:30:45.800 --> 3:30:52.240]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[3:30:52.240 --> 3:30:56.800]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[3:30:56.800 --> 3:31:01.040]  toll-free 877-327-0365.
[3:31:01.040 --> 3:31:02.400]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:31:02.400 --> 3:31:04.400]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[3:31:04.400 --> 3:31:05.400]  Well, you should.
[3:31:05.400 --> 3:31:09.920]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[3:31:09.920 --> 3:31:10.920]  That's right.
[3:31:10.920 --> 3:31:15.720]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training
[3:31:15.720 --> 3:31:20.640]  Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[3:31:20.640 --> 3:31:25.120]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free, spring-filled armory
[3:31:25.120 --> 3:31:27.920]  XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[3:31:27.920 --> 3:31:32.000]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[3:31:32.000 --> 3:31:35.080]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[3:31:35.080 --> 3:31:39.360]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[3:31:39.360 --> 3:31:40.540]  attitudes.
[3:31:40.540 --> 3:31:42.040]  This is real.
[3:31:42.040 --> 3:31:43.040]  Don't miss out.
[3:31:43.040 --> 3:31:48.760]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course, plus a 30-state concealed weapons permit for
[3:31:48.760 --> 3:31:51.480]  pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.

[3:32:02.160 --> 3:32:06.560]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[3:32:06.560 --> 3:32:09.820]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[3:32:09.820 --> 3:32:14.040]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our
[3:32:14.040 --> 3:32:16.760]  lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy.
[3:32:16.760 --> 3:32:21.560]  If we the people do not diligently assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost
[3:32:21.560 --> 3:32:22.560]  forever.
[3:32:22.560 --> 3:32:27.260]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves
[3:32:27.260 --> 3:32:31.760]  to be led as lambs to the slaughter, sitting passively by, and accepting the chains of
[3:32:31.760 --> 3:32:35.640]  slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[3:32:35.640 --> 3:32:38.480]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[3:32:38.480 --> 3:32:42.720]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market, and
[3:32:42.720 --> 3:32:45.800]  numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[3:33:06.280 --> 3:33:12.520]  Okay, we're going to do five more minutes with Commander Col. Captain Buzz Aldrin, Doctor.
[3:33:12.520 --> 3:33:18.200]  The book is Buzz Aldrin, Magnificent Desolation, and he's going to come back for five minutes
[3:33:18.200 --> 3:33:24.720]  and break down, answer the people that say we didn't go to the moon or it was a hoax.
[3:33:24.720 --> 3:33:27.520]  So Buzz Aldrin, you've got the floor, sir.
[3:33:27.520 --> 3:33:29.520]  Please break it down for us.
[3:33:29.520 --> 3:33:33.880]  Well, we went to the moon.
[3:33:33.880 --> 3:33:41.680]  There are laser radar reflectors that are on the moon that we show pictures of, that
[3:33:41.680 --> 3:33:43.360]  we brought back.
[3:33:43.360 --> 3:33:51.320]  And anybody who has a laser beam can send it to the moon and it'll bounce back to you
[3:33:51.320 --> 3:33:54.480]  and you can measure the frequency change.
[3:33:54.480 --> 3:34:03.040]  And that's why it's there, to measure how Africa drifts away from South America and
[3:34:03.040 --> 3:34:09.440]  other geological and scientific measurements like that.
[3:34:09.440 --> 3:34:15.520]  I think most important is the fact that we were clearly in a race with another highly
[3:34:15.520 --> 3:34:24.960]  technical capable country, the Soviet Union, that claimed they never went to the moon,
[3:34:24.960 --> 3:34:31.440]  but they were preparing to, and they had landers and they had people picked out.
[3:34:31.440 --> 3:34:37.840]  And of course, after we were on the moon, they had rovers up there, so they fully had
[3:34:37.840 --> 3:34:43.520]  the ability to know whether we landed there or not.
[3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:51.080]  And they never joined the conspiracy that said that America never went to the moon.
[3:34:51.080 --> 3:34:56.800]  So I think that's the strongest argument, but whatever it is, it's supported by gullible
[3:34:56.800 --> 3:35:01.760]  people that want to believe the bizarre, the unusual, the fantasy.
[3:35:01.760 --> 3:35:06.560]  And that's okay because that's human nature to be curious about things.
[3:35:06.560 --> 3:35:11.000]  Well, I read a book by a prominent person who says we didn't go to the moon and he says
[3:35:11.000 --> 3:35:15.560]  there's plants on the moon and it has an atmosphere in that it rotates, but everybody
[3:35:15.560 --> 3:35:21.520]  can look at the moon and tell it doesn't rotate, or at least, I mean, that's crazy.
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:28.080]  Well it rotates once a revolution around the earth, that's the way it keeps the same side
[3:35:28.080 --> 3:35:36.520]  based because that's the minimum tidal effect that the earth and the sun have on the surface
[3:35:36.520 --> 3:35:39.040]  of the moon.
[3:35:39.040 --> 3:35:49.880]  And things tend to have friction, dissipate energy to a point where there is no friction
[3:35:49.880 --> 3:35:55.600]  anymore, and if you want to carry that to an extreme, if the earth and the moon were
[3:35:55.600 --> 3:36:02.200]  around long enough, the moon would move further and further and further away until there was
[3:36:02.200 --> 3:36:08.560]  no tidal effect of the moon on the earth and the same side of the earth faced the moon
[3:36:08.560 --> 3:36:09.560]  and vice versa.
[3:36:09.560 --> 3:36:10.560]  Yeah.
[3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:13.880]  What do you, when you bring up the Russian issue of them tracking the mission and they
[3:36:13.880 --> 3:36:17.840]  would have blown the whistle on us, I guess people then say that that was a conspiracy
[3:36:17.840 --> 3:36:18.840]  too?
[3:36:18.840 --> 3:36:20.720]  I don't know what they say.
[3:36:20.720 --> 3:36:25.160]  I think they dodged the question.
[3:36:25.160 --> 3:36:28.120]  What about the Van Allen radiation belt though, with the film?
[3:36:28.120 --> 3:36:31.720]  Because I did talk to one of the guys on the RCA cameras and he said, yeah, there was some
[3:36:31.720 --> 3:36:36.440]  film problem, but I guess sometimes the film would be okay, sometimes it wouldn't be because
[3:36:36.440 --> 3:36:40.480]  I guess the belts are different strengths, sir.
[3:36:40.480 --> 3:36:44.880]  Well you're passing through them pretty, and pretty much of a hurry.
[3:36:44.880 --> 3:36:51.680]  We have a concern about what we call the South Atlantic anomaly, which is where some of
[3:36:51.680 --> 3:36:59.320]  the radiation dips down to lower altitudes around maybe 400 miles above the surface of
[3:36:59.320 --> 3:37:00.320]  the earth.
[3:37:00.320 --> 3:37:07.400]  So we don't want to send spacecraft into that South Atlantic anomaly for long periods
[3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:12.280]  of time or many, many, many orbits.
[3:37:12.280 --> 3:37:19.880]  But certainly radiation detectors that went through the Van Allen belt as scientific probes
[3:37:19.880 --> 3:37:29.320]  do all the time that are leaving the earth and heading for geosynchronous, where we have
[3:37:29.320 --> 3:37:33.880]  our communication satellites.
[3:37:33.880 --> 3:37:38.160]  Those are above the Van Allen belt.
[3:37:38.160 --> 3:37:45.560]  The communication satellites are essentially three diameters above the surface of the earth,
[3:37:45.560 --> 3:37:52.160]  and the moon is 10 times that distance away.
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:37:58.800]  The moon focus is about one diameter of Mars away from the surface of Mars, and it goes
[3:37:58.800 --> 3:38:00.760]  around in seven hours.
[3:38:00.760 --> 3:38:03.320]  So very, very much closer.
[3:38:03.320 --> 3:38:05.440]  Well Buzz Aldrin, the book is magnificent desolation.
[3:38:05.440 --> 3:38:06.880]  I'm not going to keep you any longer.
[3:38:06.880 --> 3:38:08.640]  I really appreciate your time.
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:12.280]  Maybe I can have you up some time for a 30 minute interview just about your vision of
[3:38:12.280 --> 3:38:13.760]  going to Mars.
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:18.280]  I know humanity is reaching out to the stars, and I know we have incredible potential thanks
[3:38:18.280 --> 3:38:24.000]  to people like you and the courage that you and other astronauts have had, and I really
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:27.680]  do appreciate the time that you graciously spent with us.
[3:38:27.680 --> 3:38:33.040]  And I hope that before I become an old man, or even sooner, before you leave this planet
[3:38:33.040 --> 3:38:38.800]  many years from now, that we get to find out what that monolith or obelisk is on the moon
[3:38:38.800 --> 3:38:39.800]  of Mars.
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:47.480]  So, Buzz Aldrin, let me just say one more thing, we need a serious debate here before
[3:38:47.480 --> 3:38:54.960]  we begin to spend large, large amounts on going to Mars, and I don't think we need to
[3:38:54.960 --> 3:38:56.800]  do that for another 10 years.
[3:38:56.800 --> 3:38:59.040]  That's why we have a two-phase program.
[3:38:59.040 --> 3:39:06.040]  The debate is, do we want to just go there a couple of times and then let the Congress
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:11.640]  spend the money on earmarks, or do we want to commit to permanence?
[3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:16.520]  That's continuous increasing settlements at Mars.
[3:39:16.520 --> 3:39:19.120]  That's the choice we need to make.
[3:39:19.120 --> 3:39:27.680]  And anything you folks can do to begin to address that subject, is it worth expending
[3:39:27.680 --> 3:39:34.760]  the money to send humans and their judgment and their curiosity and their investigation?
[3:39:34.760 --> 3:39:47.800]  Or do we want to do that with only robots, because our moon is a very hostile place.
[3:39:47.800 --> 3:39:51.640]  It's not inviting at all, and the same thing applies there.
[3:39:51.640 --> 3:40:00.600]  We can do robots much, much easier than, of course, on Mars, and I think better than humans
[3:40:00.600 --> 3:40:01.600]  on the moon.
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:05.040]  What I was going to say is it's good to send humans, isn't it, because it keeps us in the
[3:40:05.040 --> 3:40:06.040]  game.
[3:40:06.040 --> 3:40:09.840]  If we start getting to where we only have robots, we might turn into, you know, over
[3:40:09.840 --> 3:40:14.240]  to eons and to creatures that don't even have arms and legs and just sit there as blobs
[3:40:14.240 --> 3:40:15.440]  like something out of Wally.
[3:40:15.440 --> 3:40:18.640]  Have you seen that movie Wally, where there are all these blobs that have all-
[3:40:18.640 --> 3:40:27.320]  Yeah, but more important than that, other nations will go where we choose not to go.
[3:40:27.320 --> 3:40:30.000]  Yeah, since you brought that up, let me just ask you this final question.
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:34.320]  I mean, we'll let you go, again, Buzz Aldrin, second to Walk on the Moon, a famous astronaut
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:38.320]  here, one of the most famous, if not the most famous next to Neil Armstrong.
[3:40:38.320 --> 3:40:43.600]  There's been a call for globalism, global government, to, it's saying, then man can
[3:40:43.600 --> 3:40:48.880]  go to the stars, but this, having a big global bureaucracy, I think, would actually stamp
[3:40:48.880 --> 3:40:51.600]  out a lot of innovation of the different nation states.
[3:40:51.600 --> 3:40:55.840]  What's your view on people that call for a new world order?
[3:40:55.840 --> 3:41:02.600]  Well, they're seeking power where it perhaps is not deserved.
[3:41:02.600 --> 3:41:11.640]  Space-faring nations, those with the capability of sending objects for themselves or for others
[3:41:11.640 --> 3:41:18.320]  are space-faring nations and they're the ones, and only the ones that should have a say.
[3:41:18.320 --> 3:41:25.800]  Otherwise, it's going to be, I want what some favored other nation has.
[3:41:25.800 --> 3:41:34.800]  You know, we do need international involvement, but we need strong, strong leadership, and
[3:41:34.800 --> 3:41:41.040]  I think that's where the United States has the opportunity to be that leader.
[3:41:41.040 --> 3:41:47.640]  But are you overall, then, you don't like the globalism or world government then?
[3:41:47.640 --> 3:41:49.120]  No.
[3:41:49.120 --> 3:41:57.640]  I like space-faring nations determine what goes up above 100 kilometers and what comes
[3:41:57.640 --> 3:42:02.160]  down and what protects the assets there.
[3:42:02.160 --> 3:42:05.120]  Is that a good name for you, a space-fair, not just an astronaut?
[3:42:05.120 --> 3:42:06.120]  Well, yeah.
[3:42:06.120 --> 3:42:13.640]  I mean, below 100 kilometers, you can throw rocks, you can fire mortars, rocket grenades.
[3:42:13.640 --> 3:42:19.560]  You can do whatever you want and we'll deal with those terrestrial problems of human rights,
[3:42:19.560 --> 3:42:26.040]  of piracy, of stealing, and all those other things.
[3:42:26.040 --> 3:42:34.000]  But let's have a separation for the benefit of what goes on because things can collide
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:43.200]  with each other and eventually irresponsible actions, accidentally or on purpose, can prohibit
[3:42:43.200 --> 3:42:46.800]  the use of space by anybody.
[3:42:46.800 --> 3:42:52.920]  Just because there's too much up there and it'll run into anything that you want to
[3:42:52.920 --> 3:42:59.680]  put up there for useful purposes, it'll knock out your direct TV, it'll knock out your
[3:42:59.680 --> 3:43:00.680]  weather forecast.
[3:43:00.680 --> 3:43:02.440]  What do you think of the weaponization of space?
[3:43:02.440 --> 3:43:08.120]  I mean, do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing?
[3:43:08.120 --> 3:43:10.400]  I don't call that weaponization.
[3:43:10.400 --> 3:43:14.640]  I call that prudent behavior.
[3:43:14.640 --> 3:43:22.480]  If you have assets in space and some rogue nation can threaten you, you should have the
[3:43:22.480 --> 3:43:30.440]  ability to defend yourself against those costal acts.
[3:43:30.440 --> 3:43:36.200]  But the country that gets a dominance in space could then set up an off-world system and
[3:43:36.200 --> 3:43:41.000]  really almost split into two species, have the dominant empire that's space-based, and
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:43.960]  then kind of the suboid minions back on Earth.
[3:43:43.960 --> 3:43:48.400]  I guess those are debates we should be having, though.
[3:43:48.400 --> 3:44:00.120]  Well, I think that we all like the pleasures down here, and those are subject to conflict.
[3:44:00.120 --> 3:44:06.080]  I think we need to be judicious, and I think you're projecting way far ahead to have a
[3:44:06.080 --> 3:44:13.680]  space species only that's in conflict with a terrestrial species only.
[3:44:13.680 --> 3:44:17.560]  Now I know, but you know a couple hundred years is the blink of an eye, and the way technology
[3:44:17.560 --> 3:44:19.960]  is advancing and developing.
[3:44:19.960 --> 3:44:23.360]  I just read some of the white papers put out by governments about what they believe is
[3:44:23.360 --> 3:44:27.440]  going to happen, even here on the Earth with genetic engineering and the rest of it.
[3:44:27.440 --> 3:44:32.000]  Again, Buzz Aldrin, we've been so honored to have all this time with you.
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:34.600]  Feel free to do anything else you'd like to add or if you need to go.
[3:44:34.600 --> 3:44:37.680]  Feel us say you farewell, I'm going by Osh to you.
[3:44:37.680 --> 3:44:46.120]  Buzz Aldrin, you're a really nice fellow and have a lot of courage, and we really appreciate
[3:44:46.120 --> 3:44:47.120]  you coming on with us.
[3:44:47.120 --> 3:44:48.880]  All righty, thank you.
[3:44:48.880 --> 3:44:49.880]  Take care.
[3:44:49.880 --> 3:44:50.880]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:44:50.880 --> 3:44:55.360]  Buzz Aldrin, 45-minute interview, and I skipped a break.
[3:44:55.360 --> 3:44:57.720]  I do that more and more at Alan Key's on all this is happening.
[3:44:57.720 --> 3:45:02.640]  It's only a fourth hour, though, for the advertisers.
[3:45:02.640 --> 3:45:05.640]  I said I was going to get into all this other crazy stuff.
[3:45:05.640 --> 3:45:07.800]  What happens is I got these great producers out here.
[3:45:07.800 --> 3:45:11.680]  We got Jaren Nyhart doing it, and we got Paul Hartman.
[3:45:11.680 --> 3:45:12.680]  We got Rob Do.
[3:45:12.680 --> 3:45:15.640]  Rob Do is doing computer and video editing.
[3:45:15.640 --> 3:45:20.480]  They're in a run-in-the-live TV show, and now that I got three producers who also do
[3:45:20.480 --> 3:45:23.840]  other jobs, but three of them, I mean, it's just like, hey, want Buzz Aldrin?
[3:45:23.840 --> 3:45:24.840]  Yeah, get him.
[3:45:24.840 --> 3:45:25.960]  Hey, want this person?
[3:45:25.960 --> 3:45:26.960]  Want that person?
[3:45:26.960 --> 3:45:28.880]  They really do a great professional job.
[3:45:28.880 --> 3:45:33.280]  Want to commend the team out there for getting Buzz Aldrin.
[3:45:33.280 --> 3:45:37.840]  Look, ladies and gentlemen, I've had Schmidt on, Dr. Schmidt, and I've had Dr. Aldrin on.
[3:45:37.840 --> 3:45:42.160]  We're going to get all these astronauts on, and we're going to get some of them on that
[3:45:42.160 --> 3:45:48.080]  are talking about the advanced technologies and hidden agendas, but I dare somebody to
[3:45:48.080 --> 3:45:51.920]  get Buzz Aldrin up and then start being mean to him and tell him we didn't go to the moon.
[3:45:51.920 --> 3:45:56.720]  I have a lot of friends that think it's all a hoax and a fraud, and I have my questions,
[3:45:56.720 --> 3:46:01.440]  but analyzing it, I think it's clear they've got a lot of more advanced technology.
[3:46:01.440 --> 3:46:04.960]  They don't want the public knowing about, and a lot of what we're showing is kind of
[3:46:04.960 --> 3:46:07.080]  the 1930s tinker toys.
[3:46:07.080 --> 3:46:12.080]  You heard what I brought up, Werner von Braun on the space shuttle, 1934, 1935.
[3:46:12.080 --> 3:46:14.480]  That was accurate with Dr. Aldrin.
[3:46:14.480 --> 3:46:20.880]  They tell us the SR-71 Blackbird in service in the mid-1950s is the fastest plane we
[3:46:20.880 --> 3:46:21.880]  have.
[3:46:21.880 --> 3:46:27.120]  That 50-plus years later, I don't know, what's 55 to 2009?
[3:46:27.120 --> 3:46:30.200]  That's 55, 54 years later.
[3:46:30.200 --> 3:46:36.160]  If you believe that a 54-year-old 55 will develop in 1950, it's really 59 years old,
[3:46:36.160 --> 3:46:37.760]  but in service in 55.
[3:46:37.760 --> 3:46:44.560]  If you believe a 59-year-old aircraft is the fastest aircraft we've got, you are insane.
[3:46:44.560 --> 3:46:48.420]  And we've already had a split off with the more advanced technologies in the military
[3:46:48.420 --> 3:46:50.800]  and corporate reservations.
[3:46:50.800 --> 3:46:56.000]  We need to have a larger debate about this, and so I brought Buzz Aldrin on about that.
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:46:57.000]  I just know this.
[3:46:57.000 --> 3:47:01.400]  There's a lot of credible criticism of moon landing being a hoax, but there's also a lot
[3:47:01.400 --> 3:47:06.320]  of it, like you take, behold a pale horse.
[3:47:06.320 --> 3:47:07.560]  People kept telling me, read it, read it, read it.
[3:47:07.560 --> 3:47:10.120]  I finally got it a few months ago and read the whole thing.
[3:47:10.120 --> 3:47:14.360]  I'd read about a third of it back in the late 90s, and there's plants on the moon.
[3:47:14.360 --> 3:47:16.240]  It rotates every day.
[3:47:16.240 --> 3:47:26.160]  You don't need a spacesuit on the moon, Jesus is killed by aliens with holograms, and it's
[3:47:26.160 --> 3:47:27.160]  in there.
[3:47:27.160 --> 3:47:29.360]  People then email me when I talk about that and say, I'm a liar.
[3:47:29.360 --> 3:47:30.360]  It doesn't say that.
[3:47:30.360 --> 3:47:31.360]  Whatever.
[3:47:31.360 --> 3:47:32.920]  The book says that, and anybody who's read it knows that.
[3:47:32.920 --> 3:47:34.160]  Get Bermas is here, isn't he?
[3:47:34.160 --> 3:47:35.160]  He printed that off the other day.
[3:47:35.160 --> 3:47:36.160]  Get him to run that.
[3:47:36.160 --> 3:47:37.160]  I don't want to show people that.
[3:47:37.160 --> 3:47:42.040]  The only point is, is that then I look at it and there's, I have experienced people
[3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:45.040]  saying everything's a hoax because they don't believe anything can be real.
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:47.200]  In fact, they say it's fake that I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[3:47:47.200 --> 3:47:51.040]  No, they arrested the Vanity Fair reporter last year, the People Magazine reporter,
[3:47:51.040 --> 3:47:52.040]  the CBS reporter.
[3:47:52.040 --> 3:47:56.600]  I got in and out by the grace of God, and probably because I snuck in with Mike Hansen.
[3:47:56.600 --> 3:47:58.040]  Most reporters sneak in by themselves.
[3:47:58.040 --> 3:48:01.120]  I thought two people would be good, but throw them off.
[3:48:01.120 --> 3:48:05.840]  We really did, you know, put the Joker poster out and have people put them up in hundreds
[3:48:05.840 --> 3:48:07.240]  of cities nationwide.
[3:48:07.240 --> 3:48:11.040]  We really did start 9-11 Truth and expose that as an inside job.
[3:48:11.040 --> 3:48:15.760]  We really did come out and say they're going to use flu as a hoax for martial law.
[3:48:15.760 --> 3:48:21.480]  And now Ron Paul and Congressman Brown and former Congressman Dick Armee are saying
[3:48:21.480 --> 3:48:22.480]  that.
[3:48:22.480 --> 3:48:24.280]  And governors are writing letters.
[3:48:24.280 --> 3:48:28.560]  The governor's association to the president saying, we don't want 400,000 regular army
[3:48:28.560 --> 3:48:29.720]  in America.
[3:48:29.720 --> 3:48:32.720]  It's an unconstitutional power grab and takeover.
[3:48:32.720 --> 3:48:36.960]  And we have gotten in many cities over 75%.
[3:48:36.960 --> 3:48:42.840]  This is now coming out in Oregon and California and Michigan and some town, 75% of the school
[3:48:42.840 --> 3:48:46.920]  kids aren't taking the vaccines now because we woke people up.
[3:48:46.920 --> 3:48:48.840]  I know we can affect change.
[3:48:48.840 --> 3:48:50.800]  I know we have power as a species.
[3:48:50.800 --> 3:48:54.360]  I know we can do incredible things.
[3:48:54.360 --> 3:48:58.800]  And I know I've talked to people with national security letters and people who are high level
[3:48:58.800 --> 3:49:03.640]  retired engineers and people that ran the cameras and all the rest of it.
[3:49:03.640 --> 3:49:09.800]  And they say the word is there was a whole other space program even more advanced going
[3:49:09.800 --> 3:49:10.800]  on.
[3:49:10.800 --> 3:49:12.840]  And what we were seeing was tinker toys.
[3:49:12.840 --> 3:49:16.880]  And so it was theater, but only theater.
[3:49:16.880 --> 3:49:21.640]  Did you hear Aldrin hinting at aliens and hinting at Egypt and hinting at monoliths and
[3:49:21.640 --> 3:49:26.800]  obelisk and then putting it out and then pulling back and how excited he got on TV.
[3:49:26.800 --> 3:49:29.400]  And I've talked to other astronauts off record.
[3:49:29.400 --> 3:49:34.680]  I've talked to other people that know astronauts and they say it's just, you wouldn't imagine
[3:49:34.680 --> 3:49:35.680]  what's really going on.
[3:49:35.680 --> 3:49:41.800]  And I know that gets into coast to coast territory, but this is the, you know, something's going
[3:49:41.800 --> 3:49:42.800]  on.
[3:49:42.800 --> 3:49:46.240]  I don't know what it is.
[3:49:46.240 --> 3:49:48.160]  And it was just amazing interview.
[3:49:48.160 --> 3:49:50.360]  So there you have it.
[3:49:50.360 --> 3:49:52.080]  I know you can do real things.
[3:49:52.080 --> 3:49:58.680]  I also know there are hoaxes and frauds, but I want you to believe in yourselves.
[3:49:58.680 --> 3:50:01.760]  You know, let's say I'm bad, which I'm not.
[3:50:01.760 --> 3:50:03.200]  I mean, I'm the real deal.
[3:50:03.200 --> 3:50:04.680]  It's by proven by my fruits.
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:10.840]  The new owner hates what I'm doing, but regardless, let's just say I'm bad for the sake of argument.
[3:50:10.840 --> 3:50:14.680]  Don't let that stop you from taking action, getting involved, reaching out to other people,
[3:50:14.680 --> 3:50:15.680]  waking them up.
[3:50:15.680 --> 3:50:18.840]  Now I'm going to talk about the Joker contest, the final segment tomorrow.
[3:50:18.840 --> 3:50:24.400]  I will start the show and anybody on the first hour, do I, we got more big guests coming
[3:50:24.400 --> 3:50:25.400]  up this week.
[3:50:25.400 --> 3:50:27.080]  Oh, you got to wait till the guest I got coming up in October.
[3:50:27.080 --> 3:50:35.080]  It's going to blow your mind, but about this whole picture of the vaccines and how they're
[3:50:35.080 --> 3:50:39.320]  killing people and how the flu shot in the trials is killing a bunch of people.
[3:50:39.320 --> 3:50:41.520]  But the good news is it's coming out.
[3:50:41.520 --> 3:50:42.520]  It's a fraud.
[3:50:42.520 --> 3:50:43.520]  It's coming out.
[3:50:43.520 --> 3:50:44.520]  It's on purpose.
[3:50:44.520 --> 3:50:48.040]  Every major guest I have on is aware of world government and eugenics and against it.
[3:50:48.040 --> 3:50:51.880]  Buzz Aldrin was just against the new world order.
[3:50:51.880 --> 3:50:54.560]  You know, I mean, I don't know what to say.
[3:50:54.560 --> 3:50:59.360]  It's just amazing things are happening and we all have incredible power in this world
[3:50:59.360 --> 3:51:02.200]  to control our destiny.
[3:51:02.200 --> 3:51:07.120]  With food prices soaring to all time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value,
[3:51:07.120 --> 3:51:11.120]  what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make
[3:51:11.120 --> 3:51:12.960]  it to your dinner table?
[3:51:12.960 --> 3:51:14.360]  Garden in a can.
[3:51:14.360 --> 3:51:18.480]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long term storeable seeds.
[3:51:18.480 --> 3:51:22.160]  Garden in a can is ready when you are, plant them now or store them for when you really
[3:51:22.160 --> 3:51:23.160]  need them.
[3:51:23.160 --> 3:51:27.960]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed on hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along
[3:51:27.960 --> 3:51:32.960]  with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long term production.
[3:51:32.960 --> 3:51:39.960]  Garden in a can, it's that simple, fresh, healthy, easy, only 69.95 for over a half
[3:51:39.960 --> 3:51:43.840]  acre of safe fresh vegetables ready when you are.
[3:51:43.840 --> 3:51:47.800]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden in a can.

[3:52:00.560 --> 3:52:08.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.000 --> 3:52:12.360]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all
[3:52:12.360 --> 3:52:13.800]  of us would like to see.
[3:52:13.800 --> 3:52:18.960]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:18.960 --> 3:52:19.960]  of the American people.
[3:52:19.960 --> 3:52:24.720]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:24.720 --> 3:52:29.840]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:29.840 --> 3:52:37.960]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:37.960 --> 3:52:41.520]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[3:52:41.520 --> 3:52:48.440]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:52:48.440 --> 3:52:53.920]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super
[3:52:53.920 --> 3:52:56.640]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:52:56.640 --> 3:53:01.240]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:53:01.240 --> 3:53:06.240]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters also known as RFID chips in millions
[3:53:06.240 --> 3:53:08.440]  of passports, credit cards and licenses?
[3:53:08.440 --> 3:53:12.460]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[3:53:12.460 --> 3:53:16.320]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to
[3:53:16.320 --> 3:53:20.800]  steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[3:53:20.800 --> 3:53:23.600]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[3:53:23.600 --> 3:53:26.600]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.

[3:54:19.880 --> 3:54:27.280]  Here is the secret government chapter 12, Behold the Pale Horse.
[3:54:27.280 --> 3:54:31.160]  There are areas on the moon where plant life grows and even changes in colors with the
[3:54:31.160 --> 3:54:36.400]  seasons and then it goes on to say that it has an atmosphere and rotates.
[3:54:36.400 --> 3:54:38.240]  Okay, you can't make this up.
[3:54:38.240 --> 3:54:40.240]  Here's the part about aliens and holograms.
[3:54:40.240 --> 3:54:43.800]  Now I read this when somebody sent this to me in the late 90s and laughed at it.
[3:54:43.800 --> 3:54:44.800]  So there.
[3:54:44.800 --> 3:54:48.720]  That's what I say to people that, I mean, this is the guy that claims that I'm a
[3:54:48.720 --> 3:54:52.920]  transvestite at public events wearing nipple bobbers.
[3:54:52.920 --> 3:54:57.080]  I mean, I'm sorry to, I mean, it's just, people keep asking me to respond to this.
[3:54:57.080 --> 3:55:01.160]  Okay, look, I don't believe there's plants on the moon and I don't get up at academy
[3:55:01.160 --> 3:55:03.640]  award events wearing nipple bobbers.
[3:55:03.640 --> 3:55:06.000]  I mean, I just can't handle it anymore.
[3:55:06.000 --> 3:55:07.240]  People keep asking me to respond.
[3:55:07.240 --> 3:55:09.040]  You really want me to go deeper into this?
[3:55:09.040 --> 3:55:11.840]  It's a raving liar.
[3:55:11.840 --> 3:55:12.840]  There you go.
[3:55:12.840 --> 3:55:13.840]  You got what you wanted.
[3:55:13.840 --> 3:55:14.840]  I'm talking about it.
[3:55:14.840 --> 3:55:20.160]  I am a liar that it doesn't need to get worse, it gets more insane.
[3:55:20.160 --> 3:55:25.720]  Plants and the moon rotates and has seasons and turkeys flying by or something.
[3:55:25.720 --> 3:55:27.520]  I mean, it's just absolutely insane.
[3:55:27.520 --> 3:55:29.280]  I just had Buzz Alder on.
[3:55:29.280 --> 3:55:32.280]  I'm talking about this because he gets into the moon stuff.
[3:55:32.280 --> 3:55:34.040]  People are like, have you read this about the moon?
[3:55:34.040 --> 3:55:37.280]  So I read it and it's like plants in the movie.
[3:55:37.280 --> 3:55:42.760]  Well, you know, that doesn't mean I don't think there's some hoaxing going on.
[3:55:42.760 --> 3:55:48.440]  But the info I've been given is because they don't want anybody to see the real technology
[3:55:48.440 --> 3:55:49.440]  they've got.
[3:55:49.440 --> 3:55:50.680]  I believe we're being lied to.
[3:55:50.680 --> 3:55:51.680]  Let's get that straight.
[3:55:51.680 --> 3:55:52.680]  Okay.
[3:55:52.680 --> 3:55:53.680]  Look, I'm out of time.
[3:55:53.680 --> 3:55:58.680]  I'm going to start the show tomorrow with 45 minutes on the big picture of the staged
[3:55:58.680 --> 3:56:04.880]  flu, the martial law, finally getting traction, mainline congressman, former congressman,
[3:56:04.880 --> 3:56:10.080]  governor's association, talking about martial law, troops, it's really happening and knowing
[3:56:10.080 --> 3:56:15.680]  it's happening and knowing it's wrong and people speaking out beforehand will nix them
[3:56:15.680 --> 3:56:17.280]  being able to do this.
[3:56:17.280 --> 3:56:20.640]  Then the Cointel Pro will attack and say, see, it didn't happen.
[3:56:20.640 --> 3:56:21.640]  But that's okay.
[3:56:21.640 --> 3:56:25.040]  At least we still have our country and our economy and our future.
[3:56:25.040 --> 3:56:26.240]  So we've been right.
[3:56:26.240 --> 3:56:27.760]  It's all coming true.
[3:56:27.760 --> 3:56:33.440]  Exactly as we said, you have all done a job off the charts good.
[3:56:33.440 --> 3:56:43.720]  You've all done a job off the charts good dealing with the Obama Joker posters with infowars.com.
[3:56:43.720 --> 3:56:48.760]  We're going to do one that says bank heist, bank robber, we're going to do one that says
[3:56:48.760 --> 3:56:49.760]  liar.
[3:56:49.760 --> 3:56:51.440]  We're going to do one that says in the war.
[3:56:51.440 --> 3:56:54.240]  They're all up on the flyer page at infowars.com.
[3:56:54.240 --> 3:56:56.160]  Just click on the contest page.
[3:56:56.160 --> 3:56:57.880]  We're making a bigger article about it all.
[3:56:57.880 --> 3:56:58.960]  It's about the First Amendment.
[3:56:58.960 --> 3:57:00.680]  It's about free speech worldwide.
[3:57:00.680 --> 3:57:05.640]  It's about the people seeing the power of going out and engaging in the First Amendment.
[3:57:05.640 --> 3:57:11.840]  Obama said in the Washington Post to his members to stick favorable posters of him on stop signs.
[3:57:11.840 --> 3:57:13.560]  We said do only what's legal.
[3:57:13.560 --> 3:57:18.760]  And that's in commons areas where other signs are up in areas where that's allowed.
[3:57:18.760 --> 3:57:23.920]  The media has a state investigation like we're Al Qaeda, they're talking about the victims.
[3:57:23.920 --> 3:57:29.880]  It's all blown up on their face, their hypocrisy, their clear double standard.
[3:57:29.880 --> 3:57:33.600]  And this has resonated with people and it's going to end up being bigger than the Andre
[3:57:33.600 --> 3:57:35.800]  has a posse thing that went on for a decade.
[3:57:35.800 --> 3:57:41.200]  You watch these Obama posters and it shows the power of the people just putting him up
[3:57:41.200 --> 3:57:44.520]  as a criminal destroys all of his power.
[3:57:44.520 --> 3:57:49.320]  And thus all the new order agenda that's coupled up to him.
[3:57:49.320 --> 3:57:53.560]  I do want to just in closing encourage people to buy the different posters of Obama.
[3:57:53.560 --> 3:57:54.960]  Well, the posters are free.
[3:57:54.960 --> 3:57:57.560]  The different t-shirts wear them.
[3:57:57.560 --> 3:58:03.320]  You've got the Bush Joker t-shirts, by the way, which are just absolutely scary.
[3:58:03.320 --> 3:58:08.080]  Our actual graphics lady did those really captures his demonic personality.
[3:58:08.080 --> 3:58:12.800]  We're going to create one with Bush on the back and Obama on the front and vice versa.
[3:58:12.800 --> 3:58:15.960]  That's about to go up on the shopping cart, get the videos, get the books, get them out
[3:58:15.960 --> 3:58:16.960]  to people.
[3:58:16.960 --> 3:58:21.040]  And you also then fund us when you support us to expand our operation.
[3:58:21.040 --> 3:58:22.040]  It's symbiotic.
[3:58:22.040 --> 3:58:24.480]  We're having great success against the globalist.
[3:58:24.480 --> 3:58:25.960]  They can be defeated.
[3:58:25.960 --> 3:58:29.920]  We just had Buzz Aldrin basically saying down with the new world order.
[3:58:29.920 --> 3:58:30.920]  Huge guest jam-packed.
[3:58:30.920 --> 3:58:35.520]  We had the pale horse militia guy on the first part of the show.
[3:58:35.520 --> 3:58:37.640]  That's coming up now, infowars.com.
[3:58:37.640 --> 3:58:38.640]  Great job, crew.
[3:58:38.640 --> 3:58:40.640]  That was a good transmission.
[3:58:40.640 --> 3:58:41.640]  Ha-ha!
[3:58:41.640 --> 3:58:47.440]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[3:58:47.440 --> 3:58:51.240]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[3:58:51.240 --> 3:58:55.040]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:58:55.040 --> 3:58:59.400]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[3:58:59.400 --> 3:59:00.400]  do you want?
[3:59:00.400 --> 3:59:05.920]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:59:05.920 --> 3:59:07.400]  Food is your only ammunition.
[3:59:07.400 --> 3:59:08.640]  How much do you want?
[3:59:08.640 --> 3:59:09.720]  When do you want it?
[3:59:09.720 --> 3:59:11.680]  Now or after the battle starts?
[3:59:11.680 --> 3:59:12.800]  When will you need it?
[3:59:12.800 --> 3:59:14.920]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:59:14.920 --> 3:59:16.280]  Will there be any food?
[3:59:16.280 --> 3:59:17.720]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:59:17.720 --> 3:59:21.840]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:59:21.840 --> 3:59:23.040]  and be immunized?
[3:59:23.040 --> 3:59:26.800]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:59:26.800 --> 3:59:30.400]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:59:30.400 --> 3:59:31.640]  How much will you need?
[3:59:31.640 --> 3:59:32.640]  We don't know.
[3:59:32.640 --> 3:59:33.640]  How much do you want?
[3:59:33.640 --> 3:59:34.640]  All you can get.
[3:59:34.640 --> 3:59:35.640]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:59:35.640 --> 3:59:38.760]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:59:38.760 --> 3:59:46.160]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:59:46.160 --> 3:59:54.080]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
