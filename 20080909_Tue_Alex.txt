[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:21.400]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.400 --> 00:32.800]  iraq is a laboratory afghanistan is a laboratory georgia south asetia abkhazia
[00:32.800 --> 00:41.640]  our laboratories laboratories in oppression in scientific dictatorship in
[00:41.640 --> 00:47.680]  elimination and when you go to the RNC or the DNC and see the police state
[00:47.680 --> 00:56.760]  control grid that is admittedly a laboratory on how to corral and
[00:56.760 --> 01:02.520]  suppress and control populations as we go forward into the brave new new
[01:02.520 --> 01:08.640]  world order system and control grid I raised that issue on this ninth day of
[01:08.640 --> 01:15.200]  september 2008 live Tuesday edition because of secret killing program is key
[01:15.200 --> 01:23.600]  in iraq bob woodward says the dramatic drop in violence in iraq is due in large
[01:23.600 --> 01:29.520]  part to a secret program u.s. military is used to kill terrorists according to a
[01:29.520 --> 01:36.560]  new book by Pulitzer prize-winning journalist bob woodward and there's a
[01:36.560 --> 01:41.960]  layer after layer after layer of lies and propaganda and deceit in this story
[01:41.960 --> 01:46.840]  we're gonna walk through it number one notice that anyone who resists being
[01:46.840 --> 01:53.960]  occupied or killed is called a terrorist they also cooked up a few years ago
[01:53.960 --> 01:59.200]  even before the war started a plan to go in stage violence liquidate the
[01:59.200 --> 02:03.480]  military the government so there'd be a civil war then later pay off the
[02:03.480 --> 02:11.560]  warring factions and declare victory victory is five and a half years of carnage
[02:11.840 --> 02:16.640]  victory is genocide against the iraqi people and then you say oh we just had
[02:16.640 --> 02:23.760]  this surge idea it works so great we won the war victory victory victory
[02:24.320 --> 02:32.560]  meanwhile it's all a big laboratory in through the wall ground-pentrating radar
[02:32.560 --> 02:44.080]  technology new smart bombs new smart guns du weapons humet spies radiation
[02:44.080 --> 02:50.240]  guns the program which woodward compares to the world war two era Manhattan
[02:50.240 --> 02:56.120]  project that developed the atomic bomb see it's a huge giant secret program must
[02:56.120 --> 03:00.440]  remain secret for now or it would get people killed woodward said Monday on
[03:00.440 --> 03:06.800]  CNN's Larry King live it's a wonderful example of how the American ingenuity
[03:06.800 --> 03:13.000]  solved a problem in war as we often have woodward said I'll see America did a
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.100]  great job while America is being dismantled the borders are being
[03:16.100 --> 03:19.880]  liquidated while the dollars being imploded well fanny man Freddy Mack are
[03:19.880 --> 03:25.960]  being bankrupted on the people's backs all America ceases to exist while its
[03:25.960 --> 03:30.160]  bill of rights and Constitution and Fourth Amendment and they like always
[03:30.160 --> 03:35.080]  tell you how it's for America in the war within secret wine house history
[03:35.080 --> 03:39.440]  woodward discloses the existence of secret operational capabilities developed
[03:39.440 --> 03:44.000]  by the military to locate target and kill leaders of an al-Qaeda in Iraq and
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.280]  other insurgent leaders national security advisor Stephen Hadley in a written
[03:50.280 --> 03:54.040]  statement reacting to woodward's book acknowledged the new strategy yet he
[03:54.040 --> 03:58.880]  disputed woodward's conclusion that the surge of 30,000 US troops in Iraq was
[03:58.880 --> 04:03.600]  not the primary reason for decline in violent attacks it was the surge that
[04:03.600 --> 04:08.880]  provided more resources and a security context to support newly developed
[04:08.880 --> 04:18.440]  techniques and operations Hadley wrote so if you think a million 300,000 dead
[04:18.440 --> 04:26.240]  Iraqis 5,000 dead US troops over 50,000 maimed 5,000 that died in country another
[04:26.240 --> 04:30.440]  15,000 died outside they cook the books there like everything else if you call
[04:30.440 --> 04:35.280]  our name being destroyed lying to go to war victory then we had a victory you
[04:35.280 --> 04:40.920]  call this our government then we had a victory but we didn't have anything we
[04:40.920 --> 04:46.480]  had America's name and Treasury destroyed but what are these super weapons
[04:46.480 --> 04:53.680]  what is this super tactic that's as big as the Manhattan project what is it
[04:53.680 --> 04:58.680]  we'll talk about that when we get back

[08:28.000 --> 08:36.280]  shifted into a police state really doesn't do justice to the reality it's
[08:36.280 --> 08:46.360]  being converted into a surveillance eugenics extermination grid it is
[08:46.360 --> 08:54.920]  being turned into a mechanized dehumanization platform and Bob Woodward
[08:54.920 --> 09:00.480]  comes out hint-hint total spook that he is used to bring down Nixon because he
[09:00.480 --> 09:05.240]  wasn't playing ball I'm not defending Nixon comes out and says oh the surge is

[09:13.320 --> 09:18.240]  matter so we have to start over new and con the public with a new bird cage
[09:18.240 --> 09:23.280]  liner suck the public back in for another four to eight years and accepting
[09:23.280 --> 09:28.440]  that we're getting legitimate change so we don't rebel so we don't take our
[09:28.440 --> 09:40.000]  country back before the grid is fully in place and remember military and police
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.960]  when you're dying of a controlled bio attack or when you're there by your

[09:51.360 --> 09:57.480]  power trip you like being stupid you like serving the corrupt system you love
[09:57.480 --> 10:04.840]  the lie you love the power trip of the technocracy and so you helped bring our
[10:04.840 --> 10:13.560]  civilization down are they gonna say it's smart dust and nano tech dust a
[10:13.560 --> 10:24.560]  modern ripoff of radioactive isotopes being left in the homes of political
[10:24.560 --> 10:30.280]  enemies so they could then track with special goggles where they walked where
[10:30.280 --> 10:37.400]  they went the meetings they went to a modern example of that is Google the
[10:37.400 --> 10:48.280]  NSA designed and run CIA MIT created that's admitted do no evil haha oh the
[10:48.280 --> 10:55.280]  government's not surveilling us the government the criminal rape gang on a
[10:55.280 --> 11:09.120]  power trip will it be satellites with pinpoint radiation beams will it be
[11:09.120 --> 11:28.520]  see-through wall see-through wall ground penetrating radar sonar will it be
[11:28.520 --> 11:37.320]  hunter seeker biometric projectiles that scan the face of the target and then
[11:37.320 --> 11:46.600]  hunt and seek will it be little nano tech moths flying in off of pheromones and
[11:46.600 --> 11:55.720]  looking for their target what it is is made up propaganda and bull oh they've
[11:55.720 --> 12:06.840]  got c-130s and DC tens with chemical lasers in their noses they've got particle
[12:06.840 --> 12:13.760]  beams radiation beams microwave guns that's all out there kind of like we
[12:13.760 --> 12:17.640]  had a national ID card in 1993 and they're just now telling the slaves now
[12:17.640 --> 12:24.480]  it was not a secret just like we've had a North American Union since 2005 it's
[12:24.480 --> 12:28.560]  public but not popularly known so when they get around to tell them the slaves
[12:28.560 --> 12:33.040]  they'll see they just had the 50th anniversary last year of the European
[12:33.040 --> 12:37.920]  Union and even a lot of Europeans went well wait a minute it didn't start till
[12:37.920 --> 12:42.720]  2000 how's it the 50th and they announced the leaders of Europe said oh well
[12:42.720 --> 12:49.240]  it's really been around since 1957 with the Treaty of Rome so this is just meant
[12:49.240 --> 12:53.680]  to intimidate and scare Russia and China but at another level they're being
[12:53.680 --> 12:59.320]  backdoor given the technology you got a proliferate to keep the arms race going
[12:59.320 --> 13:03.360]  globalist you know hand out nukes here and there hand out nukes to India hand
[13:03.360 --> 13:07.400]  out nukes to China hand out nukes to Russia before that hand out nukes to
[13:07.400 --> 13:15.920]  Pakistan no day one of the Pentagon went in and broke the country into three
[13:15.920 --> 13:22.040]  sectors really four total and then funded the groups to attack each other
[13:22.040 --> 13:31.600]  and had US Special Forces CIA MI6 SAS go around and shoot our troops and shoot
[13:31.600 --> 13:37.600]  our military and shoot contractors and kill different religious leaders to
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.760]  start up fights and attack police stations and they were caught over and
[13:41.760 --> 13:52.480]  over again and Mossad was caught as well even came out mainstream news I mean
[13:52.480 --> 13:57.480]  they said what they do I told you what they do they go in break the country in
[13:57.480 --> 14:02.120]  multiple parts so sectarian violence for five to seven years that's what the
[14:02.120 --> 14:07.760]  Israelis in the Pentagon Israel separately and in the Israeli Defense
[14:07.760 --> 14:13.400]  Forces said they do in 83 by the way they wrote the plan the Pentagon said
[14:13.400 --> 14:21.740]  that in 2000 2001 2003 2002 and they went in and oh my gosh we can't lose the
[14:21.740 --> 14:25.600]  wars they let that go on for four or five years and oh we got a surge and all
[14:25.600 --> 14:31.320]  the surge was was billions of dollars of payments a month to the warlords on a
[14:31.320 --> 14:40.880]  neighborhood by neighborhood basis and if you want to corrupt the military you
[14:40.880 --> 14:46.920]  just come in and give privates 30,000 sergeants 80,000 higher-level sergeants
[14:46.920 --> 14:52.600]  100 200,000 all the different ranks of sergeant millions and millions to
[14:52.600 --> 15:04.760]  colonels hundreds of millions of generals by the head of sent com it's
[15:04.760 --> 15:13.240]  reported gets a cool billion a year that's how this works and they come to
[15:13.240 --> 15:17.960]  our police chiefs and our governors and our mayors and they bought them off at
[15:17.960 --> 15:25.560]  least 20 years ago and if they don't take the payment they get caught with a
[15:25.560 --> 15:29.880]  hooker they get caught with drugs or some corruption comes out that one of
[15:29.880 --> 15:35.680]  their underlings did and that's full spectrum domination so when you hear
[15:35.680 --> 15:41.600]  ads like this one for children and then ads like the next one airing on radio and
[15:41.600 --> 15:50.360]  TV for adults you know what it's about recruiting the criminal group that is
[15:50.360 --> 15:55.120]  radically expanding that will run every facet of our lives through the green
[15:55.120 --> 16:00.920]  environmental bureaucrats and through the terror bureaucrats the bureaucrats that
[16:00.920 --> 16:05.400]  fight terror but are really stauset you're gonna have the hot pressure with
[16:05.400 --> 16:09.680]  the men in black and then you're gonna have the cool pressure with these
[16:09.680 --> 16:17.480]  social services and God help every one of us you want social engineering on

[20:33.920 --> 20:38.640]  been detained in London's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI

[21:00.280 --> 21:04.080]  hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal
[21:04.080 --> 21:07.800]  Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[21:07.800 --> 21:11.480]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[21:11.480 --> 21:14.440]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[21:14.440 --> 21:18.200]  accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[21:18.200 --> 21:21.600]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will
[21:21.600 --> 21:25.120]  skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[21:25.120 --> 21:28.840]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[21:28.840 --> 21:32.760]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[21:32.760 --> 21:36.560]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[21:36.560 --> 21:40.560]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability
[21:40.560 --> 21:45.240]  I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned
[21:45.240 --> 21:48.880]  into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been driven
[21:48.880 --> 21:53.520]  by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for more

[28:03.680 --> 28:06.880]  at the Aztecs look at the Romans look at the Babylonians look at the Chinese
[28:06.880 --> 28:12.880]  look at every culture they go power mad and nuts and the elites always start
[28:12.880 --> 28:16.360]  dressing up like women and drinking blood and sacrificing people I don't know
[28:16.360 --> 28:21.120]  why they always start marrying their horses and smearing themselves with
[28:21.120 --> 28:27.320]  feces and just every other form of degeneracy and you people out there
[28:27.320 --> 28:33.880]  don't know how serious it is I happen to be every day facing it and really

[29:03.240 --> 29:06.960]  think about is data and information and then how they operate and how they
[29:06.960 --> 29:11.360]  splice the propaganda and the fusion of it and I can see their operation I can
[29:11.360 --> 29:15.960]  read their own documents but I can see the overlay the mastery of it I mean
[29:15.960 --> 29:21.360]  these people are just burning geniuses a flame with evil ladies and gentlemen

[33:11.200 --> 33:16.400]  children for literally no reason Christian family and then it even came out
[33:16.400 --> 33:22.800]  in court that the CPS lied she went to jail for it but he was put in the mental
[33:22.800 --> 33:28.560]  institution for complaining about it basically he'll be joining us now in
[33:28.560 --> 33:35.000]  strain you see and I want this to happen to you
[33:38.800 --> 33:43.400]  but I would like to hear from special forces current and former you know they
[33:43.400 --> 33:48.120]  say in this CNN article and Bob Woodward also said on 60 minutes that oh Al Qaeda
[33:48.120 --> 33:52.400]  and I ran of course Al Qaeda as I ran it's not but so what you know you got a
[33:52.400 --> 34:00.600]  public that thinks thinks the Middle East is in that in Antarctica you know he
[34:00.600 --> 34:04.000]  says Al Qaeda knows all about the new weapons system but of course the American
[34:04.000 --> 34:13.280]  people can't be told about any of this well this is all hype what what worked
[34:13.280 --> 34:20.520]  was the White House plan you see you're told that the government plan is to
[34:20.520 --> 34:26.200]  create intelligent dynamic informed young people who have high test scores but
[34:26.200 --> 34:30.240]  the official Department of Education plan is to break up the family prepare
[34:30.240 --> 34:34.760]  the children for institutionalization in prisons or on welfare or in the
[34:34.760 --> 34:41.240]  military this is all stated in public in books like deliberate dumbing down by
[34:41.240 --> 34:44.280]  Charlotte Isherby who was the head of Policy Department of Education we sell
[34:44.280 --> 34:50.480]  her book deliberate dumbing down at info wars.com by the way if you want the
[34:50.480 --> 34:55.440]  sources on that but there are thousands of mainstream articles where they say
[34:55.440 --> 35:02.600]  we've got to eradicate the family it's a disease so the public face of the war on
[35:02.600 --> 35:06.720]  drugs is to stop drugs really it's to ship more drugs in but cut down on the
[35:06.720 --> 35:12.280]  competition to streamline it so the US base and British Central base banks get
[35:12.280 --> 35:15.920]  to launder all the money and leverage it out 10 times 10 with the fractional
[35:15.920 --> 35:20.440]  reserve banking so they leverage it over and over again and to build up a
[35:20.440 --> 35:25.760]  police state a grid to legitimize spy forces surveillance forces domestic
[35:25.760 --> 35:31.080]  police forces federal police forces surveillance so the war on drugs is meant
[35:31.080 --> 35:35.080]  to create a monopoly on the narcotics and ship them to you back to CIA and
[35:35.080 --> 35:40.560]  our own admission was founded by the skull and bones by which was founded by
[35:40.560 --> 35:46.280]  the opium trust the opium monopoly into this country the Lucius trust over there
[35:46.280 --> 35:52.920]  the Russell trust a shipping in and so it was founded out of Yale so that's
[35:52.920 --> 35:59.400]  always been about bringing narcotics in so it's the same thing you know you
[35:59.400 --> 36:03.200]  hear education they want we want to help the kids having to dumb them down turn
[36:03.200 --> 36:10.120]  them into mindless consumers who can't talk and who are the dumbest most
[36:10.120 --> 36:14.680]  uneducated people in the world the most ignorant but the most arrogant and full
[36:14.680 --> 36:19.720]  of themselves at the same time same thing with the war it's meant to be
[36:19.720 --> 36:25.240]  widened it's meant to continue on forever and they stated they were going to
[36:25.240 --> 36:28.720]  Iraq break it in three parts so sectarian violence that's why they disbanded the
[36:28.720 --> 36:33.480]  military disbanded the civil service fired all the police so civil war would
[36:33.480 --> 36:37.320]  break out but it didn't break out so they handed out weapons to their two
[36:37.320 --> 36:41.120]  different factions and then the United States Israel and England committed
[36:41.120 --> 36:46.160]  terrorist attacks it would even come out mainstream news yeah US special forces
[36:46.160 --> 36:50.440]  went in for eight hours and planted bombs in the golden mosque and then blew it up
[36:50.440 --> 37:00.840]  and put it on the US news that the Shiites had done it to the Sunnis and then
[37:00.840 --> 37:06.520]  vice versa blowing up other mosque I mean they even because in America doesn't
[37:06.520 --> 37:12.080]  even really know what a mosque is or what a Sunni or a Shiite is and so you can
[37:12.080 --> 37:22.080]  even have US troops blow it up in front everybody it doesn't even matter and the
[37:22.080 --> 37:26.680]  end they start paying off the factions they do let the police do their job and
[37:26.680 --> 37:32.840]  so the death toll goes down by about half and now the forced inoculations in the
[37:32.840 --> 37:38.240]  government brainwashing and the well I mean it's admitted the first major act
[37:38.240 --> 37:42.560]  was to ban statistic gathering by the Iraqi government they're not allowed to
[37:42.560 --> 37:48.440]  report on cancer rapes murders because you got to do that so those numbers don't
[37:48.440 --> 37:56.160]  conflict with your fake numbers you're putting out but the triple checked
[37:56.160 --> 38:00.800]  separate Lanzik reddish medical journal US medical all of them gone over and
[38:00.800 --> 38:07.280]  looked 1.3 million dead things are going very well that's 1.3 million in the last
[38:07.280 --> 38:12.920]  five and a half years of liberation and of course was over a million and a half
[38:12.920 --> 38:26.160]  in the previous 14 years of liberation and so now they give you your fake victory
[38:26.160 --> 38:33.240]  and say oh super weapons allowed this to happen we can't tell you what this huge
[38:33.240 --> 38:39.480]  program is as big as the Manhattan Project but it's giant and it's secret
[38:39.600 --> 38:49.560]  are they getting ready to announce the space-based particle beams let's see
[38:49.560 --> 38:56.400]  those don't have the power to shoot through the word we've got from James
[38:56.400 --> 39:00.800]  and other sources James weapons quarterly and others and former head of
[39:00.800 --> 39:04.440]  Star Wars have interviewed many times and others as you see you can have a high
[39:04.440 --> 39:10.280]  powered laser in space but it's only going to have maybe one shot in it for
[39:10.280 --> 39:14.240]  what it takes to shoot through concrete or shoot through walls but if you're
[39:14.240 --> 39:23.440]  just firing out of some type of cyclotron particles or to boil it down a
[39:23.440 --> 39:33.160]  radiation gun or if you're dropping from space do you say bows you know they've
[39:33.160 --> 39:36.360]  got them that weigh a hundred pounds they've got them down to weigh just a
[39:36.360 --> 39:47.520]  few ounces I mean by 1980 they had squadrons of robotic do you basically
[39:47.520 --> 39:56.080]  gravity well meteor gun orbital craft can you imagine what they've got now so is
[39:56.080 --> 39:59.120]  that what they're gonna announce are they gonna announce that we drop a little
[39:59.120 --> 40:06.520]  du tubelets little du tarp I mean just a couple ounces dropped out of a
[40:06.520 --> 40:12.360]  gravity well gets up to 30,000 miles an hour and you drop that on a building
[40:12.360 --> 40:19.800]  bye bye you drop that on a bunker bye bye of course they got the big ones to get
[40:19.800 --> 40:29.160]  bunkers 500 a thousand feet 2,000 feet under the ground these are full spectrum
[40:29.160 --> 40:33.600]  dominance global government decapitation weapons they can kill every
[40:33.600 --> 40:39.440]  world leader in the world in five minutes they can decapitate the entire
[40:39.440 --> 40:43.320]  Congress oh you know that's the main target it's not outside that's secondary
[40:43.320 --> 40:48.240]  targets they can decapitate the entire corporate leadership and they brought
[40:48.240 --> 40:55.760]  them into that hangar up in Nebraska on the morning of 9-11 hundreds and
[40:55.760 --> 40:59.720]  hundreds and hundreds of CEOs were called their quote for a secret meeting
[40:59.720 --> 41:06.400]  set up weeks before and were told in a hangar something secret in Nebraska
[41:06.400 --> 41:10.440]  remember that it was in the Associated Press
[41:10.840 --> 41:17.680]  what were they told with Warren Buffett as the master of ceremonies with the
[41:17.680 --> 41:24.120]  head of Northcom there while they ran the attacks while they killed 3,000 of
[41:24.120 --> 41:30.640]  our own people I'm eating set for 8 30 in the morning
[41:30.640 --> 41:39.280]  Eastern time right when it all started in a big hangar with big TV screens and
[41:39.280 --> 41:43.840]  boy those CEOs a lot of them who worked in the World Trade Center who've been
[41:43.840 --> 41:52.280]  called out in a way wonder what they were let in on you see what we're doing
[41:52.280 --> 41:58.640]  right now all of you do exactly as you're told we're now under continuity of
[41:58.640 --> 42:03.920]  government it's in full force this is martial law you do what you're told you'll
[42:03.920 --> 42:07.520]  be well taken care of most of you are fellow travelers with us if you don't
[42:07.520 --> 42:18.120]  you're dead all of you are being watched we know that's what was set and then I
[42:18.120 --> 42:22.640]  think about the fact that I am the biggest person fighting this I don't
[42:22.640 --> 42:31.440]  like that you think I take a thrill out of all these big movie stars being fans
[42:31.440 --> 42:38.080]  of my radio show and TV show all these big music icons talk to a huge one this
[42:38.080 --> 42:45.400]  morning ended up calling us no there's certainly no pleasure in that there's
[42:45.400 --> 42:49.000]  pleasure in a job well done I guess you could say but it's not that well done I
[42:49.000 --> 42:57.080]  don't do that good of a job to know and I have this selfish side of me it's a
[42:57.080 --> 43:05.760]  very small side of me it's like a streetlight you pass in the middle of
[43:05.760 --> 43:08.440]  nowhere in the middle of the night you see it fading off in the distance but I
[43:08.440 --> 43:14.520]  remember that could have been my life that could have been me just working on a
[43:14.520 --> 43:20.240]  farm or working on a ranch or just being a businessman and not having this
[43:20.240 --> 43:28.400]  pressure on me but but that's a lie there wouldn't have been safety in that
[43:28.400 --> 43:31.360]  there wouldn't have been a real future in that there would have just been
[43:31.360 --> 43:36.560]  living in a lie and going into this whole system
[43:36.560 --> 43:46.040]  I mean I've had to come to grips with just how influential this radio show
[43:46.040 --> 43:58.520]  is the enormous influence we have and the responsibility of that it's just
[43:58.520 --> 44:12.440]  staggering I turn it all over to God turn it all over to God but to understand
[44:12.440 --> 44:17.200]  what we're facing to know what we're dealing with in fact 95% of it plus is
[44:17.200 --> 44:24.280]  just all admitted in white papers in Pentagon papers in white papers put out
[44:24.280 --> 44:29.600]  by the Ministry of Defense in England it's written about by futurists it's
[44:29.600 --> 44:41.160]  written about by computer company owners the highest level technocrats they
[44:41.160 --> 44:45.600]  come right out and say like Bill Joy that I talk about so much but many others
[44:45.600 --> 44:50.000]  because he's what the only one that's saying it's bad I went to a big elite
[44:50.000 --> 44:55.320]  meeting of top computer company and IT experts 200 of us and all we talked
[44:55.320 --> 44:59.800]  about basically at the meeting was will the majority be killed with the new
[44:59.800 --> 45:03.240]  technologies we've got are we gonna let them in on it people aren't needed
[45:03.240 --> 45:08.360]  anymore for labor there's a lot of suppressed technology the government you
[45:08.360 --> 45:14.240]  can call it that has all these super weapons and he's like man it's sad that
[45:14.240 --> 45:18.480]  they're talking about killing everybody and he wrote a cover story for Wired
[45:18.480 --> 45:25.680]  magazine April issue 2000 why the future doesn't need us and it was the same
[45:25.680 --> 45:29.840]  thing Theodore Kaczynski said he quoted the unabomber in it you know Theodore
[45:29.840 --> 45:39.440]  Kaczynski volunteered for the CIA in 1964 he was brought into high level
[45:39.440 --> 45:43.240]  mind control projects he was under mind control himself carried out mind control
[45:43.240 --> 45:48.000]  programs that's been in the LA Times and then he was led into a higher level of
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.960]  program and it was explained to him that they were planning to do all this with
[45:50.960 --> 45:55.720]  the GMO and planning to basically end the human species as it's known with this
[45:55.720 --> 46:00.920]  new cybernetic evolution for the elite the extermination of the vast majority
[46:00.920 --> 46:03.960]  and he flipped out and moved out to a place in the middle of nowhere and
[46:03.960 --> 46:11.200]  started bombing the people involved really the only thing a sane man would
[46:11.200 --> 46:16.800]  do if you were gonna go with violence because he believed that was the only
[46:16.800 --> 46:22.920]  way I don't agree with that but I could see a sane man going with that Theodore
[46:22.920 --> 46:31.800]  Kaczynski a genius help us God help us this is all power talks about this is
[46:31.800 --> 46:42.560]  all power deals with this is all they discuss free energy has been invented
[46:42.560 --> 46:48.720]  humans have been cloned and spliced with hundreds of other species for at
[46:48.720 --> 46:53.760]  least 30 years that's now declassified by the way hidden in plain view it's all
[46:53.760 --> 46:58.880]  being disclosed right now and the public doesn't care they're busy acting cool
[46:58.880 --> 47:03.640]  trying to be radical and tough men are trying to you know run around acting
[47:03.640 --> 47:08.320]  radical and studly and like Steve McQueen women are completely insecure under
[47:08.320 --> 47:11.280]  the mind control of Madison Avenue believing they're fat and ugly and
[47:11.280 --> 47:20.720]  obsessing on Weight Watcher everything's gyrating falling apart I mean we we are
[47:20.720 --> 47:27.000]  just just destroyed destructo and I look at the elite I'm like God what have you
[47:27.000 --> 47:35.560]  done and they say full spectrum dominance we are going to aggressively and
[47:35.560 --> 47:42.280]  cold-bloodedly have full spectrum dominance for our families there's only
[47:42.280 --> 47:45.640]  a few hundred families and then we're gonna have a small servant class who's
[47:45.640 --> 47:50.280]  been promised they'll be part of it if they go along and it is you notice the
[47:50.280 --> 47:56.040]  last few James Bond movies one is about genetic engineering and kidnapping
[47:56.040 --> 47:59.200]  people to get their genetics and basically organ harvesting and another is
[47:59.200 --> 48:04.280]  about government-sponsored terror or corporate-sponsored terror and others and
[48:04.280 --> 48:08.600]  Ian Fleming of course was with MI5 and MI6 when it was OSS and this is how they
[48:08.600 --> 48:13.000]  throw it in your face. Remember Moonraker where the big banker had the
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.440]  richest guy in the world teamed up with the other rich people and they're gonna
[48:15.440 --> 48:22.000]  kill everybody on earth for a perfect eugenic society that's what they're
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.280]  doing ladies and gentlemen we don't get to be part of the future we don't get to
[48:27.280 --> 48:35.080]  go forward and they've even told us that this is what they're gonna do to us and
[48:35.080 --> 48:39.160]  the elites don't have control of their laboratories and their GMO they're very
[48:39.160 --> 48:48.440]  reckless and they say we enjoy being reckless yes we know the Hadron heavy
[48:48.440 --> 48:52.480]  reactor that they're gonna be cooling down for the next five years and
[48:52.480 --> 48:57.120]  accelerating the streams what four times stronger than it's ever been seven times
[48:57.120 --> 49:02.680]  and then on and on and on crossing the streams running them into each other and
[49:02.680 --> 49:07.800]  admitting yes it could destroy the earth but it probably won't
[49:09.920 --> 49:17.040]  meanwhile they're recruiting young people to be spies well this song's for
[49:17.040 --> 49:21.120]  you we're gonna come back get into what these super weapons are and then we'll
[49:21.120 --> 49:24.720]  take calls from special forces and people who want to chime in on this
[49:24.720 --> 49:28.200]  we'll be right back stay with us
[49:56.720 --> 50:05.040]  some folks are born silver spoon and they have love don't they have themselves
[50:05.040 --> 50:12.480]  don't they have themselves the jacksman give them the key to the land and when the
[50:12.480 --> 50:24.960]  water's nothing left for school and help and they mean the I ain't no millionaire
[50:24.960 --> 50:27.960]  son
[50:28.320 --> 50:31.320]  it ain't me no
[50:31.320 --> 50:33.320]  it ain't me no
[50:33.320 --> 50:36.320]  I ain't no fortunate one
[50:36.320 --> 50:43.320]  some folks are loved and here it starts playing the line
[50:43.320 --> 50:49.320]  I don't need to send you off to war
[50:49.320 --> 50:54.320]  and when you like them how much should you get
[50:54.320 --> 50:57.320]  they take you more and more
[50:57.320 --> 51:01.320]  more and more and more and more
[51:01.320 --> 51:08.320]  the day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country
[51:08.320 --> 51:12.320]  the enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy
[51:12.320 --> 51:14.320]  bin Laden this is his MO

[51:22.320 --> 51:26.320]  networks inside the United States some US investigators believe that there are
[51:26.320 --> 51:31.320]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[51:31.320 --> 51:35.320]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[51:35.320 --> 51:39.320]  and Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI
[51:39.320 --> 51:42.320]  the Saudi Arabian connection the Israeli intelligence network

[54:31.320 --> 54:33.320]  what are these super weapons?
[54:33.320 --> 54:40.320]  what is this program as big as the Manhattan Project?
[54:40.320 --> 54:46.320]  they used to win the war in Iraq
[54:46.320 --> 54:52.320]  it was called thousand dollar bills on big pallets
[54:52.320 --> 54:55.320]  it was called contriving the civil war from the beginnings
[54:55.320 --> 54:56.320]  you can turn it off
[54:56.320 --> 55:00.320]  but they want to advertise their gadgets and seduce more people into
[55:00.320 --> 55:01.320]  getting behind the war
[55:01.320 --> 55:04.320]  it's a little mind trick
[55:04.320 --> 55:06.320]  now they say they never went to Iraq for WMDs
[55:06.320 --> 55:08.320]  they went to bring democracy
[55:08.320 --> 55:10.320]  Iraqis say get out
[55:10.320 --> 55:12.320]  they say we came there so they could say get out
[55:12.320 --> 55:17.320]  lie after lie after lie
[55:17.320 --> 55:19.320]  then the UN can come in later
[55:19.320 --> 55:22.320]  as their savior as they're now preparing for I-4
[55:22.320 --> 55:23.320]  and the rest of them to come in
[55:23.320 --> 55:29.320]  as Bush announces 15,000 US troops pull back
[55:29.320 --> 55:31.320]  build down
[55:31.320 --> 55:33.320]  the military now can tell the truth about nothing
[55:33.320 --> 55:35.320]  so it's a build down
[55:35.320 --> 55:37.320]  I'm sorry, a build down
[55:37.320 --> 55:39.320]  just everything is doublespeak
[55:39.320 --> 55:41.320]  as soon as Budweiser isn't brewed in the US
[55:41.320 --> 55:44.320]  they call it American ale on all the bottles
[55:44.320 --> 55:47.320]  it's just real simple but just everywhere
[55:47.320 --> 55:50.320]  it's just total deception
[55:50.320 --> 55:54.320]  now why do they want to convert the Air Force over almost entirely
[55:54.320 --> 55:57.320]  unless you're talking about troop transport
[55:57.320 --> 56:00.320]  to robotically controlled and robotically programmed
[56:00.320 --> 56:02.320]  where humans aren't even piloting it
[56:02.320 --> 56:06.320]  from remote locations from the ground
[56:06.320 --> 56:08.320]  why do they want ground fighting robots
[56:08.320 --> 56:11.320]  ground remote controlled tanks
[56:11.320 --> 56:13.320]  why are they deploying these
[56:13.320 --> 56:15.320]  why are they testing them in the laboratory
[56:15.320 --> 56:18.320]  that's Iraq and Afghanistan
[56:18.320 --> 56:22.320]  because they don't want to have to worry about soldiers
[56:22.320 --> 56:24.320]  they don't want to have to have a draft
[56:24.320 --> 56:25.320]  the military says this
[56:25.320 --> 56:27.320]  they're just going to get rid of soldiers
[56:27.320 --> 56:29.320]  and soldiers will be technicians
[56:29.320 --> 56:32.320]  in the rear with the gear
[56:32.320 --> 56:36.320]  who are just maintaining the
[56:36.320 --> 56:38.320]  robotic forces
[56:38.320 --> 56:42.320]  and yes it's 2008 folks
[56:42.320 --> 56:44.320]  this is all happening right now
[56:44.320 --> 56:47.320]  the new fighter aircraft orders
[56:47.320 --> 56:50.320]  more than half of them already are pilotless
[56:50.320 --> 56:52.320]  drones
[56:52.320 --> 56:54.320]  the reaper
[56:54.320 --> 56:56.320]  the predator
[56:56.320 --> 56:59.320]  see that takes the human decision out of the equation
[56:59.320 --> 57:02.320]  it allows the elites to master program things
[57:02.320 --> 57:06.320]  and allows very small tiny groups to have control
[57:06.320 --> 57:09.320]  it also allows in the future
[57:09.320 --> 57:14.320]  artificially intelligent or malfunctioning computer systems
[57:14.320 --> 57:16.320]  to attack themselves
[57:16.320 --> 57:18.320]  and the elite is fully aware of this
[57:18.320 --> 57:20.320]  the elite could also launch an attack
[57:20.320 --> 57:22.320]  and then blame it on the computers
[57:22.320 --> 57:25.320]  or claim terrorists hacked in
[57:25.320 --> 57:27.320]  to the computers and did it themselves
[57:27.320 --> 57:33.320]  there's endless mischief that this will bring
[57:33.320 --> 57:35.320]  so what are the secret weapons?
[57:35.320 --> 57:38.320]  smart dust and nanotechnology
[57:38.320 --> 57:40.320]  robo rats
[57:40.320 --> 57:42.320]  particle beams
[57:42.320 --> 57:45.320]  radiation beams
[57:45.320 --> 57:47.320]  C-130s with radiation cannons
[57:47.320 --> 57:49.320]  radiation guns
[57:49.320 --> 57:52.320]  see-through wall technology
[57:52.320 --> 57:54.320]  infrared
[57:54.320 --> 57:56.320]  ground penetrating radar sonar
[57:56.320 --> 57:58.320]  things if they're put in airports to scan your naked body
[57:58.320 --> 58:00.320]  and record you
[58:00.320 --> 58:02.320]  remember, North coms over the US now
[58:02.320 --> 58:04.320]  and congress has been told
[58:04.320 --> 58:07.320]  they're under a state of emergency since 9-11
[58:07.320 --> 58:09.320]  COG is in place
[58:09.320 --> 58:11.320]  and they can't even see
[58:11.320 --> 58:13.320]  TDD-51
[58:16.320 --> 58:18.320]  you understand how this works?
[58:18.320 --> 58:20.320]  you got a bunch of fat ass generals
[58:20.320 --> 58:22.320]  sitting up there smoking their cigars
[58:22.320 --> 58:24.320]  going to the watergate every night
[58:24.320 --> 58:26.320]  banging your daughters
[58:26.320 --> 58:28.320]  excuse my French folks
[58:28.320 --> 58:30.320]  I'm using your daughters up
[58:30.320 --> 58:32.320]  huge whorehouses everywhere
[58:32.320 --> 58:34.320]  and they're just little low level puppets
[58:34.320 --> 58:36.320]  with the bankers and the technocratic scientists
[58:36.320 --> 58:38.320]  the eggheads on top running at all
[58:38.320 --> 58:40.320]  we'll be right back, stay with us

[58:55.320 --> 58:58.320]  9-11 was an inside job
[58:58.320 --> 59:00.320]  do you like being a puppet sir?
[59:00.320 --> 59:02.320]  do you like being a puppet for the new world order?
[59:02.320 --> 59:04.320]  how do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[59:04.320 --> 59:06.320]  was it engineered by you?
[59:06.320 --> 59:08.320]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission
[59:08.320 --> 59:10.320]  the CIFR
[59:10.320 --> 59:12.320]  today that we stop asking questions
[59:12.320 --> 59:14.320]  is the day that we have allowed
[59:14.320 --> 59:17.320]  the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door
[59:17.320 --> 59:20.320]  seven years after the attacks of September 11
[59:20.320 --> 59:23.320]  a global awakening has taken place
[59:23.320 --> 59:25.320]  an inside job
[59:25.320 --> 59:27.320]  how dare you?
[59:30.320 --> 59:32.320]  if you know that there's treason going on
[59:32.320 --> 59:34.320]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself

[59:54.320 --> 59:56.320]  waging war on corruption
[59:56.320 --> 59:59.320]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:06.320]  big brother
[1:00:06.320 --> 1:00:08.320]  mainstream media
[1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:10.320]  government cover-ups
[1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:12.320]  you want answers?
[1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:13.320]  well so does he

[1:00:17.320 --> 1:00:20.320]  and now live from Austin, Texas
[1:00:20.320 --> 1:00:22.320]  Alex Jones
[1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:26.320]  okay every few weeks we have an on topic call in
[1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:29.320]  that means we do screen your calls
[1:00:29.320 --> 1:00:32.320]  only to find out that you're on topic
[1:00:32.320 --> 1:00:34.320]  you can agree, you can disagree
[1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:36.320]  your first amendment is there
[1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:38.320]  just control yourself and don't use
[1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:40.320]  non-kings english
[1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:43.320]  we got Bob Woodward the government spook
[1:00:43.320 --> 1:00:45.320]  running around
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:48.320]  posing as a trendy liberal
[1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:50.320]  telling us that the war is basically wonderful
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:52.320]  and that the military won
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:55.320]  with super secret weapon development
[1:00:55.320 --> 1:00:57.320]  that is bigger than the Manhattan Project
[1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:59.320]  and is just wonderful
[1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:01.320]  they love to say that
[1:01:01.320 --> 1:01:03.320]  there's a program bigger than the Manhattan Project
[1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:05.320]  quote to kill the web
[1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:07.320]  and force you on internet too
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:09.320]  that's what the Pentagon said about 6 months ago
[1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:11.320]  in MIT announced with pleasure
[1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:13.320]  because they are scared of us ladies and gentlemen
[1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:15.320]  they're scared we're reaching their technicians
[1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:17.320]  their people inside the system
[1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:20.320]  who compartmentalize nothing ever made sense to them
[1:01:20.320 --> 1:01:22.320]  they listen to this show everything makes sense
[1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:24.320]  we give you all the footnotes where it came from
[1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:26.320]  who said it then you find out
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:28.320]  it's all right in your face
[1:01:28.320 --> 1:01:30.320]  I'm somebody that stepped back from the elephant
[1:01:30.320 --> 1:01:32.320]  and went you know I was like
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:34.320]  it's got gray skin it's got hair it smells
[1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:36.320]  and I went on let me just step back from this
[1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:38.320]  whoa it's an elephant
[1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:41.320]  it's like the emperor's new clothes
[1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:43.320]  three-year-old steps forward and says
[1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:45.320]  the emperor's naked
[1:01:45.320 --> 1:01:47.320]  I don't claim
[1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:49.320]  even be the sharpest knife in the drawer
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:51.320]  where my elevator goes all the way to the top every day
[1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:53.320]  let's see people's elevators
[1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:55.320]  do quote go to the top
[1:01:55.320 --> 1:01:57.320]  what is sane versus insane
[1:01:57.320 --> 1:01:59.320]  sane means you believe vaccines are the law to take
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:01.320]  there's no law you got to take them but doesn't matter
[1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:03.320]  sane
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:05.320]  most Americans believe that
[1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:07.320]  their quote refund check is free money
[1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:09.320]  they've done polls
[1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:11.320]  some polls over 70%
[1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:13.320]  believe that's free money
[1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:15.320]  other polls show that over 70% believe
[1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:17.320]  federal aid
[1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:19.320]  for the states is free money
[1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:21.320]  that you didn't pay taxes for
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:23.320]  it is sane
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:25.320]  to believe that 9-11
[1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:27.320]  happened in 2003 they've had national polls
[1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:29.320]  most Americans believe 9-11
[1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:31.320]  happened in 2003
[1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:33.320]  don't go pull that up
[1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:35.320]  I think the headline was most Americans don't know what year 9-11 happened
[1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:37.320]  it's sane to believe
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:39.320]  sodium fluoride is good for you
[1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:41.320]  it is sane to believe
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:43.320]  that corn syrup is good for you
[1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:45.320]  it is sane to believe that aspartame is good for you
[1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:47.320]  it's sane to believe cameras on street
[1:02:47.320 --> 1:02:49.320]  corners with wide open borders is sane
[1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:51.320]  it is sane
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:53.320]  to think being lied to is a good thing
[1:02:55.320 --> 1:02:57.320]  more to have without due process
[1:02:57.320 --> 1:02:59.320]  a million 400,000 children
[1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:01.320]  snatched every year
[1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:05.320]  so we are now going to take your call
[1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:07.320]  specifically what are these incredible new
[1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:09.320]  super weapons
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:11.320]  again they lure everyone in
[1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:13.320]  oh it's like MacGyver it's like James Bond
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:15.320]  oh I guess the war is so cool
[1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:17.320]  the government is invincible
[1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:19.320]  it's all about flaunting the power
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:21.320]  we rule you the technocracy
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:23.320]  has full spectrum domination
[1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:25.320]  James and Canada you're on the air
[1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:27.320]  yes hello Alex
[1:03:27.320 --> 1:03:29.320]  Alex you are royalty man
[1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:31.320]  worthiest of the most respect
[1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:33.320]  but I want to say that it's time that humanity
[1:03:33.320 --> 1:03:35.320]  concentrates on making a refuge
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:37.320]  from the captivity of the demonic
[1:03:37.320 --> 1:03:39.320]  cultures you know
[1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:41.320]  something like a system that would allow us
[1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:43.320]  to provide healing services
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:45.320]  and through voluntary service
[1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:47.320]  to procure faculties and residents
[1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:49.320]  for within like the Vatican
[1:03:49.320 --> 1:03:51.320]  where we could live within our own
[1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:53.320]  and be independent of the evil government
[1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:55.320]  what do you think of that
[1:03:55.320 --> 1:03:57.320]  I'm getting these calls today about the Vatican
[1:03:57.320 --> 1:03:59.320]  you're talking about people who hate the
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:01.320]  new world order who love liberty
[1:04:01.320 --> 1:04:03.320]  need to have our own organization
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:05.320]  or our own you know
[1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:07.320]  declare our own independent state
[1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:09.320]  yeah well here's the problem
[1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:11.320]  that is a top down
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:13.320]  structure pyramidal structure
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:15.320]  it's easy to cut the head off
[1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:17.320]  what's invincible is lone wolf resistance
[1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:19.320]  in the info or unlocking minds
[1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:21.320]  to where people at Colorado Springs
[1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:23.320]  Colorado figure out what they're part of
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:25.320]  or where people in the think tanks
[1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:27.320]  figure out what they're part of
[1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:29.320]  or where
[1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:31.320]  you know individuals involved in all of this
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:33.320]  you see that's how
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:35.320]  we're going to turn this around listen I appreciate your call
[1:04:35.320 --> 1:04:37.320]  and we're all royalty
[1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:39.320]  in God's eyes we're God's children
[1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:41.320]  you know part of his kingdom
[1:04:41.320 --> 1:04:43.320]  but the point is thank you James
[1:04:43.320 --> 1:04:45.320]  but that was not about
[1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:47.320]  what these secret weapons are
[1:04:47.320 --> 1:04:49.320]  I want it on topic or I'm going to basically cut
[1:04:49.320 --> 1:04:51.320]  you off folks and I know
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:53.320]  you see the problem is
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:55.320]  I know we know what it is
[1:04:55.320 --> 1:04:57.320]  there's just so many new secret weapons that have been
[1:04:57.320 --> 1:04:59.320]  brought forward that we don't know which one it is
[1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:01.320]  we'll be right back
[1:05:01.320 --> 1:05:03.320]  a day unlike any other
[1:05:03.320 --> 1:05:05.320]  in the long course of American history
[1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:07.320]  a terrorist act of war against this country
[1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:09.320]  the enemies struck America
[1:05:09.320 --> 1:05:11.320]  on September 11th
[1:05:11.320 --> 1:05:13.320]  but who is the enemy
[1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:15.320]  bin Laden this is his MO
[1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:17.320]  we have to look to the Middle East
[1:05:17.320 --> 1:05:19.320]  we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[1:05:19.320 --> 1:05:21.320]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:23.320]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:25.320]  inside the United States
[1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:27.320]  investigators believe that there are Israelis
[1:05:27.320 --> 1:05:29.320]  again very much engaged in spying
[1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:31.320]  in and on the US
[1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:33.320]  I'm aware that some Israeli
[1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:35.320]  citizens have been detained
[1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:37.320]  and Laden's connections to the CIA
[1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:39.320]  the hijackers ties to the FBI

[1:22:05.320 --> 1:22:10.320]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:16.320]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the US.
[1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:19.320]  Though the people of the US, where their numbers and influence are strongest,
[1:22:19.320 --> 1:22:26.320]  have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:31.320]  They are called Illuminati, elite, opponents of the new world order.
[1:22:31.320 --> 1:22:34.320]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:22:34.320 --> 1:22:37.320]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago,
[1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:41.320]  everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:22:41.320 --> 1:22:44.320]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:50.320]  the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[1:22:58.320 --> 1:23:00.320]  The message of his kingdom.
[1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:05.320]  We live in a world of vanishing privacy.
[1:23:05.320 --> 1:23:10.320]  The added threat of invisible radio waves sending out personal information to anyone willing to receive them
[1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:13.320]  makes our privacy a citizens even less secure.
[1:23:13.320 --> 1:23:16.320]  RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.
[1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:20.320]  Feeds are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.

[1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:17.320]  A government with corporate ownership.
[1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:26.320]  Operating in total secrecy since 1947. Can you imagine the entitleness, the arrogance, the corruption, what is bread?
[1:24:26.320 --> 1:24:34.320]  Imagine if you for 50-something years let your employees do whatever they wanted and gave them unlimited funds.
[1:24:34.320 --> 1:24:39.320]  I mean, you'd show up, none of them would be there. None of them, they'd be out fishing or whatever.
[1:24:39.320 --> 1:24:43.320]  Well, it's hundreds of times worse than that. They'd steal you blind.
[1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:49.320]  And that's what's happened and we've been taught to be a nation of thumb-sucking, pathetic cattle that by any lie were fed.
[1:24:49.320 --> 1:24:56.320]  It's time to stop that because it's getting too dangerous because these people are eugenicists and they want to kill the majority of us.
[1:24:56.320 --> 1:25:00.320]  That's what always happens in history. It's happening again, but this time they can really do it.
[1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:07.320]  Let's see the next callers on topic. What is the government's super weapon that they're saying they're using in Iraq?
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:09.320]  Ted in Los Angeles.
[1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:14.320]  Alex, how are you doing, buddy? Look, I'm not with the military, but I've been trying to talk to you for a couple of weeks about super weapons.
[1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:21.320]  It's very similar. Look, I live in LA, I live on a hill, and for the last year and a half since I woke up, you help me wake up.
[1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:26.320]  I've noticed a heavy Kim spring. I mean, it's ridiculous. And now out of the blue, it stopped.
[1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:30.320]  They spent hundreds of millions of dollars to do that. Why did they stop?
[1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:37.320]  Does that make a city a target for a potential neutron bomb when they stopped spending hundreds of millions of dollars to Kim spray?
[1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:45.320]  Well, when I said neutron bombs, sir, those are used if the Congress or the people ever try to set the United States up again.
[1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:51.320]  I mean, it's been going for a long time. That's a decapitation weapon. That's why I'm saying we can't just go take the Capitol over.
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:59.320]  We have to peacefully educate people about the shadow government, stop complying with everything to then have a real debate with the elite.
[1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:09.320]  But if we don't admit with a real atmosphere and what we're really dealing with and our enemies' real philosophy, then we never have any chance of defeating it, as long as we are perpetually children.
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:17.320]  What would be the motivation to stop Kim spring out of nowhere? Just stop it when they spend so much money to initiate the process and just to quit?
[1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:19.320]  I'm very curious about that.
[1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:22.320]  Well, most of that is classified. Or was that a question?
[1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:24.320]  Yeah, that was a question. Go ahead.
[1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:28.320]  Well, number one, I appreciate your call. It isn't really exactly on topic.
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:38.320]  I don't think we've ever had a caller on topic. I mean, I'm asking the listeners. I know we have a lot of military people, former military people listening.
[1:26:38.320 --> 1:26:43.320]  And they're admitting that it's no secret to the troops, no secret to the foreigners.
[1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:55.320]  And so, I mean, I know it's microwave guns, radiation guns. They have got, they've been caught using microwave weapons in Fallujah.
[1:26:55.320 --> 1:27:00.320]  Nerve gas. But that's not some new super technology, nerve gas.
[1:27:00.320 --> 1:27:07.320]  Does particle beams fit into some new super weapon? Bigger than the, or as big as the Manhattan Project?
[1:27:07.320 --> 1:27:12.320]  Your question was, why would they stop Kim trailing your area? The answer is it's a secret program. We don't know, sir.
[1:27:12.320 --> 1:27:21.320]  They just admit that there is a large Department of Energy program since the mid-90s when the ice trails stopped lasting a minute and started lasting five hours.
[1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:26.320]  Because they're not ice trails anymore, when the planes were spraying. They admit they're spraying for weather modification.
[1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:31.320]  That's only one part of the program. I don't know. Okay, I don't know why that stopped in your area.
[1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:36.320]  I don't have a crystal ball. Rick in California, go ahead. Go ahead.
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:37.320]  Hello.
[1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:38.320]  Go ahead.
[1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:46.320]  Yeah, I appreciate you taking my call, man. I wanted to thank you for waking me up. I'm recent slumber.
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:59.320]  I was actually researching this when I stumbled on your website and researched the 9-11 thing to theorize that these new weapons were used to bring down the towers.
[1:27:59.320 --> 1:28:08.320]  I believe that they're the directed energy weapons only 10 times stronger than what we're seeing with a microwave weapon.
[1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:16.320]  Well, I mean, we know that they're showing us 1960s technology, these particle beams that shoot down rockets, shoot down missiles.
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:24.320]  And yes, they've got all sorts of new beams, new rays. We know that. And they're certainly using them. We know they used them in Desert Storm 1.
[1:28:24.320 --> 1:28:31.320]  I mean, there would be people where the jeep wasn't burned. Everybody's laying there like disintegrated from attack from Mars or something.
[1:28:31.320 --> 1:28:45.320]  Well, right. But there's a gentleman, a former Army colonel who's got a website that talks about some of his, he's a physicist that's been in the alternative energy field.
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:51.320]  His name is Tom Bearden. And he talks a little bit about some of the technologies that they've developed from that base.
[1:28:51.320 --> 1:28:56.320]  You know, he gets into weather weapons. I interviewed him like 10 years ago. I need to get Bearden back on.
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:29:09.320]  If you look in his site though, he does talk about them using that same negative energy technology from space as a weapon.
[1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:15.320]  And it seems that there is some evidence from photographs in Iraq that they're using a smaller version of that right now.
[1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:21.320]  Well, if they're getting ready to announce it, we know they're using radiation guns is what they are.
[1:29:21.320 --> 1:29:30.320]  We know they're using radiation guns and it's a laboratory. You know, the Iraqis are slated for extermination and that's what's going on.
[1:29:30.320 --> 1:29:34.320]  I appreciate your call. So will it be directed energy weapons?
[1:29:34.320 --> 1:29:50.320]  I mean, we know they have particle beams, lasers, things like that, but compared to these cyclotrons that then add it to a light beam, it's powerful stuff.
[1:29:50.320 --> 1:30:01.320]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.320 --> 1:30:08.320]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:30:08.320 --> 1:30:12.320]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:14.320]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:17.320]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:30:17.320 --> 1:30:24.320]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:31.320]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:30:31.320 --> 1:30:35.320]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:30:35.320 --> 1:30:42.320]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli Intelligence Network,
[1:30:42.320 --> 1:30:49.320]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com

[1:30:54.320 --> 1:31:02.320]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:31:02.320 --> 1:31:09.320]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking. When it comes to this economy, the banks are crashing, the stock market's a mess.
[1:31:09.320 --> 1:31:17.320]  There's the mortgage crisis. There's the lending crisis. There's the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[1:31:17.320 --> 1:31:22.320]  And we are paralyzed a little bit. We don't know exactly how to respond to it. I don't know what to say. What can you do?
[1:31:22.320 --> 1:31:27.320]  Do what you can do. That's what you do. You do what you can do. What I can do is I can put some food away.

[1:31:37.320 --> 1:31:40.320]  Look at the prices. Look where they're headed. Be prepared. Take care of yourself.
[1:31:40.320 --> 1:31:46.320]  You owe your family some security, some sense of self-being. A little bit of self-reliance is a good idea right now.

[1:32:00.320 --> 1:32:10.320]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:32:10.320 --> 1:32:18.320]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:32:18.320 --> 1:32:24.320]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:28.320]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:32:28.320 --> 1:32:33.320]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[1:32:33.320 --> 1:32:35.320]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:32:35.320 --> 1:32:43.320]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:33:01.320 --> 1:33:29.320]  I want to hear from the military. We've seen these antenna arrays on the backs of armored vehicles mounted on roofs that look like microwave-based weapons.
[1:33:29.320 --> 1:33:33.320]  The answer here, let me just finish up.
[1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:39.320]  I'm going to go back to your calls in a moment, but I want to just recap what we're talking about for listeners that just joined us.
[1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:45.320]  Secret killing program is key in Iraq, a woodward sense.
[1:33:45.320 --> 1:33:52.320]  The dramatic drop in violence in Iraq is due in large part to a secret program the U.S. military has used to kill terrorists.
[1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:56.320]  Not getting anybody that resists them, anybody that doesn't want millions of Iraqis to die as a terrorist.
[1:33:56.320 --> 1:34:00.320]  According to a new book by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Bob Woodward,
[1:34:00.320 --> 1:34:07.320]  the program which Woodward compares to the World War II, the development of the atomic bomb must remain secret for now,
[1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:12.320]  or would get people killed, Woodward said on Larry King's Line.
[1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:18.320]  It is a wonderful example of American ingenuity, solving a problem in war, as we often have, Woodward said.
[1:34:18.320 --> 1:34:27.320]  Now it goes on down here to say, though, that the insurgents all know what it is and that it's not really a secret.
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:37.320]  Well, the space planes with the Sabo DU rounds that can drop in the gravity well, particle beams, microwave guns,
[1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:43.320]  basically directed energy weapons is the overall name.
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:50.320]  They've got ground penetrating radar to look through your walls. Woodward told Larry King that while there is debate over how much credit
[1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:56.320]  the new secret operation should get for the drop in violence, he concluded it accounts for a good portion.
[1:34:56.320 --> 1:34:59.320]  I would somewhat compare it to the Manhattan Project in World War II.
[1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:05.320]  He said it's a ski slope right down in a matter of months, cutting the violence in half.
[1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:11.320]  This isn't going to happen with a bunch of joint security stations or the surge.
[1:35:11.320 --> 1:35:18.320]  So the big lie here is the main reason was they disbanded the military, disbanded the police, had it break down,
[1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:24.320]  had special forces, stage terror attacks, blow up mosques, get different sides killing each other using their religious fervor
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:28.320]  and the mindlessness of it all to fight with each other.
[1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:34.320]  And then they stopped doing that when the surge started and then openly started paying everybody off not to kill each other.
[1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:43.320]  That's why they've got White House officials and people in the Army saying,
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:48.320]  well, no, there's a secret program and it's part of it, but the biggest thing is the surge and they mean the payoff.
[1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:54.320]  While he would not reveal the details, Woodward said the terrorists who have been targeted were already aware of the capabilities.
[1:35:54.320 --> 1:36:00.320]  The enemy has a heads up because they've been getting wiped out.
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:04.320]  A lot of them have been killed, he said. It's not news to them.
[1:36:04.320 --> 1:36:10.320]  If you were a member of Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda, CIA, or the resistance, see now we're talking about real people,
[1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:15.320]  or the resistance or some extremist militia, people that don't want to be slaves,
[1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:20.320]  you would be wise to get your rear end out of town, Woodward said.
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:25.320]  It is very dangerous.
[1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:31.320]  Now they can just fly over with a C-130 with microwaves and fry everybody in the whole town.
[1:36:31.320 --> 1:36:33.320]  And that's what they did.
[1:36:33.320 --> 1:36:37.320]  The blood starts running out your eyes, you just cook right there, it's so sick.
[1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:43.320]  And all the good old boys are good, murdered all of them, kill.
[1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:46.320]  Don't worry, they're going to kill your dollar, your bank account, your future.
[1:36:46.320 --> 1:36:49.320]  They're going to pump you full of deadly soft kill too, punk.
[1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:55.320]  You think you're part of the system, you're not.
[1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:59.320]  So that's why they're so arrogant, that's why they're launching sneak attacks on the Russians.
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:04.320]  That's why they don't care if you know all this stuff now, it's just like hey,
[1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:10.320]  we can decapitate every world leader in five minutes with the space planes in orbit
[1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:15.320]  with their meteor guns firing D.U.
[1:37:15.320 --> 1:37:21.320]  We got bioplegs, a clever person on earth, we got neutron bombs ready to take out every government, including ours.
[1:37:21.320 --> 1:37:25.320]  Sit down, shut up and roll your sleeve up.
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:32.320]  But they're going to have to physically come in and make us roll our sleeves up and take the shots.
[1:37:32.320 --> 1:37:38.320]  They're going to have to get us to acquiesce and pay them taxes and fund them and go along with all of it.
[1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:42.320]  And they're going to have to make sure we can't reach out to the minds of the military and police
[1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:46.320]  and show them what's going on.
[1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:49.320]  I mean, they may have full spectrum dominance and have all these secret weapons,
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:51.320]  but people don't believe anything they say now.
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:58.320]  You got maybe 10% of the population that will still buy their crap.
[1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:02.320]  And that's why they're giving you a woman and a black guy to try to suck you back into the process
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:04.320]  to believe the puppets actually run something.
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:07.320]  All right, I'm going to plug sponsors and I'm going back to your calls.
[1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:16.320]  I want to move quick. I want to hear specifically at 1-800-25-99231 what you think or know the super weapons are.
[1:38:16.320 --> 1:38:19.320]  Or if you don't want to call in, if you've been in the military and tell us what it is,
[1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:21.320]  of course, they're not even telling you it's a super weapon.
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:25.320]  They're just telling you it's part of a larger package of high-tech weapons.
[1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:30.320]  I mean, hell, they were using some type of direct energy weapon in Panama.
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:31.320]  That's admitted.
[1:38:31.320 --> 1:38:36.320]  I mean, you can just point me in the direction of a movie, point me in the direction of something that's been admitted.
[1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:44.320]  They got drones that fly around face scanning people and killing them.
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:46.320]  That's been declassified.
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:48.320]  Most of this has been declassified.
[1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:53.320]  You know, the CIA classifies thousands of news articles every year as classified.
[1:38:53.320 --> 1:38:56.320]  They take it, grab it, snip it out and put it in their files as classified.
[1:38:56.320 --> 1:38:57.320]  It's ridiculous.
[1:38:57.320 --> 1:39:00.320]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors that we're going to hear calls.
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:06.320]  E-Foods Direct, folks, is our biggest sponsor next to minus resources.
[1:39:06.320 --> 1:39:08.320]  And they're just great people.
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:13.320]  With all the uncertainty, the talk of war with Russia, the talk of war with Iran, the economy,
[1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:18.320]  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, going into government receivership in the Ponzi scheme.
[1:39:18.320 --> 1:39:23.320]  With all the things that are happening, it's smart to have a year supply of food for everybody in your family.
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:25.320]  It's very affordable, very inexpensive.
[1:39:25.320 --> 1:39:28.320]  They've got month supplies, two month supplies, boogie pack supplies.
[1:39:28.320 --> 1:39:33.320]  Really is high quality, dehydrated and freeze dried food.
[1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:34.320]  Great, folks.

[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:47.320]  Don't end up like the Superdome people having to go turn their guns in, you know, to go in and get raped ganged.
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:49.320]  That was they thought they were going to get food.
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:50.320]  And of course they did.
[1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:52.320]  And it was all laboratory tests to see what would happen.
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:57.320]  800-409-5633-800409-5633.
[1:39:57.320 --> 1:39:59.320]  E-FoodsDirect.com.
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:04.320]  Again, big banners up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:06.320]  You'll never have to stand in the bread line if you have your own bread.
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:10.320]  That is their motto.
[1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:13.320]  And another one of our fine sponsors is a cola blue.
[1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:14.320]  A cola blue.
[1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:16.320]  They just got more of their unit in by the way.
[1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:18.320]  They sold out because of the show.
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:22.320]  It's a great system, atmospheric water generator for the home.
[1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:27.320]  Pace for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:31.320]  Pure clean water without the fluoride unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[1:40:31.320 --> 1:40:33.320]  They've got more machines in folks.
[1:40:33.320 --> 1:40:36.320]  Machine produces up to 28 liters or 7.5 gallons a day.
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:39.320]  About half that in the desert even more in some areas.
[1:40:39.320 --> 1:40:42.320]  Low operating cost on average 12 cents a gallon.
[1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:43.320]  Pace for itself.
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:44.320]  Great tasting pure H2O.
[1:40:44.320 --> 1:40:46.320]  Exactly the way nature makes it.
[1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:48.320]  No chemicals, pollutants or toxins.
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:49.320]  Natural pH.
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:52.320]  866-585-4044.
[1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:55.320]  866-585-4044.

[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:12.320]  Forget the website.
[1:41:12.320 --> 1:41:15.320]  Okay.
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:18.320]  Who's up next here?
[1:41:18.320 --> 1:41:21.320]  Ray, Peter, John, Ed, and others.
[1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:25.320]  Okay, Ray, are you the first caller that's actually fully on topic?
[1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:29.320]  Oh, God.
[1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:31.320]  Ray, are you there?
[1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:32.320]  Hey, Alex.
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:33.320]  Yes, go ahead.
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:34.320]  Hey, what's up, man?
[1:41:34.320 --> 1:41:36.320]  I'm right here in Austin, man.
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:37.320]  Thanks.
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:38.320]  I appreciate everything you do.
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:40.320]  You know, I've seen all your films or most of them.
[1:41:40.320 --> 1:41:41.320]  Thank you.
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:44.320]  What really turned me on was the Waco one.
[1:41:44.320 --> 1:41:47.320]  I had always questioned the official story and all that stuff.
[1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:48.320]  Thanks, man.
[1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:50.320]  You know, I am on topic.
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:55.320]  I wonder if it had anything to do with the fact that, you know, no one saw Sarah Palin coming,
[1:41:55.320 --> 1:42:04.320]  and maybe it had been pre-promised to her in exchange for her looking the other way about the heart projects that are going on in Alaska.
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:06.320]  Well, I mean, a governor runs nothing.
[1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:08.320]  I mean, they have true power, but they don't know it.
[1:42:08.320 --> 1:42:09.320]  They're totally federalized.
[1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:12.320]  The Congress has been told they can't even be involved in government now.
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:20.320]  Northcom fully rules the U.S. The United States has been listed as an enemy population for eugenics extermination, just like the Iraqis.
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:22.320]  Literally, folks, it's not a joke.
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:25.320]  Yes, reality's hardcore, isn't it?
[1:42:25.320 --> 1:42:29.320]  So I don't know really what to say about Sarah Palin.
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:37.320]  I'm saying because, you know, I don't know what you know about it, but I read in the Matt Lauer interview, and I have him quoted.
[1:42:37.320 --> 1:42:44.320]  He said, a breakout in technology and covert tactics to seek out and kill insurgent leaders.
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:49.320]  And Bob Woodward keeps saying this, you know, I've seen him in two interviews now, and he keeps saying the same thing.
[1:42:49.320 --> 1:42:57.320]  He mentioned the Manhattan Project, and then he says, all of a sudden, by surprise, one morning, it just, it was tasteful.
[1:42:57.320 --> 1:43:00.320]  You know, that's pretty scary stuff, man.
[1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:05.320]  You know, they mean to shock Russia, shock the world as they get ready to start World War III.
[1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:06.320]  I appreciate your call.
[1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:07.320]  I don't mean that.
[1:43:07.320 --> 1:43:12.320]  I mean, what did I say to Dr. Roberts last week when he was on with us?
[1:43:12.320 --> 1:43:17.320]  And by the way, he's coming up in a few minutes.
[1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:27.320]  I said they're doing this unless they're completely megalomaniacs and just completely crazy, you know, counting flowers on the wall.
[1:43:27.320 --> 1:43:29.320]  That don't bother me at all.
[1:43:29.320 --> 1:43:33.320]  Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo.
[1:43:33.320 --> 1:43:44.320]  I mean, unless they're just dressing up like Easter bunnies and hopping around the front yard while drinking antifreeze, they've got super weapons.
[1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:48.320]  We know they have the super weapons.
[1:43:48.320 --> 1:43:51.320]  They used our money, and now they've turned them against us.
[1:43:51.320 --> 1:43:53.320]  And you got all these prideful people.
[1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:55.320]  I'm proud of the USA.
[1:43:55.320 --> 1:43:58.320]  Hell, yeah, we got some bad stuff.
[1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:01.320]  Oh, God.
[1:44:01.320 --> 1:44:04.320]  So we're, again, for listeners tuning in.
[1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:09.320]  Yes, CNN, CBS, some incredible new technology.
[1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:11.320]  Folks, they've got so many new technologies.
[1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:12.320]  It's insane.
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:19.320]  You can see them getting ready for all these big announcements and the Pope saying aliens are real and are basically about to land and astronauts.
[1:44:19.320 --> 1:44:22.320]  And it's just more hoaxes, more scams.
[1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:31.320]  And they want to roll out some, you know, big microwave, laser, radiation gun and scare the hell out of everybody.
[1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:36.320]  And by the way, they've already given cops ground-penetrating radar.
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:38.320]  They already looked through your walls.
[1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:42.320]  They already have ground-penetrating radar when you walk through the airport, scanning your neck and body.
[1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:44.320]  I mean, a lot of this stuff's already out there.
[1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:46.320]  So we'll see what it is.
[1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:49.320]  It's probably just microwave guns.
[1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:51.320]  Well, it's a gun, and we know they got those.
[1:44:51.320 --> 1:44:54.320]  Hell, they use them on protesters, but turned down on low.
[1:44:54.320 --> 1:44:59.320]  Let's go ahead and talk to Peter in New York.
[1:44:59.320 --> 1:45:00.320]  Go ahead, Peter.
[1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:01.320]  Hi, Alex.
[1:45:01.320 --> 1:45:05.320]  One of the other callers mentioned Tom Bearden.
[1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:13.320]  It reminded me of an article, because I haven't been to his website in a few years, but I'm pretty sure I remember an article on his website.
[1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:17.320]  You might want to bring this up with him if you do get him on.
[1:45:17.320 --> 1:45:24.320]  How about technology allowing them to transmit viruses through radio frequencies?
[1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:25.320]  Oh, that's well.
[1:45:25.320 --> 1:45:30.320]  Well, actually, there's dormant viruses that have embedded when your immune system beats them.
[1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:33.320]  There's still shells of the viruses all throughout your body.
[1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:37.320]  And basically, they can go in with certain frequencies and turn them all on.
[1:45:37.320 --> 1:45:39.320]  Nice.
[1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:40.320]  Yeah.
[1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:43.320]  Yeah, to be specific, they're not transmitting viruses through the air.
[1:45:43.320 --> 1:45:45.320]  They are activating viruses.
[1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:48.320]  Well, it's been a few years since I read it.
[1:45:48.320 --> 1:45:51.320]  I wasn't sure if that was the case or not.
[1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:53.320]  Boy, that's deadly dangerous.
[1:45:53.320 --> 1:45:55.320]  Yeah, it's Buck Rogers, man.
[1:45:55.320 --> 1:45:56.320]  It's 2008.
[1:45:56.320 --> 1:45:58.320]  We got psychopathic eugenicist in control.
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:00.320]  I appreciate your input there, Peter.
[1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:04.320]  John and Michigan, you're on the air.
[1:46:04.320 --> 1:46:05.320]  Alex.
[1:46:05.320 --> 1:46:06.320]  Yes, sir.
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:07.320]  Alex.
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:08.320]  Alex.
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:09.320]  I can only...
[1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:10.320]  You don't hear me?
[1:46:10.320 --> 1:46:11.320]  Only I hear you.
[1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:14.320]  I was on a cell phone speaker.
[1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:15.320]  That's okay.
[1:46:15.320 --> 1:46:16.320]  Go ahead.
[1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:17.320]  I've read Tom Burton's same information.
[1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:19.320]  I listened to him last night.
[1:46:19.320 --> 1:46:24.320]  He was talking about the super rock that could go around the world.
[1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:25.320]  You're going to have to let you go.
[1:46:25.320 --> 1:46:26.320]  Your phone's bad.
[1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:28.320]  Call me back if you can get it working, John.
[1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:32.320]  Ed and Utah, you're on the air.
[1:46:32.320 --> 1:46:33.320]  Hey, Alex.
[1:46:33.320 --> 1:46:34.320]  Thanks for everything.
[1:46:34.320 --> 1:46:35.320]  Thank you.
[1:46:35.320 --> 1:46:39.320]  We're planting the stakes of patriotism really deep here in Utah.
[1:46:39.320 --> 1:46:42.320]  Thanks to you and lots of other good people.
[1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:43.320]  Thank you.
[1:46:43.320 --> 1:46:44.320]  I just wanted to say HARP.
[1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:50.320]  I was going to conjecture that it's the HARP technology that they're using for the super
[1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:51.320]  weapon.
[1:46:51.320 --> 1:46:58.320]  Yeah, not specifically from Alaska or the one they've got in Europe, but localized.
[1:46:58.320 --> 1:47:04.320]  Yeah, and when he says it's time for everybody to get out of town, like you said earlier,
[1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:10.320]  they can blanket the whole area with this HARP technology very easily.
[1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:14.320]  And you can tell they've done it because there's rings in the sky.
[1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:15.320]  Exactly.
[1:47:15.320 --> 1:47:21.320]  And in their spraying, because it's somehow involved in the residents, they can do weather
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:22.320]  control, mind control.
[1:47:22.320 --> 1:47:27.320]  And by the way, that's major government, white papers, research institutes going back 30,
[1:47:27.320 --> 1:47:28.320]  40 years.
[1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:30.320]  And that's even the Baltimore Sun and Mitch.
[1:47:30.320 --> 1:47:35.320]  DARPA has put up towers in our cities and is practicing different residences to manipulate
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:36.320]  our brains.
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:37.320]  I mean, it's real, folks.
[1:47:37.320 --> 1:47:39.320]  These people are out of control.
[1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:40.320]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:43.320]  That's why it's so funny to them.
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:44.320]  Yep.
[1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:45.320]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:47:45.320 --> 1:47:46.320]  God bless you.
[1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:47.320]  Thank you, sir.
[1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:48.320]  I appreciate your call.
[1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:53.820]  Listen, the $64 million question, I'm going to leave the phones open all day for this,
[1:47:53.820 --> 1:47:54.820]  is military people.
[1:47:54.820 --> 1:47:58.320]  It is not secret that you've got microwave weapons.
[1:47:58.320 --> 1:48:03.820]  It is not secret that they've got aircraft with different directed energy weapons, chemical
[1:48:03.820 --> 1:48:06.320]  lasers, particle beams is what's declassified.
[1:48:06.320 --> 1:48:08.320]  You know, that's been out for 20 years.
[1:48:08.320 --> 1:48:18.320]  It's not secret that they've got robotic spaceplanes, weapons platforms that have meteor guns.
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:23.320]  They're called a meteor gun because that's why meteor speeds up so fast, but it's DU fired.
[1:48:23.320 --> 1:48:25.320]  It comes in at 30,000 miles an hour.
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:27.320]  It's a decapitation weapon.
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:33.320]  We know they've got the see-through walls technologies, both sonar, radar, it's the same technology.
[1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:35.320]  We know they've got all that.
[1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:38.320]  We've had that for decades, and again, there's my psychology.
[1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:39.320]  We, we, I'm an American.
[1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:40.320]  It's my government.
[1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:41.320]  It's my military.
[1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:42.320]  It's not.
[1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:44.320]  This cancer that hijacked us.
[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:46.320]  Look, the country's dying of cancer.
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:47.320]  The world's dying of cancer.
[1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:48.320]  That's basically what it is.
[1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:50.320]  These people are cancer.
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:53.320]  Totally sick killers, and they enjoy their power.
[1:48:53.320 --> 1:48:54.320]  They're going to use it.
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:58.320]  And all we can do is wake everybody up to it until everybody's in awe and not going along
[1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:02.160]  with it anymore and just openly rebuking it and saying, we don't care if you keep lying.
[1:49:02.160 --> 1:49:03.160]  We know what you're doing.
[1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:05.660]  The government's criminal, we're not going along with it.
[1:49:05.660 --> 1:49:11.160]  Week-long strikes, saying no to everything, just a mass awakening.
[1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:17.160]  All right, who's up next here?
[1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:20.160]  Chris and Tennessee, you're on the air.
[1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:21.160]  Hello, Alex.
[1:49:21.160 --> 1:49:29.160]  Alex, in our lifetime, about two years back, Direct TV came out with their satellite system.
[1:49:29.160 --> 1:49:33.800]  In the early models, they had a system which was called an H-card, and people figured
[1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:38.960]  out a way to make that card get TV without paying for it.
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:47.280]  So Direct TV got mad about it and sent waves through your system to blow your card up in
[1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:50.360]  that ship.
[1:49:50.360 --> 1:49:53.160]  I remember reading something about that, yeah.
[1:49:53.160 --> 1:49:54.160]  Yeah.
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:50:01.360]  The way it killed that system like that, and also, I've also heard about these systems
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:02.360]  now.
[1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:08.560]  Our Star Wars system, one of the key weapons is a large blimp that has lasers on the front
[1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:09.560]  of it.
[1:50:09.560 --> 1:50:10.560]  Suppose we shoot a missile.
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:11.560]  Yeah, that's admitted.
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:13.560]  They've already got those tethered over the U.S.
[1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:14.560]  Yes, sir.
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:17.960]  But the main thing is, instead of burning you, shooting you, they just radiate you and you
[1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:19.960]  die a few hours later, a day later.
[1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:20.960]  Correct.
[1:50:20.960 --> 1:50:26.560]  I think in the other Star Wars, in the next 20 years, the radiation for cell phones, but
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:30.760]  the fact of the matter is you can see some of these movies in Hollywood where they slide
[1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:37.080]  this device into somebody's car, and it kills the computer in a car, and kills the alternator,
[1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:38.080]  and then you're stuck.
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:42.360]  But the thing that really kind of interests me is some of these new space weapons where
[1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:47.800]  they can launch a bomb in our orbit, which our atmosphere is, I think, 120 miles above
[1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:48.800]  Earth.
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:53.600]  They can launch that and it will destroy your communications satellites and the other ones.
[1:50:53.600 --> 1:50:55.920]  Now, you're talking about a magnetic pulse weapon.
[1:50:55.920 --> 1:50:56.920]  Stay there.
[1:50:56.920 --> 1:50:57.920]  Stay there.
[1:50:57.920 --> 1:50:58.920]  I want to hear more.
[1:50:58.920 --> 1:51:01.760]  Stay with us.
[1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:06.680]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:12.560]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free, and can greatly benefit the health of the human
[1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:13.760]  body.

[1:51:21.400 --> 1:51:22.800]  food source.
[1:51:22.800 --> 1:51:28.680]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival
[1:51:28.680 --> 1:51:30.840]  and emergency food rations.

[1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:45.040]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future, and food will be your greatest asset.
[1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:50.920]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages
[1:51:50.920 --> 1:51:52.480]  in the future.
[1:51:52.480 --> 1:52:00.560]  So don't delay, call today, 908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do
[1:52:00.560 --> 1:52:02.040]  for you.
[1:52:02.040 --> 1:52:07.400]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[1:52:07.400 --> 1:52:11.200]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:16.480]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:18.040]  to tell their story.
[1:52:18.040 --> 1:52:27.080]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:52:27.080 --> 1:52:31.840]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[1:52:31.840 --> 1:52:34.080]  take action against their global masters.
[1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:37.080]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:43.120]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:46.600]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:52:46.600 --> 1:52:52.440]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order
[1:52:52.440 --> 1:52:55.080]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:52:55.080 --> 1:52:58.760]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:02.360]  and bring in martial law.
[1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:06.360]  How much longer will you ignore the warning signs?
[1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:07.680]  How much longer?
[1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:10.600]  How much longer will you turn away like a blind man?
[1:53:10.600 --> 1:53:11.600]  How much longer?
[1:53:11.600 --> 1:53:16.800]  A choice, a choice of life or death, abundance or starvation is made today.
[1:53:16.800 --> 1:53:19.840]  Do you have a long-term food solution?

[1:53:47.360 --> 1:53:48.360]  Patriots prepare.
[1:53:48.360 --> 1:53:49.360]  Slaves hesitate.
[1:53:49.360 --> 1:53:50.360]  Soon we'll soon.
[1:53:50.360 --> 1:53:52.360]  We'll know which one you are.

[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  The New World Order.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  Is it a bad, bad thing?
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  Maybe it's a bad, bad.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  Doesn't matter what super weapons they've got.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  Maybe it's a bad, bad thing.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  If we just stop believing in the truth, we'll know.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  We'll know.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  We'll know.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  We'll know.
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  We'll know.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  We'll know.
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  We'll know.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  We'll know.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  We'll know.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  We'll know.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  We'll know.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:30.600]  If we just stop believing in them, stop going along with them, stop funding them, let the
[1:54:30.600 --> 1:54:36.240]  establishment know that we're not buying into this anymore, it can all stop now.
[1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:41.180]  Now once their control grid gets more in place, and we're just talking maybe five years away,
[1:54:41.180 --> 1:54:47.280]  it's going to be tough going, folks, and just a lot of you won't listen now.
[1:54:47.280 --> 1:54:53.700]  You will listen then, but remember, you won't have a choice but the fight back then.
[1:54:53.700 --> 1:54:59.420]  And a lot of you are going to lose family through these soft-kill weapons and the bio
[1:54:59.420 --> 1:55:02.420]  and chemical weapon program that's going on through the water supply of the food and
[1:55:02.420 --> 1:55:08.100]  the air, which is documented, is admitted is much worse than even all their fancy space
[1:55:08.100 --> 1:55:10.180]  space weapons meant to terrorize and scare people.
[1:55:10.180 --> 1:55:11.820]  This is really just a disinfo hype.
[1:55:11.820 --> 1:55:17.420]  Yeah, they're testing laser guns and microwave guns and stuff they send through the wiring
[1:55:17.420 --> 1:55:18.580]  in your house to fry you.
[1:55:18.580 --> 1:55:19.580]  I've forgotten about that.
[1:55:19.580 --> 1:55:21.420]  I'm glad Chris brought it up.
[1:55:21.420 --> 1:55:22.420]  That's all admitted.
[1:55:22.420 --> 1:55:26.100]  And they've got the blimps tethered and the rest of it.
[1:55:26.100 --> 1:55:30.660]  And we've always talked about how they can radiate you or they can even put the pellets
[1:55:30.660 --> 1:55:31.660]  in your car.
[1:55:31.660 --> 1:55:32.660]  They've been caught doing that.
[1:55:32.660 --> 1:55:33.660]  They've got the fast-acting viruses.
[1:55:33.660 --> 1:55:37.060]  That's declassified back in the 60s.
[1:55:37.060 --> 1:55:38.060]  Cancer viruses.
[1:55:38.060 --> 1:55:40.540]  They put the slow-acting ones in your shots because they love you.
[1:55:40.540 --> 1:55:41.820]  The government's so good, folks.
[1:55:41.820 --> 1:55:42.820]  They're so loving.
[1:55:42.820 --> 1:55:47.700]  Now, Bayer is really nice, giving them million-plus ampoules of AIDS out, HIV.
[1:55:47.700 --> 1:55:48.700]  Uh-huh.
[1:55:48.700 --> 1:55:50.300]  Don't roll your eyes.
[1:55:50.300 --> 1:55:54.020]  I think they would sue me if that wasn't true, right?
[1:55:54.020 --> 1:55:55.020]  It's true.
[1:55:55.020 --> 1:55:57.660]  So, again, go check into it.
[1:55:57.660 --> 1:56:08.300]  But written calls and emails that Rush Limbaugh had Jason Lewis out of Minneapolis, St. Paul,
[1:56:08.300 --> 1:56:18.900]  I know him, on there talking about us taking over the Democratic Convention and attacking
[1:56:18.900 --> 1:56:19.900]  me or something.
[1:56:19.900 --> 1:56:21.780]  So, did somebody hear it?
[1:56:21.780 --> 1:56:24.180]  We're getting emails and calls about it.
[1:56:24.180 --> 1:56:25.180]  Okay.
[1:56:25.180 --> 1:56:30.500]  And then some smart-mouth response about, I don't know why it was Bullhorn and MSNBC.
[1:56:30.500 --> 1:56:31.500]  They're liberals.
[1:56:31.500 --> 1:56:33.060]  They all know it's an inside job.
[1:56:33.060 --> 1:56:41.940]  And here's the New York Times, 9-11 rumors that become conventional wisdom.
[1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:42.940]  And it just goes into that.
[1:56:42.940 --> 1:56:44.660]  Yeah, it is conventional wisdom.
[1:56:44.660 --> 1:56:47.260]  There's nothing you can do about it, okay?
[1:56:47.260 --> 1:56:51.540]  And it's going to become conventional wisdom that you put cancer viruses in the kid's shots
[1:56:51.540 --> 1:56:59.620]  and that you put mercury lead, arsenic, and every other known heavy metal in our water
[1:56:59.620 --> 1:57:03.100]  supply on purpose and call it fluoride, you murderers.
[1:57:03.100 --> 1:57:08.260]  You know, Dr. Monteef brought that up last week, and I'd forgotten because it's admitted
[1:57:08.260 --> 1:57:12.900]  that they take toxic waste and call it fluoride, you know, as if the fluoride isn't bad enough.
[1:57:12.900 --> 1:57:14.420]  Chris in Tennessee, finish up.
[1:57:14.420 --> 1:57:21.180]  Yeah, Alex, real quickly, that when Direct TV purposely burnt all these cards, no one's
[1:57:21.180 --> 1:57:25.980]  talked about this story, and to me, it was electronic warfare when you brought this up.
[1:57:25.980 --> 1:57:31.020]  But Alex, in the 70s, I grew up next to Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, and at that
[1:57:31.020 --> 1:57:36.060]  time they were experimenting with a high-pitched noise that was really deafening, similar to
[1:57:36.060 --> 1:57:37.060]  a dog whistle.
[1:57:37.060 --> 1:57:41.380]  And I think those type of weapons that will blow people's eardrums out and make their
[1:57:41.380 --> 1:57:44.820]  brains bleed is something that they're working on.
[1:57:44.820 --> 1:57:50.980]  Yeah, that's right, and they baby-step us with PAP, a little bit of rice cereal first.
[1:57:50.980 --> 1:57:53.900]  They rolled those out in the RNC four years ago.
[1:57:53.900 --> 1:57:57.860]  Now they've got them in most police departments waiting that, you know, they can do damage,
[1:57:57.860 --> 1:58:00.540]  but then they tell you, oh, they're not that deadly, but then they have the even bigger
[1:58:00.540 --> 1:58:07.020]  ones that do cause hemorrhages, and you're absolutely right, but that's why I say a cocktail
[1:58:07.020 --> 1:58:08.020]  of weapons.
[1:58:08.020 --> 1:58:11.500]  And we know what all this stuff is because they're busy selling us, I mean, they just
[1:58:11.500 --> 1:58:13.500]  announced they're going to use microwave guns on us.
[1:58:13.500 --> 1:58:18.260]  When you were talking about the contest you had for the Constitution yesterday with so
[1:58:18.260 --> 1:58:23.140]  many people who replied, I thought about you needed a bailout like Fannie Mae and Freddie
[1:58:23.140 --> 1:58:24.140]  Mac.
[1:58:24.140 --> 1:58:28.300]  I think the best thing is to have everybody read it and take one.
[1:58:28.300 --> 1:58:34.020]  But Alex, no one's discussed this subject again, and I want to thank you again with 9-1-1
[1:58:34.020 --> 1:58:35.020]  approaching us.
[1:58:35.020 --> 1:58:39.220]  It's 9-9-0-8, uh, we're finally getting some facts out, everybody's getting drunk.
[1:58:39.220 --> 1:58:40.220]  Good job, Chris.
[1:58:40.220 --> 1:58:41.220]  We got a jump.
[1:58:41.220 --> 1:58:42.220]  More calls straight ahead.
[1:58:42.220 --> 1:58:43.220]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:43.220 --> 1:58:44.220]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:44.220 --> 1:58:57.220]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:58:57.220 --> 1:58:58.720]  against this country.
[1:58:58.720 --> 1:59:00.940]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:59:00.940 --> 1:59:02.540]  But who is the enemy?
[1:59:02.540 --> 1:59:03.540]  Bin Laden.
[1:59:03.540 --> 1:59:04.540]  This is his MO.
[1:59:04.540 --> 1:59:08.140]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:59:08.140 --> 1:59:12.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:59:12.700 --> 1:59:15.300]  networks inside the United States.
[1:59:15.300 --> 1:59:19.780]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:59:19.780 --> 1:59:21.940]  in and on the U.S.
[1:59:21.940 --> 1:59:25.620]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:25.620 --> 1:59:31.100]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:59:31.100 --> 1:59:35.260]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[1:59:35.260 --> 1:59:36.260]  much more.
[1:59:36.260 --> 1:59:37.260]  Fabled Enemies.

[1:59:42.420 --> 1:59:44.420]  titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:59:44.420 --> 2:00:06.260]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[2:00:06.260 --> 2:00:07.260]  Big Brother.
[2:00:07.260 --> 2:00:09.260]  Mainstream media.
[2:00:09.260 --> 2:00:11.060]  Government cover-ups.
[2:00:11.060 --> 2:00:12.060]  You want answers?
[2:00:12.060 --> 2:00:14.500]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:14.500 --> 2:00:18.420]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:00:18.420 --> 2:00:22.860]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.860 --> 2:00:29.100]  Calling U.S. military, calling former military, I don't want you to give out anything classified
[2:00:29.100 --> 2:00:30.100]  on air.
[2:00:30.100 --> 2:00:32.900]  None of this stuff is classified.
[2:00:32.900 --> 2:00:36.380]  They always think it up in think tanks and brag right in their face what they're doing.
[2:00:36.380 --> 2:00:40.940]  And there's always classified versions of it.
[2:00:40.940 --> 2:00:45.740]  The particle beams, the radiation guns, the microwave guns, the sound cannons, the directed
[2:00:45.740 --> 2:00:52.140]  energy weapons through phone lines, power lines, looking through wall technology, drones,
[2:00:52.140 --> 2:00:57.260]  robo rats, cockroaches with explosives that crawl in your ear and blow the side of your
[2:00:57.260 --> 2:00:58.260]  head off.
[2:00:58.260 --> 2:01:00.260]  That's all declassified.
[2:01:00.260 --> 2:01:05.580]  Race specific bio weapons targeted to certain families or clans.
[2:01:05.580 --> 2:01:14.860]  We know all that's being tested in death laboratories, death core laboratories, an excellent 1,300,000
[2:01:14.860 --> 2:01:19.220]  extermination op in the last five and a half years in Iraq by excellent, excellent results
[2:01:19.220 --> 2:01:23.980]  for the New World Order, excellent results for the drug war, more drugs, more people
[2:01:23.980 --> 2:01:28.580]  in prison, the economy falling apart, more robberies, education, excellent job, everybody
[2:01:28.580 --> 2:01:32.580]  being dumbed down, mindless idiots, just to mechanize evil going quite well.
[2:01:32.580 --> 2:01:36.500]  It's hard to build stuff and be good, nice and help people and be loving and be strong.
[2:01:36.500 --> 2:01:40.860]  It's easy to be evil and sickening and twisted and degenerate and scum filled.
[2:01:40.860 --> 2:01:44.500]  So we're taking your calls about what are the super weapons?
[2:01:44.500 --> 2:01:49.060]  I want the military to call in here.
[2:01:49.060 --> 2:01:50.260]  I've listed all of these.
[2:01:50.260 --> 2:01:54.860]  Bob Woodward's out saying there's this incredible super weapon as big as the Manhattan Project.
[2:01:54.860 --> 2:01:55.860]  Leap forward.
[2:01:55.860 --> 2:01:58.700]  Well, we know what all these systems are.
[2:01:58.700 --> 2:02:00.780]  Which one is he talking about?
[2:02:00.780 --> 2:02:02.140]  That's so wondrous in Iraq.
[2:02:02.140 --> 2:02:03.140]  We know that's all bull.
[2:02:03.140 --> 2:02:07.900]  We know they funded the attacks, funded it, funded the breakup, funded the three groups
[2:02:07.900 --> 2:02:10.860]  killing each other and then paid them off to stop, and that's admitted, so it's not
[2:02:10.860 --> 2:02:11.860]  my opinion.
[2:02:11.860 --> 2:02:16.020]  This is, I'm just trying to scare everybody and act real, you know, elitist and claim,
[2:02:16.020 --> 2:02:20.460]  you know, our economy may be imploding and we may have leveraged fiat currency and bought
[2:02:20.460 --> 2:02:21.460]  up the planet with it.
[2:02:21.460 --> 2:02:26.980]  But we've got, we've got space rage, don't run, we are friends, you know, Mars attacks,
[2:02:26.980 --> 2:02:32.260]  shooting everybody, I mean, whatever, man, whatever.
[2:02:32.260 --> 2:02:37.740]  Let's go to Dan in Georgia than Dennis, oh, oh, oh, oh, claims he has a JD in Idaho.
[2:02:37.740 --> 2:02:39.180]  Let's skip to JD.
[2:02:39.180 --> 2:02:41.220]  JD, what is it?
[2:02:41.220 --> 2:02:42.220]  I'm there.
[2:02:42.220 --> 2:02:43.220]  Are you ready?
[2:02:43.220 --> 2:02:44.220]  Yes.
[2:02:44.220 --> 2:02:45.220]  Okay.
[2:02:45.220 --> 2:02:49.340]  Everybody who knows history knows the inventor of AC was Nikolai Tesla, correct?
[2:02:49.340 --> 2:02:50.340]  Yes.
[2:02:50.340 --> 2:02:51.340]  Okay.
[2:02:51.340 --> 2:02:53.860]  He had many, many inventions, hundreds of them.
[2:02:53.860 --> 2:02:59.380]  And the FBI grabbed it and burned down his place and killed a bunch of people.
[2:02:59.380 --> 2:03:05.820]  The one weapon that is, from what I've learned, is the deadliest of all is scholar weapons.
[2:03:05.820 --> 2:03:07.940]  Now the scalar death rate.
[2:03:07.940 --> 2:03:13.580]  Scalar weapons can pinpoint anyone in the world, one person, and kill him.
[2:03:13.580 --> 2:03:17.740]  It doesn't matter where he's at, if they can pinpoint him, they can kill him from anywhere
[2:03:17.740 --> 2:03:18.740]  in the world.
[2:03:18.740 --> 2:03:19.740]  And this is scary stuff.
[2:03:19.740 --> 2:03:23.460]  I learned about this five or six years ago, and it's scary.
[2:03:23.460 --> 2:03:28.020]  But who knows what they've done with it, since then, possibly they could destroy hundreds
[2:03:28.020 --> 2:03:29.340]  if not thousands of people.
[2:03:29.340 --> 2:03:30.340]  I don't know.
[2:03:30.340 --> 2:03:31.340]  But it's scary.
[2:03:31.340 --> 2:03:32.340]  Now, let me stop you.
[2:03:32.340 --> 2:03:33.340]  Scalar is real.
[2:03:33.340 --> 2:03:34.340]  Yes.
[2:03:34.340 --> 2:03:38.540]  There's a lot of cooks and quacks who then claim that they have reverse engineered it,
[2:03:38.540 --> 2:03:39.980]  and they're full of baloney.
[2:03:39.980 --> 2:03:44.420]  That's the problem is that all this stuff, a lot of this stuff has a basis in reality.
[2:03:44.420 --> 2:03:46.780]  It's just that the quacks have run wild with it.
[2:03:46.780 --> 2:03:48.940]  Well, how do you feel about it?
[2:03:48.940 --> 2:03:54.020]  I mean, I know I've read in major scientific journals that they've discovered decades ago
[2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:56.020]  and confirmed Tesla's scalar properties.
[2:03:56.020 --> 2:03:59.380]  They just don't know how to control it.
[2:03:59.380 --> 2:04:03.580]  I've heard that they can actually increase the strength of a hurricane by using a scalar
[2:04:03.580 --> 2:04:04.580]  weapon.
[2:04:04.580 --> 2:04:10.500]  Now, that was all certified Stanford Research Institute, declassified three years ago, AP
[2:04:10.500 --> 2:04:12.060]  Reuters, Fox News.
[2:04:12.060 --> 2:04:16.860]  They could create, control, steer, weaken, strengthen hurricanes with eight airplanes
[2:04:16.860 --> 2:04:23.140]  in 1967 with conventional nuclei spring.
[2:04:23.140 --> 2:04:25.340]  So I don't know about scalar.
[2:04:25.340 --> 2:04:27.260]  It's pretty scary stuff what I have researched.
[2:04:27.260 --> 2:04:31.260]  If you ever get the time, do some research on it.
[2:04:31.260 --> 2:04:34.420]  No, I've done research.
[2:04:34.420 --> 2:04:37.500]  Most of the academics that have written on it are too scared to come on the show.
[2:04:37.500 --> 2:04:42.820]  And I mean academics, not the quacks running around claiming they've got proton beams in
[2:04:42.820 --> 2:04:45.460]  their backyard, but I mean the real deal.
[2:04:45.460 --> 2:04:48.420]  And they've killed so many of these people, they kill them all the time.
[2:04:48.420 --> 2:04:50.420]  It's just absolute mass murder everywhere.
[2:04:50.420 --> 2:04:56.420]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts straight ahead, I will get to Dan and Dennis and JD and Kilroy
[2:04:56.420 --> 2:04:57.420]  and everybody else.
[2:04:57.420 --> 2:05:01.940]  I'm going to get to all of you, stay with us.
[2:05:01.940 --> 2:05:06.420]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes

[2:05:12.620 --> 2:05:15.140]  destroys the official fable forever.
[2:05:15.140 --> 2:05:19.420]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[2:05:19.420 --> 2:05:22.220]  family members receive answers to their questions.
[2:05:22.220 --> 2:05:26.180]  And the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[2:05:26.180 --> 2:05:29.620]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[2:05:29.620 --> 2:05:34.060]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change
[2:05:34.060 --> 2:05:37.780]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[2:05:52.900 --> 2:05:55.860]  We're in a no-holds-far information war.

[2:06:00.260 --> 2:06:01.260]  to Big Brother.
[2:06:01.260 --> 2:06:06.700]  Drank and Mate proudly presents another mind-boggling episode of America's toughest quiz show.
[2:06:06.700 --> 2:06:08.180]  That's too complicated!
[2:06:08.180 --> 2:06:12.260]  Let's see if we can figure out which contestant got the intellectual edge after an evening
[2:06:12.260 --> 2:06:14.580]  of partying by using Drank and Mate.
[2:06:14.580 --> 2:06:19.700]  For 20 points in the win, Nilt, Glurr5 and Blank, Kynate receptor subunits and hippocampal
[2:06:19.700 --> 2:06:22.260]  neurons co-assembled to form functional receptors.
[2:06:22.260 --> 2:06:23.940]  Uh, uh, Pony?
[2:06:23.940 --> 2:06:25.940]  Oh, too bad!
[2:06:25.940 --> 2:06:27.740]  Yes, Chip!
[2:06:27.740 --> 2:06:30.740]  The logical companion of Glurr5, Glurr6.
[2:06:30.740 --> 2:06:32.740]  You've won the game!
[2:06:32.740 --> 2:06:36.540]  Pay life is like a game, and if you want to win, you've got to give it your best every
[2:06:36.540 --> 2:06:40.820]  day, which doesn't always happen after an evening of celebrating with friends and family.
[2:06:40.820 --> 2:06:45.620]  That's why there's Drank and Mate, a patented formula of guava leaf extract proven to reduce
[2:06:45.620 --> 2:06:47.100]  the effects of hangover.
[2:06:47.100 --> 2:06:51.500]  It restores balance to your body, keeping headaches and nausea at bay, and it really
[2:06:51.500 --> 2:06:52.500]  works!
[2:06:52.500 --> 2:06:53.500]  Tell them, Don!
[2:06:53.500 --> 2:06:54.500]  Drank and Mate!
[2:06:54.500 --> 2:06:55.500]  I wouldn't be able to read this without it!

[2:06:58.500 --> 2:07:01.820]  Drank and Mate urges you to please drink responsibly.
[2:07:01.820 --> 2:07:05.100]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[2:07:05.100 --> 2:07:10.020]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by
[2:07:10.020 --> 2:07:15.220]  saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[2:07:15.220 --> 2:07:19.940]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution
[2:07:19.940 --> 2:07:22.900]  and also our national sovereignty.
[2:07:22.900 --> 2:07:28.660]  Is this what Americans want to be merged into a Communist-style one-world government?
[2:07:28.660 --> 2:07:33.260]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely

[2:07:59.140 --> 2:08:11.260]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:11.260 --> 2:08:16.260]  I had Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on a few weeks ago and he said, why did they snake attack
[2:08:16.260 --> 2:08:17.260]  Russia?
[2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:18.260]  Why did the U.S. back towards it?
[2:08:18.260 --> 2:08:19.260]  Why are they starting World War III?
[2:08:19.260 --> 2:08:20.260]  Why are they so arrogant?
[2:08:20.260 --> 2:08:21.260]  And I said, super weapons.
[2:08:21.260 --> 2:08:29.020]  We know they've got a decapitation system through Star Wars and a bunch of robotic
[2:08:29.020 --> 2:08:34.900]  platforms that have basically meteor guns for dropping, and this has been declassified
[2:08:34.900 --> 2:08:41.260]  parts of it, dropping DU rounds, solid rounds that get up to about 30,000 miles an hour.
[2:08:41.260 --> 2:08:45.060]  They can kill people in 500-foot-deep bunkers.
[2:08:45.060 --> 2:08:46.060]  No problem.
[2:08:46.060 --> 2:08:47.060]  Devastating effect.
[2:08:47.060 --> 2:08:49.380]  It blows the whole side of a mountain out.
[2:08:49.380 --> 2:08:52.220]  Just one of them weighs about 100 pounds, the bigger ones.
[2:08:52.220 --> 2:08:55.340]  They've got microwave guns, particle beams.
[2:08:55.340 --> 2:08:56.580]  I mean, you name it.
[2:08:56.580 --> 2:09:02.340]  And then now Bob Woodward comes on 60 minutes.
[2:09:02.340 --> 2:09:06.180]  He goes on CNN, Larry King Live last night and he says, they've got a super weapon as
[2:09:06.180 --> 2:09:08.500]  big as the Manhattan Project.
[2:09:08.500 --> 2:09:10.340]  That's what made the surge succeed.
[2:09:10.340 --> 2:09:15.260]  Well, funny, talking to people in the military and then even what's been in the press, it
[2:09:15.260 --> 2:09:19.460]  was billions of dollars in payoffs to the factions to stop killing each other.
[2:09:19.460 --> 2:09:23.020]  In day one, they ordered the bathers to break up, which caused a civil war, which they knew
[2:09:23.020 --> 2:09:25.380]  it would do, as an excuse to say there.
[2:09:25.380 --> 2:09:31.220]  Now they claim it is a victory to just have the killing subside somewhat.
[2:09:31.220 --> 2:09:35.980]  Now, that's a side issue, but I do want to get Dr. Robert's take A. As you heard about
[2:09:35.980 --> 2:09:41.340]  this big sensation with Woodward, Pulitzer Prize winner talking about super weapons.
[2:09:41.340 --> 2:09:45.300]  This is really like 1984, where they're always giving us a new super weapon to scare the
[2:09:45.300 --> 2:09:46.380]  world.
[2:09:46.380 --> 2:09:51.460]  And then I want to get into Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac.
[2:09:51.460 --> 2:09:53.900]  And you break down with this 50-plus billion trillion.
[2:09:53.900 --> 2:10:00.300]  It's hard to imagine that amount, trillion dollars and what this bailout means and how
[2:10:00.300 --> 2:10:05.260]  much they were leveraged and what's happening with the economy, because he's a former Wall
[2:10:05.260 --> 2:10:09.220]  Street Journal editor, the father of Reaganomics, head of policy department of the Treasury,
[2:10:09.220 --> 2:10:13.860]  syndicated columnist, and bestselling author of the book that's in second edition, The
[2:10:13.860 --> 2:10:15.100]  Tyranny of Good Intentions.
[2:10:15.100 --> 2:10:17.620]  Dr. Roberts, thanks for coming on with us.
[2:10:17.620 --> 2:10:18.620]  Sure, Alex.
[2:10:18.620 --> 2:10:22.020]  What do you think about talk of super weapons?
[2:10:22.020 --> 2:10:26.020]  Well, I don't know what Woodward thinks he's talking about.
[2:10:26.020 --> 2:10:31.300]  It's obviously quite silly as you pointed out that they weren't used in Iraq, even if
[2:10:31.300 --> 2:10:33.180]  they exist.
[2:10:33.180 --> 2:10:41.820]  And you're correct that the Iraqi violence was essentially contained by us putting 80,000
[2:10:41.820 --> 2:10:51.700]  insurgents on our payroll and by Iran telling Al-Sader to stand down his militia because
[2:10:51.700 --> 2:10:58.260]  the continuing violence played into the Bush regime's hands that they had to stay there
[2:10:58.260 --> 2:10:59.660]  to prevent a bloodbath.
[2:10:59.660 --> 2:11:09.220]  So the wind-downed violence is due to the Iranians calling off the Shiites whom they
[2:11:09.220 --> 2:11:15.620]  control and to the United States hiring the Sunnis and putting them on the payroll and
[2:11:15.620 --> 2:11:18.660]  paying them not to shoot at us.
[2:11:18.660 --> 2:11:23.980]  So that's all there is to that.
[2:11:23.980 --> 2:11:31.580]  Whatever super weapons Woodward thinks we have, they won't be useful against intercontinental
[2:11:31.580 --> 2:11:38.780]  ballistic missiles coming in from Russia or China or whoever we stupidly provoke.
[2:11:38.780 --> 2:11:47.540]  So it strikes me as just some kind of BS, maybe propaganda, to make Americans feel secure
[2:11:47.540 --> 2:11:51.220]  while their leaders pick a war with Russia.
[2:11:51.220 --> 2:11:53.700]  It sounds like something right out of 1984.
[2:11:53.700 --> 2:11:57.060]  I mean Big Brother's always got a new super weapon every month.
[2:11:57.060 --> 2:12:00.660]  Yeah, well that's what Hitler was saying in his final days, remember?
[2:12:00.660 --> 2:12:06.460]  Hitler was raving about all the new super weapons that were going to turn the war on.
[2:12:06.460 --> 2:12:08.860]  Oh my God, I didn't put two and two together.
[2:12:08.860 --> 2:12:09.860]  They are.
[2:12:09.860 --> 2:12:15.940]  They've literally entered bunker mentality with bragging about super weapons.
[2:12:15.940 --> 2:12:23.700]  Well, I think if they have any super weapons, they don't have economic ones or they haven't,
[2:12:23.700 --> 2:12:26.860]  they showed them to a shit.
[2:12:26.860 --> 2:12:36.300]  This Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac coming under the Treasury's arm, let me tell you what I
[2:12:36.300 --> 2:12:40.820]  think that's about.
[2:12:40.820 --> 2:12:48.020]  The United States, because of its huge budget and trade deficits, has to rely on the recycling
[2:12:48.020 --> 2:12:52.500]  of the trade deficit dollars to come back and finance our government and finance our
[2:12:52.500 --> 2:12:54.980]  mortgage market.
[2:12:54.980 --> 2:13:00.580]  And the foreigners were getting more and more reluctant to continue the recycling at the
[2:13:00.580 --> 2:13:10.060]  same rate because of dollar weakness and because of the apparent loss in value of these mortgages.
[2:13:10.060 --> 2:13:11.060]  Low interest rates.
[2:13:11.060 --> 2:13:18.940]  Yeah, yeah, and also, you see, Freddie Mae and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they issued
[2:13:18.940 --> 2:13:22.380]  their own debt in order to be able to carry these mortgages.
[2:13:22.380 --> 2:13:31.460]  So they weren't able to borrow, and so what the Treasury has done is to give some kind
[2:13:31.460 --> 2:13:41.820]  of additional protection to these mortgage giants in order to reassure foreign lenders
[2:13:41.820 --> 2:13:50.540]  so they will continue to recycle dollars into the U.S. mortgage market.
[2:13:50.540 --> 2:13:58.700]  And otherwise, there would be really no prospect at all of keeping the interest rates low.
[2:13:58.700 --> 2:14:02.220]  So this is just bringing the Ponzi scheme to another level.
[2:14:02.220 --> 2:14:04.580]  That's what it is.
[2:14:04.580 --> 2:14:12.740]  Now, the thing that's unsure to my mind about this, and I haven't had time to study this
[2:14:12.740 --> 2:14:21.780]  very carefully, but what it seems to me is if the Treasury takeover or whatever they've
[2:14:21.780 --> 2:14:32.060]  done with these two mortgage giants, if this means a guarantee of both all of the mortgages
[2:14:32.060 --> 2:14:39.620]  as well as the two companies' bonds, that is, the bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie
[2:14:39.620 --> 2:14:45.940]  Mac, if it means not just to guarantee of their bonds, but of the mortgages, then I'm
[2:14:45.940 --> 2:14:54.180]  not sure that the United States Treasury has not placed its own ability to borrow at risk
[2:14:54.180 --> 2:15:02.860]  because the size of that mortgage portfolio is so large that it's unrealistic to think
[2:15:02.860 --> 2:15:05.500]  that the U.S. Treasury can guarantee it.
[2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:09.580]  Well, sir, the way I read it, and of course you're a top economist now, but the way I
[2:15:09.580 --> 2:15:13.220]  read it in the papers is that they're saying they're guaranteeing all of it.
[2:15:13.220 --> 2:15:17.860]  They're guaranteeing the debt that was sold to people, they're guaranteeing the packages,
[2:15:17.860 --> 2:15:19.500]  they're guaranteeing the whole thing.
[2:15:19.500 --> 2:15:28.660]  Well, what this suggests to me then that they have overreached because sooner or later,
[2:15:28.660 --> 2:15:38.340]  financial markets and foreign creditors will figure out that such a massive guarantee undermines
[2:15:38.340 --> 2:15:46.220]  the Treasury's own financial capability and therefore it may undermine the ability of
[2:15:46.220 --> 2:15:48.700]  the Treasury to sell its own bonds.
[2:15:48.700 --> 2:15:53.980]  Well you ran the policy there, watching Paulson on TV and his minions, they looked like they
[2:15:53.980 --> 2:15:54.980]  were laying an egg.
[2:15:54.980 --> 2:15:59.820]  I mean, if they were trying to project bad confidence and trying to project that they
[2:15:59.820 --> 2:16:04.300]  looked like they'd just been caught with their hand in the cookie jar or caught robbing
[2:16:04.300 --> 2:16:05.300]  a bank.
[2:16:05.300 --> 2:16:12.740]  They were white-faced, they looked completely freaked out, the markets seemed to love it
[2:16:12.740 --> 2:16:13.740]  at least for a while.
[2:16:13.740 --> 2:16:18.660]  I mean, this is madness and even foreign governments are saying, you know, have we become more
[2:16:18.660 --> 2:16:20.980]  communist than China?
[2:16:20.980 --> 2:16:29.380]  Well, I don't think, you see, the notion of it being nationalized or whatever, that's
[2:16:29.380 --> 2:16:30.380]  not the real issue.
[2:16:30.380 --> 2:16:36.660]  The real issue is whether the United States Treasury has assumed a financial responsibility
[2:16:36.660 --> 2:16:42.220]  beyond its capability and therefore it would have no credibility.
[2:16:42.220 --> 2:16:47.020]  And that's what I think may come out.
[2:16:47.020 --> 2:16:54.260]  If that comes out, then the whole thing is over with very quickly because if people conclude
[2:16:54.260 --> 2:17:03.660]  that this guarantee is worthless because the Treasury can't make good on it, just like
[2:17:03.660 --> 2:17:10.500]  the guarantee the British gave the polls in 1940 against the Germans was worthless because
[2:17:10.500 --> 2:17:15.540]  they had no way of enforcing it.
[2:17:15.540 --> 2:17:22.140]  That may be what we have here and we may have the Treasury impairing its own ability to
[2:17:22.140 --> 2:17:30.260]  borrow by taking on too great of a responsibility to guarantee all, I mean, what are the sides
[2:17:30.260 --> 2:17:31.260]  of those mortgages?
[2:17:31.260 --> 2:17:33.500]  It's around six trillion dollars, isn't it?
[2:17:33.500 --> 2:17:37.460]  Yeah, well, they're saying that the bad ones are six trillion, but the whole thing is fifty-four
[2:17:37.460 --> 2:17:42.140]  trillion and now they're saying that the whole structure of the two consortiums are
[2:17:42.140 --> 2:17:43.140]  in trouble.
[2:17:43.140 --> 2:17:51.540]  Well, I don't know what the numbers are, but I think that they're kind of large to
[2:17:51.540 --> 2:18:02.380]  give that much of a guarantee and it may disturb people who are lending the money more than
[2:18:02.380 --> 2:18:03.380]  we would do.
[2:18:03.380 --> 2:18:04.380]  I mean, I've got CNBC here.
[2:18:04.380 --> 2:18:05.380]  Sure.
[2:18:05.380 --> 2:18:06.380]  Well, I've got CNBC right here.
[2:18:06.380 --> 2:18:11.460]  It says fifty-four trillion is what the total assets or the debt, you know, the whole shooting
[2:18:11.460 --> 2:18:14.900]  match of those two groups are.
[2:18:14.900 --> 2:18:18.220]  That seems too much to me, but...
[2:18:18.220 --> 2:18:20.940]  Well, the way they're always leveraging things, God knows.
[2:18:20.940 --> 2:18:31.620]  Well, I think that temporarily we have a risk fight because the Bush government got foreign
[2:18:31.620 --> 2:18:36.820]  central banks to agree to buy dollars so that we could keep the low interest rates through
[2:18:36.820 --> 2:18:44.900]  the election and this is given some comeback to the dollar and people will be relieved
[2:18:44.900 --> 2:18:49.620]  because they'll see the dollar rising, but it won't occur to them that it'll never go
[2:18:49.620 --> 2:18:53.540]  back to parity with the euro.
[2:18:53.540 --> 2:18:58.060]  And the oil price is coming down, so when the oil price ran up toward $150, everybody
[2:18:58.060 --> 2:18:59.060]  got nervous.
[2:18:59.060 --> 2:19:00.060]  It falls down toward $100.
[2:19:00.060 --> 2:19:01.060]  They feel relieved.
[2:19:01.060 --> 2:19:06.460]  The fact that it's not going to go back to $30, they don't think about it.
[2:19:06.460 --> 2:19:13.620]  And any time you have a rise or a decline in market speculators, usually take it too
[2:19:13.620 --> 2:19:14.620]  far.
[2:19:14.620 --> 2:19:18.260]  They had to take it too far up and when it falls back, they take it too far down and
[2:19:18.260 --> 2:19:19.260]  when it comes back.
[2:19:19.260 --> 2:19:21.940]  But it doesn't mean that it's over.
[2:19:21.940 --> 2:19:24.580]  It renews and starts again.
[2:19:24.580 --> 2:19:30.660]  And I don't see anything that has been done by the United States government or the Treasury
[2:19:30.660 --> 2:19:40.620]  that would reverse the bad condition of the dollar and I'm fearful that if this guarantee
[2:19:40.620 --> 2:19:47.340]  they've given it as big as it sounds like that it will impair the Treasury's own ability
[2:19:47.340 --> 2:19:55.020]  to borrow and therefore the great superpower will come to an end a lot quicker than we
[2:19:55.020 --> 2:19:56.020]  thought.
[2:19:56.020 --> 2:19:57.020]  Okay, Doc, stay there.
[2:19:57.020 --> 2:19:58.020]  See, I'm getting different numbers.
[2:19:58.020 --> 2:20:02.300]  Here's a Wall Street Journal saying it's only $1.5 trillion in bad debt.
[2:20:02.300 --> 2:20:05.340]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[2:20:05.340 --> 2:20:09.780]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[2:20:09.780 --> 2:20:10.780]  for your IRA?
[2:20:10.780 --> 2:20:11.780]  That's right.
[2:20:11.780 --> 2:20:15.940]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[2:20:15.940 --> 2:20:21.020]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets
[2:20:21.020 --> 2:20:22.460]  for your retirement.
[2:20:22.460 --> 2:20:28.140]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs,
[2:20:28.140 --> 2:20:30.620]  yet no word about IRAs.
[2:20:30.620 --> 2:20:34.740]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping
[2:20:34.740 --> 2:20:35.740]  you in paper.
[2:20:35.740 --> 2:20:41.980]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[2:20:41.980 --> 2:20:46.540]  Look at left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[2:20:46.540 --> 2:20:49.380]  Call 800-686-2237.
[2:20:49.380 --> 2:20:51.880]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[2:20:51.880 --> 2:20:55.380]  Call 800-686-2237.
[2:20:55.380 --> 2:21:01.900]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:21:01.900 --> 2:21:07.220]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:21:07.220 --> 2:21:08.700]  against this country.
[2:21:08.700 --> 2:21:10.940]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:21:10.940 --> 2:21:12.660]  But who is the enemy?
[2:21:12.660 --> 2:21:13.660]  bin Laden.
[2:21:13.660 --> 2:21:14.660]  This is his MO.
[2:21:14.660 --> 2:21:15.660]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:21:15.660 --> 2:21:17.660]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:21:17.660 --> 2:21:22.700]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:21:22.700 --> 2:21:25.300]  networks inside the United States.
[2:21:25.300 --> 2:21:29.180]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[2:21:29.180 --> 2:21:31.940]  spying in and on the U.S.
[2:21:31.940 --> 2:21:35.500]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:35.500 --> 2:21:40.900]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:21:40.900 --> 2:21:44.860]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and
[2:21:44.860 --> 2:21:48.860]  much, much more, fabled enemies.
[2:21:48.860 --> 2:21:53.940]  Average improvement in fuel economy typically ranges from 8 to 20 percent or more, saving
[2:21:53.940 --> 2:21:58.500]  you 30 to 80 cents on each gallon of fuel at the pump.
[2:21:58.500 --> 2:22:00.380]  Now there's a boost for your budget.

[2:22:31.060 --> 2:22:37.060]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently and
[2:22:37.060 --> 2:22:40.340]  she was talking about the Great Depression and we were talking about the gas prices,
[2:22:40.340 --> 2:22:44.980]  the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in these really kind of perilous times.
[2:22:44.980 --> 2:22:47.060]  No one knows where we're headed or where we might end up.
[2:22:47.060 --> 2:22:50.500]  And she was reminded of the Great Depression and how in those days, folks who lived in
[2:22:50.500 --> 2:22:54.180]  the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens and can
[2:22:54.180 --> 2:22:55.180]  their food.
[2:22:55.180 --> 2:22:58.380]  But how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities because they
[2:22:58.380 --> 2:23:01.660]  didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how and they didn't have the chickens
[2:23:01.660 --> 2:23:02.660]  and the livestock.
[2:23:02.660 --> 2:23:03.900]  So it's a lot different for them.
[2:23:03.900 --> 2:23:05.820]  Well, we know one thing's certain right now.
[2:23:05.820 --> 2:23:09.780]  We're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global food shortage.
[2:23:09.780 --> 2:23:11.100]  Now what can you do to prepare?
[2:23:11.100 --> 2:23:12.100]  Do what I did.
[2:23:12.100 --> 2:23:13.100]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[2:23:13.100 --> 2:23:17.380]  Go to the J. Michael Stevens, eFoodsDirect.com company, get some food and put it away and
[2:23:17.380 --> 2:23:18.380]  be safe.
[2:23:18.380 --> 2:23:19.700]  Put a little security in your life.
[2:23:19.700 --> 2:23:20.700]  You deserve security.
[2:23:20.700 --> 2:23:31.700]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, 1-800-409-5633, put some food away, do it now, 1-800-409-5633.
[2:23:31.700 --> 2:23:41.780]  Okay, during the break I read about, scanned through about 10 different articles.
[2:23:41.780 --> 2:23:47.780]  They're talking about the global mortgage structure being $50 plus trillion.
[2:23:47.780 --> 2:23:51.220]  The total U.S. mortgage AP says is $12 trillion.
[2:23:51.220 --> 2:23:52.860]  It says more than $5 trillion of that.
[2:23:52.860 --> 2:23:54.380]  I'm reading it right now.
[2:23:54.380 --> 2:23:57.460]  Bailout doesn't curb all credit woes as the headline.
[2:23:57.460 --> 2:24:01.340]  $5 trillion of that is Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[2:24:01.340 --> 2:24:05.460]  But regardless, when you get into these numbers, it's just staggering and then it causes a domino
[2:24:05.460 --> 2:24:06.460]  effect.
[2:24:06.460 --> 2:24:09.540]  Dr. Roberts, they're trying to do this balancing act.
[2:24:09.540 --> 2:24:15.660]  I mean, what do you think of the current policy and does this take over good or bad
[2:24:15.660 --> 2:24:17.220]  for the future of the economy?
[2:24:17.220 --> 2:24:23.740]  Well, I think as we were saying that it's the creative and new problem, which is the
[2:24:23.740 --> 2:24:31.300]  Treasury's own credibility because it's now guaranteed probably beyond its ability.
[2:24:31.300 --> 2:24:36.700]  The only way it can make good on the guarantee is to borrow the money itself.
[2:24:36.700 --> 2:24:48.700]  Now I'm looking here at a Reuters news release yesterday and it says that China owned $376
[2:24:48.700 --> 2:24:56.780]  billion of the debt issued by U.S. government agencies, principally Fannie and Freddie.
[2:24:56.780 --> 2:25:05.380]  So that means they owned the bonds issued by the two mortgage companies, which is a different
[2:25:05.380 --> 2:25:09.660]  trouble instrument from the mortgages themselves.
[2:25:09.660 --> 2:25:15.300]  And of course, the bonds of the two mortgage companies were trouble because their mortgage
[2:25:15.300 --> 2:25:16.420]  holdings were trouble.
[2:25:16.420 --> 2:25:27.580]  So the question China faces is that when the U.S. Treasury issues new debt to fund the
[2:25:27.580 --> 2:25:32.340]  bailout, should China buy that?
[2:25:32.340 --> 2:25:37.980]  And of course, if everybody decides, well, we probably shouldn't buy that because they
[2:25:37.980 --> 2:25:42.140]  already have to issue $600 billion just to finance the debt.
[2:25:42.140 --> 2:25:47.300]  What you're saying is if governments of Europe, the Arabs, China, Japan don't buy this new
[2:25:47.300 --> 2:25:50.700]  questionable debt, then what happens?
[2:25:50.700 --> 2:25:54.340]  Yeah, that's the whole empire is over.
[2:25:54.340 --> 2:25:58.700]  Okay, you were saying that before the break, talking about not having credibility.
[2:25:58.700 --> 2:26:03.980]  They went to the Euro, tried to get NATO in the Euro to put sanctions on Russia, didn't
[2:26:03.980 --> 2:26:11.540]  happen, Italy said it was ridiculous, Russia laughed at us, and then meanwhile our government's
[2:26:11.540 --> 2:26:16.420]  talking about super weapons, it does look like Hitler in the bunker.
[2:26:16.420 --> 2:26:24.180]  Well, I don't know if they are that aware of their precarious position.
[2:26:24.180 --> 2:26:33.780]  I'm not sure that they are, but they may be in which case that's a good analogy.
[2:26:33.780 --> 2:26:43.060]  But what I think that one thing we can conclude is that the Treasury had to step in and do
[2:26:43.060 --> 2:26:48.540]  something because of the recycling of dollars.
[2:26:48.540 --> 2:26:55.620]  If the foreigners quit recycling the dollars that they earn from our trade deficit, we
[2:26:55.620 --> 2:27:00.580]  have no way to finance the government, just the government's daily operations, which is
[2:27:00.580 --> 2:27:04.340]  independent of all these other financial crises.
[2:27:04.340 --> 2:27:08.620]  Now you used to run the Treasury, so they have to know these dangers, they're up there
[2:27:08.620 --> 2:27:14.900]  running it now, so why did they do the bailout if it endangers the entire credibility of
[2:27:14.900 --> 2:27:16.700]  the overall structure?
[2:27:16.700 --> 2:27:22.340]  Well, you may assume that they know more than they do, they remember that this government
[2:27:22.340 --> 2:27:30.380]  has shown every kind of hubris, and hubris leads people to overreach and step into quick
[2:27:30.380 --> 2:27:34.980]  plan and to do all kinds of stupid things that they shouldn't do.
[2:27:34.980 --> 2:27:38.860]  You have to also know that when I was in the Treasury, we still had regulation.
[2:27:38.860 --> 2:27:46.020]  We didn't have all of these unregulated financial instruments that nobody really understands.
[2:27:46.020 --> 2:27:50.620]  And we didn't have these kinds of vulnerable debt structures.
[2:27:50.620 --> 2:27:58.220]  All of this has been created in the decades after Reagan from the progressive deregulation.
[2:27:58.220 --> 2:28:01.460]  Now what, at 93 and then 96?
[2:28:01.460 --> 2:28:04.340]  I just don't remember right now, Alex, but...
[2:28:04.340 --> 2:28:07.780]  But I mean, I read the foreign publications, the foreign mainline publications about what
[2:28:07.780 --> 2:28:12.340]  happened there, and they talk about leveraging, like where they would take debt instruments,
[2:28:12.340 --> 2:28:15.940]  and then loan it out, their fractional reserve banking, and then create new banks and loan
[2:28:15.940 --> 2:28:16.940]  it out again.
[2:28:16.940 --> 2:28:17.940]  I mean, is that what you're talking about?
[2:28:17.940 --> 2:28:18.940]  That's right.
[2:28:18.940 --> 2:28:25.940]  And look, I don't know how much time we have left, but there's one other thing.
[2:28:25.940 --> 2:28:29.580]  And I don't know all about this, but I do know something.
[2:28:29.580 --> 2:28:33.340]  They have these credit default swaps.
[2:28:33.340 --> 2:28:41.540]  That is Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they have all these credit default swaps that I think
[2:28:41.540 --> 2:28:47.180]  when the Treasury steps in like this, legally now have to be unwound.
[2:28:47.180 --> 2:28:58.340]  And I'm not sure what the implications of that is, because to the market, he has never
[2:28:58.340 --> 2:29:06.460]  experienced settling a credit event that's so large, it's just huge to unwind all of
[2:29:06.460 --> 2:29:08.540]  these credit default swaps.
[2:29:08.540 --> 2:29:12.180]  So I don't know that they may find some legal way not to do it with it.
[2:29:12.180 --> 2:29:15.740]  Well, Dr. Roberts, we know you'll check in with us as this develops, we appreciate your
[2:29:15.740 --> 2:29:16.740]  great input.
[2:29:16.740 --> 2:29:17.740]  Go write your column.
[2:29:17.740 --> 2:29:19.740]  We appreciate you spending time with us.
[2:29:19.740 --> 2:29:21.140]  Okay, Alex.
[2:29:21.140 --> 2:29:22.140]  Thank you so much.
[2:29:22.140 --> 2:29:28.140]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:29:28.140 --> 2:29:29.140]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[2:29:29.140 --> 2:29:30.140]  I've come with a message of information.
[2:29:30.140 --> 2:29:31.140]  9-Eleven was an inside job.
[2:29:31.140 --> 2:29:32.140]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:29:32.140 --> 2:29:33.140]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:29:33.140 --> 2:29:34.140]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage?
[2:29:34.140 --> 2:29:35.140]  Was it engineered by you, David Bacchus?
[2:29:35.140 --> 2:29:58.140]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:29:58.140 --> 2:29:59.140]  to grow at our own door.
[2:29:59.140 --> 2:30:06.140]  After the attacks of September 11, a global awakening is taking place.
[2:30:06.140 --> 2:30:09.140]  An inside job?
[2:30:09.140 --> 2:30:11.140]  How dare you?
[2:30:11.140 --> 2:30:14.140]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:30:14.140 --> 2:30:17.140]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:30:17.140 --> 2:30:22.140]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[2:30:22.140 --> 2:30:23.140]  anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[2:30:23.140 --> 2:30:28.140]  Since rising, download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:30:28.140 --> 2:30:31.140]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:30:31.140 --> 2:30:34.140]  Do you ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[2:30:34.140 --> 2:30:37.140]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[2:30:37.140 --> 2:30:40.140]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[2:30:40.140 --> 2:30:43.140]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[2:30:43.140 --> 2:30:47.140]  Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[2:30:47.140 --> 2:30:49.140]  Online from my desk with WebEx.
[2:30:49.140 --> 2:30:53.140]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[2:30:53.140 --> 2:30:57.140]  I just talked to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from
[2:30:57.140 --> 2:31:02.140]  their desktop so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[2:31:31.140 --> 2:31:36.140]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.
[2:31:36.140 --> 2:31:40.140]  Our goal is to get these fine hemp products to you in the least amount of time so you

[2:32:15.140 --> 2:32:18.140]  If the body has the proper nutrition, it will heal itself.
[2:32:18.140 --> 2:32:22.140]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the US?
[2:32:22.140 --> 2:32:25.140]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[2:32:25.140 --> 2:32:31.140]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempUSA.org today.
[2:32:42.140 --> 2:32:52.140]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[2:32:52.140 --> 2:32:57.140]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[2:32:57.140 --> 2:33:05.140]  There'll be a golden letter reaching down when the man comes around.
[2:33:05.140 --> 2:33:09.140]  I wonder if their space planes and particle beams will save them from that.
[2:33:09.140 --> 2:33:19.140]  The hairs on your arm will stand up at the terror in each sip and in each sun.
[2:33:19.140 --> 2:33:30.140]  Will you partake of that last offered cup or disappear into the potter's ground?
[2:33:30.140 --> 2:33:33.140]  When the man comes around.
[2:33:33.140 --> 2:33:39.140]  We need to stop being ignorant trumpets here, the piper fools.
[2:33:39.140 --> 2:33:44.140]  One hundred million angels singing.
[2:33:44.140 --> 2:33:50.140]  Multitudes are marching to the big cattle ground.
[2:33:50.140 --> 2:33:55.140]  Voices calling, voices crying.
[2:33:55.140 --> 2:34:00.140]  Some are born and some are dying.
[2:34:00.140 --> 2:34:04.140]  It's Alpha and Omega's King come.
[2:34:04.140 --> 2:34:08.140]  Well, you just heard the former head of the treasury.
[2:34:08.140 --> 2:34:11.140]  Dr. Roberts had a policy there.
[2:34:11.140 --> 2:34:15.140]  He didn't think the US government can back this up.
[2:34:15.140 --> 2:34:17.140]  That's the whole point.
[2:34:17.140 --> 2:34:21.140]  We're only there to back it up while the assets are transferred to foreign Swiss bank accounts.
[2:34:21.140 --> 2:34:23.140]  Then into foreign assets.
[2:34:23.140 --> 2:34:25.140]  We are meant to be imploded.
[2:34:25.140 --> 2:34:37.140]  That's the next phase of the IMF and World Bank document plans is to leave us fully holding the bag.
[2:34:37.140 --> 2:34:42.140]  They always like to give us a little terror attack or something.
[2:34:42.140 --> 2:34:49.140]  So we gather around them while they abuse us, while they rape us financially and physically.
[2:34:49.140 --> 2:34:52.140]  Now, Paul Watts is doing an article about what is the secret weapon?
[2:34:52.140 --> 2:35:01.140]  What is the secret weapon that is being used in Iraq that supposedly won the day?
[2:35:01.140 --> 2:35:02.140]  Which is made up.
[2:35:02.140 --> 2:35:04.140]  It was cash payoffs that won the day.
[2:35:04.140 --> 2:35:08.140]  Pentagon official policy was to go in and break the country up.
[2:35:08.140 --> 2:35:11.140]  So sectarian violence is a pretext to stay.
[2:35:11.140 --> 2:35:16.140]  Then they would pay off the insurgents to bring some level of order.
[2:35:16.140 --> 2:35:18.140]  I said that the day of the war.
[2:35:18.140 --> 2:35:20.140]  I said it the day before the war.
[2:35:20.140 --> 2:35:24.140]  I said it the day after the war started in March of 2003.
[2:35:24.140 --> 2:35:26.140]  Not because I'm smart.
[2:35:26.140 --> 2:35:30.140]  I've learned to read what the enemies of liberty and freedom have to say.
[2:35:30.140 --> 2:35:33.140]  What the hijackers of this nation say.
[2:35:33.140 --> 2:35:37.140]  You know, we treat this criminal illegitimate government like it's official.
[2:35:37.140 --> 2:35:41.140]  Because it wears fancy blue uniforms and fancy green uniforms.
[2:35:41.140 --> 2:35:46.140]  And lots of shiny epaulets and fancy hats and tells us we've got to bow down to them.
[2:35:46.140 --> 2:35:54.140]  Oh, it's so nicely tailored.
[2:35:54.140 --> 2:35:55.140]  It's a joke.
[2:35:55.140 --> 2:35:58.140]  It's a fraud.
[2:35:58.140 --> 2:36:04.140]  I mean, if you were in a Greyhound bus and some guy came in when you were at a park to the gas station.
[2:36:04.140 --> 2:36:06.140]  Everybody goes into the rest stop.
[2:36:06.140 --> 2:36:11.140]  And somebody comes in, clubs the bus driver in the head in front of you.
[2:36:11.140 --> 2:36:14.140]  But then puts on his uniform.
[2:36:14.140 --> 2:36:19.140]  Everybody would just get on board and say, oh, well, but it doesn't matter if you clubbed him in the head.
[2:36:19.140 --> 2:36:22.140]  It doesn't matter if you're hijacking this bus.
[2:36:22.140 --> 2:36:26.140]  We're going to just go ahead and say it's official because you're wearing a blue cap.
[2:36:26.140 --> 2:36:28.140]  And a blue blazer.
[2:36:28.140 --> 2:36:29.140]  I mean, what has Northcom done?
[2:36:29.140 --> 2:36:33.140]  What has the presidency done saying Congress runs nothing and declaring in the U.S.
[2:36:33.140 --> 2:36:39.140]  a war zone and the people enemies and the CIA domestically operating and overturning the Bill of Rights
[2:36:39.140 --> 2:36:49.140]  and Constitution and just corruption running rampant and attacking innocent countries and lying about why we're there.
[2:36:49.140 --> 2:36:50.140]  It's got to stop.
[2:36:50.140 --> 2:36:54.140]  Let's go to Dan and George and Dan, go ahead.
[2:36:54.140 --> 2:36:55.140]  Good luck.
[2:36:55.140 --> 2:36:57.140]  Alex, good talking to you. Love your show.
[2:36:57.140 --> 2:37:06.140]  I know it's not cosmic or anything, but the microwave gun that we're talking about from the 60 Minutes show,
[2:37:06.140 --> 2:37:11.140]  we're led to believe it's just a pulse device for crowd control, population control.
[2:37:11.140 --> 2:37:18.140]  But I'd like to point out an article on Reese.com where it goes right into the title,
[2:37:18.140 --> 2:37:25.140]  glorifying U.S. secret weapon unleashed in Baghdad, and it was released August 25, 2003.
[2:37:25.140 --> 2:37:28.140]  And it's the account from an Iraqi infantryman.
[2:37:28.140 --> 2:37:30.140]  And if I could, could I just read a paragraph from it?
[2:37:30.140 --> 2:37:32.140]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:37:32.140 --> 2:37:37.140]  It says, in the midst of fighting, he noticed that Americans had called up an oddly configured tank.
[2:37:37.140 --> 2:37:43.140]  Then to his amazement, the tank suddenly let loose a blinding stream of what seemed like fire and lightning
[2:37:43.140 --> 2:37:49.140]  engulfing a large passenger bus and three automobiles. Within seconds, the bus had become semi-molten,
[2:37:49.140 --> 2:37:52.140]  sagging, like a wet rag as he put it.
[2:37:52.140 --> 2:37:57.140]  He said the bus rapidly melted under his withering blast, under this withering blast,
[2:37:57.140 --> 2:38:02.140]  shrinking it until it was a twisted blob about the dimensions of a VW bug.
[2:38:02.140 --> 2:38:08.140]  Explicitly, he explicitly described seeing numerous bodies shriveled to the size of newborn babies.
[2:38:08.140 --> 2:38:14.140]  By the time local street fighting ended that day, he estimated between 500 and 600 soldiers
[2:38:14.140 --> 2:38:20.140]  and civilians had been cooked alive as a result of the mysterious tank-mounted device.
[2:38:20.140 --> 2:38:23.140]  Which, again, is nothing but a terror weapon.
[2:38:23.140 --> 2:38:28.140]  It's not even as good as normal projectile weapons. It just produces horror.
[2:38:28.140 --> 2:38:31.140]  And we do know they have things like that.
[2:38:31.140 --> 2:38:36.140]  Yeah, that's, I mean, that's sick. That's sick.
[2:38:36.140 --> 2:38:42.140]  Well, it was photographed in Fallujah. They used nerve gas, artillery launched,
[2:38:42.140 --> 2:38:48.140]  and they used microwave guns that are not the type you see on 60 Minutes where they widen the beam
[2:38:48.140 --> 2:38:52.140]  and it just hurts. They can focus that and it burns you.
[2:38:52.140 --> 2:38:55.140]  But, of course, they tell the cattle that it's safe and good.
[2:38:55.140 --> 2:39:02.140]  Remember a year and a half ago, the head of the Air Force, the civilian head,
[2:39:02.140 --> 2:39:06.140]  like you have the Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Air Force,
[2:39:06.140 --> 2:39:10.140]  came out and associated press and said, under international convention,
[2:39:10.140 --> 2:39:13.140]  it's illegal for us to use microwave guns in Iraq.
[2:39:13.140 --> 2:39:19.140]  But if we use it first in the U.S., we can claim that sets of precedent that it's a police device
[2:39:19.140 --> 2:39:22.140]  and use them in Iraq. That should be added to your story, Paul Watson.
[2:39:22.140 --> 2:39:24.140]  I remember that. I know about that. I know about that.
[2:39:24.140 --> 2:39:27.140]  Paul Watson's listening. I wanted to add that.
[2:39:27.140 --> 2:39:34.140]  The device is not just population control. It just doesn't increase your temperature to 130 degrees.
[2:39:34.140 --> 2:39:40.140]  I mean, molten metal is a big deal. This really, if they put it out like you said at the DNC,
[2:39:40.140 --> 2:39:44.140]  this is population control. This is giving up our rights as a civilian.
[2:39:44.140 --> 2:39:48.140]  We have no rights anymore. We can't even get together as a group.
[2:39:48.140 --> 2:39:50.140]  Why do you think mayors call us civilians?
[2:39:50.140 --> 2:39:52.140]  You can't do anything at this point.
[2:39:52.140 --> 2:39:54.140]  Why do you think mayors call us civilians for 10 years?
[2:39:54.140 --> 2:39:58.140]  They've been paid off by Delta Force. They've been paid off, I mean, literally with bags of cash.
[2:39:58.140 --> 2:40:00.140]  They took over a long time ago.
[2:40:00.140 --> 2:40:07.140]  They took over Woodrow Wilson described that the biggest mistake he made as president
[2:40:07.140 --> 2:40:13.140]  was giving the banking system to the elite private bankers, the 12 elite bankers in their own country.
[2:40:13.140 --> 2:40:17.140]  I appreciate your call. Great call, Dan. The issuance of currency.
[2:40:17.140 --> 2:40:20.140]  They bought the world with it and then left us holding the bag.
[2:40:20.140 --> 2:40:24.140]  And if we don't like it, we'll just be killed.
[2:40:24.140 --> 2:40:34.140]  And a bunch of dumb, know-it-all individuals are just running around,
[2:40:34.140 --> 2:40:40.140]  still worshiping the government, still flapping Chinese desecrated American flags made by slaves,
[2:40:40.140 --> 2:40:46.140]  still just believing the Kool-Aid. And you better stop believing the Kool-Aid folks.
[2:40:46.140 --> 2:40:48.140]  That's the only way to turn this around.
[2:40:48.140 --> 2:40:54.140]  The nightmare has not even begun. And if you don't wake up, the nightmare is going to take place.
[2:40:54.140 --> 2:40:56.140]  And it's that simple.
[2:40:56.140 --> 2:41:01.140]  Dennis and Marilyn and Jason, Joe, Alex, Richard and others. Go ahead, Dennis.
[2:41:01.140 --> 2:41:06.140]  Yeah, hi, Alex. I'm looking at an article here, Army's Greatest Inventions of 2007.
[2:41:06.140 --> 2:41:12.140]  And one of the things I want to share, all these space weapons pretty much have to have line of sight at work properly.
[2:41:12.140 --> 2:41:14.140]  And you've got a lot of air traffic up there.
[2:41:14.140 --> 2:41:25.140]  But what's one of these 10 weapons that we're honored here is an XM-982 Excalibur precision-guided extended-range artillery projectile.
[2:41:25.140 --> 2:41:35.140]  Now, what this amounts to is a GPS-navigated artillery round, which makes it a mini cruise missile.
[2:41:35.140 --> 2:41:38.140]  And this is old, fried, and true technology.
[2:41:38.140 --> 2:41:41.140]  Yeah, let me stop. My cousin was telling me about this.
[2:41:41.140 --> 2:41:48.140]  He was talking about when they're in their bases and they're shooting mortars over the line at them.
[2:41:48.140 --> 2:41:54.140]  How, what was he saying? It's a system that triangulates.
[2:41:54.140 --> 2:41:59.140]  And he mentioned how they see the arc, the trajectory.
[2:41:59.140 --> 2:42:03.140]  Was he saying it was a new radar? What was he saying it was?
[2:42:03.140 --> 2:42:05.140]  To where they know exactly where it is.
[2:42:05.140 --> 2:42:12.140]  And their artillery automatically with GPS aims down to like a foot of where that came from.
[2:42:12.140 --> 2:42:20.140]  I was a veteran and back in 1972 when I joined the Marine Corps, we had an artillery officer who was our enlisted officer.
[2:42:20.140 --> 2:42:27.140]  And he went to the range at that time and fired an artillery round that he thought he was safe location.
[2:42:27.140 --> 2:42:30.140]  And within three minutes he was told his exact record.
[2:42:30.140 --> 2:42:40.140]  And this is back in 1972. So, but this particular artillery round with GPS in it, it can be, it doesn't have to have line of sight.
[2:42:40.140 --> 2:42:45.140]  And it's true in tri-technology and they probably got him even smaller.
[2:42:45.140 --> 2:42:49.140]  And these things, GPS is basically a data stream.
[2:42:49.140 --> 2:42:54.140]  So the computer that's on board this projectile, it doesn't have to hit a target.
[2:42:54.140 --> 2:43:03.140]  In other words, it can, as long as it has a GPS location, that computer, as soon as it reaches that location digitally, it can explode.
[2:43:03.140 --> 2:43:10.140]  So that means it can fly into the open window of an automobile, explode before it goes out the open window on the other side.
[2:43:10.140 --> 2:43:18.140]  And the GPS is tried through reliable, faithful, and I believe it worked very well for them in the Twin Towers in New York City.
[2:43:18.140 --> 2:43:22.140]  And I believe it worked very well for them at the Pentagon.
[2:43:22.140 --> 2:43:25.140]  Well, it certainly did to that 16-foot hole.
[2:43:25.140 --> 2:43:28.140]  Now, wait, I have to go back to memory.
[2:43:28.140 --> 2:43:34.140]  It was out at our ranch at a party about a month and a half ago, two months ago.
[2:43:34.140 --> 2:43:39.140]  My cousin, fresh back from Baghdad, he's been in the Army like 18 years.
[2:43:39.140 --> 2:43:51.140]  He was laughing about how they would launch mortar attacks at him and how they would go out and look at him like they were fireworks displays because, you know, they were bored.
[2:43:51.140 --> 2:43:54.140]  And what did he say? What is the system?
[2:43:54.140 --> 2:44:00.140]  He described it, and I was halfway listening because I'd read about, you know, other things like that.
[2:44:00.140 --> 2:44:08.140]  They have those Humvees that have those big cannons, you know, those big 50-cals on the top that has infrared and the scope.
[2:44:08.140 --> 2:44:20.140]  And electronically, like a video game follows wherever you are, wherever you're acoustically shooting at them from, the gun automatically focuses in on your location.
[2:44:20.140 --> 2:44:32.140]  And then it fires at you. So wherever it sees muzzle flashes, wherever it gets the acoustic reverberation of being fired on, it fires at with precision.
[2:44:32.140 --> 2:44:37.140]  I mean, that's an urban warrior in 1999. We're out there filming the Marine Corps with their Humvees doing that.
[2:44:37.140 --> 2:44:46.140]  But my cousin was talking about something else. It was radar, but he said it's incredibly powerful where they see it as soon as it goes up above like 10 feet.
[2:44:46.140 --> 2:44:55.140]  And then it automatically maps and dials into their artillery and their mortars and then lays it down on them where it's just completely devastating.
[2:44:55.140 --> 2:44:58.140]  So we should add that Paul Watson to the article as well.
[2:44:58.140 --> 2:45:04.140]  But he's talking about something on the order of the Manhattan Project, something completely new and huge.
[2:45:04.140 --> 2:45:10.140]  I mean, they had proximity RFID in anti-aircraft artillery in World War II.
[2:45:10.140 --> 2:45:19.140]  So I don't know if it's guided artillery rounds, but that would certainly be part of the cocktail of super weapons.
[2:45:19.140 --> 2:45:21.140]  Anything else, Dennis?
[2:45:21.140 --> 2:45:28.140]  No, that's pretty much it. And you know, there's an indication to me anyway that that's probably what hit the Pentagon was a bunker buster.
[2:45:28.140 --> 2:45:39.140]  And that may have been the reason for the secondary explosion at the Pentagon because these bunker busters are designed, engineered to explode and destroy themselves in cases of dud.
[2:45:39.140 --> 2:45:42.140]  Well, they also penetrate and then they explode.
[2:45:42.140 --> 2:45:53.140]  Yeah, they explode, but there's explosions throughout the body of the device to assure that there's no identifiable or reverse engineering capabilities on any of the components.
[2:45:53.140 --> 2:45:56.140]  Plus, you don't know who blew up the bunker. They can also deny it.
[2:45:56.140 --> 2:45:58.140]  Yeah. Well, Alex, thank you.
[2:45:58.140 --> 2:46:02.140]  I appreciate your call. All part of the friendliness of the government.
[2:46:02.140 --> 2:46:05.140]  Let's go ahead and the criminal government.
[2:46:05.140 --> 2:46:12.140]  It's just so sick. I want them to be good guys. I want to think everything's okay. It's not. They're poisoning us.
[2:46:12.140 --> 2:46:18.140]  And all of us are under the attack. 99% of us are on the wrong end of the stick.
[2:46:18.140 --> 2:46:29.140]  We have to understand we're together. Military, police, government. This is real. And you denying it doesn't make it go away. God help us.
[2:46:29.140 --> 2:46:32.140]  Jason and Illinois, you're on the air.
[2:46:32.140 --> 2:46:33.140]  How are you doing, Alex?
[2:46:33.140 --> 2:46:34.140]  Good, sir.
[2:46:34.140 --> 2:46:40.140]  Well, it's an honor to talk to you, actually. I just started listening to you a little while ago.
[2:46:40.140 --> 2:46:44.140]  When I first started, and I apologize for being off topic, but I do hope you'll take my call.
[2:46:44.140 --> 2:46:45.140]  Come on, go ahead.
[2:46:45.140 --> 2:46:57.140]  When I first started listening, it was around the time that a caller called with Willie Nelson and all of a sudden there's an event coming up.
[2:46:57.140 --> 2:47:03.140]  There's an event happening. So I've got something I just want to throw at you and see what you think.
[2:47:03.140 --> 2:47:15.140]  What if, with the platform that you have, what if you call out some of these ego maniacs like Sean Hannity or someone like that and you say, you know what?
[2:47:15.140 --> 2:47:21.140]  Let's do a televised event. I'll bring my information. You bring what you got.
[2:47:21.140 --> 2:47:31.140]  Why would the establishment give, we've done that. Why would they give us a platform so that we could debunk them and then give us attention?
[2:47:31.140 --> 2:47:34.140]  The game they've been playing is ignoring us.
[2:47:34.140 --> 2:47:44.140]  First they ignore you, then they attack you. First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[2:47:44.140 --> 2:47:51.140]  And I'm just telling you that they're not going to have any televised debates with me.
[2:47:51.140 --> 2:47:52.140]  Okay, thanks.
[2:47:52.140 --> 2:48:03.140]  I'm not saying it's a bad idea to bring it forward. I mean, it's one thing if Rush Limbaugh occasionally says I'm a nut, but Limbaugh just bashed us a bunch yesterday and I haven't listened to the whole clip.
[2:48:03.140 --> 2:48:08.140]  John has. They don't mention us by name, do they?
[2:48:08.140 --> 2:48:16.140]  Yes, see, they're very careful. Now Limbaugh has mentioned me before by name and so have others, but generally they don't. They're very careful.
[2:48:16.140 --> 2:48:22.140]  They don't want to give us any publicity because they know we're already viral against their disease.
[2:48:22.140 --> 2:48:34.140]  They already know that we were getting the high ground and so they don't want to elevate us or quote, you know, validated would be their words.
[2:48:34.140 --> 2:48:36.140]  I think it'd be worth a try still.
[2:48:36.140 --> 2:48:39.140]  Well, we've tried many times. Thanks for the call though.
[2:48:39.140 --> 2:48:47.140]  But I'm not bashing you for coming up with the idea. I'm just telling you we've done it. But hey, it's your challenges to all of them.
[2:48:47.140 --> 2:48:51.140]  They just then arrogantly think I'm begging, you know, to challenge them.
[2:48:51.140 --> 2:48:57.140]  These guys only do things if stuff's rigged. They're cowards.
[2:48:57.140 --> 2:49:02.140]  You know, they think they're still the biggest game in town. That's changing. That's why they want to shut the web down.
[2:49:02.140 --> 2:49:13.140]  It was a Washington Post editorial a few days ago. Kurt Nemo did a big editorial on it last night saying shut down the Internet, shut down free speech, shut down blogs,
[2:49:13.140 --> 2:49:20.140]  and basically register people, tax people to be able to even basically post on message boards.
[2:49:20.140 --> 2:49:28.140]  I mean, their industry is being shut down. They're lying, puke filled, spook filled, mainline media is dying.
[2:49:28.140 --> 2:49:39.140]  And hey, it's too late. It's too late like the Def Leppard song. I mean, it is too late. Too late for you.
[2:49:39.140 --> 2:49:45.140]  You can get us individually, but you can't kill this idea. Ideas are bulletproof.
[2:49:45.140 --> 2:49:52.140]  Okay, who's up next? Joe Infilla, you're on the air.
[2:49:52.140 --> 2:49:53.140]  Hello?
[2:49:53.140 --> 2:49:55.140]  Yes, go ahead. I'm going to hold you over, but go ahead.
[2:49:55.140 --> 2:50:03.140]  How are you? I'm a Prism Planet TV member. I listen to you all the time. I'd like to expand on Dr. Roberts analysis.
[2:50:03.140 --> 2:50:16.140]  Sure. Stay there. We'll come back, talk about it. And then we'll also talk to a bunch of other people like Alex, Richard, Helen, and others.
[2:50:16.140 --> 2:50:21.140]  We don't have another guest joining us for about 45 minutes or so.
[2:50:21.140 --> 2:50:31.140]  Very important guest, but we'll stay with us for that. But I've got some of yesterday's news and today's news that I haven't gotten to. I want to cover, so stay with us.
[2:50:31.140 --> 2:50:38.140]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:50:38.140 --> 2:50:42.140]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:50:42.140 --> 2:50:44.140]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:50:44.140 --> 2:50:47.140]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:50:47.140 --> 2:50:54.140]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:50:54.140 --> 2:51:01.140]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:51:01.140 --> 2:51:05.140]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:51:05.140 --> 2:51:15.140]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:51:15.140 --> 2:51:24.140]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.

[2:54:02.140 --> 2:54:10.140]  He hit on most points, and I'm sure with his background he's trying to speak to the layman.
[2:54:10.140 --> 2:54:21.140]  What really happened with Fannie and Freddie is a double-edged sword here. They were unable to sell their bonds on the market.
[2:54:21.140 --> 2:54:33.140]  Now, historically speaking, the international market bought Fannie and Freddie bonds similar to the way they purchased treasuries. They were considered competing markets.
[2:54:33.140 --> 2:54:40.140]  And now, Roberts is saying that this may have tainted further US Treasury bonds themselves.
[2:54:40.140 --> 2:54:45.140]  That's correct. He is correct in that assessment because here's what happened.
[2:54:45.140 --> 2:54:55.140]  There was always this implied guarantee that in the event that Fannie and Freddie would default, that the government would step in.
[2:54:55.140 --> 2:55:03.140]  But it's not just the default of the mortgages, it's the securities they sold.
[2:55:03.140 --> 2:55:09.140]  That's correct. In other words, the securities or the bonds that Fannie and Freddie sold are international contracts.
[2:55:09.140 --> 2:55:14.140]  And then those have been leveraged out 10 times in fractional reserve banking and then 10 times again.
[2:55:14.140 --> 2:55:18.140]  And so that's why we get numbers in the 50-plus trillion.
[2:55:18.140 --> 2:55:28.140]  That's correct because oftentimes the bank will sell the mortgages to Fannie and Freddie like Citigroup or Wells Fargo.
[2:55:28.140 --> 2:55:31.140]  Well, you sure are informed about this. Is this what you do for a living?
[2:55:31.140 --> 2:55:37.140]  I was actually a regulator for quite a while.
[2:55:37.140 --> 2:55:40.140]  And so I guess there's no regulators anymore or I guess they're playing golf.
[2:55:40.140 --> 2:55:46.140]  Well, I was one of the people who actually drew the line in the sand. I haven't worked for a couple years.
[2:55:46.140 --> 2:55:49.140]  Really?
[2:55:49.140 --> 2:55:53.140]  Well, then you're an expert. You've got the floor. Tell us what happened.
[2:55:53.140 --> 2:56:03.140]  Okay, so yes, you're correct in terms of the expansion of the money supply in that the banks would sell the loans.
[2:56:03.140 --> 2:56:10.140]  Fannie and Freddie would bundle them up in triple A rate at securities, which is kind of a false rating.
[2:56:10.140 --> 2:56:18.140]  And then the bank would buy the bond back. So now the bank has an asset on their books.
[2:56:18.140 --> 2:56:25.140]  And that asset, they can now leverage against that asset. Does that make sense?
[2:56:25.140 --> 2:56:28.140]  Yeah, it sounds like a complete scam.
[2:56:28.140 --> 2:56:35.140]  Well, it is. It's part of the Ponzi scheme and you're correct. It is a Ponzi scheme, but the bottom line is they sell the loans to Fannie and Freddie.
[2:56:35.140 --> 2:56:41.140]  They bundled it up into securities and oftentimes would sell it back to the bank.
[2:56:41.140 --> 2:56:46.140]  Now here's what happened at the beginning of the year, which is why they went and sold them.
[2:56:46.140 --> 2:56:55.140]  They increased the per loan limit to $750,000 per loan.
[2:56:55.140 --> 2:57:10.140]  What this did is it enabled the city groups, the Wells Fargo's, the Wachovia's, blah, blah, blah, blah, to sell a risky component known as the Jumbo market to Fannie and Freddie.
[2:57:10.140 --> 2:57:18.140]  But the thing is, is that they could no longer sell, Fannie and Freddie could no longer sell their bonds because no one was buying them.
[2:57:18.140 --> 2:57:22.140]  Now the Jumbo, what is 500,000 dollar home loans and above?
[2:57:22.140 --> 2:57:40.140]  And above, that's correct. So by increasing the loan limit, the banks were able to sell off a larger portion of their portfolios that were causing them to be illiquid.
[2:57:40.140 --> 2:57:50.140]  But they also forced the hand of the government, which was to bail out Fannie and Freddie, because Fannie and Freddie could no longer sell their bonds on the international market.
[2:57:50.140 --> 2:58:01.140]  Hey, Joe, stay there. We'll be back in one minute, and then I want you to talk about, from a regulator's perspective, where you see this going, how you see this unfolding.
[2:58:01.140 --> 2:58:05.140]  We'll be back. Folks, I've done three hours of radio and I haven't even plugged yet.
[2:58:05.140 --> 2:58:21.140]  The fact that the new film Fable Enemies is out and is available at infowaters.com.

[2:59:36.140 --> 2:59:46.140]  We are now into the fourth and final hour of this Tuesday, 9th of September, 2008 edition.
[2:59:46.140 --> 2:59:56.140]  Coming up, we're going to talk to Greg Pound, who had his children kidnapped by the eugenics services, child pervert services,
[2:59:56.140 --> 3:00:06.140]  the CPS, who lawlessly have kidnapped over a million children a year, recap his story, amazing story, and some new developments.
[3:00:06.140 --> 3:00:10.140]  The next 30 minutes, I want to cover some of the news we've been going over, and I haven't gotten to yet,
[3:00:10.140 --> 3:00:14.140]  and continue with your phone calls, Alex, Richard, Helen, John, and many others.
[3:00:14.140 --> 3:00:19.140]  For those that are just now watching live on PrisonPlanet.tv and over the web,
[3:00:19.140 --> 3:00:24.140]  we were just talking, we had Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy at the Treasury on.
[3:00:24.140 --> 3:00:33.140]  He said he believes the Freddie and Fannie bailout may actually make the whole government unsolvent, insolvent, and the Treasury.
[3:00:33.140 --> 3:00:39.140]  And then when I was talking to Joe and Philly, who is a regulator out of work regulator,
[3:00:39.140 --> 3:00:46.140]  and he needed for those the last few years, who was talking about exactly why all this happened,
[3:00:46.140 --> 3:00:52.140]  Joe finishing up, where do you see this going, A, and B, what do other regulators you talk to?
[3:00:52.140 --> 3:00:54.140]  What are they saying about this?
[3:00:54.140 --> 3:00:59.140]  You know, Dr. Roberts herself, the mainstream news admits this is all a Ponzi scheme,
[3:00:59.140 --> 3:01:05.140]  with bundling all these junk securities, and then selling the fraud to other people,
[3:01:05.140 --> 3:01:09.140]  and then selling it back to themselves, and then leveraging it over and over again,
[3:01:09.140 --> 3:01:14.140]  and just Ponzi scheme inside of Ponzi scheme.
[3:01:14.140 --> 3:01:18.140]  Okay, so here's what the bottom line is.
[3:01:18.140 --> 3:01:26.140]  It was always implied in the international markets that Fannie and Freddie were implicitly guaranteed by the government.
[3:01:26.140 --> 3:01:32.140]  Had the bonds gone into default, these are international contracts, the bonds are international contracts,
[3:01:32.140 --> 3:01:38.140]  then it would compromise the very nature of selling any bonds from the U.S.
[3:01:38.140 --> 3:01:44.140]  In other words, it would have brought down the whole system because nobody would have believed in the value of the bonds.
[3:01:44.140 --> 3:01:51.140]  Yeah, so we're talking about being on the verge every month now with some new crisis of a total depression.
[3:01:51.140 --> 3:01:53.140]  It's a double-edged sword.
[3:01:53.140 --> 3:01:58.140]  They had to imply, but they did imply, and in fact they did make the guarantee this weekend,
[3:01:58.140 --> 3:02:06.140]  by taking over the guarantee of that debt, which is roughly $5 trillion.
[3:02:06.140 --> 3:02:09.140]  Now, keep in mind that the government doesn't own the debt.
[3:02:09.140 --> 3:02:17.140]  The bondholders own the debt, but the government is now making the guarantee on that debt.
[3:02:17.140 --> 3:02:23.140]  It's like an FDIC $100,000 guarantee, but more, they're saying, we're going to back that up.
[3:02:23.140 --> 3:02:27.140]  That's right, they're backing up $5 trillion more of it.
[3:02:27.140 --> 3:02:33.140]  And the whole economy is a couple trillion a year, but go ahead.
[3:02:33.140 --> 3:02:34.140]  That's correct.
[3:02:34.140 --> 3:02:40.140]  So basically, they've just taken on $5 trillion more worth of guarantees on bonds,
[3:02:40.140 --> 3:02:44.140]  which does in fact compromise the treasuries.
[3:02:44.140 --> 3:02:52.140]  Because now you're talking about the treasury market as well as the Fannie Mae Freddie Mac aggregate bond issuance.
[3:02:52.140 --> 3:02:55.140]  So where do you see this going?
[3:02:55.140 --> 3:03:01.140]  Well, I pretty much take Dr. Roberts' point of view, as well as your point of view,
[3:03:01.140 --> 3:03:06.140]  that they can only prop up the Ponzi scheme so long.
[3:03:06.140 --> 3:03:12.140]  Now, what happens to all the bankers and the shareholders and the establishment people who bought railroads and land
[3:03:12.140 --> 3:03:16.140]  and resorts and gold mines and chateaus with this?
[3:03:16.140 --> 3:03:21.140]  I mean, what happens to them because they knew what they were doing the whole time,
[3:03:21.140 --> 3:03:26.140]  and I believe they've engineered this for a global collapse, then they'll pose as the saviors again
[3:03:26.140 --> 3:03:31.140]  and bring us into an even bigger Ponzi scheme with global carbon taxes, as they've said.
[3:03:31.140 --> 3:03:37.140]  Or as a regulator, do you think they just had hubris and got greedy?
[3:03:37.140 --> 3:03:39.140]  They had hubris and got greedy.
[3:03:39.140 --> 3:03:41.140]  Which is even scarier.
[3:03:41.140 --> 3:03:47.140]  I don't think they actually thought that the whole system would come down as fast as it would.
[3:03:47.140 --> 3:03:54.140]  So this is a replay of what we saw with One Broker's firm in 99 just 100 times bigger?
[3:03:54.140 --> 3:03:56.140]  Oh, this is huge.
[3:03:56.140 --> 3:04:03.140]  This is huge because when you look at the trade deficits, and Dr. Roberts has gotten into this before,
[3:04:03.140 --> 3:04:14.140]  we don't have an ability to shrink or to pay off that deficit, let alone our own public debt.
[3:04:14.140 --> 3:04:20.140]  You know what, I'm going to skip this break because I want to get to all the other callers and we have a guest coming up.
[3:04:20.140 --> 3:04:24.140]  For prisonplanet.tv viewers and infoworks.com stream listeners, we'll continue.
[3:04:24.140 --> 3:04:26.140]  For everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes.
[3:04:26.140 --> 3:04:29.140]  Stay with us and stay there, Joe.
[3:04:29.140 --> 3:04:37.140]  Okay, Joe, I mean, I know my basic facts on this, but it's clear that you know what you're talking about here.
[3:04:37.140 --> 3:04:41.140]  In three minutes that we've gotten this little behind the scenes segment that a lot of folks are watching,
[3:04:41.140 --> 3:04:47.140]  finish up your point of where you think this is going, how people could protect themselves,
[3:04:47.140 --> 3:04:52.140]  or any other ideas you've got personally.
[3:04:52.140 --> 3:05:03.140]  Well, I've been listening to you for about two years, and I actually pretty much agree with you wholeheartedly that this is a manipulation.
[3:05:03.140 --> 3:05:12.140]  But under the Anglo-American Empire, and that they very much intend to implode the entire system.
[3:05:12.140 --> 3:05:28.140]  Because basically from poverty, you can rise a very menacing, tyrannical fascist, global type of management.
[3:05:28.140 --> 3:05:31.140]  Because people who are desperate will do anything.
[3:05:31.140 --> 3:05:38.140]  And you see them gearing up for the new jobs to be police checkpoints, surveillance, military, yeah, they're doing it.
[3:05:38.140 --> 3:05:45.140]  Oh, no, this is definitely, this is definitely, this is definitely fascism before feudalism.
[3:05:45.140 --> 3:05:53.140]  Wow, that's well put. Fascism to feudalism. Fascism is the path to their global feudal state.
[3:05:53.140 --> 3:06:00.140]  That's correct. Fascism to feudalism. They need the fascist reality to create the feudalistic reality.
[3:06:00.140 --> 3:06:09.140]  Well, I really agree with you, Joe, and I, the good news is people aren't buying their bull anymore.
[3:06:09.140 --> 3:06:16.140]  But I think that they're Straussian, and so they're the school of dictates, you know, the dictator makes right.
[3:06:16.140 --> 3:06:20.140]  And so they're kind of saying, we don't care if you don't like it, we're just going to kill you.
[3:06:20.140 --> 3:06:22.140]  That's correct, they're full of hubris.
[3:06:22.140 --> 3:06:23.140]  Yeah.
[3:06:23.140 --> 3:06:28.140]  They don't care what you think, because they believe that they possess the power.
[3:06:28.140 --> 3:06:34.140]  So I have a little kind of metaphysical expression.
[3:06:34.140 --> 3:06:39.140]  Hubris is a paradox. Those who possess it don't realize what they are.
[3:06:39.140 --> 3:06:44.140]  Well, I don't see things going well for them.
[3:06:44.140 --> 3:06:52.140]  In fact, when we talk to many other economists that come on, they believe, like Bob Chapman,
[3:06:52.140 --> 3:06:58.140]  that they meant to do the implosion later, but that this came too soon, that they're not ready.
[3:06:58.140 --> 3:07:03.140]  I agree with that. That is correct. It's come sooner than they thought it would.
[3:07:03.140 --> 3:07:09.140]  You know, people think that they're calculating, and they are incredibly ruthless and calculating,
[3:07:09.140 --> 3:07:16.140]  but they simply didn't see how quickly they had taken down the system.
[3:07:16.140 --> 3:07:17.140]  And now it's coming down.
[3:07:17.140 --> 3:07:20.140]  So they did too good a job.
[3:07:20.140 --> 3:07:25.140]  Well, I think that people of hubris simply can't see reality.
[3:07:25.140 --> 3:07:31.140]  I mean, people at the top of the food chain think that, you know, even people with a couple million dollars...
[3:07:31.140 --> 3:07:34.140]  Stay there. Let's finish up with you. Stay there. Here we go.
[3:07:34.140 --> 3:07:50.140]  Fascinating call with Joe of Regulator. And he was talking about feudalism, a little behind-the-scenes segment, fascism to feudalism,
[3:07:50.140 --> 3:07:54.140]  and how they're blinded by the hubris. They may be intelligent, they may have their program running,
[3:07:54.140 --> 3:08:00.140]  but they're not seeing just how serious it is, what they're creating.
[3:08:00.140 --> 3:08:04.140]  Finish up your point on that.
[3:08:04.140 --> 3:08:18.140]  Well, I mean, I think even people with a couple million dollars in the bank think that they're somehow going to escape reality.
[3:08:18.140 --> 3:08:27.140]  That is until everything comes crashing down, and then they're going to be as impoverished as everybody else.
[3:08:27.140 --> 3:08:31.140]  What's scary is I can have the head of the New York Business School on.
[3:08:31.140 --> 3:08:34.140]  I can have Joseph Sticklitz on the prize winner. I can have Dr. Roberts on.
[3:08:34.140 --> 3:08:43.140]  I can have economists, historians, you know, economic historians, and they say they've never seen something this bad coming,
[3:08:43.140 --> 3:08:49.140]  and no one sees any way out of it except, I think, World War III, which is even worse.
[3:08:49.140 --> 3:08:54.140]  And you've got the government running around saying, we have super weapons, we're invincible,
[3:08:54.140 --> 3:08:58.140]  and we're seeing a pathology we witnessed before.
[3:08:58.140 --> 3:09:07.140]  Well, I agree with that analysis, is that to divert the ignorant populace from the economic realities,
[3:09:07.140 --> 3:09:10.140]  they're going to create wars, more wars.
[3:09:10.140 --> 3:09:16.140]  What do other regulators and people that are in the economic structure, you know,
[3:09:16.140 --> 3:09:20.140]  studying it, looking at it, watching it, trying to control it, what are they saying?
[3:09:20.140 --> 3:09:24.140]  Do they see what's happening, or are they drinking Kool-Aid?
[3:09:24.140 --> 3:09:31.140]  Well, you have to realize that these people make, you know, I was one of the few people who spoke out against it from the beginning,
[3:09:31.140 --> 3:09:35.140]  and as a result, I've been harassed for 15 years.
[3:09:35.140 --> 3:09:42.140]  But I think that, you know, they're willing to tow the line because they, you know,
[3:09:42.140 --> 3:09:45.140]  they get to put their food on the table.
[3:09:45.140 --> 3:09:50.140]  So they tow the line, and that's part of the whole corruption within the whole system.
[3:09:50.140 --> 3:09:55.140]  Well, I mean, they're still delusionally on most of the financial news saying the worst is over.
[3:09:55.140 --> 3:09:57.140]  They've been saying that for a year.
[3:09:57.140 --> 3:09:58.140]  Well, that's a joke.
[3:09:58.140 --> 3:09:59.140]  Yeah.
[3:09:59.140 --> 3:10:04.140]  I mean, you know, we're talking about Fannie and Freddie just going into receivership.
[3:10:04.140 --> 3:10:13.140]  I mean, these are the two, these are two of the largest financial institutions in the world,
[3:10:13.140 --> 3:10:16.140]  with the debt that they've issued.
[3:10:16.140 --> 3:10:25.140]  So how anyone could say that we're not in a recession, how anyone can say that everything is fine and dandy is delusional.
[3:10:25.140 --> 3:10:27.140]  In fact, I think they're beyond delusional.
[3:10:27.140 --> 3:10:28.140]  I think they're demented.
[3:10:28.140 --> 3:10:29.140]  Well, I agree with you.
[3:10:29.140 --> 3:10:33.140]  But then you look at, say, cross-PCs, gene splashed, they change.
[3:10:33.140 --> 3:10:38.140]  One gene that makes a tomato taste better last longer, it randomly changes thousands of others,
[3:10:38.140 --> 3:10:43.140]  always creates new amino acids that are horribly toxic to us.
[3:10:43.140 --> 3:10:44.140]  They know that's happening.
[3:10:44.140 --> 3:10:45.140]  They don't care.
[3:10:45.140 --> 3:10:46.140]  They put it on the table.
[3:10:46.140 --> 3:10:47.140]  They know them.
[3:10:47.140 --> 3:10:48.140]  Correct.
[3:10:48.140 --> 3:10:54.140]  Because in their mind of hubris, they believe that they're playing the role of God.
[3:10:54.140 --> 3:10:57.140]  And when you study elites, they always start thinking they're God.
[3:10:57.140 --> 3:10:59.140]  I don't understand this.
[3:10:59.140 --> 3:11:07.140]  I mean, you know, it certainly, you know, certainly Hitler was insane.
[3:11:07.140 --> 3:11:13.140]  I think anyone who would study Hitler would think that he is insane.
[3:11:13.140 --> 3:11:19.140]  And I would certainly say that the elites of the United States of America today,
[3:11:19.140 --> 3:11:26.140]  or really what I would consider the Anglo-American Empire, these people are insane.
[3:11:26.140 --> 3:11:28.140]  No, they really are insane.
[3:11:28.140 --> 3:11:30.140]  I mean, they scientifically know what they're doing.
[3:11:30.140 --> 3:11:31.140]  But it's crazy.
[3:11:31.140 --> 3:11:33.140]  It's like, okay, you know how to do this.
[3:11:33.140 --> 3:11:39.140]  Why are you, I mean, launching sneak attacks on Russia and then being so arrogant as to
[3:11:39.140 --> 3:11:41.140]  tell the public, Russia did it?
[3:11:41.140 --> 3:11:44.140]  I mean, there's new levels of lying is what I'm saying.
[3:11:44.140 --> 3:11:53.140]  New levels of deception that are just so off the charts, you know, is the word to use.
[3:11:53.140 --> 3:11:55.140]  And God help us.
[3:11:55.140 --> 3:11:57.140]  Well, listen, it was good talking to you, Joe.
[3:11:57.140 --> 3:11:59.140]  I appreciate your input.
[3:11:59.140 --> 3:12:02.140]  Very interesting talking to Joe there from Philly.
[3:12:02.140 --> 3:12:03.140]  Even Connecticut.
[3:12:03.140 --> 3:12:04.140]  You're on the air.
[3:12:04.140 --> 3:12:05.140]  Go ahead, Alex.
[3:12:05.140 --> 3:12:06.140]  How you doing?
[3:12:06.140 --> 3:12:07.140]  Hi.
[3:12:07.140 --> 3:12:08.140]  Hey, Alex.
[3:12:08.140 --> 3:12:09.140]  How you doing?
[3:12:09.140 --> 3:12:10.140]  Good, sir.
[3:12:10.140 --> 3:12:11.140]  Good.
[3:12:11.140 --> 3:12:13.140]  This is a little off-talk, but I just want to let you know I've been airing, truth-riding,
[3:12:13.140 --> 3:12:18.140]  like crazy to prepare, try to get people awake for the coming day here.
[3:12:18.140 --> 3:12:21.140]  So, in your parish on Access TV?
[3:12:21.140 --> 3:12:22.140]  Oh, yeah.
[3:12:22.140 --> 3:12:26.140]  Over and up in my town.
[3:12:26.140 --> 3:12:33.140]  But I just found out that I wanted your opinion on this, if I should do this.
[3:12:33.140 --> 3:12:35.140]  They're having, like, a 9-11 dedication.
[3:12:35.140 --> 3:12:41.140]  I guess one of the people here in my town, their husband died on the World Trade Center.
[3:12:41.140 --> 3:12:44.140]  And I saw, it's like a gymnasium.
[3:12:44.140 --> 3:12:46.140]  They're rededicating, I guess.
[3:12:46.140 --> 3:12:47.140]  Joey Rel is going to be there.
[3:12:47.140 --> 3:12:49.140]  Senator Chris Dodd.
[3:12:49.140 --> 3:12:50.140]  Larson is going to be there.
[3:12:50.140 --> 3:12:51.140]  Pour all his money into it.
[3:12:51.140 --> 3:12:54.140]  And I saw they have a beam on there and everything.
[3:12:54.140 --> 3:12:57.140]  I was wondering, is it a good event to go there?
[3:12:57.140 --> 3:12:59.140]  There's going to be 5,000 people there.
[3:12:59.140 --> 3:13:00.140]  It's open to the public.
[3:13:00.140 --> 3:13:01.140]  Yes.
[3:13:01.140 --> 3:13:03.140]  I just don't know if I should mention, hey, 9-11 is inside.
[3:13:03.140 --> 3:13:04.140]  I've got to wear t-shirts and crap.
[3:13:04.140 --> 3:13:06.140]  This is what you should do.
[3:13:06.140 --> 3:13:12.140]  The media try, the control corporate Pentagon media, that's what they literally are, with
[3:13:12.140 --> 3:13:15.140]  all their fake brands of liberal conservative, whatever.
[3:13:15.140 --> 3:13:19.140]  They give you different flavors of the Kool-Aid at the Jonestown Massacre.
[3:13:19.140 --> 3:13:26.140]  What they do is, they say, the victims' families hate 9-11 truthers.
[3:13:26.140 --> 3:13:27.140]  They're angry.
[3:13:27.140 --> 3:13:33.140]  But then when you talk to 9-11 families, and I've had some of the biggest, in fact, I've
[3:13:33.140 --> 3:13:38.140]  had the biggest group on their head, Bill Doyle, Austin's son Joey, he said more than half of
[3:13:38.140 --> 3:13:40.140]  his members believe it's an inside job.
[3:13:40.140 --> 3:13:42.140]  He believes it's an inside job.
[3:13:42.140 --> 3:13:48.140]  9-11 victims within one year stood around the White House in a ring.
[3:13:48.140 --> 3:13:53.140]  Several thousand holding hands saying Bush did it, Bush knew.
[3:13:53.140 --> 3:13:58.140]  And so, again, another lie, another hoax that the families get mad, the families get angry.
[3:13:58.140 --> 3:14:07.140]  Now, that said, there is no better way to honor someone who was wrongfully murdered and whose
[3:14:07.140 --> 3:14:12.140]  murderers have not been brought to justice than to go to their memorial where you've got
[3:14:12.140 --> 3:14:18.140]  evil government and corporate chiefs using their courage, using their murder, using the
[3:14:18.140 --> 3:14:25.140]  person that died's image next to the memorial, next to a picture of them to create emotion.
[3:14:25.140 --> 3:14:32.140]  And while the people are looking at the screen and having, or are looking at the stage, but
[3:14:32.140 --> 3:14:37.140]  they'll also be watching it on TV, looking at the screen, they will associate those senators,
[3:14:37.140 --> 3:14:43.140]  those business leaders with the fallen and with the courage of the firefighters and police
[3:14:43.140 --> 3:14:45.140]  and emergency workers.
[3:14:45.140 --> 3:14:47.140]  And so, it's a reflected glow.
[3:14:47.140 --> 3:14:52.140]  They bask in it when it's their system that committed the attacks.
[3:14:52.140 --> 3:14:55.140]  So, and that's what Hitler did when he firebombed his own Reichstag.
[3:14:55.140 --> 3:14:57.140]  So, it's the same thing over and over again.
[3:14:57.140 --> 3:15:02.140]  So, I would burn a bunch of copies of Terror Storm.
[3:15:02.140 --> 3:15:06.140]  I think Terror Storm Final Cut, the second edition is what it is, but it's the final cut.
[3:15:06.140 --> 3:15:09.140]  It is the best 9-11 film out there.
[3:15:09.140 --> 3:15:12.140]  It covers the history of Terror and then how they did it on 9-11 and Building 7 and the
[3:15:12.140 --> 3:15:15.140]  rest of it and the fall start news reporting.
[3:15:15.140 --> 3:15:21.140]  And then, I would go to Kinko's and print up a flyer that just says, you know, defend
[3:15:21.140 --> 3:15:22.140]  the memory of the victims.
[3:15:22.140 --> 3:15:25.140]  Don't let their loss be used for a police state in wars.
[3:15:25.140 --> 3:15:28.140]  Our government states terror attacks more than 200 times.
[3:15:28.140 --> 3:15:29.140]  It's not our government.
[3:15:29.140 --> 3:15:31.140]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[3:15:31.140 --> 3:15:36.140]  Go watch Terror Storm on Google for free, Google Terror Storm.
[3:15:36.140 --> 3:15:42.140]  I mean, to make 500 copies of that and to go and hand those out would just cost you,
[3:15:42.140 --> 3:15:46.140]  you know, 15 bucks, 10 bucks, whatever the printer cost at Kinko's or whatever.
[3:15:46.140 --> 3:15:48.140]  So, that's the cheapest thing.
[3:15:48.140 --> 3:15:52.140]  If you have the money and friends, you know, I'd have a backpack and hand them out and
[3:15:52.140 --> 3:15:53.140]  I would just be nice.
[3:15:53.140 --> 3:15:54.140]  Hey, check it out.
[3:15:54.140 --> 3:15:55.140]  It deals with the attacks.
[3:15:55.140 --> 3:15:57.140]  It deals with the first responders.
[3:15:57.140 --> 3:16:00.140]  You know, it's for their memory and I would be respectful and nice.
[3:16:00.140 --> 3:16:01.140]  Well, yeah, of course.
[3:16:01.140 --> 3:16:03.140]  I would have a bullhorn in your car, though.
[3:16:03.140 --> 3:16:06.140]  And if they get rude or pushy with you, you pull it out.
[3:16:06.140 --> 3:16:07.140]  But just be careful.
[3:16:07.140 --> 3:16:08.140]  Yeah, I don't.
[3:16:08.140 --> 3:16:10.140]  Yeah, that's what I just wanted to know.
[3:16:10.140 --> 3:16:12.140]  See, the system, it's a sacrament.
[3:16:12.140 --> 3:16:17.140]  You know, to the corrupt police, corrupt government, it's a sick sacrament of their worship.
[3:16:17.140 --> 3:16:20.140]  They hold out whoever died and said, see, we're heroes.
[3:16:20.140 --> 3:16:23.140]  See, we, us abusing you is a good thing.
[3:16:23.140 --> 3:16:24.140]  We take care of you.
[3:16:24.140 --> 3:16:25.140]  It's a sick sacrament.
[3:16:25.140 --> 3:16:31.140]  So they get upset by a slave coming to a public event that's to teach you to worship government.
[3:16:31.140 --> 3:16:33.140]  That's a temple of worship to government and evil.
[3:16:33.140 --> 3:16:37.140]  So they don't want you at the temple where they're murdering that person that was killed
[3:16:37.140 --> 3:16:44.140]  again and using their death again as a recreation of their supping, their black Sabbath.
[3:16:44.140 --> 3:16:51.140]  Now, also, if I could, the lady, she lives in my town, would it be better to maybe try
[3:16:51.140 --> 3:16:53.140]  to get a hold of her before all this happens?
[3:16:53.140 --> 3:16:55.140]  No, they'll probably horn in on you.
[3:16:55.140 --> 3:16:57.140]  Oh, you mean the lady who lost her husband?
[3:16:57.140 --> 3:17:01.140]  Yeah, because I guess you put in a lot of money into this gymnasium, too.
[3:17:01.140 --> 3:17:05.140]  And, uh, and then I guess the, uh, the Rojo de Real and Larson and all of them, they put
[3:17:05.140 --> 3:17:06.140]  a lot of money into it.
[3:17:06.140 --> 3:17:09.140]  No, they might, they might, listen, they might flip out on you.
[3:17:09.140 --> 3:17:10.140]  It's your first amendment, right?
[3:17:10.140 --> 3:17:11.140]  It's open to the public.
[3:17:11.140 --> 3:17:16.140]  Just go and say, hey, information, information, information about those who were killed and
[3:17:16.140 --> 3:17:21.140]  bringing, you know, and they ask you say, I'm here to ask why Ben Laden hasn't been indicted
[3:17:21.140 --> 3:17:27.140]  for this, but he has for the USS Cole and the Tanzanian bombings, you know, and just,
[3:17:27.140 --> 3:17:29.140]  and just, and just say, interesting information.
[3:17:29.140 --> 3:17:30.140]  Oh yeah.
[3:17:30.140 --> 3:17:31.140]  And they say, no solicitation.
[3:17:31.140 --> 3:17:33.140]  Say, it's not, it's my first amendment.
[3:17:33.140 --> 3:17:38.140]  And then if it's some little petty bureaucrat, you know, he's totally bought them to the
[3:17:38.140 --> 3:17:39.140]  lie.
[3:17:39.140 --> 3:17:41.140]  Their subconscious knows the truth, totally freaked out.
[3:17:41.140 --> 3:17:44.140]  So they burrow into the lie even more and then they're wanting to start a fight with
[3:17:44.140 --> 3:17:46.140]  you and then you shove you or something.
[3:17:46.140 --> 3:17:49.140]  Come on, do something so we can kill you and the cops are behind them.
[3:17:49.140 --> 3:17:50.140]  Do something so we can get you.
[3:17:50.140 --> 3:17:51.140]  We're just waiting.
[3:17:51.140 --> 3:17:55.140]  You know, just kind of go, okay, thank you and then go off somewhere else.
[3:17:55.140 --> 3:17:57.140]  But I mean, you shouldn't have a problem.
[3:17:57.140 --> 3:17:58.140]  They'll probably go well for you.
[3:17:58.140 --> 3:18:00.140]  They'll probably run into folks that agree with you there.
[3:18:00.140 --> 3:18:01.140]  Yeah.
[3:18:01.140 --> 3:18:02.140]  I thought it was kind of funny.
[3:18:02.140 --> 3:18:05.140]  Jody's actually in the film clandestinely next to Arnold.
[3:18:05.140 --> 3:18:08.140]  I was like, whoa, that was kind of funny.
[3:18:08.140 --> 3:18:11.140]  But yeah, truth rising where Schwarzenegger gets confronted.
[3:18:11.140 --> 3:18:12.140]  Thank you so much.
[3:18:12.140 --> 3:18:13.140]  Yeah, truth rising.
[3:18:13.140 --> 3:18:14.140]  Such an amazing film, folks.
[3:18:14.140 --> 3:18:15.140]  You got to get it.
[3:18:15.140 --> 3:18:18.140]  I'm going to go to a call right now and then we'll go over into the break with that caller.
[3:18:18.140 --> 3:18:21.140]  That was Alex Richard in Texas.
[3:18:21.140 --> 3:18:23.140]  You're on the air, Richard.
[3:18:23.140 --> 3:18:24.140]  Hello.
[3:18:24.140 --> 3:18:25.140]  Hello, Richard.
[3:18:25.140 --> 3:18:26.140]  How's it going?
[3:18:26.140 --> 3:18:27.140]  Good.
[3:18:27.140 --> 3:18:30.140]  Back to the weapons that we have.
[3:18:30.140 --> 3:18:32.140]  There's a weapon called the mayhem.
[3:18:32.140 --> 3:18:39.140]  M-A-H-E-M, which is an acronym for magneto hydrodynamic explosive munition, which is,
[3:18:39.140 --> 3:18:45.140]  they put it into plane basically and it's this huge, I just typed it.
[3:18:45.140 --> 3:18:46.140]  I just typed in weapons.
[3:18:46.140 --> 3:18:49.140]  That's the one that sucks the air out of your lungs?
[3:18:49.140 --> 3:18:50.140]  I think so, yeah.
[3:18:50.140 --> 3:18:52.140]  It was a huge description along with-
[3:18:52.140 --> 3:18:54.140]  It's a fuel air bomb, yeah.
[3:18:54.140 --> 3:18:55.140]  But see, that's not secret.
[3:18:55.140 --> 3:18:59.140]  You know, they're saying it's a secret super weapon.
[3:18:59.140 --> 3:19:07.140]  Well, another thing, I sent a couple of links to you under my space of Russia building pyramids
[3:19:07.140 --> 3:19:13.140]  that they say the secret power of pyramids is to make people less harmful and less agitated
[3:19:13.140 --> 3:19:16.140]  when they're building pyramids all over Russia.
[3:19:16.140 --> 3:19:18.140]  They've done scientific studies.
[3:19:18.140 --> 3:19:20.140]  Also, they have a lot of-
[3:19:20.140 --> 3:19:21.140]  No, no.
[3:19:21.140 --> 3:19:22.140]  All these governments are into the occult.
[3:19:22.140 --> 3:19:23.140]  I have seen that.
[3:19:23.140 --> 3:19:25.140]  The government's building pyramids and having massive reading programs.
[3:19:25.140 --> 3:19:26.140]  Stay there.
[3:19:26.140 --> 3:19:27.140]  We're going to keep talking right now.
[3:19:27.140 --> 3:19:30.140]  Behind the scenes at infowars.com.
[3:19:30.140 --> 3:19:31.140]  Okay.
[3:19:31.140 --> 3:19:34.140]  Continue with what you were saying there, Richard.
[3:19:34.140 --> 3:19:35.140]  Right.
[3:19:35.140 --> 3:19:42.140]  Also, there's a video on, I saw it on Russia today in the newspaper there, but a video
[3:19:42.140 --> 3:19:47.140]  of a Georgian troop firing on all the houses.
[3:19:47.140 --> 3:19:48.140]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[3:19:48.140 --> 3:19:49.140]  We posted it.
[3:19:49.140 --> 3:19:50.140]  Oh, awesome.
[3:19:50.140 --> 3:19:52.140]  But I'm just backing you up that I've seen the video.
[3:19:52.140 --> 3:19:53.140]  I wasn't like, I've seen that.
[3:19:53.140 --> 3:19:54.140]  Yeah, so well.
[3:19:54.140 --> 3:19:55.140]  Well, yeah.
[3:19:55.140 --> 3:19:57.140]  I'm just saying, I agree with you.
[3:19:57.140 --> 3:19:58.140]  Yeah.
[3:19:58.140 --> 3:19:59.140]  And there's something else.
[3:19:59.140 --> 3:20:04.140]  Oh, the street named after President Bush in Georgia.
[3:20:04.140 --> 3:20:05.140]  Are you kidding?
[3:20:05.140 --> 3:20:08.140]  They have giant pictures of him on buildings there.
[3:20:08.140 --> 3:20:09.140]  Yeah.
[3:20:09.140 --> 3:20:10.140]  Same thing in Albania.
[3:20:10.140 --> 3:20:11.140]  Yeah.
[3:20:11.140 --> 3:20:13.140]  Just totally brainwashed slaves.
[3:20:13.140 --> 3:20:14.140]  They love it.
[3:20:14.140 --> 3:20:15.140]  Astonine.
[3:20:15.140 --> 3:20:16.140]  Love the show, Alex Mann.
[3:20:16.140 --> 3:20:18.140]  Prison Planet TV, too.
[3:20:18.140 --> 3:20:19.140]  New viewer there.
[3:20:19.140 --> 3:20:20.140]  It's excellent.
[3:20:20.140 --> 3:20:21.140]  Thank you, my friend.
[3:20:21.140 --> 3:20:22.140]  Appreciate the support.
[3:20:22.140 --> 3:20:23.140]  Yeah.
[3:20:23.140 --> 3:20:25.140]  Prisonplanet.tv, fabled enemies.
[3:20:25.140 --> 3:20:28.140]  Also, my new film, Truth Rising up there right now, folks.
[3:20:28.140 --> 3:20:33.140]  If you're an activist, you can go there and burn DVD copies, you know, to disk.
[3:20:33.140 --> 3:20:35.140]  They play on most DVD players and hand those out.
[3:20:35.140 --> 3:20:38.140]  And just tell them, if it doesn't blow on your DVD player, it'll play on your computer.
[3:20:38.140 --> 3:20:39.140]  Key information.
[3:20:39.140 --> 3:20:41.140]  Tell me them.
[3:20:41.140 --> 3:20:42.140]  Shocking info.
[3:20:42.140 --> 3:20:44.140]  It's telling me, this fights al-Qaeda.
[3:20:44.140 --> 3:20:45.140]  Fight al-Qaeda.
[3:20:45.140 --> 3:20:46.140]  Fight al-Qaeda.
[3:20:46.140 --> 3:20:47.140]  And it will.
[3:20:47.140 --> 3:20:48.140]  It'll expose al-CIA to.
[3:20:48.140 --> 3:20:50.140]  So say, hey, this video is about fighting al-Qaeda.
[3:20:50.140 --> 3:20:53.140]  You know, if you've got neocons and they'll go, oh, good.
[3:20:53.140 --> 3:20:55.140]  I fight al-Qaeda.
[3:20:55.140 --> 3:20:57.140]  Let's go ahead and it's true.
[3:20:57.140 --> 3:20:58.140]  They'll be fighting their bosses.
[3:20:58.140 --> 3:21:01.140]  They'll learn how their bosses did it and run al-Qaeda.
[3:21:01.140 --> 3:21:04.140]  Let's go ahead and talk to Helen in Florida.
[3:21:04.140 --> 3:21:06.140]  Helen, thank you for holding her on the air worldwide.
[3:21:06.140 --> 3:21:07.140]  Yes, Alex.
[3:21:07.140 --> 3:21:12.140]  First of all, everybody's born in the divine ingrained instincts to seek truth and goodness,
[3:21:12.140 --> 3:21:14.140]  your will and your intellect.
[3:21:14.140 --> 3:21:20.140]  But then the real problem is when Peter Spensky says in the Church of McKenna, all advanced
[3:21:20.140 --> 3:21:21.140]  problems rise to duality.
[3:21:21.140 --> 3:21:23.140]  It's ego versus the soul.
[3:21:23.140 --> 3:21:25.140]  So even Hitler, his ego took over.
[3:21:25.140 --> 3:21:27.140]  But another important good point I want to hear.
[3:21:27.140 --> 3:21:34.140]  I heard last evening that Collif Montana said that Ron Paul is on the ballot.
[3:21:34.140 --> 3:21:40.140]  Because I guess Bob Barr and others, the lesser parties, are getting together to put Ron Paul
[3:21:40.140 --> 3:21:41.140]  on the ballot.
[3:21:41.140 --> 3:21:45.140]  I talked to a gentleman today from Minnesota and he said he wrote in Ron Paul.
[3:21:45.140 --> 3:21:48.140]  I'm glad you bring this up and I appreciate your call.
[3:21:48.140 --> 3:21:55.140]  There is a big announcement supposedly coming from Bob Barr, Chuck Baldwin, and Ron Paul
[3:21:55.140 --> 3:21:57.140]  tomorrow.
[3:21:57.140 --> 3:22:01.140]  And Ron Paul said he would not run unless it was on the Republican ticket.
[3:22:01.140 --> 3:22:05.140]  But is Chuck Baldwin going to step down tomorrow?
[3:22:05.140 --> 3:22:07.140]  I meant to get to this.
[3:22:07.140 --> 3:22:11.140]  We need an article about this on infowars.com.
[3:22:11.140 --> 3:22:15.140]  Is Chuck Baldwin going to step down?
[3:22:15.140 --> 3:22:24.140]  Is Chuck Baldwin going to step down or, because I don't see Bob Barr stepping down, will his
[3:22:24.140 --> 3:22:26.140]  VP be Ron Paul?
[3:22:26.140 --> 3:22:28.140]  Bob Barr and Ron Paul.
[3:22:28.140 --> 3:22:29.140]  That's what's being said.
[3:22:29.140 --> 3:22:32.140]  I'm not saying that's going to happen tomorrow.
[3:22:32.140 --> 3:22:35.140]  I'm not saying that's going to be the case.
[3:22:35.140 --> 3:22:39.140]  It could be there announcing that Ron Paul could be a stunt.
[3:22:39.140 --> 3:22:43.140]  Ron Paul will be an advisor to the campaign.
[3:22:43.140 --> 3:22:52.140]  Ron Paul is throwing the Ron Paul Revolution support behind the Bob Barr, Chuck Baldwin
[3:22:52.140 --> 3:22:53.140]  campaign.
[3:22:53.140 --> 3:22:59.140]  Ron Paul is going to be in the cabinet, which is really the same thing as saying he's throwing
[3:22:59.140 --> 3:23:00.140]  a support behind it.
[3:23:00.140 --> 3:23:06.140]  He will be in the cabinet or he will be Treasury Secretary or he will be Secretary of Defense
[3:23:06.140 --> 3:23:07.140]  or something.
[3:23:07.140 --> 3:23:14.140]  If Chuck Baldwin and Bob Barr win, that's probably what you're going to hear.
[3:23:14.140 --> 3:23:18.140]  It is going to be a bombshell off the charts.
[3:23:18.140 --> 3:23:23.140]  Maybe they announced that Chuck Baldwin stepping down and that Ron Paul is going to be running
[3:23:23.140 --> 3:23:24.140]  with him.
[3:23:24.140 --> 3:23:26.140]  In fact, let me just plug them to the full audience that real quick and we'll go to some
[3:23:26.140 --> 3:23:27.140]  more calls.
[3:23:27.140 --> 3:23:28.140]  Stay with us.
[3:23:28.140 --> 3:23:56.140]  Yeah, I meant to get to this.
[3:23:56.140 --> 3:24:02.140]  Ron Paul is supposed to make some huge announcement tomorrow with Chuck Baldwin and the CIA guy,
[3:24:02.140 --> 3:24:05.140]  Bob Barr.
[3:24:05.140 --> 3:24:08.140]  Please help us, but it doesn't matter.
[3:24:08.140 --> 3:24:13.140]  I tell you, next to McCain and Obama, though, Bob Barr would be better.
[3:24:13.140 --> 3:24:17.140]  But let us not forget he's a pretty sneaky creature and has been on the show many times,
[3:24:17.140 --> 3:24:21.140]  has been refusing to come on the last few months with his presidential run.
[3:24:21.140 --> 3:24:23.140]  Because we want to grill Bob Barr here.
[3:24:23.140 --> 3:24:28.140]  But some are saying that Ron Paul is going to be running VP with Bob Barr and that Baldwin
[3:24:28.140 --> 3:24:29.140]  stepping down.
[3:24:29.140 --> 3:24:30.140]  I wouldn't look for that.
[3:24:30.140 --> 3:24:35.140]  I wouldn't look for the announcement that the Ron Paul revolution is throwing its weight
[3:24:35.140 --> 3:24:42.140]  behind Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin and that Ron Paul is going to ask the revolution to
[3:24:42.140 --> 3:24:47.140]  get behind them and that Ron Paul will be part of the cabinet when they're elected.
[3:24:47.140 --> 3:24:50.140]  Now, I'm predicting that will be the big announcement tomorrow.
[3:24:50.140 --> 3:24:51.140]  I have no inside knowledge.
[3:24:51.140 --> 3:24:54.140]  I heard something about this last week that they had some big announcement.
[3:24:54.140 --> 3:24:58.140]  I didn't even bother to call them because, frankly, we'll find out when it's announced.
[3:24:58.140 --> 3:24:59.140]  I don't have time for such things.
[3:24:59.140 --> 3:25:06.140]  I don't revel in knowing something others don't know because I want to know it to tell people.
[3:25:06.140 --> 3:25:09.140]  So what's the point of me knowing without other people knowing?
[3:25:09.140 --> 3:25:10.140]  I'm sure they'd tell me.
[3:25:10.140 --> 3:25:11.140]  They told me lots of stuff.
[3:25:11.140 --> 3:25:15.140]  But the point is, is that we'll find out tomorrow.
[3:25:15.140 --> 3:25:20.140]  And we need a little blurb up on Info Wars or Prison Planet about, hey, big announcement
[3:25:20.140 --> 3:25:21.140]  tomorrow.
[3:25:21.140 --> 3:25:25.140]  Alex thinks it's going to be this, but it could be that Ron Paul is running for president
[3:25:25.140 --> 3:25:26.140]  or vice president.
[3:25:26.140 --> 3:25:27.140]  That's an important discussion.
[3:25:27.140 --> 3:25:31.140]  And then we need a little blurblet, a little turblet, up on the site.
[3:25:31.140 --> 3:25:36.140]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[3:25:36.140 --> 3:25:38.140]  What's so many calls coming in?
[3:25:38.140 --> 3:25:40.140]  I can't keep track of all these.
[3:25:40.140 --> 3:25:43.140]  Let's go ahead and talk to Misty in North Carolina.
[3:25:43.140 --> 3:25:44.140]  You're on the air.
[3:25:44.140 --> 3:25:45.140]  She just dropped off.
[3:25:45.140 --> 3:25:46.140]  She just dropped off.
[3:25:46.140 --> 3:25:47.140]  Okay.
[3:25:47.140 --> 3:25:48.140]  Eddie in Cali.
[3:25:48.140 --> 3:25:50.140]  Hey, Alex.
[3:25:50.140 --> 3:25:51.140]  Hey, how you doing?
[3:25:51.140 --> 3:25:52.140]  I'm good.
[3:25:52.140 --> 3:25:53.140]  I'm good.
[3:25:53.140 --> 3:26:00.140]  I just wanted to talk to you about, I was in the Navy and when I found out what was going
[3:26:00.140 --> 3:26:04.940]  on, I actually asked my captain if he could let me out and he said, sure, you're a smart
[3:26:04.940 --> 3:26:05.940]  guy.
[3:26:05.940 --> 3:26:11.740]  And he actually signed me off the ship on a roll discharge.
[3:26:11.740 --> 3:26:18.740]  And it's the things that we have in the military.
[3:26:18.740 --> 3:26:26.300]  I mean, people don't believe it, but they have a lot of stuff for years and years that
[3:26:26.300 --> 3:26:27.460]  they don't make public.
[3:26:27.460 --> 3:26:34.620]  I know it's a master at arms, so I had high level clearance and I was actually able to
[3:26:34.620 --> 3:26:37.140]  see some of these things and know about them.
[3:26:37.140 --> 3:26:46.380]  And since Vietnam, they've had cameras that could pretty much tell what color your eyes
[3:26:46.380 --> 3:26:47.380]  are.
[3:26:47.380 --> 3:26:52.020]  And it's really amazing to me that no one would think that our military would be able
[3:26:52.020 --> 3:26:56.940]  to even find someone who's hiding in the cave with all the stuff they have.
[3:26:56.940 --> 3:27:01.820]  You're saying tell what color their eyes are when in the darker through walls?
[3:27:01.820 --> 3:27:08.380]  Well, I know that from high altitudes, but they've had those.
[3:27:08.380 --> 3:27:16.700]  Well, they admit they have live feed digital satellites, which the ground cameras track
[3:27:16.700 --> 3:27:22.460]  how you walk and then that's uploaded and then from above with that and your shadow,
[3:27:22.460 --> 3:27:23.620]  they know it's you.
[3:27:23.620 --> 3:27:27.100]  And that may be one of the secret weapons they're using, but go ahead.
[3:27:27.100 --> 3:27:28.100]  Absolutely.
[3:27:28.100 --> 3:27:36.100]  My grandfather was on the flight crew in the Navy in Vietnam, and he actually did fly
[3:27:36.100 --> 3:27:42.940]  over as reconnaissance and the moral is, though, the people know how to shoot straight
[3:27:42.940 --> 3:27:45.140]  and the people fight back.
[3:27:45.140 --> 3:27:46.700]  All those super weapons won't even help him.
[3:27:46.700 --> 3:27:48.500]  I appreciate your call.
[3:27:48.500 --> 3:27:50.780]  Let's go ahead and take another one here.
[3:27:50.780 --> 3:27:51.780]  Who's up next here?
[3:27:51.780 --> 3:27:53.540]  There's so many of these in Jeremy and Arkansas.
[3:27:53.540 --> 3:27:54.540]  Jeremy and Arkansas.
[3:27:54.540 --> 3:27:55.540]  Go ahead.
[3:27:55.540 --> 3:27:56.540]  Hey, Alex.
[3:27:56.540 --> 3:27:57.540]  Good.
[3:27:57.540 --> 3:28:00.220]  Hey, I have a question for you.
[3:28:00.220 --> 3:28:04.980]  I always thought it was strange that one of the 9-11 Commission members was at the time
[3:28:04.980 --> 3:28:09.140]  she was a member of, she was the vice chairman of the Fannie Mae, Jamie Gorlick, I believe
[3:28:09.140 --> 3:28:10.140]  her name.
[3:28:10.140 --> 3:28:11.140]  Yeah.
[3:28:11.140 --> 3:28:12.140]  Which one of what you thought about that?
[3:28:12.140 --> 3:28:16.660]  Well, I mean, it's just all a pack of crooks.
[3:28:16.660 --> 3:28:20.660]  Catherine Austin Fitz was one of the high level people at HUD with Clinton, and she went
[3:28:20.660 --> 3:28:25.860]  public saying it was a huge money laundering scam five, six years ago, and you got to give
[3:28:25.860 --> 3:28:27.420]  credit where credit's due.
[3:28:27.420 --> 3:28:28.940]  Mike Rupert was right about all this.
[3:28:28.940 --> 3:28:34.260]  He said like five years ago that Freddie and Fannie were going to collapse, and it was all
[3:28:34.260 --> 3:28:39.860]  a big scam, and that they were selling junk, and that it was all a big fraud, and he's
[3:28:39.860 --> 3:28:40.860]  right.
[3:28:40.860 --> 3:28:42.660]  You got to give credit where credit's due.
[3:28:42.660 --> 3:28:44.780]  So they were ahead of the curve on that.
[3:28:44.780 --> 3:28:45.780]  Hmm.
[3:28:45.780 --> 3:28:46.780]  Okay.
[3:28:46.780 --> 3:28:47.780]  I appreciate it.
[3:28:47.780 --> 3:28:49.380]  Hey, I appreciate you.
[3:28:49.380 --> 3:28:50.380]  You bet.
[3:28:50.380 --> 3:28:54.780]  Yeah, I think Mike Rupert's an example of ego.
[3:28:54.780 --> 3:28:58.940]  I mean, we really built him up, great guest, really smart guy.
[3:28:58.940 --> 3:29:03.260]  He got really popular, went to his head, and he went crazy for attacking me, everybody
[3:29:03.260 --> 3:29:04.260]  else.
[3:29:04.260 --> 3:29:05.260]  And it was just sad.
[3:29:05.260 --> 3:29:06.260]  I wasn't pleased.
[3:29:06.260 --> 3:29:08.540]  Like, oh, competition's down.
[3:29:08.540 --> 3:29:09.540]  Oh, great.
[3:29:09.540 --> 3:29:12.460]  No, I'm like, man, that was a talented, smart guy.
[3:29:12.460 --> 3:29:17.340]  Too bad he went bonkers, you know, or whatever he went off the reservation.
[3:29:17.340 --> 3:29:18.340]  He quit.
[3:29:18.340 --> 3:29:20.300]  You know, Mike's a good guy.
[3:29:20.300 --> 3:29:21.580]  We're on the march.
[3:29:21.580 --> 3:29:29.220]  The empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN, or whatever he went off the reservation.
[3:29:29.220 --> 3:29:30.220]  He quit.
[3:29:30.220 --> 3:29:32.140]  You know, Mike's a good guy.
[3:29:32.140 --> 3:29:33.420]  We're on the march.
[3:29:33.420 --> 3:29:39.980]  The empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:29:39.980 --> 3:29:47.300]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:29:47.300 --> 3:29:48.820]  against this country.
[3:29:48.820 --> 3:29:53.060]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[3:29:53.060 --> 3:29:54.060]  bin Laden.
[3:29:54.060 --> 3:29:55.060]  This is his MO.
[3:29:55.060 --> 3:29:56.060]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:29:56.060 --> 3:29:58.380]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:29:58.380 --> 3:30:02.820]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:30:02.820 --> 3:30:05.420]  networks inside the United States.
[3:30:05.420 --> 3:30:09.300]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[3:30:09.300 --> 3:30:12.060]  spying in and on the U.S.
[3:30:12.060 --> 3:30:15.740]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:30:15.740 --> 3:30:21.220]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:30:21.220 --> 3:30:25.020]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[3:30:25.020 --> 3:30:26.020]  much, much more.
[3:30:26.020 --> 3:30:27.020]  Fabled Enemies.

[3:30:45.140 --> 3:30:47.500]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[3:30:47.500 --> 3:30:52.900]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel and today I gave a killer presentation
[3:30:52.900 --> 3:30:53.900]  in Sydney.
[3:30:53.900 --> 3:30:59.100]  Finalized a contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston online from my desk
[3:30:59.100 --> 3:31:00.100]  with Webex.

[3:31:41.820 --> 3:31:43.460]  Wake up Protestant America.
[3:31:43.460 --> 3:31:47.180]  There is an acumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[3:31:47.180 --> 3:31:51.420]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics and Protestant denominations will form one
[3:31:51.420 --> 3:31:53.180]  huge political voting block.
[3:31:53.180 --> 3:31:57.220]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[3:31:57.220 --> 3:32:01.020]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty
[3:32:01.020 --> 3:32:02.220]  of conscience.
[3:32:02.220 --> 3:32:06.220]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept
[3:32:06.220 --> 3:32:07.220]  separate.
[3:32:07.220 --> 3:32:10.780]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[3:32:10.780 --> 3:32:13.340]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[3:32:13.340 --> 3:32:17.220]  From history, we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious
[3:32:17.220 --> 3:32:18.660]  intolerance resulted.
[3:32:18.660 --> 3:32:22.540]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[3:32:22.540 --> 3:32:25.340]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[3:32:25.340 --> 3:32:27.780]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[3:32:27.780 --> 3:32:29.580]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[3:32:29.580 --> 3:32:31.380]  Jesus is coming soon.
[3:32:31.380 --> 3:32:38.660]  For free materials, call 888-211-1715 or write the Bible says Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee
[3:32:38.660 --> 3:32:41.660]  377-71.
[3:32:41.660 --> 3:33:00.700]  UFC Ultimate Fighting Champion Tanner dead at 37.
[3:33:00.700 --> 3:33:09.820]  He went on a desert expedition by himself, cleansing and died in the desert.
[3:33:09.820 --> 3:33:10.820]  That's hubris.
[3:33:10.820 --> 3:33:12.700]  I'm not saying the guy's a bad person.
[3:33:12.700 --> 3:33:19.340]  My point is, big, tough, smart guy and it sounds interesting to me to go into the desert.
[3:33:19.340 --> 3:33:22.780]  It was 114 during the day, 50 degrees at night.
[3:33:22.780 --> 3:33:25.620]  He died.
[3:33:25.620 --> 3:33:26.620]  He died.
[3:33:26.620 --> 3:33:32.500]  And it's the same thing with so many other people I know, as I get more power, and again
[3:33:32.500 --> 3:33:36.780]  this is a tiny planet in the middle of the universe, the whole planet really is nothing.
[3:33:36.780 --> 3:33:40.620]  I see myself as like a little butterfly or a mouse or something.
[3:33:40.620 --> 3:33:45.900]  I'm not on, you know, I'm into the species, I'm into the universe, I'm into what we can
[3:33:45.900 --> 3:33:54.900]  build our potential, but individually, I have never been that arrogant or on a power trip.
[3:33:54.900 --> 3:33:59.900]  I've always realized that I'm weak, I've always realized that I'm not that smart, I've
[3:33:59.900 --> 3:34:03.860]  always realized that I always underestimated myself.
[3:34:03.860 --> 3:34:07.620]  I don't talk about myself individually, but it's a journey we all have, so I can only
[3:34:07.620 --> 3:34:09.020]  talk about myself.
[3:34:09.020 --> 3:34:15.220]  I remember being in high school and kind of having the idea that people didn't like me.
[3:34:15.220 --> 3:34:19.540]  Then later I read my yearbooks when I was in Dallas, and I was like, and then I talked
[3:34:19.540 --> 3:34:25.060]  to people, you know, and I was like, you were like the most popular person in school, you
[3:34:25.060 --> 3:34:29.780]  know, it's like, and I was like the James Dean Rebel, you know, beating, getting fights
[3:34:29.780 --> 3:34:37.380]  and partying and being wild and everything else, and my point is, is that I don't have
[3:34:37.380 --> 3:34:44.020]  that big of an ego, and people say, well, it sure sounds like that when you're arrogant
[3:34:44.020 --> 3:34:48.140]  and aggressive and go up and bullhorn national television, and no, no, no, that's a mission
[3:34:48.140 --> 3:34:51.900]  oriented, I mean, don't think that I won't get in your face, I'm not aggressive, but
[3:34:51.900 --> 3:34:58.300]  that's different, that's, that's more of a survival instinct.
[3:34:58.300 --> 3:35:00.820]  But see, I wouldn't go into the desert by myself.
[3:35:00.820 --> 3:35:05.180]  Doesn't mean that I don't think I could maybe make it, or that I'd be all right, it's just
[3:35:05.180 --> 3:35:11.380]  I know it's tempting fate, and I don't have that much confidence in myself.
[3:35:11.380 --> 3:35:18.340]  I don't even know why I'm going off on this jag.
[3:35:18.340 --> 3:35:22.220]  I had so many people I've worked with and been around, people in the patriot movement,
[3:35:22.220 --> 3:35:26.020]  and I'm not the great listeners, the best folks in the world, but people that come to
[3:35:26.020 --> 3:35:28.260]  this because they want power and they are ego.
[3:35:28.260 --> 3:35:31.660]  As soon as they get a little bit of an audience or a little bit of a website, they suddenly
[3:35:31.660 --> 3:35:37.260]  attack me, everybody else, you know, they kind of go wild, and I see that in business.
[3:35:37.260 --> 3:35:40.380]  People have a little bit of early success, and then they just think they've got it,
[3:35:40.380 --> 3:35:44.780]  they think they're magic, overconfident.
[3:35:44.780 --> 3:35:49.180]  You don't want to be overconfident, folks, and you don't want to be overconfident in
[3:35:49.180 --> 3:35:50.980]  this fight against the New World Order.
[3:35:50.980 --> 3:35:55.860]  I mean, that's why I tell you how bad it really is, so we can get people who are rationalizing
[3:35:55.860 --> 3:36:00.460]  or saying, oh, it'll be all right, or, oh, it's not real, to really listen and go, no,
[3:36:00.460 --> 3:36:06.140]  this is serious, and this is dangerous, and you better pay attention.
[3:36:06.140 --> 3:36:11.780]  You know, you've been warned, this is at your own peril.
[3:36:11.780 --> 3:36:20.300]  I've digressed.
[3:36:20.300 --> 3:36:24.260]  I just see so many good old boys that are so arrogant, so full of themselves, nobody
[3:36:24.260 --> 3:36:28.740]  can mess with them, they're the tough guy, they stick their chest out at people at bars
[3:36:28.740 --> 3:36:32.700]  on the street, and their wife or girlfriends looking out at them, and they're just kind
[3:36:32.700 --> 3:36:37.100]  of this delusional fruitcake land, but then some cop pulls that guy over and he pees
[3:36:37.100 --> 3:36:46.540]  in his pants, or they get a letter from the IRS and they have a heart attack.
[3:36:46.540 --> 3:36:54.100]  You know, it's moral courage is what we need, and courage on real issues and real missions,
[3:36:54.100 --> 3:36:58.700]  not just walking around like you see a lot of these men just like, and they're actually
[3:36:58.700 --> 3:36:59.700]  delusional.
[3:36:59.700 --> 3:37:05.780]  It's like a five-year-old act of imagining they're a space captain, or Darth Vader.
[3:37:05.780 --> 3:37:10.060]  You see a five-year-old acting tough and really getting into it, I see adults like
[3:37:10.060 --> 3:37:11.060]  that.
[3:37:11.060 --> 3:37:15.340]  I was like, if you really were a badass and you've been in a bunch of fights, you know
[3:37:15.340 --> 3:37:19.140]  how bad it is to get your butt kicked, and then on any given day you run into the wrong
[3:37:19.140 --> 3:37:22.220]  person, you'll end up in the hospital, if you were so tough you wouldn't be walking around
[3:37:22.220 --> 3:37:23.220]  acting like that.
[3:37:23.220 --> 3:37:25.980]  They're really tough guys, people that try to stay out of the way and don't want to
[3:37:25.980 --> 3:37:29.860]  be bothered by people and are very friendly.
[3:37:29.860 --> 3:37:34.900]  And again, that's an expression of the government, the police, the military, everybody else.
[3:37:34.900 --> 3:37:40.220]  They just, they aren't connecting with reality, and they think they're bulletproof.
[3:37:40.220 --> 3:37:43.260]  And folks, none of us are bulletproof.
[3:37:43.260 --> 3:37:51.180]  Another thing is a million-plus children are kidnapped every year.
[3:37:51.180 --> 3:37:55.820]  If I went over the crimes of the CPS, it would dwarf anything you could really imagine.
[3:37:55.820 --> 3:38:00.700]  It's hard for me to grasp it.
[3:38:00.700 --> 3:38:04.900]  Fourteen sports stadiums filled with 100,000 people apiece.
[3:38:04.900 --> 3:38:09.300]  That's how many children, according to the Department of Justice, are grabbed by Child
[3:38:09.300 --> 3:38:11.180]  Protective Services.
[3:38:11.180 --> 3:38:20.980]  One point four million, 14 of the biggest sports stadiums filled every year.
[3:38:20.980 --> 3:38:25.420]  No due process, no judge, no jury, no indictment, no claims.
[3:38:25.420 --> 3:38:29.100]  They find ignorant parents that are trusting in the government going, well, we didn't do
[3:38:29.100 --> 3:38:30.100]  nothing.
[3:38:30.100 --> 3:38:33.060]  Yeah, we'll sign agreements that you can oversee us and we've done some wrong.
[3:38:33.060 --> 3:38:39.060]  If that makes us, oh, you're taking my child, what, I didn't know, folks, your child gets
[3:38:39.060 --> 3:38:41.060]  bitten by a dog.
[3:38:41.060 --> 3:38:42.060]  Happened to all of us.
[3:38:42.060 --> 3:38:45.740]  I was bitten by neighborhood dogs over and over again, probably 10 times growing up.
[3:38:45.740 --> 3:38:49.860]  Run up, bite you on the butt, bite you on the leg, sheet dog, run up, you know, bite
[3:38:49.860 --> 3:38:50.860]  you on the hand.
[3:38:50.860 --> 3:38:53.020]  Go ahead and kick it upside the head and it runs off.
[3:38:53.020 --> 3:38:56.420]  I mean, Paul, have you ever been bitten by a dog?
[3:38:56.420 --> 3:38:57.420]  How many times?
[3:38:57.420 --> 3:38:58.420]  Once.
[3:38:58.420 --> 3:38:59.420]  Okay.
[3:38:59.420 --> 3:39:04.380]  One time I had this big fat chihuahua that my buddy had and was always growling at me
[3:39:04.380 --> 3:39:07.420]  at his house and finally I was wearing shorts one day over there and I was like 14, it just
[3:39:07.420 --> 3:39:11.820]  bit a huge chunk out of the back of my leg, little bastard.
[3:39:11.820 --> 3:39:19.380]  Anyways, the point is that happens, CPS is going to take a kid, they're going to try.
[3:39:19.380 --> 3:39:22.940]  When you go in to have a baby and they ask the husband, oh, you dropped this form downstairs
[3:39:22.940 --> 3:39:26.460]  for me, they ask your wife, you got enough money at home, you're doing well, you guys
[3:39:26.460 --> 3:39:27.460]  ever argue?
[3:39:27.460 --> 3:39:30.740]  Boom, your kids are gone.
[3:39:30.740 --> 3:39:33.580]  You need to know that this is a criminal prison grin.
[3:39:33.580 --> 3:39:37.700]  The schools, the school counselors, all of it, it's all meant to break your family up.
[3:39:37.700 --> 3:39:40.940]  The government believes a family's a disease.
[3:39:40.940 --> 3:39:43.740]  They've got over two thirds of foster children on psychotropic drugs.
[3:39:43.740 --> 3:39:48.180]  They say it's because they have bad genes, that's in end game.
[3:39:48.180 --> 3:39:52.660]  For the next 20 minutes I want to bring, I can't go into overdrive, I want some British
[3:39:52.660 --> 3:39:56.300]  radio, but I want to get rid of all these calls, everybody else that's holding.
[3:39:56.300 --> 3:40:01.460]  But the point is, this is real, it's happening, and go out there on your own peril.
[3:40:01.460 --> 3:40:04.220]  Billboards aren't going to tell you about the danger.
[3:40:04.220 --> 3:40:07.540]  Public service announcements in between the CIA announcing they're working with their
[3:40:07.540 --> 3:40:11.300]  local government, that's not going to save you.
[3:40:11.300 --> 3:40:14.700]  Everybody's been learned to be gelded, to cower to government.
[3:40:14.700 --> 3:40:18.900]  You have pedophile rings that run the CPS on average, they were set up over 100 years
[3:40:18.900 --> 3:40:26.380]  ago as eugenics cores, and I have all that in end game, and that's who they are.
[3:40:26.380 --> 3:40:31.580]  They set up separate eugenics courts about 100 years ago in this country.
[3:40:31.580 --> 3:40:36.300]  They sterilized over 500,000 people, euthanized hundreds of thousands of newborn babies and
[3:40:36.300 --> 3:40:37.300]  children.
[3:40:37.300 --> 3:40:40.500]  They murdered babies in this country.
[3:40:40.500 --> 3:40:42.460]  They should just take them and drown them or kill them right there.
[3:40:42.460 --> 3:40:47.860]  They take the poor woman's baby, something's wrong with your baby, oh, baby died.
[3:40:47.860 --> 3:40:50.460]  Death warrant signed by the judge.
[3:40:50.460 --> 3:40:52.740]  You didn't know about that, Paul?
[3:40:52.740 --> 3:41:01.060]  Yeah, type in 35 states for sterilization laws, or US for sterilization laws, and then
[3:41:01.060 --> 3:41:04.500]  just kind of footnoted in there as they also like to kill the babies.
[3:41:04.500 --> 3:41:12.620]  Now, this same pack of scum has now metastasized, and the last three major directors of the
[3:41:12.620 --> 3:41:19.460]  CPS in Florida, or family services there, have been caught to be pedophile ring runners.
[3:41:19.460 --> 3:41:20.460]  What is it?
[3:41:20.460 --> 3:41:24.020]  Last time I checked, 5,000 plus kids are missing in Florida that the government took.
[3:41:24.020 --> 3:41:26.100]  Oh, you think I'm joking?
[3:41:26.100 --> 3:41:30.460]  Paul's looking at, do you know about the Texas Youth Commission, Paul?
[3:41:30.460 --> 3:41:33.060]  The big rape rooms and selling the kids?
[3:41:33.060 --> 3:41:35.860]  Okay, that's the Texas Rangers weren't allowed to stop them?
[3:41:35.860 --> 3:41:37.540]  Yeah, that's what we're talking about.
[3:41:37.540 --> 3:41:40.740]  So that's the criminals we're talking about.
[3:41:40.740 --> 3:41:45.460]  Now, for speaking out against this, our guest was put in a mental institution for a little
[3:41:45.460 --> 3:41:46.460]  while.
[3:41:46.460 --> 3:41:47.460]  Greg Pound's a great guy.
[3:41:47.460 --> 3:41:50.500]  He and his Christian wife, no criminal record, homeschooling.
[3:41:50.500 --> 3:41:51.500]  They black-opped him.
[3:41:51.500 --> 3:41:54.140]  The lady that did it was found guilty of lying about him.
[3:41:54.140 --> 3:41:55.500]  State says, we don't care if it's not true.
[3:41:55.500 --> 3:41:57.140]  You don't get to see your children.
[3:41:57.140 --> 3:42:00.020]  And Greg, I want you to give out your number, your website, for support.
[3:42:00.020 --> 3:42:01.820]  You haven't been on with this in about a year.
[3:42:01.820 --> 3:42:03.620]  I'm going to have you back on as this develops.
[3:42:03.620 --> 3:42:08.620]  But in a nutshell, tell people what happened to your children, where they are now, how
[3:42:08.620 --> 3:42:10.700]  this, and then the latest thing.
[3:42:10.700 --> 3:42:11.700]  Here in the Soviet America.
[3:42:11.700 --> 3:42:13.980]  Okay, Alex, can you hear me?
[3:42:13.980 --> 3:42:14.980]  Yes, Mr. Pound.
[3:42:14.980 --> 3:42:19.180]  Okay, listen, Alex, I want to thank you for your program, and I want to, can I just share
[3:42:19.180 --> 3:42:20.180]  something with you?
[3:42:20.180 --> 3:42:25.380]  Just, this is a verse out of the Bible that, this is what it says, to this end was I born,
[3:42:25.380 --> 3:42:30.380]  and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness of the truth.
[3:42:30.380 --> 3:42:34.260]  Everyone that is other truth, here it's my voice.
[3:42:34.260 --> 3:42:37.220]  And you know, I just thank you for your program and speaking the truth.
[3:42:37.220 --> 3:42:38.740]  That's what we need is the truth.
[3:42:38.740 --> 3:42:42.820]  Sometimes, with what I'm dealing with, with being separated from my wife for two years
[3:42:42.820 --> 3:42:45.500]  and not seeing my kids, sometimes it's hard for me to listen to your program.
[3:42:45.500 --> 3:42:46.500]  That's right.
[3:42:46.500 --> 3:42:49.820]  Your wife had to escape, so they wanted the others, the child rapers wanted the other
[3:42:49.820 --> 3:42:50.820]  ones.
[3:42:50.820 --> 3:42:55.580]  Now, I'm not kidding, the pedophile ring, in a nutshell, tell folks about what the pedophile
[3:42:55.580 --> 3:42:56.780]  rings did to you.
[3:42:56.780 --> 3:43:01.940]  Well, what it is, is they came in, they're filing false police reports to still people's
[3:43:01.940 --> 3:43:06.940]  kids, and at the bottom line, as we found out, was for federal grant money.
[3:43:06.940 --> 3:43:08.900]  The money that's coming in from the fed.
[3:43:08.900 --> 3:43:10.100]  There's a bounty on them.
[3:43:10.100 --> 3:43:11.100]  Exactly.
[3:43:11.100 --> 3:43:15.100]  There's a bounty on people's children, and it's just unbelievable how much money they're
[3:43:15.100 --> 3:43:18.580]  coming in, and we believe it's coming from the United Nations because our federal government
[3:43:18.580 --> 3:43:19.580]  is broke.
[3:43:19.580 --> 3:43:23.820]  Now, that's under UNESCO, it's absolutely, there's been IMF and World Bank money on the
[3:43:23.820 --> 3:43:24.820]  bounty.
[3:43:24.820 --> 3:43:25.820]  Okay.
[3:43:25.820 --> 3:43:27.460]  And so, I mean, so this is what we're dealing with.
[3:43:27.460 --> 3:43:31.180]  We haven't seen our kids now for four years, my wife's been hiding for two and a half years
[3:43:31.180 --> 3:43:35.300]  with our little baby, and our last child that was born.
[3:43:35.300 --> 3:43:40.140]  And so, I decided I'm going to run for sheriff, I mean, I'm not giving up my kids, I've tried,
[3:43:40.140 --> 3:43:44.100]  I'm trying everything, and so what it is, I'm actually running now for sheriff against
[3:43:44.100 --> 3:43:47.540]  the present sheriff who's filing these false police reports along with the state attorney
[3:43:47.540 --> 3:43:48.540]  Bernie McPete.
[3:43:48.540 --> 3:43:52.540]  And you've already sent, you've already convicted one monster.
[3:43:52.540 --> 3:43:53.540]  Yeah.
[3:43:53.540 --> 3:43:56.500]  It's what people need to realize.
[3:43:56.500 --> 3:43:59.540]  This is Pinellas County where Terry Shival was starving to death.
[3:43:59.540 --> 3:44:03.780]  This is the exact same county where these people got, I mean, these people think they're
[3:44:03.780 --> 3:44:05.820]  told, they think they're gods.
[3:44:05.820 --> 3:44:10.380]  When they can go ahead and kill people and steal people's little children, Bernie McPete,
[3:44:10.380 --> 3:44:11.380]  you can read the...
[3:44:11.380 --> 3:44:14.460]  Well, why don't you briefly tell folks how this all started?
[3:44:14.460 --> 3:44:17.380]  Well, it started with an accidental dog bite.
[3:44:17.380 --> 3:44:21.380]  Dog bites are the number one accidents among children as you were talking earlier, and
[3:44:21.380 --> 3:44:22.380]  that's what happened.
[3:44:22.380 --> 3:44:26.860]  My daughter accidentally got bit, my wife called 911, a case manager comes out, this
[3:44:26.860 --> 3:44:31.660]  young girl with a still rod in her tongue, hair shaved off her head, jet black, and
[3:44:31.660 --> 3:44:33.660]  she's out here confiscating people's kids.
[3:44:33.660 --> 3:44:36.100]  Now she committed 96 third degree felonies.
[3:44:36.100 --> 3:44:42.700]  She committed 26 degree felonies and filing false police reports, 70 counts of grand theft,
[3:44:42.700 --> 3:44:46.980]  and this is all related to money coming in from the federal government.
[3:44:46.980 --> 3:44:50.700]  And she didn't set four days or four hours in jail.
[3:44:50.700 --> 3:44:52.300]  But she was convicted of lying.
[3:44:52.300 --> 3:44:53.420]  She was convicted.
[3:44:53.420 --> 3:44:54.420]  We've got to...
[3:44:54.420 --> 3:44:59.260]  Where is this, where is this Kerr right now?
[3:44:59.260 --> 3:45:01.740]  Megan Gallagher, I don't know where she went.
[3:45:01.740 --> 3:45:03.860]  We... she's disappeared.
[3:45:03.860 --> 3:45:04.860]  I mean...
[3:45:04.860 --> 3:45:07.700]  I just pray that God bring judgment upon her.
[3:45:07.700 --> 3:45:08.900]  Let's pray together right now.
[3:45:08.900 --> 3:45:09.900]  Okay.
[3:45:09.900 --> 3:45:10.900]  Go ahead.
[3:45:10.900 --> 3:45:11.900]  I want you to pray.
[3:45:11.900 --> 3:45:15.100]  Father, we come in the name and through the blood of your son, our Savior, our Redeemer.
[3:45:15.100 --> 3:45:18.300]  We ask that you bring judgment on these evil people, Father.
[3:45:18.300 --> 3:45:20.100]  We ask that you would, Father, bring...
[3:45:20.100 --> 3:45:24.340]  You said we pray that you'd bring them to either repentance or bring them to death.
[3:45:24.340 --> 3:45:27.900]  Give them life or give them death, Father, but we ask that you will bring weight upon
[3:45:27.900 --> 3:45:31.580]  them, that'll push them down to the place where they cry for mercy.
[3:45:31.580 --> 3:45:33.620]  We ask these things in Christ's name.
[3:45:33.620 --> 3:45:34.620]  Amen.
[3:45:34.620 --> 3:45:38.460]  And our listeners are all praying that right now.
[3:45:38.460 --> 3:45:42.300]  And I have absolute faith that she will pay today for what she's done.
[3:45:42.300 --> 3:45:46.180]  I know she's already paid in many ways, but she will pay further.
[3:45:46.180 --> 3:45:50.220]  You know, Alex, once you see the judgment that's coming down on these people...
[3:45:50.220 --> 3:45:51.220]  Oh, I know.
[3:45:51.220 --> 3:45:52.220]  They're dying.
[3:45:52.220 --> 3:45:53.220]  They're dying in car wrecks.
[3:45:53.220 --> 3:45:54.220]  Their kids are all dying.
[3:45:54.220 --> 3:45:55.220]  I know.
[3:45:55.220 --> 3:45:56.220]  It's real.
[3:45:56.220 --> 3:45:57.220]  It is.
[3:45:57.220 --> 3:45:58.220]  It is.
[3:45:58.220 --> 3:45:59.220]  Our attorney got shot in the head.
[3:45:59.220 --> 3:46:03.500]  She was with the juvenile court judge who was doing all this.
[3:46:03.500 --> 3:46:04.500]  She was...
[3:46:04.500 --> 3:46:08.020]  I mean, Stacey Plummer, you can go back and read about it.
[3:46:08.020 --> 3:46:09.020]  I mean, she was our attorney.
[3:46:09.020 --> 3:46:13.380]  I told her, listen, I told her and the judge, I said, they're the God that judges, judges.
[3:46:13.380 --> 3:46:14.380]  And I said, you...
[3:46:14.380 --> 3:46:17.020]  And they ripped us off for our money.
[3:46:17.020 --> 3:46:19.420]  And she ended up getting shot in the head.
[3:46:19.420 --> 3:46:20.420]  She's dead now.
[3:46:20.420 --> 3:46:23.860]  I used to see her go by, stand out from that courthouse every single day.
[3:46:23.860 --> 3:46:26.220]  I've been out there now for going on four years.
[3:46:26.220 --> 3:46:29.540]  And so what happens is now that I'm running for sheriff and my...
[3:46:29.540 --> 3:46:30.540]  And people...
[3:46:30.540 --> 3:46:34.580]  I mean, what they did, this thing, I went to the Republican convention here for McCain.
[3:46:34.580 --> 3:46:36.700]  They were having a big party for him.
[3:46:36.700 --> 3:46:41.340]  And so I'm a Republican running as an independent for a sheriff in Pinellas County.
[3:46:41.340 --> 3:46:47.380]  And what happens is that I went to this party and these guys came in like the robo-cops
[3:46:47.380 --> 3:46:48.380]  and under...
[3:46:48.380 --> 3:46:49.380]  I mean, undercover.
[3:46:49.380 --> 3:46:54.140]  I mean, this is at a Republican party and this in the sheriff there made a move on me
[3:46:54.140 --> 3:46:56.020]  that was just totally insane.
[3:46:56.020 --> 3:46:59.620]  Got me out of a place where I'm sitting in a big ballroom with 600 other people.
[3:46:59.620 --> 3:47:00.620]  Now, let's be clear.
[3:47:00.620 --> 3:47:02.140]  You're running against the sheriff.
[3:47:02.140 --> 3:47:05.100]  Now all the time you hear about sheriffs killing other people running for sheriffs.
[3:47:05.100 --> 3:47:08.020]  I mean, this is America.
[3:47:08.020 --> 3:47:09.660]  And so they even kill each other.
[3:47:09.660 --> 3:47:11.100]  So you're running against him.
[3:47:11.100 --> 3:47:12.220]  He has you grabbed.
[3:47:12.220 --> 3:47:13.220]  What happens next?
[3:47:13.220 --> 3:47:15.740]  Well, the next thing is they...
[3:47:15.740 --> 3:47:16.940]  They dragged me out to back door.
[3:47:16.940 --> 3:47:18.300]  They held him.
[3:47:18.300 --> 3:47:20.860]  And they take all my stuff.
[3:47:20.860 --> 3:47:25.660]  Everything I had on me went to my papers, took everything I had, handcuffed me.
[3:47:25.660 --> 3:47:26.660]  And they waited for a car.
[3:47:26.660 --> 3:47:32.060]  It got me stuck in the car and took me down to the 49th Street jail and I sat in there
[3:47:32.060 --> 3:47:33.060]  for a while.
[3:47:33.060 --> 3:47:36.620]  Then after that, they decided to send me off to the psych ward.
[3:47:36.620 --> 3:47:40.220]  And they wanted to release me, but I told them I'm not signing any release papers.
[3:47:40.220 --> 3:47:42.380]  I said, listen, I shouldn't even be here.
[3:47:42.380 --> 3:47:45.940]  If I sign a release form, that means that I'm saying I'm going to come and stand before
[3:47:45.940 --> 3:47:46.940]  a judge.
[3:47:46.940 --> 3:47:48.740]  Which is the same thing that happened with your children.
[3:47:48.740 --> 3:47:50.780]  They just go, sign it and everything will be all right.
[3:47:50.780 --> 3:47:52.620]  They go, I've got your child now.
[3:47:52.620 --> 3:47:56.300]  It's just like in a little mermaid when she says, sign the contract, she signs it and the
[3:47:56.300 --> 3:47:58.300]  witch goes, ha ha ha, yes!
[3:47:58.300 --> 3:47:59.300]  Ah!
[3:47:59.300 --> 3:48:04.100]  I mean, this is a criminal government that lies and says it's the law your children have
[3:48:04.100 --> 3:48:05.100]  to take vaccines.
[3:48:05.100 --> 3:48:10.020]  Then they line up at courthouses everywhere with drug dogs and guys in riot gear injecting
[3:48:10.020 --> 3:48:11.540]  thousands of children.
[3:48:11.540 --> 3:48:12.540]  And there's not even a law.
[3:48:12.540 --> 3:48:15.900]  I mean, see, the government is totally bankrupt and wicked.
[3:48:15.900 --> 3:48:16.900]  Go ahead.
[3:48:16.900 --> 3:48:18.180]  Well, so that's where it's at.
[3:48:18.180 --> 3:48:20.860]  I mean, they put me directly into a psych unit.
[3:48:20.860 --> 3:48:24.140]  Well, you're a crazy person.
[3:48:24.140 --> 3:48:25.620]  You want your children back.
[3:48:25.620 --> 3:48:28.140]  Oh my God, how dare you!
[3:48:28.140 --> 3:48:29.140]  Yeah.
[3:48:29.140 --> 3:48:30.740]  Well, we're not giving up our kid.
[3:48:30.740 --> 3:48:33.660]  Where are, how long have the kidnappers had your children?
[3:48:33.660 --> 3:48:34.660]  Four years.
[3:48:34.660 --> 3:48:36.940]  August 3rd was four years.
[3:48:36.940 --> 3:48:39.060]  And do you know where they have your children?
[3:48:39.060 --> 3:48:40.060]  No, I don't.
[3:48:40.060 --> 3:48:43.780]  Now, tell us, these are human beings, so the psychopaths are listening.
[3:48:43.780 --> 3:48:48.620]  But some of them are just borderline psychopaths, so for the scum that's out there, talk about
[3:48:48.620 --> 3:48:49.620]  them.
[3:48:49.620 --> 3:48:50.620]  These are human beings.
[3:48:50.620 --> 3:48:52.500]  Tell us the children's names.
[3:48:52.500 --> 3:48:57.260]  Okay, Hannah, Isaiah, Joanna, and Susanna.
[3:48:57.260 --> 3:49:00.580]  My son, Isaiah, had no cavities when they took him.
[3:49:00.580 --> 3:49:05.180]  A year and a half after they had him, when he would smile, you'd see six big cavities
[3:49:05.180 --> 3:49:06.180]  in his teeth.
[3:49:06.180 --> 3:49:07.300]  It'd just make us cry.
[3:49:07.300 --> 3:49:11.660]  My wife was a dental assistant in an all-children's dental facility, and we would look at our
[3:49:11.660 --> 3:49:13.420]  kids and look what they've done to our children.
[3:49:13.420 --> 3:49:14.420]  We would just cry.
[3:49:14.420 --> 3:49:15.660]  We didn't know what else to do.
[3:49:15.660 --> 3:49:20.300]  We would cry like babies, and we just, and we just, and I've been at these events with
[3:49:20.300 --> 3:49:21.300]  other parents.
[3:49:21.300 --> 3:49:27.740]  The CPS workers just sit there, just like, they're just, oh, they love the torture,
[3:49:27.740 --> 3:49:28.740]  don't they?
[3:49:28.740 --> 3:49:29.740]  They enjoy it.
[3:49:29.740 --> 3:49:30.740]  Oh, yes.
[3:49:30.740 --> 3:49:36.620]  The only thing, the only way we can imagine, that's why we put together the website, FreeRKids.com,
[3:49:36.620 --> 3:49:40.900]  where we show how they take a nine-year-old boy and torture this kid for three years,
[3:49:40.900 --> 3:49:42.740]  and he tells the story.
[3:49:42.740 --> 3:49:47.180]  If people, if you get your listeners to watch FreeRKids.com and listen what this nine-year-old
[3:49:47.180 --> 3:49:49.900]  boy tells what they did to him, he gives the names of the people.
[3:49:49.900 --> 3:49:54.180]  Hey, every, every day, and I'm not looking for it, I find out where new social workers
[3:49:54.180 --> 3:49:56.860]  or foster parents have kids locked in cages.
[3:49:56.860 --> 3:49:57.860]  That's standard.
[3:49:57.860 --> 3:50:00.780]  Feed them like one hot dog a day, they'll starve them to death.
[3:50:00.780 --> 3:50:01.780]  They rape them.
[3:50:01.780 --> 3:50:05.700]  He'll stand there and show you the pictures that we have of them, how skinny he was.
[3:50:05.700 --> 3:50:07.380]  It's just unbelievable.
[3:50:07.380 --> 3:50:08.380]  They will pay.
[3:50:08.380 --> 3:50:11.980]  Let me tell you, that's why these people are rotting on happy scum.
[3:50:11.980 --> 3:50:14.940]  And let me tell you, God is going to cut you down.
[3:50:14.940 --> 3:50:16.780]  I'm going to have to do a thing.
[3:50:16.780 --> 3:50:18.500]  You may not believe in God, but we do.
[3:50:18.500 --> 3:50:19.820]  And let me tell you something, Trash.
[3:50:19.820 --> 3:50:23.020]  We rape what you sow.
[3:50:23.020 --> 3:50:24.020]  Absolute filth.
[3:50:24.020 --> 3:50:25.020]  Stay there.
[3:50:25.020 --> 3:50:27.940]  I'm going to talk behind scenes with our guest.
[3:50:27.940 --> 3:50:31.620]  All right, let's continue.
[3:50:31.620 --> 3:50:35.100]  I'm just skipping that break right now.
[3:50:35.100 --> 3:50:39.260]  Greg Pound continued to talk about, I mean, when I talk about thousands of missing Florida
[3:50:39.260 --> 3:50:43.180]  children the government took, I mean, when I talk about the rape rooms here in Texas,
[3:50:43.180 --> 3:50:45.660]  admittedly, I mean, it's the pure evil.
[3:50:45.660 --> 3:50:50.300]  The people I don't think can understand, we're not exaggerating here.
[3:50:50.300 --> 3:50:56.220]  If they go to the website, NorthCountryGazette.org, and look how the prosecuting attorney, Bernie
[3:50:56.220 --> 3:51:00.660]  McCabe, has allegations of molesting little children that he was adopting.
[3:51:00.660 --> 3:51:01.660]  City Councilmen.
[3:51:01.660 --> 3:51:05.900]  Well, how many, how many Homeland Security deputies have been caught doing this?
[3:51:05.900 --> 3:51:09.820]  Well, the Federal Prosecutor and Pinalis, not in Pinalis, up in the Panhandle went to have
[3:51:09.820 --> 3:51:11.540]  sex with that five-year-old little girl.
[3:51:11.540 --> 3:51:12.860]  I don't know if you heard about that.
[3:51:12.860 --> 3:51:13.860]  Yeah.
[3:51:13.860 --> 3:51:18.660]  Well, the City Council chairman for St. Petersburg was, he was doing the same thing.
[3:51:18.660 --> 3:51:20.940]  He was adopting little children and molesting them.
[3:51:20.940 --> 3:51:25.660]  Al Zimmerman, the spokesman for the whole state of Florida, was molesting little boys.
[3:51:25.660 --> 3:51:29.700]  The FDLE in the state of Florida went and arrested them, so they had the FBI come in.
[3:51:29.700 --> 3:51:32.060]  The FBI here in the state had to come in and arrest them.
[3:51:32.060 --> 3:51:35.700]  Well, I mean, every week, every day, you hear about some state senator or somebody else
[3:51:35.700 --> 3:51:40.740]  who's the head of stopping exploited children, and then they're running the rape ops.
[3:51:40.740 --> 3:51:42.140]  Congressman Foley here in Florida.
[3:51:42.140 --> 3:51:43.140]  Right here in Pinalis.
[3:51:43.140 --> 3:51:46.980]  Congressman Foley, he was the one who got picked up to a big scandal on a Republican
[3:51:46.980 --> 3:51:47.980]  party.
[3:51:47.980 --> 3:51:48.980]  Do you remember that, Alex?
[3:51:48.980 --> 3:51:49.980]  Oh, yeah.
[3:51:49.980 --> 3:51:50.980]  No, no, no.
[3:51:50.980 --> 3:51:51.980]  But I mean, you see it all the time.
[3:51:51.980 --> 3:51:52.980]  Yeah.
[3:51:52.980 --> 3:51:53.980]  It's just constant.
[3:51:53.980 --> 3:51:56.180]  Well, they've got to get children.
[3:51:56.180 --> 3:51:57.380]  That they've got to get them.
[3:51:57.380 --> 3:52:01.220]  I mean, they are just, I'm just so sick of it.
[3:52:01.220 --> 3:52:04.500]  Alex, Alex, have you ever heard why they want to have sex with children?
[3:52:04.500 --> 3:52:05.500]  No.
[3:52:05.500 --> 3:52:07.060]  Do you ever wonder why?
[3:52:07.060 --> 3:52:08.060]  No.
[3:52:08.060 --> 3:52:11.500]  Because they say it feels tighter.
[3:52:11.500 --> 3:52:15.700]  That's why they have sex, men with men and little children is because L. Zimmerman says
[3:52:15.700 --> 3:52:18.940]  when they finally got to him, they said he likes having sex with children because it
[3:52:18.940 --> 3:52:19.940]  feels tighter.
[3:52:19.940 --> 3:52:22.300]  That's what you're dealing with.
[3:52:22.300 --> 3:52:24.060]  These are the kind of creeps that we got running.
[3:52:24.060 --> 3:52:29.460]  And they've got a national security state coming in over all of us, folks.
[3:52:29.460 --> 3:52:31.380]  And see, they're just a low-level scum.
[3:52:31.380 --> 3:52:35.660]  The evil up top are the evil up top are the eugenicists running all of this.
[3:52:35.660 --> 3:52:37.700]  I mean, and this is what we're dealing with.
[3:52:37.700 --> 3:52:39.580]  Me and my, I mean, we just don't know what to do.
[3:52:39.580 --> 3:52:40.580]  We just don't know.
[3:52:40.580 --> 3:52:43.580]  I mean, and I'm going to stand, and I'm going to, there's what I'm going to do.
[3:52:43.580 --> 3:52:46.580]  Now, do you ever even get to see your children anymore or have they fully taken them?
[3:52:46.580 --> 3:52:48.260]  No, they're gone.
[3:52:48.260 --> 3:52:50.020]  They're telling me, I'm not giving up my kids.
[3:52:50.020 --> 3:52:53.740]  They're going to either kill me, listen, it says live free on New Hampshire's license
[3:52:53.740 --> 3:52:54.740]  plate.
[3:52:54.740 --> 3:52:55.740]  It says live free or die.
[3:52:55.740 --> 3:53:00.060]  Do you know if they've shipped your children out of state?
[3:53:00.060 --> 3:53:01.060]  I don't know.
[3:53:01.060 --> 3:53:07.620]  I mean, I, I mean, I, I mean, I'm, I'm, you know, I mean, that's, it's, I'm constantly
[3:53:07.620 --> 3:53:08.740]  trying to find out.
[3:53:08.740 --> 3:53:13.300]  The one thing is, and this was all over the dog bite, all over an accidental dog bite.
[3:53:13.300 --> 3:53:14.300]  It has nothing to do with anything.
[3:53:14.300 --> 3:53:19.580]  Listen, listen, I know well to do women and families in Austin, well to do their child
[3:53:19.580 --> 3:53:21.180]  will break their finger on a jungle gym.
[3:53:21.180 --> 3:53:22.180]  CPS tries to take them.
[3:53:22.180 --> 3:53:23.180]  It doesn't matter.
[3:53:23.180 --> 3:53:28.300]  They're here for any reason they go to the doctors, the state of the state of the require
[3:53:28.300 --> 3:53:29.300]  explain that to people.
[3:53:29.300 --> 3:53:37.300]  Here we go.
[3:53:37.300 --> 3:53:41.060]  If you break your finger, if your child falls off and breaks their finger in front of witnesses,
[3:53:41.060 --> 3:53:42.180]  doesn't even rich people.
[3:53:42.180 --> 3:53:45.260]  They're going after their kids now.
[3:53:45.260 --> 3:53:49.860]  And literally they, they have these weirdo judges who they name the buildings after them
[3:53:49.860 --> 3:53:53.140]  while they're still in office.
[3:53:53.140 --> 3:53:55.060]  And they're coming straight on for our children.
[3:53:55.060 --> 3:53:59.980]  They are just attacking, attacking, attacking, attacking their own textbooks.
[3:53:59.980 --> 3:54:03.740]  Months ago I said the textbooks say that the families of disease, they want to eradicate
[3:54:03.740 --> 3:54:04.740]  it.
[3:54:04.740 --> 3:54:05.740]  The social worker textbooks.
[3:54:05.740 --> 3:54:10.020]  They believe it and there was like 20, 30 textbook links and articles that were posted
[3:54:10.020 --> 3:54:12.740]  on theprisonplanet.com forum.
[3:54:12.740 --> 3:54:16.740]  The doctors are spying, the nurses are spying, the whole system is predatory.
[3:54:16.740 --> 3:54:18.820]  They want your children.
[3:54:18.820 --> 3:54:21.940]  They get hundreds of thousands to adopt them.
[3:54:21.940 --> 3:54:24.980]  Local officials want them to, for their sex rings.
[3:54:24.980 --> 3:54:25.980]  I mean you're lucky.
[3:54:25.980 --> 3:54:28.700]  You're blessed if they kidnap your child and it just gets adopted.
[3:54:28.700 --> 3:54:29.940]  Most of the time they're okay.
[3:54:29.940 --> 3:54:33.820]  If it goes to one of the officials and you'll notice most of these officials in your towns,
[3:54:33.820 --> 3:54:35.340]  they all got adopted kids.
[3:54:35.340 --> 3:54:37.980]  That's what, that's who the, I mean you can't make this up.
[3:54:37.980 --> 3:54:42.900]  We've got about three or four minutes left here with our guest Greg Pound and the website
[3:54:42.900 --> 3:54:49.500]  we've got up on the video screen for people watching onprisonplanet.tv, freerkids.com.
[3:54:49.500 --> 3:54:54.260]  But listen, when you go to the hospital to have babies, they're there interrogating and
[3:54:54.260 --> 3:54:55.260]  your wife doesn't know.
[3:54:55.260 --> 3:54:58.340]  If you say, oh yeah, we're having trouble with money, they're going to come.
[3:54:58.340 --> 3:55:00.980]  I mean you've got to realize the black ops are everywhere.
[3:55:00.980 --> 3:55:04.100]  Anything else you want to add here at the end?
[3:55:04.100 --> 3:55:07.900]  Try to appeal in court on the issue that we have a right to a trial by jury.
[3:55:07.900 --> 3:55:12.380]  And they said, you can have a right to a trial by jury over a cat if you get a divorce.
[3:55:12.380 --> 3:55:16.380]  A divorce couple, we've got an article where this couple got a, got a right to a trial
[3:55:16.380 --> 3:55:18.620]  by jury over a cat because it was worth over $20.
[3:55:18.620 --> 3:55:21.140]  You get a trial by jury for a parking ticket.
[3:55:21.140 --> 3:55:22.660]  But they won't give it to us for a five kid.
[3:55:22.660 --> 3:55:25.180]  I said, isn't that convenient in the state of Florida?
[3:55:25.180 --> 3:55:28.900]  You don't have a right to a trial by jury for five kids, but you can get one over a
[3:55:28.900 --> 3:55:29.900]  cat.
[3:55:29.900 --> 3:55:30.900]  And see, people don't know that.
[3:55:30.900 --> 3:55:31.900]  They don't know these.
[3:55:31.900 --> 3:55:32.900]  It's insane.
[3:55:32.900 --> 3:55:34.380]  Have you seen my film, Endgame?
[3:55:34.380 --> 3:55:35.380]  No, I haven't.
[3:55:35.380 --> 3:55:39.500]  I need to send you a copy because we discovered, this is a mainline history, it was set up
[3:55:39.500 --> 3:55:41.500]  for eugenics courts.
[3:55:41.500 --> 3:55:46.340]  They would sterilize your kids and because they, juries wouldn't say that, they claimed
[3:55:46.340 --> 3:55:49.740]  it was a health department thing and just did it.
[3:55:49.740 --> 3:55:52.320]  That's where all this power comes from.
[3:55:52.320 --> 3:55:55.860]  That's why the nurses fill out the forms and the computer stuff when you're having
[3:55:55.860 --> 3:56:00.500]  babies at the hospital for the CPS on every family.
[3:56:00.500 --> 3:56:02.940]  Because it goes back to that eugenics, but go ahead.
[3:56:02.940 --> 3:56:05.660]  Well, there's got to be something we can do as an American people.
[3:56:05.660 --> 3:56:07.020]  Our rights don't come from the government.
[3:56:07.020 --> 3:56:08.020]  They come from God.
[3:56:08.020 --> 3:56:09.540]  We have a right to our kids.
[3:56:09.540 --> 3:56:13.820]  We have a right to our children and the children have a right to their kids.
[3:56:13.820 --> 3:56:15.500]  And we want our children back.
[3:56:15.500 --> 3:56:20.180]  And all I can do is ask your listeners to please pray and cry out that God will bring
[3:56:20.180 --> 3:56:23.620]  judgment on the state of Florida for the evil they're doing to people and their children.
[3:56:23.620 --> 3:56:25.860]  Now, they terminated your rights a year into this.
[3:56:25.860 --> 3:56:29.260]  You haven't seen them in three years.
[3:56:29.260 --> 3:56:33.460]  The government child kidnappers, again, name the names of the children they kidnapped.
[3:56:33.460 --> 3:56:37.180]  Hannah, Isaiah, Joanna, Susanna.
[3:56:37.180 --> 3:56:41.660]  My wife's been hiding with, we named our last baby, baby Moses, the one that they're after
[3:56:41.660 --> 3:56:42.660]  now.
[3:56:42.660 --> 3:56:47.900]  My wife's been hiding for two and a half years to keep the state from getting our children.
[3:56:47.900 --> 3:56:49.500]  Well, you know, that's a good point.
[3:56:49.500 --> 3:56:54.300]  Governments, the Aztecs, the Babylonians, the others, the Egyptians would routinely
[3:56:54.300 --> 3:56:57.220]  go steal the children of their local slave groups.
[3:56:57.220 --> 3:56:59.780]  So it's the same policy.
[3:56:59.780 --> 3:57:05.940]  So I just don't know, I mean, I wasn't here when the accident happened and neither was
[3:57:05.940 --> 3:57:07.540]  my other three kids.
[3:57:07.540 --> 3:57:09.660]  And I mean, we haven't done anything.
[3:57:09.660 --> 3:57:11.540]  We don't smoke, drink or do drugs.
[3:57:11.540 --> 3:57:12.540]  We love our country.
[3:57:12.540 --> 3:57:17.580]  Well, we know they target, we know they target Christian families, they've said that.
[3:57:17.580 --> 3:57:21.860]  People can support you by going to the website, donating there, getting the word out about
[3:57:21.860 --> 3:57:22.860]  it.
[3:57:22.860 --> 3:57:27.300]  If you hear this evil that happened to you, you're a great testament to war and others.
[3:57:27.300 --> 3:57:31.380]  And so I know that, you know, this has been a great tribulation for you, but God bless
[3:57:31.380 --> 3:57:32.380]  you.
[3:57:32.380 --> 3:57:33.380]  We'll be praying for you and your wife.
[3:57:33.380 --> 3:57:34.380]  Give out your website again.
[3:57:34.380 --> 3:57:35.380]  Okay.
[3:57:35.380 --> 3:57:38.340]  Alex, I want to thank you for your show, brother, and keep it up.
[3:57:38.340 --> 3:57:42.020]  FreeOurKids.com or FreeOurChildren.com.
[3:57:42.020 --> 3:57:44.260]  You can put kids or children, either one, it'll come up.
[3:57:44.260 --> 3:57:45.260]  You know what?
[3:57:45.260 --> 3:57:46.260]  Twenty minutes isn't enough.
[3:57:46.260 --> 3:57:51.500]  Let me set you up, let me set you up later this week or next week for a full hour, okay?
[3:57:51.500 --> 3:57:52.500]  All right.
[3:57:52.500 --> 3:57:53.500]  Let's get it out.
[3:57:53.500 --> 3:57:54.500]  You better take care of it.
[3:57:54.500 --> 3:57:55.500]  There he goes.
[3:57:55.500 --> 3:57:56.500]  It's not a joke.
[3:57:56.500 --> 3:57:57.500]  It's not a game.
[3:57:57.500 --> 3:58:00.100]  The lawless criminal government is absolutely engaged in every crime imaginable.
[3:58:00.100 --> 3:58:04.340]  Retransmission with a bunch of powerful news and information that was really powerful
[3:58:04.340 --> 3:58:09.140]  show today starts at infowars.com on the audio streams right now and the free podcast for
[3:58:09.140 --> 3:58:10.140]  everybody else.

[3:58:11.140 --> 3:58:22.660]  Thank you.
