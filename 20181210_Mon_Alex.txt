[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:11.000 --> 00:31.000]  the Info War.
[00:31.000 --> 00:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are, Monday, December 10th, 2018. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours in the War Room with Owen Shroyer and
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  Roger Jones coming up after that.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  David Knight, weekday mornings, 8am central, all times central.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  Okay, here's what's going on.
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  Obviously, we've got the really good news that Theresa May tried to bring forth this
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  traitorous so-called Brexit deal when they already voted two years ago to pull out of
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  the unelected EU.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  So she had a new capitulation deal that made them a total vassal state with no say on the
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  EU. Already, countries only have about 10% say that they would then have no say.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  And so now both political parties have turned against her, both the dominant parties, the
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  liberals and the Tories, the conservatives.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  So now she has pulled the vote.
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  She's not having the vote, which is seen as an even bigger humiliating failure because
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.000]  she knows then she would lose the vote and that the government itself has finally woken
[01:36.000 --> 01:37.000]  up and turned against her.
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  Now, what did I say two years ago when Brexit passed?
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  I said other countries have tried to vote to get out of the EU and they just ignore it
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  and say, oh, we've got to have another vote, got to have another vote.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  Or the few times they've let countries vote, whether they're going to enter the EU, most
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.000]  countries didn't even get a vote, Ireland did.
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  They voted no, so they just kept having new elections till they did.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  So I've learned the tactics.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  But you'll notice I said two years ago, I said, watch, they're going to try to block this
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  now and say it wasn't done properly or try to have other votes.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  And that'll just wake up the UK even more.
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  They're going to say, oh, look, Brexit failed.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  Oh, you nationalist see trying to wear us out.
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  But if we get the long game here and that if you go back 20 years ago, they weren't even
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  telling Europeans that the EU existed.
[02:23.000 --> 02:25.000]  They would say it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  When we said this trade deal is about to become a union and it's going to have its own army
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  and it's going to try to militarily not let you get out of it.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  And it's designed to implode your nation.
[02:37.000 --> 02:44.000]  That's because the founders of it had bragged before and it was a vassal plan of Hitler.
[02:44.000 --> 02:51.000]  Well, now you see the images of the EU blue armored vehicles, navy blue vehicles rolling
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  in, bringing in, you guessed it, foreign troops.
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000]  But all wearing face masks all concealed to suppress the French because the French
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  military and police wouldn't do it.
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  So for the first time since 1945, it's being reported in France, foreign multinational
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  contingent, some French, some German, some Dutch, you name it, rolled in.
[03:16.000 --> 03:17.000]  You heard me right.
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  Can we pull up the footage of Hitler touring France?
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  It only took him two weeks to take France because most of the generals had gotten on
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  his payroll and stood down on the British Expeditionary Force fought back.
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  So the French general staff stood down and two weeks later was given full command, but
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  they moved the capital from Paris to Vici in the south, which is why it's called Vici
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  collaborator French.
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  And then the French resistance flocked down.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  But see, it's easier than just fighting an army.
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  You just buy them off.
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  So Hitler a couple weeks after France was taken, he turned it.
[03:50.000 --> 03:56.000]  He visited Napoleon's grave and he left after just half a day there.
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  He had the Versailles caboose where the Versailles Treaty of World War I was signed by the
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Allies.
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  He had that destroyed.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  He had them signed their capitulation on the bus, on the caboose, and then he had it destroyed.
[04:12.000 --> 04:19.000]  So there's Hitler touring Paris and the Eiffel Tower and the Old Shure.
[04:19.000 --> 04:27.000]  And boy, his EU project now has tanks rolling down the streets of Paris.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  Isn't that just unbelievable?
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  And it's happening.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  But it's all backfired.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  Next year's news today.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  Find out why I'm the most censored man in the world.

[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  Because we've done the research.
[04:47.000 --> 04:55.000]  We have the context and we know how to drive a big fat, stinkin' stake through the globalist, filthy black eye.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  Spread the live links, resist the globalists.

[06:21.000 --> 06:31.000]  The Infowars Europe Euro Chief has been on the ground last few weeks in the Yellow Vast demonstrations that have brought the EU dictatorship to its knees.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  He's going to be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[06:34.000 --> 06:40.000]  Then Joey Gibson, he leads the National Prayer Group, goes out and simply prays in public as attacked by Antifa.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  Well, they're coming to confiscate guns without even warrants on the West Coast.
[06:44.000 --> 06:54.000]  He's got an emergency warning. We've got John Greenwald, theblackvolt.com, who got all those CIA Mind Control torture documents declassified last week.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  He's a big listener. We're honored to have him joining us.
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  And of course, Nick Baggage always on fire, but in studio. He's amazing.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  He was in studio last night and they're working with us on some big stuff.
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.000]  He's going to be in studio coming up, getting into the mind control technologies and all this that are rolling out.
[07:09.000 --> 07:14.000]  Mike Adams, fourth hour, always powerful. That is one hell of a transmission right there.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  And then it just continues with the war room.
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.000]  Oh, and Troyer and Roger Stone and boy, Roger's got some big news.
[07:20.000 --> 07:28.000]  He's going to be breaking here tomorrow and we'll be together tomorrow here in studio in a very special place.
[07:28.000 --> 07:33.000]  I'll leave it at that. And so you definitely want to join us tomorrow.
[07:33.000 --> 07:44.000]  Now, a lot of times when history is happening in a really big way, people don't recognize it until later.
[07:44.000 --> 07:53.000]  Hindsight's 2020. My job is historically looking at the globalist forces, the different power structures.
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.000]  Because the globalists are just the old empires, that same system.
[07:59.000 --> 08:05.000]  And then reading their own research, their own documents, what they're projecting, what they're building.
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  And then if you know that, you know what's going to happen because these folks are in control.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  Trump's trying to grab the wheel away from them and that's why they're freaking out so bad.
[08:15.000 --> 08:22.000]  Even if Trump was evil, if he wasn't one of them, they don't like him because he's trying to take their lollipop away.
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  That said, it's all perspective.
[08:27.000 --> 08:40.000]  And since 1945, there's not been foreign troops and foreign forces marching to the streets of Paris and other areas of France
[08:40.000 --> 08:46.000]  and physically arresting and attacking people who were standing up to the Nazis.
[08:46.000 --> 08:54.000]  But that's just what happened over the weekend with hundreds of big blue armored vehicles with multinational police
[08:54.000 --> 09:02.000]  from the European Union coming into France because the police and military were standing down in most areas.
[09:02.000 --> 09:15.000]  What an incredible report. It's in major French papers. Armored vehicles bearing EU flag storm downtown Paris and arrest and attack hundreds.
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  That's the oldest trick in the book. You know, when they had sent them in Square in 89, they brought Chinese from a thousand miles away in the north
[09:22.000 --> 09:30.000]  who even spoke a different dialect into the south because the local police wouldn't kill the peaceful demonstrators.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  There's a lot of them with their family.
[09:32.000 --> 09:40.000]  Well, now we've got armored vehicles with the EU symbol on them and it's confirmed multinational force because it's one EU.
[09:40.000 --> 09:50.000]  So German, Dutch, other troops with their face mask coming in to finally crush the Yellow Vest.
[09:50.000 --> 10:02.000]  Oh, but see, we're the EU now. We're not French. That's why Macron did not get sworn in to France's national anthem.
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  Imagine if Trump was getting sworn in and they played a North American Union theme.
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  There is one for the North American Free Trade Agreement. There is a song. You can pull it up.
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  Imagine if they played that song. You'd be like, what the hell is going on here?
[10:18.000 --> 10:25.000]  This is the traitor. This is the enemy. This is the problem.
[10:25.000 --> 10:41.000]  But instead, Macron snubs national French anthem, walks out to EU song after the win.
[10:41.000 --> 10:52.000]  Now, remember, he expanded on that. He said just recently that they want to bring in 200 plus million Muslims in the next two decades
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  and that Africa is the heart and the center of France.
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.000]  He actually said that. And he said that patriotism is not having a country.
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.000]  These are quotes. He said patriotism is the opposite of nationalism.
[11:09.000 --> 11:12.000]  You're like, that's saying two plus two equals one. That's crazy talk.
[11:12.000 --> 11:20.000]  So say that Africa is the heart of France and French ethos and culture. These are quotes.
[11:20.000 --> 11:26.000]  No, that's not true. That'd be places like Paris.
[11:26.000 --> 11:32.000]  But this is all part of the cucking, rubbing your face in it over and over again.
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  Do we have that with audio yet?
[11:37.000 --> 11:44.000]  Here it is. So he's playing Ode to Joy.
[11:44.000 --> 11:56.000]  They did not play the French anthem. And everyone in Europe knows what this is.
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  So, oh, I should add, who's conquered France in World War II?
[12:01.000 --> 12:12.000]  They've never played a German song that's basically the German archetypal national anthem.
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  It's not officially, but it might as well be. Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.000]  So he's playing a German song when they've been arch enemies for hundreds of years.
[12:26.000 --> 12:40.000]  He's playing a German song by Ludwig von Beethoven in front of the French and they're lapping it up.
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  You're like chopping your baby's legs off and the baby's like lapping its own blood up.
[12:44.000 --> 12:51.000]  I mean, this is the most asinine crap the world has ever seen, but it's called cucking.
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.000]  It's like these guys that get off on, you know, ten guys come in and like roughing their wife up and having sex with her in front of them.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  And some people are into that. Some women are into that.
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  You don't get to take our countries over and do it because it gets you off on it.
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  And they want to bankrupt France. They want to drive down its value.
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  They want to totally take control of the whole thing.
[13:12.000 --> 13:20.000]  And look, I don't care if Macron's gay or bisexual, but the whole issue is he was in a pedophile ring at age 13 on record.
[13:20.000 --> 13:30.000]  And he was sworn in with a giant black pyramid with a red all-seeing eye right behind his head.
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.000]  And Francois Mitterrand said the temple at the Louvre was to Lucifer.
[13:36.000 --> 13:47.000]  And it has 666 pieces of gold pink glass and a red all-seeing eye in the capstone.
[13:47.000 --> 13:55.000]  And this little monster, who admittedly was in elite sex parties at age 13, passed around as a sex toy,
[13:55.000 --> 14:02.000]  totally compromised, probably been mind-controlled, because we know the MO folks, totally programmed.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  Manchurian candidate, he fits it all.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  By the way, what got declassified last week?
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  MK Ultra documents.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  We have the man that got it declassified joining us coming up.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  And it's exactly what I told you.
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  And you're like, wow, why are all these governments doing mind control?
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  It goes back thousands of years ago.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  What do you think trauma-based mind control is?
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  What do you think the occult is?
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.000]  They called it religions, but it was systems of programming people, torturing them,
[14:29.000 --> 14:36.000]  drugging them, inducing them into your cult, giving small children hallucinogens,
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  having sex with them, killing other children in front of them,
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  traumatizing them, breaking off other personalities.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  This is the real world.
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  And I can tell you, at a gut-level analysis with all the facts I've got,
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  it's 100% that he was a pedophile sex toy.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  He admits that.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  They hide it in plain view.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  They can't hide it.
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  You didn't know that.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  Look it up.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  But what's really key is he was probably trauma-based mind control the way he acts,
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  the way he's so confident, but the way he's a total puppet and doesn't get everybody hates him.
[15:07.000 --> 15:13.000]  And now his approval rating is at 18%.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  And they whitewash it that he was 15 when he was a sex toy with the elites.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  No.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  The word is, even younger.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  We know at 13 he was at elite parties.
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  That's confirmed.
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  A 13-year-old being passed around, and he of course got a great job by 20
[15:27.000 --> 15:33.000]  at the most powerful Rothschild command bank in the world.
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.000]  They admit he did hang around with the Rothschilds as well.
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  Groomed by the Rothschilds to run France into the ground.
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  And now armored vehicles and foreign troops are parading around in Paris.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  Now when we come back, stock market's plunging, just like Trump told you,
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  because the Democrats have announced the plan to arrest our president.
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.000]  That's right.
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  We're in a fight, folks, all of us.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  At heart and body extract.
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.000]  Don't just take my word for it.

[17:27.000 --> 17:35.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:38.000 --> 17:44.000]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.000]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:49.000 --> 17:50.000]  Who do we fight for?
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  The deep state began with World War I.
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[17:56.000 --> 18:24.000]  Available at Amazon Books.

[20:22.000 --> 20:50.000]  All right, I just broke down if you've joined us, the incredible spectacle of UN, EU,
[20:50.000 --> 20:56.000]  World Government armored vehicles and thousands of foreign troops wearing black masks,
[20:56.000 --> 21:02.000]  beating and attacking the French standing up nationalistically against the globalists.
[21:02.000 --> 21:08.000]  With foreign troops suppressing a nationalist uprising that wishes to drive the globalist trader
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  that says France doesn't exist and is trying to raise giant carbon taxes
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  to pay foreign multinational corporations French money.
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.000]  And now they're using foreign troops to suppress them. That's all coming up.
[21:21.000 --> 21:26.000]  Because we have Dan Lyman joining us from France.
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  And we're going to show some of the compilations and amazing video that he got.
[21:29.000 --> 21:34.000]  He's been there reporting in the head of InfoWars Europe and that bureau we're building in Europe.
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.000]  Then I'm going to get to the really big issues.
[21:39.000 --> 21:44.000]  Trump said, you don't elect the Republicans in the House.
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  I guarantee you they're going to try to turn back the regulations that I removed
[21:48.000 --> 21:53.000]  and they're going to kill the economy. That's their plan and they've done it.
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  We're going to talk about that. And I've got all the clips.
[21:56.000 --> 22:01.000]  The knives are coming out.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  Now top Democrats are saying we're going to impeach the president.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  When he's out of office, we're going to criminally indict him.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  We're going to put him in prison.
[22:09.000 --> 22:16.000]  And there's no Russiagate now. All there is is two cash payments to girlfriends and women he associated with
[22:16.000 --> 22:22.000]  over 12 years ago. I guess 13, 14 years ago.
[22:22.000 --> 22:27.000]  And that's what the president said. He said, there you go.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  There's no Russiagate. So now you're going to do this.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  You say, well, why don't they indict Hillary for Russiagate and uranium one
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  and go after her for the missing kids out of Haiti and go after her for the paper play and all of it?
[22:39.000 --> 22:47.000]  Because Washington still thinks the deep state and Hillary and Obama and that group is going to remove Trump.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  They still think they'll defeat this nationalist movement.
[22:50.000 --> 22:56.000]  And so most people are either on the global side or they're staying out of it.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  They think that's the same thing to do.
[22:58.000 --> 23:07.000]  And there's so much bravada and arrogance and hutzpah by the globalists that they're able to really project that confidence
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  and con a lot of people into believing that in the end they're going to win.
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.000]  The Clintons can't get a thousand people out of their events now for free with massive hype.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  No one wants to come see them everywhere in the world.
[23:20.000 --> 23:27.000]  There's nationalist right wing, pro God, pro Christian, pro Renaissance movements that are unstoppable.
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  The tide is incontrovertible.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  You could try to hold it back for a while.
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  That'll just make it explode that much stronger.
[23:36.000 --> 23:45.000]  So from Russia to Brazil to France to the U.S. to everywhere, it's happening.
[23:45.000 --> 23:50.000]  So I don't get up here and put a confidence game on like the Democrats do constantly, just to sound confident.
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.000]  When I say we're in trouble, we're in trouble from my view.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  I say that when I believe it and I know it.
[23:56.000 --> 24:03.000]  But when I tell the globalists and I tell their minions, you're going to lose in the end one way or another.
[24:03.000 --> 24:07.000]  That's because history is on our side and all the facts point that direction.
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.000]  That doesn't mean that it's going to be one hell of a fight because here's what happens.
[24:13.000 --> 24:22.000]  Those of us that are willing to stand up and tell the truth because it's the right thing to do because we're not evil are punished and are targeted.
[24:22.000 --> 24:32.000]  But the punishment of having our children's future be a nightmare is a trillion times worse than what has to happen to us personally.
[24:32.000 --> 24:42.000]  And there's so many men out there that are totally unfulfilled because the world is not just about being flotsam and jetsam and standing for nothing or fantasy football.
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.000]  And women, it's not just about getting your nails done and I'm not saying you're bad if you want nice nails.
[24:47.000 --> 24:54.000]  I'm saying if that's your God and you'll sell out because you want to be a bigger peacock on a bigger perch.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  That's the wrong with big nice houses.
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.000]  But if that's your God, then that's why you're so unhappy.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  Now, I'm not saying that to our general audience. I know you know that.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  But there's a lot of new lists.
[25:05.000 --> 25:12.000]  There's a lot of people in the establishment that don't get why I don't back down and why the more they attack me, the more aggressive I get.
[25:12.000 --> 25:20.000]  It's because I haven't lost my basic instincts or my connection to God or common sense and it's not even a question.
[25:20.000 --> 25:27.000]  The worse you get, the more aggressive I get and the more fearless I get because it confirms everything we already knew.
[25:27.000 --> 25:37.000]  I mean, my God, you know, you think when I went to drudgerport.com at five a.m. when I woke up and saw the top headline up there.
[25:37.000 --> 25:46.000]  Sixty minutes major government study, $300 million study says smart phones are destroying children's brains.
[25:46.000 --> 25:54.000]  And then I went and I saw Anderson Cooper, one of the richest men in the world, this total globalist.
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.000]  He's way to five.
[25:55.000 --> 26:05.000]  He's the heir of five aristocratic families telling us now it's like 100 years after the new cigarettes gave you lung cancer, putting the thing on the side saying may give you lung cancer.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  Saying, oh, it might be bad for your kids.
[26:07.000 --> 26:16.000]  Folks, I was in 18 years ago, 19 years ago, allowed into the DARPA interface systems.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  And I didn't realize I had somebody letting me into classified stuff at the time.
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  It was all a big joke to him.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  I was kind of a joke at the time.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  He thought he go you want to see something.
[26:25.000 --> 26:32.000]  I've known this guy a few years, many parties and through mutual friends and he went on to work for even more elite university.
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  There's only one more elite when it gets to this.
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  And they know who it is.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  It was MIT.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  So he took me into these DARPA study areas.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  And this wasn't supersplacified.
[26:46.000 --> 26:47.000]  This was just restricted.
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.000]  But on each door and each lab area, it was funded by DARPA.
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  And he'd take me and he goes, you know, I'm not really supposed to take in here.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  Well, look at this.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  He'd show me this, show me that, show me this, show me that.
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  And to him, it was all a big joke because he was a guy running a bunch of this.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  And so he was always hearing me talk about the stuff.
[27:03.000 --> 27:12.000]  He thought it was hilarious because, you know, it's, you know, take Alex Jones and talks about all this and lead him right into the middle of it at the UT psychology department.
[27:12.000 --> 27:21.000]  He'd flip a switch, you know, and it'd be primate facilities in Bastrop with, you know, great apes and monkeys all hooked in with big flicker screens.
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.000]  And then there'd be another room where they'd pay women to masturbate and look up at a screen.
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  They'd put subliminal messages out and they'd have electrodes hooked up to there.
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  You know, they're genitals and then they take me in another room.
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.000]  And after about four hours of this, I'm like, this building, that building, I said, listen, I've seen enough of this.
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  He's like, really, you've seen enough of it.
[27:44.000 --> 27:57.000]  And the whole, almost the whole place was how to manipulate you through flicker rates and through screens and to go with what system would be the most destructive to mesmerize you, lower IQ.
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  Have you stopped communicating with people and totally controlling.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  So imagine, I don't go, oh, look, it's coming out.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  Anderson Cooper told us all about it.
[28:10.000 --> 28:17.000]  No, I go, I failed to cause a debate about this early on in all my films and all the articles, everything I wrote.
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  And now Anderson Cooper has the credibility to tell us we've already addicted you.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  We've already habituated it.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  We know it's too strong for you to pull out.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  But later we want the liability protection because they literally give you cancer.
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  They're 5G.
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  They brain damage you.
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.000]  They destroy your language skills.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  They ruin your life.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  You have no friends.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  It kills everything.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  And you think it's how you interface with your friends.
[28:38.000 --> 28:51.000]  But then Anderson Cooper, a conscious member of the leftist foundation CIA group with 500 billion in assets at least, shits up there and tells you about how he's going to protect your children.
[28:51.000 --> 28:56.000]  It's like shooting you in the head and giving you a bandaid.
[28:56.000 --> 29:25.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  Theme laser combo only at pugasalt.com.
[29:56.000 --> 30:03.000]  Everybody knows that history documents it.
[30:03.000 --> 30:09.000]  But there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history that wants to hurt children.
[30:09.000 --> 30:10.000]  They want to abort children.
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  They want to disease children.
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.000]  They want to abuse children.
[30:13.000 --> 30:14.000]  They want to confuse children.
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  They want their essence.
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.000]  They want their soul.
[30:17.000 --> 30:18.000]  They want their spirit.
[30:18.000 --> 30:21.000]  They want their power because they are our future.
[30:21.000 --> 30:25.000]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, not ultimate sacrifice.
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  It is about the West.
[30:27.000 --> 30:31.000]  It is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[30:31.000 --> 30:34.000]  So I just want to thank you all for your support.
[30:34.000 --> 30:45.000]  I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for Info Wars, and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[30:45.000 --> 30:47.000]  You have the power to override the sensors.
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  You have the power to stop the globalist dead in their tracks.
[30:50.000 --> 31:00.000]  I know you have been taken action, I salute you, but just remember, I know you are humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[31:00.000 --> 31:09.000]  Info Wars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[31:09.000 --> 31:11.000]  We have been proven dead on.
[31:11.000 --> 31:14.000]  You have been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project.
[31:14.000 --> 31:21.000]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do thank you and salute you. All words are not enough.
[31:21.000 --> 31:29.000]  Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies that you have been on target, promoting Americana and Renaissance,
[31:29.000 --> 31:33.000]  an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[31:33.000 --> 31:39.000]  They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other, but we have cut right to the chase.
[31:39.000 --> 31:44.000]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[31:44.000 --> 31:49.000]  And that's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that Info Wars really is your baby.
[31:49.000 --> 31:54.000]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to infowarsport.com
[31:54.000 --> 32:00.000]  and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding Info War, a true 360 win.
[32:00.000 --> 32:06.000]  In the last few months, Info Wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[32:06.000 --> 32:13.000]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off double-patriot points.
[32:13.000 --> 32:19.000]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[32:19.000 --> 32:28.000]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.000]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[32:32.000 --> 32:37.000]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[32:37.000 --> 32:40.000]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[32:40.000 --> 32:45.000]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[32:45.000 --> 32:48.000]  So this is a loss leader. We are losing money on this.
[32:48.000 --> 32:52.000]  This is our biggest sale ever. Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[32:52.000 --> 32:53.000]  And don't fight the crowds.
[32:53.000 --> 32:58.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or triple-eight-two-five-three-three-one-three-nine.
[32:58.000 --> 33:03.000]  God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[33:28.000 --> 33:36.000]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[33:36.000 --> 33:44.000]  So coming up after our Trump reporter, Dan Lyman, leaves us with an incredible footage he got of the EU invading armored vehicles.
[33:44.000 --> 33:50.000]  They're confirming local news, many of them foreign soldiers invading France to suppress French citizens.
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.000]  Just hiding in plain view, how incredible is that?
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.000]  The TV viewers, you'll get to see a lot of this HD footage that Dan Lyman shot and also show us some local news footage.
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.000]  And it's just ongoing, and it's threatening to cripple and bring down the whole unelected EU.
[34:03.000 --> 34:09.000]  Theresa May had no confidence, so she didn't go with the vote on her Brexit deal,
[34:09.000 --> 34:15.000]  because she knew the parliament was going to vote it down, because they handed over more power to the dictatorial EU.
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.000]  This is the heart of the New World Order in deep, deep trouble.
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  We're talking to Dan Lyman in a moment, who heads up the European arm of Info Wars.
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.000]  But first, we're also going to get into the screen time and the brain damage,
[34:29.000 --> 34:34.000]  and how it destroys emotional connections and how it lowers the emotional IQ.
[34:34.000 --> 34:40.000]  Now, it basically creates artificial Asperger's children, and it takes it from the television to the pad,
[34:40.000 --> 34:47.000]  and all of it's done to make you plug in to the modern matrix-like system.
[34:47.000 --> 34:54.000]  We'll be talking more about this with the man that first really exposed it, Dr. Nick Baggage, in studio in the third hour.
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.000]  But now, 60 Minutes has told you all about the MRIs they're doing, and what it's showing, and how it's hurting the children.
[35:01.000 --> 35:07.000]  After they know you're already hooked, and now they're having 5G and others to give you brain cancer.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  In fact, they do, but we're not going to stop.
[35:11.000 --> 35:21.000]  So now, 60 Minutes tells us about what we already knew decades ago, and they'll be celebrated and maybe get a Pulitzer Prize for it.
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  Now, we're also going to get into the really big issue.
[35:25.000 --> 35:31.000]  They're making their move to remove Trump, and you know they are because they picked Bimbo issues,
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  because both parties are involved in corruption with the Chai comms and others.
[35:35.000 --> 35:42.000]  So they don't want to go after Trump because there's nothing there with something that could hurt both parties in the establishment.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  They want to get him on limited things.
[35:44.000 --> 35:51.000]  So they got a stool pigeon who already said that Trump wasn't involved in knowing that they were using the campaign for payments,
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  and that Trump had paid for it in private transaction.
[35:54.000 --> 35:59.000]  Now a guy that's changed his testimony to get favorable sentencing, which they didn't even do,
[35:59.000 --> 36:09.000]  is now hinging on the whole future of the Republic of the World, and all the other corruption gets ignored.
[36:09.000 --> 36:16.000]  And they're all over the news saying Trump's going to serve jail time to discredit the presidency and just scare everybody.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  So the markets do what?
[36:18.000 --> 36:25.000]  They go down, up, up, up, up, they went, and all the jobs pouring back in, you can't allow that.
[36:25.000 --> 36:31.000]  So talk down the stock market, say the president's going to be arrested, raise interest rates, that's another present the globalists have given you.
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.000]  Just as Trump warned, stock market is up massively since election, but it's now taking a little pause.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  People want to see what happens with the midterms.
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  If you want your stocks to go down, I strongly suggest you vote Democrat.
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  They like the Venezuelan financial model, high taxes and open borders.
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  Oh, and it gets better.
[36:49.000 --> 36:57.000]  Democrat Alexander Cortez, the poster girl for ignorance, said that she's a woman so she can run for president at 29.
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.000]  No, it says men and women in the Constitution, dumbo, 35.
[37:01.000 --> 37:14.000]  And, but now she threatened Donald Trump Jr., Donald Trump Jr. tweeted out about his dad and said,
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.000]  what everybody already knows, and we can put this on screen.
[37:19.000 --> 37:22.000]  Why are you so afraid of socialist economy?
[37:22.000 --> 37:28.000]  Trump, because Americans want to walk their dogs, not eat them.
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  And how does he respond?
[37:29.000 --> 37:37.000]  She said, I have subpoena power and you're going to get in big trouble as soon as I get in office.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  We're going to have your ass thrown in jail.
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  That's right.
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.000]  You don't talk back to her.
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.000]  You don't point out that there's no dogs in North Korea or Venezuela because everybody had to eat them.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  Or Cuba literally is collapsing.
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  No, just threaten everybody.
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.000]  Now let me stop right there.
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.000]  It takes a lot of money to be able to have reporters in Europe, to fly people around to cover Bilderberg,
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.000]  to have reporters down there with the illegal alien caravan coming across in the first document.
[38:07.000 --> 38:12.000]  Six years ago, Info Wars was the first. It takes a lot of money to fight Soros and the globalists
[38:12.000 --> 38:18.000]  because they know nine times out of ten, Info Wars is first to break critical news no one else will cover.
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  So they want to shut down.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  That's why I need financial support.
[38:21.000 --> 38:22.000]  I want to expand.
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  I want to be able to hire a larger team.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  I'm in court next week.
[38:28.000 --> 38:35.000]  Next week, here in Austin, I've agreed to be deposed for the Pepe the Frog deal.
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  Some artists made a poster of icons of the election, Trump, myself, Matt Rudge,
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  little Pepe the Frog thing up there.
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.000]  Hillary Clinton's law firm, it's a termine law firm, sues me for copyright infringement.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  They said, give us the $26,000 you're made on.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  I said, well, actually we only had about $15,000 if we paid the artist.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  They said, well, just give us that and we'll drop it.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  And I said, no.
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.000]  You filed a fake lawsuit saying we don't let white supremacists use the frogs.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  You can say I'm a white supremacist.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  There's a way to have that in the news and defame me.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  You're lucky I'm not suing you.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  And then you say I've stolen it.
[39:13.000 --> 39:18.000]  When it turns out a guy actually made it down in Brazil and it turns out that the guy here in the U.S.
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  said back in 2015 in a Daily Dot interview, everybody can use this.
[39:22.000 --> 39:23.000]  It's free.
[39:23.000 --> 39:24.000]  Use it.
[39:24.000 --> 39:25.000]  He gave him a license.
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.000]  You know, he didn't have it.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  They can say it's a trolling operation.
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.000]  You know, or these sites say, here's our photos.
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  Use them.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  But the fine print says, but in one year, you owe us this much money.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  That's free till a year from now.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  I don't know what this guy's doing, this fury fellow.
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  But I've got to go, not be on air, and I've got to pay lawyers.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  But I've made that decision.
[39:42.000 --> 39:49.000]  I'm not going to pay him $15,000 when it was a composite image of public commentary.
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  What's happening in the world.
[39:50.000 --> 39:51.000]  It's political.
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.000]  It's totally protected.
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  I'm not putting out Peppy the Frog action figures.
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  He told everybody they could use it.
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  A lot of evidence looks like it's not even his.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  So I'm trying to free Peppy the Frog.
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  People say, well, why are you fighting all these fronts?
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  I'm just, I'm going to fight everything from now on.
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  Period.
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  And I'm either going to succeed or I'll be destroyed in the process, but that's okay.
[40:14.000 --> 40:20.000]  Because I'm an example to others and the information we put out, it goes on forever and it's winning.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  It'd be nice if I can have my cake and eat it too.
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  Believe me, I'm not a nihilist.
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  I'm not somebody that wants to just be destroyed.
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.000]  I'm doing this because I know it's the only sure course for my children and your children.
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  So I want to thank you for joining us in this epic fight.
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.000]  We're coming back to Dan Lyman for this segment and the next, but let me just say this to you very clearly right now.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  We have the very best products.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  We have the very best information.
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  That's why we're the most man broadcast, the most demonized in the world.
[40:46.000 --> 40:57.000]  And I don't say that happily, but in a way I've got to be a little bit satisfied to know that if you're going to be on the Declaration of Independence, sign your John Hancock big and bold.
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.000]  Because it's either the warrant of our children's destiny and future being good, or it's our death warrants.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  So I'm in this all the way.
[41:03.000 --> 41:08.000]  I appreciate you being our affiliates, our listeners, all of you, my crew.
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  I love you all.
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  But it's simple.
[41:10.000 --> 41:16.000]  If you do your Christmas shopping at infowarsstore.com, you'll get incredible deals, amazing products.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  You won't fight the traffic and the lines and you will allow us to go into the future.
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  You have unlimited power.
[41:23.000 --> 41:29.000]  When it comes to funding this operation, we know it is a 2% maybe ever buys anything that listens.
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.000]  And that's fine.
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  And we want to thank the 2%.
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.000]  Just like the Revolutionary War, you know, the military has the 3% pass.
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.000]  It was about 3%.
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.000]  I actually started it, fought in it, won it, and then did it all.
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  3%.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  Towards the end, they got some folks helping them and things.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  So again, it's 2%, 3% doing it.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  So I want to commend the 3%.
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  But I want to tell all the rest of you out there who do spread the word and watch the show and the rest of it.
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  It makes you kind of feel like you're doing something you listen.
[41:54.000 --> 41:59.000]  It's kind of like people at a, you know, fat farm conference sneaking snicker bars at the break.
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.000]  Mike Adams sent me a text.
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.000]  He's, it's a great point he made saying that.
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  And then they can kind of live vicariously through what we're doing here.
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  Listen, that's great.
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  I appreciate you just listening.
[42:09.000 --> 42:15.000]  But if you don't start taking action, spreading the word, telling folks about the local station you listen to, buying some of the products,
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  signing up to the free email list, and then resending articles and videos we send you.
[42:19.000 --> 42:25.000]  If you don't actually get in the game, we're going to lose this because this is not a spectator sport.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  This all revolves around you.
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  Let me pull up that Mike Adams text.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  He said it's so much more better than I just babbled it.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  And it's a really, really good point.
[42:33.000 --> 42:41.000]  But we've got free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off, double page rate points and every order gets a free t-shirt.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  And so that's all going right now.
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.000]  I think of the phenomenon all of us are dealing with.
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  When we come back, I'll read this down the line.
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  But it's really important.
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  Please financial support us and get great products.
[42:55.000 --> 43:18.000]  We'll see you in the next one.
[43:26.000 --> 43:32.000]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health and cognitive health,
[43:32.000 --> 43:37.000]  aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.000]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas,
[43:41.000 --> 43:47.000]  we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high quality krill oil concentrate,
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  paired with our ultimate fish oil, or used separately.
[43:49.000 --> 43:56.000]  It's time to see what krill oil can do for you with ultimate krill oil, now available at infowarsstore.com.
[44:19.000 --> 44:24.000]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[44:24.000 --> 44:25.000]  You are the info ward.
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.000]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[44:29.000 --> 44:34.000]  that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[44:34.000 --> 44:41.000]  so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[44:41.000 --> 44:46.000]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[44:49.000 --> 44:55.000]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[44:55.000 --> 44:59.000]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[44:59.000 --> 45:06.000]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals.
[45:10.000 --> 45:20.000]  Please consider a contribution. 25, 50, 100, 250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here
[45:20.000 --> 45:25.000]  to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship
[45:25.000 --> 45:51.000]  in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  Now, it's the infowars official app taken on the globalist at Point Blank Range,
[45:55.000 --> 46:00.000]  and with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018.
[46:04.000 --> 46:10.000]  Infowars is proud to introduce the 12 days of Christmas, and it's bigger than any previous sale before,
[46:10.000 --> 46:17.000]  as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[46:17.000 --> 46:23.000]  So get great products and help fund the info war right now with the 12 days of Christmas that is special
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  amongst a group of incredible sales.

[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  The truly is the Christmas spirit.
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.000]  When you shop at infowarsstore.com, you don't just get incredible sales during the 12 days of Christmas.
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.000]  You fund the very tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[46:40.000 --> 46:47.000]  Today's 24 hour only special at infowarsstore.com is our ultimate turmeric formula.
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  Bodies is now 60% off at infowarsstore.com.
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  2018 has been an incredible year.
[46:53.000 --> 46:58.000]  As we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you all again for making the entire info war possible.
[46:58.000 --> 47:11.000]  Again, you are the resistance.
[47:28.000 --> 47:42.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[47:42.000 --> 47:47.000]  What we are looking at, good and evil, right and wrong.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  Dan Lyman, incredible reporter on Twitter at Citizen Analyst.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  Be sure and follow him there.
[47:53.000 --> 48:00.000]  He got the video, some of the best video of the dark blue armored vehicles.
[48:00.000 --> 48:05.000]  Hundreds and hundreds of them, dozens together converging in on different parts of the city of Paris.
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  Attacking French citizens who are against the carbon tax, the open borders and globalism.
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  And now it's spreading all over Europe.
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.000]  Oh, and Bloomberg's reporting the Russians may be involved.
[48:17.000 --> 48:25.000]  George Soros has a bot machine dashboard that sites download and then it tells you what's Russian and what isn't.
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.000]  He says I'm a Russian agent, so they have congressional hearings and set it and took me off most of the internet.
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.000]  So again, George Soros says the moon's made of cheese, it is.
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  And they're moving to arrest Trump.
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  We'll get into that next hour.
[48:40.000 --> 48:48.000]  Never a source of being boring.
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.000]  Alexander Cortez now says she's Jewish because of all of her Palestinian anti-Israel stuff.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  Now suddenly like Pocahontas, the name of American will now Cortez from Puerto Rico.
[48:56.000 --> 49:01.000]  She says that she learned that dozens of generations ago there was Sephardic Jews in her background.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  None of her family knows this, but she learned it.
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.000]  So this is all part of the endless lying out of this lady's mouth.
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  That's all coming up. But Dan Lyman has gotten the incredible footage.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  He was spent days there in Paris.
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  Of course, you can read his work at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[49:17.000 --> 49:24.000]  But you can also go to the Europe link there and I'll put that on screen for folks in a minute.
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  But Dan, great job and thanks for being here.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  I'm glad you're safe.
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  Thank you very much. Good to be with you as well, Alex, and also good to be home.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  You're back in Switzerland now.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  Just got back, yeah.
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.000]  You've got the floor. Tell us what you witnessed, what you saw, and the EU admits they think this may bring them down.
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.000]  I mean, the nationalism is spreading everywhere and exploding in France.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  It is true and it is definitely exploding. Good usage of the term.
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  It was quite an eventful weekend.
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.000]  I went in not really knowing what to expect beyond reviewing the videos from the previous weekends.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  And it did not disappoint in terms of action.
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.000]  It was definitely a, it was a live battlefield in many ways.
[50:03.000 --> 50:12.000]  And you had to keep your head on a swivel at all times because it was just chaotic moments broken up by kind of tense moments where you're just kind of waiting for the next thing to happen.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  And it was just a nonstop action.
[50:15.000 --> 50:22.000]  Dan, get into it because again, for people who don't know the history of the EU and how nationalist these countries are,
[50:22.000 --> 50:28.000]  to have EU armored vehicles when the regular military police stood down in most areas of the Yellow Vests the last three weeks.
[50:28.000 --> 50:35.000]  And now to see these armored vehicles, even some of the French papers pointed out, wow, this is a multinational EU army that they've been talking about.
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  Here it is.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  Yeah, there are concerns about that.
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  Now, I did end up seeing some of these armored vehicles.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  I was on the lookout for them throughout the day.
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  And then in the evening, as you'll see in this shot right here, I did get a chance.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  This is on Champs-Élysées.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  It was under de facto martial law at this point.
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  They had all the inroads kind of sealed off.
[50:55.000 --> 50:59.000]  We managed to make our way down there with there only a couple of folks down there.
[50:59.000 --> 51:08.000]  And then they were lining up facing the Arc de Triomphe and they lined up all these armored vehicles and the riot vehicles as well with the plows on the front.
[51:08.000 --> 51:13.000]  And then eventually they just made their way towards the Triomphe looking for looking for trouble.
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  I mean, it was definitely a tense situation.
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  There was all sorts of violence on from all sides.
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  And so I can see why, you know, you'd want a response to keep the calm.
[51:25.000 --> 51:35.000]  But seeing these EU flagged vehicles with no French logos on them whatsoever was definitely disturbing to say the least.
[51:35.000 --> 51:41.000]  We've also got Macron being sworn in to the German music.
[51:41.000 --> 51:47.000]  Beethoven's Ode to Joy, unprecedented rubbing it in their faces.
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  They hate this guy.
[51:49.000 --> 51:58.000]  You know, I didn't know what to expect in terms of, like, if they really would be anti-Macron or if they would be anti-EU or what the sentiment would be on the ground.
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.000]  A lot of these people, they used their vests to write statements on them.
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.000]  And the vast majority of the statements that I saw were anti-Macron statements.
[52:06.000 --> 52:16.000]  And they would get thousands of people chanting at a time Macron, Dimitron, which I guess it roughly equates to resign Macron or Macron's resignation.
[52:16.000 --> 52:21.000]  There's graffiti, you know, all over the place, spray painted, you know, Macron's got to go, stuff like that.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  So they definitely hate this guy.
[52:23.000 --> 52:28.000]  And it just makes me wonder how he did so well in the election.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  But of course, that that's up for debate as well.
[52:30.000 --> 52:35.000]  But I would think that if they had elected someone like Le Pen, things might be in better shape there.
[52:35.000 --> 52:38.000]  And of course, she's leading in the polls.
[52:38.000 --> 52:45.000]  We see the Nationalist Party winning in Germany, winning in Spain, winning in Italy, winning in Greece,
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.000]  winning in Brazil, winning in Russia first with Putin.
[52:48.000 --> 52:49.000]  That's why they hate him.
[52:49.000 --> 52:57.000]  He is domino number one with the Nationalist kicking oligarchs out, kicking the foreign globalist out with a huge carbon tax.
[52:57.000 --> 53:05.000]  I know France already has the most expensive gasoline in Europe, but it roughly adds something like a euro or a dollar to every leader.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[53:07.000 --> 53:15.000]  Yeah, it's I lived in Iceland for a while and we were paying about $8 a gallon there and I didn't think that that was possible to many other places.
[53:15.000 --> 53:19.000]  But I do believe that French prices are approaching that.
[53:19.000 --> 53:25.000]  I think it's somewhere over $7 a gallon if that tax had stayed in place or if implemented.
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.000]  It's just, I mean, you can't go anywhere with that, that kind of charge on fuel.
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  And in addition, I think a lot of these people are just hurting in general.
[53:33.000 --> 53:39.000]  They're so overtaxed and, you know, I have to say, I met a lot of these yellow vesters and was around a lot of them.
[53:39.000 --> 53:42.000]  And myself, I know I've worked in construction.
[53:42.000 --> 53:47.000]  I've worked a lot of blue collar jobs in the past, painting, roofing, and I understood these people.
[53:47.000 --> 53:56.000]  I could feel, you know, the majority of them who they are, they're blue collar workers, middle class, lower middle class people just trying to work and earn an honest living.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  I would say a lot of these people are not from Paris.
[53:58.000 --> 54:04.000]  They come in from the surrounding towns and countryside to voice their disapproval with what's going on there.
[54:04.000 --> 54:07.000]  And I really felt like I identified with a lot of these people.
[54:07.000 --> 54:13.000]  Of course, there are bad actors within the group and there are people that are kind of hijacking it as well for their own purposes.
[54:13.000 --> 54:21.000]  Sure, but in addition to just bad actors in general who just making the most of the chaos,
[54:21.000 --> 54:30.000]  there were a lot of people that I observed who were either apprehended or were committing acts that were definitely worthy of apprehension that were not wearing yellow vests.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  They were just capitalizing on the chaos.
[54:33.000 --> 54:37.000]  And let's be clear, Macron came in as a nationalist control the borders.
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  Then he said patriotism is not having a country.
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.000]  The worst form of patriotism is being a nationalist.
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.000]  These are quotes.
[54:44.000 --> 54:49.000]  He said, we want 200 million more Africans brought in the next 20 years because that's our culture.
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  And then he's doing all this.
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  The average tax is over 80% in France.
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  So the people are literally in hell.
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  And the OECD, the globalist group says this.
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.000]  France is the model.
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  Most of the EU bureaucrats obviously have been caught not even paying taxes.
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.000]  They have laws written where the EU bureaucrats are exempted EUI tax.
[55:08.000 --> 55:09.000]  No one else is.
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  I mean, it's joke level how this unelected body does this.
[55:12.000 --> 55:18.000]  And here it is saying, if you have nationalist uprisings, try to kick our policies out of carbon taxes.
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  No single family dwellings.
[55:20.000 --> 55:23.000]  I mean, this is all EU world government policy.
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  We will send in an EU army to stop you.
[55:25.000 --> 55:31.000]  If Italy uses its navy to stop Soros funded rubber boats being brought across bringing in Islamic invaders.
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  We'll have our military board you and stop you.
[55:34.000 --> 55:40.000]  These are public statements that the EU will use its military to stop nation states that don't follow its order.
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  This is insane.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  England never voted to be part of it.
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.000]  It's part of it.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  It's the same thing with France and others.
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  And so that's why this is so huge.
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.000]  And I don't see this populist wave worldwide being stopped, Dan Lyman.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  And I see what we see here in France.
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  Even the EU says they believe this could quote bring down Europe.
[55:59.000 --> 56:00.000]  Well, this isn't Europe.
[56:00.000 --> 56:06.000]  The EU is a criminal corporate cabal looting Europe and opening it up for invasion.
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  Absolutely.
[56:07.000 --> 56:14.000]  And if if Paris is the model for the rest of the world and we got problems because Paris is a wreck aside from all of this stuff.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  I mean, I took a couple of long rides through the city coming in from the airport and it's occupied territory.
[56:19.000 --> 56:26.000]  It's your hard press to see someone that you might think is a French person walking the streets in a lot of these neighborhoods.
[56:26.000 --> 56:36.000]  In addition, I got to lay eyes firsthand on some of these tent cities that are that are going up all around the city just entire areas that are occupied by homeless foreigners.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  And there's nothing done about them.
[56:38.000 --> 56:44.000]  There's nothing being done to mitigate them except once in a while they'll sweep them out and they'll just, you know, re congregate in another area.
[56:44.000 --> 56:55.000]  So anyone who wants a glimpse of what the future could look like if you let your own city or town fall to this agenda, just go to Paris and spend a few days there and you will regret it immensely.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  By the way, my parents like to go to Europe at least once a year.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  They've been doing it for 40 years.
[57:00.000 --> 57:08.000]  They've been to Europe at least 35, 40 times and they will not go anywhere in France anymore.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  Everyone I know that lives in France is moving out.
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  A lot of areas of Italy you can't go to anymore.
[57:13.000 --> 57:20.000]  A lot of areas of England, the people they know in England when they have friends that live there will not go into London.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  It's just incredible what the globalists have done.
[57:23.000 --> 57:30.000]  They have brought in literally the lowest IQ, dumbest poorest people of the third world.
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.000]  So they've exported and imported the worst people statistically on the planet.
[57:35.000 --> 57:41.000]  A bunch of military aged men, homeless, inbred, mentally retarded in many cases,
[57:41.000 --> 57:47.000]  running around foaming at the mouth, crapping all over the ground and raping people and 90 plus percent never get a job.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  They just walk around crapping.

[58:44.000 --> 58:47.000]  I want to thank you all again for making the entire info war possible.
[58:47.000 --> 58:50.000]  Again, you are the resistance.
[58:50.000 --> 58:57.000]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important info wars is in the fight against the anti-human globalist.
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  So let's say it's short and sweet.
[58:59.000 --> 59:01.000]  We are your support now more than ever.
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  You come through a thousand times.
[59:03.000 --> 59:04.000]  I'm not bitching at you.
[59:04.000 --> 59:07.000]  I'm just simply telling you we are in the thick of the battle now.
[59:07.000 --> 59:13.000]  The attacks on info wars have become absolutely exponential and down the road we probably will get destroyed.
[59:13.000 --> 59:19.000]  But I know and God has really put it on my heart that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible
[59:19.000 --> 59:26.000]  and go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[59:28.000 --> 59:33.000]  I need to be provisioned and I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds and all these double worshipers.
[59:33.000 --> 59:38.000]  But I need your prayers, I need you to spread the articles and videos, I need you to give us financial support right now.
[59:38.000 --> 59:39.000]  We make it easy.
[59:39.000 --> 59:46.000]  Do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the globalists and not with Bezos and Amazon and you'll help provision us.
[59:46.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  We've got a bunch of huge deals at m4store.com so please take action right now.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  You take a model man.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  Alright Dan Lyman, info wars reporter.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  We really should get him on every week.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  He heads up info wars Europe.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  He's coaching Europe.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  Let's put the URL on screen because I have to be honest with you.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  We launched info wars Europe and then I'm always just clicking on it on my site.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  I have it saved.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  I'm never looking at the URL.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  So it's the URL, not just the site I want to show.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  It's the URL, not just the site I want to show.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  What's the best way for people to get to info wars Europe?
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  Dan.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  I just want to remember is Europe Wars dot com.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  But of course you can do Europe dot info wars dot com.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  Europe Wars dot com will redirect to the site properly.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  Absolutely.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  So Europe Wars dot com.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  Listen, I'm teleprompter free.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  I'm 45.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  I used to have a photographic memory.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  I just literally half the times can't remember what's going on.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  But I think that's also just part of having so many moving parts at once.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  Dan, it's just it's the world seems to be quickening right now.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  It sure does.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  It's like, you know, I heard George Papadopoulos has already added jail.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  So that means he's served for two weeks.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  That seems like it was like just a couple of days ago that that was being announced.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  So the quickening is definitely happening and the news never slows down.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  It's just getting crazier.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  Dan, in a few minutes we have left here.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  What are you observing in Europe?
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  What are you seeing?
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  What would you call this period we're in?
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  Because huge nationalism, huge awakening, really positive things.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  But then the floodgates of globalist money and the Chai Khan influence in Hollywood
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  just has unleashed its full wrath and shown us just how bad these people are.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  What would you call this struggle and where would you say we're at?
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  Wow, we are definitely at the beginning of something major.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  This is just the beginning in Paris.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  This is obviously starting to catch fire across Western Europe.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  One of the most poignant videos I saw from the weekend was actually from the Yellow Vest
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  protests in Brussels.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  These people were attempting to storm the big European Union building.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  And I thought that that was very symbolic because if that is accomplished, maybe the
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  next time they try it, it probably will be pretty violent.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  But if for any reason that's caught on video and it happens, that will be a symbolically
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  devastating blow to the EU and the global's agenda to see the people that every day,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  forgotten men and women just storming one of their bastions of globalism.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  And we hope for peace, definitely.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  But these protests are pretty violent.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  A lot of the police are very heavy handed.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  I've seen some pretty disturbing videos.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  One of the most disturbing things I saw this weekend myself was we were kind of standing
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  with the crowds and then every once in a while something major happens and everyone goes rushing
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  in a direction to get away from a flash bang or tear gas.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  So we're standing there against the wall and I'm observing along Champs-Élysées.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  And the crowd starts rushing and one guy goes running by me with blood pouring down his
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  face and it looked like something major had happened to his eye or above his eye.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  And right after that, a projectile hit right above my head against the wall.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  And I just started running with everybody else and I started thinking, man, are they really
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  firing, you know, probably non-lethal rounds or something like that into the crowd?
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  And it did turn out there was some video evidence that suggested that one girl had indeed lost
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  her eye by being shot by something by the police and then I was in a cafe the next day
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  and the waiter there said he observed another man who had his eye blown out by a non-lethal round
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  by police near the Arc de Triomphe in front of his restaurant.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  There have been just, it's been kind of gory and I hope that some of these police officers
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  that they think twice before they do this, but I don't know if they will because some of them
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  are definitely good guys.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  They mean well and they're just trying to do their job.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  Some of them are just like mercenaries for the EU.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  Some of the really the roughest guys were undercover.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  They were roaming in packs.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  They were big guys with, you know, they had, they were fully armed and they were taking
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  people down very aggressively and there was very little indicator as to who they worked for.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  And you've got EU armored vehicles and it's come out, some of them from outside France
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  for the first time since Hitler was kicked out in 1945.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  We have foreign EU troops in France attacking the public, just blowing their eyes out, all of this.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  But the good news is Macron is going to have to resign.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  He's had to back off on the carbon tax.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  The one place they thought they could get it through and they failed.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  Dan Lyman, A-plus.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  God bless you.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  You're an amazing reporter.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  I'm so blessed that the audience supports us so we can fund your great work.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  I know you're expanding as well, building our European bureaus.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  So Dan, everybody should follow you right now at Twitter at Citizen Analyst. We'll be right back.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  All their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  We have those incredible sell prices back at InfowarsTour.com.

[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  They've got three-month supplies, your supplies, weak emergency supplies.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  Maybe you got a three-year supply.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  InfowarsTour.com and Infowars Select, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my Patreon supply.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  Wow, if you just joined us Infowars Europe head, Dan Lyman, EuropeWars.com.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  The quickest way to get there, EuropeWars.com.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  He was just on with us and he was getting into the French police, French military.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  A lot of them standing down.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  They brought in armored vehicles with the EU insignias.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  A lot of them weren't even French.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  They were German others and they began to shoot the eyes out with rubber bullets of men and women on purpose.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  Dan witnessed multiple people with their eyes shot out in front of him.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  And Paris is on fire.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  These are nationalists.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  They're targeting leftist facilities and EU facilities.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  And in Brussels, they tried to storm the EU command base, the unelected EU dictatorship.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  They've also been storming in Germany and other areas.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  The Yellow Vest movement is exploding.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  It's absolutely exploding and it shows how much trouble the EU globalist program is under.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  Now, Joey Gibson, who heads up the prayer group that Antifa comes out in the tax hold of the country,
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  he's got some really serious news for us coming up next segment.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  Where you've heard about these red flagging operations in Oregon and in other Democrat-controlled areas on the East Coast as well.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  Where someone just says, hey, I think that person's a danger.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  They didn't make a threat.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  Nothing.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  It's beyond the Baker Act, where somebody just says, I think they need to be looked at for 24 hours.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  You could grab and take them to a mental institution like Kanye West for a week because he liked Trump.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  Now they're just doing it to gun owners period.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  So it's beyond doxing.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  They just say it.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  I think they shouldn't have guns and your guns are taken and you usually don't even get them back.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  And if you don't turn them over, there's actually been deaths now.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  They kill you.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  So gun confiscation is happening.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  We're going to be talking to him here in just a moment at the latest on Antifa and more.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  Now, I mentioned this at the start of the broadcast and it's so big.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  I don't know how to really get into it properly, but I'm going to try as best I can.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  We're going to go to break and come back with our guest.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  They're making their move on the president.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  The president said, if you don't elect the Republicans in the house, they're going to try to roll back our reforms, bring all the regulations back that are designed to shut us down.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  They're going to signal that you can't invest here in America and it's going to tank the economy along with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  Whereas the sun came up this morning, the Dow was down almost 400 points and we'll give you those numbers right now.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  The latest on the Dow, if you can put that on screen for TV viewers.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  This is a diabolical concerted effort of economic terrorism to kill our economy.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  Dow's down 406 points right now and went even lower earlier, 450 something points earlier.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  So this is a very, very, very, very serious situation.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  The globalists are saying, we're going to kick Trump out, we're going to arrest him.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  When you get the head of the Intelligence Committee, Peter Schiff, when you've got all these different Democrats coming out, you've got Republicans, Adam Schiff.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  When you've got all these people saying that the President is a criminal, no judge, no jury, that kills the markets.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  Now you've got Michael Cohen, who pled guilty to $50 million in laundered money at a taxi cab company that he was part of.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  Trump has zero connection to it.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  And you've got him coming into these recordings, obviously trying to set the President up a long time ago.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  Sounds like Cohen's been in trouble for years.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  Coming in saying, hey, we're going to make that pay off through the campaign.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  And Trump goes, no, you're not, no, you're not.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  That's been aired as if it's the proof.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  Then Cohen goes, takes Trump's money and pays it through the campaign.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  So it's not campaign money.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  They just did it through the campaign so that it wouldn't have Trump's name on it.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  So this is what they're threatening to bring the entire country down.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  Not Russian collusion like Hillary, not Chinese collusion like Hillary or Mueller, but no.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  Giving some money to old girlfriends 10, 12, 13, 14 years ago.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  Cohen doing that three years ago.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  Total setup.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  He first says none of it happened.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  Now that he's going to go to prison, now he starts saying it totally discredited.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  A guy facing a sentence who's been caught lying a known snake.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  And so to get the President, they're now all over the news saying Trump's buddy has been indicted.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  Trump's going down.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  He's going to jail because Adam shifts on TV, then coming out of the intelligence committee.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  You've got all the other Democrats, all the other Carl Bernstein, the rest of it saying it's the end to kill the markets.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  Remember what Bill Maher said, we're going to tank the stock market to hurt Trump supporters.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  If we don't kill the market, Trump's going to succeed.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  He's going to show that we've been purposely suppressing the economy to get Americans into debt.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  That's how they're conquering us.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  The service economy.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  Now that's going away.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  Trump dares to challenge that and the world believes, wow, we can turn this around.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  And then the establishment steps in and says, nope, they steal the election, admit they steal it.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  Trump has a bunch of weak people around him because he can't find anybody that's not a coward.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  And it sends the signal that they may be able to take Trump out.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  And so the recovery dies right in front of your eyeballs.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  Just like Trump said, you want a debt economy.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  They sure want one as well.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  That's their model.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  See, this way look could have had their people prosperous and wealthy, but the communists wouldn't have been in charge.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  It's the same thing everywhere.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  They want you poor to control you.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  And that's why they've got all the impeachment talk on all the networks.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  And that's why they've got everyone saying Trump's a criminal and Trump's going to go to jail.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  And all these people saying this because they're the enemies of this country.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  They're the ones that sold us out to the chai comms and the globalists.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  They're the ones that say you can't have a nation and that nationalism is evil.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  And they're the ones that say families are bad.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  They're the ones that are trying to demoralize you.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  And then Trump who wants prosperity and who believes in men and women having relationships and who is like a cornucopia of success.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  He comes in a step in their way and they are on a jihad because they know if he succeeds in prosperity, it's over for them.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  So they're working to destroy Trump and destroy your financial future and your 401k and your social security.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  They're going to take everything you've got.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  And when they implode the economy, they're going to come in with giant rescue packages of tens of trillions more to the megabanks so they can only move us down the same path as France.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  Consolidating control, eradicating the middle class.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  You think about that.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  They are now on the news saying this president is going to serve jail time.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  People say, oh, well, Trump's saying they deserve jail.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  Yeah, but you have to understand they have the Democrat Republican Party establishment has chopped full, chopped full of traders and cowards and everyone who is scratching each other's back and double dealing and snaking around in the swamp.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  And they're all scared.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  So we the people have to decide whether we're going to let this group of slime do this to us because there's no limit to what they're going to push.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  Here's Adam Schiff.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  Got himself involved covering up Hillary Clinton's servers and email with the Russians.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  A man truly supporting Russian meddling and Russians getting our uranium.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  A true trader.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  Here he is trying to bring down Trump.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  Here's the clip.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  My takeaway is there's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office, the Justice Department may indict him that he may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  We have been discussing the issue of pardons that the president may offer to people or Daniel in front of people.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  The bigger pardon question may come down the road as the next president has to determine whether to pardon Donald Trump.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  Now, I think the prosecutors in New York make a powerful case against that idea.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  All the arguments they make about Michael Cohen, the idea that while people are out walking precincts and doing what they should do in campaigns, the rich and powerful seem to live by a different set of rules.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  So this was the argument for putting Michael Cohen in jail on these campaign violations.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  That argument, I think, was equally made with respect to individual one, the president of the United States.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  Did you hear anything about Russia there?
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  Oh, we didn't.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  And there is nothing there.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  Think about that.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  And these are the Democrats who are famously corrupt with campaign finance and Hillary with billions of foreign money in her campaign and paper play.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  Oh, there's no discussion of that. You're like, why the Republicans had the Congress?
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  Because other than Nunes and a few others, they're all a bunch of cowards.

[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  In the last few months InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items. And then I came up with the idea last week.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off double-patriot points. Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out. So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders. So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  This is a loss-leader. We are losing money on this. This is our biggest sale ever. Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  And don't fight the crowds in FullWarsStore.com, in FullWarsLive.com, or triple-8253-3139. God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  It was about two years ago that the Democrats nationwide in blue cities and blue states decided on a new way to get the guns.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  They basically called it the Baker Act, or red flagging. And now, if someone just calls and says, I think they're dangerous.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  They didn't point a gun at me. They didn't say they were suicidal. Just, I saw the guns in their house.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  And so, I mean, I've had carpet cleaners one time, saw guns on a gun rack in my house, called the police on me. The police didn't come, but that's the craziness of this.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  And then in some cases, people are getting killed when the police come. But you can go back two years ago, Bloomberg had the headline, gun confiscation begins in California.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  See, they've gone from denying they want to take the guns to saying, yeah, we need to repeal the Second Amendment and take all the guns. Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  It's happening, confiscation begins at Florida's new gun control laws enacted. So joining us is a great American patriot, Joey Gibson.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  You know, you got the proud boys that Gavin McGinnis started, and they've been demonized and called extremists by the media.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  The FBI didn't really say that. Then they got de-platformed. Just the media just saying they're extreme. Now you're de-platformed.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  But Joey, the Patriot Pair Group, they go out and just pray in public in San Francisco and Berkeley and places like Portland, Oregon, and they get physically attacked.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  And then the news calls them terrorists, but nobody ever gets arrested because they're not swinging first the meth-head professors are.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  But he's here to warn. He's got an event coming up. Joey Gibson and the whole Patriot Pair Group about what's happening.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  Washington's I-1639 would implement some of the nation's most stringent gun control laws. That's what they call it.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  But really, it's getting rid of due process. Gibsonforfreedom.com is his main site.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  Joey, thanks for telling us about this and a snapshot of what's happening in Oregon.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  Yeah, it's great to be here. In Washington State, we have Seattle, Washington, one million voters of the three million total in all of Washington State.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  So we have a lot of conservative counties, a lot of people who are independent, like to hunt. You like their guns.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  And so right now we're going around to the small counties. We're focusing on Scamania County and we're asking them to ask the council members and the sheriff to protect the Constitution
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  to pass some sort of ordinance to say that they're not going to allow the state to break the Constitution.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  With this whole mental health thing that they're doing, this is the new way they're going to grab guns. This is what they did to the veterans with the VA.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  Basically, if you want to be a gun owner, you have to sign away your privacy rights to your medical records so the state has full access.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  So that way they can determine if you're eligible or not. We don't know what's going to make you eligible or not.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  It can be, you know, you're simply on antidepressants or maybe you're on painkillers and all of a sudden your second amendment is revoked.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  By the way, by the way, you're not just saying this. This happened to 300,000 veterans when Clinton's last year.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  Then Obama brought it back and they're now, Trump stopped it federally, partially, but it's hard to stop the bureaucrats.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000]  This is now happening everywhere and now they're going to use it at state level.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  In 2015, the feds tried to come and take the guns from a veteran in Bonner County, which is in Idaho.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  And the sheriff stood up. We had Matt Shea from Washington stood up and they had over 200 citizens stand at his house to protect his house.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  And the feds decided not to come to his house to take his guns.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  Yeah, it definitely has been happening. We just don't hear about it.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  But now in Washington state, they made it legal.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  And it's really concerning because basically, if you want to be a gun owner, you are a second class citizen because you have a right to privacy.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  You have a right for the government to not know, not going into your medical records.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  And every single year, what the state's going to do is they're going to check your records and check your medical records and check your background.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  And so every single year, if for whatever reason they determine that you're ineligible to own firearms, they're going to require that the police chief or the sheriff has to come into your house to take your guns.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  And again, these are people like SJW is like reality winner who will have access. We know all over the country, Antifa works in these different bureaus, health departments, police departments, and they're doxing everybody.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  So they can now make the determination to a leak your medical records, but also send a SWAT team to your house.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  Yeah, absolutely. And a lot of the sheriffs that I talked to, they're really nervous about this because they don't want to be kicking down doors of their friends, of their family members in some of these small counties.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  And they're really concerned about that. And they don't understand how this law is going to move forward. They don't understand where the funding is going to come from.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  A lot of people are confused and a lot of people are concerned.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  And so what we're asking is we're asking these small counties, Scamania County, we're asking people next Tuesday, not tomorrow, but next Tuesday to show up at the courthouse.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  That's where they have their board meetings.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  You know, it'd be awesome if we can have hundreds of people to show up and just ask that they pass some sort of ordinance where we simply just respect the Constitution.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  That's what we're asking for. This is different from sanctuary cities because there's nothing unconstitutional about giving illegals to ICE.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  What we're saying though, it's unconstitutional for the state to just determine without due process, without the court system, these people in back rooms to simply just say that you can't have a gun because you're on antidepressants or whatever medical reason they come up with.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  I'll tell you, the globalists are unbelievable. Bloomberg has funded this. He's one of the big guys, Soros. This is on record. Hundreds of millions just to fund these laws getting passed.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  But in some cases, there's not even laws. They're just using other regulations to come after people's guns. And it's crazy. It's super dangerous for police.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  It's out of control. And I've seen the videos on your site. You should plug some of the places people can find these. We're going to post some of these to infowars.com.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  You're getting crowds of hundreds and hundreds of people in small towns, counties coming out, and they are really pissed about this.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  They're really upset. We had almost 300 people in a county with about 10,000 people in it, and they were extremely concerned. They're really upset.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  They're sick and tired of Seattle telling them what they can or cannot do. These people just, they just want to be free. They want to be left alone.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  And so I think this is the key in states like Washington and Oregon. The key is to go around to all the counties that believe in the Constitution,
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  which is about 90% of the counties in Washington state, most of them are conservative, and have them pass ordinances. And if you pass an ordinance respecting the Constitution,
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  I believe that that will, that people from Olympia, politicians, and even DC, they'll think twice about passing unconstitutional laws.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  That's right. We've got to build a united front against this because they can't get them federally for now. They want that. So they're going at the state level through, quote, mental health,
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  not through the Second Amendment. And again, these mass shooters, they're all on Prozac. They're all being protected. They're all, you know, let out of jail.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  They're very easy to see. If someone's already been adjudicated to be mentally ill, they've already had things they should, they should not have a Second Amendment.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  But to randomly say, we're just going to look at your records and then we're going to decide whether you have your guns. That now makes the psychologist and the bureaucrats and whoever's looking at the records.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  That makes them judge, jury, and executioner. And this is really a destruction of due process.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  Yeah, absolutely. And that's my biggest concern. My biggest concern is also they can make targets of people who are outspoken activists.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  You know, if people are out there promoting freedom, then they can go, they can look into your medical records and just find anything. Just make targets of us, much like the IRS did going after conservative groups under Obama.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  And this is really concerning. And so I'm, I'm afraid that they're going to find people, they're going to throw them in jail.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  They're going to throw 18, 19, 20 year olds in jail simply for doing what their family has done for generations, going out hunting, whether it be with a semi-automatic rifle or not.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  Joey Gibson, amazing. Keep it up. Everybody should blueprint what you're doing and duplicate it in their state. I mean, I was like 20 states are passing laws or have passed laws like this.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  We salute you. Again, people can find freedom first. What's the best place from the visit? Gibson for Freedom.com.

[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:58.000]  2018 has been an incredible year. As we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you all again for making the entire M4 War possible. Again, you are the resistance.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  Everybody knows that history documents it, but there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history that wants to hurt children.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:13.000]  They want to abort children. They want to disease children. They want to abuse children. They want to confuse children.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  They want their essence. They want their soul. They want their spirit. They want their power because they are our future.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:30.000]  And this Christmas, remember, it is about Jesus Christ, the ultimate sacrifice. It is about the West. It is about a human future, extending with each other and believing in a better future.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:39.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support, but I want to ask you all to pray for your own family, to pray for America, to pray for President Trump, and to pray for M4Wars.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  And to remember that you have the power to change the world. You have the power to override the sensors. You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  I know you've been taken action. I salute you, but just remember, I know you're humble, but just remember, you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:07.000]  M4Wars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics, operations, the whole thing.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  We've been proven dead on. You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project. You've been the men and women of the arena, and I really do thank you and salute you all.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  Words are not enough. Think about, of all the different systems, of all the different political ideologies that you have been on target,
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  promoting Americana and Renaissance and open free society against the globalists and the dominant world force.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other, but we have cut right to the chase.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000]  Human liberty, a pro-human future versus the globalist anti-human future.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:47.000]  That's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that M4Wars really is your baby.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  I am in your hands, and we're under unprecedented attack, and we just need you to go to infowars.com
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding infowars. A true 360 win.

[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  Well, they say one man can't do very much. That's because one man or woman can do incredible things.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  If they're at the right place at the right time and they have the will and they take action.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  Our next guest, John Greenwald, Jr., from theblackvult.com, will tell you about him in a moment.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  He just kept doing the forward request, and he got one of the biggest tranches of MKUltra Mind Control documents ever.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  Bigger than what came out in Senator Frank Church's hearings in the 70s. The last time we got a big, fat piece of the puzzle.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  Of course, there's a lot of other stuff going on in the modern times. This ties into screen time and the programming of children
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  and how it's hurting their brains. We'll talk about that as well with Dr. Nick Begich.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  In the next hour, he'll be in the studio with us. And he does a good show when he's not in the studio.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  But in the studio, he's amazing. So that is coming up as well.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  Please, don't forget, we're running the biggest specials ever in infowars.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  Because Soros and the Globalists are on record trying to take all of our payment processors and totally shut us down.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  They took Milo Yiannopoulos' funding away. The last thing he had, Patreon.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  Gavin McGinnis, because he had the number one show on CRTV, and Glenn Beck was jealous, has been kicked off.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000]  And I know the whole inside baseball, not from Gavin, but from others involved.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  And it's very, very sickening. Just leave it at that.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  And so this is the war. They're taking everyone off the air, they think is effective.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  But infowars is still standing because you financially supported us.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  But I have usually inventory for five, six months in t-shirts, in books, in films, in supplements, in coffee.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  This time, I am doing sales that are clearly 30, 40% bigger than they've ever been.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  Because we have a plan to shell everything out of the warehouse.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  And we've already got the model ready to go with sponsors.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  Something you've seen me discard. You hear the radio, it has them, and that's fine.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  But I've discarded sponsorship for about seven, eight years. It's been successful.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  Directly getting funding from you with great products. But if they take that away, don't worry.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  I've got all the big sponsors lined up as well.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  And if we keep both, that's even better. We'll just expand Battlefront even faster.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  But we're not giving up ever.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  That which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger. So you need to support us.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  But you're supporting yourself, not fighting traffic, not fighting the crowds, getting great presents, helping the economy, all the rest of it.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  Every order gets a free t-shirt. We're all Alex Jones. Don't censor me. Gadsden flag, black on white t-shirt.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  It's unisex, great for men and women. You pick your side, it's free. Free shipping.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  Double patriot points on your next order. 10% to the 5% on every dollar.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  And 50, that's the lowest special step is 75% off.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  You know, we have a special going where we have a special every day where something is 60% off.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  But go look at all the specials because some things are 75% off at infowarstore.com.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  Bodies is 60% off ultimate turmeric formula with 95% or cumanoid turmeric.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  The nature's ultimate anti-inflammatory.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  And I'm going to tell you about turmeric. I'm just going to tell you, this is the strongest on the market.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  No one has got one stronger. They have other leading brands that cost twice as much at our regular sell price.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  At 60% off, we're selling it at cost when you add the free shipping into it.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  You add the t-shirt, we're losing money.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  Think about it. Free shipping, free t-shirt, 60% off.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  Our average product's about 150% marked up. Average supplements marked up seven times, not us.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  We mark it up 150%.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  We always at least discount 30%, 40%. So we're almost always at 100% mark up.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  So when we tell you 60% off, it's really 60% off.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  So, and it's all flying out. Let me tell you that the warehouse here in Austin, the little elves are working 24 hours a day.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  We brought on extra shifts. And thanks to you, we're selling it all out.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  The entire everything. Boom! Gone. It's all going to be gone.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  In fact, this new shirt, we printed out a lot of them. It's about to be gone.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  We'll have a new shirt that we have inventory of. It'll be the new free shirt by tomorrow.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  InfowarsTour.com, InfowarsLife.com, or AAA 253-3139.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  And we're going to sell out by Wednesday, they're saying of the Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration systems.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  Lady competitors are $600 or $700. It's always a great deal at $240, four stage ion filter.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  The fact we had a glut of those, they want to sell it because of inventory, it's $127.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  They're selling it to us at cost. We make like $30.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  No deal is even near this for you and your family get Alexa Pure Breeze now.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  But watch, the special will be gone just like Alexa Pure Pro water filters. Those did sell out.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  This will be gone.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  No one even gets close to this because we're the biggest distributor for this top company.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  We got the steel. No one else got this. You got this because the owner is a rabid listener, Matt Redhaw.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  And boy, has he been harassed for being a supporter.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  Oh, let me tell you, I'm not supposed to. He's another patriot.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  So we're here and we stand with those that stand with us.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  We thank you for supporting us. InfowarsTour.com, make that commitment, get in there, get the great products,
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  get the lowest prices, and help fund the Second American Revolution that's going worldwide.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  Okay, we'll hold John a little bit in the next hour.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  And then we've got, hell, he might as well just segue in.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  But John, that's theblackvolt.com. I'm going to read his whole background.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  But he's a researcher. He's a listener. He's a successful researcher and author and a whole bunch of other things.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  And he's been all over radio and TV programs.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  So he's an expert on hidden things and he gets documents.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  He's amassed more than 2 million pages of declassified documents.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  So I'd call him, you know, Mr. Declassification. I'd call him Mr. Blackvolt. That's a great name.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  So John, I've seen your work before. It's great to have you here with us.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  Wow, this is one of your biggest coups. How did you suddenly get this?
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  And no one else was. It was all over the international news the last three days.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  Truth about CIA's illegal MKO from Mind Control Experiments using drugs, hypnosis, electronic devices,
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  like your cell phones, revealed in sensational new documents officials hid for decades.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  The Sun reported on it, but it got a lot of attention.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  It did. Yeah. And Alex, by the way, thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to be here.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  Thanks for being here as well.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  Absolutely. And it's my pleasure. So the way that I came about this,
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  my connection to the MK Ultra documents actually goes back to the late 90s,
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  when I first started using the Freedom of Information Act.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  I started in 1996 and I was 15 years old when I started firing away requests.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  And back in Fast Forward to about 2004, I got the 30,000 pages that they archived on a CD-ROM.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  And that is what you had referenced from the church committee and what had kind of mysteriously been found
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  by the CIA that was mis-filed as financial records.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  Well, now Fast Forward to 2016, I was one of the first places to actually dump those documents onto the Internet,
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  because at the time they were not anywhere to be found.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  And it wasn't until 2016 that another researcher using the Black Vault took the contents of those CD-ROMs,
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  cross-referenced an index that the CIA claimed was everything on the CDs,
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  and lo and behold, it was not complete and there were missing documents and missing serial numbers.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  I had no idea that it would take almost three years to actually get the CIA to finally release those missing pages.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  It is a long story, which I won't bore you with, but...
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  Basically, you got the stuff they wanted hidden back when Congress ordered it released.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  They released what they thought wasn't as damaging.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  You got the stuff they basically blacked out bureaucratically by withholding it.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  In my opinion, yeah, that's what this is, because you see even the non-MKUltra-related material,
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  and what I mean by that is everything has been kind of lumped into this Mind Control MKUltra program.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  What these thousands of pages that I just received and put online at theblackbault.com,
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  what they prove is we do not have the full story.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  What they prove is MKUltra was just simply the tip of the iceberg that there was a heck of a lot more going on,
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  that there are project names that are still redacted, and why that's important is,
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  according to the CIA, they've kind of, quote-unquote, released everything to us.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  So investigators have had these for years, but what these prove is that's not entirely true.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  They don't appear online.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  There's no references to them in books, and I'm not saying they're all, you know,
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  brand new in the sense that they've never been released before,
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  but it appears that there is an awful lot that have never been released before.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  Well, and there's also our due sex.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  Trump has said he's going to release Deep State stuff.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  He didn't release the JFK files.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  Word is there's a new FBI file that just came out about Bush narcotics trafficking.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  We're going to be breaking that in the next few days.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan-favorite formulas we've ever offered
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  with even better ingredients, ultimate bone broth.

[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that,
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine,
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  but chemists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it,
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  it's an incredible discovery.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  Now available at InfowarsLive.com.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out,
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  and then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  So this is a loss leader.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  We are losing money on this.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  This is our biggest sale ever.

[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  HAPPYS from InfowarsStore.com
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  It's Alex Jones
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  You know, it's funny that people back in the 50s
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  scientists said that the flicker rate in televisions put people into a hypnotic state
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  because of the interlacing of how the TV screen would shoot out basically a light beam spectrum
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  and the way the two systems interlaced in layman's terms is a flicker rate
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  so fast that your conscious brain doesn't see it but your subconscious does
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  and it puts you into a trance.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  You'll think of a flashing strobe light or the watch being swung. It's that too infinity
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  and then you get into the giant science. This is just one little area
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  when you go into these DARPA research laboratories and I was led into some one time
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  because one of the people that worked there was basically crazy and thought it was a big joke
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  and I'm like, what are you showing me? It was like, oh, come over here.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  You're shooting a psychology department, this film you're making
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  and then all of a sudden I'm being shown flicker rates and programming and monkey experiments
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  and ape experiments on how to put them into a trance state and then how to make them
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  suggestible which they would then do to humans later
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  and that was just one little project at UT and it was restricted
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  and then part of the programs was classified but now, oh, 60 minutes, screen time's hurting kids
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  hurting their capacity to form relationships, especially giving them artificial ass burgers.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  Well, everybody, even the old timers knew, kids, don't get too close to the TV.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  People said, we don't know why, it just hurts you.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  Well, it turned out studies did actually show it was projecting a form of radiation at you
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  and the new plasma screens do that and the new LED screens do that
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  and the new cell phones and all of them put off microwave radiations.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  They literally give you cancer.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  So at every level, we're given this Promethean power but it destroys us
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  and our liver is torn out by a large buzzard every day for eternity, for a punishment.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  If you go to the Greek mythology, you're given the power of the gods
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  but you're tortured because of it.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  So that's the allegory here.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  I'll go back to our guests but that's just one micron of this but let me tell you,
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  I know about MKUltra from studying other projects and because of things I separately learned
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  from people close to me that happen to be witnesses to it and I'm going to just leave it at that
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  but you all heard about how the CIA put the LSD on the campuses in the 60s
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  and Timothy Leary worked for the FBI and the CIA to make it cool
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  and all those other hosts tell you about DMT, man, take it, it's cool.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  Have you taken the DMT?
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  Those are the new Timothy Leary's and they go meet with professors on the weekend
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  that are really CIA leftist and they say what they want programmed next
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  and if you don't go meet with them, they come after you like you see with us.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  So I'm here telling you, hey, DMT, you might think it's great
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  but the bad guys running things want you to take it and I know the folks who first brought DMT to the public
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  and they told me the whole inside story which I won't tell at this point
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  but I'm very close to doing it because it's part two of this.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  In fact, our guest, John Greenwell, we're going to get back for a full hour in the near future.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  I apologize, I'm rambling on here but the point is here we are being proven right
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  on humans have been cloned for a long time, human animal chimeras, secret space projects,
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  mind control programs, everything they make fun of us for
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  which we were just going off old documents is now confirmed, isn't it?
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  Yeah, and that's what's interesting about these documents.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  We've heard about MKUltra for a long time.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  We know that the mind control experiments took place.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  My biggest takeaway over the last couple of years where the CIA did not even want to believe me
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  that those documents were not on the CD, I had to create a 95 page fax to send over to them
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  to prove that I was right, that they weren't there.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  Once I proved that, they changed their story but here's my takeaway.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  Even though we know about MKUltra and have for many years and we know the broad scope of it,
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  what these documents show is that MKUltra was potentially the tip of the iceberg
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  that there are documents.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  It was just the entrance.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  I mean, people say what's new, exactly, that this was only the first level.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  Right, exactly.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  And these documents show that they were not even related to MKUltra
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  but they were doing experiments where they are implanting devices and they started with dogs
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  and Newsweek wrote this up, did a great job with it,
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  that they were implanting these things in dog brains
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  and were able to control dogs and have success with it.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  Now, you might think, well, that's just dogs, who cares?
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  Well, this was the tip of the iceberg when it came to that research.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  What comes next when you master the animals?
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  Tens of thousands of military volunteer.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  They got guys that will volunteer to go on suicide missions.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  They've already volunteered, they've already done it all.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  I know people that got recruited to these programs and people that refused the programs
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  but they, in the 80s, they already had giant, literal underground facilities in Maryland
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  where they were creating all sorts of people, let's just say,
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  that could infiltrate things with hidden devices in their bodies.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  Yeah, and this release of information proves beyond any shadow of a doubt
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  there is a lot more for people like me to find.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  This document release is incredibly important, there's thousands of pages to read
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  but it shows me that there are more classified projects
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  that they will not tell you what the name is
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  and they will not tell you what the objectives of those projects were.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  Now, that's important because we know about MKUltra,
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  we know about the crazy stuff they did,
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  we now know that they were implanting devices into dogs and animals,
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  mice using drugs, using hypnosis.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  We know all of that and it proves that those theories are all right,
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  some of which we knew, now we've got more.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  But if we know all of that, my question is, what is still classified?
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  What are they still not giving us?
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  Why won't they give us program names?
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  Why won't they give us the objectives?
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  If MKUltra and the LSD and hypnosis research was that bizarre and that intense,
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  I can't even imagine what is still classified,
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  that they can't even tell you anything related to the program.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  And that's all in these documents that I put online
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  and anybody can download them for free.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  I invite you to go through them because, hey, there's thousands of pages,
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  I just got them a week ago, there's no way I can go through them that quick.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  So it's amazing to see what people are finding
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  and ultimately how it's going to give me a tool to move forward
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  and create more requests and go after this.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  Because honestly, I truly believe that the CIA has proven
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  that they separate MKUltra and what they call behavioral modification research.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  They do not connect the two.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  I think Alex, maybe you and I would, but the CIA does not.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  So they have a lot more to find.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  And I think that as much as we think or the general public and consensus
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  as we have the whole story about MKUltra,
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  I do not think that that is true at all.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  Well, I'm impressed with your work.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  And I want to invite you to come and guest us sometime.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  If you'd like to really go over a lot of this in different areas for people
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  because it's so frustrating to read the documents,
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  watch old C-SPAN congressional stuff from the 80s, you can go watch it.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  And then have the news go, Jones is crazy.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  He claims there was a program for this and that.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  I'm just talking about stuff that's admitted.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  And as you said, I know for a fact, they just gave Frank Church and others
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  a few programs because Frank Olson had got killed and some other people.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  And so they had to give them what they'd gotten leads on.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  But like you said, it was a very tiny piece of a much larger,
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  long-term strategic operation.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  And I can tell you as full spectrum dominance,
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  where they want to lead every organization, every group,
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  every institution showed that no matter what's going on, they're in full control.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  And then behind the CIA, it's just a clearinghouse for different groups,
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  is the foundations.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  Yeah.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  Yeah, and this shows that foundation, strong foundation.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  They were having successes.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  And I see a lot of comments sometimes from the public that say,
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  oh, we knew all this.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  No, we didn't actually.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  And that's what's interesting is you get a sneak peek into the foundation
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  that the CIA was building, that the research they were undertaking,
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  and you see success.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  You don't see failure.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  If all these documents just showed failure, you might think,
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  well, they did the research.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  They spent millions of dollars, but it didn't do anything.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  It's quite the opposite.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  They were able to control the dogs.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  They're very, very poorly photocopied,
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  but you can see the actual pictures.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  I believe that there were six remote-controlled dogs
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  that they were able to control.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  They were unrestrained, but they were able to control the dogs.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  Let's be clear.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  This is in the 60s and 70s.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  Then they went public in the 90s.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  Oh, Roboradic goes into a collapsed building and saves people,
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  but roaches with a microchip, they control like a joystick.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  Yeah.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  And then once they have that, then they learn how,
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  with more passive systems to then program,
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  where they can use magnetic waves,
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  other things, then add programming into the very television programs
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  that interface with it.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  But only the suggestible does this stuff work on.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  That's what's so sophisticated.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  Yeah.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  I think you really have to beg to ask the question,
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  is this continuing now?
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  And you look at it again, I go back to the successes.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  Yeah, is this continuing now?
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  We're living it, brother.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  We're living the super sophisticated stuff now.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  Yeah.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  And these documents show that 50, 60, 70 years ago,
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  they're doing this research, having success.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  You know, darn well, the CIA is not going to say,
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  okay, well, we succeeded with that.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  Let's not go any farther.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  Let's not do this for intelligence gathering purposes.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  You know that that's not true.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  So what these documents really do from a historical perspective
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  is it lays that foundation, but it then lends credence
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  to what is going on today.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  And you brought up DARPA, and I think that,
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  you know, you hide a lot of this in plain sight.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  Stay there.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  Folks want to know the end product is this.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  This is the next move before the brain shift.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  This is it.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  This is it.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  This is the mind control.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  The smartphone.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  It is their takeover project.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  This is it.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  All thing right.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  This is it.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  Unleash the super male in you.
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000]  Super male vitality.
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:56.000]  Infowars is proud to introduce the 12 days of Christmas.
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.000]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before as we attempt
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.000]  to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.

[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  the spirit of liberty and Americana.
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  The truly is the Christmas spirit.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  When you shop at InfowarsStore.com,
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  you don't just get incredible sales
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  during the 12 days of Christmas.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  You fund the very tip of the spear
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  in the fight against the globalist.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  Today's 24-hour only special at InfowarsStore.com is
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  our ultimate turmeric formula, bodies,
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  is now 60% off.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  InfowarsStore.com 2018 has been an incredible year.
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  And as we prepare to close it out,
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000]  I want to thank you all again
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000]  for making the entire Infowar possible.
[01:59:46.000 --> 02:00:15.000]  Again, you are the resistance.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  Imagine all the mad scientists in the world,
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  the alchemists of old,
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  wanting to know the secrets of the universe
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  and wanting control over the human mind.
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  Famous psychologists and psychiatrists,
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  many of them would put their children in cages
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  for their whole life until they committed suicide
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  because it was research they were allowed to.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  And all of that just grew into the spiraling mind wars,
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  what the Nazis called it.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  You've got the Russians.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  You've got, you know, that's the biggest thing here, John,
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  is you've got all these new documents,
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  what they didn't want people to know
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  from the famous Frank Church MKUltra.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  You reverse engineered it.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  You've gotten all these new documents
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  that just make it light years worse 50, 60 years ago
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  than what they even said.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  And obviously you haven't even gotten all the documents
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  from then, so of course this is all going on,
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  but they hide it in plain view now.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  And we're all, 5G gives everybody massive cancer.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  They're just doing it.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  But they'll have an advisement
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  where Anderson Cooper tells you that.
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  But imagine the other countries
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  and the other research and the things that are going on.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  And just all of this, this is crazy.
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  It's absolutely crazy.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  And you do start to see that hiding in plain sight
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  with research programs from DARPA.
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  And, you know, they put a fancy title on it.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  They don't call it mind control,
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  but they're obviously still experimenting
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  with the human mind.
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  They put it under the guise
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  that they're helping the wounded veterans.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  You know, and you see that,
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  and it sounds great to the average day person.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  But you know that it goes so much deeper than that.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  Oh, they're depressed.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  We're putting the brain chip in them.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  Yeah.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000]  We're giving them a special nano vaccine.
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  That the virus that eats parts of the brain,
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  he'll never be upset again.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  Yeah.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  Take the shot.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  What these documents show, though, is that those chips
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  can integrate very successfully with brains
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  and you can control them like a remote control.
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  It's in the documents.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  They're declassified.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  You can see it.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  And when you look at that, you know that...
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  Let's be clear.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  Specifically, you do 50s, 60s.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  I mean, that's the stuff you're getting.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  They're remote controlling dogs in the 50s and 60s.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  Boy, in 2018, what do you think they can do?
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  That's exactly where I was going with that.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  As you see the amazing breakthroughs
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  that they really did make through the 50s and 60s,
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  you have to ask, what would they be capable of now?
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  What kind of research are they doing now?
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  Or what have they mastered?
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  I mean, maybe they don't need to research anymore
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  because there's another 50, 60 years under their belt
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  of doing this kind of work.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  And they don't need to, like 1952,
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  put in a unit to control the dog that weighs a pound.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  They can put it, nanotech and a vaccine,
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  that then goes into the key areas,
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  forms that matrix control system,
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  which is then, just like the chips they have embedded,
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  which I told you about 20 years ago,
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  where microwaves can turn on chips,
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  even if you know you're a computer,
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  and then they get data that way,
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  even if your computer's turned off.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  Well, to send it with nanotech,
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  they put it into the brain tissue or other tissue,
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  or send it to the heart ganglia that fires the nerves,
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  and you have a heart attack.
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  And it's all in the vaccine, a binary weapon they give to you,
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  and then they can hit you with a carrier wave to activate it.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  Yeah, and the technology that we have now,
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  coupled with the successes they were having 50, 60 plus years ago,
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  that is a terrifying combination.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  And we're just using this stuff from 50, 60 years ago
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  to formulate some theories.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  We don't know exactly what they're doing now,
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  but think about the technology and the nanotechnology
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  and how small things are.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  They could be implanting these chips
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  without ever actually cutting open anything
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  before you had to do brain surgery.
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  Now you could just get these things in,
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  program the chip to find the brain itself.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  You just said it.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  You don't even need to get a vaccine.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  They just spray them out of a plane.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  But here's the difference.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  They want you metaphysically to go pay for the shot.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  They believe, karmically, and I'm telling you,
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  I've done research that with this weird luciferating thing
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  they follow, that they've got to trick you to do it.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  You see how important that is?
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  Yeah, honestly, it's terrifying
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000]  when you see documents like this,
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  because for many years some of this was just theory.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  We knew part was fact, but some of it was theory.
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  Now when you start seeing the research and the success,
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  the possibilities of where they could be now are endless.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  Well, let me just tell you,
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000]  John Greenwald Jr., TheBlackVault.com,
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  I've got Nick Begas come on.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  If you can do one more segment,
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  I'd like you to talk to him,
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  he obviously knows who he is,
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  a pioneer in the things that you're doing.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  You guys are amazing.
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  I appreciate that.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut

[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:19.000]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat the UK hospitals.
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000]  Silent green, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000]  is made out of people.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:27.000]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  They're being sacrificed on the altar
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000]  of efficiency and prosperity.
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:40.000]  What is the secret of silent green?
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:45.000]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000]  Because of its enormous popularity,
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  silent green is in short supply.
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:52.000]  Remember, Tuesday is silent green day.
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:56.000]  The supply of silent green has been exhausted.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  You must evacuate the area.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.000]  It's silent green.
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.000]  The shareholders of PepsiCo,
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000]  Big Builder Bird Group company,
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  are not allowed to know
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.000]  what they're using the baby parts for
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000]  and the flavoring, but we already know.
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  So enjoy the flavor.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000]  We're going to get the real solution,
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:20.000]  which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  I'm for regular suicide.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.000]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:34.000]  for that patient, would it be better not to lay up
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:38.000]  those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.000]  But that's called the death panel.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.000]  Tell me to say that they were sorry,
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  but that you had become unreliable.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000]  will do it to its senior citizens.
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:11.000]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police,
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000]  on its army, on its prison guards,
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:19.000]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000]  The scoops are on their way.
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000]  The scoops are on their way.
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000]  You will find out why
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  Soylent Green means life.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  We're going to stop them.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  Soylent Green is life.
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  Soylent Green is people.
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  Dr. Nick Baggess is hanging out with us for Wednesday.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  Ride the shotgun on the war ram.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  Ride the shotgun on the on the sound show.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  It's a dangerous place, not because of evil,
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  you are the resistance.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:23.000]  Dr. Nick Baggess is riding the shotgun with us here on the war ram,
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  here on the Alex Jones show.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  And then, of course, he was on this morning with David Knight
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  and the David Knight show at 8 a.m.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  And, of course, he is a famous scientist,
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  best-selling author, researcher,
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  that involved big time with the tribes up in Alaska.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  His dad's a famous congressman.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000]  They got so much of that done.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  Of course, his brother's been a U.S. senator.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  And I was thinking, we already had a guest on the segues
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  into what you were going to be covering.
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000]  And you were in there in the green room watching them
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  the last 30 minutes with John Greenwell Jr.,
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  theblackvault.com, who got the rest of the MKL
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  for documents they had met exist,
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  what they had denied existed,
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  and we could see references to them as he was able to do that.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.000]  And it was showing now in the 50s what you were saying,
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  they already had remote control of mammals with brain devices.
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  And it just shows how it's light years ahead
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  of what we even know and how crazy it is.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  Right. And John was right on.
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  I really appreciate the fact that he got started at 15.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  First for your request, congratulations to you.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  That's just top notch.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  That's what we need to see in this country.
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  The fact is the MKUltra program was a tip of the iceberg.
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  And what you've uncovered in the most recent documents,
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  what I've been saying for years is the electromagnetic effect
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  of altering consciousness.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.000]  This is the key.
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  And then the biggest thing that I think was discovered in this
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  was the latent potentials of human beings,
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  the psychic potentials of human beings.
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  And that's what scared the establishment.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  That's what freaked them out.
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  Because at first they put the LSD out to try to find the Latins,
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  and it was so powerful they got scared.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  Right. Because they turned out that everybody has these capacities,
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  just a matter of remembering them.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  And this is sort of, you get back down to it again.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  You know, what are we as human beings fundamentally?
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  These are our natural attributes that are subjected to fear
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  and anxiety, which suppresses them,
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  and then the brain can't reach these things.
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  And that's why they're hit with chemicals and biologicals
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  and cultural poison is to suppress that.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  Absolutely correct.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  And John has it right on.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  Be able to release those documents,
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  get those out to the public.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  Congratulations.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  Thank you.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  That is just fantastic.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  John, what's coming next at theblackvol.com?
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  Well, these documents are going to allow me to formulate
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  quite a few more FOIA requests.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  In 22 years now, I've filed over 9,000 FOIA requests
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  to get those 2 million pages.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  You know, I just go after anything and everything,
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  because documents are destroyed, evidence is covered up.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  One thing that we didn't mention yet,
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  but I'll throw it out there real quick,
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  is the documents that were just released on this behavioral modification
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  prove an awful lot.
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  But what we haven't talked about was the absolute struggle
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  and the fight.
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  I mean, the CIA literally fought me for years
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  to not release them.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  And they claim that I already had them.
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  They tried to say that those CD-ROMs that they sell to the public
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  are complete when they're not.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  They're giving away indexes that aren't complete.
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  In fact, one other thing is their initial page count
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  that they told me I would get
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  was diminished by 1,245 pages.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  It was not an estimation.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  They had an exact page count.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  And yet, when, again, fast-forwarding to the end of the story here,
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  but 1,245 pages just mysteriously vanished.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  No idea where they are, no explanation, no nothing.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  It could be actually as high as 2,000,
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  but I'm giving the CIA the benefit of the doubt.
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  That might be a bad course of action,
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  but I'm trying to be fair.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  And it's definitely...
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  Well, that's my next question to both you and Dr. Beggis before you go, though.
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  And guys, pull back up that Daily Mail article a few months ago.
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  Oh, the CIA accidentally releases a file
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  on using cell phone towers.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  This is in the 60s, before they were up,
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  to send out waves to manipulate people's body functions
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  and even control them.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  Something you've talked about a long time,
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  something in the Baltimore Sun in, like, 1999.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  They did a trial balloon and admitted,
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000]  oh, we're testing cell towers calming you.
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  I don't know where our guess goes,
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  but accidentally they released it.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  Now, Trump releases the JFK stuff.
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  Trump has said he wants to release a lot more.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  He's threatened the deep state that he's going to release Hillary's emails
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000]  or say, no, they have, and so much more.
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  What do you make of Trump?
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  Because I'm not just defending Trump.
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  I'm suddenly seeing a lot more stuff getting answered in foyers
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  because he's at least given the directive
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  that's being ignored at a lot of levels to release this stuff.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  Yeah, I try to be nonpartisan as I can answering questions like this.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  I've learned over the years it doesn't matter Republican, Democrat,
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  the secrecy is there.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  The bureaucracy is there.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  Of course, Trump really pushed to get those JFK documents released,
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  and I was first in line to get them downloaded and programmed in.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000]  But there's still more.
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  There was, you know...
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  No, I keep talking.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  I was going to pull up the Daily Mail article
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  to show that they made mind control documents.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  Go ahead.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000]  I got you.
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  I'm not going to get those for pushing to get those documents out,
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  but at the end of the day, there are still documents being hidden.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  There are still documents that they are withholding,
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000]  and even though Trump gave the order that he did,
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  he pulled that back as well by the end when he said
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  they still can keep some of this secret,
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  and he allowed them to do that.
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  So why is that?
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  And here's a question, and again, not being partisan,
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  but what does the president know,
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  and also what does the president not know?
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  And I've always been someone who says
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  the president does not know everything,
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  and I think this might be a prime example.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  He goes into office and he says,
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  hey, look, we need the truth out,
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  and I give him props for that.
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  Then he learns what the real truth is and goes,
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  uh-oh, you know, we can't let this out.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  For the greater good, national security, whatever you want to say,
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  he can't do it.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  He said, I can release the whole Russiagate thing
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  and he said, it'll bring the country down.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  And that's what the crimes are so massive,
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000]  at a certain point you go,
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  you've got underground bases with humanoid clones,
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  and you've got 10,000, they're like, what?
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  It's like, and that's how they get you.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  And I say, let the heavens fall, justice be done,
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  release everything.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  I want it all, bring it out, we're ready.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  Yeah, and sadly, I don't think that's going to happen.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  I think that the national security threat
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  to what the government truly has done
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  and what they are doing,
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  that national security threat to tell the public
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  and release it all, in my opinion, is too great at this point.
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  Well, that's it, and that's what I did.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  It's too evil to fail.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  That's their plan. Thank you, John Riemel.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:14.000]  And I'll see you in the next video.
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  FakeTV.com
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  Marijuana has unleashed a green gold rush across our nation.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  It's creating $10.8 billion in new wealth a year.
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  And every day, it's transforming more and more Americans
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  into millionaires.
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  In an historic event,
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000]  former Speaker of the House John Boehner
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  reveals how you could become one of them.
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  Join him online for the American Cannabis Summit.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  Attendance is 100% free, but space is limited.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  Join online at www.acs2018.com.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  This event is the first of its kind ever.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  John Boehner and an esteemed panel
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  will reveal which cannabis stocks are primed
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000]  to deliver life-changing windfalls
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  in the weeks and months ahead.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000]  Plus, they will show you how to become
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  a cannabis angel investor,
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  backing the hottest startups
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  before they potentially become worth billions of dollars.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000]  Join American Cannabis Summit online
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000]  at www.acs2018.com.
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  Attendance is free.
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  That's www.acs2018.com.
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000]  how important M4 Wars is
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000]  in the fight against the anti-human globalist.
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  So let's say it's short and sweet.
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000]  We are your support now more than ever.
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000]  You've come through a thousand times,
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  so I'm not bitching at you.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:10.000]  I'm just simply telling you,
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000]  we are in the thick of the battle now.
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  The attacks on M4 Wars
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  have become absolutely exponential
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  and down the road we probably will get destroyed.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000]  But I know and God has really put it on my heart
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  that we've got to maintain the fight
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  as hard as possible
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  and go through as much as we can
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  to be an example to others
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000]  and carry out critical operations
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  ahead of whatever happens.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  I need to be provisioned
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000]  and I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  and the Rothschilds and all these devil worshipers.
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  But I need your prayers.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  We make it easy.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  Do your Christmas shopping with us,
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.000]  not with the globalists
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  and not with Bezos and Amazon
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000]  and you'll help provision us.
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000]  We've got a bunch of huge deals
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  at M4Store.com,
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  so please take action right now.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  M4 Wars has been proven
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  absolutely on target about world government,
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  the attack on the family,
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000]  the eugenics operations,
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  the whole thing.
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  We've been proven dead on.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:08.000]  You've been proven dead on
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000]  as supporters and listeners of this project.
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  You've been the men and women in the arena
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000]  and I really do thank you
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  and salute you all.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  Words are not enough.
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000]  Think about,
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  of all the different systems,
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  of all the different political ideologies
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000]  that you have been on target,
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000]  promoting Americana and Renaissance
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  and open free society against the globalists
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000]  and the dominant world force.
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000]  They've created a tower of babel
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  with a bunch of people
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  that can't communicate with each other.
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000]  But we have cut right to the chase
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  human liberty,
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  a pro-human future
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000]  versus the globalist anti-human future.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  And that's why I want to thank you all
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.000]  and ask you now more than ever
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  to remember that InfoWars really is your baby.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  I am in your hands
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  and we're under unprecedented attack
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000]  and we just need you to go to infowars.com
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  and do your Christmas shopping there
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  and get the best deals ever
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:20:21.000]  and funding InfoWars a true 360 win.
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000]  All right. This just broke during the break.
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:24.000]  I looked at the articles.
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000]  I was already expecting this
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000]  because I already know about this attack plan.
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000]  They've used something similar on Limbaugh
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000]  but this is even worse.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.000]  And I've explained to listeners
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000]  they're going after our sponsors.
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000]  So we sell fun with our own products
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.000]  and they go after our credit card processing.
[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000]  They go after every platform.
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.000]  Gav McGinnis was taken.
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000]  Okay, the number one show on CRTV.
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000]  Glenn Beck bought into it.
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:49.000]  The blazes collapsed.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000]  They tried to sell it to us for $25 million
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:52.000]  a few years ago.
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000]  I said, I don't have that money A and B.
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  You're a tainted brand.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000]  But Glenn Beck, you know, bet against Trump.
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:00.000]  All the rest of it.
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000]  He's a globalist.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.000]  And so I was talking to Gav in your state.
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000]  He didn't want to get it inside baseball.
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:06.000]  I was fired.
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:09.000]  But I already knew from people inside CRTV
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:12.000]  separately that it was Glenn Beck
[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:13.000]  and that they'd had the left.
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000]  They were working with producer video.
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000]  Gav McGinnis edited out a context
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000]  and then they sent that there to get him off.
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:22.000]  And he said, well, I've still got YouTube.
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000]  And I said, Gavin, this is all coordinated.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000]  You'll be off of YouTube within a week.
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.000]  Well, he was just banned off YouTube.
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000]  So this is coordinated.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000]  When you realize the fake controlled right wing
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  is working with the Democrats, it's all deep state.
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000]  Then you understand it's the neocons,
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.000]  it's the controlled right and the left.
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.000]  Not liberals.
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.000]  Thomas Jefferson was a classical liberal.
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000]  That's why when I talked to Vice Magazine,
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.000]  right after Trump got elected, I said,
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000]  bigger waves of populism are coming.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000]  All of the world globalism is going to fall.
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:56.000]  I'm going to air that five minute report at the end of this hour.
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:57.000]  That's why I told you this was coming.
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.000]  So this is about survival for us in the whole country.
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:06.000]  They wanted Matt Drudge taken off the internet
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:10.000]  saying he violated the Federal Elections Commission laws.
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:14.000]  And until about two years ago,
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000]  they had 50, 50 votes and almost did it.
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000]  Then they came out and said,
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000]  what the fairness doctrine when Alex Jones
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000]  and Rush Limbaugh taken off,
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000]  and they had 10 Democrat senators give speeches for that.
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000]  So people say, oh, that'll never happen.
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000]  They gave speeches last year.
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:29.000]  And this year is saying take me off the internet.
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:30.000]  It happened.
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:31.000]  Yep.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.000]  Okay.
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:33.000]  And you've had family, congress senators.
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:34.000]  You explain how much power they have.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000]  So now radio host Alex Jones
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.000]  promotes dangerous fiction stations should say so.
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000]  So this is a Sacramento B.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.000]  They then say things I never said are out of context.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000]  They then say stations should say
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:51.000]  at the beginning of him airing, this isn't real.
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.000]  This is fake.
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.000]  But then the same group,
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000]  once they think they bully the station and do that,
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000]  they're going to say the station admits they're airing fake news.
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  The stations are being tricked.
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000]  Then they say Jones occupies the central position
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000]  in their own conspiracies
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:06.000]  and has rightly been removed from major media platforms
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.000]  for harassment, glorification of violence,
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:11.000]  and child endangerment.
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:14.000]  Now, what did they remove me off YouTube?
[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  The final video.
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:18.000]  I showed an ABC News clip in Missouri
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000]  of an 11-year-old, big 11-year-old
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000]  going around hitting adults and hitting this guy four times.
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.000]  The guy pushes him down.
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  I remember that.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.000]  Forbes and others ran.
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000]  I did that because the guy had a beard like me
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000]  at the time and stuff.
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000]  So now they don't show a link to me child endangerment.
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:34.000]  It's just Alex Jones is child endangerment,
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.000]  glorification of violence.
[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:38.000]  They said that was that same thing.
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000]  But radio stations around the country still broadcast
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000]  the dangerous falsehoods he promotes
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:43.000]  on the Alex Jones show,
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:46.000]  which are contributing to real-world terror.
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000]  No link to my real-world terror.
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000]  So obviously, I'm going to have to end up...
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000]  I've been looking for people that need to be sued for defamation.
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000]  They're lying to get me off air.
[02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000]  Malice will forethought and tend to do harm.
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:57.000]  I'm busy with stuff.
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000]  I don't have time to call up all day and say,
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:00.000]  you need to correct this,
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:04.000]  but I need to personally sue Sue Wilson
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.000]  so that the next time somebody gets their ADL,
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000]  Southern Property Law Center talking point,
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:13.000]  she knows she gets sued.
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000]  And I've been suing some people now.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  So Sue Wilson, I'm calling about you today.
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:22.000]  Because you say I'm endangering children.
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  You say I'm glorifying violence.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  Where's the damn link?
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:29.000]  And then they go on.
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000]  That's what the corporate media is now.
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  They're going to say that Jones admits
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.000]  he's a performance artist.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000]  No.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  My ex-wife in a custody battle starting two years ago,
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000]  my children are now with me 80% of the time,
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000]  by the way, the media lies and says they're not.
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000]  Says I lost that.
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  They are saying, because they wanted to introduce stuff
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000]  where I was dressed up in Joker paint saying,
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  drink your fluoride, kids.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  It makes you see pretty colors.
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  Then I showed real articles about it giving you cancer.
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  I don't do that a lot anymore.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:02.000]  I don't do a lot of fun stuff anymore
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  because they always take out of context.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  But my lawyer said, no, he was playing a part
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  to illustrate something.
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  Jack Nicholson, when he plays the Joker,
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  doesn't believe it either.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000]  They went, oh my God, Alex Jones says he's all fake.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:13.000]  No.
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  When I do a joke to illustrate atrazine sterilizing frogs,
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.000]  and I dress up like a frog, that's to make it go viral
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  so it gets out.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  And they know that.
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  That's why they don't show any of the things they claim.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  Right.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  They just say it.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  So they're going to say, I must be taken off the air.
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  And they cite all this stuff.
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  So there you go.
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.000]  YouTube bands, Proud Boys founder Gavin McGinnis,
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000]  that was a hoax that the FBI even called him extreme.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  But who cares they call him extreme?
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  He'll be taken off the air.
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  But now, taken off the air.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:46.000]  U.S. radio station is airing Alex Jones.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  Truth, I mean, so I wanted to get you on
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  and talk about mind control and all the rest of it.
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  Here we are showing real documents.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  Right.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  They say we're perpetuating hoaxes.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  No, that's not what's happening.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:59.000]  The hoaxes are what we see from the mainstream corporate news.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  They're the ones constantly caught lying.
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:02.000]  That's exactly it.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  And, you know, when you look at what people use the phrase
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:08.000]  conspiracy theory, that came out of these think tanks,
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  government think tanks.
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  How do you discredit someone really rapidly?
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  1964, people were questioning JFK.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  Type it in.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000]  CIA developed term.
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  That's it.
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  A conspiracy theorist to counter JFK researchers.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  That's exactly it.
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000]  And so when you look at this, and the same is true
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  with many aspects of these issues.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000]  When you go back historically and you start to look
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  at the historic record, it is whistleblowers
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:32.000]  that change history.
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  It is whistleblowers that bring out the truth.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000]  And when they come forward the first time,
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000]  they're slapped down almost inevitably.
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  Whistleblowers said we're injecting black people with cephalos.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  Took them 20 years to get it listened to.
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  But finally, it was true.
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  That's right.
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:46.000]  And meanwhile, several people died.
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  They continued these programs.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000]  You know, no one ever gave these programs up.
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  In fact, it was 2009 that the Navy adapted their new protocol
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  for mind control experiments.
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000]  It's right in the regulations.
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  They actually use the words, mind control requires
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  a deputy secretary of the Navy to approve that level.
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  But, you know, whether using what they say,
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  convicts or others for these experiments,
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  they need to be approved.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000]  So the fact is they're still doing it.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  When you look at the contracts let by DARPA,
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  and as John said in the last tonight,
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  they don't even hide this stuff anymore.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:20.000]  The fact of the matter is...
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  And there we are on TV.
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  We're also on TV around the country.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  There we are shelling it.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:26.000]  Right.
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  You know, here it is, the protocol.
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  You know, and so as you go through it,
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  you'll see the sections that deal with mind control.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000]  And you know, what about U.S. Code Title,
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  finish episode 32 of subsection 1528, paragraph 8?
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000]  I mean, that says right there,
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  as long as it's for law enforcement or other
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  than military purposes,
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000]  they can even do lethal testing on us.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  In fact, there was an agreement made,
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000]  and this is going back to the 80s.
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  We track this, you know, from the 80s,
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  where they began to cooperate,
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  Department of Justice and Department of Defense
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:55.000]  to find those technology to be transferred from defense
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:58.000]  to civil authorities for domestic policing.
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  And so you're taking military,
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  the highest types of military technologies,
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  and we've watched the militarization of police,
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:06.000]  of local police, taking...
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  LRADS, microwave guns.
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:09.000]  All of it.
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  You know, and you look at the hardware to stop vehicles,
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  you know, using EMPs.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.000]  You look at the stuff that's gradually transmitting
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:18.000]  out of DOD into Department of Justice
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  and then migrating into local law enforcement.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  And really, it's the federalization of local law enforcement.
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  You start to think about it,
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  because they always have a hook-it.
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  You want the grant, you got to play with it.
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000]  I forget what general it was like 10 years ago.
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:32.000]  Obama was doing illegal stuff, violating the...
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  It was when it was in the Air Force,
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  and he said we need to test on Americans first
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  before we test on our average.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  That's what he said, to get around the Geneva Convention.
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000]  He goes, it's okay, just test it here first,
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  then it gets around it.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  Right, because you can always do what you want to
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000]  on your own sovereign territory.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  So let's talk about that with the expert,
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  Nick Baggett, straight ahead,
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  their next offensive, their next war on talk radio.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000]  So you want to be sure it's the purest,
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000]  for you and your family.
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  For over 14 years,
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  thousands have depended on Berkey clean water.
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  The Berkey guy has you covered at home,
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000]  work, and on the go,
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  with water filtration systems of every size

[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000]  it's just as important to make sure your kids

[02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:02.000]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things
[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000]  that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights,
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:13.000]  the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:16.000]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations
[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:19.000]  and individuals taking those God-given rights
[02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:20.000]  from us as individuals.
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:21.000]  You better understand that,
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000]  because they're taking them right now.
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000]  They called it UN Agenda 21.
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:35.000]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000]  They want to pack everybody into the cities,
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000]  because that's where it is easiest
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000]  for them to control everyone.
[02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000]  It's The David Knight Show.
[02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000]  I never missed your show.
[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000]  Any day.
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:33:06.000]  I mean, never.
[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  Everybody loves Dr. Nick Beggach in studio.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.000]  He's riding his shotgun.
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000]  This will be on the war room today.
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000]  He's going to be back on the next few days.
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000]  I got some big surprises for you tomorrow.
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:35.000]  You'll want to tune in.
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:36.000]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.000]  But the newest salvo is the Soros Funded.
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.000]  I looked it up during the break.
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:45.000]  The Soros Funded Media Action Center
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000]  is now going to contact
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  all of us.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000]  We don't even list all of our affiliates.
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000]  I always talk to them and say,
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.000]  do you want to be listed or not?
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000]  So these idiots don't even know what they're doing.
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:56.000]  But they're contacting them,
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  all threatening them,
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000]  saying you're airing someone that
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000]  endangered children is a racist
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:02.000]  and calls for violence.
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000]  And then the Sacramento Bee doesn't show
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  where I said it.
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  The definition of malice and forethought
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000]  with intent to do harm.
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:12.000]  They say I'm doing all these bad things
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000]  and then don't show the proof and say,
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000]  remove me.
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:19.000]  And Gavin McGinnis is taken off YouTube
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  right after CRTV.
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:21.000]  Glenn Beck takes over.
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  And then magically,
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000]  he's taken off for being number one.
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  And that's what they're really afraid of
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:28.000]  is a guy saying men are men.
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000]  America is a good thing.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  He launched a vice.
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000]  He launched the whole trendy movement.
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:34.000]  Now he hates it.
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:37.000]  He launched the whole beard deal.
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:40.000]  So this is here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000]  They fear people that are effective
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  and able to take action.
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000]  Roger Stone's going to be popping in
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  with the latest on the announcements
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  that they are going to arrest Trump.
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  That's what's killing the stock market.
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:51.000]  Even though they can't do that,
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.000]  they're saying it to undermine the economy.
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:59.000]  But this purge is accelerating.
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.000]  And President Trump,
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000]  I know he's surrounded by a bunch of cowards,
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  but the Congress,
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  everyone must take action right now
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000]  because the so-called left in this country
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:10.000]  is a clear and present danger.
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  I mean, they're like Cuban censors or something.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  Well, you know, the Sacramento Bee that ran that article.
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000]  Sacramento Bee used to be a decent newspaper
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  once upon a time.
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000]  And they used to do actual reporting.
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  And it's that kind of paper that used to come out
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:27.000]  and defend the right of free speech.
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  Here's the press ganging up on someone else
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000]  as a contrary opinion.
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  This is what the free press is about
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  as contrary opinion.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:37.000]  Well, that's the thing is now I'm being sued
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000]  by Georgetown with made up crap
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  by the journalism department.
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  The journalism department's now been made obsolete
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  by the internet,
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000]  so their job is now killing their competition.
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000]  And I think that's really, really it.
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.000]  I mean, there was one of the major guys
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000]  tried to launch his own program,
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.000]  and he couldn't even get any viewers.
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  They had a viewer account.
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000]  If you remember, they had the viewer account up in the corner.
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  Anderson Cooper.
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:00.000]  Right.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:03.000]  He was paying $18 million to produce 20 shows,
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000]  and they even shot it in the wrong aspect ratio
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000]  to make it look like it was grassroots
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  and put in fake sounds.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000]  They were looping sounds at the Pentagon,
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  but they would stop.
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:12.000]  Right.
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:13.000]  And it was literally,
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:14.000]  he was on an hour, 4,000 watched.
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  Right.
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:16.000]  And I could turn,
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000]  when I was on, I could video paint drying,
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000]  and a million would watch.
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:21.000]  Right.
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  And they had to, they had to really,
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000]  I mean, it was a total disaster to take the viewer counter off
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  because it was so embarrassing.
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  And this is the difference,
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000]  is people are seeking out alternative news media
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.000]  because it's not about, it's not fake news.
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000]  It's challenging the status quo.
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:37.000]  And the status quo does not like to be challenged,
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  particularly by those that they cannot control.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.000]  Well, I'm not trying to whine here,
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  but you know, it's Christmas time.
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000]  This is the part of the year that we go into the black,
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:48.000]  and I'm selling everything out at cost or below
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:49.000]  because they're trying to shut us down.
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  I want to have money a few months into the next year
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000]  while I develop a backup plan to go back to sponsors,
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:57.000]  which we've got a lot of sponsors lined up.
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  It's not enough to keep everybody employed.
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:00.000]  It's not enough to expand,
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:03.000]  but hopefully it will get more sponsors.
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  But I've got a plan B,
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000]  but I need to sell everything to have money
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  go a few months into the next year.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  Yeah, we're a ship at war.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000]  We're under attack.
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000]  We need everybody to go to infowarstore.com.
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  It's free shipping.
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  It's 50 to 75% off.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.000]  Total year in clearance.
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000]  We've never done a sale anywhere near this.
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  Most of these we lose money on, okay?
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:26.000]  So do your Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com.
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000]  Do it there instead of, you know,

[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000]  You know, Earth Pulse, Earth Rising.
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:50.000]  I've read all your stuff.
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000]  In fact, do a brief plug when we're going to Roger.
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  You stay with us about your books and videos
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  that are infowarstore.com.
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:56.000]  There they are.
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000]  We've got all of them.
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:02.000]  We have our books, videos, technology, 21st century,
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  mind control, two excellent videos.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  One we were talking about earlier with David Knight was
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  Earth Changes, which is also in the store.
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  Two leading books in the bookstore,
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:14.000]  Controlling the Human Mind and Angels Don't Play This Harp.
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  Classics and well-referenced.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  Hundreds of reference sources.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  And you read these books you wrote decades ago.
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.000]  Some of them are new.
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:21.000]  Some of them are.
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  And it's like, wow, that all came true.
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  Well, it was already true.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:24.000]  Right.
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000]  Now, let's expand on this.
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  The good news is they just had to get Tim Cook
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  with the Slave Factories in China and all the rest of it
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000]  in line with the globalists to censor us
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  and the rest of the tech followed.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000]  Most of our radio stations, and I don't want to even kind of,
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  but I'm not Machiavellian.
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  So I always tell people the Machiavellian trick.
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000]  My whole art is telling the truth and telling you
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  how the rabbit trick works.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000]  So magicians hate me, because I'm the master magician
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  that shows you how it works, because I don't like magicians.
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  So what we're dealing with here, ladies and gentlemen is,
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  when they tell radio stations that actually listen every day
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000]  and know what we're saying and talk radio's been harassed
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  for decades by the left to take me off, guess what happens?
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  We go from overnight to primetime.
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  So, but I can't help it.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  I got it because the left never believes me.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:10.000]  So I got to tell them, and they'll probably harass a few stations
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  to go away.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  But the point is, is that this type of crap is owned
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  because those stations are already away.
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  Most of the program directors or owners are already listeners.
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  So this new harassment is going to blow up in their face.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  Roger Stone, man, I told you, hey, thank God, we've got talk radio.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  We've expanded the TV and cable.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  It's exploding.
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000]  That's what they're really scared of.
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000]  They block this and clear expansion.
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:35.000]  They're scared of anybody challenging the dying cable network.
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  Even Fox News is scared.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  So they kind of join in on this behind the scenes and in briefings
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000]  where they supported CNN.
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  But now they are figuring out where the big fat juicy enchilada is.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  Where the actual giant audience still is.
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  It's just not trackable.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  So the internet acts like it doesn't exist.
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  Because Facebook wants talk radio to die.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  But just like they were getting rid of free speech in the 80s.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  So we rediscovered AM radio was going bankrupt and made it into
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000]  something that's made hundreds of billions of dollars.
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  We have to rediscover broadcast radio and people are doing it.
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  And then those can be stations that then retransmit our shows over the internet,
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  restream them and make those the new ecosystems.
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:12.000]  Because what did the left say?
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  We want local internet and local news band.
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  That's what caused the French uprising.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  And technically it's true, but overall it's a fraud.
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000]  Yes, people are allowed to communicate.
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:23.000]  Isn't horrible.
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  Now George Soros Group wants all local news band.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  That was officially announced this week.
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:29.000]  I mean, my God.
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  So now it goes from the KKK to, you know, child molesters.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  Well, they're promoting that actually to Alex Jones.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:38.000]  Now it's banned everybody, Roger Stone.
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  You know, Alex, it looks to me like a clear cut case of torches interference.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  I think you've got a hell of a lawsuit there.
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:50.000]  It's amazing the extent to which info wars and what we do here just scares the
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:56.000]  daylights out of the globalists, scares the daylights out of the two party duopoly
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  that's run this country into the ground.
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  And the future of the Trump agenda, the future of the reform agenda,
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:08.000]  the prospects for the president's reelection, indeed, the president's legacy
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  is completely contingent on our continued ability to communicate,
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  either through the internet or through talk radio or frankly any medium we can find.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.000]  What you just said is the key.
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000]  What did Stalin, what did Lenin say?
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  Give me the telephones of the trains.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  I'll take a country over.
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  The globalist are taking our communications away and openly saying they're going
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  to arrest our president and arrest all of us.
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000]  So everybody better get really aggressive.
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  This is not a normal political climate.
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  Get active now, Dr. Becker.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:40.000]  Yeah, you know, one thing I would point out, you know, as Alex said,
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  the next wave is going to be to try and ban other radio programs.
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  So everyone that's listening to this broadcast, make a note of your radio station
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  manager's phone number and name.
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  And the day that happens, you get on the phone and you start harassing them
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  and call them and get them on back on the air.
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  Well, we'll be on that.
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  You call them now and thank them.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  You become a sponsor.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:58.000]  You tell them it's all BS.
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  That's right. Get on there.
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  Show the support.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  Now's the time.
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:02.000]  Let's keep them on the air.
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000]  This is the most vital time in our history.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  Think back on Ross Perot when he ran.
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:10.000]  And you remember what they did to Chuck Carter, who was one of his reporters?
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:13.000]  They crushed him and they came in stealth.
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  They came in when he needed the financing.
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:18.000]  And somebody shows up from the Painters Union.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  They financed him.
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  And when he had the first financial Twitter, they took over and they took his microwave.
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  They had an IRS agent in his office for three years auditing him because he was a nonprofit.
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  So that was another way they came in at him.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:36.000]  So it's not the first time, but this is the most important time right now.
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  Wow.
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  It's insane.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:42.000]  I mean, we're actually fighting for the country, our children, our progeny.
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:45.000]  So don't thank us, folks, getting the fight now.
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  You're not supposed to thank us for doing this.
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:48.000]  Engage it.
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  We're supposed to be doing this.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000]  I mean, my God, we're under attack.
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  We're getting our beds beaten here.
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  Let's get up and kick their ass politically.
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:04.000]  Info wars has been proven absolutely on target about world government, the attack on the family, the eugenics, operations, the whole thing.
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  We've been proven dead on.
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:09.000]  You've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project.
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:12.000]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do.
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  Thank you and salute you all.
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  Words are not enough to think about of all the different systems of all the different political ideologies that you have been on target,
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:28.000]  promoting Americana and Renaissance and open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force.
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other,
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:38.000]  but we have cut right to the chase human liberty, a pro human future versus the globalist anti human future.
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  That's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember that info wars really is your baby.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack and we just need you to go to info wars.com
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  and do your Christmas shopping there and get the best deals ever and funding info war a true 360 win.
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  In the last few months, info wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best selling items.
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:08.000]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store wide 50 to 75% off double Patriot points.
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:14.000]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified super blue,
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  you'll get a free gift of a best selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:27.000]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:32.000]  So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next quarter.
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  So this is a loss leader.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000]  We are losing money on this.
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:45.000]  Get your free gift.
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  You're free shipping everything.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:52.000]  And don't fight the crowds info wars store dot com info wars life dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:53.000]  God bless you.
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  And thank you for your support.
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:45:04.000]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018 info wars is proud to introduce the 12 days of Christmas.
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:13.000]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:21.000]  So get great products and help funding info right now with the 12 days of Christmas that is special amongst a group of incredible sales.

[02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:54.000]  As we prepare to close it out I want to thank you all again for making the entire info war possible.
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000]  Again you are the resistance.
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:05.000]  Everybody knows that history documents it but there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history that wants to hurt children.
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:06.000]  They want to abort children.
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  They want to disease children.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:09.000]  They want to abuse children.
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:10.000]  They want to confuse children.
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000]  They want their essence.
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:13.000]  They want their soul.
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  They want their spirit.
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:17.000]  They want their power because they are our future.
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:22.000]  And this Christmas remember it is about Jesus Christ not ultimate sacrifice.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:23.000]  It is about the West.
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:28.000]  It is about a human future and standing with each other and believing in a better future.
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:33.000]  But I want to ask you all to pray for your own family.
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:34.000]  To pray for America.
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  To pray for President Trump.
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  To pray for info wars.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  And to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000]  You have the power to override the sensors.
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000]  I know you have been taking action and I salute you.
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000]  But just remember I know you are humble.
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  But just remember you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:29.000]  And there is a smarty connector.
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  If you want to move down he have got a job, buddy.
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:38.260]  People love Ian's studio and of course Roger Stone works for them floors. He's here and I've just been ranting about it changed the whole subject off into this but
[02:47:39.700 --> 02:47:48.100]  Roger Stone, I mean we've got you in EU troops invading Paris foreign troops taking it over from the first time since World War two and Hitler got kicked out
[02:47:48.340 --> 02:47:51.580]  We've got the Democrats everywhere saying that they're gonna put Trump in jail
[02:47:51.580 --> 02:47:57.180]  Which obviously kills the stock market even though it's not true. They know what they're doing the crimes. They're committing
[02:47:57.180 --> 02:48:04.880]  I mean you live through the Nixon era you worked in 10 presidential campaigns. I've never seen anything approaching this and it's so dangerous in my view
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:12.880]  Well, Alex if you look at an interview I gave to the Washington examiner last Thursday, I predicted exactly what would happen here
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:19.360]  I said that the Mueller probe had a purpose of removing the president and undoing the results of the
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:22.640]  2016 election on any basis necessary
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:27.060]  We now have Democrats like Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff
[02:48:27.460 --> 02:48:33.600]  And others saying with a straight face and on the basis of what is at best a campaign
[02:48:34.060 --> 02:48:38.100]  Finance violation although I question even there might be a $2,000 fine
[02:48:38.660 --> 02:48:42.060]  The Donald Trump should be removed that he is headed to prison
[02:48:42.340 --> 02:48:49.020]  You've got congressman Juan Castro congressman Adam Schiff predicting that Roger Stone will be
[02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:57.340]  Prosecuted for perjury before the House Intelligence Committee, which is completely wrong because every word I said before the committee is provably
[02:48:57.340 --> 02:49:00.620]  But you called all this his lawyers lied and said you're not the target now
[02:49:00.620 --> 02:49:04.780]  He knows he is the target Obama got tens of millions illegal contributions
[02:49:04.780 --> 02:49:06.420]  He admitted to it paid a $4,000 fine
[02:49:06.420 --> 02:49:09.580]  So we know that and Hillary has billions in bad ones
[02:49:09.580 --> 02:49:15.420]  So this whole and this was even his money and then Cohen this known liar says that oh he told him do it to the campaign
[02:49:15.420 --> 02:49:21.260]  Why the hell would you do that? So they literally have a crooked toenail. Well, they've got 15 dead kids in the back of the van
[02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:25.260]  So but but you predicted what was coming not tell us what's coming next rogers
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:32.320]  Well, the president clearly appears to be moving to a war footing the replacement of John Kelly his chief of staff
[02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:40.100]  predicted here weeks ago actually months ago on info wars has now taken place by the way by the way some of our
[02:49:40.100 --> 02:49:45.980]  CIA sources that we know are double dealers went eight when the word Kelly was fired really three weeks ago
[02:49:46.140 --> 02:49:52.360]  They got very threatening at the point Kelly was removed. He was their guy. So they thought they were in control that means the war is full on
[02:49:52.500 --> 02:49:54.500]  Why was Kelly removed?
[02:49:54.860 --> 02:50:01.500]  The Kelly was removed because he believed that his job was to restrain Donald Trump and prepare him for the slaughter
[02:50:01.580 --> 02:50:04.900]  He felt his job was to walk him into the blades
[02:50:04.900 --> 02:50:09.740]  And if you look at the short list of those under consideration
[02:50:10.020 --> 02:50:17.260]  To be the new chief of staff now that Nick Ayers who was a quizzling for vice president Mike Pence has been eliminated
[02:50:17.620 --> 02:50:20.500]  Every one of the those being mentioned Mark Meadows
[02:50:20.980 --> 02:50:26.100]  The congressman Mick Mulvaney the OMB director for example
[02:50:26.380 --> 02:50:33.300]  Or even Matthew Whitaker the current acting attorney general these men are patriots these men are Trump
[02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:39.740]  And that's why they're so scared. That's why they're so shrill right now is because Trump now knows Kelly was stringing him along
[02:50:39.940 --> 02:50:43.820]  You know, this is a pretty standard, you know, there's to put someone into someone's staff
[02:50:43.820 --> 02:50:49.220]  This is pretty much the way it works. We've had them do a touch. They embed it all the time and they literally sabotage
[02:50:49.220 --> 02:50:54.500]  Yeah, and a lot of your face. That's exactly it and this is part of the protocols, you know, how does your dad deal with it?
[02:50:54.820 --> 02:50:56.820]  man, I'll tell you
[02:50:57.500 --> 02:50:59.400]  On the federal level
[02:50:59.400 --> 02:51:04.300]  My brother mark at the end of the Senate was pretty fed up. In fact when asked to run again
[02:51:04.300 --> 02:51:08.340]  He wouldn't do it because I don't want to go. He was gonna win. He's just I'm done. He just you know
[02:51:08.900 --> 02:51:11.220]  Looking at it again, you know where he was this year was
[02:51:11.860 --> 02:51:18.660]  You can't get anything done. It's gridlock. You cannot push an agenda to change right now. There's not real compromise
[02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:24.220]  No, there's only the Democrats way and my brother voted more with Republicans than any other Democrat
[02:51:24.220 --> 02:51:30.060]  In the US and he got attacked for that and he did he got brutalized for that because he didn't play ball and
[02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:34.740]  And that's you know, that's the nature of true leadership, right? We play ball with the public
[02:51:34.740 --> 02:51:36.740]  We don't play ball without the politicians
[02:51:37.060 --> 02:51:41.940]  And I think this is a this is the big all officers to know this everything's been frantic and crazy and we've said oh
[02:51:41.940 --> 02:51:47.780]  This is incredible. This is it's building. It's building. Everyone knows the energy level in the world is now conk
[02:51:47.780 --> 02:51:54.700]  Cuckoo lat land insane and and it's just crazy and I would say you haven't seen anything yet
[02:51:54.700 --> 02:51:58.660]  I think it's gonna get more into so what you you predict a lot of timelines 20 years ago
[02:51:58.660 --> 02:52:01.500]  And I heard you on Art Bell and I heard you play some of that sounds like a smart guy
[02:52:01.500 --> 02:52:03.140]  Let me read his books and I got you on my show
[02:52:03.140 --> 02:52:04.980]  But it was all true it all happened
[02:52:04.980 --> 02:52:09.700]  So you predicted stuff would start one crazy 2016 and he said into 2020 a big quickening show
[02:52:09.980 --> 02:52:14.740]  Have timelines changed is still accurate. I still see it the same way. I really do
[02:52:14.740 --> 02:52:21.580]  How are you able to see it? What I did is I took all of the literature and and read it and and it clearly points to direction
[02:52:21.580 --> 02:52:27.940]  Not just from government, but across a lot of disciplines, you know when you look at science you look at social everything's kind of lining up
[02:52:27.940 --> 02:52:30.620]  It really is lining up and when you look at
[02:52:30.980 --> 02:52:33.340]  Sort of the underlying aspects of human beings
[02:52:33.340 --> 02:52:39.860]  We create our reality on a fundamental level and we are seeing it played out and we have all been manipulated in this fear
[02:52:39.860 --> 02:52:45.060]  Mentality in a fear mentality brings you the chaos we see in the world today. We need to reclaim our birthright
[02:52:45.340 --> 02:52:53.020]  Recognize what we are as creative human beings recognize the divinity that we are and the fact that only a few people are needed to make huge
[02:52:53.180 --> 02:52:58.300]  Changes look what's happened with Alex Jones. I mean I worked with him since he was doing public access TV
[02:52:58.300 --> 02:53:02.860]  He has built a network that is so powerful every globalist in the world wants to shut him down
[02:53:02.860 --> 02:53:10.500]  Everyone watching this broadcast you can do it too become a committee you want take action step into the fight and join
[02:53:10.780 --> 02:53:13.860]  Info wars on educating the public in this country
[02:53:13.860 --> 02:53:18.540]  That's how we do and they want to take our victory getting Trump in other things and then credit toxic
[02:53:18.540 --> 02:53:23.540]  Critic straw man and make everybody ashamed of it. No celebrate the victory and we even if I get destroyed it's not a failure
[02:53:23.540 --> 02:53:25.540]  We already changed the world together Roger
[02:53:25.700 --> 02:53:27.820]  No, I think that's exactly right Alex
[02:53:27.820 --> 02:53:37.180]  I mean if you watch CNN or MSNBC you see that near hysterical flogging of their agenda of removal for this president on
[02:53:37.380 --> 02:53:42.460]  The thinnest of reads having come up completely empty-handed with Russian collusion
[02:53:42.460 --> 02:53:46.740]  I haven't even mentioned it anymore other than to try to imply that Michael Cohn's
[02:53:47.260 --> 02:53:54.700]  Exploration of a Russian-based real estate deal that never actually happened somehow constitutes collusion that allows them to get Russia
[02:53:54.700 --> 02:54:01.340]  Into the headline for the more no way Trump's got he's got towers in China in Japan in
[02:54:01.820 --> 02:54:08.180]  Africa in Eastern Europe all over Europe. I mean there's he's got a couple hundred that are his then his names on thousands
[02:54:08.180 --> 02:54:14.540]  I mean, it's ridiculous like so if he ever built something in Russia. He's a Russian agent. No, and this is ridiculous
[02:54:14.540 --> 02:54:16.540]  I mean the fact the matter is
[02:54:17.700 --> 02:54:22.220]  Russia is not our adversary in the way that it's being characterized by the media
[02:54:22.220 --> 02:54:29.700]  This is a ploy again to get us back into this Cold War mindset that accelerates the military industrial
[02:54:31.980 --> 02:54:37.020]  Educational complex and political complex and it's a way to continue to churn out
[02:54:37.020 --> 02:54:42.340]  How did the left become these breathless Russia haters that want war? I don't love the FBI
[02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:43.620]  I just don't get it, you know
[02:54:43.620 --> 02:54:50.340]  I had this actually had a debate about the FBI with my mother right because the FBI withheld information on my father's
[02:54:50.340 --> 02:54:54.180]  Disappearance and then recently my my mom and my family are Democrats
[02:54:54.180 --> 02:54:58.980]  I'm not and we ended up in this really serious debate about trusting the FBI and and
[02:54:59.820 --> 02:55:07.020]  After all these years, this is where fundamentally I disagree because the FBI is as dishonest now as it was then
[02:55:07.020 --> 02:55:11.220]  It's as corrupt now as it was under the Hooverdman about legendary your dad went down with hail bogs
[02:55:11.220 --> 02:55:15.580]  That's right and hail bogs was uh, you know, he was a house majority leader
[02:55:15.580 --> 02:55:24.140]  Um, he was someone challenging the status quo. He was hated by by Nixon and Hoover particularly because he actually called on
[02:55:24.700 --> 02:55:31.460]  On April 6th the year that he disappeared for the resignation of Hoover and for him to be gone and past that he was literally
[02:55:32.380 --> 02:55:37.420]  Doing wealth transfers of government land, which we did in the old Western expansion to the people
[02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:40.100]  They were really scared of that right and corporations are like no no
[02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:46.100]  We're not doing this and this was a 44 million acre land transfer that my dad did as a freshman congressman
[02:55:46.260 --> 02:55:50.620]  To the indigenous of Alaska and this was unheard of we have one congressman from Alaska
[02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:56.940]  He had to convince the majority of 430 34 of his colleagues in the Senate and he did it
[02:55:56.940 --> 02:56:03.860]  He was able to accomplish it and and pave the way for the industrial development of Alaska and and today the stuff
[02:56:03.860 --> 02:56:09.580]  Trump is doing he opened up anwar we've been fighting for this since that time and he finally did it something that
[02:56:09.580 --> 02:56:13.620]  Republicans and Democrats have been united about in Alaska for four decades
[02:56:13.620 --> 02:56:19.420]  It finally happened over the objections that of the national Democratic everything Trump does is contrarian to the establishment
[02:56:19.540 --> 02:56:24.620]  Roger. Well, what's coming next for the president? He obviously is on a war footing now. He looks really pissed
[02:56:26.460 --> 02:56:32.460]  Word is he was there were some threats issued at the funeral actually went there and there were little special notes given each person
[02:56:32.460 --> 02:56:35.740]  I've confirmed that went on you watch the video. It's already out. I never got to it
[02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:40.500]  I'm gonna go over and air it next hour, but the word is Trump is now fire-breathing angry
[02:56:41.620 --> 02:56:45.220]  That's what I'm hearing and clearly the the
[02:56:46.340 --> 02:56:48.180]  Moving out of Kelly
[02:56:48.180 --> 02:56:51.780]  the the placement of a new council getting rid of
[02:56:53.140 --> 02:56:59.500]  Don McGahn who was a quisling actually an informant for Robert Mueller as we now know
[02:56:59.980 --> 02:57:04.380]  These all move the president to a preparation for all-out war
[02:57:04.380 --> 02:57:11.260]  Alex, I would urge you to read Michael Goodwin's piece in the New York Post where Goodwin and two of his colleagues
[02:57:11.620 --> 02:57:16.740]  Interviewed the president last Sunday not this most recent Sunday, but the previous Sunday
[02:57:16.740 --> 02:57:20.780]  I think it tells you everything you need to know the president knows that he has the
[02:57:21.340 --> 02:57:27.940]  Information in his hands that if declassified will send Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and their ilk John Brennan
[02:57:27.940 --> 02:57:31.020]  Oh that clapper to president which we think is good news
[02:57:31.020 --> 02:57:36.580]  Let's do five minutes with both of you, but it they're cornered rats. It's there. There's no it's a death battle politically
[02:57:36.580 --> 02:57:41.660]  There's no more half measures no more scratcher back on scratchers. There's no more let's money go into abstentia
[02:57:42.020 --> 02:57:44.020]  It's they're not gonna stop
[02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:49.660]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[02:57:50.140 --> 02:57:55.580]  Seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body
[02:57:55.580 --> 02:58:01.940]  That's why I'm introducing the shield toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA
[02:58:01.940 --> 02:58:08.900]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war
[02:58:08.900 --> 02:58:14.700]  It is a classical 360 when this is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[02:58:14.700 --> 02:58:21.540]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get you want to yourself
[02:58:21.540 --> 02:58:25.820]  You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that
[02:58:26.020 --> 02:58:33.380]  Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you the remnant of America to
[02:58:33.540 --> 02:58:39.540]  Reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your prayers together
[02:58:39.540 --> 02:58:44.500]  We're changing the world now. It's time to change our bodies with z-field info wars life comm
[02:58:44.500 --> 02:58:52.460]  Please whatever you do realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship and you saw 18 Twitter accounts
[02:58:52.460 --> 02:58:55.780]  They say affiliated with info wars. Yes, some of them are like little side accounts
[02:58:55.780 --> 02:58:58.820]  They know we had like info were stored that just showed our products
[02:58:58.820 --> 02:59:05.540]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I beat a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us
[02:59:05.540 --> 02:59:07.260]  You're excitement about America
[02:59:07.260 --> 02:59:10.940]  You're excited about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick
[02:59:10.940 --> 02:59:16.860]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future
[02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:25.220]  I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially
[02:59:25.220 --> 02:59:28.180]  I want to push all the way. I've committed to do that
[02:59:28.180 --> 02:59:31.300]  I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen
[02:59:31.300 --> 02:59:35.340]  But you've got a back ish and I promise you this I will never falter
[02:59:35.340 --> 02:59:41.460]  I will never waver at the spiritual level. I physically will but I give you my commitment if you financially support us
[02:59:41.460 --> 02:59:45.620]  And for short calm to give you my absolute total commitment
[02:59:49.380 --> 02:59:52.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:59:52.220 --> 03:00:07.740]  We now take you live to the central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance
[03:00:07.740 --> 03:00:09.740]  It's Alex Jones
[03:00:09.740 --> 03:00:18.540]  All right, so I've been ranting here
[03:00:20.540 --> 03:00:25.500]  I'm gonna introduce Mike Adams next segment let you guys get back to what you're doing but Roger Stone and of course
[03:00:25.500 --> 03:00:31.060]  We've got Nick Baggess here don't Nick Baggess in closing both you in two minutes Roger bottom line
[03:00:31.060 --> 03:00:37.020]  This is an incredible time in history things are accelerating into insanity all over the world nationalist uprisings
[03:00:37.020 --> 03:00:39.980]  Good things are happening, but the globalist are counter-striking
[03:00:42.060 --> 03:00:44.060]  Gut level what do we do Roger
[03:00:44.740 --> 03:00:49.220]  Well, Alex, this is all coming to a head either the president will take out his
[03:00:49.780 --> 03:00:57.700]  Adversaries or they will take him out, but this is now a situation in which they have abandoned all pretents about impeachment
[03:00:58.100 --> 03:01:02.700]  They tried to soft-pedal it during the election because it doesn't pull out with the American people
[03:01:02.700 --> 03:01:10.140]  I think a vote of the Democrats in the house to impeach Donald Trump will be an overplaying of their hand very similar to when the
[03:01:10.180 --> 03:01:17.340]  House Republicans overplayed their hand seeking to impeach Bill Clinton over sex in the Oval Office with an intern
[03:01:17.580 --> 03:01:20.100]  rather than the mass sale of
[03:01:20.700 --> 03:01:28.180]  Missile guidance technology to the Chinese a treasonous crime that he would still today even be prosecuted before
[03:01:28.180 --> 03:01:34.860]  So I think there's an enormous overreach here. The Americans public has no appetite
[03:01:35.660 --> 03:01:37.260]  for impeachment
[03:01:37.260 --> 03:01:42.300]  Unless they can tube this economy if they can take the economy down
[03:01:42.300 --> 03:01:44.300]  They know that's the most important factor
[03:01:44.780 --> 03:01:51.580]  propping Donald Trump up and supplying his current level of public support and that is of course my greatest fear
[03:01:51.980 --> 03:01:56.900]  Something you Alex have been predicting now for several months. Well, they said they're gonna do it
[03:01:56.900 --> 03:02:02.460]  It's it's not hard to predict it. I just can't believe they might do a global meltdown to stop other nationalists as well
[03:02:02.460 --> 03:02:08.020]  They're openly threatening that that is a very very arrogant level to go to and it shows how desperate they are
[03:02:08.020 --> 03:02:09.220]  We need to inform the public
[03:02:09.220 --> 03:02:13.820]  That's what they want to soft the air that it's the globalists openly doing this so they get the blame not nationalists
[03:02:13.940 --> 03:02:16.740]  Roger tomorrow you and I have got a very special show
[03:02:16.740 --> 03:02:22.180]  We're gonna leave it for that for everybody, but I'll be seeing you very very soon and God bless you and we'll talk tonight
[03:02:22.180 --> 03:02:28.820]  Godspeed all right in closing Nick back. It's awesome having you in studio. Everybody loves you're at the office too
[03:02:29.180 --> 03:02:33.700]  Mike Adams is coming up closing comments. You know, I think this is the age
[03:02:33.700 --> 03:02:37.660]  This is the age. We're gonna make the difference or we're gonna see this thing totally fold up
[03:02:37.660 --> 03:02:42.340]  And I'm not willing to say that I'm a I'm a pathological optimist. I believe in this listening audience
[03:02:42.340 --> 03:02:44.940]  I believe in the power of the media and more importantly
[03:02:44.940 --> 03:02:50.420]  I believe in the power of the alternative media the true media the media that gives us the information to make the changes in the
[03:02:50.420 --> 03:02:55.420]  World that we need right now and I just appreciate being here and I always enjoy working with the team and
[03:02:56.140 --> 03:03:00.380]  One of the best programs that I work with nationally and I work with hundreds over the last 20 years
[03:03:00.380 --> 03:03:02.380]  You're doing a great job. Of course, Mike Adams is coming up
[03:03:02.740 --> 03:03:07.060]  That's a whole other subject you usually do a counter think with them or when you guessed us some time
[03:03:07.060 --> 03:03:13.260]  Yeah, yeah, or when he gets those you should come on his research and they admit it the weird manipulation the atmosphere that you've pioneered
[03:03:13.260 --> 03:03:16.220]  Exposing now they admit so much of it if you look at all what they're doing
[03:03:16.220 --> 03:03:23.740]  It looks like they're trying to collapse it or change it. Yeah, it is about that and it's about a manipulation of population manipulation of
[03:03:24.140 --> 03:03:26.380]  How things work in the world in fact
[03:03:26.380 --> 03:03:32.980]  It was Rumsfeld who wanted to get rid of the environmental treaties that forbid the use of the relevant of these weapons because they would allow us to
[03:03:32.980 --> 03:03:38.580]  To wage covert wars and using the environment as the weapon where you have plausible deniability
[03:03:39.100 --> 03:03:43.820]  Absolutely, but you can bring a country to its knees and then they invite you in to help them rebuild it
[03:03:43.820 --> 03:03:50.220]  So so expanding on that bottom line in 30s or 60 seconds weather weapons weather modification
[03:03:50.340 --> 03:03:54.780]  There's huge projects going on. What's the in game? Are they still testing or they gone operation?
[03:03:54.780 --> 03:04:00.820]  No, these are operational in fact the Chinese are probably now moving moving further ahead than we are they're actually using it for
[03:04:01.620 --> 03:04:07.540]  Rainmaking throughout the country. They're using it openly and overtly and this is not any any longer theory
[03:04:07.540 --> 03:04:13.420]  This is fact the only thing that's getting better is their ability to manipulate a more precision and a more precise way
[03:04:14.780 --> 03:04:18.580]  And it's all we're all in a giant laboratory with mad scientists now
[03:04:18.580 --> 03:04:23.180]  They admit gene-edited humans are already here human come here as we always knew in the literature
[03:04:23.180 --> 03:04:27.380]  They admit it but now they're gonna roll it out 5g. It's just all there
[03:04:27.380 --> 03:04:33.340]  Yes, it is and it's here now and this is a generation that will decide are we free or are we slave?
[03:04:33.340 --> 03:04:39.460]  And that's why they take out of tens of thousands of hours and 20 something years of shows a few little weird things out of context
[03:04:39.460 --> 03:04:45.540]  To then make that what info wars is because they don't people remembering that info wars told the truth and was right and in fours
[03:04:45.540 --> 03:04:52.300]  Isn't Alan Jones. It's like Adams. It's Nick Beckett. It's all of you spreading the word person to person overriding the sensors

[03:05:57.400 --> 03:06:09.960]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news. It's Alex Jones
[03:06:27.400 --> 03:06:29.400]  I want to
[03:06:29.600 --> 03:06:32.880]  Air a little piece for Mike Adams takes over from January
[03:06:33.800 --> 03:06:35.560]  7th
[03:06:35.560 --> 03:06:37.560]  2017
[03:06:38.440 --> 03:06:44.160]  About a week and a half before Trump got inaugurated and the name of the video Alex Jones says
[03:06:46.960 --> 03:06:52.120]  Alex Jones says Trump is just the start bigger waves are coming
[03:06:52.120 --> 03:06:54.120]  Now
[03:06:58.280 --> 03:07:03.800]  When I made this point, I said populism nationalism's gonna take over the planet for classical liberalism
[03:07:04.280 --> 03:07:11.080]  Now classical liberalism is the opposite of the modern left and Prager University has the best little five-minute video on this
[03:07:12.320 --> 03:07:14.320]  That is titled
[03:07:17.760 --> 03:07:20.560]  Leftist versus liberals the difference between leftists and liberals
[03:07:20.560 --> 03:07:26.520]  To totally different things leftist are super hyper authoritarian
[03:07:27.280 --> 03:07:31.040]  Devil or spurs. I mean literally the Jacobins French Revolution were devil or spurs
[03:07:32.760 --> 03:07:36.840]  That's in the encyclopedia and that's what it's modeled after left hand path
[03:07:37.960 --> 03:07:41.040]  Prager presents left or liberal that's another video
[03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:46.400]  Of course YouTube's tried to ban them. They've had to suit even stay on because it's so accurate
[03:07:46.400 --> 03:07:50.440]  So I say we're want a liberal civilization
[03:07:50.440 --> 03:07:56.080]  That means more of your money more power more pro-human more right to self-defense the maximum
[03:07:56.400 --> 03:07:59.880]  Freedom that the general public can have without society collapsing
[03:08:01.520 --> 03:08:08.040]  Well, they know that's our strength true liberalism so they take it over they completely change it and turn it into the fascism the
[03:08:08.400 --> 03:08:10.400]  authoritarianism that the power cult it is now
[03:08:10.400 --> 03:08:15.200]  But you look at Congresswoman about to get into Congress in just a few weeks
[03:08:16.920 --> 03:08:20.040]  Alexander Cortez threatens Donald Trump Jr. with subpoena over meme
[03:08:20.800 --> 03:08:25.000]  Can we pull up the color version? That's if people can see it. Thanks. They put this meme out
[03:08:25.800 --> 03:08:29.800]  Donald Jr. Did why are you afraid of a socialist economy showing Cortez?
[03:08:30.160 --> 03:08:34.160]  Trump says because Americans she actually said that by the way because Americans want to
[03:08:34.640 --> 03:08:38.640]  Walk their dogs not eat them because they ate all the dogs about three four years ago
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:40.640]  And then they ate everything else in
[03:08:40.800 --> 03:08:45.960]  Venezuela even though it's so rich. He's been richer on average in the US citizens just 50 years ago
[03:08:46.600 --> 03:08:52.040]  So you've got this this this this corrupt lady and she says I've got subpoena power
[03:08:55.320 --> 03:09:01.800]  She said I have noticed that junior here has a habit of posting nonsense about me whenever the Mueller investigation eats up
[03:09:01.800 --> 03:09:09.520]  Please keep it coming junior. It's definitely very very large brain. I did a troll a member of a body
[03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:11.920]  That will have subpoena power in a month have fun
[03:09:12.400 --> 03:09:16.080]  No, no, he knows you're an authoritarian knuckle dragon dog and
[03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:21.520]  So he's letting the world know you let this lady run things you'll be starving to death
[03:09:21.880 --> 03:09:26.400]  Just like Trump said they want to crash the stock market to stop this recovery of the country
[03:09:26.400 --> 03:09:33.920]  This is the globalist literally coming after everybody so Mike Adams takes over after the break. I
[03:09:38.240 --> 03:09:42.960]  Just hope everybody understands you're the target of these globalist attacks and without you funding us we're done
[03:09:42.960 --> 03:09:45.960]  But here's vice from almost two years ago
[03:09:46.840 --> 03:09:49.520]  22 and a half months ago 23 months ago
[03:09:49.520 --> 03:09:54.680]  And I lay out everything that's coming and then Mike Adams takes over natural movies.com straight ahead
[03:10:07.400 --> 03:10:12.360]  Alex Jones is probably America's best known and most influential conspiracy theorist
[03:10:12.880 --> 03:10:16.920]  Jones's radio program and online television network reaches millions
[03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:22.400]  The frothing rants claiming the sandy hook massacre was a hoax and that 9-11 was an inside job
[03:10:22.400 --> 03:10:28.360]  You know what it's like to go up to this and go out every day and go past the peer pressure and come out day one and say
[03:10:28.360 --> 03:10:31.200]  9-11 was an inside job and lose most the radio stations
[03:10:31.200 --> 03:10:33.360]  I was on you know what it's like to go to sleep every night
[03:10:33.360 --> 03:10:37.640]  No, and you know what the election of Donald Trump. He's candidacy vigorously championed
[03:10:37.640 --> 03:10:47.720]  Jones's fringe movement has shouted its way into the mainstream and he's become one of the president elects most powerful media surrogates
[03:10:49.080 --> 03:10:51.080]  You're in a death battle now
[03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:57.000]  You're in a death battle new world order. We know you're in one with us
[03:10:58.120 --> 03:10:59.400]  Comprende
[03:10:59.400 --> 03:11:03.560]  Comprehend it. We don't care what you say throughout his 20-plus year career in broadcasting
[03:11:03.560 --> 03:11:11.080]  Alex Jones has transformed from a local celebrity with a public access cable show to the undisputed king of alternative media
[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:14.840]  His YouTube channel has racked up well over a billion views
[03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:19.640]  That's ten times as many as NBC news as YouTube channel six times
[03:11:19.640 --> 03:11:23.560]  It's unclear just how much money Jones makes as a conspiracy salesman
[03:11:23.560 --> 03:11:27.760]  But his sprawling state-of-the-art studio in Austin suggested business is good
[03:11:27.760 --> 03:11:35.200]  That's because while Jones's views might live on the political fringe. He's no longer a fringe player the whole takeover failed
[03:11:35.440 --> 03:11:36.720]  didn't it
[03:11:36.720 --> 03:11:42.880]  And now who gets to talk to the president who gets to talk the Supreme Court justices that drudge
[03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:48.200]  Alex Jones it might be an exaggeration, but not by much Donald. Thank you for joining us
[03:11:48.400 --> 03:11:54.680]  Thank you, Alex during the campaign Trump appeared on Jones's show pitching both his new book and his candidacy
[03:11:54.680 --> 03:11:59.240]  We'll also heaping praise on the host. I just want to finish by saying your reputation is amazing
[03:11:59.640 --> 03:12:02.600]  I will not let you down. You will be very very
[03:12:03.240 --> 03:12:09.880]  Impressed I hope and I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be and after he won in November Trump made an off-air call to Jones
[03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:14.200]  thanking him for his support as one of the president Alex advisors said
[03:12:14.680 --> 03:12:17.720]  Jones's listeners are the foot soldiers in the Trump revolution
[03:12:18.440 --> 03:12:20.920]  What do you think the connection is between?
[03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:25.680]  Your rise in media and Donald Trump's rising politics
[03:12:25.680 --> 03:12:27.680]  I was just an early
[03:12:28.240 --> 03:12:33.800]  Part of the wave of populism and wanting prosperity and wanting true liberalism. Why is it happening?
[03:12:33.800 --> 03:12:37.880]  Why is this your moment the mainstream media just ignored and ignored and ignored
[03:12:38.360 --> 03:12:43.920]  Laughing at flyover country. The truth is we'd already taken the nation back psychologically
[03:12:44.440 --> 03:12:46.960]  Many many years ago all we do study the enemy
[03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:52.800]  We know who they are where they vacation how they operate what their plans are what type of Satanism they carry out
[03:12:52.800 --> 03:12:58.200]  We know their operation. They're Satanism. They're all they're psychopaths. So their religion is basically satanic
[03:12:59.880 --> 03:13:06.720]  It's Jones's frequent outbursts of vain popping anger and willingness to indulge in hyperbole that made him famous
[03:13:06.720 --> 03:13:12.160]  But he insists that it isn't an Andy Kaufman like act. I'm a weapon. I'm made to be thrown at you
[03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:16.720]  There's not a lot of people that when I say I'm going to interview them
[03:13:16.720 --> 03:13:23.140]  They say yeah, I don't think he's serious. Is there an element of theater to it? I mean everything I say
[03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:27.560]  When I'm being serious and more and more I'm serious probably 95% of the time
[03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:31.160]  You're a pretty intense guy. You understand it like people are like wait. What's going on?
[03:13:31.160 --> 03:13:35.760]  I'm telling you why I turned it off. Yeah, even when I'm being satirical. I'm trying to point something out
[03:13:35.960 --> 03:13:41.160]  But I am letting the dog off the leash. I'm letting you know dr. Jekyll mr.
[03:13:41.160 --> 03:13:43.160]  Hyde. I'm letting mr. Hyde out
[03:13:43.760 --> 03:13:48.860]  Look at this, but clearing away all the hysterical bluster. What is it that Jones believes?
[03:13:49.360 --> 03:13:52.560]  You don't trust government. You think they're incompetent. You're that I love Trump
[03:13:52.560 --> 03:13:55.840]  But you but you love Trump and you also think the government can do all these things
[03:13:55.840 --> 03:14:01.560]  No, I see the globalist run government upset by Trump because they know what he's trying to do
[03:14:01.640 --> 03:14:08.440]  So I'm trying to give that a shot at reforming it. This is part of a global awakening to the new world order
[03:14:08.440 --> 03:14:12.040]  I'm such an authoritarian. You just don't sign that
[03:14:13.240 --> 03:14:18.840]  In addition to peddling paranoia Jones also pedals a huge range of products. I'll stop right there
[03:14:18.840 --> 03:14:24.000]  The report goes on and on but the last 30 seconds. I say listen Trump just wrote in on a wave of
[03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:29.680]  Populism we're riding in on that wave and that's all that's happening here and
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:35.920]  Humanity is awakening and that's what scares the globalist so much and so if you think Trump's been powerful
[03:14:35.920 --> 03:14:42.480]  You think that's scary more is coming and now look at the populism everywhere winning every election except
[03:14:43.120 --> 03:14:45.120]  Venezuela and this last one a month ago here
[03:14:46.400 --> 03:14:52.360]  And whether these politicians are perfect or not the people want nationalism they want capitalism they want freedom in fact
[03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:54.360]  I think we've got it queued up. Here's the end of the report
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:02.680]  Donald Trump, you know knew who I was knew what I was doing
[03:15:02.680 --> 03:15:06.040]  I talked to him something in there, but the whole place. It's not about me
[03:15:06.040 --> 03:15:09.680]  I'm just pointing out the movement that was already there that he basically
[03:15:10.320 --> 03:15:16.080]  Served in on but you're the loudest person talking about here's the most successful person talking bigger waves are coming
[03:15:16.440 --> 03:15:22.280]  We don't rise and fall with Trump now. You're gonna see the next wave. Good luck with that
[03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:29.480]  Now you're gonna see the next wave good luck with that
[03:15:29.480 --> 03:15:34.480]  So now you figure it out while Soros is fighting like any fell general the last war
[03:15:35.800 --> 03:15:39.960]  Trying to defeat info. I want to live on to fight new battles and new wars
[03:15:39.960 --> 03:15:42.920]  But as a movement info worth is already

[03:19:02.840 --> 03:19:07.960]  We've been proven dead on you've been proven dead on as supporters and listeners of this project
[03:19:07.960 --> 03:19:14.040]  You've been the men and women in the arena and I really do. Thank you and salute you all words are not enough
[03:19:14.560 --> 03:19:19.000]  Think about of all the different systems of all the different political ideologies
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:26.680]  You have been on target promoting Americana and Renaissance an open free society against the globalist and the dominant world force
[03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:30.520]  They've created a tower of Babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other
[03:19:30.880 --> 03:19:36.040]  But we have cut right to the chase human liberty a pro-human future versus the globalist
[03:19:36.040 --> 03:19:42.720]  Anti-human future. That's why I want to thank you all and ask you now more than ever to remember the info wars really is your baby
[03:19:42.720 --> 03:19:46.000]  I am in your hands and we're under unprecedented attack
[03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:52.240]  And we just need you to go to info wars for comm into your Christmas shop in there and get the best deals ever and funding info war
[03:19:52.240 --> 03:19:54.240]  A true 360 win
[03:19:54.240 --> 03:20:03.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:20:07.600 --> 03:20:13.800]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams
[03:20:17.640 --> 03:20:22.320]  All right, Mike Adams bringing it in here for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show today
[03:20:22.320 --> 03:20:24.320]  Thank you for joining me
[03:20:24.320 --> 03:20:26.920]  I'm going to continue the analysis of the
[03:20:27.360 --> 03:20:33.240]  escalation of what globalists are willing to do to defeat humanity and slave humanity and
[03:20:33.720 --> 03:20:38.440]  Try to destroy and defeat every last little bit of freedom and liberty
[03:20:38.560 --> 03:20:41.240]  but I believe they're going to fail long term and
[03:20:42.040 --> 03:20:46.320]  But Roger what Roger Stone said earlier a few minutes ago was exactly correct
[03:20:46.320 --> 03:20:51.800]  But the globalists are now in an all-out war that the deep state is that an all-out war with Trump
[03:20:51.800 --> 03:20:53.800]  There will be no more negotiating
[03:20:54.000 --> 03:21:01.960]  There will be no peaceful resolution either the deep state goes down or President Trump goes down and in the remainder of this hour
[03:21:01.960 --> 03:21:08.920]  The analysis that I'll bring you here, which I guess I'm becoming more and more known for this the sort of analysis is to show you
[03:21:09.200 --> 03:21:15.080]  What I think what extremes the globalists are willing to go to in order to win in their minds
[03:21:15.080 --> 03:21:22.400]  Which is destroying humanity destroying national sovereignty defeating the United States defeating President Trump and crushing liberty
[03:21:22.880 --> 03:21:28.760]  Forever and bringing in an authoritarian globalist state not just in America, but everywhere around the world
[03:21:28.760 --> 03:21:33.280]  That's their vision, but they're failing at every level because of the backlash
[03:21:33.480 --> 03:21:39.480]  So every time they try to clamp down on humanity. There's another uprising like we've been seeing in France
[03:21:39.560 --> 03:21:42.480]  There's another Brexit for the United Kingdom
[03:21:42.480 --> 03:21:49.680]  There's there's another backlash against the censorship of the tech giants and this is continuing to escalate so now
[03:21:49.880 --> 03:21:51.880]  let's get right into it because
[03:21:52.880 --> 03:21:54.880]  Something very important you need to understand
[03:21:55.520 --> 03:22:03.040]  Alex and I both warned about the potential of false flag operations before the 2016 election as well as the 2018 midterms
[03:22:03.880 --> 03:22:06.600]  The reason those false flags were not deployed
[03:22:06.600 --> 03:22:14.760]  I believe is because the globalist thought they would win in both cases. They were sure that Hillary Clinton was going to win the
[03:22:14.840 --> 03:22:20.360]  2016 election so they did not need to deploy, you know nuclear attacks on America or
[03:22:20.840 --> 03:22:26.160]  Something bigger than 9-11. They thought they had it in the bag. They had committed enough election fraud
[03:22:26.160 --> 03:22:31.600]  They had bribed the right people. They controlled the media. They had intimidated
[03:22:31.600 --> 03:22:36.240]  Anyone who opposed them except for Trump. They thought they had it won
[03:22:36.760 --> 03:22:41.280]  So they never needed to deploy the false flags similar thing with the 2018 midterms
[03:22:41.280 --> 03:22:45.640]  They thought for sure the blue wave was going to take over right remember that talk
[03:22:45.960 --> 03:22:50.400]  They thought they were gonna have the house and the Senate. They failed on the Senate
[03:22:50.400 --> 03:22:56.080]  They did take the house, but even that was only taken by massive voter fraud ballot harvesting
[03:22:57.480 --> 03:23:00.440]  Fraud in in Miami Dade County in Broward County
[03:23:00.440 --> 03:23:01.640]  a
[03:23:01.640 --> 03:23:07.040]  Massive fraud that's the only way they won that so once again, they did not deploy the false flag
[03:23:07.400 --> 03:23:11.640]  But now with the war between the deep state and Trump
[03:23:12.440 --> 03:23:14.840]  Escalating because Trump holds all the cards now
[03:23:14.840 --> 03:23:21.840]  He's got the classified information that he can release and he can destroy the deep state by releasing that information
[03:23:22.640 --> 03:23:28.000]  Because of that, they're willing to do anything to stop Trump from being reelected in 2020
[03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:35.720]  They are willing to do anything if Trump wins if the people win the globalists are willing to do anything
[03:23:36.400 --> 03:23:41.880]  Absolutely anything to destroy the United States of America take down Trump and crush the liberty movement
[03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:45.440]  That's rising all around the world and when I say anything
[03:23:46.160 --> 03:23:51.240]  Let's talk about what some of those possibilities could be because you need to be prepared for this number one
[03:23:51.240 --> 03:23:57.160]  We're witnessing it right now. They are willing to crash national economies and crash the markets
[03:23:57.160 --> 03:24:04.680]  Since Trump took office the Fed has been systematically raising interest rates the same Fed that kept them artificially low almost
[03:24:05.240 --> 03:24:11.680]  Zero for most of Obama's eight years. They kept them at zero to allow the stock market to ramp up
[03:24:12.400 --> 03:24:16.200]  Once Trump took office the Fed, which is a globalist organization
[03:24:16.200 --> 03:24:19.520]  Let's be honest. They decided to crash the market under Trump now
[03:24:19.520 --> 03:24:26.600]  It takes a while you can raise interest rates and it takes that there's a lag effect before the market corrections kick in
[03:24:26.600 --> 03:24:28.400]  But you're seeing it now
[03:24:28.400 --> 03:24:33.120]  It's inescapable. No one can argue that we're in a massive correction right now
[03:24:33.360 --> 03:24:37.160]  What you need to understand is that this is the weaponization of the Federal Reserve
[03:24:37.720 --> 03:24:43.920]  manipulation of the ease of money and debt in order to destroy a sitting president and even
[03:24:44.080 --> 03:24:51.720]  Punish an entire country that voted for this president. In other words, the globalist don't mind if they cause a mass
[03:24:51.720 --> 03:24:57.920]  Destruction of trillions of dollars of assets if they wipe out your savings if they wipe out your pension
[03:24:57.920 --> 03:25:03.680]  Which is happening by the way in Illinois and California and New Jersey and everywhere else. They don't mind
[03:25:04.240 --> 03:25:07.360]  As long as they can discredit this president and get him out of power
[03:25:07.520 --> 03:25:11.760]  They will destroy economies. They will destroy nations, but that's just the beginning
[03:25:12.280 --> 03:25:15.080]  This is just the first salvo in the war
[03:25:15.600 --> 03:25:20.800]  The next step is they can unleash. I wouldn't even call them false flags at this point
[03:25:20.800 --> 03:25:25.720]  They're just all out weapons of mass destruction assaults on America all out assaults
[03:25:26.840 --> 03:25:27.840]  dropping
[03:25:27.840 --> 03:25:35.160]  Let's say EMP weapons out of orbit and detonating them over North America an EMP weapon system
[03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:41.040]  You need to be prepared for it because an EMP system can be blamed on
[03:25:41.560 --> 03:25:47.560]  North Korea so the globalists can actually attack America. They can wipe out the infrastructure
[03:25:47.560 --> 03:25:54.720]  Computing the power grid emergency services the food supply logistics the nuclear power plant
[03:25:55.200 --> 03:26:01.800]  Cooling operations. They're all run on on circuit boards and these circuits are vulnerable to
[03:26:02.320 --> 03:26:04.320]  electromagnetic pulse weapon systems
[03:26:04.480 --> 03:26:11.880]  But they can blame it on North Korea and the media will carry the lie and so the globalists will never get blamed
[03:26:12.040 --> 03:26:16.280]  For this even though they're the ones doing it and by the way official government reports
[03:26:16.280 --> 03:26:21.560]  I've estimated that an EMP attack on the United States would result in
[03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:28.960]  Up to 90% of the population dying off. I believe within the first year. I'm remembering that report correctly
[03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:32.000]  And if you think about an EMP attack on America
[03:26:32.640 --> 03:26:38.840]  People will die from three basic things think about this and prepare accordingly. They'll die from the initial wave of violence
[03:26:39.200 --> 03:26:44.960]  They'll die from mass starvation and then throughout the year. They'll die from outbreaks of infectious disease
[03:26:44.960 --> 03:26:50.320]  In fact disease and starvation will kill more people than violence, but violence will be the first wave
[03:26:50.560 --> 03:26:56.560]  It's the chaos. It's the civil unrest. It's people dialing 9-1-1 and realizing there's nobody there
[03:26:56.760 --> 03:26:59.320]  It's cops going home to defend their families
[03:26:59.320 --> 03:27:04.840]  It's Los Angeles collapsing into a Mad Max zone of runaway gang warfare
[03:27:04.840 --> 03:27:10.440]  And any person who doesn't have an AR with at least a 30 round magazine won't be able to defend themselves
[03:27:10.440 --> 03:27:16.280]  Which is exactly what the globalists want. They don't want you to be able to defend yourself
[03:27:16.280 --> 03:27:20.660]  That's why they put they're putting in these ammo magazine restrictions in places like New Jersey and
[03:27:21.360 --> 03:27:26.480]  Trying to of course in Oregon and Colorado and elsewhere and of course, California is already a very
[03:27:27.640 --> 03:27:32.440]  It's practically illegal to own an AR there in certain configurations at this point
[03:27:33.160 --> 03:27:37.560]  So defending yourself against the chaos that may be coming is critical
[03:27:37.560 --> 03:27:42.760]  And remember I said starvation and disease as well. So if you are not right now
[03:27:43.800 --> 03:27:47.920]  Stocking up on storeable food if you're not stocking up on natural
[03:27:48.520 --> 03:27:51.080]  antibiotics or growing them yourself
[03:27:51.080 --> 03:27:56.720]  I actually have a website just called natural antibiotics news that tells you which natural plants function
[03:27:56.720 --> 03:27:59.360]  You know oregano garlic things like that. You can do some research there
[03:27:59.640 --> 03:28:05.120]  But you go to infowars store stock up on food stock up on iodine iodine is a natural
[03:28:05.120 --> 03:28:13.920]  remedy for many of these things go get yourself prepared because what's coming is just an extension of
[03:28:14.040 --> 03:28:21.640]  The desperation of the globalist they are willing to do absolutely anything including releasing bio weapons nuclear weapons
[03:28:22.400 --> 03:28:27.320]  You know nuclear terrorism that they could blame on terrorism, but it's actually a weapon deployment system
[03:28:28.080 --> 03:28:30.080]  including high altitude EMP
[03:28:30.080 --> 03:28:35.920]  Detonations if Trump exposes the deep state the globalists will
[03:28:36.920 --> 03:28:38.520]  nuke
[03:28:38.520 --> 03:28:46.120]  America in a variety of ways. That's how desperate they are so more analysis straight ahead stay with us here on the Alex Jones show

[03:30:00.440 --> 03:30:02.440]  So let's say a short and sweet

[03:30:22.600 --> 03:30:28.040]  And go through as much as we can to be an example to others and carry out critical operations

[03:32:00.720 --> 03:32:08.880]  You name it that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[03:32:08.880 --> 03:32:12.200]  I don't in the world. We've gone through two permutations
[03:32:12.560 --> 03:32:18.720]  First seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it
[03:32:18.800 --> 03:32:24.760]  So we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2. That's been incredible
[03:32:24.760 --> 03:32:32.320]  Now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine
[03:32:32.320 --> 03:32:33.920]  but
[03:32:33.920 --> 03:32:40.880]  Chemist scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C
[03:32:40.880 --> 03:32:44.120]  It supercharges it and makes it even more
[03:32:44.840 --> 03:32:49.920]  Bioavailable ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it. It's an incredible discovery
[03:32:49.920 --> 03:32:54.080]  X3 now available at m4slife.com
[03:32:56.840 --> 03:32:59.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:33:06.520 --> 03:33:15.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams
[03:33:15.040 --> 03:33:21.480]  All right, we're gonna play a thought experiment game together here
[03:33:21.480 --> 03:33:25.480]  Thank you for joining me Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones here in the fourth hour
[03:33:26.040 --> 03:33:31.280]  In this thought experiment you have three vaults in your home in vault number one
[03:33:31.280 --> 03:33:36.160]  It's stacked full of cash dollars hundred dollar bills. You've got I don't know
[03:33:36.400 --> 03:33:45.000]  Maybe a billion dollars in cash there almost as much as President Obama laundered and flew into Iran to fund Iran's nuclear weapons program
[03:33:45.000 --> 03:33:47.000]  That's how much cash you have in vault number one
[03:33:47.560 --> 03:33:50.840]  In vault number two you have cryptocurrency
[03:33:51.560 --> 03:33:58.600]  Wallets on thumb drives. All right, so a bunch of thumb drives sitting around there with billions of dollars in cryptocurrency in vault number three
[03:33:58.840 --> 03:34:06.200]  You have gold just bars of gold now. Here's what happens. There's a massive EMP attack. The grid goes down
[03:34:06.720 --> 03:34:09.800]  The economy collapses and your house burns down
[03:34:10.520 --> 03:34:13.480]  Which of these three vaults still has value in?
[03:34:13.480 --> 03:34:17.480]  In vault number one your dollars are worthless the economy
[03:34:17.680 --> 03:34:23.920]  Collapsed and those dollars may have burned up too because of course paper money is fiat currency paper burns
[03:34:24.400 --> 03:34:28.400]  Leaving behind well basically what it was worth in the first place zero
[03:34:28.920 --> 03:34:32.400]  In vault number two you've got all your cryptocurrency and your Bitcoin
[03:34:32.760 --> 03:34:38.760]  But the grid is down when the grid is down and cryptocurrency has zero value because obviously you can't mine it
[03:34:38.760 --> 03:34:43.280]  You can't exchange it. You can't use it and your thumb drives probably melted anyway in that fire
[03:34:43.920 --> 03:34:48.520]  Vault number three you open the door. What do you have my gosh? It's still gold
[03:34:48.520 --> 03:34:53.160]  It's perhaps melted gold because if you burn gold you just get melted gold
[03:34:53.480 --> 03:34:57.880]  Gold is an element. It's an element of the cosmos gold is created in stars
[03:34:57.880 --> 03:35:03.720]  Did you know that when when stars explode they create heavier elements gold's not you know as heavy as lead obviously
[03:35:03.720 --> 03:35:07.240]  But it's it's heavier than you know hydrogen, right?
[03:35:07.240 --> 03:35:11.880]  I mean, this is how elements are created gold and copper and silver. They're elements
[03:35:11.880 --> 03:35:16.800]  You can't destroy them you have you ever tried to destroy a piece of gold you can't you can burn it
[03:35:16.800 --> 03:35:18.960]  I mean, I guess you could dissolve it with acid
[03:35:18.960 --> 03:35:25.040]  But you'd still have gold atoms in solution in the acid, so you still have gold you can't destroy the gold
[03:35:25.760 --> 03:35:31.080]  The gold is valuable even after an economic collapse the gold is valuable after an EMP weapon
[03:35:31.080 --> 03:35:34.440]  The gold is valuable when the national money supply collapses
[03:35:34.440 --> 03:35:41.680]  The gold has inherent value and the reason I wanted to take you on this quick thought experiment is because I want you to think about
[03:35:42.720 --> 03:35:50.000]  Things that survive the most extreme conditions the most extreme outcomes if we end up in global war
[03:35:50.240 --> 03:35:55.880]  If we end up in an economic collapse if we end up being invaded by a foreign enemy
[03:35:56.440 --> 03:36:03.040]  After an EMP weapons softens up America and by the way, I think that's one of the scenarios that that I need to talk about here
[03:36:03.040 --> 03:36:05.040]  What will have value?
[03:36:05.880 --> 03:36:10.080]  The answer is things that are real that are physical things that will survive a
[03:36:10.840 --> 03:36:16.640]  Grid down scenario things that will survive economic collapse and things that you can protect and defend those include not just gold
[03:36:16.640 --> 03:36:21.080]  But of course silver those include ammunition if it's legal in your area
[03:36:21.080 --> 03:36:23.080]  Hopefully you live somewhere where you can have ammo
[03:36:23.840 --> 03:36:24.880]  firearms
[03:36:24.880 --> 03:36:25.840]  tractors
[03:36:25.840 --> 03:36:27.840]  diesel fuel farmland a
[03:36:27.840 --> 03:36:34.960]  Water well or an artesian well even better a river or stream or a pond a source of water a source of food good soil
[03:36:34.960 --> 03:36:37.360]  That you can use to grow food garden seeds
[03:36:38.240 --> 03:36:44.520]  Food that you can barter in terms of things that you can barter. Don't forget about salt salt
[03:36:45.200 --> 03:36:51.680]  It's it's it's it's a universal value item. I mean the Romans used to pay their soldiers in salt
[03:36:51.680 --> 03:36:57.240]  That's that's what the saying that's where it comes from to say whether you're worth, you know, he's worth his salt
[03:36:57.240 --> 03:37:02.920]  It means that you earn your daily salt wage in a survival scenario. You will need salt and
[03:37:03.760 --> 03:37:06.120]  Also, believe it or not, you need to look at lard
[03:37:07.080 --> 03:37:10.240]  Lard is cheap to buy. It's got a multitude of uses
[03:37:10.240 --> 03:37:15.160]  You can use lard to to light to make candles in liquid candles
[03:37:15.160 --> 03:37:19.280]  You can use lard to lubricate things lard is a source of calories
[03:37:19.280 --> 03:37:26.280]  You can mix it with legumes and beans and make a very very filling meal using your other stored food combined with lard
[03:37:26.800 --> 03:37:29.960]  I mean, I know it sounds maybe gross to a lot of people
[03:37:29.960 --> 03:37:32.400]  But you know lard has a lot of uses
[03:37:32.400 --> 03:37:39.760]  I just want you to really start thinking outside the box here about the things that you're prepping for because things are about to get crazy
[03:37:39.760 --> 03:37:48.560]  Beyond anything that you've ever seen in your entire life. Now just to interrupt here a couple of breaking news items to mention a
[03:37:49.320 --> 03:37:56.760]  Drone Corsi has filed a lawsuit against Robert Mueller claiming 350 million dollars in damages for Robert Mueller
[03:37:57.160 --> 03:37:59.160]  illegally leaking and
[03:37:59.200 --> 03:38:05.280]  Engaging in illegal surveillance. So that's that's good news. That's good to see drum Corsi fighting back against the
[03:38:05.280 --> 03:38:09.440]  Lawlessness and tyranny of Robert Mueller who is a rogue
[03:38:10.240 --> 03:38:14.760]  Clinton operation agent slash Obama operation agent
[03:38:15.160 --> 03:38:21.160]  So that's one important thing to remember and and Roger Stone is also holding his ground as well
[03:38:21.160 --> 03:38:26.680]  So remember Robert Mueller relies on being able to twist the arms of people
[03:38:27.080 --> 03:38:31.340]  To twist them into lying about President Trump and this is what the entire
[03:38:31.340 --> 03:38:36.500]  Russia collusion hoax is based on threatening people as a prosecutor and
[03:38:37.380 --> 03:38:43.760]  In essence altering their testimony and by the way Robert Mueller doing that is a felony crime by itself. You cannot
[03:38:44.780 --> 03:38:49.100]  Impede the testimony of witnesses. You can't tamper with the witnesses
[03:38:49.100 --> 03:38:55.700]  It's called witness tampering and that's exactly what Robert Mueller is doing and that's why Cohen is lying about Trump now
[03:38:55.700 --> 03:39:03.600]  But even then notice that as the globalists think that they've got Trump trapped. They have dropped the collusion narrative
[03:39:04.180 --> 03:39:10.300]  Where is the Russia collusion narrative? It's suddenly gone in its place is this claim that oh my god
[03:39:10.300 --> 03:39:13.980]  Trump paid this woman a hundred thousand dollars of his own money
[03:39:13.980 --> 03:39:20.900]  And that's a crime because that interfered with an election nonsense the Obama administration was a find I think
[03:39:21.780 --> 03:39:23.780]  $375,000 for
[03:39:23.780 --> 03:39:25.220]  a
[03:39:25.220 --> 03:39:31.060]  Something that was far worse not reporting campaign contributions as required by law
[03:39:31.060 --> 03:39:36.580]  I think a couple of million dollars in campaign contributions or maybe 1.8 million is what's coming to mind there
[03:39:36.940 --> 03:39:41.060]  But Obama is not being threatened with being arrested over that
[03:39:41.460 --> 03:39:45.140]  You know this the the southern district of New York is not going after Obama for that
[03:39:45.140 --> 03:39:51.460]  But of course are threatening to arrest Trump so the Russia collusion hoax has dissolved into the background
[03:39:51.460 --> 03:39:56.620]  And in its place now is this insane focus on this payment to a woman that
[03:39:57.460 --> 03:40:03.100]  Perhaps Trump slept with and wanted to pay off. Well, guess what that has nothing to do with the election
[03:40:03.100 --> 03:40:09.740]  That's his own personal family business stuff. And and if they try to impeach him over that is going to be a revolt
[03:40:09.740 --> 03:40:14.940]  I believe there will be a nationwide revolt against the Democrats if they try to impeach Trump over this
[03:40:14.940 --> 03:40:21.820]  It's it's nonsense and it's all based on the lies that Robert Mueller is squeezing out of witnesses by tampering with those witnesses
[03:40:21.820 --> 03:40:23.820]  and the entire Robert Mueller
[03:40:24.060 --> 03:40:29.700]  Investigation by the way is illegitimate lawless and unconstitutional to begin with and if you recall
[03:40:29.700 --> 03:40:33.900]  It was initiated by James Comey illegally leaking classified information
[03:40:34.340 --> 03:40:40.480]  Through a friend of his to the media in order to claim obstruction of justice and call for the appointment of his friend
[03:40:40.480 --> 03:40:48.180]  Robert Mueller who's also heavily involved in the history of the Clinton Foundation the uranium one cover-up and other crimes of
[03:40:48.940 --> 03:40:51.180]  Corruption and collusion involving the FBI
[03:40:51.940 --> 03:40:55.140]  So the deep state actually could go down
[03:40:55.940 --> 03:41:00.140]  Trump has the documents. He will I believe release them
[03:41:00.140 --> 03:41:04.260]  He will release them at a time that is the most advantageous
[03:41:04.260 --> 03:41:07.500]  It may be after the final Mueller report comes out
[03:41:07.500 --> 03:41:12.540]  You might be asking why doesn't Trump release the documents right now? I don't know. I don't know the mind of Trump
[03:41:12.540 --> 03:41:17.140]  I don't know what he's thinking and I don't know what's in those documents because obviously I don't have access to them
[03:41:17.500 --> 03:41:25.180]  Trump knows what's in them and he is a strategist and he has thwarted every effort so far of the deep state to try to take him out
[03:41:25.180 --> 03:41:30.780]  And I believe he will thwart their efforts yet again, but importantly this is crucial to understand
[03:41:31.540 --> 03:41:33.540]  Trump needs our support
[03:41:33.540 --> 03:41:37.380]  With whatever happens when Trump releases those documents
[03:41:37.740 --> 03:41:41.700]  It's going to be an all-out deep state war against America
[03:41:41.700 --> 03:41:48.340]  Trump's going to need your support my support all of us to stand up and say it's time to arrest the deep state traders
[03:41:48.380 --> 03:41:52.060]  It's time to charge those people with the treason those who have committed it
[03:41:52.100 --> 03:41:59.500]  It's time to charge Hillary Clinton Barack Obama for money laundering selling government influence engaging in corruption
[03:41:59.500 --> 03:42:04.220]  Obstructing justice the destruction of evidence in particular with Hillary Clinton's
[03:42:05.140 --> 03:42:09.180]  laptop and emails and an email server all these things this
[03:42:10.060 --> 03:42:12.500]  we need to support President Trump in
[03:42:13.420 --> 03:42:19.500]  Going after these deep state criminals because the number one thing that Trump needs to accomplish in his president presidency is
[03:42:19.980 --> 03:42:26.100]  The the exposing and the dismantling of the anti-america deep state and he can't do it alone
[03:42:26.100 --> 03:42:30.300]  He's going to need our help and he's gonna need info wars. He's gonna need Alex Jones
[03:42:30.300 --> 03:42:32.220]  He's gonna need your support all of us
[03:42:32.220 --> 03:42:39.740]  We need to continue to speak out stay strong defend our country and be willing to stand up and support these efforts to root out
[03:42:39.940 --> 03:42:47.220]  Evil and corruption in the American system. This is Mike Adams. I'll be back after these messages with more analysis straight ahead
[03:42:47.220 --> 03:42:55.260]  In the last few months info wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items
[03:42:55.260 --> 03:43:02.100]  And then I came up with the idea last week. Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide 50 to 75% off double-patriot points
[03:43:02.100 --> 03:43:07.820]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order
[03:43:07.820 --> 03:43:13.740]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride free colloidal silver iodine 4 to 5 super blue you'll get a free gift
[03:43:13.740 --> 03:43:19.020]  Of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt
[03:43:19.020 --> 03:43:20.420]  But these are gonna be selling out
[03:43:20.420 --> 03:43:25.780]  So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out
[03:43:25.780 --> 03:43:29.900]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders. So in the next 12 days
[03:43:29.900 --> 03:43:35.300]  We are going to have beyond any other sale. We've ever had so this is a loss leader
[03:43:35.300 --> 03:43:40.060]  We are losing money on this. This is our biggest sale ever get your free gift your free shipping store

[03:45:23.100 --> 03:45:26.980]  They've created a tower of babel with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other

[03:45:57.820 --> 03:46:04.700]  Leftist CIA operatives the corrupt justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate people say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:46:05.220 --> 03:46:11.020]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had no future. We didn't do this
[03:46:11.020 --> 03:46:13.020]  So we've already had incredible success
[03:46:13.500 --> 03:46:19.020]  But if you will simply put your hands on the table, you're going to have to put your hands on the table

[03:47:24.740 --> 03:47:31.180]  Here on the creator of the counter think episodes that air every Sunday at 6 p.m. On info wars calm

[03:47:42.100 --> 03:47:44.020]  former undercover
[03:47:44.020 --> 03:47:46.020]  narcotics officer who survived
[03:47:46.740 --> 03:47:49.860]  multiple shootings who is willing to go on camera
[03:47:50.780 --> 03:47:52.780]  concealing his identity and
[03:47:52.780 --> 03:47:55.460]  Revealing tactics of what?
[03:47:56.100 --> 03:48:03.780]  Criminals will use to defeat you in a collapse how they will gain entry into your home how they will steal your
[03:48:04.260 --> 03:48:09.020]  Supplies how they will car jack you if they can do that how they will stake out your home
[03:48:09.220 --> 03:48:17.140]  How they will shoot you and and pillage your home all of these tactics are things that you need to understand because the the average
[03:48:17.140 --> 03:48:24.300]  law-abiding citizen has no familiarity with the viciousness and the level of violence that is
[03:48:24.900 --> 03:48:29.460]  routinely invoked by people who are let's say criminal gangs or
[03:48:30.540 --> 03:48:37.020]  Former murderers and so on there's a there's a level of violence that is carried out by individuals
[03:48:37.180 --> 03:48:41.900]  Who do not abide by the law and that violence actually gives them a very strong tactical
[03:48:41.900 --> 03:48:48.860]  Advantage in fact, I'm reminded of a book and I think it's called when violence is the answer
[03:48:48.980 --> 03:48:53.100]  See if you can bring that book up guys when violence is the answer I forgot the name of the author
[03:48:53.100 --> 03:48:57.700]  But I think he was he went through partially went through buds training with the Navy Seals
[03:48:58.340 --> 03:49:01.740]  But he got his eardrum blown out and he wasn't able to complete that training
[03:49:01.740 --> 03:49:08.460]  He went on to become a a security a corporate security consultant and a police force security consultant
[03:49:08.460 --> 03:49:14.380]  He teaches law-abiding citizens how to use violence. Yeah, his name Tim Larkin. There we go
[03:49:14.380 --> 03:49:19.980]  That's his name Tim Larkin when violence is the answer that this is a very important book to check out
[03:49:20.500 --> 03:49:25.940]  I I recently listened to the audiobook just to learn what his what Tim Larkin's talking about
[03:49:26.340 --> 03:49:31.220]  he prepares law-abiding citizens to use the strategic application of
[03:49:31.940 --> 03:49:34.380]  extreme violence to stop violence and
[03:49:34.380 --> 03:49:40.220]  And again, the average person has no clue how violent bad people can be so
[03:49:40.820 --> 03:49:42.740]  Check out that book perhaps if you're interested
[03:49:42.740 --> 03:49:45.700]  But also check out the counter think episode coming up in a couple of weeks
[03:49:45.700 --> 03:49:51.500]  And also you can view those episodes after the fact at counter think calm or at my video website
[03:49:51.700 --> 03:49:56.780]  Brighton calm which also carries info wars videos now thousands of info wars videos there
[03:49:57.620 --> 03:49:59.220]  you
[03:49:59.220 --> 03:50:04.620]  You will be astonished by what this former undercover narcotics officer shares with you
[03:50:05.660 --> 03:50:09.740]  Now getting back to the EMP attack. I just wanted to mention this too as a follow-up
[03:50:10.380 --> 03:50:12.900]  If you if the lights go out one day
[03:50:12.900 --> 03:50:19.340]  I want you to really think about something very carefully if the lights go out you are no longer going to have access
[03:50:19.820 --> 03:50:21.060]  And when I say the lights go out
[03:50:21.060 --> 03:50:24.940]  I mean EMP weapon is detonated and the power grid goes down
[03:50:24.940 --> 03:50:31.220]  You're not going to have access to the internet. You cannot go online and look up solutions the preparedness solutions
[03:50:31.380 --> 03:50:35.980]  You know firearms assembly or disassembly you can't go to info wars calm
[03:50:35.980 --> 03:50:40.860]  You can't go anywhere so you are going to have to survive on whatever information that you already have in
[03:50:41.220 --> 03:50:45.420]  Books or printed out or the gear that you have there
[03:50:45.500 --> 03:50:53.100]  So think in advance about this you may want to download very useful information now or purchase physical books instead of Amazon
[03:50:53.100 --> 03:50:57.700]  Kindle electronic books so you can keep the physical books for reference in that situation
[03:50:58.740 --> 03:51:01.260]  The first threat to you is going to be of course
[03:51:02.580 --> 03:51:08.540]  Local criminals and this is why you got to see that counter think show when it when it comes out local criminals will be violent
[03:51:09.300 --> 03:51:14.740]  What they don't probably realize and what you may not realize is that this is just the first wave an
[03:51:15.420 --> 03:51:19.460]  EMP attack on America is a softening up of the nation for an international
[03:51:19.460 --> 03:51:27.460]  war against America America would not be hit with an EMP weapon if there wasn't an enemy invasion
[03:51:28.180 --> 03:51:30.580]  Being planned right behind it
[03:51:31.020 --> 03:51:35.560]  So if the lights go out and you have to deal with criminals in your local community
[03:51:35.580 --> 03:51:38.860]  You're trying to escape, you know Los Angeles, you know, good luck with that
[03:51:39.540 --> 03:51:46.860]  And you survive that guess what now you have to defend your nation because there's a foreign enemy invasion that's coming and
[03:51:46.860 --> 03:51:51.540]  Those invaders who knows they might they might do a beachhead landing in California
[03:51:52.260 --> 03:51:58.180]  Maybe the Communist Chinese get permission from the governor of California. Who knows I mean, they're all communists
[03:51:58.780 --> 03:52:01.280]  Maybe they land on the coast of California
[03:52:01.660 --> 03:52:08.260]  Maybe there are troops that come up through the border in with Mexico. Maybe Texas gets invaded. Maybe Arizona gets invaded
[03:52:08.860 --> 03:52:11.300]  It's hard to know exactly how this might unfold
[03:52:11.300 --> 03:52:17.300]  But don't think that just because the power grid goes down that all you have to do is survive the local situation
[03:52:17.340 --> 03:52:23.100]  No, you have to survive that and you have to defend your nation because it's way worse than what you think
[03:52:23.620 --> 03:52:25.380]  they're gonna be
[03:52:25.380 --> 03:52:31.060]  Armored personnel carriers rolling in just like Macron has unleashed against the citizens of France
[03:52:31.700 --> 03:52:34.020]  EU armored personnel carriers
[03:52:34.660 --> 03:52:37.300]  you can expect to see that in the United States and
[03:52:37.300 --> 03:52:42.380]  Dare I say don't wait for orders from headquarters if that situation unfolds
[03:52:42.620 --> 03:52:46.140]  You take it to the enemy every day in every way you can
[03:52:46.820 --> 03:52:52.140]  If your nation is occupied invaded under assault and they've taken out the power grid
[03:52:52.540 --> 03:52:55.140]  You don't need to wait for Trump to tell you what to do
[03:52:55.140 --> 03:52:59.380]  You don't need orders from your military commander. You take it to the enemy
[03:53:00.100 --> 03:53:06.260]  At every stage you're gonna be in a guerrilla war at that point and you take it to the enemy and you
[03:53:06.260 --> 03:53:11.500]  eliminate them and you take back your country and wait for some infrastructure to come back
[03:53:12.060 --> 03:53:14.700]  because you know it will eventually but
[03:53:15.260 --> 03:53:21.180]  America's lost if you don't if you don't defeat the enemy that's trying to invade America and boy
[03:53:21.180 --> 03:53:26.260]  They'll they'll be in for a big surprise. Won't they when they once they get past, California where guns are banned
[03:53:27.260 --> 03:53:31.580]  And they get into let's say, Nevada and Arizona. They're gonna find out
[03:53:31.580 --> 03:53:36.500]  there's a lot of a lot of firearms owners who actually can shoot a thousand yards and
[03:53:36.900 --> 03:53:41.420]  Take out, you know, enemy enemy invaders. So just just some things that keep in mind
[03:53:42.020 --> 03:53:44.020]  The EMP attack is just a softening up
[03:53:44.660 --> 03:53:50.380]  All right now also for surviving the the market crash that's happening right now
[03:53:51.140 --> 03:53:55.460]  Hopefully it won't continue. But you know, it's hard to say exactly what's going to happen
[03:53:55.460 --> 03:53:57.460]  The Fed has declared war on the system
[03:53:57.460 --> 03:54:01.300]  Right now, of course, you should check with your own financial advisor
[03:54:01.300 --> 03:54:05.220]  But I strongly encourage you to explore the importance of deleveraging your debt
[03:54:05.780 --> 03:54:07.540]  debt leverage will get you killed
[03:54:07.540 --> 03:54:13.700]  I mean financially speaking debt leverage means let's say you have you own mortgages on four homes and you're renting them out
[03:54:13.700 --> 03:54:18.860]  And you're kind of a landlord or something or you're a home investor when you owe money on all four homes or
[03:54:19.540 --> 03:54:24.100]  Maybe you've invested in stock market on margin those margin calls could kill you
[03:54:24.100 --> 03:54:29.060]  This is a time I believe to get out of risky investments and get into
[03:54:29.820 --> 03:54:37.860]  Cash or something close to cash even even T bills for that matter or gold would be even better things that are real assets
[03:54:37.860 --> 03:54:41.460]  And in fact, I've said this for many years. So this isn't new but
[03:54:41.940 --> 03:54:44.820]  Now the proof is there people are seeing it happen
[03:54:45.260 --> 03:54:51.820]  They're seeing their their stock market investments dwindle away and they don't understand why that's happening when the economy is supposed to be good
[03:54:51.820 --> 03:54:55.780]  The economy could be good and it can get even better
[03:54:55.940 --> 03:54:59.860]  But the Federal Reserve is at war with you. They're at war with the economy
[03:54:59.860 --> 03:55:03.860]  So they will continue to try to destroy wealth and if you keep
[03:55:04.580 --> 03:55:09.140]  Leveraging your debt into those kinds of investments, then you will get hammered by it
[03:55:09.260 --> 03:55:14.540]  So deleverage your debt get out of debt and you will be much better off as a result
[03:55:15.420 --> 03:55:18.220]  okay, one more thing gun confiscation is
[03:55:18.220 --> 03:55:25.740]  Is being ramped up because gun gun confiscation really puts America on the path to Venezuela gun confiscation is
[03:55:26.140 --> 03:55:31.020]  A step that the globalists have always been trying to pursue in order to disarm America before
[03:55:31.380 --> 03:55:37.100]  Such an attack like like the one I've been describing here if they can disarm America and have people, you know
[03:55:37.100 --> 03:55:43.260]  Turn in your rifles as who was that was that feinstein who said that many years ago turn in your rifles turn in your guns
[03:55:43.260 --> 03:55:49.220]  Mr. And Mrs. America, right? That's what she said if they can do that then they can launch an EMP or then they could launch an
[03:55:49.220 --> 03:55:57.180]  Economic collapse or they could just frankly just overrun communities with you know rogue federal agents who just arrest anybody
[03:55:57.180 --> 03:56:03.140]  They want anybody who's a a critic of the Clintons or a critic of the Obamas or a critic of the next Democrat president
[03:56:03.340 --> 03:56:06.700]  They want you disarmed so they can roll out a tyranny
[03:56:06.700 --> 03:56:15.580]  Disarmament puts America on the pathway to Venezuela. So if you don't want to starve to death one day and end up eating your dogs
[03:56:15.580 --> 03:56:24.580]  Instead of walking your dogs as that famous meme says then you need to resist gun confiscation and I dare say that
[03:56:25.300 --> 03:56:32.220]  any any so-called laws that attempt to restrict your right to keep and bear arms those laws are themselves
[03:56:32.220 --> 03:56:41.380]  Unconstitutional and illegal, but you're seeing this this ratcheting up of restrictions of gun magazines in places like New Jersey and
[03:56:41.900 --> 03:56:46.620]  California and Oregon and elsewhere and and further restrictions on firearms themselves
[03:56:46.940 --> 03:56:53.300]  This is an effort to make you disarmed so the country can be overrun. It's not about public safety
[03:56:53.460 --> 03:56:59.780]  It's about conquering America and making sure there's no one left to defend it. So for that reason alone, I say
[03:56:59.780 --> 03:57:01.780]  support the Second Amendment
[03:57:03.140 --> 03:57:05.140]  Where it's legal acquire
[03:57:06.460 --> 03:57:08.460]  Fully functioning firearms
[03:57:08.740 --> 03:57:12.420]  Keep them legal as I said make sure you have them sided in make sure they're running
[03:57:12.420 --> 03:57:18.740]  Well get ammo for them always keep it legal but be prepared because the goal for the globalist is to absolutely
[03:57:19.220 --> 03:57:24.100]  Overrun and destroy America and they have to disarm you first to accomplish that
[03:57:24.100 --> 03:57:30.260]  So I'll be joining you again probably in a few days or for sure Sunday on the counter think show
[03:57:30.460 --> 03:57:36.380]  Thanks for joining us today. Mike Adams here filling in for Alice Jones the fourth hour of the Alice Jones show. Be safe everybody

[03:58:57.180 --> 03:59:01.860]  They want to confuse children. They want their essence. They want their soul. They want their spirit
[03:59:01.860 --> 03:59:05.020]  They want their power because they are our future
[03:59:05.660 --> 03:59:09.660]  And this Christmas remember it is about Jesus Christ not ultimate sacrifice

[03:59:23.420 --> 03:59:26.060]  To pray for info wars and to remember
[03:59:26.580 --> 03:59:33.100]  That you have the power to change the world you have the power to override the sensors you have the power to stop the
[03:59:33.100 --> 03:59:37.660]  Globalist dead in their tracks. I know you've been taken action. I salute you, but just remember
[03:59:37.660 --> 03:59:43.420]  I know you're humble, but just remember you hold the future of this planet in the universe in your hands
