[00:00.000 --> 00:17.060]  On today's live Friday edition, myself, David Knight and others will be breaking down and
[00:17.060 --> 00:25.440]  laying out obviously the ongoing mental meltdown of the Democratic Party and the arrogant deceptive
[00:25.440 --> 00:32.720]  corporate media. But in the next segment, I'm going to break down, Roger Stone, the amazing
[00:32.720 --> 00:39.280]  accomplishments of Donald Trump, namely basically defeating ISIS. They admit it's in too small
[00:39.280 --> 00:44.800]  pockets now and has been destroyed, something Obama and Hillary created. That said, I understand
[00:44.800 --> 00:51.480]  people that are critical of the tax cuts not being delivered and Obamacare not being repealed.
[00:51.480 --> 00:55.840]  When we see Republican leaders, people we can trust, like Rand Paul saying, the Senate
[00:55.840 --> 00:58.920]  Republicans don't want to get rid of it. They want it. Well, of course, the Republican
[00:58.920 --> 01:03.320]  establishment with the Democrats wrote Obamacare. That's what's so frustrating about Democrats
[01:03.320 --> 01:09.040]  is they think it's like some goody they're getting and some free thing when Gruber and
[01:09.040 --> 01:13.760]  others are calling you dumb idiots with goldfish memories. I mean, that's what's crazy. I know
[01:13.760 --> 01:19.440]  the Republicans are bad, the leadership. I know the Democratic leadership is bad as well.
[01:19.440 --> 01:24.520]  I understand we're up against the entire establishment. Now, some people sit there and think because
[01:24.520 --> 01:28.840]  I'm so supportive of Trump that I somehow support that establishment. Trump is clearly
[01:28.840 --> 01:33.160]  against that establishment. He's trying to make deals with them and they're blocking
[01:33.160 --> 01:38.080]  him. He has to continue to rally the people and go after the Republican leadership as
[01:38.080 --> 01:44.320]  much as he goes after the Democrats because they are his enemy. And whereas the Democrats
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.200]  are more and more delusional and incompetent led by the big winner Pelosi, who thinks she's
[01:49.200 --> 01:55.920]  invincible, the Republicans are a much shrewder group of crooks at the top. Now, I hope that
[01:55.920 --> 01:59.240]  Pence, the vice president, can be trusted. I like him overall, but he's kind of a man
[01:59.240 --> 02:03.840]  between two worlds, between establishment Republicans, evangelicals, and then of course
[02:03.840 --> 02:09.200]  the whole Trump populist movement. And I understand why Drudge and others have been critical of
[02:09.200 --> 02:14.840]  Trump trying to push him to be true on his agenda. But I think the larger issue, as
[02:14.840 --> 02:19.320]  M4's pointed out, and so is Drudge and others, is the Republican establishment. So I just
[02:19.320 --> 02:24.320]  want to keep that elephant in the room in the spotlight as much as possible. But I also
[02:24.320 --> 02:29.520]  want people to pull back and realize we just got a good Supreme Court nominee and we're
[02:29.520 --> 02:32.360]  getting a lot of good things happening. I'll mention coming up in the next segment, the
[02:32.360 --> 02:37.760]  whole Chronicle in studio with Roger Stone. But this is a really, really big time to be
[02:37.760 --> 02:42.560]  alive. And I just want people to realize it's not a lesser two evils. I want to push the
[02:42.560 --> 02:45.680]  Republicans. I want to, I want to remove the establishment Republicans. I want to take
[02:45.680 --> 02:51.360]  the whole country back. I want to make the Democrats a, you know, basically land of
[02:51.360 --> 02:56.400]  fruits and nuts group only that can then be rehabilitated. They're already a coastal
[02:56.400 --> 03:00.240]  minority party. When I say minority, I mean liberal socialist communist views that we
[03:00.240 --> 03:06.560]  know are total failures. But at the same time, if we sit there and put our main focus on
[03:06.560 --> 03:11.920]  Trump and where he stumbles, that gives them aid and comfort. And if they take back over,
[03:11.920 --> 03:17.720]  they intend to pull up the free press. They intend to federalize the elections like Venezuela
[03:17.720 --> 03:22.400]  and bring us into an authoritarian system because they know we've rejected them. So
[03:22.400 --> 03:27.280]  we're facing true authoritarianism and we're facing people that want to openly overthrow
[03:27.280 --> 03:33.080]  Trump. And a lot of folks are hedging their bets thinking that, you know, let's be somewhat
[03:33.080 --> 03:36.320]  critical of Trump because they might bring him down and we don't want to be associated
[03:36.320 --> 03:41.520]  with a loser. That's how we're going to lose. We have to be all in defending each other,
[03:41.520 --> 03:45.240]  defending the free press, defending other libertarian and conservative and nationalistic
[03:45.240 --> 03:49.080]  talk show hosts. Even though we don't all agree with each other 100%, we're not out
[03:49.080 --> 03:53.640]  to get the country. We want prosperity. We're pro freedom. We're pro gun. We're pro free
[03:53.640 --> 03:58.440]  market. We're pro low taxes. Look, Obama didn't get Obamacare for two years. If Trump gets
[03:58.440 --> 04:01.440]  rid of it in his first three or four, I'll be happy. We need to get rid of it quicker
[04:01.440 --> 04:04.600]  because it's about to bankrupt the economy. And of course, that's the other big issue.
[04:04.600 --> 04:08.000]  Trump's trying to get the economy going. It's had some big success, but the Fed set
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.480]  to raise rates, try to put a damper on that. It's clear the whole global establishment
[04:12.480 --> 04:16.920]  is against Trump. And a lot of people in the Democratic party, the Republican party and
[04:16.920 --> 04:21.120]  also foreign governments and corporations think that there's strength in numbers, not
[04:21.120 --> 04:25.720]  when globalism's tide is going out and not when humanity is awake. It's our actions
[04:25.720 --> 04:29.840]  and our political speech and our financial actions that really do determine things. This
[04:29.840 --> 04:35.560]  is a people power issue. All right, back to the live transmission coming up after the
[04:35.560 --> 04:39.200]  break. We're going to lay out Trump's amazing accomplishments because it's something the
[04:39.200 --> 04:42.960]  globalists don't want to recognize. It's something the left doesn't want to hear. So we're going
[04:42.960 --> 04:47.120]  to celebrate our strengths, but also expose our weaknesses so we can improve them and
[04:47.120 --> 04:53.520]  fix them and move on. I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com. It's a revolutionary act to spread that link.
[04:53.520 --> 05:00.840]  So please continue, my friends. We're on the march and the empire is on the run.
[05:00.840 --> 05:07.000]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com with some patriotic quotes by Ron Paul. The most basic
[05:07.000 --> 05:12.520]  principle to being a free American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible
[05:12.520 --> 05:17.640]  for our own lives and decisions. We do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make
[05:17.640 --> 05:22.240]  up for our own mistakes. Neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to
[05:22.240 --> 05:28.280]  live so long as we aren't infringing on their rights. Freedom to make bad decisions is inherent
[05:28.280 --> 05:32.600]  in the freedom to make good ones. If we are only free to make good decisions, then we
[05:32.600 --> 05:38.200]  are not really free. Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset when
[05:38.200 --> 05:44.880]  we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints, random searches, mandatory identification cards,
[05:44.880 --> 05:51.160]  and paramilitary police in our streets. We have lost a vital part of our American heritage.
[05:51.160 --> 05:56.800]  America was born of protests, revolution and mistrust of government. Subservient societies
[05:56.800 --> 06:01.160]  neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[06:01.160 --> 06:05.520]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[06:05.520 --> 06:10.240]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[06:10.240 --> 06:15.960]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic, Metal and Chemical Defense
[06:15.960 --> 06:21.840]  Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[06:21.840 --> 06:25.960]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war. It is a classical
[06:25.960 --> 06:31.040]  360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we
[06:31.040 --> 06:36.280]  believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[06:36.280 --> 06:40.080]  get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future
[06:40.080 --> 06:45.160]  of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[06:45.160 --> 06:50.680]  as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
[06:50.680 --> 06:54.520]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and
[06:54.520 --> 06:58.320]  your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies
[06:58.320 --> 07:03.440]  with Z Shield at infowarslife.com. Please listen carefully because I'm about to point
[07:03.440 --> 07:07.800]  out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products

[08:14.520 --> 08:18.840]  You're going to be so proud of your country if I get in. You're going to be so proud of
[08:18.840 --> 08:24.440]  your president and I don't care about that. But you are going to be so proud of your country.
[08:24.440 --> 08:30.080]  In terms of presidential, I think they thought the same thing. Maybe there was overconfidence
[08:30.080 --> 08:33.800]  that who would vote for him. We're going to turn it around and we're going
[08:33.800 --> 08:39.080]  to start winning again. We're going to win so much. We're going to win at every level.
[08:39.080 --> 08:42.880]  We're going to win economically. We're going to win with the economy. We're going to win
[08:42.880 --> 08:46.760]  with military. We're going to win with health care and for our veterans.
[08:46.760 --> 08:51.040]  But the fact is, it doesn't matter who would vote for him. You have to be very positive
[08:51.040 --> 08:56.080]  about your own agenda. And that's what we're about right now as we go forward with our
[08:56.080 --> 08:58.200]  hopefully successful attempt to win the Congress.
[08:58.200 --> 09:03.360]  We're going to win with every single facet. We're going to win so much. You may even get
[09:03.360 --> 09:04.360]  tired of winning.
[09:04.360 --> 09:10.040]  Thankfully, we did no five and no six. Republican president in the White House, Republican president
[09:10.040 --> 09:15.400]  in the White House. We're the voices. The Senate leader and I are the voices for winning
[09:15.400 --> 09:18.200]  those races in our House and the Senate.
[09:18.200 --> 09:25.400]  And you'll say, please, please, it's too much winning. We can't take it anymore. Mr. President,
[09:25.400 --> 09:31.360]  it's too much. And I'll say, no, it isn't. We have to keep winning. We have to win more.
[09:31.360 --> 09:37.760]  In fact, affecting California very directly is the Affordable Care Act. President Bush
[09:37.760 --> 09:43.360]  has come out against that, as you know.
[09:43.360 --> 09:49.840]  We're going to keep winning because we're gonna make America great again. I love you.
[09:49.840 --> 09:56.200]  And we're ready.
[09:56.200 --> 10:02.520]  It's Friday, the 14th of July, 2017. We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[10:02.520 --> 10:06.880]  And David Knight is going to be in studio with Owen Shroyer and Leigh Ann McAdoo joining
[10:06.880 --> 10:12.880]  us via Skype and so much more. But I had to come in here at the very start of the transmission
[10:12.880 --> 10:18.880]  with Roger Stone. He's here while we're engineering the launch of more broadcasts, more TV shows.
[10:18.880 --> 10:23.920]  So we've kind of got a staycation going on today as we prepare the next level of the
[10:23.920 --> 10:24.920]  Info War.
[10:24.920 --> 10:30.880]  But we had to come in because we've gotten a little bit lackadaisical, myself included.
[10:30.880 --> 10:36.200]  We've gotten a little bit instant gratification. We've gotten to the point where I think we
[10:36.200 --> 10:42.160]  just expect Trump to always be able to deliver. They've had British members of parliament come
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.120]  out who don't even agree with a lot of his policies but say he's an honorable man who
[10:46.120 --> 10:51.960]  will go down in history as incredibly reviled by so many people because he actually did
[10:51.960 --> 10:54.840]  what he said he would do.
[10:54.840 --> 11:00.640]  So I'm not in some worship Trump fest here, okay? But compared to Hillary Clinton and
[11:00.640 --> 11:05.960]  getting good Supreme Court nominees and then getting the Supreme Court nominees seated
[11:05.960 --> 11:11.400]  and seeing the globalists in a total tailspin and witnessing the pull out of the TPP and
[11:11.400 --> 11:15.560]  witnessing the pull out of the carbon tax and it just goes on and on.
[11:15.560 --> 11:20.080]  60 plus percent down the level of illegals coming across the border. It was 40 something
[11:20.080 --> 11:25.280]  just a month into his administration. This is real action, ladies and gentlemen. That's
[11:25.280 --> 11:26.880]  why the elites hating.
[11:26.880 --> 11:33.480]  But then I was thinking today, the big one, I was driving in this morning listening to
[11:33.480 --> 11:40.240]  NPR and they were having to admit that ISIS is basically gone. It's only in one city in
[11:40.240 --> 11:46.960]  Syria and one city in Iraq and has basically been pushed into a few enclaves, a few neighborhoods.
[11:46.960 --> 11:51.680]  This is so massive. Trump said, we will knock out ISIS in the first six months and they've
[11:51.680 --> 11:59.480]  basically done it. Our military's done it. And remember, it was Obama. It was Obama.
[11:59.480 --> 12:04.640]  With Hillary and with the Arab Spring and with the CIA and with NATO and with France
[12:04.640 --> 12:09.800]  that openly pushed the Arab Spring and turned all those countries over from Libya to part
[12:09.800 --> 12:15.920]  of Syria to Egypt to Sunni-backed rebels out of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other areas. This
[12:15.920 --> 12:21.760]  is incredible. Our government did this and there's Trump saying, Obama did it, but now
[12:21.760 --> 12:25.720]  it's my problem. I take responsibility. We're dealing with it. Total leadership. And then
[12:25.720 --> 12:26.720]  it hit me.
[12:26.720 --> 12:32.000]  And I said, Roger, we got to get in here and get on air and talk about this because this
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.360]  is the big enchilada. It's the same thing with North Korea. It was the Clintons on record
[12:36.360 --> 12:40.600]  that gave them the reactors, the missile secrets, even the New York Times admits that. They're
[12:40.600 --> 12:46.240]  the ones that caused the current weaponization with Kim Jong-il and his son, Kim Jong-un,
[12:46.240 --> 12:50.440]  and Trump's cleaning that up again and getting the Russians to do something and getting the
[12:50.440 --> 12:54.560]  Chinese to do something because he's straight shooting him. He's not a globalist playing
[12:54.560 --> 12:59.240]  countries off against each other and they respect that. What he's done with ISIS and
[12:59.240 --> 13:04.440]  our military has done is incredible, but there aren't victory parades. He never told people
[13:04.440 --> 13:11.200]  he was even going in. He doesn't tell them when he's coming. It's so refreshing and real.
[13:11.200 --> 13:16.600]  It just boggles the mind that he's killing globalism and the strategic tension where
[13:16.600 --> 13:21.840]  they try to create the crises and create the boogeyman. It's amazing. And he wants reciprocal
[13:21.840 --> 13:25.880]  business deals that are good for both sides. Roger, I just wanted to come in here and talk
[13:25.880 --> 13:31.440]  about that, that Trump and our military had pretty much defeated the rebirth of al-Qaeda
[13:31.440 --> 13:36.520]  20 times bigger known as ISIS. Instead of elements of our CIA and others working with
[13:36.520 --> 13:40.600]  radical Islam, he's saying, no, we're not selling out Europe and the U.S. to this. No,
[13:40.600 --> 13:44.440]  we're not bringing in millions of military H-men, 10 millions enough already in Europe,
[13:44.440 --> 13:51.320]  U.N. members. I mean, it's amazing how good he is. I just have to tell the truth. I know
[13:51.320 --> 13:55.160]  it's popular to be anti-establishment, but the establishment's against Trump. People
[13:55.160 --> 14:00.080]  can say, Alex, you should be anti-establishment. Now, you're for it. He's our beachhead. We're
[14:00.080 --> 14:04.840]  in the fight of our lives. This is history happening. Roger, we're teleprompter-free.
[14:04.840 --> 14:07.320]  We need to script this breakdown. Am I accurate?
[14:07.320 --> 14:11.400]  I think you're right on the money. What bothers me, Alex, is, or I should say annoys me, is
[14:11.400 --> 14:15.920]  the president's not getting the credit he deserves. Two weeks ago, I had the occasion
[14:15.920 --> 14:23.760]  to talk to the president of Somalia. There, the Trump-led attack on the ISIS insurgency,
[14:23.760 --> 14:30.360]  the local insurgency, called El Shabaab, has the radicals on the run. The president doesn't
[14:30.360 --> 14:35.520]  blow his own horn, but whether it is foreign policy accomplishments or the fact that the
[14:35.520 --> 14:41.760]  national debt is down by $100 billion. Incredible. No, it's only been going up and up and up
[14:41.760 --> 14:44.840]  and up forever. In the same time period. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's even
[14:44.840 --> 14:48.880]  bigger. And I remember seeing that and no one's even talking about it. But in the same
[14:48.880 --> 14:54.880]  time period, the national deficit was up $600 billion under Barack Obama. This reminds
[14:54.880 --> 15:02.160]  me very much of Ronald Reagan, the S&P, hitting record levels. He gets no credit for that.
[15:02.160 --> 15:08.240]  So he's turning around the national economy. He's got ISIS truly on the run, and he's
[15:08.240 --> 15:11.800]  not getting the credit for it. I mean, he's got him KOed. I mean, now they've gone from
[15:11.800 --> 15:18.440]  saying they're invincible to now whining and complaining and playing victim. It's true.
[15:18.440 --> 15:25.520]  You've got a different breed of cat in Donald Trump. He's not about bragging about his accomplishments.
[15:25.520 --> 15:30.640]  He's about turning around the situation. And he's not getting from the mainstream media
[15:30.640 --> 15:32.920]  the kind of credit that I think he deserves.
[15:32.920 --> 15:37.040]  Roger, you're absolutely right. Let's see if Harrison's in the control room. He's one
[15:37.040 --> 15:40.640]  of our great researchers and video editors, one of our new hires last six months to the
[15:40.640 --> 15:43.920]  fabulous job. This morning, I was talking about this in the hall and he heard me and
[15:43.920 --> 15:50.920]  said, that's what I'm working on is the first six months of Trump and his accomplishments.
[15:50.920 --> 15:55.480]  And again, you've got to give people credit when they do it. This is why the power structure
[15:55.480 --> 15:58.920]  is so scary. Harrison, what's your two cents to all this?
[15:58.920 --> 16:04.040]  Well, I just thought the six month line would be a good one because typically you do the
[16:04.040 --> 16:08.120]  100 days. But if you look back at Trump's 100 days, a lot of good stuff had happened,
[16:08.120 --> 16:12.440]  but there was still a lot of stuff was sort of unfinished. And now just in the last couple
[16:12.440 --> 16:17.080]  of weeks, so much stuff has happened. I mean, defeating Isis and getting the wall funded
[16:17.080 --> 16:22.880]  and all these different things. Oh, that happened today. Oh, I mean, if I get the wall or yesterday,
[16:22.880 --> 16:27.640]  you can't keep track of it. You can't keep track. I started listing it out. And I mean,
[16:27.640 --> 16:31.400]  by the end, I had like 75 things that I was like, I mean, this video is going to be long.
[16:31.400 --> 16:34.880]  It's going to be huge. And I, you know, it's just going to be like, you know, I can't stump
[16:34.880 --> 16:38.320]  the Trump style thing. It's just going to be a celebration. Just saying, can we just
[16:38.320 --> 16:42.320]  take a moment and look back and see all the victories we've had over the last six months?
[16:42.320 --> 16:46.040]  It's, uh, it's really incredible. Exactly. I mean, he hasn't gotten rid of a lot of the
[16:46.040 --> 16:49.520]  deep state people because they're all rebelling against him, but it doesn't matter with the
[16:49.520 --> 16:53.920]  power of the presidency, 3 trillion the stock market, hundreds of billions of new jobs.
[16:53.920 --> 17:00.040]  He just makes the head spin. The second amendment off the ropes, uh, the travel ban of seven
[17:00.040 --> 17:07.680]  failed states. The S&P 500 hits 20 trillion for the first time, 298,000 new jobs since
[17:07.680 --> 17:13.480]  Donald Trump became president. The manufacturing index at an all time high. These are real
[17:13.480 --> 17:14.480]  accomplishments.
[17:14.480 --> 17:18.520]  Yeah. And I'm sure, I mean, I like dent and others that said this couldn't happen, but
[17:18.520 --> 17:19.840]  I'm telling you, Trump did it.
[17:19.840 --> 17:25.160]  Well, and once he started talking about our NATO allies not paying their fair share, guess
[17:25.160 --> 17:32.200]  what? They coughed up $10 billion when we had been carrying their load. Again, do only
[17:32.200 --> 17:34.320]  to the leadership of Donald J. Trump.
[17:34.320 --> 17:37.860]  You're absolutely right. I saw a Corsi in the control room. Can we get him over there?
[17:37.860 --> 17:41.600]  I want to just say this is unscripted. I just saw him in the control room there for the
[17:41.600 --> 17:44.640]  camera. Dr. Throne a few of your points on this.
[17:44.640 --> 17:49.800]  Well, I've said from the beginning that Donald Trump is going to win and he is I think gaining
[17:49.800 --> 17:55.320]  greater experience with how Washington works. And well, very shortly I think be able to
[17:55.320 --> 17:59.680]  turn the situation around even in the White House. Some basic changes have got to occur.
[17:59.680 --> 18:05.160]  Curry's gonna fire a previous in my opinion. It's got to get the people in the White House out who are not
[18:05.480 --> 18:11.440]  Trump loyalists and it's not it's not New York City and in Washington the first premises
[18:11.440 --> 18:17.320]  Everybody's gonna lie to you and people are gonna tell you they're your friends when they're your enemies and Trump has got to be
[18:17.320 --> 18:18.320]  able to sort this out
[18:18.320 --> 18:22.640]  I think you will and it's not people that want to be in business with you for 50 years and who want you know
[18:22.640 --> 18:29.360]  They can count on you. It's a bunch of screw jobs mentally ill scum and parasites and he's got to understand that
[18:29.360 --> 18:33.480]  But but what's his greatest accomplishment? I think it's breaking political correctness as well
[18:33.920 --> 18:38.920]  Letting us know that globalism is poison and letting us know it's good to be proud to be Americans again
[18:38.920 --> 18:41.600]  He's breaking the spirit of the parasites doc
[18:41.600 --> 18:45.200]  Well, I think he's done a huge job in in exposing fake news
[18:45.440 --> 18:49.840]  Think American people are really now attuned to what info wars is all about
[18:50.320 --> 18:56.000]  Which is that there's lying going on constantly by a government-controlled media. That's right

[19:05.520 --> 19:11.320]  I mean this is the icing on the cake is how delusional and out of control. They are so it's amazing

[24:16.960 --> 24:31.280]  Welcome to the alex joneshow. I'm david knight on this friday july 14th 2017. We've got a lot of news coming up
[24:31.760 --> 24:39.520]  Tell you what it's a bipartisan swamp in this video with bill clinton and george w. I just remind you
[24:41.120 --> 24:46.160]  How there is no difference as many said there's not a dime's worth of difference between the republican and democrat party
[24:46.160 --> 24:53.840]  Establishment and we're seeing that now with obama care as well. And I think this pathetic video that we see we've got an article up at info wars.com
[24:54.720 --> 25:01.120]  Talking about how bill clinton is not looking to help they hear he's chewing his tongue his hand is quivering during the appearance
[25:01.600 --> 25:06.720]  But when I look at this we'll show you this video when I look at this and when I listen to these guys
[25:07.200 --> 25:13.920]  What I see is the decrepit state of a dying establishment desperate to unify
[25:13.920 --> 25:20.960]  Against trump and against the american people who elected him. They are desperate to do anything that they can
[25:21.280 --> 25:23.280]  It's absolutely amazing. Let's play that clip
[25:23.760 --> 25:26.160]  And listen to what they have to say and those of you watching it
[25:26.240 --> 25:31.520]  You can see bill clinton as his hand is shaking his lips are quivering and you can hear it in his voice
[25:31.600 --> 25:34.880]  That's that's something his voice has been with him for a long time. But let's take a look at that clip
[25:35.840 --> 25:40.160]  If you want to be president realize it's about the people not about you
[25:40.160 --> 25:42.640]  And when it's over
[25:43.840 --> 25:47.520]  And that's what a lot of these people who are real arrogant in the office. They forget
[25:48.160 --> 25:49.760]  passes
[25:49.760 --> 25:52.400]  And it passes more quicker than you more quickly than you know
[25:53.360 --> 25:55.360]  Yeah, you want to be able to say
[25:57.600 --> 26:01.840]  People are better off when I quit kids had a better future things were coming together you don't
[26:02.480 --> 26:05.520]  You you don't want to say god. Look at all the people I beat
[26:05.520 --> 26:10.960]  Are the people I worked over. I think the most important thing is to be humble to listen
[26:11.440 --> 26:13.440]  To realize everybody's got a story
[26:13.680 --> 26:17.520]  All things I learned as a kid listen the only thing you disagreed with in my platform was that
[26:17.840 --> 26:19.840]  Texas ought to take arkansas
[26:21.120 --> 26:27.040]  What I what I disagreed with is he wanted to get all of our water not pay very much money for it
[26:27.520 --> 26:32.320]  Yeah, the brother from another mother as they called each other because that's the way they are
[26:32.320 --> 26:35.120]  That this is like they see each other like
[26:35.920 --> 26:38.240]  The royalty of england and the royalty of
[26:39.040 --> 26:43.040]  Russia and germany that sort of thing they see themselves as an recollected part of the elite establishment
[26:43.040 --> 26:48.240]  You see this picture of bill clinton not looking too good. As a matter of fact, I think he's looking worse than
[26:48.720 --> 26:51.040]  jimmy carter who just passed out doing some
[26:51.760 --> 26:57.200]  Home improvements as part of his charitable work in canada. It wasn't all that heavy
[26:57.200 --> 27:05.200]  But i mean jimmy carter is 92 years old. They're still working at habitat humanity doing things and that's a real difference
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.880]  From what we see with barack obama in the past
[27:09.440 --> 27:12.480]  We have seen presidents like jim do things like jimmy carter
[27:12.480 --> 27:13.600]  They would write their memoirs
[27:13.600 --> 27:17.440]  They would basically get out of politics when their time in washington was over
[27:17.440 --> 27:24.480]  We didn't see that with barack obama and we're not seeing that now with bill clinton and with george w. They're coming out and directly
[27:24.480 --> 27:27.280]  Criticizing donald trump. Why?
[27:27.280 --> 27:33.440]  Because donald trump is going in a different direction quite obviously and they understand that now when you look at his health
[27:33.440 --> 27:38.480]  Situations, you see his trembling hand in 2013. He denied he had parkinsons
[27:38.480 --> 27:43.040]  He said he had gone to a doctor told huffington pose. He said i went to a doctor because my hand's been shaking
[27:43.760 --> 27:48.480]  He said i wanted to make sure that it was parkinsons. They said it wasn't but he didn't say what it was
[27:48.480 --> 27:51.280]  What kind of situation that he has here?
[27:51.280 --> 27:56.640]  It's uh, so anyway, we'll we'll uh get back to that. But what i want to focus on is obama
[27:57.440 --> 28:01.440]  Because we had this lawsuit come out the beginning of the week
[28:01.440 --> 28:06.480]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg suing the trump campaign and suing roger stone
[28:06.480 --> 28:12.480]  And this was a group that uh was the white house is headed by obama's white house council
[28:12.480 --> 28:17.520]  A guy named ian bassin and the name of the group is united to protect democracy
[28:17.520 --> 28:22.240]  As we pointed out when this rub broke live on the nightly news, uh, wednesday night
[28:23.040 --> 28:25.520]  We talked about the fact that they named this group
[28:26.240 --> 28:30.080]  After a phrase it was an obama's farewell speech except obama
[28:30.640 --> 28:35.600]  Didn't go farewell. obama stayed in washington and we talked about that at the time how unusual that was
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.240]  That he set up a residence there. He brought in eric holder said we're going to get involved
[28:40.800 --> 28:41.680]  in
[28:41.680 --> 28:45.680]  Redistricting we're going to have a lot of lawsuits eric holder of course his attorney general
[28:45.680 --> 28:48.320]  Uh, they're going to lawyer up and they're going to have lawsuits
[28:48.880 --> 28:52.320]  Against various states trying to win in court
[28:52.960 --> 28:56.160]  What they lost in the elections because remember
[28:57.040 --> 29:04.640]  State houses uh looking at state offices across the country and congressional offices the democrats lost over 1 000 offices
[29:05.200 --> 29:10.560]  Under barack obama and so what they're going to do is they're going to focus on trying to change
[29:10.560 --> 29:15.600]  gerrymandering laws. They had no problem with gerrymandering when they were the majority
[29:15.600 --> 29:19.120]  But now they do and so we had barack obama this week
[29:19.680 --> 29:25.120]  His former white house counsel and the group united to protect democracy taken from obama's farewell address
[29:25.200 --> 29:31.440]  They sued roger stone and we're going to tell you what obama did last night and the importance of this
[29:31.920 --> 29:34.720]  They're not going to take this line down. So it's got barack obama
[29:34.720 --> 29:41.840]  George w. Bush bill clinton the entire washington establishment arrayed against donald trump
[29:42.000 --> 29:47.360]  And i would say also arrayed against his agenda to try to change obamacare. We'll be right back
[29:49.920 --> 29:52.960]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[29:53.840 --> 29:56.640]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:56.640 --> 30:09.200]  All the perplexities the confusion and distress in america arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation
[30:09.360 --> 30:13.040]  Not from want of honor or virtue so much as from the downright
[30:13.360 --> 30:16.160]  Ignorance of the nature of coin credit and circulation
[30:16.400 --> 30:20.320]  Those are the words of john adams the second president of the united states
[30:20.640 --> 30:25.440]  Are you ignorant of the private federal reserve? Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[30:25.440 --> 30:32.240]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[30:32.480 --> 30:37.920]  What kind of leverage do these people in the federal reserve have over the american people or for that matter?
[30:38.160 --> 30:41.120]  What kind of leverage do the saudis have over our money?
[30:41.600 --> 30:48.880]  Will you be a slave or will you be free adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people

[33:10.240 --> 33:17.840]  You found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with david knight
[33:17.840 --> 33:26.800]  Welcome back to the alex joneshow. I'm david knight on this friday june july 14th 2017. We were just talking about
[33:27.520 --> 33:31.040]  barack obama and his active opposition far more active
[33:31.680 --> 33:33.680]  than the slander that we saw
[33:34.240 --> 33:38.880]  bill clinton and george w engage in in that form that we just played for you
[33:39.520 --> 33:42.400]  But barack obama is doing and we talked about this the very beginning
[33:42.400 --> 33:48.720]  He brings in valory jared actually was living with him in the house that he bought there's renting in washington to stay there
[33:49.040 --> 33:50.080]  unprecedented
[33:50.080 --> 33:54.720]  We haven't had any presidents do that. Remember we had george washington essentially set the
[33:56.640 --> 33:58.640]  Set the pattern
[33:58.800 --> 34:00.640]  like senatis
[34:00.640 --> 34:05.520]  The roman leader he went back to his farm went back to the plow
[34:05.600 --> 34:11.440]  He imposed a two-term limit on himself voluntarily and then got out of it and that's been the tradition
[34:11.440 --> 34:17.520]  of our presidents with the exception of woodrow wilson who still was not active the way barack obama
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  Is becoming active
[34:20.080 --> 34:23.680]  Thursday night last night. He headed a fundraiser for the national democratic
[34:24.640 --> 34:28.480]  Redistricting committee now. What is this? This is the organization. We'd reported this earlier
[34:28.880 --> 34:32.640]  So he's going to have eric holder work with him to sue legislatures
[34:33.600 --> 34:34.880]  across the country
[34:34.880 --> 34:39.600]  Why because under barack obama the democrats lost over 1000 seats
[34:39.600 --> 34:45.040]  So what they can't win at the ballot box they want to win in court. That's the way these guys operate
[34:45.120 --> 34:48.320]  That's what they're trying to do across the country. They're trying to tie up
[34:49.120 --> 34:51.120]  trump's agenda and his
[34:51.520 --> 34:57.360]  Valid executive orders that he has the right to do this. This is something that even the supreme court upheld and of course
[34:57.360 --> 35:02.480]  There's been another move on that today a hawaiian judge when you get to that later
[35:02.880 --> 35:08.560]  Came back and said, oh, well, you know, they said family members and you interpreted that as immediate family members
[35:08.560 --> 35:13.600]  But we're going to interpret that as the entire extended family anybody that can prove some kind of relationship
[35:14.080 --> 35:18.560]  To these people will be allowed to come in. So that's the way they continue to roll in the courts
[35:18.720 --> 35:22.320]  But I want to give you an example of why this is important understand that
[35:22.720 --> 35:28.160]  gerrymandering has something that has been around from the very beginning of our republic and that is
[35:29.520 --> 35:31.520]  creating bizarre
[35:31.600 --> 35:33.600]  districts to try to
[35:33.600 --> 35:35.600]  favor one party or the other
[35:35.600 --> 35:39.360]  They looked at one of these districts that was drawn and said looks like a salamander and of course
[35:39.520 --> 35:42.560]  It's gotten to a real precise science now
[35:43.120 --> 35:47.360]  Where they can jump from one side of the road to the other side with the computerized
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.160]  Databases that they've had and that's been there for decades
[35:50.880 --> 35:56.880]  And a good example of the way this has worked that applies to obama is what I saw in north carolina when I was living there
[35:56.880 --> 35:58.880]  I was watching it very closely in 2008
[35:59.600 --> 36:01.600]  North carolina went for barack obama
[36:02.560 --> 36:04.560]  Just two years later
[36:04.560 --> 36:07.440]  There was a massive blowback against that
[36:08.080 --> 36:11.600]  The democrats basically lost every statewide election
[36:12.320 --> 36:16.560]  But they didn't lose any seats in congress. That was the only exception. Why?
[36:17.280 --> 36:25.200]  Because of gerrymandering that the democrats have always done the democrats had always controlled the state legislature since reconstruction
[36:26.080 --> 36:33.520]  And for the first time the state legislature changed hands and north carolina became republican now 2010 was an important year
[36:33.520 --> 36:38.800]  That was a year that they did the census and it was a year that they redrew the district in lines
[36:39.360 --> 36:42.560]  So understand remember they they took all of the
[36:43.760 --> 36:49.680]  State house and senate and they took all the statewide elections except for congress because that was set up
[36:50.240 --> 36:52.240]  With the redistricting rules
[36:52.400 --> 37:01.600]  So with the ability to redrew draw the district in lines in 2010 the republicans did so to their advantage as the democrats have always done for
[37:02.160 --> 37:03.440]  centuries
[37:03.440 --> 37:05.440]  And the next election
[37:05.840 --> 37:09.440]  The republicans got a majority of the seats in congress. So now what the
[37:10.320 --> 37:15.280]  Democrats have done is they've already sued in north carolina and they're going to do this across the country
[37:15.680 --> 37:19.200]  They say republicans currently control legislatures in 32
[37:19.840 --> 37:22.160]  Of the 50 states thanks to obama
[37:22.720 --> 37:29.040]  That's uh, we can thank obama for that and so what they're going to do is they're going to be suing everybody tying everyone up in court
[37:29.680 --> 37:32.480]  To get this through just as we saw this frivolous lawsuit
[37:32.480 --> 37:34.480]  that was put out
[37:35.040 --> 37:41.280]  Against roger stone and against the trump campaign their third parties as roger stone was saying they haven't even proven
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.200]  that these
[37:43.200 --> 37:49.040]  Documents from the dnc were hacked gulian assigned said they weren't he said there wasn't a state actor involved and
[37:49.440 --> 37:53.360]  Certainly roger stone and the trump campaign would be a third party to that
[37:53.440 --> 37:58.240]  But they're going to continue to do that to try to get publicity to try to fund raise off of that
[37:58.240 --> 38:03.440]  And the other was an interesting story that I saw on the guardian about what's going on in hong kong
[38:03.440 --> 38:07.920]  I think it's a a good example of where we're going with this absurdity when they
[38:08.800 --> 38:10.800]  Use any pretext
[38:11.360 --> 38:14.480]  To manipulate our elections, you know, hong kong
[38:15.280 --> 38:22.640]  Was free for a hundred years essentially under british rule the british ruled it with a very very light hand especially towards the end
[38:22.640 --> 38:29.680]  They let the hong kong people be free milton freedman did a series in 1980 called free to choose and he talked about how
[38:30.480 --> 38:35.440]  The hong kong people had such incredible freedom because the government didn't take much interest in them
[38:35.680 --> 38:39.600]  So they had a liberty there and I traveled there when we adopted my daughter
[38:40.400 --> 38:43.520]  We were there for a while. I thought it was interesting. We were looking at the money
[38:44.320 --> 38:50.320]  And I was looking at the different denominations and they looked radically different in terms of design in terms of color
[38:50.320 --> 38:53.200]  And it's like wait a minute. This is, you know, 20
[38:53.840 --> 38:57.520]  Hong Kong dollars and it's issued by this one bank and here's another one
[38:57.520 --> 39:01.440]  It's issued by another bank and I realized these are private banks that are issuing the currency
[39:01.440 --> 39:04.480]  They didn't have a central bank. I mean, it was the closest thing
[39:05.120 --> 39:09.040]  To america before the civil war that you could find in the world
[39:09.040 --> 39:13.840]  That's why milton freedman talked about how free they were the problem was that in 1997
[39:13.840 --> 39:19.920]  They're 100 year lease that the british had obtained at the point of a gun with the chinese government that ran out
[39:20.560 --> 39:25.760]  And so the issue at that point was well, are they going to fight china to keep hong kong free?
[39:26.080 --> 39:29.040]  The british weren't interested in hong kong. That's one of the reasons they were free
[39:29.040 --> 39:30.480]  So they turned it over
[39:30.480 --> 39:35.840]  To the chinese government. They got a concession from them saying they would treat them as a separate economist region
[39:36.480 --> 39:39.600]  We're now 20 years after that and now the main
[39:39.600 --> 39:45.200]  Mainline chinese government is really starting to come down hard on them and a good example of this
[39:45.760 --> 39:52.400]  Is a hong kong court has disqualified four pro democracy lawmakers for filling to sincerely take the oath of office
[39:53.120 --> 39:59.040]  And they say their disqualification means that pro democracy camp has lost its veto power over major legislation
[39:59.440 --> 40:05.440]  One most powerful tools in a parliament that is stacked with pro establishment. There'll be pro mainline
[40:05.440 --> 40:10.640]  communist chinese legislators who are the communist chinese are really coming down hard
[40:11.040 --> 40:17.360]  On the hong kong people and they are pushing back and so we had listen to what some of these people did when they took their oath of office
[40:18.480 --> 40:26.000]  One of them prefaced his oath with a quote from gandhi and a pledge to serve the hong kong people the chinese communists say that disqualifies you
[40:27.040 --> 40:32.080]  You can't serve. We're going to remove you from office another one did a slow motion reading of the oath
[40:32.080 --> 40:37.840]  She paused for six seconds between each word. She took 10 minutes to read the 77 word declaration
[40:38.480 --> 40:40.320]  and so the
[40:40.320 --> 40:44.480]  They threw her out said you did not show enough respect to this oath
[40:44.640 --> 40:47.760]  Okay, then in another one a guy whose nickname is long hair
[40:48.160 --> 40:54.240]  He held a yellow umbrella during his oath, which is a symbol of the city's 2014 democracy protests
[40:54.880 --> 40:57.920]  And the court wrote the manner in which he took the oath
[40:57.920 --> 41:04.480]  It goes well outside an objective reasonable range of such requisite solemnity and sincerity
[41:05.440 --> 41:07.440]  So we look at this and we say is this any more
[41:08.960 --> 41:14.640]  Ridiculous than what the democrats are doing with this fake russian red herring narrative
[41:16.240 --> 41:21.280]  It isn't any sillier than that and as one of the people there said ordinary people don't have a lot of power in hong kong
[41:21.360 --> 41:23.360]  We don't have a lot of power here in america do we?
[41:23.360 --> 41:28.160]  Now this most important right the right of our elected officials has been stolen from us
[41:28.160 --> 41:30.400]  What is the point of elections if they're meaningless?
[41:30.400 --> 41:34.080]  What is the point of elections if we can have the courts?
[41:34.800 --> 41:41.840]  And the lawyers the democrat courts and democrat lawyers and our former presidents basically shut this down and tie us up
[41:42.320 --> 41:48.720]  With nonsense charges that make absolutely no more sense than to take somebody out of office because they are
[41:49.040 --> 41:52.240]  Making a political statement as they're taking their oath of office
[41:52.240 --> 41:56.640]  That's just absolutely amazing. Of course. They've had other people that have been removed from this
[41:57.200 --> 42:01.920]  And that's what we're seeing in hong kong, but the people there are really angry. They're really fighting back
[42:01.920 --> 42:05.200]  You know, there was a couple of years ago that main line china
[42:06.160 --> 42:08.160]  Tried to institute a propaganda
[42:09.360 --> 42:11.360]  curriculum in hong kong
[42:11.600 --> 42:18.640]  That would teach about mal and talk about the benefits of communism and everything. These are people understand who have lived free
[42:18.640 --> 42:22.800]  And they're not taking that they took to the street by the thousands
[42:23.360 --> 42:28.720]  Do americans care about that? Do americans even know the agenda that is being put out there that we just had?
[42:29.600 --> 42:32.000]  the beginning of july we had the
[42:32.800 --> 42:34.080]  national
[42:34.080 --> 42:36.800]  educational association the nea the teachers union
[42:37.520 --> 42:44.480]  They had a convention and in that convention they talked about how they're going to use nea funds to push open borders to push the
[42:45.040 --> 42:47.040]  lgbtq agenda
[42:47.040 --> 42:53.760]  These are radical political agendas that are being taught to our children. We don't even care about that
[42:54.080 --> 42:59.520]  Nobody is taking to the streets. Nobody is taking their kids out of the schools the people in hong kong are paying attention
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  And we need to look and see what happens if you lose your ability
[43:04.640 --> 43:05.520]  to
[43:05.520 --> 43:08.160]  Really care about things if you become so apathetic
[43:08.960 --> 43:12.320]  That you don't know or care what people are even doing to your children
[43:12.320 --> 43:19.280]  Meanwhile, we've got fake news. It's another article. It's on info wars.com today's fake cnn news. Let's blow up russia
[43:19.280 --> 43:20.720]  We've got a clip
[43:20.720 --> 43:24.720]  from a long time clinton supporter. This is an article by steve watson
[43:25.520 --> 43:32.640]  On info wars.com today paul baghalla. He openly called for a discussion on bombing russia
[43:33.360 --> 43:34.640]  This would be
[43:34.640 --> 43:35.760]  funny
[43:35.760 --> 43:39.840]  If it wasn't so insane. I mean we are living in
[43:39.840 --> 43:41.840]  Dr. Strangelove
[43:42.240 --> 43:47.840]  I remember it was oliver star when he went to do this these uh this long form interview with latimer putin
[43:48.000 --> 43:53.840]  Actually sat down and watched dr. Strangelove with him. I guess it was an explanation of our current political environment
[43:54.240 --> 43:59.760]  Uh kind of a uh a crash course for latimer putin to understand the insanity of america
[44:00.000 --> 44:05.840]  That's a dark comedy, but this is a dark reality that we're living in. Let's play some of that clip
[44:05.840 --> 44:13.200]  Patriotic american should subvert an election with a hostile foreign power. That is what uh, donald trump jr. Agreed to do
[44:13.840 --> 44:17.120]  Uh with mr. Kushner and in mr. Manafort in the meeting
[44:17.600 --> 44:26.080]  We were and are under attack by a hostile foreign power and they seem to be abetting that hostile foreign power
[44:26.080 --> 44:34.000]  We should be debating how many sanctions we should place on russia or whether we should blow up the kgb or gsugru
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.960]  I mean we should be retaliating massively
[44:37.120 --> 44:40.800]  Unbelievable because by the way if i were trump supporter, I would want to retaliate massively because it is tainted
[44:40.800 --> 44:46.640]  It has tainted his victory, but there's Anderson Cooper. He's taking this seriously. They're not laughing at him unbelievable
[44:47.360 --> 44:54.800]  Unbelievable over the top and I just reported earlier this week how cnn is winning all these awards for a documentary that they did in syria
[44:55.280 --> 44:58.400]  Blaming everything that happened in Aleppo on the other side
[44:58.400 --> 45:04.240]  Uh, not on their people their people being isis and al-qaeda and they got access
[45:04.880 --> 45:10.240]  To shoot this documentary go where other journalists had been killed. They got access to get in there
[45:11.040 --> 45:15.120]  By working with an english propagandist for al-qaeda
[45:15.760 --> 45:22.160]  Or for isis whatever you want however you want to brand it. I mean you talk about cnn being isis. That is quite literally true
[45:22.160 --> 45:28.880]  Absolutely insane what cnn is is doing every day. It gets that more and more dangerous, you know
[45:29.680 --> 45:31.680]  All this talk about
[45:31.920 --> 45:35.440]  Uh ramping up war and of course this is something democrats were doing well before the election
[45:36.080 --> 45:42.640]  Saying that we're going to be looking at cyber attacks and if we ascertain or believe that these cyber attacks are coming from russia
[45:42.640 --> 45:47.200]  We will take that as if that were a physical attack on us and we will respond appropriately
[45:47.200 --> 45:50.640]  In other words, we're going to bomb people if we think that
[45:50.640 --> 45:52.640]  If we think that
[45:52.640 --> 45:58.640]  We got a cyber attack from you. Well, who knows where these cyber attacks are coming from. That's not something you can easily ascertain
[45:59.920 --> 46:04.480]  Anybody who is honest about this anybody who knows what's going on john mack if you talked about this
[46:04.800 --> 46:08.880]  Well before we had the latest wiki leaks of vault seven that showed that
[46:09.440 --> 46:16.560]  Uh, they have and actually wiki leaks was responsible. They did not leak out the code what they'd leaked out were the
[46:17.200 --> 46:18.480]  pdf
[46:18.480 --> 46:24.160]  Uh owners manuals if you will the documentation on how these programs operate to show what their capability is
[46:24.240 --> 46:26.640]  But not to give people the code to actually do it
[46:27.280 --> 46:32.640]  And what we saw with that was that they had numerous ways that they could mask themselves and we knew that was happening
[46:32.720 --> 46:37.600]  Everybody that was responsible. We talked to william benny. We talked to uh, john mack of the all these people said look
[46:38.560 --> 46:42.640]  All these people have the ability to disguise where they're coming from in a number of ways
[46:42.640 --> 46:48.800]  They can reroute it and as we learn with vault seven they can even make the keyboard strokes and so forth that people
[46:48.800 --> 46:53.760]  Have gone back forensically to try to identify what country this comes from they can make all of that look like
[46:53.920 --> 46:55.920]  They're coming from any country that they wish
[46:57.280 --> 46:59.760]  And so when they say we're going to uh
[47:00.480 --> 47:03.600]  Give ourselves the ability to or say that we're going to
[47:04.320 --> 47:11.120]  Physically start a war with russia if we ascertain that there was a cyber attack conducted against us by them
[47:11.120 --> 47:17.840]  That what they're saying is we're going to give ourselves the ability to just uh come up with any excuse to start a war to do a first strike
[47:18.720 --> 47:22.400]  And that's a very dangerous thing. That's something that democrats have been doing since before
[47:23.200 --> 47:28.560]  The election it's one of the reasons why they got uh general flann out so quickly because he was rational
[47:28.720 --> 47:32.640]  He was honest and they had to get him out the military industrial complexes
[47:32.800 --> 47:38.400]  I want to take a look at the emmy awards because I think this is part of this continuum that we saw
[47:38.960 --> 47:40.960]  with uh bill clinton
[47:40.960 --> 47:48.560]  With george w that we saw with obama's legal issues and of course remember it's not just the political establishment
[47:49.120 --> 47:54.560]  It's not uh just the media CNN, but the most important tool that they have
[47:55.360 --> 47:57.200]  is entertainment
[47:57.200 --> 47:59.200]  remember sololinsky
[47:59.200 --> 48:00.080]  uh
[48:00.080 --> 48:01.680]  rules for radicals
[48:01.680 --> 48:03.440]  The most effective
[48:03.440 --> 48:09.120]  Weapon is ridicule. He said and so we see saturday night live. They love saturday night live saturday night live
[48:09.120 --> 48:12.080]  God, I think it was 22 nominations
[48:12.720 --> 48:15.440]  They tied westworld for first place nominations
[48:15.920 --> 48:20.080]  Uh, this was because they're coming after president trump. And so when we look at the emmy's
[48:20.800 --> 48:25.600]  Are we we already know who the winner is the winner is anybody who is anti trump?
[48:26.560 --> 48:28.960]  And you have to understand that the emmy's and the oscars
[48:29.920 --> 48:33.680]  They're not important even if you like the shows. They're not important. You have to understand
[48:33.680 --> 48:39.440]  This is something that's done by the community. This is like a high school election
[48:40.240 --> 48:46.400]  We're the most popular people when the election it has nothing to do with the quality of the shows
[48:46.400 --> 48:50.400]  It has everything to do with whether or not they like you remember sally fields. They like me
[48:50.480 --> 48:53.920]  They really you really like me. It's a popularity contest
[48:54.160 --> 48:57.600]  She just won class president when she got that oscar nomination
[48:58.240 --> 48:59.600]  They know what it is
[48:59.600 --> 49:05.440]  Uh, it's their own peers that nominate them and you know, if you're a conservative, uh, you get shown the door
[49:05.440 --> 49:09.680]  You're not only not going to get a nomination. You're not even going to get a job. You're going to get blacklisted
[49:10.320 --> 49:12.320]  That's what they do to conservatives
[49:12.480 --> 49:14.960]  But when we look at this we've got the la times pointing it out
[49:14.960 --> 49:17.840]  It was a big year for saturday night live 22 nominations
[49:18.320 --> 49:23.920]  No doubt due to the show's non-stop lampooning of president trump and his associates likewise
[49:23.920 --> 49:29.680]  They said steven cobert returned to us political ways made his way back to the race with the late show
[49:30.000 --> 49:36.400]  And also handmade stale because that's highly political. They try to target that at trump and conservatives
[49:37.120 --> 49:38.880]  completely ignoring
[49:38.880 --> 49:45.920]  That everything that they have in the handmade stale is going on far worse in saudi arabia and countries under sharia law
[49:46.720 --> 49:49.840]  their worst dystopian nightmare that they say would be
[49:50.480 --> 49:52.080]  brought about by
[49:52.080 --> 49:55.040]  Christians in office is going on in sharia law
[49:55.760 --> 49:58.240]  So it was christians in office who gave us the first amendment
[49:58.720 --> 50:03.040]  It was christians in office who gave us the constitution in the bill of rights
[50:03.680 --> 50:07.920]  It was christians who after the revolution did not become dictators and tyrants
[50:07.920 --> 50:12.640]  But if you want to see the handmade stale and if you want to see something that is far worse than the handmade stale
[50:13.200 --> 50:14.640]  then do
[50:14.640 --> 50:18.640]  A documentary on what's going on in islamic countries
[50:18.640 --> 50:25.760]  Because islam is not a religion. It is a political system that is supported by a religion. The two are
[50:26.400 --> 50:28.080]  inextricable
[50:28.080 --> 50:33.120]  The caliphate is a fulfillment of their religion. And if they don't have a worldwide caliphate
[50:33.920 --> 50:36.160]  That is a disgrace to their religion
[50:37.120 --> 50:38.480]  Meanwhile when we come back
[50:38.480 --> 50:40.480]  I'm going to talk about the vatican
[50:40.480 --> 50:45.440]  Getting involved in this coming out of that truce with the pope didn't last too long with donald trump
[50:45.440 --> 50:53.200]  You know they shook hands and met but now the vatican is coming out after trump and after conservative catholics and evangelical christians
[50:53.200 --> 50:55.200]  We'll be right back
[51:00.960 --> 51:04.160]  It's a no-brainer a big burkey water filter is the one you need period

[54:19.280 --> 54:24.640]  Everybody welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight on this Friday, July 14th 2017
[54:24.640 --> 54:28.160]  Leanne McAdoo is going to be joining us in the next hour. She's got a report about
[54:28.480 --> 54:35.120]  Glyphosy that she wants to talk about of course. We're also going to talk about Russia China cyber espionage, you know as we look at the
[54:36.160 --> 54:42.080]  politicization of our intelligence community. I think we need a new word. I think we need to instead of calling it
[54:42.080 --> 54:46.080]  Espionage we need to call it elect espionage
[54:46.800 --> 54:50.080]  I have to write that out for you so you get it elect espionage
[54:50.640 --> 54:55.280]  And it's kind of like rich hall used to do if you remember that comedian who did sniglets coined words
[54:55.680 --> 54:59.440]  That's really what's going on. That's the thing that really concerns me much much more than
[55:00.320 --> 55:03.200]  Russia's involvement is the involvement of the NSA
[55:03.680 --> 55:09.440]  The involvement of the FBI that's been pointed out by the FISA court that they broke the law the FISA court made the ruling
[55:09.440 --> 55:14.960]  They declassified it. We have our intelligence community. This massive
[55:15.520 --> 55:22.320]  Surveillance state has now become involved in politics very politicized. That's something we should be very very concerned about
[55:22.880 --> 55:27.120]  People in Washington are the ones who should be the most concerned about that
[55:27.840 --> 55:33.120]  I want to get back to this story about what the pope is doing in terms of getting involved in our elections before I do
[55:33.120 --> 55:40.720]  Real quickly and remind you that we have extended our july 4th specials through the month of july it is now the july summer

[57:23.600 --> 57:30.800]  In paris today and i should mention that i've got a poll that'll be ending today that i put up on my twitter account liberty terrian
[57:31.360 --> 57:32.800]  About macron
[57:32.800 --> 57:34.000]  you know they're uh
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  They're shaking hands or anything and you know macron
[57:36.480 --> 57:40.400]  held court in versailles people saying what what is he some kind of a monarchist
[57:40.480 --> 57:45.280]  He's threatening parliament saying you better not block my reforms and i'm going to cut the number of
[57:45.680 --> 57:48.800]  People in parliament. He's going to reduce their number of representatives
[57:48.800 --> 57:53.840]  I mean that's one of the things we need to do to get back control of our government is to increase the number of
[57:54.320 --> 57:59.760]  Representatives that we have that's another discussion for another day, but it's also uniting with merkel and so i asked
[58:00.480 --> 58:04.640]  People in the poll i said what does he see himself as what does he want to be when he grows up?
[58:05.200 --> 58:09.600]  This little guy macron does he want to be the leader of vichy france because you know
[58:09.600 --> 58:14.160]  We've now put the germans in charge of unified europe. That's what hitler always wanted
[58:14.160 --> 58:19.040]  Does he want to be edipus rex? This is a guy who married his high school teacher that he fell in love with when he was
[58:19.600 --> 58:20.480]  15 years old
[58:20.480 --> 58:25.600]  Or does he want to be marie antonette right now the leader in all of this poll is all of the above
[58:25.600 --> 58:31.360]  So you can join that poll if you want and tell macron what you think of him. Uh, we'll be right back stay with us

[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:15.280]  From the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.160]  Welcome back to the alex june show i'm david knight lienne macadoo will be joining us in the next segment
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.480]  I want to talk about what the batican is doing in terms of opposing trump remember we had the
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.000]  Uh 30 minute meeting that donald trump took with the pope
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:37.120]  They had a quiet face-to-face meeting. It'd been pretty contentious before that remember during the election
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.760]  We had the pope
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.880]  Criticizing calling on christian the idea that we would have borders the pope is an open border
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.760]  socialist world government
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:52.960]  Uh, and he wants the world government to save the climate and so forth. That's where this guy's coming from
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.960]  the total new world order
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.040]  uh pope he is the
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.880]  The religious ethical face that the new world order is using to sell this agenda
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.920]  And so even though they had that meeting now the
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:13.920]  Vatican press has lashed out at catholic trump voters and call steve bannon a supporter of apocalyptic
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.480]  geopolitics, this is from zero hedge
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.960]  Listen to some of the quotes from this. This is a jesuit priest who's the editor of this
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.080]  um
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:28.080]  Of this uh, vatican publication. He had a 2700 word paper that he put out this week
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.400]  and
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:36.960]  He said there was a surprising meeting of minds between some catholic voters in the us and the evangelical christian right
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.040]  So he's upset about the fact
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:45.440]  That conservative catholics and evangelical christians come together on things like abortion
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:53.040]  And same-sex marriage. He said they harbor a nostalgic dream of a theocratic type of state
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:02:00.400]  Well, we know that the vatican is selling their dream of a secular humanist world government
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.640]  He said those who profess themselves to be catholic
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:10.400]  Expressed themselves in ways that until recently were unknown in their tradition and they're using tones that are much closer to evangelicals
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:19.120]  He said they're xenophobic. They're islamophobic. They want walls. They want deportation. See, this is the globalism that is now
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.720]  endemic
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.800]  In the vatican so some conservative catholics have been outraged by the piece one conservative catholic blog said
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.360]  that due to the unprecedented nature
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:35.600]  And the direct attack that it makes on the united states its current administration american evangelicals conservative
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.480]  Catholics in the united states and europe and africa
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.040]  combined with the rise of islamism
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:47.600]  The article's overreaches is nothing if not breathtaking and of course the pope is going to continue his anti-trump
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.640]  pro-globalist agenda
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.000]  Just remember when they came out with this climate
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.320]  encyclical
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.000]  One of the four guys who read it who wrote it. There's a guy john schellenhouber
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.120]  He is a german climate expert a self-appointed expert
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:10.480]  But this is a guy who rejoices in the fact that if we don't do anything
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.240]  The whole world is going to melt down and our population is going to be reduced from seven to under one billion people
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.480]  That's going to be more than an 85 percent reduction. So he's happy about that. He said
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.240]  That's a triumph for us because we could stabilize our population
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.480]  And this is a guy who has proposed that we have a global
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.840]  Democratic society. He wants an earth constitution. He wants a global council
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.280]  He wants a planetary court that they can haul you before
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.920]  And understand as we see macron
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:46.160]  Meeting with donald trump that was a very important for donald trump to get out of that paris climate agreement
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:50.240]  We never were really in we had obama say he was going to self ratify that
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:54.000]  He was going to sign it because he knew that the congress is not going to ratify that agreement
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.120]  But it was important to shut that thing down
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.160]  And in response we had macron come out and say well in the 22 years
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.200]  We will ban all internal combustion engines which 99 of the french people
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.560]  Choose over electric only 1 percent of the people in france by electric cars
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:17.920]  They're going to shut that down in at the same time. They're going to shut down the sources of electricity
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.280]  They're going to shut down fossil fuels and even nuclear power
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.440]  I you know
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.480]  That's why I say macron needs to grow up. This guy is on another planet
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:35.440]  He thinks that he is referred to himself as jupiter. I'm seriously. This is not we're not making this up. This guy is
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.600]  Major delusional
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:43.360]  So is algore saying that the fight to save the planet is like the fight to end slavery
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.680]  No, it is a social agenda
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:59.840]  We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:06.000]  Unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:13.120]  Governments are instituted among men for the sake of freedom and for the sake of freedom and for the sake of freedom and for the sake of freedom
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:19.120]  These rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:22.560]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:28.560]  It is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.840]  Independence isn't a day
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.680]  It's a mindset an attitude that says I will not be your dependent
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.360]  I will not be your slave
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:45.360]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements when you trade your liberty for safety
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.680]  To that extent you become their slave
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:52.560]  Slaves are never safe. You won't get rich by being a slave
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:59.680]  Guard your liberty regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it forever wars.com. I'm david night

[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:17.840]  Available at infowarslife.com coming to you from the former united states of america from deep in the heart of texas it's alex jones
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:31.840]  Welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this friday july 14th 2017 we're going to be joined by leanne macadoo who's been on extended leave
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:39.840]  She's in florida so she's joining us via skype we'll talk about election issues but we also want to talk about health issues
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:49.840]  We had a story earlier this week pointing out that in the uk you're more likely to get cancer than you are to get married or to have children for the first time
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:09:01.840]  Just as likely to have cancer than to get a college degree it's becoming something of a rite of passage for all of us and it's because of what we have in our food and our water
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:11.840]  It's an incredible story you just brought up about cancer being the new normal
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:21.840]  It's increasing as birth rates are going down that's another part of this as well it's not just they want to tell us that's simply societal changes
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:31.840]  That people want to have careers that are laying having children everything but it's also the chemicals that they're putting in the water make it difficult for people once they decide they want to have kids to have kids
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:43.840]  And so that's a big part of the plummeting number of children that the people are having but this and this cancer thing tell us a little bit about this report and let's play this report for people
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:57.840]  Well this is actually a story that Rob do sent to my attention a positive story another win another victory for the consumer we've got a new tool to help us choose wisely at the grocery store and other places
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:16.840]  Obviously the non GMO project is a great label to look for but now we can start looking for a glyphosate residue free food label so there's actually a number of products on the market right now that have already kind of paved the way for products like your cooking oils
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:29.840]  And your mayonnaise your condiments things like that that people don't really think about but we use all the time with every meal essentially so it's a glyphosate residue free certification it's a new label that you can begin to look for
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:52.840]  And it's a it's a really positive thing as well because it's going to start pushing farmers say in India to go more organic and to get away from these pesticide laden foods and genetically modified franken foods that they are pushing on us in a great big science experiment and then of course pushing this narrative that cancer is totally normal
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:11:09.840]  Yeah they just put up an article as you were talking about a Tennessee area that put restrictions on the use of glyphosate and that's something that people need to realize I always thought about it living in a rural area we filter our water because even though you don't have somebody adding fluoride to your
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:24.840]  water if you've got well water you have people who are growing agricultural products if they're using glyphosate that gets down into the well water that you're going to have and but you're talking about it being systemic and all of these different products you don't even think about
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:33.840]  Think about it being in water but you don't realize that it's in so many other products let's take a quick look at your report and we'll talk about that afterwards
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:53.840]  There's a new tool in the arsenal when it comes to taking back your health a company is now going to make it easier than ever for you to avoid pesticides when choosing your food products they are introducing the new glyphosate residue free food labeling
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:12:10.840]  and this is all thanks to that consumer based push for transparency chosen foods and heavenly organics are two food makers that already have several products out on the market but the director of the detox project who is the creator and owner of this
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:28.840]  glyphosate residue free label says that the certification will enable food manufacturers to give consumers what they really want glyphosate residue free food now there's been a lot of pushback in recent years with people understanding that the toxicity standards
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:42.840]  the test that they have for testing both non organic and organic foods is very weak of course if you're someone who's trying to sell organic you're already having to jump through a lot of regulatory hoops it costs a lot of money for farmers to go organic
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:59.840]  for some reason they really try to make it hard for the organic farmers to thrive in this country but even so with that the toxicity testing is very low very weak and beyond that you don't know what you're going to get in your condiments and your salad dressings
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:17.840]  your mayonnaise even some of your most favorite snacks and of course your cooking oils so this company is trying to make it very easy for you to just choose right away and make sure that you are avoiding glyphosate and hopefully in the future some of these other insecticides that are hitting the market
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:36.840]  we know glyphosate is the most widely used insecticide that is out there of course this was the herbicide that was used for Monsanto's genetically modified crops but something that was really interesting in 2015 the World Health Organization labeled glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:53.840]  it's probably could give you cancer mmm tasty and so people had they were just in shock at this what are you saying you're spraying this poison all over our foods but right about the same time another chemical company was right on the heels of Monsanto
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:14:10.840]  and while allies were on Monsanto Dow Chemical was coming up with their own genetically modified crops as well and so they were creating their own herbicide that they would spray on their crops because remember a lot of crops have become resistant to glyphosate
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:24.840]  which means that these farmers were having to spray even more glyphosate on the crops so Dow Chemical comes up with their own version of crops which people haven't got their pitchforks out just yet to come after Dow Chemical
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:40.840]  so the EPA when all this is going on at the World Health Organization saying yeah you probably shouldn't be spraying that poison on your crops might give you cancer they go ahead and approve Dow Chemical's herbicide blend it was called enlist duo
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:56.840]  and they said not only were they going to pass it through and approve this for use on their crops but they also the amount of pesticides that they were going to allow them to spray on the crops was just insane tons of pesticides that they were going to allow to be sprayed
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:17.840]  and get into the soil of our earth it would spread to the water so interestingly thanks to a lot of pushback the EPA was actually forced to revoke the approval of that Dow herbicide for their GMO crops and in a court filing back in 2015 they said you know the EPA discovered new information
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:33.840]  suggesting that the herbicide could be more toxic than previously believed so of course this was due to a lot of that consumer based pushback where people were saying what are you thinking you're labeling one insecticide is probably carcinogenic
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:53.840]  yet you're granting access to another company to come and do the same with a whole new version of products that we haven't even begun to fight against environmental protection agency looks like they wised up a little bit at least in this case and that's of course due to active consumers out there who are pushing back against this stuff
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:09.840]  but I wanted to draw your attention to some of these products they've got a lot of like I said cooking oils condiments and snacks and things they have launched but heavenly organics likes to point out how they support nearly 600 family farmers in India
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:25.840]  they're helping them produce 100% organic crops they hope to get up to about 5000 within the next five years and that's really key because we saw over the last few years ten years plus there have been a rash of farmer suicides in India
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:39.840]  now of course a lot of people wanted to say oh well they had alcoholism or family problems mental issues that weren't addressed but a lot of people a lot of social activists were saying no the common denominator here and you know eight out of ten cases
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:58.840]  was that these farmers were very indebted to these banks because they were sold the story that if they went ahead and bought the GM crop BT cotton and others specifically that they would just it would be a cash cow and they would have these massive crops they'd be drought resistant
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:17.840]  so these farmers in India this is their livelihood they went ahead and bought this story and majorly indebted to the banks and now they are killing themselves in mass numbers in 2004 alone 18,000 plus farmers committed suicide
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:31.840]  so this is just one more tool that you can use when you're out shopping I really love the non GMO project label I'm seeing it everywhere now for instance I was just trying to buy some artichokes the other day and there was about 30 different varieties on the shelf
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:41.840]  and I was able to narrow it down quickly to just three brands thanks to this non GMO project label they also have an app you can download that makes it really easy to go shopping
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:51.840]  so this is the power of voting with your dollars pushing back against these corporations who CSS just a science experiment that's to be fed a steady stream of pesticides and franken foods
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:18:03.840]  we are not a science experiment we are humans and we are reclaiming our power and this glyphosate residue free food label is just another victory for the consumer
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:24.840]  that's a great report and the point that you made in that about the farmers in India I think is something that is really important that people don't realize the insidious business plan of Monsanto to essentially poison the ground for other crops
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:38.840]  they can't grow other seeds other than there's anti genetically engineered seeds that cannot reproduce themselves so that these people then have to buy these seeds from once they poison their field by using Monsanto on it
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:53.840]  they say well look you know we're going to give you these crops and if you use glyphosate on it then it'll get rid of the weeds but it won't kill our crops but then they poison their land and then they can't even regrow the crops that they bought the seed that they bought from Monsanto
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:19:06.840]  so now they're in debt to the company store they load 16 tons and what they get you know another day older and deeper in debt and they get to the point where it becomes so egregious that massive numbers of them are committing suicide
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.840]  this is the evil of this corporation that we're seeing here
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:25.840]  right and of course to sell this as the miracle seeds that are going to save the planet and be drought resistant and that all of these farmers are going to be lifted out of poverty because they're going to be able to pull in such massive amount of money with these miracle crops
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:42.840]  and it's all a crack basically so we have many activists there especially in India working on behalf of these people to to push back against them going in debt to the bank the only thing they have is their land so when you no longer have that
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:52.840]  and that's the core thing that we see here we say that from the IMF but we see this from all these monopoly capitalists whether it's the people who want to control our transportation or the people who want to control our food
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:20:02.840]  they want to own everything they want to turn you into a renter even if you're a farmer you got to rent your seeds from them that's the way these people roll they want to own everything we'll be right back
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:30.840]  we'll be right back

[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:12.840]  Trump is more popular than first lady Hillary Clinton was I don't really find that surprising because you know it was Hillary Clinton who took it upon herself to try to nationalize health care immediately after becoming first lady that didn't make her very popular in the eyes of
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:26.840]  many people but the interesting thing about this is they said it's not uncommon for first ladies to be more popular than their husbands because they're just there and they're talking to people they're not proposing any policies that people get angry about
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:43.840]  but with Hillary Clinton it was the other way around Bill Clinton was more popular than Hillary Clinton and Melania is way more popular than Hillary Clinton was and she's had her popularity going up which is not surprising but I think this is
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:28:01.840]  we had a poll earlier this week Leanne were Democrats thought that Hillary Clinton only had a 4% to only 4% of Democrats believe that she could beat Donald Trump in a matchup again that's the essence of this that's why they're coming up with this ridiculous Russian narrative
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:06.840]  that we're going to talk about in the next section is because people dislike her so much
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:17.840]  and that's why it's not unbelievable at all that she lost the election but it's why is it so hard for them to understand they put forward a really bad candidate nobody wanted her
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:27.840]  and that's really funny point you bring up about her she wore the pants suit in that relationship with to get in there and try to you know make such big moves like that as first lady
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:36.840]  it doesn't surprise me Melania is beautiful and she's feminine she's smart speaks several languages so she's not afraid to you know
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:50.840]  she always saw herself as an Eleanor Roosevelt as a matter of fact she was channeling Eleanor Roosevelt in seances in the White House I mean she saw herself as somebody who was going to be this great socialist
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:29:00.840]  they like to call themselves progressive this great socialist campaigner as Eleanor Roosevelt was and it was absolutely amazing to all of us we are you know they want to talk about
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:13.840]  Jared Kushner and the involvement of the Trumps in the White House or anything but they weren't complaining about nepotism when the first lady decided that she was going to take over this massive sector of the economy
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:25.840]  far more intrusive even than Obamacare even Hillary Clinton and Pelosi came back and said well you know let's not try that again let's do it incrementally that's the way we can take this over
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:35.840]  and that's really what Obamacare is it's a first step in an incremental takeover to get us back to what Hillary Clinton tried to do as first lady when she was first elected
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:49.840]  when we come back we're going to talk to Leanne McAdoo about the election like I call it Alex Bienage because we have the spy agencies in America getting involved hacking our election we'll be right back
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:30:00.840]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:13.840]  James Madison the father of the Bill of Rights wrote where an excess of power prevails property of no sort is duly respected no man is safe in his opinions in his person in his faculties or in his possessions
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:26.840]  is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington the only question is how do we contain it and how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual that is the ultimate concern
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:39.840]  the concentration of power the excess of power was always the chief concern of the founders of this country it was why the anti-fiddleist opposed the constitution they believe they put safeguards in the constitution to abuse that concentration of power
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:49.840]  but as James Madison also pointed out knowledge will forever govern ignorance of people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:58.840]  arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing of what the real constraints upon them are only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions

[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:46.840]  about alexionage that is the manipulation of our election by our intelligence community by our law enforcement community by people who are foreign spies Christopher steel working for M.I. five fusion GPS say Russian front organization that put together the dirty dossier they
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:34:03.840]  came after Carter page and now this is their third bite of the apple coming after Donald Trump junior this is a very dangerous situation that we have here this is far more dangerous than anything that Russia could do what our own intelligence agency could do to us
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:20.840]  and even people like Lindsay Graham are starting to get cold feet about it I guess Lindsay's wondering what they've got on them he was actually asking them when they were going for their reauthorization they supposedly have to reauthorize this ability to eavesdrop and of course they did that in a way that
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:37.840]  violated even that law that I think stretches the bill of rights beyond the breaking point in my opinion but with the FISA court coming out and saying they violated the law at Lindsay Graham asking them when they look for the reauthorization of that section of the
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:55.840]  Patriot Act he said you collect the information on me well we can't tell you senator if we told you we'd have to kill your privacy yes I told you this would have to kill you that type of thing and that they need to understand that they are the prime targets of this we've said this from the very beginning
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:11.840]  if the people in Washington are not already too far compromised with their secret lives they better get rid of this stuff but it may be too late based on the crowd that we've got in Washington I want to play and get Leigh Ann's comments on this back and forth
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:29.840]  that Tucker Carlson had with someone on with a let's see this is a this is a Democrat congressman I believe or Congress person anyway we'll find out who it is when we look at this clip I was looking at the back and forth that they want to punish the Russians for having
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:44.840]  RT this is very similar to what's going on right now with the Gulf States coming after Qatar saying we want you to shut down Al Jazeera why because Al Jazeera has been a critical of Saudi Arabia and some of these other states so that's what
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:36:00.840]  we're seeing now we're seeing massive pressure being applied internationally to sit sir news media that's why it's so important for you to stand with info wars to make sure that you don't give a monopoly of information back to CNN back to ABC NBC CBS those people
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:15.840]  who controlled all information the United States prior to this we don't want to go back to that situation they're continually pushing on this and so here's a guy here's somebody with Tucker Carlson pushing for Russians to be punished over having RT and I want to get Leigh Ann's
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:30.840]  comments after we're finished with us. There's nothing we can do about it. Russian propaganda can do this but what we can do is protect our democracy from it and we can punish the Russians for what they did we can impose sanctions.
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:43.840]  No no it's not a cable network it's Russian propaganda that promotes false information that gets reposted on the internet shared with you. What role does Larry King play in this? I have no idea.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:49.840]  He's like one of the lead anchors there. No I'm sorry. No I don't know about Larry King's show. Larry King's Russian propaganda is he?
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:57.840]  Of our team which is a well-documented Russian propaganda operation that you think the US Congress and the intelligence agency is going to fight back against you?
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:03.840]  No what I think we ought to fight back against is for them to interfere with our presidential election.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:13.840]  We can't stop our team from existing but we can punish the Russian government for having the audacity to interfere with our election.
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:24.840]  Well there was a story about all of the money raised in the Clinton campaign or by the Clinton Foundation is used by the Clinton's personally and the Clinton campaign is funded by the same sources.
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:35.840]  Alright okay this is a Democrat congressman his name is Ceciline I guess is the way you pronounce his name I've never seen this guy before but he is in the mainstream of the Democrat Party.
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:49.840]  If you can't defeat somebody's narrative you try to censor them so they're going to lock up or shut down Lionel they're going to shut down Max Kaiser they're going to shut down Larry King because they can't handle a free market and information.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:57.840]  That's always the tactic they take in early and when they had the demonstrations here at this abortion clinic in Austin.
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:10.840]  And people were there with signs talking about what abortion really is and these counter protesters quote unquote showed up and they just had blank black signs to put over other people.
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:22.840]  They had nothing to say it was simply censorship I thought that was one of the most incredible things I've ever seen because it was a physical demonstration of what has now become standard operating procedure for the Democrat Party censorship.
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.840]  They no longer support free speech in any way shape or form.
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:32.840]  Right there they're the only ones that are allowed to access the secret documents and then they'll tell you what you need to know.
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:41.840]  So we need to shut down CNN because they are just a propaganda channel for the Democrats. I mean think we would have to shut down the BBC.
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.840]  It makes no sense. We know that maybe they're not funded directly by the government.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:51.840]  But these are people who are definitely propaganda channels.
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:39:01.840]  Well it shows desperation because for the longest time we had back when they just had the three channels of whatever we had the CIA with Operation Mockingbird people can look that up.
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:05.840]  It's a real thing. It's not a conspiracy theory. It really happened.
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:19.840]  Operation Mockingbird giving the talking points to the news media telling them exactly what to say and they would all just in line pair it back what the as Mockingbirds would pair it back what the CIA and the government had told them to say.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:23.840]  And they're very upset about the fact that they've lost control of that.
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:33.840]  And that's why they're only responses. We've got to find some way to shut down and control the Internet. We've got to shut down Info Wars. We've got to shut down Breitbart. We've got to get the FEC coming after them.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:40.840]  They already tried and failed to do the FCC but I'm sure they'll come back. Some Democrat commissioners on the FCC will try it as well.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:48.840]  But they're going to try every trick in the book to shut people down and they're not trying to hide the fact that they openly want to censor everyone and everything.
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:51.840]  The Internet and entire news media organizations.
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:40:09.840]  Right well and we see these intelligence agents are still infiltrating the media to push their agenda by leaking all of these stories anonymous sources that feed the media the secret ledger or the secret dossier and all of these stories that turn out to be false when further
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:16.840]  investigated but it's able to push an agenda and the news media the establishment media will just eat it up.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:26.840]  We're still seeing a lot of the deep state work the establishment work behind the scenes to leak stories that turn out to be false but it doesn't matter by that time because it picks up steam.
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:39.840]  And as long as you're telling people what they want to believe what they want to hear then they're going to accept it as the truth they don't they don't need you to provide any evidence they just you've confirmed their bias.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:46.840]  A good example of that broke today because we had this story about Donald Trump Jr. Now this is about day number five.
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:57.840]  I think with their putting this out and so now NBC has dropped a new bombshell they said it's like look we have a former Soviet intelligence officer attended the meeting with Donald Trump Jr.
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:09.840]  But zero hedge reports ah but there's a catch they say that this is a bombshell but actually this information has already been reported by the New York Times last week so this isn't a new revelation.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:14.840]  They're just dripping this out to try to keep this story going and who is this guy.
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:21.840]  Well he was a Soviet born counterintelligence officer but he immigrated to the United States quite some time ago.
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:33.840]  He is now an American lobbyist and he holds dual citizenship in the United States and they point out ironically we're just spitballing here so don't hold us to it but maybe just maybe this is zero hedge writing.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:48.840]  Bringing a lobbyist to a meeting in which your intent is to lobby for the overturn of the Magnitsky act might just be something that makes sense rather than being part of a larger plot to rig an entire American presidential election.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:52.840]  So there is nothing again to see here and that's what we have seen over and over again.
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:42:03.840]  We have seen effort after effort by these Democrat contractors fusion GPS crowd strike others putting out a narrative that the Russians hacked this or did that.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:14.840]  We see the dirty dossier stuff coming from fusion GPS we see John McCain shopping this dirty dossier around we see the attacks on Carter page all the stuff nothing has come of it.
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:26.840]  All collapsed but they ever said every as soon as one of these things falls down they bring up the next one which just shows that they don't have anything that none of these things have stuck but they keep bringing more and more of them up.
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:46.840]  Right David the fact that they spent $1.6 billion trying to get Hillary Clinton elected they weren't able to come up with any dirt on President Trump with all that money.
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:56.840]  That's a slippery slope and that would start kind of peeling back the curtain to what do these campaigns.
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:08.840]  What do they engage in to get intel on their opponents what sort of dirty tricks were the Democrats up to to get Hillary Clinton who has very low poll ratings no one likes her.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:34.840]  What were they up to to try to get this woman elected and as we see you know you poke that hornet's nest people are saying well look what John McCain he was so excited to get some opposition intelligence against Trump that he dispatched an aid to go collect this dirty dossier so that he could then provide us with the FBI and circulated around.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:41.840]  So they can try to hire this guy and the FBI meanwhile takes another Democrat contractor crowd strike.
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:44.840]  They say well you say that the Russians hacked your server.
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:47.840]  Oh really they did okay well we'll take your word for it.
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:48.840]  Could we see those servers.
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:50.840]  Oh no you're not going to show those services.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:56.840]  Okay that's all right we're the FBI we won't bother with that we'll just go away and take a take your word for it.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:08.840]  And that's what is happening so then they take the crowd strike narrative and they have a handpicked panel of sycophants come before clappers of the DNI the director of National Intelligence.
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:14.840]  And so they have this handpicked panel of people from the FBI the NSA and the CIA come in.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:26.840]  And he says well nobody objected when we gave them this report from CrowdStrike so everybody agrees and that's where we get the 17 intelligence agencies the phrase came from Hillary Clinton and these people parodied it.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:32.840]  Parodied it throughout the election which I think basically says that they violated the Hatch Act.
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:40.840]  They were obviously in office campaigning for Hillary Clinton pushing this narrative along with many other things that they were doing.
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:52.840]  And that's the thing that's very concerning is how the intelligence and law enforcement community violated the Hatch Act interfered in our elections and violated their own laws as pointed out by the FISA court itself.
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:45:08.840]  Well David I mean we know that they're very good at regime change we've seen it happening all over the world to foment civil unrest and delegitimize their elected representatives to throw them out so that they could install.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:14.840]  There are deep state puppets in all of these other countries where they want to push for this globalism.
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:16.840]  We haven't really had to see that here.
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:22.840]  They haven't had to push for regime change here in the United States because they were always able to get their agent installed.
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:35.840]  But they can't do that now with President Trump and that's why we're actually seeing people who need to be investigated for trees in here in our country who are actively working to overthrow our president.
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:48.840]  President Trump needs to take the power and the ability that he has right now to investigate people like George Soros who are actively supporting protests and paying for protests with some of his NGOs and organizations.
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.840]  Not just in the United States but other countries as well.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:46:01.840]  We've seen that he's been very successful in other countries like the Ukraine for instance they were able to delegitimize Yanukovych there and get him out to put in their globalist person in the Ukraine.
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:05.840]  That's what they're trying to do here. They need to be investigated for treason.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:09.840]  You're absolutely right. This is dire straight-thrin. This is a dangerous time.
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:12.840]  We have George Soros organizing it.
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:19.840]  Exactly. We have George Soros organizing the overthrow of the government in Ukraine and working with the State Department.
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:23.840]  We have the quotes of the talking about how they contributed money to that.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:33.840]  Then they come around and the Democrats are working with the Ukrainians in order to try to get opposition research on Paul Manafort and others to try to take down the Trump campaign.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:43.840]  What they're accusing Donald Trump Jr. and the Trump campaign of doing, which they actually didn't do, they walked out of the meeting with this woman.
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:50.840]  They didn't get any information but the Democrats spent a lot of money and did get a lot of information and they overthrew other governments.
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:57.840]  Now they're trying to overthrow our government and that's the thing that people really need to pay attention to.
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:04.840]  It's one of the things that Trump's Justice Department needs to get serious about prosecuting these people who have violated the law,
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:11.840]  who have used their office in violation of the Hatch Act and in other ways violated laws by exposing people,
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.840]  by spying on people without a warrant, without a search warrant.
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:19.840]  The FISA court has pointed out how they broke the law. We need to do something about that.
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:26.840]  We can't allow people like Comey and McCabe to stay in office to escape punishment in Hillary Clinton.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:30.840]  Let's not forget Hillary Clinton. Let's Hillary for prison.
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:34.840]  I mean, that has to happen. We have to have some kind of prosecution of these people.
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:38.840]  They cannot be above the law, especially with the criminal actions that they're doing.
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:47.840]  The longer they let this go, the more they're going to turn our country into a third world, kind of a East German Stasi state,
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:51.840]  that's really what we're looking at now with our law enforcement intelligence agencies.
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.840]  You're absolutely right. It is projection.
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:59.840]  And they are trying to say that Donald Trump Jr. doxxed himself because he released these emails.
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:05.840]  How could he, how could he just, that to me is something that an innocent person would do.
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:13.840]  Who would say, look, here it is. Here are my emails. They wouldn't delete them and then use bleach bit to wipe their server just for good measure.
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:18.840]  That's right. Yeah. If you're in business, what is, what is a good practice of somebody in business?
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:22.840]  If something happens, you do full disclosure and you do it right away.
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:27.840]  That's not the way the politicians play it. They like to hold on to this stuff for the very last minute.
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:33.840]  They like to fight you every, every inch of the way, but he's just doing what a person in business would do.
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:39.840]  He's doing what an innocent person would do and say, look, here it is. Look, there's nothing here and there isn't anything there.
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:47.840]  And yet it's this constant drip, drip, drip, just like they're saying, oh, look, now we found out that there was a guy who was a former Russian agent who was at this meeting.
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:54.840]  And he's lived here for a long time and he's been lobbying people all over Washington as has this Russian lawyer.
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:49:01.840]  There was a report from the Daily Caller talking about all the different people that she's had a relationship to.
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:06.840]  According to the Washington Post, she worked for years with Glenn Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS.
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:12.840]  She's met and lobbied the California representative, Ron Dellums, as a hired lobbyist.
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:17.840]  So she's worked with people that are involved in the California government, Jerry Brown and others.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:25.840]  She was given the visa to come in. She was denied a visa and then they gave her an exception.
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:29.840]  And she stayed beyond the point at which she was supposed to go back.
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:32.840]  So she's actually here illegally at the time she had the meeting.
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:42.840]  And then a couple of days later, she is there in a congressional hearing behind a former ambassador to Russia, always with the Democrats.
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:46.840]  This woman is a Democrat operative and that's the key thing.
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:52.840]  It was a setup. It was a trap to make him guilty, not even by association.
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:58.840]  They didn't really even associate with these people, but just guilty by his own proximity to this person.
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:04.840]  Well, and it's just interesting that we have the establishment media won't follow that story.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:14.840]  They won't follow that paper trail that continues to lead back to the Democrats to their own corruption and collusion with the media establishment as well,
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:16.840]  colluding to try to get Hillary Clinton.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:19.840]  It all circles back to them again and again and again.
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:24.840]  The only corruption that has been exposed here is on the side of the Democrats.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:36.840]  And it's incredible to see how our free and independent press refuses to actually go there to follow the money and to report the news to the American people,
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:40.840]  the news that we can actually use to stay free.
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:45.840]  Yeah, exactly. Let's take a look at what's happening with other news.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:48.840]  We've got a guy who is investigating Clinton's emails.
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:54.840]  Somehow it looks like he had maybe a Clinton side. We're going to take a look at that and other suicide associated with the Clintons.
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:51:00.840]  We'll be right back with Leigh Ann McAdoo. Stay with us.
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:05.840]  Are you one of the 15 million men in the U.S. who suffer from an enlarged prostate, also known as BPH?

[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:15.840]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.

[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:08.840]  You do that instead of a painful injection.

[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:39.840]  Thank you for supporting us.
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:46.840]  Now, Leigh Ann, we were talking in the last section about this lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya,
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:48.840]  who has worked for the Democrats for a very long time.
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:54.840]  We had Breitbart, Daily Caller News, put together essentially a long list of people
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:59.840]  that she's worked with, Democrats, people like Ron Dellums, Jerry Brown, Howard Dean,
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:03.840]  Joe Trippi via a Democrat lobbyist that she was working with.
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:07.840]  Loretta Lynch, letter in the country, made exceptions for her.
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:10.840]  She was in John McCain's office back in 2015.
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:15.840]  We see from her Twitter account that she opposed Donald Trump vociferously on multiple occasions.
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:19.840]  She also supported Hillary over Bernie Sanders.
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:21.840]  And she's worked with Fusion GPS.
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:23.840]  And now we have Fusion GPS.
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:30.840]  His boss has looked like he was going to be called to testify at a Senate judiciary hearing.
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.840]  But he has said, no, I don't think so.
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:33.840]  Not going to do it.
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:38.840]  Isn't it interesting that people like this get to tell the Senate what they're going to do,
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:39.840]  what they're not going to do?
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:44.840]  Just like we had CrowdStrike, the DNC contractor that had their servers said,
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:46.840]  no, we're not going to show the FBI the servers.
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:48.840]  They're going to just take our word for it.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:52.840]  Meanwhile, we got people like Roger Stone begging to clear his name.
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:57.840]  People like Carter Page begging to clear his name before these committees in Congress,
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.840]  and they won't let them do it.
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:01.840]  But the Democrats say, no, I'm not going to even come in.
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:02.840]  You can call me, but I'm not going to come in.
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:03.840]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:04.840]  Yeah.
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:09.840]  They must be guilty because they want to speak publicly and clear their name.
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:13.840]  Whereas other people who want to actually bleach bit their computers,
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:15.840]  they get to go run to be the president.
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:16.840]  It's incredible.
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:17.840]  We live in Wally World.
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:21.840]  It's what we were talking about about Donald Trump Jr. saying, OK, here's the emails.
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:22.840]  You think there's something here?
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:23.840]  There's nothing here.
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:24.840]  Here's the emails.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:25.840]  Take a look at them.
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.840]  And now they try to make something out of that.
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:32.840]  Another thing that I think is interesting that broke today is an individual, Republican
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:37.840]  donor, an operative from Chicago's North Shore, who said that he had tried to obtain Hillary
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:39.840]  Clinton's missing emails from Russian hackers.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:45.840]  He killed himself, committed suicide, another Clinton side in a Minnesota hotel room days
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:49.840]  after talking to the Wall Street Journal about his efforts.
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:50.840]  It's kind of interesting.
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:52.840]  They said that he committed suicide.
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:56.840]  He was found with a bag over his head and a source of helium attached.
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:58.840]  An odd way to commit suicide.
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:04.840]  But even Stranger Leigh Ann is a note that he left that said, no foul play here whatsoever.
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.840]  I mean, it's like, move along.
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:08.840]  There's nothing to see.
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:10.840]  Nobody writes a suicide note like that.
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:11.840]  And nobody says this.
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:17.840]  Nobody says, I'm doing this because I'm worried about my life insurance of $5 million expiring.
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:21.840]  I mean, if you do that, then of course, you're not going to get the life insurance.
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:22.840]  I mean, come on.
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:24.840]  This is absolutely amazing.
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:29.840]  We're out of time, but thank you for joining us, Leigh Ann McAdoo, who is now in Florida.
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:33.840]  And we're going to be joined by Owen Shroyer in the next hour.
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:34.840]  Stay with us.
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:58.840]  A break in just a minute.
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:05.840]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have

[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:20.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:24.840]  I'm David Knight and in the next segment we're going to be joined by Owen Schreuer.
[02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:30.840]  We're talking earlier about Donald Trump's visit to Paris meeting with the Sun King,
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:39.840]  Jupiter himself, Macron, who is pushing this climate deal that Trump wisely exited with
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:44.840]  the advice of his EPA pick and many other people who really understand what's going on
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:45.840]  with this.
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:52.840]  We have to get out of this, people who even support the idea that we've got to eliminate
[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:55.840]  carbon dioxide that is going to burn the planet up.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:57.840]  They know that this isn't going to do anything towards it.
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:00.840]  All it is going to do is just harm our economy.
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:03.840]  And there's a story from WorldNet Daily earlier this week.
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:08.840]  US cities and states who are in love with the Paris climate deal face a new hurdle.
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:11.840]  A lot of these people have said, we're going to stay in the climate deal.
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:13.840]  We don't care if Donald Trump gets us out.
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:16.840]  Actually, no, you don't have a say in that.
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:20.840]  They say about a dozen states, including Washington, Oregon, California, Minnesota,
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:24.840]  Virginia, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, rebelled against President
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:28.840]  Trump when he withdrew from the Paris climate accord.
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:32.840]  And it was interesting because earlier this week we had Turkey come out and say,
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:37.840]  we're going to get out of it as well because if the US isn't in there to give us money,
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:40.840]  then there's nothing in it for us to shut our economy down.
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:44.840]  We're going to shut our economy down, but we're going to get massive cash payments
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:45.840]  for the United States.
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:50.840]  That only highlights what a horrendous deal this is for the United States,
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:54.840]  because we have to shut down our economy and we have to do it at an earlier date
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:56.840]  than the so-called developing nations.
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:59.840]  But then we have to compensate them as well.
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:03.840]  So we shut down our economy and send massive amounts of money to these other countries.
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:06.840]  But more specifically, it's going to go to the leaders of those countries.
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:08.840]  That's the way foreign aid works, don't you understand?
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:10.840]  You've seen that before.
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:11.840]  We all know how that works.
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:15.840]  We all know that the person who was going to get the money was Erdogan himself.
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:16.840]  It wasn't going to go to the Turkish people.
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:18.840]  It wasn't going to go to their economy.
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:19.840]  It was something that he was going to pocket.
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:21.840]  That's the way it happens in these third world countries.
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:25.840]  Some of the states have already formed the United States Climate Alliance
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:30.840]  to uphold the previous US commitment that is not a commitment.
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:36.840]  Obama self-ratified it because he couldn't get Congress to sign on to the constitutional
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:37.840]  ratification process.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:39.840]  So he just made it up.
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:41.840]  He and Kerry signed it and said, we're going to ratify it ourselves.
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:43.840]  No, it doesn't work.
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:46.840]  And he found out, as we all know, that if he comes in and just says,
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:49.840]  well, I'm going to do it by executive order, then Donald Trump comes in and says,
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:51.840]  well, I'm going to undo it by executive order.
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:52.840]  It doesn't have any effect.
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:56.840]  They said there's also 267 mayors and governors who have signed an open letter
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:00.840]  to the international community and to other parties of the Paris Agreement.
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.840]  However, there is a problem.
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:06.840]  Congressional research service says the Constitution, remember that Constitution?
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:10.840]  That thing these guys swear to that we don't usually pay any attention to,
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:11.840]  but maybe they will now.
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:16.840]  It allows for federal law to preempt state and local law in a number of areas,
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:18.840]  including foreign policy.
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:20.840]  Yes, that is not their jurisdiction.
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:21.840]  And they point out this.
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:26.840]  They said, even when there is no actual conflict between state and federal law or policy,
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:31.840]  the Supreme Court has held that a state law can still be deemed an unconstitutional intrusion
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:37.840]  into the field of foreign affairs if it results in something more than an incidental
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:39.840]  or indirect effect on US foreign relations.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:42.840]  In other words, this is kind of like the Logan Act.
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:49.840]  Remember when we have Bilderberg and we say we got people that are engaging in setting US policy?
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:53.840]  Actually, they're also doing something that is far worse, far more criminal
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:58.840]  than what Donald Trump Jr. was even ever accused of.
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:02.840]  We got people who are at the highest level of multiple governments, meeting in private.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.840]  Nobody is allowed to know what they're talking about.
[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:05.840]  They show up.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:11.840]  As we saw, Ed Ball from the UK shows up with a suitcase, not with clothes filled with papers.
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:13.840]  They keep saying, oh, this is just a friendly meeting.
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:16.840]  He showed up with a suitcase filled with papers.
[02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:17.840]  We got it on film.
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:24.840]  My wife was there as an info wars reporter, shot him as all this stuff fell out of his suitcase
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:27.840]  while he was fumbling for his credentials to try to get into the place.
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:31.840]  Showing what a lie this whole thing is, that is a violation of the Logan Act
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:35.840]  when you've got people who are trying to override our foreign policy.
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:42.840]  Just as John McCain has done, trying to conduct foreign policy, going over and supporting ISIS in Syria,
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:43.840]  that's a violation of the Logan Act.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:51.840]  And if these states and mayors try to get involved in setting our foreign policy with the climate Paris Agreement,
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.840]  that is also a violation of the Logan Act.
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:54.840]  And the Constitution, I would add.
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:55.840]  Stay with us.
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:57.840]  We'll be right back with Owen Shroyer.
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:29.840]  Thank you for that brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean.
[02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:33.840]  The unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant phrase.
[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:39.840]  Every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite, every troublemaker, and I am sorry to say
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:45.840]  some others of an entirely different character will try to downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and ridicule.
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.840]  But these are some of the things they do.
[02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:49.840]  They build your basic character.
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:53.840]  They mold you for the future roles as a custodian of the nation's defense.
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:58.840]  This was said on May 12, 1962 by General Douglas MacArthur.

[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:31.840]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:36.840]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodine,
[02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:38.840]  instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:44.840]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used its biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:52.840]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.

[02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:03.840]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:07.840]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:14.840]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:21.840]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance, all to make them march, make them protest,
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:30.840]  make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports,
[02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:38.840]  bully and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:42.840]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:53.840]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:08:18.840]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:28.840]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. I know one shoyer is joining me and he's got some breaking news about a corruption case that happened in New York State.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:33.840]  Is that correct? It was the ex-speaker of the House, a massive bribery case.
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:36.840]  And we're going to take a look at some other court cases that are coming up.
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:41.840]  Are we winning or are we losing in the courts? Because this is where the Democrats want to fight us.
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:50.840]  We've got a new decision today from another judge trying to undermine Trump's travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court.
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:09:00.840]  It was shut down by local judges, by district judges, and now we've got another federal judge in Hawaii trying to expand the number of people who can be brought in.
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:03.840]  But let's take a look first at this corruption case that you've got here.
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:12.840]  This is an amazing story, David, and this is the kind of thing that I think all Americans are frustrated with, whether you identify yourself as a Republican or Democrat or Independent, whatever.
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:19.840]  And that's people that are above the law. That's one of the biggest things we have with the beef with the way the Hillary Clinton email scandal was handled.
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:23.840]  I think that we've obviously got more developments on that with Peter Smith's alleged suicide.
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:33.840]  But if you flash back to November 2015, you would have heard the story about Sheldon Silver found guilty on seven counts of corruption.
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:41.840]  This is a man who's taking millions of dollars in bribes, pay for play programs typical of a Clinton crime syndicate that you would expect.
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:47.840]  And so he's guilty. He's sentenced to 12 years in jail. I think he was 72 when that conviction was settled.
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:54.840]  Well, yesterday, the decision got reversed. Sheldon Silver's corruption conviction is overturned.
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:58.840]  And the way they did this is actually shocking and it shows you how the Trump operates first.
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:06.840]  Ex-state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's 2015 corruption was overturned by a Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:13.840]  Now, this is a conviction, again, $4 million in bribes in exchange for political power here that he was convicted on.
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:18.840]  This is a Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter appointed judge.
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:25.840]  This is a Democrat appointed judge who let this Democrat Clintonite walk.
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:30.840]  And the name of the judge is Circuit Judge Jose Cabrains.
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:39.840]  And the Second Court that he rules over said that the instructions given to jurors in Silver's case that defined an official auction were overbroad
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:44.840]  and that a properly instructed jury may not have found Silver guilty of corruption.
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:51.840]  So basically, what Jose Cabrains has said is that the judge is above the jury.
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:54.840]  That, oh, we don't agree with the jury's decision here. I'm the judge.
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:11:00.840]  I'm just going to go ahead and overrule that because, well, this is a Clintonite. This is a Democrat. This is one of us.
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:03.840]  So he gets to walk. And this is what Judge Cabrains said.
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:12.840]  We cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found Silver guilty if it had been properly instructed on the definition of an official act.
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:19.840]  So he doesn't like the jury's decision. So he goes, you guys are clearly irrational or misinformed. So I'm just going to overturn that conviction.
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:23.840]  It gets even worse though, David. It gets even worse if you didn't think that was bad enough.
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:32.840]  In a similar case, Brooklyn Assemblyman William Boylan Jr. was convicted on the exact same grounds.
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:38.840]  So you've got two cases, same charges, different convictions or different punishments.
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:45.840]  Why? Because some people are above the law. You play with the Clintons. You got blackmail with the Clintons. You're above the law.
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:56.840]  Now, Dean Scalos, who is also being looked at for the similar crime, he is trying to use the same argument that got Silver out of his jail time.
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:59.840]  So this is the swamp, David. This is how it works.
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:04.840]  You get in with the Democrats. You get appointed by the Democrats. You go for pay for play with the Democrats.
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:08.840]  It's all blackmailable. There's all blackmail on each other. And then they all get in the same system.
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:17.840]  Sheldon Silver gets to walk free when you and I both know that there are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people in the state of New York and across this country
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:24.840]  that are locked up for petty crime that have done nothing but maybe steal a stick of gum or maybe smoke a joint on the street.
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:29.840]  They go to jail, but Sheldon Silver, millions of dollars in bribes, gets to walk.
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:36.840]  I am infuriated over this, David. I am absolutely disgusted. This is how the swamp works and it's still going on.
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:42.840]  Well, it's very similar to what you were talking about before with Comey saying, you know, Hillary didn't have any intention.
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:50.840]  Well, that wasn't a part of the law. So we're going to let her go and then they lock up a guy who takes pictures of where he was in his submarine.
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:58.840]  He clearly had no intention of doing anything, turning these over to the Russians. They were only up to the lowest level of confidential.
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:06.840]  We have multiple levels, confidential, secret, top secret, and then the kind of stuff that Hillary Clinton was involved in, which is above top secret.
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:10.840]  But of course, her releasing that information, no problem.
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:17.840]  But one guy takes three or four pictures of his bunk or where he lived in the submarine to show his kids later on as grandkids.
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:22.840]  He goes to jail. That's what we see, that double standard that is there. And that's what you're talking about here.
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:25.840]  The fact that the people at the top get off and everybody else goes to jail.
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:31.840]  Well, and here's the funny thing. I'm glad that you brought that up because they wanted to say that Hillary Clinton had no intent.
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:38.840]  OK, well, if you get pulled over, exactly, if you get pulled over speeding and you say, well, officer, I had no intent to go 100 miles per hour.
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:42.840]  My car just happened to be a fast car. Yeah, that's not going to work.
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:47.840]  But that's basically what they're saying here for Silver. Another statement made from the judge.
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:54.840]  A rational jury might have concluded that Silver did not engage in an official act when he agreed to help Dr. Taub with permits for a charity race.
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:14:00.840]  So this is one of the cases. It's a cancer charity race. They raise a bunch of money. The race never happens.
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:06.840]  This doctor gets a bunch of people from the attorney's office who had the cancer to sue through his law firm.
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:11.840]  You know, millions of dollars bribery, pay for play. It's all going on. The race never happens.
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:16.840]  And so the judge just says, well, Silver had no intent that the race was going to happen.
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:22.840]  We can't prove that he intended for that money to just fall into his lap. He didn't intend for that.
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:25.840]  He meant to do something with it eventually, but it just didn't happen.
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:30.840]  So he just kept the money and he didn't return it to anybody and he didn't hold the race and he didn't give it to the victims.
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:45.840]  I'll tell you, if Dean Skelos, who is now pleading for the same case to overturn what would have been his conviction, if he gets away with this and I was the legal team of Assemblyman William Boylan Jr.,
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:55.840]  I think my head would explode because you have two cases of the same thing and two people that walk and your client goes to jail.
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:15:00.840]  Just look at what's happening with the acting FBI director, McCabe, who was the number two for Comey.
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:07.840]  His wife was running for Senate in Virginia and the governor, Terry McAuliffe and Hillary Clinton's foundations are being investigated.
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:18.840]  He was also, he was investigating them at the time. He was investigating her for the email, her email classified stuff that we just said that Comey said, oh, we're going to let her off.
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:26.840]  As they were being investigated on this, his wife was running for office and they made donations to her.
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:33.840]  So this is something that is, this is beyond just ethical violations that are happening here and this is a guy who said of the FBI.
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:41.840]  So what are we going to do? The guy who is a governor in Virginia, a longtime political operative for the Clintons and the DNC, Terry McAuliffe.
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:46.840]  So this is something that is, we have rampant corruption from the top to the bottom.
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:50.840]  Something needs to be done about it. Here's another example of out of control courts.
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:56.840]  We had today a judge expanding on his own the list of relatives that have been exempted from the Trump travel ban.
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:06.840]  Remember, we had all these activist judges and these district courts, federal district courts saying, no, no, no, the president has no ability to set form policy or immigration policy, whatever,
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:10.840]  even though they allowed Obama to do that, no, when Trump does it, he can't do it.
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:17.840]  And so that was overruled by the Supreme Court and now a federal judge in Hawaii on Thursday expanded the list of family relations.
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:28.840]  He said, no, you can't exclude grandparents, grandchildren, brothers in laws, sisters in laws, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins.
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:33.840]  It's like, it's like, so just going to bring everybody inside.
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:48.840]  Oh, yeah, I'm related to Muhammad over here. All of Muhammad's related. So basically, there's another judge that just come in with a trick to try to overturn the travel ban from countries that Obama was at war with.
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:52.840]  We're dropping bombs on these countries, presumably because they're dangerous.
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:59.840]  If they're not dangerous and we don't need to vet the people who are coming in from these countries and restrict it, then why are we dropping bombs on them?
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:06.840]  Another example of the corruption in the courts, Owen, is this is a judge that is hearing the case of the Center for Medical Progress.
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:14.840]  Remember these people who did the underground videos of Planned Parenthood and others talking about how they wanted to traffic and baby body parts.
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:31.840]  Well, we have a district judge who was ruled against them and he has now come after the lawyers defending this guy, holding them in contempt because they pointed out that this lawyer, that this judge has a conflict of interest.
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:38.840]  He has been involved. He served as a board member of Planned Parenthood's affiliated Wolford Family Clinic.
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:47.840]  So this is a judge who has been a board member of a Planned Parenthood clinic and he doesn't recuse himself from this case.
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:53.840]  And the lawyers point that out and they try to get him removed. Now he holds the lawyers in contempt of court.
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:18:10.840]  Contempt isn't a strong enough word, I think. Chuck Grassley called out McCabe on the Hill, I think this was either yesterday or two days ago, saying, why didn't you recuse yourself from the Flynn investigation when you clearly had a personal vendetta against Flynn?
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:19.840]  This is the same thing. This is so obvious. I'm just so confused. You've got these liberal judges, David. They think they're above the law. They think they're above juries.
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:27.840]  They think they're above the people. So they step in. You decided the case with this travel ban. So they step in and they take themselves above the law.
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:31.840]  They take themselves above whatever is the case. Where are the conservatives to do this?
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:38.840]  Where are the conservatives that are going to step in and put their foot down in the sand and say, enough. This is enough.
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:45.840]  There is clearly collusion between McCabe, I mean, the Clintons, the Comeys, these judges that are overturning the travel ban, these judges that are setting silvers.
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:50.840]  I mean, when are we going to have somebody take these people down? When is a conservative going to step up?
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:54.840]  I mean, Chuck Grassley seems to be the only one doing it right now. I'd like to see Trey Gowdy go harder.
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:19:00.840]  Trump is trying to endear himself to the entire world right now. I mean, somebody has to step up and do something about this, David. I'm getting fed up.
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:11.840]  You mentioned McCabe and his conflict of interest with Flynn. He is under investigation three or four different cases because that was the situation of sexual harassment.
[02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:20.840]  Flynn got on his bad side by writing a letter of recommendation for the woman who he'd worked with for a very long time, and that's the kind of guy that Flynn is.
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:28.840]  If he sees something that is wrong, he will speak out. That's what got him fired from the Obama administration. He talked about how we were helping ISIS, so they got him out of there.
[02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:37.840]  Then he gets on the bad side of Andrew McCabe and the FBI because he defends a woman who was doing great work and all of a sudden gets shut down.
[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:51.840]  When we come back, we're going to talk about why Trump has obstacles here in the courts. It's because they've been packed by Obama and because these guys have lifetime appointments like the Supreme Court.
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:55.840]  That's what needs to be changed if you really wanted to drain the swamp. Get rid of these lifetime appointments.

[02:24:11.840 --> 02:24:15.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here with Owen Schwier.
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:25.840]  Owen brought in the story about the judge who just overturned a jury conviction of corruption of the leader of the New York Assembly.
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:33.840]  It was a massive bribery and corruption charge and the judge says, well, I don't see how a jury could have convicted him unless they really didn't know what they're doing.
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:34.840]  So I'm just going to set that aside.
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:41.840]  And you know what's interesting about the rhetoric and I know we need to move on here, but it's the same thing that Comey said. This is what the judge said, a rational jury.
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:45.840]  A rational jury. Remember what Comey said? No rational prosecutor.
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:47.840]  Yeah, that's how they rationalize their tears.
[02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:53.840]  Yeah, we're not rational. The people aren't allowed to be rational. We, the people, don't have the capacity to be rational anymore, David. That's what it is.
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:25:03.840]  So he should have had a judge who has overturned the Trump travel ban being reinstated by the Supreme Court. He comes back in and he says, oh, well, we're going to extend this from the immediate family.
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:08.840]  We're going to include in-laws and cousins and aunts and uncles and all this kind of stuff broadening this.
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:15.840]  So what are we going to do about this as we've got the other case we talked about was the judge in California looking at the Center for Medical Progress.
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:23.840]  They're undercover investigation Planned Parenthood. The judge there is sitting on the board of Planned Parenthood, refuses to recuse himself.
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:29.840]  And when the lawyers say you have a conflict of interest and try to get him removed, he comes after them for contempt of court.
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:31.840]  These corrupt courts, what are we going to do about them?
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:39.840]  Well, the courts that are very key in this, the Washington Appeals Court and two appellate courts that have been ruling against Trump's travel ban.
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:44.840]  Reuters points out it's going to be difficult for Donald Trump to do anything about that.
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:48.840]  He just had some conservative picks that he put into federal courts.
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:51.840]  And so that's a win and daily call reports on that.
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:54.840]  But are we winning or losing? What can we do about these courts?
[02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:58.840]  The problem is, this is Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:07.840]  I said, Trump is not going to be able to make any significant dents into the Democrats' control of those three appellate courts, those appellate circuits.
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:10.840]  And it's not even that. It's much worse than that.
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:17.840]  They say after eight years in office, Obama was able to make enough appointments to leave a strong liberal imprint on the federal courts.
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:25.840]  When he left the White House in January, nine of the 13 federal appellate courts had a majority of Democrats.
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:28.840]  So they have lifetime appointments.
[02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:33.840]  Today we had some conservative judges appointed by Trump and it was a victory.
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:39.840]  They said the Senate panel cleared several of President Trump's judicial nominees just hours before the White House announced
[02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:44.840]  its fifth slate of judicial candidates, but still in these key areas.
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:49.840]  So it's a win on one side, but on the other side, Obama's got a block.
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:57.840]  Nine out of the 13 appellate courts, so these appellate courts that can overturn this stuff, that can shut down and block what President Trump is doing.
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:01.840]  They have been packed by Obama and they have lifetime appointments.
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:08.840]  Many of these people, today we had conservative legal commentators, though, enthusiastically praising the picks that President Trump had.
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:14.840]  Newsome, Bush, Schiff as solid picks with excellent jurisprudential bona fides.
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:22.840]  I said, thank you, President Trump, for keeping your campaign promise, continuing to pick excellent nominees, including those that were voted on today.
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:25.840]  That was the Council of the Conservative Judicial Crisis Network.
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:29.840]  So there's some progress that's being made, but it is really, really clogged.
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:35.840]  Obama was able to do all of this and get away with it because no media was going to report on it.
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:42.840]  Nobody was going to put out the stories that Obama was creating a judicial block here with all these judges that he appointed.
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:50.840]  But it's amazing to hear you break that down and it just makes me realize how the judiciary branch of the government does not represent the people whatsoever.
[02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:56.840]  It has zero representation of we the people, zero representation of the way the Republic feels right now.
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:00.840]  We never vote for these people. They get never appointed politically.
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:05.840]  It's like the Supreme Court. We've got nine political appointees there for life. We have absolutely nothing to say about it.
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:08.840]  And that happens all the way down the federal judiciary.
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:15.840]  And that's the key thing. Our elected representatives in Congress have basically abdicated everything that they do.
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:24.840]  They've abdicated it to the lobbyists who write the laws to the bureaucracy that then extends those laws and enforces those laws into the courts.
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:30.840]  And they don't do any, our elected representatives don't do anything in Congress. It's all the courts and the bureaucracy that is doing this.
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:36.840]  Well, we all have bias, okay? And a judge, just here, there's always going to be some bias. It's just inherent.
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:45.840]  But here's the difference to me, David. When you put in a liberal judge, they go into that seat with a mindset, an agenda, a political agenda,
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:52.840]  an anti-American because America's bad and sexist and racist and now I'm a judge. Now I can do something about it. Now I can make a difference.
[02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:58.840]  That's the mindset that they go in with. Now, the conservative judge goes in, again, everybody's got their bias,
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:05.840]  but the mindset to me of a conservative judge is, okay, I need to take a look at how this relates to the Constitution.
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:10.840]  I need to think about what this means to the Republic, what this means to the Constitution, what this means to the future of this country,
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:18.840]  a totally different mindset, a totally different agenda. It's an agenda-driven judiciary branch versus a justice-driven judiciary branch.
[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:26.840]  And what the liberals say is, we have a living Constitution. We have living documents. The written words don't mean anything.
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:33.840]  That was the big split between the people like Scalia and hopefully his replacement, Neil Gorsuch, and the people on the left.
[02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:38.840]  The people on the left said, I'm just going to do whatever is in the best interest of the people. I don't really care what this says.
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:44.840]  Or even Justice Kennedy, who looks at foreign law to make his decision, not the Constitution.
[02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:49.840]  We'll be right back with Owen Schroyer. I'm David Knight.
[02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:53.840]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.840 --> 02:30:00.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.840 --> 02:30:07.840]  The Constitutional Convention 1787 was held strict secrecy, and at the end of the preceding, citizens gathered outside Independence Hall
[02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:10.840]  to learn what had been produced behind closed doors.
[02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:16.840]  Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall. A lady asked him, well, doctor, what have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[02:30:16.840 --> 02:30:19.840]  To which he responded, a republic, if you can keep it.
[02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:23.840]  But today, not only have we lost a republic, but most people don't even know what a republic even is.
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:26.840]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:32.840]  A republic operates under the rule of law, which protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:38.840]  Under a republic, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws, regardless of political power or lack thereof.
[02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:42.840]  Democracy, on the other hand, only leads to mob rule-fueled by the unrestrained whims of the public.
[02:30:42.840 --> 02:30:48.840]  In a democracy, the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have no protection against the unlimited power of the majority.
[02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:50.840]  It is a case of majority over man.
[02:30:50.840 --> 02:30:54.840]  In other words, under democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:57.840]  But under a republic, a sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[02:30:57.840 --> 02:31:00.840]  This is Kit Daniels with Denfolwors.com.
[02:31:00.840 --> 02:31:04.840]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:31:04.840 --> 02:31:08.840]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:31:08.840 --> 02:31:13.840]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:13.840 --> 02:31:22.840]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:30.840]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:38.840]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:40.840]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:44.840]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:48.840]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:54.840]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:54.840 --> 02:31:57.840]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.
[02:31:57.840 --> 02:32:00.840]  And then fullwarstore.com.
[02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:53.840]  I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them because regardless you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:59.840]  infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or triple-A2533139.
[02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:27.840]  Alex Jones talking about this Wall Street Journal story.
[02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:32.840]  The post office gives Amazon special delivery subsidies of $1.46 per package.
[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:34.840]  You know, we have free shipping.
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:39.840]  You don't have to buy infowarsprime at $10 a month like you do with Amazon.
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:42.840]  We give you free shipping for the month of July.
[02:33:42.840 --> 02:33:43.840]  We also give you free video.
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:45.840]  You can watch us for free.
[02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:47.840]  You can go on the internet and take a look at it.
[02:33:47.840 --> 02:33:51.840]  We absorb those bandwidth issues if you're listening through our app.
[02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:55.840]  You can also go to YouTube and catch our videos.
[02:33:55.840 --> 02:33:57.840]  Even auto-ship is free.
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:33:58.840]  Even our auto-ship is free.
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:33:59.840]  That's right.
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:00.840]  That's right.
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:09.840]  If you sign up for auto-ship and you get free shipping, if your order is $50 a month or more, and that's a way to make sure that you never run out of product.
[02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:13.840]  But we have a special that is going on right now, our July summer mega special.
[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:22.840]  It's going to go through the end of July at infowarsstore.com, free shipping, store-wide on everything for everybody, whatever quantity you get.
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:31.840]  And we have, in addition to that, discounts, 30% off of these products, some of our most popular products, Brainforce Plus, SuperMail Vitality.
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:36.840]  We have Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, Gut Health Support Pack.
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:38.840]  All of those are 30% off.
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:47.840]  We have 30% to 40% off InfoWare Select Storeable Food, a great time to stock up on that free shipping, plus 30% to 40% off of InfoWare Select Storeable Food.
[02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:49.840]  That lasts for 25 years.

[02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:54.840]  It's all made in the U.S.
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:56.840]  No GMO products in any of that.
[02:34:56.840 --> 02:34:58.840]  Also, 25% off Secret 12.
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:02.840]  That's our vitamin B12 formulation that you can take sublingually.
[02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:05.840]  You can put that under your tongue instead of having to take an injection.
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:09.840]  And DNA Force, one of our premier products, 20% off.
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:16.840]  All of that, in addition to free shipping, part of our July summer mega specials now live at infowarsstore.com.
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:25.840]  Let's go to Alex's report where he's talking about Amazon as we see that Jeff Bezos is on target to become the richest man in the world.
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:34.840]  But then he gets subsidies from the U.S. government for shipping his mail order products as he puts out bricks and mortar stores or going out of business left and right.
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:37.840]  That's our report from Alex Jones.
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:43.840]  It's less and less common to read mainstream media and see a story that actually tells the truth.
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:47.840]  It actually stands up for the general public and a free and open society.
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:54.840]  But I read one of those articles today by a Josh Sandbute from the Wall Street Journal.
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:36:05.840]  And by the post office gives Amazon special delivery, a city group analysis finds each box gets $1.46 subsidy. It's like a giant gift card from Uncle Sam.
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:15.840]  And behind every mega rich person, whether it's Warren Buffett or Carlos Slim or the Rockefeller Rothschild Dynasties,
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:27.840]  government corporate partnerships that create the mega super wealthy. And that's why John D. I famously wrote and stated many times that the cardinal sin was competition.
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:35.840]  Crony capitalists want consolidation. They want governmental and multinational control, which they write and which they are largely exempt from.
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:39.840]  Just like the U.N. diplomatic community and tax community and all the rest of it.
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:45.840]  And this article he breaks down. Well, you know, I drive by all the retail collapsing and think, oh, that's just free market.
[02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:53.840]  There'll be winners and losers. But then he realizes as a business researcher and writer that the truth is when the trucks pull up to his house and neighbor's houses,
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:37:06.840]  they each have $1.46 subsidy on the average package from the U.S. Postal Service, delivering it to your door cheaper than it costs the Postal Service.
[02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:13.840]  But here's the deal. Only big mega corporations basically get the subsidiary. And the more they ship, the more they get.
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:21.840]  And so that's why we have to offer free shipping to even attract people to M4store.com, even though we have a lot of proprietary products,
[02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:30.840]  because Amazon has created this climate and it's not free market. It's done by subsidizing their system via the taxpayers.
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:41.840]  Just like Carlos Slim made $10 billion roughly in profit off of the Obama phone program that cost what was it, $3 billion or more a year.
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:49.840]  Okay. And he's one of the richest men in the world. It's in between Bezos of Amazon and the Washington Post and Whole Foods.
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:54.840]  It's in between that, Robert Barron. And it's in between Carlos Slim.
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:59.840]  Now, that's who publicly is the richest. There's a lot of old money that's even better than that.
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:06.840]  But they go over this whole subsidy that's behind it. And that's why I've told my wife, I've told everybody,
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:13.840]  if something is available somewhere else, even if it's another big company, try to go buy it from them or a mom and pop,
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:21.840]  or let's go to the farmer's market. We've got to keep competition alive because these monopolies are coming in and are devastating things.
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:27.840]  And it's time to break these monopolies up. You know, until a few years ago, we sold our items on Amazon and we sold quite a bit.
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:33.840]  We sold our folks buyer items and resell them. There's also some Chinese fakes on Amazon. That's how popular in FullWarsLife.com is.
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:39.840]  But I said, let's just pull our Amazon shopping carts because I don't want to contribute to this.
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:43.840]  But it's getting to a point where we can't beat them, join them. Well, I'm going to hold out.
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:48.840]  And I'm going to believe folks are going to keep visiting in FullWarsStore.com and supporting us there and buying products there.
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:54.840]  And this isn't about just a plug today. This is about realizing that I talk to my neighbors and others and I say, listen,
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:39:00.840]  we don't go to Starbucks anymore because they're trying to bring in radical jihadis and pushing to implode our borders and globalism.
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:08.840]  I've told my assistant, please don't buy Starbucks coffee here at my house anymore.
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:13.840]  I said, just get a grinder. We'll grind the good coffee we sell. It's better. It's organic.
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:19.840]  And then I'll put it in the little Keurig machine. But again, the globalists promote things like the Keurig machine,
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:27.840]  you know, the little scissors where you put the little capsule in there because it's all about removing you from the raw material,
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:33.840]  removing you from processing yourself. It's like having these automatic can openers where a machine does it.
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:39.840]  We're being dehumanized. I'm not saying it's bad to automate some things. It's like wearing shoes or having a car.
[02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:45.840]  It's just that it's being designed as a Trojan horse to weaken us, to domesticate us.
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:50.840]  And the social engineers admit that. So the article is very, very important.
[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:58.840]  It goes over how all of this happens. And then they claim it's an accident. No, no, this isn't an accident.
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:02.840]  This arrangement is an unprecedented accident of history.
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:10.840]  The Post Office has long had illegal monopoly deliver first class mail on non-urgent letters.
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:16.840]  The exclusivity comes with a universal service obligation provided for all Americans at uniform price and quality.
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:22.840]  The communication service helps knit the vast country together and it's the Postal Service exists.
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:25.840]  It's how they exist. And then it just goes on explaining how this works.
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:31.840]  The point is it's one monopoly or oligopoly allowing another oligopoly to basically turn into a monopoly.
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:35.840]  And it's these big massive taxpayer back structures that allow this.
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:42.840]  And if you expand on that, look at health care. Undoubtedly, by the 1960s, the United States had the best health care in the world.
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:47.840]  Japanese royalty came here, British royalty came here, you know, the Saudi rich people came here.
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:50.840]  Everybody came here. National Health Service was being almost a nightmare.
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:54.840]  Canada systems a nightmare. Oh, no, no, no.
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:41:02.840]  And then as we put more and more government money in, just like education, it drove up the price and it destroyed basic competition.
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:09.840]  And now it's a huge bureaucratic nightmare with the big insurance companies and banks riding Obamacare bipartisanly to bankrupt smaller companies
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:13.840]  and bankrupt smaller health care companies that consolidate the market.
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:16.840]  And that's what Elizabeth Warren admits. It's what Ezekiel Emanuel admits.
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:24.840]  And that's what's frustrating is they admit it but act like blowing up competition and vertically integrating things as somehow socialist and loving and liberal
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:27.840]  when it's a bunch of mega corporations that run it.
[02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:36.840]  It's globalists that exploit China's slave labor that, of course, Walmart did first for decades and now is in decline because other people are imitating it.
[02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:39.840]  And it's the same thing. Now we have Amazon eating Walmart.
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:46.840]  So first Walmart ate Main Street. Now we see Amazon eating everything.
[02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:51.840]  So back to David Knight in the live transmission, the whole article, you know, gets into the basics of it.
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:42:00.840]  And you can claim it's, quote, an accident, but these big corporations use all these loopholes to their advantage and then try to shut the loopholes off to everybody else
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:07.840]  and pull up the ladders of success. That's what globalism is. It's great crime is it's pushing austerity on everybody.
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:10.840]  And Trump's great plus is he recognizes that is trying to fight it.
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:18.840]  He's certainly imperfect. But again, imagine if we had Hillary Clinton in there right now and imagine if they get back in power, what they're going to do, they're going to clamp down on everything.
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:25.840]  Back to David Knight, back to Leigh Ann McAdoo, back to Owen Schroder and others in the live studio infowars.com.
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:28.840]  Spread that link. It is an act of resistance.
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:34.840]  Seriously, folks are trying to shut us down and they can shut us down or weaken us or keep us from breaking through even more.
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:37.840]  You're next. We're all next. We're in this together.
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:39.840]  Alan Jones with infowars.com.
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:44.840]  If you're watching and listening to this transmission, you are the reason we're here and I salute you and thank you for all you've done.
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:48.840]  Please remember we have free shipping for the month of July.
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:54.840]  Our average package costs us over $7 a ship for the average weight and average package for priority.
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:43:00.840]  And so when we're selling something for $20, we're making $10 on it and then we do free shipping.
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:02.840]  We're making like three bucks.
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:09.840]  But I'm just absolutely giving the enemy a run for their money and we always have free shipping, $50 more.
[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:16.840]  We have 10% off and we sign up for auto ships. You can get stuff that you need to reorder like vitamins and minerals and supplements and coffee.
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:25.840]  But just please commit to supporting free market that also supports your freedoms and tirelessly fights infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com.
[02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:27.840]  You can also call and talk to a human.
[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:40.840]  We have triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. We have DNA force back in stock, 20% off. We have MycoZX, the amazing Paranime that completes the circle when it comes to probiotics.
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:42.840]  It knocks out the yeast and all the rest of the garbage.
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:44.840]  It's all available infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:49.840]  Be sure to get your CNN is fake news t-shirts on the back infowars.com.
[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:57.840]  It's real news, great way to meet people and spread the word and break the back of those censors. Again, back to David Knight and the rest of the amazing crew.
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:02.840]  And I'll be back live this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m. Central. Again, thank you all for the support.
[02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:07.840]  All right. I'm David Knight here with Owen Shroyer as Alex was just saying about Amazon.
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:13.840]  We look at these 21st century robber barons and one of the best examples of this, of course, is Jeff Bezos.
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:23.840]  When he's talking about what's going on with the post office, I remember, Owen, decades ago, 20 plus years ago, some of the people that were involved in the Libertarian Party were working for UPS.
[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:34.840]  And they were very upset about what was going on with the post office because the post office was using its monopoly on letters to subsidize competing with UPS and with Federal Express on packages.
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:44.840]  And on overnight delivery of, you know, the package of what made Federal Express popular was their overnight delivery of letters. UPS was focusing on parcels.
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:53.840]  And so the Postal Service was using its letter carrying stuff to subsidize those parcel deliveries. But then they got in trouble, as this article points out.
[02:44:53.840 --> 02:45:01.840]  In the early 2000s, emails started making snail mail go away. And so there, their protected monopoly started collapsing.
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:12.840]  And it got even harder for them because in 2006, Congress passed an act that made it unlawful for them to ship parcels at below cost.
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:17.840]  But as the article points out, that's very subjective. Who knows, because this stuff all flows together.
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:24.840]  How do you assess the cost of delivering a letter and delivering a parcel at the same time? The guy's going out there at the same time.
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:29.840]  How do you split the cost of one versus the other? So that gave them wiggle room.
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:38.840]  And that's what allows Amazon to come in and get a $1.46 subsidy off of this because they're big enough to take advantage of this in a way that other people can't.
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:49.840]  So you've got a government monopoly setting up a situation where one of these oligarchists can come in and they can take advantage of that in a way that the rest of us can't.
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:55.840]  That's the problem that we see being replicated over and over again in our economy. We're going to see it with transportation very soon.
[02:45:55.840 --> 02:46:05.840]  They're going to make it impossible for you to own a car because the urban planners and people want to enforce Agenda 21 or as they now call it, the 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainability.
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:14.840]  They don't want you to have the ability to move around independent of them. They want to own your transportation. Understand, this is full-on warfare.
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:20.840]  And if you're in warfare against the people, against their freedom, you have to control the movement, the transportation.
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:27.840]  So first thing, if you've got an invading army, the first thing they're going to do is come in and shut off the means of transportation.
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:32.840]  That's what they're going to be doing to us shortly. They always want to own everything.
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:39.840]  And when we look at what's happening with Jeff Bezos and the articles that have come out in the Drudge Report, many others today over this last week, people have said,
[02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:51.840]  Amazon is getting so big, I'm putting them on my sale list because I have seen that there are things working in Washington to essentially shut down what is rapidly becoming a monopoly.
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:58.840]  Nevertheless, Jeff Bezos is about to become the richest man in the world. He made $20 billion increase in his net worth.
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:10.840]  And Owen, as we're talking during the break, I said, that's equivalent. If you look at him buying the Washington Post because that's what he's thinking strategically. He understands there's going to be antitrust movements against him in Washington.
[02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:21.840]  He also understands that he wants to be able to deliver packages himself with his own drones. He's going to have to have government approval for that to give him an advantage over everybody else.
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:28.840]  He'll be allowed to use drones to deliver stuff, but you won't with your small business because you're not going to be able to pass the regulatory hurdles.
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:34.840]  He's going to make sure that that happens. He's also going to make sure that he has access to what he wants to do in space.
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:38.840]  An important part of that is to get politically involved with the Washington Post.
[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:43.840]  We've seen the Washington Post get very politicized after Jeff Bezos bought it. What did it cost him?
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:54.840]  Well, if we look at the kind of money that he's making and the amount of money that he paid for the Washington Post, $250 million sounds like a lot of money, except when we look at somebody who made $20 billion in just five months.
[02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:59.840]  Let's normalize that to somebody that is making $50,000, which is what the average American makes.
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:05.840]  That means that you could buy the Amazon, the Washington, the Amazon Post for $300.
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:13.840]  I mean, would you buy a paper that you could use to influence Washington for $300? Of course you would, and that's exactly what he's doing.
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:16.840]  That's the way this guy is playing the game. It's very, very dangerous.
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:21.840]  Well, not only that, you would also do it if you knew that some of the money of that $300 was coming from the government.
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:25.840]  If you were saying, I'm getting $150 of that from the government, 50%, well, heck yeah.
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:27.840]  And that is what they're trying to do.
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:35.840]  Bezos, Slim, Buffett, publicly pleading poverty, asked Congress for help with their newspapers.
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:40.840]  And this is a typical thing. I mean, you'll actually see this a lot in media companies that fail.
[02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:46.840]  They try to get government bailouts, and it usually is the richest people at the company that get these bailouts because they don't want to pay these bills.
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:52.840]  They don't want to make this bad business deal, but it's absurd that, again, as the story in The New York Sun points out,
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:57.840]  Bezos worth over $80 million, Slim worth over $60 billion, Buffett worth over $70 billion.
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:02.840]  That's what we know of. And these people want money from the government to save their failing businesses.
[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:04.840]  Excuse me, that's not how America works.
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:12.840]  And now it gets back to what you were talking about and how Amazon is now going to get this nice little kickback from the government, basically,
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:15.840]  with these parcels that they're going to be sending out.
[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:18.840]  Oh, they're getting it. They're getting it. They're able to take advantage of that.
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:21.840]  Well, it makes sense. You say, okay, well, of course, that makes sense for the private business owner.
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:24.840]  He's going to make more money. His business is going to be more successful.
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:26.840]  That makes sense for the government. The government's going to have some say.
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:31.840]  The government's going to have some control. They're going to have a little leverage in this situation, considering they're involved now.
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:34.840]  But you know what it doesn't make sense for? It doesn't make sense for America.
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:37.840]  It doesn't make sense for the consumer. It doesn't make sense for the republic.
[02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:41.840]  And that's the problem. Nobody is thinking about that when they're making these deals.
[02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:44.840]  They're thinking about the bottom line. And this is where government has gone wrong.
[02:49:44.840 --> 02:49:48.840]  You know, that was what the government was supposed to be here to do, to watch the anti-trust,
[02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:54.840]  to make sure that freedoms were being protected and that we still lived in a republic ruled by the Constitution.
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:56.840]  And that's just, the government's completely missed that.
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:50:00.840]  And this is the kind of same story when you hear these newspaper owners that just, like you said,
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:04.840]  they buy these newspapers for pennies on the dollar just for political influence.
[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:07.840]  That's it. Not even to make money. They don't need the money.
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:10.840]  You know, going back into the middle of the 1800s.
[02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:15.840]  It's just like, I just want to finish this. It's just like when you have a billionaire sports team owner
[02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:18.840]  asking taxpayers to pay for their stadiums.
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:20.840]  Oh yeah, they always get the subsidy.
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:21.840]  What?
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:26.840]  Yeah, so that we can watch the millionaires play ball, play a kid, a children's game.
[02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:29.840]  Yeah, so we give money to the billionaires to build their stadium,
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:31.840]  then we watch the millionaires play a child game.
[02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:36.840]  Hey, wait, I want you to pay to build the stadium and then pay to come and use it too.
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:39.840]  You know, libertarians have always fought this postal monopoly.
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:41.840]  We had Lysander Spinner look him up.
[02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:46.840]  He was the guy that brought the post office to its knees. They were charging outrageous fees.
[02:50:46.840 --> 02:50:49.840]  And he went into competition with them, got it as a fraction.
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:53.840]  And that's one of the ways that they put in to protect themselves, these monopoly laws.
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:51:22.840]  This will be right back.
[02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:35.840]  This is a toxic chemical biological gas smoke emergency while traveling at home or on your job.
[02:51:35.840 --> 02:51:37.840]  Are you protected? Are you prepared?
[02:51:37.840 --> 02:51:40.840]  There are over 400,000 fires in the USA every year.
[02:51:40.840 --> 02:51:43.840]  Up to 85% of all deaths on a fire are due to smoke inhalation.
[02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:46.840]  Three minutes without air and we as humans will die.
[02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:49.840]  Be prepared and escape safely with our safe escape smoke hoods,
[02:51:49.840 --> 02:51:52.840]  giving you up to 60 minutes of breathable air protection.

[02:54:18.840 --> 02:54:23.840]  We got an interesting story here about Mark Zuckerberg finally figuring out why Trump won.

[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:44.840]  Let's talk about Mark Zuckerberg and what he figured out.
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:47.840]  It's an interesting story from zero hedge, a little bit of sarcasm.
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:57.840]  They point out, as Zuckerberg apparently learned for the first time, while visiting oil workers in North Dakota, there are entire industries that exist outside of Silicon Valley.
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:04.840]  And you know what, those industries that are outside of Silicon Valley are some of the same industries that Obama and Hillary Clinton had said they were going to shut down.
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:07.840]  So he's starting to get an idea of why people voted for Trump.
[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:10.840]  This is what he wrote in his Facebook post when he talked to some of these people.
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:24.840]  He said he went to a town where there were tens of thousands of workers who had moved from all over the country to pursue new jobs in an industry where they could get, with just a high school diploma, they could get $100,000 a year working in the oil business.
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:31.840]  And when the Dakota Access Pipeline was approved, it removed a $6 to $7 per barrel cost of producing oil in the region.
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:33.840]  He said it brought more investment and jobs there.
[02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:35.840]  And this is the interesting thing.
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:39.840]  A number of people told me they had felt their livelihood was blocked by the government.
[02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:40.840]  No, really?
[02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:45.840]  You mean when Hillary Clinton said, and Obama said, we're going to bankrupt you if you do coal?
[02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:48.840]  They're going to bankrupt the country because that's what our energy is based on.
[02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:53.840]  But when Trump approved the pipeline, they felt a sense of hope again.
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:54.840]  Remember that word, hope?
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:57.840]  Remember how Barack Obama used it and he gave us a false hope?
[02:56:57.840 --> 02:56:59.840]  No, these people had a real hope.
[02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:09.840]  They said one person told me the night the pipeline was approved, people lit fireworks and they rode trucks with American flags up and down Main Street to celebrate.
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:12.840]  So there's the education of Zuckerberg.
[02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:19.840]  He finally went to fly over country and he talked to some people about why they voted and it didn't have anything to do with the Russians.
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:28.840]  It had to do with the Democrats who wanted to shut down their jobs, shut down our economies and they were sick and tired of it.
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:37.840]  You know, when you talk about the hope thing, the fake hope about Obama, it reminded me of how Michelle Obama came out after Trump got elected and said,
[02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:39.840]  well, I think now people aren't feeling hope.
[02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:40.840]  Now I don't feel hope.
[02:57:40.840 --> 02:57:43.840]  Michelle Obama is saying now there is no hope because Trump got elected.
[02:57:43.840 --> 02:57:50.840]  Well, again, another example of, well, she's probably just completely fake news or you could say out of touch with reality.
[02:57:50.840 --> 02:57:51.840]  This is hope.
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:53.840]  Trump is the real hope.
[02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:55.840]  Trump is the first time people actually had hope.
[02:57:55.840 --> 02:58:02.840]  And the people that bought in to the hope that Obama was selling, they realized he was a fraud.
[02:58:02.840 --> 02:58:04.840]  Now they're on the hope for Trump.
[02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:07.840]  And you know, there's nothing in here about racism.
[02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:17.840]  You know, people could go to the high school diploma, not even need that probably, but no matter what race you were, you could go there to get a job because the economy wasn't being shut down.
[02:58:17.840 --> 02:58:21.840]  That was opportunity for anybody regardless of what color they were.
[02:58:21.840 --> 02:58:22.840]  That is real hope.
[02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:23.840]  No, there's no hope.
[02:58:23.840 --> 02:58:24.840]  No, no hope, David.
[02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:26.840]  Just fireworks and American flags and celebrations.
[02:58:26.840 --> 02:58:29.840]  Sounds like there's no hope in an oil country here.
[02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:30.840]  Stay with us.
[02:58:30.840 --> 02:58:37.840]  We'll be right back and then Mike Sernovich is going to be taking over in the fourth hour.
[02:59:00.840 --> 02:59:04.840]  We know that the government has made changes to the climate.
[02:59:04.840 --> 02:59:13.840]  And we know that the climate deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family into the water.
[02:59:13.840 --> 02:59:17.840]  They took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:59:17.840 --> 02:59:27.840]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:59:27.840 --> 02:59:33.520]  gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning
[02:59:33.520 --> 02:59:37.560]  iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and
[02:59:37.560 --> 02:59:42.680]  the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock

[03:00:07.640 --> 03:00:17.240]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show. And now your host, David
[03:00:17.240 --> 03:00:23.160]  Knight. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here with Owen Schroyer.
[03:00:23.160 --> 03:00:30.240]  Let's take a moment and talk about this newest Clinton side. Somebody committing suicide who
[03:00:30.240 --> 03:00:35.520]  was involved in investigating the Clintons. This latest person is Peter W. Smith. He's
[03:00:35.520 --> 03:00:40.160]  a GOP operative. And, of course, the Chicago Tribune doesn't have a problem calling it
[03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:45.040]  suicide. But a lot of other people do. A congressman has a problem with it. A senior Wall Street
[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:49.560]  journal writer has a problem with it. These are people who were in contact with him. They're
[03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:54.920]  not buying it, and there are some very suspicious issues surrounding his death. He leaves a
[03:00:54.920 --> 03:00:59.480]  suicide note. First of all, he has a bag around his head with helium attached to it. That's
[03:00:59.480 --> 03:01:04.920]  bizarre to start with. It's all bizarre. Then he writes a note that says no foul play whatsoever.
[03:01:04.920 --> 03:01:09.480]  Long. There's nothing to see here. And says I'm taking my life because of a recent bad
[03:01:09.480 --> 03:01:15.440]  turn in health since January 2017. And I'm doing this now because my life insurance policy
[03:01:15.440 --> 03:01:20.320]  of $5 million is expiring. Well, he would know that if you commit suicide and if you
[03:01:20.320 --> 03:01:25.400]  leave a note saying that you're committing suicide, you're not going to get insurance
[03:01:25.400 --> 03:01:30.760]  on life insurance policy. So I mean, that is absolutely absurd. And the congressman, Ted
[03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:35.160]  Liu, says you don't need to be a prosecutor to know that someone writing no foul play
[03:01:35.160 --> 03:01:39.800]  whatsoever in connection with a death seems awfully suspicious. And the senior Wall Street
[03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:44.760]  journal writer, Shane Harris, also retweeted last night that there were no signs that Smith
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:49.240]  was about to commit suicide. He said, when I spoke to Peter Smith, I had no indication
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:52.960]  that he was ill or that he was planning to take his own life. As a matter of fact, one
[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:58.520]  of his former employees said he was there getting treatment. He was working to get well. And
[03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:02.640]  then he says, well, I'm going to take my life very much like what we saw with Aaron Schwartz,
[03:02:02.640 --> 03:02:07.640]  who supposedly committed suicide. And this is a guy who also was a fighter. He was fighting
[03:02:07.640 --> 03:02:14.200]  Syspa Acta Pippa. He was fighting everything there. He had turned down an offer to do just
[03:02:14.200 --> 03:02:21.280]  30 months from this prosecutor when they came under a lot of criticism for prosecuting him
[03:02:21.280 --> 03:02:24.440]  for a non-crime. And then all of a sudden he commits suicide.
[03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:31.160]  Yeah, it was Carmen Ortiz, a very corrupt judge in the Northeast that was in that case.
[03:02:31.160 --> 03:02:36.360]  You know, David, this is the Clintons, I think, getting more brazen or just the whole,
[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:39.560]  you know, you don't have to use Clinton's name. I mean, they can be associated with
[03:02:39.560 --> 03:02:43.880]  like a list of over 50 dead bodies now. So you call it the Clinton body count. But who
[03:02:43.880 --> 03:02:49.600]  knows what's really going on. But I think that, look, you've got Seth Rich, Barrington
[03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:57.000]  Wisenhunt Jr. and Sean Lucas, all potential witnesses in the DNC fraud lawsuit dead. And
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:03.960]  then you've got Peter Smith, who was heavily committed to finding the emails that Hillary
[03:03:03.960 --> 03:03:09.040]  Clinton deleted. He had two things that he was basically doing, trying to stay alive
[03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:14.200]  and trying to find Clinton's emails. Now, he had a long history of exposing the Clintons
[03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:17.240]  too. And I'm starting to wonder if maybe he hadn't
[03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:24.160]  found those emails, David. And that's why he's no longer with us. So it's very amazing
[03:03:24.160 --> 03:03:31.200]  to me that within Seth Rich was, I think, July 9th or July 6th last year. So you've
[03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:37.800]  got just over a year, just over a calendar year, four people associated with the Clintons
[03:03:37.800 --> 03:03:44.000]  in one way, shape, or form, mysteriously dead. Now, we have to understand, I'm not allowed
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:47.920]  to believe in coincidence here as a reporter. And so I don't believe there's a coincidence
[03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:52.520]  here. I think there's something going on. As Ron Wyden said, David, it doesn't pass
[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:53.520]  the Schmeltest.
[03:03:53.520 --> 03:03:57.480]  That's right. You had the DC madam come on and talk to Alex. And Alex says, you're
[03:03:57.480 --> 03:04:02.000]  not getting ready to commit suicide. No, no, no, I'm perfectly fine. I have no interest.
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:07.840]  Then she commits suicide. Or even the spy in the bag situation that they had in Britain.
[03:04:07.840 --> 03:04:13.720]  They have this guy who's working for MI5 and he's found zipped up in a bag in his bathtub
[03:04:13.720 --> 03:04:19.080]  dead after he went missing for a few days. It was so ridiculous that people say, oh,
[03:04:19.080 --> 03:04:23.120]  he committed suicide and zipped himself up in the bag and everybody was laughing at it.
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:29.640]  So they hired a contortionist who was small, who put himself in a bag in a professional.
[03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:33.520]  Okay, fine. Let's see you do that without leaving any fingerprints on the zipper or
[03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:38.920]  the outside of the bag. Don't forget Vince Foster. And I believe, Bill Clinton fired
[03:04:38.920 --> 03:04:44.200]  the FBI director the day before Vince Foster's death. I mean, these people, I'm sorry, David.
[03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:47.720]  It takes everything I can not to just rip this desk out of its mouth right now. These
[03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:48.720]  people are sick.
[03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:52.880]  All right, stay with us. We'll be right back. And sort of it should be taking the helm
[03:04:52.880 --> 03:05:01.280]  for the fourth hour. We'll be right back.
[03:05:01.280 --> 03:05:06.360]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com
[03:05:06.360 --> 03:05:10.160]  is writing about it. But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and
[03:05:10.160 --> 03:05:15.080]  eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia
[03:05:15.080 --> 03:05:20.360]  vision of preparedness. Well, the ants may have the last laugh on the grasshoppers, but
[03:05:20.360 --> 03:05:24.160]  the grasshoppers will still sing the tune if they can make money. But maybe you don't
[03:05:24.160 --> 03:05:27.880]  have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home
[03:05:27.880 --> 03:05:33.040]  theater into a radiation proof bunker. There are still very effective low tech, low cost
[03:05:33.040 --> 03:05:37.560]  things you can do to prepare. In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare
[03:05:37.560 --> 03:05:42.600]  and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival. Things
[03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:47.560]  that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb
[03:05:47.560 --> 03:05:51.960]  an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion. Prepare for the worst case
[03:05:51.960 --> 03:05:57.080]  scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best case scenario. Get more

[03:06:02.080 --> 03:06:06.000]  The reason InfoWars Life has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want

[03:06:21.400 --> 03:06:26.120]  a noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that
[03:06:26.120 --> 03:06:30.840]  was life changing for me. Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female. I had
[03:06:30.840 --> 03:06:36.800]  a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very
[03:06:36.800 --> 03:06:43.200]  exciting, feeling great, looking good. And I know my hair is luxurious once again. So
[03:06:43.200 --> 03:06:46.040]  obviously a super female is amazing. I love it.
[03:06:46.040 --> 03:06:50.880]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say
[03:06:50.880 --> 03:06:55.760]  is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2. It's got

[03:08:22.320 --> 03:08:27.440]  We have a great hilarious Megyn Kelly video we're going to watch in a minute. We have
[03:08:27.440 --> 03:08:32.280]  a crooked poster in the background for a movie I did. I got to fix that. But breaking news
[03:08:32.280 --> 03:08:38.440]  right now, CNN is upset. I'm looking at the article right now. Trump Jr.'s Russia meeting
[03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:43.960]  a Democratic plot. Pro-Trump media wants you to think so. CNN just published this article
[03:08:43.960 --> 03:08:47.720]  a couple of minutes ago and they called me and asked me for comment a couple of days
[03:08:47.720 --> 03:08:52.920]  ago for the article. So what we're seeing now in the mainstream media, they wanted to
[03:08:52.920 --> 03:08:59.640]  create this meeting that Don Jr. had with a publicist and someone else who misrepresented
[03:08:59.640 --> 03:09:05.080]  who she was. They wanted to make it into a big conspiracy theory. Oh, this is proof
[03:09:05.080 --> 03:09:10.080]  that there's collusion because one time somebody had a five or 10-minute meeting with somebody
[03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:15.120]  from Russia. Therefore, it must be collusion. Well, as it turns out, one of the investigative
[03:09:15.120 --> 03:09:20.840]  journalists with Sernovich Media, relying of course on poll and Reddit and other crowdsourced
[03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:26.760]  people, was able to find out that this person actually had a lot of connections with John
[03:09:26.760 --> 03:09:31.600]  McCain, that this so-called Russian lawyer was a pro-Hillary person. So what they're
[03:09:31.600 --> 03:09:35.000]  saying now, and I'm going to read directly from the article because it really just goes
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:41.480]  to show how frustrated the media is, the theory is based on bits of fact that have been taken
[03:09:41.480 --> 03:09:47.960]  out of context or spun in misleading ways to paint a picture that the president and
[03:09:47.960 --> 03:09:52.960]  supporters prefer to the one currently dominating much of the media. So they're projecting
[03:09:52.960 --> 03:09:58.040]  onto us. They're saying the theory that we offer is based on bits of fact that have been
[03:09:58.040 --> 03:10:03.760]  taken out of context or spun. That sounds like the mainstream media every day. They're
[03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:08.240]  the one who takes things out of context. So to illustrate that, we have a really funny
[03:10:08.240 --> 03:10:14.640]  video for you. I thought that Alex was done with Megyn Kelly. I feel so bad for her, but
[03:10:14.640 --> 03:10:21.040]  we'll have a little bit of fun with her. Can you selectively edit a video by Megyn Kelly
[03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:25.200]  to make it look like Megyn Kelly has done a hip, or has done actually a puff piece of
[03:10:25.200 --> 03:10:30.040]  Alex Jones. So we edited it and we're going to play that video for you right now.
[03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:36.480]  Alex Jones isn't going away. Over the years, his YouTube channel has racked up 1.3 billion
[03:10:36.480 --> 03:10:43.160]  views. He has millions of listeners and the ear of our current president. We're going
[03:10:43.160 --> 03:10:48.000]  to get to work immediately for the American people. With the election of Donald Trump,
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:55.560]  Alex Jones has plans to expand info wars, more studios, more shows, more employees,
[03:10:55.560 --> 03:11:00.320]  more influence. You have said that it's surreal to say something on info wars and then hear
[03:11:00.320 --> 03:11:04.240]  it come out of the president of the United States mouth a couple days later. I mean,
[03:11:04.240 --> 03:11:09.800]  that has happened, but. Do you think he's watching? I mean, I know Trump watches and
[03:11:09.800 --> 03:11:16.080]  sees the clips and things. In December, 2015, Mr. Trump appeared on Jones's radio program,
[03:11:16.080 --> 03:11:22.680]  offering praise and promises. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed,
[03:11:22.680 --> 03:11:28.560]  I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot. The 2016 campaign was good for info wars.
[03:11:28.560 --> 03:11:35.000]  His YouTube monthly views reached 83 million in November, 2016. And when Mr. Trump won,
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:39.760]  Alex Jones found himself with access to the seat of power. What is it? Do you think about
[03:11:39.760 --> 03:11:45.040]  Alex Jones that President Trump finds so amazing? I don't want to get into all that.
[03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:49.960]  Jones speaks to his listeners for hours a day, six days a week. He went into business
[03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:56.520]  for himself, founding info wars in 1999. Many doubted his prospects, but he's now worth
[03:11:56.520 --> 03:12:04.160]  millions. Jones uses that money to spread his message. Tom Brokaw joins us. Alex Jones,
[03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:09.800]  a father, a grandfather, a citizen. When the internet first arrived like everyone else,
[03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:15.800]  I was bedazzled by his possibilities for good. And those qualities have only become so much
[03:12:15.800 --> 03:12:22.160]  more effective and pervasive. The war has just begun. So this is a, we just got a beach
[03:12:22.160 --> 03:12:28.720]  bed. And so that's just a start of the war for me. And Alex Jones goes into battle with
[03:12:28.720 --> 03:12:38.600]  a powerful ally. That pattern is classic. Alex Jones. Gorgeous.
[03:12:38.600 --> 03:12:50.120]  So as you can see, as you can see, that was actually a fan video that was sent to me.
[03:12:50.120 --> 03:12:59.160]  And his profile was Ricky Jerkface. He sent that in. That's an example of selective editing.
[03:12:59.160 --> 03:13:03.040]  So we would take, not we, it was given to me, so I'm not going to take credit for another
[03:13:03.040 --> 03:13:09.120]  person's work. This was again sent to me by Ricky Jerkface. Hilarious. But it illustrates
[03:13:09.120 --> 03:13:13.600]  that you can take any video footage you want and edit it to say whatever you want. That's
[03:13:13.600 --> 03:13:20.000]  why you can't trust edited TV. So if we showed that video, we would say Megan Kelly is praising
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:25.240]  Alex Jones. What an amazing puff piece on him. How can you get publicity like that from
[03:13:25.240 --> 03:13:30.760]  the mainstream media? Well, all they did was they spliced things together. So as you know,
[03:13:30.760 --> 03:13:35.840]  if you watch the Megan Kelly interview, it was a complete and total hit job the entire
[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:41.840]  time. But when you cut, you can cut things together, splice things together. Drew, you
[03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:46.600]  know, was showing that the, you know, some of the questions were eight minutes away from
[03:13:46.600 --> 03:13:51.800]  other answers. You can do that with any kind of video. And that is why you cannot trust
[03:13:51.800 --> 03:13:55.440]  edited video from the mainstream media. And that is why, too, of course, if you're doing
[03:13:55.440 --> 03:13:59.760]  interviews with the mainstream media, you have to record them. Because if you don't
[03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:04.480]  record them, they can make you out to be any kind of monster they want. Just as in that
[03:14:04.480 --> 03:14:09.720]  great video, you can see that Megan Kelly did a special apparently showing that Alex
[03:14:09.720 --> 03:14:15.760]  Jones was just a great man. Tom Rather, who or Tom Brocar, whatever his name is, even
[03:14:15.760 --> 03:14:22.240]  comes out Alex Jones, a great family and father, the music sets the tone. There's all that
[03:14:22.240 --> 03:14:27.800]  video editing. You can't trust the mainstream media anymore because they edit all their
[03:14:27.800 --> 03:14:32.800]  videos, everything that they and you see that they don't trust it. Because whenever James
[03:14:32.800 --> 03:14:37.240]  O'Keeffe releases a video, suddenly the media goes, Oh my God, how can you trust the edited
[03:14:37.240 --> 03:14:42.680]  videos from James O'Keeffe? How can we trust edited video from the fake news media Katie
[03:14:42.680 --> 03:14:48.360]  Tour? I believe it was a correct me if I'm wrong. But one of these big anchors selectively
[03:14:48.360 --> 03:14:54.440]  edited a documentary involving gun owners. And they had to I don't think it was. It was
[03:14:54.440 --> 03:14:59.360]  a very famous anchor. I don't want to unlike the fake news media. I don't make accusations
[03:14:59.360 --> 03:15:04.560]  unless I know for sure who the right person is. But they definitely Katie, Katie Kirk,
[03:15:04.560 --> 03:15:09.720]  rather, had selectively edited footage to make gun owners look bad. See me, unlike the
[03:15:09.720 --> 03:15:14.560]  fake news media, I want to fact check in real time. This is the power of live TV as I would
[03:15:14.560 --> 03:15:19.800]  just say, Hey, oh wait, I got the last name wrong. It was Katie Kirk. Let's correct ourselves.
[03:15:19.800 --> 03:15:25.840]  The fake news media, they never do that. What they do is they issue a nasty article or nasty
[03:15:25.840 --> 03:15:31.720]  video on you. It goes viral. It's read perhaps by hundreds of thousands of people. And then
[03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:36.080]  three or four days later when everybody's moved on, they go oopsie, oopsie, we'll put
[03:15:36.080 --> 03:15:42.520]  a correction all the way at the very bottom of the paragraph after it isn't live anymore.
[03:15:42.520 --> 03:15:46.600]  But real media, real journalism like on info wars and like you get from Alex and Owen and
[03:15:46.600 --> 03:15:51.560]  David and me and somebody others on the on the program right away in real time. We're
[03:15:51.560 --> 03:15:54.800]  always like, let's make sure we get it right. Let's make sure we get the story right. We
[03:15:54.800 --> 03:15:59.520]  don't want to spread fake news like CNN. We don't want to spread fake news like the New
[03:15:59.520 --> 03:16:03.720]  York Times and the Washington Post and CNN firing people only because they're threatened
[03:16:03.720 --> 03:16:09.240]  by lawsuits. You know, we definitely want to get it right. And that is why we go live
[03:16:09.240 --> 03:16:14.560]  all the time right now. I'm live. Can't fake this. You can't fake the way I feel the way
[03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:18.480]  I look the way I act the way I talk. There's no hair, you know, hair and makeup crew cutting
[03:16:18.480 --> 03:16:23.760]  everything together. When I interviewed somebody, you can't take one question over here and
[03:16:23.760 --> 03:16:28.640]  one answer over there and splice them together from unrelated parts of the conversation. It's
[03:16:28.640 --> 03:16:33.600]  all and that is why the fake news media is terrified of us and why they want to take
[03:16:33.600 --> 03:16:38.200]  us down. And because CNN again, they just published that article one minute before we
[03:16:38.200 --> 03:16:42.960]  went live. So I don't, I don't even think it's been loaded yet in the production. They
[03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:48.160]  are freaking out. They want to create the fake news narrative about conspiracy theories
[03:16:48.160 --> 03:16:53.680]  involving Russia. And then we can create these videos and these responses that are actually
[03:16:53.680 --> 03:16:59.600]  more factual and more truthful and more compelling. They get read by millions more people. And
[03:16:59.600 --> 03:17:04.400]  then we take them out. And that's of course why they want debate too. And they won't ever
[03:17:04.400 --> 03:17:08.280]  admit with the wrong. I'll give you a great example. I said this, I had came up with this
[03:17:08.280 --> 03:17:12.160]  idea. I was talking to Alex. I think it was last Friday. Brian Stelter has still ignored
[03:17:12.160 --> 03:17:17.960]  me. Brian Stelter works at CNN. He has a show called unreliable sources. And what he does
[03:17:17.960 --> 03:17:25.960]  is goes and says that it's so tough to be a journalist. Oh my God. CNN. This is terrible.
[03:17:25.960 --> 03:17:30.520]  News are unsafe. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, crying all day. Adult, adult men
[03:17:30.520 --> 03:17:35.800]  and adult women crying because people call them mean names. They've actually never had
[03:17:35.800 --> 03:17:39.080]  a real job before, obviously. I've always worked, working customer services is what
[03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:42.720]  I always tell people. And then you can tell me how tough your pressure little job is in
[03:17:42.720 --> 03:17:48.560]  the media. But I told Brian Stelter, I will donate $100,000. And this is a sincere offer.
[03:17:48.560 --> 03:17:53.400]  I would donate $100,000 to whatever charity he selects. If he will go into New York and
[03:17:53.400 --> 03:18:00.120]  wear a MAGA hat, make America a gradient hat with the GoPro, right? And just walk around.
[03:18:00.120 --> 03:18:05.200]  If you think it's so dangerous to be in CNN, I'll go wear a CNN hat. I'll go into New York
[03:18:05.200 --> 03:18:09.320]  and anywhere Brian wants. I'll walk right next to him and I'll wear a CNN hat. And he
[03:18:09.320 --> 03:18:14.040]  can wear a Trump hat, a make America a gradient hat. And then he can see what really happens
[03:18:14.040 --> 03:18:20.160]  and film it. 100,000 for charity. Story went viral. It's been covered by IGR.com. It's
[03:18:20.160 --> 03:18:23.800]  been covered all over the internet. Video is crazy. He's ignoring it. Brian wants to
[03:18:23.800 --> 03:18:29.680]  pretend like the offer wasn't even made. That's how fake they are. They get on camera and
[03:18:29.680 --> 03:18:35.600]  say, Oh my God, journalism is under attack. Journalists are under attack. What about Trump
[03:18:35.600 --> 03:18:40.960]  supporters? Why will the fake news media not cover violence against Trump supporters, violence
[03:18:40.960 --> 03:18:45.480]  against female Trump supporters, violence against male Trump supporters, old ones, elderly
[03:18:45.480 --> 03:18:49.760]  people? There was a picture once. It was probably the most appalling thing I've seen on the
[03:18:49.760 --> 03:18:56.720]  internet other than gore and all that really nasty stuff. But I mean, nasty in the depraved
[03:18:56.720 --> 03:19:03.040]  sociopathic sense. A liberal, quote, journalist, verified Twitter account, saw a picture of
[03:19:03.040 --> 03:19:08.400]  a 70 year old man who'd been knocked unconscious and pepper sprayed by Antifa and the man had
[03:19:08.400 --> 03:19:15.160]  done nothing wrong. He tweeted out, this is what happens when you think real life is like
[03:19:15.160 --> 03:19:21.000]  Twitter. And I thought to myself, a 70 year old man is not doing, this is how, yeah, exactly.
[03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:25.480]  This is how depraved these people are that you can be a 70 year old man, a 70 year old
[03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:30.520]  woman. It doesn't matter. You're fair game. You're, you're a target merely because you
[03:19:30.520 --> 03:19:35.280]  have a make America great again hat. But the Brian Svelter and all these people want to
[03:19:35.280 --> 03:19:40.160]  cry all day about how hard it is to be a journalist. And in the next segment, I'm getting to more
[03:19:40.160 --> 03:19:43.760]  of that because there's a couple more hip pieces on me that are coming that are actually
[03:19:43.760 --> 03:19:49.200]  interesting and it's going to show you, I like to take you behind the scenes journalism
[03:19:49.200 --> 03:19:54.080]  on journalism to not just tell you whatever story they're telling you, but how do these

[03:24:25.760 --> 03:24:30.720]  Making tears or whatever you want to call it from Brian Stelter of Unreliable Sources.
[03:24:30.720 --> 03:24:36.000]  So let's call this segment, How to Kill. Well, I don't want to use the word kill, even though
[03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:40.920]  the Washington Post said how to kill Fox and Friends. So apparently, you have to be real
[03:24:40.920 --> 03:24:46.280]  careful. Tipsy tour around journalists, whatever you say. But if you're the Washington Post,
[03:24:46.280 --> 03:24:52.160]  you can write an article called How to Kill Fox and Friends. That's OK. But if we use
[03:24:52.160 --> 03:24:55.800]  any kind of language at all, we're trying to incite violence or whatever.
[03:24:55.800 --> 03:25:00.840]  So let's just call this segment, How to Beat Alex Jones. How to Beat Mike Cernovich. How
[03:25:00.840 --> 03:25:05.560]  could CNN do that? I'll tell you why. There's a big reveal. It won't surprise the people
[03:25:05.560 --> 03:25:11.000]  listening in here. But Brian Stelter apparently talked to somebody in Iowa, and the person
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:14.920]  sent a message to him and said, I just thought you might want to know conservative friends
[03:25:14.920 --> 03:25:20.480]  here in Iowa are very angry at the media. They think the Trump-Russian deal is a coup
[03:25:20.480 --> 03:25:25.280]  attempt by the media and don't think there's anything to the Russia-Trump emails. They
[03:25:25.280 --> 03:25:29.880]  don't understand why the media is trying to oust our duly elected president. They think
[03:25:29.880 --> 03:25:34.800]  there's a double standard. Why isn't anyone investigating the Clinton campaign's Russia
[03:25:34.800 --> 03:25:41.520]  connections? They are standing firm behind Trump. The double standard is really the crucial
[03:25:41.520 --> 03:25:46.720]  language here, something I talk about all the time. The reason people like me are rising,
[03:25:46.720 --> 03:25:50.920]  the people like Alex, who was already big, who I didn't think Alex Jones, he's so big,
[03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:54.480]  I didn't think, how do you become more of a superstar than Alex was, right? But he's
[03:25:54.480 --> 03:26:00.280]  become even more a stratospheric rise. Hard to believe. I'll tell you why. People are
[03:26:00.280 --> 03:26:05.000]  tired of the double standards. If CNN wants to beat info wars, it wants to be me or wants
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:09.400]  to be alternative media, why don't they just tell the truth? Why don't they tell the truth
[03:26:09.400 --> 03:26:14.840]  about violence against Trump supporters? Why don't they tell the truth that it isn't hate
[03:26:14.840 --> 03:26:19.160]  crimes being committed by Trump supporters? Those are all hoaxes. Those, you know, the
[03:26:19.160 --> 03:26:23.040]  swastikas and everything, they're painted backwards. There was a poop swastika. That
[03:26:23.040 --> 03:26:28.040]  was fake. There was a recent settlement with the man who had been falsely accused of rape
[03:26:28.040 --> 03:26:33.440]  by mattress girl, Columbia University, ruin the guy's life. He sued Columbia University.
[03:26:33.440 --> 03:26:38.360]  Got a settlement offer there. Why doesn't the media just tell the truth? Why do they
[03:26:38.360 --> 03:26:41.680]  consistently apply double standards? Because I've talked to people from CNN. I'm friendly
[03:26:41.680 --> 03:26:48.640]  with some people who are at the network. And I told them, I go, look, if I turn on CNN,
[03:26:48.640 --> 03:26:55.040]  where can I watch a special on violence against Trump supporters? Where can I watch a special
[03:26:55.040 --> 03:27:01.240]  on the Clinton won uranium deal? Where can I watch a special about how Ukrainian oligarchs,
[03:27:01.240 --> 03:27:07.640]  billionaires, pay people to go on to the media like Doug Shown. They pay him, you know, 20,
[03:27:07.640 --> 03:27:12.440]  $40,000 a month to go on and agitate for war against Russia. And then none of the news
[03:27:12.440 --> 03:27:18.400]  outlets disclose it. Where can I hear people being held to the same standard? And the reason
[03:27:18.400 --> 03:27:24.360]  that double standard line stood up for me is I had a very, at first heated, but then
[03:27:24.360 --> 03:27:27.480]  it became a more sensible conversation. We'll see what the story looks like. A hit piece
[03:27:27.480 --> 03:27:34.760]  of planning on me at the Columbia Journalism Review. And he goes, Mike, you wrote this
[03:27:34.760 --> 03:27:39.840]  article on Andrew Kaczynski. And because you wrote the article, people are saying mean
[03:27:39.840 --> 03:27:45.680]  tweets about him. Do you feel that you're responsible for what people say to Andrew
[03:27:45.680 --> 03:27:52.600]  Kaczynski because you do journalism? And I go, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. So journalists
[03:27:52.600 --> 03:27:57.720]  are responsible for if people read your coverage, journalists are not responsible for what anybody
[03:27:57.720 --> 03:28:01.680]  does if my coverage is true. I asked him, I said, when have you asked that question
[03:28:01.680 --> 03:28:06.560]  of a liberal reporter? When have you asked somebody who works at CNN? Hey, you work at
[03:28:06.560 --> 03:28:13.480]  CNN and you wrote an article about this guy and he lost his job. Is that responsible?
[03:28:13.480 --> 03:28:19.960]  Can you do that? Is that ethical? They'll never do that. But on me, they want to apply
[03:28:19.960 --> 03:28:26.040]  a double standard. On me, they want to say, well, Cernovich wrote an article about Andrew
[03:28:26.040 --> 03:28:32.000]  Kaczynski, even though I told the truth that he had led a hate mob against Justin Saka
[03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:37.200]  who received a lot of rape threats. Sam Biddle of Gawker, well, Gawker doesn't exist anymore.
[03:28:37.200 --> 03:28:42.120]  Sam Biddle, who's a loser blogger at Gawker and Andrew Kaczynski, who was in a Buzzfeed,
[03:28:42.120 --> 03:28:47.000]  created that whole online shaming hate mob against Justin Saka, a private citizen who
[03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:51.680]  made a dumb ironic joke that was taken out of context. The life was ruined. Well, why
[03:28:51.680 --> 03:28:56.680]  don't people ask him, hey, Andrew, do you feel bad, bro? You feel bad that you dug
[03:28:56.680 --> 03:29:03.480]  up some tweet and you took it out of context and you made a private citizen world famous?
[03:29:03.480 --> 03:29:07.640]  Does that make you feel guilty? You ruined a person's life? You let a harassment mob?
[03:29:07.640 --> 03:29:13.120]  Did you feel bad about that? Hey, Andrew, do you feel bad that you falsely accused
[03:29:13.120 --> 03:29:21.480]  a man of being a suspect of the Boston bombing? Do you feel bad, Andrew, that when the family
[03:29:21.480 --> 03:29:26.720]  was trying to find their son who had been lost and ultimately committed suicide, do
[03:29:26.720 --> 03:29:33.680]  you feel bad that you trudged up things that were untrue and that's what the family had
[03:29:33.680 --> 03:29:39.640]  to see? Do you feel bad? Why will Columbia Journalism Review not do an article on fake
[03:29:39.640 --> 03:29:45.960]  news, the K-File spread, or the hate mob that he spread? The double standard is unacceptable.
[03:29:45.960 --> 03:29:50.360]  We're not going to stand for it. We're going to keep fighting back. Talk to you soon.
[03:29:50.360 --> 03:29:57.560]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:57.560 --> 03:30:04.440]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady a course
[03:30:04.440 --> 03:30:09.320]  as to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit. By consolidation of power first and
[03:30:09.320 --> 03:30:13.240]  in corruption it's necessary consequence. Jefferson was warning us about the global
[03:30:13.240 --> 03:30:17.720]  elite, the 1% of the 1%, consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's
[03:30:17.720 --> 03:30:22.440]  voice in government. Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice. We now live in a neo-feudalistic
[03:30:22.440 --> 03:30:26.120]  society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs
[03:30:26.120 --> 03:30:29.760]  of the establishment. Political office no longer represents the voice of the people,
[03:30:29.760 --> 03:30:35.000]  but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[03:30:35.000 --> 03:30:38.480]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed
[03:30:38.480 --> 03:30:42.040]  by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the
[03:30:42.040 --> 03:30:46.320]  world. We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against
[03:30:46.320 --> 03:30:50.880]  the other, conservative vs liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[03:30:50.880 --> 03:30:55.080]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions
[03:30:55.080 --> 03:30:59.040]  of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day. This is Kit Daniels

[03:32:02.400 --> 03:32:07.520]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the
[03:32:07.520 --> 03:32:13.920]  drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:32:13.920 --> 03:32:20.080]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[03:32:20.080 --> 03:32:25.640]  of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for
[03:32:25.640 --> 03:32:30.960]  quiet war. Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that
[03:32:30.960 --> 03:32:36.600]  destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.

[03:33:06.160 --> 03:33:23.800]  A few thoughts now on what is arguably the most politically corrupt department in the
[03:33:23.800 --> 03:33:29.920]  history of the American government. I'm speaking, of course, of the Obama Justice Department
[03:33:29.920 --> 03:33:36.200]  led by two attorneys general, Eric Holder, who ultimately became the first sitting cabinet
[03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:42.480]  officer ever to be cited for contempt of Congress, and his successor who is working
[03:33:42.480 --> 03:33:49.480]  on matching his record, Loretta Lynch. Gee, according to the Fire Director of the FBI,
[03:33:49.480 --> 03:33:54.960]  obstructed justice in ordering James Comey to refer to the Clinton email investigation
[03:33:54.960 --> 03:34:01.640]  as a matter rather than an investigation for the purpose of allowing the Clinton campaign
[03:34:01.640 --> 03:34:08.520]  to deny the Democratic nominee was under federal investigation. Today, we learned of the prospect
[03:34:08.520 --> 03:34:14.400]  of additional corruption on the part of the Obama Justice Department at issue why Attorney
[03:34:14.400 --> 03:34:20.640]  General Lynch went to almost unprecedented lengths to permit a Russian attorney to enter
[03:34:20.640 --> 03:34:28.040]  the country without a visa. Long before meeting, Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner, not the
[03:34:28.040 --> 03:34:34.360]  first scandal to plague that agency, of course, this meeting took place on June 9th of last
[03:34:34.360 --> 03:34:41.280]  year. But it is unclear now not only why A.G. Lynch would have given her an extraordinary
[03:34:41.280 --> 03:34:46.520]  way review of immigration laws, but how that Russian attorney could have been in the country
[03:34:46.520 --> 03:34:54.600]  some five months after the expiration of that so-called immigration parole waiver. The Senate
[03:34:54.600 --> 03:35:00.200]  Judiciary Committee is now investigating Lynch's efforts to protect Hillary Clinton and the
[03:35:00.200 --> 03:35:06.760]  role of not only A.G. Lynch, but the fired FBI director as well. There is much to learn
[03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:13.400]  about the collusion between the Russian attorney and the Obama administration. But the political
[03:35:13.400 --> 03:35:20.480]  motivations of the Obama Department of Justice are readily recognized. It is all, all about
[03:35:20.480 --> 03:35:27.320]  partisan politics. In fact, of the more than $400,000 in donations to Clinton and Trump
[03:35:27.320 --> 03:35:37.360]  during the election from DOJ employees, 97% of their money went to Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:37.360 --> 03:35:42.120]  Lou Dobbs is great. He's one of the best journalists working today, the best commentators working
[03:35:42.120 --> 03:35:46.440]  today. And that's the kind of information that you're going to rarely find. And that's
[03:35:46.440 --> 03:35:50.640]  of course what people attack Lou Dobbs so much, even though he has an impeccable track
[03:35:50.640 --> 03:35:57.320]  record. There's so much corruption in the Department of Justice that Jason Chavez from
[03:35:57.320 --> 03:36:02.360]  the House of Representatives actually replied to Trump's Twitter and said, why are you not,
[03:36:02.360 --> 03:36:07.080]  why is your Department of Justice not prosecuting people? This was an amazing thing. I don't
[03:36:07.080 --> 03:36:10.600]  think there's ever been anything like this in the history of the world. Trump had tweeted
[03:36:10.600 --> 03:36:15.960]  out something about Hillary Clinton. And Chavez said, well, why don't you just prosecute
[03:36:15.960 --> 03:36:20.800]  him? Well, I'll tell you why, because I have inside sources at the highest level of DOJ.
[03:36:20.800 --> 03:36:26.280]  You can't hire anybody. If you try to hire anybody who actually wants to hold the Hillary
[03:36:26.280 --> 03:36:30.960]  Clinton's, the Clinton family accountable under the law, you'll never get a job. But
[03:36:30.960 --> 03:36:36.880]  look at how many people the special prosecutor Mueller has hired. Why is it that the special
[03:36:36.880 --> 03:36:42.480]  prosecutor whose job is to conduct a witch hunt on a low level government employees?
[03:36:42.480 --> 03:36:46.000]  Why is he hiring new people all the time? Taxpayers, we're going to have to pay that. We're going
[03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:51.080]  to have to pay that bill. Why is Fox News and CNN and Washington Post and New York Times
[03:36:51.080 --> 03:36:55.760]  not talking about how much that's going to cost taxpayers? Ken Starr built something
[03:36:55.760 --> 03:37:00.560]  around $50 million to investigate Bill Clinton. And again, Bill Clinton is a bad guy. I'm
[03:37:00.560 --> 03:37:05.520]  not going to be here to defend Bill Clinton. But what they got Bill Clinton for and impeached
[03:37:05.520 --> 03:37:12.600]  him for wasn't even the subject of the investigation. It was a completely unrelated matter, $50 million.
[03:37:12.600 --> 03:37:16.960]  He asked me $50 million in taxpayer money for that kind of sideshow might not be the
[03:37:16.960 --> 03:37:20.600]  best use of our money. So how many hundreds of millions, because think about how much,
[03:37:20.600 --> 03:37:24.200]  and they liked Clinton. So imagine how many hundreds of millions of dollars they're going
[03:37:24.200 --> 03:37:31.080]  to spend to go after Trump. And more importantly, low level employees. Nobody wants to talk
[03:37:31.080 --> 03:37:34.680]  about that, how much that's going to cost. Nobody wants to talk about why the Department
[03:37:34.680 --> 03:37:42.480]  of Justice cannot hire competent people, because Johnny DeStefano, who's had a personnel and
[03:37:42.480 --> 03:37:48.080]  had a hiring kills anything, the running joke now in the White House. And this is serious.
[03:37:48.080 --> 03:37:53.160]  This is what people say. This isn't me thinking, oh, this is funny. They go, the only way to
[03:37:53.160 --> 03:37:58.120]  get hired, the Department of Justice with the White House is to have tweeted, never
[03:37:58.120 --> 03:38:03.920]  Trump. This is the reality. Rent previous chief of staff. Why is he allowing this? Johnny
[03:38:03.920 --> 03:38:09.400]  DeStefano, why hasn't he been fired? Why is the Department of Justice not hiring prosecutors
[03:38:09.400 --> 03:38:14.440]  to go after them? James Comey, you'll remember, there was a great article I think they called
[03:38:14.440 --> 03:38:21.520]  him Clinton's bag man. That was Comey. Comey cleared her in any kind of investigation that
[03:38:21.520 --> 03:38:27.080]  ever came up in her life or Bill's life. He completely cleared her Loretta Lynch. Why
[03:38:27.080 --> 03:38:33.600]  isn't she in prison? Susan Rice, why hasn't she been prosecuted for violating the law
[03:38:33.600 --> 03:38:38.560]  for spying on American citizens? None of that. In fact, the media wants to pretend that Susan
[03:38:38.560 --> 03:38:46.280]  Rice doesn't exist. Remember, Susan Rice said, I didn't unmask anybody. PBS goes, okay, then
[03:38:46.280 --> 03:38:50.920]  she got busted. And then everybody had her on the next day and they didn't even ask her,
[03:38:50.920 --> 03:38:55.840]  hey, lie to her face. There was no outrage and outcry in the media about how Susan Rice
[03:38:55.840 --> 03:39:00.840]  had lied to them. They didn't say, oh, this is alternative facts. And Susan Rice was spreading
[03:39:00.840 --> 03:39:05.840]  alternative facts. No, they want to pretend like it didn't happen. And then of course,
[03:39:05.840 --> 03:39:11.360]  the media narrative turns to, oh, people don't like Susan Rice because she's a woman. Oh,
[03:39:11.360 --> 03:39:18.560]  she's a victim now. So I love this how the, I love how these powerful people, people of
[03:39:18.560 --> 03:39:23.440]  the highest level of government are victims now. Foreign policy, for example, did the
[03:39:23.440 --> 03:39:27.520]  same thing with me. They wrote an article about me and they quoted people who had been
[03:39:27.520 --> 03:39:32.120]  at the CIA for three decades. Alex and I talked about this, I think Monday. And they made
[03:39:32.120 --> 03:39:38.680]  me out to be a bully. They go, people in the CIA are afraid of my, I'm sorry, I'm laughing.
[03:39:38.680 --> 03:39:44.360]  That is how absurd it truly is. People in the CIA are afraid of Mike Sernovich. Why?
[03:39:44.360 --> 03:39:48.600]  Because I do journalism, because I tell the truth. And by the way, foreign policy, that
[03:39:48.600 --> 03:39:54.320]  was done in conjunction with just security. And if you go to the JustSecurities website,
[03:39:54.320 --> 03:39:59.800]  JustSecurity.org, and you look at who funds it, our good friend, George Soros does. Just
[03:39:59.800 --> 03:40:05.160]  Securities. So that hit piece on me was actually funded by George Soros. That's why when people
[03:40:05.160 --> 03:40:10.200]  tell you it's all connected, George Soros is finding hit pieces on me. And then these
[03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:15.840]  hit pieces, they're claiming, oh, I'm going after civil servants. People in the CIA now,
[03:40:15.840 --> 03:40:21.360]  that's what you call them. People with badges and guns and power, the ability to spy on
[03:40:21.360 --> 03:40:28.640]  American citizens. Those are just humble civil servants, like a mailman or something. That's
[03:40:28.640 --> 03:40:33.480]  where the narrative is shifting. And that's what they're doing. And our media is frivolous.
[03:40:33.480 --> 03:40:40.880]  There is a meme that kind of spread, and I now call it two scoops. I call the CNNs two
[03:40:40.880 --> 03:40:47.480]  scoops of journalism and excellence in journalism award. That comes, of course, from CNN's report
[03:40:47.480 --> 03:40:53.440]  that Donald Trump, when he, God, this is so dumb. These people are so dumb. The media
[03:40:53.440 --> 03:40:59.280]  world that we live in is all rush of conspiracy theory, and then complete in total stupidity
[03:40:59.280 --> 03:41:04.360]  instead of talking about real issues. So you'll all remember Donald Trump has, he's a regular
[03:41:04.360 --> 03:41:09.440]  at Trump Hotel because he owns it. He has dinner with people. Dessert arrives and everybody
[03:41:09.440 --> 03:41:13.600]  gets a typical dessert. But because the people know Trump, they give him two scoops of ice
[03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:18.040]  cream, they give him an extra scoop. And that was the whole special in CNN. So we call that
[03:41:18.040 --> 03:41:24.560]  two scoops journalism. So Chris Clesio, or however you say his name, I'm giving him the
[03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:32.080]  two scoops award in journalism for this clip of Trump and Macron shaking hands. So if you
[03:41:32.080 --> 03:41:36.160]  go to Chris Colasio's Twitter, I don't know how to say his people's names. I don't talk
[03:41:36.160 --> 03:41:37.160]  to them.
[03:41:37.160 --> 03:41:41.720]  That's the great thing about being an outsider. A lot of people go, Cernovich, do you deliberately
[03:41:41.720 --> 03:41:46.840]  mispronounce people's names or do you just don't know? I'm such an outsider, and I don't
[03:41:46.840 --> 03:41:51.120]  watch cable news, and I'm such an outsider. I don't talk to these people. I don't schmooze
[03:41:51.120 --> 03:41:55.200]  with them. I don't go to cocktail parties with them in DC. When I'm in DC, I just meet
[03:41:55.200 --> 03:41:59.360]  with the people. So I'm out in California. I do not pronounce the guy's name, but he
[03:41:59.360 --> 03:42:07.360]  does a second by second analysis of the handshake between Trump and Macron. So let's see if we
[03:42:07.360 --> 03:42:14.360]  can find that on his Twitter. He wrote a article on it too, a CNN. So as you know, a video
[03:42:14.360 --> 03:42:19.200]  surfaced of Trump and Macron shaking hands, and I think they shook hands for like 30 seconds
[03:42:19.200 --> 03:42:27.520]  because they were in some kind of like alpha male contest and Macron played a hand again.
[03:42:27.520 --> 03:42:35.320]  This is CNN. This is what they do. CNN doesn't want to do real journalism. So what they do
[03:42:35.320 --> 03:42:42.800]  is they pay some guy, Chris Colasio, $200,000 to a second by second analysis of the Trump
[03:42:42.800 --> 03:42:49.600]  Macron handshake. That's what CNN does. It's like a goofy thing. So actually, you know,
[03:42:49.600 --> 03:42:55.560]  my video crew made a really funny video. It's funny, right? You watch it. It's a funny thing.
[03:42:55.560 --> 03:42:59.760]  They're shaking hands, and you can tell Macron is trying to play like alpha male games with
[03:42:59.760 --> 03:43:04.560]  them and won't let go. So then Trump thinks, well, hey, you did this to me last time. So
[03:43:04.560 --> 03:43:09.280]  how about I not let you do it to me again? But then CNN, that's what the guy does. He's
[03:43:09.280 --> 03:43:13.440]  live blogging a handshake. When they're not talking about handshakes, they're talking
[03:43:13.440 --> 03:43:18.400]  about two scoops of ice cream. When they're not talking about two scoops of ice cream,
[03:43:18.400 --> 03:43:22.840]  they're talking about a Reddit user posting a GIF and how they're going to blackmail a
[03:43:22.840 --> 03:43:26.840]  Reddit user and to not posting GIFs about them anymore. And they'll dox them if you
[03:43:26.840 --> 03:43:33.240]  post another GIF. And this is a $20 billion corporation. What has happened to journalism
[03:43:33.240 --> 03:43:38.720]  in America, where they find it newsworthy, how many scoops of ice cream, President Trump
[03:43:38.720 --> 03:43:44.600]  seeds, and how, you know, many seconds he shook somebody's hands. And then they care
[03:43:44.600 --> 03:43:54.280]  about GIFs of Trump and CNN and pro wrestling. They're utterly frivolous. That is, of course,
[03:43:54.280 --> 03:43:59.320]  so why we're all growing. And for us to keep growing, we do need your support. And right
[03:43:59.320 --> 03:44:08.720]  now there is a massive, massive 30% special at InfowarsLife.com and InfowarsStore.com.
[03:44:08.720 --> 03:44:15.320]  A brain force is now 30% off. Supermail vitality is 30% off. Survival shield is 30% off. It
[03:44:15.320 --> 03:44:22.600]  is the big July extravaganza, the big July sale 30% off all these products. Because
[03:44:22.600 --> 03:44:29.200]  you remember InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLife.com, this is a self funded operation that they're
[03:44:29.200 --> 03:44:33.120]  running. I've been there. It's an impressive operation. It's better than CNN. And they
[03:44:33.120 --> 03:44:39.680]  do real journalism. Now, now sure, we joke around, we goof off, you know, Alex goofs
[03:44:39.680 --> 03:44:44.920]  off, you know, we have fun. It doesn't mean we don't have fun. But we do real journalism.
[03:44:44.920 --> 03:44:49.560]  We break real news. We break real stories. Remember the Susan Rice unmasking scandal.
[03:44:49.560 --> 03:44:54.680]  I broke that. Here I am on Infowars. CNN didn't break that story. New York Times didn't break
[03:44:54.680 --> 03:44:58.160]  that story. Washington Post didn't break it. Bloomberg didn't break it. Boston Globe
[03:44:58.160 --> 03:45:02.760]  didn't break LA Times. Right here. I broke it. Mike Cernovich who works with Infowars.
[03:45:02.760 --> 03:45:07.560]  That's what you're getting. When you support the store, you're getting original journalism,
[03:45:07.560 --> 03:45:13.000]  hard hitting reporting. And when we talk about the ice cream, and we talk about the handshakes
[03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:17.640]  and we talk about the fun stuff, we laugh and we have a good time. We don't do it. Here's
[03:45:17.640 --> 03:45:23.000]  what they do. They go, Oh my God, Trump, he had two scoops ice cream and his guests only
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:27.960]  had one scoop. This proves that Trump is a pathological narcissist. Here is our panel
[03:45:27.960 --> 03:45:33.320]  of five people of psychologists. Hey, will you opine about Trump? Just having two scoops
[03:45:33.320 --> 03:45:37.880]  ice cream and everybody else has one scoop. Evidence, mental illness, and mental history.
[03:45:37.880 --> 03:45:43.280]  And then all these doctors opine about it. But then when at Infowars and I report that
[03:45:43.280 --> 03:45:48.880]  Hillary Clinton has Parkinson's disease as diagnosed by a physician, they go, Well, how
[03:45:48.880 --> 03:45:55.000]  dare you diagnose somebody? You can't have a doctor diagnose somebody that the doctor
[03:45:55.000 --> 03:45:59.880]  has never treated. You can't have a doctor look at observable treatment and observable
[03:45:59.880 --> 03:46:05.800]  history and diagnose a person. You can't do that. But then the very next segment, they'll
[03:46:05.800 --> 03:46:11.320]  say, Okay, well, Trump had two scoops ice cream. That's really bad. Maybe he's a narcissist.
[03:46:11.320 --> 03:46:14.960]  You know, we'll have all these doctors come on and diagnose them and, and figure it out.
[03:46:14.960 --> 03:46:20.160]  Or maybe he's going to get diabetes and extra ice cream or whatever. That's CNN. How much
[03:46:20.160 --> 03:46:23.480]  a profit are going to make a year? When I tell you this, you're not going to believe
[03:46:23.480 --> 03:46:31.560]  it because I didn't believe it when I read this. The AT&T Time Warner merger value CNN
[03:46:31.560 --> 03:46:40.800]  at $20 billion. Again, this is real news, not fake news. This is real news. When I read
[03:46:40.800 --> 03:46:45.600]  the number, I didn't believe it. So I had to fact check it. The Time Warner AT&T merger
[03:46:45.600 --> 03:46:54.120]  value CNN at $20 billion is a $20 billion mega behemoth international corporate conglomerate.
[03:46:54.120 --> 03:47:01.640]  They're going to make this year $1 billion in profit. $1 billion in profit. If you, if
[03:47:01.640 --> 03:47:08.800]  InfoWars had $1 billion for one year in profit, the operation would grow by 10 times and it
[03:47:08.800 --> 03:47:12.240]  would be self-funded and perpetually. You perpetually, you wouldn't need to ever do
[03:47:12.240 --> 03:47:18.680]  it again. You, and perpetuity, there you go. You would not even need to ever raise any
[03:47:18.680 --> 03:47:24.200]  money again. So CNN is going to have $1 billion. What's that money going to do? Loaded offices,
[03:47:24.200 --> 03:47:30.160]  loaded salaries, paying people like Chris Colizio, you know, $500,000 a year to analyze
[03:47:30.160 --> 03:47:34.880]  Donald Trump's ice cream habits, to analyze his handshaking. There's no real news. They're
[03:47:34.880 --> 03:47:40.440]  not out actually breaking news. You never see them at the riots. Where were they with
[03:47:40.440 --> 03:47:45.760]  Antifa? You never see them on the streets. I march with the protestors at the DNC. Ten
[03:47:45.760 --> 03:47:50.720]  miles in March in 100 degree heat. Didn't see CNN. They weren't there. They weren't
[03:47:50.720 --> 03:47:56.680]  covering the truth about Bernie Sanders supporters. In fact, that's actually why it's one thing
[03:47:56.680 --> 03:48:02.680]  that Megan Kelly and the faked is we'll never tell you. A lot of people who are maybe quote-unquote
[03:48:02.680 --> 03:48:08.160]  left wing are watching InfoWars right now and are listening to InfoWars because they
[03:48:08.160 --> 03:48:12.800]  want real news and they want alternative news and they want alternative media. And during
[03:48:12.800 --> 03:48:19.080]  the election, they go, wait a minute, we're having a protest of 15,000 people at the DNC.
[03:48:19.080 --> 03:48:24.520]  But when we turn on CNN, the whole headline is DNC unites around Hillary Clinton. She's
[03:48:24.520 --> 03:48:29.760]  amazing. She's great. Everybody loves Hillary. Outside, everybody's talking about WikiLeaks.
[03:48:29.760 --> 03:48:35.960]  Big, huge, massive pushback against the DNC. So if you're liberal, you turn on our left
[03:48:35.960 --> 03:48:41.640]  winger and you turn on the TV, you don't see the truth. They're not showing those big protests.
[03:48:41.640 --> 03:48:45.240]  Fox News, finally, or Fox Business did finally after a couple of days. Lou Dobbs did because
[03:48:45.240 --> 03:48:50.720]  again, Lou Dobbs that we had earlier is a legitimate journalist and a legitimate reporter.
[03:48:50.720 --> 03:48:54.800]  Megan Kelly's not covering that kind of stuff. Jay Tapper's not kind of covering that stuff.
[03:48:54.800 --> 03:49:01.440]  They all work with a narrative, a fake news narrative. Speaking of which, WikiLeaks released
[03:49:01.440 --> 03:49:06.720]  an email that people had had before, but it became relevant again. Bill Clinton was paid
[03:49:06.720 --> 03:49:12.280]  $500,000 by Russia. Bloomberg, I believe is the, it was going to report on the story
[03:49:12.280 --> 03:49:19.240]  and they PR people quote, killed the story. How are they killing these stories? Bill Clinton
[03:49:19.240 --> 03:49:25.040]  got $500,000 for Russia to give a one hour speech. And then of course that $500,000 does
[03:49:25.040 --> 03:49:30.080]  include how he flies out there on private jets and all the women and prostitutes and
[03:49:30.080 --> 03:49:34.760]  everything that he has in there. That doesn't include any of that. So yeah, Hillary Clinton's
[03:49:34.760 --> 03:49:40.760]  campaign killed a story linking opposing sanctions and Bill Clinton paid $500,000. How were they
[03:49:40.760 --> 03:49:45.800]  able to kill these kinds of stories? Who killed that story? What quote, unquote, journalist
[03:49:45.800 --> 03:49:49.240]  had it? Well, I'll tell you how he killed the story. This is something people don't
[03:49:49.240 --> 03:49:55.600]  know. And this is why I love doing journalism on journalism. What happened is the, quote,
[03:49:55.600 --> 03:50:02.120]  reporter who had that story was going to, was going to run it. And then Hillary Clinton's
[03:50:02.120 --> 03:50:06.760]  people go, well, hey, how about if you don't run it, we'll give you an interview with Hillary
[03:50:06.760 --> 03:50:10.800]  or we'll give you an interview with John Podesta or we'll give you an interview with
[03:50:10.800 --> 03:50:17.720]  Uma or somebody. It's called access journalism. They traded a favor. So that guy, that journalist
[03:50:17.720 --> 03:50:23.920]  killed the story, which was true, high impact, all true, but it would also hurt Hillary.
[03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:27.280]  He probably didn't want to publish it anyway. That's another dirty secret is when they
[03:50:27.280 --> 03:50:31.240]  find stories critical of the Clintons, they don't even want to publish it. They're looking
[03:50:31.240 --> 03:50:36.840]  for a way out. What he did was he took a quid pro quo, took a bribe and said, okay, well,
[03:50:36.840 --> 03:50:41.920]  I'll kill this story. But what I want is an interview with Hillary Clinton or Bill or
[03:50:41.920 --> 03:50:46.280]  Uma or maybe Chelsea. And I want a little bit of puff piece. And I'll give you what
[03:50:46.280 --> 03:50:51.400]  you want. That's what you get in the mainstream media. And for wars is where I get real media.
[03:50:51.400 --> 03:50:55.320]  We don't make those kinds of deals. We do journalism, Susan Rice, I'm asking every

[03:54:23.800 --> 03:54:30.000]  forward slash Mike Cernovich here to talk to you about some breaking news. Brad Parscale,
[03:54:30.000 --> 03:54:36.200]  who ran Trump's Facebook team, social media team, and Alex team is now being subpoenaed
[03:54:36.200 --> 03:54:41.520]  to testify before Congress. They want him to testify. So Brad actually tweeted out again,
[03:54:41.520 --> 03:54:46.160]  this is breaking news. So we're pulling it up as Brad says, I'm unaware of any Russian
[03:54:46.160 --> 03:54:50.920]  involvement in the digital and data operations, the Trump campaign. The only collaboration
[03:54:50.920 --> 03:54:55.200]  I'm aware of in the Trump digital campaign was with staff provided the campaign by Facebook,
[03:54:55.200 --> 03:55:00.960]  Google and Twitter. Those experts in digital marketing work side by side with his firm,
[03:55:00.960 --> 03:55:05.600]  the RNC and Cambridge Analytica to run professional winning campaign. But he's going to talk to
[03:55:05.600 --> 03:55:09.960]  him anyway. So this is the importance of you listening in. Everybody wants to know how
[03:55:09.960 --> 03:55:15.480]  to support people. You can of course support the InfoWars by going to infowarslife.com
[03:55:15.480 --> 03:55:22.120]  and taking advantage of the great 30% off specials for July. It's a July super sale,

[03:55:32.920 --> 03:55:37.800]  big special deal. So that is one way that you can support the InfoWars and fund the
[03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:42.360]  operation. But maybe people don't take the supplement. So though I always say buy the
[03:55:42.360 --> 03:55:45.880]  toothpaste. My answer to the people who say, well, I don't want the supplements is I go,
[03:55:45.880 --> 03:55:50.000]  well, everybody uses toothpaste, just buy the toothpaste and get on an auto ship. Things
[03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:56.240]  like that add up. They add a big time. But another thing you can do, and this is why the
[03:55:56.240 --> 03:56:01.160]  fake news me is freaking out, share the links, share the links on social media, share the
[03:56:01.160 --> 03:56:07.000]  links on Twitter, YouTube clip them, cut them, edit them, make them happen. I have some crazy
[03:56:07.000 --> 03:56:13.240]  Facebook links from my own page from the past week. I did the numbers were so crazy, but

[03:56:44.640 --> 03:56:49.480]  think they're Russian robots behind all this. They can't understand that. No, we actually
[03:56:49.480 --> 03:56:54.360]  know how to engage with people. We don't talk down to people. We don't lecture our viewers
[03:56:54.360 --> 03:56:58.400]  and listeners. We don't treat people with disdain. So one very important thing, and
[03:56:58.400 --> 03:57:01.920]  that's why again, they're trying to get that Brad Parsdale's are trying to call them in
[03:57:01.920 --> 03:57:06.200]  like, Well, how is it that Trump did such a good job clearly had Russian robots? We don't
[03:57:06.200 --> 03:57:12.120]  need any of that. We didn't need Russia to run Twitter to run Facebook to run YouTube
[03:57:12.120 --> 03:57:16.720]  to run everything. These are streams that Alex has on YouTube. A lot of times they do
[03:57:16.720 --> 03:57:23.600]  10,000 simultaneous viewers, simultaneous nonstop 10,000 20,000. When Alex Jones went
[03:57:23.600 --> 03:57:28.520]  on the Joe Rogan podcast, that was the biggest the Guinness Book of World Records and certified
[03:57:28.520 --> 03:57:32.480]  actually Alex should. If I were Alex, I would tell the Guinness Book of World Recordization
[03:57:32.480 --> 03:57:40.200]  Certified the biggest podcast, most downloaded podcast of all time. At one point in the podcast,
[03:57:40.200 --> 03:57:47.280]  50,000 live views, that's a stadium. That's the kind of numbers that we're bringing Alex
[03:57:47.280 --> 03:57:52.920]  is bringing because of you listening in. People say, I want to join the info wars. I want
[03:57:52.920 --> 03:57:56.840]  to make things happen. That's how you make it happen. You share the links. Every time
[03:57:56.840 --> 03:58:02.240]  you share the links, you're firing a shot at evil. You're firing a shot for the good
[03:58:02.240 --> 03:58:08.080]  guys. Yeah, the Joe Rogan one, he four 4.5 million views just on the YouTube. That doesn't
[03:58:08.080 --> 03:58:12.280]  count the iTunes downloads. That doesn't count all the channels that reposted it and
[03:58:12.280 --> 03:58:17.560]  downloaded it. That thing was probably heard by 30 million people. Nobody, nobody in media
[03:58:17.560 --> 03:58:22.000]  is getting those kind of ratings. That's, that's because of you. Those of you listening.
[03:58:22.000 --> 03:58:27.120]  So you can, you can, of course, buy the toothpaste, the oral hygiene products, the mouthwash,
[03:58:27.120 --> 03:58:31.600]  the supplements, the infowordslife.com. But if that isn't your thing, you want to do something
[03:58:31.600 --> 03:58:38.080]  else. Keep sharing the links. You are part of the resistance. Fire those shots at evil.
[03:58:38.080 --> 03:58:54.160]  Thank you again for watching. This is Mike Cernovich.
