[08:52.320 --> 09:04.200]  okay I am really really fired up I come on the radio year after year and lay out
[09:04.200 --> 09:07.920]  the fact that I see bigger and bigger percentages of the American people
[09:07.920 --> 09:12.280]  waking up and that doesn't mean when a republicans in office they wake up to
[09:12.280 --> 09:15.960]  the fact that the republicans corrupt and put a democrat in or that when a
[09:15.960 --> 09:19.920]  democrats in office people wake up that they're a liar and put a republican in
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.640]  it means they're waking up that both political parties are bought and paid
[09:24.640 --> 09:30.640]  for by foreign offshore criminal interest and are systematically dismantling
[09:30.640 --> 09:37.240]  butchering decimating incinerating our bill of rights our constitution our
[09:37.240 --> 09:44.200]  free market our way of life there is no doubt and they come in with slick PR and
[09:44.200 --> 09:49.840]  international carpet bagging systems and takeover and we've now seen the
[09:49.840 --> 09:53.720]  results of nafta and gat and globalism in the new world order it isn't good we've
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.920]  gone from the greatest nation in the black to the greatest nation in the red
[09:57.920 --> 10:01.280]  we've gone from the healthiest nation to the most unhealthy nation we've gone
[10:01.280 --> 10:05.240]  from the most intelligent highest IQs highest test scores to one of the
[10:05.240 --> 10:09.680]  lowest in the world behind every industrialized nation and behind scores
[10:09.680 --> 10:15.680]  of third world nations the new world order is not good for human life it is
[10:15.680 --> 10:27.000]  not good for freedom and liberty and I made a big deal out of this on Monday and
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.600]  I made a big deal out of on Tuesday and you now notice it is massive national
[10:31.600 --> 10:40.640]  news because I knew this was a big story and just hiding under the surface the
[10:40.640 --> 10:44.280]  last few weeks the mainstream media has been saying oh people shouting down
[10:44.280 --> 10:48.440]  politicians a it's partisan they're saying they're only shouting down
[10:48.440 --> 10:52.480]  democrats that's not true see they're desperate it's okay to say they're
[10:52.480 --> 10:55.680]  shouting down democrats because then it's partisan and then people think oh
[10:55.680 --> 11:03.480]  the republicans will save us and the globalists just continue the scam so
[11:03.480 --> 11:07.200]  they're number one saying it's staged by lobbyist because you can't have
[11:07.200 --> 11:12.120]  citizens spontaneously shouting down and screaming and saying no and huge rooms
[11:12.120 --> 11:22.080]  of people not buying into it you can't have that and so they've got to tell the
[11:22.080 --> 11:26.040]  sheeple they've got to tell the public oh no that stage what you saw in local
[11:26.040 --> 11:30.440]  news or that YouTube video you saw with millions of views that stage that was
[11:30.440 --> 11:36.160]  fake that was a big auditorium of of lobbyists shipped in all those old
[11:36.160 --> 11:40.080]  people and they just jumped up and started screaming and saying no no no
[11:40.080 --> 11:47.120]  because they were paid to do it and then it happens in Austin and it happens in
[11:47.120 --> 11:50.520]  Pennsylvania and it happens in New York and happens in Florida and happens in
[11:50.520 --> 11:57.960]  California because they know that the sheeple are already upset and already
[11:57.960 --> 12:00.240]  don't like the government already don't believe a word the government says but
[12:00.240 --> 12:04.040]  the sheeple are still insecure and don't have any respect for themselves and so
[12:04.040 --> 12:08.240]  they wouldn't dare say anything at the water cooler at work or at lunch or at
[12:08.240 --> 12:11.040]  the little league baseball game they wouldn't dare say anything at church
[12:11.040 --> 12:18.480]  they wouldn't dare say anything at the bowling league or at the deer camp they
[12:18.480 --> 12:22.640]  wouldn't dare say anything out at the mailbox talking to their neighbor but
[12:22.640 --> 12:26.840]  if they start seeing on the news and on the web people standing up and saying
[12:26.840 --> 12:30.720]  no and see the majority doing it they say well that's how I feel too they're
[12:30.720 --> 12:34.440]  gonna step forward and find out everybody else agrees with them and then the
[12:34.440 --> 12:42.600]  entire illusion the entire mesmerized spell or trance or hypnotized state
[12:42.600 --> 12:46.760]  they're in and by the way the average Americans brainwaves have lowered in the
[12:46.760 --> 12:51.240]  last 40 years you can pull up mainline studies we have just go just Google or
[12:51.240 --> 12:59.120]  start page dot com or whatever one of the search engines the studies on western
[12:59.120 --> 13:04.680]  brainwaves lowering western IQ is dropping it's all happening by design
[13:04.680 --> 13:07.960]  through the television set and chemicals in the water and they know it these are
[13:07.960 --> 13:13.280]  mainline studies so people are in a dream-like state they're in a passive
[13:13.280 --> 13:19.440]  highly suggestible state just like you ever gone to a hypnotist or you ever
[13:19.440 --> 13:25.280]  been on a cruise and they've got a hypnotist there and you ever gone to a
[13:25.280 --> 13:28.800]  magician and they dim the lights and start talking real slowly to you and
[13:28.800 --> 13:32.200]  they call up 10 15 people and go through and ask them questions and they kick
[13:32.200 --> 13:36.440]  out most of them but they find the three or four highly suggestible and then
[13:36.440 --> 13:40.000]  you're highly suggestible too in the audience you're being somewhat
[13:40.000 --> 13:49.840]  hypnotized you have been hypnotized and I want you to come out of your trance
[13:49.840 --> 13:57.080]  and wake up to the wider world when I count to three I'm gonna slap my hands
[13:57.080 --> 14:04.840]  together one you're gonna wake up you're gonna wake up when I count to three one
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.240]  you're gonna wake up to the New World Order when I count to three and slap my
[14:08.240 --> 14:10.920]  hands together you're gonna wake up and realize you've been programmed and
[14:10.920 --> 14:15.240]  controlled because under your hypnotism you think it's cute and funny the system
[14:15.240 --> 14:18.680]  you're in they've got you at an arrested kind of four-year-old level where
[14:18.680 --> 14:22.460]  it's cute and funny like you're at a clown party but these aren't nice
[14:22.460 --> 14:27.240]  clowns these are vicious evil Joker like clowns clowns so I'm gonna count to
[14:27.240 --> 14:30.440]  three and you're gonna wake up I'm talking to those under deep programming
[14:30.440 --> 14:40.720]  out there one two three now of course that sounds ridiculous to those that
[14:40.720 --> 14:46.080]  have strong minds but that's how simple it is with the highly suggestible there
[14:46.080 --> 14:48.880]  are people out there by the thousands who are tuning into this show for the
[14:48.880 --> 14:53.040]  first time who literally are in deep trances and they will now their mind
[14:53.040 --> 14:57.360]  will hear that I was saying I was hypnotizing them and their own mind will
[14:57.360 --> 15:01.560]  go in and unhypnotize themselves and realize they've been under literally a
[15:01.560 --> 15:08.480]  spell a trance it's just that simple and see once you see behind the curtain of
[15:08.480 --> 15:12.880]  Barack Obama and his fake smiles and you know fooling you to feel like you're
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.040]  powerful through him and you've got this relationship with him and you've
[15:17.040 --> 15:22.640]  invested in him once you realize he's lied to you on 20 30 40 50 me just the
[15:22.640 --> 15:27.240]  list goes on and on count the lies good luck there's so many once you realize
[15:27.240 --> 15:31.320]  you've been scammed you've been pimped you've been gained you've been cowed
[15:31.320 --> 15:35.360]  that you're under the establishment's mind control thumb the illusion is
[15:35.360 --> 15:39.440]  shattered because once you shatter one little piece of the curtain once you
[15:39.440 --> 15:43.640]  poke one hole in there that sunlight pours in then you start ripping big
[15:43.640 --> 15:49.080]  holes in it oh it starts small like a dam with a tiny crack but within hours
[15:49.080 --> 15:53.920]  that dam has completely collapsed and the water is poured through and the dam
[15:53.920 --> 15:59.440]  has already broken there's no going back for the globalist they can they can
[15:59.440 --> 16:03.960]  slow things down they could stage terror attacks try to go to a hot war but we
[16:03.960 --> 16:08.960]  planted the seeds you the listeners planted the seeds by the billions across
[16:08.960 --> 16:15.080]  the world and as the tyranny is applied it's almost like sunlight their black
[16:15.080 --> 16:21.120]  sunshine reverses polarity and actually backfires on them and their tyranny
[16:21.120 --> 16:29.520]  actually makes the seeds germinate and sprout and grow and the minds unlock so
[16:29.520 --> 16:34.920]  no matter what you do new world order the beginning of the end the countdown
[16:34.920 --> 16:46.080]  has begun and it's gonna be rough and they're gonna pull out all the stops
[16:46.080 --> 16:49.600]  with weather modification to shut down the farms and ranches setting up the
[16:49.600 --> 16:53.000]  droughts and floods they admit they're doing it they're gonna increase the
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.280]  dosages of drugs in the water they're gonna keep expand the spraying but
[16:57.280 --> 17:04.360]  humanity is a very old species and has incredible resistance to this and once
[17:04.360 --> 17:11.760]  people are aware they're under attack it's an unstoppable force an irresistible
[17:11.760 --> 17:20.280]  force and so all these senators and all in the house leader in the in the speaker
[17:20.280 --> 17:24.280]  saying I think the people protesting and the people shouting us down at town
[17:24.280 --> 17:32.360]  halls are astro-terror for Nazis that's a quote we're in play coming up and
[17:32.360 --> 17:37.880]  Barbara Boxer and others are making fun of them saying you're scum see now
[17:37.880 --> 17:42.360]  they're hoping if they say you're scum you're Nazis you don't want open borders
[17:42.360 --> 17:45.080]  you don't want to turn your guns in you don't want socialized health care you're

[24:40.880 --> 24:44.920]  up and telling them that we're not going along with it and shattering the
[24:44.920 --> 24:50.320]  illusion that the public supports what the rogue government is doing and that
[24:50.320 --> 24:54.480]  illusion is falling is imploding right now I want to get more into that before

[25:47.040 --> 25:57.200]  sent by someone in law enforcement I'll just leave it at that and yes that's
[25:57.200 --> 26:00.920]  the unity they're going to make you love the government they're going to make you
[26:00.920 --> 26:04.440]  forget about the banks taking over the country in the new bank of the world in
[26:04.440 --> 26:09.960]  the carbon tax set to be passed and set up in October November their whole
[26:09.960 --> 26:13.840]  agenda they plan to ram through in the middle of this pandemic just like they
[26:13.840 --> 26:19.040]  ram to the Patriot Act during the staged anthrax attack it is so important we
[26:19.040 --> 26:23.040]  understand the enemy plan we've got to get the word out now and believe me I'm
[26:23.040 --> 26:27.360]  risking my life doing this folks they are very upset with me right now but they
[26:27.360 --> 26:31.240]  don't want to kill me and underline and highlight everything I've said and done
[26:31.240 --> 26:38.200]  and they can't stop an idea that's what gives us safety in numbers but I'll tell
[26:38.200 --> 26:43.120]  you it's spooky being at the tip of the spear so I'm gonna read this next hour
[26:43.120 --> 26:48.960]  in fact let's white out all of their common info or tape piece of paper over
[26:48.960 --> 26:54.240]  it so it looks professional and let's get this to Nemo and to Watson and let's
[26:54.240 --> 26:59.960]  get a story out on this because this confirms the quarantine the mass graves
[26:59.960 --> 27:04.840]  all of it and remember we gave you the secret document we were already at level
[27:04.840 --> 27:10.160]  five in April that they were going to level six in 96 hours with phone numbers
[27:10.160 --> 27:14.040]  with the doctor's names and people to come and tell pro attack is saying it
[27:14.040 --> 27:20.760]  wasn't real then months later came out oh in early May we went to level six but
[27:20.760 --> 27:24.760]  didn't tell the public global UN control of the United States and every other
[27:24.760 --> 27:30.720]  country under the treaties under the pandemic level six now we told you back
[27:30.720 --> 27:34.400]  in March about the mass graves and the FEMA camps and the emergency managers
[27:34.400 --> 27:37.840]  and played the tapes here of them saying they were being prepared for mass
[27:37.840 --> 27:43.360]  graves and quote militia attacks on the military now they're having public
[27:43.360 --> 27:46.840]  drills with the military where they have local police work with the military
[27:46.840 --> 27:51.280]  saying we're preparing for American gun owner militias to attack us they're now
[27:51.280 --> 27:57.600]  public with the op they're now announcing regular army to patrol America as
[27:57.600 --> 28:01.080]  cities and counties collapse financially we told you years ago that was the plan
[28:01.080 --> 28:10.320]  they implode you by design and federalize this is real by the way I I told
[28:10.320 --> 28:15.760]  everybody that they plan to put cameras in all parents homes under
[28:15.760 --> 28:19.320]  international law and then if you do anything wrong guilty of the proven
[28:19.320 --> 28:24.360]  innocent CPS will take your children and I said this is what is in Holdren's
[28:24.360 --> 28:32.120]  book the White House science Zarb and it's also all over the British news well
[28:32.120 --> 28:37.720]  wired magazine came out with a shell article yesterday saying no it's not
[28:37.720 --> 28:44.040]  cameras in the homes your children will be taken and raised in dormitories with
[28:44.040 --> 28:52.480]  cameras at birth as if that is better that's worse that's exactly what I've
[28:52.480 --> 28:55.400]  been saying all week is the real plan here because I have the government
[28:55.400 --> 28:59.720]  policy reports of what they were planning and so when I see them implement
[28:59.720 --> 29:02.600]  to say we're gonna put cameras in your homes which is also part of the
[29:02.600 --> 29:06.960]  operation they also say they're gonna take you and raise your children in
[29:06.960 --> 29:12.280]  government facilities this is the plan I know it sounds insane these people are

[35:13.040 --> 35:18.520]  gonna go over all that Cornyn accuses White House of compiling enemies list
[35:18.520 --> 35:24.720]  this is out of the Dallas Morning News today you notice that Monday Aaron a
[35:24.720 --> 35:29.280]  listener sent us a tip Aaron did searches we're not bragging that we broke
[35:29.280 --> 35:33.560]  this Aaron did searches because he wanted to confirm all he found was
[35:33.560 --> 35:37.280]  White House dot gov had just made the announcement hours before one of our
[35:37.280 --> 35:41.360]  listeners sent us the tip Aaron wrote a blurb about the enemy's list and
[35:41.360 --> 35:45.160]  reporting to the White House and now Limbaugh's covering it Dallas Morning
[35:45.160 --> 35:51.760]  News is covering it within days of us breaking this it's everywhere of course
[35:51.760 --> 35:55.200]  who broke it really the White House did I mean I'm just saying you the listeners
[35:55.200 --> 35:59.160]  are so great that's why I'm trying to hire a few more webmasters slash analysts
[35:59.160 --> 36:02.720]  who can dig through all your emails and tips and documents just to get it up I
[36:02.720 --> 36:07.280]  mean you know I've got an internal document here about the government
[36:07.280 --> 36:12.240]  swine flu symposium we're gonna let you know about that next hour and we keep
[36:12.240 --> 36:15.680]  getting the internal info because we've got people in every town city every
[36:15.680 --> 36:20.600]  corporation every every government agency thank God that we've got these
[36:20.600 --> 36:27.600]  type of contacts the only problem is we're such a small operation that we
[36:27.600 --> 36:31.560]  probably don't end up doing using all this stuff like we should but it doesn't
[36:31.560 --> 36:35.240]  matter we're doing the best job we can and that's what matters we're stepping up
[36:35.240 --> 36:39.680]  to the plate so I commend all of you corn and accuses White House of
[36:39.680 --> 36:43.440]  compiling enemies list another one GOP senator White House encroaching on
[36:43.440 --> 36:47.680]  First Amendment well yeah they had police say they'd arrest you if you

[37:12.320 --> 37:16.760]  spy system as they build giant NSA command centers from San Antonio Texas

[37:39.160 --> 37:43.640]  saving private Lynch thing that was all filled by Bruckheimer homeland security
[37:43.640 --> 37:48.440]  Napolitano predicts severe flu epidemic for fall she's not fear mongering again
[37:48.440 --> 37:53.400]  here's that spin story Britain to put cct cameras inside private homes but then
[37:53.400 --> 37:57.960]  they go well actually only some homes but mainly it's it's not the children
[37:57.960 --> 38:01.920]  will be taken and raised in government facilities before you've done anything
[38:01.920 --> 38:07.640]  wrong they just the government raises your kids now that's the plan I mean
[38:07.640 --> 38:12.240]  they did it in Russia they did it in China that's the plan the family's the
[38:12.240 --> 38:19.280]  number one enemy and I've got all these mom and UK fine for grieving too much

[38:29.280 --> 38:32.960]  just part of the frothing insanity
[38:34.640 --> 38:41.640]  Buffett was bailed out 95 billion of it's almost a hundred bill of your tax
[38:41.640 --> 38:48.920]  money went to that little criminal that that eugenicist so it's all coming up
[38:48.920 --> 38:54.720]  like I said we're gonna go to John Frank Alicia Andrew and Jessica here in
[38:54.720 --> 39:00.480]  just a moment but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because this is assuredly
[39:00.480 --> 39:05.360]  the best deal and he's been topping himself the last year this is the best
[39:05.360 --> 39:12.800]  deal I've ever seen him offer this is gold $60 he bought this gold when gold
[39:12.800 --> 39:20.680]  was $60 under what it is right now and it is up above 970 today he bought this
[39:20.680 --> 39:27.800]  from the 903 to 911 range some of the different coins he got and he still has
[39:27.800 --> 39:32.000]  some of it he has silver at a very low price when silver was a lot less than it
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.880]  is now Ted give folks the actual precise numbers well here's what we're talking
[39:36.880 --> 39:44.160]  about Alex Silver's over $15 an ounce today went to 1507 gold is at 972 80 when
[39:44.160 --> 39:48.800]  went over 970 an ounce today so you know to give you a little bit of a brief
[39:48.800 --> 39:52.800]  overview everybody's watching gold the foreigners want to get away from the
[39:52.800 --> 39:57.040]  dollar that's why gold's going up the United States dollar obviously down
[39:57.040 --> 40:03.800]  tremendously from that 89 level 86 level where it was what what I'm doing
[40:03.800 --> 40:08.240]  right now is I'm just holding those prices as hard as I can on the British
[40:08.240 --> 40:13.800]  Sovereigns and Frank's they're currently right now at 266 and the Frank's at 216
[40:13.800 --> 40:18.520]  I've done my shopping in the marketplace I'm gonna have to be up there at that at
[40:18.520 --> 40:23.000]  the 220 level on the Frank's the British Sovereigns are gonna be heading up into
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.400]  the 270 level and I'm just trying to hold that the walking Liberty halves
[40:28.400 --> 40:33.320]  obviously when now Silver's at 15 when it's the same price I had when Silver was
[40:33.320 --> 40:38.200]  at 11 and that's gonna go up to it's just I I was able to pick up about 50
[40:38.200 --> 40:42.280]  bags of those so I was in a good good position on that particular thing there
[40:42.280 --> 40:49.440]  at 869 the Lakota coins I have them marked at 1974 I did some pricing in
[40:49.440 --> 40:57.160]  there they're currently trading in that in that range of $20 and 45 cents right
[40:57.160 --> 41:01.840]  in that level so obviously that's a good buy as well now explain this to people
[41:01.840 --> 41:06.080]  though I can interrupt for a moment Ted when we say you're getting gold at the
[41:06.080 --> 41:12.320]  903 to 911 range that means Ted when he bought these that's what the market was
[41:12.320 --> 41:17.640]  so all those savings are passed on Ted of course with Silver and gold and
[41:17.640 --> 41:23.840]  everything he ends up you know paying for the shipping paying for bringing it in
[41:23.840 --> 41:27.200]  and then he puts a small markup I've looked at the different deals two to four
[41:27.200 --> 41:31.200]  percent markup to keep the lights on and pay the brokers and the employees and for
[41:31.200 --> 41:36.080]  the advertising but please look at other prices you're not going to find better
[41:36.080 --> 41:41.640]  deals on Frank's and sovereigns and half dollars and Silver dollars out there in
[41:41.640 --> 41:47.200]  these coins I happen to know that if Ted was trying to buy this now in the market
[41:47.200 --> 41:54.240]  it would be a lot more maybe what 10% more than what he is charging you so Ted
[41:54.240 --> 42:00.640]  is passing on incredible savings this really is a super deal and so you win
[42:00.640 --> 42:05.360]  win you get to buy gold and silver factored into the market when it was
[42:05.360 --> 42:10.760]  $60 less and when Silver was how much less per ounce well Silver was right
[42:10.760 --> 42:15.100]  around that 1140 range you know I can't exactly remember where it hit and now
[42:15.100 --> 42:20.440]  it's up to 15 yeah $15 let's take a look today let's explain this you know
[42:20.440 --> 42:25.000]  when you got half dollars for for eight and a half dollars or you've got Silver
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.200]  dollars for 18 to 20 depending on what type of Silver dollar folks go out and
[42:29.200 --> 42:33.880]  try to get Silver dollars or Lakota's anywhere near that these are in just
[42:33.880 --> 42:38.200]  incredibly good deals I mean I want you to go look into this I want you to find
[42:38.200 --> 42:44.680]  out I mean this is a just smashingly good deal I don't know how I can make it
[42:44.680 --> 42:48.400]  better for people but you know the thing of it is is that it's been so easy to
[42:48.400 --> 42:52.600]  predict when the market is selling off I'm able to just step into the marketplace
[42:52.600 --> 42:58.200]  quietly position myself interestingly enough people really desire to buy gold
[42:58.200 --> 43:03.120]  and silver when it's higher not when it's lower and so when you know when it's
[43:03.120 --> 43:06.880]  higher I have a hard time getting supply but when things drop down a little bit
[43:06.880 --> 43:10.960]  it's much easier for me to buy and buy it at a better price the market starts
[43:10.960 --> 43:14.760]  running up again I mean I think it's a no-brainer I mean well I watch what's
[43:14.760 --> 43:18.360]  going on in Washington DC and they're handing down these mandates which I
[43:18.360 --> 43:24.520]  think is is economic suicide for this country and for some reason people think
[43:24.520 --> 43:27.760]  that because the stock market went up a little bit and gold took a little bit of
[43:27.760 --> 43:32.400]  a correction everything's okay again well that's because they're pumping 23.7
[43:32.400 --> 43:36.280]  trillion into the stock market and other assets as the elite buy-up
[43:36.280 --> 43:41.000]  infrastructure and companies we saw this when the oil prices exploded and all
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.160]  the commodities went up when they created a bubble but the real economy is
[43:45.160 --> 43:50.480]  dying and believe me I'm not happy about that we have all the jobless numbers
[43:50.480 --> 43:56.200]  right up at 400,000 last month lost they're now saying that the economy is
[43:56.200 --> 44:00.680]  absolutely dead in the water they're saying that in fact I'm trying to pull
[44:00.680 --> 44:06.240]  up the actual article here that by 2011 half of mortgages here it is this is
[44:06.240 --> 44:11.680]  Reuters about half of us mortgages seen underwater by 2011 every indicator is
[44:11.680 --> 44:16.360]  it's sliding they're lying saying everything's fine so you'll stand down
[44:16.360 --> 44:21.400]  while they pass the carbon tax the gun grab the water grab bill the socialized
[44:21.400 --> 44:26.280]  government health care the scam healthcare it's not even socialized it is
[44:26.280 --> 44:30.960]  all happening right now and ladies and gentlemen you need to call these brokers
[44:30.960 --> 44:35.440]  Ted you keep extending this extending this and I know you've got only got a
[44:35.440 --> 44:38.680]  little bit of these silver and gold I've never seen you extend it this long how
[44:38.680 --> 44:43.320]  long can you hold this well again it's about supply and demand and I'm my
[44:43.320 --> 44:46.720]  supply is running real short so obviously I'm gonna have to start raising my
[44:46.720 --> 44:51.560]  prices just this morning my buyer her name is Mona she reminded me that the
[44:51.560 --> 44:55.360]  prices have gone up quite a bit and I've got to raise the prices because she's
[44:55.360 --> 44:59.160]  watching the supply and what's going on in our in our little safe here what we
[44:59.160 --> 45:03.120]  have stored abroad and what kind of deals that we have locked in with our
[45:03.120 --> 45:06.800]  wholesalers and she knows that the prices are going up and that's why she
[45:06.800 --> 45:10.320]  reminded me this morning that if I go on the air I gotta raise the prices but I
[45:10.320 --> 45:13.680]  just said no I'm gonna hold it because I want to give people the opportunity to
[45:13.680 --> 45:19.320]  still get in all I can see Alex is that the the the market's going up right now
[45:19.320 --> 45:23.440]  in the gold and silver it's creeping upward people you know the smart money
[45:23.440 --> 45:26.920]  right now is watching it they're getting in that's why the prices are rising a
[45:26.920 --> 45:31.960]  lot of people are getting you know into this romance of the stock market going
[45:31.960 --> 45:35.880]  up but if they just take a look at the fundamentals that's why I say economic
[45:35.880 --> 45:39.840]  suicide just the very things that you were talking about is a short list of
[45:39.840 --> 45:43.840]  what's really going on out there it is the suckers rally there's no doubt folks
[45:43.840 --> 45:46.960]  here is the number to protect yourselves here is the number to get into some
[45:46.960 --> 45:50.480]  silver and gold they haven't been small increments big increments you want one
[45:50.480 --> 45:53.760]  piece of silver one piece of gold a hundred pieces of silver a hundred
[45:53.760 --> 45:57.560]  pieces of gold they have it all right now for you you cannot beat this deal
[45:57.560 --> 46:08.080]  800 686 2237 1 800 686 2237 Midas resources incorporated the owners of
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.240]  Genesis it's a win-win-win it also supports the network but I know the
[46:12.240 --> 46:17.920]  markup I see the rate sheets they send out to me it is pathetic what Ted might
[46:17.920 --> 46:22.080]  make five six dollars on one of these little gold coins he might make a dollar
[46:22.080 --> 46:27.120]  half a dollar on these silvers these are lost leaders you cannot beat this deal
[46:27.120 --> 46:35.920]  800 686 2237 one more time folks take advantage don't procrastinate 800 686
[46:35.920 --> 46:43.720]  2237 the banks the system is not safe you need to get diversified 800 686 2237
[46:43.720 --> 46:47.640]  thank you Ted yeah well thanks a lot and just remember the stock market had its
[46:47.640 --> 46:53.320]  days here the July June even August good times for the stock market it just
[46:53.320 --> 46:57.160]  happens to be a completely different September October November that's gold
[46:57.160 --> 47:02.560]  time just take a look at a chart you'll see that that's the case 800 686 2237
[47:02.560 --> 47:06.760]  get in before it goes up well it's already going up 70 dollars the last
[47:06.760 --> 47:11.520]  week Ted thank you so much yeah thanks for having me up Alex you bet Ted okay
[47:11.520 --> 47:15.160]  there there is my rant on the gold for the day in the last five minutes now I
[47:15.160 --> 47:18.000]  want to go to your phone calls now to have your question your comment ready
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.320]  and then I'm gonna blitz into all this other important news and we've got an
[47:21.320 --> 47:25.360]  expert on the flu a medical doctor coming up as we continue to track what
[47:25.360 --> 47:30.640]  appears to be an enemy false flag operation being set up the enemy is the
[47:30.640 --> 47:33.240]  foreign offshore banks of hijacked the nation in case you're wondering who that
[47:33.240 --> 47:42.240]  is John and Ohio you're on the air Alex good John all right great listen first
[47:42.240 --> 47:46.240]  of all we've already won this Alex they don't know it yet but we've won this
[47:46.240 --> 47:51.120]  and this is absolutely amazing I'm out here I have police contacts down in
[47:51.120 --> 47:55.160]  Gwinnett County Georgia who say they they've heard about these shots coming
[47:55.160 --> 47:59.280]  they all said I mean I have good contacts or they said we'll walk off the job
[47:59.280 --> 48:03.480]  we're not taking them they all said we are not taking them but their main
[48:03.480 --> 48:08.840]  reason for my call Alex was about an article that came out of the Cleveland
[48:08.840 --> 48:13.520]  Clinic five days ago that they have bought a large stake in a company
[48:13.520 --> 48:18.680]  producing ionic silver so for anybody out there that thinks that this doesn't
[48:18.680 --> 48:23.400]  work the Cleveland Clinic has put out publicly in an article and just just
[48:23.400 --> 48:27.480]  Google Ionic Silver Cleveland Clinic it'll come right up they believe that
[48:27.480 --> 48:31.520]  this is the biggest breakthrough in a hundred years medically and and it's
[48:31.520 --> 48:36.760]  very important guns ammo food water it gets your silver it will save your life
[48:36.760 --> 48:41.000]  start taking it now in small amounts and be ready that if something were to
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.360]  kick off that you can use it to really heal yourself and family hey you know
[48:46.360 --> 48:52.280]  whenever we've got bacteria type situation you know a bacterial infection
[48:52.280 --> 48:57.440]  nothing will work but the nano silver the smaller the particle the better now
[48:57.440 --> 49:00.560]  there's some people who drink silver four or five times a day and it literally
[49:00.560 --> 49:06.280]  turns them blue that's an overdose you any drug will do that and I've seen
[49:06.280 --> 49:09.600]  people that literally get blue skin because they're they're silver addicts
[49:09.600 --> 49:14.160]  there's also gold addicts there's there's there there is nano gold which is
[49:14.160 --> 49:18.640]  even better because these are microscopic particles that are like like
[49:18.640 --> 49:24.960]  blast bullet holes in in viruses and bacteria so everybody knows silver is
[49:24.960 --> 49:29.400]  antibacterial that's how people would eat off silver it's an absolute fact we've
[49:29.400 --> 49:33.200]  had medical doctors on that recommended does it mean it's a silver bullet no
[49:33.200 --> 49:37.680]  nothing's a silver bullet but the closest thing is silver to a silver bullet
[49:37.680 --> 49:41.200]  obviously that's where you get the term silver bullet it was known for its
[49:41.200 --> 49:46.760]  healing properties so six hundred seven hundred years ago you know back at the
[49:46.760 --> 49:51.360]  end of the dark ages in Europe silver was known as healing so it was a talisman
[49:51.360 --> 49:58.560]  silver cross a silver bullet against evil okay enough about that that's why
[49:58.560 --> 50:04.640]  we say silver bullet let's take another call Frank in Connecticut Frank go
[50:04.640 --> 50:10.640]  ahead hi Alex my name is Rocco Frank and I'm over here in Milford Connecticut and
[50:10.640 --> 50:17.120]  I'm a blogger for the Milford Connecticut Daily blog and I'm writing kind of like
[50:17.120 --> 50:24.480]  a little piece and I wanted to get your thoughts on this my point was when this
[50:24.480 --> 50:30.080]  North American Union let's say that the reality of it comes together and they
[50:30.080 --> 50:36.200]  give us sort of the same scenario that they gave in Europe where we stay there
[50:36.200 --> 50:40.160]  there yes stay there that that song always catches people willy nelson was on

[54:59.800 --> 55:04.400]  doing this for a blog go ahead okay yeah my blog is the Milford daily blog
[55:04.400 --> 55:09.480]  dot com and I'm putting together an opinion piece and my opinion really is
[55:09.480 --> 55:13.720]  kind of going to be based on the research that I'm doing from experts in the
[55:13.720 --> 55:17.000]  field I got a lot of stuff from Lou Dobbs and I know you've talked about this
[55:17.000 --> 55:22.560]  issue extensively so I wanted to get your thoughts but my question is with the
[55:22.560 --> 55:28.800]  North American Union you know on the table when that happens I understand
[55:28.800 --> 55:34.040]  that we have a program to replace the currency within a marrow when the
[55:34.040 --> 55:39.000]  currency is replaced like they did in Europe how does that translate the
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.720]  consumer debt being revalued mortgage debt and credit card debt being
[55:42.720 --> 55:47.480]  revalued is that do the people usually come out ahead or they end up worse off
[55:47.480 --> 55:51.600]  and you know what are your thoughts on that okay I appreciate your call that's
[55:51.600 --> 55:57.560]  a very complex question anybody that says they have the answer to it is lying
[55:57.560 --> 56:03.320]  the globalist have said they might go to an amaro or they may go directly to the
[56:03.320 --> 56:11.040]  global Phoenix that's money magazine back in 1989 the United Nations has been
[56:11.040 --> 56:15.040]  studying different currencies that even the Russian president at the UN a few
[56:15.040 --> 56:20.160]  weeks ago unveiled it they may skip directly to a world currency or more
[56:20.160 --> 56:23.640]  likely you're still gonna have regional currencies but they're all gonna be
[56:23.640 --> 56:29.320]  pegged and set and valued by a single global regulator the new bank of the
[56:29.320 --> 56:33.560]  world so we know it's gonna be the new bank of the world regulating it we know
[56:33.560 --> 56:37.880]  it'll be backed by carbon taxes and money transfer and financial transfer and
[56:37.880 --> 56:44.200]  financial activities taxes this is all been announced but exactly how they're
[56:44.200 --> 56:47.160]  gonna implement it in what order we're not sure we know they're starting with
[56:47.160 --> 56:51.480]  the carbon tax and the cap and trade business run by Goldman Sachs and
[56:51.480 --> 56:58.320]  others so they may just completely bypass a North American currency they're
[56:58.320 --> 57:02.960]  already dollar rising the peso in Mexico and dollar rising the loony and
[57:02.960 --> 57:08.520]  lowering the dollar to the loony and to the peso so they're not really rising
[57:08.520 --> 57:16.200]  those we're falling but it doesn't matter you know it's the analogy is four
[57:16.200 --> 57:20.920]  dealers in Texas advertise their Texas tough but then they also advertise
[57:20.920 --> 57:24.920]  their Indiana tough or Nebraska tough it's still a Ford dealer it's still a
[57:24.920 --> 57:28.320]  Ford truck just like there's you know I don't know how many different versions
[57:28.320 --> 57:31.920]  of sports illustrated 10 20 30 I don't know all these regional sports
[57:31.920 --> 57:37.200]  illustrated it's still issued by the same company it just has a local flair so
[57:37.200 --> 57:41.480]  you'll have an Asian currency and North American currency a Latin American you
[57:41.480 --> 57:44.760]  South American currency a Caribbean currency and African currency they
[57:44.760 --> 57:49.200]  already are setting those up but above that you have SDRs and these
[57:49.200 --> 57:54.000]  international lending credits and rights that are just fiat the banks make up
[57:54.000 --> 57:59.360]  that then governments honor his money and then all that is backed up by the
[57:59.360 --> 58:02.520]  American people and other populations around the world and the tax money we
[58:02.520 --> 58:07.760]  pay our labor we are pledges collateral in our national infrastructure just like
[58:07.760 --> 58:13.320]  a third-world country and so I see them more and more bypassing even
[58:13.320 --> 58:19.880]  international and regional currencies and going right to cash so you'll just
[58:19.880 --> 58:24.720]  be paying with a card or with a chip and and and accessing it with a thumb
[58:24.720 --> 58:30.040]  printer face scan that's where this is all going not a new world currency the
[58:30.040 --> 58:35.160]  world currency is your face it is your hand gee I've heard that somewhere
[58:35.160 --> 58:40.120]  before but that's what's being implemented it is what it is

[1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:31.360]  way I've been trying to spread the message about the globalist trying to
[1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:35.640]  be succinct you did an excellent job yesterday coast-to-coast you always
[1:01:35.640 --> 1:01:40.440]  amazed me how you can just get that message down and you know hammer it out

[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:24.360]  smoking cigarettes again and things and I finally said you know what I got to
[1:02:24.360 --> 1:02:27.400]  get myself straight if I'm gonna try to change the world and that's how we all

[1:03:40.200 --> 1:03:46.360]  air hi Alex my name is Andrew I'm a I'm a 28-year-old biochemist from Texas
[1:03:46.360 --> 1:03:56.360]  living in Australia I don't think that enough attention has been paid to the
[1:03:56.360 --> 1:04:01.640]  scriptures the various scriptures the prophecies I've read a lot of books I've
[1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:06.720]  read the Islamic origins of Freemasonry I've read the Arcana of Freemasonry and
[1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:11.440]  I believe that this is going to happen on September 9th and I and I I really
[1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:17.360]  think I can prove it 9 is the number of Lucifer 6 is the number of Satan
[1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:20.640]  flipping it over three times represents the fall from grace and I believe the
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:24.880]  numerology is critical numerology has proven itself critical throughout
[1:04:24.880 --> 1:04:29.560]  history yeah the globalists are obsessed with numerology whether it's real or not
[1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:36.280]  they believe it's real yes it and I believe that the elite hand I've watched

[1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:05.560]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:10.080]  because there's a war on for your mind
[1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:19.600]  we're gonna be talking to Dr. Henry L. Nyman in this moment medical doctor
[1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:25.840]  expert on influenza patent holder major developer of a lot of major discoveries
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:29.680]  and technologies he is gonna be with us for the rest of the hour here in just one
[1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:36.880]  moment I did want to mention the fact that scores of mainstream news articles
[1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:45.280]  are saying it is racist to lampoon Barack Obama now the very same New York
[1:08:45.280 --> 1:08:49.560]  magazine that showed George Bush as a vampire sucking the blood of Lady
[1:08:49.560 --> 1:08:58.200]  Liberty they are now criticizing Obama as the Joker because he's a clown in
[1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:06.920]  whiteface this is the political mental illness this is the weapon that they are
[1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:11.520]  using they know it's not racist they are scared of it because they have this
[1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:15.840]  arch-time ball image of Obama as this sweetie pie who never lies and cares about
[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:20.880]  you when in truth he is a Joker like frontman laughing at the public as he
[1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:26.680]  steals 23.7 trillion did the Joker of Batman fame still 23.7 trillion no
[1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:31.600]  only Barack Obama could sucker the people into doing it and this arch-time
[1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:38.080]  ball image is really scaring the establishment right now that's why I'm
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:45.200]  sending a crew out today to put up posters that you see there if we just
[1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:48.440]  went live at prison planet dot TV for the radio audience we have these posted
[1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:53.440]  online at info wars.com that's why we're gonna post these all over South
[1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:57.600]  Austin and we encourage other people around Austin and other cities imagine
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:00.560]  if people listening right now in Austin tens of thousands of listeners here in
[1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:05.520]  Austin would all go print these off info wars.com print them off a color
[1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:10.360]  printer or black and white go out with a staple gun put them on power poles tape
[1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:15.760]  them up on power boxes imagine the effect and we've got a bunch of
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:23.760]  versions Obama fascism Obama info wars Obama New World Order Obama socialism
[1:10:24.760 --> 1:10:28.960]  this this image is really having a big effect and they're now saying it's
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:33.800]  racist that people should be investigated who put this up that you
[1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:38.080]  should be stopped from doing it it is our first amendment and you keep a right
[1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:43.680]  by exercising it we're also going to make one with Bush in fact I forgot to
[1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:48.680]  tell Douglas to do that make one with Bush in whiteface with a Joker face
[1:10:48.680 --> 1:10:52.800]  real fast before they leave to go to plaster these around let's let's get a
[1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:58.400]  bush went up to because this is this is a bipartisan situation by the way we
[1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:01.440]  have the t-shirts they're being manufactured right now you get them
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:07.280]  here first at info wars.com and these are really a hot seller we've never
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:10.840]  sold a t-shirt like this people are going wild buying these and you can get
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:16.560]  them with Obama fascism Obama info wars.com Obama New World Order you can
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:22.120]  get it Obama socialism you can get it in all these different formats and on the
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:25.880]  back it says wake up before it's too late on one shirt one says stop the
[1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:30.960]  criminals one says in the Fed on the back so people see in the Fed they go
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:35.240]  what does it have to do with Obama being a Joker well he's the front man for the
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:41.360]  real Jokers now you don't have to buy the t-shirt info wars.com though it's a
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:44.400]  walking billboard to start conversations and discuss this it's a
[1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:50.720]  stunning image you can go to info wars.com the headline is Joker Obama
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:57.440]  posters to go viral and we have the Obama fascism the Obama socialism the
[1:11:57.440 --> 1:12:02.400]  Obama New World Order the Obama info wars.com we're gonna get a bush up there
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:08.920]  to an Obama fascism and bush fascism up there we've got to wake up before it's
[1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:14.640]  too late we've got an in the Fed you'll print these off print them on your
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:17.640]  printer print them on a color printer it looks even better like these that we're
[1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:21.760]  showing you on TV as we simulcast and get them out because there's this
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:26.400]  rebellion going on everywhere at every town hall of Republicans and Democrats
[1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:30.440]  everywhere they're being shut down from Austin and New York from New Jersey to
[1:12:30.440 --> 1:12:35.120]  Florida from California to Michigan it's happening everywhere the people are
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:38.720]  rising they've almost got two-thirds majority to audit the Fed in the house
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:44.920]  an override ladies and gentlemen this is getting so exciting this is only the
[1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:49.480]  beginning we've only begun to fight so I'm asking you let's have a flash mob
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:55.520]  let's have this go viral right now all of you today or tomorrow don't
[1:12:55.520 --> 1:13:00.360]  procrastinate go print these off even if it's black and white get a stapler
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:07.600]  get some tape get a can of glue with the paintbrush put them up now we're gonna
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:11.200]  go out today and do this I got a bunch of work I've got to do I'm gonna send one
[1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:15.240]  team out now to do it the next hour that I'm gonna go out tonight and do it when
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:20.600]  I come back to work I'm gonna stop I'm gonna put these up all of us as a team
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:26.960]  effort and if this is successful we can do this in the future we can do this in
[1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:30.600]  the future on the flu and other issues like don't take the shot that we ought
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:35.080]  to create one that says I mean I think I told him but they've been so busy we need
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:38.600]  one that says don't take the flu shot under it let's make one of those for
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:42.080]  Obama right now get it up in the flyers as well this is up on info wars.com
[1:13:42.080 --> 1:13:45.920]  it's up on prisonplanet.com get these if you're watching this a few days from
[1:13:45.920 --> 1:13:51.320]  now can't find on the main page Google Joker Obama posters to go viral we also
[1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:57.400]  have an article called Obama as Joker explained in Bob Kane's original comic
[1:13:57.400 --> 1:14:00.880]  book the Joker is a master criminal and a bizarre psychopath Obama is not
[1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:05.120]  necessarily psychopath this is to say a ruthless hands-on killer but by the
[1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:08.720]  standard of his office he is a master criminal or rather a frontman for a
[1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:15.080]  cartel of master criminals so get this out to everybody let's go wild today
[1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:22.240]  okay now going to our guest who I really appreciate joining us I've read so much
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:25.600]  of his great research it's his first time on with us we really appreciate him
[1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:29.960]  coming on and we're gonna post his website up on the screen for everybody
[1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:40.640]  up there it's flutracker.rhizalabs.com or RecomboBioneticsBionetics.com he is
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:44.120]  Dr. Henry L. Nyman and Doc I know you don't like to toot your horn but will you
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:52.680]  give people briefly your extensive via okay yeah hi Alex good to be on good
[1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:59.480]  background I've been studying viruses since I was in graduate school got my
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:05.320]  PhD at the University of Southern California back in 1978 and then did
[1:15:05.320 --> 1:15:10.040]  postdoctoral work and went on staff at a Drift Clinic and Research Foundation
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:15.360]  there I was mostly working on oncogenes but I also did some work on the flu
[1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:20.720]  back then with Ian Wilson who actually discovered the structure of the
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:26.840]  influenza virus was on the cover of Nature magazine back in 1980 I developed
[1:15:26.840 --> 1:15:34.240]  monoclonal antibodies which are kind of factories that make antibodies to target
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:39.360]  almost anything including the flu the flu monoclonal is probably the most
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:45.560]  popular monoclonal in the world everybody uses it mostly for basic
[1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:51.840]  research to attract different genes that is designed so that it can really
[1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:55.520]  identify any type of gene. This is not just you saying that you're a
[1:15:55.520 --> 1:16:01.160]  world-renowned inventor in this area so you're uniquely qualified to speak on
[1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:04.840]  what we're currently facing. Yeah and basically you bring a little bit more
[1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:10.680]  current you know when I was at Harvard I got a little bit interested in newly
[1:16:10.680 --> 1:16:16.000]  emerging viruses I studied the virus virus worked with most of the
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:22.960]  researchers that were sequencing the virus in Asia and then when bird flu
[1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:32.160]  kind of made its appearance back in 2003 I kind of switched over to that and
[1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:36.960]  looked at how the virus evolved that's what recombinomics does it really looked
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:43.720]  at the genetic sequence of the virus these how it evolved and actually uses
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:51.000]  that evolution to make predictions and to identify and to predict what the virus
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:57.800]  is going to look like in the future. All right sir Ian in a nutshell can you
[1:16:57.800 --> 1:17:02.840]  boil down what's happening is this engineered other virologists have said
[1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:06.080]  it doesn't have a pedigree that they believe it was made in a lab A do you
[1:17:06.080 --> 1:17:09.840]  concur with that B if it's only killed a few hundred people in the US a few
[1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:15.920]  thousand worldwide regular flu kills 400,000 worldwide 300 30,000 a year in
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:21.000]  the US CDC says we can differ with those numbers is this hyped to sell vaccine is
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:25.800]  this a cover for something else injecting people with the shots is that
[1:17:25.800 --> 1:17:30.320]  gonna cause it to mutate as some are saying I mean so much is going on what's
[1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:34.920]  the bottom line doctor there's a lot it's a lot out there this is the real deal
[1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:41.680]  I mean this is a a virus it is not man-made it's a natural virus okay it's
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:46.720]  a combination which led to some of the some of the speculation that just to
[1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:51.480]  give you a brief background virus it's got eight different segments it's kind
[1:17:51.480 --> 1:17:56.320]  of like a person with chromosomes you got 46 chromosomes well the virus has
[1:17:56.320 --> 1:18:02.160]  eight and each of those gene segments has kind of a pedigree you can look at the
[1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:07.320]  sequence and tell where it came from and this virus is a mixture it has one of
[1:18:07.320 --> 1:18:11.520]  these genes it's called it's one of the genes that the Bob was copying is
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:17.080]  genetic information it's called PV1 that's a human gene but that was picked up
[1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:24.000]  by this virus back in 1993 from a human H3N2 so now the human gene's been in this
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  virus for almost two decades it's got two other genes that are involved with
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:33.240]  copying the genetic information also called polymerase or polymerase A and
[1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:38.840]  polymerase B1 and both of those I'm sorry B2 and both of those are avian and
[1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:44.520]  then the other five genes there's twine so it really has five twine two avian and
[1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:52.960]  one human but it's had that composition since the 1990s so it didn't just happen
[1:18:52.960 --> 1:19:00.280]  it didn't just you know get manufactured none of that is is unusual and the
[1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:05.680]  reason it happens at a high frequency is because it all happens in twine
[1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:13.280]  twine is able to be infected by both avian viruses human viruses as well as
[1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:20.080]  swine viruses all these are flu and we get multiple viruses in the same host in
[1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:26.520]  the case of swine the virus can either swap those chromosomes those 18 and come
[1:19:26.520 --> 1:19:30.560]  up with a new constellation of genes or it can actually recombine and actually
[1:19:30.560 --> 1:19:36.320]  take the sequence. Okay Dr. Nyman's stay there quick break
[1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:41.760]  gotta break quick break I want to come back and then go over why we see the
[1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:46.320]  build-up why the preparations for forced inoculations talk of using the army
[1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:52.400]  talk of quarantines in the fall for something that's killed 200 people with
[1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:57.840]  our guests. Dr. Nyman again is a medical doctor expert virologist researching
[1:19:57.840 --> 1:20:05.240]  all this. Hi Ed Schultz here I want to tell you about biogreenclean.com

[1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:40.560]  time coming up give us your bottom line it's one of the top experts out there
[1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:46.040]  cutting the flu and get the big flu tracker tracking it worldwide of why
[1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:49.520]  are they taking this so serious why are they saying they're getting ready for
[1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:53.560]  forced inoculations and quarantines over something that's killed a couple hundred
[1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:59.880]  people in the United States okay well it really has to do with the the history of
[1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:06.200]  of pandemic to the past and the similarity of this particular pandemic in
[1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:13.960]  2009 with the pandemic in 1918 just as a refresher the 1918 pandemic killed
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:20.440]  between 20 and 50 million people worldwide it and the population back in
[1:25:20.440 --> 1:25:25.640]  1918 was about a quarter of what the population is today it infected about a
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:31.680]  third of the world's population between 1918 and 1919 and the people that were
[1:25:31.680 --> 1:25:37.120]  dying were generally young previously healthy adults between the ages of 20 and
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:42.200]  45 it actually ended world war one because it was so widespread because so
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:47.800]  many the troops were dying from it the concern is that this is a rerun the
[1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:54.040]  virus in 1918 was the swine virus that jumped into the human population and it
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:59.040]  recombined and came up with a new version the virus in 1918 did exactly what
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:04.560]  2009 did and the spring has started out as a mild disease in fact the physicians
[1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:08.600]  that were looking at patients in the spring of 1918 didn't even think it was
[1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:13.640]  influenza because it was so mild and then the virus evolved and in the fall it
[1:26:13.640 --> 1:26:19.960]  came back with a vengeance and it ended up killing the large number of people the
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:25.800]  2009 is really behaving the same way it is a swine virus which has jumped the
[1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:32.240]  human the last time a swine virus jumped a human and was easily transmitted was
[1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:38.480]  1918 there was a some of your listeners may be old enough remember 1976 which
[1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:43.880]  was the swine flu vaccine and that case it was the soldier at Fort Dick's that
[1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:49.360]  died and a few hundred soldiers at Fort Dick's were infected that led to the
[1:26:49.360 --> 1:26:53.080]  vaccine program but by the time the vaccine was ready on the virus that
[1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:57.360]  it simply burned itself out it never really got out of what also the fact
[1:26:57.360 --> 1:27:01.000]  they had to suspend the program because the vaccine paralyzed and killed so many
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:06.920]  people well there were side effects and it was you know it did put a black mark
[1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:12.240]  on the vaccine and it was kind of a rushed vaccine because there was a lot
[1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:16.920]  of concern that was going to spread and it was going to be a repeat of 1918 but
[1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:20.760]  there's a big difference between what happened in 1976 and what happened at
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:25.880]  2009 well why is Obama served the Dr. Nyman saying he wants to take three or
[1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:30.080]  four will it be five next week or will we take shots every morning with our
[1:27:30.080 --> 1:27:35.360]  Wheaties or well here's here's the way the vaccines work I mean there's there's
[1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:41.360]  two different issues the swine that which is the pandemic the H1N1 which
[1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:47.000]  is causing the pandemic is a swine virus it's not a human virus the seasonal
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:51.520]  flu vaccine is called a trivalent vaccine because it's made of three
[1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:57.200]  different seasonal flu that's made of an H1N1 human and H3N2 human and
[1:27:57.200 --> 1:28:03.680]  influenza B so that is recommended you know on a yearly basis because the
[1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:09.080]  virus changes so quickly that the immunity that's generated by the vaccine
[1:28:09.080 --> 1:28:13.760]  one year generally doesn't carry over that efficiently to the next year because
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:19.720]  the virus has evolved and changed and that's what an annual flu vaccine is
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:24.400]  this one a year children getting it for the first time they take it twice
[1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:29.360]  because they need a booster and that's the seasonal flu and that's totally
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:34.240]  separate from the pandemic flu the pandemic flu is swine so there's not
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:39.520]  much if any it probably is no cross-reactivity but they've been saying
[1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:44.120]  it's not proper to even call it swine flu that's a political issue you know
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:51.440]  that not calling it swine is more of a more of a of a WHO
[1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:57.040]  political they're afraid that people are gonna go go around killing pigs that
[1:28:57.040 --> 1:29:03.000]  in the false belief that that is how it's transmitted and that's not I mean
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  the point is that the virus has jumped you know so now people that are getting
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:11.760]  infected with swine flu are not getting infected by pigs they're getting
[1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:16.640]  infected by other people doc you know what's funny back in January and
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:20.440]  February I had guests on emergency managers and people where they were
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:25.360]  getting ready for mass graves and flu pandemics this coming fall and then
[1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:29.840]  magically this all just pops up but don't worry they're there with shots in
[1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:34.160]  the army to take care of you just to clarify that was bird flu this is
[1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:38.920]  swine flu but we'll talk after the break well they're just building up this big

[1:33:04.200 --> 1:33:28.040]  I was getting into the mass graves the army getting ready the emergency
[1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:33.640]  managers back in January of this year and they were just saying flu whenever
[1:33:33.640 --> 1:33:38.600]  I would have the emergency managers on they said flu bird flu deadly flu and
[1:33:38.600 --> 1:33:41.760]  we see this huge infrastructure being built north com running drills
[1:33:41.760 --> 1:33:46.840]  everywhere major cities having regular army army reserve marines outrunning
[1:33:46.840 --> 1:33:52.320]  checkpoints building up this thing looks staged to me but it sounds like
[1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:56.080]  you're just going off the science and saying the flu looks like it could be a
[1:33:56.080 --> 1:34:00.600]  danger or it isn't a danger I mean explain this to me from your perspective
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:06.840]  and like I say I'd rather stick to the science you're getting to pandemic
[1:34:06.840 --> 1:34:12.560]  preparedness and you know the political side a little out of my area expertise
[1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:19.400]  but but just as a as a comment that the issue of potential pandemic from bird
[1:34:19.400 --> 1:34:26.080]  flu it's really been at the top of a lot of list going back to 2005 or so the
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:31.840]  swine flu really emerged I mean it's not that there hasn't been flu in swine
[1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:37.520]  before but the the transmission of the swine flu from human to human really
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:43.480]  became obvious in April of this year I'm sorry at March of this year the end of
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:50.120]  the end of March beginning of April and and that's when it became apparent that
[1:34:50.120 --> 1:34:55.800]  there was a pandemic nobody really do about the pandemic regarding swine
[1:34:55.800 --> 1:35:03.040]  until until April of this year but the reason is being taken quite seriously
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:09.840]  really has to do with with the history of the 1918 and that's really the reason
[1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:18.240]  there's been the the pandemic preparedness actually the the there's a
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:25.600]  law again it's getting a little bit out of my area but the declaring bird flu a
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:31.760]  quarantineable disease actually was was signed by President Bush back in April
[1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:39.720]  1st of 2005 and that coincided with health care workers dying in North
[1:35:39.720 --> 1:35:48.200]  North Vietnam as a result of H5 that one so the potential of a pandemic of one
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:54.320]  sort or another has been around you know for for several years now on in a very
[1:35:54.320 --> 1:36:01.520]  real way but the swine flu is kind of a different a little bit different than the
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:05.920]  bird flu it's harder for the birds to jump the human because that's avian
[1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:12.040]  mammal it's much easier for a swine because that's mammals a mammal so it
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:17.880]  it is quite a bit different from one species to the other but it is a species
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:24.040]  dump and that is what is causing the concern the and as far as the numbers
[1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:29.920]  are concerned you know there are they're quite a bit higher than 200 as far as
[1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:34.680]  depth they're concerned and there well hold on doctor let me stop you because I
[1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:38.800]  can pull these numbers up and I'm not saying you're wrong but the CDC three
[1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:42.920]  weeks ago said they're gonna stop reporting flu fatalities with the
[1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:47.160]  swine flu as it's known but I mean I mean let me just put this out there
[1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:52.800]  because I can pull up the CDC they say it was like 198 and then less than 2000 it
[1:36:52.800 --> 1:36:57.480]  was right at 2000 worldwide are you saying those are wrong numbers oh those
[1:36:57.480 --> 1:37:02.800]  are very low number you know that if you go to the real if you go to the flu
[1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:08.360]  tracker just Google flu tracker yeah that's your site isn't it right and it's
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:11.920]  got running total and I mean I know you're the big expert on the real
[1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:15.960]  numbers so that's why I brought this up tell us what the real numbers are well
[1:37:15.960 --> 1:37:22.400]  the real numbers well well here's a number that that'll probably you know
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:30.120]  get your attention and in Argentina in the last month or so there have been
[1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:35.200]  probably over a thousand that have died in that country alone and just the one
[1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:39.120]  month period the official numbers yesterday Argentina came out with
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:44.160]  official numbers and said that there were 337 dead and they said there were
[1:37:44.160 --> 1:37:48.920]  400 more that were dead but hadn't been tested so they admitted on their
[1:37:48.920 --> 1:37:54.360]  government website in Argentina that they were likely to be over 700 I've
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:37:58.280]  got boots on the ground actually in Argentina journalists who are actually
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:03.400]  doing stories for it's again mainstream media but they they are on the ground I
[1:38:03.400 --> 1:38:07.920]  do get reports back and they say it's over a thousand so where are you
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:11.160]  getting your numbers I mean how are you getting your numbers because I'm I keep
[1:38:11.160 --> 1:38:15.560]  hearing that well that it gets under reported some places but other times
[1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:21.840]  they they they listed as a swine flu but then later find out it wasn't no that
[1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:25.960]  that's pretty rare that they listed swine flu and find out it is that it's
[1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:29.720]  usually the other way around that the people test negative and then they
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:35.720]  deterred they just cover on autopsy that that it was swine flu the numbers most
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:40.360]  of the numbers that are used to flu track or actually come from government
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:46.800]  reports government the US is pulling back but just to clarify that they're
[1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:53.840]  pulling back mostly on the mild cases they used to report each state reported
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:58.800]  cases with quite a bit of detail on a county by county basis and they were
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:04.520]  reporting on a daily basis that went to a weekly basis as of the CDC recently
[1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:10.720]  announced that they were no longer going to be doing the the weekly and they
[1:39:10.720 --> 1:39:14.880]  weren't going to be doing it on a county by county because there were too many
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:18.880]  cases and they basically have been overwhelmed so they can't do the lab
[1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:23.400]  confirmed the cases I cited for Argentina actually comes from the
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:28.560]  government website in Argentina and it's written in Spanish but it is you know
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:33.400]  it's easily translated and the numbers there are quite real and they just came
[1:39:33.400 --> 1:39:37.240]  out with announcement yesterday it's dated August 5th again and their numbers
[1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:41.840]  have tended to be low and the evidence that their numbers are low is that in
[1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:47.160]  addition to the national site there are state sites or preventive provincial
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:51.600]  sites in Argentina and those numbers tend to be quite a bit higher I mean most
[1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:56.360]  of the deaths in Argentina are in the Buenos Aires region and there's another
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:02.080]  province Santa Fe which is right next to it a town Rosario and those are where
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:06.720]  most of the deaths at least have been reported and so they came out with a
[1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:13.600]  report yesterday and the report yesterday did list the 337 cases it broke
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:18.800]  them down by each of the provinces and then they noted that they are lagging and
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:22.440]  they've been lagging the whole time I mean Argentina is one of the places on
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:29.240]  the map that we actually include suspect because they basically don't become an
[1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:34.480]  official state an official case until they're tested by the official state
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:38.840]  lab so even if there's a private lab that has confirmed the case they won't
[1:40:38.840 --> 1:40:42.440]  count until they confirm it independently and there's so many cases
[1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:50.160]  that they're just very backlog so the 337 were lab confirmed cases and the
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:56.160]  400 were cases that essentially have the same features the flu even though it's
[1:40:56.160 --> 1:41:00.520]  flu season in the southern hemisphere now and so that's one of the reasons
[1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:05.160]  there's so much attention being played to the southern hemisphere because it's
[1:41:05.160 --> 1:41:09.960]  cold and it's flu season and it's kind of a preview of what's going to happen in
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:17.520]  the northern hemisphere starting in the fall and they you'll have a thousand
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:25.800]  a thousand people that have died and most of them are young adults they're there
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:32.000]  between the ages of 20 and 45 just like 1918 and about looking at your map doctor
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:39.680]  does this is there any evidence this is affecting people who racially have more
[1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:45.240]  melanin in their skin or is this appear that if you go look at the map you can
[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:52.080]  see that right now most of the cases are in the southern hemisphere so it did it
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:58.600]  in South America is in Australia and it's in New Zealand and now South Africa is
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:02.640]  starting to catch up is that because it's their flu season right now that
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:07.920]  that's right so so they're basically six months off from us so so they are
[1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:11.720]  really you know at the height of their or they're entering the height of their
[1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:17.520]  flu season but what's interesting and what the concern is that in places like
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:23.960]  Argentina almost all of the flu is swine flu so it basically has out
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:29.800]  competed seasonal flu normally at this time of the year there'll be an H1N1
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:35.120]  human and H3N2 human or influenza B all of those are being displaced by the
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:40.640]  swine flu okay sir what do you know 99% sure doctor that's a big number
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:45.680]  doctor what then do you project as a tracker what do you project the death
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:54.000]  rate is going to be like this flu season in the western countries a and b when
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:59.320]  do you see it peaking and then dissipating okay well you know the
[1:42:59.320 --> 1:43:05.800]  history from 1918 as a guide is it really started in the fall as far as
[1:43:05.800 --> 1:43:12.800]  changing over and becoming lethal and and therefore I mean the CDC has
[1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:17.240]  acknowledged that the number of cases in the United States is well over a
[1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:22.000]  million and and and it really started at the end of the flu season I mean when
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:27.560]  when flu really got going in the US it was really in April and May and flu
[1:43:27.560 --> 1:43:33.040]  season pretty much over the flu season pretty much peaks in February in the
[1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:37.480]  United States and by April it's just about gone and it's totally gone in May
[1:43:37.480 --> 1:43:42.920]  in the United States is the same thing 99% of any flu that is happening right
[1:43:42.920 --> 1:43:49.960]  now is the swine flu and and the virus is evolving so there's a little bit of a
[1:43:49.960 --> 1:43:57.640]  clue by what's going on in South America and in Australia and you can look at
[1:43:57.640 --> 1:44:03.880]  the at the website for the flu trackers and and see what kind of numbers are
[1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:10.920]  showing up and and we we have a daily plot of the death and you know is the
[1:44:10.920 --> 1:44:15.000]  daily pot is a little bit uneven because you know like I say the state of the
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:18.680]  government's aren't really reporting daily they're reporting weekly so
[1:44:18.680 --> 1:44:25.280]  sometimes you get some spikes but the biggest number of deaths in a day was
[1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:30.640]  yesterday and if you look at the map it's over 80 so over 80 people either died
[1:44:30.640 --> 1:44:35.360]  or reported as died on yesterday and that's the highest it has been so far
[1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:41.080]  we're gonna change the map over the graph a little bit right now it's daily and
[1:44:41.080 --> 1:44:46.440]  it doesn't look as dramatic as it is because the numbers have been high for
[1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:51.320]  about a month now we only show a month but when we switch it over to the weekly
[1:44:51.320 --> 1:44:56.360]  you'll be able to see that there were very few deaths back in May in June and
[1:44:56.360 --> 1:45:02.200]  then it started to go up in July and now it's higher than ever so how many deaths
[1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:08.440]  in the United States again I've got it in front of me for the for the world the
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:15.440]  fatalities worldwide are 1727 right now the United States I think we've got
[1:45:15.440 --> 1:45:23.680]  around 350 so there's 350 that have been either confirmed by lab test well
[1:45:23.680 --> 1:45:27.240]  they've all been confirmed by less than 2,000 worldwide I mean if they're in
[1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:32.760]  their peak season down in the other hemisphere and regular flu kills 30
[1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:36.280]  plus thousand a year in the U.S. alone this sounds like an incredibly weak
[1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:44.640]  flu no it's it's it's a any policy it just jumped okay so don't lose according
[1:45:44.640 --> 1:45:47.960]  to other doctors but you're an expert so I mean I'm not here I'm not disagreeing
[1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:51.280]  I'm just asking a lot of other virologists and doctors we talked to say
[1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:58.320]  that flues tend to mutate into something less lethal on average they're
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:04.520]  mostly talking about these all flu and I mean this virus is already fairly
[1:46:04.520 --> 1:46:12.960]  efficiently transmitted so it is dumb species from swine to human and it's an
[1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:17.480]  airborne transmission yeah yeah I mean you that that's why they're all these
[1:46:17.480 --> 1:46:24.040]  outbreak schools in the summer camps now is easily transmitted and the virus
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:30.440]  because it is now adapting to humans so it is been in swine it just got into
[1:46:30.440 --> 1:46:35.480]  humans you know a few months ago and as it goes get to the humans it can
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:41.480]  interact with human flu and human flu is more efficient at transmitting and
[1:46:41.480 --> 1:46:45.640]  growing as though this virus can so you're saying it can mutate with the
[1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:51.080]  with the regular flu right it can mutate with the regular flu and adapt to
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:56.360]  humans let me ask you this you saw the story about Baxter and the in the European
[1:46:56.360 --> 1:47:02.480]  countries mixing it in and then I want you to comment on that but then we've
[1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:06.560]  also seen reports and we've had doctors on and read the reports that they're
[1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:11.280]  saying the testing of the vaccine the headline was live attenuated I don't
[1:47:11.280 --> 1:47:15.720]  maybe explain that yeah but but but the issue is some are saying it could
[1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:21.520]  mutate easily in the body and incubate something new or merge with other
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:27.200]  seasonal flues right well here is here's a couple different issues because
[1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:31.000]  they're kind of taking bits of pieces and not really putting together very well
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:36.800]  as far as Baxter is concerned Baxter was a was an error in the lab it was not a
[1:47:36.800 --> 1:47:43.040]  vaccine that was you know being you know certified to go into humans it was
[1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:48.440]  basically it was actually a vector so that though Baxter yeah but why was it
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:54.080]  mislabeled this this this super powerful bird flu is then mixed mixed in right
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:58.400]  there was it was a contaminant that's why I say that's what the accident is it
[1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:04.480]  was supposed to be a vector for H3N2 seasonal flu so it was supposed to be
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:12.080]  there was it was sold to a company in in Europe that then distributed to it and
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:15.320]  then they accidentally lied to homeless people and injected them and they died
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:19.160]  a lot of accidents happening here well that was another company with the dead
[1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:24.600]  homeless with the bird flu that was that was a trial and I'm not I don't have the
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:29.280]  details about that one as much as I know about Baxter but Baxter was a was a
[1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:34.720]  experimental vector that got contaminated at Baxter I mean Baxter does make a
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:40.760]  pandemic H5N1 vaccine and I would say somewhere along the lines at the plant
[1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:45.720]  it happened it wasn't supposed to be there that nobody knew it was there
[1:48:45.720 --> 1:48:51.080]  until they actually injected the ferris the ferris died and essentially they
[1:48:51.080 --> 1:48:55.160]  basically you know made correction so that's not gonna happen again but but
[1:48:55.160 --> 1:49:00.320]  it wasn't in the vaccine that was you know being cut you know being prepared
[1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:05.440]  for humans this was an experimental lab version which isn't going to have as
[1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:10.520]  many controls as the is the version that actually goes to the people and and it
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:14.560]  got contaminated they found out when it went into the ferris as far as the
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:19.800]  vaccines themselves are concerned vaccines have already shipped the
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:25.520]  vaccine for the pandemic that is already shipped by several companies is really
[1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:33.200]  the same as the seasonal flu it is not a live vaccine it's not an attenuated
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:39.160]  vaccine it's a killed vaccine so this vaccine this virus is killed there's
[1:49:39.160 --> 1:49:44.720]  nothing alive in the vaccine and it's just like the trivalent seasonal flu
[1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:48.760]  that and it can't create any mutations I wonder why I have news articles then are
[1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:54.400]  they mistaken doctor where they say that it's live there's there's several
[1:49:54.400 --> 1:49:59.560]  different versions I I'm talking about the vaccine did this ship though they
[1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:03.480]  already made that hundred ninety five million doses I see that headline US
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:07.560]  government orders a hundred ninety five million dosages two weeks ago are you
[1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:12.680]  saying they've already shipped that no I think they've shipped part of that but
[1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:17.320]  how does it protect us doctor if you're saying it's going to mutate well it
[1:50:17.320 --> 1:50:22.960]  depends on it really comes out on how fast the virus mutates and how similar
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:27.800]  the virus is in the fall or in the winter relative to the virus that was used
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:33.960]  in the back seat the vaccine that is shipping is called California 7 it was
[1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:39.040]  isolated and one of the first ones in California we're on a break yes sir we

[1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:33.760]  the eight after the breakdown what's happening in the economy right now in
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:38.960]  this segment the next we are continuing with Dr. Henry L. Nyman a flu tracker we
[1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:43.520]  got that up on screen for everybody right there okay sir so am I getting this
[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:47.520]  right then you're saying this could be big this could be real we should roll up
[1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:52.880]  our sleeves take the three to four to five injections or whatever well let me
[1:55:52.880 --> 1:55:56.480]  get let me straighten out the injection part you know so that's a little bit
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:01.680]  clear but yes it definitely is real and I would definitely recommend a
[1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:06.560]  vaccination you know there are some people that might have allergies to
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:11.840]  AIDS the current vaccine is grown in age so the same warnings for the pandemic
[1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:16.000]  vaccine would apply you know are the same as that for the seasonal flu
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:23.600]  vaccine but the number of injections just to clarify that the pandemic flu people
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:29.440]  have not seen that before that's because it's twine so the the recommendations
[1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:34.160]  will be to actually have two shots it would have be a first shot followed three
[1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:39.040]  weeks later by a booster shot that's the same thing that is used for children the
[1:56:39.040 --> 1:56:43.280]  first time they get seasonal flu so the first time they're immunized their two
[1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:49.760]  shots recommended after that is the once a year shot so the pandemic vaccine is
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:55.760]  really the same as the seasonal there there are other versions you know that
[1:56:55.760 --> 1:57:00.800]  may come down the line there's in seasonal there is an attenuated virus
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:07.360]  which is a live vaccine is made by metamune the virus is crippled and it is
[1:57:07.360 --> 1:57:13.200]  it's the you can tell the apart the attenuated vaccine is a myth you know it's
[1:57:13.200 --> 1:57:18.080]  something that you spray into your nose and that is different than the kill
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:24.560]  vaccine which is a shot metamune is working on a pandemic version that is
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:29.360]  not available the last I looked at their website they don't expect that to be
[1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:36.320]  available till 2010 and you know that's a a different vaccine and then I'm sure
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:39.440]  that some of your listeners are have heard about adjuvant and they're
[1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:44.320]  concerned about adjuvant adjuvant is something that stimulates the immune
[1:57:44.320 --> 1:57:49.920]  system the current vaccines do not have adjuvant the seasonal flu has no
[1:57:49.920 --> 1:57:55.920]  adjuvant and the pandemic vaccine that is shipped as adjuvant the reason adjuvant
[1:57:55.920 --> 1:58:01.760]  are used is that there's a there's a tendency for a better immune response
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:04.960]  but wait a minute are you saying are you saying the the big order the
[1:58:04.960 --> 1:58:07.920]  government made doesn't have adjuvants because I saw that it did
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:12.080]  no it does not have as well I mean in so many of the studies I've seen by
[1:58:12.080 --> 1:58:15.360]  my research firms and medical doctors it's the adjuvants that are worse than
[1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:18.480]  the thomerosal causing autoimmune responses my
[1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:23.120]  marisol is an adjuvant my marisol I said I said
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:27.760]  no I know I said I said the the adjuvants are causing a bigger response
[1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:31.120]  than the mercury that's what I was saying right but the adjuvant
[1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:35.840]  are not in the vaccine that is shipped there are there are potential
[1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:40.000]  vaccines that will have the adjuvant stay there got a break sir back in 70
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:50.480]  seconds thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN Live.com today
[1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:53.760]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[1:58:53.760 --> 1:58:57.040]  buying a solar power generator this summer number one new climate
[1:58:57.040 --> 1:58:59.760]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:58:59.760 --> 1:59:04.240]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[1:59:04.240 --> 1:59:07.680]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:59:07.680 --> 1:59:10.720]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:59:10.720 --> 1:59:14.400]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:59:14.400 --> 1:59:17.280]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:59:17.280 --> 1:59:20.800]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:59:20.800 --> 1:59:23.840]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:59:23.840 --> 1:59:27.040]  outages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:59:27.040 --> 1:59:30.560]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[1:59:30.560 --> 1:59:33.920]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science a long time

[1:59:51.280 --> 2:00:00.320]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:00:05.280 --> 2:00:11.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[2:00:11.680 --> 2:00:18.960]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from
[2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:27.600]  austin texas alex jones
[2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:30.720]  well i really appreciate him coming on we've been having a lively discussion
[2:00:30.720 --> 2:00:35.200]  dr henry l neiman highly recommended prestigious researcher
[2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:38.720]  venner many of the major technologies used today and
[2:00:38.720 --> 2:00:43.440]  researching all this and treating it i hope he's wrong though i mean i don't
[2:00:43.440 --> 2:00:46.080]  want this to be a real deadly flu i mean i know it's deadly for those that are
[2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:50.400]  being dying but you've got the flu season raging right now and a few thousand dead
[2:00:50.400 --> 2:00:54.640]  or 1700 and something that doesn't sound like
[2:00:54.640 --> 2:00:58.000]  a big deal to me but he's saying it could mutate
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:04.320]  so are you saying dr it's bad now or it could be potentially mega bad i mean i
[2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:06.880]  just want to be clear on that
[2:01:06.880 --> 2:01:11.600]  well then let me explain why it's bad now and why it could get much worse
[2:01:11.600 --> 2:01:16.880]  um seasonal flu um you know the number thrown out is 36 000
[2:01:16.880 --> 2:01:20.560]  united states die 90 percent of the people that die
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:24.160]  from the flu in the united states and worldwide
[2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:27.520]  are 65 years or older most of those people
[2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:31.120]  are actually quite a bit more than 65 they're a nursing home
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:34.880]  they're basically have very serious illnesses
[2:01:34.880 --> 2:01:38.800]  they get the flu and the flu kind of puts it over the top they really can't
[2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:41.920]  now they could respond to the compromise right
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:45.440]  right there they're compromised in many ways and that's who
[2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:50.560]  normally dies from the flu the people that are dying from the flu today those
[2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:54.400]  those 1000 people that died in argentina
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:02:01.120]  they are previously healthy young adults so i mean is this like the 1918 then
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:05.200]  that it has that hemorrhagic effect yeah i mean there are there are reports
[2:02:05.200 --> 2:02:08.720]  actually i was just reading what i was trying to find out where it was
[2:02:08.720 --> 2:02:12.240]  where um patient actually turned blue overnight
[2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:15.760]  and died you know and that's those are those are the
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:19.760]  characteristics of 1918 there's this diagnosis
[2:02:19.760 --> 2:02:23.920]  basically the person literally turns blue
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:28.400]  and ends up dying suddenly i mean there are reports in 1918 of people
[2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:31.600]  that basically were sitting down and playing bridge
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:35.360]  and they literally fell over and died at the bridge table yeah you know because
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:39.840]  it has this huge autoimmune response right right but but doctor doctor
[2:02:39.840 --> 2:02:44.160]  and and here's why that's a problem for this year
[2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:50.480]  okay because the virus is adapting so it really doesn't take a whole lot of
[2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:55.040]  change that the virus is actually growing at twice the rate that it is
[2:02:55.040 --> 2:02:59.040]  right now it's gonna elicit a much greater
[2:02:59.040 --> 2:03:03.440]  autoimmune response oh god it's gonna grow quickly
[2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:06.560]  and people are going to respond to it and that's this
[2:03:06.560 --> 2:03:12.560]  this cytokine storm that's this cascade and that's why people end up dying
[2:03:12.560 --> 2:03:15.120]  okay let me just stop because we're almost out of time it's clear i've got to
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:17.440]  have you back up i'm very appreciative of your time
[2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:22.320]  i hope you're wrong uh because you know i got family
[2:03:22.320 --> 2:03:25.280]  and i live here in texas it seems to be one of the epicenters
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:28.480]  for all of this and i don't trust these vaccines i've seen with
[2:03:28.480 --> 2:03:32.080]  their history what they do and this whole thing has
[2:03:32.080 --> 2:03:34.960]  stage written all over it i know you don't get into
[2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:38.720]  areas like that you just cover the facts that you can document but
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:44.800]  i've had a bad feeling all along for the last year in the buildup to this and
[2:03:44.800 --> 2:03:48.080]  are you saying doc with your educated opinion you've got a bad feeling about
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:52.080]  this year yes i've said it looks like 1918 for
[2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:55.440]  the last several months and there has been nothing in the last
[2:03:55.440 --> 2:03:58.560]  several months to take it off the 1918 track
[2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:03.520]  my god it was tracking then it's following the exact same track right now
[2:04:03.520 --> 2:04:08.560]  in texas you know there's there's likely to be cami flu resistance in texas
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:12.560]  there there was a report that came out a day or so ago on the border
[2:04:12.560 --> 2:04:17.760]  um by a used to chronicle there's now the uh right and and and that indicated
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:22.000]  there were several um uh verses that were at cami flu resistance
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:26.560]  there's a sequence that that uh just came out that actually isn't even
[2:04:26.560 --> 2:04:30.560]  it's only semi-public um they show cami flu resistance in
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:34.400]  singapore and that's kind of create another problem that we can talk about
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:37.680]  next time around well dr. neiman let me get you up then in the next few weeks as
[2:04:37.680 --> 2:04:41.200]  this unfolds when do you see it and quickly really starting to break out
[2:04:41.200 --> 2:04:44.400]  then october i would say yeah you'll see the first
[2:04:44.400 --> 2:04:48.480]  time december october you know in the northern hemisphere i think it will get
[2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:53.120]  worse in the southern hemisphere before that all right dr. neiman the

[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:52.560]  before we get into goldman sacks and all this out of the gates here
[2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:59.840]  curveball it's max keiser curveball it's a knuckleball but but seriously
[2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:04.640]  the flu situation troops everywhere mass graves they denied it a year ago now
[2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:08.480]  they admit it forced inoculations talks of lockdown
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:14.480]  only less than 2000 dead worldwide uh they are really hyping this thing really
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:18.160]  trying to scare people this looks like to me the perfect cover
[2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:21.440]  to get their carbon tax through to get their open borders through their gun
[2:10:21.440 --> 2:10:25.520]  control their government health care that they're trying to push through in
[2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:32.400]  october what does max keiser's spidey sense tell him
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:39.680]  well you know i mean i'm all about the banking and finance systems you know i
[2:10:39.680 --> 2:10:46.000]  mean that's what i cover as far as the whole swine flu epidemic
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:49.520]  you know i'm an idiot because i go to the drug store every day
[2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:54.960]  and i buy is that um you stuff for your hands to disinfect my hands of course
[2:10:54.960 --> 2:10:57.360]  i was laughing at those people a year ago
[2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:01.840]  but you know it's a herd mentality you know how much did they they charge eight
[2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:06.080]  dollars for like uh uh you know a squirt of that stuff over here
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:09.920]  think of the profits that are being generated it's all herd mentality people
[2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:13.840]  like i go to these meet friends and they're like sharing these things
[2:11:13.840 --> 2:11:18.160]  uh little antiseptic gel i mean it's pathetic i mean you know you fall into
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:22.800]  the behavior that is uh inculcated through this massive
[2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:28.160]  wave of uh of scare tactics everything can be sold using scare tactics now they
[2:11:28.160 --> 2:11:33.520]  figured that out you know shotgun or uh 9-11 if you scare enough people they
[2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:37.360]  can scare you into buying anything now why bother coming up with a creative
[2:11:37.360 --> 2:11:41.120]  campaign to sell stuff we need to show people getting blown up and then you'll
[2:11:41.120 --> 2:11:44.640]  sell a truckload of whatever it is you're trying to sell you know it's all it's all
[2:11:44.640 --> 2:11:48.960]  salesmanship it's like just basically you know uh
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:52.880]  infomercials for psychosis and mass destruction
[2:11:52.880 --> 2:11:56.720]  and they'll sell anything down the pike but um you know i want to talk about
[2:11:56.720 --> 2:12:01.600]  uh goldman sacks for a second because it's just gotten so hilarious it's gotten
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:05.280]  ridiculous it's gotten absurd if that's okay by you
[2:12:05.280 --> 2:12:11.760]  yeah let's get into 23.7 trillion missing in 10 months uh they're refusing to
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:15.840]  say where the money went paulson gets up before congress last week and says
[2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:19.360]  yeah i took 200 million myself that's not a conflict
[2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:24.160]  of money he gave himself i mean this is a new level of heist
[2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:27.760]  uh you're an expert in all this break it down for us and then i want to get into
[2:12:27.760 --> 2:12:32.400]  they say the economy's fixed everything's wonderful the stock market's going up
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:38.160]  but housing at all time low uh Reuters reporting that half of us mortgages seen
[2:12:38.160 --> 2:12:43.200]  underwater by 2011 record joblessness all of
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:46.720]  that is degrading quickly but they're meanwhile saying
[2:12:46.720 --> 2:12:50.960]  maria entranette let them all eat birthday cake
[2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:55.200]  let's just talk about a couple of things here one how do you saw this or not the
[2:12:55.200 --> 2:13:01.120]  high frequency trading scandal high frequency trading which is now
[2:13:01.120 --> 2:13:05.280]  being talked about and that's special little computer tell us about that
[2:13:05.280 --> 2:13:09.600]  yeah this is really amazing now just to give you an analogy here
[2:13:09.600 --> 2:13:13.040]  if you go into uh if you saw somebody your neighbor
[2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:17.040]  and they had a rubber hose in your neighbor's gas tank
[2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:21.280]  and he had that hose and it was over a uh a bucket
[2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:24.720]  and he was stealing gas from your you know you'd say hey buddy
[2:13:24.720 --> 2:13:28.880]  you know don't steal our neighbor's gas that's not very nice that's not very
[2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:32.240]  social behavior he's siphoning off gas right
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:36.720]  basically and it happens they don't even argue they don't they don't deny this
[2:13:36.720 --> 2:13:40.400]  golden fax over at 85 broad street is where they have
[2:13:40.400 --> 2:13:44.640]  their headquarters down there on wall street they co-located a server
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:49.280]  next to the new york stock exchange and they use this high frequency trading
[2:13:49.280 --> 2:13:53.600]  to siphon off depending on whose estimates you read between a hundred
[2:13:53.600 --> 2:13:57.760]  million and two hundred million dollars a day they're just siphoning cash directly
[2:13:57.760 --> 2:14:00.640]  off the floor and that's what we know of with a computer
[2:14:00.640 --> 2:14:05.200]  program plugged in secretly uh rigging the market
[2:14:05.200 --> 2:14:09.440]  but that's okay because they're allowed to give themselves the bonus money
[2:14:09.440 --> 2:14:13.440]  while their former executives are the treasury sack
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:17.600]  they claim that they're quote unquote adding liquidity
[2:14:17.600 --> 2:14:21.520]  to the system so if you caught a guy siphoning gas from a car
[2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:27.120]  and his defense was no i'm i'm adding gas to the car
[2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:31.200]  so they say hey goldman you're siphoning money from the floor of the exchange
[2:14:31.200 --> 2:14:35.360]  using high frequency trading using all this proprietary algorithms
[2:14:35.360 --> 2:14:38.560]  uh which i know a lot about because i created the the virtual specialist
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:42.320]  technology is used to trade bonds by uh cancer Fitzgerald on wall street is
[2:14:42.320 --> 2:14:45.600]  used by the hollywood stock exchange to trade box office features and i
[2:14:45.600 --> 2:14:48.960]  designed these systems so i know all about these systems and it
[2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:52.560]  basically it's nothing more than siphoning off cash and and barney
[2:14:52.560 --> 2:14:56.240]  frank says oh a little profit sharing is okay
[2:14:56.240 --> 2:14:59.680]  we need we need the banks on wall street to have a little profit sharing
[2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:04.000]  because after all if the banks aren't healthy the economy is not healthy
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:07.840]  so the entire economy 23.7 trail of our money
[2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:10.800]  that we have to pay interest to them on oh here's our money and we pay you
[2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:14.320]  interest to take our money then it turns out the fed is paying banks
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:18.400]  not the loan because they want to consolidate and blow out the economy
[2:15:18.400 --> 2:15:22.560]  is there no end well i mean we'll we'll uh geithner soon be barbecuing
[2:15:22.560 --> 2:15:27.200]  children is lawn and we say well he's got to eat the economy will collapse if we
[2:15:27.200 --> 2:15:31.520]  don't feed him our children in fact let me ask you that question why is he in
[2:15:31.520 --> 2:15:35.520]  the wall street journal and other pub papers screaming and cussing and yelling
[2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:39.680]  at bernacky and freaking out are they scared of the uh auditing the fed i
[2:15:39.680 --> 2:15:42.240]  mean bernacky suddenly on tv stuttering and
[2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:46.320]  bumbling uh these omnipresent mount olympus elites are now
[2:15:46.320 --> 2:15:50.720]  coming and groveling i mean are we seeing the momentum shift
[2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:55.600]  against their uh criminal activity he's upset because now that he works for the
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:15:58.960]  government his life for the bonus pool is smaller
[2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:02.000]  he's also these guys to give him more money
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:05.600]  he's upset he can't sell his house in large martin new york which by the way
[2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:09.280]  his house the large one is he's less than a mile than where i grew up
[2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:12.480]  in westchester county i used to ride my bicycle by his
[2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:16.000]  his house all the time he said he can't sell his house because of the economic
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:19.040]  problems that he himself helped create and now that
[2:16:19.040 --> 2:16:23.200]  paulson successfully ransomed the government for 700 billion
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:26.720]  and which became 13 trillion he's now paying himself he's working with the
[2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:29.520]  chinese to manage their money he's going to make billions again
[2:16:29.520 --> 2:16:33.200]  but he took the job for the government of course he said well i had to sell my
[2:16:33.200 --> 2:16:37.200]  goldman stock stock at close to it's all time high
[2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:39.840]  by the way because i'm working for the government i don't pay taxes on that
[2:16:39.840 --> 2:16:42.960]  game so his whole role as a as a servant for the
[2:16:42.960 --> 2:16:46.800]  government was a tax dodge paulson was just a tax dodger he
[2:16:46.800 --> 2:16:51.360]  he saved something like a hundred million in taxes by taking that job
[2:16:51.360 --> 2:16:54.880]  worked for a couple of years engineered the collapse of
[2:16:54.880 --> 2:16:58.400]  leeman brothers and barristers took away all the competition from golden and jp
[2:16:58.400 --> 2:17:03.440]  morgan and his crony buddies and uh... got rid of his arch enemy dick fold over
[2:17:03.440 --> 2:17:06.960]  leeman brothers it was nothing but a grudge match between those two
[2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:11.760]  they could have easily out this is the tragedy of it going back to what i call
[2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:16.160]  the ninth of august or eight nine which is right up there with nine eleven
[2:17:16.160 --> 2:17:20.640]  two years ago the ninth of august two years ago in two thousand seven is when
[2:17:20.640 --> 2:17:25.200]  bnp and paris said that the uh... they couldn't value the subprime
[2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:29.680]  bonds on their books and that started what we call the credit crash
[2:17:29.680 --> 2:17:33.280]  uh... for the next twenty four months the response from the government was not
[2:17:33.280 --> 2:17:36.720]  to reform the banking system but they give them now what we know to be
[2:17:36.720 --> 2:17:40.080]  roughly thirteen trillion dollars according to godlike carl denninger who's
[2:17:40.080 --> 2:17:43.200]  a very plugged in guy that number is going to double again
[2:17:43.200 --> 2:17:46.880]  and the tragedy is that they could have very easily wiped out every mortgage
[2:17:46.880 --> 2:17:50.960]  debt and every credit card that in america for less than that money
[2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:54.560]  well yeah i mean uh... bloomberg reported nine point four trillion would pay
[2:17:54.560 --> 2:17:57.280]  off all mortgages not just bad mortgages but
[2:17:57.280 --> 2:18:01.840]  you know fifty million dollar palaces hundred thousand dollar bungalows
[2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:05.680]  everything paid off but but now you're saying thirteen
[2:18:05.680 --> 2:18:09.280]  uh... the congress and the banks are saying twenty three point seven but i
[2:18:09.280 --> 2:18:12.080]  guess that's different types of money they created and that's not counting all
[2:18:12.080 --> 2:18:17.520]  the magical sdr's and these other layers of global currency
[2:18:17.520 --> 2:18:21.360]  yeah but okay but get back to this point because it's a very important point
[2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:24.640]  every single mortgage in america could have been paid off
[2:18:24.640 --> 2:18:28.720]  every single credit card debt could have been paid off so therefore he had any
[2:18:28.720 --> 2:18:31.360]  every citizen in america could be sitting there with no debts
[2:18:31.360 --> 2:18:35.040]  at all they'd have their credit card they'd be in the mall shopping
[2:18:35.040 --> 2:18:38.000]  the economy is seventy percent consumption anyway so the economy would be
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:41.440]  growing the jobs would be growing not collapsing
[2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:44.400]  the banks would actually be still making some money because they're still in the
[2:18:44.400 --> 2:18:47.600]  business of making loans the world you'd have left are
[2:18:47.600 --> 2:18:51.600]  these incredible black hole of debt which would have to be addressed in the
[2:18:51.600 --> 2:18:55.200]  way to address that would have been to force the banks to
[2:18:55.200 --> 2:18:58.480]  write off those debts in real time and suffer the consequences because they
[2:18:58.480 --> 2:19:01.600]  created those debts so instead of like warren boffett
[2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:05.520]  who's now just saying i'm gonna have to block buster corner of my life because
[2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:08.080]  seventy five percent of his business is tied to getting bailed out by the
[2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:12.480]  government it's not going from seventy thousand dollars a share back to a
[2:19:12.480 --> 2:19:15.680]  hundred thousand dollars a share back to a hundred and forty seven thousand
[2:19:15.680 --> 2:19:18.720]  dollars a share if you want to buy one share
[2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:23.120]  of berkshire hathaway stock of warren boffett and be part of the global elite
[2:19:23.120 --> 2:19:26.960]  you need a hundred forty seven thousand dollars to buy one one right at a
[2:19:26.960 --> 2:19:30.480]  hundred thousand dollars well i was reading that he got ninety eight
[2:19:30.480 --> 2:19:35.600]  billion in bailout money unless you have a hundred thousand dollars to buy
[2:19:35.600 --> 2:19:39.840]  one share of berkshire hathaway stock of warren boffett then you forget it you're
[2:19:39.840 --> 2:19:44.560]  not part you're not going to be part of the true economy that's run by all
[2:19:44.560 --> 2:19:47.040]  these insiders so you're sitting there holding your
[2:19:47.040 --> 2:19:50.480]  you know 50 shares of some over-the-counter nasdaq dot com
[2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:54.320]  bomb that was sold to you by some hard-selling telephone salesman working
[2:19:54.320 --> 2:19:57.680]  on commission of course that's going to go to zero the whole cycle is repeated
[2:19:57.680 --> 2:20:01.360]  max stay there boffett deserves all the money
[2:20:01.360 --> 2:20:05.520]  it's a new year full of uncertainties people are being laid off in record
[2:20:05.520 --> 2:20:08.480]  numbers the price of food continues to rise
[2:20:08.480 --> 2:20:12.640]  and the economy continues to falter you know that you need to prepare
[2:20:12.640 --> 2:20:16.480]  and maybe you've been putting it off but the time to act is now

[2:24:21.600 --> 2:24:28.480]  joining us from paris capital of france max keiser max keiser.com he is in my
[2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:34.160]  big new upcoming obama film max you got cut off there by the break
[2:24:34.160 --> 2:24:37.440]  uh obama's approval ratings gone from the mid eighties
[2:24:37.440 --> 2:24:40.400]  to now the mid 40s depending on which poll you look at
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:44.320]  he's now lower than bush lower than jimmy carter
[2:24:44.320 --> 2:24:48.160]  uh than they were at this point seven months into their administration
[2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:51.440]  what do you see happening to obama over the next few years
[2:24:51.440 --> 2:24:54.960]  i mean i'm almost as feeling sorry for him now because you know when he's this
[2:24:54.960 --> 2:24:58.320]  big star and they're pushing the corporate agenda through on him
[2:24:58.320 --> 2:25:01.520]  you know he's dangerous and i had to oppose him and i still do
[2:25:01.520 --> 2:25:06.800]  but now that everything's being blamed on him and almost he almost becomes a
[2:25:06.800 --> 2:25:14.800]  shield for the uh bankers it then you need to do a guide norectomy
[2:25:14.800 --> 2:25:18.400]  you know look at tony blare over there in the uk when he left number 10
[2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:22.640]  downing street after all the dodgy dossier after all the
[2:25:22.640 --> 2:25:26.640]  fake rhetoric leading up to the invasion after telling the two million
[2:25:26.640 --> 2:25:29.040]  people that were in the streets in britain that they didn't want to get
[2:25:29.040 --> 2:25:32.240]  into the iraq war within 10 minutes of leaving number 10
[2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:35.920]  downing street in disgrace where they end up jp morgan
[2:25:35.920 --> 2:25:39.600]  okay the presidency is now used as a resume
[2:25:39.600 --> 2:25:42.960]  sweetener so whether it's one term or two terms
[2:25:42.960 --> 2:25:47.040]  the next step for obama is goldman's act or jp morgan and that's the true end
[2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:49.920]  game that's the goal for these guys that's where they cash in the presidency
[2:25:49.920 --> 2:25:53.440]  is just a fancy thing on your resume now it doesn't mean anything
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:25:58.160]  in terms of public service anymore well it means you can read off a teleprompter
[2:25:58.160 --> 2:26:01.600]  good that's why bush was so hated is that he couldn't sit there with puppy
[2:26:01.600 --> 2:26:05.520]  dog eyes lovingly lying to you but uh you know you're right for the
[2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:08.880]  heaven and post you deal with some of the classical type liberals out there
[2:26:08.880 --> 2:26:12.400]  it seems a lot of them are starting to wake up those that are honest
[2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:15.600]  like yourself who had supported obama but then
[2:26:15.600 --> 2:26:21.200]  when you talk to uh other democrats or progressives or whatever they just
[2:26:21.200 --> 2:26:24.400]  scream you're a racist like they're now saying
[2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:30.560]  that the archetypal uh poster of obama socialism we've changed it to
[2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:34.160]  obama fascism because we believe that's closer to what it actually is
[2:26:34.160 --> 2:26:38.560]  they're now saying that's racist uh when one has nothing to do with race this
[2:26:38.560 --> 2:26:42.080]  this this parroting race race race over and over again isn't working
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:44.800]  the media is also trying to claim its partisan
[2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:47.600]  so the establishment's throwing democrats under the bus
[2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:51.280]  or under the train trying to say all these congressmen getting shouted down at
[2:26:51.280 --> 2:26:54.480]  town halls or only democrats i've i've tracked it
[2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:59.360]  they're shouting the republicans down too so this is something completely new
[2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:03.920]  it looks like the united states is on the verge of revolution max geyser
[2:27:03.920 --> 2:27:06.800]  well we've been saying that for a few years that
[2:27:06.800 --> 2:27:10.400]  the the wealth and income gap is getting wider
[2:27:10.400 --> 2:27:14.560]  and wider the amount of wealth controlled by the top one percent
[2:27:14.560 --> 2:27:17.760]  is just getting wider and wider the past six months
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:21.680]  in the past two years has been nothing more than
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:26.160]  the wall street banks and other banks around the world and the central banks
[2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:29.520]  getting together and and grabbing more power
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:32.880]  and more wealth there is a new york time story i think it was today or
[2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:37.040]  yesterday where uh loy blank fine the new ceo of golden
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:41.360]  sacks is saying what crisis there was no crisis we were never in jeopardy
[2:27:41.360 --> 2:27:44.400]  we're just doing we're just smart we're doing business like we've always done
[2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:46.480]  it you know ours you know here's the thing
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:49.600]  about the stock market rally all that money that goes into the stock market
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:52.800]  rally the three trillion dollar rally that that money
[2:27:52.800 --> 2:27:56.160]  was it's not coming from the money market funds
[2:27:56.160 --> 2:28:00.640]  which would be an indication that the public is involved in the stock market
[2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:06.480]  this money is coming from the bailout funds and it's being not used to lend to
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:09.520]  businessmen and people in america to help them get through this crisis is being
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:14.000]  used as speculative capital by the banks to make money in the stock market
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:18.720]  and once this rally which is fed by the spec money the bailout money is being
[2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:21.680]  used by the speculators on wall street to speculate the stock market it caught
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:24.880]  everyone flat-footed it was up 50 percent or something like this is the
[2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:28.720]  biggest rally since the 1930s oh by the way that's very significant if you want
[2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:33.040]  to think about it and now that the uh you've got this uh
[2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:37.280]  cnbc and uh jim kramer now pounding the table they're going to sit just another
[2:28:37.280 --> 2:28:39.920]  suckers rally where they're going to come in people are going to be buying this
[2:28:39.920 --> 2:28:42.160]  thing again and they're going to be buying it at the top
[2:28:42.160 --> 2:28:45.680]  again and they're going to be asking for a bailout again in another six months
[2:28:45.680 --> 2:28:49.600]  so the cycle repeats itself nobody ever learns anything because
[2:28:49.600 --> 2:28:54.240]  if you have a rising stock market it tends to cloud people thinking they're
[2:28:54.240 --> 2:28:57.680]  willing to overlook everything and anything if they think they can buy a
[2:28:57.680 --> 2:29:01.120]  winning lottery ticket people just ignore their own self-interest
[2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:05.040]  and they go loopy they add the drugs the antidepressants
[2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:10.480]  and the failure to have a decent diet and you just have a sick zombie
[2:29:10.480 --> 2:29:14.080]  nation of speculators who are trying to be the next partner of goldman sacks and
[2:29:14.080 --> 2:29:17.680]  the chances of that are like being the next winner on american idol
[2:29:17.680 --> 2:29:22.160]  second you called that you called that uh the
[2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:26.960]  casino gulag model the casino gulag model and i concur with you 100 percent
[2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:30.000]  they're taking all the tens of trillions they've stolen from taxpayers
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:33.920]  pumping it in in a controlled stock market they'll know when to pull it well
[2:29:33.920 --> 2:29:37.680]  probably when it hits 12 000 let's see how the suckers rally is going to work

[2:33:09.840 --> 2:33:13.760]  bnp wants us all basically to toss their salad that's their game plan
[2:33:13.760 --> 2:33:17.280]  let's keep in mind that two years ago on august 9th
[2:33:17.280 --> 2:33:20.480]  was the beginning of a staged controlled financial
[2:33:20.480 --> 2:33:23.520]  terrorist demolition of the world's financial system
[2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:27.280]  when bnp announced that they couldn't value bonds in their books
[2:33:27.280 --> 2:33:30.720]  the subprime loans that started the credit crash the controlled demolition
[2:33:30.720 --> 2:33:33.280]  of the global banking system two years ago this is
[2:33:33.280 --> 2:33:38.560]  we'll go down in history as basically the ninth of august or eight nine
[2:33:38.560 --> 2:33:44.640]  similar to nine eleven this is when they started this controlled demolition
[2:33:44.640 --> 2:33:48.720]  that's max keiser on the main national news channel in
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:52.240]  france he's got a show on press tv starting a show on
[2:33:52.240 --> 2:33:55.680]  russia today huge worldwide paul watson has that on his
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:34:00.160]  broadcast tv and sheffield give me an idea how big russia today is
[2:34:00.160 --> 2:34:04.000]  and uh he's also done the bbc tv show a very
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:07.440]  busy person i'm going to be on this week's press tv
[2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:11.120]  show with him so always honored to be there before we go back to max keiser
[2:34:11.120 --> 2:34:14.240]  and ask about his upcoming tv appearances he'll be with us 20
[2:34:14.240 --> 2:34:17.520]  minutes into the next hour starting next segment we're going to take phone
[2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:20.880]  calls for max keiser at one eight hundred two five
[2:34:20.880 --> 2:34:24.400]  nine ninety two thirty one he could talk about a
[2:34:24.400 --> 2:34:28.880]  whole host of issues but he can't talk about shuba cabras and stuff like that
[2:34:28.880 --> 2:34:31.840]  ladies and gentlemen we have the t-shirt being made right now
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:35.840]  i have the idea monday to when i noticed that that image of obama socialism
[2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:39.840]  was going viral i knew that it was a hot image because
[2:34:39.840 --> 2:34:45.600]  it just it just took you know uh him and really bared his soul
[2:34:45.600 --> 2:34:49.280]  and broke the back it was ready to be broken
[2:34:49.280 --> 2:34:52.400]  of this illusion of him is this sweetheart that loves you and i think the
[2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:56.240]  image of him as a psychopathic criminal is much closer to the reality but
[2:34:56.240 --> 2:34:59.120]  again he's just a front man so we made these t-shirts they're
[2:34:59.120 --> 2:35:01.920]  selling like hotcakes i'm very glad i'll get the word out because they have
[2:35:01.920 --> 2:35:05.840]  good messages on the back now they have very very important messages on the
[2:35:05.840 --> 2:35:08.800]  back like wake up before it's too late
[2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:12.320]  stop the criminal in the fed there's eight different t-shirts eight different
[2:35:12.320 --> 2:35:15.680]  variants obama fascism obama info wars dot com
[2:35:15.680 --> 2:35:20.560]  obama new world order and i'm sending a crew out right now to make a viral

[2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:45.520]  socialism is bad enough as if we're going to take money from one group and give
[2:35:45.520 --> 2:35:48.560]  it to another but this is thirty dollars for the bank one dollar for the people
[2:35:48.560 --> 2:35:52.880]  as max keiser and others are broken down so

[2:36:56.480 --> 2:37:00.400]  to lampoon him he's a god i love taking their deity
[2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:04.240]  their royalty and and showing what he really is a
[2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:08.000]  joker a scammer i mean max keiser do you think it's unfair and mean
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:12.880]  to put up a joker a and b uh isn't it all right anyways
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:16.160]  whether it's nice or not to show the godlike creature
[2:37:16.160 --> 2:37:20.000]  uh in in whatever way we wish or should it be illegal
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:23.520]  as some democratic operatives are calling for
[2:37:23.520 --> 2:37:27.360]  like alex i grew up during the nixon era
[2:37:27.360 --> 2:37:33.040]  and the amount of vitriol spouted toward nixon as you can imagine was quite
[2:37:33.040 --> 2:37:39.360]  vehement the the parodies and and the uh the things that were done
[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:43.840]  were extreme and because the country was angry
[2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:46.960]  and why are they angry because they don't have a job
[2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:52.000]  because the economy is sinking because the president seems to curry favor with
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:54.480]  the wall street banks and he has done no
[2:37:54.480 --> 2:37:58.640]  reformation of the banking system whatsoever if anything
[2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:02.480]  he's given them more power and the people unfortunately
[2:38:02.480 --> 2:38:07.840]  have no power except through uh historically the people have always
[2:38:07.840 --> 2:38:12.720]  resorted to pamphleteering and through parity and through any
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:17.040]  means necessary that is cheap but carries their message
[2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:21.840]  and this is just what happens when when an economy is concentrated
[2:38:21.840 --> 2:38:25.200]  wealth is by the fewer and fewer percentage
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:28.720]  and it leaves the vast majority faced out in the mud
[2:38:28.720 --> 2:38:32.400]  and and and this just creates this this dynamic and
[2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:40.000]  the way to stop it is to address this and this unbelievable power grab of the
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:43.840]  money and wealth in the united states by the select few
[2:38:43.840 --> 2:38:48.000]  and start to engage in some measures that will restore
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:50.480]  balance the problem with these banks on the wall street
[2:38:50.480 --> 2:38:54.880]  is that as the power grab continues there's a less and less competition for
[2:38:54.880 --> 2:38:58.960]  them and people say well you know uh people are just
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:02.960]  envious that Goldman Sachs was making a lot of money which is completely
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:07.280]  incorrect what is disturbing is that there are no competitors
[2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:11.360]  for a Goldman Sachs why doesn't Obama and Geithner and Bernanke why don't they
[2:39:11.360 --> 2:39:14.800]  start a few new banks that have that will challenge
[2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:18.720]  Goldman no everything has to be fed into the mega bank at the expense of the
[2:39:18.720 --> 2:39:21.600]  people and that's what john d roger fell the first said
[2:39:21.600 --> 2:39:27.680]  he said competition is a sin and it is a sin to these mega monopoly capitalist
[2:39:27.680 --> 2:39:32.160]  competition is the lifeblood of what's called the american dream
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:36.560]  the purpose of the government is to allow like an empire at the ball game
[2:39:36.560 --> 2:39:40.000]  is so that there can be fair competition that's what the that's what
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:43.280]  the government can do they play the umpire at the ball game and then we'll
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:46.880]  see who competes the best some people are talented some people are really hard
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:50.320]  working and you have a you have the ability through sheer
[2:39:50.320 --> 2:39:54.720]  hard work to make it in that economy but if they remove if the empire is
[2:39:54.720 --> 2:40:00.400]  working for the banks and there is no uh there are no laws or other rules
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:04.320]  then the people in the country are going to rise up and say you know what this
[2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:08.560]  is this is full bs you know we we we want to compete the people want to work
[2:40:08.560 --> 2:40:12.000]  they want to compete but the banks on Wall Street won't let them
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:16.080]  and that that's that blockage has got to be removed from the economy there needs
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:20.400]  to be a reintroduction of competition in the united states
[2:40:20.400 --> 2:40:24.240]  and the way to do that is to remove the egregious monopoly
[2:40:24.240 --> 2:40:29.200]  of everything financial every every loan every price on every exchange is
[2:40:29.200 --> 2:40:33.760]  totally manipulated at this point it's done so thousands of times a minute
[2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:36.560]  and they're just stealing they've got like i said at the top of the interview
[2:40:36.560 --> 2:40:40.160]  they've got a siphon stuck into the pot of money that is america's wealth and
[2:40:40.160 --> 2:40:43.360]  they're just siphoning it out with no competition whatsoever
[2:40:43.360 --> 2:40:46.560]  they're just taking it they're just stealing it without any
[2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:50.960]  any intrusion from any regulator whatsoever
[2:40:50.960 --> 2:40:55.440]  now how's that gonna how's that gonna foster an economy of hardworking
[2:40:55.440 --> 2:40:58.640]  diligent moral people
[2:40:59.840 --> 2:41:04.880]  great points uh max keiser did you go on monday the front page of the
[2:41:04.880 --> 2:41:09.200]  financial times wall street profits from fed
[2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:14.480]  role this is on the front page of the financial times what does this mean
[2:41:14.480 --> 2:41:18.560]  the federal reserve tells wall street what they're buying and selling
[2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:22.320]  before they buy and sell wall street then steps in
[2:41:22.320 --> 2:41:25.600]  they quote unquote front run which means they place orders ahead of the
[2:41:25.600 --> 2:41:29.120]  government and they make money without taking any risks
[2:41:29.120 --> 2:41:37.040]  so it's a it's a rig so it's a rigged inside economy insider trading now
[2:41:37.040 --> 2:41:41.680]  publicly crime is just absolutely mainstream now
[2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:45.120]  insider trading crime and fevery are listed on the exchange you can buy them
[2:41:45.120 --> 2:41:49.600]  every single day it's it's a listed open sewer of corruption
[2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:53.280]  that they're just buying and selling on the exchange and they're basically
[2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:56.720]  taunting people and saying look here we go with us or against us that's why i
[2:41:56.720 --> 2:42:01.200]  have that site gulag wealth fund dot com which has all the companies that are
[2:42:01.200 --> 2:42:04.560]  profiting from this gulag casino state so i've got
[2:42:04.560 --> 2:42:08.160]  the various military contractors and the various banks
[2:42:08.160 --> 2:42:11.280]  and if you want to participate in the gulag wealth industry
[2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:14.640]  you should buy the shares in these stocks because you can watch your country
[2:42:14.640 --> 2:42:18.800]  go into the mud as well and you'll be of riches uh you know might be the
[2:42:18.800 --> 2:42:21.360]  richest guy in the world but you will have lost your country
[2:42:21.360 --> 2:42:24.560]  so that's the trade off that's the trade off you have to ask yourself are you
[2:42:24.560 --> 2:42:29.520]  willing to pick up from rich it's an exchange in exchange for their wealth
[2:42:29.520 --> 2:42:32.000]  are you willing to give up your country that's the question everyone has to
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:34.720]  ask themselves but at a certain point they destroy
[2:42:34.720 --> 2:42:37.440]  the standard of living and turn all the western countries
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:42.800]  into sewers but i guess they don't care as long as they're the king monkey
[2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:46.960]  sitting on top the pile of dung it's just amazing did you see where the
[2:42:46.960 --> 2:42:49.600]  white house we actually broke this on monday it's now been picked up
[2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:53.840]  nationally the white house is asking its people to report anyone that
[2:42:53.840 --> 2:42:58.000]  talks bad about the health care plan and then back during the campaign they had
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:02.160]  cops in missouri going we're going to arrest you if we decide you lie about
[2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:05.120]  obama and all these youth brigades and youth
[2:43:05.120 --> 2:43:08.480]  corps with all these big republicans running them for obama
[2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:15.760]  like david gergen well because the business of the casino gulag model
[2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:20.960]  the supporting the cops in this case and the surveillance and the invasive
[2:43:20.960 --> 2:43:25.040]  technology 24-7 this is the only business you know here's an
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:29.280]  interesting point if you look at the last the gross domestic product of america
[2:43:29.280 --> 2:43:32.800]  for the last quarter and they say that um
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:37.680]  they was um the figures were up minus and plus or minus one percent from a
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:41.520]  year earlier never saying see the economy is on some kind of growth track or
[2:43:41.520 --> 2:43:46.000]  it's not decelerating as fast as we said it would if you subtract
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:52.880]  the military from the durable hard goods number the military component
[2:43:52.880 --> 2:43:56.960]  it's more than 50 percent so in other words the only growth that you see in the
[2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:00.080]  u.s. right now comes from invading countries
[2:44:00.080 --> 2:44:03.360]  slaughtering people and installing surveillance equipment
[2:44:03.360 --> 2:44:06.080]  that's it that's what america exports now that's their growth industry and they
[2:44:06.080 --> 2:44:08.800]  look at that they say it's great the people who are doing it they can borrow
[2:44:08.800 --> 2:44:12.400]  money from wall street at virtually no money no interest rates whatsoever
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:15.920]  because they keep those artificially low interest rates for them if you're a
[2:44:15.920 --> 2:44:20.400]  saver if you work and you save money like i'm a saver i have only savings i have
[2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:23.440]  no debt i don't have a mortgage i have a credit card i have a car loan i've never
[2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:27.200]  had any debt but i'm being penalized because i go on my savings i get one
[2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:31.600]  percent at most that's outrageous when the demand for credit is there i should
[2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:35.280]  be getting four or five percent so i'm subsidizing Goldman Sachs i'm
[2:44:35.280 --> 2:44:39.760]  subsidizing jp morgan they're stealing money from me every single day that's
[2:44:39.760 --> 2:44:44.080]  completely ridiculous so why what what what productive
[2:44:44.080 --> 2:44:47.760]  role are they playing in the society none they're just having like acid they're
[2:44:47.760 --> 2:44:50.960]  just just ripping it apart and it's not even because
[2:44:50.960 --> 2:44:53.440]  and they're not even having a lot of fun doing it it's just because they're
[2:44:53.440 --> 2:44:57.120]  sadistic it's like caligula capitalism they're just
[2:44:57.120 --> 2:45:01.440]  sick sadistic no that's it they love blasting out the free market
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:05.760]  destroying societies bankrupting people i read the malphusian
[2:45:05.760 --> 2:45:09.200]  eugenicist views of all these elites goldman sacks
[2:45:09.200 --> 2:45:13.440]  and jp morgan publicly fund most of the eugenics groups most of zero growth
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:17.600]  groups they're paying people to sell good cars then the car dealers just don't go
[2:45:17.600 --> 2:45:21.760]  down as much and actually rip you off the study show for cash for clunkers
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:25.280]  obama's idea to renew america is to quote bulldoze cities
[2:45:25.280 --> 2:45:29.680]  usa today command destruction this is what they want
[2:45:29.680 --> 2:45:33.440]  and and i wanted to ask you max before we go to calls eco science
[2:45:33.440 --> 2:45:37.040]  holdren and it turns out the guy he wrote the book with paul urlick was
[2:45:37.040 --> 2:45:42.400]  george bush seniors science advisor openly wanting to drug the water take all
[2:45:42.400 --> 2:45:46.480]  children at birth train them raise them in government
[2:45:46.480 --> 2:45:52.080]  dormitories and now in england 20 000 families to have cameras in the homes
[2:45:52.080 --> 2:45:54.960]  watching their children they're saying they're going to take the children and
[2:45:54.960 --> 2:45:58.720]  raise them in dormitories that the family is bad the state
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:03.040]  is actually this is in the book now they're doing it can you comment on these
[2:46:03.040 --> 2:46:05.360]  people
[2:46:05.360 --> 2:46:11.360]  the you know it's just uh you know it's just it just makes you well up in
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:15.760]  tears inside because you realize that this great experiment that was
[2:46:15.760 --> 2:46:19.440]  started in the 18th century is come to a shocking
[2:46:19.440 --> 2:46:25.840]  close and very suddenly because of a complete inability for those who are
[2:46:25.840 --> 2:46:30.000]  benefiting most from a democratic society to stand up for their democracy
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  so if you're a collegial capitalist if you're running a casino gulag state
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:39.760]  and you've got no resistance whatsoever then why why why why blame them they're
[2:46:39.760 --> 2:46:43.440]  just you know rust never sleeps rust is rust
[2:46:43.440 --> 2:46:46.720]  without you know there's no these people are never going to stop
[2:46:46.720 --> 2:46:50.240]  they don't have no logic there's nothing behind them that it makes any human
[2:46:50.240 --> 2:46:54.400]  sense so so there's not going to stop and the
[2:46:54.400 --> 2:46:58.000]  people who are getting the most affected by this are refusing to stand up for
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:02.160]  themselves so i don't see any change in the dynamic
[2:47:02.160 --> 2:47:06.080]  here whatsoever i just don't see it and it's really
[2:47:06.080 --> 2:47:09.760]  you know i live in france because i can't even live in the united states it
[2:47:09.760 --> 2:47:13.840]  makes me a little queasy inside to to walk around and just
[2:47:13.840 --> 2:47:18.560]  it's like being in a zombieville here in france the people in france
[2:47:18.560 --> 2:47:22.240]  have a situation where the government fears them
[2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:27.040]  the government fears the people if the government says something or does
[2:47:27.040 --> 2:47:30.320]  something in france that people don't like they immediately are out in the
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:32.880]  street they're protesting and demonstrating every single
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:36.320]  day uh in the u.s of course it's the opposite
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:39.680]  that people fear the government and that's totally unacceptable
[2:47:39.680 --> 2:47:44.720]  that's completely unacceptable and they can't even be around it it's sickening
[2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:48.240]  well absolutely the media is always bashing france and i think its taxes
[2:47:48.240 --> 2:47:50.720]  is too high but the people actually have a form of socialism there they're
[2:47:50.720 --> 2:47:54.080]  demanding it uh i'm not for that system but they're
[2:47:54.080 --> 2:47:56.080]  actually getting some of it which is better than this
[2:47:56.080 --> 2:47:59.360]  i mean if you're gonna have socialism i will get part of it but the issue is
[2:47:59.360 --> 2:48:03.280]  we'll get some services every day that's the worst socialist system in the
[2:48:03.280 --> 2:48:07.120]  world but that's what i'm saying this isn't even socialism
[2:48:07.120 --> 2:48:10.720]  it won't treat it the most egregious socialistic parasite
[2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:16.160]  on the entire globe isn't that socialism but max i'm agreeing with you i'm
[2:48:16.160 --> 2:48:18.560]  saying they steal all our money and give it to elites
[2:48:18.560 --> 2:48:21.040]  at least in france they take the money and actually give it to some of the
[2:48:21.040 --> 2:48:23.840]  people but what i'm saying is they try to plant gmo
[2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:27.280]  they burn it down they try to do something corrupt the people riot
[2:48:27.280 --> 2:48:30.480]  and and and so you're right about that you were telling me during the break that
[2:48:30.480 --> 2:48:35.360]  you were in a uh french coffee shop or something and heard something interesting
[2:48:35.360 --> 2:48:38.560]  oh yeah they were talking about alex jones i couldn't believe it a couple of
[2:48:38.560 --> 2:48:42.400]  french people were uh to talk about alex jones so
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:46.560]  i broke in with my my limited french and uh we had an interesting conversation
[2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:50.480]  but they were curious i mean what were they saying
[2:48:50.480 --> 2:48:55.840]  well they were they were fascinated by really the film the obama deception is
[2:48:55.840 --> 2:49:00.000]  actually is being viewed here in france by people
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:03.760]  and there i guess some some people have some versions with subtitles out there
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:07.440]  or something but they knew significant parts about it
[2:49:07.440 --> 2:49:11.760]  and here you know in europe obama was very very seductive
[2:49:11.760 --> 2:49:17.120]  and he really won over the europeans and and so this is uh this is something
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:20.960]  that has come up and it's it's a really a topic of discussion that this whole
[2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:24.240]  uh reversal the the fact that his popularity has been dropping and what
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:27.360]  does this mean and you know we're in love with him and then how did we think
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:30.720]  about this and then the obama deception film came up because it's how many
[2:49:30.720 --> 2:49:33.680]  views does it have on the net like 20 million views so yeah it's it's more
[2:49:33.680 --> 2:49:36.640]  than that but yeah that's conservative well the issue is
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:40.160]  it wasn't their love of obama it was their hatred of bush
[2:49:40.160 --> 2:49:43.280]  and i found that in my own life i'll hate somebody so much
[2:49:43.280 --> 2:49:46.960]  that i ended up being friends with that person's enemy and that person turns
[2:49:46.960 --> 2:49:50.400]  out being just as bad and i think that's what it is
[2:49:50.400 --> 2:49:54.560]  is that it is that bush was so horrible people associated all the tyranny with
[2:49:54.560 --> 2:49:58.240]  him so went running to obama and he was just a pimp
[2:49:58.240 --> 2:50:01.760]  who then got us in the hotel room and punched us in the face and knocked our
[2:50:01.760 --> 2:50:04.720]  teeth out and now we're crawling around on the ground bleeding and he's going
[2:50:04.720 --> 2:50:07.760]  yeah bitch you like it and i think people
[2:50:07.760 --> 2:50:11.200]  they're finally going no i don't like it i'm leaving so we're we're running out
[2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:14.560]  the door in our skirt crying in the rain and he's slapping us with it
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:18.560]  with it you know with a uh uh coat hanger that i just think it's time for
[2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:22.720]  people to wake up people in france
[2:50:22.720 --> 2:50:29.520]  you know contrary to popular belief are are really uh love american a lot of
[2:50:29.520 --> 2:50:32.560]  ways i mean the huge boulevard in the middle of
[2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:36.880]  paris you know franklin roosevelt boulevard jfk boulevard
[2:50:36.880 --> 2:50:40.800]  and um you know the french are the ones that finance the american revolution
[2:50:40.800 --> 2:50:43.280]  and as a result their own economy went into freefall
[2:50:43.280 --> 2:50:47.280]  if it wasn't they want to like no america they want to like exactly they
[2:50:47.280 --> 2:50:51.200]  want to like the united states and so the angle files have always hated that so
[2:50:51.200 --> 2:50:54.160]  that's why they love to demonize france on our news
[2:50:54.160 --> 2:50:57.200]  because they helped found america and the british government hates that max
[2:50:57.200 --> 2:51:01.920]  keiser he knows what he's talking about
[2:51:01.920 --> 2:51:05.520]  millions of americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic
[2:51:05.520 --> 2:51:08.160]  and political problems facing the u.s and the world

[2:54:22.560 --> 2:54:25.440]  but i'll watch them right up to the day i'm gonna pick the best video that i
[2:54:25.440 --> 2:54:29.120]  think gets the word out about obama being a liar and a criminal
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:32.480]  and a frontman for the new world order but let's not just blame him let's get
[2:54:32.480 --> 2:54:36.080]  past him to the real elites and bring them to justice
[2:54:36.080 --> 2:54:40.320]  max keiser is our guest max i want to go to calls dug and dan and chris and
[2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:47.360]  dr gushan and others that are holding toll free number to join us 1-800-259-9231
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:51.360]  but uh you've got a pretty good brain i mean i've been i've been reading some
[2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:54.400]  of your writings from years ago and almost all of it came true
[2:54:54.400 --> 2:54:57.840]  what do you think's going to happen in the next few years because i knew that
[2:54:57.840 --> 2:55:01.280]  obama had this godlike level but that as soon as he
[2:55:01.280 --> 2:55:04.320]  proved he was a liar that would dissipate the bigger they are the farther
[2:55:04.320 --> 2:55:08.080]  harder they'll fall but it also seems that obama's controllers
[2:55:08.080 --> 2:55:12.320]  are going to want to stage something a new war with iran an economic collapse
[2:55:12.320 --> 2:55:17.280]  more economic terrorism uh domestic stage terror attacks i mean
[2:55:17.280 --> 2:55:20.000]  what do you see happening in the next couple years
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:24.640]  with the people taking over all these town halls going after both parties
[2:55:24.640 --> 2:55:28.720]  and how the empire is going to strike back
[2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:33.040]  well as you know as i've said on your show before
[2:55:33.040 --> 2:55:37.280]  i think that as the economy continues to collapse
[2:55:37.280 --> 2:55:41.520]  there's going to be a big push across the country state to state
[2:55:41.520 --> 2:55:46.080]  to legalize gambling and the gambling is going to be more of a factor in the
[2:55:46.080 --> 2:55:49.280]  economy there's going to be more ways to gamble
[2:55:49.280 --> 2:55:53.360]  specifically online the reason you don't have online gambling right now is
[2:55:53.360 --> 2:55:56.080]  because of the mob in vegas and new jersey
[2:55:56.080 --> 2:56:00.480]  they control uh gambling and those so you think the revolution is just us
[2:56:00.480 --> 2:56:04.720]  turning into total slobs you think you think we're going to get worse
[2:56:04.720 --> 2:56:10.000]  yeah i think that the the combination of online gambling
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:15.200]  cheap pharmaceuticals engineered over-the-counter
[2:56:15.200 --> 2:56:20.880]  mood-altering drugs and terrible food products high-fructose corn syrup
[2:56:20.880 --> 2:56:23.360]  based food products you put all those things into a
[2:56:23.360 --> 2:56:29.120]  cocktail of of uh of of of the silliness and you end up with a
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:33.600]  population that is completely strung out and just trying to gamble
[2:56:33.600 --> 2:56:38.000]  their way toward making basically you know it's indentured servitude
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:41.280]  is what is what we're heading toward because the debts
[2:56:41.280 --> 2:56:45.440]  are never going to be paid they're simply never going to be paid
[2:56:45.440 --> 2:56:49.200]  and as the banks reorganize the system right now they're putting all the bad
[2:56:49.200 --> 2:56:52.720]  bets into the publicly held banks like for example in the u k this northern
[2:56:52.720 --> 2:56:55.680]  rock which was the first bank one of the first banks to go under
[2:56:55.680 --> 2:56:58.800]  they did enough that they've got three times the bad toxic assets that they
[2:56:58.800 --> 2:57:01.440]  thought that they had but that's a publicly owned bank
[2:57:01.440 --> 2:57:05.520]  so now it's really the public that owns those toxic assets the private banks
[2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:09.520]  are the banks that are held by the the runners of the gulag casino state
[2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:13.120]  and of course they they hold the performing assets and the performing
[2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:15.840]  loans so they're dividing the bad assets from the good
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:19.040]  assets and they're keeping the ones that are still relatively
[2:57:19.040 --> 2:57:22.160]  high-profile and performing and they're putting all the really trashy
[2:57:22.160 --> 2:57:26.400]  junk grade z never ever going to be paid back into the public domain and the
[2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:29.360]  public ownership and the public will never pay back those loans
[2:57:29.360 --> 2:57:32.080]  and the public will continuously get themselves further further into debt
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:36.080]  look at the cash the cash for clunkers program is a perfect example they
[2:57:36.080 --> 2:57:40.400]  encourage people to take cars that they own 100%
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:43.520]  trade them in and put themselves into debt

[3:00:10.240 --> 3:00:14.240]  you know i think max kaiser and myself suffer from the same thing
[3:00:14.240 --> 3:00:18.080]  we're really sensitive guys and this amount of craziness and corruption is
[3:00:18.080 --> 3:00:23.040]  getting to us um max kaiser's come up with a new thing
[3:00:23.040 --> 3:00:27.200]  uh something new to commoditize for goldman sacks and others they can turn
[3:00:27.200 --> 3:00:30.400]  into a commodity tell folks about it till we can
[3:00:30.400 --> 3:00:34.640]  turn dog poop into a new commodity correct
[3:00:34.640 --> 3:00:37.840]  you know they've got these websites out there that's like
[3:00:37.840 --> 3:00:46.160]  mail poop.com that send dog poop uh to to people and my thought is that if
[3:00:46.160 --> 3:00:51.360]  goldman sacks is so smart at turning junk into commoditized mortgage
[3:00:51.360 --> 3:00:55.600]  obligations and all these other flora in front of the financial engineering
[3:00:55.600 --> 3:00:59.280]  sphere turn this dog poop into a hundred or two hundred three hundred
[3:00:59.280 --> 3:01:03.440]  billion dollars worth of dog poop collateralized mortgage obligations
[3:01:03.440 --> 3:01:06.720]  with i'm sure that they will try to do it if you send them dog poop i'm sure
[3:01:06.720 --> 3:01:08.320]  they will try to turn it into a dog poop
[3:01:08.320 --> 3:01:12.000]  hey they took your program and tried to try to make a commodity out of terror
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:15.760]  attacks remember that the policy analysis market
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:18.800]  was based on my technology as i've said on your show before
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:23.760]  uh john poindexter created the policy analysis market a prediction market to
[3:01:23.760 --> 3:01:27.520]  try to predict terrorist attacks he used my virtual specialist technology
[3:01:27.520 --> 3:01:31.520]  and i wrote about it in the financial time saying this is only going to encourage
[3:01:31.520 --> 3:01:35.120]  uh terror attacks here's here's something else interesting economically going
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:38.160]  forward you know they're going to start trading box office features contracts on
[3:01:38.160 --> 3:01:42.480]  the cancer exchange so if you are like indiana jones part six
[3:01:42.480 --> 3:01:46.160]  you can buy and sell features based on the movie coming out in a year
[3:01:46.160 --> 3:01:50.240]  or two years from today so naturally we're gonna see is two things number one
[3:01:50.240 --> 3:01:53.840]  studios are going to manipulate the prices on competing studios projects
[3:01:53.840 --> 3:01:57.360]  so you see market manipulation in the box office features contract to try to
[3:01:57.360 --> 3:02:00.480]  change people's perception of movies before they're released
[3:02:00.480 --> 3:02:04.960]  and number two within 24 months they're gonna need a bailout
[3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:09.520]  and they're going to be rigging when movies come out to rig that
[3:02:09.520 --> 3:02:12.640]  well i think that you know hollywood has gotten a free ride
[3:02:12.640 --> 3:02:17.440]  during this whole breakdown of society in america
[3:02:17.440 --> 3:02:21.360]  where are these hollywood producers and hollywood stars if you look at a movie
[3:02:21.360 --> 3:02:25.120]  a tv show for example like entourage on hbo
[3:02:25.120 --> 3:02:28.880]  he's got these punks and hollywood make it half a million dollars a day
[3:02:28.880 --> 3:02:32.800]  giving each other a quarter million dollar cars as presents and they portray
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:37.600]  this life that people watching that it must be like
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:41.600]  you know mental crack on your head that you want to just run to hollywood
[3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:45.040]  immediately meanwhile what is that industry doing
[3:02:45.040 --> 3:02:50.160]  to support this economy as a whole absolutely nothing they have to come
[3:02:50.160 --> 3:02:53.840]  probably the most irresponsible industry in america today
[3:02:53.840 --> 3:02:57.600]  you know all this n-1 accounting that we talk about and all of the
[3:02:57.600 --> 3:03:02.240]  high-powered corporate fraud and banking fraud we talk about it had a name
[3:03:02.240 --> 3:03:05.840]  back in the 70s and 80s they used to call it hollywood accounting
[3:03:05.840 --> 3:03:09.440]  now hollywood accounting has become the global accounting methodology
[3:03:09.440 --> 3:03:13.280]  where they book profits today and they defer losses in perpetuity
[3:03:13.280 --> 3:03:15.840]  that's what hollywood accounting is about and that's what all these banks are
[3:03:15.840 --> 3:03:19.280]  not doing if they make a game today speculating with our money they book
[3:03:19.280 --> 3:03:22.640]  it today to profit pay us as a bonus if they lose money they keep it on their
[3:03:22.640 --> 3:03:25.280]  books for 20 30 40 years and they package it as a loan
[3:03:25.280 --> 3:03:29.120]  and they trade it with each other in perpetuity and nobody ever captures that
[3:03:29.120 --> 3:03:33.520]  loss so they can't lose and that is draining the economy of
[3:03:33.520 --> 3:03:36.640]  much needed capital which is causing and what else they do
[3:03:36.640 --> 3:03:39.680]  what else they do as you know but people won't know like let's say you're part
[3:03:39.680 --> 3:03:41.760]  of a film you're supposed to get a percentage
[3:03:41.760 --> 3:03:45.920]  they always factor that in a pool into losses so they never pay the underlings
[3:03:45.920 --> 3:03:49.760]  and they never pay the little people that are involved in any ownership
[3:03:49.760 --> 3:03:53.120]  it's just all a criminal mafia organization well part of the casino
[3:03:53.120 --> 3:03:56.960]  group like model is you willing to work for free and in los angeles of course
[3:03:56.960 --> 3:03:59.920]  you get a shot at working at an agency or something you're willing to work for
[3:03:59.920 --> 3:04:03.040]  nothing for a year or two but now they're applying that to
[3:04:03.040 --> 3:04:06.960]  the car companies and pharmaceutical companies and everyone is now being asked
[3:04:06.960 --> 3:04:10.720]  to work for nothing for a year or two or go on furlough for a year or two
[3:04:10.720 --> 3:04:14.480]  they don't want to pay anyone anything anymore but warren buffett gets
[3:04:14.480 --> 3:04:18.720]  98 billion of our tax money and is called a genius
[3:04:18.720 --> 3:04:23.840]  because he gave most of his other money to eugenics
[3:04:23.840 --> 3:04:30.800]  well buffett is unfortunately he is not this this this scandal is not is not
[3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:33.760]  reflecting well on the oracle from Omaha
[3:04:33.760 --> 3:04:37.920]  i'm afraid because if you look at his statements and the timing of his statements
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:41.280]  and the fact that he loaned money to goldman sacks
[3:04:41.280 --> 3:04:45.600]  and they pay him 10 percent on that money the american citizen pays goldman
[3:04:45.600 --> 3:04:48.080]  still owns goldman sacks money and they get nothing
[3:04:48.080 --> 3:04:52.480]  he's got a warrant to convert stock at 115 the stocks now
[3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:56.400]  trading uh i don't check today but over 140 or something like that he's only

[3:08:28.240 --> 3:08:31.360]  to have him on with us you can go to max keiser.com
[3:08:31.360 --> 3:08:34.880]  find out about all the different tv shows and the different work he does the
[3:08:34.880 --> 3:08:38.320]  great articles he writes the little videos he also posts with some of my
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:42.240]  favorites when he shoots at his house max keiser.com i'm alex jones our
[3:08:42.240 --> 3:08:46.240]  website of course is info wars.com and present planet.com
[3:08:46.240 --> 3:08:49.520]  i want to go to calls but earlier we were joking around some but
[3:08:49.520 --> 3:08:54.000]  a point that max made that is so central is that this is like rust this is
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:57.040]  entropy this is the you know the frog gets
[3:08:57.040 --> 3:09:00.880]  asked by the scorpion take me across the river and the frog says you'll sting
[3:09:00.880 --> 3:09:03.600]  and kill me and the scorpion says no i won't i promise
[3:09:03.600 --> 3:09:07.120]  and so the frog gives him a ride across on the other side that
[3:09:07.120 --> 3:09:10.560]  scorpion stings him and as the frog's dying he says why'd you do that to me
[3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:14.560]  he says i'm a scorpion there's always going to be evil corrupt
[3:09:14.560 --> 3:09:18.000]  people and groups and piratical organizations
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:21.840]  and they convince the public that evil doesn't exist if it's in a fancy suit
[3:09:21.840 --> 3:09:25.920]  it only exists if it's some grungy homeless person or something
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:29.600]  and so because we don't think old ballheaded men and
[3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:32.720]  five thousand dollar suits can be evil when that's actually some of the most
[3:09:32.720 --> 3:09:36.000]  evil people they could just run wild a free hand
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:39.520]  they've openly set up a police state they're openly telling us we have no
[3:09:39.520 --> 3:09:42.560]  rights in this country they're openly trying to consolidate
[3:09:42.560 --> 3:09:46.560]  and and and and keep the gains they've gotten ill gotten and expand them
[3:09:46.560 --> 3:09:50.560]  and it really does as einstein said you know the most dangerous and worst
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:53.680]  people in this world are not the evil people it's the good people that know
[3:09:53.680 --> 3:09:57.280]  it and do nothing and of course uh thomas jefferson said the only thing that
[3:09:57.280 --> 3:10:01.920]  evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing
[3:10:01.920 --> 3:10:05.520]  and it's only going to get worse unless we stand up and recognize this is evil
[3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:08.880]  and stop rationalizing so max made a great point there and i more and more
[3:10:08.880 --> 3:10:12.080]  realize that is the fact you look in the mirror
[3:10:12.080 --> 3:10:15.360]  that's who caused this we caused this we got to fix it
[3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:18.240]  and the enemy the parasites are going to fight us
[3:10:18.240 --> 3:10:21.280]  they think they deserve all this now usually evil is
[3:10:21.280 --> 3:10:25.680]  sneaking around and circuitous now it's out in the open like king gong going
[3:10:25.680 --> 3:10:29.840]  i rule you and we got to say okay you want to fight
[3:10:29.840 --> 3:10:34.080]  you're going to get one uh let's go ahead and talk to dug in florida
[3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:38.640]  you're on the air with max keiser and olly hondro jones go ahead dug
[3:10:38.640 --> 3:10:42.880]  hey uh alex the first thing i wanted to say is i'm a long time listener real big
[3:10:42.880 --> 3:10:48.400]  fan first time caller welcome i have i have probably what is the only
[3:10:48.400 --> 3:10:51.520]  financial portal in the world that i know of that
[3:10:51.520 --> 3:10:56.320]  carries prison planet headlines every day in our financial portal
[3:10:56.320 --> 3:10:59.840]  and uh okay give us a plug yeah just go ahead and plug in and then ask a
[3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:04.160]  question to max keiser okay it's um market toolbox
[3:11:04.160 --> 3:11:07.360]  dot com and you can download the desktop portal there
[3:11:07.360 --> 3:11:11.280]  but i also took your advice and started my own show and i do a show every
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:14.560]  sunday night and i and in the two hours prior to
[3:11:14.560 --> 3:11:19.440]  going live with our market commentary i streamed sometimes i did the obama
[3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:23.280]  deception i did some rather that's fine and listen i can have a little of this
[3:11:23.280 --> 3:11:25.280]  plugging etiquette but it takes over the show
[3:11:25.280 --> 3:11:28.880]  you better ask you have a question for max keiser
[3:11:28.880 --> 3:11:33.120]  yes i do my question for max is who i'm also a big fan of
[3:11:33.120 --> 3:11:39.120]  is that um at the end of last year when they change the rules when you buy gold
[3:11:39.120 --> 3:11:42.960]  futures so now you have your choice of getting two kinds of paper instead of
[3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:45.840]  the gold um what do you think will happen
[3:11:45.840 --> 3:11:49.920]  when the people wake up and realize the gold's not really there
[3:11:49.920 --> 3:11:53.360]  that's a good question max keiser thank you for the question very good question
[3:11:53.360 --> 3:11:59.680]  and i wanted to get into gold and uh it's um this is on your show
[3:11:59.680 --> 3:12:03.760]  alex i talked about this last year you know i was anticipating a run on the
[3:12:03.760 --> 3:12:06.560]  comex and that people would expect their physical
[3:12:06.560 --> 3:12:10.400]  delivery of gold and we would break the stranglehold because what happens is
[3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:13.520]  the reason there is no gold there is because they've created more futures
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:16.560]  contracts and there is physical bullion it's called naked short selling they
[3:12:16.560 --> 3:12:19.200]  they create physical they create futures contracts
[3:12:19.200 --> 3:12:22.800]  on gold that doesn't exist and then they sell those contracts in the open market
[3:12:22.800 --> 3:12:25.440]  and of course when you sell something the price goes down but they're selling
[3:12:25.440 --> 3:12:28.960]  stuff that they themselves have created a futures contract based on bullion
[3:12:28.960 --> 3:12:31.520]  that's not there and they've traded millions and
[3:12:31.520 --> 3:12:34.720]  millions of ounces of bullion that doesn't exist so the
[3:12:34.720 --> 3:12:41.040]  car makes the good point is that when finally there is a rush and for the first
[3:12:41.040 --> 3:12:47.680]  time alex the central banks around the world are now becoming net buyers of
[3:12:47.680 --> 3:12:51.440]  gold and they've always traditionally been the biggest movers in the gold market
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:12:54.800]  and this is going to give some support finally and yeah it's going to bust wide
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:58.480]  open you'll see gold traded at an inflation adjusted price probably of
[3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:02.480]  two thousand dollars an ounce and you got to be ready for that because that's
[3:13:02.480 --> 3:13:05.040]  part of
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:08.960]  max go ahead
[3:13:09.440 --> 3:13:14.320]  okay we just lost him so let's go ahead and get him back on
[3:13:14.320 --> 3:13:18.000]  that's the issue with using ip computer systems or it's france that kind of
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:23.360]  stuff happens so let's get him back on
[3:13:24.480 --> 3:13:28.960]  um while we're waiting to get max keiser back on let's get dan on
[3:13:28.960 --> 3:13:33.840]  from texas dan and texas you're on the air i just wanted to ask him about
[3:13:33.840 --> 3:13:39.200]  commercial real estate if he thought it was gonna uh cause a money grab collapse
[3:13:39.200 --> 3:13:43.120]  and death of paper assets but i think that's kind of what he was talking about
[3:13:43.120 --> 3:13:47.360]  yeah commercial commercial real estate collapse
[3:13:47.360 --> 3:13:51.920]  yeah i i've subscribed to the half past human things
[3:13:51.920 --> 3:13:55.600]  and they're talking about death of the dollar and all kinds of stuff and i
[3:13:55.600 --> 3:13:59.360]  well i mean regardless we've we've seen a lot of the drop
[3:13:59.360 --> 3:14:03.040]  in housing and supposedly it's going to continue for a while but it's it's the
[3:14:03.040 --> 3:14:07.200]  scent is slowing so that's some good news but we're still falling
[3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:10.080]  but the commercial real estate has just begun
[3:14:10.080 --> 3:14:13.200]  and most the experts economists and others have got good track records of
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:20.400]  predicting this stuff and forecasting it say that is a big big big issue
[3:14:20.400 --> 3:14:23.760]  but why don't you explain your question because you're also making a statement
[3:14:23.760 --> 3:14:27.120]  uh and then we'll get and then we'll ask max because max is back on go ahead and
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:31.120]  ask her question of max keiser uh i just wanted to know if you
[3:14:31.120 --> 3:14:35.760]  thought commercial real estate was going to collapse this fall uh create a money
[3:14:35.760 --> 3:14:39.440]  grab problem with this uh martial law thing that you keep
[3:14:39.440 --> 3:14:44.320]  talking about with the swine flu yeah commercial real estate looks like it's
[3:14:44.320 --> 3:14:48.960]  vulnerable and it's yet another leg of the basic real estate collapse
[3:14:48.960 --> 3:14:53.680]  it's way over leveraged and yeah um i that looks like it's baked into
[3:14:53.680 --> 3:14:56.240]  the cake all right let's take another call
[3:14:56.240 --> 3:14:59.040]  these are great questions should have gone to callers earlier
[3:14:59.040 --> 3:15:03.120]  chris in maryland you're on the air go ahead hey alex good to see your show
[3:15:03.120 --> 3:15:06.800]  and i watched a movie in game last night great information it does line up with
[3:15:06.800 --> 3:15:10.000]  bible prophecy but i wanted to um ask you and your
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:15.040]  guest if you guys knew of a story here where veteran groups are blasting obama
[3:15:15.040 --> 3:15:20.160]  for wanting to institute a plan where a soldier's private health insurance will
[3:15:20.160 --> 3:15:24.400]  pay for their war wounds or injuries incurred during military service
[3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:29.280]  no no that was six months ago i had the head of the vfw on it's true
[3:15:29.280 --> 3:15:32.800]  they have proposed that your private insurance will have to pay
[3:15:32.800 --> 3:15:36.400]  see that's why obama is in trouble i actually have the bill
[3:15:36.400 --> 3:15:42.240]  and i have his proposals and it's not socialism it is giving you an aspirin
[3:15:42.240 --> 3:15:46.880]  for a heart attack it's kind of like unemployment insurance
[3:15:46.880 --> 3:15:50.720]  uh and then you pay into it the employer pays and then when you need it
[3:15:50.720 --> 3:15:55.360]  they kick you off for no reason max keiser yeah i don't have it being on that
[3:15:55.360 --> 3:15:59.280]  really okay caller appreciate your call let's go
[3:15:59.280 --> 3:16:05.040]  ahead and talk to dr gushing i believe in ohio
[3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:08.720]  you're on the air go ahead yeah thanks for uh
[3:16:08.720 --> 3:16:11.920]  taking the time to answer my question i have a question for uh
[3:16:11.920 --> 3:16:15.200]  max keiser uh but the speculation where the trillions of
[3:16:15.200 --> 3:16:19.840]  dollars are going for my speculation is they're relocating the empire
[3:16:19.840 --> 3:16:23.600]  the empire the same empire in egypt was relocated to rome
[3:16:23.600 --> 3:16:28.000]  was relocated to britain was relocated to the usa that's why you have obelisk
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:30.880]  all over the world in in the vaticans in
[3:16:30.880 --> 3:16:35.120]  washington and britain and now i believe they relocating the empire from the
[3:16:35.120 --> 3:16:39.120]  usa to their favorite child israel what do you think
[3:16:39.120 --> 3:16:43.280]  i would say more china is the new model because they exterminate their people
[3:16:43.280 --> 3:16:45.920]  they sterilize their people they carry out the eugenics
[3:16:45.920 --> 3:16:49.040]  but let's get a comment from max keiser on that thank you doc
[3:16:49.040 --> 3:16:52.880]  yeah i think i think they're untethering themselves from the physical world
[3:16:52.880 --> 3:16:57.200]  and it's all basically on a database so it's a movable feast especially as
[3:16:57.200 --> 3:17:00.720]  various parts of the ecology collapse you want to be mobile
[3:17:00.720 --> 3:17:04.560]  so if there's a huge flooding in one state or one city you want to be able to
[3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:07.360]  set up shop in a new city you don't want all of your assets tied up
[3:17:07.360 --> 3:17:11.120]  physically geographically in those assets they're all internal
[3:17:11.120 --> 3:17:13.840]  in the global database and you have access to
[3:17:13.840 --> 3:17:18.000]  and that's why this new group of folks are going to have
[3:17:18.000 --> 3:17:22.480]  exclusive access to uh... that they already have these people i mean they
[3:17:22.480 --> 3:17:24.960]  if you have the jets and you have the mobility and you have the access to the
[3:17:24.960 --> 3:17:25.680]  cash
[3:17:25.680 --> 3:17:30.640]  geography is no longer a factor and the global databases also use
[3:17:30.640 --> 3:17:34.800]  with the no fly and the no buy to where we can't have jobs and live
[3:17:34.800 --> 3:17:39.440]  they turn us off and they're outside the nations they set up as tyrannies
[3:17:39.440 --> 3:17:43.600]  they're outside exempt from the laws that they made for us
[3:17:43.600 --> 3:17:47.360]  uh... let's talk to jeremy in california than dan in germany
[3:17:47.360 --> 3:17:50.960]  i'm a twist max's arm to stay with us till 29 after
[3:17:50.960 --> 3:17:53.920]  if you can do it jeremy in california go ahead
[3:17:53.920 --> 3:17:58.080]  hey man i do have a comment for max uh... actually a question and i have a
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:18:02.080]  comment for you i'm a dot tv subscriber and have been for years
[3:18:02.080 --> 3:18:05.040]  and i have to say that uh... yesterday your
[3:18:05.040 --> 3:18:08.400]  conversation with d quail and taking it back to the spring
[3:18:08.400 --> 3:18:11.920]  i have to say that you you really have been painting things with wide swath
[3:18:11.920 --> 3:18:14.560]  so that you can say that you called something
[3:18:14.560 --> 3:18:18.080]  and you know that the broadcast you did back in the spring where you had your
[3:18:18.080 --> 3:18:22.480]  special saturday broadcast you literally change directions in the course of
[3:18:22.480 --> 3:18:26.080]  less than a week yesterday you were on coast to coast
[3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:30.320]  and you changed your opinion last night in less than twelve hours with nori you
[3:18:30.320 --> 3:18:33.120]  said well i think it could be a big hoax
[3:18:33.120 --> 3:18:37.040]  and then twelve hours before that you're on with steve quail
[3:18:37.040 --> 3:18:40.160]  and you guys are saying that it looks like it's eighty percent that this is
[3:18:40.160 --> 3:18:42.880]  the real thing and i mean it
[3:18:42.880 --> 3:18:46.800]  well wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute stop stop stop put them on hold
[3:18:46.800 --> 3:18:49.600]  okay we have a guest on that's why i said it was on this issue but but i will
[3:18:49.600 --> 3:18:54.320]  address this um i do a radio show a tv show what
[3:18:54.320 --> 3:18:57.680]  i've said is on record so it's not like you're
[3:18:57.680 --> 3:19:00.880]  i mean i came in in the start of the year in january and
[3:19:00.880 --> 3:19:04.400]  february and march and said i believe they're going to try some flu thing
[3:19:04.400 --> 3:19:08.160]  whether it's a hoax or not as they're covered then it happened in january
[3:19:08.160 --> 3:19:11.120]  then i got the level six document people didn't believe it
[3:19:11.120 --> 3:19:15.680]  then it was proven mainstream news to be real uh the mayak report the the
[3:19:15.680 --> 3:19:20.000]  the clergy response teams all the stuff we break and i said they're moving big
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:23.120]  on this whether it's a hoax or whether it's not
[3:19:23.120 --> 3:19:26.400]  and i have guests on that say they think it's the big one and guess i had dr
[3:19:26.400 --> 3:19:31.760]  neiman on last hour saying he believes it's real legitimate take the vaccine
[3:19:31.760 --> 3:19:37.040]  we're having lots of different views and ideas on and i've always said
[3:19:37.040 --> 3:19:40.480]  it could either be a hoax to sell vaccine or it could really be deadly or they
[3:19:40.480 --> 3:19:44.640]  could be releasing it i'm always i mean i mean if an open
[3:19:44.640 --> 3:19:49.360]  debate and discussion confuses you then i would just
[3:19:49.360 --> 3:19:52.720]  you know get more vitamins increase your mental acuity but if you want to
[3:19:52.720 --> 3:19:58.400]  invent controversy what i'm saying be a lawyer knock yourself out make crap up
[3:19:58.400 --> 3:20:02.000]  to the jury i don't care i stand on my own

[3:25:01.680 --> 3:25:06.400]  because painting it with a wide swath allows you to say in retrospect that

[3:25:10.320 --> 3:25:13.840]  on hold listen i did call 9 11 specifically

[3:27:59.200 --> 3:28:02.320]  not to take action all they do is critique us

[3:28:17.600 --> 3:28:21.440]  to max i want to talk about the most under reported story
[3:28:21.440 --> 3:28:24.640]  of two thousand and nine and this is the story that was
[3:28:24.640 --> 3:28:28.400]  appeared in financial times in bloomberg and it deals with two japanese
[3:28:28.400 --> 3:28:31.760]  nationals crossing the swiss italian border
[3:28:31.760 --> 3:28:36.080]  with over two hundred billion dollars worth of treasury bonds
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:40.080]  in their fake suitcase store that they had
[3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:43.920]  um these two nationals were released
[3:28:43.920 --> 3:28:47.520]  right after it was discovered that they were carrying the bonds
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:51.280]  they were intercepted yes real fast we got 45 seconds max can't wait to have
[3:28:51.280 --> 3:28:55.040]  you back congratulations on the new international tv show
[3:28:55.040 --> 3:28:58.480]  uh max quickly you've covered that before but go ahead and tell him in 30
[3:28:58.480 --> 3:29:02.560]  seconds yeah i i because i think it's related
[3:29:02.560 --> 3:29:06.160]  to the uh bank of international settlements and as part of their need
[3:29:06.160 --> 3:29:10.480]  under the basil two agreement to keep certain reserves as a percentage of
[3:29:10.480 --> 3:29:15.120]  loans on their books they need to show equity and i think that those bonds
[3:29:15.120 --> 3:29:18.640]  whether they're counterfeit or not they're still going to use them as
[3:29:18.640 --> 3:29:23.120]  collateral to keep the loans going to this other central banks who then loan
[3:29:23.120 --> 3:29:25.840]  out to the commercial banks on wall street so whether it
[3:29:25.840 --> 3:29:28.400]  doesn't matter if they're if they're counterfeit or not counterfeit they're
[3:29:28.400 --> 3:29:32.320]  still being used as collateral to make loans so ultimately it's all counterfeit
[3:29:32.320 --> 3:29:36.320]  that's my point max can't wait to be on the tv show tomorrow people can watch
[3:29:36.320 --> 3:29:39.840]  that on the max keiser youtube channel and can't wait to see your new russia

[3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:27.360]  i'm also shocked by the intellectual more on this because i know some of the
[3:35:27.360 --> 3:35:29.520]  people aren't government agents they're kind of just repeating what
[3:35:29.520 --> 3:35:35.760]  co entel pro and operation chaos is put out google operation chaos the fbi did
[3:35:37.120 --> 3:35:43.840]  i get shocked by how people intellectually can't
[3:35:43.840 --> 3:35:47.680]  even have debates or discussions or hear multiple ideas put out for
[3:35:47.680 --> 3:35:50.960]  discussion they i don't know it's just i never thought of
[3:35:50.960 --> 3:35:53.440]  myself as that smart and now i more and more realize
[3:35:53.440 --> 3:35:56.640]  there's a lot of people smarter than i am there's also a lot of people who are
[3:35:56.640 --> 3:35:59.680]  just dumbered in dirt or who want to be dumb it's like
[3:35:59.680 --> 3:36:03.760]  they don't have regular proper thinking processes and i don't understand it
[3:36:03.760 --> 3:36:07.040]  the new world order is coming down on us let's just say i'm the worst person in
[3:36:07.040 --> 3:36:09.920]  the world let's just forget that and decide that's the case
[3:36:09.920 --> 3:36:13.440]  can we now move on dealing with major issues
[3:36:13.440 --> 3:36:18.320]  okay i mean you know i need to be attacked on what i say and what i do so
[3:36:18.320 --> 3:36:21.680]  does max keiser and what we say and do is get outside the box things for
[3:36:21.680 --> 3:36:24.160]  yourself
[3:36:26.480 --> 3:36:29.920]  absolutely amazing ladies and gentlemen look i want to get to some calls
[3:36:29.920 --> 3:36:33.360]  here at the very end of the show for the next 10 15 minutes or so i wanted to
[3:36:33.360 --> 3:36:36.880]  bring him back up because just like i've had
[3:36:36.880 --> 3:36:39.680]  the apple seed group up and others who aren't sponsors
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:45.200]  dr ignatius piazza has become a sponsor but i was promoting front side because i
[3:36:45.200 --> 3:36:50.080]  heard everybody i know who's an expert in firearms long rifle shotgun handgun
[3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:53.120]  police military they say front sights the best i've been hearing this for
[3:36:53.120 --> 3:36:56.800]  seven eight nine years at least since 2000 i remember chrissa fannis and
[3:36:56.800 --> 3:37:00.320]  others telling me how great it is a former treasury agent exposed in the irs
[3:37:00.320 --> 3:37:03.600]  shows up joe banister he's wearing a front sight shirt before they're even
[3:37:03.600 --> 3:37:06.400]  sponsors i'm going hey they're about to be sponsors
[3:37:06.400 --> 3:37:09.600]  front sights the way to go and their classes fill up quick
[3:37:09.600 --> 3:37:13.440]  they've got a deal they're offering of a free
[3:37:13.440 --> 3:37:17.520]  springfield armory xd pistol in the caliber of your choice
[3:37:17.520 --> 3:37:21.280]  it's massively off the five and four day courses they fill up quickly in
[3:37:21.280 --> 3:37:24.880]  september they've only got a few in august get signed up and i've had people
[3:37:24.880 --> 3:37:27.760]  all over austin tell me they're going to sign up in the fall
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:31.200]  show you better just that's just where i live people on the street or i go out
[3:37:31.200 --> 3:37:34.960]  to dinner with friends went out with uh
[3:37:34.960 --> 3:37:37.920]  my friend uh jimmy and his wife ronbin and they were saying they were thinking
[3:37:37.920 --> 3:37:40.720]  about going in september so believe me it's going to fill up quick it is
[3:37:40.720 --> 3:37:44.080]  filling up quick in september october november it's not enough to go buy a
[3:37:44.080 --> 3:37:48.960]  bunch of guns and ammo uh last time i was getting so
[3:37:48.960 --> 3:37:52.560]  sped up i said i shot it there at 6 000 yards i shot it there at 600 yards the
[3:37:52.560 --> 3:37:56.480]  point is it's not enough to just buy rifles and handguns and
[3:37:56.480 --> 3:38:00.320]  things you need to know how to use them you take your wife and children this is
[3:38:00.320 --> 3:38:02.480]  a family event so i wanted to get him on and talk
[3:38:02.480 --> 3:38:05.600]  about that but also real quick to get a snapshot
[3:38:05.600 --> 3:38:09.840]  on his view of obama introducing all these draconian anti-gun bills i mean
[3:38:09.840 --> 3:38:13.280]  it's happening just like he says his plan isn't government
[3:38:13.280 --> 3:38:16.800]  health care but you read it it's pure takeover he says oh we don't want your
[3:38:16.800 --> 3:38:19.520]  guns we just are getting people on the supreme
[3:38:19.520 --> 3:38:23.040]  court that say ban all guns in a book she wrote we got an attorney general that
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:25.280]  argued in federal court last year to ban all guns
[3:38:25.280 --> 3:38:29.760]  this is serious ignatius piazza doc it's good to have you on with us
[3:38:29.760 --> 3:38:34.480]  oh thanks very much it's nice to be on again you bet i am in ranting mode with
[3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:37.760]  all the things that are happening in the world right now
[3:38:37.760 --> 3:38:40.400]  let's just before we get into what's happening with second amendment tell
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:44.160]  folks about frontside the courses and why they need to get involved
[3:38:44.160 --> 3:38:47.520]  or even if people can't travel to outside perump nevada
[3:38:47.520 --> 3:38:52.960]  out there in the high desert beautiful they can do stuff online at frontside.com
[3:38:52.960 --> 3:38:57.520]  yeah that's correct uh we we provide gun training reports if they go to frontside.com
[3:38:57.520 --> 3:39:01.440]  that's f-r-o-n-t-s-i-g-h-t.com
[3:39:01.440 --> 3:39:06.640]  they'll see the opportunity signed up for 15 gun training reports it's actually
[3:39:06.640 --> 3:39:10.400]  more like 30 gun training reports we just haven't changed the
[3:39:10.400 --> 3:39:13.760]  change the ad on it and they're absolutely free and it's the same
[3:39:13.760 --> 3:39:17.120]  information that we share with people that you know literally spend thousands
[3:39:17.120 --> 3:39:20.800]  of dollars and travel you know across the country to attend our courses
[3:39:20.800 --> 3:39:23.520]  and there's also training manuals that are available
[3:39:23.520 --> 3:39:26.960]  that are the same techniques that we offer in our courses so if people can't
[3:39:26.960 --> 3:39:30.320]  make it to perump they certainly can begin getting some
[3:39:30.320 --> 3:39:33.680]  some training and get the manuals right off of our website
[3:39:33.680 --> 3:39:37.760]  but the real the real big offer that we've been running for some time now and
[3:39:37.760 --> 3:39:41.680]  it's getting close to the end we originally set it up for
[3:39:41.680 --> 3:39:45.600]  3,000 free handguns and i believe we're approaching that number so if they
[3:39:45.600 --> 3:39:48.480]  want to take advantage of this they need to jump on it pretty quick
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:51.600]  but it's our it's our four-day defensive handgun course
[3:39:51.600 --> 3:39:54.800]  plus an additional day for the 30 state concealed weapon
[3:39:54.800 --> 3:39:58.160]  permit and when they take advantage of that
[3:39:58.160 --> 3:40:01.280]  which we offer it literally pennies on the dollar off of our normal course
[3:40:01.280 --> 3:40:04.880]  prices they can also get a free sprinkled armory xd
[3:40:04.880 --> 3:40:09.120]  pistol in the caliber of their choice 9 millimeter 40 or 45 and it's been
[3:40:09.120 --> 3:40:11.760]  extremely popular so if they're interested in that they definitely
[3:40:11.760 --> 3:40:16.880]  need to jump on it well
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:21.600]  why do people need to get the training i mean that's an asinine question it's so
[3:40:21.600 --> 3:40:25.520]  simple but but can you explain it to them because if people
[3:40:25.520 --> 3:40:29.360]  don't have at least the basics uh they're going to get a lot of trouble if
[3:40:29.360 --> 3:40:33.600]  they just try to put the bullets in a gun when they need it at 3am
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:37.840]  well that's that's absolutely true we tell people that
[3:40:37.840 --> 3:40:41.120]  when the flag flies when you really need to use the gun
[3:40:41.120 --> 3:40:43.920]  to defend your life you're only going to be about half as good
[3:40:43.920 --> 3:40:47.520]  as you're on your best day on the training range simply from the stress
[3:40:47.520 --> 3:40:52.480]  of that lethal encounter and if you haven't been on the training range
[3:40:52.480 --> 3:40:55.120]  imagine what your skills are going to be like they're going to be
[3:40:55.120 --> 3:40:58.080]  absolutely pathetic and the only reason you'll survive
[3:40:58.080 --> 3:41:01.840]  an encounter like that is because the person you're going up with is
[3:41:01.840 --> 3:41:05.200]  more incompetent than you are and who wants to bet their life on that
[3:41:05.200 --> 3:41:09.360]  you know i certainly didn't and that's pretty much how i got my start i was
[3:41:09.360 --> 3:41:12.560]  you know your basic uh you know gun owner i owned a lot of guns shot the
[3:41:12.560 --> 3:41:16.240]  guns at the range but they had never had any formal training
[3:41:16.240 --> 3:41:19.360]  and then a really a relatively minor incident
[3:41:19.360 --> 3:41:22.800]  it was a random drive-by shooting in my you know quiet upscale neighborhood
[3:41:22.800 --> 3:41:26.480]  brought me to the realization that even though i owned guns
[3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:30.320]  even though i had them in the gun safes i really didn't know how to use them
[3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:34.080]  if i needed to so i started training all over the country and
[3:41:34.080 --> 3:41:37.680]  you know trained with some of the the best instructors at the time
[3:41:37.680 --> 3:41:41.120]  and received the highest level certifications at all these different
[3:41:41.120 --> 3:41:46.160]  schools and instructors provided and then i decided to open up a facility that
[3:41:46.160 --> 3:41:51.600]  would really cater to not only a private citizen but also law enforcement so they
[3:41:51.600 --> 3:41:55.760]  could train together and provide a level of training that far exceeds
[3:41:55.760 --> 3:41:58.640]  what the average law enforcement or military
[3:41:58.640 --> 3:42:02.640]  officer could receive from their own agencies or departments and
[3:42:02.640 --> 3:42:06.560]  that's how frontside was born way back in 1996
[3:42:06.560 --> 3:42:11.680]  with 10 students in a two-day defensive handgun class and since that time
[3:42:11.680 --> 3:42:15.840]  we literally have grown doubled and tripled every year
[3:42:15.840 --> 3:42:19.600]  at the point where we now train more people on a single weekend
[3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:24.800]  than most of the major schools train all year so it's really a great opportunity
[3:42:24.800 --> 3:42:28.080]  for people to come out and get a level of training that they can't get
[3:42:28.080 --> 3:42:33.520]  anywhere else at any price and uh display the software with
[3:42:33.520 --> 3:42:36.880]  the free handgun just sweetens it that much more
[3:42:36.880 --> 3:42:40.800]  well people need to stop procrastinating and i know i do it i mean i used to be
[3:42:40.800 --> 3:42:43.600]  really good with a rifle shotgun a handgun now i'm you know better than
[3:42:43.600 --> 3:42:47.360]  average but you really lose it even when you have the training
[3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:51.040]  and people that are scared of guns it's not magic it's not that hard it's a
[3:42:51.040 --> 3:42:54.960]  it's very simple and you guys have the best instructors out there in the
[3:42:54.960 --> 3:42:58.160]  country we're not just saying that frontside.com
[3:42:58.160 --> 3:43:04.160]  doctor i also get a lot of calls but maybe 30 40 percent of our audience
[3:43:04.160 --> 3:43:06.640]  either doesn't have a computer or doesn't like to do things over the
[3:43:06.640 --> 3:43:10.480]  computer is there a number they can call so that they can find out about some
[3:43:10.480 --> 3:43:13.520]  of the different courses and how they can take them
[3:43:13.520 --> 3:43:20.080]  yeah we have a toll-free number it's 800-987-7719 now the last time i gave
[3:43:20.080 --> 3:43:23.680]  this number out it lit our six-line phone tree up for about
[3:43:23.680 --> 3:43:27.280]  an hour so if you call that number and you get a busy
[3:43:27.280 --> 3:43:30.880]  signal it's because uh all of our staff are answering the calls of the other
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:33.360]  listeners but uh just just give us a call back a
[3:43:33.360 --> 3:43:39.200]  little later again it's 1-800-987-7719
[3:43:39.200 --> 3:43:43.440]  and folks don't procrastinate call sign up for it
[3:43:43.440 --> 3:43:47.680]  go take the course get the free handgun uh it's it's the it's the best and the
[3:43:47.680 --> 3:43:51.680]  least expensive out there nationally known it's frontside.com
[3:43:51.680 --> 3:44:00.080]  frontside.com or 800-987-7719-800-987-7719
[3:44:00.080 --> 3:44:04.480]  frontside.com okay in closing doc um
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:07.520]  what is it like to see this assault on the second amendment
[3:44:07.520 --> 3:44:11.200]  and and bills where the attorney general can just say without judge or jury
[3:44:11.200 --> 3:44:14.000]  you can't ever own a gun if you're on a no-fly list a million two hundred
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:17.680]  thousand and growing you can't own a gun bills where he can just ban any guns
[3:44:17.680 --> 3:44:21.360]  he wants with this new executive imperial power
[3:44:21.360 --> 3:44:24.640]  bills to ban importation bills to ban a bunch of
[3:44:24.640 --> 3:44:28.800]  rifles i mean i've never seen such an assault with the media
[3:44:28.800 --> 3:44:33.200]  parroting there is no gun bill there is no anti gun bill there is no gun control
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:36.560]  you know it's a conspiracy theory it's a conspiracy theory like some evil
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:40.160]  parrot uh that seems to really be freaking people out even more
[3:44:40.160 --> 3:44:44.000]  and then they say oh crazy people are buying guns at record levels
[3:44:44.000 --> 3:44:47.360]  but the bills are there
[3:44:47.760 --> 3:44:51.280]  yeah well my my feeling about this has always been that
[3:44:51.280 --> 3:44:55.120]  you know they're not going to fool the american people and that the latest
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:45:00.560]  uh huge buying surge in guns and ammunition i think sent a pretty clear
[3:45:00.560 --> 3:45:03.840]  message uh to the government that you know they're
[3:45:03.840 --> 3:45:07.280]  not fooling anybody and uh this is all you know all the
[3:45:07.280 --> 3:45:11.520]  more reason why just having guns and ammunition and and
[3:45:11.520 --> 3:45:16.080]  survival gear is not enough you really need to have training
[3:45:16.080 --> 3:45:20.000]  so that you know how to use it and uh you know
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:24.640]  there's the purpose of frontside is to positively change
[3:45:24.640 --> 3:45:29.760]  the image of gun ownership by taking you know normal regular
[3:45:29.760 --> 3:45:34.480]  law abiding citizens and bringing them up to a level of skill at arms
[3:45:34.480 --> 3:45:38.160]  that surpasses law enforcement and military standards
[3:45:38.160 --> 3:45:41.920]  so the true backbone the true strength of this country
[3:45:41.920 --> 3:45:45.520]  isn't in a standing army it isn't in the national guard
[3:45:45.520 --> 3:45:49.520]  uh it isn't in the armed services it's in the everyday
[3:45:49.520 --> 3:45:53.680]  average citizen who stands ready willing and able to defend himself his
[3:45:53.680 --> 3:45:57.760]  family his community and his country if needed you know from any enemies foreign
[3:45:57.760 --> 3:46:00.400]  or domestic so that's what we're all about
[3:46:00.400 --> 3:46:05.760]  and we teach responsible use of firearms again to levels that exceed that
[3:46:05.760 --> 3:46:09.840]  of the military law enforcement but the difference is we do it in a very
[3:46:09.840 --> 3:46:13.680]  compassionate caring environment there's no boot camp mentality there's no
[3:46:13.680 --> 3:46:16.640]  drill instructor attitudes you literally can bring your
[3:46:16.640 --> 3:46:20.080]  you know your wife and your kids to frontside
[3:46:20.080 --> 3:46:24.880]  and they're all going to experience a positive life changing
[3:46:24.880 --> 3:46:27.920]  experience their front sites where they leave empowered
[3:46:27.920 --> 3:46:32.160]  and have the ability to defend themselves with the weapon of their choice
[3:46:32.160 --> 3:46:35.360]  well that's the bottom line and i know you've said that even if people don't
[3:46:35.360 --> 3:46:38.880]  get the training from you they better get some basic training somewhere
[3:46:38.880 --> 3:46:42.160]  in this dangerous world people defending themselves as the number one
[3:46:42.160 --> 3:46:45.360]  skill children should be taught young people before they're taught
[3:46:45.360 --> 3:46:47.360]  anything but of course that's not taught it's like it's
[3:46:47.360 --> 3:46:51.280]  bad to be able to defend yourself and of course as thomas everson said the
[3:46:51.280 --> 3:46:55.440]  you know the firearm is the best way uh it's certainly good to be
[3:46:55.440 --> 3:46:58.640]  you know physically fit as well in in hand to hand combat and
[3:46:58.640 --> 3:47:02.240]  things like that but it but the firearm is the best and most efficient way

[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:45.520]  i've i've been a fan of yours for a long time but anyway
[3:47:45.520 --> 3:47:52.640]  i was wondering if you had read or seen uh this uh that was printed in
[3:47:52.640 --> 3:47:59.840]  august nineteen nineteen forty six um rules for revolution
[3:47:59.840 --> 3:48:04.240]  yeah that's uh sol olenski out of chicago
[3:48:04.240 --> 3:48:08.240]  and he dedicated the book to lucifer
[3:48:08.240 --> 3:48:12.160]  uh but i i just have the little little reprint
[3:48:12.160 --> 3:48:15.920]  of of a uh paper that was confiscated
[3:48:15.920 --> 3:48:23.120]  and dusseldorf in 1919 oh no you're too no it was way before 1919 um rules for
[3:48:23.120 --> 3:48:27.360]  radicals i think sol olenski in fact google that for me guys rules for radicals
[3:48:27.360 --> 3:48:31.600]  i think he wrote that in uh in like the 50s or something i forget the exact
[3:48:31.600 --> 3:48:34.560]  i've scanned through the book i've got a copywriter somewhere
[3:48:34.560 --> 3:48:39.920]  and then hundreds of years ago back in the 1770s the illuminati the guy got
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:43.600]  struck by lightning it wasn't in it it wasn't the last century
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:48.240]  so i'm not really following you well i just any anyway
[3:48:48.240 --> 3:48:53.600]  what i'm what i was looking at as as i've been listening to you i've been
[3:48:53.600 --> 3:48:57.440]  rereading it and and there's seven of these
[3:48:57.440 --> 3:49:03.440]  arguments uh to to go through to get control of all means of publicity
[3:49:03.440 --> 3:49:06.880]  thereby get the people's minds off of government
[3:49:06.880 --> 3:49:10.960]  and focus their attention on athletics
[3:49:10.960 --> 3:49:18.400]  sex books plays and other trivia and divide the people into hostile groups
[3:49:18.400 --> 3:49:22.240]  uh destroy the people's faith in the natural leadership ability
[3:49:22.240 --> 3:49:28.480]  and and and religious affiliations uh always preach uh true democracy but
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:32.880]  sees power as ruthlessly as possible
[3:49:32.880 --> 3:49:37.440]  by oh yeah that's the communist uh see see i think you did you say rules for
[3:49:37.440 --> 3:49:40.160]  radicals or what did you say the name of this is
[3:49:40.160 --> 3:49:44.400]  it is titled rules for revolution
[3:49:44.400 --> 3:49:48.480]  oh yeah that's a communist document read the congressional record
[3:49:48.480 --> 3:49:53.680]  i think in the late 40s and so that's separate yes i've read that on air
[3:49:53.680 --> 3:49:59.680]  oh okay well i you know as i've been listening i did and reading that
[3:49:59.680 --> 3:50:04.240]  we're right there we're everything that is
[3:50:04.240 --> 3:50:08.880]  stated in this is happening right now in our no no i mean yes the bankers
[3:50:08.880 --> 3:50:12.720]  finance communism and it's a way to overthrow and kill the
[3:50:12.720 --> 3:50:16.640]  middle class and they really want to do it i mean this guy is the front man if
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:19.920]  he was able to do it they want to bankrupt everybody and everybody under
[3:50:19.920 --> 3:50:23.360]  their control because that's what goldman sacks and the big banks want
[3:50:23.360 --> 3:50:28.000]  they want to make everybody their slaves yes and then of course it's the last
[3:50:28.000 --> 3:50:31.680]  one that's on here that i read is cause
[3:50:31.680 --> 3:50:37.120]  registration of all firearms on some pretext with a view of confiscating them
[3:50:37.120 --> 3:50:40.400]  and leaving the population yeah no that's a soviet document that's been
[3:50:40.400 --> 3:50:43.360]  proven yes i'm aware that i'm sorry i got confused

[3:54:28.160 --> 3:54:32.160]  take shots i'm not taking the shot i don't trust
[3:54:32.160 --> 3:54:35.680]  anything these eugenicists give there could be some deadly plague killing
[3:54:35.680 --> 3:54:40.320]  everybody i'm not taking it they've been caught sterilizing people with these
[3:54:40.320 --> 3:54:44.160]  i had a medical doctor who runs the big huge flu tracking website
[3:54:44.160 --> 3:54:48.320]  on to give you his perspective we have multiple views here you
[3:54:48.320 --> 3:54:52.400]  make your decision it's not like we're catholic and i'm the pope or something
[3:54:52.400 --> 3:54:57.040]  and what i say you do and i say eat fish on friday and you go do it
[3:54:57.040 --> 3:55:01.840]  or or or you know we're all jewish and i'm your rabbi and i'm saying don't eat pork
[3:55:01.840 --> 3:55:05.680]  it's a free country you can do what you want we're going to have other medical
[3:55:05.680 --> 3:55:09.520]  doctors on i just saw nymans thing years ago saw his flu tracker
[3:55:09.520 --> 3:55:14.000]  and it was about this much thought get that guy on let's get his perspective
[3:55:14.000 --> 3:55:17.120]  uh you know that's what how it works i go this looks interesting get them on
[3:55:17.120 --> 3:55:21.440]  it's not like it's some giant you know master calculation of what to do
[3:55:21.440 --> 3:55:25.280]  we don't know what's going to happen with this flu i don't trust this criminal
[3:55:25.280 --> 3:55:29.120]  government as far as i can throw them
[3:55:29.120 --> 3:55:32.320]  comprende so
[3:55:32.560 --> 3:55:36.320]  i think it's all about your height 1700 dead he said
[3:55:36.320 --> 3:55:40.800]  couple hundred in the u.s said it's 300 now i mean compared to regular flu
[3:55:40.800 --> 3:55:43.440]  that's nothing he seems to think it's incredibly bad and
[3:55:43.440 --> 3:55:46.560]  going to mutate sounds like baloney to me but he's a
[3:55:46.560 --> 3:55:49.760]  virologist and medical doctor there are other medical doctors saying it's
[3:55:49.760 --> 3:55:54.160]  manufactured he says it isn't so we're going to give you all
[3:55:54.160 --> 3:55:56.320]  views here and then i'm going to tell you what i think
[3:55:56.320 --> 3:55:59.760]  we are speculating when we speculate we lay it out
[3:55:59.760 --> 3:56:03.600]  we're not speculating about mass graves in fema and the military and how it all
[3:56:03.600 --> 3:56:07.440]  looks like it's built up in stage to this point
[3:56:07.440 --> 3:56:11.840]  so uh where i stand is very very clear on that
[3:56:11.840 --> 3:56:16.000]  god it's like uh i'm the prophet or something and everything i say is this
[3:56:16.000 --> 3:56:20.240]  and you know absolutely gospel when i believe something a hundred percent i'll
[3:56:20.240 --> 3:56:23.200]  tell you on this flu thing we know it's a hoax
[3:56:23.200 --> 3:56:26.960]  the question is how bad is it going to be is it real
[3:56:26.960 --> 3:56:30.160]  everything in my gut tells me it's staged all the evidence shows that i just
[3:56:30.160 --> 3:56:34.000]  don't know what they're planning to stage i can just see when it's staged
[3:56:34.000 --> 3:56:37.760]  you can see them all dressed up in their actors and they're following scripts and
[3:56:37.760 --> 3:56:41.920]  it's all set up all right let's talk to um
[3:56:41.920 --> 3:56:47.200]  steward mass steward go ahead hey i've been listening to you for a long time
[3:56:47.200 --> 3:56:50.560]  and uh when you're wrong you admit it and sometimes you
[3:56:50.560 --> 3:56:53.920]  call things dead on which is a lot and sometimes you
[3:56:53.920 --> 3:56:57.440]  sort of brush things with a wide stroke because there's
[3:56:57.440 --> 3:57:00.480]  a lot of different possibilities like they could go they could
[3:57:00.480 --> 3:57:04.080]  try to push something find out it's not working back off like you say you know
[3:57:04.080 --> 3:57:07.680]  what i mean and just exactly so many times
[3:57:07.680 --> 3:57:10.880]  so many times we know they're going to do something we all you the listeners
[3:57:10.880 --> 3:57:14.400]  expose them they change plans but i can't expect it to be
[3:57:14.400 --> 3:57:18.000]  who's the guy in the x-files who's psychic and knows that i mean i don't
[3:57:18.000 --> 3:57:22.800]  know what color cars are driving down the road a mile from here i'm not psychic
[3:57:22.800 --> 3:57:25.920]  i don't know if it's going to rain tomorrow i'm not a weatherman
[3:57:25.920 --> 3:57:29.280]  i mean i can't expect to be totally psychic and know everything
[3:57:29.280 --> 3:57:33.520]  i'm just here doing a radio show having guests on go ahead
[3:57:33.520 --> 3:57:38.320]  yeah it's like just part of the math uh psychosis or whatever you want you
[3:57:38.320 --> 3:57:41.520]  thought we're everybody well criticizing each other down here
[3:57:41.520 --> 3:57:46.000]  meanwhile they're killing us but um i believe like you said i believe that
[3:57:46.000 --> 3:57:49.760]  whether or not it's it's real or not now i think they're so
[3:57:49.760 --> 3:57:52.880]  psycho even if they do try to come out with something
[3:57:52.880 --> 3:57:57.760]  that's you know more mild of a flu eventually if they really get desperate
[3:57:57.760 --> 3:58:00.960]  they will release something bad though i believe these people
[3:58:00.960 --> 3:58:07.440]  are trying to like soft kill like this almost like they're they're pushing
[3:58:07.440 --> 3:58:11.200]  like they're gonna like like if you take all the issues you talk about
