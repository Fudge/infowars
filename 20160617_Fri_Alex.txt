[00:00.000 --> 00:20.880]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover us you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[00:20.880 --> 00:38.680]  live on this Friday June 17 2016 edition of the Alex Jones show I'm Paul Joseph Watson
[00:38.680 --> 00:43.840]  I'll be sitting in for Alex for the first half of this broadcast then David Knight will
[00:43.840 --> 00:49.960]  be coming in with his take his perspective on current events Alex will be joining as
[00:49.960 --> 00:54.880]  he'll be filing some special reports so be sure to stay tuned for that coming up later
[00:54.880 --> 01:00.440]  in the show as far as the news is concerned well it's obviously hot right now the top
[01:00.440 --> 01:07.040]  of drudge report Obama imports one million Muslims during presidency he's also linked
[01:07.040 --> 01:13.280]  up there my story from a few days ago Islamic speaker admits killing gays belief held by
[01:13.280 --> 01:18.480]  moderate believers and of course this has been a massive argument in the aftermath of
[01:18.480 --> 01:26.040]  the Orlando shootings the fact that the left has abandoned has betrayed the gay community
[01:26.040 --> 01:32.280]  in favor of being politically correct in favor of appeasing Muslims they care more about
[01:32.280 --> 01:38.800]  protecting the feelings of Muslims than they do protecting the lives of gay people so now
[01:38.800 --> 01:43.680]  on the other side of the Atlantic which we're going to get to as well we've got David Cameron's
[01:43.680 --> 01:50.280]  right stag fire event basically happened yesterday with the Brexit vote the vote for the United
[01:50.280 --> 01:56.040]  Kingdom to leave the European Union of course over the past two weeks or so the vote leave
[01:56.040 --> 02:03.200]  camp has been pulling ahead in the polls having been behind all along because immigration
[02:03.200 --> 02:08.360]  was put at the top of the agenda the vote leave campaign finally realized that this
[02:08.360 --> 02:14.980]  is the issue that British people care about it got put to the top of the agenda the polls
[02:14.980 --> 02:22.320]  start to swing the other way and what happens we have a mentally ill person murder a labor
[02:22.320 --> 02:30.160]  MP on the streets of Britain and they wasted absolutely no time whatsoever in hijacking
[02:30.160 --> 02:36.640]  this in exploiting this before this mother of two was even dead while she was still
[02:36.640 --> 02:45.800]  in the hospital they were using this to demonize the pro Brexit camp absolutely shameful from
[02:45.800 --> 02:51.560]  labor from the political establishment from the mainstream media we're going to get into
[02:51.560 --> 02:57.960]  that we've got Joy Bahar from the view which is a show watched by you know three million
[02:57.960 --> 03:03.120]  people every day it's quite important reaches a wide number of individuals saying that Donald
[03:03.120 --> 03:10.080]  Trump is quote working with ISIS to kill us that's her nuanced and cogent analysis of
[03:10.080 --> 03:18.160]  the Colorado gay nightclub massacre but she's got an ally in the form of former CIA head
[03:18.160 --> 03:24.960]  Leon Panetta who said that Trump is quote aiding and abetting terrorists by simply pointing
[03:24.960 --> 03:31.920]  out that the US can try they help build up they help create ISIS in their bid to topple
[03:31.920 --> 03:38.120]  Bashar al-Assad so you've got the most ridiculous absurd comments from someone like Joy Bahar
[03:38.120 --> 03:44.640]  on the view being mirrored by the former CIA head Leon Panetta we're going to get to some
[03:44.640 --> 03:51.280]  of those clips after the break State Department officials dozens of them are once again lobbying
[03:51.280 --> 03:58.720]  for US military action in Syria but not against ISIS against the government of Bashar al-Assad
[03:58.720 --> 04:05.200]  that is fighting ISIS so they're still trying to get that act of regime change through even
[04:05.200 --> 04:11.400]  though arming the jihadist rebels in the first place was exactly what led to the rise of
[04:11.400 --> 04:18.840]  ISIS to San Bernardino to the attack in Colorado on Saturday night so we're going to get into
[04:18.840 --> 04:22.920]  all that and more we've got Washington Post reporting six in ten of you will share this
[04:22.920 --> 04:27.960]  link without reading it they've done a study where six in ten links that are shared on
[04:27.960 --> 04:33.000]  the internet are not actually read by the people sharing them which again goes right
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.080]  to the heart of the left and virtue signaling and how they create how they can try this
[04:38.080 --> 04:45.880]  phony narrative based on virtue signaling based on artificial promotion of narratives
[04:45.880 --> 04:51.560]  that are completely untrue so we're going to get into all that and more after the break
[04:51.560 --> 04:59.360]  if this is the Alex Jones show live breaking news at info wars dot com don't go away we'll
[04:59.360 --> 05:05.480]  be right back everyone Obama and Trump as well as the NRA and LGBT lobbyists are saying
[05:05.480 --> 05:10.120]  the Orlando shooting requires new gun control measures because it's now an issue of national
[05:10.120 --> 05:15.680]  security Democrats in Congress just ended a 15 hour filibuster Republicans have caved
[05:15.680 --> 05:19.960]  and said they will hold a vote on whether to block people who have just been labeled
[05:19.960 --> 05:24.980]  a terrorist remember this is secretly and without trial people are put on terror watch
[05:24.980 --> 05:29.800]  lists and no fly watch lists without their knowledge without being told of the charges
[05:29.800 --> 05:35.200]  against them without being able to confront their accusers in an open trial by jury now
[05:35.200 --> 05:40.840]  we're going to apply punishments and sanctions against them this is a star chamber process
[05:40.840 --> 05:45.480]  that the bill of rights was written to stop terror attacks are not a gun control issue
[05:45.480 --> 05:50.160]  if they're a border control issue without background checks for migrants terrorists are free to use
[05:50.160 --> 05:56.120]  nuclear biological or chemical weapons a rifle may be your only defense against that kind

[08:19.000 --> 08:25.240]  show
[08:26.040 --> 08:32.840]  like live it's the alex jones show now if you want to see one of the most moronic youtube clips of
[08:32.840 --> 08:39.480]  2016 so far and let's be honest it's got some pretty stiff competition this was on the view i
[08:39.480 --> 08:45.240]  believe yesterday afternoon yesterday morning it's the views joy bahar and again bear in mind
[08:45.240 --> 08:51.560]  this show gets three million viewers every day that's no small fry they've got a very large audience
[08:51.560 --> 08:59.960]  of very impressionable people who are also quite stupid so she gets up there and responds to donald
[08:59.960 --> 09:06.120]  trump's comments about the gay nightclub massacre in colorado by saying that donald trump is quote
[09:06.120 --> 09:15.320]  working with isis to kill us let's start this clip they also don't have any ties right now between the
[09:15.320 --> 09:20.520]  shooter and isis at all at all they think you you know except for one phone call which everybody
[09:20.520 --> 09:27.000]  reminds me of his pause so that's one of the other guests on the show saying that oma matine
[09:27.000 --> 09:35.080]  the pulse nightclub gunman had no ties whatsoever to isis he only called cops during the massacre
[09:35.080 --> 09:41.880]  to pledge allegiance to isis he only pledged allegiance to isis on facebook during the massacre
[09:42.440 --> 09:49.560]  and the islamic state also claimed responsibility for the attack but again nothing to do with isis
[09:49.560 --> 09:55.080]  okay let's carry on with the clip he mentions isis but that doesn't make him tied i agree so he
[09:55.080 --> 09:59.960]  mentioned the whole lot of you said he was aligned with the whole lot of folks listen nobody's gonna
[09:59.960 --> 10:05.960]  know what the answer is okay the thing is the thing about trump though is that he's the recruiter
[10:05.960 --> 10:13.320]  in chief he is for isa he is basically working with isis yes to kill us they are working together
[10:13.320 --> 10:18.360]  yes remember what i'm saying and why do you say this because every time you go after the muslims
[10:18.360 --> 10:22.920]  and you talk about how they shouldn't come into the country and how they're all a bunch of whatever's
[10:22.920 --> 10:29.160]  you are saying to isis make another video to show people who are sympathetic to your cause and don't
[10:29.160 --> 10:36.200]  forget to pause so she's making the argument that donald trump is working with isis to killers
[10:36.200 --> 10:41.720]  those are her exact words because he dares to point out that we have a problem with islamic
[10:41.720 --> 10:47.400]  terrorism you know that's like the equivalent of saying don't draw cartoons of muhammad because it
[10:47.400 --> 10:53.720]  might trigger it might upset the precious muslims and they might kill us they might chop off our
[10:53.720 --> 11:00.760]  heads so we better respect their feelings again completely insane and it gets even worse let's
[11:00.760 --> 11:07.480]  carry on i haven't made many videos showing donald trump he is a dangerous menace to the country
[11:07.480 --> 11:14.520]  and i believe and another point one small point about the gun which i wake up in the morning i'm
[11:14.520 --> 11:21.640]  so stressed out because people are actually continuing to say have more guns since 2005
[11:21.640 --> 11:30.440]  half of all mass killings have occurred in this country in 2005 is when the fbi statistics every
[11:30.440 --> 11:36.920]  crime statistic you want to look at mass shootings are down not that this has much to do with mass
[11:36.920 --> 11:42.120]  shootings it has everything to do with radical islamic terrorism continue with the clip
[11:45.000 --> 11:51.080]  ban was lifted during the bush administration w that is when half of all mass killings
[11:51.080 --> 11:58.040]  started in 2005 since the ban was lifted so it's so facto there is a connection to the guns
[11:58.040 --> 12:04.760]  can i also say that i think it's very interesting it's interesting to me that uh it's very telling
[12:04.760 --> 12:11.720]  that the first thing he they notice about the shooter is that you know that he's he's uh he's
[12:11.720 --> 12:17.720]  muslim right instead of exactly you know and it's that thing where it's she's complaining that the
[12:17.720 --> 12:23.400]  first thing anybody noticed about the shooter was that he was muslim and in the background you hear
[12:23.400 --> 12:28.760]  one of the other guests i think it's actually joy behar herself say that that's that's a racial thing
[12:28.760 --> 12:36.680]  to say first of all islam is not a race may i may i remind you of that fact second of all of course
[12:36.680 --> 12:42.680]  we're going to draw attention to the fact that he's muslim you had isis in their own publications
[12:42.680 --> 12:48.440]  calling for people to hit soft targets calling for people to carry out stabbings calling for
[12:48.440 --> 12:54.760]  people to carry out mass shootings specifically during the month of ramadan but again nothing to
[12:54.760 --> 13:00.600]  do with islam so of course people are going to draw attention to the fact that he's a muslim a
[13:00.600 --> 13:07.240]  matter of you know six months ago or less we had san bernadino another islamic terror attack
[13:07.240 --> 13:13.800]  these things are getting worse because isis is calling for them the shooter pledged allegiance
[13:13.800 --> 13:20.680]  to isis he was a devout muslim he used to get angry he used to get triggered and threatened to kill
[13:20.680 --> 13:27.320]  people at barbecues because a bit of their pork touched his hamburger i mean this guy was completely
[13:27.320 --> 13:34.280]  crazy he was a registered democrat you know he was motivated by a hateful ideology defended and
[13:34.280 --> 13:40.840]  supported by the left islam so obviously we're going to talk about it we're going to draw attention
[13:40.840 --> 13:45.880]  to it let's carry on with the clip very telling to see the assumptions that are made hate is hate
[13:45.880 --> 13:53.000]  we all know it but it is hard you have never heard of a a mass strangling anywhere you go
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.360]  now that's right to the point you don't see mass you don't see mass stabbings where someone just
[13:58.360 --> 14:06.920]  went crazy multiple times a year in china where guns are more restricted they have mass stabbings
[14:06.920 --> 14:14.360]  a major one carried out in 2014 which killed 29 people in the vast majority of those cases
[14:14.360 --> 14:21.720]  stabbings are carried out by radical muslims so yes we do have mass stabbings carried out in
[14:21.720 --> 14:28.360]  pursuit of the same cause again total nonsense let's carry on with the clip and people waited
[14:28.360 --> 14:33.880]  in line to get one guy killed 50 people how did he do that exactly that rifle and i think it's
[14:33.880 --> 14:39.160]  interesting for me for me being a brown person in him in the united states i will tell you
[14:39.160 --> 14:45.320]  past year or so since someone announced their candidacy i was actually now seen as a
[14:45.320 --> 14:52.600]  a non-american and that is very hard for me in my day-to-day life sometimes when people see that
[14:52.600 --> 14:59.320]  that's when you know that something's wrong somebody was mean to her and she she doesn't
[14:59.320 --> 15:05.880]  even provide provide the specific example of what happened and she blames it on donald trump
[15:06.440 --> 15:12.200]  the fact that some race somebody made a racist comment to her over the past you know eight
[15:12.200 --> 15:18.600]  ten months since trump announced his candidacy that's donald trump's fault everything is trump's
[15:18.600 --> 15:24.360]  fault the violence aimed at donald trump supporters at rallies across the country is donald trump's
[15:24.360 --> 15:31.800]  fault the colorado shooter a registered democrat a devout muslim somebody motivated by a hateful
[15:31.800 --> 15:40.680]  ideology defended and supported by the left must be donald trump's fault total absolute
[15:40.680 --> 15:46.280]  nonsense from beginning to end total lies but it's not just the view that's coming out with this
[15:46.280 --> 15:53.000]  this is up on info wars dot com right now former cia head trump is co-aiding and abetting terrorist
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.680]  the former director of the cia leon panetta has said that gp nominee donald trump is effectively
[15:58.680 --> 16:05.080]  helping the enemies of america with divisive rhetoric again whenever you see them use this
[16:05.080 --> 16:13.240]  term divisive rhetoric that means anyone who is standing up for principles anyone they call it
[16:13.240 --> 16:23.160]  divisive total total fraud appearing on msnbc panetta cia head under obama from 2009 to 2011
[16:23.800 --> 16:28.840]  said quote in 50 years in public life i have never experienced a major party candidate
[16:28.840 --> 16:34.440]  making the accusations and raising the innuendos that donald trump raised particularly at this
[16:34.440 --> 16:40.760]  moment of crisis bearing in mind that trump basically predicted what would happen in paris
[16:40.760 --> 16:45.880]  he predicted what would happen in brussels he's been dead on all along you can argue about his
[16:45.880 --> 16:53.400]  methods for dealing with it but again raising innuendos by simply talking about islamic
[16:53.400 --> 17:00.440]  terrorism this this is the most shocking thing that panetta has heard in 50 years of public life
[17:00.440 --> 17:07.160]  totally overblown total hyperbole he goes on to say quote he's not only accusing the president of
[17:07.160 --> 17:11.560]  the united states of treason and collaborating with the enemy but in many ways what he's saying
[17:11.560 --> 17:15.880]  about restricting muslims from coming into this country doing surveillance on muslim mosques
[17:15.880 --> 17:21.320]  is basically aiding and abetting then the enemy at a time we ought to be unifying and he goes on
[17:21.320 --> 17:28.040]  to criticize trump because trump came out with this tweet in which he said that he posted a link
[17:28.040 --> 17:35.000]  to a breitbart story which is that hillary clinton had the memo that obama admin aided group that
[17:35.000 --> 17:41.720]  became isis this is a story we posted upon informals.com yesterday detailing which we've
[17:41.720 --> 17:47.320]  documented for years that when the obama administration went into syria went into libya
[17:47.880 --> 17:55.480]  to arm to fund those jihadist groups el nuzra who later went on to defect to join to pledge
[17:55.480 --> 18:03.240]  allegiance to isis that's what helped isis grow in the first place when we say the us government
[18:03.800 --> 18:10.200]  contrived created isis we don't mean out of thin air they already took the jihadist rebel groups
[18:10.200 --> 18:15.640]  the extremists that were in that region gave them weapons gave them funding they rebranded
[18:15.640 --> 18:22.200]  and everybody pledged allegiance to them so yes clinton and obama are directly responsible
[18:22.200 --> 18:27.640]  for isis has spread across the middle east and that's precisely what trump is referring to
[18:27.640 --> 18:34.680]  when he links to this breitbart article which details this secret memo and this is the article
[18:34.680 --> 18:39.400]  the obama administration supported the terrorist group that became isis as the group struggled
[18:39.400 --> 18:44.280]  to gain control of the syria-irac border where isis now claims it's caliphate according to an
[18:44.280 --> 18:49.800]  intelligence report sent to hillary clinton breitbart news reported tuesday on a secret
[18:49.800 --> 18:54.360]  classified intelligence report sent to then secretary of state clinton and other top u.s
[18:54.360 --> 19:00.520]  officials in august 2012 the report confirmed that western and gulf states are joining with turkey
[19:01.160 --> 19:09.000]  who still gives medical aid gives weapons to isis in that same area joining with turkey again to
[19:09.000 --> 19:19.480]  support isis to support the opposition to bashar al-sad instrumental in the rise of isis documented
[19:19.480 --> 19:26.440]  fact so no matter how much you know panetta blusters about how shocked he is that trump would even

[24:07.720 --> 24:23.960]  Alex Jones is going to be popping in with a special report in the next segment about media
[24:23.960 --> 24:29.560]  deception surrounding Donald Trump which is exactly what I was talking about before the break now
[24:29.560 --> 24:38.040]  Leon Panetta former CIA head is triggered is shocked by the fact that Trump is daring to draw
[24:38.040 --> 24:45.640]  attention to the fact that the US government aided the rise of ISIS by arming by funding
[24:45.640 --> 24:51.720]  jihadist groups in the Middle East that went on to become the Islamic State we know this to be a
[24:51.720 --> 24:57.080]  fact so for him to get out there and bluster and pretend that it's some shocking revelation some
[24:57.080 --> 25:03.080]  some insult to reality is completely bizarre and on that very subject we've got this article out of
[25:03.080 --> 25:09.320]  RT hawks rising dozens of State Department officials call for US strikes against Assad in
[25:09.320 --> 25:15.880]  Syria because the destabilization of Syria over the past four or five years has not proved disastrous
[25:15.880 --> 25:21.800]  enough right we've got the biggest terrorist group the biggest threat probably ever spreading
[25:21.800 --> 25:27.080]  across the Middle East we've got ISIS inspired extremists carrying out attacks in the United
[25:27.080 --> 25:34.120]  States no that's not enough let's destabilize things even more by overthrowing secular governments
[25:34.120 --> 25:40.600]  by leaving a vacuum for these extremists to come in and take power bucking current US policy dozens
[25:40.600 --> 25:45.240]  of State Department officials have reportedly signed an internal document calling for military
[25:45.240 --> 25:50.440]  action and regime change in Syria claiming it's the only way to defeat Islamic State and end the war
[25:50.440 --> 25:57.400]  so the only way to defeat Islamic State is to remove the government and the military that is
[25:57.960 --> 26:03.160]  fighting the Islamic State okay that doesn't really make sense to me the dissenting document
[26:03.160 --> 26:08.840]  was transmitted internally and signed by about 50 mid to high level department officials according
[26:08.840 --> 26:15.240]  to the associate oppress the agency said it has since been classified this is a quote the moral
[26:15.240 --> 26:20.600]  rationale for taking steps to end the deaths and suffering in Syria after five years of brutal
[26:20.600 --> 26:25.640]  war is evident and unquestionable the new york times quoted the document as saying the status
[26:25.640 --> 26:31.080]  quo in Syria will continue to present increasingly dire if not disastrous humanitarian diplomatic
[26:31.080 --> 26:39.320]  and terrorism related challenges so again removing the government the military from power that is the
[26:39.320 --> 26:47.080]  primary fighting force in Syria against ISIS that's how they're gonna defeat ISIS yeah you're
[26:47.080 --> 26:52.520]  gonna have to run that one by me again because i'm not quite computing it but remember you know
[26:52.520 --> 26:59.240]  last year obama put out this order where he said any military target in Syria is a legitimate target
[26:59.240 --> 27:04.680]  so basically they could bomb the presidential palace and say it was just part of anti-isis
[27:04.680 --> 27:11.560]  operations because the agenda all along has not been to take out isis that's why they didn't form
[27:11.560 --> 27:18.360]  the oil fields that's why they're doing nothing about turkey continuing to fund to allow free
[27:18.360 --> 27:25.720]  passage to give medical care to isis fighters that's why they still refuse to even talk to
[27:25.720 --> 27:31.160]  russia basically during that whole bombardment where russia had them on the run so they're
[27:31.160 --> 27:36.840]  following the same insane disastrous policy again there's such opposition to it within the
[27:36.840 --> 27:43.160]  military thankfully we saw the big protest back a few years ago you know not in my name the people
[27:43.160 --> 27:50.200]  holding up the signs the active duty service members i will not be al qaeda's air force so
[27:50.200 --> 27:55.880]  there's a huge element within the military which knows what this is about they know it's not about
[27:55.880 --> 28:01.640]  fighting isis they know it's about regime change it's about toppling a secular leader that is against
[28:01.640 --> 28:09.800]  isis that is against radical sunni islam just as gdapi was in libya you know the most prosperous
[28:09.800 --> 28:15.480]  country in africa at the time a decent place to go and visit if you were took if you were a tourist
[28:15.480 --> 28:22.520]  secular government he had the radical islamists on the run they took him out and look what happened
[28:22.520 --> 28:29.400]  it led to the biggest migration crisis in the history of the world and all the disastrous
[28:29.400 --> 28:34.760]  consequences that that brings with it so now they're going to try and double down and do
[28:34.760 --> 28:41.160]  the same thing in syria absolutely disastrous policy but they're still intent on following it
[28:42.120 --> 28:48.040]  now hillary clinton wasted little time in raising money off the orlando terrorist attack this is
[28:48.040 --> 28:53.480]  out the american mirror no tragic event not even in islamic terrorist attack killing 49 people on
[28:53.480 --> 29:00.040]  u.s. soil is off limits from hillary's drubbing for money which is no surprise given that it's
[29:00.040 --> 29:07.800]  now been revealed 20 of her entire campaign has been funded by saudi arabia okay so this is this
[29:07.800 --> 29:12.920]  is the big feminist candidate now who was it opera the other day came out and said we need hillary
[29:12.920 --> 29:17.720]  because she's a woman she's got a vagina that's the only thing she's got going for her okay so
[29:17.720 --> 29:24.840]  she's this great feminist candidate fine then why is her campaign 20 funded by a government by a
[29:24.840 --> 29:31.480]  regime that doesn't even allow women to drive that still allows women to be stoned to death that
[29:31.480 --> 29:37.640]  still allows gay people to be killed not really very progressive is it so this idea that she's
[29:37.640 --> 29:43.640]  this big feminist candidate when she's being funded by the most misogynistic regime on earth is
[29:43.640 --> 29:48.520]  completely laughable we'll be back with more after the break this is the alex joneshow live
[29:48.520 --> 29:55.560]  info on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:59.800 --> 30:04.680]  a british member of parliament has just been shot with a handgun and stabbed to death with a knife
[30:04.680 --> 30:09.800]  the color got a job six years ago working in a park after being referred by mental health clinic
[30:09.800 --> 30:15.240]  he said working in the park was quote better than all the psychotherapy and medication in the world
[30:15.240 --> 30:19.800]  this happens exactly one week before the breaks at both the referendum on whether britain will
[30:19.800 --> 30:24.600]  leave the european union a fear campaign by prime minister cameron and others has tried without
[30:24.600 --> 30:30.040]  success to scare people about economic recrimination by the bankers and the european elite if they
[30:30.040 --> 30:35.240]  leave now with poll showing leave with a clear majority and remain supporters largely apathetic
[30:35.240 --> 30:39.800]  the shooting has quickly been politicized by the media and the ruling elite to create fear
[30:39.800 --> 30:44.520]  of british nationalism and to energize the supporters of globalism they report the mentally
[30:44.520 --> 30:50.040]  ill man shouted britain first as he shot the uk got gun control decades ago and of course
[30:50.040 --> 30:54.840]  murder rates soared so it won't be used to push for gun control but it will be used to try to

[33:17.080 --> 33:29.000]  info war reporting on this live friday worldwide broadcast we're about to throw it back here in
[33:29.000 --> 33:34.360]  about four or five minutes to paul joseph watson and david night paul reporting from London england
[33:35.080 --> 33:40.680]  david night reporting from austin texas there are a lot of big developments obviously taking
[33:40.680 --> 33:46.120]  place in the world right now i want to address a few of them but number one i want to discuss
[33:46.120 --> 33:53.160]  disinformation there's a lot of different forms of disinformation lies obviously or one type of
[33:53.720 --> 34:00.840]  but it's worse than that we see the mainstream media and it's different menus like joy bayard
[34:00.840 --> 34:08.840]  of the view and the former cia director mr panetta and others we are panetta coming out
[34:08.840 --> 34:18.840]  now in a unified theme today saying that donald trump is the biggest recruiter of ices and
[34:18.840 --> 34:27.160]  that he's quote working with ices and making ices attack us because he's saying we should
[34:27.160 --> 34:34.280]  defeat ices he's saying we should control our borders and vet these people before we let them
[34:34.280 --> 34:42.280]  come in that is saying that two plus two equals four is basically racist and that's what joy
[34:42.280 --> 34:48.840]  bayard also said was that he was racist now we're going to play some of these clips coming up here
[34:48.840 --> 34:55.000]  in a moment paul's going to get to him he's obviously already been talking about it but think
[34:55.000 --> 35:03.160]  about this think about the magnitude of this garbage that we're dealing with that she's saying
[35:03.160 --> 35:09.640]  he's the reason we got attacked in orlando and jacari jackson when he was in atlanta and when
[35:09.640 --> 35:14.680]  joe bich was in dalis and michael zimmerman yesterday talking to the anti-trump people that's one of
[35:14.680 --> 35:19.080]  the most common things they say is that he's the reason we're getting attacked he's the reason
[35:19.080 --> 35:27.240]  orlando happened and he's the reason the economy is in the outhouse so this is just crazy that they
[35:27.240 --> 35:33.160]  will push lies this while but i tell you i was talking to darin migraine yesterday one of our
[35:33.160 --> 35:38.520]  great news analysts and editors and he's going to do a piece on it he said well i'm kind of embarrassed
[35:38.520 --> 35:41.960]  i said why be embarrassed it happened to you this guy's working some of the biggest news companies
[35:41.960 --> 35:46.280]  in the country you know manage hundreds of people a great guy he's paid pretty good at uh
[35:46.920 --> 35:54.840]  info wars but he doesn't want to get obama care he doesn't want to pay what what what the insurance
[35:54.840 --> 36:00.680]  is now because it's a big scam for three years he's been fined first 800 then 1600 now they're
[36:00.680 --> 36:07.480]  going to find him even more and it's the irs that's coming after him remember obama five six years ago
[36:07.480 --> 36:14.360]  saying it was a conspiracy theory and racist to say that there were fines in there more than the irs
[36:14.360 --> 36:20.440]  was hiring 18 000 people to enforce it just that part it was in the bill it was in the bill all we
[36:20.440 --> 36:28.760]  did was show the bill they passed the bill in the first year of obama care the wall street journal
[36:28.760 --> 36:37.800]  reported of all major insurance companies on average went up 47 plus percent like 47.9 memory
[36:37.800 --> 36:44.680]  serves on us just screwing us globally they made that much money but it's okay because it's liberal
[36:44.680 --> 36:51.320]  and obama's black this has nothing to do with it it's a total scam so bayhards blaming uh Trump
[36:52.120 --> 36:56.280]  all this other insanity is going on the former ceo director comes out and says he's the biggest
[36:56.280 --> 37:03.560]  recruiter and says he's never heard of us troops handing out pallets of cash to the iraqis that was
[37:03.560 --> 37:10.280]  on the news in 2003 that's how they got the insurgency to stand down at first it was reportedly
[37:10.280 --> 37:17.800]  20 billion than another 40 billion the numbers vary but upwards of 60 billion dollars or more
[37:17.800 --> 37:23.800]  paid in c 130s full of hundred and 20 dollar bills that was on the news you can pull that up
[37:23.800 --> 37:29.000]  and show people panetta says he never heard of such a thing as the former head of the cia
[37:30.200 --> 37:34.280]  because they know the general public doesn't understand this stuff or doesn't have the
[37:34.280 --> 37:40.600]  attention span or the memory of a goldfish new scientific studies the average american has less
[37:40.600 --> 37:47.000]  of an attention span than a goldfish less than seven seconds now i know our audience because we
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.680]  can see time spent listed the average time has been listed for radios about eight minutes now
[37:50.680 --> 37:55.960]  our average is about 27 minutes you are already the crème dollar crème of people with attention
[37:55.960 --> 38:01.240]  spans but that's why on average you earn more it's why you you you give more charity on average
[38:01.240 --> 38:08.760]  we have old metrics from google it's why you are more aggressive more healthy uh more satisfied
[38:08.760 --> 38:13.320]  because you still have a brain just like i do and again i'm not claiming i'm some rocket scientist
[38:13.320 --> 38:18.760]  here this is just getting crazy and this is a battle between the giant dumbed-down mindless idiot
[38:18.760 --> 38:29.960]  hordes and the american people who are still somewhat away and for them to aid isis the hillary
[38:29.960 --> 38:34.360]  and obama and the globalist and what panetta was in they were doing it too and to give them
[38:34.360 --> 38:38.600]  billions of dollars that were formerly al-qaeda turned libya over to them turned part of syria
[38:38.600 --> 38:44.520]  over to him part of iraq over to him uh let them set up this this this this this saudi back to caliphate
[38:45.240 --> 38:50.040]  and to let them take over and overthrow our allies in egypt and then sit there and blame
[38:50.040 --> 38:57.640]  donald j trump but again if if they succeed in this this is the great triumph of ignorance
[38:57.640 --> 39:03.240]  this is the great triumph of mindlessness this is the great triumph of idiocy just like jakari
[39:04.440 --> 39:10.680]  has the poor black man on tape you know debating the other young black man destroying him and he
[39:10.680 --> 39:16.360]  says donald trump wants to ship africans back to africa black people back to i mean it's the most
[39:16.360 --> 39:20.520]  it's just pure lies but the guy's freaked out believes it because he's being lied to in a
[39:20.520 --> 39:25.320]  trance state by the mainstream media and is genuinely freaked out he's not even a bad person
[39:25.320 --> 39:30.520]  but he's a victim of this idiocy the good news is it only takes three percent to win a fight against
[39:30.520 --> 39:35.720]  the globalist but i want to win an economic war i want to win a renaissance war a war of
[39:35.720 --> 39:40.600]  intellectual ideas and most revolutions are intellectual they're just not cold revolutions
[39:40.600 --> 39:46.360]  because they're one peacefully most successful revolutions are cultural the communists know this
[39:47.480 --> 39:53.160]  they try to train us through hollywood and media and culture that we're supposed to go fight like
[39:53.160 --> 39:59.160]  the running man resorts to nigger you know defeats the corrupt fascist government all by itself that's
[39:59.160 --> 40:07.720]  not how this works ladies and gentlemen we have to come together and realize we're being lied to
[40:08.280 --> 40:12.760]  shift out of the paradigm if you believe obama loves you and you believe the republican leadership
[40:12.760 --> 40:20.200]  loves you you're in a trance you're a chump that's a fact it's not my opinion and you need to understand
[40:20.200 --> 40:24.680]  you're being lied to about obama care and about the nsa and about the open borders and everything
[40:24.680 --> 40:28.040]  else that's happening you need to realize donald trump isn't perfect but he didn't have to get
[40:28.040 --> 40:32.440]  america and he realizes america is being destroyed on the altered globalism and he's speaking out
[40:32.440 --> 40:36.280]  against it and that's why i'm supporting you now there's a lot going on today we have a lot of

[41:39.960 --> 41:45.800]  which i uploaded last night this is a really important video dear gaze the left betrayed you on
[41:45.800 --> 41:52.840]  islam of course in the aftermath of the colorado shooting we've had many people defecting to trump
[41:53.560 --> 41:59.080]  but before we do that i just want to mention the tim kennedy special this is 15 percent off

[42:43.240 --> 42:48.920]  the content from the trump rallies from places like bill de burgue other events challenging the
[42:48.920 --> 42:53.800]  mainstream media in the case of bill de burgue being there in place of the mainstream media
[42:53.800 --> 42:59.080]  because they're too lazy to even send anyone along and of course the trump rallies have completely
[42:59.080 --> 43:04.440]  shifted the narrative back from a few months ago where the violence and the media carried this
[43:04.440 --> 43:11.400]  narrative dutifully was being blamed on trump himself trump supporters we shifted that narrative
[43:11.400 --> 43:17.000]  by getting in the faces of these violent vile social justice warriors leading to the birth of
[43:17.000 --> 43:24.040]  the legend of aid scrillex carla kock and many others so your support has visibly helped us
[43:24.040 --> 43:30.920]  do that and we want to continue in the same vein so go to info wars life dot com to get the products
[43:30.920 --> 43:36.440]  and supporters now i'm going to go to this video shortly and it will conclude after the break
[43:36.440 --> 43:42.840]  because it's about seven minutes long but this morning this afternoon i've been inundated with
[43:42.840 --> 43:51.240]  a ton of positive messages from gay people from people within the lgbt community again expressing
[43:51.240 --> 43:58.040]  this desire this intention to switch their vote for trump because they've been completely abandoned
[43:58.040 --> 44:05.320]  by the left by hillary clinton by obama's refusal to even name radical islamic terrorism by the
[44:05.320 --> 44:12.920]  refusal to point out that violent hatred towards gay people is a belief implicit within islam
[44:12.920 --> 44:18.680]  not extremist islam not radical islam not jihadists and go who go and shoot up nightclubs
[44:18.680 --> 44:25.240]  this is a belief held by the majority of muslims they either want to see gay people behind bars
[44:25.240 --> 44:31.000]  or dead and that's not me saying that you can go and ask them you can go to their conferences
[44:31.000 --> 44:37.160]  as you'll see in this video where they are asked by an islamic speaker these are the punishments
[44:37.160 --> 44:44.360]  decreed by the quran by alla death for homosexuality do you agree with it they all put their hands up
[44:44.360 --> 44:48.520]  he asked them again are you a moderate muslim you're not an extremist you're a moderate muslim
[44:48.520 --> 44:55.480]  yes they all put their hands up these are beliefs held by moderate muslims that article is relinked
[44:55.480 --> 45:02.120]  up at the top of drudgereport.com right now alongside his story about one million muslim
[45:02.120 --> 45:07.240]  migrants admitted to america under obama's rule so be sure and check that out as well
[45:07.240 --> 45:13.160]  but we're going to go to this video now dear gays the left betrayed you for islam here's the clip
[45:13.160 --> 45:19.400]  adding a rainbow filter to your facebook profile picture isn't a substitute for calling out islam's
[45:19.400 --> 45:26.360]  violent hatred towards gays creating some lame sappy hashtag like pray for orlando isn't going to stop
[45:26.360 --> 45:32.200]  islam's violent hatred towards gays tweeting hashtag pray for orlando so you can virtue signal
[45:32.200 --> 45:38.200]  to your friends about how compassionate you are isn't going to stop islam's violent hatred towards
[45:38.200 --> 45:44.120]  gays attending a candlelit vigil so you can smear your facebook profile with selfies for social
[45:44.120 --> 45:50.680]  approval isn't going to stop islam's violent hatred towards gays tweeting hashtag love is love
[45:50.680 --> 45:56.680]  to get one over on right wing christians isn't going to stop islam's violent hatred towards gays
[45:56.680 --> 46:02.200]  tweeting hashtag love is love while you denounce those who stand up for gay rights in muslim countries
[46:02.200 --> 46:08.840]  as islamophobes is not activism risking your life to speak out against actual oppression
[46:08.840 --> 46:14.920]  of gays in muslim countries is labeling people who draw attention to islam's rampant homophobia
[46:14.920 --> 46:22.360]  as divisive isn't going to stop islam's violent hatred towards gays calling the orlando massacre
[46:22.360 --> 46:28.760]  a mass shooting so you can demonize the second amendment and absolve islam of blame isn't going
[46:28.760 --> 46:35.480]  to stop islam's violent hatred towards gays equating christians who refuse to bake gay wedding
[46:35.480 --> 46:43.240]  cakes with jihadists who gun down homosexuals in cold blood isn't an argument hogging a muslim
[46:43.240 --> 46:49.800]  isn't going to stop an ideology that literally wants to destroy western civilization but oma
[46:49.800 --> 46:56.520]  matine is an extremist how dare you blame all muslims for terrorism really so you think islam's
[46:56.520 --> 47:03.320]  hatred for homosexuals is a belief only held by extremists they always can come with the same
[47:03.320 --> 47:12.840]  accusations this speaker supports death penalty for homosexuals this speaker supports death penalty
[47:12.840 --> 47:21.320]  for this crime or this crime or that he is homophobic he they subjugate women etc etc etc
[47:21.320 --> 47:29.240]  it's the same old stuff coming all the time and we always try to tell them i always try to tell them
[47:29.240 --> 47:36.760]  that look it's not that speaker that we're inviting who has these extreme radical views as you say
[47:38.200 --> 47:45.080]  these are general views that every muslim actually has every muslim believes in these things
[47:45.080 --> 47:50.040]  just because they're not telling you about it or just because they're not out there in the media
[47:50.040 --> 47:59.560]  doesn't mean they don't believe in them so i will ask you everyone in the room how many of you are

[54:23.880 --> 54:31.240]  gender neutral pronouns they've told them to be weak to not have self-defense to accept to
[54:31.240 --> 54:38.360]  embrace an ideology that literally wants to put them behind bars for their lifestyle that literally
[54:38.360 --> 54:44.120]  wants to kill them for who they choose to have consensual sex with they've been told to embrace
[54:44.120 --> 54:50.760]  that they've been told you're lower on the totem pole of oppression olympics than muslims so you
[54:50.760 --> 54:55.800]  better bow down now the drudge report has the headline right at the top right now islamic
[54:55.800 --> 55:00.600]  speaker admits killing gays is a belief held by moderate muslims that is the clip that you just
[55:00.600 --> 55:05.560]  heard out that video where they're in norway they're in a western country the speaker asks the
[55:05.560 --> 55:10.920]  moderate muslims are you extremist do you go to normal mosques they're not extremists in their own
[55:10.920 --> 55:17.000]  words they go to normal mosques he says do you support things like the death penalty for homosexuals
[55:17.000 --> 55:25.080]  and adulterers they all raise their hands this is not extremist islam this is moderate islam
[55:25.080 --> 55:32.840]  let's finish the video here it is lgbt community the regressive left does not have your back while
[55:32.840 --> 55:38.520]  telling you to obsess over transgender bathrooms and gender neutral pronouns they're making an
[55:38.520 --> 55:44.840]  alliance with people who literally want to criminalize your lifestyle they're joining forces with a
[55:44.840 --> 55:51.320]  belief system that prescribes death for your consensual sexual choices they're lobbying to
[55:51.320 --> 55:57.960]  import millions more people to the west who totally despise you the left has chosen to protect the
[55:57.960 --> 56:04.440]  feelings of muslims over protecting the lives of gay people the left would rather make excuses for a
[56:04.440 --> 56:11.000]  belief system that led to the slaughter of 49 innocent people at a gay nightclub than god forbid
[56:11.000 --> 56:16.600]  being called islamophobic that's why legions of gay people are vowing to switch their support to
[56:16.600 --> 56:22.760]  trump in the aftermath of allando and even if you hate trump you should also hate the regressive
[56:22.760 --> 56:30.200]  left because they've sold you out they've stabbed you in the back so leftists please stop with the
[56:30.200 --> 56:37.880]  virtue signalling the pointless hashtags the candlelit vigils the cliche is really wearing thin
[56:37.880 --> 56:44.280]  just like they sacrificed western civilization in exchange for political correctness the left
[56:44.280 --> 56:50.840]  has sacrificed the safety of gay people on the altar of multiculturalism lowering the drawbridge
[56:50.840 --> 56:57.560]  for the mono culture of islam that is completely intolerant of any kind of diversity and would
[56:57.560 --> 57:08.120]  rather see gay people behind bars or dead there's the video and again this is what they've taught
[57:08.120 --> 57:16.920]  the lgbt community you must embrace islam in the name of diversity they're embracing a mono culture
[57:16.920 --> 57:24.520]  that completely rejects diversity that is completely intolerant of their very alternative
[57:24.520 --> 57:30.600]  lifestyles but what's positive about this is you saw after colorado people switching their vote
[57:30.600 --> 57:37.080]  to trump gay people in fact i've received a ton of messages just this morning from people responding
[57:37.080 --> 57:42.760]  to the video that you just heard making the same sentiments i'm gonna read one here i'm a gay
[57:42.760 --> 57:47.320]  conservative and i love you i went to a candlelit vigil and was absolutely appalled by the way they
[57:47.320 --> 57:52.360]  classified everyone into little groups and hijacked the event to talk about black lives matter and
[57:52.360 --> 57:58.440]  trans bathrooms then they had an imam from the local mosque come up and speak about how could
[57:58.440 --> 58:04.520]  this happen what could make a person be filled with so much hate well i think we both know what
[58:04.520 --> 58:09.800]  that is he goes on honestly i was just shocked and i came away feeling even more depressed and less
[58:09.800 --> 58:15.000]  like a member of the supposed gay community as a gay conservative in the arts i have to somewhat
[58:15.000 --> 58:20.520]  keep my political views in the closet lest i be ostracized by all the other local musicians and
[58:20.520 --> 58:26.520]  artists and it goes on and again that's the key point leftists are completely intolerant of people
[58:26.520 --> 58:32.920]  with different opinions but what's positive is that now a lot of people within the lgbt crowd are
[58:32.920 --> 58:38.360]  finally starting to see the light they're being redpilled they're coming over to the side of

[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:27.160]  the bottom of the hour to take it in a different direction to cover some other news stories alex
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:31.800]  will be back in the next segment with another special report so we're going to hit a few more
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:37.480]  news stories in this short segment this is out of information liberation gunstore owner we called
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:43.800]  fbi and warn them about allando shooter now we know that uh omar matine and that's allando not
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:49.080]  colorado as i've been saying that was a mistake allando shooting we knew that the shooter was
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.360]  under fbi surveillance for years beforehand they kind of brushed it off that they let him go they
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:59.080]  said he was making these inflammatory statements but there was no actual crime being committed
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:04.840]  he said well now the co-owner of a florida gunstore says his employees contacted law enforcement
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:11.000]  before the allando shooting after gunman omar matine attempted to purchase body armor and ammunition
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:17.160]  now this was four or five weeks ago this wasn't three years ago it was four or five weeks ago
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:24.040]  he goes into this gunstore he asks for level three body armor but the store didn't carry it
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:32.200]  then crucially he made a phone call in arabic before asking for bulk ammunition so again
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:37.800]  we've seen the reports we've seen the analysis there's no way this guy could have carried so much
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:43.000]  ammunition there's no way he could have achieved the bloodshed that he did in allando without
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.280]  some kind of help there have been reports of perhaps security guards helping him out calls
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:53.560]  being made in this instance four weeks before the shooting when he was trying to buy the ammo the
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:02:01.160]  body armor he was making calls in arabic again clearly suggesting a wider plot but they don't
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:05.720]  even want to entertain the notion that there's a wider islamist plot because it would shift the
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:14.040]  narrative further away from gun control you know in mollambique belgium in brussels you can get a
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:21.240]  military-grade weapon on the streets in hours for 400 euros they had no problem acquiring
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:27.320]  military-style weapons in paris to carry out that massacre which of course is one of the strictest
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:34.600]  gun control regulation places in europe so again this is not about gun control they tried to strong
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.520]  arm that narrative into it but if it came out that there were more shooters that there were
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:44.200]  accomplices which a lot of credible people are saying that would demolish their narrative to
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:51.240]  win even greater degree we've also got censorship in the aftermath of allando facebook bans gay
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.520]  magazine critical of islam this is out of bright bar facebook has banned the page of gay magazine
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:01.320]  gay stream after they published an article critical of islam in the wake of the allando massacre
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:08.120]  well how dare they and all they did basically was criticize this um green party individual out of
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:15.560]  germany who said that he was more afraid of white germans than muslims now last time i checked
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:20.120]  white germans don't get together and have huge conferences and all agree that gay people should
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.320]  be put in prison or killed but maybe they do maybe haven't seen those conferences so all this
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:31.960]  gay magazine did was criticize this politician for making those comments it was immediately banned
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:39.000]  on facebook mark kukkeberg wasn't having any of it and then we have this again out of bright bar
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.440]  reddit will adjust algorithm to censor trump supporters following allando shootings so
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:50.520]  basically the donald reddit which i did an am a on a couple of weeks ago alex did one a few days
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:56.520]  ago they were completely dominating the front page of reddit because people are sick to the back
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:03.720]  teeth of being censored so in the name of fairness in the name of what they said was diversity
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:10.840]  they simply changed their algorithm to relegate the donald's content this is a subreddit and
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:17.400]  they relegated people making comments about the allando shooting saying that the guy was a muslim
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:24.280]  that was deemed speculative those comments were relegated in some case people had their accounts
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:31.080]  terminated again this is the key time right after these shootings that's i mean i'm going to go on
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:36.120]  to talk about it with brexit and this joe cox killing the immediate aftermath of the shootings
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:41.800]  is when the narrative is formed and it's very difficult to change that narrative afterwards
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:47.480]  even if the facts are complete on your side which is why they're so intent on censorship
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:53.960]  and the immediate aftermath of any of these kind of mass shooting event will be back to talk about
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.960]  brexit
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:06.280]  everyone obama and trump as well as the nra and lgbt lobbyists are saying the orland of shooting
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:11.720]  requires new gun control measures because it's now an issue of national security democrats in
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:17.240]  congress just ended a 15 hour filibuster republicans have caved and said they will hold a vote on
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:23.080]  whether to block people who have just been labeled a terrorist remember this is secretly and without
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:28.280]  trial people are put on terror watch lists and no fly watch lists without their knowledge without
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:33.880]  being told of the charges against them without being able to confront their accusers in an open
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:39.960]  trial by jury now we're going to apply punishments and sanctions against them this is a star chamber
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:45.400]  process that the bill of rights was written to stop terror attacks are not a gun control issue
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:50.120]  they're a border control issue without background checks for migrants terrorists are free to use

[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:24.040]  live from austin texas broadcasting
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:35.160]  there's a new spin demonizing donald trump vanity fair and hundreds of other publications
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:42.680]  are saying trump really ran for president that is they're implying he ran for president to garner
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:51.000]  a giant database of popular supporters to launch a media empire on cable television that would rival
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.640]  or even dominate fox news but if you actually read what trump is saying he's just sick of going on
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:03.160]  fox and seeing an end and seeing him make tens of millions of dollars per debate or event while
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:09.160]  they badmouth him and he is talking about launching his own type of media system to deliver news during
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:15.480]  the election some are saying hey that violates campaign finance laws well foreign corporations
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:22.600]  in the saw these own much of twitter and fox news why couldn't donald trump with his own money set up
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:27.800]  his own media system then it would be people democratically deciding to tune in to decide
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:33.960]  whether or not it was successful look they call for campaign finance reform all day long but it's
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:39.560]  only because the establishment thinks they have it all sewn up they're scared of a dark horse like
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:44.840]  a donald trump coming in with his own money and launching a brand of nationalist populism that
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:51.800]  they can't compete with they're dying they're falling apart donald trump sees a vacuum so does

[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:38.920]  this live friday show is that media matters openly run by the clintons and the white house says that
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:48.840]  ms nbc panel rips donald trump's racist insinuation that obama supports terrorism ladies and gentlemen
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:55.720]  it's admitted that obama has flooded isis and al-qaeda it's been declassified it's all over the news
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:02.520]  sy harsh pulled a surprise winner has talked about it now when they got embarrassed by it
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:08.200]  they changed the name from al-qaeda to isis about three years ago but this is what's going on this
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:16.040]  is happening and they use a word like racist they said if you read at the obama care bill
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:20.840]  how it gave fines and fees to people that didn't give it you were racist and making it up or that
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:26.200]  if you said it didn't cut your premiums a zero you were a liar of course it came out that it
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:32.360]  did increase premiums and wouldn't let you keep your doctor and did put fines on you
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:42.040]  but in the land of the blind the one eyed man is king as long as the public's ignorant these
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:47.720]  these creditors can continue to lie to the people it's truly sick of it all right back to the live
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:56.840]  transmission with paul oxen david night and the info war we are back it's the alex germshaw live
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:02.280]  now being joined by david night of course to discuss this incident yesterday which was the
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:09.160]  labor mp joe cox again tragically murdered in the north of england she was a pro remain campaigner
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:14.360]  she was um campaigning for the uh for the side that wants to remain in the european union and
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:21.320]  again this didn't happen in a vacuum you look at the polls vote leave was ahead the polls were
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:27.240]  showing in some cases 19 points ahead and more recent polls show four to seven points ahead
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:32.040]  but they swung it around completely before that the vote remain camp was ahead again why is this
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:38.680]  important because it would deal a massive blow to the entire globalist agenda this is part the
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:44.520]  populist revolution sweeping the west it's not only happening in america with trump it's happening
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:50.680]  in europe with the rise of all these conservative parties so this vote next week on the 23rd is a
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:58.200]  huge huge deal this could set their agenda back decades so obviously they have an interest to
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:04.360]  exploit whatever circumstances possible to try and desperately rescue this situation now if you're
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:10.360]  losing the debate if you're losing the argument on immigration on the economy on sovereignty as it
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:17.400]  applies to the european union then what do you do well you exploit the tragic murder of someone
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:23.640]  to make political grift that's exactly what they've done i'm going to get more into the details
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:29.720]  and the latest in a moment but david night what's your take on this joe cox murder you know you're
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:35.400]  absolutely right paul this is an issue that is of international importance because our election here
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:41.080]  in the united states is one really that boils down to globalism versus nationalism we're going to lose
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:46.280]  any chance that we have a restoring individual liberty if power gets more and more consolidated
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:53.160]  and of course if britain will leave the european union then one of these major blocks of consolidation
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:59.400]  the european union towards global governance starts to unravel and we've seen uh efforts as you have
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:04.920]  you mentioned throughout europe different areas talking about the same type of thing so this could
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:11.480]  create momentum and they did have momentum and now it looks like that may get lost this happens
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:17.960]  exactly one week before the election and i think paul it's there may be something more to this than
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:23.160]  just saying uh using this for their own purposes now the wall street journal reports the killing of
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:29.800]  joe cox silences both sides ahead of the uk vote on e u membership they're going to have a massive
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:36.520]  uh memorial service for her on monday but it hasn't really silenced them paul we've got uh
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:42.200]  prime minister cameron who as you know has been pushing for them to remain in the european union
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:48.600]  he said today our nation is rightly shocked where we see hatred where we see division where we see
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:54.040]  intolerance we must drive it from our politics and out of our public life and out of our communities
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:59.000]  you see they were losing and as you pointed out paul you know they they came up with a new strategy
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.080]  what is that wait for it racism that's what uh alex jones is just talking about and so what
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:10.280]  they do is they create a narrative where the remain people where the european union where the
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:17.080]  globalists are just peaceful and inclusive but the other people who want to have the right of
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:22.680]  self-government they're just racist and violent we've had david cameron making all kinds of desperate
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:26.680]  claims that there was going to be a physical war in europe britain got out of the european union
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:32.200]  he said there was going to be economic disaster inside of britain he also said you're going to
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:36.760]  see interest rates go up i mean he's had this project of fear and if you look at the way the
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:41.320]  media is reporting this paul it's not just a wall street journal saying that it is silenced and
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:47.080]  again hasn't silenced both sides the other side is talking about hate they're talking about their
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:53.160]  grief and so forth and so on but i think what's interesting paul is a report from cnn now it
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:57.480]  hasn't been talked about this guy is a mental patient has it been talked about uh much over
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:03.640]  there in the uk now it it's it's actively being covered up i mean there are you know brightbox
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:08.360]  reported on it and so forth but as you said they've not suspended their campaign they've
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:16.200]  become even more vociferous despite the fact that this guy was a mental patient he had mental
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:21.000]  problems he was on psychotropic drugs they interviewed his friends they interviewed his
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.040]  neighbors they interviewed his family members listen to these quotes from his brother quote we
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.840]  are struggling to believe what has happened my brother is not a violent man and is not that
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:37.000]  political we don't even know who he votes for i'm visibly shaken by this news here's another one
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  from his half brother who is um who is half black i believe he's never expressed any views about
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.640]  britain or politics or racist tendencies and yet they're claiming based on one eyewitness who is
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:54.760]  a guy who is in the bnp which is basically a fascist party who you know he's got the motivation
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:17:00.040]  to make this claim for his own integer claimed that as this killer was stabbing was shooting the
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:05.880]  labor mp that he was shouting britain first they went back and interviewed the other eyewitnesses
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:10.600]  who said he said no such thing and in fact this the shopkeeper who's right across from where the
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:16.440]  murder happened put a huge note up in his window and this is on my twitter profile saying that he
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:23.480]  did not say britain first it was not a political murder this was a mentally unstable guy you know
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:30.600]  hopped up on psychotropic drugs yeah what have we seen in the aftermath complete salacious shameful
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:36.600]  exploitation by the politicians by the media before this woman this mother of two was even
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:43.640]  dead you had newspaper headlines saying brexit killer i mean this is completely shameful we expect
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:49.240]  nothing less from the mainstream media but this is so transparent how they're hijacking it they
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:54.360]  haven't suspended their campaign they become even more vociferous you talk about how transparent
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.560]  you talk about how transparent is we've got the southern poverty law center the usual suspects
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:04.440]  who are now coming in and talking about how this guy was a racist i mean that raises all
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:09.400]  kinds of red flags when you combine that with what you just talked about in terms of interviewing
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:16.840]  people there neighbors here's another quote this is from cnn even and cnn puts out the narrative
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:22.600]  that he's a lone killer that there's a racist connection with it southern poverty law center
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:28.040]  said they've got documents showing that he has a history of purchasing hate literature from the
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:34.440]  united states i mean these are the people who are always there to create this narrative of right
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:38.520]  wing extremism the southern poverty law center but listen to what the neighbors who knew him said
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:43.560]  this is diana peters a 65 year old neighbor said there was nothing to indicate this could happen
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:48.280]  exactly what you were just saying paul she says it's a total surprise he was even capable of thought
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.360]  let alone action okay so another long time neighbor another one says uh yeah he was just the ideal
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:19:00.200]  neighbor helpful when you wanted it kept to himself uh she said that he taught english to foreigners
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:05.240]  you mentioned he had a half black brother paul uh he taught english to foreigners politics neighbor
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:09.560]  never came up in a conversation we never talked about anything like that said his neighbor she
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:14.280]  said she never saw anyone visiting his home uh she said she believed that he visited his mother
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:19.880]  every sunday took her groceries once a week uh described him as very meek and mild he spoke
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:24.680]  rationally he did his day-to-day routines but i thought it was interesting one of the things
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:30.520]  that came out was a six-year-old interview where that was published in the paper they were talking
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:35.960]  to patients uh from the mental institute who had been given day jobs and they were finding them
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:40.760]  day jobs doing gardening work and we'll tell you what that says when we come back we've got to go to

[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:28.840]  us for the special report in the next when we come back after break and next segment
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.800]  of course nato and this is what alex is going to be talking about nato just came out and said
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:40.360]  that if there was a cyber hack against one of its countries that would be grounds to start a physical
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:47.960]  war now we're not trying to push war are we or just these peace loving people uh this is a very
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:52.360]  very dangerous hair trigger that they have set up and alex is going to be talking about that in
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:57.320]  the next section paul one of the other news articles i saw coming out of the uk that's
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.560]  about the brexit vote of course the brexit vote is going to be a week from yesterday
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:09.320]  everything has been silenced now in the wake of this murder of this member of parliament who supported
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:15.160]  remain but there was this article i saw in breitbart london's muslim mayor is having
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:20.840]  remain rallies and he's doing it with the job clad women who are standing in the background
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:26.120]  uh so it's kind of i guess you could say that he's uh backing remain but he's having the
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:32.120]  hijab women remain in the back paul well i mean it's it's like we saw with the video clip i played
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:37.320]  earlier that's the fundamental belief of islam segregation so you've got all the men at the
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:41.720]  front you've got all the women relegated to the back and you know he's from tooting which is one
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:47.160]  of these islamic ghettos basically you can walk down the street you know it's a halal butcher
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:52.520]  an islamic bookstore a mosque this is one of the areas that has been completely taken over
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:59.400]  it's not about diversity as i said this is a mono culture they don't embrace diversity yet we're
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:05.240]  supposed to embrace diversity another thing with the brexit um of course you had numerous people
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:11.480]  christine legard of the imf you had alan juppe this left wing french presidential candidate
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:18.360]  you had an eu commissioner all come out within hours of the murder of joe cot and say that for
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:23.960]  example with the eu commissioner demetris abromber pulos quote she was murdered for her dedication
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:29.640]  to european democracy and humanity alan juppe said she was quote shamefully murdered because of her
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:37.160]  beliefs this guy was a mentally ill person on drugs with no political history yeah the closest
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:41.720]  people to him said he wasn't political at all the eyewitness has said that the claims he said
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:48.120]  britain first were completely wrong the one person they've got who said that is a bnp member
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:54.360]  yet they're running with it they exploited this within minutes which shows you exactly i mean
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.480]  their entire campaign is not based on having a fair debate this should be about immigration jobs the
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:04.680]  economy sovereignty that's right their campaign is so discredited it's so crumbling that they've
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:11.000]  had to basically dance on the grave of this poor dead woman to try and reinvigorate their campaign
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.800]  and this is the same crowd that says you know after every islamist terror attack not all muslims
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:21.000]  don't blame all muslims yet in the immediate aftermath of this they blamed all vote leave
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.800]  supporters absolutely shameful and it's still going on oh yeah just like in the united states they
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:29.960]  say don't blame muslims and yet they blame all gun owners uh for what's happening they're the
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:34.120]  we're the ones who need to have our guns taken away and as the wall street journalist saying and of
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:38.840]  course the wall street journal and all the financial community and the bankers who want this globalism
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.640]  uh they want uh britain to stay in the european union they're saying well this silence is both
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:48.600]  sides as you point out it hasn't silenced the people who want britain to remain they've been
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:54.760]  using this vociferously and continuously but the people who have been silenced are the people who
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:59.000]  were there saying that we need to leave we need to be independent they are the ones who are being
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.480]  silenced and they're going to be silenced because for this entire next weekend as well as going
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:08.520]  through the memorial service next monday everything leading up to it all the narrative is going to be
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:13.400]  about how people who want to leave are nothing but hateful racist and that's why we've got the southern
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:19.560]  poverty law center jumping in with a bunch of bogus doubtful information with us yeah and now
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:24.280]  you've got angela merkel coming out she's not being silent she's come out and said that it you
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:29.240]  know it characterizes the radical atmosphere of the rhetoric that surrounds this whole conversation
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:35.400]  about europe well this is the same woman whose policy brought in one million plus muslim migrants
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:44.040]  into germany a lot of them who are syrian poll show 21 percent of syrians support isis so she's
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:50.360]  literally bringing in hundreds of thousands of people who are radicalized who support isis
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:55.720]  who want the death penalty for gay people who want sharia law and yet she's blaming people who
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:00.680]  will simply want to reclaim some essence of sovereignty and freedom back for themselves
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:06.600]  for their parliamentary democracy she's saying that they're the radicals again absolutely absurd
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:10.600]  that this statement would come from her they're dancing on the grave they're exploiting this
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:18.440]  and it's shameful you know we had former mayor of london borce johnson who favors britain becoming
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:24.360]  a sovereign nation again and he gave eight reasons why britain would be better off with an exit and
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:30.120]  as you're talking about this paul the people as part of the leave campaign came up with very
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:34.680]  concrete proposals talking about how much money was going to be put back into the national health
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:39.560]  system and so forth and so on showing the economic benefits and that has all been shut down and
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:45.720]  what's the usual tactic from the usual suspects racism thank you so much paul joseph watson we're
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:50.680]  going to be joined by alex jones and the next segment he's going to talk about cyber war the
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:30:01.800]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network good news in the battle for the republic
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:08.440]  this morning as it looks like the democrats do process violating gun bill is doomed despite
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:14.680]  support by brock hussein obama and the justice department the legislation would permit the

[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:47.080]  if anyone inside russia or a russian protectorate hacks an individual a corporation or a governmental
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:54.920]  institution that is quote protected by the umbrella of nato a lot of things come to mind when i
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:34:02.440]  read that an official statement from nato as a new defense policy their new stance their new
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:08.440]  rules of engagement nato for five years has been funding the arab spring al qaeda isis

[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:27.560]  name it nato has been involved in toppling nations like libya and of course trying to
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:33.960]  topple syria and successfully for a few years toppling egypt to put in the muslim brotherhood
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:40.920]  and other wahhabist grips that they have the nerve to tell russia that has three foreign
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:46.840]  military bases that it is trying to start a world war they use these terms and we see the head of
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:52.360]  nato and others saying we need to see russian body bags to counter this i'm not a russophile i've

[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:11.640]  dalis most of my family's been in the u.s military i i mean i it's just that russia isn't starting
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:18.520]  the wars and this is a fact that our government run by george soros overthrew ukraine three years
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:24.840]  ago put fascist in overthrew an elected government and then our media said russia had done it this
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:31.720]  is getting crazier and crazier so i'm gonna go over a few of these articles just to illustrate how
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:38.200]  out of control the globalist are and how they're the ones in danger in humanity i tend to do this

[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:21.240]  played here on the air but david night and paul joseph watson uh hosting but as we continue mexican
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:29.320]  flags fly at trump protest in dallas again trump points out that this judge ruling against him
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:34.840]  is a member of lorazas involved in a group suing him and boycotting him he should recruse himself
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:43.160]  but here we have the american mirror reporting on the mexican flags that are flying there i mean
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:49.560]  if if mexico's so wonderful why don't you go there but i get it under larika enquista texas
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:56.040]  under the guadalupe held algo treaty you know previous to that it's all been stolen six days later
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:04.440]  here berlin frets about e u influence if uk leaves it transfer trump facebook page suspended
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:11.320]  more censorship border battle the members of the unofficial patrol senator sessions is probably
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:20.440]  going to be the vp of trump uh says that the members of the unofficial patrol are basically
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:27.400]  patriots and senator session says dictator obama flooding rural towns with illegals yes outside
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:33.320]  of law having them complete the smuggling process but don't worry federal government
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:39.240]  approves higher fence for the white house and california's new voter voter law would have
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:45.240]  two million registered voters in the first year okay that's just some of the news i want to cover
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:52.200]  we'll get to more of that in just a moment but mexico has a wall mexico has a fence uh six months
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:56.600]  to your hard labor they torture the people they catch coming in illegal i'm not saying that's a
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:00.840]  good thing that's a bad thing but we just can't offer free stuff for the world and then call
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:05.640]  donald trump racist if he's against it i mean that's just common sense but continuing here's
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:10.200]  another example i told people back on sunday and monday that i bet it that the guy that went in
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:17.240]  uh and you know this crazy taliban ices lover shooter whose dad goes on the internet and
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:22.760]  sells killed gays and his his minister his emom goes on there and says that now we learn that
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:30.040]  the taliban is using honey trap boys to kill afghan police because pedophilia and homosexuality
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:38.440]  is so incredibly over the top that that's how they go lure afghan police for al qaeda and the
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:43.640]  taliban and the pashtuns to kill them because when i first started reporting on this which is well
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:50.360]  known it's like saying you go to a turkish jail you get raped that homosexuality is most common in
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:55.320]  muslim countries and you say well why do they kill them in saudi arabia throw them off buildings
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:40:03.000]  when they find them uh in in syria or or or egypt or libyum it's because you're not supposed to
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:09.960]  admit you're doing it and between men it's dominating another man or a boy it's dominating
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:16.200]  it's not supposed to be love if you love them it's then evil so a truly sick system i mean
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:22.360]  if adults want to do something that's their issue that's why i'm attacking called homophobic
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:25.960]  because i don't want to kill anybody okay fine or it's homophobic because i don't want to have
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:32.760]  money you know my family put hoods over their heads but in islam it's okay to kill people
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:37.640]  if they're homosexual and man the leftists just love it we actually have clips of this we played
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:42.360]  yesterday with jacari jackson in atlanta a few days ago and they got a guy with a gay pride you
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:49.000]  know rainbow flag bitching out some black teenager who's a trump supporter saying you know how dare
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  you trump wants to send blacks back to africa and he's on the clan all this made up stuff
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.040]  while he's wearing a rainbow flag when trumps after defending the rights of all americans not to be
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:03.480]  killed it's it's it's just all fantasy land it's a bunch of domesticated weak stupid people
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.560]  who are on this big collectivist bit believing government really cares about them and special
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:14.920]  interest really want to give them something free as you get poor as you get dumber as your worthless
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:19.320]  college degrees you know get your job back in groceries you just can't admit you've been con
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:25.240]  and i remember a few cousins and and business partners and people i mean probably up to five
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:31.800]  or six people i know who went from getting angry at me to never talking to me again because over
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:36.280]  15 16 years ago i said before everybody knew this it was it was well known but not totally none

[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:06.200]  the two million then you're gonna actually get a call from prince of boo boo and then the call never
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:13.720]  comes and these people would look at me and say you're jealous that prince of boo boo shows it's

[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:24.120]  chemicals where you can't have children then you got to go to the government and systems
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:28.280]  to have your child from three or four different parents which they admit is the plan and then
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:33.800]  they can build trojan horses uh of social control uh into that but let's look at some of the
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:39.800]  headlines from info wars dot com this is on thursday night they'll be more live today obviously

[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:24.040]  she has americans did it kind of like what some moroccan guy stabs to in france they go the
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:31.400]  frenchman killed that ain't no frenchman that's a north african so let's keep going right here
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:35.080]  pretty soon they'll say that we're never any frenchman all there are in north africans
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:40.120]  so this is just some of the articles that deal with all of this police restrict reporters

[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:03.960]  anti-trump uh trumpers become aggressive when you send that to drudgereport.com shocking police

[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:19.480]  got paul watson's site breaking all of this down uh as well so i'm basically going to end this
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:24.280]  transmission for now there was another article on drudgereport from a daily mail where they've
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:30.520]  got transhumanist meeting with the pentagon about putting microchips and all the sailors and troops
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:35.080]  you would say oh that's fine well nowhere they're at it brings total control a casual society is
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:40.520]  the technocracies dream you think bank of america coming out saying they're going to tax you you know
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:45.080]  it's every time you do a money transfer use your debit cards bad once they've gotten rid of cash
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:50.600]  the sky's the limit and that's what bilderberg and the globalists are pushing they have decided
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:56.920]  the easy path don't care about humanity screw everybody over do whatever you want be cynical be
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:00.920]  evil and then they say you're all dumb and weak and you deserve it you're never going to stand up
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:05.640]  or care my question is is that really true and the answer is it isn't even if they've turned
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:12.680]  maybe 60 of people into zombies and i mean zombies it doesn't matter they still are beings that have
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:16.840]  due process rights and then what about the rest of us that are awake and know what's going on

[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:30.440]  we have goodwill for each other of your race color creed we're going to the stars and we are the
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:37.000]  resistors the globals to humanizers okay and that was alex jones and of course he was mentioning
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.960]  in the very beginning of that broadcast how nato is saying that if they're just hacked with a cyber
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:47.800]  attack that could be the basis for a war isn't that amazing i think think about that think about
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:54.760]  how many cyber attacks we've had and how it's ultimately been traced back to our own government
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:49:01.480]  as a false flag how could you do an easier false flag in order to start a war than to say we're
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:05.640]  going to do it with a cyber hack that's something that ought to concern all of us and of course at
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:10.680]  the same time they're saying if you come in and you uh hack our systems that that's an act of war
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:15.720]  and yet throughout social media many of these outlets that were created by funding from our
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:22.040]  government like facebook and google we see rampant censorship and control of information
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:27.560]  as paul mentioned earlier reddit will adjust an algorithm to censor trump supporters following
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:33.720]  the orlando shooting uh they're doing this in order to promote diversity of course and according
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:40.280]  to the daily beast this is happening because they had 11712 subscribed to the trump supporting
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:46.200]  subreddit on sunday alone making it the most successful day in the community's relatively
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:51.080]  short history okay so how do you what do you do if you're reddit you don't want those eyeballs on
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:55.320]  your site you don't want people signing up and using it do you no no no if you have something
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:50:01.880]  really successful you shut it down because the politics is more important to them than what they
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:06.200]  say they're doing there now look at what facebook is doing we've got facebook and this is a story
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:11.160]  from info wars dot com suspending outspoken florida gun shops after the orlando attack
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:16.760]  they said oh you want to blame guns you want to blame gun shops well uh they spoke up and they said
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:22.520]  no i think the problem is islam as i've said many times the lesson to learn if you want to make
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:29.320]  people safer this is not about gun control we need to insist and change this narrative to
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:33.880]  make it about controlling the borders what difference does it make if we're going to have
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:39.960]  background checks if we are if we for gun owners if we don't have background checks at the borders
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:45.080]  they want to talk about watch lists what is a watch list it's nothing but a glorified
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:50.600]  background check if they did it right but there's a far more things that that we need to be concerned
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:56.440]  about the watch list it is far more dangerous than guns in the hands of a government we're going to
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:51:01.880]  tell you why when we come back also a follow-up on what's going on in the uk construction license

[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:27.320]  all right welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this friday june 17th 2016
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:32.200]  we have a lot we want to talk about we're going to cover most of these stories
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:37.960]  coming up in the longer segments i want to talk about the watch list who's watching the government
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:45.400]  you know that's the old saying the old philosophical saying who watches the watchers these are secret
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:52.680]  processes and what we see coming out being revived is nothing new it was put to us last august by
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:55:00.760]  diane feinstein rhino neocon extraordinaire peter king and of course this is nothing new
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:05.240]  and throughout history we've always had the government with its secret courts with its
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:11.720]  star chamber processes accusing people in secret this is the hallmark of totalitarianism
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:17.560]  this is what was written what kafka wrote about in his novels okay what we're looking at with these
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:23.240]  watch lists is the most possible thing dangerous thing that could happen to us you need to be
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:29.560]  concerned about that far more than firearms and i want to talk about you know we've heard that
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:34.440]  that the orlando shooting was the deadliest mass shooting in the united states history
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:44.600]  no actually it wasn't okay it wasn't think about uh think about wounded knee okay how many people
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:51.960]  died in wounded knee well that happened in 1890 you had the u.s cavalry attack a village of indians
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:57.640]  men women and children in a genocidal manner shooting and killing everybody that was there
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:06.280]  150 Lakota in a single incident okay so they could get their land right we've had more recently
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:12.440]  we've had the weiko shooting we had 82 members so the branch divisions were murdered by our
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:17.800]  government i believe deliberately after a long siege they decided they were fed up with it burned
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:23.720]  them out just like the nazis burned out the jews who were resisting them in the war saguetto
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:29.640]  both events occurred on april the 19th maybe that's just a coincidence maybe not maybe that
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:35.480]  was a message that was sent so that was 82 at weiko 150 at wounded knee and of course there's
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:40.840]  been other atrocities that hate crimes that were done in the past we had this is an article from
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:46.120]  mitt press they talk about how you know 49 people killed in orlando but there's been incidents where
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:55.160]  where african-americans were targeted okay uh 1917 at least a hundred uh were killed in east
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:57:00.840]  st lewis in one night another incident anywhere from 55 to 300 blacks were massacred in tulsa
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:08.680]  oklahoma in just 16 hours in june of 1921 because see they didn't have guns there was jim crow
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:13.560]  laws that kept guns away from black people the indians didn't have guns to defend themselves
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:19.080]  when the cavalry attacked them and of course they used the pretense of guns to come after those
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:27.560]  at uh weiko even though it was simply over a license for firearms that's what the siege began with
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:33.480]  but they did this full blown attack called up the media said hey hey y'all come watch this
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:40.920]  we're going to show you how our SWAT team operates and of course they'd had many incidents where they
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:45.480]  had served them with warrants peacefully the local sheriff but no the batf wanted to come in and do
[01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:51.240]  it uh the keyword was showtime that's when we're going to kick off the raid showtime we're going
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:58.200]  to show everybody how powerful we are and they were paranoid and they shot back and kill some
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:02.840]  agents that began the siege and then they just burned the place down so you know we talk about
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:06.360]  this and we talk about the government murdering people and it's not even the number of people
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:11.720]  that they murdered because immediately preceding weiko course we had ruby ridge where an fbi
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:20.440]  hostage team sniper shot a woman who was holding a baby in her arms and what for a sniper was point
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:25.400]  blank range it was a very close range shot her right in the forehead she's slumped to the ground on
[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:31.560]  her knees still holding the baby dead okay so you want to talk about atrocities you want to talk
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:36.360]  about which you should really be afraid of it's democide it's our government killing people that's
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:40.840]  why we have the second amendment it's to keep them from doing it we'll be right back thank you for

[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:43.320]  manufacturing jobs are quietly receiving the bulk of obama's invading islamic jihad army stretching
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:49.560]  unsuspecting local city budgets to the breaking point bold statement yesterday on the alex jones
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:56.040]  show retired dhs officer and whistleblower philip heinie explained why radical islamic terrorists
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:01:02.120]  are falling through the cracks despite unprecedented government data gathering when you encounter
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:08.760]  people coming back from flights from overseas or when you're preparing to depart to go outbound we
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:14.600]  call it to go overseas we have the authority within the border a greater amount of authority than the
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:21.640]  cia and the fbi combined to gather this kind of basic intelligence information and over the years
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:27.400]  we have been handcuffed more and more to the point where we're barely capable of gathering the kind
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:33.640]  of information that we could then share let's say with the fbi some targeted american cities are
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:40.680]  already being pushed over the edge for example amarillo texas known as the yellow rose of texas
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:46.520]  one of the largest meat packing cities in the united states home to the v 22 osprey hybrid
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:53.560]  aircraft assembly plant food giant cargill and also home to pan tex the only nuclear weapons
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:59.080]  assembly and disassembly plant in the united states has taken in well over a thousand middle
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:04.840]  eastern refugees already the highest in the nation but when you add refugees sent to amarillo from
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:11.080]  countries outside the middle east the numbers skyrocket world net daily reports amarillo has

[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:24.600]  that's more than half of the nearly 8 000 refugees sent to texas during the same period
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:29.640]  president obama has increased that number of foreign refugees bound for american soil and
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:39.160]  fiscal 2016 to 85 000 that's a 20 increase over the previous year and 10 000 will be coming from
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:45.400]  the jihadist hotbed of syria many of the community organizers have received training or consultation
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:51.640]  from david lubel's welcoming america organization which was started with seed money from billionaire
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:58.920]  george soros breitbart reported in january of 2016 amarillo mayor paul harpal said we've been a
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:04.040]  giving community and it's a huge disservice to bring in refugees and numbers that we're not
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:11.880]  able to handle we create small ghettos the amarillo texas mayor continues a group of somalis came in
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:16.440]  to say that they had elected a mayor of their community then another faction claimed they had
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:22.600]  their own leader we come to find out that rival tribes slaves and masters were being settled
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:30.440]  together amarillo 9 11 calls are now being fielded in 42 different languages harpal told watchdog.org
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:36.440]  that washington pays schools only a hundred dollars per refugee student per year he continues
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:42.760]  we have 660 refugee kids who don't speak english and the us department of education says they have
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:48.600]  to be at grade level within one year it's a ludicrous requirement they don't even know how to use
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:53.160]  the bathroom and while governor abbott and the texas health and human services commission
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:58.680]  continue to push lawsuits against resettlement organizations and the federal government for
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:05.800]  not presenting regular consent as required by federal law crime levels in amarillo are reaching
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:14.280]  levels on par with much larger cities amarillo also has the highest rate of reported rape in texas
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:22.120]  the rape epidemic in this world is becoming pandemic it's not confined to one location
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:28.200]  even the muslim convert cia director john brennan has declared that terrorists are using the
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:34.760]  refugee system to infest the united states meanwhile amarillo immigrant mohammed maghadam
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:40.600]  who came to amarillo eight years ago recently held his manager and another person hostage at gunpoint
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:45.560]  because he was passed over okay and that's john boucher for his job at the alex jones channel

[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:15.320]  brock hussein obama and the justice department the legislation would permit the federal government
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:21.560]  to deny individuals on a secret terrorist watch list the right to exercise the second
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:28.440]  amendment yesterday democrat senator joe manchin went on the morning joe show and said due process
[02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:34.280]  is a firewall problem we have and really the firewall that we have right now there's due process
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:38.760]  here it's all due process so we can all say yeah we want the same thing but how do we get there

[02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:50.920]  all in violation of due process there is basically no standard of evidence for being placed on a

[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:21.720]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this friday june 17th 2016
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:27.160]  i'll be your host for the rest of the show i want to go back and revisit something we were talking
[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:32.040]  about and go into it a little bit more detail we were talking about this with uh paul joseph watson
[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:37.880]  this shooting that happened in the uk and it was a tragedy i mean this is a lady who is a
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:43.880]  beloved wife and mother of two small children who is now dead but i think there's something else to
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:48.600]  this you know just because people are dying at these events just like the aurora colorado shooting
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:54.440]  a lot of people died there there was a tragedy there but we need to look at who these people are
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:09:01.160]  and what really happened here i mean wouldn't you want to know if your loved ones were killed
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:08.440]  for political purposes like a rice dog fire a false flag purpose to forward a political agenda if
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:13.480]  they were killed by cold-blooded murder rather than just a madman who was able to get his hands on
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:18.200]  guns so easily and we got to ban guns no no actually you know when that aurora colorado
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:24.440]  shooting happened i remember it very well because i was covering i was in new york
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:30.040]  to going to new york to cover the un arms trade treaty and it was exactly one week
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:35.080]  before the un was going to vote on that arms trade treaty i thought they had a pretty good
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:40.520]  shot at it and i went there to do some filming for a gun group the national association gun rights
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:47.560]  and prior to that of course there had been the the false flag and it's admitted even mainstream
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:51.880]  media admits that the fast and furious operation was a false flag by the american government to try
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:56.920]  to take away the second amendment to put restrictions on it and of course that was precisely what the
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:02.600]  un arms trade treaty was about restricting the flow of arms across borders and of course if
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:09.160]  you're going to do that that means that you've got to track and follow and record every firearm
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:15.160]  cell within america to make sure that nothing is coming or going that isn't allowed okay so it is a
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:21.560]  prescription just to say well we don't want small arms and big arms going across the borders so in
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:27.960]  order to do that the mechanism for that is going to be total uh information awareness if you will
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:34.840]  for guns and that was what that was about and so fast and furious was designed as a mean to say you
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:39.080]  know here's a problem and we've got the solution right here the un has come up with this and we've
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:42.840]  been talking about this for several years so now it's time to vote on it what about all blew up in
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:48.760]  their face when the federal agent was killed it was exposed as a false flag they no longer
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:54.120]  looked like they were going to be able to get this through so then bingo one week before they're
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:11:00.520]  going to meet and vote on this what happens we have the aurora colorado shooting and nobody ever
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:07.480]  asks when you look at this guy james holmes this is a guy who when he graduated from high school
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:13.800]  he had a 3.949 average out of four nearly a perfect average this is the top one percent
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:20.120]  of his class okay he had highest honors he was given a national institute of health scholarship
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:27.480]  just before all the shooting happened how did this guy go from being so incredibly smart and
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:35.640]  intelligent how did he go from that to being this kind of catatonic uh jim ignitowski you know
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:41.080]  i mean look at this guy he's like you know his eyes are wide open he's wearing an orange wig
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:46.760]  he's is literally wigged out okay how did he get to that state what what flipped him do you
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:53.240]  ever see anybody in the mainstream media asking that question what transformed james holmes how
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:59.160]  did that happen so quickly how did he go from being a psychology major to some kind of a ninja
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:05.640]  preparer okay and memories i know there's there's all kinds of bombs in my apartment and they go
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:09.880]  back and the whole place is booby trapped there's all kinds of weapons there and so forth and so on
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:15.560]  and uh where did he get the money for this where did he get the expertise for this none of it made
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:21.880]  any sense but the timing was perfect it was one week before the un arms trade treaty we needed
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:27.720]  to scare the american public about firearms but it backfired instead people went out and
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:34.760]  bought a lot more guns but we still have people even the fellow who um uh engaged us down in san
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:40.920]  atonium and we had the argument with alex jones uh they were parents of one of the people who was
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:48.520]  killed in that movie theater and instead of them asking the question who or what changed james holmes
[02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:54.840]  instead of asking why did this happen why is this timing so suspicious instead it's like
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:59.000]  we need to stop guns we need to make guns go away and understand that but you know what they're not
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:04.600]  going to go away drugs haven't gone away in 45 years the drug war do you think the draconian
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:09.160]  measures that we've had on the drug war have made any change come on people on the left you know
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:13.880]  that hasn't worked why do you think that taking away guns is going to work and i gotta say the
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:20.440]  people on the right uh why do you persist in the war on drugs it's destroying our countries destroyed
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:24.600]  our due process and now the war on terror is taking it the rest of the way and we're going to talk about
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:29.400]  those terror watch lists and what you should really be afraid of when we come back but
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:35.640]  i want to now go to this situation in the uk and of course this is a very very important
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:39.720]  issue many of you may think this is something that only affects people in england okay the
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:48.440]  uk the brexit vote is not just a local issue as paul joseph was saying this is reflecting
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:56.200]  a mass movement a mass grassroots movement against globalism that is destroying our way of life
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:02.440]  destroying our countries taking away our freedoms taking away our sovereignty removing our control
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:10.040]  over government to a much more distant location whenever you lose your freedoms and this is
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:13.560]  you know people say hey you know how can you support donald trump because he's on so many
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:18.520]  different civil liberties issues it's like i understand we can still fight for some of these
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:23.240]  civil liberty issues at the local and state level we have legal mechanisms i understand
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:31.080]  that the bill of rights and constitution are really a dead letter but they still swear to it
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:37.320]  they still take an oath to it they still pretend that it's what gives them their authority and as
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:44.040]  long as they do that we've got an end and it's also if we understand what that document is about
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:51.640]  it is the best plan we've come up yet in any civilization to protect individual liberty
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:56.120]  but the further we move our power away from the individual when it goes from the individual to
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:59.960]  the community the local community from the local community to the state level from the state level
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:04.600]  to the national level from the national level to the global level the farther it gets away from us
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:11.400]  the more difficult it will be to ever recover that and so right now we're about to see
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:18.280]  our individual liberties be removed even further away from us going from the national to the
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:23.800]  international level we're moving to the next step of globalism that's why it's important
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:28.040]  in britain they're fighting for their sovereignty trying to get it back they've already lost it
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:31.640]  they come in and they say well look at all the money that we're sending to brussels to the european
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:37.160]  union what could we do with that in our own country you know they've got a national health system they
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:41.320]  say well we could spend more money on that we could help the poor in our own country look at
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:46.840]  how much we could do with that if we didn't have to send it to the european union they're writing
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:50.360]  our laws and regulations for us they're writing the trade agreements for us we don't have any
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:55.800]  say so over how our economy is managed that's why it's important they're understanding that
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:59.240]  there are other countries in europe that are understanding that americans are understanding
[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:04.600]  that that's what's behind donald trump and of course the people of bill deberg and these are
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:11.000]  people in north america and europe who work together to design the euro as well as european union
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:16.120]  they are the ones who are creating this globalism who are trying to move it to the next step
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:25.320]  have a transatlantic union economic first then political just as the european union was economic
[02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:30.920]  first and then political and becoming more and more political as it goes along so it is very
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:36.120]  important for them to start to unravel this plan at the bottom level and they were winning
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:41.720]  they were having a massive surge and it was a trend that had been going on for a long time
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:46.600]  the supporters of the european union were losing miserably in debates
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:51.560]  cameron was failing left and right nobody was buying it they could see what was happening and
[02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:54.520]  and at bill deberg they're very concerned about they're talking about the precariat they say we
[02:16:54.520 --> 02:17:00.920]  have this precarious proletariat because they break everybody into classes and put them against
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:07.000]  each other and it's not you know the wall street is not against marxism it was the bankers who sent
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:12.920]  lenin to start the russian revolution german bankers gave him 10 million dollars put him on a train
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:20.040]  to start the russian revolution this is a known fact it is a tool of social control and so they
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:25.560]  look at this they say well the proletariat is now getting pretty dangerous these people are going to
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:30.120]  pick up pitchforks and and torches pretty soon they're going to come after us what do we do to
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:34.600]  placate them they're very concerned about that and they're concerned that britain was going to
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:39.320]  leave and that was going to start unraveling the whole game and so then we have this killing
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:46.840]  just like the aurora colorado shooting one week before the vote but they may win with this one
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:53.160]  because people aren't going to go out they they're not really seeing what is behind this this is to
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:58.200]  see an end story they say to neighbors tommy mayor is a quiet man who tended gardens in the small
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:03.560]  town of burstall in northern england but details are slowly starting to emerge where those details
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:08.760]  coming from not from his neighbors not from anybody who knew him not from family members not from
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:16.760]  people in england but guess where the southern poverty law center in america i smell a rat i
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:21.880]  smell a big rat every time the southern poverty law center gets in here starts screaming about right
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:28.200]  wing white supremacists okay you can bet there's there's stoking this with a bunch of lies details
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:33.480]  are slowly starting to emerge about a man who had interests in white supremacy and apartheid he bought
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:37.880]  material that says the southern poverty law center from a white supremacist group in the united states
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:44.120]  that is not the picture that emerges from the people who knew him as i mentioned before 65
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:49.880]  year old neighbor said well it's a total surprise he'd be capable of thought let alone actions she
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:56.840]  said of a longtime neighbor who said he never raised his voice he taught english he volunteered to
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:02.360]  teach english to foreigners he had a black half brother doesn't sound like a white supremacist to
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:08.280]  me they all said he had no political beliefs whatsoever as far as they knew they said he's
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:14.040]  very meek and mild he spoke rationally he just did his day to day routines they said and here's the
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:21.160]  key he was an immaculate gardener he often tended to neighbors gardens as well other neighbors gave
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:26.120]  similar accounts saying he was a quiet tidy often helped with their gardening six years ago he gave
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:30.040]  an interview because they were talking about a program where they were helping people who had
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:35.800]  been at a day center for adults with mental health problems they got them jobs in the park and he said
[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:42.120]  volunteer work has done me more good than all the psychotherapy and medication in the world
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:47.960]  many people who suffer from mental illness and socially isolated disconnected from society

[02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:18.120]  with what we were talking about this shooting in england this man who seems to be this docile
[02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:25.240]  not all their mental patient who just said he loved to work in gardens they were saying
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:31.000]  west yorkshire police said they'd seized a number of weapons including a firearm shortly after the
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:36.440]  attack from his apartment here we've got southern poverty law center telling us that he was getting
[02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:42.920]  white supremacist hate literature from the united states and yet the neighbors are painting a picture
[02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:50.520]  of a guy who was completely harmless a man who was a part-time volunteer to teach english to
[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:56.760]  foreigners a man who had a half brother who says by the way he'd never seen any sign that
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:25:02.360]  mayor had any kind of interest in guns or knives his neighbors said he had no interest in politics
[02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:08.840]  and then when they asked his brother if he was racist his uh half black half brother says uh no
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:15.480]  chance he says he's never been in trouble he wouldn't hurt a fly and again remember six years
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:23.000]  ago he was saying i just love to work in gardens they are just they do me more good than all the
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:30.680]  psychotherapy and medication in the world this is the portrait of a patsy who got a hold of this guy
[02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:37.240]  who put all these knives and guns in his apartment that nobody else had seen who is creating this
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:43.640]  narrative that he is a dangerous white supremacist racist highly charged political person who did
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:48.040]  this for completely political reasons that's the way it's being spun that's the way this tragedy
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:54.040]  is being spun i mean who wound this guy up when i saw this they're talking about how he kept an
[02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:58.360]  immaculate garden and he often tended to other neighbors gardens as well do you remember the
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:05.880]  movie back in 1979 being there peter cellars surely reclaimed chance the gardener you know they go to
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:11.240]  this house he was kind of a gardener and butler for a very wealthy man who died and he just kept
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:17.240]  doing it he was this clueless guy you know kind of living like james holmes is now the or colorado
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:22.440]  shooter and um but he's not doing the gardening dressed as a butler and they come up and they
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:27.080]  talked to him they didn't really know that he was the gardener and he says i'm chance the gardener
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:34.120]  they go chance the gardener oh okay that's all these people who are the the most powerful politicians
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:39.000]  and businessmen they're coming here to see him and they ask him these questions and he is absolutely
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:45.480]  totally clueless about what they're talking about and he answers with these non sequiturs
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:52.280]  and at first they're kind of taken back and they think wow and they read into what he has to say
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:57.400]  these these non responses to what they're saying they read all kinds of deep philosophical meaning
[02:26:57.400 --> 02:27:01.400]  and let's play a little bit of clip about that and and they think he's this guru let's play a little
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:12.440]  clip from that trailer i'm chance the gardener the gardener yes since i was a child i worked in
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:21.720]  this garden then you really are a gardener oh yes may i ask your name but they don't really
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:29.400]  believe he's a gardener they imply all of these motives to him and he's this mr chancey guy totally
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:37.000]  disconnected guy like the shooter in the uk no i'm not related to basil and peddita gobbledygook
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.720]  and there's a black lady who worked with him at the house and when they put him on television as
[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:49.000]  this guru she's saying he's an idiot he doesn't know anything it portray him as something that's
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:55.960]  got no brains at all with rice pudding between the ears on television mr president you look much
[02:27:55.960 --> 02:28:05.160]  smaller dumb as a jackass that's the way that's like that and it goes on and on like this he gets
[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:10.360]  to the president he goes on television he runs a close advisor all these captains of industry
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:16.520]  and political figures and they're just continued to read into this man what they want to read into
[02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:23.000]  him now they're not doing that in a way with this guy but this guy is just this passive
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:29.880]  individual that has been a tool a patsy of the elite he's not fooling the elite the elite are
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:37.640]  using him to fool you they're using him to forward their agenda that's what i truly believe a very
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:43.000]  very funny movie and i'm not making light of the tragedy yes this lady was brutally murdered
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:51.400]  you don't know what turned chance the gardener into the joker i mean you know this people
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:56.200]  should be asking that question just as they should be asking the question what turned
[02:28:56.200 --> 02:29:03.080]  james holmes into this vegetable with a joker wig you know what waked him out what what changed
[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:09.960]  this guy who was one of the brightest researchers in the country what changed him into this catatonic
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:15.160]  joker where did he get all this equipment to do this nobody's asking about that transformation
[02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:21.560]  nobody is asking about this transformation of this guy tommy mayor who i will now call chance
[02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:28.760]  the gardener nobody's asking about that nobody thinks it's suspicious that it happened exactly
[02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:35.080]  one week before the vote and of course nothing will be talked about except the not only the tragic
[02:29:35.080 --> 02:29:40.680]  side of the loss with this but portraying it as racism southern part of the law center
[02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:45.240]  always there stay with us we'll be right back we're gonna talk about terror watch list what's

[02:33:35.240 --> 02:33:40.040]  to be an infringement of our fundamental rights another effort to change them into privileges
[02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:47.560]  but we are going into these different devices we are taking away all due process and we're
[02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:53.960]  moving rapidly towards tools and devices and mechanisms on the part of the government that

[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:10.280]  reelection to the senate interesting he's back just when he thought he was gone forget he's back
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:15.080]  and as we see also sanders who said he was staying at the very end so he could have some
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:20.440]  leverage at the convention there's a report up on politico that he is losing his leverage
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:26.600]  as every day goes by he's becoming more and more yesterday's stories so it's going to be
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:31.000]  interesting to see what happens at the democrat convention if anything happens or will hillary
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:39.880]  have a complete lock now along those lines we have said all along that not only was the process rigged
[02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:45.480]  in the way that most people can plainly see she started out with you know 15 percent of the way
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:50.040]  she needed to be towards the finish line with the super delegates the whole process is rigged in
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:58.440]  that way very openly very openly but because of all of these super delegates and about 15 percent
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:02.920]  of them 10 to 15 percent in each state were reserved for super delegates the delegates
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:08.200]  are going to go to the convention that meant that he would have to beat her by 10 or 15 percent in
[02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:15.640]  order to get the same number of delegates because the democrat party makes every state a proportional
[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:22.200]  allocation of delegates so it's not a winner take all anywhere so even if he beat her and even if
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:28.040]  he beat her by 10 to 15 points they wound up getting the same number delegates anytime she beat him
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:35.320]  it was a skunk because she would get whatever edge she had plus the 10 or 15 percent of the
[02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:40.200]  delegates that were already there but of course there's other ways that they rigged the election
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:45.800]  as well and this is what we have to be concerned about when we come to the fall and I talked about
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:51.640]  this back when we had the Utah primary I thought it was kind of suspicious that the GOP had gone out
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:58.520]  and paid $80,000 in Utah to bring in smartmatic now this is the largest electronic voting machine
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:05.960]  company in the world but it is also a voting machine company that has I would say the longest
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:13.000]  rap sheet in the world smartmatic started in Venezuela by some friends of Hugo Chavez
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:18.040]  and they were involved in election after election that American officials said were being rigged
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:23.720]  by Hugo Chavez and then they started selling their machines elsewhere throughout central
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:29.480]  and south America as well as the Philippines and there is a long list from the Philippines to
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:35.880]  the Tabasco region in Mexico to Brazil to other central and south American countries
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:43.960]  where people have said hey you know something is wrong something is wrong the voting machines go
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:48.840]  down all of a sudden 25 percent of the votes are just gone and there's no audit trail with these
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:54.120]  machines they just disappeared how about that we tried to have an election where 25 percent of the
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:59.160]  votes millions tens of millions of votes just disappear well that's already happened in some
[02:38:59.160 --> 02:39:04.520]  countries and the more we put these electronic machines here the more that's going to happen
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:11.000]  in America and it will happen in America and Brazil where there is the currently the struggle
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.880]  for power that's going on there with a very very unpopular female socialist president
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:23.160]  sounds familiar doesn't it she was roundly booed just before the election at a soccer event she
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:30.280]  was down 10 points in the poll and yet she suddenly won by 10 points or so on the reelection
[02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:35.080]  and the interesting thing about that was that they didn't do any exit polls because exit polls are
[02:39:35.080 --> 02:39:43.560]  one of the indications I mean you have somebody that is losing an election before and they are
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:48.360]  maybe losing in the election afterwards by exit polls but then the official polls say
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:53.320]  hey they won by a large margin everybody knows there was fraud involved and so they shut that
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:58.280]  down and the company that always did that for Brazil that always did the exit polls from Brazil
[02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:02.440]  just decided they weren't going to do them for that particular election and then they got
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:07.080]  tens of millions of dollars in contracts from the Brazilian government afterwards
[02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:12.680]  looked like paola now why am I going into this history of this well because we've got an
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:19.320]  organization here this is a report from DC clothesline a racketeering lawsuit exposing nationwide
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:25.400]  vote rigging and dnc primaries could derail clinton they say this is a major lawsuit it's on the
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:29.800]  verge of being filed by the institute for american democracy and election integrity they were going
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:34.600]  to file it last week but they said no we want to wait and get the results from california
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:38.440]  because that was very important and we think there may have been fraud there they're going to take a
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:44.680]  look at that first get that information and possibly include that in the lawsuit the group claims that
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:50.200]  in about 11 states there has been a noted significant difference between exit polls
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:55.400]  and the electronic vote totals presented in the mornings after the primaries these differences
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:41:01.080]  show votes appear to be shifted from bernie sanders to hillary clinton you think you think
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:07.160]  they do that and so we see when we look at they've got a table here and they're showing the margin
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:16.600]  between them and the exit polls and the discrepancies in favor of clinton versus the other polls that
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:21.640]  were there and the interesting thing about this of course is that when you look at the margin what
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:27.320]  what is statistically significant well they say that the us government itself says that if there's
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:32.920]  more than a 2% difference between the official election polls and the exit polls that is the
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:37.480]  boundary by which the us government determines whether an election in another country has
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:45.800]  probably been stolen and notice that the exit polls in these 11 states they say 2016 dnc primaries
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:51.240]  they were significantly more than a 2% difference one of them was i think it was yeah over 10
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:56.600]  percent difference okay there they say this is not a republican democrat issue this is not a partisan
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:42:03.240]  issue this is an issue of democracy or i should say integrity we need to have honest elections and
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:08.280]  there's a number of ways that the elections can be stolen they can be stolen by super delegates by
[02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:13.880]  the other processes they can be stolen by having illegitimate voters they can be stolen by stuffing
[02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:19.560]  the electronic ballot machines that's one of the easiest ways to steal the elections the easiest
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:25.320]  way is by electronic means they say richard sharnan a mathematician statistician author of the book
[02:42:25.320 --> 02:42:30.280]  matrix of deceit has been reporting on the apparent shifting of electronic vote totals
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:36.760]  and the non-release of raw data from edison polling research okay i'll tell you who they
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:41.240]  are in just a moment since 2004 so he's been looking at this for 12 years he's well known for
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:46.920]  what he calls the redshift he says it's been a shift between exit polls and electronic vote
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:52.360]  totals a difference of about four to five percent each year and this constitutes a shift to the
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:57.800]  political right you understand this is not about left and right it's not about democrat republican
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:03.880]  this is about corruption this is about rigging electronic voting machines and how easy it is
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:09.320]  to do it and this guy who's been researching it for 12 years says typically it's a red shift
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:14.600]  typically it's a shift towards the red uh candidates okay and and i hate the fact that
[02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:20.280]  they do that because red really has always been the uh color of communism that's deliberately
[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:26.680]  why they reverse that on you by the way deliberately why they did that but it's going to shift towards
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:30.360]  the right let's just put it that way or conservatives of about four to five percent
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:35.240]  each year very suspicious but now what they saw in the primaries was a massive shift for
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:41.160]  hillary clinton now the same people who are rigging this system for the gop if that's what's
[02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:46.360]  been going on do you think that they could possibly rig this to make sure that hillary clinton wins
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:52.280]  because we've already got ted cruz meeting with uh gop conservatives in a secret meeting reported
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:56.840]  by the hill saying yeah we're planning to see what happens in the next election you know they're
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:44:03.240]  hoping that donald trump is going to lose because they're opposed to him because he opposes their
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:09.960]  globalist agenda of open borders of trade treaties or written by the corporations of continual foreign
[02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:15.800]  wars he opposes all of that and so for those reasons alone he must be stopped those are the
[02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:21.320]  vital issues to the establishment and both the republican and the democrat party that's why
[02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:25.640]  the establishment and both the republican and the democrat party want to see hillary clinton
[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:31.960]  win this election and that's why these people who have control and can flip the levers and these
[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:36.760]  electronic voting machines they've been shifting it to the conservatives you think they might shift
[02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:42.120]  it to hillary clinton so then they can run against her four years from now doesn't matter it isn't
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:46.280]  even about them beating hillary clinton four years from now it's about them getting their
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:53.560]  agenda through paul ryan and others mich mcconnell and others uh they want the open borders they want
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:59.400]  these transatlantic trade agreements that has to be run through as far as their concern they have
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:02.840]  to have this globalism this consolidation now who are these people this is kind of interesting
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:09.720]  you know we look at the exit polls i mentioned that in brazil after that dramatic reversal that
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:14.200]  one day reversal in the official election polls remember the brazilian president was down like
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:19.960]  10 and then uh the you know after that she's still very unpopular they're trying to impeach her
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:24.040]  and immediately after that she was she was very unpopular but for that particular day
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:32.040]  with the official results she won about 10 how did that happen and again the exit polling company
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:37.000]  didn't do any exit polls now we have an exit polling company here in america it's called
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:44.200]  edison research polling you may not have known this but they run all of the exit polling throughout
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:51.880]  the country since 1996 they run it as part of a pool you know they have these press pools so when
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:46:00.520]  you go to cover a political event many cases they don't let every single news organization into the
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:06.120]  event they'll have a press pool camera it would just get too crowded so what they'll do is i have
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:11.720]  people who are part of the press pool you will all get the feed from this one camera that's there
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:16.440]  instead of everybody having their own camera so there's that kind of pooling that goes on with
[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:22.440]  the press well for the election polls they have the national election pool and this company
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:29.240]  edison research has since 1996 provided all of the election polling all the exit polling for
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:38.520]  abc nbc cbs the big three in addition cnn fox ap they all belong to this national election pool
[02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:45.640]  and they all get their information from edison research polling now it's interesting isn't it
[02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:52.920]  that have you i don't recall and i follow politics pretty closely but i don't ever recall ever seeing
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:56.520]  any of these organizations that are part of the election pool they get this information from
[02:46:56.520 --> 02:47:04.680]  edison research i don't ever recall seeing them publicize the kind of numbers that this organization
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:09.560]  the institute for american democracy they've got the numbers of the exit poll and they're using
[02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:15.080]  it as the basis for their lawsuit saying that hillary clinton and the dnc rigged the primaries
[02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:19.480]  against bernie sanders but you've never seen these numbers that they've got here they don't
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:27.240]  publicize those on abc nbc cbs cnn fox and ap what you will see is you'll see cross tabulations of
[02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:34.280]  demographics they'll come out and they'll say well you know the majority this many of the women
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:40.360]  voted for candidate x and this many of the men voted for candidate y and they'll break it down by
[02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:46.520]  age group they'll break it down by income they'll break it down by oh of course race okay religion
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:50.280]  sometimes okay they'll break it down with all these different cross tabulations of the democrat
[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:58.840]  demographics but they won't come out and say well according to exit polls hillary got this many
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:03.960]  and bernie got that many you'll never see that you'll never see the grand total because that
[02:48:03.960 --> 02:48:10.200]  would look kind of bad wouldn't it if that number doesn't agree and if if it's radically different
[02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:16.760]  way outside the margin of error of the regular polls people would start to smell a rat wouldn't
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:23.880]  they so they don't report that information do they know and so i hope that this lawsuit
[02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:29.240]  goes somewhere i think that is very important um and again they are waiting to get the cross tab
[02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:33.640]  results out of california take a look at that that's what we have to be concerned about
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:40.840]  in the general election that it'll be stolen that'll be stolen and it will be a joint effort
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:47.720]  by the republican and by the democrat establishment who do not want to see a populist nationalist
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:52.680]  movement against their globalist trade treaties and open borders that's what we have to be concerned
[02:48:52.680 --> 02:48:58.760]  about now what's going on with the gun control agenda that they're putting on as i've said before
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:05.960]  and the aftermath of what happened and we see all these efforts to shut down any one who tries to
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:12.040]  say that what motivated this guy was islam of course that motivated him he was a homosexual
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:18.360]  he had nowhere nothing to do with his guilt except to try to punish other people he had no cross
[02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:27.240]  okay so he crucified everybody else and it was his religion that that motivated that
[02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:33.240]  that my wife has a friend from from college and she still follows people on facebook i don't
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:40.520]  do anything with facebook i hate that social media rigging but anyway um she follows people
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:47.800]  that we used to know and this friend of hers who teaches high school put up a thing on facebook

[02:49:56.200 --> 02:50:01.240]  him to do this we don't want to talk about the anger and the hatred and the religion that
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:04.760]  that caused that we don't want to talk about the open borders we don't want to talk about the fact
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:12.600]  that obama has gone in and has created all this unrest in all these countries as american government
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:18.600]  not just obama but of course uh the republicans before him they create the wars and then we reap
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:24.040]  the world when from it okay before i get into that i'm on this topic let me go to this free
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:30.120]  thought project talks about the results of the uh afghanistan and iraq war they say in spite of the

[02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:43.480]  there were before 2001 oh and with us there there's a lot more heroin that's being grown out of that
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:50.280]  region too uh that's another thing okay but they talk about how we have essentially created this

[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:11.080]  that are coming out from joe bay heart the view as well as former cia head former secretary of
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:16.680]  defense former congressman full-time scumbag leon panetta here's what he had to say about donald
[02:55:16.680 --> 02:55:23.480]  trump uh i wanted to get your reaction to what donald trump said this week which seemed to suggest
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:27.480]  somehow that the president of the united states was complicit or involved in a conspiracy or
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:33.160]  looking the other way uh this was trump on the air on monday with savannah gothrian today
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:40.200]  you said about the president he doesn't get it or he gets it better than anybody understands
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:46.280]  what do you mean by that whether a lot of people that think maybe he doesn't want to get it a lot
[02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:50.840]  of people think maybe he doesn't want to know about it i happen to think that he just doesn't
[02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:55.000]  know what he's doing but there are many people that think maybe he doesn't want to get it he
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:56:00.840]  doesn't want to see what's really happening now i know you haven't always tell rick linton but
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:06.760]  if you could take a step back if that's possible and react to donald trump suggestions about the
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:13.720]  united the president of the united states leon panetta well i have to tell you in
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:23.320]  50 years of public life i have never experienced a major party candidate uh making the accusations
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:29.320]  and raising the innuendos that donald trump raised particularly at this moment of crisis my
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:35.720]  experience is when this country has been attacked uh that this country comes together and unifies
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:45.080]  uh and tries to build a consensus about how we protect ourselves in the future what trump
[02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:51.560]  is doing is it is the exact opposite he's not only accusing president of united states of treason
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:59.720]  and collaborating with the enemy but in many ways what he's saying about uh restricting muslims
[02:56:59.720 --> 02:57:06.440]  from coming into this country doing surveillance on muslim mass uh is basically aiding and abetting
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:10.040]  the enemy okay let me let me say let me jump in at this point because we're running out of time
[02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:15.080]  here we don't have time to play the other clip in this segment i wanted to define for you who this
[02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:21.560]  guy was jeff sessions encountered him a few years ago asking him when he became uh secretary of
[02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:26.920]  defense so what would be the grounds on which we would go to war with you you would come to congress
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:31.080]  and act right and he says no no we would talk to the you actually he was talking about how
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:36.040]  they would go to the un they would go to the uh to nato to get permission and he goes but but
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:40.760]  you would ask congress well no probably not but we would probably tell you what we decided to do at
[02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:45.160]  some point but and sessions was absolutely incredulous we're going to play that clip for you when we
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:52.440]  come back but i gotta say he's accusing the president of actually aiding the enemy that is a known
[02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:58.680]  fact it is a documented fact that we are giving arms to isis we're running them through turkey
[02:57:58.680 --> 02:58:02.920]  we have documented this over and over again and not just us many media outlets have documented the
[02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:08.840]  fact that we are supplying them with arms going all the way back through republicans and democrats
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:14.840]  to the mujahideen and afghanistan fighting the russians we created them we gave them the stinger
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:20.280]  missiles then we turned them into al qaeda then we turned them into isis we created the terrorist
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:25.480]  playground in libya the democrat administration the obama administration with secretary clinton
[02:58:25.480 --> 02:58:30.040]  turned that place into total chaos or trying to do it in syria that's what he's talking about let
[02:58:30.040 --> 02:58:44.360]  me make that clear for you we'll do that when we come back stay with us this is gcn the genesis

[03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:16.280]  welcome back to the fourth hour the alex jones show i'm david night your host
[03:00:16.280 --> 03:00:21.320]  we'll be joined at the bottom of the hour with rob do because we really want to expand this
[03:00:21.320 --> 03:00:27.000]  coverage of the terror watch list and what is really you should be concerned about this folks
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:31.560]  uh this is a very very dangerous thing we're going to break that down for you we're going to talk
[03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:36.120]  about all the kids that are being put on the terror watch list as well as the other abuses
[03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:42.120]  that are possible uh with this secret process but we were talking in the last segment about
[03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:48.520]  leon panetta and he's attacking trump and he's uh coming out and saying well uh he's not only
[03:00:48.520 --> 03:00:53.400]  accusing the president united states of treason collaborating with the enemy but what he's saying
[03:00:53.400 --> 03:00:58.520]  about restricting muslims is going to get them mad and they're going to attack us and we've heard
[03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:03.880]  that before haven't we you know i mean do we really want to bring people into this country is that
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:08.600]  an argument for bringing people in this country saying you know what if we don't kowtow to them
[03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:12.520]  they're going to get violent with us it's like well then maybe what we ought to do is just leave
[03:01:12.520 --> 03:01:18.200]  them where they are we have always helped people in the past when there's been a natural natural
[03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:23.320]  disaster in their country now our foreign aid doesn't really work too well at most of the time it
[03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:28.440]  gets sucked up by the dictators in these countries they wind up taking the food from the people's
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:34.760]  mouths but they do that anyway and we really cannot bring people from all over the world
[03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:39.080]  into the united states without any background checks i mean all these people who are screaming
[03:01:39.080 --> 03:01:43.560]  about gun control saying background checks background checks the guy who was a shooter in
[03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:48.920]  orlando had been vetted by the world's largest private security company he'd worked for them for
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:53.720]  eight years he'd been vetted by the state of florida had a statewide firearms license and many
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:58.680]  other issues he had been investigated three times by the fbi he'd been on the terror watch list
[03:01:59.560 --> 03:02:03.640]  and they hadn't done anything about that this company worked for homeland security so he got
[03:02:03.640 --> 03:02:08.200]  homeland security the fbi the state government of florida as well as the world's largest private
[03:02:08.200 --> 03:02:14.760]  security firm nobody saw anything in his background to stop it are we vetting people who were coming
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:19.560]  into this country that carefully that closely of course not we don't know a fraction about them
[03:02:19.560 --> 03:02:24.520]  that we do about him and if there's refugees wouldn't you think it'd be fairly evenly distributed
[03:02:24.520 --> 03:02:29.720]  between men women and children wouldn't be distributed between all different kinds of ages
[03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:37.320]  why is it that we're only getting as refugees young men in their 20s and 30s who you would think
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:42.680]  would be fighting the people who are destroying their country instead of running out okay shoving
[03:02:42.680 --> 03:02:46.760]  every at the very least they're shoving everybody aside and jumping on the lifeboats themselves
[03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:51.480]  those are the people we're bringing in into this country where the background checks for them
[03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:59.800]  where's the watch list for them no all the controls are for you americans we've been told by j
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:04.680]  johnson homeland security yes this is a national security issue gun control is now going to become
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:08.600]  a national security issue and we're really more concerned about those right-wingers than we are
[03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:13.240]  islamic extremists of course you are we've pointed that out a long time so you've got
[03:03:13.960 --> 03:03:19.000]  leon panetta saying that donald trump is triggering people okay now we'll talk about
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:24.280]  triggering in a minute but let's play i want to introduce who is this guy who is this former cia
[03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:29.720]  who is this former secretary of defense here's an exchange between jeff sessions and leon panetta
[03:03:29.720 --> 03:03:34.200]  a few years ago we're working with an international coalition and we're working with nato jeff
[03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:40.200]  session uh we would uh want to be able to uh get appropriate permissions in order to be able to
[03:03:40.200 --> 03:03:44.040]  to do that that's you'd ask him what's the basis of what you're going to send people to war
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:48.600]  these would want to have some kind of legal basis on which to act on what billy gobeis is
[03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:55.800]  are you looking for what what entity to go to war well i obviously the you if nato made the
[03:03:55.800 --> 03:04:02.040]  decision to go in that would be one uh if uh if we if we developed an international coalition
[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:08.120]  beyond nato uh then obviously some kind of un security resolution so on a coalition of
[03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:16.360]  so you're saying nato would give you a legal basis and uh um this is jeff sessions coalition of
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:20.440]  nations the guy who's been advising donald trump on a legal basis he can't believe what he's hearing
[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:26.840]  if we if we if we were able to put together a coalition uh and uh we're able to move together
[03:04:26.840 --> 03:04:32.760]  then obviously we would seek whatever legal basis we would need in order to make that uh justified
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:38.840]  i mean you you know we can't just pull them all together uh in a combat so he needs the support
[03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:44.200]  of nato in the un to go to war not congress who are you asking for the legal basis from
[03:04:46.520 --> 03:04:51.880]  if it's uh obviously if the un passed a security resolution as it did in libya we would do that
[03:04:51.880 --> 03:04:56.360]  they just keep going back and forth and finally senator session says i can't believe what i'm
[03:04:56.360 --> 03:05:00.920]  hearing you're a congressman you know what the constitution said news in the battle for the
[03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:07.560]  republic this morning as it looks like the democrats do process violating gun bill is doomed
[03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:14.280]  despite support by brock hussein obama and the justice department the legislation would permit
[03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:21.000]  the federal government to deny individuals on a secret terrorist watch list the right to exercise
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:27.160]  the second amendment yesterday democrat senator joe manchin went on the morning joe show and said
[03:05:27.160 --> 03:05:32.920]  due process is a firewall problem we have and really the firewall that we have right now
[03:05:32.920 --> 03:05:37.640]  there's due process here it's all due process so we can all say yeah we want the same thing
[03:05:37.640 --> 03:05:41.880]  but how do we get there due process is what's killing us right now currently there are a
[03:05:41.880 --> 03:05:49.480]  number of terror watch list all in violation of due process there is basically no standard of evidence
[03:05:49.480 --> 03:05:55.880]  for being placed on a watch list and it's nearly impossible to challenge one's status and you can
[03:05:55.880 --> 03:06:01.480]  learn more right now at info wars dot com not a group you develop living defense for us it took

[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:12.920]  message here's why my friends we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse so please
[03:07:12.920 --> 03:07:18.920]  listen solar generators really do provide lifesaving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar
[03:07:18.920 --> 03:07:23.960]  generators run silently emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun whether it's
[03:07:23.960 --> 03:07:29.240]  dangerous summer storms blackouts intensifying civil unrest you're not going to have to suffer
[03:07:29.240 --> 03:07:33.160]  through it like the rest of the sheep and here's the best news if you want to get one this week

[03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:23.480]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcm radio network
[03:08:26.920 --> 03:08:31.960]  all right welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this friday june 17th 2016
[03:08:32.680 --> 03:08:38.040]  i want to finish that clip that we were playing in the last segment of uh center sessions and leon
[03:08:38.040 --> 03:08:44.280]  panetta talking about what is the basis for war anymore do you have a constitution well according
[03:08:44.280 --> 03:08:51.160]  to leon panetta no and senator sessions cannot believe his ears i mean even with all the years
[03:08:51.160 --> 03:08:56.280]  that he's spent in washington he can't believe it and i want to play that because this is a guy
[03:08:56.280 --> 03:09:01.080]  leon panetta who is out there saying well you know donald trump is going to trigger muslims he is
[03:09:01.080 --> 03:09:05.720]  recruiting people for isis because he's saying uh we're going to vet people coming into the country
[03:09:05.720 --> 03:09:09.800]  and at the same time these same people are saying we got to have more background checks we got to
[03:09:09.800 --> 03:09:17.960]  have more watch lists for people for americans not for the people coming from the countries that
[03:09:17.960 --> 03:09:22.680]  we are currently bombing no the bombs and the assassinations and the wars that we start in
[03:09:22.680 --> 03:09:27.960]  their countries that doesn't trigger them at all no what triggers them is saying we're going to
[03:09:27.960 --> 03:09:31.720]  investigate your background before you come in or you're not going to come in that triggers them
[03:09:31.720 --> 03:09:36.360]  that triggers them we should be aware that we should be scared of doing that uh it's donald
[03:09:36.360 --> 03:09:41.160]  trump's fault okay before we get back to that clip i just want to let you know we've got a
[03:09:41.160 --> 03:09:45.320]  couple of specials we've got the alexa pure water filter special which is still going on it's uh
[03:09:45.320 --> 03:09:50.920]  going to be for limited time only uh so look at that now while it's available at infowarstore.com
[03:09:50.920 --> 03:09:55.960]  20 off all the alexa pure water filters that's from everything from the super high quality
[03:09:55.960 --> 03:10:00.680]  gravity fed alexa pure pro water filtration system all the way down to the smaller shower
[03:10:00.680 --> 03:10:07.000]  filters all of these items are 20 off now is the time to stock up get the lowest prices the alexa
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:14.520]  pure filtration system removes up to 99.999 percent of bacteria disinfectants volatile
[03:10:14.520 --> 03:10:21.080]  organic contaminants and hormones so whether you're on a well or whether you are on a city water supply
[03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:27.400]  this is an excellent filter to have and again 20 off everything from the biggest systems down to the
[03:10:27.400 --> 03:10:32.680]  shower filters that will filter out the chlorine that's coming through your urban water supply
[03:10:33.640 --> 03:10:38.440]  going back to this clip i want to go back and play a little bit this maybe you want to back
[03:10:38.440 --> 03:10:44.440]  this up a little bit this is a back and forth you've got senator sessions asking now this guy
[03:10:44.440 --> 03:10:49.880]  leon panetta he has been a congressman then he became a secretary of defense then he became
[03:10:49.880 --> 03:10:53.720]  cia director i think that was the order i think that's the last thing he did was cia director
[03:10:53.720 --> 03:11:01.800]  uh under obama from 2009 to 2011 says the article on info wars but this was when he was secretary
[03:11:01.800 --> 03:11:06.520]  defense and we had senator sessions saying to him under what conditions would you go to war
[03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:11.400]  and he starts talking about how they're going to get approval try to get a coalition together
[03:11:12.040 --> 03:11:15.960]  at the u n or with nato or whatever and he goes yeah but but who are you going to ask for
[03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:21.960]  issues kind of leading him along leading him along and let's go back to that clip asking for the
[03:11:21.960 --> 03:11:30.040]  legal basis from if it's uh obviously if the un passed a security resolution as it did in libya
[03:11:30.040 --> 03:11:36.760]  we would do that uh if uh if nato came together as we did in bosnia uh we would rely on that so
[03:11:36.760 --> 03:11:43.000]  you know we we have options here uh if we want to build the kind of international approach
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:49.560]  to dealing with the situation i'm for all for having an international support but i i'm really
[03:11:49.560 --> 03:11:55.240]  baffled that's all really nice but that that somehow an international assembly provides a
[03:11:55.240 --> 03:12:01.960]  legal basis for the united states military to be deployed in combat i don't believe it's close to
[03:12:02.520 --> 03:12:09.320]  being correct they have they provide no legal authority the only legal authority that's required
[03:12:09.320 --> 03:12:15.400]  to deploy the united states military is uh the congress and the president and the law and the
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:22.280]  constitute jeff sessions for vice president this guy believes the constitution he's absolutely
[03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:27.240]  incredulous with leon panetta at one point we let this go on he goes i can't believe what i'm here
[03:12:27.240 --> 03:12:31.480]  because they go back and forth and leon panetta after he lectures him on the constitution leon
[03:12:31.480 --> 03:12:35.960]  panetta says yeah we we would let the congress know but we're not going to go to them for authority
[03:12:35.960 --> 03:12:40.600]  we will go to a foreign body for authority or we'll make the determination on our own
[03:12:40.600 --> 03:12:43.880]  but we're not going to go to congress for a declaration of war not going to do that
[03:12:43.880 --> 03:12:51.000]  and senator session says i can't believe this you were a congressman you know the constitution says
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:56.680]  you swore an oath to the constitution senator sessions takes this very seriously he takes
[03:12:56.680 --> 03:13:01.560]  his oath of office seriously he takes the oath of the constitution seriously this is the only
[03:13:01.560 --> 03:13:07.800]  that senator senator sessions who challenged this practice that has been a bipartisan practice
[03:13:07.800 --> 03:13:12.440]  of we'll do whatever we want anywhere in the world we'll go to war with anybody we won't ask
[03:13:12.440 --> 03:13:17.160]  the representatives of the american people according to the constitution to get a declaration of war
[03:13:17.880 --> 03:13:24.440]  he takes it seriously and he was the only person when they finally made this these private trade
[03:13:24.440 --> 03:13:29.240]  treaties a trans-pacific transatlantic treaties when they finally made them available to our
[03:13:29.240 --> 03:13:34.760]  elected representatives senator sessions was the only one the only one who went down and read them
[03:13:35.560 --> 03:13:40.360]  and he was amazed he was just as appalled as he was with this clip where you saw him going back
[03:13:40.360 --> 03:13:47.640]  and forth with this globalist shill leon panetta cia director secretary of defense
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:55.720]  and he said he put together a presentation for his fellow senators and said look at what we're
[03:13:55.720 --> 03:14:02.040]  about to pass look at this thing that we're you know we're we're throwing away the procedure to
[03:14:02.040 --> 03:14:07.960]  ratify a treaty the procedure ratify a treaty is two-thirds of the senate we're saying we're not
[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:11.000]  going to do that we're going to have a trade promotion authority that we're going to do it's
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:15.640]  just a simple majority because they didn't have a two-thirds majority of the senate to support
[03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:20.680]  this so i said well okay we don't have the vote so let's just uh invent some new process that
[03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:25.240]  doesn't have anything to do with the constitution we'll call the tpa and we'll say senators can't
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:30.360]  have a filibuster senators and the house can't offer any amendments to it you know we'll let
[03:14:30.360 --> 03:14:35.080]  the house vote on it too but it'll just be a simple majority nobody can offer any amendments
[03:14:35.080 --> 03:14:40.680]  nobody can have any filibusters uh and they're going to have to vote on it with just 20 hours of
[03:14:40.680 --> 03:14:45.480]  talking about it and you're not going to be able to block it from coming up to a vote
[03:14:45.480 --> 03:14:49.080]  and either the house or the senate so they just greased this whole thing through and he said look
[03:14:49.080 --> 03:14:53.160]  understand there's a lot of problems with this he laid out the problems and he said the biggest
[03:14:53.160 --> 03:14:58.360]  problem is once you pass this agreement it becomes a living document you have no control over what
[03:14:58.360 --> 03:15:04.520]  happens to the trade in your country anymore after that they're going to have this international
[03:15:04.520 --> 03:15:10.360]  commission that will sit there and make determinations as to which industries and which countries will
[03:15:10.360 --> 03:15:16.680]  be rewarded which industries and which countries will be punished this will be made in determination
[03:15:16.680 --> 03:15:22.120]  by unelected people at an international council that's what senator sessions was telling him
[03:15:22.120 --> 03:15:28.920]  senator sessions has been telling this to donald trump since last august he started educating him
[03:15:28.920 --> 03:15:35.480]  about the tpp and now his former chief of staff is now the foreign policy chief of staff for
[03:15:35.480 --> 03:15:43.960]  donald trump i hope that donald trump picks somebody that is a principled constitutional
[03:15:44.520 --> 03:15:51.240]  conservative like senator jeff sessions uh let's hope that that happens now what is really happening
[03:15:51.240 --> 03:15:57.320]  with this i mean is it really is it really donald trump's fault that uh isis is getting upset
[03:15:57.320 --> 03:16:01.800]  uh is our president really giving them the weapons of course our president's giving
[03:16:01.800 --> 03:16:05.720]  him the weapons doesn't point out we've documented this many times but let's just step back for a
[03:16:05.720 --> 03:16:11.640]  moment and let's look at the history of what's happened in afghanistan and iraq with those wars
[03:16:11.640 --> 03:16:16.200]  the free thought project says in spite of trillions wasted thousands dead there is no there are now
[03:16:16.200 --> 03:16:23.160]  more taliban in afghanistan than there were before 2001 more than 2300 of our troops are dead tens of
[03:16:23.160 --> 03:16:28.440]  thousands more mangled and traumatized more than 11 000 innocent women and children turned
[03:16:28.440 --> 03:16:34.040]  into casualties tens of thousands of other lives ruined permanently ended and there's nothing to
[03:16:34.040 --> 03:16:39.400]  show for it there are more taliban controlling the region now than before bush's assault on
[03:16:39.400 --> 03:16:44.120]  the country 15 years ago aside from the countless ruined lives the cost of the war has reached
[03:16:44.120 --> 03:16:51.800]  astronomical cash proportions mountains of debt for us for our children for our great grandchildren
[03:16:51.800 --> 03:16:57.000]  the congressional research service has pointed out that the wars in afghanistan and iraq have
[03:16:57.000 --> 03:17:04.760]  cost us taxpayers 1.6 trillion dollars what other things could we have bought with that other than
[03:17:05.320 --> 03:17:10.120]  massive death however according to the report from time magazine last year that number is a
[03:17:10.120 --> 03:17:14.520]  gross underestimate they say a truer measure of the war's total cost would be between four and
[03:17:14.520 --> 03:17:18.920]  five trillion dollars because what they do is a factor in things like long-term medical care
[03:17:18.920 --> 03:17:24.200]  and disability compensation for service members veterans their families military replenishment
[03:17:24.760 --> 03:17:28.600]  social and economic costs oh see that military replenishment that's when the
[03:17:28.600 --> 03:17:35.800]  military industrial complex gets to sell more bombs to us after we've used those bombs
[03:17:35.800 --> 03:17:41.480]  say that's replenishment that's why they make so much money out of these wars they say occupying
[03:17:41.480 --> 03:17:47.400]  a foreign country creates enemies you think yeah that's what creates enemies it isn't by saying
[03:17:47.400 --> 03:17:51.960]  we're going to restrict immigration from my country then all of a sudden they're going to attack us
[03:17:51.960 --> 03:17:59.240]  for that no they attack us because we are killing them and it's not having any results
[03:18:00.200 --> 03:18:08.120]  nation building is a failed strategy from the beginning we can't force democracy and self
[03:18:08.120 --> 03:18:15.080]  government on people that don't want it don't understand it they have a system closely tied
[03:18:15.080 --> 03:18:20.680]  to their religion of totalitarianism is called sharia law look at it and what they point out
[03:18:20.680 --> 03:18:26.920]  here this is a great headline they were planting a garden in which a million bin ladens would later
[03:18:26.920 --> 03:18:35.240]  bloom think about that our policy throughout the middle east has been planting a garden
[03:18:35.880 --> 03:18:38.920]  where a million bin ladens would later bloom
[03:18:38.920 --> 03:18:49.400]  bin laden being the establishment metaphor meme for terrorism okay but it's real there is real
[03:18:49.400 --> 03:18:58.680]  terrorism and not only are did they create the the garden to let terrorism bloom but they are
[03:18:58.680 --> 03:19:06.520]  now importing the fruits of that war into our country that anger that frustration that hatred
[03:19:06.520 --> 03:19:10.920]  and it will only build and get worse with the second generation that is what we're seeing
[03:19:10.920 --> 03:19:14.920]  everywhere we saw that in France we saw that with the shooting in Orlando it is the second
[03:19:14.920 --> 03:19:21.240]  generation that is always worse it's the second generation that doesn't even understand what
[03:19:21.240 --> 03:19:29.000]  the they escape from is looking for an identity is angry at America because they've been propagandized
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:35.240]  by the American educational system that is teaching everyone to hate the principles of America to
[03:19:35.240 --> 03:19:40.920]  hate the people who founded this country to hate people based on their race hate white people hate
[03:19:40.920 --> 03:19:46.680]  males hate all of this find your identity and wherever it was that your parents came from and
[03:19:46.680 --> 03:19:51.480]  attack the roots of America that's what our foreign policy is about that's what our immigration
[03:19:51.480 --> 03:20:03.080]  policy is about stay with us we'll be right back hi this is Ron Paul i'm a former 22 year congressman
[03:20:03.080 --> 03:20:08.040]  and republican presidential candidate i'm here to tell you about something that just might save
[03:20:08.040 --> 03:20:13.160]  your lives you never know when there will be another Katrina an economic collapse or a serious
[03:20:13.160 --> 03:20:17.960]  drought we should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times i'm going
[03:20:17.960 --> 03:20:23.800]  to tell you about a great way to do that a u.s company named harvest right has a kitchen appliance
[03:20:23.800 --> 03:20:29.400]  that can help you be prepared it's a home freeze dryer with the product you can preserve the food

[03:24:12.360 --> 03:24:15.400]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night in the next segment we're going to have
[03:24:16.040 --> 03:24:20.760]  rob do and leon macadoo join me we're going to be talking about the watch list and other
[03:24:20.760 --> 03:24:25.640]  issues about gun control i guess we'll have the team of do and macadoo coming in here
[03:24:27.320 --> 03:24:34.360]  so let me start this off by catching you up on current events we had yesterday the end of a
[03:24:34.360 --> 03:24:40.760]  filibuster by democrats to try to bring the table legislation that would tie these secret
[03:24:40.760 --> 03:24:46.680]  watch lists to gun control it would be a basically a no buy list for people who were put on this
[03:24:46.680 --> 03:24:53.000]  watch list now is this going to pass well npr says they think that it's unlikely they're going to
[03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:58.040]  vote on four gun control measures monday evening uh npr doesn't think any of those are going to go
[03:24:58.040 --> 03:25:03.240]  through we got an article from uh curt nemo at info wars dot com passage of democrat gun bill
[03:25:03.240 --> 03:25:08.120]  violating our due process is unlikely in the senate he says it's uncertain if feinstein's bill
[03:25:08.120 --> 03:25:13.480]  and competing legislation sponsored by senator john cornan of texas will receive the 60 votes
[03:25:13.480 --> 03:25:18.360]  required unless a deal is reached feinstein's legislation would permit the federal government
[03:25:18.360 --> 03:25:24.280]  to deny individuals on a secret terrorist watch list the right to exercise the second amendment
[03:25:24.280 --> 03:25:28.680]  if authorities decide there's a reasonable belief that the weapon could be used in connection
[03:25:28.680 --> 03:25:33.960]  with terrorism cornan said negotiations in the senate failed because feinstein thought due process
[03:25:33.960 --> 03:25:39.960]  of law in the constitution were not necessary so uh cornan's version of legislation would keep
[03:25:39.960 --> 03:25:44.200]  constitutional protections in place it would allow the government to put a gun purchase on hold for
[03:25:44.200 --> 03:25:49.960]  72 hours prosecutors would then be able to convince a judge that there was probable cause
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:56.280]  in order to permanently block a sale so what's happening with this is there's a lot of pressure
[03:25:56.280 --> 03:26:00.360]  we got people like pierce morgan coming after donald trump and doing an editorial immediately
[03:26:00.360 --> 03:26:05.320]  after the shooting saying come on donal come on in our rates time you guys gave up some of your
[03:26:05.320 --> 03:26:11.720]  freedoms we have to do something about this shooting and they're listening the nra and
[03:26:11.720 --> 03:26:15.720]  donald trump have tweeted out that they're going to talk about doing something in the
[03:26:15.720 --> 03:26:21.160]  interest of national security about this terrorist watch list and that should concern us all
[03:26:22.120 --> 03:26:26.920]  because what we're seeing now is a movement by both the left and the right to enact new gun
[03:26:26.920 --> 03:26:32.680]  control laws this effort that we have here by john cornan with all of the bluster about how
[03:26:32.680 --> 03:26:37.880]  we're going to have due process everything process is a bunch of nonsense because quite frankly
[03:26:38.920 --> 03:26:46.520]  if somebody is uh on a terror watch list we should be asking what that is i want to go back to an
[03:26:46.520 --> 03:26:53.880]  article here that goes back to december of this last december december 2015 the la times not exactly
[03:26:53.880 --> 03:26:58.360]  a second amendment publication folks these are people who don't like the second amendment
[03:26:58.360 --> 03:27:04.040]  they say should people on the no fly list be able to buy guns they said yes because you know
[03:27:04.040 --> 03:27:08.200]  what if you don't do that you're going to be punishing people before you give them due process
[03:27:09.080 --> 03:27:13.320]  you know you have a secret list that you're creating and then you're going to on the basis
[03:27:13.320 --> 03:27:17.880]  of that secret list you're going to punish people they say it seems simple enough if the federal
[03:27:17.880 --> 03:27:22.440]  government based on intelligence or on policing puts a person on its watch list of suspected
[03:27:22.440 --> 03:27:26.760]  terrorists or decrees that he or she is too dangerous to be allowed on an airplane then
[03:27:26.760 --> 03:27:32.280]  surely it would also be foolish to let that person buy a firearm in the us it makes sense doesn't it
[03:27:32.280 --> 03:27:37.720]  because that's the argument we've heard over and over again from imam obama he says that was a thrust
[03:27:37.720 --> 03:27:43.400]  of a proposed law by senator diane feinstein that her senate colleagues rejected last week
[03:27:43.400 --> 03:27:49.240]  the idea was resuscitated by imam obama and his oval office address on that sunday evening he said
[03:27:49.240 --> 03:27:55.160]  what could possibly be the argument for allowing a terrorist suspect to buy a semi-automatic weapon
[03:27:55.160 --> 03:28:00.680]  they said the problem is the people on the no fly list as well as the people who are on the broader
[03:28:00.680 --> 03:28:05.160]  terror watch list from which is drawn have not been convicted of doing anything wrong
[03:28:06.760 --> 03:28:13.000]  see the punishment doesn't fit the crime the punishment precedes the crime we are combining
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:20.760]  the worst aspects of our most dystopian science fiction all together here in one place we've got
[03:28:20.760 --> 03:28:25.640]  elements of george orwell we've got elements of france kafka we've got elements of philip k
[03:28:25.640 --> 03:28:32.120]  dick in his minority report pre crime all these things are being brought together in a hellish
[03:28:32.120 --> 03:28:38.040]  to tyranny there's going to be controlled by a government that watches and controls your every
[03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:43.960]  move don't think that they're not going to use these watch lists to deny you complete movement
[03:28:43.960 --> 03:28:51.480]  in this country the tsa is the transportation administration okay not the airport administration
[03:28:52.200 --> 03:28:58.120]  security safety whatever the s stands for i could care less it's a total lie it's a total fraud
[03:28:58.120 --> 03:29:03.400]  they're not providing security or safety for anybody and it is about transportation and they're
[03:29:03.400 --> 03:29:11.000]  going to be taking control of the automobiles everything in the next few years with technology
[03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:15.400]  so they're going to be able to shut you down completely not just control whether or not you
[03:29:15.400 --> 03:29:21.720]  get firearms we have to be focused on the watch list we have to watch the watchers why are they
[03:29:21.720 --> 03:29:25.800]  putting people on this list how do you get on it how do you get off where's the due process
[03:29:25.800 --> 03:29:31.720]  where is the constitution we come back we're going to talk with we're going to be joined by
[03:29:31.720 --> 03:29:39.000]  due and macadoo and we're going to talk about these watch lists we're watching stay with us
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:43.880]  watch us we'll be right back
[03:29:48.920 --> 03:29:55.640]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:59.560 --> 03:30:04.440]  a british member of parliament has just been shot with a handgun and stabbed to death with a knife
[03:30:04.440 --> 03:30:09.560]  the killer got a job six years ago working in a park after being referred by a mental health clinic
[03:30:09.560 --> 03:30:15.080]  he said working in the park was quote better than all the psychotherapy and medication in the world
[03:30:15.080 --> 03:30:19.800]  this happens exactly one week before the brexit vote the referendum on whether britain will leave
[03:30:19.800 --> 03:30:25.080]  the european union a fear campaign by prime minister cameron and others has tried without success
[03:30:25.080 --> 03:30:30.440]  to scare people about economic recrimination by the bankers and the european elite if they leave
[03:30:30.440 --> 03:30:35.480]  now with poll showing leave with a clear majority and remain supporters largely apathetic the shooting
[03:30:35.480 --> 03:30:40.840]  has quickly been politicized by the media and the ruling elite to create fear of british nationalism
[03:30:40.840 --> 03:30:46.200]  and to energize the supporters of globalism they report the mentally ill man shouted britain first
[03:30:46.200 --> 03:30:51.640]  as he shot the uk got gun control decades ago and of course murder rates soared so it won't
[03:30:51.640 --> 03:30:57.160]  be used to push for gun control but it will be used to try to energize the supporters of globalism

[03:34:47.880 --> 03:34:53.000]  real quickly before we get back into the watch list stuff are you aware that the senate has now
[03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:59.640]  approved women having to register for the draft so now women have equality and slavery wow that's
[03:34:59.640 --> 03:35:04.680]  part of the ndaa i knew that was coming yeah wait it hasn't become law yet because it still has to
[03:35:04.680 --> 03:35:11.880]  go the house the house has previously rejected women as slaves and and so now go back and
[03:35:11.880 --> 03:35:19.320]  revisit that issue uh but again i just have to say my parents generation and nobody had to uh
[03:35:19.880 --> 03:35:24.680]  had to hold a gun to anybody's head to get them to uh join the fight after pearl harbor if you've
[03:35:24.680 --> 03:35:29.880]  got a justified war if your country has been attacked or whatever and i understand the basis
[03:35:29.880 --> 03:35:36.280]  of uh pearl harbor i know that fdr had people step down i know that to that degree uh what was going
[03:35:36.280 --> 03:35:40.040]  on nevertheless people who were there they understood that point they were in it they were
[03:35:40.040 --> 03:35:44.760]  in a fight for their lives just like we're seeing with the war on terror i mean you you create this
[03:35:44.760 --> 03:35:50.440]  situation uh and then you know once the shooting starts you know you got to pick up a gun and
[03:35:50.440 --> 03:35:55.160]  once you have the false flag once you got the false flag yeah with 9 11 yeah you know people
[03:35:55.160 --> 03:35:59.160]  can say what they want about it there's something fishy going on there and but that caused a lot
[03:35:59.160 --> 03:36:04.520]  of people joe begs included who saw that and said you know i want to go uh fight and who's
[03:36:04.520 --> 03:36:09.000]  the football player the arizona cardinal um yeah ended up getting killed after he decided oh he's
[03:36:09.000 --> 03:36:13.240]  like wait i'm fighting for the wrong people in the wrong reasons that's right and we're running
[03:36:13.240 --> 03:36:17.960]  running drugs i forget his name uh pat tillman yes exactly well i i'm watching game of thrones
[03:36:17.960 --> 03:36:22.120]  right now and it's kind of it's just the same thing over and over and over again except for back
[03:36:22.120 --> 03:36:26.440]  then they could just say give us all your men in the village and they're gonna go fight our war
[03:36:26.440 --> 03:36:30.280]  for us it's the same thing here but then now they have to find new ways to convince people to go
[03:36:30.280 --> 03:36:35.080]  and fight their wars that's right if you've got a clear cause if it's justified uh or even if you've
[03:36:35.080 --> 03:36:40.440]  got a good backstory with a false flag you don't need a draft but you know what we should be afraid
[03:36:40.440 --> 03:36:46.520]  of very afraid of is the fact that they are so anxious to start a war with russia start a war
[03:36:46.520 --> 03:36:51.720]  yeah exactly yeah you guys uh do some computer stuff and they tell us that it's from russia we
[03:36:51.720 --> 03:36:56.680]  don't know that it's from russia i mean most the arizona russian hacker who's really a cia double
[03:36:56.680 --> 03:37:01.400]  agent yeah it could be any number of things that's right and that's not even a violent act although
[03:37:01.400 --> 03:37:08.440]  you know it just it leaves too much too much open ground yeah to uh to start it's just something
[03:37:08.440 --> 03:37:13.080]  that we could that the only way to finish it is an all out war and that's something i don't think
[03:37:13.080 --> 03:37:18.280]  90 of the people want nobody wants but they're really gearing us up for it and no real control
[03:37:18.280 --> 03:37:21.640]  over it either if they're just going to tell us yeah you know there was this uh cyber attack and
[03:37:21.640 --> 03:37:25.560]  so now we're going to have a physical war let's start world war three because there was a cyber
[03:37:25.560 --> 03:37:31.400]  attack here let's get to the watch list because this is very key you know this is uh the la times that
[03:37:31.400 --> 03:37:36.760]  i was reading from talking about how the problem is how do you get on the no fly list i mean we
[03:37:36.760 --> 03:37:40.920]  operating from the assumption here the nra let me read you what the nra is saying here
[03:37:40.920 --> 03:37:46.280]  nra statement on terror watch lists and this is from their legal organization the institute for
[03:37:46.280 --> 03:37:52.200]  legislative action so this is the nra il a they say the nra believes terrorists should not be allowed
[03:37:52.200 --> 03:37:57.160]  to purchase or possess firearms period oh who's going to disagree with that question is who is
[03:37:57.160 --> 03:38:02.920]  a terrorist who gets to define what a terrorist is and they say anyone on a terror watch list
[03:38:03.480 --> 03:38:08.200]  who tries to buy a gun should be thoroughly investigated by the fbi and the sale should
[03:38:08.200 --> 03:38:13.640]  be delayed while the investigation is ongoing and that's the legislation that's being offered by
[03:38:13.640 --> 03:38:19.720]  texas senator cornan an opposition to diane feinstein which is just basically uh say well as
[03:38:19.720 --> 03:38:24.600]  long as you know whatever we're just going to use it to do gun control the nra continues and says if
[03:38:24.600 --> 03:38:28.840]  an investigation uncovers evidence of terrorist activity or involvement the government should be
[03:38:28.840 --> 03:38:33.720]  allowed to immediately go to court block the sale and arrest the terrorist and look at this it's like
[03:38:33.720 --> 03:38:37.800]  wait a minute and arrest the terrorists they've got a lot of these are it is terrorist there's a lot
[03:38:37.800 --> 03:38:42.040]  of steps and due process that they left out here and the steps that they've got are in the wrong
[03:38:42.040 --> 03:38:47.960]  order the punishment doesn't come first and you don't become a terrorist because somebody accuses
[03:38:47.960 --> 03:38:52.440]  you secretly and puts you on a secret watch list that you don't know anything about we've had people
[03:38:52.440 --> 03:38:59.080]  like ted kennedy put on a terror watch list and told that he was not able to fly turned out it was a
[03:38:59.080 --> 03:39:05.960]  t kennedy and it took the senator kennedy uh three weeks to get his name cleared now in that
[03:39:05.960 --> 03:39:10.680]  particular case i would say maybe it was justified and i would say that because politically i don't
[03:39:10.680 --> 03:39:14.440]  agree with him and that's what this is going to become it's going to become an instrument of
[03:39:14.440 --> 03:39:18.680]  political oppression okay not that i would do that to somebody because i disagree with him
[03:39:18.680 --> 03:39:23.000]  politically i was joking about that but that's precisely what they will do we've been told
[03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:28.920]  this is about domestic right wing extremists more than it is about islamic terrorists how
[03:39:28.920 --> 03:39:32.440]  many times they have to tell us that and we were told that again this week by jay johnson yeah
[03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:37.080]  homeland security and our days of you know yeah our last letter yeah he's like hey let me remind
[03:39:37.080 --> 03:39:42.120]  you yeah yeah they're at their meeting and our police chief here you know they have this meeting
[03:39:42.120 --> 03:39:48.200]  and he's like a little mr brown those are oh oh let me remind you mr the real problem here yeah we
[03:39:48.200 --> 03:39:52.440]  know who the real people are the way after shift the narrative background well it's just like the
[03:39:52.440 --> 03:39:57.000]  the leaked dnc talking points that we are seeing with showing all the trump opposition and how they
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:01.800]  have the timeline for the talking points they're going to use to take out trump well this is sort
[03:40:01.800 --> 03:40:06.520]  of the same thing because they saw this as their opportunity for the no fly no buy and they're really
[03:40:06.520 --> 03:40:11.720]  rolling that out as the talking point even though it would not have stopped this terror attack it has
[03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:15.880]  nothing to do with what happened in orlando in fact that one of the gun shops he went to get
[03:40:15.880 --> 03:40:21.560]  bulk ammunition and body armor level three body armor they notified the fbi they did what they
[03:40:21.560 --> 03:40:27.240]  were supposed to do they said this seems fishy hey red flag red flag red flag and what happened fbi
[03:40:27.240 --> 03:40:30.920]  obviously did nothing they sat on it for one reason or another i don't know either they're
[03:40:30.920 --> 03:40:35.160]  incompetent or they did it on purpose i don't know you have a worker a fellow worker with him that
[03:40:35.160 --> 03:40:39.640]  alerted the world's largest private security firm and said hey this guy is making all kinds of
[03:40:39.640 --> 03:40:45.000]  hateful remarks about all these different groups of people he wants to kill everybody oh you know
[03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:48.360]  we're not going to do anything because he's a muslim it'd be politically incorrect to do it so
[03:40:48.360 --> 03:40:52.760]  the private security firm the state government the federal government homeland security all these
[03:40:52.760 --> 03:40:57.480]  people have had this guy in their crosshairs for the longest period of time and let him go David
[03:40:57.480 --> 03:41:02.280]  now they're going to fix it now they can fix it if they could just get the guns your guns my guns
[03:41:02.280 --> 03:41:07.160]  and your guns and everybody who who's not a government official they can get their guns
[03:41:07.160 --> 03:41:11.400]  it'll solve the problem but see the thing is we have to be worried about it's not gun control but
[03:41:11.400 --> 03:41:16.840]  it's border patrol if a terrorist comes into the country or if we import them by the tens of thousands
[03:41:16.840 --> 03:41:21.560]  like imam obama is doing okay you're gonna have a situation yeah you're gonna have a situation
[03:41:21.560 --> 03:41:27.080]  yeah that's the the headline on dredge today we got this uh middle eastern lady that was
[03:41:27.080 --> 03:41:32.520]  apprehended at the border that had a pipeline plans okay so if you're a terrorist and you come
[03:41:32.520 --> 03:41:37.000]  into this country do you really want a semi-automatic rifle or would you rather have a nuclear weapon
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:41.480]  a biological weapon a chemical weapon or maybe just blow up our infrastructure the gas infrastructure
[03:41:41.480 --> 03:41:46.600]  i mean if you let the problem is somebody who wants to create a crime like that it isn't the
[03:41:46.600 --> 03:41:51.000]  weapon okay and and that's not going to be the most lethal weapon that they get and she was
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:55.240]  someone on the ref the refugee program yeah one apprehended there you go so yeah i mean these are
[03:41:55.240 --> 03:42:01.640]  people that need our help and we're aiding them in helping to destroy this country so i did a quick
[03:42:01.640 --> 03:42:06.760]  look i just i put children on no fly list and it brought up hundreds of articles i just printed
[03:42:06.760 --> 03:42:12.360]  out a few uh the first one from in as associated press back in 2006 four-year-old turns up on
[03:42:12.360 --> 03:42:18.120]  no fly lists this is a four-year-old okay then here's mikey who they just had on there mikey's
[03:42:18.120 --> 03:42:24.840]  the boy scout mikey hicks back in 2010 the us had him on the watch list the terror watch list no
[03:42:24.840 --> 03:42:30.680]  fly list then we've got uh here's an 18 month old baby yanked from airplane for being on no
[03:42:30.680 --> 03:42:36.680]  fly list yanked from airplane like there's no there's no logic being based on what they're doing
[03:42:36.680 --> 03:42:42.040]  look at that face little terror yeah grab that pacifier take that right out of her mouth yeah tsa
[03:42:42.040 --> 03:42:46.760]  detains five-year-old because his name was on the no fly list so these are these bumbling fools
[03:42:46.760 --> 03:42:51.320]  that they're like well i don't know five-year-old your name's on the list exactly and then in 2014
[03:42:51.320 --> 03:42:56.280]  an organ judge said we got to stop this no fly list this is ridiculous and it was a you know 14
[03:42:56.280 --> 03:42:59.720]  planners came forward and said look you know we don't know how we get on we don't know how we get
[03:42:59.720 --> 03:43:05.960]  off he tried to stop it but here's still 2016 canadian six-year-old still on no fly list despite
[03:43:05.960 --> 03:43:10.680]  government's help and i did find out how you get on the no fly list check out this criteria
[03:43:10.680 --> 03:43:15.320]  okay they don't want to base it they say they don't base it on uh anything includes freedom of speech
[03:43:15.320 --> 03:43:21.560]  or exercise of religion or peaceful assembly but you can that can be superseded such as if the
[03:43:21.560 --> 03:43:25.480]  individuals expresses sympathy toward a group the u.s government considers to be a terrorist
[03:43:25.480 --> 03:43:30.680]  organization or a student of a school or university that employs professors or other staff who are
[03:43:30.680 --> 03:43:37.000]  known to espouse ideologies and beliefs the u.s deems radical oh yeah so that's how you get on
[03:43:37.000 --> 03:43:43.240]  the list anything radical that that's u.s deems and just understand that all across europe anybody
[03:43:43.240 --> 03:43:50.200]  who opposes the european union who opposes the open borders they're all called radical extremists
[03:43:50.200 --> 03:43:55.480]  yeah okay so all you have to do is just be politically opposed to open borders and the
[03:43:55.480 --> 03:43:59.240]  destruction of your sovereignty in your country and you're immediately an enemy of the state
[03:43:59.240 --> 03:44:03.800]  an enemy of the globalist state and that's what really should concern us you know we've got the
[03:44:03.800 --> 03:44:08.920]  here's an article nine out of ten people on the terror watch list who sought guns were approved
[03:44:08.920 --> 03:44:15.480]  in 2015 says cnn oh you think that might be a problem well no actually the fbi says no there's
[03:44:15.480 --> 03:44:20.600]  a reason for that and it was just fbi was just overridden by the department of justice they said
[03:44:20.600 --> 03:44:26.280]  we don't want to have the no fly list be used as a gunman the fbi said that why would they say that
[03:44:26.840 --> 03:44:31.160]  well they said we're doing an investigation with these people and we've got them on this
[03:44:31.160 --> 03:44:34.520]  list and we don't want to alert them if we're actually doing an investigation to see if this
[03:44:34.520 --> 03:44:40.200]  person is a terrorist if you they go in and try to buy a gun as it is right now we get notified
[03:44:40.200 --> 03:44:44.680]  but we don't block the gun sale because we want to do part of our investigation you're going to tip
[03:44:44.680 --> 03:44:50.440]  them off so the obama attorney general loretta lynch has now overruled the fbi director because
[03:44:50.440 --> 03:44:55.880]  he's under her and said no we're going to do it not gave it giving no explanation as to uh
[03:44:56.440 --> 03:45:00.200]  that's exactly what they did with the underwear bomber they were notified by his father and other
[03:45:00.200 --> 03:45:05.480]  people that this guy was uh being radicalized uh he was given a bomb incidentally that didn't work
[03:45:06.200 --> 03:45:11.880]  on purpose and then uh under secretary state patrick kennedy testified before congress that
[03:45:11.880 --> 03:45:17.400]  they did not block his travel visa because they wanted to see who he was working with and then
[03:45:17.400 --> 03:45:23.000]  this incident happens and they go body scanners oh we just happen to have them here and here's the
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:28.040]  former dhs head who happens to run the company that sells body scanners it's so convenient it always
[03:45:28.040 --> 03:45:31.400]  happens they say we've been watching this guy for a long time you hear that every time you heard it
[03:45:31.400 --> 03:45:36.280]  in france you heard every this is a known wolf but not a lone wolf but only but a known wolf
[03:45:36.280 --> 03:45:41.640]  they do that constantly but if it was a legitimate investigation i mean this is not even what he
[03:45:41.640 --> 03:45:46.360]  what he's saying is besides the constitution besides the principles of the constitution you
[03:45:46.360 --> 03:45:50.360]  don't even have a good pragmatic reason for doing this because if we're doing legitimate
[03:45:50.360 --> 03:45:54.920]  investigations of people who are terrorists who are criminals who are plotting something we don't
[03:45:54.920 --> 03:45:59.720]  want to alert them so even the people who buy this official government narrative should look at this
[03:45:59.720 --> 03:46:04.600]  and say this doesn't make any sense from a pragmatic standpoint forget the constitution it just doesn't
[03:46:04.600 --> 03:46:09.320]  make any good sense from an investigation but we know it's been used over and over again to allow
[03:46:09.320 --> 03:46:14.760]  these episodes to go forward because it fits their political agenda right and if we everyone's asking
[03:46:14.760 --> 03:46:20.520]  well the fbi knew about this guy why didn't they do anything the many countless times is this why
[03:46:20.520 --> 03:46:23.880]  because they were wanting to see who he was talking to where he was going and then
[03:46:24.440 --> 03:46:29.080]  you know maybe he just acted a little too quickly for them to stop them well they pulled him off
[03:46:29.080 --> 03:46:34.120]  those lists a couple years ago but they also include dead people on the no-fly list maybe
[03:46:34.120 --> 03:46:39.960]  Omar is now on the no-fly list now that he's dead retroactively on the no-fly list because
[03:46:39.960 --> 03:46:45.400]  they do that being in case people try to use assumed names so dead people children anybody and
[03:46:45.400 --> 03:46:51.400]  then we interview back in 2012 Wade Hicks who was flying around the first stories i covered yeah he
[03:46:51.400 --> 03:46:56.600]  was flying around and 34 year old mississippi resident was going to visit his wife who was a navy
[03:46:56.600 --> 03:47:03.560]  lieutenant stationed in okinawa and on his way back he got he was basically stopped in uh hawaii
[03:47:03.560 --> 03:47:06.600]  and he couldn't it was on his way there he was on his way there he never got to see her i never
[03:47:06.600 --> 03:47:10.600]  ever they detained him or why i mean you get into hawaii and they put you on a no-fly list
[03:47:10.600 --> 03:47:15.960]  he flew there on a military plane and then they transferred the planes and he's going to the
[03:47:15.960 --> 03:47:22.280]  second leg going to japan and they come on the plane as is about to take off and say you come with
[03:47:22.280 --> 03:47:26.440]  us yeah very him off said you're all yeah you're on a no-fly list you can't it was like what's
[03:47:26.440 --> 03:47:31.960]  going on this guy had been vetted by the tsa he had all kinds of licenses and privileges from them
[03:47:31.960 --> 03:47:36.840]  he'd been vetted for firearms and all these other types of things no explanation given to him and
[03:47:36.840 --> 03:47:40.600]  of course they pull you off in hawaii you're stuck if you can't fly i mean it's like how am i going
[03:47:40.600 --> 03:47:44.760]  to get out of here mind and catch up a slow freighter out of here or whatever but they kept him
[03:47:44.760 --> 03:47:48.520]  there for a couple of weeks he never got to see his wife eventually because it became a big issue
[03:47:48.520 --> 03:47:52.840]  we covered it uh the military stepped down and they and they put him out but here's the deal
[03:47:52.840 --> 03:47:57.800]  they would never tell him exactly why he was on the list they would never tell him how he could
[03:47:57.800 --> 03:48:02.040]  get off the list right whether he was still on the list still on it and we had that video right now
[03:48:02.040 --> 03:48:06.440]  so you can actually hear from his mouth back in 2012 you know what this guy had to go through
[03:48:06.440 --> 03:48:11.000]  was from our old studio this is david night vintage david night from 2012 so let's roll that video
[03:48:12.200 --> 03:48:15.640]  if you're in that type of situation you have to keep your head screwed on straight don't get emotional
[03:48:15.640 --> 03:48:22.760]  and just do whatever you know or what you think is the best thing to do and for me it was going to
[03:48:22.760 --> 03:48:27.160]  the media going to my friends because those were really the only people that were going to be able
[03:48:27.160 --> 03:48:31.720]  to help me uh the government wasn't going to do anything to help me they were just doing their
[03:48:31.720 --> 03:48:37.240]  whole bureaucratic uh nightmare stuff so i could have been there three months had i not been as
[03:48:37.240 --> 03:48:41.720]  proactive as i was trying to get this story out that's right and they still to this day have not
[03:48:41.720 --> 03:48:45.640]  given you any information as to why you were put on the list or what your current status is whether
[03:48:45.640 --> 03:48:48.840]  you're on the list or whether you're off of the list right no they've never i've asked for it in
[03:48:48.840 --> 03:48:53.160]  writing they've never given me anything in writing to say that i was on the list they never gave me
[03:48:53.160 --> 03:48:57.880]  anything that says i was off the list and it completely throws everything we know about the
[03:48:57.880 --> 03:49:03.160]  constitution and do process out the window yeah it's a very dangerous situation not just for you
[03:49:03.160 --> 03:49:07.240]  but for everybody because the government can secretly accuse somebody of something you you
[03:49:07.240 --> 03:49:12.840]  still have no idea what they thought was wrong okay and the rest of that when we come uh if you
[03:49:12.840 --> 03:49:17.160]  want to go the alex jones channel you can look that up this is an interesting quote from lindsay
[03:49:17.160 --> 03:49:22.920]  graham our favorite senator here he says we got a lot of favorites just went to bill de bergne that's
[03:49:22.920 --> 03:49:28.120]  right at bill de bergne confirm citing at the airport here's what lindsay graham says he says
[03:49:28.120 --> 03:49:34.040]  the only way you should get off the list is if they no longer believe you're a threat it should
[03:49:34.040 --> 03:49:40.280]  have nothing to do with not being able to prove a crime well nothing to do with not being able to
[03:49:40.280 --> 03:49:45.560]  prove a crime in other words as he said before shut up you don't get a lawyer and we don't have to
[03:49:45.560 --> 03:49:50.200]  prove that you're not doing a crime or however that works all these double negatives i'm confused
[03:49:50.200 --> 03:49:56.440]  lindsay how does this work yeah it's just pure i mean this this is tyranny this is this is something
[03:49:56.440 --> 03:50:00.600]  we should all be very concerned about because it's all done in secret and this is one of those
[03:50:00.600 --> 03:50:05.160]  problems it's not right out in the open so unless it's affecting you most people i won't even care
[03:50:05.160 --> 03:50:08.600]  about this no fly list because they're not being affected by it right but you're gonna be a no dry
[03:50:08.600 --> 03:50:13.640]  live a driver and there'll be a no working they're completing the no fly list with the terror
[03:50:13.640 --> 03:50:18.200]  watch list so people that don't really understand the difference between the two are just automatically
[03:50:18.200 --> 03:50:22.760]  assuming it means you're a terrorist and not understanding that children are being put on
[03:50:22.760 --> 03:50:28.360]  this list and and you're being you know sequestered by people like tsa agents who really have no idea
[03:50:28.360 --> 03:50:34.600]  what the law is anyway and could care less i had them when i was going to dresden they were saying
[03:50:34.600 --> 03:50:38.200]  you know telling me that the reason we have these body skinners for the underwear bomber i'm like
[03:50:38.200 --> 03:50:42.360]  it's all fake man it's all fake it's all theater i don't know what more to tell you expose that yeah
[03:50:42.360 --> 03:50:46.040]  it's totally ridiculous but they don't stop all right i'm david night we're gonna be right back

[03:54:04.840 --> 03:54:32.840]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night with rob do and leon macadoo we've been talking about the watch list watch out because you may be on that list you wouldn't know if they put you on the list because they're they do it in secret you know member of the constitution member of the sixth amendment
[03:54:32.840 --> 03:54:46.840]  it says you will be given the opportunity to confront your accusers you'll be able to have a public and speedy trial where you'll get a trial by jury you'll have a right to a defense attorney so forth and so on why did they do that
[03:54:46.840 --> 03:54:54.840]  well they did that as you all know because there was a star chamber in england where people they would meet secretly and they would indict people and
[03:54:54.840 --> 03:55:07.840]  list away in the night yeah exactly you disappear tonight so now we are bringing this back this is the hallmark of tyranny this is pre crime this is france kafka's bureaucracy where you can't get an answer it's like wait a minute you can't do this or that
[03:55:07.840 --> 03:55:22.840]  well i'm on a list what list how did i get on the list what am i charged with how do i get off the list i don't know that's the kafka aspect of it it is outright tyranny and i think really the roots of this if we want to know where this is coming from it goes back to the war on drugs it goes on
[03:55:22.840 --> 03:55:32.840]  it goes on to civil asset forfeiture because what they're saying to you is that they don't have to give you due process because they're only putting you on a watch list and then they're using that watch list to give you punishments they're
[03:55:32.840 --> 03:55:42.840]  saying we haven't convicted you of a crime we're not accusing you of any crime we're just putting you on a list and put you in jail yet yeah exactly you just can't fly can't get a job yeah you have been accused of crime and they've
[03:55:42.840 --> 03:55:55.840]  used the same legal fiction throughout the war on drugs to say we're going to take your property we're not going to charge you with anything we're just going to take your plane or your house or your car because we think that your plane or your house
[03:55:55.840 --> 03:56:06.840]  or your car was possibly and tangentially involved in this crime we're not going to charge you with anything and it's not a criminal action it's a civil action and we're just going to call it a forfeiture not a taking we're
[03:56:06.840 --> 03:56:17.840]  not going to say it's a fine a penalty it's a forfeiture you wanted to forfeiture that right and it's a civil action so that means that if you want to clear your if you want to get your property back you have to sue them they're
[03:56:17.840 --> 03:56:26.840]  not going to provide you with a lawyer you will have to provide the capital to sue them to get your property back that they may have unlimited money yes your money
[03:56:26.840 --> 03:56:40.840]  to fight that and they usually win interestingly enough we just had a case come up here in the state of texas june 10th we have the supreme court here in texas say no illegal searches are okay and can be used for asset forfeiture cases so an
[03:56:40.840 --> 03:56:53.840]  illegal search would throw them out of a criminal conviction but they could do an illegal search and still take your property like this car they said no I think that it would punish the law enforcement too much we already punished law enforcement by not letting them get a
[03:56:53.840 --> 03:57:02.840]  conviction this is what the supreme court here in texas said we're already punishing law enforcement by denying their convictions so we don't want to punish them by taking away the stuff they're stealing from you
[03:57:02.840 --> 03:57:12.840]  it's like what about the punishment of the people right we're always last on the list yeah which is why we just saw this article and we talked about this is something we talked about years ago
[03:57:12.840 --> 03:57:26.840]  beds quietly consider reviving EPA's human testing program this is where they put people in a room and literally turn on diesel engines and run fumes yeah they hook up the tailpipe and they run it right into a room and you sit and breathe it and they go we're going to see how you
[03:57:26.840 --> 03:57:38.840]  react that does mess up your brain and what's even worse about that Rob was they were selecting and and screening for people who already had respiratory issues and art issues because they wanted to show a an effect dramatic
[03:57:38.840 --> 03:57:47.840]  effect yeah we had Lisa Jackson who was head of the EPA at the time had testified before Congress she said no these fine particular matter levels that we're talking about we're not just talking about making people sick we're talking
[03:57:47.840 --> 03:58:03.840]  about death and then they expose people to 70 times that level so they can ratchet up the regulations and so it's like this catch 22 is like well you lying to us in Congress or are you deliberately doing some kind of Joseph Mengele experiment on people
[03:58:03.840 --> 03:58:14.840]  and if you look at the weather modification laws that they have written they can do all this as long as it's in a testing phase so they could test on us all day long as long as they say we're just testing yeah we're just testing on it
[03:58:14.840 --> 03:58:25.840]  just running some tests oh yeah what's falling from the sky well it's just a test this is a test if this were a real genocide you would be dead by now but stay tuned for the reason we're going to slow kill you because we want your tax money
[03:58:25.840 --> 03:58:37.840]  so wake up out there wake up that's right David Knight Rob do and Leigh Ann McAdoo and join us tonight for the info wars nightly new at 7 central 8pm eastern not jacari jackson be there for them yeah
