[00:00.000 --> 00:27.420]  Ah, thought crime, the Alex Jones show, because there is a war on for your mind, on this Christmas
[00:27.420 --> 00:36.040]  broadcast. And that's why they want to bring down the basic icons of Christmas, which is
[00:36.040 --> 00:42.560]  even bigger than, quote, Christianity. And by that I mean not more important or not truly
[00:42.560 --> 00:48.800]  overshadowing Christ, but politically and socially it is. When John Lennon said we're
[00:48.800 --> 00:54.600]  bigger than Jesus, it was an arrogant statement he later apologized for. As he tried to lose
[00:54.600 --> 00:59.920]  his ego and come back down to earth and speak out against those that wanted to reduce world
[00:59.920 --> 01:05.200]  population as fascist, because he'd been led into the higher levels of the New World Order
[01:05.200 --> 01:11.800]  and rejected it. But my point is, is that in the secular world Christmas is bigger than
[01:11.800 --> 01:17.520]  just Christianity. But because it has its roots in Christianity and the birth of baby Jesus
[01:17.520 --> 01:26.240]  2000 plus years ago in Israel today, the system wants to censor it and shut it down. Because
[01:26.240 --> 01:34.680]  if they can do that, they can get away with anything. If they can feed us super bug, bacteria
[01:34.680 --> 01:40.320]  infected chicken and have the federal government certify it, that's the Reuters headline, then
[01:40.320 --> 01:44.720]  they can get away with anything. If they can give us flu via the flu shots and put sodium
[01:44.720 --> 01:49.120]  fluoride to brain damages in the water, the sky's the limit. Why they can pass Obamacare
[01:49.120 --> 01:53.000]  written to double and triple and quadruple your rates, written to cut the quality of
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.320]  care, written to set up death panels all on record, and they denied it. Knowing their
[01:58.320 --> 02:06.040]  idiot constituents like lambs to the slaughter would not go research the information, knowing
[02:06.040 --> 02:14.600]  that they would instead simply go along with it until it was too late. And then even after
[02:14.600 --> 02:19.000]  they found that it was a screw job, they would just submit to it in the system, the war machine,
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.600]  the deindustrialization machine, the consolidation machine would simply roll forward.
[02:25.600 --> 02:32.560]  Well the good news is humanity is awakening and you're listening to an original worldwide
[02:32.560 --> 02:42.400]  transmission on the 24th day of December 2013. And I'll be popping in throughout the transmission
[02:42.400 --> 02:50.280]  with original recording that I made on what, Friday the 20th day of December 2013. So even
[02:50.280 --> 02:56.680]  though this fresh original recording for you, the great people that would tune in on Christmas
[02:56.680 --> 03:05.080]  Eve is not live, what is live? Most of my broadcasts are live, but soon it'll be 2014,
[03:05.080 --> 03:18.720]  then 2015, then 2027, and then 2058, and then 2198, and then 2274, and then 2023, and then
[03:18.720 --> 03:25.560]  on and on until it's the year 3000, 5000, 10,000, if humanity survives and moves forward.
[03:25.560 --> 03:29.360]  Because time really is relative, isn't it? We're all basically in the past, the present,
[03:29.360 --> 03:33.880]  and the future. We're all part of creation, all part of reality. And it's important to
[03:33.880 --> 03:40.680]  remember the universe and the individual mind is bigger than all the bureaucrats and all
[03:40.680 --> 03:46.840]  the sandcastles they build that will crumble into the sea eventually to quote the great
[03:46.840 --> 03:52.560]  Jimi Hendrix, the great poet Jimi Hendrix. And off in the distance, the Wildcats were
[03:52.560 --> 04:01.680]  approaching and they heard the Wildcats how? Because the riders were approaching to paraphrase
[04:01.680 --> 04:08.680]  and butcher Jimi Hendrix. Because it is teleprompter, talking point free radio, TV, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:08.680 --> 04:16.400]  Alright, when we come back, we are going to have an original premiere here of InfoWars
[04:16.400 --> 04:24.560]  Review of It's a Wonderful Life with Jimi Stewart, with our own David Knight. So that
[04:24.560 --> 04:29.920]  is coming up and then, oh I forgot it, well you guys bring me my print off of the text
[04:29.920 --> 04:35.520]  of, it was the night before Christmas when all through the house, not a creature was
[04:35.520 --> 04:42.760]  stirring, not even a genetically engineered mouse. So that is coming up as well and then
[04:42.760 --> 04:46.360]  we've got some big interviews the last month or so that we're going to be re-hearing as
[04:46.360 --> 04:49.880]  well. Want to commend the great crew for coming in to get all this done as well and
[04:49.880 --> 04:54.840]  of course you the listeners, spending time with us on Christmas. Merry Christmas to all
[04:54.840 --> 05:02.080]  of you.
[05:02.080 --> 05:06.080]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[05:06.080 --> 05:11.200]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for
[05:11.200 --> 05:15.840]  more than a decade. My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico
[05:15.840 --> 05:20.480]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans. We have now managed
[05:20.480 --> 05:26.480]  to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of
[05:26.480 --> 05:33.840]  the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com. This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick
[05:33.840 --> 05:37.680]  me up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give
[05:37.680 --> 05:42.880]  me personally. Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[05:42.880 --> 05:48.160]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers. Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I
[05:48.160 --> 05:52.240]  don't think you're going to be disappointed. Available in original or with our immune support
[05:52.240 --> 05:57.280]  infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great
[05:57.280 --> 06:03.440]  tasting cup of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com. In the last 50 years,
[06:03.440 --> 06:09.720]  iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice
[06:09.720 --> 06:15.720]  now banned in nations around the world. Guess what else is in the halogen family? Fluoride.
[06:15.720 --> 06:20.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here. In 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[06:20.760 --> 06:27.000]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine. It's the good halogen on the periodic table
[06:27.000 --> 06:33.960]  and the results are on record, reports documented, a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had previously
[06:33.960 --> 06:40.120]  been deficient in iodine. Bottom line, iodine is important. Unbound, clean, in a glycerin
[06:40.120 --> 06:45.600]  base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family. You will find survival shield
[06:45.600 --> 06:52.840]  nascent iodine exclusively at infowarslife.com. Info wars life, survival shield nascent iodine

[08:02.640 --> 08:15.280]  This is thought crime. He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose
[08:15.280 --> 08:27.040]  a song. You're listening to Alex Jones. This is heresy. The government is God. State
[08:27.040 --> 08:38.080]  to the bureaucrats that run under King. Christ. Call the FCC. You're not allowed to speak
[08:38.080 --> 08:46.560]  nasty dirty words that sting in the ears of our beloved Lord and Savior Satan. Pull down
[08:46.560 --> 08:51.720]  the Christmas trees. Destroy the churches. Have al-Qaeda spread throughout the world.
[08:51.720 --> 08:57.560]  Just Syria and take on our enemies. This satanic broadcast brought to you by Barack
[08:57.560 --> 09:03.920]  H. Obama and trendy loving liberalness. No, ladies and gentlemen, it's actually brought
[09:03.920 --> 09:08.680]  to you by the info war and only a satanic pig like government would try to restrict
[09:08.680 --> 09:16.200]  free speech and attack Christianity. But why is the system always after Christians? Why
[09:16.200 --> 09:23.760]  is that happening? Why is that going on? It's because the tyrants fear liberty and if they
[09:23.760 --> 09:29.120]  can pull down the icons of our culture, they can replace it with anything and any conquered
[09:29.120 --> 09:35.700]  people have their religion destroyed and overwritten by the usurpers. And so we are here speaking
[09:35.700 --> 09:41.000]  out against this today. Again, it is the night before Christmas and I'm going to give you
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.600]  my rendition of the night before Christmas literally unscripted. I'm just going to read
[09:44.600 --> 09:50.320]  it and then make my little comments on it as we go. But first we have a review by the
[09:50.320 --> 09:57.160]  great David Knight of info wars nightly news of it's a wonderful life with Jimmy Stewart.
[09:57.160 --> 10:02.320]  And so he's going to parallel this Christmas time special about the banksters, the gangsters
[10:02.320 --> 10:07.000]  aka the 100 year anniversary of the Federal Reserve that just passed yesterday and their
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.400]  occupational rule over us. And then we're going to come back and I'll give you my night before
[10:12.400 --> 10:18.200]  Christmas right off the top. And this is going to be a regional, you know, I do it. And so
[10:18.200 --> 10:24.200]  that's coming up as well. Thank you for joining us on this Christmas Eve. Here is David Knight
[10:24.200 --> 10:28.040]  and his review of the great Christmas time special. If you haven't seen it, I suggest
[10:28.040 --> 10:35.120]  you watch it. It's a wonderful life over the last 100 years, the Federal Reserve has created
[10:35.120 --> 10:39.960]  bubbles and burst them, enslaved us with debt and destroyed our purchasing power through
[10:39.960 --> 10:46.400]  inflation. Yes, it's been a wonderful lie for the bankers. There are striking parallels
[10:46.400 --> 10:51.080]  in Frank Capper is it's a wonderful life to the lies and tricks that real bankers use
[10:51.080 --> 10:56.960]  to create the Federal Reserve. Human nature doesn't change. And the greedy elite of 1913
[10:56.960 --> 11:02.840]  and 2013 look and act a lot like Potter, the banker in the movie. And many Americans are
[11:02.840 --> 11:08.320]  left like George Bailey staring into the abyss as their dreams collapse and they face financial
[11:08.320 --> 11:12.760]  ruin. Do we live in a country that looks a lot more like Pottersville than Bedford Falls?
[11:12.760 --> 11:17.880]  What does Frank Capper's film show us about how we got here and how we can get out? When
[11:17.880 --> 11:22.480]  the Federal Reserve was created two days before Christmas 100 years ago, it was a culmination
[11:22.480 --> 11:27.800]  of six years of fraud, fear and manipulation. I've never really seen one, but that's got
[11:27.800 --> 11:33.720]  all the air marks of being a run. The panic of 1907 was used to shape public support for
[11:33.720 --> 11:37.600]  the Fed. The panic was triggered by rumors that two major banks were about to become
[11:37.600 --> 11:43.160]  insolvent just as we see in the movie. George, there is a rumor around town that you close
[11:43.160 --> 11:51.000]  your doors. Is that true? I am going all out to help in this crisis. I have just guaranteed
[11:51.000 --> 11:59.120]  the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs. They will close up for a week and then reopen.
[11:59.120 --> 12:05.640]  Just took over the bank. I may lose a fortune, but I am willing to guarantee your people
[12:05.640 --> 12:11.760]  too. Just tell them to bring their shares over here and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.
[12:11.760 --> 12:16.360]  Oh, you never miss a trick, do you Potter? Unfortunately, J.P. Morgan got away with
[12:16.360 --> 12:21.520]  a deception and was able to shut down competitors and snapped up assets at fire cell prices.
[12:21.520 --> 12:26.840]  Now, take during the Depression, for instance. You and I were the only ones that kept our
[12:26.840 --> 12:33.160]  heads. You saved the building and lawn. I saved all the rest. Yes, well, most people
[12:33.160 --> 12:38.640]  say you stole all the rest. The envious ones say they're George the suckers. Charles Lindberg
[12:38.640 --> 12:42.920]  Sr. warned people at the time of the creation of the Federal Reserve that it would not stop
[12:42.920 --> 12:47.680]  boom and bust cycles, but would actually create them in order to benefit its private owners.
[12:47.680 --> 12:51.720]  Here's what he said, to cause high prices all the Federal Reserve Board will do will
[12:51.720 --> 12:56.280]  be to lower the re-discount rate, producing an expansion of credit and a rising stock
[12:56.280 --> 13:00.360]  market. Then, when businessmen are adjusted to these conditions, it can check prosperity
[13:00.360 --> 13:04.440]  and mid-career by arbitrarily raising the rate of interest. It can cause a pendulum
[13:04.440 --> 13:09.560]  of rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth, or cause violent fluctuations
[13:09.560 --> 13:14.880]  by a greater rate variation. And in either case, it will possess inside information as
[13:14.880 --> 13:20.000]  to the financial conditions and advanced knowledge of the coming change, either up or down. This
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.520]  is the strangest, most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privileged
[13:24.520 --> 13:29.720]  class by any government that ever existed. The system is private, conducted for the sole
[13:29.720 --> 13:33.880]  purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other people's money.
[13:33.880 --> 13:37.520]  They know in advance when to create panics to their advantage, and they know when to
[13:37.520 --> 13:44.360]  stop panic. Inflation and deflation work equally well for them when they control the finance.
[13:44.360 --> 13:48.600]  As we see in the movie, not all lending institutions have the same motivations.
[13:48.600 --> 13:55.640]  Now, you take this one here, the Ernie Bishop, you know, the fellow that sits around all
[13:55.640 --> 14:02.760]  day on his brain in his taxi, you know. I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but
[14:02.760 --> 14:08.240]  he comes here, and we're building him a house worth $5,000.
[14:08.240 --> 14:09.240]  Why?
[14:09.240 --> 14:15.000]  Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there, his salary, insurance.
[14:15.000 --> 14:16.720]  I can personally vouch for his character.
[14:16.720 --> 14:17.720]  Friend of yours?
[14:17.720 --> 14:18.720]  Yes, sir.
[14:18.720 --> 14:25.120]  You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money.
[14:25.120 --> 14:32.840]  What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class.
[14:32.840 --> 14:37.120]  As a former FDIC chair said, all too often the large banks use their models and their
[14:37.120 --> 14:41.320]  algorithms, and if you don't fit in their boxes, you don't get the loan. And Dodd-Frank
[14:41.320 --> 14:46.160]  legislation is tying the hands of small lenders, shutting out buyers and shutting down lenders.
[14:46.160 --> 14:50.000]  Today, there are fewer lenders than at any time the government has kept records. Ten
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.120]  thousand banks disappeared between 1984 and 2011.
[14:54.120 --> 14:58.880]  This town needs this measly one-horse institution, if only to have some place where people can
[14:58.880 --> 15:01.000]  come without crawling to Potter.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  Come on.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.520]  In the movie, George gets to see what happens to the small town if Potter didn't have competition
[15:06.520 --> 15:08.520]  from credit unions and smaller lenders.
[15:08.520 --> 15:10.120]  If it hadn't been for you...
[15:10.120 --> 15:13.720]  Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody would be a lot better off. My wife and my
[15:13.720 --> 15:18.440]  kids and my friends and my... Look, little fella, go out and haunt somebody else.
[15:18.440 --> 15:24.440]  Yeah, so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh?
[15:24.440 --> 15:30.640]  Well, I don't know. I guess you're right. It's both been better if I'd never been born
[15:30.640 --> 15:31.640]  at all.
[15:31.640 --> 15:37.480]  The only businesses thriving are vice. People are angry. The town is filled with signs like
[15:37.480 --> 15:42.240]  keep moving, keep off the grass. Bert the cop actually shoots at George when he's running
[15:42.240 --> 15:45.240]  away and is no threat to anyone.
[15:45.240 --> 15:50.240]  Stand back!
[15:50.240 --> 15:54.240]  Potter'sville? Everyone is a renter? No one has a stake.
[15:54.240 --> 15:57.240]  Now you're an Arnie Bishop and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid.
[15:57.240 --> 16:01.240]  Look, Bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter'sville. My wife ran away three years
[16:01.240 --> 16:04.240]  ago and took the kid and I ain't never seen you before in my life, see?
[16:04.240 --> 16:09.240]  Private property and everyone having a stake is the antidote to Potter'sville.
[16:09.240 --> 16:12.640]  You're all businessmen here. Don't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them
[16:12.640 --> 16:13.640]  better customers?
[16:13.640 --> 16:18.640]  But whether it's the Trans-Pacific Partnership or a global carbon tax, the global elite don't
[16:18.640 --> 16:23.640]  see you as a stakeholder. They want to turn us all into serfs and treat us like cattle.
[16:23.640 --> 16:28.140]  Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about, they do most
[16:28.140 --> 16:32.640]  of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to
[16:32.640 --> 16:36.640]  have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway,
[16:36.640 --> 16:42.640]  my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated
[16:42.640 --> 16:46.640]  man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.
[16:46.640 --> 16:50.640]  I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the building alone.
[16:50.640 --> 16:54.640]  I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get
[16:54.640 --> 16:55.640]  your fingers on.
[16:55.640 --> 16:59.640]  Speaking of riches, do you find the salary amounts amusing when Potter tries to buy
[16:59.640 --> 17:00.640]  George off?
[17:00.640 --> 17:10.640]  Let's look at your size. Young man, 27, 28, married, make me say 40 a week.
[17:10.640 --> 17:20.640]  45. George, I'll start you out at $20,000 a year.
[17:20.640 --> 17:29.640]  $20,000 a year. You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife
[17:29.640 --> 17:35.640]  a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while
[17:35.640 --> 17:38.640]  Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, John?
[17:38.640 --> 17:39.640]  Would I?
[17:39.640 --> 17:44.640]  And if George had saved a lot of his $20,000 salary, would it have bought much a couple
[17:44.640 --> 17:48.640]  of decades later? By even the government's very conservative estimate of inflation,
[17:48.640 --> 17:54.640]  the dollar has lost 90% of its value since 1947 when the movie was made.
[17:54.640 --> 17:58.640]  The Fed's deliberate inflation is devastating to anyone trying to accumulate wealth through
[17:58.640 --> 18:00.640]  hard work and saving.
[18:00.640 --> 18:04.640]  So what is the answer to all the George Baillies out there 100 years after the government
[18:04.640 --> 18:08.640]  gave control of our money supply to private bankers like Potter?
[18:08.640 --> 18:13.640]  Potter had more money than he could spend, but would any of you want to be Potter?
[18:13.640 --> 18:17.640]  You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves
[18:17.640 --> 18:22.640]  around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter. In the whole vast configuration
[18:22.640 --> 18:26.640]  of things, I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider.
[18:26.640 --> 18:31.640]  George Baillie finally sees how rich his own life is as he sees the fruits of relationship,
[18:31.640 --> 18:34.640]  honesty, and compassion.
[18:34.640 --> 18:41.640]  Hey! Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter! Happy New Year to you! In jail! Going home, they're waiting
[18:41.640 --> 18:43.640]  for you.
[18:43.640 --> 18:48.640]  And if the public can awaken to the lies of the Federal Reserve, if it could even be audited...
[18:48.640 --> 18:51.640]  Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner! How are...
[18:51.640 --> 18:55.640]  It would be a huge step to breaking the chains that enslave all of us, but ultimately it is
[18:55.640 --> 19:01.640]  God that changes minds and changes hearts. God hates oppression, and we can and should
[19:01.640 --> 19:04.640]  confidently pray that He will stop it.
[19:04.640 --> 19:09.640]  I owe everything to George Baillie. Help him, dear Father.
[19:09.640 --> 19:15.640]  Joseph, Jesus, and Mary, help my friend, Mr. Baillie.
[19:15.640 --> 19:19.640]  Help my son, George, tonight?
[19:19.640 --> 19:22.640]  He never thinks about himself, God. That's why he's in trouble.
[19:22.640 --> 19:27.640]  George is a good guy. Give him a break, God.
[19:27.640 --> 19:31.640]  I love him, dear Lord. Watch over him tonight.
[19:31.640 --> 19:38.640]  Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy. Please, been Daddy there.
[19:38.640 --> 19:43.640]  Dear Father and Heaven...
[19:43.640 --> 19:52.640]  I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way.
[19:52.640 --> 19:58.640]  Richard, you have the word, my brother.
[19:58.640 --> 20:01.640]  With sinful wars, nightly news, I'm David Knight.
[20:01.640 --> 20:05.640]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread Liberty worldwide,
[20:05.640 --> 20:08.640]  while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting
[20:08.640 --> 20:11.640]  100% organic coffee on the planet.
[20:11.640 --> 20:15.640]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[20:15.640 --> 20:19.640]  where the tiapas farmers grow their unique, shade-grown arabica beans.
[20:19.640 --> 20:24.640]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[20:24.640 --> 20:31.640]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at infowarslife.com.
[20:31.640 --> 20:36.640]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[20:36.640 --> 20:38.640]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[20:38.640 --> 20:40.640]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[20:40.640 --> 20:45.640]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[20:45.640 --> 20:49.640]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[20:49.640 --> 20:53.640]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[20:53.640 --> 20:55.640]  You will be supporting a free press.
[20:55.640 --> 20:59.640]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[20:59.640 --> 21:02.640]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[21:02.640 --> 21:05.640]  There's a reason why the U.S. government is conducting emergency drills
[21:05.640 --> 21:08.640]  simulating the collapse of the U.S. electrical grid.
[21:08.640 --> 21:11.640]  Northeast Corridor, offline. They're getting prepared.
[21:11.640 --> 21:13.640]  Will you be prepared when it shuts down?
[21:13.640 --> 21:15.640]  A massive power outage.
[21:15.640 --> 21:20.640]  The cyber pearl harp of the evacuation procedures are working.
[21:20.640 --> 21:24.640]  The grid eraser and grid eraser Maximus portable solar generators.

[21:33.640 --> 21:36.640]  Double the size and output, but not double the price.
[21:36.640 --> 21:38.640]  Oh yeah, one more thing.

[21:58.640 --> 22:19.640]  Solar generators with an attitude.
[22:29.640 --> 22:34.640]  Pro-EM1 probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome,
[22:34.640 --> 22:40.640]  constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes, the common cold, and much more.

[22:44.640 --> 22:48.640]  Put you back in control and prevent you from becoming a mindless zombie

[01:21:32.640 --> 01:22:01.640]  What are the basic facts about terrorism?
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:30.640]  What are the basic facts about terrorism?
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:59.640]  What are the basic facts about terrorism?
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:01.640]  The facts are in.
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:02.640]  The studies are legion.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:10.640]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:14.640]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.640]  Simple.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:19.640]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:25.640]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:31.640]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLife fluoride shield formulation,
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:39.640]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body,
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.640]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:46.640]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:48.640]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:54.640]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at infowarslife.com today.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.640]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWars at the same time.
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:25.640]  That's infowarslife.com.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:32.640]  And this is all just used for a giant power grab while the government runs the real radical Muslims and other groups.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:37.640]  Going back to Stefan Malinou, philosopher, researcher, radio talk show host, all around it.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.640]  Interesting guy.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.640]  There's only a six-minute segment.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:42.640]  Some of your call is coming up at the start of the next segment.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:51.640]  But looking at all this other news, as the public gets more unlogical, as the public gets more dumbed down,
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:25:00.640]  or as one segment of it does, we see a shifting by President Obama and the establishment towards propaganda and entertainment.
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:03.640]  And they admit this and not even having news anymore.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:11.640]  Just getting rid of dinosaur press, attacking alternative media, which is the only media that's left, CNN, MSNBC,
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:22.640]  it's time to leave news entirely and then just implant their messages and sitcom dramas and have Hollywood stars promote Obamacare saying it'll lower your prices when it actually increases them.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:26.640]  So it's really a war on reality by the establishment.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:31.640]  And more and more I realize they're engaged in a conscious war against common sense.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.640]  A, do you agree with that?
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:39.640]  And B, how do we counter it where there's a large minority of us who aren't perfect, but we know fraud when we see it.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.640]  And we know that free market and liberty works a lot better than collectivist tyranny.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.640]  How do we reach out to the zombie-fied folks?
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:57.640]  Because I know smart people that when they see a celebrity on TV start drooling and getting excited and would flip their throat if the celebrity came down from heaven and talked to them,
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:59.640]  if the celebrity told them to.
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:02.640]  How do you get them out of this programming?
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:12.640]  Well, of course, the first fraud we need to talk about is the fact that the current pimp for Obamacare is Adam Levine, the singer, who was named Sexiest Man of Life,
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.640]  as if they've never seen you in a thong, Alex.
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:21.640]  I mean, that's the first fraud that you have not made the cover of people in something incredibly skimpy.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:24.640]  So once we can crack through the matrix in that standpoint.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:28.640]  But what I say to people about Obamacare, it gives very two very sort of brief points.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.640]  The first, of course, is that it's completely illegal.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:36.640]  The reason, of course, is that the executive in the United States, the president, has no power to pass laws.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.640]  He has no power to pass laws.
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.640]  Only Congress has that power.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:50.640]  Now, they have written 30 times more regulations into Obamacare since it was originally passed with no input from Congress whatsoever.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:57.640]  So 30 times, even if we accept that Congress got the first law right when nobody read it and they lied about it anyway,
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:02.640]  30 times the amount of law has been written since it with no feedback or no input from Congress.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.640]  That makes the laws automatically invalid and they keep changing the rules all the time with no input from Congress.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.640]  This is a government by fiat, this is fascistic in its essence.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:17.640]  The second thing is that over 1300 organizations have been granted exemptions from Obamacare,
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:21.640]  including all of the unions and the public sector unions who were behind it to begin with.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.640]  They're all now begging to be let out of this little hamster cage from hell.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.640]  And so the reality is that in the Constitution, very clearly spells out,
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:35.640]  you must have equal treatment under the law the moment you pass a law amended afterwards with no input from Congress.
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:41.640]  And then you exempt 1300 of your closest friends and closest friends organizations from the application of the law.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:45.640]  Invalid, game over, no need for further debate or discussion.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.640]  But of course, the media doesn't tell anyone this basic stuff.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:49.640]  Exactly.
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:58.640]  And, you know, for me, I know I Oprah Winfrey and MSNBC push racism all day because in my life and in growing up when I see it really is getting a lot better.
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.640]  I mean, everybody's just coming together basically.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:03.640]  That's what I see in Austin, Texas and all over the country.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:12.640]  I see it all over the world and but they got to keep it going because the real discrimination is that all these special interest groups coupled with government are exempt
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.640]  and basically have diplomatic immunity from everything they're foisting on us.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.640]  It's a unified system. That's the real discrimination.
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:28.640]  And the real global civil rights movement is about not letting government corporations be exempt from laws they pass their law before.
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:34.640]  Yeah, I mean, white Western culture is really pretty good at fighting authority.
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:44.640]  You know, all the way from the ancient Greeks who were the first to come up with democracy and philosophy all the way through the Romans who tried their very best to limit the power of the state.
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:52.640]  It broke through the bonds of what they called the Constitution at the time just as the American government does all the way through all the struggles that went on to limit aristocratic power.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:59.640]  The ending of the aristocracy throughout most of Europe, the fencing in England during the glorious revolution that we've been pretty good.
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.640]  And I say we very loosely here.
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:05.640]  But sort of white Western culture has been pretty good at trying to fight centralized and coercive authority.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:15.640]  White Western culture has been was not just at the forefront, but was the sole cultural force that worked and spent blood and treasure worldwide to end the worldwide practice of slavery.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:22.640]  Now we've stumbled and we've created all kinds of messes, but we are as a culture really quite good at trying to fight centralized coercive power.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:33.640]  And then of course, even though our ancestors for one of a better phrase worked really hard to end the worldwide practice of slavery, generally only white racism is ever talked about, which historically is not exactly accurate.
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:36.640]  That's where I want to go next is look at lots of other groups first.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:42.640]  Yeah, I want you to come back and give me the floor on Mandela and that because I've studied history and I know slavery was worldwide.
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:48.640]  But then in the history books were taught slavery is a white invention and that whites inherently are the devil.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.640]  And why is that?
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.640]  Well, because it's the Western culture.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:55.640]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:04.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network, the facts are in the studies are legion.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:12.640]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:15.640]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:21.640]  Simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:26.640]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.

[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:07.640]  My friends Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:15.640]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the northern hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:18.640]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.640]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:25.640]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:28.640]  Looking to protect my family I've done deep research.
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:34.640]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:37.640]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:44.640]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine exclusively available
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:46.640]  at infowarslife.com.
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:52.640]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.640]  Survival shield nascent iodine.

[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:43.640]  I am your host, Alex Jones. If I'm not new as our guest, your calls are coming up here about five, six minutes from now.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:47.640]  I'll be back. Lord willing. Good luck. Willing as well.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:52.640]  I'll be back this Sunday, four to six p.m. Central Live with the Sunday Transmission.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:58.640]  Don't forget info wars nightly news and that makes a great Christmas gift and it supports the broadcast.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:03.640]  We're launching the whole news division over there the last two years and we really are up in our game.
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:08.640]  The new studio is about to be up and ready at cable systems and stuff we're going to be on early next year.
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:15.640]  We need folks to use prisonplanet.tv infowarsnews.com for what it was designed for.
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:22.640]  Eleven people can use your membership username passcode. Just make sure it's not the same username passcode as your bank account.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:30.640]  You know, create an original username passcode and you can probably give 20 friends and family an e-card saying here's your gift.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:38.640]  This is subscription, live news, tape news, broadcast, 18 years of data on there, but up 11 years of the site itself.
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:45.640]  The nightly news, the daytime show, which is free to everybody on infowars.com, but it's in the higher quality there.
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:54.640]  The nightly news is subscription for folks, all the films, all my documentaries, so many other documentaries, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:35:01.640]  And if you are a member already, you can get five months off the yearly rate when you sign up in the month of December.
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.640]  That special, of course, is going to end in the new year.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:09.640]  Five plus months comes into like 5.3 months free when you pay for 6.7 months if you want to get technical.
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:16.640]  You can do that special for $39.95 a year instead of $54.95 because there's already a couple month discount when you sign up for a year.
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:27.640]  Well, it's even more that we add on then, so it comes out to 5.3 months free versus if you just get it months to months at $5.95.
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:37.640]  Or get a monthly membership for $5.95 and then 11 friends and family can simultaneously log in at, say, 7 o'clock at night and watch infowars nightly news.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:46.640]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, you are supporting and voting with your dollars the very tip of the spear of true non-state-run media.
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:52.640]  And the White House-run media matters who brags their White House run, who write the talking points for CNN and MSNBC.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:55.640]  They are declaring war now on the alternative media.
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:05.640]  They realize the dinosaur media, you know, Fox News, God love them, is, you know, mainly targeting people that are geriatric and are phasing out of this plane of consciousness.
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:15.640]  And so what they're really targeting is the internet, but they're targeting is info wars and drudge and world end daily and anybody else who isn't a total communist.
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.640]  So very, very, very, very important.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.640]  That story is up on infowars.com.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:24.640]  Now, Stefan, I want to get into the media wars.
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:34.640]  I think the genies out of the bottle, no matter what they try, they're not going to succeed, but we have Syspa and Sopa and all these other partnerships and attempts to censor the press using fake copyright.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:38.640]  I want your take on the media wars that are coming where you think that's going.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.640]  But first, Mandela.
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:45.640]  I've studied a lot about South Africa, and it seems to me they traded one evil out for another.
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:49.640]  And I saw your video you did on it last week and thought it was spot on.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:51.640]  And you were starting to allude to it.
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:59.640]  Now, if you really study history, everyone basically had a caste system or what you call slavery from India to China to Japan.
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:04.640]  If Samurai had a new sword, wanted to test it out, they'd go chop a villager up.
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:05.640]  That was their divine right.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:06.640]  Wanted to have sex with you.
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.640]  You had to roll over and let them.
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:10.640]  And they were kind of a more cultured group of tyranny, you could say.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:11.640]  I'm not knocking.
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:12.640]  Japanese culture.
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.640]  Every culture had slaves.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.640]  Romans had white slaves, had black slaves, you name it.
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:19.640]  Some Greek societies have what you call slaves.
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:21.640]  Others didn't and went fight with them over it.
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:27.640]  There were riots 500 years ago in the transatlantic slave trade because they phased out some white slavery in Europe.
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:31.640]  They went on to grabbing blacks, which they picked up from the Arabs.
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:33.640]  Not demonizing Arabs is just a fact.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.640]  The Arabs are still running slavery in North Africa, but that's trendy and cool.
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:38.640]  We're told it's a different type of slavery.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.640]  All I hear all day is I'm bad.
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:41.640]  Western culture is bad.
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:43.640]  And Western culture is dying.
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:45.640]  And the Western elite are helping kill it.
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:46.640]  Why are they doing that?
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:48.640]  You've got the floor.
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:51.640]  Well, there's a small topic to deal with.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:58.640]  Very briefly, of course, as you know, whites did not go to Africa and go into the country
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:03.640]  and capture the peaceful slaves or peaceful blacks and drag them off in slavery.
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:08.640]  Whites couldn't survive in Africa because we didn't have the immune system to deal with all the plagues.
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:13.640]  The average life expectancy for a white who left the coast and went inland was about 11 months.
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:17.640]  So the black slave trade and the Arab slave trade, the Middle Eastern slave trade,
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:21.640]  were coming along and whites went in and bought the slaves from the coastal cities and took them away.
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:22.640]  All nasty stuff.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:25.640]  I mean, slavery is a fundamental moral abomination.
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:26.640]  Nobody has any argument with that.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.640]  I read the British reports from 300 years ago where, on average,
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:35.640]  a third of the ship would die of the white sailors just going to pick up slaves.
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:38.640]  And that was why the first multicultural pirate ships were created.
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.640]  It wasn't that they wanted to even revolt.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:43.640]  It was a death sentence if you came back on a second mission.
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:44.640]  Go ahead.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:48.640]  Well, and the whites who were sailing the ships were themselves slaves.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.640]  They were press ganged into this.
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:55.640]  I mean, it was the government power which is evil all over the world pretty much, which needs to be fought.
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:39:00.640]  So what happened, of course, was with a sort of an awakening consciousness
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.640]  which came out of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, egalitarianism,
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:06.640]  the spirit of man, the universality of ethics and so on,
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.640]  which was, of course, in the Declaration of Independence
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:12.640]  and was supposed to be a more foundational part of the U.S. Constitution,
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:17.640]  they started to say, well, maybe owning other human beings like livestock is not really that great an idea.
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:21.640]  And the Royal Navy sailed around the seas, not in terms of carquests.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:23.640]  There certainly was that element to it.
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:26.640]  But they were out there trying to catch slavers and trying to end the practice of slavery.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:29.640]  The British government bribed many Arabic governments to have them stop.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.640]  Paid slave owners to have them stop having their slaves.
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:37.640]  And they had to catch these slave ships really quickly because if you were a slave ship,
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:39.640]  a Royal Navy ship comes up behind you.
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:42.640]  If they think they're going to catch, if you think you're going to get caught,
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:44.640]  you cut the throats of your slaves and you dump them in the water.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.640]  They had to catch them under cover of night.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.640]  They had to steal on the ships to do this.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.640]  This is how committed they were to ending this moral abomination called slavery.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:55.640]  And this is nowhere taught. It is nowhere understood
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:00.640]  because I think fundamentally white guilt is a very profitable resource for people to tweak.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:03.640]  You know, you make a white person feel guilty and they'll be like, oh, here's some benefits.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.640]  Here's affirmative action. Here's taxes. Here's whatever you want.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.640]  Just stop making me feel guilty.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.640]  And then that hamstrings the people that are getting the handouts.
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:14.640]  And then that hamstrings the people that are becoming dependent.
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:15.640]  Right.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.640]  Yeah, and of course in Africa now, South Africa in particular, I mean, it's monstrous.
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:22.640]  apartheid, of course, was immoral and racist and so on.
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:25.640]  But we do have to look to some degree at the relative ethics at the time.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:29.640]  All of the other blacks in Africa were dying to get into South Africa.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.640]  I visited there a few times and I have a little bit of experience there.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.640]  People were trying to get into South Africa.
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:38.640]  60% of blacks and whites now say that they were better off under apartheid.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.640]  And if you're saying that you're better off under apartheid,
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:44.640]  that is not exactly a ringing endorsement of your current system.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:48.640]  South Africa is the rape and murder capital of the world at the moment.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:50.640]  It is a disintegrating country.
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:56.640]  And I think it's partly because they didn't really go back and learn the lessons of the American Revolution.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:59.640]  And you had a bunch of communists of which Nelson Mandela was first and foremost.
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:02.640]  He wrote a treatise in his youth called How to Be a Good Communist.
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:05.640]  He did not explicitly reject these views.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:12.640]  And so the virus of socialism landed in Africa in the same way that it landed after the Rajah ended in 1949 in India.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:18.640]  You get all these socialists who go out there and try and set up this central planning communist-socialist dystopia
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:21.640]  and then things go to heck in a handbasket and nobody sits there and says,
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:25.640]  well, it's because people aren't free to trade and own property and government interfering with everything.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:28.640]  It's the same lesson that we learned brutally for hundreds of years
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:30.640]  and we've forgotten to teach other people.
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.640]  Well, Valiantly joined the communists because he'd been a member of the British Imperial Police.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:38.640]  Eric Blair was his real name until he went and fought in the Abraham Lincoln Brigades
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:42.640]  and got shot in the throat in the Spanish Civil War against Hitler's forces.
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:47.640]  And then he wrote about in his books, I read them, how the communist leaders were actually just like
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:53.640]  bank robber criminal rapist who were using all the well-meaning communists to set up and just take over
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:58.640]  and they couldn't beat the Nazis because the communists were just so criminal they couldn't even organize.
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:04.640]  The Nazis were actually ideologues who believed what they were doing and it's just incredible.
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:10.640]  There is this belief that we have ordinary criminals like pickpockets and so on
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:14.640]  and then we have organized criminals like the mafia and so on
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:20.640]  and then above those people like this archway above society is this glowing godhood of statism
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:22.640]  that protects us from all these nasty little people.
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:26.640]  I think that the historically accurate, if not currently accurate view,
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:29.640]  is that the incompetent criminals are out there picking your pockets.
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:32.640]  The more competent criminals are organizing into mobs,
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:36.640]  but the most competent criminals run for office and end up in charge of the state.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.640]  They are the best of the best.
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:43.640]  They're not there to protect you from criminals because they're kind of pursuing the same methodology, but better.
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.640]  And that's what Zabinia Brzezinski has said in three of his books.
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:52.640]  He admits that they run every criminal operation to control it for our own good, though, Stefan.
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.640]  We've got to be thankful they launder the drug money and run the little kids and, you know, do everything.
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.640]  We've got to be thankful they made drugs illegal to make larger profits.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.640]  See how they helped us?
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:06.640]  Well, of course, you hear this argument all the time without the government and the police.
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.640]  Who on earth would protect your property, Alex?
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:13.640]  First of all, if you're allowed to own your own weaponry, your property is pretty safe to begin with.
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:16.640]  And secondly, how can I claim that somebody is there to protect my property
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:22.640]  when they take over 50% of it at source and not even counting unfunded liabilities, debts, and deficits
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:24.640]  when they take about 50% of my money?
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:25.640]  That's right.
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:26.640]  How can they be said to be protecting my money?
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:27.640]  That's right.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:29.640]  The average cop can be a really good person.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:31.640]  On average, I've actually found a lot of more servants.
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:32.640]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:39.640]  The big state is there to support, as you've said, and protect the farm animals from rogue wolves and coyotes
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:44.640]  that might try to come snack on a pig or a goat or a sheep or a chicken or stop a weasel.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:49.640]  The larger weasel is guarding the henhouse from other weasels that aren't in his employ.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:53.640]  The system is there to protect their racket over us.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:59.640]  And now they're getting greedy and have created a gender 21 cosmology nomenclature
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:03.640]  where they fantasize that social engineering is looting us
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:09.640]  to reduce us down to the level of beggars to save the earth while they themselves are the ones
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:13.640]  with government mismanagement allowing the degradation of the environment.
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:14.640]  It's incredible.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:20.640]  I mean, the fruits of these people is literally liquid death.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:24.640]  Well, you know, one of the great tragedies of history, Alex,
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:30.640]  is that a truly free market doesn't have much use for sophists and sociopaths
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:33.640]  and all of the predatory wordsmiths of the upper classes.
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:35.640]  And so when there's a free market, you know what you have to do?
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:36.640]  You do this with your show.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:37.640]  I do this with my show.
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:40.640]  We go out and we try to produce value to people on a voluntary basis.
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:43.640]  If they don't like us, they can just switch us off.
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:45.640]  If they find us offensive, they can turn us off.
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:48.640]  But we still have to go out there and provide truth on a voluntary basis.
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:50.640]  But if you're a politician, everyone's going to listen to you
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:53.640]  because you're in charge of all the weaponry in the known universe and beyond.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:58.640]  So when you have a truly free market, all of the verbally adept sociopathic busybodies
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:01.640]  who want to tell everyone else what to do can't really do it
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:03.640]  because they can try and boss you around.
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:05.640]  You're like, click, turn them off, don't care.
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:08.640]  And so these kinds of people can't really adapt to the free market.
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:13.640]  They want to retain the power, the political power to push everyone around.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:17.640]  And, you know, the endless interfering busybodies of the human race
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:20.640]  would have precious little to do without the state.
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:22.640]  And that's one of the reasons why they like the state.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.640]  It gives them this massive platform to move us all around,
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.640]  like the little pawns, like the little ants, like the livestock that they think we are.
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:32.640]  The tragedy is they can only do it with our fundamental consent.
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:33.640]  That's right.
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:36.640]  And it literally becomes an ether in which unnatural people
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:40.640]  that no one would want to associate with can now attain power and success
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:44.640]  instead of the natural, virtuous way, whoever is the most hardworking,
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:47.640]  the most loving, the most creative, the most beautiful,
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:50.640]  the most honorable becomes the example of society
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:53.640]  that others emulate that, and you go to Alpha Centuries
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:55.640]  and to the next level of human development.
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:58.640]  But if you go with who has the most weapons, the most thugs,
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:03.640]  the most intimidation, the best BS, you build systems of BS
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:06.640]  toward the public, then mimics that, civilization collapses.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:09.640]  And then it restarts over with virtue again.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.640]  Then we become decadent and corrupt.
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.640]  The problem is we can't go to that cycle again
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:16.640]  because they're going to destroy the planet with the weaponry this time.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.640]  They must be stopped.
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:20.640]  Well, I agree with that.
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:23.640]  And there is this awful thing that is fundamental where people say,
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:28.640]  well, Barack Obama or Sarkozy or Putin or whoever is, they should be in charge.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:30.640]  They should be telling everyone what to do.
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:32.640]  They know the way things should be.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:34.640]  And I would love to see a world, Alex,
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.640]  where these guys had the power of, say, an advice column.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.640]  You know, where you could write into these guys and say,
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:43.640]  Barack Obama, how should I deal with my health care?
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.640]  And he'd say, well, I, as a constitutional law professor,
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.640]  I believe that you should do X, Y, blah, blah, whatever, right?
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:50.640]  I'd love to just see them have the power of an advice column.
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:52.640]  Or, you know, they'd have a hotline.
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:55.640]  You'd call them up and say, Barack, I don't really know what to do with 50% of my income.
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:56.640]  What do you think I should do?
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:58.640]  He'd say, well, you should spend it on this, this, this, and this.
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.640]  That's what I want.
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:02.640]  We don't have the power to compel our obedience,
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:05.640]  but they actually have to win us over with reason and evidence.
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:07.640]  Wouldn't that be a beautiful world?
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:11.640]  Exactly. Instead, they blow stuff up or let people blow stuff up
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:13.640]  and then fear monger until we give up all of our rights.
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:15.640]  Let me ask you this when you go to phone calls.
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:17.640]  Where do you step on, Malinu?
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:22.640]  Where do you think this battle in your gut, just as your stalt, is going?
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.640]  Is liberty losing or winning?
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:27.640]  And will the global blow stuff up?
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:33.640]  You were going to get flex of foam on your webcam because this is a topic I actually feel quite passionate about.
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:36.640]  So I will give you my very, very brief answer to that.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.640]  There is no momentum in history.
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:41.640]  There is no great movements of history that pushes around.
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:44.640]  We are not pinballs in the endless bumper.
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:47.640]  Sorry, for your younger audience, you'll have to ask your parents what that means.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.640]  We're not pinballs bumping around the bumpers of some giant cosmic pinball machine.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:58.640]  Where the world goes is where committed, passionate, knowledgeable communicators make it go.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:00.640]  It's where you make it go. It's where I make it go.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:03.640]  It's where your listeners make it go in their conversations, in their lives.
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:06.640]  Where does history go? Where is the momentum of human history?
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:11.640]  In the willpower of committed individuals and in no other place.
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:17.640]  Now, it's true that if committed people of intelligence and integrity and willpower do nothing, then yes,
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:19.640]  the worse tends to overcome the better.
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:22.640]  Like, if you sit on your couch, you get fat or not leaner.
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:25.640]  And if we do nothing, then yes, evil wins.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:29.640]  But all we have to do is get off our butts and make the world uncomfortable for the compromise,
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:34.640]  which provokes them into thinking like you sharpen a sword against a spinning sand wheel.
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:36.640]  Then we just go and make the world uncomfortable.
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:37.640]  We push the world where we wanted to go.
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:40.640]  We make the world go where we wanted to go because we have the better arguments.
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:41.640]  Exactly.
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:42.640]  We have the greater evidence.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:45.640]  And the accumulated evidence of history is completely on our side.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:49.640]  I agree. And the status to all say this, Cass Sunstein says,
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:54.640]  we'll infiltrate the alternative media, discredit it by acting, you know, bad, putting out racism, disinfo.
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.640]  And they say we've got to just keep pushing, pushing, pushing.
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:00.640]  They even admit in their own papers, oh, they all want freedom.
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:03.640]  The average person wants to be a libertarian or beyond.
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.640]  But we've got to act like they're all alone.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:08.640]  We've got to just dominate them, whip them, break their will.
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.640]  And so the crazy thing is they write all these books like we're not reading them.
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:14.640]  I think their arrogance is going to undo them.
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:18.640]  So we have to make them uncomfortable everywhere, just like they do us.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.640]  And that's what I do.
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:21.640]  And it's not a tiring thing, folks.
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.640]  Once you start doing this, it's like family breathing.
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:27.640]  Oh, I was supposed to do this.
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:32.640]  This is the animating contest of liberty that Jefferson talked about.
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:33.640]  Yes.
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:37.640]  And don't you remember when you were a kid and you did something bad or did something wrong,
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:42.640]  which basically meant you disagreed with the authority and ease of the powers that be in your school or wherever.
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.640]  What would they say to you that day?
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:48.640]  Alex Jones, young Alex Jones, this is going to go on your permanent record.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.640]  And those words were like, oh, my goodness, it's going to be tattooed on my forehead and so on.
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:56.640]  And now, of course, we all have a genuine permanent record called everything we ever do on the Internet
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:59.640]  or in a bank machine or using our credit card through the NSA.
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:00.640]  And what has it done?
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:06.640]  It has done fundamentally nothing to us other than give us more ammunition to push back against this encroaching tyranny.
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:07.640]  Exactly.
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:08.640]  Call their bluff.
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:10.640]  Double down on life.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:11.640]  Get crazed.
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:18.640]  I mean, humans are meant to be wild and full of life and instead of just waddling around wearing sports jerseys,
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:22.640]  you know, watching steroid heads push each other around and grab each other's butts.
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:31.640]  I mean, it's just there's so much more in the universe than watching Obama or watching John Boehner or watching all these people.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:36.640]  That's what I hate is how the status make us look at them, make us talk about them, even to block them.
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:38.640]  We need to make them where they're the joke they are.
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.640]  Do you agree with that?
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:43.640]  Yeah, look, I mean, what are we as a species had to be evolved?
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:45.640]  We evolved as hunter-gatherers.
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:50.640]  Now, we've all just kind of thrown the hunter side aside, you know, and we've just become these gatherers.
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:53.640]  Like, oh, look, there's some nuts called welfare or the military industrial complex.
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:54.640]  Exactly. Stay there.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:55.640]  I'll finish that thought.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:56.640]  I'll finish that thought.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.640]  We're going to be right back when the music's playing and they can't hear me.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:00.640]  We're going to be right back, folks. Stay with us.

[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:49.640]  and we never use chemicals or preservatives.

[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:02.640]  The facts are in. The studies are legion.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:09.640]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:13.640]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:18.640]  Simple, dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:24.640]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:30.640]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLive fluoride shield formulation,
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:38.640]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body,
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:40.640]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:45.640]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:47.640]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:55.640]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLive.com today.
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:53:02.640]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWars at the same time. That's InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:07.640]  We travel so much and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind.
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:10.640]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets,
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:16.640]  but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:22.640]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:28.640]  and know that passing motors and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:33.640]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:37.640]  And they're so easy to use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:41.640]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:45.640]  Fake TV is only $34.95 and makes a great Christmas gift.
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:52.640]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:58.640]  That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:26.640]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:29.640]  Jeff Hanumanu is our guest.
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:38.640]  Right now, he was briefly finishing up his point that he had a predator cinder class that trains us to act like absolute victims.
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:40.640]  Crank it up, here's the good part, right here.
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.640]  The message of the New World Order.
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:44.640]  We're not laying down anymore.
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.640]  We're gonna hunt them.
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:56.640]  Call me the hunter, that's my name.
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:00.640]  Alright folks, let's go back to Steph Hanumanu, a little bit overdrive and take these calls.
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:04.640]  I apologize the callers, I've been hogging all the guests today, I'm a really bad guy.
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.640]  Alright, Steph Hanumanu, finish your point about that.
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:10.640]  About the heart.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:16.640]  Yeah, we've lost our, I think to some degree, masculinity.
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:18.640]  Bring back the masculinity, bring back the spine.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:25.640]  We've just become these gatherers looking for the rotten fruits of power that drip down on our tables and going, ah, what a great meal.
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:27.640]  Let's go out and hunt ourselves some freedom.
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:35.640]  It's all language, it's all reason, it's all evidence, there's no weaponry that's gonna set us free because the real prison, the real state, the real tyranny is in the mind.
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:38.640]  But we can blow through that stuff with reason and evidence.
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:43.640]  And once you shift into the hunter mode and bring down a big predator called freedom, go ahead, sorry.
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:44.640]  No, no, I agree.
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:49.640]  Once we shift into hunter mode against the enemy, that's combat mode as well.
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:55.640]  They're shifted into that with deceit, we shift into the hunter mode with liberty, we're gonna kick their butt.
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:57.640]  And we all love combat.
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:55:58.640]  Are you talking about sports?
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:55:59.640]  Sports is combat.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:02.640]  I mean, how well do combat movies show?
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:05.640]  We all love combat, it's invigorating.
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:12.640]  The great mistake, of course, has been to try to get a fight with weapons rather than with language, rather than with philosophy, rather than with reason and evidence.
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:15.640]  But when you get into that mode, it's really invigorating.
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:19.640]  People look at that and say, oh, there's so much fighting, it's so tense, it must be so stressful.
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:22.640]  It's kind of what we're built for, people.
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:23.640]  This is why we're not in the caves.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:26.640]  This is why we're not jellyfish or amoeba anymore.
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:27.640]  I mean, most of us.
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:31.640]  So I think that it's really, I invite people to take on the combat.
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:35.640]  It's what Andrew Braypart used to say, walk towards the fire.
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:40.640]  Walk towards the fire because if you run away, it's gonna catch you only with your back turned.
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:41.640]  Absolutely.
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:42.640]  God bless you.
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:43.640]  That's very well said.
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:44.640]  God bless to the atheists.
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.640]  It's an endearing term.
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:48.640]  Let's talk to Greg and Pennsylvania.
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:49.640]  Thanks for holding Brother on the air.
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.640]  Go ahead.
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:52.640]  Hello there, gentlemen.
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:56.640]  I'd like to throw something out there that nobody has talked about.
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:04.640]  It would be the farm bill and the role and what the farmers would play in things as they
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:05.640]  progress.
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:07.640]  And I'm a small farmer.
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:14.640]  I have to work a 50-hour-a-week job just to keep the farm going and keep everything going.
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:21.640]  I'd just like to get your take on the farm bill and I guess we could call it the food stamp bill.
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:26.640]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:28.640]  I've read some about it but it's always changing.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:29.640]  You're the expert.
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:32.640]  Give us your brief take on it and we'll get Stefan's take.
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:35.640]  Well, from what I read it, it's basically a food stamp bill.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:41.640]  80% of it is food stamps and none of it that I know helps me a small farmer.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:43.640]  Yeah, well, that's what they do.
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:46.640]  They always get control of the economy and then call it one thing and do another.
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:51.640]  I know this, American farmers were much more prosperous than there were more of them before
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:52.640]  government got involved.
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:53.640]  They're replacing it with big agra.
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:56.640]  Only big agra knows how to get the incentives and the free deals.
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:58.640]  Let's get Stefan's take on that.
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:57:59.640]  God bless you.
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:00.640]  Great.
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:01.640]  Good question.
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:06.640]  Well, on the right, the Republican Party gets an average donation of about $50 each.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:09.640]  In other words, small farmers can help the Republican Party.
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:13.640]  On the left, the Democratic Party has refused to release the size of their average donation
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:17.640]  because I'm not even going out on a limb to guess that it's far larger than that
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:22.640]  because it comes from a lot of rich elites in the media and in the entertainment industry and so on.
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:26.640]  So one of the problems is the people on the left, they want bigger and bigger organizations
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:30.640]  because the small people, they like to fund parties that are focusing on smaller government
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:32.640]  if we tried like the Republican Party.
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.640]  So when you get big aggregate groups together that tends to benefit the left
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:39.640]  and so when you start to give farm subsidies, then you start to make it more profitable
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:44.640]  to lobby politicians and all...
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:59:10.640]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:22.640]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLine fluoride shield formulation
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:28.640]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:33.640]  not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:37.640]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:39.640]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:45.640]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at infowarslife.com today.
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:49.640]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWars at the same time.
[01:59:49.640 --> 02:00:10.640]  That's infowarslife.com.
[02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:30.640]  In Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:32.640]  All I know is this.
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:35.640]  We have an authoritarian directive in Washington.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:38.640]  It's bipartisan because of a lot of corruption going on.
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:44.640]  They want a police state and it's up to all of us to exercise our Second Amendment.
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:49.640]  That's why I love the open carries that have not caused any problems nationwide like we had at the Alamo,
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:53.640]  is because it shows, hey, it's not dirty that I have a gun.
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:01:01.640]  And I liken it to Martin Luther King going into the places where you couldn't give your black,
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:07.640]  the bathrooms, the hotels, the restaurants.
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:09.640]  It's the same thing with an open carrier.
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:13.640]  It's the same thing suing when the police arrest you for your legal lawful gun.
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:15.640]  You've got to do it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.640]  You've got to have these marches.
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:19.640]  So in closing, Eric, anything else you'd like to add?
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:23.640]  You're the victim of this, the owner going out of their car,
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:29.640]  and any other tidbits or points you think people should know about where this lawsuit's going now?
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:33.640]  This federal lawsuit because the county's done nothing.
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:39.640]  All I can say is just beware of the police out there.
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:45.640]  And I don't know where it's going. We're trying to push and we're trying to push and trying to get something done.
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:49.640]  But all I can say is just pray for us.
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:54.640]  We're trying to work. We're trying to get something solved for this.
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:58.640]  I mean, I just saw the New York police chief came out and said, trust us, we're your friends.
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:00.640]  Why are they having to talk like that?
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:05.640]  Because the police are being given political directives that are unconstitutional
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:08.640]  and aren't common law and aren't common sense.
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:13.640]  And the police are wildly popular when they have good departments and follow the bill of rights.
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:19.640]  So the police, you know, you're saying, again, talking to your lawyer, Shannon Braley,
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:22.640]  both your parents were Atlanta police.
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:27.640]  So growing up in that, I know you probably have a lot of inside baseball on it.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:30.640]  What do you think is happening here?
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:33.640]  Yeah, I was an officer for seven years.
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:38.640]  So a lot of times people in the community, they will contact the city council and make complaints.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:43.640]  And then they'll complain to the white shirts, the upper echelon.
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:47.640]  And they'll be like, instead of thinking and having thoughtful dialogue with the officers,
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:49.640]  they'll be like, give me bodies, give me bodies.
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:53.640]  And, you know, this is, again, like I said before, this is a shot that requires thoughts,
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:56.640]  like being a surgeon or anything else.
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.640]  So, you know, this isn't putting on parts to a machine and a factory.
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:03.640]  It requires thoughts every single situation.
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:04.640]  And they don't encourage that.
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:06.640]  They just say, give me bodies.
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:12.640]  And, you know, I believe that it's going to take, you know, people bringing things like this to light,
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:14.640]  that yes, it's terrible to have crime.
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:21.640]  And yes, we want the bad guys to be arrested, but not at the sacrifice of, you know, basic fundamental,
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:23.640]  you know, human rights we have.
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:26.640]  But they knew they had a concealed carry.
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:28.640]  I mean, they knew he didn't have a criminal record.
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:29.640]  They knew he was a good guy.
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:33.640]  They still just said, okay, instead of saying they were wrong, which they weren't even wrong,
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:36.640]  instead of just saying, okay, false alarm, have a nice day, they had to take him to jail.
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:41.640]  It's that idea of, well, you know, a lot of departments don't want to hire intelligent police now.
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:44.640]  And that's because the establishment wants a tyranny.
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:45.640]  Exactly.
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:46.640]  And, you know, he knew he was wrong.
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:48.640]  That's why he turned up the radio in the way that they jailed.
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:49.640]  He knew he was wrong.
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:52.640]  He didn't want to feel guilty about, you know, Mr. Lee.
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:55.640]  And, you know, they count on people get sweeping things under the rug.
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:57.640]  It's like an arrest is no big deal.
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:59.640]  Well, it was a big deal for Eric.
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:03.640]  And, you know, and it was a big deal that they continued to hold property.
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:05.640]  So, I think...
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:06.640]  Oh, yeah, that's the big issue.
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:09.640]  Still hadn't got his gun back.
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:13.640]  They continue to endorse this behavior.
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:16.640]  Well, you're a good lawyer, Shannon Briley, and I would...
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:17.640]  Thank you.
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:18.640]  If I was ever in Georgia, I'd need one.
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:19.640]  I'll give you a call.
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:20.640]  Thank you.
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:21.640]  Are there any websites we can visit?
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:23.640]  Are there ways we can support you guys?
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:27.640]  You can go to www.brileylaw.com.
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:30.640]  B-R-I-L-E-Y-L-A-W.com.
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:32.640]  And I have a Facebook page.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:35.640]  It's facebook.com backslash Briley Law.
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:36.640]  I'm sorry.
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:37.640]  I've been sick this week.
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:38.640]  My voice is hoarse.
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:39.640]  Oh, you sound great.
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:40.640]  Thank you.
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:43.640]  Listen, Eric Lee, God bless you for what you're doing.
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:45.640]  We'll check in with you again as the lawsuit develops, sir.
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:46.640]  Okay.
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:47.640]  Thank you.
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:48.640]  Thank you.
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:49.640]  Thank you.
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:50.640]  All right.
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:52.640]  There's folks fighting back against just out of control government, folks.
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:55.640]  I'm telling you, this government is out of control.
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:57.640]  I want America back.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:26.640]  Stay with us.
[02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:28.640]  Thank you.
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:59.640]  Thank you.
[02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:28.640]  Thank you.
[02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:30.640]  Thank you.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.640]  Thank you.
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:30.640]  Thank you.
[02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:02.640]  Are you in full wars shop?
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:10.640]  Do.
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:12.640]  Do.
[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:13.640]  Do.
[02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:14.640]  Do.
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:15.640]  Do.
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:16.640]  Do.
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:17.640]  Do.
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:18.640]  Do.
[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:19.640]  Do.
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:20.640]  Do.
[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:21.640]  Do.
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:22.640]  Do.
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:23.640]  Do.
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:24.640]  Do.
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:25.640]  Do.
[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:26.640]  Do.
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:27.640]  Do.
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:29.280]  It's not hard to do.
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:31.680]  Tyrants do the same things over and over again.
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:33.520]  Their playbook's actually pretty small.
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:37.000]  And they call slavery different things,
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.840]  but it's basically the same thing.
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:42.120]  And we know that we're already deep into
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:44.680]  social engineering, the collapse of society.
[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:46.520]  And I've been hammering at the last,
[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:49.240]  I don't know, three, four years has been really obvious.
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:51.840]  Obama's been in now for six years
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:54.320]  that he is becoming a dictator.
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:59.240]  And I remember having Pastor David Manning on,
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:00.600]  Pastor James David Manning,
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:01.960]  I don't know, six, seven years ago
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:03.860]  when he's first talking about Obama.
[02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:05.760]  And he was saying, he's gonna become a dictator.
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:06.880]  He's not gonna leave.
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:09.280]  I tell you, he's pure evil.
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:12.320]  And I'm like, come on, he's just a front man
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:14.600]  to push their agenda, presidents or puppets.
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:16.520]  Come on, let's not, come on,
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:18.320]  that's gonna add to the division here.
[02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:20.200]  We need to, you know, they're trying to sell him
[02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:21.560]  as a second coming of Christ,
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:23.320]  and Abraham Lincoln all rolled into one,
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:25.120]  but can't be that bad.
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:29.520]  And now I've got to say that Manning has been correct
[02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:32.160]  and I have been wrong and under stating
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:34.840]  how bad Obama would be.
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:36.080]  Let me explain something.
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:39.320]  He put our military under NATO, UN command
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:40.440]  and when Congress threatened him
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:42.640]  and said this is unconstitutional and illegal,
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:45.920]  he said them letters and had the joint chiefs testify
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:49.200]  belligerently that they get their orders
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:50.480]  from the UN in NATO.
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:52.840]  He played that audio, three separate hearings,
[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:54.960]  House and Senate Armed Services Committees,
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:58.520]  in the last three years, three times.
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:01.240]  He is shutting down, it's over 500 now,
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:04.120]  they're shutting down 500 more coal power plants
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:07.680]  that are totally clean, supply 50 plus percent of our power.
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:10.400]  Well, they did now, plants supply like 30 something,
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:12.200]  they're shutting us down.
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:14.520]  And then General Electric can scale up
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:15.960]  and make more money, they're exempt.
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:17.580]  That's martial law.
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:21.000]  He's legalizing all the illegals basically,
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.600]  this is in the news, by fiat, without even an order,
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:26.640]  he just tells them on the phone what to do.
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:30.200]  Like he's beyond Kim Jong-il of North Korea, Kim Jong-un.
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:33.040]  At least they'll even do a fake order on paper
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:34.080]  and put a fake stamp on it.
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:36.800]  He just says, hey, my word is God, God emperor.
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:40.200]  He's now doing it with Obamacare.
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:41.560]  They're saying yes, make him a dictator,
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:43.480]  he'll fix, now Democrats are saying,
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:45.680]  let's make him president for a third term
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:48.160]  or let's just suspend things or let's just,
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:50.080]  and it's a whole bunch of areas, folks,
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:51.520]  and they've gotten away with Fast and Furious,
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:54.080]  the IRS persecuting Christians and gun groups
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:56.480]  and pro-lifers and the FBI covering it up.
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:00.000]  And I mean, it had been gauzy and Fast and Furious,
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.080]  it goes on and on and on and on.
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:05.080]  And then I realized,
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:09.920]  I said, I said to Libya and invading Africa with UN armies
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:12.000]  that are just murdering people in mass,
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:15.720]  backed by Muslims and animus killing Christians everywhere.
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:17.160]  I mean, if it's evil, they're doing it.
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:18.800]  They don't even do it for an interest now,
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:20.200]  except to further evil.
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:23.720]  Again, it's scary when you got corrupt boss hog politicians
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:25.120]  that do bad stuff for power,
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:26.320]  but when they're doing it,
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:28.320]  even though it's destroying Obama,
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:30.640]  even though it's making him be hated,
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:33.760]  they don't care because it is a mission
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:34.960]  to bankrupt America.
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:37.800]  Obamacare, all of it, it is on record
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:38.880]  to bring this country down.
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:41.480]  Now, the architect of it is E.K. LeManuel admits it.
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:42.320]  So he joins us,
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:43.800]  he'll be a phone to the bottom of the hour
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:44.640]  with a quick pop in,
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:47.400]  I wanna get him for a full hour soon via video Skype
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:51.960]  from his OTTLA TV studios there in Harlem,
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:54.160]  where he actually tries to preach a message
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:58.040]  that's gonna get people out of the plantation
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:11:59.400]  that is socialism.
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:01.040]  And he feeds hundreds of children a day
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:03.440]  and others with their soup kitchens.
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:04.760]  And he joins us right now.
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:05.920]  So he's a really good guy.
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:08.400]  Pastor Manning, thank you for coming on with us today, sir.
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:10.280]  Well, Alex, thank you for having me today.
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:11.960]  Real joy, real pleasure.
[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:12.800]  Thank you.
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:13.640]  I mean, you've got the floor
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:14.640]  for a little bit of time we've got.
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:17.160]  He is a dictator now.
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:18.000]  The question is,
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.520]  is he making the office of dictatorship?
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:20.600]  Will he leave?
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:23.800]  Well, I think that we need to understand Obama
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:26.600]  in terms of modern dictatorship.
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:28.360]  But generally when we think about dictators
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:32.040]  like Hitler, Mussolini or Lenin or others,
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:34.400]  we think about them using the military
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:38.920]  to deploy their policies and to keep people in control.
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:42.800]  Obama has found a way to use an economic, racial,
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:46.440]  and social policies as if the military,
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:49.560]  in other words, what Obama does with his,
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:53.440]  with these policies, with economics, with racism,
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:57.040]  which is the undergirding of his presidency.
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:01.360]  And then social issues which are anti-Christian, anti-God,
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:04.160]  many of them very communist and very Marxist,
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:05.600]  is his new army.
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:07.200]  And so he's a modern dictator.
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:09.240]  We have to think about him in those terms.
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:13.120]  Man, you really are smart.
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:15.160]  I mean, the way you crystallize things, that's it.
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:19.280]  Obama is the modern 2.0 dictator.
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:20.480]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:23.760]  And I think the next thing we need to begin to think about
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:25.240]  is what are we gonna do about him?
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:28.800]  And in your opening piece, you stated that I stated six years
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:31.000]  ago that he would not leave office
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.800]  and that he would become a dictator.
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:35.160]  In fact, he came in as a dictator.
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:37.560]  What we need to think about now is how are we going
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:40.960]  to move him if we're going to save America?
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:43.400]  How are we going to get him out of office
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:46.400]  because he has such power over the courts, Alex?
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:48.640]  I mean, the very fact that Obamacare was approved
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:51.880]  by Judge Roberts, in the case this man has power
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:55.800]  over the courts, Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the courts
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:57.800]  so he could get his policies through.
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:00.520]  All Obama has to do is pick up the phone
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:02.240]  and his policies are approved.
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:03.800]  So how are we gonna get him out of office?
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:05.360]  What are we gonna do?
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:09.480]  We can't rely upon the Republicans or the conservatives
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:12.360]  or whoever it is that is supposed to be opposing him
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:14.120]  because they're not doing that.
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:15.880]  If we're going to save this nation
[02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:18.320]  and stop Obama from crashing it
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:19.880]  and do what he wants to do with it,
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:22.160]  we have to start thinking about strategies
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:24.600]  and not relying upon the electoral system
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:26.880]  or the Republicans or the media,
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:29.240]  which is the other part of his government
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:30.680]  to be able to save America.
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:34.080]  Very well said.
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:35.840]  And I think we've got to communicate to people
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:40.120]  that it's a modern form of technocratic dictatorship.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:41.480]  And I was thinking they were setting up
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:43.480]  dictatorial divisions and systems
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:45.880]  so that the office could be dictatorial,
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:49.440]  but they are acting like they don't care what we think now
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:51.400]  and that they are trying to bring the country down
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:54.120]  and bankrupt it so that he can then pose as a savior.
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:56.680]  How do you expect him to try to stay in office?
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:14:57.720]  Because for the first time,
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:00.000]  I'm starting to think that may be the plan.
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:03.760]  Well, I suspect that he's most probably going to have
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:05.480]  some sort of a false flag.
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:07.680]  I think he's gonna need martial law.
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:09.320]  He's gonna need the military
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:11.600]  in order to be able to stay in office.
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:13.160]  And there's no telling what he'll do
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:16.560]  in terms of some sort of a false flag that he'll create.
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:19.160]  Maybe a crisis within America,
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:21.880]  some sort of a possible racial crisis.
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:24.120]  Well, I don't think that might be it.
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:25.760]  On the other hand, Alex,
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:28.760]  the thing that we have to be very mindful of
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:30.760]  is that there are a large number of Americans
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:32.440]  who are ready now to revolt.
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:35.800]  And they very well may give him what he wants.
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:40.560]  On the other hand, we need a revolution at this station.
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:42.600]  So we want to be like Lexus in a concord.
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:44.720]  We want to work to not let it get physical
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:48.120]  and win the info war, the war of ideas.
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:49.920]  But if they start stuff,
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:54.920]  I think we should be more Christ-like and at key points.
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:58.240]  Well, I'm not so sure we should be so Christ-like
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:00.160]  unless we're gonna be the Christ of the sword
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:01.960]  that I preach for the most part.
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:02.960]  I think we're gonna need a revolution.
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:04.080]  Well, let me just finish the statement.
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:04.920]  Let me just finish the statement
[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:06.120]  so you know where I'm coming from.
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:09.720]  I'm saying we have to wait for the right time
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:13.000]  to where morally they fire first
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.920]  and then we have the moral high ground.
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:17.800]  We don't want them to trick us into something preemptive.
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:19.880]  The problem is they'll blow up another federal building
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:22.480]  like OKC, the same attorney general was deputy then,
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:25.200]  clearly involved to the blame it on the liberty movement.
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:29.000]  So I understand that we may have to defend ourselves.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.200]  My problem is that they may blow something up
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:32.120]  and blame it on us.
[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:33.320]  So the last thing we wanna do
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:35.360]  is offensively do anything, go ahead.
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:36.880]  We definitely don't want that to happen.
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:40.560]  You don't want them to blame us on 9-11
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:43.520]  or some other event or the Oklahoma event.
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:45.440]  That we don't wanna have happen.
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:47.720]  Well, we also have to think about, Alex,
[02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:50.960]  is that Obama controls the economy.
[02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:53.000]  He controls Wall Street.
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.840]  So we're gonna need economic power,
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:57.680]  not just military power or revolutionary power.
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:00.360]  We need economic power and that's the thing
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:01.680]  that we're lacking most in.
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:04.440]  I mean, all of America's armed to the teeth.
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:06.960]  People all over America that are ready to rise up
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:08.920]  if they have to to save this nation.
[02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:10.200]  Not because they're belligerent,
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:11.800]  not because they hate the nation,
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:13.680]  not because they're just warmongering,
[02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:15.680]  but they realize that we need to be able
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:18.080]  to save this nation militarily.
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:20.680]  The problem is this, is that we don't have
[02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:24.480]  the kind of economic power or the media power
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:27.280]  to be able to withstand a Obama attack,
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:28.480]  which is what he's doing now.
[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:29.560]  So how do we get that thing out?
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:31.760]  How do we do that, is the question.
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:34.360]  I think you're right.
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:36.320]  People better support alternative real media
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:38.800]  like never before, whether it's what you're doing
[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:40.800]  at OTTLA and we're gonna give that side out
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:43.360]  in just a moment and we'll put it up on screen
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:46.200]  or Info Wars or Drudge or any of the sites.
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:47.560]  In fact, Richard, you scroll down
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:49.640]  so I can put his side up on the air for folks.
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:54.640]  It's OTTLA.ORGATLAH.ORG, it's an excellent site.
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:17:57.720]  We need to do that.
[02:17:57.720 --> 02:17:59.080]  I think we need to just get the word out,
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:00.960]  I'll tell you this, I was talking to an army officer
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:03.600]  just yesterday, I'll just leave it at that.
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:07.160]  And he said 98% of the military knows what's going on now.
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:09.600]  Now just six months ago, he said it was about 80%.
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:12.680]  He said 98% know that there's an attempt
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:15.280]  to overthrow the country and to bring in tyranny.
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:18.040]  I think we need to get the word out that we're not alone
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:20.080]  and that we, but we're not connected
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:21.840]  because we don't have the media
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:25.720]  and we don't have the financial system.
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:28.880]  So it's really a bizarre situation.
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:31.080]  Almost like a Mexican stand-off.
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:33.880]  Well, I think we're gonna have to attack the media
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:36.600]  as the first line of Obama defense.
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:40.480]  The media serves as its pawns or as its bishops.
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:42.240]  We're gonna have to go after the media.
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:43.720]  We're gonna have to support media like you.
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:46.760]  And I'm not patronizing you, Alex,
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:50.080]  but we're gonna have to begin to listen to sources like you
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:52.040]  and other sources that are out there.
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:55.560]  But we're gonna have to attack as the first line of defense.
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:57.560]  All of the media, whether it's conservative,
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:00.800]  the liberal media, they all do the exact same thing.
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:02.400]  And when we can bring them out,
[02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:05.400]  we can stop the disinformation campaign
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:06.600]  because people are sitting there
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:09.920]  in their comfortable chairs, listen to Fox News,
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:11.400]  thinking there's some out of the mid-Romney
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:13.440]  or somebody else is gonna overthrow Obama
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:14.600]  and we're gonna get America back.
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:18.200]  We've got to take down that part of Obama's profits.
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:19.880]  And we have got to attack him.
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:22.760]  And then we can go after him economically.
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:23.600]  Now you're right.
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:25.520]  It's the idea of the loyal opposition.
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:28.520]  When those guys are all part of the same power structure
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:32.560]  and they're also scared, I mean, those big people,
[02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:34.240]  it's really hard people that are already part
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:35.640]  of the system to stand up.
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:37.840]  But look at how they're gonna ever Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.
[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:41.240]  You can always tell who's real by who they attack.
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:42.320]  You absolutely can.
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:45.880]  And I think that if we began to work on that strategy
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:48.480]  and look at how the politicians are attacked
[02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:49.680]  and look at what Fox News does
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:52.640]  or what the liberal or what MSNBC does,
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:56.680]  if we began to consider that if we're going to have a revolution,
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:19:59.240]  let's do it the way Obama has taken the nation.
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:00.080]  He has taken the power of...
[02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:01.400]  Stay there, Fox News.
[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:02.360]  Yeah, this is intriguing.
[02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:03.200]  Vassar...
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:04.040]  The facts are in.
[02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:05.400]  The studies are legion.
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:07.960]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members
[02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:10.600]  of the fluoride family are devastating the health
[02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:12.920]  and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:16.680]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:19.280]  Simple, dumb down the host population
[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:22.080]  that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:24.080]  We may not have been able to get fluoride
[02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:25.520]  out of the water supply yet,
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:27.760]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:29.800]  I am extremely excited to announce
[02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:33.360]  the exclusive InfoWars Life fluoride shield formulation,

[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:44.120]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:46.120]  Let's take a stand against the globalist
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:48.640]  by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:50.800]  I use fluoride shield every day.

[02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:07.480]  This is a short segment, and then we have Pastor James David
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:20.800]  Manning joining us for part of the next, and then we have
[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:31.200]  a bunch of big news I've got to get to, but I'll tell you,
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:34.480]  if I lived in Harlem, I know whose church I'd be going to.
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:36.200]  If we had more preachers in this country,
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:38.640]  like Pastor Manning, we would not be in the shape we are.
[02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:40.520]  People have just become so complacent,
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:43.040]  they've got to find their spirit of resistance
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:45.240]  before things really go to hell in a hand basket
[02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:49.200]  because Homeland Security is a big part of the system.
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:52.320]  There's Homeland Security, all of these top generals
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:54.520]  and colonels at the Navy War College,
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:56.880]  the Army War College, you name it, West Point.
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:58.680]  We have links to it up on inforwars.com.
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:01.160]  We're saying we're preparing for war with gun owners.
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:02.800]  We're going to come after you.
[02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:05.000]  We will take your gun from your cold dead hand.
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:06.600]  And the military is totally waking up
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:09.400]  because they're being told prepare for war with America.
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:11.240]  So I think they've miscalculated.
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:16.040]  I mean, the military is not afraid to go to war.
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:20.400]  And I mean, the military people I know that are multi-generation
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:24.000]  military are the most honorable people in my family.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.080]  And let me tell you, they're not looking for a fight, folks.
[02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:27.440]  They're very sad about everything.
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:30.400]  But now the resolve is beginning to be, OK,
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:33.520]  it's going to be a civil war.
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:35.640]  Just feel sorry for the police and all the idiots.
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:37.920]  They're going to be part of the New World Order who
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:39.400]  want to have this civil war.
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:40.880]  I mean, look at this headline.
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:43.080]  Colonel, who vowed to disarm Americans,
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:44.400]  works with Homeland Security.
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:46.480]  He teaches at West Point.
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:49.280]  And it says, oath violating, Colonel also
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:51.840]  made veiled death threats against bloggers.
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:54.240]  Well, my goodness, if you read his article in Esquire,
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:56.120]  it sounds like a little kid.
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:25:57.720]  Like, oh, yeah, we'll kill you.
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:25:58.600]  We got the army.
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:25:59.240]  We're big.
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:00.440]  We're tough.
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:02.760]  I mean, this is obviously somebody who I don't think
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:05.080]  seen a lot of combat or he's nuts.
[02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:06.640]  Because all the combat vets I know,
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:08.160]  and I mean special forces people,
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:11.000]  I mean, people that have been in 28 years and seen stuff.
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.480]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:15.400]  They would never.
[02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:18.280]  I mean, I know people that have worked in and around
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:20.920]  the boys from Virginia, and I don't mean the CIA.
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:23.560]  The Virginia boys are like plain clothes
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:25.800]  military above Delta Force.
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:29.040]  And all I can, Pastor Manning, I've got you here to talk.
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:30.160]  We've got four minutes till break.
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:31.080]  I'm going to shut up.
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:32.280]  You hear what I'm saying.
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:35.160]  This is getting so bad.
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:38.080]  Do you think Obama's bit off more than he could chew?
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:41.200]  Or do you think that this is part of the plan?
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:42.520]  Oh, absolutely not.
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:44.320]  He has not bit off more than he can chew.
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:48.560]  And I think his plan is at place and working right now
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:49.720]  perfectly.
[02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:51.960]  The problem is that we've got to deal with this.
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:55.240]  That we're in the game very late.
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:58.120]  And if there is a military coup, I
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:26:59.840]  know that many generals and people
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:02.200]  within the military who recognize what's happening
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:05.040]  to this nation would love to be able to save it.
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:07.560]  But I don't think they're going to get the kind of support
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:10.280]  that they need in order to be able to do it.
[02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:14.640]  And I don't think that a coup in the military
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:17.800]  would deliver us from the economic power
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:19.520]  that Obama is possessing.
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:22.240]  And there's another thing that we're not observing as well
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:25.080]  in terms of the social and racial issue.
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:28.440]  I'm becoming very concerned about Obama's alliance
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:29.560]  with Pope Francis.
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:34.720]  I'm very concerned about them walking along the same social,
[02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:37.440]  if you will, liberal path that destroys
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:40.800]  the integrity of the word of God and puts these two powers
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:41.320]  together.
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:43.440]  Alex, I'm very concerned about that.
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:45.240]  And whether a military response can
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:47.800]  handle where we are right now.
[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:49.000]  I hear you.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.360]  No, I can't believe that the president has become a dictator.
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:54.960]  And they're starting to have a few hearings,
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:57.160]  but it's still not a big deal.
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:27:59.200]  Because this is what happens historically.
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:01.640]  Countries get to where they put up with evil.
[02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:05.800]  And then we empower the dictator to become a Hitler
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:07.360]  or a Mao.
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:09.960]  Pastor Manning, do you think we can turn this around?
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:10.960]  I'm confident that we can.
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:14.320]  But we must acknowledge this a few moments ago.
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:15.760]  We are late to the game.
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:17.440]  But we have the majority on our side.
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:19.120]  We have the morality on our side.
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:21.600]  We have all of the issues that we need on our side.
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:23.640]  We just need to acknowledge what they are,
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:24.960]  put together a plan.
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:26.960]  Obama has been planning this with the New World Order
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:28.000]  and other three years.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:29.120]  We are late to the game.
[02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:30.400]  We're just getting in here.
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:31.240]  But we can win.
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:32.840]  And we can win hand-delete.
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:34.320]  There's no way we should be defeated.
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:36.000]  So yes, but we need to get started.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.080]  We need to get started immediately,
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:39.680]  if not beyond before that.
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:43.480]  Well, you say, not use their tactics,
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:45.240]  but beat them knowing their game.
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:46.400]  I mean, what's your idea?
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:47.600]  Well, first of all, as I said before,
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:49.280]  we've got to take down the media, Alex.
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:52.440]  I mean, we have got to take down what I refer to as the tongue
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:52.920]  hit media.
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:55.680]  Because they've got people pacified into thinking
[02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:58.480]  that Washington Republicans or whoever,
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:01.000]  politicians are going to solve our problems.
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:02.800]  We've got to stop people from thinking that,
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:05.440]  wake them up to the fact that they need to get into the streets,
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:08.240]  not necessarily with arms or with margin,
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:11.800]  but they need to get into the program of looking at what
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:14.440]  can we do economically, socially, and racially
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:16.840]  to bring this nation back together again.
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:19.000]  And once they recognize that Washington is not
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:22.400]  going to solve it, that it must be done by grassroots movement,
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:25.040]  at least we'll have a start at that present time.
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:28.640]  And what we'll also discover is that Obama's power is not
[02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:32.080]  as great as one would think that it is.
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:35.840]  If the people that know the truth simply rise up.
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:37.400]  Sure, well, somebody can kick your butt
[02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:38.480]  if you lay down and let them.
[02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:39.480]  Absolutely.
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:40.560]  We just got to stand up.
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:42.600]  I want to come back and go over some issues with you
[02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:43.480]  and pick your brain.
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:46.320]  Because I tell you, you're just really a smart guy.
[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:48.320]  And I mean that seriously.
[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:52.200]  Pastor Manning has really saw stuff long before I did.
[02:29:52.200 --> 02:29:53.600]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:56.040]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.040 --> 02:30:02.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:04.600]  Introducing Pro 1.

[02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:15.360]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:18.960]  and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:20.760]  Advanced manufacturing technology
[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:23.400]  combines silver impregnated white ceramic

[02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:29.960]  and other heavy metals all in one filter element.

[02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:49.760]  the most common form of fluoride not covered
[02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:51.400]  by other fluoride filter brands,
[02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:53.800]  and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:05.280]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage
[02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:07.280]  of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:31:07.280 --> 02:31:10.400]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:13.320]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism
[02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:15.920]  and every other major disease.
[02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:17.880]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:19.400]  We are what we eat.
[02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:21.600]  Our food is devoid of nutrition
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:24.080]  and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:28.320]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:30.920]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:30.920 --> 02:31:33.640]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist
[02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:37.160]  by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:32:06.080 --> 02:32:08.720]  I'll also enjoy what I have found to be the best tasting
[02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:12.800]  100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[02:32:12.800 --> 02:32:15.240]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains
[02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:17.400]  of Southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers
[02:32:17.400 --> 02:32:19.920]  grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:22.960]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:24.800]  in a highly customized blend.
[02:32:24.800 --> 02:32:28.040]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend

[02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:36.880]  without the headaches and heartburn
[02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:38.760]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:40.640]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee
[02:32:40.640 --> 02:32:43.960]  and it's taken us years to secure connections directly
[02:32:43.960 --> 02:32:45.800]  to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:48.320]  Brought by the site today, order a bag or two
[02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:50.240]  and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:52.680]  Available in original or with our immune support
[02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:55.480]  infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press
[02:32:55.480 --> 02:32:58.600]  all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup
[02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:02.360]  of my favorite coffee available at infowarselife.com.
[02:33:02.360 --> 02:33:15.360]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:23.360]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time.
[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:29.360]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down, sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:31.360]  This is a perfect song for Obama.
[02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:33.360]  For a minute.
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:50.360]  You can see the masterly evil of the establishment grooming Obama
[02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:54.360]  we now know from a very young age, just like it's out of a horror movie
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:34:00.360]  where they're grooming the Antichrist, it's Rosemary's baby.
[02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:06.360]  It really is the stuff of legend, how his whole family, CIA,
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:11.360]  Pastor Manning's had the CIA and FBI come to his office and threaten him.
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:16.360]  We've had the same thing, FBI, Secret Service, you name it,
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:18.360]  all sorts of things behind the scenes.
[02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:21.360]  The minute they can, folks, they want to come after everybody
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:26.360]  and basically force a civil war, that's probably going to be their plan.
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:31.360]  And we just need to not have it happen.
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:34.360]  And again, it sounds real wimpy on air to say,
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:41.360]  you know, I don't want a military coup or I think we should lay down to an attack by these people.
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:45.360]  This isn't about a military fight.
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:51.360]  If we don't respond when they attack us in the first wave of a purge,
[02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:55.360]  even with the controlled press, the message will get out that they did it.
[02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:57.360]  They're not going to do that.
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:35:03.360]  If they try a purge, they will blow up federal buildings filled with daycare children.
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:06.360]  We know the names of who did Oklahoma City.
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:10.360]  I've interviewed the police officers, the head of the canine unit, Don Browning,
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:13.360]  from Oklahoma City. He knew the feds did it.
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:16.360]  They came to his office and he's listed their names on air
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:19.360]  and said, we're going to kill you and your wife if you don't shut up.
[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:24.360]  By the way, I got death threats when I had him on and I mean the real ones.
[02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:29.360]  Because you know the people that did that run the Justice Department right now.
[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:35.360]  And again, I literally, it's like stepping on the edge of a cliff whenever I get on air and talk about this kind of stuff.
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:42.360]  So when I say we need to have restraint, it's not that I'm not willing to get in a fight.
[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:48.360]  It's not going to hurt the New World Order to have a shootout with the state police.
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:52.360]  Before we're going to kill these people, we really need to go out and try to wake them up.
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:36:00.360]  That's the point and that's what Manning's getting at is we have got to absolutely reach out to police and military right now.
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:05.360]  The military is really woken up. Police are starting to, but they kind of pick them to where they'll follow orders.
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:08.360]  So that they see the rest of the story and get uncompartimentalized.
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:12.360]  Now Manning, Pastor Manning, I want to give you the last six, seven minutes here.
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:14.360]  You've got the floor. Don't pause for me.
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:18.360]  Any other ideas? How we turn this around? Where you see this going?
[02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:24.360]  Maybe citizens that are at Obama events yell out things.
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:31.360]  Little stuff like you're a liar in Congress. We don't know. There's all sorts of little things that could bring down the facade.
[02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:39.360]  When we talk about a coup and a military confrontation, we have to keep in mind that Obama comes from a very violent background,
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:42.360]  though he tries to present himself as the boy next door.
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:48.360]  Obama's the product of Bill's heirs and Bernadine Dorn and all that weather on the underground crowd.
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:52.360]  He comes from a very violent background. Keep that in mind.
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:56.360]  His association with Islam is very violent.
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:04.360]  But I think in terms of strategy, Alex, one of the things that we probably would look at after we take down the media
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:08.360]  and we need to do that because without that we're going to be continually beat by Obama.
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:12.360]  We need to go after Obamacare. That is McKinley's heel.
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:20.360]  It's a massive tax program that's unconstitutional, that's socialist, that's communist at its core.
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:25.360]  But he needs young people to be able to register and be a part of that process.
[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:29.360]  If young people don't register, Obamacare falls apart.
[02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:34.360]  Now the whole business with the rollout and the fact that the computer did not work,
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:37.360]  they're going to get that together at some point in time.
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:43.360]  But if we can go out and launch a national campaign with a broadcast such as yours and others
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:50.360]  to reach young people that they don't sign up, that they're not cowed into signing up for Obamacare,
[02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:53.360]  if that can happen then the whole thing falls apart.
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:59.360]  Because at that point Obama would not have the financing to be able to keep Obamacare alive.
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:04.360]  And what he'll have to do at that point is do something more dictatorial than he's doing right now.
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:09.360]  So I would suggest that what we would do with number one is take down the media.
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:11.360]  Number two is take down Obamacare.
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:18.360]  And doing it through the people, pardon me, doing it through the young people who don't want Obamacare
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:21.360]  and then turning them around against him.
[02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:25.360]  Because they were all for him at one point in time, but not anymore.
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:27.360]  And they're definitely not going to sign up for Obamacare.
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:32.360]  If we do those two things, at least we'll begin to put a crack in his armor.
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:37.360]  And we'll begin to educate the people and we can take him down economically
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:40.360]  the way he's trying to take us down economically, socially.
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:45.360]  Again, you pause for me to interject, but everything you're saying is just spot on with the research
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:49.360]  and great ideas and I just thank God for your leadership and many others.
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:53.360]  And I wish there were more people out there who understood all these different nuances
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:59.360]  because it's scary to know people are waking up, but that there's not that many prominent people
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:02.360]  who are willing to come up with a battle plan.
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:04.360]  But let me ask you this question.
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:08.360]  I've noticed evil loves to betray its own minions, historically.
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:11.360]  And I don't understand that as a person that doesn't know betrayal.
[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:15.360]  I don't like betraying even people that are enemies and bad.
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:20.360]  In fact, crushing them feels like a betrayal even though I've not betraying them.
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:21.360]  I'm standing up for myself.
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:25.360]  But with Obama, he loves, I mean, here's an example, Barton Springs.
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:29.360]  Two months ago, you know, so the big open pool, they got like 20 lifeguards,
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:31.360]  one of the biggest natural pools in the U.S.
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:36.360]  Spring Fed and one after the other, they walked over and apologized and they said,
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:38.360]  I thought you were wrong about Obamacare.
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:43.360]  They just cut me from 40 hours to 20 and they take more money out of my check now.
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:47.360]  And I work another job and I go to UT and I eat ramen noodle.
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:48.360]  My parents are poor.
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:49.360]  I don't have any money.
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:52.360]  They're taking like $50 more out of my check.
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:59.360]  Like you said, they lied on the news and everywhere the poor Obama people apologized.
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:03.360]  How could the communist even betray their own idiot followers?
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:07.360]  And I'm not trying to be mean, but it's just how do you hurt poor people like this?
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:09.360]  And how does he think he'll get away with that?
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:17.360]  I think the thing we have to always keep in focus about communism and socialism and Marxism and Islam is that it has never worked.
[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:23.360]  There's no nation on the planet where it has worked, where it has proven to win the love of the people,
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:28.360]  where we in a democracy and capitalism here love our nation for what it is.
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:35.360]  Most communist people that are at the bottom of the communist rung don't care for communism and want to get out from under the beat.
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:38.360]  And it takes the military to keep communism going.
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:41.360]  So I think that when we look at what Obama's trying to do with the New World Order,
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:50.360]  things that they can accomplish however they use more high technology now than they've used in perhaps a mousy tongue or in Lenin's communism,
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:56.360]  we're going to have to recognize that communism really at the heart of the matter with people doesn't work.
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:40:58.360]  So how do we get the message out?
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:04.360]  Rather than talking about a different political ideal such as a Republican versus a Democrat,
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:12.360]  we've got to tell people about the ills of communism. We've got to go into, I think our fourth program would be,
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:18.360]  we've got to get into the universities and then to the schools because that's where they're indoctrinating our young people into thinking
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:22.360]  that communism is a good thing and that Obama's program is a good thing.
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:29.360]  So we have to do these basic things. We win. We don't do them. We definitely lose.
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:36.360]  Well, I want to be clear. I mean, when you see how Obama tries to take the radical Islamist al-Qaeda people from Saudi Arabia
[02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:44.360]  and to inject them into Syria for two and a half years and then call that peace, I mean, it really does show that this particular elite we have,
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:49.360]  I mean, look how the NFL promotes him. Look at how the whole system is giving their power to him,
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:54.360]  showing the power structures behind him. Do you think Obama's paying off the way they thought?
[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:59.360]  Because as you said, if Obamacare is blowing up in their face, well, they knew it was going to blow up in the face.
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:03.360]  So he's got to become a dictator because his whole agenda is going to backfire.
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:13.360]  They're going to end up losing a whole generation to believing in communism because they're giving them a taste of it before they have full dictatorship in.
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:18.360]  Well, if you look at the stock market, Obamacare is blowing up in its face.
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:24.360]  But if you look at the stock market, he is greatly rewarding people that have invested in him.
[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:31.360]  If you're talking about major people in movies or in business and entrepreneurship, they are reaping great rewards.
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:37.360]  The greatest in the history of this nation, they reaping their financial rewards as supporting him.
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:42.360]  But they're just a small percentage of the population and they're not in control.
[02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:49.360]  And it's in fiat devalued dollars and it's not going to be worth anything. It's all a fraud. It's all hot air.
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:54.360]  That's true. That's true. And I think the American people need to wake up and begin to end.
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:43:01.360]  Of course, prepare themselves for when the financial collapse comes and it will come, whether Obama's in power or not, that's coming.
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:09.360]  And that will be another opportunity once the financial collapse comes for those of us who cannot be on the battlefield to take the power,
[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:16.360]  take the power reigns at that time when the economy is weak and people are dependent on their billions to be able to give them power.
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:24.360]  We have power by our commitment. We have power by our love for this nation. We have power by our love for one another.
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:30.360]  That's our power and we're rich in the billions in that and we want to use it as much as we possibly can.
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:38.360]  I agree. I can feel your power, Pastor Manning, because you have love and I can hear it and see it in other people's voices.
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:42.360]  I just feel sad for the average person. It doesn't seem to have any discernment.
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:46.360]  I mean, you could take one look at Obama and tell he's a devil. I just didn't know how bad.
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:51.360]  What in your spirit told you six, seven years ago or even longer that Obama was so bad?
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:57.360]  Yeah, we remember I was on your show very early on and talking to you about Obama being the son of Satan.
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:02.360]  A lot of people call him the Antichrist and that will work. You certainly won't want to throw that out.
[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:10.360]  But Obama is inherently evil. When you listen to what he is saying over against a reality of where we are as the people,
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:16.360]  you know that he is lying and that he is lying profusely. Obama did this one thing, Alex.
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:25.360]  He promised the world, not just America, but he promised the world what they wanted to hear and knew that he could not deliver it.
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:29.360]  He promised the world you were going to have peace and you're going to have prosperity.
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:33.360]  You're going to have a unity of the people. We're going to bring all the nations to the table.
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:38.360]  We're going to have a unity between Muslims and Jews. We're going to have a unity between blacks and whites.
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:44.360]  We're going to have a wealth where everybody has got wealth and power and prosperity.
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:49.360]  He promised that not just to America, but to the world. And that's why people fail for him.
[02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:54.360]  But the opposite of that is to look at that and know that he can't deliver that. He cannot.
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:59.360]  So he's lying. Why would he... Well, he's delivered the opposite. He's delivered the opposite. Absolutely.
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:04.360]  And that's my point. I knew that's exactly what he was going to do.
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:13.360]  So we have to recognize that anyone that would lie like that to be American people into the world has to be ultimately evil
[02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:19.360]  so that he can take away their liberties, take away their freedom, take away their economic base.
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:25.360]  So when you see Obama, when I saw him six years ago in that perspective and talking to things he was...
[02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:29.360]  and saying the things he was saying and denying what I knew to be the truth about him,
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:35.360]  it was very easy to see how evil he was and how people were searching for it, looking for it.
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:43.360]  And you got to also realize that George Bush was such a disaster that they were looking for anything to bring them up out of the bag.
[02:45:43.360 --> 02:45:52.360]  But look at how now that I pull back, I see the elite behind this, but it's even more than they could orchestrate the way it was all orchestrated perfectly.
[02:45:52.360 --> 02:46:01.360]  It really is satanic. Everything we've seen has been orchestrated. As you know, the Bible talks about the mystery of evil, how it works so well together.
[02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:08.360]  And you can really now see on Obama a super evil design, one of the most evil I've ever even heard of in history,
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:21.360]  with a high-tech integration, and I shudder to think what we're going to see out of this figurehead, out of this production, out of everything behind him, out of all the evil behind him.
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:30.360]  I wish you would send me the clip of what you just said. I love to play it on our broadcast every day because it puts succinctly what we need to be aware of.
[02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:36.360]  Now that you've said that and you've demonstrated that truth, how do we educate the people?
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:44.360]  How do we get out there and tell the people we're still hoping against hope that Obama's going to change, that he's going to make the world a great place?
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:54.360]  Even though they see themselves without jobs, they see themselves losing their income, they see themselves losing their family, losing their children, losing this nation,
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:59.360]  and yet they're still hoping that somehow or another that he is going to do what he promised six years ago.
[02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:07.360]  How do we educate people? The small clip you just said just a few moments ago.
[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:11.360]  Well, if you look at it, he's dangling again. It's coming. Hope's around the corner. Give me more power. I'll fix it.
[02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:17.360]  And then they consciously try to wreck the country. It's not like they're screwing things up on accident. They want to screw it up.
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:23.360]  You know they're doing it. I guess you just explained to people that you better follow your gut and your heart and your eyes.
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:30.360]  I mean, the thing is, it's all right there and I think people are afraid of the responsibility. They want to, like you said earlier,
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:35.360]  think that the Republicans are going to save them and they better figure out that praying to God is going to save them.
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:46.360]  Because if people pray to God and repent and get on their knees and seek a reprieve of the nation, then God will change their heart and give them discernment
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:55.360]  and rise them up in little ways but also in big ways, depending on who you are, where you're at. And together, just like evil works through Obama and his people,
[02:47:55.360 --> 02:48:02.360]  we have to ask God to use us as vessels against them in this battle. But God knows there's free will, so gives us free will.
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:12.360]  The devil manipulates against free will. We have to consciously and spiritually ask God to cleanse us and use us and sanctify us every day
[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:21.360]  and put on the armor against the enemy. There's an abandoned Bible where there were two prophets, the prophet Elisha and the young protege working with him
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:30.360]  and they were surrounded by a mighty army that were outside of the canyon where they were at and getting ready to come in to kill the prophet at the young man.
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:39.360]  And the prophet, the young boy said they're going to kill us, they're going to kill us. The prophet prayed that the young boy's eyes would be open
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:46.360]  so he could see the mighty host of angels that were standing there to protect him against that mighty army.
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:56.360]  And the angels are certainly going to win an overpowered army. What you have just said and what we've got to do is that we've got to pray that God will open the eyes of the people
[02:48:56.360 --> 02:49:08.360]  so they can see how evil Obama is. And you made mention of the Second Chronicle 714 that if we pray and repent that God will heal our land.
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:17.360]  But beyond that, I am convinced, Alex, that if we launch a campaign of praying for people that God would open their eyes, when they see Obama,
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:29.360]  they will see unadulterated evil in its purest and most evil form. There's never been anybody in America in leadership as evil as this man is.
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:37.360]  And of course, his beauty dazzles everybody and so therefore they're not able to get to the core of who he is spiritually.
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:44.360]  People's eyes just need to be open to how evil this man is that has taken over our nation and is seeking to destroy it.
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:48.360]  But I will say this, I know we're going to win. God has not established this...
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:49.360]  Yes, Pastor Manning?
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:51.360] ...to give it to Obama.
[02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:54.360]  I just lost audio to the network. Can you guys hear me?
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:55.360]  Yes, we can hear you, Alex.
[02:49:55.360 --> 02:49:57.360]  Yeah, Pastor Manning is still on?
[02:49:57.360 --> 02:49:58.360]  Yes, I'm still here.
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:02.360]  Yes, go ahead and finish up. Pastor Manning, you said that we are going to win and I agree with you.
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:08.360]  We are going to win. God is not going to give this nation over to Obama.
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:15.360]  Even though many people are asserting that well, we've disavowed God. God's turned us over to a reprobate nation.
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:20.360]  But no, that's not the case at all. We are going through some struggles right now.
[02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:28.360]  But we will not lose this great nation. We will not lose this pinnacle of power and presentation of God on this planet.
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:29.360]  We will win.
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:34.360]  Well, Pastor Manning, I think this is the most powerful interview I've ever done with you or heard, period.
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:38.360]  And I think definitely the spirit of the Lord's with us today. Let's just agree together.
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:45.360]  And I'll have you back soon that we should both, to our audiences, promote praying that the eyes of America and the world be open.
[02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:49.360]  And that we say that prayer. And I know I'll say that during the break.
[02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:51.360]  I know you'll say it, Pastor Manning. Thank you.
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:55.360]  Will you stay there and come back and say a prayer on air in the final segment?
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:57.360]  Yeah, if I can do that, I will, sure.

[02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:34.360]  Evil always tells you the idea that it's going to bring you empowerment and individuality
[02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:36.360]  but it really brings collectivism and slavery.
[02:54:36.360 --> 02:54:39.360]  Some of the headlines up on infowars.com are just incredible.
[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:43.360]  Colonel who vowed to disarm Americans works with Homeland Security
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:46.360]  and threatens bloggers.
[02:54:46.360 --> 02:54:49.360]  I mean these people are just roaring with their tyranny
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:51.360]  and you look at photos of this Colonel.
[02:54:51.360 --> 02:54:56.360]  He just looks like a power crazed narcissist.
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:55:01.360]  Also again, Army officer says we will pry your guns from your cold dead fingers.
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:05.360]  Unbelievable. I mean just taunting us.
[02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:08.360]  Mandela Lovefest ignores dark side of legacy.
[02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:12.360]  We've got an article up there about things that I mean it's just a fact.
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:14.360]  They traded one evil for another.
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:17.360]  Homeland Security searches vehicles at Ferry crossing checkpoint.
[02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:21.360]  We've got an article up on drudgerport.com on the right hand side.
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:25.360]  Redlinked or it was redlinked earlier where they're going to make you go through biometric scanners
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:28.360]  and like prison cells at the airport.
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:29.360]  It's all prisoner training.
[02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:31.360]  But Pastor Manning, I'm going to let you get out of here.
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:36.360]  I know you're a busy man, otla.org, A-T-L-A-H,
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:38.360]  world ministries there in Harlem.
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:40.360]  And God bless you for the work you do.
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:43.360]  But please just give us a brief or heartfelt prayer.
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:45.360]  It can be long or whatever.
[02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:47.360]  About opening the eyes.
[02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:49.360]  And I think everybody should say this prayer daily
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:52.360]  and really think about it and tell others about it.
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:57.360]  That the spell, the evil spell of deception be lifted from our eyes
[02:55:57.360 --> 02:56:01.360]  so that we can really, really see good from evil.
[02:56:01.360 --> 02:56:02.360]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:04.360]  And thank you again for having me on your broadcast today.
[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:05.360]  I really, really appreciate it.
[02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:07.360]  But let's go to the Lord and pray.
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:11.360]  Heavenly Father, we thank you so very much for allowing us to be in this great nation,
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:14.360]  to be born here, to be officially born here,
[02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:18.360]  to have our birth certificate here, to know and to be a part of the process
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:20.360]  that has made this nation great.
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:24.360]  We recognize, Almighty God, that it is you that has blessed us against
[02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:28.360]  many of the nations that we see around the world that don't have our joy,
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:30.360]  don't have our prosperity, don't have our love,
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:35.360]  and all the things that you've made such a pinnacle and such a city on a hill.
[02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:38.360]  Now, Heavenly Father, there's a great darkness and deception
[02:56:38.360 --> 02:56:40.360]  that has come over our nation and the person of Obama.
[02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:44.360]  And it is my prayer and I unite with everyone else today
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:48.360]  that an appeal to you to open the eyes of the people,
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:52.360]  open their eyes, Lord, that they might see this awful evil
[02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:56.360]  that is now seated in Washington at the White House,
[02:56:56.360 --> 02:56:59.360]  and then open their hearts, Almighty God,
[02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:03.360]  and give them the courage to be able to stand up for truth
[02:57:03.360 --> 02:57:05.360]  and to stand up for the unborn,
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:08.360]  and to stand up for those that have worked so hard
[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:10.360]  to make this great nation what it is,
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:17.360]  to stand up for those that are being maligned by and duped and tempted by Obama.
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:20.360]  Open their eyes and their ears and stuff their hearts
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:22.360]  full of courage that we might march forward.
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:24.360]  And we are praising you right now for the victory,
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:28.360]  for we know we will not lose, but we most assuredly will win
[02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:30.360]  in the day that you have set aside.
[02:57:30.360 --> 02:57:33.360]  And in your name, Jesus, we pray, amen and amen.
[02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:35.360]  Amen. Absolutely.
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:38.360]  And that's why that particular preacher that had his own prayer breakfast
[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:42.360]  and mildly criticized Obama, they audited him and came after him
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:44.360]  and it came out that it was ordered.
[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:47.360]  And it just shows they're afraid of true men of God,
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:49.360]  true women of God who follow that.
[02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:52.360]  And folks, you know, this is not a preacher's show,
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:57.360]  but in great times of evil, we have to just get down to the very bottom here.
[02:57:57.360 --> 02:57:58.360]  This is a spiritual battle.
[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:00.360]  Pastor Manning, thank you so much for the time.
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:02.360]  Thank you, Alex. God bless you, sir.
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:04.360]  We'll talk to you again soon. There he goes.
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:06.360]  He was only going to be on for 20 minutes. He's very busy,
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:08.360]  but he was able to stay the whole hour with us.
[02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:10.360]  We'll get him back on because we got him on a short notice.
[02:58:10.360 --> 02:58:15.360]  But I tell you, folks, the evil is real.
[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:17.360]  We're going to do a little bit of overdrive and finish some news,
[02:58:17.360 --> 02:58:20.360]  but the 40 seconds out to break, David Knight riding shotgun.
[02:58:20.360 --> 02:58:22.360]  That was a pretty powerful info.
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:23.360]  It was very powerful.
[02:58:23.360 --> 02:58:25.360]  And you know when he's talking about how evil Obama is,
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:27.360]  is just what we were talking about yesterday,
[02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:31.360]  the way he's betraying these people who are at the bottom of the wage pyramid
[02:58:31.360 --> 02:58:35.360]  and at the same time he's taking them down with Obamacare,
[02:58:35.360 --> 02:58:41.360]  he's also putting on saying that he's for their minimum wage being wage.
[02:58:41.360 --> 02:59:10.360]  Explain that.
