[08:00.280 --> 08:07.280]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:31.280 --> 08:49.280]  okay ladies and gentlemen it is Thursday the 14th day of May 2009 and we're scheduled to have multiple journalists from the 2009 Bilderberg group conference in Greece coming up on the show today
[08:49.280 --> 09:02.280]  so stay with us for that and Chuck Baldwin dealing with the bill tying the DHS document anyone the government secretly list as an extremist or potential extremist will no longer have a second amendment right
[09:02.280 --> 09:13.280]  and will have their guns confiscated and will be put on the no gun by list there will no be there will be no way to get off the list no one to contact it's very Kafka-esque it's right out of 1984
[09:13.280 --> 09:24.280]  this is the tyranny look when you start accepting torture of brown people that was a precedent that was so you could be tortured and so you wouldn't have to process and so you wouldn't have rights and liberties
[09:24.280 --> 09:37.280]  every state in the country has used the Patriot Act tens of thousands of times in non-terror related cases it's been used hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of times there is no longer a bill of rights or constitution
[09:37.280 --> 09:48.280]  now the people are not protected lawless criminal corporations have seized control the federal government and are now looting and stealing everything it's really very simple
[09:48.280 --> 10:04.280]  it's very very simple criminals run everything now and they have high tech public relations firms there to neutralize and brainwash the public and go along with all of this
[10:04.280 --> 10:17.280]  there was a story yesterday in the Guardian making jokes about Bilderberg by the author and then there's another article today we got it linked up on prisonplanet.com and he's scheduled to be on the show later
[10:17.280 --> 10:31.280]  and he tried to walk along the public sidewalk and photograph the hotel Bilderberg groups meeting in police ran over with machine guns and arrested him
[10:31.280 --> 10:43.280]  and that's now in the news but the newspaper is kind of reporting on it like he is bad I mean he kind of deserves it
[10:43.280 --> 10:53.280]  it's the same thing when I flew into Canada and they arrested me interrogated me for 16 hours said I was going to Canadian federal prison
[10:53.280 --> 11:04.280]  and sat there screaming at me spitting in my face with pleasure and little black uniform you know monkey outfits I really felt sorry for him and these were sacks of petty trash
[11:04.280 --> 11:18.280]  these were people who live to sit there terrorizing people in customs and that's who they are that's that's what they live for I mean Canadian customs routinely kills people in customs publicly beats them to death
[11:18.280 --> 11:27.280]  God forbid you have autism or be deaf or blind or something I mean they brutalize the living daylights out of you
[11:27.280 --> 11:34.280]  and it remembered that this is the great police who even mainstream national television caught on video
[11:34.280 --> 11:53.280]  police captains directing big burly anarchist and real anarchist I've never seen a big burly one they're usually 150 pounds super pale skin and the you know trust fund kids with tattoos all over them coming off of last night's LSD and whiskey binge
[11:53.280 --> 12:10.280]  no the anarchist we always see attacking cops and knocking out windows are six foot for 250 pounds pure muscle wearing police boots and whether it's England or Denver London England this year for the G20 or Denver Colorado DNC last year
[12:10.280 --> 12:31.280]  Montabello Ottawa Canada last year it's confirmed mainstream news Toronto star Denver Post London Guardian its cops giant cops they always picked the big strong ones thinking that you know they can beat up the other cops and citizens better and then pose for the news cameras and they then
[12:31.280 --> 12:41.280]  put that on the news that that the evil citizens are out breaking things and it was Greece last year during the rioting
[12:41.280 --> 13:00.280]  turns out it wasn't rioting at all there's video we posted it on info wars dot com prison one dot com of the national newscast even admitting well here's police captains directing so called anarchist to then go break out windows and bust up people's cars and attack shop windows
[13:00.280 --> 13:15.280]  and it's all on video as the police in play in uniform direct plain closed officers to pose as demonstrators and go down middle class neighborhoods with sledgehammers busting up car roofs and windshields
[13:15.280 --> 13:31.280]  and came out why did they do that well you had real demonstrators protesting the private banks that are now privatizing and taking over the government bankrupting everything people losing their jobs the nation going into receivership they couldn't have families with baby strollers
[13:31.280 --> 13:50.280]  and fathers out encircling mothers and fathers and good looking families out encircling the banks and saying you're the real government you're the criminals we want to arrest you they they couldn't
[13:50.280 --> 14:10.280]  they couldn't allow that and so they had police fan out all over Athens and every other city and bash out storefront windows and beat up women
[14:10.280 --> 14:25.280]  just like Seattle they had the cops it was actually army in that case I guess they couldn't find cops was delta force commanding hired foundation thugs that's I have three different news articles Seattle Post intelligence or
[14:25.280 --> 14:32.280]  Seattle Times and whatever the other one is it's all in my film police state to the takeover
[14:32.280 --> 14:49.280]  and King news local news the police admitting it and so Bill Clinton had the feds go in and a beat up women they go look at those dirty anarchist beating up women don't worry we're going to fight back against them and they
[14:49.280 --> 15:04.280]  attacked the sixty plus thousand peaceful demonstrators demonstrating against the world trade organization they cannot allow it they want to send a chilling effect I got video of a police running up and tear gassing pepper spraying with huge fire extinguisher sized
[15:04.280 --> 15:20.280]  bottles babies and baby carriages and the mothers are trying to get out in Portland organs that is that case and the woman's like let me out please let me out
[15:20.280 --> 15:35.280]  I have a baby in the cops says listening you effing bleeper to translate you effing female dog you shouldn't bring a baby to a protest
[15:35.280 --> 15:48.280]  now I'm supposed to cozy up with the cops and tell them how great they are and tell them oh I know these are just the bad cops but you know what they got away with that and they got away with shooting the guy in the back on the platform there in Oakland
[15:48.280 --> 16:02.280]  and then lying and saying all the cameras malfunctioned and that the guy had been fighting the police and then just so happen to train it stopped across the other side of the platform and videotape with a cell phone camera
[16:02.280 --> 16:13.280]  the guy in handcuffs being executed and then beat up after they shot him in the back cops roughening up like they throw a tent for tantrum that they that the cops gun have gone off and he executed him
[16:13.280 --> 16:29.280]  and so they grab everybody cell phones on video but that's all on video and then lying and saying all the cameras malfunctioned and it turns out there's three different first it was one and two down three different squad cars that picked up these two black men being shot and killed
[16:29.280 --> 16:40.280]  in their car here in Austin few days ago but don't worry the police chief has been in our studio twice he says all the squad car video cameras malfunctioned
[16:40.280 --> 16:48.280]  I guess though there's no cell phone video of this or there isn't cell phone video of it out yet
[16:48.280 --> 17:03.280]  so I you know maybe our days of data is telling the truth maybe the squad car video cameras really were all turned off in three squad cars first it was one then two now three I mean maybe that is what happened
[17:03.280 --> 17:07.280]  I'm she in fact that's probably the truth everything's fine
[17:07.280 --> 17:13.280]  and then we get the calls here at the office well these guys were probably out robbing people
[17:13.280 --> 17:27.280]  you know they were in a car at night well by that logic if you get hungry at 1am after watching a movie you know the late night movie and drive up to 711 to buy a blue bell Dutch chocolate pint of ice cream
[17:27.280 --> 17:38.280]  maybe cops should kill you I mean maybe they were out stealing but the point is is that they were executed and now it looks like there's a cover up going on
[17:38.280 --> 17:48.280]  and I mean every day ladies and gentlemen I see these videos and we air maybe once a week here we're not trying to put the cops in bad light believe me or you'd hear a lot more
[17:48.280 --> 17:55.280]  there's scores of things I could cover every day and I'm frankly sick of it I wish it wasn't this way
[17:55.280 --> 18:06.280]  you know where they shoot some kids some nine year old kid off his bike as he has a yellow plastic gun and the cops make excuses about it
[18:06.280 --> 18:11.280]  you know I remember one time cop pulled me over out of weight belt in the front seat he pulled a gun out almost blew my head off
[18:11.280 --> 18:18.280]  now he apologized and let me go and said my weight belt scared him
[18:18.280 --> 18:23.280]  but still I almost got my head blown off
[18:23.280 --> 18:31.280]  I mean you know where is all this going look I'm digressing here I'm all over the map it is true
[18:31.280 --> 18:36.280]  and I've just got incredible news and information here in front of me and that's the problem there's just too much of it
[18:36.280 --> 18:40.280]  I am in overload right now
[18:40.280 --> 18:46.280]  I know this as a society we are at a crossroads
[18:46.280 --> 18:54.280]  as a society we are at a historic crossroads
[18:54.280 --> 19:03.280]  and the choice is clear we're going into deep tyranny a technocratic cybernetic technocracy
[19:03.280 --> 19:14.280]  with drone aircraft and drone hovercraft and drone tanks and robots with weapons patrolling the streets of Tokyo and New York City
[19:14.280 --> 19:21.280]  I mean that's all being announced and set up right now and no it's not Terminator 4 or 5 or whatever it is
[19:21.280 --> 19:25.280]  Skynet is already in place
[19:25.280 --> 19:33.280]  but Skynet hasn't been taken over by the evil machines Skynet is run by evil humans who want robots that'll do what they're told
[19:33.280 --> 19:39.280]  and carry out all sorts of evil to where the military isn't even needed anymore
[19:39.280 --> 19:47.280]  and they've already got biological androids brainwashed cults psychopaths and sociopaths that they've hired out of the military for black ops
[19:47.280 --> 19:52.280]  and they're replacing you now with the Terminators
[19:52.280 --> 19:58.280]  they've even got some robots called Terminators going back 30 years
[19:58.280 --> 20:18.280]  and they've got some robots that they've hired out of the military for black ops and they've got some robots called Terminators going back 30 years

[23:39.280 --> 23:43.280]  In times like these, we can't trust the government to keep our seeds safe

[24:19.280 --> 24:40.280]  Wake up boys, there's a light at the window. I can hear someone knocking on the door. There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet
[24:40.280 --> 24:56.280]  And they whisper the word, avalice. There are men coming down from the valleys. There are tall ships flying off the coast
[24:56.280 --> 25:05.280]  And they carry the light in the dark of the night like a whisper in the wind
[25:05.280 --> 25:20.280]  Avalice. Bring my gun and a hand full of silver. By the sea we will gather for the fight
[25:20.280 --> 25:40.280]  It's been so many years, so many tears. We have lost once before, now we'll sell the score, when our cannons will roar revolution
[25:50.280 --> 26:06.280]  Watch and wait. Get ready for the sign. There are many here among us now. Oh, I've not seen the light. We must sing the word to all the people in the land
[26:06.280 --> 26:22.280]  Go to every hill and mountain, for the time is not hand to light of fire. Light of fire. Light of fire.
[26:22.280 --> 26:30.280]  Light of fire.
[26:30.280 --> 26:42.280]  Let us march on the road of the rocky hill tonight. Under cover of the darkness we will slip behind the lines and we will take the men who have stolen our land
[26:42.280 --> 26:56.280]  For the years of domination, get them right between your eyes. And light of fire. Light of fire. Light of fire.
[26:56.280 --> 27:12.280]  They will change the world.
[27:26.280 --> 27:42.280]  Light of fire.
[27:42.280 --> 27:54.280]  Light of fire.
[27:54.280 --> 28:12.280]  Roll away the dawn. Roll away the dawn and let me see the land of the free. Has anything changed at all?
[28:12.280 --> 28:28.280]  Sweet liberty. Sweet liberty. Sweet liberty. That's right. When you've been enslaved, ladies and gentlemen, you value liberty. You want liberty.
[28:28.280 --> 28:42.280]  But when you've had liberty for so long and don't appreciate it, you don't even recognize tyranny when it replaces liberty until the boots start stomping on your face.
[28:42.280 --> 28:52.280]  And by then your teeth are knocked out. You've bitten half your tongue off. Your eyes are swell shut. You can't even fight back. Now is the time to resist like never before.
[28:52.280 --> 29:02.280]  Ran a little bit of that song because we're working on news stories and other issues here behind the scenes as they develop, as they unfold.
[29:02.280 --> 29:14.280]  We got Jim Tucker coming up in 30 minutes and then we got Charlie Skelton, Bilderberg, writer for the London Guardian coming on, who got detained, arrested, came out.
[29:14.280 --> 29:23.280]  He started grabbing him, pointed machine guns at him according to his description and photos that others took of this happening. They're all up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[29:23.280 --> 29:29.280]  Bilderberg 2009 is going on right now.

[31:00.280 --> 31:12.280]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[31:12.280 --> 31:19.280]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[31:19.280 --> 31:37.280]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[31:37.280 --> 32:01.280]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[33:05.280 --> 33:22.280]  I hear the train coming, it's rolling around the bed, and I ain't seen the sun shining since I don't know when I'm stuck in bowls and prisons, and time keeps dragging on.
[33:22.280 --> 33:46.280]  But that train keeps rolling all down the San Antonio. When I was just a baby, my mama told me, son, always be a good boy. Don't ever play with guns, but I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.
[33:46.280 --> 33:55.280]  When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry.
[33:55.280 --> 34:09.280]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. And I am going to be opening the phones up here in just a moment.
[34:09.280 --> 34:27.280]  Coming up, we got Jim Tucker from Bilderberg 2009 and Charlie Skelton, one and Guardian reporter who got grabbed by a machine gun-wielding police, or dare trying to walk down the public beach hundreds of yards away from the Bilderberg Hotel, the meeting place this year.
[34:27.280 --> 34:35.280]  They're in Greece right outside Athens. So that is your good old New World Order.
[34:35.280 --> 34:50.280]  Here is some of the news I have in front of me in the stack today. U.S. foreclosure filings hit record for second month. Obama considers detaining terror suspects indefinitely.
[34:50.280 --> 35:05.280]  The Obama administration is weighing plans to detain some terror suspects on U.S. soil indefinitely and without trial as part of a plan to retool military commission trials that were conducted for prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
[35:05.280 --> 35:20.280]  A call being floated with members of Congress is another indication of President Barack Obama's struggles to establish his counterterrorism policies, balancing security concerns against attempts to alter Bush administration practices.
[35:20.280 --> 35:32.280]  He is harshly criticized. So he's harshly criticizing it, but he's going to continue all of it, as we told you. His executive order said that three months ago.
[35:32.280 --> 35:41.280]  Right when he got in office, boom, first thing he did was say it all continues, but we might close Guantanamo.
[35:41.280 --> 35:50.280]  That's like if the cops came to somebody who owned, you know, 100 speakeasies back during prohibition.
[35:50.280 --> 36:03.280]  And they came to him and said, you know what? You got to close these speakeasies. They said, okay, I'll think about closing one of them maybe in the next year.
[36:03.280 --> 36:16.280]  And they said, yeah, that's good. Think about closing one of your 100 speakeasies. These aren't speakeasies. These are people in a basement listening to live music and drinking gin and tonics.
[36:16.280 --> 36:22.280]  And this, ladies and gentlemen, is secret arrest and torture.
[36:22.280 --> 36:33.280]  And you had this big sales job by the media of these are all terrorists. We can't give them trials. We can't give them rights. Yeah, we need to torture them because they're all guilty.
[36:33.280 --> 36:42.280]  They're all terrorists. And then now they use that precedent of the American people. Hey, you're guilty and will never be proven innocent.
[36:42.280 --> 36:51.280]  That's worse than guilty until proven innocent. We're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, but now they've gone to guilty until proven innocent.
[36:51.280 --> 36:59.280]  And now, you know what? We're not even going to give you a chance. We're not going to tell you what it is you did wrong. You're on a no fly list.
[36:59.280 --> 37:08.280]  A million plus Americans and growing. And you know what? Now you're on a no gun list.
[37:08.280 --> 37:16.280]  Right. You're now on a no gun list.
[37:16.280 --> 37:30.280]  Now you can't buy a firearm or have your firearms and we won't tell you what agency did it or why or what it is you did wrong.
[37:30.280 --> 37:41.280]  You're just guilty, period. And yeah, we're going to arrest you if somebody says you hurt their feelings with the cyber bullying act says hurt somebody's feelings.
[37:41.280 --> 37:45.280]  They sign an affidavit saying it.
[37:45.280 --> 37:51.280]  And your second amendment's gone. I mean, what comes next?
[37:51.280 --> 38:00.280]  So see, they get you to sign on to persecuting a minority first. Isn't that what Hitler did? Stalin did that.
[38:00.280 --> 38:07.280]  Let's you'll pick the rich people, because it was really the rich running Stalin sickening the poor on the middle class.
[38:07.280 --> 38:12.280]  And the middle class was Ukrainian farmers that might own two, three acres and live in a shack.
[38:12.280 --> 38:16.280]  But they were able to feed themselves and that was rich compared to the Russian peasants.
[38:16.280 --> 38:22.280]  And they hired the Russian peasants, gave them fancy black uniforms and said, we're going to send you to Ukraine.
[38:22.280 --> 38:27.280]  We're going to send you into Poland. We're going to send you to all these different satellites and you're going to just kill and take whatever you want.
[38:27.280 --> 38:31.280]  And you know what? They found a lot of Russian peasants that were ready to do it.
[38:31.280 --> 38:39.280]  And you know what? They're hiring the peasants right now and giving them Homeland Security badges and guns and they're ready to do it here.
[38:39.280 --> 38:46.280]  Oh, we're just taking the Ukrainians rights. We're just taking rich Russians rights. We're just taking people that work for the Tsar's rights.
[38:46.280 --> 38:49.280]  Same thing in the French Revolution.
[38:49.280 --> 38:57.280]  Those were mob rule situations where the establishment kind of rode the wild beast of the angry horde was different here.
[38:57.280 --> 39:15.280]  In the Russian Revolution, it was the Republic where one percent, where one percent,
[39:15.280 --> 39:20.280]  one percent of the population had the same rise as 99 percent.
[39:20.280 --> 39:27.280]  And in democracy, as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin so eloquently stated, two wolves and a sheep voting on once for dinner.
[39:27.280 --> 39:33.280]  Fifty-one percent say 49 percent are slaves. It happens.
[39:33.280 --> 39:38.280]  We are not a democracy. We are a constitutional republic.
[39:38.280 --> 39:49.280]  That's why they sit there and preach like it's a sacrament, a religious dogma.
[39:49.280 --> 39:54.280]  Democracy, democracy, democracy, democracy, democracy, democracy, democracy.
[39:54.280 --> 40:01.280]  When all the founders said it was the worst form of government.
[40:01.280 --> 40:07.280]  Nazi Germany was a democracy. They used a democracy to set up what they then did. Then they brought in pure tyranny.
[40:07.280 --> 40:12.280]  Democracy has always lead to some of the worst forms of tyranny.
[40:12.280 --> 40:20.280]  They had the philosopher kings. Occasionally in history, you would get a king who really wanted to build big things and educate the public and empower their people.
[40:20.280 --> 40:28.280]  Generally, though, so they had the most powerful nation to invade others. It was usually smart empires did that and then would make a deal with the public.
[40:28.280 --> 40:38.280]  We're all going to make you functionaries over the captured lands and then they would domesticate those people, kind of build them up, give them some liberty and move on to the next.
[40:38.280 --> 40:54.280]  Always the backwards little thug fiefdoms were run where the king didn't trust his own people to be armed and had a small coterie of armed enforcers.
[40:54.280 --> 41:01.280]  And those were always the bankrupt tyrannies.
[41:01.280 --> 41:08.280]  But the most beautiful system is the constitutional republic.
[41:08.280 --> 41:13.280]  And we have been the model of liberty and now we are the model of tyranny.
[41:13.280 --> 41:17.280]  All right, I'm digressing. See, that's just one article and I could do a two hour dissertation on it.
[41:17.280 --> 41:21.280]  Obama considers attaining terror suspects indefinitely. He considers it.
[41:21.280 --> 41:34.280]  Obama's executive order says signed in late January. I guess three and a half, four months ago now, times flying.
[41:34.280 --> 41:44.280]  Let's see. Now it's the introduction of the public first. Oh, I'm going to release more torture photos, but these aren't the as extreme as the ones at Abu Ghraib.
[41:44.280 --> 41:56.280]  Well, the Abu Ghraib admittedly were the least offensive. Congress admits on record. Members of Congress are on record saying it is people being beaten to death, wives being raped in front of their husbands,
[41:56.280 --> 42:04.280]  children being raped in front of their parents and fathers made to rape their sons.
[42:04.280 --> 42:15.280]  Source, Salon magazine, New Yorker magazine, Associated Press Reuters, MSNBC, Army's own report, the Tagumbu report.
[42:15.280 --> 42:23.280]  So see, but that came out in the news and then they released, oh, here's a guy with a dog biting him.
[42:23.280 --> 42:29.280]  Are people with neck and the dog pile or somebody standing on a box with wires in their hands?
[42:29.280 --> 42:41.280]  You know, seems bad, sounds bad, but is that anything compared to the videos and photos of families?
[42:41.280 --> 42:54.280]  Families being put through hellraiser level stuff.
[42:54.280 --> 43:08.280]  I mean, it's come out all over the news that they have CIA psychiatrist there and they say, oh, yeah, we do all this horrible sexual abuse, but it's only to get the answers to save Americans.
[43:08.280 --> 43:17.280]  I mean, you think a government that'll do that wouldn't stage a 9-11 attack wouldn't stage a Gulf of Tonkin wouldn't stage the terror attacks and Iran 53 that are declassified wouldn't.
[43:17.280 --> 43:25.280]  You think an army field manual 2004 how to stage terror attacks that they give every army captain and special ops and psych warfare.
[43:25.280 --> 43:31.280]  I mean, it's standard operating procedure.
[43:31.280 --> 43:35.280]  SOP.
[43:35.280 --> 43:38.280]  It's SOP.
[43:38.280 --> 43:53.280]  I'm not weak minded, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to sit here.
[43:53.280 --> 43:57.280]  I'm not going to sit here.
[43:57.280 --> 44:01.280]  And go along with all of this.
[44:01.280 --> 44:07.280]  I'm not going to sit here.
[44:07.280 --> 44:11.280]  And let them play their mind games with me.
[44:11.280 --> 44:13.280]  I mean, do you don't you want to control your own minds?
[44:13.280 --> 44:16.280]  Don't you want to be your own men and women out there?
[44:16.280 --> 44:26.280]  Don't you silly fake mainline conservatives that are sucking from the mammary gland of the New World Order whore, sucking down pure soul killing lies?
[44:26.280 --> 44:29.280]  Don't you want to be real patriots?
[44:29.280 --> 44:32.280]  Don't you really want to know how the world works out of being ignorant?
[44:32.280 --> 44:35.280]  They sold you on torture.
[44:35.280 --> 44:44.280]  They sold you that that was Jack Bauer and getting tough and Homeland Security years after I pointed it out and it sounded ridiculous at the time.
[44:44.280 --> 44:46.280]  I said, this is a government production.
[44:46.280 --> 44:49.280]  The government's putting us out to sell you on torture and secret arrest.
[44:49.280 --> 44:57.280]  And then now they have Homeland Security parties on C-SPAN thanking 24 and saying it's selling their whole agenda.
[44:57.280 --> 44:59.280]  Of course it is.
[44:59.280 --> 45:05.280]  And all these other shows where they torture people's children to get the answers.
[45:05.280 --> 45:13.280]  And in the end, Jack Bauer did the right thing and saved America from a nuke.
[45:13.280 --> 45:25.280]  Well, I'm reading law enforcement magazines in 99-2000 that every issue had little situational ethics brainwashing articles about antrashes going to be released on Chicago and kill tens of thousands.
[45:25.280 --> 45:29.280]  Do you torture the terrorist six-year-old son in front of them?
[45:29.280 --> 45:36.280]  Well, we talked to veteran former Navy SEAL who says yes.
[45:36.280 --> 45:52.280]  Selling evil to cops sitting there on stakeouts eating cheeseburgers reading that soul killing garbage.
[45:52.280 --> 46:00.280]  Soul killing garbage.
[46:00.280 --> 46:02.280]  That's what it is.
[46:02.280 --> 46:08.280]  Soul killing.
[46:08.280 --> 46:13.280]  I mean, they get you to join the dark side.
[46:13.280 --> 46:21.280]  Oh, I'm going to torture children because that's how I fight Al Qaeda when Al Qaeda is publicly founded by the CIA in 79 to start the war with the Russians.
[46:21.280 --> 46:22.280]  That's on record.
[46:22.280 --> 46:24.280]  Brzezinski wrote a book about it last year.
[46:24.280 --> 46:27.280]  I guess now two years ago.
[46:27.280 --> 46:28.280]  To attack the Serbs.
[46:28.280 --> 46:29.280]  To attack everybody else.
[46:29.280 --> 46:30.280]  To go into Iraq.
[46:30.280 --> 46:35.280]  Saddam was always trying to kill Al Qaeda in the country saying they worked with the CIA trying to overthrow him.
[46:35.280 --> 46:36.280]  He was secular.
[46:36.280 --> 46:38.280]  Now it's Sharia law back in Iraq.
[46:38.280 --> 46:41.280]  The radical Muslims worked for the New World Order, folks.
[46:41.280 --> 46:43.280]  You try to explain that to somebody.
[46:43.280 --> 46:44.280]  They just can't get it.
[46:44.280 --> 46:46.280]  It's too sophisticated for their little brains.
[46:46.280 --> 46:50.280]  Well, you better get it some of you out there that have been in denial.
[46:50.280 --> 46:59.280]  I don't know anymore.
[46:59.280 --> 47:01.280]  It's just amazing.
[47:01.280 --> 47:03.280]  We're going to keep the secret arrest going.
[47:03.280 --> 47:06.280]  We're going to keep the harsh interrogation torture going.
[47:06.280 --> 47:11.280]  We're going to build more camps and build camps in the U.S. where you have no rights.
[47:11.280 --> 47:16.280]  Oh, and we're going to hold U.S. citizens, terror citizens at these facilities.
[47:16.280 --> 47:23.280]  And I've seen the articles where they're already holding supposed American terrorists now at bases where they have no rights.
[47:23.280 --> 47:26.280]  It's already going on.
[47:26.280 --> 47:29.280]  And the ACLU isn't going to say a word about it.
[47:29.280 --> 47:37.280]  So the way this works is they say, the ACLU, America hating, loving America's enemies, they want to bring America down.
[47:37.280 --> 47:41.280]  Meanwhile, the ACLU doesn't defend gun rights, doesn't defend the unborn.
[47:41.280 --> 47:46.280]  The ACLU is there to create bad precedent to lose cases and to be loyal opposition to pose.
[47:46.280 --> 47:53.280]  And so the right wing can point at them and say, look at them, those anti-Americans, they want our troops to get killed.
[47:53.280 --> 47:54.280]  Look at Obama.
[47:54.280 --> 47:58.280]  He wants to release al-Qaeda in America.
[47:58.280 --> 48:02.280]  And then you look at the thousands of people they hold in these different camps around the world.
[48:02.280 --> 48:07.280]  And even the head of the CIA section chief for Afghanistan wrote a book called John Breaker.
[48:07.280 --> 48:09.280]  We had him on air.
[48:09.280 --> 48:22.280]  Admitting that the army would land helicopters at a Taliban base and load 14-year-olds they'd kidnap goat herders on because they wanted somebody who was completely innocent.
[48:22.280 --> 48:27.280]  Because the Taliban and al-Qaeda are all connected in CIA, MI6, Mossad.
[48:27.280 --> 48:29.280]  It's on record.
[48:29.280 --> 48:30.280]  They can't.
[48:30.280 --> 48:33.280]  Every time special forces caught real Taliban, they were ordered to release them.
[48:33.280 --> 48:40.280]  That was in the times of London and it's in my film Road to Tyranny, first film on 9-11.
[48:40.280 --> 48:42.280]  I released in February of 2002.
[48:42.280 --> 48:49.280]  Those articles are all there.
[48:49.280 --> 48:58.280]  So it's just incredible.
[48:58.280 --> 49:04.280]  Absolutely incredible.
[49:04.280 --> 49:08.280]  And so they would just go grab and give $25,000 bounties.
[49:08.280 --> 49:12.280]  And most of the people are below the age of 20 at the camps.
[49:12.280 --> 49:19.280]  And they've got a taxi to the dark side interviewing the jail guards that beat people to death.
[49:19.280 --> 49:25.280]  And they would beat them taking turns 24 hours a day until their bodies liquefied.
[49:25.280 --> 49:28.280]  Until they liquid, the muscles turned into liquid.
[49:28.280 --> 49:34.280]  And they would describe how they would need, they would have quotas just like the Soviets did under Lenin.
[49:34.280 --> 49:35.280]  They would just have quotas.
[49:35.280 --> 49:36.280]  It was terror.
[49:36.280 --> 49:38.280]  It's called terrorism.
[49:38.280 --> 49:40.280]  See, they say they're fighting terror.
[49:40.280 --> 49:41.280]  They are the terrorist.
[49:41.280 --> 49:49.280]  And they would grab, in one case in that film, what, a 17-year-old just off the street, a taxi cab driver.
[49:49.280 --> 49:52.280]  They grab him, they take him, and they beat him to death.
[49:52.280 --> 49:58.280]  And they call it the, what, elephant pit, animal cages.
[49:58.280 --> 50:01.280]  And there's all the four of the horror.
[50:01.280 --> 50:04.280]  They keep them in rooms with their own excrement and others.
[50:04.280 --> 50:10.280]  And you go and there's blood and chains and metal tin all on the walls and they hang you up.
[50:10.280 --> 50:14.280]  And then you just start beating you and beating you and beating you and beating you.
[50:14.280 --> 50:16.280]  And they know you're innocent.
[50:16.280 --> 50:18.280]  But it's all for the news.
[50:18.280 --> 50:21.280]  It's all to say, we've got terrorists.
[50:21.280 --> 50:29.280]  They, after the low-level thugs have beaten people for months and tortured them, those that survived, they hand them over to the CIA psychiatrist.
[50:29.280 --> 50:33.280]  And they say, we want you to go on the news and say you're a terrorist.
[50:33.280 --> 50:37.280]  We want you to say that you were involved in 9-11.
[50:37.280 --> 50:42.280]  And the ones they find that will really work with them, they say, we want you to do a videotape.
[50:42.280 --> 50:44.280]  Okay, and after you do this, we're going to let you go.
[50:44.280 --> 50:46.280]  And they say, no, I'm not going to do it.
[50:46.280 --> 50:48.280]  And they go, look, here's a picture of your mommy.
[50:48.280 --> 50:50.280]  We got her held at a facility.
[50:50.280 --> 50:52.280]  And we're going to kill your mommy.
[50:52.280 --> 50:54.280]  You're going to do it, aren't you?
[50:54.280 --> 51:23.280]  Yeah, yeah, I'll do it.
[51:24.280 --> 51:53.280]  I'll do it.
[51:53.280 --> 52:02.280]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here.
[52:02.280 --> 52:07.280]  I'm sitting on a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.

[52:59.280 --> 53:00.280]  The bailout group.
[53:00.280 --> 53:02.280]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[53:02.280 --> 53:08.280]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[53:08.280 --> 53:09.280]  but the symptoms are there.
[53:09.280 --> 53:14.280]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[53:14.280 --> 53:17.280]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[53:17.280 --> 53:23.280]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[53:23.280 --> 53:25.280]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[53:25.280 --> 53:27.280]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[53:27.280 --> 53:32.280]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[53:32.280 --> 53:34.280]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[53:34.280 --> 53:42.280]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[53:47.280 --> 53:50.280]  That's 866-295-5305.

[54:50.280 --> 54:51.280]  Bottom line.
[54:51.280 --> 54:57.280]  They tried to sell the public on torture, both secretly harassed and on no rights.
[54:57.280 --> 55:08.280]  And some of the public got sold on it and now the very same right wing, fake right wing listeners, Rush Limbaugh and everybody are squealing and yelling,
[55:08.280 --> 55:13.280]  Michael Savage, who I heard repeatedly and I would maybe listen ten times.
[55:13.280 --> 55:16.280]  And every time I tune in I heard it, so everybody must have heard it too.
[55:16.280 --> 55:24.280]  Put anybody who disagrees with the war in a camp because if you're against the war you aid terrorist and we shouldn't have to pay for you when you're in the camp so it'll be a forced labor camp.
[55:24.280 --> 55:26.280]  He said, here's the Sedition Act.
[55:26.280 --> 55:27.280]  He put it on his website.
[55:27.280 --> 55:31.280]  He said, arrest anybody that disagrees with the war.
[55:31.280 --> 55:36.280]  And I told you, you stinker, you fake conservative, you beat Nick from the 1960s.
[55:36.280 --> 55:39.280]  You try to hand it that when that was what the government wanted.
[55:39.280 --> 55:44.280]  And now you're fake conservative who tells us how he's a doctor every other word.
[55:44.280 --> 55:48.280]  Now you're getting banned from England under EU rules.
[55:48.280 --> 55:51.280]  Now they're talking about arresting you.
[55:51.280 --> 55:53.280]  Exactly.
[55:53.280 --> 55:57.280]  That's how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:57.280 --> 56:01.280]  That's how these people operate.
[56:01.280 --> 56:05.280]  Their real target is the American people.
[56:05.280 --> 56:14.280]  It isn't the 14-year-old goat herders or dirt farmers in Afghanistan who don't even have maps, who live in tents.
[56:14.280 --> 56:16.280]  They've done studies of them.
[56:16.280 --> 56:20.280]  Most of those rural people can't even find the U.S. on a map.
[56:20.280 --> 56:33.280]  And they take them and torture the daylights out of them, kill a whole bunch of them and then sell the American people on how it's a great idea and how it's a good thing.
[56:33.280 --> 56:36.280]  Let's go live at prisonplanet.tv right now.
[56:36.280 --> 56:39.280]  I want to go live right now because we got Jim Tucker early on the line.
[56:39.280 --> 56:42.280]  We got him for 15 minutes and I don't want to waste this.
[56:42.280 --> 56:44.280]  So you tell me when we're going live at prisonplanet.tv.
[56:44.280 --> 56:48.280]  Start simulcasting right now.
[56:48.280 --> 56:49.280]  Okay.
[56:49.280 --> 56:50.280]  You guys ready?
[56:50.280 --> 56:51.280]  Give me T minus 10 here.
[56:51.280 --> 56:54.280]  I know we're live on air, ladies and gentlemen, about the simulcast at prisonplanet.tv.
[56:54.280 --> 56:56.280]  I want this to be congruent.
[56:56.280 --> 56:58.280]  You ready?
[56:58.280 --> 57:00.280]  We're going live right now?
[57:00.280 --> 57:01.280]  We live now?
[57:01.280 --> 57:03.280]  We're live at prisonplanet.tv.
[57:03.280 --> 57:07.280]  We just started simulcasting with the syndicated radio show.
[57:07.280 --> 57:20.280]  And I was just making the point before we go to Jim Tucker from Greece outside Athens at Bilderberg 2009 that Obama is now saying that we're going to go ahead and have indefinite detention, indefinite.
[57:20.280 --> 57:25.280]  See, they sell the public on tyranny for foreigners and no rights when it's really for the American people.
[57:25.280 --> 57:31.280]  Now they've introduced the bills to arrest you if you criticize somebody and they say it hurts their feelings in the cyber bullying act.
[57:31.280 --> 57:35.280]  They have this other act with a no fly list for gun owners where you can't own a gun.
[57:35.280 --> 57:41.280]  If the government secretly puts you on like a no fly list type system, I keep telling folks that's what that was for.
[57:41.280 --> 57:42.280]  We'll go over it.
[57:42.280 --> 57:45.280]  But joining us now we're about to go to break is Jim Tucker.
[57:45.280 --> 57:49.280]  And Jim Tucker, it's good to have you here with us joining us from Greece.
[57:49.280 --> 57:55.280]  Tell us exactly where Bilderberg is meeting this year and where you are located right now.
[57:55.280 --> 58:06.280]  Well, they're meeting at the, uh, a spear palace hotel, not a sticker, a spear palace resort, really.
[58:06.280 --> 58:12.280]  As they did in 1993, the security's been stepped up heavily again.
[58:12.280 --> 58:14.280]  This year, of course, there's always heavy security.
[58:14.280 --> 58:19.280]  But this year, Bilderberg spent so much money.
[58:19.280 --> 58:29.280]  One of these places, there's a compound of three hotels with no sticker and two sister hotels, which are really huge luxury resorts.
[58:29.280 --> 58:33.280]  Well, here last time, I could say the one, uh, one of the sister hotels.
[58:33.280 --> 58:39.280]  So Jim, you're saying you haven't ascertained even where they're staying, though the army is guarding one and arrested a London Guardian reporter.
[58:39.280 --> 58:40.280]  Stay there.
[58:40.280 --> 58:44.280]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:24.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:33.280]  Same time tomorrow, Jim Tucker of American Free Press, Cameron Mildeverg for 30-plus years, will be joining us.
[1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:35.280]  They've narrowed it down to several hotels.
[1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:39.280]  There's army and police guarding, several other mails.
[1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:45.280]  Jim Tucker got arrested, detained with one in Guardian by guys with machine guns yesterday.
[1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:47.280]  That's in the front page of the Guardian today.
[1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:53.280]  So we've got Jim Tucker for this segment, a little bit of the next is a meeting, a pooling meeting with the media is going on right now in his hotel.
[1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:54.280]  We've pulled him away.
[1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:56.280]  Okay, Jim, give us the data dump.
[1:00:56.280 --> 1:00:59.280]  Jim Tucker, what's the latest you've got from Mildeverg?
[1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:06.280]  Well, you talked about the Guardian reporter who interviewed me this morning.
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:18.280]  He was one of a large number of reporters who, with cameras, TV type guys, mostly, who were on public land taking photographs.
[1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:22.280]  Cops came up, surrounded them, took their film away.
[1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:27.280]  Many others were helpers, several minutes with the drone guns pointed there.
[1:01:27.280 --> 1:01:33.280]  So all being American Free Press, not this next issue you get, but the one after that one.
[1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:37.280]  So it's been very brutal security, very heavy security.
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:43.280]  Yet there's a lot of reporters here who are pursuing them and we're getting a lot of good information.
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:56.280]  For example, we now know that Mildeverg is telling his little pet weevil Obama to go after U.S. acceptance of the International Criminal Court treaty.
[1:01:56.280 --> 1:02:06.280]  You know the history of that. Mildeverg Clinton signed off on it, but would not submit it to Congress for ratification
[1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:09.280]  when a textbook shouldn't fail by more than 90 votes.
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:13.280]  So Obama's being told to sweet talk, submitted to the Senate for sure.
[1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:17.280]  Wouldn't sign off, but they were scared by the voters who objected so strongly.
[1:02:17.280 --> 1:02:27.280]  And then hope for a more left wing Senate elected in 2010, so that in January 2011,
[1:02:27.280 --> 1:02:36.280]  they can pass the thing late on a Saturday evening, too late for the morning, Sunday morning papers, too late for the morning talk shows,
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:41.280]  and assure them that America could be unaware it would not be reported.
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:44.280]  You could vote for it without wishing your political neck.
[1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:51.280]  Of course, we do about other parts of the agenda in advance. That's the only new thing I've got right now,
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:53.280]  but we're getting a lot of good information.
[1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:57.280]  Daily, I'll have a lot more tomorrow and a lot more before I come home on Sunday.
[1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:03.280]  And we have some people later here until Monday to do some follow-up.
[1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:15.280]  And now that money they spent on security this year to rent a huge resort to keep it empty, and then the other resorts themselves,
[1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:17.280]  the third resort is being renovated.
[1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:21.280]  Can you imagine the big bucks they spend to say,
[1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:26.280]  we'll pay you not to fill up that resort to keep it empty?
[1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:31.280]  Jim, Jim, to be clear, to be clear, what are the names of the resorts
[1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:36.280]  and which one are you honing in on? Which one do you believe is probably the place?
[1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:42.280]  Well, I know for a fact that they're not sick of it.
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:47.280]  Oh, Lord, I always have the trouble of pronouncing it as their hotel.
[1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:53.280]  I know for a fact that they're, you've never seen so many cops.
[1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:55.280]  You always see a lot of cops.
[1:03:55.280 --> 1:04:02.280]  But for blocks away, their mouth hotel is about two and a half miles away.
[1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:06.280]  Okay, so you're saying they hired other giant resort decoys then?
[1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:07.280]  Are you saying...
[1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:08.280]  Not a decoy.
[1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:09.280]  Go ahead.
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:11.280]  Well, it's not a decoy.
[1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:15.280]  They hired it so that they could close the main gate leading to the whole palace,
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:17.280]  all the palace grounds.
[1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:21.280]  So they're still up at the street now.
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:28.280]  That's why they reserve the empty hotel just to keep it empty so they can see it all off
[1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:31.280]  if you're not Bill and Berger, Bill and Berger staff, you don't get in.
[1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:35.280]  So that could be demonstrated the way all the demonstrators are there.
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:37.280]  They're being heavily intimidated.
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:42.280]  But there's also heavy media attention to it.
[1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:44.280]  Jim, we're going to do a few more minutes on the side.
[1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:47.280]  I want to specifically ask you, it sounds like you're saying this,
[1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:49.280]  but we'll get the answer in a couple of minutes.
[1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:53.280]  This is the most security you've ever seen for Bilderberg and his Tim Geithner there,
[1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:56.280]  and parrots, times of London.
[1:04:56.280 --> 1:04:58.280]  They're all admitting it's world government.
[1:04:58.280 --> 1:05:00.280]  They have validated everything we've ever said.
[1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:01.280]  Stay with us.
[1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:05.280]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States
[1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:09.280]  no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:15.280]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:21.280]  The efficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:53.280]  that were not intended for human consumption.

[1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:08.280]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:06:08.280 --> 1:06:13.280]  It's a mistake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[1:06:13.280 --> 1:06:18.280]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[1:06:18.280 --> 1:06:20.280]  interest of the American people.
[1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:22.280]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[1:06:22.280 --> 1:06:24.280]  Yeah, fudged since day one of this election.
[1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:28.280]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:06:28.280 --> 1:06:34.280]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[1:06:34.280 --> 1:06:37.280]  that's fascism.
[1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:39.280]  It's not about left or right.
[1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:41.280]  It's about a one-world government.
[1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:47.280]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:06:47.280 --> 1:06:52.280]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com

[1:06:56.280 --> 1:07:01.280]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:04.280]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic
[1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:07.280]  and political problems facing the U.S. and the world.
[1:07:07.280 --> 1:07:11.280]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:14.280]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation,
[1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:17.280]  manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:22.280]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[1:07:22.280 --> 1:07:26.280]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with doubly-nammled cans
[1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:28.280]  and nitrogen packaging.

[1:07:32.280 --> 1:07:35.280]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months
[1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:38.280]  while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[1:07:38.280 --> 1:07:40.280]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.

[1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:04.280]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:08.280]  The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:08:16.280 --> 1:08:18.280]  We've got about three minutes left for Jim Tucker.
[1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:20.280]  He's going to go back into a press conference.
[1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:21.280]  We've pulled him away from that.
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:23.280]  He's surrounded by media.
[1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:27.280]  Jim, are you saying this is the most in 30-plus years covering this,
[1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:29.280]  the most security you've ever seen?
[1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:31.280]  Yes.
[1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:35.280]  They go from blocks and blocks up and down the road.
[1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:37.280]  And then we have a London Guardian reporter
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:40.280]  just walking on the beach sidewalk, he says,
[1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:44.280]  and they run over with machine guns and throw him in a police car.
[1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:46.280]  Yes, they did.
[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:52.280]  As I said before, that's happened to a large number of media types out there.
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:54.280]  Yes, they did today.
[1:08:54.280 --> 1:08:57.280]  Oh, so they mean business.
[1:08:57.280 --> 1:09:04.280]  Many of the European media guys have been grabbed and held,
[1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:07.280]  guns pointed at them, screamed at them.
[1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:13.280]  Films ripped out, forced to erase their film and stuff like that.
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:16.280]  There will be a lot in the paper on that very subject.
[1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:21.280]  AmericanFreePress.net, when are we going to see some of your first reports on this?
[1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:24.280]  Well, the paper that was being mailed today, Thursday,
[1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:28.280]  will have the report I filed.
[1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:32.280]  Well, this morning your time.
[1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:38.280]  It'll have about 500 word story of what little we've learned in advance of the meeting
[1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:40.280]  and some photographs.
[1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:45.280]  And then the full report will be in the paper that goes to the press
[1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:48.280]  a week from today, but I'm back and watching.
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:50.280]  Good, and we're going to have you on next week as soon as you get back.
[1:09:50.280 --> 1:09:51.280]  You're always gracious.
[1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:55.280]  Andomar at 12 noon, our time at, what time is it in Greece?
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:09:56.280]  8 o'clock?
[1:09:56.280 --> 1:09:58.280]  8 o'clock, yeah.
[1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:01.280]  Okay, now two final questions, Jim, and this is key.
[1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:04.280]  So you've identified the hotel, they've shut down a whole complex though,
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:05.280]  blocks and blocks.
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:10.280]  We're getting reports that Tim Geithner is going to be in attendance
[1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:17.280]  and even the Times of London and others are saying that his schedule is suspiciously empty
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:20.280]  and that this is the final meeting setting up the new banking infrastructure.
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:30.280]  Yeah, well, the guy who was there last year, Secretary of State and Treasury always attend
[1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:36.280]  as he goes through the high official White House and other government figures.
[1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:38.280]  So he's definitely here.
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:49.280]  And Carl Dilt is going to make a speech about how to exploit the economic downturn
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:55.280]  to boost along the U.S. World Department of Treasury.
[1:10:55.280 --> 1:11:00.280]  Now, that's illegal, isn't it, to have sitting government officials at a private meeting
[1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:02.280]  in secret discussing and setting policy?
[1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:04.280]  That's a violation of the Logan Act.
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:07.280]  Yeah, criminal act of the Logan Act.
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:13.280]  A lot of cute little liberals say, well, the Logan Act was passed in 1787 or 89,
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:14.280]  something like that.
[1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:16.280]  Well, sure, they're still there.
[1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:19.280]  It's been amended many times over the years.
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:28.280]  That shows that Congress still favors the Logan Act when they amended it to tighten it up.
[1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:30.280]  But it's not been amended.
[1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:32.280]  It's still the law until it's repealed.
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:36.280]  All right, one last question because London Guardian reporter Charlie Skelton
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:37.280]  was supposed to be on the show.
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:39.280]  He's now in a police station.
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:40.280]  This is breaking news.
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:43.280]  I know you're going to hear this, Jim Tucker.
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:47.280]  But I've got to get this final question in unless your phone line gets lost or something.
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:52.280]  Any other key information from your Bilderberg sources about what is on the agenda?
[1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:56.280]  We know they're pressuring Obama to pass this gun ban treaty.
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:11:59.280]  And Obama's given speeches saying he does want to do that.
[1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:05.280]  Is that on the agenda, the global currency tax, the greenhouse taxes, the carbon taxes?
[1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:07.280]  I mean, what's on the agenda?
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:14.280]  All of that's on the agenda under the program that we did a United World Action,
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:19.280]  a global action on global basis by global government.
[1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:22.280]  That's all on the agenda is being pushed very hard.
[1:12:22.280 --> 1:12:25.280]  And this must be an important meeting if it's the greatest security you've ever seen.
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:28.280]  Jim Tucker, stay there one moment.
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:30.280]  I know you've got to go to that press conference.
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:34.280]  But Charlie Skelton, who was already picked up by police, and that's the London Guardian,
[1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:37.280]  and I thought got out of it, is back in the police station.
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:39.280]  Is he there reporting or has he been arrested?
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:42.280]  I know you want to hear this, Jim, so stay there for a moment.
[1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:47.280]  Charlie Skelton of the London Guardian, have you been arrested again?
[1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:50.280]  Well, I wouldn't say arrested, detained again.
[1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:56.280]  Yes, I seem to be making a habit of this twice now in two days.
[1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:01.280]  Jim Tucker's on the line with us and can get this out to the press conference he's about to go back to.
[1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:05.280]  Jim, do you have any questions for London Guardian?
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:09.280]  You're going to survive, Charlie.
[1:13:09.280 --> 1:13:11.280]  I come quite here.
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:14.280]  Jim Tucker got me out of jail.
[1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:18.280]  Okay, tell us what's happening right now, Mr. Skelton.
[1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:22.280]  I'm being entered into the lookbook again.
[1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:26.280]  Let me just say bye to Jim then. Jim, we'll talk to you tomorrow at noon, okay?
[1:13:26.280 --> 1:13:28.280]  Very good. Good luck, Charlie.
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:31.280]  Talk to you at 8 o'clock your time. Sorry about that. Jim had to go.
[1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:34.280]  Okay, I'm going to shut up. London Guardian reporter there.
[1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:38.280]  And under international law, let me just tell you, Mr. Skelton, in case you don't know,
[1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:40.280]  when they turn their lights on, you're detained.
[1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:44.280]  When they put handcuffs on you or make you go somewhere, you're under arrest.
[1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:48.280]  So they don't ever want to tell you that, though, because when it turns out it was wrongfully done,
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:50.280]  it would be false arrest.
[1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:53.280]  So they play a mind game, a Jedi mind trick of telling you,
[1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:56.280]  we may have forcibly taken you here, but you're under arrest.
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:14:00.280]  Now, you've been falsely arrested. Tell us what happened.
[1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:05.280]  Well, it's rather embarrassing because I'm in the same police here again today,
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:09.280]  who are telling me, I can't believe we're seeing you back here.
[1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:15.280]  And I was saying, I was just trying to photograph the delegates as they arrived at Bilderberg,
[1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:20.280]  which I was doing. I was trying to get a couple of nice arty shots to illustrate my piece.
[1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:22.280]  I'm doing a series of pieces for the Guardian website.
[1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:26.280]  I'm not, you know, I'm not a paparazzi. I don't have a long lens photo.
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:29.280]  They're detaining me because I'm standing at the side of the road with a, you know,
[1:14:29.280 --> 1:14:31.280]  a little 50-pound digital camera.
[1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:37.280]  World leaders, 150, it's now 150 world leaders meeting publicly to set world policy.
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:40.280]  They now brag about it. We've gotten their documents.
[1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:43.280]  And you're evil with one of the biggest newspapers in the world,
[1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:46.280]  what top 10 newspapers, London Guardian, in the world.
[1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:51.280]  You're there and how, and this is the freedom of the EU. Please continue.
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:54.280]  Well, it's a little bit, I keep telling them.
[1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:56.280]  In fact, one of the policemen has been quite sympathetic.
[1:14:56.280 --> 1:14:59.280]  And he said, look, I appreciate that I'm just doing my job.
[1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:01.280]  We're in a really difficult situation here.
[1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:04.280]  And, you know, he said, I said, I hope there's a protest tomorrow.
[1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:08.280]  And he said, you know, it would be good if there was a different voice being heard.
[1:15:08.280 --> 1:15:09.280]  And this is one of the policemen here.
[1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:13.280]  Because, you know, I do appreciate that I'm just being held by local,
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:18.280]  basically local policemen, you know, who have been put in a very difficult situation,
[1:15:18.280 --> 1:15:22.280]  I think, by the sudden dissent of all these people on this time,
[1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:27.280]  you know, relatively small, little Riviera town just outside Athens.
[1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:29.280]  And so I feel a little bit sorry for them.
[1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:31.280]  But I don't feel sorry for the fact that they keep telling me just nonsense
[1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:33.280]  about how I can't take photographs of things.
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:35.280]  And then they still keep withdrawing what they're saying.
[1:15:35.280 --> 1:15:37.280]  And they don't really have anything to say to me.
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:39.280]  They're just going through the motions.
[1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:43.280]  And, you know, the very idea that I'm standing at the side of the road,
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:48.280]  sorry, I'm just going to step to one side, sorry. I'm not going anywhere.
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:50.280]  I'm just telling the policeman I'm not leaving.
[1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:57.280]  It's just slightly bizarre that I'm standing at the side of the road
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:01.280]  taking little arty photographs of Mercedes-Benz as it whisks past.
[1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:04.280]  And then suddenly, you know, there's another seven policemen, you know,
[1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:06.280]  around me, two of them playing clothes.
[1:16:06.280 --> 1:16:09.280]  And they're sort of giving me the whole, you know, what are you doing?
[1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:11.280]  Who's this? Give me your ID? What's all this?
[1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:15.280]  And I'm just thinking, God, you know, you're focusing on the wrong thing.
[1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:16.280]  And I just feel, I do feel...
[1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:21.280]  Well, Mr. Skelton, they're violating the Geneva Convention.
[1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:24.280]  They're violating every canon of a free press.
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:26.280]  They are engaged in criminal acts.
[1:16:26.280 --> 1:16:28.280]  So I wouldn't be so gentlemanly about it.
[1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:30.280]  I mean, because they're violating you right now.
[1:16:30.280 --> 1:16:32.280]  They're violating me. I want you to know that.
[1:16:32.280 --> 1:16:33.280]  Because I'm a...
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:35.280]  I don't think they know what they're doing.
[1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:37.280]  I genuinely, I don't think they know what they're doing.
[1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:39.280]  I don't think they know what's happening here.
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:41.280]  You know, I don't think anyone does.
[1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:42.280]  Well, they've clearly been ordered...
[1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:44.280]  You know, I don't think people in the street know what's going on.
[1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:46.280]  I don't think... I don't think they know what's going on.
[1:16:46.280 --> 1:16:48.280]  All they know is that they've got someone...
[1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:50.280]  Charlie Skelton running away in order...
[1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:52.280]  No, no, no, I just want to make clear here to you,
[1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:55.280]  because I've been in the position you're in for 16 hours before.
[1:16:55.280 --> 1:16:58.280]  Sir, obviously they're compartmentalized.
[1:16:58.280 --> 1:17:02.280]  They've been told arrest, harass, track, trace, tail,
[1:17:02.280 --> 1:17:05.280]  anybody that gets anywhere around the world leaders setting
[1:17:05.280 --> 1:17:07.280]  for the Global Government Conference,
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:10.280]  where they adjust their world government program every year.
[1:17:10.280 --> 1:17:14.280]  So, did you know Jim Tucker's been shot at in Portugal?
[1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:16.280]  Did you know I've been death-threaded?
[1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:18.280]  Did you know my wife's been called up and threatened
[1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:20.280]  when I'm at Bilderberg by them?
[1:17:20.280 --> 1:17:23.280]  Did you know that I've been detained for 16 hours?
[1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:25.280]  And they told me in Canada that if they found
[1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:27.280]  a pin-up girl, a Betty Page,
[1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:30.280]  that that would be legal transfer of pornography.
[1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:32.280]  They searched all three of our laptops,
[1:17:32.280 --> 1:17:34.280]  and thank God none of my staff or I
[1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:38.280]  had even accidentally visited a topless site or something.
[1:17:38.280 --> 1:17:40.280]  I don't know what people have done.
[1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:42.280]  Don't give them the idea.
[1:17:42.280 --> 1:17:45.280]  My point is that these are terrorists,
[1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:47.280]  and they were told to do that by Bilderberg.
[1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:49.280]  They told me they took me off the plane
[1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:51.280]  when I got there and took me into customs
[1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:55.280]  for 15 hours because Bilderberg had called them.
[1:17:55.280 --> 1:17:58.280]  So, I'm telling you, this is a big news story,
[1:17:58.280 --> 1:18:00.280]  that you're a journalist, I'm a journalist,
[1:18:00.280 --> 1:18:02.280]  we're trying to cover this,
[1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:05.280]  we're now in a police station,
[1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:08.280]  but they're obviously letting you...
[1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:11.280]  They're trying to remove me from just being
[1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:14.280]  an interested concern citizen,
[1:18:14.280 --> 1:18:16.280]  which is basically what I hear,
[1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:18.280]  that's what I'm being.
[1:18:18.280 --> 1:18:20.280]  I'm an interested concern citizen,
[1:18:20.280 --> 1:18:22.280]  and I'm taking a couple of photographs on a little camera,
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:24.280]  and they're removing me from the scene,
[1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:26.280]  and it is just obviously this blanket policy
[1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:28.280]  of getting everyone away from it,
[1:18:28.280 --> 1:18:30.280]  keeping the lid on it.
[1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:33.280]  You know, and all these big,
[1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:36.280]  these massive limousines come in with the tinted windows,
[1:18:36.280 --> 1:18:38.280]  and it's crazy.
[1:18:38.280 --> 1:18:40.280]  It's one of the most surreal experiences of my life.
[1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:42.280]  This is the first Bilderberg I've ever been to,
[1:18:42.280 --> 1:18:45.280]  and it's genuinely surreal.
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:47.280]  Well, it's Charlie Skelton.
[1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:49.280]  We're going to skip this break in case they come over
[1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:51.280]  and turn your phone off.
[1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:53.280]  We're skipping a network break, stations.
[1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:55.280]  This is not your break anyway, so it won't matter.
[1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:57.280]  We will take the bottom of the hour local break for everybody,
[1:18:57.280 --> 1:18:59.280]  but we are skipping this break.
[1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:01.280]  Go to JasonPlanet.tv.
[1:19:01.280 --> 1:19:03.280]  Forgive me if I get excited, sir,
[1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:05.280]  but you know, I'm one of these hot-blooded Texans.
[1:19:05.280 --> 1:19:07.280]  You're there for the second time.
[1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:10.280]  Tell us how this arrest happened today.
[1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:13.280]  The one today, I was, you know,
[1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:15.280]  it's getting towards the end of the afternoon here.
[1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:18.280]  I walked up the hill towards the hotel entrance.
[1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:20.280]  I was actually staying away from the hotel entrance
[1:19:20.280 --> 1:19:22.280]  because I didn't want to be arrested.
[1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:24.280]  You know, I thought, you know, I'm going to play it nice and safe today.
[1:19:24.280 --> 1:19:26.280]  I don't want to end up in the police station,
[1:19:26.280 --> 1:19:28.280]  so I was just sitting by the side of the road
[1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:33.040]  by the way, just taking some low shots of the sort of Mercedes wheels going by in case
[1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:36.880]  I happen to get something looking pretty, that I could put on the website to accompany
[1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:44.280]  the stories that I'm writing. And suddenly, you know, a motorcycle cop comes over, a car
[1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:48.680]  pulls up two plain clothes, come out, another police car come out, two more policemen. And
[1:19:48.680 --> 1:19:52.680]  you know, it's getting to be a real thing here. They're throwing a lot of people at
[1:19:52.680 --> 1:19:57.440]  a very small problem. I wouldn't even class myself as a problem. You know, and suddenly
[1:19:57.440 --> 1:20:02.760]  I'm surrounded. And you know, and the pressure comes on, and you know, it's everyone swaggering
[1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:06.760]  the shoulders at me. And it wasn't as bad as yesterday when you know, they were shouting
[1:20:06.760 --> 1:20:10.640]  at me and they were prodding me in the shoulder. And you know, and I really, it was quite,
[1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:11.640]  it got quite nasty.
[1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:13.880]  And whining machine guns at you, you said?
[1:20:13.880 --> 1:20:18.160]  No, they weren't pointing machine guns at me. They had some machine guns there. I mean,
[1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:20.720]  you know, when you're being, you know, when you're being detained and you see someone
[1:20:20.720 --> 1:20:24.960]  with a walking towards you and machine gun, you kind of notice the gun. And it's not
[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:30.480]  nice. And you know, they go to the policemen now, they're two plain clothes off to harass
[1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:35.520]  someone else. And it's just, it's not a very nice feeling. And you know, I didn't feel
[1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:37.680]  a threat in this time because we had
[1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:41.960]  So they took you in a car.
[1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:42.960]  Sorry.
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:46.480]  So they took you then and put you in the police car.
[1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:50.920]  They pressured me into the police car. I don't really know my rights. I have no idea about
[1:20:50.920 --> 1:20:52.160]  this kind of thing. I really don't.
[1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:59.560]  Yes. When armed men of the government are these local police or federal police?
[1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:01.680]  I think by and large, they're local.
[1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:06.480]  Yeah. Okay. Well, when police with guns put their hands on you and stick you in a police
[1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:09.920]  car and take you to a police station, you're under arrest. And I'm not mad at you here,
[1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:13.760]  but I think you're going through some crime stop or some double think here, kind of like
[1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:17.080]  when, you know, Winston's neighbor is being tortured by O'Brien, but he still thinks he
[1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:18.080]  kind of deserves it.
[1:21:18.080 --> 1:21:22.560]  No, you're being violated. They I mean, you keep saying you've done nothing wrong and
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:28.400]  that you're a small problem. They are the problem in supposedly free Europe coming
[1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:34.200]  over and grabbing you. Now, Jim Tucker told us they've arrested a bunch of other journalists.
[1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:35.920]  Have you seen that?
[1:21:35.920 --> 1:21:39.920]  I haven't. No, I've not really had much contact with anyone. Everyone else here today. I'd
[1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:45.280]  breakfast with Jim. But apart from that, I've not really seen anyone. I've just been keeping
[1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:50.440]  myself to myself writing up another, I wrote up the account of last night. And I was actually
[1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:56.200]  going to write tomorrow. Well, tonight I was going to write about just the kind of strange,
[1:21:56.200 --> 1:22:02.000]  surreal and farcical nature of people arriving at in this, in ultimate privacy, you know,
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:06.200]  keeping the windows tinted, keeping the shades down, you know, what on earth do they think
[1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:10.200]  they're going on? What is in their minds? What it's so pathetic that they're having
[1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:14.160]  this kind of pathetic as much as you know, you have different feelings about it. You
[1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:17.760]  might be angry. You might be insulted that they're having this meeting in private. I
[1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:19.400]  kind of find it a little bit tragic.
[1:22:19.400 --> 1:22:25.800]  Mr. Skeleton, Mr. Skeleton, they've stolen 14.8 trillion in seven months of US taxpayer
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:30.080]  money. The global banking ministers are meeting. They've stolen 10 trillion from Europe and
[1:22:30.080 --> 1:22:35.920]  England together. It would be tragic if they didn't control the military. We have Bilderberg
[1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:40.480]  Group, Club of Rome documents, sir. They're calling for world population reduction. They're
[1:22:40.480 --> 1:22:46.920]  calling for world taxes to enslave us and to quote, streamline our lifestyles, lower
[1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:52.720]  our standard of living. They want one child policy. They're meeting their mobsters. So
[1:22:52.720 --> 1:22:57.680]  of course, but they're mobsters that the state and the government work for and protect.
[1:22:57.680 --> 1:23:03.960]  I mean, you've got 150 world leaders, kings, queens, banker heads, government ministers,
[1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:08.800]  meeting in secret, violating the Logan Act, the US ministers, and then you, the London
[1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:13.520]  Guardian. Is it the Guardian in the top five newspapers or is the top 10?
[1:23:13.520 --> 1:23:17.480]  Oh, yeah. I mean, it's one of the big, it's one of the big broadsheets. So it's, you
[1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:18.480]  know, one top five.
[1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:22.840]  No, but I mean, the London Guardian is the biggest paper in Europe. I mean, I know that
[1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:26.440]  because I've been to Europe. No, that's the paper you see everywhere. No, I mean, no,
[1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:27.440]  I mean, in fact, pull up.
[1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:31.320]  I mean, I should just point out, I should point out, I'm not really, I'm not a journalist.
[1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:35.000]  I'm a, you know, I'm a writer. I write, I write jokes about, you know, any White House
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  and for a living, you know, I'm not, I'm a. That's why they sent you because they thought
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:42.560]  you wouldn't be able to recognize what was really happening, but I think you're a smart
[1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:43.560]  guy.
[1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:47.280]  With respect, that's not what happened. I, I was aware that they weren't going to send
[1:23:47.280 --> 1:23:51.400]  anyone and no one was writing about this. So I approached them and I said, you know,
[1:23:51.400 --> 1:23:54.440]  under the cover, you know, of, of wanting to make a few jokes about it. I said, why
[1:23:54.440 --> 1:23:58.240]  don't I go over and cover this? They said, okay, that sounds funny. So, you know, I've
[1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:03.600]  started to be able to, you know, just, I hope in my small way, raise a little bit of
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:07.040]  awareness about this because you would not believe the lack of awareness and the lack
[1:24:07.040 --> 1:24:13.800]  of just basic knowledge or even caring about, about the situation and about, you know, global
[1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:14.800]  power structures.
[1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:17.800]  There is just such ignorance. It's unbelievable.
[1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:20.760]  Yeah. Let me throw this in. They just walked in with a bunch of mainstream articles out
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:24.960]  of Greece, England, you name it. Yes. There are members of the State Department and others
[1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:30.680]  on record meeting in Greece this weekend. So all these Obama people are going over
[1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:36.600]  to Greece, but then the news won't say they're there because it's a felony. Now, Rick Perry
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:42.040]  in 2007, he's the first to ever arrogantly tell the Dallas Morning News he was going
[1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:48.600]  to Bilderberg and he went to Istanbul, Turkey. Now, now, now the article yesterday that you
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:54.720]  were in kind of said you were going to Bilderberg to see if it existed. Let me ask you now,
[1:24:54.720 --> 1:25:02.080]  does it exist? Oh, yeah. Um, yeah, 100. I mean, do those police, 1,000 percent. Do
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:06.880]  those police exist that took you to jail? Well, yeah. Well, I'm calling from the police
[1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:11.480]  station. I, I, you know, how many times I've been in a police station in my life twice,
[1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:15.920]  both times, both days here at Bilderberg. Now, you know, I've never been arrested. I've
[1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:19.400]  never had a crossword with a policeman and now suddenly there. Yeah, but that's what,
[1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:24.200]  that's what Winston Smith upstairs neighbor when he brings them into the cell and he goes,
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:27.720]  they got you too. And he's like, I don't know why I'm here. I must have done something.
[1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:32.040]  I'm sure I deserve it. My son turned me in. I'm so proud of him. I mean, you understand
[1:25:32.040 --> 1:25:36.680]  that that, that that's the level we've reached. I hope, I hope I'm not coming across as that.
[1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:41.400]  I hope I'm not saying I, I've done something wrong here. I'm reading your name. What I
[1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:45.680]  am saying though is that, you know, uh, you know, forgive me if I am, you know, you've
[1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:49.400]  been doing this for years. This is my first Bilderberg. I know I'm a bit naive. I know
[1:25:49.400 --> 1:25:54.680]  that I'm, I appreciate that. Uh, and it has been a, it's been a real eye opener for me.
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:58.600]  And just, it's just been an extraordinary experience. And, you know, and it's made me
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:02.920]  more aware of the seriousness of the situation because there are people here taking this
[1:26:02.920 --> 1:26:06.920]  thing very seriously. So I think everyone should, are they going to let you go? Well,
[1:26:06.920 --> 1:26:11.720]  do you know what? I don't know. They're just sitting about, it's strange. I'm just sort
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:18.160]  of here. I don't really know what. Well, he supports indefinite detention like Bush.
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:21.000]  You know, maybe, maybe this is the last time we'll ever talk to you. Maybe that's just
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  all.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:25.280]  Oh, I don't know. Where, where did Mr. Skelton go? Where did Charlie go? You know, he disappeared.
[1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:26.280]  It's part of freedom.
[1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:28.800]  Well, give my love to mom and dad.
[1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:32.080]  Yeah. Well, hey, in fact, this may be the last time you want to say bye to your family.
[1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:33.080]  Maybe.
[1:26:33.080 --> 1:26:36.360]  I'm not going to do anything for chilling.
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:39.280]  But I mean, you know, this is freedom. I mean, you know, I mean,
[1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:43.480]  Yeah, no, I look, I, I, and this is, I do say on a serious note, this is the first time
[1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:49.680]  I've experienced, you know, in a very, very real, visceral way, the withdrawal of freedoms,
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:55.840]  you know, and, you know, and just the other day, on a slightly, on a related note, I found
[1:26:55.840 --> 1:27:02.520]  out that the EU had stopped a number of, basically limited the number of seeds that you can,
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:06.920]  you can sell legally to members of the public in, in the, in the UK. This is directed from
[1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:10.160]  Europe. So they're limiting the number of seeds. I would, I was trying to buy some heritage
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:14.960]  seed varieties. I suddenly found out I couldn't unless I became a member of a seed club and
[1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:16.880]  I suddenly thought, God, this is it. You know, I might feed him.
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:19.120]  No, we went on air.
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:22.640]  We keep telling listeners that all over, they're buying up the heirloom seeds, putting them
[1:27:22.640 --> 1:27:27.160]  in UN armored vaults. You can hardly get them. They're trying. Listen, there are a bunch
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:33.480]  of US cities in Oklahoma, Oregon, you name it. One of them's a Tulsa, Oklahoma, where
[1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:38.120]  they want to make you a license to have a garden. I mean, we're in a prison, folks.
[1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:41.400]  These people mean business, but I'm sorry. Go ahead about your point about the seeds.
[1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:44.920]  Well, no, it's just that that was, I think that was one of the first occasions where
[1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:52.760]  I suddenly felt the hand of, of, of the EU limiting me as a citizen wanting to do a perfectly
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:57.520]  innocent, in fact, good thing. You know, and I was thinking, this is ridiculous. It's
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:27:58.520]  an absurd situation.
[1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:02.920]  What type of seeds are they? Maybe they could be used as weapons, al-Qaeda. We have SWAT
[1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:08.280]  teams here rating, rating, uh, aloe vera, uh, plantations because it's evil. Uh, it
[1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:14.680]  helps maybe they're protecting me from these terrible things. Maybe, you know, we're laughing,
[1:28:14.680 --> 1:28:19.160]  but it's actually when it, when it comes down to things like DNA, genetics and, and seeds
[1:28:19.160 --> 1:28:24.760]  and, and, and, you know, ownership of water, these are massive fundamental. Sir, for 36
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:30.760]  years, human life for 36 years, they've taken in the UK, Australia, the US, Canada, New
[1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:35.480]  Zealand, your blood at birth. I have the secret documents on this 14 years ago. Now it's mainstream
[1:28:35.480 --> 1:28:39.440]  news. They go, yeah, we take your blood illegally. If you don't like it, we got weapons. Now,
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:43.000]  uh, sir, I'm trying to understand here. We really appreciate you joining us. A London
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:46.800]  Guardian reporter from the police station, uh, there where you're being held. Uh, can
[1:28:46.800 --> 1:28:50.280]  you tell us what police station you're being held in? This is the last time I was saying,
[1:28:50.280 --> 1:28:55.800]  I can't even, I can't even say it's the one that sounds a bit like Vellugamini. The, it's
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:28:59.760]  where the place is. It's the police station local to the, to the hotel resort that they've
[1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:06.480]  taken over for Bilderberg. And tell us where outside Athens. Yeah, it's about 20 kilometers
[1:29:06.480 --> 1:29:10.400]  outside Athens on the, um, Riviera, they call it beginning with V and I can't say it's
[1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:15.000]  the Lugamini or something. And, um, uh, so that's where I am. And, you know, uh, I could
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:18.840]  see that I just sat at the side of the road for a couple of hours just watching the, uh,
[1:29:18.840 --> 1:29:22.920]  from, actually I can see where I was sitting from here, uh, watching the, the delegates
[1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:25.480]  come around the roundabout and zoom in with their police escort.
[1:29:25.480 --> 1:29:29.800]  And so I want to continue to talk to you. We got to take this break back in three minutes.
[1:29:29.800 --> 1:29:34.160]  Can you stay with us? Okay. Uh, uh, Charlie Skelton. But I want to find out, because
[1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:37.920]  this may be a reason to arrest you. I want to find out what seeds, where they care it,
[1:29:37.920 --> 1:29:43.880]  where they tomato, where they potato, because you may get put on a terror list or this guy's
[1:29:43.880 --> 1:29:51.480]  hardcore folks. He's trying to buy seeds. We'll be right back. Oh my God. I'm scared.
[1:29:51.480 --> 1:30:01.000]  Here on the March, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hello
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:04.880]  friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self
[1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:08.880]  sufficient. And today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food
[1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:12.840]  and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your own
[1:30:12.840 --> 1:30:17.000]  bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:21.040]  in any emergency. If you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:25.680]  the final equation with you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's
[1:30:25.680 --> 1:30:30.400]  safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports. And they do it at almost

[1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:09.800]  humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating
[1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:15.200]  the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception
[1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:19.400]  completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American
[1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:24.840]  people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since D1 in this election. If you have
[1:31:24.840 --> 1:31:29.800]  a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the
[1:31:29.800 --> 1:31:37.960]  program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not
[1:31:37.960 --> 1:31:43.120]  about left or right. It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama
[1:31:43.120 --> 1:31:49.960]  works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception

[1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:23.520]  up on air and I say that what you're seeing in Europe, England, the United States, Canada
[1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:29.560]  is tyranny. We're one step away from him just disappearing. When I was in Canada, they said
[1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:33.240]  that you're here to ship drugs in, aren't you? And I was like, no. And they said, listen,
[1:33:33.240 --> 1:33:38.720]  we find one porno pitcher on those computers, you're going to get years and years in prison.
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:41.960]  And I said, these are our office computers. And I said, what, like illegal porn? He goes,
[1:33:41.960 --> 1:33:47.360]  no, anything. Topless girl, you're going to prison. So they spent hours and hours searching
[1:33:47.360 --> 1:33:50.760]  them, thank God, none of the office computers because who hadn't clicked on something by
[1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:54.520]  accident or on purpose or whatever, you know, the porn's everywhere on the web. None of
[1:33:54.520 --> 1:34:00.200]  it on our computers. And, and then they were cussing at me, screaming at me. It sounds
[1:34:00.200 --> 1:34:06.320]  like the Greeks aren't that mean that they did shove on him and grab him, he said. But
[1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:10.800]  that's where this is going. I mean, I was there being told how I was going to be going
[1:34:10.800 --> 1:34:18.200]  to a Toronto prison, going back to back to our guest, London Guardian reporter. He's
[1:34:18.200 --> 1:34:23.280]  filed two stories now, one about his arrest yesterday and one about how he was going
[1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:30.040]  and you know, breaking it down. And we go back now to Charlie Skelton. Charlie, you're,
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:34.720]  you're, you're in the police department right now. Are you miles away from the meeting spot
[1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:35.720]  of Bilderberg?
[1:34:35.720 --> 1:34:36.720]  Hello?
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:37.720]  Yes, sir.
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:42.720]  Sorry, I, I couldn't hear you. There was no Greek voices. Sorry.
[1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:46.360]  So you're just stuck in the police department and that's the end of it.
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:52.080]  Yeah. Well, I got a feeling I'm about to be, uh, waved off, uh, what with me, A being
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:57.320]  no threat whatsoever. And B, they, no one seems to know what's going on.
[1:34:57.320 --> 1:34:58.320]  What type of questions?
[1:34:58.320 --> 1:34:59.320]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:05.320]  I just, I was going to pass you over to one of the policemen if you'd like.
[1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:07.160]  Oh, I'd like to talk to him. What's his name?
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:12.400]  Yeah. Okay. It's a lady. It's the one I described as, yeah. It's the one I described as the
[1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:17.000]  Christine Aguilera. I'll go put her, I'll put her on. Oh, okay. Lovely Greek lady.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:19.400]  Oh, she's gone away. Oh, how annoying.
[1:35:19.400 --> 1:35:24.240]  Oh, she doesn't, she doesn't want to talk to you. Sir, look, more importantly, can
[1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:29.600]  you tell us about the EU law and being registered to be able to buy seeds? Can you tell me?
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:35.600]  I'll be the least. Here we go. I'm off. Go, my friend, go. Okay. Thank you very much.
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:38.880]  But no, no, no, ask him if you'll be arrested again. If you take photos of Bilderberg, ask
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:39.880]  him.
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:45.880]  Oh, he's gone. Hold on. That's a good question. I will ask that. I'm going back into the
[1:35:45.880 --> 1:35:46.880]  train station.
[1:35:46.880 --> 1:35:50.480]  That's, that's good. You need to have that attitude. They're the ones engaging in crimes.
[1:35:50.480 --> 1:35:59.480]  See, he feels guilty. He's like, go, my friend, with the, with the blunt, excuse me. Listen,
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:04.440]  if you have to hold the phone down by your side and they won't take it as, as is threatening.
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:11.560]  You just hold the phone down by your side. Mr. Skeleton, could I just, I just, I need
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:15.200]  to ask one quick question. I need to ask one quick question. Um, will I, will I be arrested
[1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:22.200]  again if I take photographs of Bilderberg? Can I pass you to Alex Jones? I don't speak.
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:30.200]  No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't speak. No, you speak British English. My friend, my friend
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:37.200]  I don't speak like you. I don't speak to the telephone. Ask her the question again. What
[1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:50.560]  can I clarify? Am I allowed to take photographs of Bilderberg? Am I allowed to take photographs
[1:36:50.560 --> 1:36:58.680]  of Bilderberg? Am I allowed to take photographs of Bilderberg? She doesn't understand. Ask
[1:36:58.680 --> 1:37:09.480]  her if you'll be arrested again if you go to the same place. Hello. Hello. How are you
[1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:21.360]  doing? Is there freedom of the press in Greece? Are you a fascist country? Can he take photos
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:27.760]  of foreign banker rulers who are bankrupting you now and will enslave your family's future
[1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:37.320]  police officers, police officers? Do you serve Hitler? Do you serve Stalin? Thank you. Do
[1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:42.840]  they answer? I'm a free man. Second time freedom. Well, okay, but they will not answer. Well,
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:46.640]  you know what? Maybe you should go back down to Bilderberg right now and see if they put
[1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:54.600]  you back in. It'll kind of become like a marigold round. You know, I think I might not. I think
[1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:57.960]  you know what? I would go down there, I would go down there and I would say, I've been told
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:02.400]  it's okay for me to do this because then releasing you, I would file a formal complaint. This
[1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:06.280]  is what you ought to do. I would go to the British Embassy and I would make an issue
[1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:10.500]  out of this London Guardian. I mean, you're a British citizen, our subject, and you supposedly
[1:38:10.500 --> 1:38:13.920]  have these rights and you're in the European Union. I would complain to the European Union
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:18.040]  Embassy and I would say the freedom of the press is being violated by a bunch of criminal
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:23.520]  bankers meeting. This is a big deal. You've got to file complaints, man. Yeah. For you,
[1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:29.560]  I will file a complaint, okay? Well, for all of us. Yes, it is for me. It is for my future
[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:35.280]  as well. Yeah, no, I mean, I'm interested to see what's going to happen to anyone. I
[1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:39.520]  mean, there's a growing number of people here from the alternative media and I think there's
[1:38:39.520 --> 1:38:43.840]  a few just generally interested parties turning up. But a couple of protesters, I know, again,
[1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:47.040]  I spoke to one guy who's going to be here. I mean, I just interested to see what's going
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:52.600]  to happen and how hard the Greek police are going to be hitting and how, you know, hopefully
[1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:57.720]  not literally hitting, but how serious they're going to take it because if I can tell, they're
[1:38:57.720 --> 1:39:02.560]  taking it pretty seriously. Well, I saw photos of Lenin Guardian. Were those your photos?
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:07.360]  Were they look very agitated and they're surrounding you? Yes, that was that's the one that really
[1:39:07.360 --> 1:39:12.360]  kicked things off that photo. And you say they were grabbing and shouting at you then?
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:17.560]  That one officer looks like he's 12 years old. What happened? He was a nasty little
[1:39:17.560 --> 1:39:22.520]  fellow. I wouldn't mind if he drove his car into the marina. I didn't like him. I like
[1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:25.880]  some of the others. They were fine, but you know, I just, it's very strange. It makes
[1:39:25.880 --> 1:39:29.800]  it, you know, what the situation does is it makes bad people out of good people.
[1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:36.200]  Operative word little fellow. He has a Napoleon complex, probably. Yeah. I didn't like him
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:41.000]  at all. He's a bully. Anyway, so yeah, I'm free.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:47.560]  Oh, that was a thought crime right there. Did you know that your own home secretary, Jackie
[1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:52.560]  Smith is banning people who criticize the government or criticize open borders from
[1:39:52.560 --> 1:39:56.800]  coming to England. See in the future, and they do this in Canada, when you show up, they
[1:39:56.800 --> 1:40:01.080]  say you're a thought criminal. So that's why you get arrested. I mean, is that good?
[1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:08.720]  I thought England had the Magna Carta 1215 1215. It was lunch. Um, I, do you know what
[1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:15.360]  I, I, I'm only, I have to say to you, Alex, I'm only just waking up to, uh, to what's
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:19.920]  going on. I really, I'm one of those people who, who's taking their first tentative footsteps
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:25.880]  into awareness of, uh, a world which isn't pretty and it isn't, it isn't necessarily
[1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:29.400]  being wrong for the right reasons by the right people. And you know, I'm just learning and
[1:40:29.400 --> 1:40:33.840]  I've spent, I've just, I've been in twice into a, in a police station for doing absolutely
[1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:38.160]  nothing. I mean, really nothing. And you know, it's, it's a wake up call for me and
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:42.280]  I hope it's a wake up call for some other people. And, uh, and I just, I want a personal
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:45.840]  note. I'd like to thank you for the work you're doing, uh, in, you know, I mean, literally
[1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:49.240]  waking people up out of the flumber that they are in.
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:53.200]  Well I appreciate you. And, uh, I was talking to Paul Watson who you email. We've got your
[1:40:53.200 --> 1:40:57.080]  email saying that you are aware of the radio show and have listened to it. How long have
[1:40:57.080 --> 1:41:01.120]  you tuned into the radio show or seen the videos?
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:06.160]  Start watching. I mean, my wife, uh, Hannah, uh, even bigger fan of you than I am.
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:07.160]  Oh, thought criminal.
[1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:12.000]  She, uh, started getting me into this. We started looking at some, uh, uh, you know,
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:16.360]  we watched loose change, you know, that's another key. You know, we watched your, uh,
[1:41:16.360 --> 1:41:21.400]  you know, the, uh, uh, I forgot my name, the global conspiracy countdown, whether it's
[1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:26.680]  cause it's not terrible. I forgot the name of your movie. Um, uh, and, you know, a couple
[1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:31.160]  of those, uh, those videos started looking at that. So I was reading, started listening
[1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:35.720]  to the radio show, you know, and you've got somebody interesting guests on and, you know,
[1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:42.240]  you hear some new ideas and different perspectives and, you know, it's, I mean, thank God we've
[1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:45.000]  got the internet now. I don't know how long we're going to have it for in the way that
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:50.160]  it, you know, the level of freedom of communication we have at this second. I don't know. That's,
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:54.520]  that scares me. But, um, you know, at the moment, this is a, this is a, this is a time
[1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:59.240]  of awakening, I think for the, for the, for everyone. I genuinely believe that. And I
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:04.280]  don't know how many people are going to, you know, wake up. I saw, I keep saying that,
[1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:08.560]  but it is the appropriate metaphor. I think, uh, I don't know how many are going to, and
[1:42:08.560 --> 1:42:09.560]  let's just hope it's enough.
[1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:15.120]  Well, the London Guardian needs to make a big deal out of this because, you know, we
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:18.800]  have the times of London, we have herettes, we have all these big papers. In fact, I'm
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:23.880]  going to read those later on air. I thought I'd printed the herettes story. Just Google
[1:42:23.880 --> 1:42:29.720]  Bilderberg and herettes or herots. Uh, and it's one of the stories down. Uh, and it says
[1:42:29.720 --> 1:42:34.040]  global elite meeting to chart future of world government. All these news articles, I'm reading
[1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:38.960]  this morning in the day. They're now admitting it. This is a big deal because in the past,
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:43.640]  I have the New York times just eight years ago, say, I was insane. It didn't exist. Bohemian
[1:42:43.640 --> 1:42:48.560]  Grove didn't exist. Bilderberg group didn't exist. When the groups had already written
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:52.040]  books and bragged about how they existed and German presidents had written about it and
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:57.400]  prime ministers had written about it to, to, to, to now have it be all over the European
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:02.760]  press, all over the British press, but not in the US press. Last year was the biggest
[1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:07.540]  blackout we'd seen in a decade. Uh, newspaper showed up but said they weren't allowed to
[1:43:07.540 --> 1:43:13.360]  really write about it. So there was no US press. Finally, Politico this year, uh, did
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:20.640]  a Bilderberg report dealing with my film, the Obama deception and how Barack Obama, uh,
[1:43:20.640 --> 1:43:25.560]  how Barack Obama was clearly there and how they, uh, helped kidnap the airplane full
[1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:29.080]  of media telling him he was going to Chicago on his plane, but he didn't. And he went to
[1:43:29.080 --> 1:43:33.320]  Brookstreet. I mean, not Brookstreet. He went to the Chantilly, Virginia, Marriott and
[1:43:33.320 --> 1:43:37.720]  Brookstreet was 2006. So I, I would hope you'd get some of that in your article. There's
[1:43:37.720 --> 1:43:42.960]  a history of intimidation, shooting at Jim Tucker, that there's a history of threats,
[1:43:42.960 --> 1:43:48.320]  uh, and that, and that, and that what does this say about the global elite, that they're
[1:43:48.320 --> 1:43:53.560]  meeting in secret, setting the financial future, you know, uh, the Bilderberg group has leaked
[1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:58.800]  and the BBC has even reported that they set up the European Union covertly, that they're
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:03.140]  setting up. I mean, this is a fact, sir. This is the group. If we arrested these people
[1:44:03.140 --> 1:44:08.160]  right now and they've committed public crimes, uh, most of them have, or at least started
[1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:11.320]  an investigation, the whole new world order could end.
[1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:15.520]  Yeah. I mean, what's, what's fascinating and it's such an obvious point that it's been
[1:44:15.520 --> 1:44:20.320]  made many times, uh, but it's worth making again is if these guys were doing something
[1:44:20.320 --> 1:44:24.200]  benign, if they were trying to organize a softball game or how to cure cancer, they'd
[1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:29.480]  do it in an upstairs room for Starbucks. You know, there's no need to hide good acts away
[1:44:29.480 --> 1:44:34.360]  from the public. There's no need to hide good intentions. You know, it's, it's, it's such
[1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:38.520]  an obvious point, but it, I don't, you know, they've got a police helicopter flying around
[1:44:38.520 --> 1:44:44.800]  and there's tinted windows and, and you know, uh, why? It's, it's, well, we all know why,
[1:44:44.800 --> 1:44:50.280]  but if, if it was all so benign, I get the feeling it would be, you know, just a little
[1:44:50.280 --> 1:44:57.440]  bit softer around the edges. How would you like being shot at? Well, you know, I don't
[1:44:57.440 --> 1:45:02.680]  pretty much got my fingers crossed that doesn't happen. Well, they do that. They also call
[1:45:02.680 --> 1:45:07.960]  your wife just in case they do it. This happens to everybody's wives. They'll call up and
[1:45:07.960 --> 1:45:16.600]  go, hi is, uh, hi is, uh, Charlie there. And no, no, no, I'm serious. I'd call her before
[1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:21.320]  they do it. I mean, they do this to most reporters. No, it's serious. They'll go, but I understand,
[1:45:21.320 --> 1:45:25.040]  but it sounds like a joke when I do it. The point is, hi is Charlie there. No, he's not
[1:45:25.040 --> 1:45:29.720]  going to leave a message. Well, yeah, who's this? Well, this is his wife, Mrs. Skelton.
[1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:34.120]  That's impossible. I'm pregnant with his baby and, and, and, and, and we, and we, you know,
[1:45:34.120 --> 1:45:38.120]  we're engaged and then, and then the woman will start crying and saying, well, I'll give
[1:45:38.120 --> 1:45:41.720]  you mine now, you know, and then, and then they'll call up and if you have a little dog
[1:45:41.720 --> 1:45:45.640]  in the backyard, they'll say, I'm watching her little white dog right now. You're like,
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:49.280]  excuse me. And then your wife looks out the window and the dogs then goes, yeah, and that's
[1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:54.440]  when I'm going to stab you and rape you. So, I mean, it's the government. They're watching
[1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:58.640]  the dog while they do it. I mean, it's real, bud. These people call your, call your women
[1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:04.360]  up. So I just want you to know these are hardcore criminals you're dealing with. I mean, take
[1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:08.400]  as a big, new presence. He wrote a book two years ago bragging that what we already knew,
[1:46:08.400 --> 1:46:15.280]  he funded pole pot to kill 35% of the Cambodian population. These guys, these guys, Mr. Skelton
[1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:21.600]  write books bragging about who they've murdered. You understand? So it's a very interesting
[1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:25.680]  point where you're making those, but a lot of, a lot of the documentation, a lot of the
[1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:32.680]  ideology, uh, behind, uh, you know, uh, the shift towards globalization. It's, it's been
[1:46:32.680 --> 1:46:35.840]  printed. It's open. It's out in the open. It's kind of just so big. The point I was
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:39.600]  making, I think the one of my pieces is so big and so much out in the open. People don't
[1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:43.760]  see it. They're not reading the right books. They're not seeing the thinking that's behind
[1:46:43.760 --> 1:46:48.280]  it, which is, you know, it's been published. It's, you know, there are papers, there are
[1:46:48.280 --> 1:46:53.040]  books, you know, uh, the, the ideology is out there for everyone to see. And also, you
[1:46:53.040 --> 1:46:58.120]  know, if you can, for one moment, take your eyes off, uh, you know, American Idol and
[1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:03.640]  the X Factor, uh, you can, you can see changes happening ever so slightly incrementally all
[1:47:03.640 --> 1:47:09.520]  the time around you. But the problem is you, people just don't have to, it's becoming,
[1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:14.600]  I genuinely think it's psychologically impossible for a lot of people to notice and to think
[1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:20.640]  and to, and to see. I, I, I do. And if that's one of the great horrors that they've made,
[1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:22.840]  they've rendered us stupid.
[1:47:22.840 --> 1:47:27.400]  Well, most reporters get those calls that go, actually go to Bilderberg. So I'm just giving
[1:47:27.400 --> 1:47:31.880]  you a warning to let her know since you're online to just, well, just laugh it off when
[1:47:31.880 --> 1:47:32.880]  they call.
[1:47:32.880 --> 1:47:33.880]  You're warning Hannah.
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:38.880]  Okay. Okay. So she's listening. Now, now, uh, we appreciate your time. If you have a website,
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:42.600]  books, writings, stuff that you want to point people at.
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:51.760]  Um, uh, uh, apart from yours, um, no, do you know what, um, uh, you know, I might start
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:55.520]  writing some more things on this subject. The first time I've, this is the first time
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:48:00.720]  I've tackled this subject in any way. And you know, it's certainly, I didn't set out
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:05.680]  to happen thinking of the detain twice by the police. So, you know, I might write some
[1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:09.520]  more than again, I don't want my dog threatened. So, you know, I might just go back to writing
[1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:10.520]  jokes about it.
[1:48:10.520 --> 1:48:14.880]  Well, no, they're not threatening the dog. They, they will tell you, oh, you're, you're
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:18.360]  there just made yourself. It looks like, is that coffee or tea you're making there?
[1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:22.120]  Hello? Excuse me. You've got the, and you're like wondering how they're looking at you.
[1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:26.640]  And it's like, that's right, bitch. I'm going to stab you and rape you to death. How's that
[1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:30.760]  sound? So I'm saying, and they'll say it just like that. So I'm just trying to give you
[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:35.000]  an idea who these people are. This, I'm telling you, Mr. Skelton, I've been down the rabbit
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  hole. You're starting to go down it. And, and, and, and you've, you've opened up your
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.200]  first step into a wider world and there's good things and there's bad things about it.
[1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:46.880]  But I, I'm just letting the listeners know too, for folks, you know, you ever wonder
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:51.160]  about the new world order and who they are? These are murdering criminals. And these are
[1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:55.640]  the bankers. We have this from inside Bilderberg that are engineering the financial collapse.
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:49:00.360]  We said that three years ago today, we said they were going to engineer it, how they would
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:05.760]  do it, what they do with the stock market. We broke it all down. They rule the planet.
[1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:15.200]  And so we are here. This is happening. This is going on right now. And so I just, just
[1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:19.440]  want you to know that this is very, very serious. And the cop on the beat, he's just taking
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:24.280]  you to jail. He's probably not a bad guy. He's on a power trip. That cop is compartmentalized
[1:49:24.280 --> 1:49:28.720]  too. His family is being destroyed. His future is being destroyed. His world is being destroyed
[1:49:28.720 --> 1:49:34.240]  by the very bankers. He's criminally protecting. You know, he has to break a law and violate
[1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:39.440]  your free speech under the EU charter, under the laws of Greece. They break the law and
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:44.280]  keep taking you to jail, beat the rap, can't beat the ride. So they're committing crimes
[1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:46.200]  to destroy their own futures.
[1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:50.800]  I just thought of a book I'd like to recommend.
[1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:51.800]  What book is that?
[1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:55.760]  Well, it's a little bit odd. You might think you're recommending it, but I picked up a
[1:49:55.760 --> 1:50:02.440]  copy of the Diaries of Goebbels, the German propagandist from World War II, one of the
[1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:08.680]  most evil men of all time, but also one of those brilliant psychologists. And these papers
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:15.840]  were rescued after the war and almost by chance. And what's revealed in his Diaries is just
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:22.200]  one of the early exponents of propaganda, of mind manipulation, of the population control,
[1:50:22.200 --> 1:50:27.040]  of living and taking, guiding the public mind. And it's an extraordinary read. And I recommend
[1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:30.400]  everyone to just have a look at it because you read it and you go, oh my God, this guy
[1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:34.000]  is, you know, he's one of the ground breakers there. He's one of the ground breakers.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:39.400]  Well, you know, you know, you know, you know, he cited, he cited Edward Bernays.
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:42.480]  So I heard that today, actually, some later.
[1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:43.480]  Yeah.
[1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:47.000]  So you were reading, I mean, I've actually read part of those. I didn't have time to
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:51.040]  read the whole book. Which book do you have? There's two books that I know of that have
[1:50:51.040 --> 1:50:52.040]  the writings of.
[1:50:52.040 --> 1:50:55.000]  Oh, do you know what I do know? It's an old, it's an old tactic.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  Joseph Gweimel is the Nazi propaganda galida. Stay there. Let's do one more segment if
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  you can do it.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:05.040]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins
[1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:09.560]  or herbal supplements? Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos and toothpaste
[1:51:09.560 --> 1:51:13.680]  contain chemical additives such as sodium, laurel, sulfate, the same type of detergent
[1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:17.680]  used in dish soap? Did you know that many moldy vitamin supplements are made from synthetic
[1:51:17.680 --> 1:51:22.560]  vitamins? Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers? Have you ever tested

[1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:09.840]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force
[1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:16.760]  that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely
[1:52:16.760 --> 1:52:21.480]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[1:52:21.480 --> 1:52:26.160]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election. If you have
[1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:31.120]  a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the
[1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:37.680]  program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not
[1:52:37.680 --> 1:52:42.840]  about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama
[1:52:42.840 --> 1:52:49.640]  works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception
[1:52:49.640 --> 1:52:56.600]  today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama
[1:52:56.600 --> 1:53:01.120]  deception. The people strike back.
[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:05.640]  Less than a century ago, half of the American public grew much of their own food. Today,
[1:53:05.640 --> 1:53:10.080]  it's been estimated that only 1% of Americans still grow their own food. During the Great
[1:53:10.080 --> 1:53:15.400]  Depression, over 18 million people suffered from starvation. And as America continues
[1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:20.960]  down its current path, for many, the reality of another depression is a very serious concern.
[1:53:20.960 --> 1:53:25.760]  With massive layoffs and unemployment at record levels, growing your own food will help you
[1:53:25.760 --> 1:53:30.080]  save money that you'd normally spend at the grocery store. Invest in your family's future

[1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:21.840]  Look, Charlie Skelton, you're a smart guy, right up on the Guardian. I write for a lot
[1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:25.320]  of big publications. I'm not here preaching it. I was telling you, I've been there. I've
[1:54:25.320 --> 1:54:30.200]  seen it. I can't believe how evil the globe will start, but they reveled. They won up
[1:54:30.200 --> 1:54:35.240]  each other on who is the most ruthless, who is the most corrupt. And Edward Bernays and
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:42.160]  Joseph Goebbels, that's 80-year-old stuff when they were really in their heydays. And
[1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:47.560]  it's all being used today, but even more sophisticated. They fuse more than 100 different types of
[1:54:47.560 --> 1:54:52.800]  propaganda together where I can't even articulate it. I can just behold it and go, when I'm
[1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:58.320]  watching television, I mean, that's how scientific it is. And the wordsmithing and the twisting
[1:54:58.320 --> 1:55:03.840]  and the tactics. But you're talking about Goebbels. That is good to read. I definitely
[1:55:03.840 --> 1:55:06.560]  want to have you back up in the near future. I want to get you up for 15, 20 minutes tomorrow.
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:11.040]  I won't keep you for 10 hours. If your cell bill is huge, 50 bucks or something, send
[1:55:11.040 --> 1:55:14.720]  me a bill. I'll pay for it. So I appreciate you. We were going to try to call your hotel,
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:19.200]  but you got detained and luckily we thought to get your cell phone earlier. And I know
[1:55:19.200 --> 1:55:24.120]  I've been preaching at you, but you're there, arrested twice, released again. Have they
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:31.360]  won? I mean, are you not going back now to the Bilderberg group meeting? I mean, I guess
[1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:37.040]  you could go buy a 100 pound, 200 pound digital zoom, a little bit better Sony, one that has
[1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:43.520]  like a 50 zoom or something and maybe have taxis drive by and take photos. Digitals are
[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:47.800]  good at that. Don't let them stop you just because they've arrested you twice. Now that's
[1:55:47.800 --> 1:55:53.520]  easy to say. I was only arrested once for 16 hours and didn't like it or 15, 16, whatever.
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:57.440]  But I mean, where are you going from here? It's a good question. Have they won? And
[1:55:57.440 --> 1:56:02.640]  I, you know, partially they had today. I didn't, I was, I was intimidated enough not to go
[1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:07.520]  up to the gates of the hotel today. I was, I was well away from it when I was detained
[1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:11.880]  for the second time. Uh, because, and I was saying, I wasn't, you know, I was laughing
[1:56:11.880 --> 1:56:15.080]  through gritted teeth with the police woman who was going, I can't believe you're back
[1:56:15.080 --> 1:56:20.440]  again. And I was saying, look, I was trying not to be, I was trying not to be detained.
[1:56:20.440 --> 1:56:26.320]  But see, I would have told her it's your problem. What is this? Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia?
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:31.320]  I mean, my, my folks, folks, they're already censoring the internet. They're setting that
[1:56:31.320 --> 1:56:36.000]  up same. The same way China phased it in the, the, the, the free speech zones that started
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:40.920]  in Russia, then China. Listen, if you study this, Mr. Skelton, you're there reading propaganda
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:45.440]  documents right now that they phase this stuff in. If you're reading Goebbels diaries, you
[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:53.280]  see, he talks about that. Yeah. I mean, uh, information is the, is it's, it's the, it's
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:57.680]  the key thing that they're holding back and or sharing of information. And, you know,
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:02.200]  what, uh, in so far as the internet allows a sharing of viewpoints of the differing viewpoints
[1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:05.680]  and of information, different information, you know, the key word being difference, you
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:09.880]  know, uh, that's great. I don't know how long that, that, that difference is going to last.
[1:57:09.880 --> 1:57:14.760]  And I'd like to make a serious point here, which is that, um, you know, it's very difficult
[1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:19.600]  to, to categorize the alternative media and people with alternative viewpoints as one
[1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:23.960]  thing. Whereas Bilderberg, they're sitting there and they are strategizing and they,
[1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:28.000]  you know, there is, there is whatever you might think is happening, whatever you, whatever
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:32.680]  you characterize the Bilderberg meeting as, you have to agree that some strategizing some
[1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:36.640]  ideas, some, some forward thinking is being done. I mean, what, where do you think it's
[1:57:36.640 --> 1:57:41.600]  benign, malign, whatever. So this kind of strategy, power, you know, I know, I know,
[1:57:41.600 --> 1:57:44.880]  but these broad, they don't get together and talk about power.
[1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:50.440]  Sure. I know. So what, but, you know, on the point, you know, you turn it around and you
[1:57:50.440 --> 1:57:56.640]  see what, what people like you and other alternative voices are saying, it's very difficult to,
[1:57:56.640 --> 1:58:04.600]  to, to strategize against that kind of serious, uh, big, big money, you know, uh, strategizing
[1:58:04.600 --> 1:58:08.600]  that's going on, on their side. And, you know, one of the, one of the difficult things is
[1:58:08.600 --> 1:58:12.680]  that people have differences of opinion and people disagree. I disagree with my wife about
[1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:18.440]  aspects of September 11th, for example, we have different, I disagree about certain things
[1:58:18.440 --> 1:58:21.440]  about, you know, the importance of gun control and my mind is slightly changing about, I
[1:58:21.440 --> 1:58:26.040]  have to admit, but you know, we, while we have differences of, differences of opinion,
[1:58:26.040 --> 1:58:32.680]  I think it's very important that, that at some point there is a coherent strategy against
[1:58:32.680 --> 1:58:33.680]  global.
[1:58:33.680 --> 1:58:37.240]  Okay. Listen, listen to five more minutes and I'm going to let you go and take calls.
[1:58:37.240 --> 1:58:44.240]  One minute break, sir. We're going to start the third hour. Thank you for listening to

[1:58:52.840 --> 1:58:57.720]  the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides plants with the mineral elements,
[1:58:57.720 --> 1:59:02.040]  which are essential to human nourishment. Studies have shown that a majority of Americans
[1:59:02.040 --> 1:59:08.680]  are seriously deficient in basic minerals. Deficiency in any one of the more important
[1:59:08.680 --> 1:59:15.080]  minerals actually results in disease. Go to raworganicvegansuperfoods.com today and see

[2:00:00.480 --> 2:00:19.840]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[2:00:19.840 --> 2:00:26.840]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:26.840 --> 2:00:30.500]  He's Keltan, who writes one of the biggest newspapers in the world, discovering Bilderberg,
[2:00:30.500 --> 2:00:35.520]  the London Guardian, five more minutes with him, the total phone blitz and news blitz coming
[2:00:35.520 --> 2:00:43.780]  up. And a guest by the government kidnapping children in mass, a state representative,
[2:00:43.780 --> 2:00:49.160]  will be joining us. But I want to be clear and also let you know now what you've stepped
[2:00:49.160 --> 2:00:55.160]  into, Mr. Keltan, because we're not making this up. You'll probably be stuck on a no-fly
[2:00:55.160 --> 2:00:57.480]  list now.
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:00:59.680]  And this is how the globalists operate.
[2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:00.680]  It's unnamed.
[2:01:00.680 --> 2:01:07.480]  They won't tell you why you're on it for the rest of your life with Interpol, UK, US.
[2:01:07.480 --> 2:01:12.000]  You're on file for daring to work for a big newspaper and go cover world leaders meeting
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:16.560]  to set the future of the world with all the big bank ministers in secret with helicopters
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:18.040]  and guys with machine guns.
[2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:21.000]  Now think about how butt backwards that is.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  You know, here we are trying to cover this.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  They make it like we're the bad guys.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:30.880]  You know, they make us go to the airports and thumb scan and face scan and take our
[2:01:30.880 --> 2:01:34.200]  shoes off and be body scanned and be searched and ask questions.
[2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:38.640]  But then they just fly in private jet, helicoptered in, the police and military we pay for, then
[2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:41.680]  protect them to carry out their crimes against our nation.
[2:01:41.680 --> 2:01:42.680]  And there's no doubt.
[2:01:42.680 --> 2:01:45.400]  I mean, one Bilderberg group, remember, I know it was under indictment and he's involved
[2:01:45.400 --> 2:01:49.360]  grabbing the Texas power plants and he's Pakistani.
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:51.920]  He's involved grabbing the roads and the NAFTA highways.
[2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:56.720]  I mean, these guys come in, buy off governments and have the governments hand them everything.
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:59.000]  Same thing the Nazis did that you were mentioning.
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:04.320]  So that's how they operate and now they have these new hate list and now they want to put
[2:02:04.320 --> 2:02:08.560]  American gun owners on list without ever saying why you can't own a gun.
[2:02:08.560 --> 2:02:12.480]  I mean, this is tyranny and we have to go ahead and just recognize it and deal with
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:13.480]  it.
[2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:17.760]  Any final comments on that and any other observations about where they're meeting the security they've
[2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:21.440]  got at Bilderberg 2009 in Athens, Greece?
[2:02:21.440 --> 2:02:27.840]  Well, after that, I might keep my distance a little bit more even to tomorrow.
[2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:28.840]  Maybe he's one of it.
[2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:30.280]  So I'll be a little bit clear.
[2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:31.280]  No, no, it's too late.
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:32.280]  Too late.
[2:02:32.280 --> 2:02:34.200]  They've already arrested you twice.
[2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:37.520]  That was just to bring you in and identify and get you in the slave grid.
[2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:38.520]  Now you don't have it.
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:40.520]  Now you just got to fight them.
[2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:41.520]  Go ahead.
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:47.320]  Well, you remind me one, a last thing I would say is that when you're talking, I thought
[2:02:47.320 --> 2:02:53.360]  about the writings, what, when they're written down, the writings of Bill Hicks, the late
[2:02:53.360 --> 2:03:00.760]  great comedian, who in his stand-up routines was making some very, very serious points
[2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:02.640]  about exactly what you're talking about.
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:06.200]  And one of the things, you know, one of the things he said, for example, about the assassination
[2:03:06.200 --> 2:03:10.560]  of Kennedy, whatever you think about it, is he said, you know, people, he wants to talk
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:12.600]  about the assassination Kennedy.
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:14.640]  Other people are saying, now come on, that's past history.
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:15.640]  He's going, come on, man.
[2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:17.800]  This was the president who was killed.
[2:03:17.800 --> 2:03:19.280]  Can we not talk about it?
[2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:20.280]  Same thing with 9-11.
[2:03:20.280 --> 2:03:21.760]  I talked to my brother about it.
[2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:23.400]  And he goes, my brother goes, bless him.
[2:03:23.400 --> 2:03:25.280]  He goes, you know, that's eight years ago.
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:29.280]  You know, come on, we've moved on and I'm going, no, hang on, there are questions to
[2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:30.280]  be asked.
[2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:31.280]  This is a big thing.
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:35.840]  So, you know, asking questions, I think that's the, it's such an important thing to ask
[2:03:35.840 --> 2:03:40.240]  questions, even if, you know, even if you find out it is X and X, Y and Z, as you've
[2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:41.240]  been told.
[2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:42.240]  Good.
[2:03:42.240 --> 2:03:44.720]  You know, I'd love to find out that things happened, as I'm told.
[2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:46.840]  It would make, it would mean that people weren't lying.
[2:03:46.840 --> 2:03:49.600]  Well, they also told us 9-11.
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:52.960]  They also told us 9-11 was the foundation of the police state and giving up our rights
[2:03:52.960 --> 2:03:58.040]  and the world was different and we had to invade all these countries, so they're always
[2:03:58.040 --> 2:03:59.040]  invoking 9-11.
[2:03:59.040 --> 2:04:03.000]  And then when we try to go, well, wait, governments have staged terror and this looks like it's
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  staged.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  That's old news.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  Don't discuss it.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  It's, it's a dead issue.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:12.120]  Again, they're trying to set the agenda, set the parameters of the debate, get outside
[2:04:12.120 --> 2:04:13.120]  the box.
[2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:19.640]  So, Tucker on at eight o'clock your time tomorrow, it's 9-04, Greece time, where you're at, Mr.
[2:04:19.640 --> 2:04:20.640]  Skelton.
[2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:23.040]  What time can you come on the show for?
[2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:26.320]  What time can you come on tomorrow for 10, 15 minutes for an update?
[2:04:26.320 --> 2:04:28.440]  Any time at all.
[2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:29.440]  I'm free and easy.
[2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:30.440]  Well, I say free.
[2:04:30.440 --> 2:04:32.840]  As long as I'm not under arrest any time at all.
[2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:37.800]  Let's have you on at, let's have you on at 8.30 tomorrow.
[2:04:37.800 --> 2:04:38.800]  Okay.

[2:04:42.880 --> 2:04:48.360]  Uh, I, I, do you know, I don't know, probably the cell phone's safe, sir.

[2:05:04.680 --> 2:05:06.360]  bacteria and viruses?

[2:05:19.360 --> 2:05:21.880]  germs, bacteria and yeast safely.
[2:05:21.880 --> 2:05:28.820]  This new silver solution liquid form was shown to be a powerful preventative for H5N1 influenza.
[2:05:28.820 --> 2:05:33.160]  This new technology has proven itself to be a formidable weapon against bio threats of
[2:05:33.160 --> 2:05:34.320]  today and tomorrow.
[2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:39.160]  The new silver solution gel has been shown to disinfect domically and keep the area sanitized

[2:06:01.720 --> 2:06:07.200]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:06:07.200 --> 2:06:13.800]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:06:13.800 --> 2:06:15.120]  just as well funded.
[2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:20.240]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:06:20.240 --> 2:06:21.720]  of the American people.
[2:06:21.720 --> 2:06:23.600]  Well Obama's already fudging.
[2:06:23.600 --> 2:06:24.600]  Yeah.
[2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:26.160]  Fudged since day one in this election.
[2:06:26.160 --> 2:06:31.240]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:06:31.240 --> 2:06:37.760]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:06:37.760 --> 2:06:39.440]  It's not about left or right.
[2:06:39.440 --> 2:06:41.320]  It's about a one world government.
[2:06:41.320 --> 2:06:48.240]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:53.840]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high
[2:06:53.840 --> 2:06:56.440]  quality at presentplanet.tv.
[2:06:56.440 --> 2:07:01.520]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[2:07:01.520 --> 2:07:05.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:08.880]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[2:07:08.880 --> 2:07:10.480]  than when drinking the water?
[2:07:10.480 --> 2:07:14.320]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed
[2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:15.320]  into the skin.
[2:07:15.320 --> 2:07:19.960]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to
[2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:22.800]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[2:07:22.800 --> 2:07:26.520]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[2:07:26.520 --> 2:07:31.360]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever
[2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:32.360]  comes first.
[2:07:32.360 --> 2:07:36.480]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[2:07:36.480 --> 2:07:38.560]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[2:07:38.560 --> 2:07:39.560]  What about you?
[2:07:39.560 --> 2:07:44.920]  Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free
[2:07:44.920 --> 2:07:45.920]  shipping.
[2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:54.400]  I'm a turkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653, that's 1-877-886-3653, or
[2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:58.080]  order online by visiting us at Directive21.com.
[2:07:58.080 --> 2:08:02.080]  That's Directive, the number 21.com now.
[2:08:02.080 --> 2:08:04.760]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[2:08:04.760 --> 2:08:16.800]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:16.800 --> 2:08:23.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, and I'm going to go to your calls right
[2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:24.440]  now.
[2:08:24.440 --> 2:08:25.440]  They're coming up.
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:32.920]  Scientists arrested for smuggling vials, used in Ebola, research into the United States.
[2:08:32.920 --> 2:08:39.360]  I mean, I see these stories every two or three days, the army caught sneaking around anthrax,
[2:08:39.360 --> 2:08:42.680]  some other government group caught with foot and mouth weaponized, some other government
[2:08:42.680 --> 2:08:48.000]  group or private company trying to mix bird flu with vaccines, top scientists saying the
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:52.080]  virus is engineered that popped up three weeks ago.
[2:08:52.080 --> 2:08:56.240]  And they're building more of these labs everywhere, more plausible deniability as they release
[2:08:56.240 --> 2:09:00.840]  things to have scares, to push vaccines on us, and to get more control and federalization,
[2:09:00.840 --> 2:09:04.360]  but also to then release real attacks in the future.
[2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:07.800]  We'll continue to cover Bilderberg later in the next hour.
[2:09:07.800 --> 2:09:09.960]  I've got a huge stack of mainstream news.
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:10.960]  This is unprecedented.
[2:09:10.960 --> 2:09:12.480]  We're winning.
[2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:14.680]  The mainstream media has gone from saying none of this existed.
[2:09:14.680 --> 2:09:17.000]  There's no global government to having to admit it all.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:19.640]  And then now they still criticize us when we talk about it.
[2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:20.760]  They have no credibility.
[2:09:20.760 --> 2:09:23.120]  They're losing credibility.
[2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:25.800]  And so many people are compartmentalized inside mainstream media.
[2:09:25.800 --> 2:09:27.040]  They're not even really bad.
[2:09:27.040 --> 2:09:29.600]  They were ignorant believing the official line.
[2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:32.320]  They're waking up.
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:33.320]  Very, very exciting.
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:35.320]  Okay, let's go to Jared in Texas.
[2:09:35.320 --> 2:09:36.920]  Jared, thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:09:36.920 --> 2:09:37.920]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:40.640]  It's often to be here in my first-time callers.
[2:09:40.640 --> 2:09:45.200]  So anyway, I wanted to talk about something that is a little bit exciting to me.
[2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:50.120]  I hadn't know if you'd heard it, but do you know the history of Abraham the Pruder at
[2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:51.120]  all?
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:54.480]  He's got some spook background, right?
[2:09:54.480 --> 2:09:59.080]  I actually, I'm not that sure, but what I did want to point out, and I thought this
[2:09:59.080 --> 2:10:04.720]  was interesting, it was relevant in the sense that, you know, it's kind of a pattern.
[2:10:04.720 --> 2:10:06.840]  The financiers going and they like to control both sides.
[2:10:06.840 --> 2:10:10.640]  You like to be able to show the horror that they do, you know?
[2:10:10.640 --> 2:10:11.640]  And I was lucky.
[2:10:11.640 --> 2:10:14.840]  Oh, I have no doubt that the establishment was filming it.
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:18.680]  I don't know if they've released those photos, but some have speculated that the Pruder,
[2:10:18.680 --> 2:10:22.280]  you know, shot it and then Timelife had it and then it was allowed to be leaked through
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:26.840]  certain people who didn't even know it was being leaked through them.
[2:10:26.840 --> 2:10:33.360]  But you know, but then people say, I was allowed to sneak into Bohemian Grove and if I was,
[2:10:33.360 --> 2:10:34.360]  I was unknowing.
[2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:40.360]  Hold on just a minute, because I'm trying to explain this thought here, since you bring
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:42.960]  up this, you know, random point here, but it's important.
[2:10:42.960 --> 2:10:49.560]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove because I'd read how others have been caught and others, reporters
[2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:51.800]  always try to go in.
[2:10:51.800 --> 2:10:55.240]  Most of them get caught trying to get through the three guard fences.
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:11:00.560]  I went around them and got on a trolley from the parking lot with something past one checkpoint.
[2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:05.440]  I went around one checkpoint, acted like I was normal, got on one of the flatback trucks.
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:06.440]  We videotaped it.
[2:11:06.440 --> 2:11:09.600]  It's in the film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[2:11:09.600 --> 2:11:13.960]  It's comboed with the Order of Death, two films on one DVD, but side issue.
[2:11:13.960 --> 2:11:18.160]  I got in, drove through the other checkpoints, they looked at us, I smiled at them, was calm
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:21.000]  with my hands and it was also calm, did a great job.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:27.120]  We got in to the main facility and then I didn't run around trying to be social.
[2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:31.880]  These reporters, the last one for Vanity Fair that got arrested, he got arrested.
[2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:35.560]  His articles out, he admits they were homosexual activity and it was a bunch of, I mean, that's
[2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:36.560]  what goes on there.
[2:11:36.560 --> 2:11:41.440]  He admits that they're doing that, but the point is, he tried to go in and be social
[2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:42.440]  with these people.
[2:11:42.440 --> 2:11:45.040]  They walk up and say, who are you with, what are you doing?
[2:11:45.040 --> 2:11:49.200]  And I had Secret Service, I had Sheriff's County deputies that, by the way, the last
[2:11:49.200 --> 2:11:51.280]  guy that got arrested was Sheriff's County deputies.
[2:11:51.280 --> 2:11:53.920]  People were like, where's your footage of this, Alex, you have footage of everything
[2:11:53.920 --> 2:11:54.920]  with that.
[2:11:54.920 --> 2:11:57.400]  No, I've got a camera with a one hour tape.
[2:11:57.400 --> 2:12:02.880]  I start taping, I pull up, I get in, I get in the truck, I go in, I've got a little button
[2:12:02.880 --> 2:12:06.920]  because this is 2000, stuff wasn't hidden, very good hidden camera, I got a little button
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:15.520]  I hit that supposedly starts the hidden camera, but I've got a bag here with the hidden pager
[2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:18.080]  on the front of it and I'm squeezing the button and it didn't tape.
[2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:22.440]  I mean, that's why the rituals often angle like people are like, why isn't it high fidelity
[2:12:22.440 --> 2:12:26.440]  with, you know, first they denied it was even real for years, but then now they admit it's
[2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:28.760]  real and so I go through that as well.
[2:12:28.760 --> 2:12:35.080]  So just to say Abraham's subruder faked it is unfair because I don't believe in charging
[2:12:35.080 --> 2:12:39.520]  people with things with no evidence just because it could be a possibility and then it becomes
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:42.160]  a reality regardless.
[2:12:42.160 --> 2:12:45.440]  Let's just, for the sake of arguments, say I faked the Bohemian Grove, that is, they
[2:12:45.440 --> 2:12:47.400]  let me in, I shot the video.
[2:12:47.400 --> 2:12:51.640]  Now that's not true, but for mental illness sake, let's just say it is.
[2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:59.840]  Now can we address world leaders having homosexual orgies and worshiping owl gods and running
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:02.680]  around the woods naked admitting they do?
[2:13:02.680 --> 2:13:10.880]  I mean, can we address that instead of Alex Jones, you know, the one guy able to get in
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:15.280]  and get out with the goods and you know, I give all the glory to God on that.
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:19.280]  People just can't believe, you know, that Charlie Sheen calls me up and comes on, you
[2:13:19.280 --> 2:13:24.480]  know, Jesse Ventura we run into, Willie Nelson calls up and comes on that I'm in a movie
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:29.760]  with Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder and all these other and Woody Harrelson and all these other
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:35.720]  people and I mean, you know, people can't believe that people couldn't believe when
[2:13:35.720 --> 2:13:41.080]  I shot Marines doing urban warfare takeovers training with a man with roleplayers screaming
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:43.280]  I'm an American, please don't put me in the camp.
[2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:44.280]  It's all real.
[2:13:44.280 --> 2:13:47.160]  I just got on an airplane, flew there and shot it.
[2:13:47.160 --> 2:13:51.000]  You know, people don't believe that's a real police chief I interviewed in San Antonio
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:53.080]  saying they tried to pay him off Delta Force.
[2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:57.680]  You could call that was a real police chief, Ali Philippus, I was in his office, but they
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:14:01.600]  don't make a phone call to find out that's really Ali Philippus, they just say not real.
[2:14:01.600 --> 2:14:05.080]  Now I'm not saying you're doing that, you just got me off on a rant there.
[2:14:05.080 --> 2:14:10.240]  This is mental illness and what it is, is an excuse for the patriot movement to not
[2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:11.640]  become leaders.
[2:14:11.640 --> 2:14:15.200]  Instead of them going out and fighting the Patriot Act and the New World Order and open
[2:14:15.200 --> 2:14:20.120]  borders and the globalists and the bankers are going to Bilderberg or starting a blog
[2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:27.120]  or a radio show, most they sit back and talk crap about everybody else that's been going
[2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:28.960]  on lately.
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:33.240]  They sit back doing that and they sit back nitpicking and critiquing everyone who's
[2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:34.400]  in the arena.
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:36.920]  I need people to get in the arena.
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:37.920]  Okay.
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:42.440]  A lot of people are too far gone ever getting in the arena, they want success so bad, but
[2:14:42.440 --> 2:14:48.920]  they can't get in the arena to get the success and then watch what you asked for, folks.
[2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:56.920]  Now all of this is going on and I've already digressed, what is the point of the phone
[2:14:56.920 --> 2:14:57.920]  call, sir?
[2:14:57.920 --> 2:15:01.000]  Let's just say Abraham is a voodoo, he is absolutely evil.
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:05.200]  Let's just say it, but the point is why did the military industrial complex kill Kennedy
[2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:06.200]  is the question.
[2:15:06.200 --> 2:15:07.200]  Go ahead.
[2:15:07.200 --> 2:15:09.520]  Well, all I wanted to share with you was the detail.
[2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:14.120]  They made us watch a documentary in 12th grade, this was about four years ago and even my
[2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:17.040]  teacher at the time was questioning why they made us watch it because it was graphic, it
[2:15:17.040 --> 2:15:23.320]  was digitally enhanced, it was Kennedy's, it was his assassination and there was a photo
[2:15:23.320 --> 2:15:29.000]  of the pruder in that film and it was interesting because I believe the 9-11, that's glaring,
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:35.680]  it's like how can you not deny that, or I mean how could you deny it when it's so obvious,
[2:15:35.680 --> 2:15:41.120]  but anyway, he was wearing actually in this picture a Masonic lapel, you know, it had
[2:15:41.120 --> 2:15:46.440]  the cheat, had the compass and the 90 degree ruler and I thought that was really interesting.
[2:15:46.440 --> 2:15:50.280]  It actually really made my head pop and the thing is I searched for it on the internet
[2:15:50.280 --> 2:15:55.000]  and I'd only found a couple references to that and I just wanted to know if you'd ever
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  heard about such a thing.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:16:02.280]  No, I can't remember the stuff, I've heard from credible people, but they're not sure,
[2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:07.520]  from Jim Mars and others about questions about the pruder.
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:11.600]  But that's basic, but I mean it's questions, I appreciate your call.
[2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:15.480]  Let's go ahead and talk, I'm sorry I went off on that tirade folks, that's what happens
[2:16:15.480 --> 2:16:20.040]  when I'm at information overload point, Sean in Minnesota, Sean you're on the air.
[2:16:20.040 --> 2:16:23.560]  Hey Alex, thanks for checking my call, first time caller.
[2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:24.560]  Thanks for calling.
[2:16:24.560 --> 2:16:29.640]  Yep, well I'm here in Indianapolis, Indiana, woke up this morning about 8.39 o'clock and
[2:16:29.640 --> 2:16:36.520]  I walked outside and looked to the sky and what do I see, a nice little spider web that
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:37.520]  brightened my day.
[2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:41.920]  And people always denied that there's chemtrail spring starting in the mid 90s, but then now
[2:16:41.920 --> 2:16:42.920]  the government said no.
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:43.920]  Why did they do that?
[2:16:43.920 --> 2:16:48.080]  Now we're, now just like they denied Bilderberg and they denied CFR existed and they denied
[2:16:48.080 --> 2:16:51.800]  New World Order, they denied the European Union even existed for decades before they
[2:16:51.800 --> 2:16:56.880]  openly set it up and announced it because it's a military tactic, instead of ever debating
[2:16:56.880 --> 2:17:00.800]  should they be terraforming and altering the atmosphere, they just say nothing's going
[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:06.400]  on, nothing, and now though they're going, yeah we've been doing tests to spray these
[2:17:06.400 --> 2:17:11.520]  particulates and give you a sunscreen to stop the dangerous sun rays from hurting you and
[2:17:11.520 --> 2:17:12.640]  the earth.
[2:17:12.640 --> 2:17:17.120]  And they give excuses in textbooks of oh we're spraying you to stop, you know the ozone layer
[2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:24.800]  got holes in it and all of this happened and so we've got to do this and oh, we've got
[2:17:24.800 --> 2:17:29.960]  to cool the earth because of greenhouse gases and the White House says we may have to start
[2:17:29.960 --> 2:17:33.480]  doing this and then it's exactly what they announced is exactly what they've already
[2:17:33.480 --> 2:17:34.480]  been doing.
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:37.240]  So, you know, it's a huge subject.
[2:17:37.240 --> 2:17:38.880]  It is a huge subject.
[2:17:38.880 --> 2:17:43.320]  I've been following it now for the last couple of weeks because of you and you know you go
[2:17:43.320 --> 2:17:46.960]  on the web, you go on YouTube and you find video after related video after related video
[2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:51.800]  and I woke up, looked outside because of the awareness now, I'm aware of it and I look
[2:17:51.800 --> 2:17:56.760]  outside, I run right into my house here, grab my little palm quarters, start shooting it
[2:17:56.760 --> 2:18:01.880]  and then about a half hour later the wind had kicked up a little bit and I kid you not,
[2:18:01.880 --> 2:18:06.760]  there was an odor through the air that I have never smelled before in my life and right
[2:18:06.760 --> 2:18:12.360]  now as I talk to you, I'm live on here, I have a headache and it's unbelievable.
[2:18:12.360 --> 2:18:13.360]  I mean what do we do?
[2:18:13.360 --> 2:18:17.560]  I mean how do we get more people aware and why are they really doing this?
[2:18:17.560 --> 2:18:18.560]  I mean, I mean both they need-
[2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:23.080]  Maybe sir, what we know, what we know and I appreciate your call, if you see my film
[2:18:23.080 --> 2:18:25.920]  Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, it basically covers everything.
[2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:30.800]  It's kind of an encyclopedia and in there we show, I think it's 20 different mainstream
[2:18:30.800 --> 2:18:37.120]  news articles, London, Guardian, BBC, Associated Press where they said, yeah, we took 4,300
[2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:42.500]  US foster children and radiated into death and yeah, we took 110,000 Jewish kids and
[2:18:42.500 --> 2:18:47.640]  radiated most of them to death, others we just cooked and yeah, we took US soldiers
[2:18:47.640 --> 2:18:52.080]  and put them in chambers and nerve gas into death and yeah, we sprayed every major US
[2:18:52.080 --> 2:18:56.000]  city with unnamed bacteria and then had doctors in the hospitals to track how they died when
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:19:00.520]  they came in and yeah, we did this and yeah, we did that.
[2:19:00.520 --> 2:19:04.360]  So they've already done it all these thousands of times they admit, I mean I took a small
[2:19:04.360 --> 2:19:10.120]  sampling in that film and we go, okay, they've done all this over and over again, what could
[2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:15.640]  they be doing now and then suddenly they're on Japanese and US news going, maybe we should
[2:19:15.640 --> 2:19:21.360]  spray the people with kind of a Prozac type chemical to make them calm.
[2:19:21.360 --> 2:19:28.000]  Maybe we should put statins so you don't have heart attacks, statin drugs, anti cholesterol
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:30.760]  drugs in the water for children.
[2:19:30.760 --> 2:19:37.200]  Perhaps we should put lithium in all the water supply so that this was in the news last week
[2:19:37.200 --> 2:19:39.520]  so that everybody will be happy.
[2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:43.200]  So we know they're spraying and putting stuff in the water already.
[2:19:43.200 --> 2:19:46.320]  We know there's high altitude atmosphere manipulation going on.
[2:19:46.320 --> 2:19:49.640]  We know there's low level spraying going on.
[2:19:49.640 --> 2:19:59.240]  The real laboratory for this is some of the Pacific islands but look, they're playing
[2:19:59.240 --> 2:20:01.480]  God folks, we'll be right back.
[2:20:01.480 --> 2:20:04.980]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[2:20:04.980 --> 2:20:08.640]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the
[2:20:08.640 --> 2:20:14.480]  world, Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver
[2:20:14.480 --> 2:20:19.080]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein,
[2:20:19.080 --> 2:20:21.080]  nitrates or saline solutions.
[2:20:21.080 --> 2:20:25.640]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano sized particles, it can be better utilized
[2:20:25.640 --> 2:20:30.480]  at the cellular level and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern day
[2:20:30.480 --> 2:20:31.480]  antibiotics.
[2:20:31.480 --> 2:20:35.880]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold
[2:20:35.880 --> 2:20:39.840]  and copper with a money back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[2:20:39.840 --> 2:20:44.120]  For four years Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that
[2:20:44.120 --> 2:20:48.000]  would steal our God given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[2:22:01.720 --> 2:22:07.840]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:22:07.840 --> 2:22:12.320]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[2:22:12.320 --> 2:22:13.640]  us would like to see.
[2:22:13.640 --> 2:22:18.800]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:22:18.800 --> 2:22:20.200]  of the American people.
[2:22:20.200 --> 2:22:24.560]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:29.680]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:22:29.680 --> 2:22:37.760]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:22:37.760 --> 2:22:41.320]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[2:22:41.320 --> 2:22:48.240]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:24:17.080 --> 2:24:42.080]  Thanks Alex, I'm a first-time caller but I have two little things I want to address
[2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:43.080]  to you.
[2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:48.040]  One is about, I think it was three weeks ago you had a minister on who read you Romans
[2:24:48.040 --> 2:24:56.840]  13 about everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities.
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:24:59.360]  You remember that minister?
[2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:05.320]  I think I was, I had a minister, a Baptist preacher, was beat up at an illegal checkpoint.
[2:25:05.320 --> 2:25:09.520]  Well he was saying that he was getting letters sent to him by the government to preach Romans
[2:25:09.520 --> 2:25:10.520]  13.
[2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:18.040]  Well anyways, on that note, if you read that one, that's from the new international version
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:22.680]  of the Bible, but if you read the King James version, it doesn't say anything like that.
[2:25:22.680 --> 2:25:29.040]  So one was put out by the government totally, and then one, and then the other one, the
[2:25:29.040 --> 2:25:32.640]  King James version, but anyways that was my point.
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:33.640]  And then the other question was-
[2:25:33.640 --> 2:25:38.080]  No, let me just back you up, look it's real simple, all of the major prophets were either
[2:25:38.080 --> 2:25:42.200]  killed or the government tried to kill them for not following the government's orders.
[2:25:42.200 --> 2:25:47.480]  Jesus was killed for not following the political and religious leader's orders, Paul was killed,
[2:25:47.480 --> 2:25:49.320]  they were all killed.
[2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:54.120]  And so, and Jesus went in and beat the money changers, and it was all about standing up
[2:25:54.120 --> 2:25:55.560]  against evil.
[2:25:55.560 --> 2:26:01.120]  And Moses said no to Pharaoh, and by the sickening Romans 13 misinterpretation, that was Hitler's
[2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:04.240]  favorite quote, you read Goebbels writings, he would laugh at Christians how they would
[2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:05.240]  use that.
[2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:09.160]  And it was really, Hitler started that, and then of course our government adopted it.
[2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:14.280]  The 68 gun control act is word for word, because former Senator Dodd, not the current one that
[2:26:14.280 --> 2:26:18.800]  all was dead, he had been on the Nuremberg trial as a lawyer.
[2:26:18.800 --> 2:26:22.880]  And so he took it and changed the German to English, changed the name, and only a few
[2:26:22.880 --> 2:26:24.880]  lines are changed of the bill.
[2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:27.760]  We have the Nazi gun control law here in America.
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:28.760]  So they love it.
[2:26:28.760 --> 2:26:32.040]  I mean, the government hasn't found something the Nazis did they don't love.
[2:26:32.040 --> 2:26:37.440]  Back uniforms, homeland security, it was called right security, land security in Germany.
[2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:42.520]  It's all almost a carbon copy with a little bit of Soviet and East German and Chi-Con
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:44.760]  mixed into the, you know, the management system.
[2:26:44.760 --> 2:26:48.080]  Literally they admit they've drawn from all of these.
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:53.400]  And so Romans 13 is a complete giant stinking fraud, and that's why they teach it in the
[2:26:53.400 --> 2:26:54.400]  churches.
[2:26:54.400 --> 2:26:55.400]  Go ahead.
[2:26:55.400 --> 2:26:58.880]  Okay, and my second part to the question is, we've been talking to some people here in
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:26:59.880]  Arizona.
[2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:03.800]  And one of the ladies said, why would you want to fight it?
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:08.000]  Why not just stand down and let them go ahead and do their tyranny?
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.320]  Why not bring the second coming in?
[2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:13.960]  And I'm thinking, well, it's not really going to bring the second coming in because Christ
[2:27:13.960 --> 2:27:16.480]  is going to come whenever he wants to.
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:21.440]  Not when they say, oh, here, we're going to bring tyranny to everybody so Christ will
[2:27:21.440 --> 2:27:22.440]  come.
[2:27:22.440 --> 2:27:28.160]  And so she basically told my husband and I that we were crazy and that we were lunatics
[2:27:28.160 --> 2:27:32.440]  and we should just stand down and not worry about it, because the government...
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:37.880]  Yeah, Christianity has turned from go out and say slavery is wrong and be killed for
[2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:38.880]  it.
[2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:44.440]  Or, okay, take first century, second century, third century Christians in Rome killed by
[2:27:44.440 --> 2:27:48.880]  the hundreds of thousands over those several hundred years for not bowing down.
[2:27:48.880 --> 2:27:51.120]  Caesar said, you will bow to Jupiter.
[2:27:51.120 --> 2:27:52.600]  You will bow to Saturn.
[2:27:52.600 --> 2:27:54.400]  You will bow to Janus.
[2:27:54.400 --> 2:27:55.400]  You will bow.
[2:27:55.400 --> 2:27:56.400]  And they said, no.
[2:27:56.400 --> 2:27:57.400]  And they said, you die.
[2:27:57.400 --> 2:28:02.920]  And according to the churches today, those Christians are going to hell because they
[2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:05.160]  should have hit their knees to mow it.
[2:28:05.160 --> 2:28:12.280]  Now, it's asinine, but again, look, a cowardly, soft-handed, domesticated people that want
[2:28:12.280 --> 2:28:16.560]  to put on their little dresses and suits and go pimp around at church and the guys find
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:20.160]  boyfriends and the girls find boyfriends, you know, and that's what they do.
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:23.800]  You have the churches of the main homosexual facilities and they go there and that's where
[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:24.800]  they find their...
[2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:26.720]  And that's their sexual preference.
[2:28:26.720 --> 2:28:31.120]  My point is, the mainly Christian churches, the big ones, are for the men to have sex
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:32.280]  with men.
[2:28:32.280 --> 2:28:34.200]  And I'm not trying to shock people here on air.
[2:28:34.200 --> 2:28:35.400]  I mean, this is what I've discovered.
[2:28:35.400 --> 2:28:38.480]  I mean, take Bohemian Grove, Christian conservative leaders go there.
[2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:42.120]  It's a giant 15-day homosexual orgy.
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:44.160]  And I found the liberals like women.
[2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:47.000]  And I mean, you know, it's just...
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  I guess...
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:50.960]  It sounds insane, ladies and gentlemen, but everything's insane.
[2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:51.960]  Anything else, ma'am?
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:28:57.240]  So my husband said, so you're going to teach your kids to stand down and let them rape
[2:28:57.240 --> 2:28:59.680]  and do whatever they want to your kids.
[2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:01.840]  You're going to let them do that to your kids.
[2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:04.400]  And right now, she teaches them home school.
[2:29:04.400 --> 2:29:10.040]  So I said to her, well, then if you say stand down, then why don't you send your kids back
[2:29:10.040 --> 2:29:12.480]  to school so that they can...
[2:29:12.480 --> 2:29:17.400]  So that the government can take control of them and do whatever they want to them and
[2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:21.040]  control them, because obviously that would be standing down.
[2:29:21.040 --> 2:29:23.160]  Oh my God, print that, print that, print that one.
[2:29:23.160 --> 2:29:25.400]  Boy Scout's trained to become Homeland Gestapo.
[2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:27.720]  I told you under Secure Corps, they were doing that, but I didn't...
[2:29:27.720 --> 2:29:29.520]  Oh my God, ma'am, I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[2:29:29.520 --> 2:29:31.880]  I just saw something on screen and blew me away.
[2:29:31.880 --> 2:29:33.440]  What did she say when you said that?
[2:29:33.440 --> 2:29:38.080]  Well, she says, I am actually thinking about sending my kids back to public school.
[2:29:38.080 --> 2:29:39.560]  Oh, it's of the Lord.
[2:29:39.560 --> 2:29:40.560]  And I...
[2:29:40.560 --> 2:29:43.800]  Well, I mean, look, you can't help her move on, pearls before swine.
[2:29:43.800 --> 2:29:47.560]  That lady's going to have a rude awakening when she enters hell, probably.
[2:29:47.560 --> 2:29:51.760]  But, yeah, no, California says it's illegal.
[2:29:51.760 --> 2:30:01.080]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.080 --> 2:30:05.520]  Many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer
[2:30:05.520 --> 2:30:09.920]  provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment.
[2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:16.200]  Studies have shown that a majority of Americans are seriously deficient in basic minerals.
[2:30:16.200 --> 2:30:21.800]  And seeing any one of the more important minerals actually results in disease.

[2:31:01.760 --> 2:31:07.280]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:31:07.280 --> 2:31:13.840]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:31:13.840 --> 2:31:15.160]  just as well-funded.
[2:31:15.160 --> 2:31:20.280]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:31:20.280 --> 2:31:21.800]  of the American people.
[2:31:21.800 --> 2:31:25.840]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[2:31:25.840 --> 2:31:31.280]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:31:31.280 --> 2:31:37.800]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:31:37.800 --> 2:31:41.360]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[2:31:41.360 --> 2:31:48.280]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:33:06.480 --> 2:33:12.160]  This is the story from Kurt Nemo, and it's in the New York Times as well.
[2:33:12.160 --> 2:33:18.440]  I made 22 films and produced a couple more, and I can't even remember anymore.
[2:33:18.440 --> 2:33:24.560]  Is it in Masters of Terror, or is it in Road to Terror near Police State 3, where I show
[2:33:24.560 --> 2:33:31.520]  a clip off of ABC News where it goes in Russia, the foster children, CPS from their parents,
[2:33:31.520 --> 2:33:36.680]  were trained at like age 5 to 18, to karate shop, to attack people, to enforce what the
[2:33:36.680 --> 2:33:37.680]  government wants.
[2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:39.200]  That's where they get their thug police.
[2:33:39.200 --> 2:33:44.120]  It's like universal soldier movie with Russell.
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:46.960]  Boy Scouts trained to become Homeland Gestapo.
[2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:50.360]  Now that's our article, and you can see them there, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv,
[2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:55.120]  all stacked up about the board of Homeland Security Bus.
[2:33:55.120 --> 2:33:57.520]  This is not new news to me.
[2:33:57.520 --> 2:34:04.040]  It's just that the first place I saw this was in 2002, in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[2:34:04.040 --> 2:34:09.600]  It was called Secure Corps, a division of AmeriCorps, and it described the middle school, sixth
[2:34:09.600 --> 2:34:16.040]  and seventh graders, training with, quote, M16s for gun confiscation, door-to-door search,
[2:34:16.040 --> 2:34:21.800]  fugitive apprehension, and it described them with dogs in the woods, with the feds, and
[2:34:21.800 --> 2:34:26.200]  now hundreds of high schools are being converted and run by the Marine Corps and Army, where
[2:34:26.200 --> 2:34:29.880]  they go, oh, your school's now run by the Army, and they just show up in Virginia and
[2:34:29.880 --> 2:34:37.080]  Georgia and Illinois and California and everywhere, Texas, Michigan, I cover that every week now,
[2:34:37.080 --> 2:34:40.760]  and it's all, and then they tell them, you'll be arrested if you don't sign up for the military,
[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:45.040]  and then it's illegal, and the Marines just go, we commit crime, we don't care, you know,
[2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:48.560]  they tell the kids, you'll be go to jail if you don't sign up for this, and you're like,
[2:34:48.560 --> 2:34:52.240]  don't you be anti-Marine, it's good for them to threaten the children and run everything
[2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:55.080]  and run the schools.
[2:34:55.080 --> 2:34:59.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is directly out of the old Soviet Union.
[2:34:59.320 --> 2:35:06.560]  Ten minutes into Arrant Mayhem in his town near the Mexico border, and the gunman, a
[2:35:06.560 --> 2:35:12.040]  disgruntled Iraq war veteran, see, they're training the kids to kill with this, it just
[2:35:12.040 --> 2:35:14.240]  doesn't get any richer than this.
[2:35:14.240 --> 2:35:18.880]  I told you 12 years ago that they had government documents, and we got some of them here, and
[2:35:18.880 --> 2:35:22.560]  people didn't believe it, even when it had the FBI phone numbers on, you could call,
[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:26.560]  saying veterans and gun owners, and those that make frequent references to the Constitution
[2:35:26.560 --> 2:35:31.000]  were quote, constitutional terrorists, in fact, Google constitutional terrorists, let's
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:35.240]  put that on the screen, the actual document from 99 for them, and we got documents in
[2:35:35.240 --> 2:35:37.560]  97 as well.
[2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:43.360]  So they're training to kill the vets, and the vets will say, I'm patriotic, Romans
[2:35:43.360 --> 2:35:49.360]  13, train my kids to kill me, I don't care if Hitler and Stalin did it, it's freedom,
[2:35:49.360 --> 2:35:50.360]  baby.
[2:35:50.360 --> 2:35:54.240]  Man, and they're taking over the Boy Scouts, they're militarizing the fire departments
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:35:59.640]  to have them tattle and spy on citizens, they're federalizing everything, folks.
[2:35:59.640 --> 2:36:03.800]  Ten minutes into the Arrant Mayhem in his town near the Mexico border, and the gunman,
[2:36:03.800 --> 2:36:09.400]  a disgruntled Iraq war veteran, has taken out two people, one slumped in a desk on the
[2:36:09.400 --> 2:36:12.640]  floor covered in blood.
[2:36:12.640 --> 2:36:19.480]  The responding officers, 18 age boys and girls, the youngest 14, face tripwire, a thin cloud
[2:36:19.480 --> 2:36:24.960]  of poisonous gas and loud shots, bam, bam, far from behind a flimsy wall, they move
[2:36:24.960 --> 2:36:29.400]  quickly, pellet guns drawn and mask affixed, see, they know the kids love this, they tell
[2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:32.920]  the kids, we're going to arrest you for BB guns or they're always arresting kids playing
[2:36:32.920 --> 2:36:38.120]  paint gun in the, you know, city park, but you can come join the police and Homeland
[2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:42.320]  Security and have weapons, young man, now tell us about your folks, and you think I'm
[2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:46.080]  joking there, no, I have all the mainstream news articles, that's in road attorney, local
[2:36:46.080 --> 2:36:49.920]  newscasts where they tell kids to paddle on their parents and get $200, I mean, I made
[2:36:49.920 --> 2:36:54.720]  that seven years ago, you can't make this stuff up, this is happening.
[2:36:54.720 --> 2:36:59.720]  So continuing here, the responding officers, 18 age boys and girls, the youngest 14, face
[2:36:59.720 --> 2:37:05.440]  tripwire, a thin cloud of poisonous gas and loud shots, bam, bam, far from behind a flimsy
[2:37:05.440 --> 2:37:10.280]  wall, they move quickly, pellet guns drawn and mask affixed, United States border patrol,
[2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:14.720]  put your hands up, screams one voice, cracking with adolescent determination as a suspect
[2:37:14.720 --> 2:37:19.000]  as a dude, now let me stop you right there, I've noticed with the Homeland Security TV
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:24.160]  show, about six months ago, a caller called before it was even on air and said, there's
[2:37:24.160 --> 2:37:29.480]  a new Homeland Security show, and I remember going, it'll, and I remember going, hold on,
[2:37:29.480 --> 2:37:33.960]  it'll be set on the border, and the caller said, yeah, I just saw the ad, how did you
[2:37:33.960 --> 2:37:34.960]  know that?
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:38.440]  And I said, I know the enemy, and my point is, I'm not here tooting my horn, I'm trying
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:44.640]  to explain to you, I know their program, what is popular, 91% in every Gallup poll
[2:37:44.640 --> 2:37:49.280]  they've had or higher, of Americans, all Americans, you know, a cross section, a black
[2:37:49.280 --> 2:37:55.920]  Hispanic white, 91%, it's 70 plus percent, we just called Hispanics, so they're against
[2:37:55.920 --> 2:38:01.920]  open borders as well, want the border militarized, which is constitutional, so that TV show to
[2:38:01.920 --> 2:38:06.800]  popularize Homeland Security is going to show you something popular, not Homeland Security
[2:38:06.800 --> 2:38:10.760]  training to take your guns, not Homeland Security spying on you without warrants, not Homeland
[2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:15.360]  Security training and building up to go out for veterans and gun owners and conservatives,
[2:38:15.360 --> 2:38:18.920]  they're going to say Homeland Security's for foreign terrorists and it's for illegal
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:20.600]  aliens.
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:25.200]  And the parents of these kids are just pleased as punch, man, you're going to go fight illegal
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:30.840]  aliens that are killing people, no, you're not, now, now, now, now see, they're playing
[2:38:30.840 --> 2:38:38.880]  the part of Border Patrol here, but when you read their training to have the Border Patrol
[2:38:38.880 --> 2:38:47.320]  fight American citizens, a disgruntled U.S. veteran, now, they have these training drills
[2:38:47.320 --> 2:38:53.160]  all over the country, we've pulled up on screen and covered the really famous ones in Michigan
[2:38:53.160 --> 2:38:57.800]  a few years ago, AP reported it, we covered just a few weeks ago again, where they came
[2:38:57.800 --> 2:39:01.280]  in the school and said, we're going to kill all of you, we're homeschoolers against public
[2:39:01.280 --> 2:39:04.880]  school and then said, I'm pro second amendment, I'm going to kill you to terrorize the kids
[2:39:04.880 --> 2:39:06.520]  and make them hate the second amendment.
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:10.200]  And then when the local sheriff got in trouble, he said, well, the feds gave us the script
[2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:13.240]  and the grant, we're just doing what they told us.
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:15.800]  So you see, that's how they roll.
[2:39:15.800 --> 2:39:21.160]  Yeah, here's the constitutional terrorist thing, it says defenders of U.S. Constitution
[2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:26.920]  against federal government and U.N. Super Patriots terrorist, it says make numerous
[2:39:26.920 --> 2:39:31.400]  references to U.S. Constitution claim driving is a right, not a privilege, attempt to police
[2:39:31.400 --> 2:39:37.960]  the police, how dare citizens be involved in that, it goes on to say, you know, just
[2:39:37.960 --> 2:39:43.000]  unbelievable ladies and gentlemen, it talks about second amendment groups.
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:46.040]  So you can go, you can go read that for yourself.
[2:39:46.040 --> 2:39:52.560]  Now, number one threats the veterans, they really want their training your children.
[2:39:52.560 --> 2:39:58.640]  The Eagle Scouts now on their little power trips.
[2:39:58.640 --> 2:40:03.040]  Look at these guys, some of these guys are supposedly 16, they're like they're two.
[2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:10.840]  I mean, I gotta say, these, these, these, these 14, 15, 16 year olds, they just literally
[2:40:10.840 --> 2:40:15.160]  look, well, I'll tell you what, when I was 14, I took every one of them on, I'll tell
[2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:17.840]  you right now, these guys look like a bunch of wimps.
[2:40:17.840 --> 2:40:20.360]  I'm sorry, I just can't help it anymore.
[2:40:20.360 --> 2:40:23.240]  They're probably nice kids and their parents are just idiots, Florida heads.
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:29.520]  I guarantee you, every one of these kids parents loves Jack Bauer and fantasizes watching 24.
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:32.880]  And these kids are going to be men in just a year or two.
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:36.440]  And they're, you know, they're going to go after you're a veteran with guns.
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:37.840]  You want to know who's coming through your door.
[2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:40.600]  It's going to be guys being trained by these programs.
[2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:43.760]  Show ladies and gentlemen, the training photos, go back to them.
[2:40:43.760 --> 2:40:56.560]  This is children, this is children training to kill US veterans.
[2:40:56.560 --> 2:41:01.000]  And again, Curtin M. O. Paul Watson and probably posted 50, 60 articles this bad today.
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:02.480]  I can't even read them all anymore.
[2:41:02.480 --> 2:41:03.920]  It's, I haven't even covered it.
[2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:04.920]  It's totally overwhelmed.
[2:41:04.920 --> 2:41:07.080]  We got a bowl of missing total insanity.
[2:41:07.080 --> 2:41:09.480]  I told you the last virus was engineered in the lab.
[2:41:09.480 --> 2:41:10.480]  It's now admitted.
[2:41:10.480 --> 2:41:12.880]  They're saying it's going to mutate and kill everybody in the fall.
[2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:16.000]  Just like I told you they would, I know these people.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:19.840]  I know these people.
[2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:20.840]  It goes on.
[2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:21.840]  United States Border Patrol.
[2:41:21.840 --> 2:41:29.840]  I'm going to read this again, 10 minutes into the errant mayhem in the town near the
[2:41:29.840 --> 2:41:32.740]  Mexico border.
[2:41:32.740 --> 2:41:36.200]  And the gunman, a disgruntled Iraq war veteran has already taken out two people.
[2:41:36.200 --> 2:41:41.600]  So they're practicing to take out themselves when they're done being paramilitary forces
[2:41:41.600 --> 2:41:43.040]  and they finally rebel later.
[2:41:43.040 --> 2:41:46.040]  When they get old enough, they'll have the new youngins to kill them.
[2:41:46.040 --> 2:41:49.840]  That's how it worked in Germany, Russia, China.
[2:41:49.840 --> 2:41:51.200]  Because when, I mean, let's, let's face it.
[2:41:51.200 --> 2:41:52.720]  When you're 18, you're dumber than dirt.
[2:41:52.720 --> 2:41:53.720]  I certainly was.
[2:41:53.720 --> 2:41:54.720]  And I was smart.
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:41:57.600]  And most people who were 18, I learned more and more every day, I get more and more wisdom
[2:41:57.600 --> 2:41:58.600]  and knowledge.
[2:41:58.600 --> 2:42:01.320]  I can't imagine how much knowledge I'll have if I live another 20 years.
[2:42:01.320 --> 2:42:05.000]  I mean, right now I'm not even saying on that smart, my brain burns with connections and
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:06.800]  understanding and research.
[2:42:06.800 --> 2:42:10.000]  And I look back at myself 10 years ago, I mean, I was a blithering idiot.
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:12.120]  What will it be like in 10 years?
[2:42:12.120 --> 2:42:13.120]  These kids don't know.
[2:42:13.120 --> 2:42:17.000]  These are nice kids, I'm sure.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:24.240]  Oh, man, the girl is just unbelievable in the middle.
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:26.800]  I mean, look at her, man.
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:29.960]  When your family's pulled over to checkpoint and they're walking around with the German
[2:42:29.960 --> 2:42:30.960]  shepherds.
[2:42:30.960 --> 2:42:31.960]  Let me tell you something.
[2:42:31.960 --> 2:42:32.960]  You go to demonstration.
[2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:33.960]  They got German shepherds.
[2:42:33.960 --> 2:42:37.280]  I mean, the government is rogue, folks.
[2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:38.280]  And I've had enough of it.
[2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:41.080]  Let me tell you, this government sure wants a fight.
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:45.040]  I tell you, they sure want one, don't they?
[2:42:45.040 --> 2:42:49.120]  I tell you, it's going to be 1776 if it does go to physical blows.
[2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:53.280]  All these people all day want to sit around and talk about how the government's going
[2:42:53.280 --> 2:42:58.120]  to whoop our butt because they got all this technology baloney.
[2:42:58.120 --> 2:43:05.680]  No one can stop a guerrilla decentralized lone wolf army over 100 million gun owners
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:11.680]  in this country.
[2:43:11.680 --> 2:43:16.120]  And I don't want to come to that, but it looks like they're not going to give us a choice.
[2:43:16.120 --> 2:43:19.480]  Let's hold out as long as we can peacefully, but you can't put up with where I'm trying
[2:43:19.480 --> 2:43:25.560]  to take your guns and take you to FEMA camps, you know, and I know this is going on.
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:30.920]  I keep telling listeners they've got giant cadres of youth now for at least seven years.
[2:43:30.920 --> 2:43:35.200]  I know of who are now, I guess, if you were 14 then.
[2:43:35.200 --> 2:43:42.440]  And now it's seven years later, you'd be 21, 22.
[2:43:42.440 --> 2:43:45.680]  And that's why these are the guys, these are the guys that arrest you when you try to go
[2:43:45.680 --> 2:43:47.400]  photograph the builder bar group.
[2:43:47.400 --> 2:43:49.360]  These are the guys that tell you you don't have free speech.
[2:43:49.360 --> 2:43:50.360]  These are the guys.
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:53.760]  Now, now these young kids, I want to try to get some of their parents on.
[2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:55.280]  I mean, I'm sure they're nice people.
[2:43:55.280 --> 2:43:57.960]  I mean, well, road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[2:43:57.960 --> 2:44:01.600]  It's all quite a step forward from the square knot.
[2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:02.600]  That's right.
[2:44:02.600 --> 2:44:07.520]  You know, how to build a fire or, you know, how to survive in the wilderness or how to
[2:44:07.520 --> 2:44:10.720]  learn morals or the Constitution Bill of Rights, they don't, by the way, they don't teach that
[2:44:10.720 --> 2:44:11.720]  in Boy Scouts anymore.
[2:44:11.720 --> 2:44:14.600]  I went and looked at what they teach them now and I said, I'm sorry, I guess my son
[2:44:14.600 --> 2:44:15.600]  can't be in that.
[2:44:15.600 --> 2:44:18.440]  It's basically like a communist organization now.
[2:44:18.440 --> 2:44:26.080]  The explorers program, a coeducational, coeducational affiliate, yeah, can't have the Boy Scouts
[2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:27.080]  just be boys.
[2:44:27.080 --> 2:44:28.840]  See, it's totally different.
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:33.040]  A lot of these Boy Scout things are just basically places for your children to be molested.
[2:44:33.040 --> 2:44:36.560]  I mean, I'm sorry to have to report that to you, but that's basically what it's turned
[2:44:36.560 --> 2:44:37.560]  into.
[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:43.120]  I'm sorry, we don't get the Boy Scouts back till we take it back over.
[2:44:43.120 --> 2:44:46.440]  Boy Scouts of America that began 60 years ago was training thousands of young people
[2:44:46.440 --> 2:44:51.440]  in skills using confront terrorism, illegal immigration and escalating border violence.
[2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:53.240]  No, that's not.
[2:44:53.240 --> 2:44:55.320]  It's they're training them to kill US vets.
[2:44:55.320 --> 2:44:58.200]  They admitted it in the first line.
[2:44:58.200 --> 2:45:02.520]  An intense ratcheting up of one of the group's longtime missions to prepare youth for traditional
[2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:04.880]  jobs as police officers and firefighters.
[2:45:04.880 --> 2:45:07.720]  And that is why they started it.
[2:45:07.720 --> 2:45:12.120]  They started the NRA because the North couldn't shoot, not bashing people up North.
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:18.560]  They'd become, you know, city dwellers, everybody from the South had come from the North.
[2:45:18.560 --> 2:45:22.600]  And so, you know, the North had three times the troops that could barely beat the South
[2:45:22.600 --> 2:45:23.760]  in four years.
[2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:25.200]  And so they had a public proclamation.
[2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:30.600]  The federal government funded the NRA to train school kids how to shoot.
[2:45:30.600 --> 2:45:35.200]  And they also set up the Boy Scouts to, you know, prepare them for how to carry a pack,
[2:45:35.200 --> 2:45:37.720]  how to follow discipline, how to follow orders.
[2:45:37.720 --> 2:45:43.480]  Now, that's a far human cry, though, from training them to kill veterans.
[2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:44.480]  That isn't patriotic.
[2:45:44.480 --> 2:45:46.760]  Training them to kill vets, isn't patriotic.
[2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:48.560]  Let me say it again.
[2:45:48.560 --> 2:45:52.960]  You start to see how the Homeland Security documents about vets and gun owners.
[2:45:52.960 --> 2:45:54.800]  The Boy Scouts is about that.
[2:45:54.800 --> 2:45:55.800]  Everything is about that.
[2:45:55.800 --> 2:45:58.680]  And they got a bill introduced where if they say you're an extremist, you don't get to
[2:45:58.680 --> 2:45:59.680]  own a gun.
[2:45:59.680 --> 2:46:01.560]  No judge, no jury, no appeal.
[2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:04.680]  Somebody on death row gets appeals, but you as a gun owner don't.
[2:46:04.680 --> 2:46:09.120]  But you were like, oh, that's good for them, Al-Qaeda, take all their rights away.
[2:46:09.120 --> 2:46:15.120]  But then now you're learning it's for you, confronting terrorism about killing the vets.
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:18.480]  And I'm not just saying that.
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:23.160]  This is how they take over in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.
[2:46:23.160 --> 2:46:27.280]  Who was the first group Hitler culled when he got to power the police and military?
[2:46:27.280 --> 2:46:29.560]  He killed hundreds of thousands in that first year.
[2:46:29.560 --> 2:46:31.160]  Get ready, cops.
[2:46:31.160 --> 2:46:33.560]  Get ready, military.
[2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:36.400]  Get ready, business owners.
[2:46:36.400 --> 2:46:41.560]  This is about being a true-blooded American guy and girl said A.J. Lowenfall, a sheriff's
[2:46:41.560 --> 2:46:48.400]  deputy here in Emerald Imperial County, whose life clock he says is set around the explorer's
[2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:49.400]  events.
[2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:50.400]  He helps run.
[2:46:50.400 --> 2:46:54.080]  He gets right in with the honor and bravery of the Boy Scouts, and again, it's Homeland
[2:46:54.080 --> 2:46:55.440]  Security funding this.
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:46:57.920]  This isn't the local sheriff.
[2:46:57.920 --> 2:47:01.360]  In fact, my dad sent this to me two weeks ago, and I keep meaning to print it.
[2:47:01.360 --> 2:47:05.320]  We go look at Aaron Dyke's printer, and I was, is Aaron here yet?
[2:47:05.320 --> 2:47:10.400]  I want that email my dad sent me and it describes life in 56 compared to life today.
[2:47:10.400 --> 2:47:14.720]  I don't know if we posted that, but we just bring it to me.
[2:47:14.720 --> 2:47:18.080]  I said, I'd take your calls, but how do I even do it?
[2:47:18.080 --> 2:47:19.080]  I don't even want to do this.
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:24.920]  I want to fight him, but I mean, I want to expose the globalist, but I just can't believe
[2:47:24.920 --> 2:47:29.840]  how hardcore the tyranny is.
[2:47:29.840 --> 2:47:31.880]  You've got to get the exact headline to find it.
[2:47:31.880 --> 2:47:33.640]  It's an email.
[2:47:33.640 --> 2:47:40.600]  It's life in 1956 school compared to 2008.
[2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:41.600]  You've seen it?
[2:47:41.600 --> 2:47:46.480]  Well, yeah, and literally when my dad was going to school in the mid-1960s, you know,
[2:47:46.480 --> 2:47:51.320]  he was in college in 67, 68, 69, 70.
[2:47:51.320 --> 2:47:56.240]  He would literally take a shotgun to school and, you know, ride on the school bus with
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:48:01.760]  it and then go shooting after school with the football coaches and his history teacher.
[2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:05.800]  And now, you know, of course, back then you didn't have mass shootings.
[2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:09.960]  You have mass shootings as we're a mentally ill degenerate Prozac society.
[2:48:09.960 --> 2:48:14.160]  By the way, they tested the blood of that chimpanzee that murdered that lady and attacked
[2:48:14.160 --> 2:48:15.160]  the police.
[2:48:15.160 --> 2:48:17.860]  He was on a serotonin reup taken him under.
[2:48:17.860 --> 2:48:22.040]  He was on Xanax and I told you that monkey was going to be, and I know it's not a monkey.
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:23.040]  It's an ape.
[2:48:23.040 --> 2:48:27.960]  I told you that primate was going to be on it because apes rarely do that unless they're
[2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:32.720]  hopped up on drugs.
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:37.360]  Chimpanzees killing people, Prozac, people killing their parents, Prozac, and it's now
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:39.440]  on the drug insert.
[2:48:39.440 --> 2:48:45.040]  No, it doesn't even matter.
[2:48:45.040 --> 2:48:46.040]  And it just goes on.
[2:48:46.040 --> 2:48:52.560]  It says Kathy Norigo 16 said she was attracted by the guns.
[2:48:52.560 --> 2:48:54.240]  See, it's a message.
[2:48:54.240 --> 2:48:55.240]  You can't have guns.
[2:48:55.240 --> 2:48:58.800]  It's a side of their bad unless you're with the government had, oh God, you get to use
[2:48:58.800 --> 2:49:02.160]  them on little old ladies and get the gun people down in the back every day and we'll
[2:49:02.160 --> 2:49:03.640]  cover up for you.
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:07.040]  Oh, it's so good.
[2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:18.560]  Oh, they also have them take online.
[2:49:18.560 --> 2:49:22.320]  They also have them take sensitivity training.
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:24.680]  And so they also indoctrinate them in an ADL script.
[2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:27.320]  I know it's just unbelievable brainwashing.
[2:49:27.320 --> 2:49:32.040]  Oh my God, I can't handle it anymore.
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:36.640]  If there are critics of the content or purpose of law enforcement training, they have not
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:41.040]  made themselves known to the explorers, national organization, Irving, Texas, or to the volunteers
[2:49:41.040 --> 2:49:42.760]  here on the ground.
[2:49:42.760 --> 2:49:46.560]  National officials and local leaders said they said the explorers have faced problems
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:47.560]  over the years.
[2:49:47.560 --> 2:49:51.440]  There have been numerous cases over the last decades in which police officers supervising
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:55.360]  explorers have been charged in civil and criminal cases with sexually abusing them.
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:49:59.680]  Well, I told you, you give your kids to the Boy Scouts or public school.
[2:49:59.680 --> 2:50:01.120]  It's a rape room, basically.
[2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:02.120]  I just said that.
[2:50:02.120 --> 2:50:07.480]  I haven't even read the article yet, and I told you it'd be in there.
[2:50:07.480 --> 2:50:09.360]  And the Boy Scouts used to be the best thing out there.
[2:50:09.360 --> 2:50:12.480]  But this is, look, this country's full of evil people now.
[2:50:12.480 --> 2:50:14.160]  We became evil.
[2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:15.920]  This country's falling apart.
[2:50:15.920 --> 2:50:17.760]  And you put your children in public school.
[2:50:17.760 --> 2:50:20.800]  You put them in some kind of cop program.
[2:50:20.800 --> 2:50:23.960]  If you read criminology, you know where real child defenders go.
[2:50:23.960 --> 2:50:25.480]  They want to be truancy officers.
[2:50:25.480 --> 2:50:29.760]  They want to be CPS people.
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:33.560]  I'm not saying all the CPS people are cops or pedophiles.
[2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:37.200]  I'm saying that's where you find the biggest percentage of them.
[2:50:37.200 --> 2:50:38.680]  I don't even feel like doing the show anymore.
[2:50:38.680 --> 2:50:42.600]  It makes me so sick.
[2:50:42.600 --> 2:50:43.960]  I just want to beat these tyrants.
[2:50:43.960 --> 2:50:45.400]  I just want to defeat them.
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:46.840]  I'm tired of the New World Order.
[2:50:46.840 --> 2:50:49.360]  I'm tired of the degenerate scum.
[2:50:49.360 --> 2:50:51.440]  I'm tired of all the corruption.
[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:53.560]  I'm tired of evil.
[2:50:53.560 --> 2:50:55.000]  I'm tired of it.
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:59.680]  It's time for good people to start whooping some New World Order, fighting the Info War.

[2:51:07.160 --> 2:51:08.880]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[2:51:08.880 --> 2:51:09.840]  Think about it.

[2:52:00.040 --> 2:52:01.880]  Hey, folks.
[2:52:01.880 --> 2:52:02.880]  Alex Jones here.
[2:52:02.880 --> 2:52:06.640]  I'm sitting out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt
[2:52:06.640 --> 2:52:08.240]  and struggling to make payments.
[2:52:08.240 --> 2:52:12.720]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number due to a declining economy and credit
[2:52:12.720 --> 2:52:13.720]  crisis.
[2:52:13.720 --> 2:52:18.720]  You now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more
[2:52:18.720 --> 2:52:20.320]  by calling the bailout group.
[2:52:20.320 --> 2:52:25.160]  This program has already settled over $100 million of debt and are saving individual
[2:52:25.160 --> 2:52:27.560]  consumers thousands of dollars.
[2:52:27.560 --> 2:52:31.240]  Folks if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments,
[2:52:31.240 --> 2:52:33.720]  the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.
[2:52:33.720 --> 2:52:38.440]  Call the bailout group today at 1-800-324-6554.
[2:52:38.440 --> 2:52:40.360]  I hope our listeners take advantage of this.

[2:52:43.880 --> 2:52:44.880]  the phone.

[2:52:52.920 --> 2:53:06.760]  That number again is 1-800-324-6554-800-324-6554, the bailout group.
[2:53:06.760 --> 2:53:10.640]  Have you ever noticed that celebrities are endorsing weight loss products in health
[2:53:10.640 --> 2:53:11.640]  aids?
[2:53:11.640 --> 2:53:15.160]  And do you think they endorse these products for free?
[2:53:15.160 --> 2:53:16.400]  I don't think so.
[2:53:16.400 --> 2:53:20.720]  I'm here to tell you, I'm not a celebrity and life change tea doesn't need one.
[2:53:20.720 --> 2:53:24.560]  Think about this, the product speaks for itself.
[2:53:24.560 --> 2:53:26.000]  What a concept.
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:27.640]  Our product works.
[2:53:27.640 --> 2:53:30.320]  You get healthy and you'll lose weight.
[2:53:30.320 --> 2:53:31.320]  Summer's coming.

[2:53:32.320 --> 2:53:33.320]  Order now.
[2:53:33.320 --> 2:53:37.440]  928-308-0408.
[2:53:37.440 --> 2:53:43.480]  Take this down, 928-308-0408 or you can order online.
[2:53:43.480 --> 2:53:44.480]  It's easy.
[2:53:44.480 --> 2:53:46.040]  Getthetea.com.
[2:53:46.040 --> 2:53:47.040]  That's getthetea.com.
[2:53:47.040 --> 2:53:55.000]  You have nothing to lose, but the excess around your, anyway, life change tea.
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:53:56.680]  It speaks for itself.
[2:53:56.680 --> 2:54:08.880]  It's getthetea.com.
[2:54:08.880 --> 2:54:09.880]  Okay here's an example.
[2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:10.880]  I'm not going to say any news.
[2:54:10.880 --> 2:54:17.240]  I'm not going to say any names here on the news, but we were just having a discussion
[2:54:17.240 --> 2:54:22.200]  about, hey, I hope the listeners realize I'm not even bashing the Boy Scouts.
[2:54:22.200 --> 2:54:28.120]  Any organized thing with children today is going to have government perverts involved
[2:54:28.120 --> 2:54:29.120]  in it.
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:32.240]  The perverts know where to get in the system to operate, and the one guy here who's an
[2:54:32.240 --> 2:54:36.160]  Eagle Scout, he said, no, I had to switch troops because that was all going on.
[2:54:36.160 --> 2:54:37.920]  And I said, how bad was it?
[2:54:37.920 --> 2:54:41.880]  He said, I don't want to even talk about it, but nothing happened to me, but I got out
[2:54:41.880 --> 2:54:43.000]  of there.
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:44.480]  That's what I'm talking about, folks.
[2:54:44.480 --> 2:54:47.600]  I'm here to warn people about what's going on.
[2:54:47.600 --> 2:54:49.320]  Don't drink the tap water.
[2:54:49.320 --> 2:54:55.640]  Don't put your kids in the Boy Scouts until you've, you know what, I'll say this.
[2:54:55.640 --> 2:55:00.240]  I told my wife, I said, we can't have our son in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts
[2:55:00.240 --> 2:55:01.720]  because I'm too busy to be there.
[2:55:01.720 --> 2:55:05.440]  I said, I know there's good troops and there's good people out there, but I'd have to be
[2:55:05.440 --> 2:55:09.960]  there at every meeting because nobody's getting near my kids.
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:14.640]  And I'm telling you, folks, that's what this, and by the way, the CPS exposes coming up
[2:55:14.640 --> 2:55:15.640]  in 30 minutes.
[2:55:15.640 --> 2:55:19.720]  It's coming up right now for 30 minutes, and then I'm going to continue with your phone
[2:55:19.720 --> 2:55:21.480]  calls and a giant news blitz.
[2:55:21.480 --> 2:55:23.080]  I am just out of control today.
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:29.920]  By the way, coming out in about two weeks, the film's done the trailers up on infowars.com.
[2:55:29.920 --> 2:55:34.360]  We had hundreds of requests to take the prisonplanet.tv interview we did with Aaron Russo, his last
[2:55:34.360 --> 2:55:38.800]  videotaped interview before he died of cancer and to put it on DVD.
[2:55:38.800 --> 2:55:39.800]  And so we did that.
[2:55:39.800 --> 2:55:40.800]  And that's what it is.
[2:55:40.800 --> 2:55:44.400]  It's the interview with Aaron Russo and there's like 10 minutes of interview that we didn't
[2:55:44.400 --> 2:55:47.800]  put on the web that's in there, and we put articles and documents over him talking, and
[2:55:47.800 --> 2:55:48.800]  I think it's very effective.
[2:55:48.800 --> 2:55:53.680]  It's been seen millions of times online and it's all over the place, but this is upgraded
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:55:58.040]  and added and has some commentary where I update the latest info and it's all about
[2:55:58.040 --> 2:55:59.520]  abolishing the Federal Reserve.
[2:55:59.520 --> 2:56:03.760]  So preorder that at infowars.com, I think it's very important and it'll be effective
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:04.760]  to wake folks up.
[2:56:04.760 --> 2:56:08.720]  Plus, it's kind of an infomercial for Aaron and freedom of fascism and the work he's
[2:56:08.720 --> 2:56:09.720]  done.
[2:56:09.720 --> 2:56:11.960]  Hope folks appreciate that out there.
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:12.960]  God knows.
[2:56:12.960 --> 2:56:17.800]  Now, also, every month we're going to have a best of.
[2:56:17.800 --> 2:56:18.800]  This is January.
[2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:23.800]  It's David Ike and Alan Watt and a bunch of other people, Joe Rogan, and they're already
[2:56:23.800 --> 2:56:26.240]  up to four or five months in, but those are all being made right now.
[2:56:26.240 --> 2:56:30.840]  We're going to start offering each month's best interviews in a two-hour boil down with
[2:56:30.840 --> 2:56:33.200]  documents and music and things.
[2:56:33.200 --> 2:56:35.480]  That's 1495infowars.com.
[2:56:35.480 --> 2:56:41.040]  People kept asking for that, so we're going to have the DVD arsenal for everybody at infowars.com
[2:56:41.040 --> 2:56:42.040]  as well.
[2:56:42.040 --> 2:56:43.040]  Go get those.
[2:56:43.040 --> 2:56:47.600]  In fact, maybe run in the DVD of the one that's actually printed, the one that's gone.
[2:56:47.600 --> 2:56:49.560]  It was around here somewhere, Rob.
[2:56:49.560 --> 2:56:50.560]  It doesn't matter.
[2:56:50.560 --> 2:56:55.120]  Here's some of the covers of some of the future months that are coming out.
[2:56:55.120 --> 2:56:59.800]  Now, before I go any further, I also want to tell you about a few sponsors, because
[2:56:59.800 --> 2:57:01.480]  this is who makes the show possible.
[2:57:01.480 --> 2:57:04.520]  This one is just our fabulous folks, and when I say this, I mean it.
[2:57:04.520 --> 2:57:06.160]  They got the best prices I've seen anywhere.
[2:57:06.160 --> 2:57:11.360]  They've been around since 1994, and you better get tasers and stun guns before they start
[2:57:11.360 --> 2:57:15.840]  restricting them to the public, because tasers and stun guns don't have the lobby that Second
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:19.960]  Amendment groups do, and I believe in these as great self-defense items in a lot of cities
[2:57:19.960 --> 2:57:21.760]  and states where guns are restricted.
[2:57:21.760 --> 2:57:26.160]  You can have a taser or a stun gun or pepper spray.
[2:57:26.160 --> 2:57:27.160]  Check them out.
[2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:28.160]  pepperspray.com.

[2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:41.960]  That's one word, pepper, P-E-P-P-E-R, spray, S-P-R-A-Y.com.
[2:57:41.960 --> 2:57:47.240]  And there's a banner up on infowars.com, and they just have fabulous deals on stun guns
[2:57:47.240 --> 2:57:48.240]  and tasers.
[2:57:48.240 --> 2:57:52.280]  You can check your state laws there, but it's just good to have these, and they're good
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:53.280]  to have in your area.
[2:57:53.280 --> 2:57:54.280]  Almost everywhere.
[2:57:54.280 --> 2:57:55.280]  It's legal still.
[2:57:55.280 --> 2:57:57.200]  So, even areas where the Second Amendment is restricted.

[2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:21.960]  The website is MySolarBackup.com.

[3:00:57.520 --> 3:00:58.520]  You're on the air.
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:00:59.520]  Welcome.
[3:00:59.520 --> 3:01:00.520]  Hi, Alex.
[3:01:00.520 --> 3:01:01.520]  Nice to meet you, sir.
[3:01:01.520 --> 3:01:02.520]  Hey, buddy.
[3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:03.520]  First-time caller.
[3:01:03.520 --> 3:01:04.520]  Welcome.
[3:01:04.520 --> 3:01:07.960]  I got a question for you.
[3:01:07.960 --> 3:01:09.360]  I was in military for eight years.
[3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:13.320]  I got out last year, a friend of mine, Mark, woke me up to your shows.
[3:01:13.320 --> 3:01:16.240]  I watched all your shows, great shows, by the way.
[3:01:16.240 --> 3:01:21.720]  We spent about $300,000 to buy a piece of property in the middle of nowhere, got it set up for
[3:01:21.720 --> 3:01:26.720]  an emergency, and we picked four other people with good skills in certain areas to get it
[3:01:26.720 --> 3:01:27.720]  all set up.
[3:01:27.720 --> 3:01:32.040]  Now, we live about two and a half hours away from this camp that we set up.
[3:01:32.040 --> 3:01:36.160]  Do you think by watching everything like a hawk and listening to you every day and everything,
[3:01:36.160 --> 3:01:39.400]  do you think we're going to have enough time to get out of here, to get to that middle
[3:01:39.400 --> 3:01:40.400]  of nowhere, please?
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:44.840]  Number one, you trust these people, though it's fun to secret agent, I'm not saying
[3:01:44.840 --> 3:01:48.160]  you're doing this, to secret agent around and call it your secret camp, I'd call it
[3:01:48.160 --> 3:01:55.960]  your deer camp, and you're a gun club, and that's the end of it.
[3:01:55.960 --> 3:02:00.040]  I don't know your geography, I don't know what's around you, but what they'll do is
[3:02:00.040 --> 3:02:03.400]  they'll announce, oh, we've got a new plague that's been released, we don't know if it's
[3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:08.160]  deadly, and they'll do it enough times with soft kill ones that aren't very strong, I've
[3:02:08.160 --> 3:02:11.640]  always said this, and I didn't just start saying this with the flu, folks, three weeks
[3:02:11.640 --> 3:02:16.680]  ago, that then they'll release the really big one, and then everybody will stand down,
[3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:20.440]  then they'll lock the cities down, that's what these dry run drills are about, but depending
[3:02:20.440 --> 3:02:27.160]  on where you live, I really can't advise you, you sound like a pretty smart guy, but every
[3:02:27.160 --> 3:02:32.160]  time there's some type of scare or bird flu thing going on, or if you hear a nuke went
[3:02:32.160 --> 3:02:36.800]  off 10 states away from you, you better get out of the city then if you don't want to
[3:02:36.800 --> 3:02:41.640]  be locked down in the city, now does that mean every time you leave that they're not
[3:02:41.640 --> 3:02:47.560]  going to lock down, no, but if you want to be safe, I mean, during this swine flu thing
[3:02:47.560 --> 3:02:51.840]  I was saying probably stage manufacture just to scare people, but we got to take them serious
[3:02:51.840 --> 3:02:55.800]  when they say this, this could be their move, because of what they've done in the past,
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:03:01.400]  I had my family on standby with packed bags, the storeable foods ready to leave, and we
[3:03:01.400 --> 3:03:05.840]  were on standby, and I was going to debate whether I'd let jettison my family to a safe
[3:03:05.840 --> 3:03:09.960]  location, and whether I was going to stay here, I mean, it was going to be some killer
[3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:13.480]  thing killing everybody, I was going to bring food and cots into my office, and I was going
[3:03:13.480 --> 3:03:18.480]  to stay here and go down with the ship, because that's our job, but where do you live, you
[3:03:18.480 --> 3:03:21.640]  say you live in New York, New York City, or New York state?
[3:03:21.640 --> 3:03:25.680]  Niagara Falls, New York, I literally live like 15 minutes, I could see the border for
[3:03:25.680 --> 3:03:26.680]  my house.
[3:03:26.680 --> 3:03:31.920]  Well, you're in a security zone, and I have a lot of back roads and everything that we
[3:03:31.920 --> 3:03:35.040]  planned out, that we want to take any main roads or anything to get back down to the
[3:03:35.040 --> 3:03:36.040]  deer camp.
[3:03:36.040 --> 3:03:37.040]  Sounds like you've got everything.
[3:03:37.040 --> 3:03:41.360]  We have all that planned out, we just don't, I'm just, we're watching everything like
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:45.920]  a hawk, so we can try to figure out a trigger to when to get the hell out of here.
[3:03:45.920 --> 3:03:50.440]  Well, that's good, and that sounds like you know what you're doing, I would have a map
[3:03:50.440 --> 3:03:56.120]  with highlighted back roads, of course, Homeland Security said in 2004 that's an act of terrorism,
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:04:00.240]  you have a road atlas in your car, but terrorists are terrorists, you know, veterans, gun owners,
[3:04:00.240 --> 3:04:04.360]  atlas owners, people wearing blue jeans, people with cell phones, people with white vans,
[3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:08.760]  that's all listed, everything's listed, everyone's a terrorist, and they've got the youth squads
[3:04:08.760 --> 3:04:11.640]  training to, hey, what do you think about the Boy Scouts training to hunt you down and
[3:04:11.640 --> 3:04:12.640]  kill you?
[3:04:12.640 --> 3:04:13.640]  It's insane.
[3:04:13.640 --> 3:04:16.120]  Well, but it isn't insane.
[3:04:16.120 --> 3:04:17.360]  I can't believe it.
[3:04:17.360 --> 3:04:20.480]  Every other nation that went to tyranny did that.
[3:04:20.480 --> 3:04:28.640]  Well, really weird is when I first went into military, and I went in around 9-11, I ended
[3:04:28.640 --> 3:04:33.640]  up in Iraq twice, first time I came back, I noticed something different about my country,
[3:04:33.640 --> 3:04:39.520]  I loved my country to death, the second time I came back, it was just like, I don't recognize
[3:04:39.520 --> 3:04:42.280]  my own country anymore, things have changed so much.
[3:04:42.280 --> 3:04:46.640]  They just had a big university do a study, the United States is the sixth worst police
[3:04:46.640 --> 3:04:49.200]  state in the world, England's the fifth worst.
[3:04:49.200 --> 3:04:53.520]  I mean, there's only North Korea and a few others ahead of us now.
[3:04:53.520 --> 3:04:57.400]  People don't realize, folks, that on the scale, we're as bad as it gets.
[3:04:57.400 --> 3:04:58.400]  Stay there.
[3:04:58.400 --> 3:04:59.400]  Stay there.
[3:04:59.400 --> 3:05:01.400]  I want to let you be able to finish up, sir.
[3:05:01.400 --> 3:05:02.400]  Hello, friends.
[3:05:02.400 --> 3:05:03.400]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:05:03.400 --> 3:05:06.800]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today, that's more
[3:05:06.800 --> 3:05:07.800]  important than ever.
[3:05:07.800 --> 3:05:10.800]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[3:05:10.800 --> 3:05:13.600]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[3:05:13.600 --> 3:05:17.600]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[3:05:17.600 --> 3:05:21.440]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family
[3:05:21.440 --> 3:05:23.160]  in the final equation between you.
[3:05:23.160 --> 3:05:27.600]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:05:27.600 --> 3:05:31.200]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the
[3:05:31.200 --> 3:05:33.400]  cost of last year's grocery prices.

[3:05:57.240 --> 3:06:02.000]  The first step is getting storable food.
[3:06:02.000 --> 3:06:07.400]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:06:07.400 --> 3:06:14.040]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:06:14.040 --> 3:06:15.400]  just as well funded.
[3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:20.560]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:06:20.560 --> 3:06:22.040]  of the American people.
[3:06:22.040 --> 3:06:26.480]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:06:26.480 --> 3:06:31.560]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:06:31.560 --> 3:06:38.080]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:06:38.080 --> 3:06:39.760]  It's not about left or right.
[3:06:39.760 --> 3:06:41.640]  It's about a one-world government.
[3:06:41.640 --> 3:06:48.520]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:06:48.520 --> 3:06:54.000]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:06:56.720]  high quality at prismplanet.tv.
[3:06:56.720 --> 3:07:01.520]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:07:01.520 --> 3:07:04.880]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[3:07:04.880 --> 3:07:06.960]  Now going green can save money.
[3:07:06.960 --> 3:07:11.000]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:12.480]  the renaissance charger.
[3:07:12.480 --> 3:07:16.720]  The renaissance charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively
[3:07:16.720 --> 3:07:20.520]  extends a life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[3:07:20.520 --> 3:07:26.240]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates
[3:07:26.240 --> 3:07:31.400]  the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[3:07:31.400 --> 3:07:33.680]  and maintaining cell integrity.

[3:08:06.280 --> 3:08:11.080]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:08:11.080 --> 3:08:12.080]  You want answers?
[3:08:12.080 --> 3:08:14.280]  Well, so does he.
[3:08:14.280 --> 3:08:24.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:08:24.240 --> 3:08:38.040]  We've got Senator Nancy Schaffer coming up in a moment.
[3:08:38.040 --> 3:08:41.040]  I meant to get to this story.
[3:08:41.040 --> 3:08:45.200]  Scientists arrested for smuggling vials used in Ebola research in the U.S., then I saw
[3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:50.920]  the New York Times article, or link to, up on infoawards.com, I already knew it, but the
[3:08:50.920 --> 3:08:57.280]  photos of Homeland Security training, training the Cub Scouts in paramilitary uniforms with
[3:08:57.280 --> 3:09:03.320]  submachine guns to hunt down U.S. veterans, and of course they put the veteran in a bad
[3:09:03.320 --> 3:09:07.440]  life, but the villain's always a veteran, you've got to kill him, it just blew me away,
[3:09:07.440 --> 3:09:10.080]  and I went into a tirade for 20 minutes, so we're behind.
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:15.280]  But Tony, a veteran that the Boy Scouts are training to hunt down, is in New York, you're
[3:09:15.280 --> 3:09:20.500]  talking about coming back to your country and not being able to recognize it.
[3:09:20.500 --> 3:09:24.040]  The reason the United States is raided by major university studies is the number six
[3:09:24.040 --> 3:09:28.160]  police state on the planet, number one being North Korea, and England's number five.
[3:09:28.160 --> 3:09:32.480]  I want to be sure about that, I had that article yesterday and never got to it.
[3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:37.160]  I read it, but if that guys, it's in the stack, on the stack, show people the stack here,
[3:09:37.160 --> 3:09:42.280]  this is three days, this is how much news comes in here, how much gets dumped on my desk,
[3:09:42.280 --> 3:09:45.760]  how much I bring in, this at the end of the week will be cleaned off, we've got to get
[3:09:45.760 --> 3:09:48.640]  a filing system for this, but then we've got to have like two people, three people just
[3:09:48.640 --> 3:09:52.160]  to go through all this when I need something.
[3:09:52.160 --> 3:09:56.720]  I mean, this is insane, today's stuff is all right here.
[3:09:56.720 --> 3:10:02.960]  Anyways, the point is that once they say we can secretly arrest you and secretly hold
[3:10:02.960 --> 3:10:08.920]  you and torture you, even if it's not implemented fully, the next step is total tyranny.
[3:10:08.920 --> 3:10:13.680]  So that's why we've now become one of the number one police states in the world.
[3:10:13.680 --> 3:10:16.600]  And now they're announcing, oh, guess what, Homeland Security wasn't for the foreign
[3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:20.120]  Muslims or Arabs and taking their rights is wrong.
[3:10:20.120 --> 3:10:22.320]  But the point is they knew it would be popular.
[3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:24.160]  It was all really for you.
[3:10:24.160 --> 3:10:27.520]  See what you thought was for somebody else is for you.
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:29.000]  It's for me.
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:33.920]  So finishing up, Tony, you went to Iraq twice and when you talk to other vets, are they
[3:10:33.920 --> 3:10:34.920]  waking up?
[3:10:34.920 --> 3:10:36.600]  Because the vets I talked to are all waking up.
[3:10:36.600 --> 3:10:40.480]  Yeah, quite a few of my friends are definitely waking up.
[3:10:40.480 --> 3:10:46.000]  What definitely woke up a few of my close of vets friends is that I'm a war officer.
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:47.000]  I was a war officer.
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:48.760]  I flew an Apache.
[3:10:48.760 --> 3:10:55.080]  I had missiles that could kill thousands of people in my control.
[3:10:55.080 --> 3:10:59.440]  I come back here to try to get a handgun from it and I was denied.
[3:10:59.440 --> 3:11:06.200]  Two, three other guys that I speak to online that I try to keep in touch with, they still
[3:11:06.200 --> 3:11:10.000]  are trying to apply for a handgun for it and they can't even get them.
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:14.160]  So when you go on about, they're not letting us military officers get guns.
[3:11:14.160 --> 3:11:15.160]  They're not.
[3:11:15.160 --> 3:11:21.520]  I mean, I just don't understand how they can let us turn around and have access to missiles.
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:26.040]  But then when we go to play for a handgun for our own protection in our own home, we
[3:11:26.040 --> 3:11:27.040]  get denied.
[3:11:27.040 --> 3:11:28.040]  No, I know.
[3:11:28.040 --> 3:11:29.040]  God bless you, sir.
[3:11:29.040 --> 3:11:30.880]  And I appreciate your call.
[3:11:30.880 --> 3:11:32.840]  Most people accuse me of exaggerating.
[3:11:32.840 --> 3:11:37.080]  It is the opposite in almost every case.
[3:11:37.080 --> 3:11:42.120]  I have studied the thousands of pieces of data coming in and I can officially tell you and
[3:11:42.120 --> 3:11:46.920]  we even have mainstream news admitting large portions of it that they are phasing in not
[3:11:46.920 --> 3:11:49.720]  allowing veterans to own firearms.
[3:11:49.720 --> 3:11:52.880]  Now you've seen the DHS report saying you're the main target in the enemy.
[3:11:52.880 --> 3:11:58.040]  You got the Boy Scouts training with machine guns to come kill you right out of Nazi Germany,
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:11:59.040]  right out of Soviet Russia.
[3:11:59.040 --> 3:12:00.320]  I mean, right out.
[3:12:00.320 --> 3:12:08.600]  I mean, they're going down every type of tyranny there is and doing it and it was all set up
[3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:09.600]  decades ago.
[3:12:09.600 --> 3:12:13.040]  It doesn't matter if it's George Bush, Barack Obama, the agenda is the same, but it's all
[3:12:13.040 --> 3:12:14.640]  coming to a head under Obama.
[3:12:14.640 --> 3:12:18.880]  He's their closer, as George Humphrey has said eloquently here on air.
[3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:21.440]  I mean, absolutely, he is the closer.
[3:12:21.440 --> 3:12:27.960]  He is the guy that's doing all of this.
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:38.560]  So it just absolutely boggles my mind and makes my makes my head spin that this is going
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:42.080]  on and there is no doubt.
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:45.320]  Remember Clinton tried it in 2000 right before he left office.
[3:12:45.320 --> 3:12:49.520]  It was the article about 86,000 vets put on a list not be able to own guns and they wouldn't
[3:12:49.520 --> 3:12:50.520]  say why.
[3:12:50.520 --> 3:12:54.920]  And now the head of the White House chief of staff says we're going to put you on a
[3:12:54.920 --> 3:12:57.560]  no gun list like a no fly list.
[3:12:57.560 --> 3:13:01.160]  And then now they've introduced the bill saying we'll secretly say you can't own guns and
[3:13:01.160 --> 3:13:03.600]  the attorney general can ban any guns he wants.
[3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:05.140]  Just give him the power.
[3:13:05.140 --> 3:13:07.400]  It's happening.
[3:13:07.400 --> 3:13:11.780]  Each reporter's for one of the biggest newspapers in the world, London Guardian goes to Greece
[3:13:11.780 --> 3:13:16.280]  and tries to photograph a huge hotel with our leaders illegally meeting in it to set
[3:13:16.280 --> 3:13:20.920]  policy Logan act and they come and arrest him twice.
[3:13:20.920 --> 3:13:24.320]  They don't care if he's with one of the top 10 papers in the world.
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:26.320]  None of that matters now.
[3:13:26.320 --> 3:13:31.040]  All right, I'm going to shut up and go to our guest and I saw a YouTube video of her
[3:13:31.040 --> 3:13:34.680]  giving a speech and in five minutes she boiled everything down.
[3:13:34.680 --> 3:13:41.520]  I try to explain about the CPS and the bounties on taking kids and how there's no due process.
[3:13:41.520 --> 3:13:45.520]  She's state senator 50 of the district.
[3:13:45.520 --> 3:13:49.920]  Senator Schaffer serves a constituency in eight counties that make up 50 of the district
[3:13:49.920 --> 3:13:50.920]  in Georgia.
[3:13:50.920 --> 3:13:56.000]  She's got a long, you know, illustrious career out there fighting corruption.
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:14:01.520]  She's also the head in her state of the Eagle Forum.
[3:14:01.520 --> 3:14:06.240]  And so she now joins us and we appreciate her standing up eloquently and fighting this.
[3:14:06.240 --> 3:14:08.280]  And so we appreciate that Senator Schaffer coming on.
[3:14:08.280 --> 3:14:10.240]  Nancy, it's good to have you here with us.
[3:14:10.240 --> 3:14:11.240]  Thank you.
[3:14:11.240 --> 3:14:12.240]  It's good to be on with you.
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:14.760]  I appreciate all you're doing.
[3:14:14.760 --> 3:14:20.160]  Thanks for holding while I was ranting for five minutes about the DHS document saying
[3:14:20.160 --> 3:14:23.120]  veterans the number one threat to homeland security.
[3:14:23.120 --> 3:14:26.400]  Were you aware they're training the Boy Scouts for gun confiscation?
[3:14:26.400 --> 3:14:29.200]  Well, you know, I've heard that they are training boys.
[3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:31.560]  I didn't know this Boy Scouts.
[3:14:31.560 --> 3:14:35.440]  Yeah, it's Boy Scouts, school groups, public school groups.
[3:14:35.440 --> 3:14:36.760]  This is just one.
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:40.680]  What do you think of all the new documents coming out demonizing veterans on a separate
[3:14:40.680 --> 3:14:41.680]  issue?
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:42.680]  Oh, it's awful.
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:43.680]  It's just awful.
[3:14:43.680 --> 3:14:46.920]  It's unconstitutional and it's wrong.
[3:14:46.920 --> 3:14:50.240]  And you just can see the direction that we're headed.
[3:14:50.240 --> 3:14:51.800]  I gotta be honest with you, Senator.
[3:14:51.800 --> 3:14:54.840]  I mean, I knew the globalists were evil, but it's even hard for me to believe they're
[3:14:54.840 --> 3:14:55.840]  this bold.
[3:14:55.840 --> 3:14:56.840]  Yeah, it is.
[3:14:56.840 --> 3:15:00.160]  I mean, training 14 year olds to go after the military.
[3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:03.280]  I mean, that's right out of East Germany.
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:04.280]  That's right.
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:05.280]  This is that.
[3:15:05.280 --> 3:15:08.800]  This is that community service that we're hearing all about.
[3:15:08.800 --> 3:15:09.800]  Absolutely.
[3:15:09.800 --> 3:15:13.080]  It certainly has a different definition, doesn't it?
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:14.080]  Yes, it does.
[3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:18.040]  Ma'am, I'm going to try to just sit back and shut up because I'd like you to break down
[3:15:18.040 --> 3:15:21.040]  and a little bit more time.
[3:15:21.040 --> 3:15:24.000]  What you gave in that speech, I know you've given a lot, but I saw this particular speech
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:30.640]  of you, I believe before the Eagle Forum, really laying out the facts of just how unconstitutional
[3:15:30.640 --> 3:15:34.200]  and Kafka-esque the CPS is.
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:35.200]  Right.
[3:15:35.200 --> 3:15:41.000]  Well, it is unconstitutional and I'm sure you have many listeners that know that children
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:46.760]  are being taken away from their parents in a ruthless kind of behavior by case workers
[3:15:46.760 --> 3:15:49.840]  and social workers and investigators.
[3:15:49.840 --> 3:15:55.640]  And the bureaucracy is very huge that also includes lawyers and judges and therapists
[3:15:55.640 --> 3:16:01.760]  and others who take these children from their parents without a cause.
[3:16:01.760 --> 3:16:08.360]  And of course, we know that money is being made because of this and I'm convinced, without
[3:16:08.360 --> 3:16:13.360]  a shadow of a doubt, that our parents across this country need to be warned of the dangers
[3:16:13.360 --> 3:16:20.080]  of the child protective services nationwide.
[3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:22.280]  You want me to just continue on, don't you?
[3:16:22.280 --> 3:16:23.280]  Sure, Senator.
[3:16:23.280 --> 3:16:24.280]  Lay it out.
[3:16:24.280 --> 3:16:29.720]  The Department of Child Protective Services has become a protected empire that we see
[3:16:29.720 --> 3:16:34.080]  going on around us and it's built on taking children and separating families.
[3:16:34.080 --> 3:16:40.520]  As a matter of fact, I could throw in here now that it appears to me that the family
[3:16:40.520 --> 3:16:45.680]  is going to have to be destroyed in order for the one world government to completely
[3:16:45.680 --> 3:16:46.680]  develop.
[3:16:46.680 --> 3:16:59.560]  But this is the taking of children by protected empire and this is not to say today that there
[3:16:59.560 --> 3:17:05.960]  are not those children who are really being abused, who need to be removed from the wretched
[3:17:05.960 --> 3:17:08.360]  situations that they may be in.
[3:17:08.360 --> 3:17:11.240]  But it needs to be done through due process.
[3:17:11.240 --> 3:17:13.840]  Yes, that's not what we're talking about.
[3:17:13.840 --> 3:17:19.080]  We're talking about the families that are having children removed from them with no
[3:17:19.080 --> 3:17:25.440]  cause and then there is no due process available to them after this has happened.
[3:17:25.440 --> 3:17:35.080]  And in one county in my district, I had 37 families brought together one Saturday morning
[3:17:35.080 --> 3:17:42.080]  in the library to allow them to without any press and without any child protective services
[3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:45.280]  pressure there to tell their stories.
[3:17:45.280 --> 3:17:52.240]  And it was absolutely unbelievable to hear these parents, single dads, single mothers
[3:17:52.240 --> 3:17:57.400]  telling their, and other parents telling their stories of how their children had been picked
[3:17:57.400 --> 3:18:05.000]  up in the middle of the night, off of the school buses, out of schools, out of hospitals
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:12.040]  even while they are nursing and these families had never seen those children again.
[3:18:12.040 --> 3:18:17.160]  You have never seen such agony, such suffering and such crying.
[3:18:17.160 --> 3:18:23.280]  And we had 50 families standing outside the door that were not allowed to come in because
[3:18:23.280 --> 3:18:26.920]  we already had 37 families inside.
[3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:34.520]  It was truly just seeing the work of the Gestapo coming against these families and
[3:18:34.520 --> 3:18:38.160]  taking their children from them, never to be seen again.
[3:18:38.160 --> 3:18:45.840]  It was very, very enlightening that day was when we saw what was happening in this one
[3:18:45.840 --> 3:18:52.120]  child protective services department in one county in my district in Georgia.
[3:18:52.120 --> 3:18:57.000]  And not only that, but they had a separate business going on where they required all
[3:18:57.000 --> 3:19:04.000]  of these parents to come in multiple times and have drug tests and they charge the parents
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:05.000]  every time.
[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:10.080]  So they had a separate business going on, they had already made over $100,000 in this
[3:19:10.080 --> 3:19:11.080]  business.
[3:19:11.080 --> 3:19:15.040]  Well, Senator, stay there, let's come back and break down the abuses of the Bill of
[3:19:15.040 --> 3:19:16.040]  Rights Constitution.
[3:19:16.040 --> 3:19:20.280]  For those that don't know, they set up, at the turn of the last century, these family
[3:19:20.280 --> 3:19:23.760]  courts that don't follow the Bill of Rights Constitution, they were actually set up to
[3:19:23.760 --> 3:19:28.200]  carry out racial hygiene or they were first called eugenics courts.
[3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:32.000]  And that's why they're separate and new and outside of the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:33.720]  That's all completely illegal.
[3:19:33.720 --> 3:19:38.960]  And it's come out in the news all these family court judges are getting illegal kickbacks
[3:19:38.960 --> 3:19:44.200]  from the private CPS facilities because they're getting federal funds and they pay the judges
[3:19:44.200 --> 3:19:47.760]  in some cases millions of dollars a piece.
[3:19:47.760 --> 3:19:50.840]  So that's all this is, is a bounty on your children.
[3:19:50.840 --> 3:19:55.480]  We tend to focus on the CPS workers, the real evils, the judges.
[3:19:55.480 --> 3:19:57.880]  They're the ones making the big money and the private grids.
[3:19:57.880 --> 3:20:01.520]  Stay with us, Senator.
[3:20:01.520 --> 3:20:06.680]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining
[3:20:06.680 --> 3:20:08.840]  high energy and vibrant health.
[3:20:08.840 --> 3:20:13.720]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[3:20:13.720 --> 3:20:19.000]  Alchovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:22.920]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline.
[3:20:22.920 --> 3:20:27.640]  To help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy, simply put 10 drops per
[3:20:27.640 --> 3:20:32.240]  liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[3:20:32.240 --> 3:20:36.680]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[3:20:36.680 --> 3:20:37.960]  of your body.
[3:20:37.960 --> 3:20:43.520]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[3:20:43.520 --> 3:20:49.600]  Order your bottle of alchovision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alchovision.com.
[3:20:49.600 --> 3:21:02.000]  Or by calling 269-216-9767-269-216-9767 today.
[3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:08.120]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:21:08.120 --> 3:21:12.600]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:21:12.600 --> 3:21:13.920]  us would like to see.
[3:21:13.920 --> 3:21:19.080]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:21:19.080 --> 3:21:20.080]  of the American people.
[3:21:20.080 --> 3:21:24.840]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one of this election.
[3:21:24.840 --> 3:21:29.920]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:21:29.920 --> 3:21:38.080]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:41.640]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:21:41.640 --> 3:21:48.560]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:56.760]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[3:21:56.760 --> 3:22:01.720]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:22:01.720 --> 3:22:04.880]  Are you tired of losing your hard earned savings in retirement?
[3:22:04.880 --> 3:22:08.620]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought
[3:22:08.620 --> 3:22:11.920]  on by trillions of dollars and government bailouts bother you?
[3:22:11.920 --> 3:22:15.520]  Then please let me dwayne dally with mightest resources to help you to protect what you
[3:22:15.520 --> 3:22:16.760]  have left.

[3:22:23.200 --> 3:22:26.760]  and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[3:22:26.760 --> 3:22:31.640]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years compared to our present fiat
[3:22:31.640 --> 3:22:36.800]  currency which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[3:22:36.800 --> 3:22:44.520]  Call me dwayne dally at 800-686-2237 extension 115 to start your protection of wealth today.
[3:22:44.520 --> 3:22:48.040]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[3:22:48.040 --> 3:22:50.920]  No amount is too small so start today.

[3:22:57.680 --> 3:23:01.200]  and silver protection portfolio.
[3:23:01.200 --> 3:23:04.600]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[3:23:04.600 --> 3:23:09.280]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[3:23:09.280 --> 3:23:12.800]  It's called proto-grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems
[3:23:12.800 --> 3:23:17.480]  to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[3:23:17.480 --> 3:23:21.000]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[3:23:21.000 --> 3:23:24.660]  Proto-grow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically
[3:23:24.660 --> 3:23:28.560]  increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[3:23:28.560 --> 3:23:31.800]  Proto-grow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock
[3:23:31.800 --> 3:23:34.360]  the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[3:23:34.360 --> 3:23:37.400]  Proto-grow's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary
[3:23:37.400 --> 3:23:41.520]  taste enough to 10 times the nutritional value and if you want to double or triple the potency
[3:23:41.520 --> 3:23:43.440]  of herbs or wheatgrass you can.
[3:23:43.440 --> 3:23:46.960]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids it's now easy.
[3:23:46.960 --> 3:23:50.600]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the proto-grow website
[3:23:50.600 --> 3:24:00.320]  at GrowLikeCrazy.com that's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365.
[3:24:00.320 --> 3:24:23.080]  Alright Nancy Schaefer, state head of the Eagle Forum, state senator of 50th district.
[3:24:23.080 --> 3:24:28.000]  Well this is an apropos song to have coming on right now, you can throw your rock, hide
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:38.600]  your hand, work against the people, it's amazing what the establishment are doing as they work
[3:24:38.600 --> 3:24:42.920]  against their fellow man, always advertising and what's for the children, it's a giant
[3:24:42.920 --> 3:24:49.480]  industry and really people with some nasty folks, there's some that just want the money
[3:24:49.480 --> 3:24:53.920]  of kidnapping the kids but the others like to do horrible things with the children that's
[3:24:53.920 --> 3:24:56.000]  been proven and all over the news.
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:25:03.320]  So when did you begin to discover these horrors and what has your fight been like, I mean
[3:25:03.320 --> 3:25:07.800]  because I know discovering this back 12, 14 years ago and fighting it myself and getting
[3:25:07.800 --> 3:25:12.200]  calls at hospitals when the newborn baby's literally jerked off the mother's breast with
[3:25:12.200 --> 3:25:18.160]  no judge's order even, I mean it shook me to the core, it's made me actually cry when
[3:25:18.160 --> 3:25:22.440]  you're around the families and see the pain because it's worse than a death.
[3:25:22.440 --> 3:25:27.560]  When grandma dies, she's old, you love her but you expect it to happen and it's sad.
[3:25:27.560 --> 3:25:34.320]  But when you see families with the joy turned into a nightmare with their young being snatched,
[3:25:34.320 --> 3:25:41.040]  it hits you at a core level and frankly it tears your guts out and then I'm going to
[3:25:41.040 --> 3:25:43.000]  be honest, then you want to kill people.
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:48.160]  Senator, I mean tell us about your journey and then more of the horrors.
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:55.200]  Well it has been horrible, it really has and let me just say up front here now that my
[3:25:55.200 --> 3:26:01.400]  writing the corrupt business of child protective services which you probably have read at some
[3:26:01.400 --> 3:26:06.680]  point or another that prompted me of course to give the speech at Eagle Forum for the
[3:26:06.680 --> 3:26:15.960]  conference last year, at the end of the year, I lost my senate seat over this.
[3:26:15.960 --> 3:26:22.800]  And in working, and let me say that there are causes worth losing over so it hasn't
[3:26:22.800 --> 3:26:28.240]  distressed me that much, it's just given me more time to work on this issue and other
[3:26:28.240 --> 3:26:36.000]  issues but in calling around the country to other state representatives and senators asking
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:41.600]  them would they help this family or that family that have been contacting me, they have told
[3:26:41.600 --> 3:26:47.560]  me that if they help, if they do anything, they will lose their job.
[3:26:47.560 --> 3:26:48.560]  Isn't that interesting?
[3:26:48.560 --> 3:26:49.560]  Oh it's a mafia.
[3:26:49.560 --> 3:26:55.320]  And of course it cost me my senate seat but that's okay, that's okay, we're moving forward,
[3:26:55.320 --> 3:27:00.960]  we're exposing what is being done and you mentioned a few minutes ago about the judges
[3:27:00.960 --> 3:27:07.000]  and the money, I wanted to share with you that the Census Bureau has reported that in
[3:27:07.000 --> 3:27:14.640]  2002, 40 billion in transfer payments were made between households, that money is under
[3:27:14.640 --> 3:27:21.560]  the direction and the control of family court judges.
[3:27:21.560 --> 3:27:26.000]  And that's on the tip of the iceberg, of course you'd break this down so well but there's
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:28.000]  bounties on children's heads.
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:33.840]  Yes there are, as a matter of fact we just learned a few days ago that an order had even
[3:27:33.840 --> 3:27:39.120]  been placed to one of our child protective services departments for a particular kind
[3:27:39.120 --> 3:27:41.040]  of child that they wanted.
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:46.120]  So there is a bounty on these children, as a matter of fact that when you break it down
[3:27:46.120 --> 3:27:52.840]  as to exactly what is happening to promote these financial incentives, you have to go
[3:27:52.840 --> 3:27:59.920]  back to the adoption and the safe families act that was set in motion in 1974 by Walter
[3:27:59.920 --> 3:28:07.840]  Mondale and then later was expanded upon by President Bill Clinton in 1997.
[3:28:07.840 --> 3:28:14.160]  And what this act did is it offered cash bonuses to the states for every child they
[3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:16.640]  adopted out of foster care.
[3:28:16.640 --> 3:28:22.840]  So in order to receive the adoption incentive bonuses, local child protective services need
[3:28:22.840 --> 3:28:24.400]  more children.
[3:28:24.400 --> 3:28:30.880]  They must have merchandise which is the children that sells and you must have plenty so that
[3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:33.040]  the buyer can choose.
[3:28:33.040 --> 3:28:39.840]  Some counties are known to get 4,000 to 6,000 bonus for each child adopted out to strangers
[3:28:39.840 --> 3:28:44.200]  and an additional 2,000 for special needs children.
[3:28:44.200 --> 3:28:48.080]  And of course this money just continues to follow the child and follow the child for
[3:28:48.080 --> 3:28:50.480]  years and years and years.
[3:28:50.480 --> 3:28:54.480]  And the employees work to keep those federal dollars flowing.
[3:28:54.480 --> 3:29:00.000]  And that's why 67% of children nationally, and that must be the average in Texas as well,
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:06.080]  we have sent the state hearings on this, are on multiple psychotropic drugs because once
[3:29:06.080 --> 3:29:10.960]  they give them a designation, then the cash amount goes way up.
[3:29:10.960 --> 3:29:11.960]  That's right.
[3:29:11.960 --> 3:29:13.200]  You're exactly right.
[3:29:13.200 --> 3:29:14.880]  You're exactly right.
[3:29:14.880 --> 3:29:16.880]  There's a baseline number.
[3:29:16.880 --> 3:29:24.720]  There's a baseline number of expected adoptions based on population for each state.
[3:29:24.720 --> 3:29:31.600]  For every child at DHR or child protective services or whatever it's called in your particular
[3:29:31.600 --> 3:29:35.760]  state can get adopted, there's this bonus of 4,000 to 6,000.
[3:29:35.760 --> 3:29:37.800]  All right, Senator Shaver, stay there.
[3:29:37.800 --> 3:29:40.560]  I'm sorry, we've got to break, that was a short segment.
[3:29:40.560 --> 3:29:41.960]  Long segment coming up.
[3:29:41.960 --> 3:29:45.760]  I want to get into what you just talked about, the ordering certain children.
[3:29:45.760 --> 3:29:49.880]  We know the blonde-haired blue-eyed gets the top cash, and that's been confirmed.
[3:29:49.880 --> 3:29:51.840]  So they're trafficking in your children.
[3:29:51.840 --> 3:30:01.360]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.360 --> 3:30:05.160]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly
[3:30:05.160 --> 3:30:06.840]  bacteria and viruses?

[3:30:19.720 --> 3:30:22.320]  germs, bacteria and yeast safely.
[3:30:22.320 --> 3:30:29.280]  This new silver solution liquid form was shown to be a powerful preventative for H5N1 influenza.
[3:30:29.280 --> 3:30:33.600]  This new technology has proven itself to be a formidable weapon against bio threats of

[3:31:02.080 --> 3:31:07.400]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:31:07.400 --> 3:31:14.160]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:31:14.160 --> 3:31:15.480]  just as well funded.
[3:31:15.480 --> 3:31:20.640]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:31:20.640 --> 3:31:22.120]  of the American people.
[3:31:22.120 --> 3:31:26.520]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:31:26.520 --> 3:31:31.640]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:31:31.640 --> 3:31:38.160]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:31:38.160 --> 3:31:39.840]  It's not about left or right.
[3:31:39.840 --> 3:31:41.720]  It's about a one-world government.
[3:31:41.720 --> 3:31:48.640]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:32:01.800 --> 3:32:05.560]  Hi, my name is MZ, owner of KSCO in Santa Cruz, California.
[3:32:05.560 --> 3:32:10.080]  And like Alex Jones, I'm passionate about talk radio, that great bastion of freedom
[3:32:10.080 --> 3:32:11.440]  of expression for us all.
[3:32:11.440 --> 3:32:15.080]  I'm also passionate about helping people know the joys, benefits, and surprisingly
[3:32:15.080 --> 3:32:19.840]  simple methods of becoming entrepreneurs who work for themselves and not as wage slaves
[3:32:19.840 --> 3:32:24.520]  for someone else, or even worse, for large companies with no heart and soul, nor loyalty
[3:32:24.520 --> 3:32:25.520]  to their employees.
[3:32:25.520 --> 3:32:29.760]  If you're tired of being dependent on others for living and ready to start owning yourself,
[3:32:29.760 --> 3:32:33.440]  loving your work, and setting the sky as the limit for your earning potential, I want you
[3:32:33.440 --> 3:32:38.400]  to know about an exciting great business opportunity involving the marketing of helpful dark chocolate
[3:32:38.400 --> 3:32:41.880]  that actually helps people lose weight and can help them make money, perhaps lots of
[3:32:41.880 --> 3:32:44.920]  it just by helping us spread the word about this wonderful, unique product.
[3:32:44.920 --> 3:32:47.800]  Get on the web and go to chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:32:47.800 --> 3:32:50.840]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out our opportunity.
[3:32:50.840 --> 3:32:52.520]  You'll know pretty quick if you're interested.
[3:32:52.520 --> 3:32:54.880]  If you are, we will connect with you and get you up and running.
[3:32:54.880 --> 3:32:58.600]  We don't want any money from you and you'll be amazed at how simple this system is.
[3:32:58.600 --> 3:33:18.400]  Here on Austin, it's so corrupt, it's not just little kids they're grabbing.
[3:33:18.400 --> 3:33:23.560]  If you're late to class three times in Travis County, they charge you with truancy.
[3:33:23.560 --> 3:33:28.520]  Now the state statute says it's way above 10 unexcused absences in one semester.
[3:33:28.520 --> 3:33:32.640]  Last time I checked the law, it changes sometimes, but to the point is it's a whole bunch of
[3:33:32.640 --> 3:33:37.080]  absences, but they have portable buildings built on and they send these family court
[3:33:37.080 --> 3:33:41.040]  judges out and they call the parents in the morning and they put this on CBS News.
[3:33:41.040 --> 3:33:43.040]  I mean, I knew it was happening, but it was on the news.
[3:33:43.040 --> 3:33:47.120]  They commit this crime right out in the open like it's good.
[3:33:47.120 --> 3:33:51.960]  And they say, you were late to class and you're going to sign this agreement or I'm going
[3:33:51.960 --> 3:33:54.880]  to put you in juvenile hall for six months.
[3:33:54.880 --> 3:33:59.880]  Now the judge, she goes for contempt, it was judge me, Jean Mir, who has huge facilities
[3:33:59.880 --> 3:34:00.880]  named after her.
[3:34:00.880 --> 3:34:05.200]  Talk about which like, and she was on there going, do you understand, you know, with this
[3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:07.200]  face on TV, I got to find that clip somewhere.
[3:34:07.200 --> 3:34:08.760]  She's like, you understand me.
[3:34:08.760 --> 3:34:09.960]  The dad's like, do what he says.
[3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:10.960]  The kid's crying.
[3:34:10.960 --> 3:34:11.960]  I'm sorry.
[3:34:11.960 --> 3:34:12.960]  I was late to class.
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:13.960]  I'm sorry.
[3:34:13.960 --> 3:34:14.960]  Then you sign.
[3:34:14.960 --> 3:34:15.960]  Now they've got you contractually.
[3:34:15.960 --> 3:34:17.960]  That was the trick.
[3:34:17.960 --> 3:34:20.520]  She couldn't have put you in jail.
[3:34:20.520 --> 3:34:24.360]  Now they've got you contractually a fertile adjudication.
[3:34:24.360 --> 3:34:26.360]  Now you're in the system.
[3:34:26.360 --> 3:34:29.720]  Now they got you and it's come out judges all over the country, getting over a million
[3:34:29.720 --> 3:34:36.280]  bucks a piece in many cases to put girls who were late to class in jail in Ohio or in Illinois.
[3:34:36.280 --> 3:34:40.800]  A girl wrote something bad about her, her principal, making fun of him and they arrested
[3:34:40.800 --> 3:34:43.960]  her and gave her six months in a labor camp.
[3:34:43.960 --> 3:34:44.960]  Remember that?
[3:34:44.960 --> 3:34:47.480]  We could pull it up right now if you don't believe us and it turned out the judge was
[3:34:47.480 --> 3:34:53.400]  getting over a million bucks a year to fill the private prisons and they were doing kickbacks.
[3:34:53.400 --> 3:34:54.400]  Oh man.
[3:34:54.400 --> 3:34:55.400]  Keep them coming.
[3:34:55.400 --> 3:34:56.400]  Oh God.
[3:34:56.400 --> 3:34:57.400]  The federal money is incredible.
[3:34:57.400 --> 3:34:58.400]  Keep them coming.
[3:34:58.400 --> 3:34:59.400]  We need more.
[3:34:59.400 --> 3:35:00.400]  I mean, this is like Shawshank Redemption.
[3:35:00.400 --> 3:35:06.080]  So take my film in game and then we're going to the senator.
[3:35:06.080 --> 3:35:12.320]  In there we have a clip from the state Senate and the representative asters, there's Anna
[3:35:12.320 --> 3:35:18.720]  Hupp ask her, she says, why do you put 60 plus percent of the children on Prozac type
[3:35:18.720 --> 3:35:25.160]  drugs and the head state board psychiatrist says, well, they have bad genes.
[3:35:25.160 --> 3:35:26.720]  There's no tests for bad genes.
[3:35:26.720 --> 3:35:27.720]  They do.
[3:35:27.720 --> 3:35:28.720]  They just make it up.
[3:35:28.720 --> 3:35:34.440]  Anyways, I got a ma'am, please continue with the bounties because we've confirmed these
[3:35:34.440 --> 3:35:39.160]  but you separately brought them up for folks that don't know the adoption agencies put
[3:35:39.160 --> 3:35:42.760]  out little bounties and this is all even done on the up and up but there's also a little
[3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:43.880]  under the table.
[3:35:43.880 --> 3:35:46.960]  Tell us about the bounties on people's children.
[3:35:46.960 --> 3:35:53.440]  Certainly these children come with bounties because we know that the, we know the incentives
[3:35:53.440 --> 3:35:54.720]  are available there.
[3:35:54.720 --> 3:36:00.760]  The federal incentives are available and they can be 4,000 or 6,000 but actually there
[3:36:00.760 --> 3:36:07.760]  is a beginning formula in which each bonus is multiplied and that this sounds complicated.
[3:36:07.760 --> 3:36:11.080]  It really isn't but this is what the states go by.
[3:36:11.080 --> 3:36:16.960]  Each bonus is multiplied by the percentage that the state has managed to exceed its baseline
[3:36:16.960 --> 3:36:19.080]  adoption number.
[3:36:19.080 --> 3:36:24.040]  Therefore the states and local communities work hard to reach their goals for increased
[3:36:24.040 --> 3:36:28.240]  numbers of adoptions for children in foster care.
[3:36:28.240 --> 3:36:35.080]  So therefore you get to the end of the year and a child protective services department
[3:36:35.080 --> 3:36:40.440]  in some state or in a county there in the state may not have taken as many children
[3:36:40.440 --> 3:36:49.680]  as they need to and they have a, their formula or their bonus increases on the wall and it
[3:36:49.680 --> 3:36:53.560]  tells exactly how many more children they need by the end of the year.
[3:36:53.560 --> 3:36:56.120]  So it's just like a sales shop at a car dealership.
[3:36:56.120 --> 3:36:59.600]  They got the sales manager, you're not going to reach your goal Bob.
[3:36:59.600 --> 3:37:00.600]  That's exactly right.
[3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:02.120]  That's exactly right.
[3:37:02.120 --> 3:37:09.360]  And in the cases I saw in this one case there was this auto mechanic and his young wife
[3:37:09.360 --> 3:37:11.800]  and she had tested positive three years before.
[3:37:11.800 --> 3:37:14.080]  They don't tell you when at the hospital they're testing your blood and they go she's
[3:37:14.080 --> 3:37:15.600]  got marijuana in her.
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:19.320]  No judge, no jury, no second test, no, no process.
[3:37:19.320 --> 3:37:22.080]  They come and take the blonde hair, blue-eyed baby.
[3:37:22.080 --> 3:37:25.960]  Well this is three years later and so they contacted my show and they said we're pregnant,
[3:37:25.960 --> 3:37:30.160]  we're going back in the hospital, we just want to make sure they don't try to take them.
[3:37:30.160 --> 3:37:31.160]  They call.
[3:37:31.160 --> 3:37:35.280]  So I leave the radio that day, I drive down there, I go in with the camera, the cop say
[3:37:35.280 --> 3:37:37.200]  turn your camera off, I say no.
[3:37:37.200 --> 3:37:42.000]  We open the door up and the cop and my handsome was a witness to this, the camera doesn't
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:43.720]  pick it up very well.
[3:37:43.720 --> 3:37:50.440]  My handsome was there, he got there even before me and the cop actually had his hand on her
[3:37:50.440 --> 3:37:51.960]  neck making her sign it.
[3:37:51.960 --> 3:37:53.120]  You can't make this stuff up.
[3:37:53.120 --> 3:37:57.600]  This country is so gone folks because they have special CPS cops just assigned to them
[3:37:57.600 --> 3:38:02.040]  who are particularly devilish and they took the baby off her breast, the newborn baby
[3:38:02.040 --> 3:38:04.120]  disappeared and then we go to the court.
[3:38:04.120 --> 3:38:06.360]  They didn't even fill out the right name.
[3:38:06.360 --> 3:38:11.840]  They said the baby was three years old and that this lady had done all this abuse.
[3:38:11.840 --> 3:38:18.200]  The forms aren't just lies, they're so lazy and so criminal they don't even care.
[3:38:18.200 --> 3:38:22.840]  They just use old forms and have you ever seen that senator?
[3:38:22.840 --> 3:38:28.440]  Well I haven't exactly seen that, I do know that they take children right out of the hospitals
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:34.240]  and sometimes they're one or two days old but the case workers and social workers often
[3:38:34.240 --> 3:38:40.120]  times very often are guilty of fraud and they do withhold the evidence and they fabricate
[3:38:40.120 --> 3:38:48.920]  the evidence and their whole goal is to terminate the parental right of the parents and parents
[3:38:48.920 --> 3:38:55.760]  are just left at the mercy and all of this in the best interest of the child, those words
[3:38:55.760 --> 3:38:59.200]  in the best interest of the child have been redefined.
[3:38:59.200 --> 3:39:01.120]  It's not in the best interest of the child.
[3:39:01.120 --> 3:39:05.000]  The bottom line is taking the children for money.
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:07.520]  And the law was written for those that don't know, I'd like you to speak to this, you're
[3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:09.800]  an expert on it, she can speak to it.
[3:39:09.800 --> 3:39:13.040]  It was written to where we're supposed to keep the family together and give it to grandparents
[3:39:13.040 --> 3:39:15.160]  or the other spouse.
[3:39:15.160 --> 3:39:20.480]  Parents are now, don't like how the parents are operating, they advertise on TV to tattle,
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:26.080]  the grandparents go and tattle and then they don't get the children nine times out of ten.
[3:39:26.080 --> 3:39:32.000]  Yes, there are lots of grandparents that cannot get their grandchildren even when it would
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:39.400]  be best if the grandparents, say the parents are on drugs, someone does need to have access
[3:39:39.400 --> 3:39:43.880]  to those children but often times the grandparents are turned down.
[3:39:43.880 --> 3:39:50.080]  Now there is a policy that you're supposed to secure a relative immediately for those
[3:39:50.080 --> 3:39:55.600]  parents, but often times that relative is never sought out, the grandparents are never
[3:39:55.600 --> 3:40:02.280]  given the children and a stranger then comes in and takes over the lives of those children.
[3:40:02.280 --> 3:40:09.600]  And there is no, absolutely no financial resource or no real drive to unite the family back
[3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:15.480]  together or to keep them together or to provide any effective care for the family.
[3:40:15.480 --> 3:40:17.000]  That is completely gone.
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:20.800]  Now it's just, it's destroying the family.
[3:40:20.800 --> 3:40:26.040]  Well right out of high school I learned about this because for a summer I worked for a large
[3:40:26.040 --> 3:40:32.360]  carpet cleaning place and we would go to these houses because you know we might go
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:37.640]  to six, seven, eight, nine, ten houses a day sometimes and I'd say what is this?
[3:40:37.640 --> 3:40:42.200]  And it'd be an, usually a middle class house, five bedroom, parts of it would be nice, there
[3:40:42.200 --> 3:40:46.880]  would be rooms locked, there'd be kids walking around in shorts with their shirts off, you
[3:40:46.880 --> 3:40:52.000]  know ages three to ten, there'd be marijuana smoke, there'd be some fat, it always looked
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:57.920]  the same, some pervert looking adult and then the, you know, because you'd be in a two man
[3:40:57.920 --> 3:41:01.160]  team and I was with the older guy who knew about it and he goes, oh this is some foster
[3:41:01.160 --> 3:41:06.440]  parent house and I'm not attacking all foster parents folks but I saw what it is, it's lazy
[3:41:06.440 --> 3:41:11.840]  potheds or alcoholics that get four or five kids and that's their business is they warehouse
[3:41:11.840 --> 3:41:15.320]  them and they're always getting caught killing them or locking them up or giving them one
[3:41:15.320 --> 3:41:19.880]  hot dog a day, bread and water because they want all that money for their drug habit and
[3:41:19.880 --> 3:41:24.760]  that's why I've seen statistics of foster parents being five times more likely to abuse
[3:41:24.760 --> 3:41:27.160]  children than any other group.
[3:41:27.160 --> 3:41:32.520]  You're exactly right, the children are much more likely to be abused and foster care than
[3:41:32.520 --> 3:41:35.680]  at home with their own, with their own parents.
[3:41:35.680 --> 3:41:41.120]  The beginning of this journey for me began with a grandmother who was trying to get her
[3:41:41.120 --> 3:41:47.080]  two granddaughters in one of the counties in my district, the child protective services
[3:41:47.080 --> 3:41:53.080]  had removed the two little girls from their mother who was very young and they based it
[3:41:53.080 --> 3:41:58.960]  on the fact that there was an unopened can of beer in the front of her car.
[3:41:58.960 --> 3:42:03.960]  They took these two little girls over to an adjoining county, put them in foster home
[3:42:03.960 --> 3:42:10.000]  over there where they had 18 children, all kinds of little rooms downstairs in the lower
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:17.960]  level of this home and one of the case workers in that county was a pedophile who lived in
[3:42:17.960 --> 3:42:25.800]  that home and regularly sexually molested the children who were in the foster care.
[3:42:25.800 --> 3:42:30.520]  When this came up in court, I went to court with this grandmother and sat in the back
[3:42:30.520 --> 3:42:38.320]  of the courtroom and we had a good attorney that day who pulled the walls down, who cross-examined
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:45.560]  one of the older children in this foster home and she admitted that there was an inappropriate
[3:42:45.560 --> 3:42:51.120]  relationship between the foster mother and the case worker.
[3:42:51.120 --> 3:42:55.880]  And then it got a little worse and then the juvenile court judge got all nervous and said
[3:42:55.880 --> 3:43:00.680]  counsel meet me in my chambers and they went out and stayed five minutes and came back
[3:43:00.680 --> 3:43:06.480]  and our attorney just looked at us and out loud said it's nothing but legal kidnapping.
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:08.840]  That's all it is, legal kidnapping.
[3:43:08.840 --> 3:43:09.960]  But let me tell you what happened.
[3:43:09.960 --> 3:43:11.520]  Did they get the child back?
[3:43:11.520 --> 3:43:17.920]  We pressed, it's called DFACS in Georgia and we pressed and pressed and pressed.
[3:43:17.920 --> 3:43:21.280]  The judge said those children will be removed within a week.
[3:43:21.280 --> 3:43:25.640]  Well a week was gone, 10 days was gone, the children were still there.
[3:43:25.640 --> 3:43:32.400]  We kept leaning on them to get those children out of there and out of the blue, someone
[3:43:32.400 --> 3:43:38.320]  called this grandmother in Florida to tell her that they were bringing the children from
[3:43:38.320 --> 3:43:43.400]  Georgia to the state line which she drove up to pick them up.
[3:43:43.400 --> 3:43:45.720]  She of course said she would be there.
[3:43:45.720 --> 3:43:51.400]  She got the children, they didn't have any clothes, one was not wearing shoes, she took
[3:43:51.400 --> 3:43:58.800]  them home and within three days that juvenile court judge drew up a new order and she gave
[3:43:58.800 --> 3:44:05.040]  the two little girls to their father who lived on the west coast, who had never been involved
[3:44:05.040 --> 3:44:08.920]  in their lives and who was involved in adult entertainment.
[3:44:08.920 --> 3:44:16.040]  I pulled his business up on the internet, pornographic, awful.
[3:44:16.040 --> 3:44:19.720]  That's why they gave it to him and in fact you come to the next point, Senator.
[3:44:19.720 --> 3:44:25.120]  Within three days that father was knocking on the door of that grandmother and took those
[3:44:25.120 --> 3:44:30.320]  two little girls screaming and crying to the west coast.
[3:44:30.320 --> 3:44:33.720]  Well it's better than that in that death pit down there in that house with those little
[3:44:33.720 --> 3:44:34.720]  kids now.
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:35.720]  Right.
[3:44:35.720 --> 3:44:38.760]  Now for those that don't know, I found out about this because I walked into these pits
[3:44:38.760 --> 3:44:41.720]  and I probably only saw that summer seven or eight of them but I mean they were all
[3:44:41.720 --> 3:44:48.640]  the same and literally they're hell pits and Senator, you notice everything I've told
[3:44:48.640 --> 3:44:53.320]  you, you've seen the same thing as we've had the same similar experience fighting this
[3:44:53.320 --> 3:44:55.400]  and I just do it a little bit of the time.
[3:44:55.400 --> 3:45:00.000]  Frankly, I'm psychologically shy away from it because it's so, well it just makes me
[3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:01.000]  feel.
[3:45:01.000 --> 3:45:02.000]  It does take its toll on you.
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:06.200]  It makes me feel very aggressive, it makes me want to, but the point is, is that when
[3:45:06.200 --> 3:45:10.000]  it comes right down to it, how many Homeland Security deputy directors of states have been
[3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:14.520]  caught with little kids, how many senators and congressmen with the pages and how many
[3:45:14.520 --> 3:45:20.320]  DHS officials, you know, that want to stop child abuse, it turns out are pedophiles.
[3:45:20.320 --> 3:45:23.200]  When you get down to it, you got a couple groups.
[3:45:23.200 --> 3:45:27.400]  You got parents that were, I mean, you got children who were abused who think that all
[3:45:27.400 --> 3:45:30.800]  parents are abusive and they're going to, they're going to punish the family because
[3:45:30.800 --> 3:45:35.400]  I went to college with some people that were going to be social workers and they, you'd
[3:45:35.400 --> 3:45:39.400]  be out drinking beer and the girl would say, you know, I just can't wait to take kids from
[3:45:39.400 --> 3:45:41.320]  these bad parents because I was abused.
[3:45:41.320 --> 3:45:43.520]  So there's those mentally ill people.
[3:45:43.520 --> 3:45:46.960]  And there's pedophiles who want access to kids and then there's scumbags that just want
[3:45:46.960 --> 3:45:47.960]  money.
[3:45:47.960 --> 3:45:52.560]  And I got to say that's basically what makes up CPS in my experience.
[3:45:52.560 --> 3:45:58.160]  And I think, from what I've seen, I'd probably say 30% of them are pedophiles.
[3:45:58.160 --> 3:46:03.640]  And I mean, and the problem is this crime rate, this crime spree is just, is growing.
[3:46:03.640 --> 3:46:07.440]  So, so, so when you comment on that and where is this going?
[3:46:07.440 --> 3:46:08.440]  How do we stop them?
[3:46:08.440 --> 3:46:13.400]  Well, I would say that there are definitely are pedophiles in the system.
[3:46:13.400 --> 3:46:16.760]  There's, there's no question about that because we know where there's children, there are
[3:46:16.760 --> 3:46:22.600]  pedophiles, you know, they're in schools and they're in churches and they're everywhere
[3:46:22.600 --> 3:46:24.720]  where they can get their hands on children.
[3:46:24.720 --> 3:46:26.920]  So we know that that's true.
[3:46:26.920 --> 3:46:28.880]  And it's, it's got to be brought to an end.
[3:46:28.880 --> 3:46:31.880]  It's got to be completely exposed for what it is.
[3:46:31.880 --> 3:46:36.760]  And in my opinion, it needs to completely be, completely be dissolved.
[3:46:36.760 --> 3:46:40.400]  I don't see any good left in child protective services.
[3:46:40.400 --> 3:46:46.320]  As far as picking up a child that's being totally abused, the police could do that just
[3:46:46.320 --> 3:46:48.200]  as well as child protective services.
[3:46:48.200 --> 3:46:53.200]  And then you have due process and exactly, we'll take, take Texas.
[3:46:53.200 --> 3:46:56.280]  Did you hear about the Texas Youth Commission?
[3:46:56.280 --> 3:46:57.280]  I don't know.
[3:46:57.280 --> 3:46:58.280]  I mean, there's so many crimes.
[3:46:58.280 --> 3:47:01.440]  I would, I mean, I'm not knocking if you haven't, you're not talking about all those children
[3:47:01.440 --> 3:47:04.560]  in Texas that were picked up at one time.
[3:47:04.560 --> 3:47:07.320]  I know that was what the Mormon, that Mormon sector, right?
[3:47:07.320 --> 3:47:14.440]  Did you hear about how the child jails and the child facilities had organized pornographic
[3:47:14.440 --> 3:47:18.480]  rings and like big rape parties for the children?
[3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:21.560]  And the state police found out about it and then weren't allowed to stop it.
[3:47:21.560 --> 3:47:24.760]  And now they forced the director out because he did the right thing.
[3:47:24.760 --> 3:47:29.680]  I have heard about that in other states, but I have not heard about what happened in Texas.
[3:47:29.680 --> 3:47:30.680]  No.
[3:47:30.680 --> 3:47:31.680]  Okay.
[3:47:31.680 --> 3:47:36.040]  Well, well, here in Texas, it came out that every major facility was doing stuff that
[3:47:36.040 --> 3:47:37.040]  people wouldn't even believe.
[3:47:37.040 --> 3:47:38.720]  You can read it in the mainstream news.
[3:47:38.720 --> 3:47:42.880]  Now they use that to pass a law for more money for the agencies.
[3:47:42.880 --> 3:47:46.440]  I'm sure you heard about Florida where it turned out the directors were pedophiles and
[3:47:46.440 --> 3:47:49.720]  3000 kids were missing and all that.
[3:47:49.720 --> 3:47:50.720]  What did they get?
[3:47:50.720 --> 3:47:51.720]  More money, more power.
[3:47:51.720 --> 3:47:57.120]  The incredible thing is the worse they get, the more money and power they get.
[3:47:57.120 --> 3:47:58.880]  It appears that way.
[3:47:58.880 --> 3:48:04.040]  It appears that way, but all of it is based on money and that's where it's going to have
[3:48:04.040 --> 3:48:06.120]  to be cut off.
[3:48:06.120 --> 3:48:11.360]  The federal incentives have got to be cut off and be removed on a federal level in order
[3:48:11.360 --> 3:48:12.920]  to get this stopped.
[3:48:12.920 --> 3:48:14.640]  And that's where we go now in the closing minutes.
[3:48:14.640 --> 3:48:18.840]  We have left in the center of the senator and again, we can only commend you and pray
[3:48:18.840 --> 3:48:22.840]  for you in this fight and then politically going after you solutions.
[3:48:22.840 --> 3:48:27.800]  But before we hit that, I wanted to finish up specific orders for specific children that
[3:48:27.800 --> 3:48:29.280]  look a specific way.
[3:48:29.280 --> 3:48:31.560]  I mean, you've now seen you've discovered that.
[3:48:31.560 --> 3:48:32.560]  Right.
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:33.560]  Right.
[3:48:33.560 --> 3:48:34.560]  We have discovered that.
[3:48:34.560 --> 3:48:38.680]  We haven't discovered it in every state, but we've discovered it in many states.
[3:48:38.680 --> 3:48:45.080]  And we have so many, we have so many families calling that are absolutely delirious.
[3:48:45.080 --> 3:48:46.680]  They are so desperate.
[3:48:46.680 --> 3:48:48.760]  They do not know where to turn.
[3:48:48.760 --> 3:48:52.600]  And actually they have no place to turn for help.
[3:48:52.600 --> 3:48:59.320]  And of course, parents, the poor the families are, those are the ones who are targeted
[3:48:59.320 --> 3:49:04.720]  because they don't have the wherewithal to fight the system or hire an attorney and they
[3:49:04.720 --> 3:49:10.600]  are just caught up in it and, and many of them are because their children are blue-eyed
[3:49:10.600 --> 3:49:15.480]  or blonde or exactly what someone wants and those families are targeted.
[3:49:15.480 --> 3:49:21.160]  So it, it, it is just heartbreaking as to what is going on and what, and what we've
[3:49:21.160 --> 3:49:24.800]  got to do in order to bring this to an end.
[3:49:24.800 --> 3:49:28.320]  You ever heard about what the former head FBI agent in Southern California discovered
[3:49:28.320 --> 3:49:31.320]  about the CPS, even in the 80s?
[3:49:31.320 --> 3:49:36.320]  They have public auctions, closed auctions in Las Vegas with the kids on the block.
[3:49:36.320 --> 3:49:37.320]  He's people.
[3:49:37.320 --> 3:49:42.960]  Well, you know, we have some states now that put the children on, on, on the internet and
[3:49:42.960 --> 3:49:47.280]  you can just go through their pictures and choose the one you want.
[3:49:47.280 --> 3:49:51.440]  See how pure evil is just right out in the open now, like it's no big deal.
[3:49:51.440 --> 3:49:56.960]  And then there are some children that even if you might like to, if a, if a really good
[3:49:56.960 --> 3:50:04.320]  person who is really trying to help a child will choose that child, often time then, then
[3:50:04.320 --> 3:50:08.440]  they refuse to let these parents have the child.
[3:50:08.440 --> 3:50:13.440]  So if your motives are pure as the driven snow and you're trying to really help get
[3:50:13.440 --> 3:50:19.000]  a child out of that system and give them a new life, often time they won't let the children,
[3:50:19.000 --> 3:50:20.000]  the child go.
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:24.720]  No, they want client houses where they warehouse the kids a lot of times locked up and they've
[3:50:24.720 --> 3:50:29.200]  ruled, oh, they're really, they can legally lock them up and stuff on these little cages.
[3:50:29.200 --> 3:50:33.720]  They only want client foster parents that want to run the money in and put them on drugs
[3:50:33.720 --> 3:50:35.880]  because that's shared with the local CPS.
[3:50:35.880 --> 3:50:36.880]  Right.
[3:50:36.880 --> 3:50:37.880]  Right.
[3:50:37.880 --> 3:50:43.160]  It's just, it is, it is one of the most corrupt situations that we could ever have in this
[3:50:43.160 --> 3:50:44.160]  country.
[3:50:44.160 --> 3:50:48.520]  And what we need is to take the country back, have mass trials and hang about 10,000 of
[3:50:48.520 --> 3:50:51.360]  these people high because this rivals the Nazis.
[3:50:51.360 --> 3:50:53.160]  By the way, the Nazis had CPS.
[3:50:53.160 --> 3:50:55.200]  That's how they started grabbing people's kids.
[3:50:55.200 --> 3:50:59.000]  The year Hitler was elected in 1933, he was a eugenicist.
[3:50:59.000 --> 3:51:00.240]  We'll be right back with the senator.
[3:51:00.240 --> 3:51:01.240]  Stay with us.
[3:51:01.240 --> 3:51:02.240]  Final segment.
[3:51:02.240 --> 3:51:06.600]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[3:51:06.600 --> 3:51:11.360]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[3:51:11.360 --> 3:51:12.360]  Hi, folks.
[3:51:12.360 --> 3:51:13.360]  Alex Jones here.
[3:51:13.360 --> 3:51:16.760]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calvin Pearsows?

[3:51:21.080 --> 3:51:22.080]  products now.
[3:51:22.080 --> 3:51:28.200]  Marty Schachter founded Calvin's subcompany in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.

[3:52:02.280 --> 3:52:08.360]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.360 --> 3:52:12.880]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:52:12.880 --> 3:52:14.160]  us would like to see.
[3:52:14.160 --> 3:52:19.320]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests
[3:52:19.320 --> 3:52:20.520]  of the American people.
[3:52:20.520 --> 3:52:25.080]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:25.080 --> 3:52:30.160]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:30.160 --> 3:52:38.240]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[3:52:38.240 --> 3:52:41.880]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.880 --> 3:52:48.800]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:53:05.400 --> 3:53:08.520]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months.
[3:53:08.520 --> 3:53:12.960]  And it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.

[3:53:53.920 --> 3:54:18.200]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[3:54:18.200 --> 3:54:40.080]  You'll be facing down one of these CPS workers and, man, you're like, these are demonic,
[3:54:40.080 --> 3:54:42.920]  soft, goblin-like creatures.
[3:54:42.920 --> 3:54:47.880]  They're art types because, I mean, how could somebody go around stealing kids all day outside
[3:54:47.880 --> 3:54:49.240]  the law and seeing horror?
[3:54:49.240 --> 3:54:54.080]  They enjoy it, they're evil, they enjoy the pain.
[3:54:54.080 --> 3:54:58.120]  I'm going to ask the senator about some solutions and maybe have her back on to go over some
[3:54:58.120 --> 3:55:00.400]  more of those and how to fight these people, how to expose them.
[3:55:00.400 --> 3:55:03.520]  I got to tell you about two sponsors before we go back to her.
[3:55:03.520 --> 3:55:04.520]  One of them is HomeGain.
[3:55:04.520 --> 3:55:08.000]  You can check out Max Little Orange Gorilla at infowars.com.
[3:55:08.000 --> 3:55:12.320]  They have a home sale maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most
[3:55:12.320 --> 3:55:14.880]  increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[3:55:14.880 --> 3:55:16.440]  It's absolutely free to enter your home address.
[3:55:16.440 --> 3:55:20.560]  They have a lot of great mortgage companies and other stuff you can contact through their
[3:55:20.560 --> 3:55:21.560]  site.
[3:55:21.560 --> 3:55:22.560]  It's just a great portal.

[3:55:29.640 --> 3:55:34.040]  And Survival Seed Bank, in a real crisis, folks, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability
[3:55:34.040 --> 3:55:37.320]  to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:41.720]  And you heard earlier from the London Guardian reporter, they're now restricting buying seeds
[3:55:41.720 --> 3:55:42.720]  in Europe and England.
[3:55:42.720 --> 3:55:47.680]  I mean, this is insane, you can check them out at survivalseedbank.com, heirloom, non-GMO
[3:55:47.680 --> 3:55:49.960]  seeds, super high-quality, great price.

[3:55:57.680 --> 3:56:02.200]  Okay, Senator, what are solutions to fight these demons?
[3:56:02.200 --> 3:56:06.640]  I mean, we just get the public educated what we're doing now about their rights, get bigger
[3:56:06.640 --> 3:56:12.120]  organizations together to fight them, Congress, state laws, because we always push to get
[3:56:12.120 --> 3:56:16.680]  state laws to stop them, and they always take it over and get more power out of us trying
[3:56:16.680 --> 3:56:17.680]  to lobby to reform.
[3:56:17.680 --> 3:56:19.480]  How do we beat pure evil?
[3:56:19.480 --> 3:56:25.800]  Very, very strong bill that I introduced to correct it here in the state of Georgia.
[3:56:25.800 --> 3:56:27.960]  And of course, that bill was defeated.
[3:56:27.960 --> 3:56:35.160]  I also had several parents lined up to come down and do a video, and the video was defeated.
[3:56:35.160 --> 3:56:39.680]  And then, of course, I lost my Senate seat, so there's a huge battle over this.
[3:56:39.680 --> 3:56:45.760]  And many states don't want to let that money go that they've gotten used to.
[3:56:45.760 --> 3:56:51.000]  And one thing we haven't mentioned that I'd like to bring out is how huge the bureaucracy
[3:56:51.000 --> 3:56:52.000]  is.
[3:56:52.000 --> 3:57:00.960]  It is made up of caseworkers and social workers and attorneys and guardian-adlitums and judges
[3:57:00.960 --> 3:57:09.880]  and psychiatrists and psychologists, and it goes on and on, the bureaucracy is huge,
[3:57:09.880 --> 3:57:15.440]  made up of people who look to the children in child protective services for their job
[3:57:15.440 --> 3:57:16.440]  security.
[3:57:16.440 --> 3:57:23.240]  And none of these people want to let this be brought to an end, this is where they get
[3:57:23.240 --> 3:57:24.240]  their paycheck.
[3:57:24.240 --> 3:57:27.080]  And it's not being brought to an end, it's radically expanding.
[3:57:27.080 --> 3:57:32.520]  Absolutely, it is, and they're expanding with it, and we can see the children that are
[3:57:32.520 --> 3:57:35.400]  already being sent into mental health facilities.
[3:57:35.400 --> 3:57:41.520]  I had a mother that two children were put in mental health facilities, and of course,
[3:57:41.520 --> 3:57:46.320]  that brings in Medicaid, and these two children were on 16 drugs a day.
[3:57:46.320 --> 3:57:47.320]  Good Lord.
[3:57:47.320 --> 3:57:54.280]  So it is corrupt to its absolute core, and we must stand against it, we must keep talking
[3:57:54.280 --> 3:57:59.520]  about it, and families that are listening to us today that are caught up in this, they
[3:57:59.520 --> 3:58:02.640]  need to continue to fight the system, continue to fight it.
[3:58:02.640 --> 3:58:06.560]  Senator, I've got to stop you, we've got 45 seconds, what about websites, or how do
[3:58:06.560 --> 3:58:09.280]  folks get a copy of your bill to get it passed in their state?
[3:58:09.280 --> 3:58:13.160]  I've got to have you back for more solutions, but contact info, groups you recommend.
[3:58:13.160 --> 3:58:21.000]  Are there just welcome groups that they can recommend, or they can contact me at Eagle
[3:58:21.000 --> 3:58:23.440]  Farm of Georgia.
[3:58:23.440 --> 3:58:28.280]  There's Google, Eagle Farm of Georgia, or there's also the Senator Nancy Schaefer website
[3:58:28.280 --> 3:58:29.280]  as well.
[3:58:29.280 --> 3:58:31.000]  Nancy Schaefer, we want to have you back up.
[3:58:31.000 --> 3:58:32.000]  God bless you.
[3:58:32.000 --> 3:58:35.120]  You're a true angel, and we appreciate your courage.
[3:58:35.120 --> 3:58:37.640]  I know it's hard to do what you do, because it's so hard.
[3:58:37.640 --> 3:58:39.760]  God bless you.
[3:58:39.760 --> 3:58:40.760]  Thank you, Senator.
[3:58:40.760 --> 3:58:43.440]  Our retransmission starts now, infowars.com.

[3:58:51.720 --> 3:58:53.320]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[3:58:53.320 --> 3:58:57.160]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[3:58:57.160 --> 3:58:58.160]  important than ever.
[3:58:58.160 --> 3:59:00.960]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[3:59:00.960 --> 3:59:03.920]  You'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your own bread.
[3:59:03.920 --> 3:59:07.840]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome, and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[3:59:07.840 --> 3:59:10.240]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[3:59:10.240 --> 3:59:13.480]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation between you.
[3:59:13.480 --> 3:59:17.920]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:59:17.920 --> 3:59:21.560]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the
[3:59:21.560 --> 3:59:23.680]  cost of last year's grocery prices.
