[00:00.000 --> 00:18.720]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover us you want answers well so does he live from
[00:18.720 --> 00:29.040]  Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones monday through friday we're here and then back
[00:29.040 --> 00:38.320]  sundays four to six p.m central standard time this is not a live broadcast but much of it is
[00:39.360 --> 00:47.040]  virgin is original that i've recorded especially for this Easter sunday i want to thank you for
[00:47.040 --> 00:52.880]  joining us coming up at the end of the hour we're going to premiere a special report on agenda 21
[00:52.880 --> 01:00.800]  land grabbing taking place right here in austin texas where i live and i's such a powerful interview
[01:00.800 --> 01:07.040]  earlier in the week with board christopher montan on how really the global warming swindle is the
[01:07.040 --> 01:13.040]  plan for global governance it's the heart it's the guts it's the engine of it and if you bring that
[01:13.040 --> 01:18.240]  down and we are very close to doing it that's why the globalists are just moving forward because
[01:18.240 --> 01:23.440]  they've had everything bet on it if we bring that down their whole system is in deep trouble this
[01:23.440 --> 01:29.280]  is their excuse to regulate and take over every facet of our lives it's the most important fight
[01:29.280 --> 01:34.160]  we've got going right now then we're going to get into a special report later in the second hour on
[01:34.160 --> 01:38.640]  the hegelian dialectic and how it ties into ebbard bernice you know i did a report on this
[01:38.640 --> 01:43.440]  a few weeks ago and i saw some guy on the youtube channel say hey glenn bet covered this last year
[01:43.440 --> 01:49.200]  well i've been covering ebbard bernice for a decade i covered it in a film five six years ago terror
[01:49.200 --> 01:55.840]  storm but so what if glenn bet covered it first good for him it's about how they're psychologically
[01:55.840 --> 02:02.400]  brainwashing us okay i could care less who's first this is not about territorializing information
[02:02.400 --> 02:07.040]  this is about defeating the new world order and not being manipulated and making the knowledge
[02:07.040 --> 02:14.240]  that i know and most my listeners know commonplace the people perish for lack of knowledge when people
[02:14.240 --> 02:20.480]  have knowledge they flourish it's that simple speaking of knowledge a couple years ago when
[02:20.480 --> 02:26.080]  they came on with ipads i was tired of the worship of it like like it was it's like when ipods first
[02:26.080 --> 02:30.880]  came out people would stop me when i had one in stores and just worship me young women men you name
[02:30.880 --> 02:35.520]  it oh my gosh it's so cool you know later nobody cares i just had it because i could listen to music
[02:35.520 --> 02:42.400]  on it but i executed an ipad right when they first came out and there was people freaking out even
[02:42.400 --> 02:46.000]  people in my office were like don't destroy that it's wasteful or you know it's a great piece of
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.280]  technology the point is by killing it millions of people saw that video of course it really wasn't
[02:51.280 --> 02:56.480]  alive i was drilling it and torturing it and i pointed out you don't care about me you know when
[02:56.480 --> 03:01.360]  i talk about how they're torturing children at obu grabe in iraq you don't care about that
[03:01.360 --> 03:05.680]  that's okay because you've been dehumanized who cares if kids are dying but if you see a puppy get
[03:05.680 --> 03:11.520]  killed you get upset but if you see an ipad get destroyed you get even more upset so it just shows
[03:11.520 --> 03:18.560]  the dehumanization like it's not that dovetail with this article desperate chinese boy sells kidney
[03:18.560 --> 03:24.880]  for two thousand pounds that's about three and a half thousand dollars to buy an ipad and iphone
[03:24.880 --> 03:29.280]  they're having a big investigation about it in china well i mean people in latin america sell them
[03:29.280 --> 03:34.080]  for a few thousand dollars and get locked up if they change their mind by the gangsters some people
[03:34.080 --> 03:38.480]  get killed and have their organs taken you know first it was a rumor in iraq and then in israel
[03:38.480 --> 03:42.160]  that people getting killed in the different conflicts we're having their organs taken
[03:42.160 --> 03:47.040]  since then it's been confirmed what was it a dutch newspaper first reported about israel and people
[03:47.040 --> 03:52.240]  were like that's a lie it's not true and then it turned out it was there's a lot of macabre stuff
[03:52.240 --> 03:59.440]  going on all over the world we need to learn to stand up against it and decryder it will just get
[03:59.440 --> 04:04.800]  worse and worse something else that's really disgusting is that they're reporting that forty
[04:04.800 --> 04:10.000]  seven thousand five hundred plus cases of paralysis being caused by the new polio vaccine being
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.920]  administered by the bill of melinda gates foundation in india and they're trying to cover that up
[04:13.920 --> 04:19.760]  right now big article by erin dykes paralysis case spikes in wake of bill gates polio vaccine
[04:19.760 --> 04:24.800]  effort in india that's up at info wars dot com by erin dykes get that article out to everybody
[04:24.800 --> 04:29.360]  because everywhere they go with these polio vaccines they're they're basically giving them
[04:29.360 --> 04:34.560]  a synthetic form of polio and it's all part of the hidden in plain view eugenics operation
[04:34.560 --> 04:50.480]  you'll be right back stay with us i'm alex jones of info wars dot com it's easter sunday
[04:50.480 --> 05:05.440]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty good
[05:05.440 --> 05:10.880]  sized meal that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the
[05:10.880 --> 05:15.520]  soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized world are
[05:15.520 --> 05:21.520]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies
[05:21.520 --> 05:27.920]  need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy i then searched out the best vitamin
[05:27.920 --> 05:33.360]  and mineral company out there and discovered young jevity the young jevity products are designed
[05:33.360 --> 05:38.400]  to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that you don't have to eat as much to
[05:38.400 --> 05:45.920]  be satisfied i've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals i need

[05:57.280 --> 06:10.240]  that's info wars team dot com you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you are
[06:10.240 --> 06:25.120]  receiving this transmission you are the resistance from deep in the heart of fema region six austin
[06:25.120 --> 06:34.880]  texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones that's right coming to you on this easter sunday
[06:35.600 --> 06:41.440]  the 8th of april 2012 this is a worldwide transmission against tyranny coming to you from
[06:41.440 --> 06:47.760]  fema region six no this is not the hunger games it's the real world under the un global banker
[06:47.760 --> 06:52.960]  dictatorship the president has openly told congress as well as the joint chiefs of staff
[06:52.960 --> 06:58.320]  and the sec def that the un commands the president that's on record the president has said the supreme
[06:58.320 --> 07:03.760]  court doesn't tell him what to do and that he is the ruler because he is the puppet of the un he's
[07:03.760 --> 07:09.120]  also chaired the head of the un security council that violates article one section nine and is
[07:09.120 --> 07:17.360]  treason with a capital t all right we have got the premiere uh on radio of a in-depth report
[07:17.360 --> 07:24.000]  that we did here in austin texas worked on for a week dealing with a un agenda 21 and the takeover
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.760]  of property this started 20 years ago in austin it's being done all over the world
[07:27.760 --> 07:33.680]  same model this is official un doing it uh the statesman reported on it back on march 31
[07:33.680 --> 07:38.960]  residents troubled by surveillance cameras now they've put up all these fences around land
[07:38.960 --> 07:43.280]  that they took from people remember back in the 80s and 90s to be a preserved green belt
[07:43.280 --> 07:48.320]  but then the city turns around and sells it to select globalist so they they want to keep people
[07:48.320 --> 07:54.480]  off of it not as parkland and they have cameras aimed at their homes um in in areas of austin
[07:54.480 --> 08:00.320]  in our finding people or arresting them if they dare walk on the king's property the new world
[08:00.320 --> 08:05.440]  orders property so that is coming up at the end of the hour we have an in-depth report with our
[08:05.440 --> 08:12.160]  own great reporters and researchers darin mcbrane and john bound that is coming up at the end of
[08:12.160 --> 08:15.600]  this hour and the final segment of this hour and and then we've got a lot of other special
[08:15.600 --> 08:20.720]  reports in the second hour i'll tell you about later but to segue into this i thought i'd
[08:20.720 --> 08:26.480]  place some excerpts of an amazing interview i did last week we had a story that went viral
[08:26.480 --> 08:32.400]  and was picked up by dozens of major newspapers when this professor here in the united states
[08:32.400 --> 08:38.400]  norgaard came out and said treat people for mental illness that question that man bear pig is our
[08:38.400 --> 08:43.600]  lord and savior no i'm being sarcastic uh that algore uh and and his whole global warming thing
[08:45.040 --> 08:52.160]  is a fraud if you question man bear pig uh who's very serial uh who's very serious well then
[08:52.720 --> 08:57.680]  you're in trouble and you're you're a mental patient i guess and there's all these other
[08:57.680 --> 09:03.760]  professors that say arrest us you know get us we need a police state like our own dr peonka ut has
[09:03.760 --> 09:09.200]  said that on msnbc and it became a big story and he says 90 of the population needs to go
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.160]  this is par for the course with these people well then norgaard came out and said she didn't
[09:14.160 --> 09:18.800]  mean that in her paper and then she took down all these other papers she wrote well we found
[09:18.800 --> 09:23.520]  a paper she wrote three years ago at another university calling for an end of what she calls
[09:23.520 --> 09:28.640]  democracy or the will of the people to save the earth by shutting down coal power plants
[09:28.640 --> 09:33.840]  and taxing carbon dioxide which is all a red herring diversion from real environmental problems so
[09:33.840 --> 09:38.560]  we're going to segue into this interview with lord christopher montan one of the leading people
[09:38.560 --> 09:44.480]  exposing all of this because this is the heart of the new world order global cartel mega bank
[09:44.480 --> 09:49.120]  takeover is this environmental cult that has nothing to do with the environment and is taking
[09:49.120 --> 09:54.560]  control of our society so we'll go to portions of this interview in the next three segments
[09:54.560 --> 10:03.040]  and then the big agenda 21 report coming up lord montan that's a long preface intro but
[10:03.920 --> 10:08.800]  you know i tell you they just think they're anointed and they think their authoritarianism
[10:08.800 --> 10:15.280]  doesn't stink what do you say lord montan one of the leading experts heading up your center that
[10:15.280 --> 10:20.160]  researches these people all of your research has been proven correct so now they're calling for
[10:20.160 --> 10:27.360]  shutting us up i think that puts it very bluntly and very correctly alex they are running scared
[10:27.360 --> 10:34.560]  if i can just review what the climate has been doing over the last few years we've just had
[10:34.560 --> 10:40.480]  literally two days ago figures from the hadley center and the climatic research unit at the
[10:40.480 --> 10:45.920]  university of east anglia these people have now admitted that there's been no statistically
[10:45.920 --> 10:53.680]  significant global warming for 15 years likewise the most accurate sea level satellite that we
[10:53.680 --> 11:00.000]  have had up there for a few years is the aviso envisa satellite that shows sea level over the
[11:00.000 --> 11:07.360]  last eight years since that satellite first went up rising at a rate of equivalent to 1.3 inches
[11:07.360 --> 11:14.000]  per century the florida state universities index of the activity of hurricane's tropical
[11:14.000 --> 11:20.160]  cyclones and typhoons around the world that shows the lowest level of hurricane activity
[11:20.160 --> 11:27.920]  in 30 years since the satellites were first watching the sea ice extent just today is greater
[11:27.920 --> 11:34.640]  for this time of year than it has been at almost any time since the 1979 when again the satellites
[11:34.640 --> 11:41.840]  were first able to watch and the spring has come a month late up there it's very very cold up there
[11:41.840 --> 11:49.440]  that's why we've had it warm down here so all their big storylines about how terrible it's all
[11:49.440 --> 11:54.640]  going to be are falling apart polar bears another one just today an important report
[11:54.640 --> 12:00.560]  out showing that the population of polar bears continues to grow as it has since the 1940s this
[12:00.560 --> 12:04.800]  is not the profile of a species in imminent threat of extinction well they're actually a scourge as
[12:04.800 --> 12:11.120]  you know invading green areas and attacking people and invading their homes absolutely they're now
[12:11.120 --> 12:15.760]  becoming very aggressive and intrusive because there are so many of them and they can't get enough
[12:15.760 --> 12:22.560]  food in these very very cold conditions unusually cold conditions in the Arctic so they increasingly
[12:22.560 --> 12:29.440]  invade the human settlements in Greenland and and Canada so these are the actual realities of the
[12:29.440 --> 12:36.880]  climate and it is quite clear that what they predicted would happen isn't happening and in fact
[12:36.880 --> 12:42.560]  if we look back on this now actually you and I've been at this for some time but the the UN's climate
[12:42.560 --> 12:50.880]  panel the IPCC produced its first report in 1990 and that course is a generation ago so shall we
[12:50.880 --> 12:56.400]  have a look at how their prediction of global temperature has got on they gave a high end
[12:56.400 --> 13:04.000]  a medium end and a low end prediction and yes there has been warming since 1990 but not very much
[13:04.000 --> 13:12.080]  it's actually below even the low end prediction of the IPCC they've got every single forecast that
[13:12.080 --> 13:18.800]  they've ever done wrong every single one of these forecasts was exaggerated plus the studies I've
[13:18.800 --> 13:23.360]  seen that you've covered and you're listing real facts here they'll just say peer reviewed but you
[13:23.360 --> 13:28.880]  have admitted facts they're not denying it a little bit of warming is actually good plus this gaggle
[13:28.880 --> 13:34.000]  of nuts said that we were going to be in an ice age by the nineties back in the seventies that's
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.160]  right so they what they want to do is they know they can get grants and attention and grow their
[13:40.160 --> 13:45.280]  little bureaucratic empires and academic empires by pretending there's a problem it doesn't matter
[13:45.280 --> 13:49.680]  which direction the problem they pretend is as long as they can all agree on telling the same
[13:49.680 --> 13:54.400]  story well first of all they tried to tell the story of global cooling where upon global warming
[13:54.400 --> 14:00.240]  began then the global warming stopped and they they can't change here they can't go back to global
[14:00.240 --> 14:04.800]  cooling or everybody will laugh at them they can't pretend that global warming is happening because
[14:04.800 --> 14:10.640]  for 15 years on their own figures on the figures of the cheerleaders for this whole scare it isn't
[14:10.640 --> 14:16.720]  happening and so now they're increasingly forced back onto these rather desperate expedients one
[14:16.720 --> 14:20.800]  of which we've come on to Norgaard in just a moment I want to do one more before that I came
[14:20.800 --> 14:25.440]  across this when I was addressing the law society of Ireland in Galway a few weeks ago they produced
[14:25.440 --> 14:30.240]  a graph you'll see it on the left wing websites too showing there have been many periods over the
[14:30.240 --> 14:35.920]  last 150 years since we kept global temperature records when there's been 10 or 15 years without
[14:35.920 --> 14:40.800]  any global warming like the last 10 or 15 years now of course what they don't realize when they
[14:40.800 --> 14:47.920]  show that that is the case is that that the fact exercises a very great constraint on the rate
[14:47.920 --> 14:54.480]  at which warming is occurring or could occur so yes we are getting a little warming you'd expect
[14:54.480 --> 15:00.800]  to see a little warming over the long term if you add lots of CO2 to the atmosphere but the point is
[15:00.800 --> 15:07.360]  it's not going to be very much it's not going to be alarming and even if it was as I said to the
[15:07.360 --> 15:16.240]  California state legislature just a week ago it's in their case it's about 30 times cheaper
[15:16.240 --> 15:24.800]  to sit back go surfing and enjoy the sunshine and adapt to the adverse consequences of any warming
[15:25.360 --> 15:32.240]  than it is to follow policies like California's bill AB 32 and build all those windmills in the
[15:32.240 --> 15:38.400]  outermost pass to kill all the golden eagles and hawks and kites that are that they're killing by
[15:38.400 --> 15:44.400]  the thousand every year these are environmentally damaging projects but the fact is it's vastly
[15:44.400 --> 15:50.480]  cheaper even if the warming was going to be as bad as they say it is to do nothing and that
[15:50.480 --> 15:56.240]  brings me on to professor norgan i'm sorry that i too have kind of come crab wise around the subject
[15:56.240 --> 16:02.240]  because i wanted to put what she is saying into context hi this is alex jones did you know that
[16:02.240 --> 16:07.120]  the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[16:07.120 --> 16:12.080]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold
[16:12.080 --> 16:16.240]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[16:16.240 --> 16:20.720]  that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the
[16:20.720 --> 16:26.960]  perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[16:26.960 --> 16:31.840]  supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[16:31.840 --> 16:37.280]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis

[20:17.120 --> 20:24.160]  christopher montan who heads up well there's no doubt globally the premier aggregator of the
[20:24.160 --> 20:29.360]  scientific data proving what's really happening with our planet with the real scientists the the
[20:29.360 --> 20:35.760]  real satellites he's the guy nine times out of ten that is forecasting and exposing these people
[20:35.760 --> 20:42.080]  way out ahead so they've called for his arrest you name it and he joins us now expanding on that
[20:42.080 --> 20:46.560]  they have expunged all the universities he's spoken at or that she's worked at except for
[20:46.560 --> 20:52.000]  whitman college three and a half years ago when she was commending obama for appointing john p
[20:52.000 --> 20:58.000]  holdren who's also called for a global tyranny and uh we're drugging the water to sterilize this and
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.040]  praising authoritarianism like dr peonka does at ut i mean this is who they are it's not like this
[21:03.040 --> 21:09.200]  is some oddball we found we have it we have it the university pulled what she'd written about
[21:09.200 --> 21:14.960]  treating us for mental illness and said that it was a mist it was a mistake and now we find this
[21:14.960 --> 21:20.160]  don't wait for public consensus a public letter she says public opinion does matter in democracy
[21:20.160 --> 21:25.040]  but this is a time when following it would be a serious mistake two factors make public
[21:25.040 --> 21:29.680]  understanding of climate change unusually complex she goes on to say we're stupid and then it says
[21:29.680 --> 21:39.040]  eliminate coal uh all of this stuff she says we can't do what the public wants this is even three
[21:39.040 --> 21:43.600]  and a half years ago they knew they were losing momentum and failing because of their power grab
[21:43.600 --> 21:48.960]  lord montan what do you make of this this is a huge discovery that that the little poster girl
[21:48.960 --> 21:55.520]  that they're defending it turns out is an open authoritarian that's no surprise because so many
[21:55.520 --> 22:00.880]  particularly in sociology which is a non-subject which i would personally ban from all universities
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.600]  if i were an authoritarian that is these people think that they know better than we do this is
[22:07.600 --> 22:14.800]  the essence of totalitarianism they say they know they are so much sure that they know better than us
[22:14.800 --> 22:20.320]  that they want to tell us every little detail of our lives no you can't burn coal in the great
[22:20.320 --> 22:25.920]  or in a power station no you can't light a candle it gives off carbon dioxide no you can't even go
[22:25.920 --> 22:31.520]  back to being a caveman because that means lighting a fire in your cave and that emits carbon dioxide
[22:31.520 --> 22:36.240]  what you've got to do is just die and stop breathing because breathing emits carbon dioxide as well
[22:36.240 --> 22:46.960]  it's this childish persistent stupid intellectually vapid arrogance which is the hallmark of a totalitarian
[22:46.960 --> 22:52.080]  everywhere and if you call them totalitarians or fascists or communists or international socialists
[22:52.080 --> 22:59.280]  or whatever phrase also means totalitarianism oh how they blub i once let slip in australia
[22:59.280 --> 23:05.680]  that a remark by somebody over there was a fascist opinion i didn't even call the guy of fascism i just
[23:05.680 --> 23:11.840]  said he'd expressed a fascist opinion and oh my goodness how the left wailed and howled when i
[23:11.840 --> 23:16.880]  arrived in australia for a speaking tour last year the west australia and in perth where i landed on
[23:16.880 --> 23:23.920]  the front page said ban the lord that's their instinctive reaction every time you use their
[23:23.920 --> 23:29.680]  kind of language back they want to ban us from saying it but they want to continue to have the
[23:29.680 --> 23:35.840]  freedom to use this language themselves so there's a poisonous double standard there and this professor
[23:35.840 --> 23:42.240]  norgaard the fact is that if she had wanted to deal with what happened in a professional way let us
[23:42.240 --> 23:48.960]  suppose that her original paper as she now claims didn't contain anything about the treatment of
[23:48.960 --> 23:54.960]  individuals who had this mental disease of not believing that global warming is a global crisis
[23:54.960 --> 24:00.080]  let's suppose that she was true in that i'm not going to argue that for the moment at this point
[24:00.080 --> 24:06.080]  the fact is that her university in a press release which i read while it was still up on the web
[24:06.080 --> 24:12.320]  said that she in her paper was there press release describing what she had done they had cleared it
[24:12.320 --> 24:18.320]  with her before she before it was put up there said very clearly that this must be recognized
[24:18.320 --> 24:24.800]  and treated in individuals as well as in societies as a whole that's what it said and then when i
[24:24.800 --> 24:31.120]  spotted that i wrote to her a very polite letter and i said look professor i don't know whether you
[24:31.120 --> 24:35.520]  said this or not but the university is saying that you did or at least it is accused of saying
[24:35.520 --> 24:40.480]  that you did because i haven't yet seen the university press release then i looked at it again
[24:40.480 --> 24:46.320]  afterwards i said if that is what they're they're saying could you please get it changed because
[24:46.320 --> 24:51.200]  this does give a very bad impression and it's taking us back to the era of hitler and starling
[24:51.200 --> 24:56.320]  the very polite letter and i had it for good measure a few points about why global warming
[24:56.320 --> 25:03.040]  really wasn't a global crisis after all and the thing is i got no reply what she should have done
[25:03.040 --> 25:08.080]  is to write back and say thank you for writing in such a civilized fashion to point out what appeared
[25:08.080 --> 25:13.360]  on the press release i hadn't noticed this i've asked the university to change it and they're
[25:13.360 --> 25:17.920]  going to put up a new version and that would have quietened the whole matter down in a perfectly
[25:17.920 --> 25:24.640]  straightforward way but no the left can never admit they ever got anything wrong so she didn't do that
[25:24.640 --> 25:32.640]  instead furtively the university without it hoped leaving any treks took out the words and treated
[25:33.280 --> 25:38.080]  in the press release that was up the university of oracle and that those words no longer appear
[25:38.080 --> 25:42.240]  the lord among them let me stop you let me stop you here because this first i must finish this
[25:42.240 --> 25:47.760]  because there is a google catch of the earlier version of the page and that proves that the
[25:47.760 --> 25:53.920]  words were there the university didn't realize that in doing this furtively it was going to make
[25:53.920 --> 26:00.160]  itself look just like another third world dictatorship and what these people have got to learn is
[26:00.160 --> 26:05.600]  they've got to learn that in fact in civilized open debate there has to be a kind of modicum of
[26:05.600 --> 26:11.840]  honesty which these people have long since abandoned and that's why nobody listens to them anymore
[26:11.840 --> 26:16.640]  well that was my point though is that you're being very kind here saying you know perhaps
[26:16.640 --> 26:22.880]  but but look you they've expunged all her writings the one writing we find on a university written
[26:22.880 --> 26:28.480]  by her a letter to the president officially her site says we need to get rid of people's
[26:28.480 --> 26:35.040]  rights on this and do whatever we want and we know this drug treat reeducate is is constantly
[26:35.040 --> 26:41.760]  parroted by the entire gaggle so she spews a talking point that that we've seen at nauseam by
[26:41.760 --> 26:49.280]  other control freaks uh other greeny you know uh authoritarians and then we find another thing they
[26:49.280 --> 26:56.640]  haven't memory hold yet and it says the same stuff so so i mean obviously she said it i i think the
[26:56.640 --> 27:01.840]  point is that the way i like to approach these people is to be very polite to them privately and
[27:01.840 --> 27:06.480]  say look uh something's gone wrong here maybe you'd like to put it right then if they're sensible
[27:06.480 --> 27:10.320]  they're like black and they're saying my goodness i'm so sorry of course i didn't mean that and and
[27:10.320 --> 27:17.360]  change it but she didn't write back to me and that tells me all i need to know about what her true
[27:17.360 --> 27:23.680]  intentions were because i didn't write a nasty email it was entirely friendly civilized sensible
[27:23.680 --> 27:28.640]  i'll send you a copy of it after this alex and you can put it up on your website because it makes
[27:28.640 --> 27:34.000]  very sensible points not only about her but also the main points about why we don't have a problem
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.640]  with with the climate and even if we did there's nothing we can afford to do about it it's much
[27:38.640 --> 27:43.520]  better not to worry about and just let it happen it won't be that damaging with sea level rising at
[27:43.520 --> 27:50.160]  1.3 inches per century etc so i think what we have to do is is to say very firmly to these people
[27:50.160 --> 27:59.360]  we are now on your case if you come out and demand international climate courts or european criminal
[27:59.360 --> 28:03.680]  climate courts they're actually talking about that in europe at the moment of course i'm trying to
[28:03.680 --> 28:09.600]  stop that too if you go on talking about having people sent to psychiatric institutions and
[28:09.600 --> 28:16.960]  treated for mental illness if they dare to rise raise perfectly legitimate scientific and economic
[28:16.960 --> 28:23.840]  questions rooted in the science then it is you who deserve to be locked up and not them and i'm
[28:23.840 --> 28:29.520]  going to make a proposal here alex i think we're going to need a law which says that anybody who
[28:29.520 --> 28:37.760]  uses that kind of hate speech about having people treated for mental illness if they dare to disagree
[28:37.760 --> 28:41.680]  with the official so-called consensus which of course is just the communist party line
[28:42.320 --> 28:50.560]  then i think anyone who says that should themselves be locked up in prison for hate speech for
[28:50.560 --> 28:56.640]  discrimination it's Easter Sunday thanks for joining us as we defend western civilization

[33:11.920 --> 33:17.200]  it's easter sunday you're listening to the alex jones show now back to our interview with lord
[33:17.200 --> 33:24.880]  christopher montan with your truth overload let me tell you the story of trofium dennis of it's
[33:24.880 --> 33:33.600]  like senko now he in the 1940s and 50s he was a peasant he was somebody who thought he knew about
[33:33.600 --> 33:39.840]  how to improve the yield of crops and his idea was you soak the seed corn in water over the winter
[33:39.840 --> 33:44.000]  instead of planting it out in the autumn to get used to the cold weather and then it germinates
[33:44.000 --> 33:49.600]  better in the spring it doesn't actually but that was his theory and he told his local communist
[33:49.600 --> 33:55.280]  party secretary this over a beer one night and the communist party secretary said trofium here you are
[33:55.280 --> 34:00.560]  an ignorant untutored peasant but you've come up with an idea as brilliant as this just because
[34:00.560 --> 34:05.840]  you live in the glorious soviet union and by this propaganda he ended up by some ghastly
[34:05.840 --> 34:11.840]  mischance as head of the soviet academy of sciences as a result of which there were 20
[34:11.840 --> 34:17.120]  failed harvests because they all had to pursue this ludicrous policy of soaking the seed corn in
[34:17.120 --> 34:22.560]  water where in fact it just becomes rotten and doesn't produce any crop and 20 failed harvests
[34:22.560 --> 34:29.760]  20 million soviet citizens killed of starvation as a direct result of this mad policy imposed from
[34:29.760 --> 34:35.920]  the center and anybody who quarreled with my son co and said this was wrong anybody who also opposed
[34:35.920 --> 34:43.760]  his notion there was no such thing as genetics was sent to prison or killed or both that was what
[34:43.760 --> 34:49.920]  actually happened in soviet russia and now the same kind of people are using the same kind of
[34:49.920 --> 34:57.280]  language and advocating the same kind of remedies and it is there not we who should go to jail and
[34:57.280 --> 35:02.880]  as the dictator of nicaragua used to say to those who he defeated in the various elections there
[35:02.880 --> 35:10.000]  you won the election but i won the count they like to stack the way things fall in their favor
[35:10.000 --> 35:16.240]  because they know that they can't beat us in argument if you read obama's hero sol alinsky
[35:16.240 --> 35:22.560]  another communist agitator just like obama himself alinsky and his rules for radicals he says this
[35:22.560 --> 35:27.360]  he says don't try to argue with the capitalists they are right we all know they're right we know
[35:27.360 --> 35:32.400]  they have the truth we know they can argue better than we can because they're right and true so if
[35:32.400 --> 35:38.240]  you want to deal with them attack their reputations and this is what she's doing she's trying to make
[35:38.240 --> 35:44.960]  out that anyone who dares to say that there may be something wrong with this bogus climate
[35:44.960 --> 35:51.280]  science that it's been oversold and over exaggerated and if there's no economic basis for it anyway
[35:51.280 --> 35:57.280]  anyone who says that she says is effectively mentally defective lord montan i wanted to look at the
[35:57.280 --> 36:02.800]  big picture here uh and talk about agenda 21 the environmentalists who aren't real environmentalists
[36:02.800 --> 36:07.040]  as you said they're just they're distracting from all the real stuff that's happening that needs to
[36:07.040 --> 36:13.040]  be dealt with they are establishing agenda 21 a global unesco model of the ultra elite against
[36:13.040 --> 36:18.800]  the rest of the free market a neo feudalism a post industrial world they've taken over 30 000 acres
[36:18.800 --> 36:23.680]  that's conservative in austin the last 20 years shang forcing people to sell it for pennies on the
[36:23.680 --> 36:29.520]  dollar uh farms and ranches in in key development zones i've interviewed the farmers and ranchers
[36:29.520 --> 36:35.520]  they take this one of the fastest growing cities in the us they take this land and a few years later
[36:35.520 --> 36:41.680]  take the restrictions off and they the commasars the former mayors and others sell it and control it
[36:41.680 --> 36:47.200]  and make money off of it open criminal activity and they and they told the citizens when we take
[36:47.200 --> 36:51.920]  this land it's going to be giant green belts but most of the land they didn't turn into green belts
[36:51.920 --> 36:56.560]  they built shopping malls on it movie theaters whatever the point is they stole it now here's
[36:56.560 --> 37:01.600]  the austin american statesman residents troubled by surveillance cameras on these tens of thousands
[37:01.600 --> 37:04.960]  of acres they haven't sold yet because they don't want humans using it because they'll think it's
[37:04.960 --> 37:12.560]  their park they put up big fences show folks a shot of this crew they put up big uh game fences uh uh
[37:12.560 --> 37:17.920]  where the backyard's back up and arrest people with hidden cameras that are seen ever walking
[37:17.920 --> 37:24.720]  on the land that was promised to be green belt and it says in the article worst of all they even
[37:24.720 --> 37:31.120]  hike on the trail the evil humans are hiking on the trail and they have hidden cameras watching
[37:31.120 --> 37:36.560]  the evil citizens i mean this is pure feudalism lord montan your comments on that well that's
[37:36.560 --> 37:42.960]  exactly what it is it is an outrage and i think it's time that instead of just complaining about
[37:42.960 --> 37:49.200]  this we started to make plans to fight back the first step it seems to me is to get the matter
[37:49.200 --> 37:54.240]  of president obama's birth certificate into court with a serious challenge rather than the joke
[37:54.240 --> 37:59.680]  challenges we've had so far the next thing to do is to make sure that the republicans who seem to
[37:59.680 --> 38:04.800]  me to be dead from the neck up and dead from the neck down every time this kind of outrage from
[38:04.800 --> 38:10.640]  the left comes out they should say something about it why is it left always to you and me
[38:10.640 --> 38:16.240]  and mark marano and a tiny handful of others to speak out and say that this kind of hate speech
[38:16.800 --> 38:23.680]  from professor norgaard's university is the kind of thing that ought to be a criminal offense if
[38:23.680 --> 38:29.760]  they try to make hate speech as they define it from us a criminal offense then it's time that
[38:29.760 --> 38:35.520]  they should endure the same thing if they go around accusing people like you and me alex of being
[38:35.520 --> 38:42.800]  mentally defective because we dare to question the notions of global warming that they present
[38:42.800 --> 38:50.480]  then they should go to jail for that because that is an unreasonable restriction on our right to our
[38:50.480 --> 38:56.800]  reputation and we have in in england a law called criminal libel you do that to me in england i'll
[38:56.800 --> 39:01.840]  have you been caught for it for criminal libel and you can go to jail for a long time for doing
[39:01.840 --> 39:08.400]  it now in the united states you have no such law and i think that free speech which is guaranteed
[39:08.400 --> 39:16.480]  in your constitution can only work if universities like that of oregon are told that if you use hate
[39:16.480 --> 39:22.400]  speech of that kind you can be fined millions of dollars and the people at the university
[39:22.400 --> 39:29.680]  responsible for it can go to jail for a very very long time let us start using against the left
[39:29.680 --> 39:34.720]  precisely the weapons they're trying to use against us and see how they like it well lord
[39:34.720 --> 39:40.800]  montan don't we start with not even calling him the left because i mean thomas jefferson was on
[39:40.800 --> 39:46.480]  the left you know the old classic liberal i mean i can say you would be a classic leftist in that
[39:46.480 --> 39:51.360]  you wanted more freedom more liberty i want to show some photos you can't see them lord montan
[39:51.360 --> 39:57.760]  later you can see the video this is for your request for video stills from the hidden cameras
[39:57.760 --> 40:04.480]  lining the the the preserve aiming at people's back kitchen window at night with them inside
[40:04.480 --> 40:09.440]  it eating they take tens of thousands of acres don't want you on it because they want you to
[40:09.440 --> 40:14.400]  forget it's theirs they could sell it later to their friends and the reason why they want to keep
[40:14.400 --> 40:19.920]  you off it is that there is a very ancient right which goes back to roman law and came to your law
[40:19.920 --> 40:27.280]  through english law it's known as youtube fractal right of use and that if the public passes freely
[40:27.280 --> 40:33.040]  over what would otherwise be private land without any restriction or fence or anyone saying you
[40:33.040 --> 40:41.040]  mustn't do it for 10 or 12 years against these the public then gains a right of way which makes
[40:41.040 --> 40:45.840]  a mess of their plans later to sell it on to developers that's why they're putting those
[40:45.840 --> 40:49.840]  fences up that's why they don't want you walking through the land it's not that you're going to
[40:49.840 --> 40:56.560]  tread on the voles or hurt the flowers no no no it's because they don't want you establishing a
[40:56.560 --> 41:02.960]  right of way so that they can't then sell the last three four exactly it was supposed to be a commons
[41:02.960 --> 41:08.480]  i remit on in the law it was supposed it's all over the country all the world with these u n land
[41:08.480 --> 41:14.000]  grabs it was supposed to be they said oh a commons park and they immediately fence it and don't let
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.440]  you use it and then later sell it i mean it's so evil how do you stop them it's because they
[41:19.440 --> 41:24.320]  don't want rights of way established because the right of way goes across there it vastly reduces
[41:24.320 --> 41:30.160]  the sale value to developers that's why they're doing this it's entirely for basically criminal
[41:30.720 --> 41:36.320]  reasons and the trouble is now that because the state has become so wealthy and the individual
[41:36.320 --> 41:40.880]  so comparatively poor through having to pay excessive taxation and comply with excessive
[41:40.880 --> 41:47.120]  regulation fewer and fewer individuals have the kind of wealth that is needed to take these people
[41:47.120 --> 41:54.880]  to the courts and get justice and so i am also looking at proposals now to set up effectively
[41:54.880 --> 42:03.680]  using their language of people's court which can call to account any official paid by taxpayers
[42:04.320 --> 42:12.800]  for their behavior and the people will be entitled to free representation at the expense of the public
[42:12.800 --> 42:18.640]  authority against whom they are bringing the charge just serves to level the playing field
[42:18.640 --> 42:26.080]  and allow us to get our points yes sir against we're out of time lord monkton just briefly what
[42:26.080 --> 42:31.840]  do you think of her reportedly saying it's racist i mean the the u n is in 21 that's pure racism
[42:32.480 --> 42:37.920]  of course it is all of its races all of it is designed to try to shut down the west and it is
[42:37.920 --> 42:44.880]  figuring to see so many people like her calling us names like racist when it is she who is the
[42:44.880 --> 42:50.720]  racist she is saying there are two races the clever ones like her and the mentally defective
[42:50.720 --> 42:56.960]  like us that is exactly racism and she should go to well said sir thank you thank you so much
[42:56.960 --> 43:02.320]  science and public policy dot org thank you lord mongton this is alex jones with five good reasons
[43:02.320 --> 43:07.440]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[43:07.440 --> 43:12.720]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power
[43:12.720 --> 43:18.240]  your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[43:18.240 --> 43:23.520]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[43:23.520 --> 43:28.800]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[43:28.800 --> 43:33.920]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[43:33.920 --> 43:38.480]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[43:38.480 --> 43:43.040]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[43:43.040 --> 43:47.360]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at

[46:05.840 --> 46:10.560]  the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[46:10.560 --> 46:14.560]  than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[46:14.560 --> 46:19.440]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[46:19.440 --> 46:25.200]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it

[47:47.840 --> 47:54.240]  liberty is popular freedom is popular so let's legalize freedom as ron paul has said so many
[47:54.240 --> 48:01.120]  times now this is a special report that first aired friday on info wars nightly news we have
[48:01.120 --> 48:07.680]  every evening at seven o'clock at prison planet dot tv with our own john bound doing some of the
[48:07.680 --> 48:12.560]  research and editing and then of course great researcher and reporter darin mcbrain dealing
[48:12.560 --> 48:18.960]  with agenda 21 i'm going to premiere it here on this easter sunday transmission for all of you
[48:18.960 --> 48:25.520]  that are listening now going back decades ago they began to come in and the name of environmentalism
[48:25.520 --> 48:30.400]  is the same model worldwide and take people's property for pennies on the dollar imminent domain
[48:30.400 --> 48:35.200]  saying would be giant green belts in parkland then they fence it don't let humans use it
[48:35.200 --> 48:40.880]  so that you don't think that it's yours and turn around and sell it off to insider developers
[48:40.880 --> 48:46.480]  that's what modern environmentalism is land grabbing all sorts of stuff now in austin there's
[48:46.480 --> 48:51.360]  tens of thousands of acres of this they're putting up big game fences and cameras watching
[48:51.360 --> 48:57.840]  citizens because they tend to go and then walk around and and use the green belts and preserves
[48:57.840 --> 49:03.920]  that were originally going to be for their use and the statesman a few weeks ago said even worse
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.640]  they're hiking on the trails you know where's the sheriff of nottingham when you need him you
[49:08.640 --> 49:16.480]  know to go after robin and how dare him that nave so here is the report on agenda 21 because this
[49:16.480 --> 49:23.360]  is the global land grab power grab system that is attacking our once free society we also sell
[49:23.360 --> 49:29.760]  a book at info wars dot com behind the green mask that really exposes this globalist takeover
[49:29.760 --> 49:54.800]  fraud here it is the city of austin texas has installed motion detecting surveillance cameras
[49:54.800 --> 50:01.440]  along the property lines of people's backyards in western travis county there ought to be a way
[50:01.440 --> 50:09.520]  eventually where those cameras can be oriented uh in a away from the homes if they want to watch
[50:09.520 --> 50:15.280]  for any movement or any trespass out there they have a right to do that and if the surveillance
[50:15.280 --> 50:21.680]  cameras weren't intrusive enough the city has also installed these prison style fences along the
[50:21.680 --> 50:30.400]  property lines they put this prison fence up and have cameras pointed at you and only you in fact one
[50:30.400 --> 50:37.520]  home just a couple down cleared all the cedar trees planted grass and mows the area trespassing
[50:37.520 --> 50:42.880]  regularly out there to keep that area mowed it doesn't make it and and yet they didn't put a fence
[50:42.880 --> 50:48.800]  up there they didn't put any cameras in these unfortunate residents are neighbors to an encroaching
[50:48.800 --> 50:55.760]  vacuum of government land grabbing all tied to the precautionary principle of the un's agenda 21
[50:56.400 --> 51:00.560]  i was the county judge of travis county when the balcony's canyon lands
[51:00.560 --> 51:05.200]  conservation plan and the permit under the endangered species act was applied for
[51:06.400 --> 51:13.760]  this wasn't long after i took office in 1987 it was announced that the territory uh
[51:13.760 --> 51:23.360]  uh nesting areas for the golden cheek warbler and the black cap vario covered a huge area
[51:23.360 --> 51:33.440]  of western travis can and in essence what the uh the us fish and wildlife said was that to enforce
[51:33.440 --> 51:40.400]  the endangered species act that there could be no tree clearing there could be no development
[51:40.400 --> 51:50.160]  activities um and uh anything that might cause noise during the breeding season nesting season
[51:50.160 --> 51:56.160]  it shut down any development in the western part of the county a lot of public money millions of
[51:56.160 --> 52:03.360]  dollars of public money that went into buying the preserves area um from the landowners the
[52:03.360 --> 52:09.360]  nature conservancy and others got private money in there and helped leverage uh purchases some
[52:09.360 --> 52:14.320]  property owners just sold conservation rights they were able to stay there they don't develop it but
[52:14.320 --> 52:20.000]  they but they got paid to conserve their area if they don't do a good job of managing the
[52:20.000 --> 52:26.880]  preserves and protecting them from fire every bit of the money that was invested in public
[52:26.880 --> 52:31.680]  private farms for these preserve systems is wasted i don't think our elected officials
[52:31.680 --> 52:37.840]  are paying much attention to this and instead they're overreacting yeah with with this kind of
[52:37.840 --> 52:44.640]  bull uh hurting adjacent homeowners for for doing things that frankly should have been
[52:44.640 --> 52:49.040]  done by the government itself they should have cleared those trees away from the neighborhoods
[52:49.040 --> 52:54.560]  and done a better job of managing the preserves so they help the species so we got the worst of
[52:54.560 --> 53:00.560]  both worlds but if you're considering buying a home next door and you you see there's cameras
[53:00.560 --> 53:07.520]  out there spying on the backyard and this ugly fence next door you're not as interested in buying
[53:07.520 --> 53:14.160]  that home next door the precautionary principle states that if an action or policy has a suspected
[53:14.160 --> 53:20.800]  risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment in the absence of scientific consensus
[53:20.800 --> 53:27.600]  that the action or policy is harmful the burden of proof that is not harmful falls on those taking
[53:27.600 --> 53:34.880]  the action basically guilty before proven innocent the european union deems this principle an actual
[53:34.880 --> 53:41.040]  law while the united states has labeled it a precautionary approach and uses it to create
[53:41.040 --> 53:47.920]  policy the genesis of agenda 21 begins with the brettland commission's our common future
[53:47.920 --> 53:55.200]  reported to the united nations in 1987 this report defined the term sustainable development
[53:55.760 --> 54:01.600]  stated as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of
[54:01.600 --> 54:08.160]  the future generations to meet their own needs in order to define what these needs of the present
[54:08.160 --> 54:14.560]  are and what to implement in order to scale down daily aspects of human activity morris strong
[54:14.560 --> 54:23.920]  developed agenda 21 and presented it at the real earth summit in 1992 i'm a change affects the very
[54:23.920 --> 54:30.480]  future of life on earth we have to remember that life as we know it on earth has only existed for a
[54:30.480 --> 54:37.360]  very small portion of the earth's history and within very narrow parameters and we are taking
[54:37.360 --> 54:45.600]  those products so life is actually in danger the four sections of 40 chapters of agenda 21
[54:45.600 --> 54:54.560]  leave no stone unturned when it comes to absolute control of humanity it places nature above mankind
[54:54.560 --> 55:00.960]  and calls for an end to national sovereignty the abolition of private property the restructuring
[55:00.960 --> 55:08.080]  of the family and restrictions on transportation and individual opportunity this map clearly
[55:08.080 --> 55:14.960]  shows the human settlement zones according to agenda 21 planned for the near future red is off
[55:14.960 --> 55:22.400]  limits yellow is highly regulated and green is normal use president clinton issued executive
[55:22.400 --> 55:28.480]  order number one two eight five two creating the president's council on sustainable development
[55:29.040 --> 55:35.760]  the pcsd has eroded the foundation of us public policy according to the master plan of the united
[55:35.760 --> 55:43.440]  nations ever since we are talking about a globalist plan that remakes your city to a specific model
[55:43.440 --> 55:48.960]  this is not only in the united states it's all across the united states and all across the world

[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:45.200]  admit that they doctored it wasn't a mistake they won't release who did it you know nbc's basically
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.400]  run by the white house so is msnbc i guess that little you know what didn't fall too far from

[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:20.240]  it's about them controlling the moral high ground and putting you off balanced like saying hey buddy

[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:08.800]  into why even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving and my research led me
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:13.920]  to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:19.280]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:25.440]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:31.680]  i then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered young jeviti

[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:28.000]  deep the rabbit hole goes it is easter sunday it is the eighth day of april 2012 and we are now into
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.760]  hour number two coming up in the final segment of this hour we'll look at mind control the war on
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.480]  for your mind and i was just mentioning we'll examine the hegelian dialectic of manipulation
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:45.200]  and philosophy and how it ties into edward bernage the father of modern brainwashing in advertising
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:51.280]  that's coming up but first former businessman who got caught up in iran contra was an iran contra
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:57.760]  whistleblower bob fletcher joins us he was one of the first people that i ever saw fair it out
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:03.360]  the un treaty on weather manipulation with all the big tornadoes we saw last weekend
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:07.760]  in dallas and some of the strange things that are happening i thought we'd talk to bob fletcher
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:17.840]  about weather weapons that have now been declassified we're not in kansas anymore and more and more
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:22.480]  meteorologists are mapping this and saying look there are more tornadoes it's not just that we
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:29.600]  have more doppler and better radar so we know when they happen but now they're hitting populated areas
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.840]  statistically more than they did in the past in areas that were already built up it's not like
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:39.120]  we've built up more so more is being hit that's part of it no cities are being hit more it was
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:44.400]  like someone was steering some said hundreds some estimates are hundreds that form but more than a
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:50.960]  dozen that hit the ground 800 homes had carnage fort worth dallas you know again my old stomping
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:57.680]  ground where i'm from and meteorologists are in msnbc calling it very unusual enter the fact that
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:04.080]  earthquakes are associated and tectonic weapons with auroras forming even in the daytime magnetic
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:09.680]  field like you normally only see at the north and south poles where the magnetic lines come into
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:14.880]  the earth and then out the earth's shield from the sun coming in at the north and southern poles
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:20.960]  you will see these vortexes form with all these other populations being hit in chile and and and
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:27.600]  pakistan and hitting right in key population centers in a few years ago in haiti i mean it is
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:33.040]  getting really weird and they admit they've got this but it's classified and enter paul watson's
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:38.080]  latest article another wisconsin town reports strange booms flashes of light and it's getting
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:42.720]  crazy and the feds have said do not investigate and again historically these are associated
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:47.920]  then with these weather pop-ups again you can get flashes of light and booms with natural tectonic
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:55.200]  activity bob fletcher great to have you back with us how did you first discover that weather
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:01.360]  weapons were being deployed and used when did you discover it you know your iran contra whistleblower
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:10.640]  successful businessman okay and it's a pleasure to be back i really enjoyed doing the program
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:20.320]  well basically i had because of the ending up being a federal witness in the iran contra thing
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:28.960]  and being a witness of federal witness relative to the christic institutes lawsuit back in the 80s
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:35.440]  which was basically a legal action on um of racketeering filed against all of those people
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.800]  that were involved with the iran contra stuff they actually had filed that legal action as a
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:49.040]  matter of fact uh prior to the expose that became the iran contra inquiry i was ended up being a
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:56.240]  witness and all of that and it that was what just switched on the light when i found out and and
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:05.280]  was right in the middle of it when i found out what kind of unbelievable lies and deviant stuff
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:12.160]  that was going on with people that we were hoping was leading our country in the right direction
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:19.360]  the senate the congress uh cia the fbi these guys were supposed to be the protectors of america
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:25.280]  as opposed to being the drug smugglers and the assassins of america because that's what i found
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:31.920]  out to be a reality and uh because i was there i've been there done that i saw it i sat in on
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:39.280]  conversations uh with these generals that were involved with the weapons uh and uh joking about
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:43.520]  where were they were going to go next with the where the next war was going to be and things
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:50.160]  of that sort uh and these guys profiting uh and of course that originally the the uh tremendous
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:59.360]  amount of the the weapons illegal weapons stolen weapons and drugs and all that the real big uh
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:05.520]  input was started in the vietnam war you know where they were smuggling the narcotics back and
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:11.440]  actually the carcasses of our own soldiers which i can't think of anything more absolutely
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:20.560]  disgusting than something like that uh and all of that that was uh what what opened my eyes
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:27.600]  all right so i started investigating and uh having people contact me after at the congressional
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.960]  and senate level you know there are a few guys always up there that are honest and legitimate
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:39.520]  and uh they're not there very long because they either become uh removed by assassination for
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:49.760]  cry out loud or they're simply removed by having somebody beat them in the next election by illegitimate
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:55.520]  voting or whatever the case is but they remove the good guys as quick as they can but there were
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:03.440]  always some good people up there that were looking into serious problems so in that time frame here
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:10.400]  we're talking going into their early 90s and i was investigating uh and being involved with
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:18.400]  several different inquiries out of at the senate and congressional level uh with some good guys
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:26.000]  donty feissel was out of florida was concerned with the financial fraud going on uh and uh
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.520]  several others uh doing things like that they were kind of under the radar these are not people
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:37.680]  that get a lot of media uh coverage but they're trying to do the right thing and of course uh
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:43.120]  sonny bono was another one right we get into that story some other time yeah we covered that last
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.880]  week so how did you discover weather weapons because now here's what here's what happened
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:53.040]  i get a i get a phone call because you know when you're doing this stuff i got all kinds of really
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.400]  great stuff where people just send me information and they would say you know don't mention my name
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:03.760]  you know but if you want to risk your life here's some information uh you know i kind of get a kick
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:12.480]  out of that but uh so i got a phone call and somebody said uh how about uh the weather control
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:19.520]  as a weapon and i said you know i was like you it was i was uh incredible i said i said what
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.360]  and he said yeah you know they're working on this thing where they can control the weather
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:30.880]  and and actually use it as a weapon of war and i said well well i mean if you could do that
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:37.040]  that would be really something i mean you could wipe out a country either financially or physically
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:42.480]  do all sorts of destruction of things but but you wouldn't it wouldn't be like a nuclear thing you
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:47.840]  know you you nuke a place you can't go in there for a hundred years so that's not a good a good
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:54.400]  way to take over a country or cause some problems but if you could control the weather that really
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:15:00.160]  would be something and of course but my reaction was you know okay well listen you know i got
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:05.680]  800 things to do this month so uh next month i'll look into it and he said well he said you know
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:13.440]  we have a treaty we have a treaty that we signed back many years ago with uh at the united nation
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:21.520]  that was in what 1976 that was right it was 70 technically it was 78 but uh so but it was
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:26.880]  started i guess around 76 uh you know and i see you know at that time of course nobody knew about
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:33.760]  this all right and uh it wasn't out in front and i said well i mean if i could find a a treaty
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:40.080]  you know that's actually signed relative to uh weather control uh and and being able to do this
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.880]  stuff that would really be something so i said okay i'll look into it stay there we're gonna see
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:51.040]  what you found next because folks i mean look at how they keep hitting all these cities with these
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:56.800]  tornadoes and they keep hitting mainly only in the cities and even the meteorologists are saying
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:02.000]  this is weird they're coming out of nowhere it's not natural this is alex jones with five good
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.200]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.560]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:17.840]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:22.960]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:28.400]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:33.680]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:38.240]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.720]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power

[01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:08.240]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:18.640]  network
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:35.680]  is there a method of the madness man other good at controlling us but more and more i realize the
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:41.040]  elite themselves are psychos who are out of control and who are probably going to be destroying us
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:48.240]  bob there's no question about it and and you know part of some of my earlier discoveries was uh
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:55.280]  the old iron mountain report which i'm sure you've done reports on uh and and for the people that
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:00.720]  don't don't understand what that was it was it was a report actually put together uh in the early
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:07.520]  sixties under uh john f kennedy originally and then passed on to uh johnson of course after
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:15.120]  he took a stepped in he took his step up uh to the presidency but the and the iron mountain report
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.280]  which there was always a big argument whether that was real or not real and all that but there
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:28.400]  was specifically they laid out um the the steps that were necessary to be taken in the united
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:36.160]  states of america at the government level as we moved into a one world government where we no
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:45.120]  longer were targeting russia and red china and etc and vice versa when we reached that point uh in
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.920]  la la land when the whole world was one big government what was going to be the the um
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:59.440]  um uh financial steps taken the psychological checks the steps the emotional steps what has
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:05.680]  to be done to control america and this was the important point was as they moved out of
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:12.320]  uh a constitutional government into world government because the idea was obviously
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:18.320]  you can't have a constitution that gives the people the rights to do what we have been doing for
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:26.720]  200 years in the united states of america when we move into a non uh non aggressive mode we have
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:35.920]  no enemies so in the the report it says we have to come up with uh synthetic enemies that are equal
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:44.640]  to the the dynamics of uh that that they are uh artificial enemies that might kill us the same
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:50.800]  as russia or red china might with atomic weapons for example so they write in the report they put
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:59.920]  in there you know what we can use uh terrorists unknown unspecified mystical terrorists that
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:06.960]  would cause us constant threat because they said to themselves that if we're taking all this money
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:14.160]  out of the pockets of the taxpayers right now on the basis of weapons that we have to have to protect
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:21.200]  ourselves from russia and and the red chinese and if we no longer have them as enemies we
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:26.560]  still want to be able to take the same amount of money out of their pockets so we have to convert
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:35.920]  into a new enemy they talked about um unknown terrorism and they talked about maybe uh ufo's
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:44.560]  maybe uh utilizing the concept of uh uh aliens threatening the future of the of the world and
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:50.400]  everybody would come together under one big umbrella and uh we can slowly eliminate the
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:57.200]  constitution that's literally written out in the iron mountain report and by the way that came out
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:04.240]  of the 1960s that got leaked and it's all come true the rand corporation uh i've interviewed alex
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:10.080]  abaya uh who wrote a best-selling book about world war two and so the rand corporation liked it
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:13.600]  and thought that they'd analyzed him and brought him in and he's one of the only people to ever
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.640]  be given access to their annals and he's come on the show and he said it was all true the end of
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:26.240]  the family world government uh phasing out all liberty uh i mean just a nightmare future it
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:34.480]  that is literally what they're establishing it is it was written and created in the 60s it was a 30
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:40.160]  year plan originally basically which we pretty much absorbed that at this point in time up through
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.400]  that would approve put it into the 90s they thought it would take that long to accomplish
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:50.800]  what they had to do they laid out steps one through nine by the way which included uh world
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:57.600]  currency which of course they're moving towards the power being transferred to the united nations
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:04.240]  or some others such an organization on weapons and things of that sort to move it out of the
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:11.680]  immediate control of individual nations which includes us and look at obama's telling congress
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.640]  you're no longer over war and congress sits there and takes it generals tell them you don't
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:22.320]  we're not you're not the boss anymore yeah and as a matter of fact that this fantastic story that
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:29.200]  happened uh i was contacted because i was out at this time um in the 90s all over the united
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:36.880]  states doing speaking engagements presentations before i became injured and um i had i was the
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:43.120]  nbc or abc contacted me and they said mr fletcher you're talking about this thing called the iron
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:50.720]  mountain report and uh i said yes and she and he he said would you come on uh and i think it
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:57.440]  was 60 minutes it was one of the major programs would you debate the fella that is still alive the
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:03.440]  old gentleman that actually originally wrote that book that exposed him you know the expose of this
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:10.560]  lennard louen lennard louen and he says uh because lennard louen is telling us that uh that he just
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:18.560]  made that all up that it was all just a novel that he actually put together and uh i asked this guy i
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:24.080]  said as a matter of fact the producer i was talking to his name was rick nelson and he had a sidebar
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:30.880]  so that um uh he says i said to him i said have you read that have you read the iron mountain
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:39.360]  and he said uh no i have it which didn't surprise me i said okay well i'll tell you what uh first off
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:47.280]  absolutely i will go on and debate him face to face on on uh on your program and uh i said i'm
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.480]  ready to do it next week you just let me know i said but he's not going to do that he's not going
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:57.440]  to sit face to face with me with the information that i've got on this and he says oh yes he's
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.480]  already said he would do it i said okay good i said but you need to also go over that iron
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:10.960]  mountain report well he called me back in about four days and he said uh miss fletcher the the
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:16.880]  network has decided they didn't want to do this and i said oh well how about that i said did you
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:23.680]  read that report and he says yes i said did you show it to your superiors which actually in that
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:28.800]  book and he said yes and i said well that's why they're saying they don't want to do it so the bottom
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:36.880]  line was uh that i told him i said look if this guy wrote this as a novel then one of two things
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:45.520]  has taken place the united states covert uh uh government looked at it and decided it was so
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:52.480]  great that they would model the entire future of the united states and the uh destruction of our
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:28:00.320]  constitutional government on the basis of this guy's novel that's one one thing otherwise this guy is
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:08.480]  the greatest psychic that ever lived because every single thing that he put into this report
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:14.160]  is taking place has either taken place already or they only have four more steps and they're
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:19.680]  going to be destroying the constitutional government on the basis of this guy's novel
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:26.880]  but anyhow the upshot was uh all of a sudden they changed from uh being terribly excited on having
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:34.160]  me do this show to uh calling back and saying uh NBC or whoever it was uh i don't recall rate
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:40.000]  today whoever it was uh they they weren't going to do it anymore so that's the end of that thanks

[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:05.840]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty good
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:11.760]  size meal that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.760]  that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized world
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:21.520]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:21.200]  this on-core uh interview with whistleblower bob flecher uh to get back also to the to the
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:29.760]  i don't know where they are now you know we have some natural things taking place in the weather
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:37.200]  there are weather changes going on that might be put into strictly the category of natural
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:43.040]  weather change well mars has its ice caps melting the entire solar system uh has been going through
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:48.880]  changes and paying al gore money won't stop the ice caps melting our mars correct correct so but
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.480]  they do exist but but what they've ended up being able to do so that people have a handle on this
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:01.200]  just in general with the with weather control they moved from what used to be the archaic manner
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:07.840]  by by which uh trying to change the weather with a seeding with a variety of chemicals and things
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:17.040]  of that to um uh what it is now electronic means to alter and control the weather and uh basically
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:27.840]  by using uh frequencies plasma beams and superheating the ionosphere in a specific targeted place
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:36.000]  they can actually superheat the waterless city ocean over a given square miles or they can
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:43.840]  superheat at the same time uh the ionosphere causing that that weather change that that normally
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:49.680]  might happen by nature with a hot and the cold weather hitting each other exactly they go that's
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:54.400]  what livingsons said that you know the father of weather weapons he said they go and find already
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:59.840]  the tipping point area and that's where they can get full control they can create hurricane
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:05.600]  stanford research institute it certified it by 67 they can kill them weaken them make them stronger
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:11.760]  and steer them yes and that's the big point that's exactly what it what he's saying is exactly what
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:19.200]  i was about to say uh and and that that's it now there's three parts to this thing now too in terms
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:28.160]  of of who is doing it we are doing it we are doing it profusely with uh uh under uh the heart program
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:36.160]  is only one part of it uh the the acres and acres of the uh the antennas towers and all that up in
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:44.240]  alaska there's another location similar to that on around the equator area but we have moved into
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:53.360]  using uh aircraft and satellites all right so you can do it like a triangulation assassination would
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:37:01.040]  do with two or three people shooting at one person uh you have the same kind of a triangulation
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:07.600]  application with plasma beams from two or three different places two satellites and maybe one
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:16.160]  ground base and and hit a given area very specifically so many miles up and so many miles east and west
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:24.320]  super heat the atmosphere and this is where also these uh some of the com trails come in
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:31.360]  some of the com trails they discovered uh again was i think an accidental thing a few years ago but
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:40.480]  that certain types of material etc would um could could hold temperature if they were floating in
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:47.520]  the air they found out they became conductive to hold a a an increased temperature so if you put
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:55.360]  out a com trail in a given area hit it with these totally invisible uh like a microwave beam uh
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:59.920]  that's what the other scientists have told me is that it's not just that they're adding some of
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:04.560]  the jet fuel that aerosolizes in some cases so they have special jet planes you know that go out
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:11.040]  and do heavy chem trailing but that that the beams they're firing into it is already resonating with
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:19.760]  natural nuclei forming out of the ice crystals and they're using the airwaves uh as as as uh the
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:28.240]  exhaust paths and the ice crystals as systems to beam data down over the horizon radar the
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:33.840]  heating the atmosphere it's it's everything oh yes and that and that's that's the problem it does
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:42.080]  it gets into a lot of different areas uh and by the way in 94 90 well 1995 when i had just
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:50.160]  was receiving the um it was a late 94 when i first got the um the united nations treaty uh
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:57.920]  very late i mean it's like the end of the year at the beginning of 95 i was able to get uh again
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:05.280]  utilizing a friend out of washington etc etc i contacted the right person and they sent me
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:14.720]  what amounted to being uh uh probably a thousand documents it was two cardboard cartons and they
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:24.000]  came basically this came out of um the um uh united states uh air force and it was their entire
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  year weather as a force multiplier it was the entire uh concept of um not only how they were
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:39.280]  doing it or planned to do it and how it's being put together but global weather networking uh and
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:46.400]  the application of military systems for weather modification operations and by the way you said
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:52.880]  this uh you know 15 16 years ago it's all been declassified now the exact names that you've used
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:57.680]  what they've talked about and again bill gates says that he's going to have this global weather
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:02.480]  bureau that controls your weather and see if you don't pay him well then some bad things are going
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:09.600]  to happen it's amazing now and also to to say that i i i said something just briefly or a couple
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:15.840]  minutes ago it's there's a three-sided deal to this now all right so we have what i call the
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:22.560]  covert government the secret government that's it's trying to control and and mess up uh america's
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:28.640]  future here and putting it all into their pockets so to speak um one world government control
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:33.920]  they're threatened by freedom because it will stop their monopoly they're bad guys right and what
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:41.520]  they've also done now however uh way back a long time ago the russians were involved with us directly
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:48.400]  at laurence livamore laboratories the russians were even given an award for their cooperation
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:53.440]  but they were here in laurence livamore laboratories working with our scientists
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:41:00.240]  on some of the earlier concepts on this many years ago so what happened was the russians back in the
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.840]  90s around the period of time that i was getting ahold of all of this the russians set up a company
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:14.720]  called elate elate and this was the russian weather control and modification and they don't hide it
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:19.840]  that's why they cleared things out for the red square events i mean they they advertise they
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:25.520]  control the weather right they they actually said that back in the 90s that uh for a couple hundred
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:31.760]  dollars american a farmer could be a guaranteed rain over his area and all that i don't know if
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:38.080]  they ever got to be good enough to do that but uh but when they started becoming uh running out of
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:44.960]  money okay when they all fell apart and all the rest of that um they sold this technology that
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:52.080]  they had that they actually developed with us hand in hand behind uh under the table all right
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:42:00.800]  they sold a tremendous amount of this to the red chinese uh so red china now with all of their
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:06.720]  money see they're able to purchase all of these weapons and things that uh previously they didn't
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:11.840]  have uh they could uh because now they have more money than than they know what to do with
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:18.800]  because we buy everything through kmart walmart but anyhow they uh so now what we end up with
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:25.120]  we have the russians with the potential to do it we have the americans covert operations doing it
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:34.560]  and we have the potential of the red chinese the red chinese weather control modification
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:44.880]  organization has 37 000 employees read my lips 37 000 now of course this is spread out all over
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:52.720]  they do a little bit of everything but that's how big the chinese weather modification operation is

[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:05.200]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:10.720]  good size meal that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:15.280]  the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized world
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:21.040]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:04.800]  the global banking cartel has used one tried and true process to create wars rob us of our
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:11.680]  currency and eat away at our substance this process of control over the masses is called
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:21.200]  the hegelian dialectic so what is it and how is it being used today german philosopher george
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:28.160]  willhelm friedrich hegel devised a dialectic or method to resolve a disagreement between outcomes
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:37.760]  the dialectic is made up of three attributes thesis an idea or opinion antithesis the opposite
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:44.480]  idea or opinion and synthesis the alchemic process to bring together a wanted change
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:52.160]  change it is commonly referred to as order out of chaos and is waged against the masses in many

[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:12.000]  non challenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people they must feel so frustrated
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:19.840]  so defeated so lost so futureless in the prevailing system that they're willing to
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:26.960]  let go of the past and chance the future george bush became the hero of 9 11 simply due to the
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:32.160]  fact that he was the president and then rammed through legislation that threatened our liberties
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:39.280]  as we all complacently stood by and allowed it to happen a manufactured crisis occurs thesis
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:45.680]  this george bush answers it by rallying public opinion and becoming the host of the tragedy
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:53.120]  antithesis thus owning the crisis through synthesis equilibrium is attained all the
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:59.040]  one separate parts of the plan are joined together in this example the patriot act acting as the
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:05.040]  equilibrium on the desired road to tyrannical fascism in america they're too good at what
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:10.720]  they're doing they create the crisis on record they sell the fraud then they say give us more power
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:15.680]  give up your sovereignty europe america and we'll fix it but then it only implodes faster
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:21.120]  they make bigger bonuses but they're destroying their own golden goose they're hacking it open
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.360]  greedily when it's giving them a golden egg every morning they think there's eggs inside
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:30.640]  i i think the point you made of that because their own record creating this to consolidate power
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:35.680]  they've bragged about it uh those those memos have been made public by goldman sacks and others
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:40.080]  but they're going to fry things so badly the bankers are all running to private islands with
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:46.800]  their own security teams i mean like they want to rule everything so much and have just so many
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:51.200]  digits in their bank accounts that they're going to devalue the value of the digits through their
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:58.160]  sheer greed that is possibility and if you look at the hegellian dialectic uh if that that crisis
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:05.280]  at the beginning spins out of control uh they lose the tail end of the dialectic jumping uh
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:10.400]  there will be no synthesis at the end they'll be lucky if they survive another method to manipulate
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:17.360]  the masses is the use of two opposing views to attain the desired view politician a espouses the
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:24.000]  first view politician b counters with a different view a clear example of this was the debate over
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:31.440]  the unconstitutional n d a a bill of 2012 i strongly believe that the united states government
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:39.760]  should not have the ability to lock away its citizens for years and perhaps decades without
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:48.080]  charging them and providing a heightened level of due process process we don't pick up citizens
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:58.720]  we don't incarcerate them for 10 or 15 or 20 years or until hostilities end and no one knows when
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:06.160]  they will end without giving them due process of law the great concern that we have now in terms of
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:15.440]  the security of the homeland uh is from so-called uh homegrown terrorists radicalized americans
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:23.440]  so uh these people in my opinion have have taken sides they've joined the enemy and uh
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:32.480]  to have this body at this time as the threat of homegrown terrorism rises say no they can't be
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:39.760]  treated as enemy combatants uh it is not all done not only doesn't make sense and is uh
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:48.320]  uh totally um uh unresponsive to the facts that i've just described president obama threatened
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:54.080]  to veto the bill as long as it contained the section concerning due process and then quickly
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:53:00.640]  changed his mind before the final version was voted through congress obama then told the media
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:06.560]  that the version he had signed was revised to eliminate any threat to freedom of american
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:13.120]  citizens even though this was not true and the bill gives extraordinary powers to detain american
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:20.320]  citizens without a trial the media synthesized obama's lie by claiming that obama will not
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:28.880]  use the powers he now has the desired result is synthesized by mainstream media as they turn a
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:35.840]  blind eye to the debate the american people cave into the lie because the process it is attached to
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:47.280]  seems so familiar john bown infowars nightly news
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:56.240]  to better understand the current state of modern day media manipulation we must first
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:03.520]  look at the father of propaganda edward bernays his influence on the 20th century rivaled that of
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:11.600]  his uncles sigman freud as bernays pioneered the idea of crowd psychology with freud psychoanalytical
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:21.680]  ideas in what would become a new political ideal on how to control the masses in his 1928 book
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:28.320]  propaganda bernays wrote if we understand the mechanisms and motives of the group mine it is
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:34.800]  now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without them knowing it
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:41.840]  he called it the engineering of consent and proposed that those who manipulate this unseen
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:48.000]  mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:55.200]  country it was bernays who introduced the corporate giants to crowd psychology methods
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:01.600]  and polish techniques to manipulate society he convinced the population to buy on impulse
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:07.680]  things they didn't even need by linking mass produced goods to their own unconscious desires
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:19.840]  the tobacco industry hired bernays to persuade women to take up smoking and the alcoa aluminum
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:25.280]  company asked him to drive the campaign for the national fluoridation of our water supply
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:35.920]  a consumerist culture was born and the u.s. government took notice in addition to famous
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:42.240]  corporate giants bernays also began working for the federal government they adopted his technique
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:48.560]  of manufacturing ever present dangers and then maintaining a constant state of fear to give
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:56.480]  those in power greater control of what bernays called the mass mind edward bernays who's the
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:02.800]  father of modern advertising and propaganda he literally wrote the book propaganda joseph gerbils
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:08.800]  on record the nazi propaganda minister used a lot of his information and twisted it to his own
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:15.120]  designs bernays was the chief psychological warfare expert for more than 20 years advising the
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:20.800]  department of war he advised them to call it defense don't be honest anymore call the department
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:24.160]  of defense because you're actually going to run giant imperial slaughter operations

[01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:58.120]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:04.120]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:10.120]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:14.120]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:19.120]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:22.120]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:26.120]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:31.120]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:36.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
