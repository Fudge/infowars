[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show news analysis reports it's the Alex Jones
[00:18.000 --> 00:27.160]  show and now your host David Knight welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm
[00:27.160 --> 00:29.760]  David Knight and we have a lot of breaking news today and Alex is going
[00:29.760 --> 00:34.000]  to be joining us later in the show just to give you an overview of what's
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.760]  happening we're going to take a look at the reaction from the GOP to Trump's
[00:38.760 --> 00:43.640]  trans band and we're going to take a look at it from a standpoint of what it
[00:43.640 --> 00:47.960]  does it really take to be in the military what is happening with the
[00:47.960 --> 00:51.640]  health of veterans we're gonna take a look at something that hasn't gotten any
[00:51.640 --> 00:55.640]  traction at all for over a year we had a documentary that's been circulating
[00:55.640 --> 00:59.600]  around we've reported here at info wars.com it's talking about the effect
[00:59.600 --> 01:05.360]  of mandated experimental vaccines on the military nobody's talking about that
[01:05.360 --> 01:09.800]  meanwhile we get a bill that would offer medical marijuana to veterans in
[01:09.800 --> 01:13.760]  states where it is legal that got shut down very quickly by the GOP so they're
[01:13.760 --> 01:18.320]  not really concerned about the military's health but we also have a
[01:18.320 --> 01:23.120]  mission here and Trump was absolutely right it's not only a monetary issue but
[01:23.120 --> 01:27.240]  it is also a mission issue so we're gonna take a look at the reaction of the
[01:27.240 --> 01:32.040]  GOP and I think it's kind of interesting that as Trump is shutting this down on
[01:32.040 --> 01:36.880]  the trans side and I believe as I think the majority of Americans do that this
[01:36.880 --> 01:40.840]  is really a mental issue it's a personality issue that people need to
[01:40.840 --> 01:43.880]  deal with they don't need to come into the military with that kind of baggage
[01:43.880 --> 01:47.440]  we've got a mission to accomplish in the military and we don't need to have that
[01:47.440 --> 01:52.200]  kind of baggage meanwhile they're coming after Trump and saying he's nuts so you
[01:52.200 --> 01:55.880]  got Obama with a brand new rule tries to fill the military with corporate
[01:55.880 --> 02:01.480]  clingers who need to be sectioned 8 out of the military but then it's Trump who
[02:01.480 --> 02:06.240]  is crazy and so now they've got one of the psychiatric associations saying we
[02:06.240 --> 02:10.040]  need to ignore this ethical rule that was put in when Barry Goldwater was
[02:10.040 --> 02:14.200]  attacked politically when they accused him wrongfully and he want to suit
[02:14.200 --> 02:18.360]  against the individuals saying you can't diagnose somebody from watching them on
[02:18.360 --> 02:21.480]  television these are the kind of professionals we got to look at here
[02:21.480 --> 02:26.120]  meanwhile we have Foxconn moving to build a 10 billion dollar plant in
[02:26.120 --> 02:31.720]  Wisconsin they will employ up to 13,000 people they're gonna be making screens
[02:31.720 --> 02:36.800]  for iPhones among other things so that's a big when there a big problem that is
[02:36.800 --> 02:41.760]  coming down the pike as Britain has now joined France to say they're going to ban
[02:41.760 --> 02:47.520]  all internal combustion cars and vans and vehicles by 2040 you're just gonna
[02:47.520 --> 02:52.320]  be riding around in little remote control battery operated boxes and who's
[02:52.320 --> 02:56.360]  gonna have the remote the government they're going to follow everywhere that
[02:56.360 --> 03:00.480]  you go they're gonna control everywhere that you go that's the real issue folks
[03:00.480 --> 03:06.520]  it isn't so much what the engine is as it is who controls the engine and that's
[03:06.520 --> 03:10.440]  one of the reasons that they want that it's a very very deep issue they're
[03:10.440 --> 03:15.760]  going to get into as well we've got Jamie Johnson a performer who was
[03:15.760 --> 03:19.080]  scheduled to do a performance at the House of Blues that's kind of
[03:19.080 --> 03:23.920]  interesting that they would not allow concealed carry and he said well then I'm
[03:23.920 --> 03:27.480]  not gonna play your concert and they wouldn't give up on the rule and neither
[03:27.480 --> 03:33.200]  would he we don't want to give up folks on our fundamental rights and have them
[03:33.200 --> 03:38.520]  taken away and so good for him I don't know Jamie Johnson but I don't know his
[03:38.520 --> 03:41.160]  music but I want to give him a shout out for doing the right thing
[03:41.160 --> 03:45.840]  meanwhile Charlie guard after the UK has delayed and delayed and delayed and now
[03:45.840 --> 03:49.320]  they've said there's no hope for the 11th month old baby has a very rare
[03:49.320 --> 03:54.200]  medical condition and the hospitals who've looked at this the Vatican
[03:54.200 --> 03:59.280]  Hospital said well if he'd been released earlier out of the UK if they would have
[03:59.280 --> 04:03.080]  allowed him they kept him prisoner there and we've talked about this before it
[04:03.080 --> 04:06.720]  really goes down to authority doesn't it in the same way what we're just talking
[04:06.720 --> 04:11.320]  about with your movement and cars and your transportation they want to control
[04:11.320 --> 04:14.880]  everything and they want to take the place of the parents the UN convention
[04:14.880 --> 04:18.600]  on the rights of the child is a convention that has been ratified by
[04:18.600 --> 04:21.600]  every country in the world except for the United States that's why it's
[04:21.600 --> 04:24.640]  important for us to understand what happened to Charlie guard so we make
[04:24.640 --> 04:28.720]  sure that never gets ratified here so that the parents can express an opinion
[04:28.720 --> 04:32.960]  but the decisions will be made by others and so now they're deciding that he's
[04:32.960 --> 04:35.880]  not going to be allowed to go home even though the parents have offered to pay
[04:35.880 --> 04:41.280]  for it they would like to let their child die with them at home they said no
[04:41.280 --> 04:46.080]  and we're gonna take a look at the Bundy standoff I was there and the first
[04:46.080 --> 04:51.200]  person has been sentenced to 68 years I'm gonna tell you what an amazing
[04:51.200 --> 04:57.120]  miscarriage of justice and how they are rigging the judicial situation there
[04:57.120 --> 05:03.200]  unbelievable even for me and I'm very it's hard to tell it to show me something
[05:03.200 --> 05:06.800]  that makes me think that the government is even crazier than it is speaking with
[05:06.800 --> 05:10.120]  his military staff president Trump has banned transgenders from military
[05:10.120 --> 05:13.120]  citing disruptions in the service such as structural accommodations and
[05:13.120 --> 05:16.360]  increased costs as the primary reasons his decision stems from a long-standing
[05:16.360 --> 05:19.520]  controversy over whether the military should provide insurance for soldiers
[05:19.520 --> 05:22.600]  to transition from one gender to another in other news president Trump also
[05:22.600 --> 05:26.080]  publicly blasted his attorney general Jeff sessions for not replacing acting
[05:26.080 --> 05:29.360]  FBI director Andrew McCabe who's at the center controversy after his wife
[05:29.360 --> 05:33.320]  received 700,000 for her political campaign from Hillary Clinton McCabe was handling
[05:33.320 --> 05:36.600]  the FBI investigation into Clinton the president also blasted sessions on
[05:36.600 --> 05:40.040]  Tuesday for taking quote a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes so
[05:40.040 --> 05:43.280]  far sessions has focused more on ramping up civil asset forfeiture and
[05:43.280 --> 05:46.280]  prosecuting marijuana users and investigating Hillary Clinton CNN
[05:46.280 --> 05:49.560]  however has launched an investigation into media pioneer Matt Drudge the
[05:49.560 --> 05:51.960]  founder of the drudge report has been spending a lot of time at the White
[05:51.960 --> 05:55.000]  House which has forced establishment media to not only acknowledge his influence
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.200]  over Trump but also his role as the progress meter of the Trump agenda and
[05:58.200 --> 06:01.480]  how the drudge report represents middle America if Matt drudge is concerned
[06:01.480 --> 06:04.400]  about the progress Trump is making so should the president this is kid Daniels
[06:04.400 --> 06:09.800]  with info wars.com as most of you already know I am a voracious consumer of news
[06:09.800 --> 06:14.080]  and information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research
[06:14.080 --> 06:18.880]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[06:18.880 --> 06:23.440]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do
[06:23.440 --> 06:28.400]  today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they
[06:28.400 --> 06:33.240]  were hunting killing and then processing and so I set out to develop caveman but
[06:33.240 --> 06:38.680]  to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood
[06:38.680 --> 06:43.920]  ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time

[08:05.760 --> 08:22.040]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with David Knight
[09:35.760 --> 09:46.320]  alright and that was Hugh Bannister and he has played all the instruments and
[09:46.320 --> 09:51.880]  edited the video on our contest this is a $20,000 prize for cover song and this
[09:51.880 --> 09:57.800]  is our own version our audiences version of the cover song that they used
[09:57.800 --> 10:02.720]  from Super Deluxe making fun of Alex and of course Alex went back and did an
[10:02.720 --> 10:07.320]  edited version which showed how they had twisted what he had had to say and of
[10:07.320 --> 10:11.880]  course that's one of Saul Linsky's rules for radicals right you take somebody's
[10:11.880 --> 10:16.360]  words you twist them you ridicule them because it's the most effective way to
[10:16.360 --> 10:21.080]  destroy somebody as Saul Linsky said you can't really respond to it well we found
[10:21.080 --> 10:24.800]  a way to respond to it we come back with our own version of that and our
[10:24.800 --> 10:30.000]  audience and so that's a metal cover the John's Ivers song composition and we're
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.800]  gonna have some more of those coming up in the show for you I want to cover
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.120]  several different articles here because there's a lot of things that are coming
[10:37.120 --> 10:41.680]  out we've got Russian sanctions that are coming in again and of course I know as
[10:41.680 --> 10:45.520]  soon as you hear Russia your mind starts to shut down if you're like me
[10:45.520 --> 10:49.800]  because I am overloading on Russia but let's understand what's happening with
[10:49.800 --> 10:52.120]  this I talked about this on the nightly news the other night they're laying the
[10:52.120 --> 10:59.280]  foundation for a worldwide trade war we had Obama and Hillary Clinton and the
[10:59.280 --> 11:04.360]  Ukraine in Syria with regime change laying the foundation for a new Cold War
[11:04.360 --> 11:08.160]  and they got that and now it seems like they're even pushing even farther they
[11:08.160 --> 11:12.480]  would like to get a hot war going between the US and Russia but they're
[11:12.480 --> 11:18.280]  also now moving towards sanctions which are a prelude to a hot war and you have
[11:18.280 --> 11:21.280]  to understand that what they did to get the Republicans to come along they
[11:21.280 --> 11:26.560]  passed this almost unanimously it's 419 to 3 to do sanctions and to tie
[11:26.560 --> 11:30.200]  President Trump's hands to say you're not gonna be allowed to remove any of
[11:30.200 --> 11:33.520]  these sanctions and so what they did was their Democrats came in and said we want
[11:33.520 --> 11:38.680]  sanctions against Russia no surprise and they said and by the way we can put
[11:38.680 --> 11:43.200]  sanctions on Iran and on North Korea for you Republicans and so that's great
[11:43.200 --> 11:47.280]  we'll just put trade sanctions on everybody but then guess what the
[11:47.280 --> 11:54.440]  Russian sanctions are going to impact natural gas sales to Europe Europe
[11:54.440 --> 12:00.840]  doesn't like that and so the EU let leak a memo saying that within days they're
[12:00.840 --> 12:03.800]  going to enact trade sanctions against the US so we're gonna have everybody
[12:03.800 --> 12:10.200]  shutting down trade remember when the establishment neocon globalists were
[12:10.200 --> 12:14.040]  telling us that Donald Trump was going to start a worldwide trade war that
[12:14.040 --> 12:18.360]  Donald Trump was going to be a protectionist and now who is it it's the
[12:18.360 --> 12:21.960]  establishment Republicans the establishment Democrats the military
[12:21.960 --> 12:27.200]  industrial complexity forever war people who are pushing for a worldwide
[12:27.200 --> 12:32.400]  trade war that's the people who are doing this and you have to understand when
[12:32.400 --> 12:36.280]  we go back and look at what's going on with Syria it's a reminder when we look
[12:36.280 --> 12:41.680]  at this natural gas pipeline there were memos coming out and actually some
[12:41.680 --> 12:45.920]  statements from a German minister saying we will determine what the energy
[12:45.920 --> 12:49.800]  policy of Europe is going to be not the United States and we look at this map if
[12:49.800 --> 12:54.000]  you're watching this broadcast you can see there's two different pipelines one
[12:54.000 --> 13:01.640]  of them is coming from Iran and running up and over through Syria that is the
[13:01.640 --> 13:05.200]  one that the Russians and the Syrian government and the Iranians want oh
[13:05.200 --> 13:09.560]  they're on the other side from the people who want the one that's running
[13:09.560 --> 13:15.480]  from Qatar and up through Jordan and then through Turkey and into Europe you
[13:15.480 --> 13:20.320]  see it's always follow the money it's that pipeline there folks that's a big
[13:20.320 --> 13:24.560]  big part of it and of course there's other elements of this as well we've
[13:24.560 --> 13:30.800]  talked about the UN plan that was exposed back in 2000 nobody really talked
[13:30.800 --> 13:35.160]  about it much W&D focused on it with an article and you can see in that plan
[13:35.160 --> 13:39.080]  they're saying hey the birth rates are collapsing in the Western government and
[13:39.080 --> 13:43.080]  we have an aging population so we need to bring in millions and millions of
[13:43.080 --> 13:50.600]  people from the third world as we pointed out the nightly news they have the study
[13:50.600 --> 13:56.720]  that just came out this week showing that we've had over a 60% decline in 40
[13:56.720 --> 14:03.880]  years in terms of sperm mobility and effectiveness in the West not in
[14:03.880 --> 14:08.240]  developing countries it's all this time they were telling us this is just
[14:08.240 --> 14:13.880]  affluence and people are just delaying having children because of their career
[14:13.880 --> 14:16.560]  and that means that they can't have children as effectively so it's a
[14:16.560 --> 14:21.480]  social issue that is here no we've been saying all along and now there's a
[14:21.480 --> 14:27.800]  massive study that shows over 40 years more than 60% decline in sperm count
[14:27.800 --> 14:32.920]  and even if you're not planning on having children it increases the
[14:32.920 --> 14:37.320]  morbidity and mortality of males so this is an attack on men but it's an attack
[14:37.320 --> 14:43.880]  on men in the West and this isn't happening in South America in Asia in
[14:43.880 --> 14:48.160]  Africa where they're bringing in the replacements for us now they sold this
[14:48.160 --> 14:52.380]  back in 2000 saying you want your entitlement programs you want your
[14:52.380 --> 14:55.800]  social security so we're going to bring in all these people who don't have any
[14:55.800 --> 15:01.200]  connection to your society and we're sure they're going to pay massive taxes
[15:01.200 --> 15:06.040]  to provide your entitlement programs no that wasn't ever the case so security
[15:06.040 --> 15:09.800]  has been a lie since it was created by Bismarck they set the age of 65 because
[15:09.800 --> 15:13.240]  that was a life expectancy they didn't expect anybody to get it and now that
[15:13.240 --> 15:16.840]  people are living a little bit longer in some of these countries they're saying
[15:16.840 --> 15:20.440]  we got a we got an issue here we're going to be insolvent so we got to take
[15:20.440 --> 15:24.520]  down the benefits and we've got to raise the retirement age and so forth and
[15:24.520 --> 15:28.040]  we've got to flood your country with people from outside of it who will come
[15:28.040 --> 15:32.400]  in obviously as caretakers no they're coming not for freedom not because they
[15:32.400 --> 15:37.080]  like our culture or our system of law but because they said they want to live
[15:37.080 --> 15:42.480]  off of the welfare system meanwhile we have our wonderful Republicans are
[15:42.480 --> 15:47.160]  showing us again what hypocrites they are we had Eric Cantor remember this last
[15:47.160 --> 15:51.280]  week now we've had John Banner come out say Obamacare is not gonna pass not
[15:51.280 --> 15:55.800]  gonna pass never gonna happen we're not going to have repeal now we had Eric
[15:55.800 --> 15:59.320]  Cantor come out said you know we didn't really think it's gonna happen but if
[15:59.320 --> 16:03.480]  you've got that anger working for you you're gonna let it stay there and so
[16:03.480 --> 16:08.560]  it's like yeah we use that anger in the Tea Party to get elected and they go
[16:08.560 --> 16:13.440]  back to the 2013 when they had the defund Obamacare tour remember that they
[16:13.440 --> 16:19.840]  could have defunded it they had the house they could have defunded it by not
[16:19.840 --> 16:23.480]  appropriating the money and quite frankly they didn't appropriate all the
[16:23.480 --> 16:28.360]  money that was needed by Obamacare and so Obama stole it unconstitutionally from
[16:28.360 --> 16:34.160]  the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors the house sued them in court and they
[16:34.160 --> 16:40.040]  won the judge said no money has to be allocated from the house and so we had
[16:40.040 --> 16:45.080]  Eric Holder appeal it and it's going through the appeal process and the
[16:45.080 --> 16:50.640]  Justice Department under Attorney General Sessions could just let that go he
[16:50.640 --> 16:54.480]  could drop that appeal and that would stand and that would help to defund
[16:54.480 --> 16:58.080]  Obamacare but they're not gonna defund Obamacare and they're not going to vote
[16:58.080 --> 17:01.320]  to repeal it now even though they did it multiple times as we talked about
[17:01.320 --> 17:05.480]  before when they knew that it wasn't actually going to be taken away these
[17:05.480 --> 17:09.480]  are the Republicans that we can count on in Congress meanwhile 15 million people
[17:09.480 --> 17:14.160]  would opt out of Obamacare if they could two-thirds of Americans want Obamacare
[17:14.160 --> 17:20.680]  repeal and yet what they're saying is we have to be concerned about 20 million
[17:20.680 --> 17:24.480]  people that the Congressional Budget Office says are going to lose their
[17:24.480 --> 17:29.120]  health care that was never the metric it was never sold to us as universal
[17:29.120 --> 17:32.640]  health care it was sold to us as affordable health care remember it was
[17:32.640 --> 17:37.320]  the Affordable Care Act that was their official name affordable affordable
[17:37.320 --> 17:41.480]  we're going to make it more affordable we're going to bend the cost curve down
[17:41.480 --> 17:45.520]  remember all that rhetoric it was never about that it was about universal
[17:45.520 --> 17:48.640]  health care coverage it was about single-payer coverage it was about the
[17:48.640 --> 17:53.120]  government taking over all the decisions for your health care about having a
[17:53.120 --> 17:57.720]  health czar and the person of the Secretary of the Health and Human
[17:57.720 --> 18:04.000]  Services we shouldn't have Washington making our health care decisions we
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.160]  don't want that that is the key issue that is even a bigger issue than the
[18:09.160 --> 18:13.560]  mandates because you can change the level of mandates you can change what
[18:13.560 --> 18:17.880]  insurance is mandated or you can remove the mandates during one administration
[18:17.880 --> 18:21.480]  but then they'll get put right back on by the next administration if you leave a
[18:21.480 --> 18:26.000]  health czar in place that's why Obamacare needs to be repealed it's the
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.960]  structure that has to go and so the mandates actually flow out of this
[18:32.960 --> 18:38.040]  entire structure but it's the the way that you have turned over our health
[18:38.040 --> 18:42.720]  care to be managed by bureaucracy that needs to go and now even Jonathan
[18:42.720 --> 18:47.520]  Gruber remember the guy who said the he lied to the stupid Americans and he was
[18:47.520 --> 18:51.920]  the one who helped to get this through even he says the CBO is overestimating
[18:51.920 --> 18:56.560]  the impact of repealing the mandate one of the architects of Obamacare is
[18:56.560 --> 19:01.360]  saying that but that never was the issue the issue was always affordability and
[19:01.360 --> 19:04.800]  you and I both know the only way that you're gonna make health care more
[19:04.800 --> 19:10.440]  affordable is to make it more of a free marketplace if we had a free marketplace
[19:10.440 --> 19:13.480]  and health care it would be a very different world it's not the free
[19:13.480 --> 19:18.280]  market is not the problem the free market hasn't been tried in our lifetimes
[19:18.280 --> 19:23.120]  going back to World War two when they instituted third-party health insurance
[19:23.120 --> 19:27.920]  and said that only corporations could get a deduction not individuals that is
[19:27.920 --> 19:32.200]  where this all began I want to take a real quick look though before I get into
[19:32.200 --> 19:35.000]  some of the other issues that are happening in Washington I want to take
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.040]  a look at how the GOP is are now the tip of the spear coming after Donald Trump
[19:40.040 --> 19:45.000]  on the transgender ban but I also want to talk about what's going on in the
[19:45.000 --> 19:50.080]  Nevada standoff trial what happened at Bunkerville I was there reporting and
[19:50.080 --> 19:55.400]  I've got to tell you this is something I feel very very strongly about and you
[19:55.400 --> 20:01.440]  will not believe what the judge is doing to this trial it surprises even me and
[20:01.440 --> 20:05.960]  very few people have a lower opinion of the government than I do stay with us

[24:28.320 --> 24:33.760]  coming up probably pay that in the next segment about Al Gore saying we have a
[24:33.760 --> 24:37.920]  challenging event that he believes is going to be happening soon he said let
[24:37.920 --> 24:41.480]  me get serious here for a moment because I guess he was talking about the
[24:41.480 --> 24:47.480]  climate change hoax with a comedy crew but he said let me get serious here I
[24:47.480 --> 24:51.280]  think the next few months maybe a little bit challenging for a country and we'd
[24:51.280 --> 24:55.520]  best gird ourselves for it this thing is not going well so we're gonna talk
[24:55.520 --> 24:59.240]  about that and talk about a new report that I heard on the way in this morning
[24:59.240 --> 25:03.600]  on the radio that is being sold to us by the government media saying the
[25:03.600 --> 25:07.680]  increase in force fires that we're seeing here and I don't know if there is
[25:07.680 --> 25:10.920]  an increase or they're certainly aren't getting bigger it's all about global
[25:10.920 --> 25:17.120]  warming oh really I've got some data that says otherwise about that but I want
[25:17.120 --> 25:21.720]  to talk about what's happening in Nevada with the bunkerville trials and this is
[25:21.720 --> 25:27.480]  reported by Reuters they've just had somebody who is there get 68 years in
[25:27.480 --> 25:33.280]  prison for being at the Nevada standoff I was there and I've got to tell you this
[25:33.280 --> 25:37.920]  is one of the most egregious miscarriages of justice that I've ever seen in my
[25:37.920 --> 25:42.560]  life having been at that event we were there a few days beforehand covering it
[25:42.560 --> 25:47.320]  we were there as they standoff was happening I was down there at the wash
[25:47.320 --> 25:53.920]  with the first few people I heard them threatening to shoot us and I saw people
[25:53.920 --> 25:59.200]  standing around most of them not armed some of them had weapons and holsters
[25:59.200 --> 26:03.600]  which is allowed in Nevada and if you look at that picture pull that picture up
[26:03.600 --> 26:07.520]  there again you look at that picture zoom in there more circle it with the
[26:07.520 --> 26:10.800]  mouse there right in front of that it's in front of that white flag in the
[26:10.800 --> 26:15.680]  shadow that's me I'm turning around shooting at the crowd I got tired of
[26:15.680 --> 26:21.200]  being threatened to be shot there was a Fox News man who was still there and he
[26:21.200 --> 26:25.000]  was afraid as well and he wanted to get over to the side where the government
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  was and he had his camera with him and he was trying to lift up he was lifting
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.120]  up his shirt that don't shoot Fox News don't shoot Fox News lifting up his shirt
[26:32.120 --> 26:35.520]  to show them that he didn't have any weapons or anything they kept threatening
[26:35.520 --> 26:39.200]  him and he never got all the way over there he stopped about a hundred feet
[26:39.200 --> 26:43.600]  away from them but he wanted to get to where the government was I wanted to
[26:43.600 --> 26:46.840]  see what was going to happen and we were staying there for quite a long time as
[26:46.840 --> 26:50.960]  the crowd began to build and it gradually started to inch forward inch forward in
[26:50.960 --> 26:55.840]  the whole time they're threatening us and at one point I just like you know I'm
[26:55.840 --> 26:59.520]  just tired of this I got in front of them and I started shooting and then
[26:59.520 --> 27:02.760]  that's when they all started to just walk after having stood there for a while
[27:02.760 --> 27:07.200]  because if you want to shoot me in the back like a bunch of cowards after you've
[27:07.200 --> 27:10.140]  been threatening to shoot us then go ahead and do it I've got a camera in my
[27:10.140 --> 27:14.400]  hand go ahead and shoot me in the back now these people that they're accusing
[27:14.400 --> 27:18.840]  this guy he had eight felony accounts he's 53 years old Gregory Brilson of
[27:18.840 --> 27:22.680]  Phoenix Arizona they found him guilty back in April now they've sentenced him
[27:22.680 --> 27:29.400]  to 68 years think about that 68 years how many years did Hilary Clinton get
[27:29.400 --> 27:35.400]  she didn't get 68 minutes in jail did she yeah one standard for them one
[27:35.400 --> 27:39.520]  standard to show that they can do whatever they want to to people and we
[27:39.520 --> 27:44.880]  cannot ever stand with our neighbors for their rights as there be take away they
[27:44.880 --> 27:48.440]  said he threatened and assaulted federal officers well no actually nobody was
[27:48.440 --> 27:52.320]  threatening them they had the megaphone they were threatening us and the assault
[27:52.320 --> 27:57.640]  is supposedly the fact that you're carrying legally a weapon in Nevada
[27:57.640 --> 28:01.000]  where it's legal obstruction of justice interstate travel in the aid of
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.120]  extortion and firearms offenses related to a crime of violence he was the first
[28:06.120 --> 28:10.600]  of 17 defendants and the Bundy revolt according to Reuters this is the way
[28:10.600 --> 28:14.760]  they put it to be tried convicted and sent to prison four others were granted
[28:14.760 --> 28:18.600]  a mistrial in April and being retried in Nevada two more groups of defendants
[28:18.600 --> 28:21.320]  including Bundy and his sons are scheduled to stand trial later this year
[28:21.320 --> 28:25.240]  and next I want to give you the other side of this from somebody that's actually
[28:25.240 --> 28:29.520]  there this is from the redoubt news and this is a situation where they have
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.200]  these are the rules that they have put on the defense attorneys they've told
[28:33.200 --> 28:36.520]  them the defense cannot discuss the videos of Margaret Houston being thrown
[28:36.520 --> 28:41.520]  to the ground or M and Bundy being tasered by the BLM they cannot discuss
[28:41.520 --> 28:44.840]  the First Amendment area that the government established to force people
[28:44.840 --> 28:49.280]  into you can't mention the arrest of Dave Bundy first or his subsequent
[28:49.280 --> 28:52.800]  treatment there is to be no mention of the Clark County Commissioner Tom
[28:52.800 --> 28:56.880]  Collins statements according to the judge no mention of that including folks
[28:56.880 --> 29:01.840]  from Utah he said were a bunch of inbred bastards that's his statement
[29:01.840 --> 29:05.360]  talking about the Mormons who came there and if we're coming to Clark
[29:05.360 --> 29:10.160]  County Nevada to support Clive and Bundy you better have funeral plans is what
[29:10.160 --> 29:13.760]  he said there's to be no mention of the BLM destroying Clive and Bundy's water
[29:13.760 --> 29:17.600]  tanks no videos of the massive military-style compound they set up for
[29:17.600 --> 29:22.520]  the operation no mention of federal cattle wrestling or the slaughter of his
[29:22.520 --> 29:27.160]  prized bulls that they then subsequently buried to try to hide their crime the
[29:27.160 --> 29:30.360]  jurors have not heard any of these instructions they don't let them know
[29:30.360 --> 29:35.840]  that the BLM is not to be talked about no mention of the misconduct of the BLM
[29:35.840 --> 29:40.000]  is to be allowed no mention of damn love the guy who ran this operation who is
[29:40.000 --> 29:45.560]  criticized by other BLM agents at his level saying what is this guy trying to
[29:45.560 --> 29:49.960]  do they are railroading these people this is an outrage you need to find out
[29:49.960 --> 29:53.240]  what's going on we're going to talk to people about this in a later day stay
[29:53.240 --> 29:58.760]  tuned and fours will be right back on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:58.760 --> 30:02.760]  and the GCN radio network
[30:05.560 --> 30:09.520]  after speaking with his military staff president Trump has banned transgenders
[30:09.520 --> 30:12.280]  from military citing disruptions in the service such as structural
[30:12.280 --> 30:16.040]  accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons its decision stems from
[30:16.040 --> 30:19.040]  a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide insurance
[30:19.040 --> 30:22.080]  for soldiers to transition from one gender to another in other news president
[30:22.080 --> 30:25.280]  Trump also publicly blasted his attorney general Jeff sessions for not
[30:25.280 --> 30:28.840]  replacing acting FBI director Andrew McCabe who's at the center controversy
[30:28.840 --> 30:32.480]  after his wife received 700,000 for her political campaign from Hillary Clinton
[30:32.480 --> 30:35.760]  McCabe was handling the FBI investigation into Clinton the president also
[30:35.760 --> 30:39.200]  blasted sessions on Tuesday for taking quote a very weak position on Hillary
[30:39.200 --> 30:42.680]  Clinton crimes so far sessions has focused more on ramping up civil asset
[30:42.680 --> 30:45.960]  forfeiture and prosecuting marijuana users and investigating Hillary Clinton
[30:45.960 --> 30:49.520]  CNN however has launched an investigation into media pioneer Matt Drudge
[30:49.520 --> 30:52.280]  the founder of the Drudge report has been spending a lot of time at the White House
[30:52.280 --> 30:55.160]  which has forced establishment media to not only acknowledge his influence over
[30:55.160 --> 30:58.440]  Trump but also his role as the progress meter of the Trump agenda and how the
[30:58.440 --> 31:01.720]  drug report represents middle America if Matt Drudge is concerned about the
[31:01.720 --> 31:04.920]  progress Trump is making so should the president this is Kit Daniels with info

[32:17.560 --> 32:21.880]  IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[32:21.880 --> 32:25.960]  and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they
[32:25.960 --> 32:30.280]  took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima

[33:17.720 --> 33:25.800]  and now your host David Knight welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this
[33:25.800 --> 33:31.000]  Thursday July 27th 2017 we had Alex Jones is gonna be joining us in just a
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.120]  moment to talk about Al Gore's cryptic comments on the late late show last
[33:36.120 --> 33:41.360]  night so yet another example of somebody saying hey in the next few months
[33:41.360 --> 33:44.560]  something's gonna happen you better get ready for something that's going to
[33:44.560 --> 33:47.640]  happen so we're gonna play that clip Alex is gonna break that down for you I
[33:47.640 --> 33:53.400]  thought it was kind of interesting that the storm that has been triggered as the
[33:53.400 --> 33:57.720]  hill points out Trump triggers a storm with the transgender ban the people who
[33:57.720 --> 34:02.680]  are coming after him apparently the most are conservatives what a surprise the
[34:02.680 --> 34:08.160]  same GOP the duplicitous GOP that said things like we're gonna get rid of
[34:08.160 --> 34:11.240]  Obamacare I remember when they said we're gonna get rid of the Department of
[34:11.240 --> 34:14.800]  Education right after Jimmy Carter did it so they campaign on these things to get
[34:14.800 --> 34:19.720]  elected for them but they want the government controlling your life we had
[34:19.720 --> 34:22.960]  Eric Cantor yesterday saying well you got a lot of anger out there you're gonna
[34:22.960 --> 34:26.720]  use that to get elected and that's precisely what they did now they have an
[34:26.720 --> 34:32.200]  opportunity to simply repeal it to start enacting market reforms that would
[34:32.200 --> 34:35.480]  actually make health care more affordable but they don't do it and so now
[34:35.480 --> 34:39.400]  you've got the conservatives a CNN's headline says conservatives lobbied the
[34:39.400 --> 34:43.880]  White House for a transgender policy but the total ban wasn't what they asked
[34:43.880 --> 34:48.400]  for they're very concerned about it and as they say it's a growing GOP backlash
[34:48.400 --> 34:51.840]  they say it's a political miscalculation well who was it that made the political
[34:51.840 --> 34:56.120]  calculation the Washington Post quotes John McCain and listen to the way the
[34:56.120 --> 34:59.840]  Washington Post describes John McCain war hero John McCain the preeminent
[34:59.840 --> 35:04.840]  Republican voice on national security not the leader of the military industrial
[35:04.840 --> 35:09.280]  complex but then we have people like Orrin Hatch from conservative Utah coming
[35:09.280 --> 35:12.600]  out and saying I don't think we should be discriminating against anyone well
[35:12.600 --> 35:17.040]  let's understand the military has a mission you don't have a right to join
[35:17.040 --> 35:21.920]  the military you it's not an entitlement program there are certain
[35:21.920 --> 35:27.880]  conditions as a matter of fact I had Daria give me a book here from military
[35:27.880 --> 35:31.200]  dot com talking about medical conditions that prevent you from joining the
[35:31.200 --> 35:34.960]  military these are physical conditions all kinds of things and domino organs
[35:34.960 --> 35:38.840]  and gastrointestinal systems dental you don't have the right kind of you got
[35:38.840 --> 35:43.520]  some dental problems you can't join ears hearing eyes so forth I had a friend
[35:43.520 --> 35:48.640]  who went to West Point he was kicked out at the last minute because they found a
[35:48.640 --> 35:53.440]  small ulcer in his stomach so you don't have a guarantee to do that and yet at
[35:53.440 --> 35:58.160]  the same time now we have the establishment coming after Donald
[35:58.160 --> 36:04.080]  Trump saying he needs to be examined remote control by people looking at him
[36:04.080 --> 36:07.440]  on television in violation of the Goldwater rule and we know why that was
[36:07.440 --> 36:10.720]  put in we have an article on info wars dot com talking about that that was put
[36:10.720 --> 36:15.400]  in because they came after Barry Goldwater made outrageous claims about
[36:15.400 --> 36:19.360]  him that he sued them for and won and they said it's unethical first to
[36:19.360 --> 36:23.240]  diagnose people's mental conditions by watching them on television now you've
[36:23.240 --> 36:27.040]  got all the news media from NPR CNN and others are all saying we need to
[36:27.040 --> 36:31.440]  overturn that rule so we can attack President Trump and Alex Jones is
[36:31.440 --> 36:35.000]  joining us right now it's not just coming after him mentally as it Alex
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.760]  are gonna possibly have some kind of a quick event that seems to be what Al Gore
[36:39.760 --> 36:44.960]  is talking about as well that's right David you're doing a fabulous job there
[36:44.960 --> 36:48.960]  Lee and Mac is joining us in the next hour then you're gonna be back in the
[36:48.960 --> 36:54.080]  third hour playing traffic cop with our interview with Spencer Pratt and Heidi
[36:54.080 --> 37:00.640]  Montag Montag getting into how reality TV is so fake and staged that's all
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.320]  coming up today David so thank you so much in fact I want to come back to you
[37:05.320 --> 37:08.920]  just briefly in a few minutes but I'm gonna let you get back to research and
[37:08.920 --> 37:13.320]  preparation till you co-host in the third hour but I do want to get your
[37:13.320 --> 37:19.800]  overall take about what we should do specifically dealing with the big issue
[37:19.800 --> 37:26.480]  that's on our plate that I'm gonna get into right now I told listeners three
[37:26.480 --> 37:33.120]  weeks ago on air that the decision had been made to kill President Trump the
[37:33.120 --> 37:37.960]  next few months that the decision had been made to violently remove him from
[37:37.960 --> 37:44.200]  office suddenly and I told you when he got elected I told you in January when
[37:44.200 --> 37:49.640]  he got inaugurated that the deep state is preparing a COG continuity of
[37:49.640 --> 37:54.400]  government smokescreen to claim he's controlled by foreign powers when
[37:54.400 --> 37:57.960]  they're the ones controlled by multinational foreign powers and that
[37:57.960 --> 38:03.000]  they would then try to remove him declare the last election null and void
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.600]  and hold a new election run by Homeland Security and the Democrats now we know
[38:08.600 --> 38:12.080]  all this because Obama signed an executive order to do just that and they
[38:12.080 --> 38:16.120]  talked about doing it during the interim when he was president elect before he was
[38:16.120 --> 38:21.040]  sworn in on January 20th there in Washington DC so we've seen the media
[38:21.040 --> 38:28.200]  preparing the ground preparing the mind for this and then starting about three
[38:28.200 --> 38:34.240]  and a half four weeks ago myself and many others began to get phone calls some
[38:34.240 --> 38:39.800]  of them from trusted sources you know inside the quote government saying
[38:39.800 --> 38:46.360]  look Trump's gonna get taken out that's just the way it is and everybody needs
[38:46.360 --> 38:49.760]  to just get on board with it even if you're a patriot this is just the way
[38:49.760 --> 38:54.320]  it is live to find another day live the long game take care of yourself to carry
[38:54.320 --> 38:57.720]  your family he's just gonna be removed and of course they're putting out as a
[38:57.720 --> 39:03.480]  sigh up to see who they can condition and scare into going along with it
[39:03.480 --> 39:07.560]  thinking they're on the winning team it's a huge psychological game they're
[39:07.560 --> 39:11.480]  the ones that lost the election they're the ones that got caught rigging the
[39:11.480 --> 39:14.320]  debates they're the ones that got caught in the wiki leaks committing all the
[39:14.320 --> 39:17.920]  crimes they're the ones getting caught selling out of the communist Chinese and
[39:17.920 --> 39:21.920]  selling out the Panama Canal and selling out our weapons systems to China and
[39:21.920 --> 39:27.120]  selling out nuclear reactors in North Korea they're the ones on every single
[39:27.120 --> 39:33.040]  front in every single way over and over and over again that are the dishonorable
[39:33.040 --> 39:35.560]  globalists that are discredited that are hated they're the ones with the
[39:35.560 --> 39:41.080]  illegal servers they're the ones who are becoming a minority party I don't mean
[39:41.080 --> 39:46.000]  minority as in minorities the media will spend that I mean a minority party in
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.760]  only a few areas of the country not even a real national party serving the
[39:51.760 --> 39:54.920]  Democrats had told us is going to happen to the Republicans because the
[39:54.920 --> 39:57.840]  establishment and got them to play along with the system and sell out their
[39:57.840 --> 40:03.040]  values and disenfranchise their voters and try to demoralize them is now
[40:03.040 --> 40:05.840]  happening to the Democrats because the libertarian movement took over the Tea
[40:05.840 --> 40:10.080]  Party we created it they tried to take it over but we really took them over and
[40:10.080 --> 40:13.800]  now there's a civil war in the Republican Party politically for the
[40:13.800 --> 40:17.040]  heart and soul of the country the Democrats are delusional basically out
[40:17.040 --> 40:21.840]  to pastor and the elites know they're in trouble they're busy evacuating to the
[40:21.840 --> 40:28.120]  Cook Islands and to Tasmania and to the Australian mainland and to Hawaii Hawaii
[40:28.120 --> 40:31.240]  where I'm sitting right now and I'm literally doing an investigation of
[40:31.240 --> 40:37.320]  Zuckerberg today just get that out there so you have to understand they're the
[40:37.320 --> 40:41.880]  ones that know 90% chance they're going down in their own internal documents
[40:41.880 --> 40:46.320]  they say globalism is collapsing five years ago I had analysts and people on
[40:46.320 --> 40:49.520]  ten years ago saying the EU was going to collapse things with devolved back to
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.960]  the Midwest back to the States back to Texas that DC was making itself obsolete
[40:53.960 --> 40:58.480]  and the decisions have been made by people who are actually patriotic to
[40:58.480 --> 41:02.440]  work towards that in the government and in major corporations so there's not
[41:02.440 --> 41:06.600]  just some monolithic new world order power structure here but just like they
[41:06.600 --> 41:10.400]  have the bots working overtime and they have the TV shows and the movies and the
[41:10.400 --> 41:15.000]  dramas and the fiction shows and the the fiction fiction fake news of CNN
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.200]  posing as reality telling you that patriots are losing telling you that
[41:19.200 --> 41:22.200]  world government's imminent telling you that Christians are bad telling you
[41:22.200 --> 41:27.600]  that the borders are open to Muslims and it's no big deal despite all that it's
[41:27.600 --> 41:32.520]  a facade but if we buy into the facade if we buy into the mirage if we buy into
[41:32.520 --> 41:37.040]  the delusion we buy into the fraud if we buy into the mind control they win
[41:37.040 --> 41:43.880]  that's all this is the world's ours if we want it but it's all a giant mind game
[41:43.880 --> 41:51.800]  so you notice going back almost a month ago I said that sort of get calls on a
[41:51.800 --> 41:54.920]  month ago and it ended about two weeks ago of different people saying Trump's
[41:54.920 --> 42:00.480]  basically gonna go and you better not say anything or do anything during the
[42:00.480 --> 42:04.640]  process of this because we're your friends we're just letting you know
[42:04.640 --> 42:11.280]  that's the way that cookie crumbles and then you start hearing the drums in
[42:11.280 --> 42:14.640]  establishment publications beating for that then you have a senior the
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.160]  evangelical pastor mr. Brown we all in your state who goes and meets with the
[42:18.160 --> 42:21.280]  president and then goes and meets with senior members of Congress and a senior
[42:21.280 --> 42:25.560]  member and he says they're floating the idea of a coup in the next month or so
[42:25.560 --> 42:30.960]  a violent overthrow of Trump a quick removal a
[42:30.960 --> 42:37.760]  immobilization of the president and this is gonna happen in the next month or
[42:37.760 --> 42:48.200]  two then you see three days after that happens clapper goes on national TV with
[42:48.200 --> 42:54.120]  Brennan and Brennan says we need to not wait for impeachment we need to
[42:54.120 --> 42:57.520]  suddenly remove him and it's coming and that's happening right now we need
[42:57.520 --> 43:02.760]  America to be bipartisan and not tear itself apart then Al Gore last night
[43:02.760 --> 43:07.640]  goes on the James Corden show on the late late show which shows what a loser he
[43:07.640 --> 43:11.600]  is he didn't go on the main show he's on the late late show with you like a half
[43:11.600 --> 43:15.720]  million viewers or whatever and he goes on there and this con man of NAFTA and
[43:15.720 --> 43:21.000]  get this con man of TPP this con man of all his garbage and carbon taxes and
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.840]  everything this con man that said polar bears couldn't swim and that carbon
[43:24.840 --> 43:29.400]  dioxide was going up and then by 2013 we'd be underwater in San Francisco and
[43:29.400 --> 43:33.240]  LA while he's buying mansions on the beach this guy that said the ice caps
[43:33.240 --> 43:39.000]  be totally melted by 2013 when they both gotten bigger especially Antarctica you've
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.600]  got all this happening and he says oh yeah you ask me about Trump something
[43:44.600 --> 43:48.600]  big is about to happen and you know things aren't going well something big is
[43:48.600 --> 43:53.520]  about to happen they're all out there running their mouths and they've got all
[43:53.520 --> 43:56.520]  these followers and all these weaklings and the same ones that thought Hillary
[43:56.520 --> 44:00.400]  was invincible and the same ones that thought they had America by the short
[44:00.400 --> 44:04.360]  hairs and they had their boot on our neck the same ones that never did
[44:04.360 --> 44:09.800]  anything in their lives but run their mouths those same cowards who had
[44:09.800 --> 44:14.440]  America in a trance metaphysically like a vampire that's got you in a trance
[44:14.440 --> 44:19.320]  while it sucks your blood don't know what to do now that we've got them by the
[44:19.320 --> 44:24.320]  throat and they're trying to convince themselves and convince us like ca in the
[44:24.320 --> 44:32.520]  jungle book with his eyes spinning going sleep sleep let us sexualize your
[44:32.520 --> 44:39.280]  children sleep let us open your borders to the Islamists sleep let us take your
[44:39.280 --> 44:45.040]  guns sleep almost every liberal I know is out taking firearms classes now that's
[44:45.040 --> 44:49.120]  the biggest buyers at gun shops from California to Texas the globalists are
[44:49.120 --> 44:53.480]  in freefall panic they don't know what to do their culture is dying people don't
[44:53.480 --> 44:57.200]  have confidence in them anymore they know the social compact has been broken by
[44:57.200 --> 45:01.520]  design and that socialism collectivism and crony capitalism delivers us to
[45:01.520 --> 45:10.640]  tyranny delivers us to impoverishment delivers us to the enslavement and they
[45:10.640 --> 45:15.560]  know so you've got Al Gore and all the kings horses and all the kings men and
[45:15.560 --> 45:21.320]  Brennan the Wahhabist Islamist the little jihadi all these people together
[45:21.320 --> 45:25.880]  and their big armies of cowards all clucking and screaming and running around
[45:25.880 --> 45:31.560]  like a bunch of chickens on PCP with their heads half cut off running off the
[45:31.560 --> 45:37.280]  edge of a cliff screaming that there is some kamikaze jihad against America and
[45:37.280 --> 45:40.920]  it doesn't matter what you do to Trump it doesn't matter what you do to me it
[45:40.920 --> 45:44.800]  doesn't matter as long as people understand we've gone from being way
[45:44.800 --> 45:49.480]  behind to devastating them and their world government system is is collapsing
[45:49.480 --> 45:54.280]  and their systems were big mega corporations are tax exempt and then
[45:54.280 --> 45:58.720]  they screw us over and raise our taxes a microcosm as Zuckerberg came to
[45:58.720 --> 46:02.480]  Kauai tried to run people off their land he's hated by everyone all over the
[46:02.480 --> 46:06.800]  island just because I've bashed him for years they'd love me all over the place
[46:06.800 --> 46:11.160]  there's a few liberals that don't and they're all freaked out don't know what
[46:11.160 --> 46:13.440]  to do when they see me there it's like they've seen the anti-Christ walking
[46:13.440 --> 46:18.800]  down the street because people are awake folks and they've chosen sides things
[46:18.800 --> 46:24.680]  are now polarized and so they can run around over and over and over and over
[46:24.680 --> 46:29.360]  and over again and cry on their god of big government and collectivism to save
[46:29.360 --> 46:35.600]  them but he won't deliver them it's like we use the story of Elijah yesterday
[46:35.600 --> 46:39.960]  when the priest are up there saying you know our God will make this mountain
[46:39.960 --> 46:43.520]  top catch on fire and then after they try all that Elijah has a dump bunch of
[46:43.520 --> 46:46.680]  water on it and just to prove the point and then the whole thing bursts in the
[46:46.680 --> 46:52.360]  fire these people are failures they know it they think by pulling down winners
[46:52.360 --> 46:57.040]  that will make them winners that's never the way it's worked so they are
[46:57.040 --> 47:02.240]  preparing and here's the big 64 trillion dollar question they aren't just
[47:02.240 --> 47:06.680]  preparing in secret now they aren't just doing little whisper campaigns they
[47:06.680 --> 47:10.320]  aren't just calling up all the cowards and all the cowards men and all the
[47:10.320 --> 47:16.960]  cowards wives and children and dogs and everything else they are just getting
[47:16.960 --> 47:21.360]  themselves hyped up in this existential deal even though they've still got the
[47:21.360 --> 47:25.400]  country by the short hairs in many ways even though they still got all the
[47:25.400 --> 47:29.160]  major money in real estate Trump is just taking full power away from them and
[47:29.160 --> 47:32.440]  saying we're gonna have some prosperity and some open bidding and we're not gonna
[47:32.440 --> 47:36.760]  have one-way streets so Hollywood the anti-Christian crowd can pee on America
[47:36.760 --> 47:40.840]  and feel powerful your little counting coups simulation rubbing America's face
[47:40.840 --> 47:45.760]  in the dirt rubbing in the manure your little ritual of of defacing America and
[47:45.760 --> 47:49.560]  vandalizing America and having your little you know little little little
[47:49.560 --> 47:55.840]  ritual over America that's coming to an end and it's that spirit they hate and
[47:55.840 --> 48:01.120]  so they are now on the warpath and this is good because it's drawing them all
[48:01.120 --> 48:04.760]  out and they're now because they're having to try to get their crews ready for
[48:04.760 --> 48:08.920]  this they try to get people ready to go kill the president and then come after
[48:08.920 --> 48:12.640]  everybody and so they wanted to all do it in secret get it all prepared with you
[48:12.640 --> 48:15.640]  and I've all exposed it so now we're gonna force them out of their rat holes
[48:15.640 --> 48:20.000]  and now they're out of the little rat holes Brennan and Clapper on TV
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.360]  organizing their coup with Wolf Blitzer who goes oh but you've got a peach
[48:24.360 --> 48:29.680]  him Congress or Blitzer scared you can't do that he knows what he's doing
[48:29.680 --> 48:34.640]  he's not siding his John Hancock to that we've got Blitzer and Brennan you got a
[48:34.640 --> 48:37.960]  kind of give them a little credit finally they're they're arrogantly when
[48:37.960 --> 48:41.480]  they're not saying shut your mouth the president watch your mouth they're up
[48:41.480 --> 48:45.860]  there like little meerkats up on a little sand hill it's on our body we're
[48:45.860 --> 48:51.600]  going we're going killing we big now we tough as if you're gonna play that out
[48:51.600 --> 49:00.040]  now with everybody watching this in 1963 this is crazy oh but don't worry I saw
[49:00.040 --> 49:05.760]  the polls out yesterday in CNN CNN's on their own polls again where they sample
[49:05.760 --> 49:09.000]  in these twenty something percent more points for Hillary in states that Trump
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.280]  won you know the purple states that were in between red and blue guess what
[49:14.280 --> 49:21.800]  ladies and gentlemen president Trump is underwater he's down in those states he
[49:21.800 --> 49:27.720]  was down 5 10 15 points on election night in your fake polls but again they
[49:27.720 --> 49:33.520]  use that same garbage the mind control of these fake polls so let's go ahead and
[49:33.520 --> 49:41.600]  play a clip of Al Gore last night this is Al Gore last night on TV again just
[49:41.600 --> 49:46.000]  putting it out you know something bad's about to happen to Trump he gonna do
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.720]  something bad gonna fall down hit his head gonna fall down on his little
[49:49.720 --> 49:58.240]  face II here it is I'm interested to know and this of course would never ever happen
[49:58.240 --> 50:02.160]  ever ever but let's just say imagine for a second that you are the vice president today right now
[50:02.160 --> 50:05.440]  and president Trump the door to the overlocking that you guys would tell me
[50:05.440 --> 50:09.880]  that he shouts hey I'm gonna fire out a tweet
[50:09.880 --> 50:28.920]  I would not go and I think the next few months maybe a little challenging for
[50:28.920 --> 50:38.400]  our country and we best ourselves for this thing is not going well so they
[50:38.400 --> 50:40.680]  make fun of the president how dare him directly communicate with the American
[50:40.680 --> 50:46.640]  people and then they talk about how well something big is about to happen things
[50:46.640 --> 50:50.400]  aren't going well that's right the same scam artists that work with Enron to
[50:50.400 --> 50:54.800]  create the carbon taxes and the smart meters and the electric cars and all
[50:54.800 --> 50:58.200]  the rest of it to screw us over the same guy that makes the money off the carbon
[50:58.200 --> 51:03.840]  taxes he's gonna stick to like a big bloated lying con man and float the
[51:03.840 --> 51:08.680]  end of the president a great president once said the nine most feared words in

[54:35.080 --> 54:39.920]  also open the phones up some specifically talk to listeners about what
[54:39.920 --> 54:46.800]  do we do what do we do when we have I really want people focused on this what
[54:46.800 --> 54:50.520]  do we do when they're openly shopping a coup against the president openly
[54:50.520 --> 54:54.320]  selling how it's normal how is the right thing to do they tried to get rid of the
[54:54.320 --> 54:58.120]  electors and stop him from being seated as president the electoral college they
[54:58.120 --> 55:01.600]  tried to block his nomination they stole the nomination from Sanders Sanders
[55:01.600 --> 55:06.680]  didn't fight it Trump did he's a fighter and now we all asked him to go there we
[55:06.680 --> 55:11.120]  asked him to do this he killed TPP he's worth it just for that killed the
[55:11.120 --> 55:14.720]  carbon tax three plus trillion the stock market I'm not gonna go over all the
[55:14.720 --> 55:19.560]  stuff he's done 69% reduction illegals coming across the morale of the
[55:19.560 --> 55:22.680]  military going back up trying to reorganize the VA actually doing
[55:22.680 --> 55:26.720]  something trying to get tax cuts trying to kill Obamacare that like it's his
[55:26.720 --> 55:29.760]  fault he had got rid of it in six months when they're the ones that wrote it took
[55:29.760 --> 55:33.520]  them two years to pass it of course the Republicans are the problem so I keep
[55:33.520 --> 55:36.240]  telling the idiot Democrats gonna love Trump you don't like Republican
[55:36.240 --> 55:40.320]  establishment Trump's a wrecking ball to these people those are facts though not
[55:40.320 --> 55:44.560]  getting your news from the nightly comedy shows that are really government
[55:44.560 --> 55:51.720]  psyops they admit in variety that the big PR foundations that that's who they
[55:51.720 --> 55:55.800]  are bunch of blue bloods who want to act powerful so they've all got little CIA
[55:55.800 --> 56:01.240]  you know name key cards and stuff they all write that crap for the nightly
[56:01.240 --> 56:04.160]  comedy shows and then what is it oh let's kill the president oh let's get
[56:04.160 --> 56:09.360]  Alec Jones oh Alec Jones this and that they're the enemy they hate you so
[56:09.360 --> 56:15.720]  bottom line what do we do they're openly saying coo of course Trump I finally
[56:15.720 --> 56:19.320]  remember Lindsey Graham it makes Trump look weak to try to get sessions to
[56:19.320 --> 56:25.440]  quit he needs a firing I'm sorry we need to find that it will go after them
[56:25.440 --> 56:30.720]  they're openly shopping a coup and killing the president it's it's over
[56:30.720 --> 56:35.160]  okay I don't want all this to happen they're about to start a civil war they're
[56:35.160 --> 56:38.400]  the ones that would you stabilize things they're the ones that keep pushing and
[56:38.400 --> 56:41.600]  pushing and are finding all these cop killing groups I mean these people are
[56:41.600 --> 56:44.720]  out of control David I'm gonna let you go get back and get your research going
[56:44.720 --> 56:48.040]  to be hosted the third hour again I'm here on a workcation I'm gonna go out
[56:48.040 --> 56:50.560]  check out some things here I've already been out of the missile range we're gonna
[56:50.560 --> 56:56.120]  air that tomorrow the ICBM base also the missile interceptor base just briefly
[56:56.120 --> 56:58.880]  I want you to speak to this some of the third hour when you come on I really want
[56:58.880 --> 57:03.840]  to get a report from you before we play the Spencer Pratt Heidi Montau interview
[57:03.840 --> 57:07.560]  people ask why would I do that with the quote has been whatever the whole point
[57:07.560 --> 57:11.080]  is it's about how reality TV's fake it's how it's all a joke it's how when they
[57:11.080 --> 57:16.360]  came on my show they got blackballed it's inside the whole fake system okay
[57:16.360 --> 57:19.920]  that's the that's we don't care about celebrities we said all day I ran into
[57:19.920 --> 57:24.080]  them they got destroyed after they were on my show admittedly and so it's it's
[57:24.080 --> 57:27.800]  interesting to talk to him I think Spencer is kind of a ding-dong we haven't
[57:27.800 --> 57:30.720]  been hanging out it's not a bromance like the media says I think he's a funny
[57:30.720 --> 57:34.360]  guy I think his wife's probably actually a nice lady but the point is is that
[57:34.360 --> 57:37.960]  that's what's going on but the media misrepresent what's happening though it's
[57:37.960 --> 57:40.640]  pretty powerful interview but but David just briefly I want you to really
[57:40.640 --> 57:44.160]  cogitate on this and come back in an hour when I'm gone an hour in 10 minutes
[57:44.160 --> 57:48.120]  what do we do to raise the alarm this is a big deal they're openly now
[57:48.120 --> 57:52.720]  confirming everything I've told people I'm not happy about that well Alex you
[57:52.720 --> 57:55.640]  know what when they're talking about and these are the headlines that we've got
[57:55.640 --> 57:59.200]  coming out from NPR and everything go ahead psychiatrist diagnose Donald
[57:59.200 --> 58:03.560]  Trump as you pointed out they're preparing the groundwork and they're
[58:03.560 --> 58:08.120]  coming out it's predictive programming for them or trying to move the the
[58:08.120 --> 58:11.720]  Overton window here so people are going to accept some kind of an action against
[58:11.720 --> 58:15.000]  Donald Trump what I think Donald Trump needs to do is I think he needs to have
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.080]  more of these public meetings that we saw a couple of these just this last week
[58:19.080 --> 58:23.080]  again he goes out they addresses tens of thousands of people that's
[58:23.080 --> 58:27.920]  unprecedented and they can see then that the American public supports him and I
[58:27.920 --> 58:31.720]  think he also though needs to talk about his agenda and put pressure on those
[58:31.720 --> 58:37.320]  sellout Republicans David you just said it you just said it boom he's got to go
[58:37.320 --> 58:41.000]  public with all this he's got a rally the people and say he needs the support
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.600]  he's got to admit how much danger he's in and we're all in I didn't plug this

[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:45.000]  basically have got goosebumps 24 hours a day at least when I'm awake this is an
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.960]  unprecedented time to be alive we now have the former head of the CIA the
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.760]  same one that told Trump to watch his mouth saying that they're preparing a
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.160]  coup an overthrow of the president you have major publications saying the
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:03.400]  preparations have been made financial times of London Atlantic monthly you
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:08.160]  name it you have time and Newsweek and others calling for the president to be
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:14.840]  assassinated you've got Newsweek last week calling for my arrest saying why
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:19.400]  hasn't Alex Jones been arrested yet he's calling for violence when I'm not
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:24.440]  they're desperate because I know they're rats I know they're filth I know
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:30.200]  they're scum I just hosted the whole last hour and didn't plug because I get so
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.520]  focused on exposing this but a critical part of this is realizing
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.880]  historically where we are and what's happening now Al Gore's come out on the
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.600]  late late show instead of big events coming basically to remove Trump
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:46.160]  everybody has to get ready for it because they can't impeach and they don't
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.200]  have the numbers he has the American people support he's got to go public
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:55.200]  he's got to get out in more rallies he's got to point out not just fake news but
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.840]  he's got to point out to everybody that the deep state is making its move
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.720]  against the American people to overthrow our will and to break our will as I've
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:07.400]  said and now as Lou Dobbs and Colonel Schaefer and many others have said it is
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.160]  on it is happening this is real and we have to raise the alarm just like
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.360]  Pastor Brown who met with a senior a senior member Pastor Brown and with a
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.960]  senior member of Congress last week who said yes there's preparing martial law
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.520]  on the hill they're going around getting everybody ready for it saying you better

[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.600]  the after speaking with his military staff president Trump has banned
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.720]  transgenders from the military citing disruptions in the service such as
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.960]  structural accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons its
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.040]  decision stems from a long-standing controversy over whether the military
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.920]  should provide insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.200]  in other news president Trump also publicly blasted his attorney general
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.800]  Jeff sessions for not replacing acting FBI director Andrew McCabe who's at the
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.120]  center controversy after his wife received 700,000 for her political
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.480]  campaign from Hillary Clinton McCabe was handling the FBI investigation into
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:37.640]  Clinton the president also blasted sessions on Tuesday for taking quote a
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.160]  very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes so far sessions has focused more
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:44.600]  on ramping up civil asset for picture and prosecuting marijuana users and
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:48.080]  investigating Hillary Clinton CNN however has launched an investigation into
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.040]  media pioneer Matt drudge the founder of the drudge report has been spending a
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.800]  lot of time at the White House which has forced establishment media to not
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.160]  only knowledge is influence over Trump but also his role as a progress meter of
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.600]  the Trump agenda and how the drudge report represents middle America if Matt
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.520]  drudge is concerned about the progress Trump is making so should the president

[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:12.040]  voracious consumer of news and information and in the last four or
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.160]  five years doing more and more research I came across the fact that the elite
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.840]  establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.200]  cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.680]  sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:33.800]  processing and so I set out to develop caveman but to not just have
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:39.960]  concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood ingredients known

[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:44.760]  again I chose to do a family vacation a workcation here in Hawaii because
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:50.120]  Zuckerberg and hundreds of other top elite have been moving to Kauai the
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:58.320]  further most westerly part of the United States of America just 4,400 miles to
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:02.520]  the west of me I guess the East really begins and you've got North Korea with
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:07.080]  its missiles aimed at the United States I went and shot a report there at the
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:10.200]  missile range that we're gonna be airing here on the broadcast tomorrow
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:15.400]  coming up the next hour I did a 30 minute in-depth interview with Spencer
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:20.560]  Pratt and Heidi Montag of course who were had several hit reality TV shows
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.120]  and were some of the most hated people in America and I've always talked about
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.240]  the fact that I don't care about celebrities we don't seek out celebrities
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.200]  for the show I've turned down pretty big movie roles about bragging it's just a
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:36.120]  fact I've turned down a bunch of reality TV shows I was offered Ventura's show
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.320]  when he got sick of doing it because they wanted me to do Chewbacca brothers and
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:43.320]  space aliens and I mean I wouldn't do it either they couldn't believe when I
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:46.080]  wasn't interested but I've been offered a lot of other shows and I'm proud of
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.480]  the fact I've said no because they get you to basically do things you would
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:56.040]  normally do and reality TV is not really reality TV in fact I asked Spencer
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.960]  about that I say are there any reality TV shows that are really reality TV and
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:05.240]  he said yeah cops and those are real calls and real criminals which still I
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.200]  guarantee you stuff that embarrasses cops you know they're not putting in there
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.680]  you can believe that's been sanitized as well I can tell you this is reality
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:17.040]  there's no teleprompters here our guests are real we don't screen your calls we
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:23.760]  don't stage anything this is real fast-moving on target seat of our pants
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.920]  resistance to the globalist and that's why when I tell you there's a plan to
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.000]  overthrow the president and then you start seeing it major elite publications
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.320]  and now you got Al Gore you got Brennan the former house CIA all up on TV saying
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.640]  the president is about to be removed the next few months a big events coming I
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:47.160]  told you about three weeks ago the phone calls are going on to people saying
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.280]  listen sorry Trump's gonna be taken out that's the way it is and you better get
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:57.360]  in line we care about you Alex and you need to be in there for the long haul
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:03.120]  you need to not be too extreme something happens the president and again it's not
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:07.840]  said even all conspiratorial it said as a friendly thing how how's your family
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:13.520]  doing how your children how's your health we're really worried about your
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:18.240]  health I've had five or six of those phone calls and really that's other
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.200]  people hedging their bets so that groups listening to them think that they're on
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:28.520]  board but really most people aren't on board the people are playing along like
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:33.040]  they're on board and it's all a big sigh up did everybody intimidated and they've
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.720]  done that to my crew they've done that to my office you know they call it my
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.760]  crew and they spook them out and Alex is gonna get SWAT team next week or Alex
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:44.800]  is gonna get raided by this next week or next month never happens but the people
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:51.840]  that get freaked out by that and get sigh opt they never admit that they were
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:57.480]  wrong for the sigh up just like people that buy into Nigerian phone scams and
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.920]  you know $10,000 to the Nigerian Prince and then he wants 20,000 because they're
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:07.160]  gonna get their million they never admit it was a con game always oh Prince of
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:13.040]  Boo Boo there was a coup or he got locked up and then they even stay in
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:16.720]  contact with the Nigerian scammers on the phone and sometimes get scammed again
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:23.080]  and you can't help them just like CNN has new polls out that they admit are fake
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:29.520]  and they're in their system how they carry it out in their methodology some
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:33.600]  CNN polls have 30 plus percent points added for Hillary well now they're
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:40.240]  saying oh Trump's upside down in almost all the states that were purple like
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:46.400]  Pennsylvania the states where he was you know only behind 10 points when he won
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:53.000]  he was behind the day you won in the polls but notice they didn't use all the
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.440]  fake polls for five six months because they knew you remembered them now they've
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.560]  come back with the fake polls I like Brian Williams a year after he gets caught
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.600]  doing fake news saying was shot down by an RPG and helicopter he's back doing
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:11.880]  expose on me on fake news and then saying things I never said playing edited
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:18.320]  clips the king of fake news the standard of fake news Katie Couric got caught
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:23.120]  editing interviews got sued over it editing them deceptively make people
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:30.600]  look dumb and then did she stop no she still does all that did it did it stop
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.960]  Megan Kelly you know she knew I was probably recording her no she didn't
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:40.440]  hear she did it stuff 20 minutes apart an hour apart totally different subjects
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:49.320]  I said on the video I believe Sandy Hook happened just to end their whole
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:54.520]  propaganda operation and they wouldn't I knew it too they wouldn't put it in the
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.160]  show because they want to continue that narrative they think they're beating me
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:05.800]  over the head with but you get to hear the audio and her viewership continues
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:09.760]  to plunge in her key demographics she's less than 2 million and the other
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.520]  demographic it's about a million but she's down to 3 million went before she
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.720]  took the show over it was at 10 million but they had huffington post articles
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.000]  just a saying I got it all wrong
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.480]  they're having a post articles saying Jones is wrong about her ratings plunge
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.120]  when she took over it was 6 million and she still has 3 million no look at those
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.360]  demographics a few months before she took it over it was at 10 million then
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:40.000]  she takes it over it's at 6 million yeah it drops from the shows before when she
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.640]  first comes on it drops from 10 to 6 but they're saying when she started you only
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.600]  measure the drop from there down but no when she came on people tuned out you
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.160]  have to count the first show goes from 10 million to 6.7 or whatever it was
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:59.160]  down to now 2 million in her key demographics add all the others together
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.880]  maybe 3 million and then they act like I'm lying oh Jones put out fake news in
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:11.840]  his latest attack on Megan Kelly see how it works yeah she got just 2.71
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:17.000]  million total viewers but there's an article in the Huffington post yesterday
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:27.560]  saying I'm a liar she didn't drop to 2 million yeah yeah she did but see you
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:32.000]  don't care you just want to say I'm a liar and then hope everybody reads that
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.480]  and feels good about it but it's not working now they've announced a new
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:39.200]  comedy central show five nights a week where the host poses is me and then

[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:31.040]  1% seek another 1% Indian was 98% white that's the numbers according to the
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:40.600]  British Defense Ministry in 1943 in Operation Overlord and D-Day but
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:45.720]  they're saying it's racist because there's no black people or women in the
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:52.080]  invasion force or you know in the whole Dunkirk operation fleeing previous to
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:17:00.200]  D-Day this of course happened in 1941 so it's now completely racist ladies and
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:05.920]  gentlemen if in Dunkirk and the and the Ex-Mystery Force evacuating years
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.680]  before D-Day because there's new movies out about D-Day they're coming out so
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:13.480]  they're saying those are racist too so I'm kind of complaining to issues the
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:17.000]  point is it gets crazier Paul Watson put an article out a few days ago where in
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  the new BBC cartoons for kids it shows the typical British Roman family of 2000
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:31.480]  years ago and they're black and of course archaeologists say that England was
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:38.840]  99.9% white was maybe 2% Roman at the time but they were white and the point
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:44.400]  is it's okay if Africa was black 2000 years ago and it's okay if England was
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:48.160]  white but their rewriting history and they admitted xenophobic not to show
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:54.080]  Brits as black and now if you show Dunkirk a historical thing that happened
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:59.120]  and the people aren't quote minorities then it's racist so this is the total
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.000]  war on reality the war on history the war on everything and it's not being
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.200]  pushed by black people it's being pushed by the BBC and social engineers but
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.400]  like the BBC announced four years ago there's a hiring freeze on anybody who's
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:18.800]  white so again ladies and gentlemen the history now of Dunkirk and people
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.720]  fleeing the Nazis the British Expeditionary Force that is now racist so
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.520]  by alchemy people being killed by Nazis they're now the Nazis Leanne
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:33.080]  McAdoo great to have you with us it's great being here Alex it's just who
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.120]  needs accuracy when you're trying to give historical context I mean we can
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:42.240]  just see this massive push to rewrite history and to no wonder everyone is
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.320]  going mad these days when you have jackasses over at Comedy Central trying
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:52.280]  to say that the independent media is the problem oh it's 2017 and we've got
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:57.120]  this independent media trying to give people their fake news when we have
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.520]  literally over and over again exposed the establishment media as pushing fake
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.960]  news or like I want to get into in the next segment refusing to even talk
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:11.400]  about real news huge issues because it's going to rock the Democrats so they're
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:15.280]  just going to ignore these stories all together but then have their tagline be
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.640]  democracy dies in darkness so this is just really incredible what we're
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:24.280]  witnessing that just this total rewrite of history and then to call anyone who
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:31.200]  calls them out on their inaccuracy racist Nazis or what have you well I'm not
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:36.800]  taking anything away from North Africa or the history there but the Greek
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:43.240]  historians said that the first civilizations in Egypt were European and
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:47.560]  now they've done the DNA testing and they were now later Sub-Saharan Africans
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:51.200]  came into Egypt and that's what it phased into but it's not an attack on
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:56.960]  anybody that oh Plato was right wow he lived back then 2300 years ago that the
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:01.960]  first you know half of Egyptian history was one hair blue-eyed people it's like

[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.440]  Alex Jones your host Leanne McAdoo is riding shotgun with us we've got some
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.400]  really disturbing news one of the sons of G Gordon Liddy who's a deputy
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.920]  attorney general in California has been charged with having child pornography
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:48.840]  now I can tell you that just operation playpen and the whole playpen dark web
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:54.360]  website had 150,000 users many of them in the US so that's been part of this big
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:59.800]  roll-up that Trump's been orchestrating and I'm gonna I'm gonna research
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.600]  everything that's happened I'm gonna look into this guy I'm gonna look into
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.120]  what's happening but when somebody's being busted for having child porn when
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:11.080]  you've got all the people that actually are with kids getting caught with them
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.480]  in cages and then it comes out in the news that they find a bunch of kids in
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:18.000]  cages in California and then nothing happens you don't hear about where the
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.320]  kids went I asked what's happening so you know the big stuff gets covered up and
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:29.640]  then constantly we know at the Pentagon they would load child porn on the tens
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:34.520]  of thousands of people's computers to then blackmail them and control them so
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:37.120]  I'm not saying that's what happened here it should just be looked at not because
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:41.320]  he's G Gordon Liddy's son you know this this fits the pattern other powerful
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:45.360]  person you know who's who's reportedly involved in all this you may be guilty I
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:48.760]  don't know I'm just saying we see this pattern now big topic Leanne wants to
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:52.760]  get into and it's why I like to bring her on because I saw this last night in
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:57.080]  full wars.com it's a big story the Democrats are panicking over it
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:02.600]  Democrats panic over IT guy who got caught trying to reportedly flee the
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:08.320]  country also the attempted preparation for coup the leakers all of it so Leanne
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:12.960]  let's go over it well this is just basically a story if you if you ever
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:17.920]  wanted to know what is a huge story you just take a look at how it's not being
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:23.440]  covered especially by our so-called free and independent most important press
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:28.800]  like the New York Times they still have yet to report even one article on this
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:34.040]  house IT scandal that is now getting into months long investigation they
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:38.360]  still have yet to even report a single article on it same with the Wall Street
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:43.280]  Journal the Daily Caller is reporting that MSNBC ABC NBC News they've given
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:49.920]  zero on-air coverage to this topic CNN okay they gave it a little bit of
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:55.560]  coverage just a smidgen this morning at 6 a.m. and on their 6 a.m. Eastern
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.920]  broadcast so they can say oh well we did cover it how dare you say the
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:04.200]  establishment media yeah everyone in the country is asleep at that time not
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:09.040]  paying attention to this huge house IT scandal and now check this out so we've
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:14.680]  got the Washington Post who is the you know democracy dies in darkness they
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.600]  finally gave it a little bit of coverage yesterday and they're only
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.960]  pointing out how this congressional IT staffer has been charged with home
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:28.480]  equity loan fraud now this is what the FBI was able to stop Imran Awan on from
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.320]  boarding this flight they were able to get him on bank fraud so this might just
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:37.080]  be a placeholder charge for some other coming more serious charges but this was
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.160]  the one thing they had him on back and by the way we've been talking about all
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.440]  these guys and the people running the congressional servers who are from
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.880]  Pakistan and hooked him on the Democrats and with national security
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:51.120]  clearances when they didn't have clearances again everything they say
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:56.520]  Trump's done they've done in quadruplicate this is crazy segwaying in is it's
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:01.520]  surreal for you land to see Al Gore and Bren and everybody saying yeah we're
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.880]  getting ready to take Trump out get ready for it it's bipartisan everybody's
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:09.040]  just sit down and shut up well I mean I think that they're all kind of
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:12.720]  scrambling because they see when you have the House Judiciary Committee saying
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:17.200]  they're gonna go ahead and approve this effort to investigate Comey and Loretta
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:21.720]  Lynch and many other House players and look at some of these agreements that
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:26.280]  they made with Hillary Clinton's top aides to give them immunity get get in
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:31.040]  deeper with with this investigation that is huge this has a potential take a lot
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:36.680]  of people down so of course your your big swamp monsters are scrambling and
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:40.920]  they are going to do whatever they can to try and get Trump out if it's not by
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:46.360]  impeachment it might be by some other surprise as some people have alluded to
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:51.800]  something that's going to take him out of office very quickly there's a civil
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:55.880]  war in our country and Trump really does represent the good guys because he's
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:29:00.120]  trying to restore common sense he's trying to restore prosperity and this is
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.240]  really a war between those that are affected by hype and those that aren't
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:06.480]  but they've got this real whisper campaign going which now public that
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:09.400]  they're getting ready to take Trump out and everybody better go along with it if
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.440]  you go along with it they're not just going to take out the president and
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:16.000]  then leave everybody else alone everybody that plays along just like in the
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.120]  Russian Revolution the Bolsheviks only took Moscow at first took them two years
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.600]  to get outside the city but they got the military to turn in their weapons they
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.120]  got the leadership to do what they were told and by successive approximation
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:31.440]  bluffing everybody they got the whole country over a few years to then get
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.360]  under their control and then the red terror began let's talk about that
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:39.080]  straight ahead but thank god we got our second amendment folks this isn't going
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:43.520]  to be like what happened the poor serfs but the end of czarist Russia because
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:47.480]  the very same globalist players the very same new world order communists the
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:52.440]  very same devil worship fresh thinks they're gonna have their way with us
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:59.840]  and they're not the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:02.320]  network
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.560]  after speaking with his military staff president trump has banned transgenders
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.360]  from military citing disruptions in the service such as structural
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:14.960]  accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons its decision stems
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:17.680]  from a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.680]  insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another in other news
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:24.120]  president trump also publicly blasted his attorney general Jeff sessions for
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.800]  not replacing acting FBI director Andrew McCabe who's at the center controversy
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:31.480]  after his wife received 700,000 for her political campaign from Hillary Clinton
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:34.480]  the cable is handling the FBI investigation into Clinton the president
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:37.880]  also blasted sessions on Tuesday for taking quote a very weak position on
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:41.320]  Hillary Clinton crimes so far sessions has focused more on ramping up civil
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:44.360]  asset for picture and prosecuting marijuana users and investigating
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:48.040]  Hillary Clinton CNN however has launched an investigation into media pioneer Matt
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.880]  drudge the founder of the drudge report has been spending a lot of time at the
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.200]  White House which has forced establishment media to not only
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:56.360]  acknowledge his influence over Trump but also his role as a progress meter of
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:31:00.040]  the Trump agenda and how the drug report represents middle America if Matt drudge
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.960]  is concerned about the progress Trump is making so should the president this is
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:08.920]  kid Daniels with info wars.com they use their media to assassinate real news they
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:13.120]  use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler they
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:17.520]  use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:22.160]  their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex president to
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:27.360]  endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:32.880]  scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:37.720]  cars shut down interstates and airports bully and terrorize the law abiding
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:43.120]  until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:48.480]  madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:54.440]  only way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:32:00.320]  fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth I'm the National
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:07.440]  Rifle Association of America and I'm freedoms safest place thousands of
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:11.960]  years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:17.080]  drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:22.920]  defense sixty years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:28.320]  bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:33.280]  there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:38.320]  into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:43.240]  accelerate our journey towards death I personally counter this onslaught with
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:50.200]  antroplex antroplex is designed with no organic concentrated herbs to create
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:55.400]  the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:59.680]  discover why and throw plexus turn so many heads today it's time for us to take
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:03.640]  our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at info wars life com with
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:32.760]  antroplex crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:39.400]  I saw here in America we're at a turning point tonight with forces now forming
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:43.280]  an alliance to try and remove President Trump from office it's that serious this
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:47.400]  is not a diversionary tactic this stuff is real here this cool this this silent
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:52.440]  cool that is taking place is real a soft cool is underway right here in the
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:57.240]  United States of America in an attempt to overturn November's election results
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:02.560]  and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office sinister forces
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:07.320]  quickly aligning and what is becoming now in my mind a clear and present
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:11.680]  danger as I got to go into the Congress and spend three hours from 9 30 in the
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:17.840]  evening to 12 30 a.m. was one of the senior ranking members of Congress and
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:21.960]  he told me and of course this is what I said on CBN but they cut it out but I'm
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:25.960]  gonna go public with this because we have to he said there is a plot on
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:30.720]  Capitol Hill to take the president out I said you mean by impeachment or by
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:35.640]  endowment he said no to take him out this is an effort to subvert the
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:40.440]  administration of President Donald Trump it is nothing less it is an effort by
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:45.280]  the deep state to roll over a duly elected president and a legitimate
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.680]  government and to to break the will of the American people the White House
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:53.680]  communication staff has to believe they are now at a state of war this is war
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:57.840]  there is called information operations information warfare I'm not
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:01.200]  overconfident I'm an underconfident Roger they're going to pull
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:06.080]  Obama's in for two months and now they're saying they want to unseat the
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:12.520]  elected president because he's a Russian agent and you've got the CIA in the
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:18.920]  middle of this with Obama saying we've got evidence they were involved there's
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:25.680]  really no way to overstate the unprecedented peril that this country
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:31.800]  and this world is in right now unprecedented with the CIA involved
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:36.120]  and electors getting ready to vote against Trump and all this other garbage
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:41.080]  I'm here to tell you under continuity of government systems if there really was
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:47.040]  someone put in by the Russians then the directives are to move to remove them
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:51.160]  this is the cover they need inside government to pretend they're a bunch
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:56.160]  of patriots and try to organize enough people out of agencies to make a move
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:02.040]  against Trump to remove him or even assassinate him it can go a lot of
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:06.400]  different ways they announced the electors aren't going for Trump next
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:09.960]  time he gets on board his plane it blows up and they'll just say it's a
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:13.240]  conspiracy theory we don't know why it blew up don't ask why it blew up that's
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:19.600]  that's how brazen they are because they want a riot they want a civil war then
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:23.760]  they can bring in their control because they can't win a peaceful information
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:29.920]  war you have a politicization of the agencies that is resulting in leaks from
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:35.160]  anonymous unknown people and the intention is to take down a president
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:39.960]  now this is this is very dangerous to America it's a threat to our republic
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:46.360]  it constitutes a clear and present danger to ours our way of life so we and
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:51.480]  clearly the other side the deep state and the Clinton folks and I have to say
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:56.320]  some folks on the on the Republican side are all lining up the battle lines
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:59.640]  are drawn and it's time for people to understand how to to deal with this as
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:04.000]  if it like it like it's a war government bureaucrats particularly within the
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.040]  intelligence community have launched a soft who aimed at the Trump
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:13.040]  administration you can read between the lines I said look I said that's not
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.800]  gonna happen he said he said well really there's nothing we can do to stop it I
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:22.000]  said we are gonna stop it because we're gonna mobilize the body of Christ to
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.120]  pray in the best description of it is by Barry Castleman in his blog where he
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:30.480]  said this is a coup d'etat he said 14 million citizens and private ballots
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:35.360]  picked Donald Trump 20 TV executives have decided to destroy him this is no
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:41.440]  longer about Republicans and Democrats conservatives and liberals this is about
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:48.680]  a full-on assault by the left the Democratic Party to absolutely carry
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:52.920]  out a coup d'etat against President Trump
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:04.120]  now ladies and gentlemen you notice that some of those clips are from 2016 of me
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:09.760]  saying they're gonna use COG they're gonna try to block his electors we've
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:13.720]  got to stop them and then Pelosi's daughter came out and said Alex Jones is
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.320]  death-threatening me I want him arrested I never say anything about her I said
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:20.840]  she's trying to have the electors turn she was saying she wasn't but then it
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:25.600]  came out she was everybody remembers them publicly doing it they just don't
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:29.440]  like it because I know they're playing and then we raise the alarm and then
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.200]  everybody from Lou Dobbs to Newt Yanrich to Rush Limbaugh to Sean Hannity then
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.960]  word-for-word uses my terms clear and present danger COG coup d'etat information
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.600]  warfare and now Al Gore comes out and now Brennan comes out and they say yeah
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:52.280]  we're doing a coup we're gonna overthrow him we're using COG again I've
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:55.720]  studied how this works it's not rocket science I know what the shadow
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:59.960]  government is it was set up under nuclear war threat and they're using that
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:04.640]  it's meant to save the country they're using it against it just like a COG was
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:08.440]  used against Hitler Operation Valkyrie well they're using the same thing now
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.000]  saying basically Trump's Hitler he's not so it's not rocket science that's what
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.800]  so frustrating is I really did the studying everybody else seems to pose
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:24.880]  and act like they know how politics and systems work so I've been hammering this
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:30.200]  for eight months now and we've already made it through a couple the hurdles just
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.800]  like they said he wouldn't get seated or he wouldn't get the nomination he
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:36.680]  wouldn't do this or he wouldn't do that now though they're frothing I want to go
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:40.400]  to Leigh Ann McAdoo who again wants to get into the subject it's great to have
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:45.720]  Leigh Ann McAdoo with us Leigh Ann what do we do what does Trump do because this
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:52.040]  is so over the top it's so surreal it's happening David made the point Trump's
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.240]  got to go public he's got a point out with her not just say fake news he's
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:40:00.400]  got to say they're saying overthrow me they're saying kill me he's got a his
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:03.440]  attorney general won't do anything I know why he's upset everybody's
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:07.200]  intimidated because they're going around threatening everybody saying you'll be
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:13.720]  okay sessions just sit on the sidelines of this and where are the men in this
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:20.080]  country I mean we they're openly organizing his overthrow and people are
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:24.760]  going well we better let them take over no they're illegitimate they're the
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:29.320]  criminals I mean this is such a no-brainer Leigh Ann McAdoo well this
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:33.680]  is why I don't really agree with tweeting out this stuff about the trans band
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:38.320]  because he he mentions that transgenders in the military are a distraction well
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:42.520]  if they weren't a distraction before it's definitely a huge distraction now
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:47.040]  because now the left and the media and all of the celebrities are just talking
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.420]  about this trans band and riling up their base even more at the same time we
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:57.040]  have all of these majorly important stories breaking that the media should
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:00.400]  be forced to cover well now they have an excuse to not cover it they have an
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:04.800]  excuse to not cover the coup they have an excuse to not cover why the Democrats
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:09.560]  blocked a key witness who was going to testify against fusion GPS and testify
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:17.120]  that this fusion GPS was set up to start a smear campaign against him and this
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:22.000]  vessel in the sky was one of the main players in it and they shut that down
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.720]  immediately before he was able to give his key testimony in this very high
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:32.400]  profile hearing so we're not hearing about this house it scandal that is
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.200]  gonna rock the Democrats if this was Donald Trump and his aides who had
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:42.840]  allowed a foreign body some foreign nationals to compromise Congress we
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:47.520]  would never be hearing the end of it but we aren't hearing about it at all and
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:52.040]  it's been going on for months and the Washington Post doesn't even get into it
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:57.640]  and explain to you why this person has been fired making military wear red
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:01.760]  high heels and turning it into social justice order stuff's wrong but I
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:06.000]  agree the president is above that and that should just be policy by the sec
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.040]  death obviously they want to have sex changes also the military just to
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.960]  confuse things and social engineering because they're bringing in the robots
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:16.200]  they're getting rid of the humans in 2025 it's already been announced a decade
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:19.640]  ago and they're right on schedule so that's what this is all about just
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:22.960]  sabotaging the normal human order we don't hate anybody for what they're
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:27.040]  like we understand the chemicalization of the program you know just like
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.680]  Omega man we don't we feel we understand what's happened to folks we
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:33.480]  understand they want to crucify us for trying to help them but expanding on
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:38.240]  this Lee and what is it like for you though because I'm not trying to tutor
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:41.040]  a horn but folks need to understand we're on target so we're talking about
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.800]  COG overthrow of the president they are now on TV everywhere getting their base
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:51.880]  ready for it and and phone calls I was getting three weeks ago are now public
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:56.480]  you know the same talking points of we need bipartisan he's gonna be removed
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:00.320]  it's gonna be the military just everybody except it they're actually
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:05.400]  trying to prepare everyone for a military coup in America this is just
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:11.440]  completely insane and your media and your celebrities are going to be a
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:16.520]  front-page news as they celebrate it as they celebrate the downfall of the
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:19.760]  Trump presidency it's something that they won't even investigate they won't
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:24.240]  even see where were these charges appropriate is there a deep-sake who
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:28.840]  will they even go on and educate these people on the deep state and why it is
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:35.480]  such a threat to our country it's the deep state that began to eat the country
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:40.120]  in 63 publicly coming out with Schumer saying Trump better watch it the
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:43.520]  intelligence community has seven ways it's sunny to get back at you and
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:47.920]  Brennan saying shut your mouth now he says we'll just kill you the arrogance
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:52.480]  we didn't elect these people I mean again this is everything the left always
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:56.440]  claimed they were against well no now because it's their deep state they want
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:02.200]  it right and they also know that they if they don't get Trump out fast or take
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.080]  him out in some way a lot of the corruption that went on the last eight
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:10.200]  years has the potential to be exposed right now if we have the right people
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:15.560]  who aren't afraid to go up against these swamp monsters if they know that they
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:21.160]  have the protection of the president and the power of the presidency behind
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:25.120]  them I think that they won't be as afraid to go after some of these really bad
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:29.520]  characters but these these are people who are potentially being blackmailed
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:35.560]  they might be being paid off for instance by these Pakistani IT guys who for
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:41.320]  whatever inexplicable reason continued to be paid at three times the rate of the
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:45.320]  average house IT staffer even though they never showed up for work they never
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:50.480]  called into the meetings they many many requests for computer repairs
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:55.280]  this is how the Democrats penetrated everything they allied themselves with
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.240]  foreign corporations foreign governments that's what the foundation is all
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:01.720]  about the Clinton Foundation to create her own separate State Department her
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:07.000]  own separate presidency even Atlantic Monthly even Esquire even New York
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  Times admitted you can search engine and that Hillary was co-president under
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.800]  Obama and created her own competing agenda that even competed with some of
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:20.160]  Obama's agenda so they only agreed on social stuff as a political diversion as
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:24.080]  you said that's literally those are real issues but for the elites it's a total
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:28.000]  distraction like she says in the WikiLeaks I can't stand my constituents I
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.240]  don't want it they always want more free stuff they're a bunch of basement
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:34.800]  dwellers with their parents baristas you know I mean she's sounded like the big
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:39.080]  you know billionaire right-winger because that's what she is and it's just
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:43.640]  this giant bipartisan screwjob and along comes Trump actually trying to stop
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:46.880]  it and they're panicking and they don't know what to do and that's why it's so
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:50.680]  sad the Republicans are fighting to keep Obamacare because they wrote it to screw
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:54.200]  people and these are the average Democratic constituent fighting for it
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:57.880]  when it's big insurance companies and big banks wanting to keep all that in
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:03.160]  place leon right well and as long as they can get their base mad about social
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:08.960]  justice issues they won't ever be upset or or call for a further investigation
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:14.920]  into the Obama administration's misdeeds and they totally broke protocol
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:19.640]  repeatedly in their investigation into Hillary Clinton why isn't anyone upset
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:25.200]  about that why are we having to beg for a judiciary committee to probe deeper
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:29.840]  into all of these issues surrounding the former attorney general or James Comey
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.720]  agreeing to call it a matter rather than an investigation and many many other
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:40.720]  things I mean this is this is a server the 12 million for the Morocco all of it
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:45.480]  let me throw this out too I see a talking point put out by the bots and put
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:49.360]  out by the Democratic Party and Mother Jones and and David Brock at media
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:54.560]  matters that oh look Trump's got a bunch of swamp creatures he fired all of the
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:58.360]  lobbyists that had been in the campaign he followed all of his promises had
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:04.040]  pants to it but of course he's going to get guides like Bannon who was with
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:09.040]  Goldman Sachs for media acquisition that's a very diverse big group and
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:13.160]  likes Karimucci and others what matters is that they execute getting us out of
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:17.000]  TPP that they execute getting us out of the carbon tax that they execute better
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.160]  deals to get jobs back here and know how to demolition globalism what matters
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:28.400]  is the fruit of the tree of course if Goldman Sachs runs almost everything and
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:32.000]  Trump's trying to pull from experts that know how to do it if I'm pulling it in
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.280]  my ship into a new harbor I want the local pilot to take me in what matters is
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:39.960]  what he delivers and how the elite are attacking him so the elite are attacking
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:44.240]  him and trying to kill him but also then telling us oh he's part of the elite it's
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:47.520]  just absolutely insane I want to tell the listeners something here that's really
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:53.320]  important we have run the biggest specials I keep saying the biggest
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:56.200]  specials ever because we just can't I keep doing more and more specials because

[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:15.640]  since we last had it info.com I'm sorry I'm sorry I had to interrupt you I can't
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:19.920]  believe the super female vitality is not one of our greatest sellers I take this
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:23.360]  up every single day I love it I probably shouldn't take it on air cuz I'm
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:26.280]  gonna do a plug but since you're gonna do it let's skip this break I'm gonna
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:31.960]  skip every day I take this every start over because I mean I want this
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:36.280]  testimonial because I mean I mean don't get too graphic but Leanne tell us what
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:41.960]  super female did for you well Alex I mean I this stuff makes me hot and that's
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:45.000]  why I'm glad I'm about to get off the show because I am going to have to go
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.280]  do a slow motion Baywatch Beach jog after I take this super female vitality it
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:54.880]  just I want to go for a jog but I want to do it with my hair blowing in the
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:59.560]  wind like super fabulous super feminine I don't know what I mean the herbs are
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:04.760]  that is specifically in this stuff how it reacts in the female body but it is
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:09.640]  intense and like I said when I first was single years ago when we first were
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:13.480]  getting this product I had to stop taking it it was a little I wasn't ready to be
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:17.320]  feeling those feelings out there in the world I was a little vulnerable for all
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:22.820]  of the for the men that were going wow why is that girl bring her own slow
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:26.920]  motion fan with her when she's walking around that's how you feel in the
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:31.680]  grocery store just like a breath of fresh air and I really love this stuff but I
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:36.200]  really shouldn't take it on air because it gets me pretty pumped up and folks
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:40.320]  we're not joking they make jokes at Gwyneth Paltrow sell some products of
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:43.920]  similar ingredients super female and they go why are they both selling the
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:50.440]  same thing on show on well because if these are the known herbs but the
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:56.880]  difference is and I'm not bashing Paltrow stuff ours isn't dried ours is
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:01.760]  freshly harvested and then it's cold pressed into an essential oil and then
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:06.360]  it's basically aged and that's why we run out of it so much because it's
[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:11.760]  produced by a group in Utah that's been making these for almost 70 years and
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:17.640]  then private labeled and developed for Dr. Group for us for sale and so that's
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:23.960]  why it's so good as it's cold pressed so it actually has all of the all of the
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:28.600]  different trace whatever it is that affects the body so I go ahead well
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:31.360]  it's just like when you do a juice fast as long as you get the cold pressed
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:36.600]  juices they stay super fresh for you know days if not weeks but I think it's
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:40.720]  really funny that Gwyneth Paltrow kind of just she didn't beat around the bush
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:47.480]  she just calls hers sex dust so if that gives you any indication of what our
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:52.560]  products you keep it as a family show so we've named it super female vitality
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:56.080]  super male vitality things like that but she just cuts right to the chase I
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:01.840]  thought that was hilarious once again with the the daily show was it that was
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:06.440]  giving us a plug I think it's just so funny well let's expand on that
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:12.320]  Steiner about five years ago came in and he's a big fitness guy and he
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:16.560]  knew I was kind of out of shape then he goes oh supplement oh super male yeah
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:20.240]  right you know mostly supplements are bull and I said he takes them home he was
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:23.840]  back a week later buying a case of it he said you say this is a workout
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:29.040]  stimulant and then you know for that he said no my wife went crazy on this this
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:33.720]  is incredible because in particular with women even the super male is that's
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:37.520]  where you see the effect but but we just have it as as you know basically for
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:42.680]  energy for stamina for feeling good that's really what it does so we don't
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:48.400]  sell it as an aphrodisiac but quite frankly that's that's that's what it's
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:52.560]  designed to do and again because it's cold pressed and concentrated over and
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:56.680]  over again in this patented process that's why it's so strong we sell a
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:54:01.240]  powdered version that's half the price anthroplex right now it's so discounted
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:05.080]  it's not at the price anthroplex is great it's even stronger it's it's it's
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:12.040]  organic it's dried herbs it's just not as active is what we believe but some
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:16.600]  people like anthroplex better so info or store.com thank you so much for the
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:21.120]  plug Leanne in any other products you've used that you like thanks for the
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:24.600]  super female I actually have about two bottles I'm gonna need to get some more
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:28.960]  so maybe now that they're 57% off is that what you said that's outrageous for
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:35.320]  that price and I love the B12 I need the B12 is it back in stock yes it's been
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:39.880]  sold out for a few months and seriously the media makes fun of this you die
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:43.240]  without vitamin C you die without vitamin B12 you die without iodine and
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:46.480]  the globalists all know this and they're all obsessed with this stuff and all we
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:50.080]  do is go out and look at all the mainline research about if kids don't
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:54.400]  get enough iodine they have a 15-point IQ reduction for the federal government
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:58.680]  I mean anybody can search engine that this is in our opinion and they treat
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:02.800]  us like we're evil when Bezos is the biggest seller of supplements in the
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:08.280]  world Jeff Bezos through Amazon and through Whole Foods basically has
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:12.480]  cornered the market and you go on to what they sell they sell the very best
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:16.600]  stuff to the very worst crap we don't sell any of the crap but but again we're
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:24.560]  evil for selling things that are documented absolutely Leanne shifting
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:29.240]  gears and it helps from the operation other stuff that's on your radar right
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:34.120]  now Leanne so much happening so much going on the so-called left panicking to
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:37.280]  me they're not even the left they're just mentally ill people I wouldn't call
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:40.680]  you right wing I wouldn't call me right wing we're just pro-prosperity they
[01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:44.280]  seem to be getting more and more frantic more and more insane saying you know the
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.600]  movie Dunkirk's racist because there's no black people you know in the Dunkirk
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:52.480]  evacuation from the Nazis well that's because there weren't you know now
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:57.360]  they're saying that the average Roman was black in BBC shows for kids what is
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:03.680]  going on here well they're just gearing up all this stuff to help justify this
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:08.080]  deep-sea coup against Trump I mean now that we've got this who is at the American
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:12.960]  Psychoanalytic Association they're now saying you know what it's okay for our
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:17.640]  members to come out and just go ahead and say how they feel about President
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:21.760]  Trump's mental health whereas in the past you could be sued for libel for
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:26.160]  coming out and saying someone isn't mentally fit to be the president well
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:30.840]  they said about Barry Goldwater which wasn't true in the 1960s election so
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:34.120]  they had to stop doing it they actually have a law in their own group of
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:38.600]  regulation they're not supposed to do it well these people needed to be treated
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:43.560]  for their Trump derangement syndrome because I seriously doubt these 58,000
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:47.600]  mental health practitioners who signed that online petition I doubt that
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:52.680]  they're just non-biased that I guarantee they didn't give tons of money to
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:56.320]  Hillary Clinton's campaign I bet you they're just these really good-hearted
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:00.480]  Americans who want want the best for the country when they put out this online
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:04.240]  petition I mean it's total crap and the fact that you can have all of these
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:09.840]  different groups now attacking the president and by virtue they're attacking
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:13.880]  the millions and millions of people who voted for the president by saying that
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:18.320]  we're all mentally unfit and that we're all racist and sexist and xenophobic and
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:24.680]  I'm sick and tired of it that literally this is everything they're
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:30.400]  bullies they're trying to dominate and terrorize people into submission and
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:33.440]  they're trying to overthrow the will the American people and they're not gonna
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:37.440]  stop with Trump we are taking the country back the globalists are throwing
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:41.280]  fits and we have such a strong beachhead we've got to stand with Trump
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:45.120]  stand with making America great again and expose these people and be public
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:48.960]  about it and we will break the will of the globalist but we are in a war of
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:54.240]  wills right now Leigh Ann absolutely and that's why I really needed to come back
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:58.240]  to Florida to help my mom help my grandma but I just saw everything going on and
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:01.800]  I couldn't I just can't sit back and watch as this goes on especially not
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:05.800]  when I'm speaking with my longtime friends here in Florida who are just
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:09.240]  caught up in a lot of this rhetoric because they only kind of tune into the
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:13.160]  media here and there so they're not really digesting anything they're just
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:18.440]  looking at your your headlines and the little blips but as long as CNN and
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:22.640]  these other outlets continue to repeat these lies again and again it's as if
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:27.080]  it's the truth and it is madness that's why we are seeing so many mental
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:33.720]  breakdowns here online and elsewhere that's right powerful information Lee
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:36.040]  and I want to come back to one more segment even before David Knight takes
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:40.760]  over we air the Spencer Pratt-Heidi Montag interview coming up I want to come
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:44.760]  back and talk about all these fake bots the virtual reality this Facebook and
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:48.760]  how they admit they're targeting leftist to basically keep them vulnerable we'll
[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:55.120]  be right back we'll show the Facebook article out of the australia.com today

[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:22.440]  the secret behind DNA force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients

[01:59:56.240 --> 02:00:20.200]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show he aligns himself with the truth and
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:31.240]  it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones America is
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:36.200]  on fire with awakening so is the world and it's populist movements everywhere
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:40.840]  it's not left-wing it's not right-wing it's populism and having countries that
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:45.160]  are based for the people and for their interest and the best system is free
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:50.000]  market with a social safety net but that is designed to be a launch pad for the
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:55.760]  baby birds not a prison you know I think I had it in my bag I lost it I don't know
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:59.440]  where it is I found one of these little buoys that goes on nets that's made out
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:07.000]  of pot metal and a hole got in it and it broke off the net and little shells got
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.400]  in little baby shells got in and grew until they were filling up the inside
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:15.760]  and couldn't get out the little hole and died and that's kind of what the planet
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:19.440]  is or are we just little spores that got in here and never get off of it and
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:25.600]  never develop and never see childhoods end we just get trapped in this small
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:31.800]  little fake biosphere and let the globalist use us as slaves and and and
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:36.320]  play God I I don't want that and maybe we can pull it up but it was it was in
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:42.960]  the Australian newspaper the Australian a few months ago it was Facebook
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:49.560]  targeting lonely and insecure but then when you actually read the documents that
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:53.080]  Facebook executives leaked I thought they were so bad they have algorithms and
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:58.200]  bots that poses their friends and try to keep you lonely and depressed and scared
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:03.280]  of nationalist populace so you stay in the little fake Botville where it's
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:07.960]  almost all fake bots being your friend telling you you did a good job telling
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:12.600]  you you're a good SJW there it is leaked documents Facebook conducted
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:19.760]  research to target and exploit lonely people think about that and they want
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:22.820]  to keep you there this is their whole plan and Hillary says it and I keep
[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:27.880]  hammering this because this is critical this is critical to get to understand
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:33.080]  most of bots attacking you on Facebook and Twitter 10 to 1 our bots most of
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:36.720]  Twitter attacks on Trump they don't let the positive tweets get up at the top
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:40.880]  they admit that they talk about taking his Twitter away like how dare the
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:44.680]  president have a Twitter he should come back with yeah how dare Roosevelt have
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:51.320]  fireside chats for an hour twice a week on the radio they fear him going
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:55.240]  direct to the people he must go direct you're gonna see more of that now with
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:59.840]  scaramucci but president Trump here's from you and he needs to speak out
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:03.920]  against the attempted coup land what do you make of the Botville and how Facebook
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:07.160]  and stuff is already a false reality we're on it because we're jacking into
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:12.240]  the matrix to get to the bubble heads but folks understand it really is an
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:17.680]  artificial system well and their fake reality has only just begun because we
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:22.880]  are just on the the tip with virtual reality we haven't even begun to let
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:27.160]  that be the mass market that that Facebook and other tech companies are
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:30.480]  believing and buying into that it's going to be where they can literally just
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:35.480]  strap us into headsets and we'll be plugged in all day to this virtual
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:41.120]  world while the real world if it's not a matrix is is going on around us and
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:45.720]  they're able to do whatever they want and rather than have to you know now we
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:49.120]  don't have to turn on the news in order to get this information it'll just be
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:53.920]  pumped at us non-stop and I can't believe that this is something that is
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:59.160]  really you know that they're really going for and that people don't see it
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:03.120]  coming that they don't already see how much our society has been changed just
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:07.920]  with cell phone usage and how we don't connect with our families anymore and
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:11.280]  our close friends how everyone is so distant from each other and then we
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:14.720]  wonder why we get so depressed and so sad and we don't have those strong
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:19.960]  family units which are the the main thing that would would you would want to
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:23.000]  stop the state from coming in and controlling your life if they would
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.880]  dare exactly tell you how to raise your children for instance and they say oh
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:29.520]  other people don't have a family so you can't have one now they're actually
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:33.480]  teaching that is we're being put into the matrix we're being drawn into the
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:37.600]  corporate gulag we're literally being put into a giant reeducation camp in
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:41.760]  their own words Hillary says we should make all the men go to fun camps and
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:45.560]  they want national compulsory service not in the military but in liberal
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:49.880]  brainwashing systems it's all being announced Lee and it's wonderful to have

[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:08.720]  with his military staff president Trump has banned transgenders from the
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:11.920]  military citing disruptions in the service such as structural accommodations
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:15.120]  and increased costs as the primary reasons his decision stems from a
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:18.000]  long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide insurance
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.040]  for soldiers to transition from one gender to another in other news president
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:24.200]  Trump also publicly blasted his attorney general Jeff sessions for not
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:27.760]  replacing acting FBI director Andrew McCabe who's at the center controversy
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:31.400]  after his wife received 700,000 for her political campaign from Hillary Clinton
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:34.440]  the cable is handling the FBI investigation into Clinton the president
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:37.840]  also blasted sessions on Tuesday for taking quote a very weak position on
[02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:41.280]  Hillary Clinton crimes so far sessions has focused more on ramping up civil
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:44.560]  acid forfeiture and prosecuting marijuana users and investigating Hillary

[02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:56.280]  knowledge is influenced over Trump but also his role as the progress meter of

[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:45.480]  info wars.com exclusive video reality TV stars expose how reality TV is fake
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:50.920]  good a thought now this is course is Daily Mail has picked up on this talking
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:55.600]  about how Spencer Pratt and a pregnant Heidi Montage run into Alex Jones on
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:59.720]  Hawaiian vacation we're gonna play that video for you here in excerpts and I
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:03.080]  gotta say it's it's not really something that I'm qualified to talk about so I'm
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:06.000]  gonna go this video here in just a moment because I haven't watched television
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:12.840]  folks since 1996 so 21 years and it's been a blessing not to be burdened with
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:16.560]  so-called reality TV I'm absolutely amazed the only time I ever see
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:21.240]  television is when we're traveling on vacation flip it on first of all I was
[02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:25.360]  amazed after not watching it for several years it just couldn't get it when we
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:29.400]  moved into a rural area we couldn't get television we had other things to do
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:33.720]  quite frankly and I had other ways to get news so I didn't need it for news and
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:36.600]  I certainly didn't find it entertaining I watch a lot of movies but I don't well
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:42.120]  watch television and I was really amazed at how much they were advertising
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:46.240]  pharmaceuticals but I was also amazed about this phenomenon of reality TV I
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:52.080]  just could not believe how banal and uninteresting it was but it seems to be
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:56.920]  some things very very popular and of course I think it's interesting too that
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:01.600]  one of the very first reality television shows was Big Brother in the UK I
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:06.360]  think that that has been very effective in terms of creating an environment where
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:10.440]  people want to get on social media and share everything about themselves
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:14.200]  because it somehow makes them feel like they're a star like they're a celebrity
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:19.080]  no you're simply under surveillance like the people in Big Brother so they put
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:23.160]  out this predictive programming to the audiences they make it fashionable
[02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:29.520]  because then they were going to give you the CIA funded Facebook and other issues
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:32.960]  so they could collect that metadata on you that's really what they're looking
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:36.920]  at folks it's not even what you're saying so much or your phone calls this
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:40.040]  really the metadata that they can collect so we're gonna talk about that but
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:43.920]  later on the show we're gonna talk about some things I do know about and of
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:48.920]  course part of this is this case that just came out with Debbie Wasserman
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:53.000]  Schultz showing the corruption and also the surveillance going on within the
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.400]  Democrats themselves and of course these guys who are running this operation
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:02.960]  getting paid fantastic sums of money these ghost employees that worked for
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:07.960]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz running the IT department they had access to all of
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:13.640]  these dozens of Democrat Congress members everything that they were sending
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:18.440]  out with email and of course this was happening as the DNC we later learned
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:23.360]  was hacking the election against Bernie Sanders were they getting stuff on these
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:26.360]  people as well to blackmail them because we know that these employees
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:32.600]  actually blackmailed their stepmother we have the actual indictment yes while
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:37.640]  the Democrats and their lawyers are saying that this is simply a case of
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:41.120]  misunderstanding with a mortgage that they took out and they're only being
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:45.200]  attacked because their Muslims know they tried to blackmail their Muslim
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:49.880]  stepmother and the person who's been following this at the Daily Caller has
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:53.840]  been laying this out it's probably about two dozen articles since February the
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:56.840]  fourth totally ignored by the mainstream media and there's another very
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:01.280]  important story that's being ignored by the mainstream media until they trumpet
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:06.320]  the fact that one of the protesters at the Bundy standoff I was there I was
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:11.520]  covering it one of the protesters there has now been sentenced to 68 years in
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:17.560]  prison for exercising his constitutional right to peacefully assemble to redress
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:22.360]  their grievances with government to carry firearms that were legal in the
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:27.960]  state of Nevada they merely carrying a firearm is not assault against a
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:31.800]  federal officer folks sorry it isn't so we're gonna tell their side of the
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:36.520]  story we're gonna tell how the judge is rigging this situation against the
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:40.800]  defendants because they're not getting their side of the case heard because you
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:44.440]  have a right on the Constitution to call witnesses in your defense to talk
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:48.360]  about what actually happened but they're being gagged there's a fence around
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:52.040]  what they're saying that's exactly like the fence that the BLM put up and we got
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:56.480]  there they had a little tiny area out in the middle of the wilderness with one
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:01.120]  of these plastic fences that they put up to control silt and it said first
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:06.200]  amendment area and somebody had and that was printed by the BLM professionally
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:11.040]  printed first amendment area and somebody had to put a handwritten sign
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:16.400]  there when we arrived said the first amendment is not an area so we're gonna
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:19.920]  talk about that as well but let's go to this report here this is Alex Jones
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:25.000]  talking to Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montog about the reality television show
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.440]  the hills and they're talking about how there is no such thing really as reality
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:41.080]  TV it's fake there they are we're here with Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt it
[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:44.080]  was about a decade ago that they first came on my broadcast because they were
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:47.720]  getting political speaking out against globalism back when that wasn't popular
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:52.120]  of course it is now and there was a firestorm thousands of news articles all
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:55.880]  the big tabloid shows demonizing them and right after that their show got
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:59.480]  cancelled but they didn't back off they're making America great again I guess
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:04.080]  proto politics and then I'm here in Hawaii on a vacation with my family and I
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:08.280]  run into them it's amazing and Heidi's pregnant it's very exciting so it's
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:13.360]  very fortuitous to run into you guys it is great to see you it's I mean obviously
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:18.360]  destiny and so it's it's great to see you and a lot has changed in ten years not
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:23.640]  only with us but the world so it's great to see you in person yeah last time we
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:28.960]  saw you we were you know super hated and now we're pretty irrelevant and now
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:34.200]  you're the most relevant hated person that we know and I would say you took
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:38.480]  our game and I was a little sad I was like man now he's super famous and
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:42.960]  everyone cares about what he's doing and nobody cares about Spidey anymore so we
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:48.360]  need our we need our juice back here well I mean to get serious you guys did
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:51.920]  get in trouble because the big crime for reality TV stars and you guys were out
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:55.960]  there at the top is to become political it's come out their secret societies in
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:01.040]  LA with thousands of movie stars in them who aren't even liberal or
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:04.120]  conservative they're just patriots like Kurt Russell said hey I just like
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:06.840]  George Washington the second amendment free market I don't want to live in
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:10.560]  North Korea you know second amendment you know rich people have bodyguards why
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:14.360]  can't the average person have a gun they even came after him for that or folks
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:17.920]  like Bruce Willis who I know is a listener for over a decade and he just
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:20.840]  came out and said both parties are controlled same folks people that killed
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:24.800]  JFK around the country today so you have to be a mega star like Clint Eastwood to
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:29.040]  even be able to be conservative in Hollywood anybody else trying to break
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:33.720]  through politically they gang up on and they destroy but it's it's good to be
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:37.400]  hated by the establishment the problem is if you're in reality TV they can kick
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:40.520]  you off so break down what happened as soon as you came on the show so we were
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:44.800]  chanting death to the New World Order about ten years ago after watching all
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:49.440]  your documentaries and then about a week later we are no longer on television
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:55.200]  and haven't had a consistent TV gig since then so if the New World Order is
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:00.040]  watching you know we still will not accept chips but you know we will take a
[02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:06.000]  gig in the established media because we have a baby we have some bills to pay so
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:11.720]  you know New World Order were available I never thought I would say this we'll
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:17.880]  take a check but no for real be careful what you say I'll tell you that much
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:21.720]  because yeah it's a hard balance because you want to be able to say how you
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:25.360]  feel and what's going on in the world and to be able to have a voice or just be
[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:28.400]  able to be a person within it but like you said with reality TV you're so
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:32.560]  disposable that we just were disposed of pretty quickly after that whole
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:36.640]  happened and then obviously I take some responsibility as well because I had
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:41.000]  surgery and certain things happen but it just got really crazy really fast and
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:46.640]  just such a height that it felt like out of our control in a lot of senses so we
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:50.720]  just like went into this really dark deep pit after that and had everything
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:56.240]  taken from us and kind of hit a low and then it's taken us years to like
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:00.560]  rebuild and re-establish our lives and figure out kind of how to move forward
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:05.560]  within the world that happened but I will say the black helicopters are real
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:10.400]  we definitely had multiple black helicopters hovering above our hill
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:16.040]  set with 30 witnesses like what's going on so people are like oh the crazy black
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:20.200]  helicopters is a real thing well that's done as a psychological operation
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:23.080]  but some of the FEMA groups and things so everybody talks about it and then
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:26.520]  you sound crazy it's kind of like famous writers that the establishment didn't
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:30.280]  like like Ernest Hemingway the FBI sort of breaking in his car breaking in his
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:33.480]  house messing with him and then when he said it was happening they said he was
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:37.360]  crazy trying to throw him in a loony bin and then he killed himself or they
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:41.120]  killed him the FBI so there's a lot of ways that they psychologically messed
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:44.920]  people because with reality TV especially they go out they find
[02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:49.240]  interesting people they make them stars the public then loves you gets addicted
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:53.320]  to watching you know the soap opera the train wreck whatever's happening the
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:56.320]  producers from folks I've talked to that have been involved in shows we talked
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:59.480]  to you about it encouraged them to have the train wrecks to have all the drama
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:03.200]  to have the problems but then it tends to become real get out of control and
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:06.520]  then as soon as they're done with you they flush you so they just take you use
[02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:11.200]  you to create an audience and then they attach their messages on to that and
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:14.640]  then as soon as you're not on message and being the puppet they want the
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:18.960]  puppeteers drop you that's 100% correct yeah absolutely and it's hard enough to
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:23.200]  just be a Christian in Hollywood I mean that's you know and it's like people
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:27.560]  dissect that and say things about that and I mean that's my whole life that's
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:31.640]  what I really care about in love and that's hard enough so to be able to
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:35.080]  speak just your mind in Hollywood that's what they say stay away from politics
[02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:38.040]  stay away from religion stay away from all these things it's just not something
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:42.080]  you want to get into so it's just a really hard balance being a person like
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:45.600]  you said with actors they're playing a role they can be a different character
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:49.600]  but when it's you and that's your role that's the rest of your life that people
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:55.360]  are setting you up with so it's very it's very challenging what's amazing is
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.800]  the production value that God gave us being of God and Christianity or you
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:01.920]  know believing in a higher power and then this amazing artwork that you know
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:05.560]  God's created we come out here and right on time this huge double Rambo forms it
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:09.200]  just it just disappeared but it was here folks we'll show you some shots of it
[02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:12.280]  actually we should just move to the left here we got a little rainbow still in
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:16.960]  the shot oh look right there there's still some left right there look at that

[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:40.080]  bad and people said all your conspiracy theorists then of course later they
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:43.640]  came on said no we're trying to destroy Alex Jones and this character is
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:47.040]  supposed to be him so they have fake newsrooms they put out fake news I have

[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:23.440]  watching the interview that Alex Jones had he ran into a couple of reality stars
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:28.360]  Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt of the Hills they talked about how they had
[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:32.960]  long been awake about the new world order global government and when they
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:35.400]  started talking about it they immediately got canceled but they also
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:40.040]  talk in this interview they expose how reality TV is absolutely fake so we're
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:42.640]  gonna go back to that interview in just a moment before we do real quickly I
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:47.360]  wouldn't remind you that we're getting very close to the end of July 27th we
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:51.720]  began a very big sale I think it's the biggest sale we've had since I've been
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:56.240]  here I've been here for five years free shipping store-wide massive discounts
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:00.640]  off of some of our most popular products we've got discounts up to 66% off
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:05.360]  retail and we're rotating through some of the sale products here because some of
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:09.440]  them were selling out and so we had to bring in some new products like silver
[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:14.520]  bullet now 66% off retail and this is going to be ending pretty soon but
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:17.880]  again free shipping store-wide let me give you an idea some of the discounts
[02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:22.000]  here we got our new product true-way protein now 25% off that's part of the
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:25.880]  introductory pricing as well as free shipping we also have a ultimate
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:31.200]  protein pack 25% off that includes caveman along with the true-way protein
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:36.800]  we also have a new flavor of caveman that's 25% off we have Prostigard 33%
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:42.280]  off we have DNA force 20% off and although that's a small percentage that
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:47.160]  is a big dollar savings because that is a very expensive supplement to produce
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:51.720]  very effective supplement so that's a big dollar savings but it's going to save
[02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:56.000]  you money on anything you want to try or buy that the info wars store with free
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:59.400]  shipping store-wide and that's not going to last very much longer this is
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:03.400]  going through the end of July we extended that independent sale that's
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:06.920]  what keeps us independent it's your support of info wars the products that
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:10.360]  you buy it keeps you independent of the food supply we're just talking about how

[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:56.760]  same time thank you so much for your support let's get back to that video
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:01.360]  the exclusive video reality TV stars talking to Alex Jones as he's on
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:07.840]  vacation in Hawaii and exposing the fakeness of reality TV they've picked me
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:10.960]  as a figure head of the Liberty moment and I think they can destroy me and that
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:14.440]  will intimidate other people to not then speak out like what happened to you
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:18.400]  guys but going back to 10 years ago you guys went from being loved to being
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:22.480]  demonized when you said we're Christians then they attacked you if memory
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:26.120]  serves me if I'm wrong then you said hey we're anti-globalist we're anti-
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:30.240]  microchip that took a lot of courage and then they totally demonize you what
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:33.480]  led you to start speaking out about your faith speaking out about the liberal
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:38.240]  bias in Hollywood and speaking out against the globalism in general I will
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:42.360]  say it was Heidi's music producer at the time shot out Steve Morales who was
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:46.240]  like you gotta tell the world Spidey you gotta tell he had all your
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:50.440]  documentaries and just got us so pumped up and you know once I get pumped up
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:55.000]  there's no going back so and your documentaries were just there was
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:00.680]  nothing like it 10 years ago so they get you very you know on yeah it felt like
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:04.960]  an awakening kind of is like oh my gosh is this possible that this is going on
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:10.000]  the world and I think people now just know reality TV and they know media and
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:13.280]  everyone's just more hip to the industry and editing and things like that but no
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:17.920]  one could even conceive anything like that 10 years ago it was what it was and
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:22.200]  now with fake news being such a thing and it's just it's a different world and
[02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:26.520]  it changed very quickly so I'm curious where you think the world's headed in
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:31.480]  10 years from now because we see you 10 years later so it's just that's a lot
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:35.520]  also speaking of fake news how does fake news work in your brain because I feel
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:39.640]  like you've been before it was called fake news that's what info words I feel
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:45.320]  like was was just going after all these you know manipulations of media so how
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:50.800]  does that play into your world now well CNN came out a year ago and said fake
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:54.680]  news it was a John Podesta Hillary term it's in the WikiLeaks they said call all
[02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:58.400]  opposition any corruption were involved in call it fake news whatever we're
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:02.240]  doing blame it on Trump blame on Alex Jones and so it was an admitted plan and
[02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:06.640]  so I actually have a host that works to me who had the site 15 years ago no more
[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:09.560]  fake news.com John Rabaport and that's what he's always called it as fake news
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:13.440]  now that they've been branded back now that we use that term back on them
[02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:17.440]  they're now saying please stop calling it fake news because now people are
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:20.960]  actually judging their stories and consciously thinking about the fact that
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:24.400]  yeah it's mainstream that's known to be the big liars they're the ones that
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:27.520]  lied about dead babies and incubators they're the guys that lied about WMDs in
[02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:31.120]  Iraq they're the guys that lied and said Obamacare was free you know they're the
[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:34.200]  people that have bodyguards but don't want us people to own guns so really
[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:39.160]  they jumped the shark in a big way and so I think it's destiny as you said that
[02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:43.240]  you guys said you were Christian and that actually you'll spoke out of the
[02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:47.080]  media that demonize you destroy you try to destroy you but who knows where you
[02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:49.840]  would have been if you'd stayed in your life you're listening to Alex Jones and
[02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:53.960]  he's talking to a couple of reality stars from the Hill about the fakeness of
[02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:58.840]  reality TV will be right back the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:02.400]  GCN radio network
[02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:09.480]  after speaking with his military staff President Trump has banned transgenders
[02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:12.240]  from military citing disruptions in the service such as structural
[02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:15.840]  accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons his decision stems
[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:18.560]  from a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide
[02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:21.600]  insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another in other news
[02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:25.040]  president Trump also publicly blasted his attorney general Jeff sessions for
[02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:28.720]  not replacing acting FBI director Andrew McCabe who's at the center controversy
[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:32.400]  after his wife received 700,000 for her political campaign from Hillary Clinton
[02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:35.400]  the cable is handling the FBI investigation into Clinton the president
[02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:38.800]  also blasted sessions on Tuesday for taking quote a very weak position on
[02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:42.240]  Hillary Clinton crimes so far sessions has focused more on ramping up civil
[02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:45.280]  asset for picture and prosecuting marijuana users and investigating
[02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:48.960]  Hillary Clinton CNN however has launched an investigation into media pioneer Matt
[02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:51.760]  drudge the founder of the drudge report has been spending a lot of time at the
[02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:54.000]  White House which has forced establishment media to not only
[02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:57.240]  acknowledge his influence over Trump but also his role as a progress meter of
[02:30:57.240 --> 02:31:00.680]  the Trump agenda and how the drudge report represents middle America if Matt
[02:31:00.680 --> 02:31:03.600]  drudge is concerned about the progress Trump is making so should the president
[02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:07.640]  this is kid Daniels with info wars.com it's not just our water we need to

[02:33:29.560 --> 02:33:33.160]  we've been listening to the interview that Alex Jones had with Heidi Montag and
[02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:37.800]  Spencer Pratt of the Hills they're staying at the same Hawaiian resort that
[02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:42.040]  Alex is and of course they began speaking out against globalism talking
[02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:46.680]  about how they were Christians and boom their show was taken off the air so
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:51.480]  they're talking to Alex about that and about the fakeness of reality TV here's
[02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:55.120]  that interview will continue this you destroy you try to destroy you but who
[02:33:55.120 --> 02:33:57.800]  knows where you would have been if you'd stayed in the meeting the last four or
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:01.560]  five six years you've got a rest now and I've actually seen you guys been back
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:05.000]  in the news you're doing some new things looking at some new shows so who knows
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:10.120]  you may emerge even stronger after you've been in the wilderness absolutely that's
[02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:14.720]  how it feels it feels like it was good to just have that time and to rest up and
[02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:18.280]  to reevaluate like our lives and our values and what is important so I am
[02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:22.520]  thankful for everything that's happened and I think that God definitely uses
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:27.560]  everything for good so I'm I'm ready to re emerge better than before and stronger
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:32.440]  and in a way more prepared way I came from Colorado small-town girl with you
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:34.520]  know I didn't grow up with money or anything I was very different than
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:38.760]  everyone else on that show so now I feel like I have a better head on my
[02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:43.560]  shoulders and a grasp and we could do it way better I will say when I saw you
[02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:46.960]  walking by the pool as the first time I was like oh my gosh my life is a
[02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:51.280]  computer simulation I'm in the matrix like it was like a real moment I was
[02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:56.680]  like whoa this isn't real because it was seeing you you know now everyone knows
[02:34:56.680 --> 02:35:00.840]  you we knew you and you were just like if you knew Alex Jones you were in like a
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:06.040]  secret clique you know so yeah like yeah like when I started buying crystals
[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:11.120]  it was so out there now it's trendy and everyone buys crystals so but to me it's
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:15.320]  hard because people you know I've been so hated and probably still am but seeing
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:20.160]  you now be probably ahead of me on the hate list trips me out because of
[02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:24.360]  editing because I know most of my hate is from editing so I wonder from your
[02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:28.160]  perspective how much of the hate that you feel you know is just from a bad
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:32.360]  edit versus things you're like okay you know there are things I've said that I
[02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:36.600]  you know I wish I hadn't said yeah and but there are things they're completely
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:41.840]  my words put in different situations so like I know from watching you for years
[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:45.960]  that you're not like I know people are gonna eat me alive for this but a bad
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:49.840]  guy but then people see this whole sandy hook spin that they have and they're
[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:53.360]  like he doesn't believe parents in the bait you know so and then even when I
[02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:56.120]  come out two three years ago and say I believe the kids did die they'll never
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:00.160]  play the clips they play edited clips that's what Megan Kelly did on Fox where
[02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:03.640]  I said you know Hillary has personally been responsible for killing kids in
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:08.840]  mass and then I said in Syria and in Libya and in Iraq and I showed mainstream
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:12.120]  news articles they edited like a two-minute talk where I said at the
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:15.680]  first at the end completely clear that I don't know this you know stuff about her
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:20.200]  and you know you know kids is real but I know this is real they edited that and
[02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:23.320]  then Megan Kelly told me that she promised I could expose that on the show
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:27.200]  and then she lied and obviously didn't do it and then edited probably five hours
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:31.120]  of interviews with her a total of 12 hours their cameras were there from 9 30
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:35.560]  in the morning till about 10 o'clock at night for the interview in about 9 50 so
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:41.120]  12 hours I let their cameras in and I'm in that 20 minute piece maybe two minutes
[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:45.240]  and it's edited in fact we can't even release the piece because we have all
[02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:48.880]  these hours recorded of audio because it takes so much time to find where on
[02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:52.920]  there with all the notes because I mean an hour and a half here they'll edit it
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:55.720]  together with something over here and he'd have a listen and find where it's
[02:36:55.720 --> 02:36:59.200]  totally two different subjects and they've edited together to make you
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:02.520]  sound like a monster because she's like why'd you say that about the kids you
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:05.040]  don't believe they died and you stalked the parents which I never did and I
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:10.240]  say well you know I said all that before it was in the news media and it
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:13.360]  sounds like I did it because I thought nobody was paying attention I said I
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:17.880]  came out and said kids probably did die before it was ever a controversy but
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:21.120]  then they actually go he went back and thought I was weak on the subject so they
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:24.720]  thought I'd apologize about it and so that's how they use the fact that my
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:27.200]  listeners were the ones that didn't believe it because they clearly use some
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:31.360]  green screens to you know maximize they had PR firms there they've been caught
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:34.240]  you'll see it and caught taking out locations I just said it should be
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:38.080]  investigated along the bunch of other people then they chose me and it's
[02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:42.280]  almost like I killed the kids now that's exactly because the negativity in my
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:45.960]  app mentions everything's when I said we're going on people are like he does
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:50.280]  there's a baby's this I'm like he's not like that's the branding they pick us
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:53.360]  well see because you guys were the Christian conservatives on the show so
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:56.960]  it ended up making you the most popular because they chose you to be the
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:38:01.560]  villains so see that's actually the good thing this system's so corrupt and
[02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:05.040]  falling apart now that this is the time to have it hate you it still hurts still
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:09.360]  has some effect but now you've got a voice to actually challenge it whereas
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:13.280]  you know ten years ago five years ago still alternative media Facebook
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:16.960]  mentions that didn't exist or Instagram or snapchat like now I feel like I
[02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:20.920]  finally all these people that are communicating with it's to them I don't
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:24.400]  have an edit I don't have like what they did to you and shot you up with bright
[02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:28.400]  lights making you look all sweaty and everything else another thing is people
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:31.080]  when you came on said all those people are publicity or blah blah blah I said
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:34.040]  listen they're gonna get heat doing this and I've talked to them you know off
[02:38:34.040 --> 02:38:36.680]  air they you know they're really in the fight the new order they've really seen
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:40.480]  the films and so I said say what you want about them they're actually taking a
[02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:43.360]  risk doing this that's the same thing with Trump people want to demonize Trump
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:47.320]  all day long that's the popular thing to do but I mean in reality he is just
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:50.400]  being the president he's actually returning power back to the country and
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:53.760]  that's why he's being demonized it's their fault for running Hillary where
[02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:57.400]  here's where do you fit in because I know I'm sure you say it on the site on
[02:38:57.400 --> 02:39:00.680]  the radio but what's the deal at the Russians fill me in where do they is
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:05.160]  this all what's your honest hundred percent take on this whole Russian thing
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:09.720]  if you go to DC or New York there are Russians and Chinese and people from
[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:13.720]  India people from Israel people from the UK people from France the EU people from
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:17.440]  the Vatican and people from Saudi Arabia there are PR people and lobbyists
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:22.360]  crawling out of the walls and so Russians are constantly throwing sex
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:27.360]  ops at you you know hot blondes yeah honey traps they're constantly but
[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:31.840]  they're like the subgroup the Russians about six seven years ago cut back on
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:36.160]  that and mainly you know you know just use information you know TV stuff but
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:39.800]  they're secondary players reorganizing their country the Communist Chinese have
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:43.200]  infiltrated every major company defense company they're transferring everything
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:46.080]  back they're in all our computer systems most our chips get made there with
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:51.160]  backdoors we put backdoors in them it's a total cyber infiltration AI system war
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:55.240]  so we're an AI war with China China's got massive acceleration war with
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:39:58.640]  genetic engineering probably even way ahead well we got it's totally insane
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:03.320]  chimeras and human animal hybrids you know just they had 20 years ago cows that
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:06.680]  create human milk they sell on the market in China and I mean here it's
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:11.040]  maybe in the news I mean it's just so advanced so Russia has fast missiles and
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:14.720]  said a lot of nukes I mean they are basically an old-world country that's
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:18.360]  basically third world in many areas and they're trying to reorganize they're
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:22.120]  seen as weak so the globalists are trying to overthrow it they want to put
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:25.320]  kind of a Hollywood social engineering thing to break the Russian will to get
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:28.520]  rid of their Christian roots because it's not compatible with globalism so
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:32.280]  Russia's crime is it got away from the very globalists that run our country the
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:36.400]  very Bolshevik corporate system Trump and their people are being illegally
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:41.040]  surveilled massively by Obama and so there's some basic Russian contacts by
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:44.560]  senator sessions that you know that was his job so they have the intercepts and
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:47.920]  say yeah you met a couple Russians here and there when that's totally normal and
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:52.080]  it's what senators do and of course Donald Jr. met to get dirt on Hillary
[02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:54.920]  they were getting dirt on Trump so that's what you do in opposition research
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:59.680]  so they take normal behavior and blow it up like it's this huge you know horrible
[02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:04.960]  thing a mountain out of a molehill 10% of teapot but then with Hillary they did
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:08.360]  it because 100 million out of Russian banks to her foundation 30 something
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:12.040]  million to get to uranium I mean she was meeting with Putin secretly and talked
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:15.400]  about being in his inner sanctum and you know these power man folks are all
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:18.400]  obsessed with Putin's he actually runs things he's actually in charge they're
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:21.760]  all kind of minions of like Henry Kissinger and Brzezinski and Rockefeller
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:24.640]  who are all dying so they're all looking for who their daddy is right now and
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:27.960]  they all secretly are obsessed with Putin because he took Russia away from
[02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:31.200]  them and it's their own country and so they hate him because he's reorganizing
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:35.040]  Russia it's gotten from its belly to its knees there's characters standing up
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:38.880]  they want to get America back on its belly with Trump we're actually you
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:41.640]  know basically body slamming the globalist right now we're actually
[02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:44.760]  standing erect right now you know we got a bunch of wounds from what they've done
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:47.800]  to us Trump's trying to patch those up right now getting our confidence up
[02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:52.640]  getting us with goals and promoting things that are basic Americana and so
[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:56.440]  they're panicking that's a long rant I want to ask you guys the secrets of
[02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:58.680]  reality TV because you guys are undoubtedly right up there with the
[02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:02.720]  Kardashians you know right up there with the biggest reality shows Jesse James
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:05.480]  you name it I'm actually Jesse James probably number one the Kardashians
[02:42:05.480 --> 02:42:08.360]  number two I mean I mean who knows you could I mean he kind of founded the
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:12.920]  modern genre but overall so much of reality TV folks I've talked to isn't
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:16.920]  real reality TV with Jesse James it was real he wouldn't do it anymore because
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:19.560]  it just got boring and they wanted to make it fake he wanted to just teach
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:22.800]  people how to make things you know not actually a certain you know act cool or
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:27.800]  whatever and I mean what would you guys like to do as a show be but but but a
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:31.600]  what are some of the secrets of reality TV I mean did they try to make you act
[02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:36.240]  bad did they try to make you guys make fools yourselves it's pretty much if you
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:40.760]  didn't do what the producers but pretty much if you didn't do what the
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:45.240]  producers wanted you to do you weren't getting paid and they just say oh you're
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:49.160]  not going to be on this episode so then you say oh I would like that huge paycheck
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:54.560]  what would you like me to say yeah and I think that once you came on and with
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:58.800]  Lauren it was like technically her show and so once I wasn't playing by those
[02:42:58.800 --> 02:43:03.640]  rules and the rule that they cast me by they decided to just change my entire
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:06.760]  character because I feel like season one I had a lot of people who were like
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:11.400]  supportive and happy and still everyone still text me I love you season one it's
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:15.920]  like but not much changed I mean after season one except editing I was still
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:20.120]  the same person I was just dating someone that the narrator didn't love so it
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:24.000]  definitely changed into this really challenging situation when it was
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.880]  something that was supposed to be fun so we saw kind of the dark side of the
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:33.760]  moon of reality TV I would say the wildest experience with reality TV is
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:38.000]  he you could be talking to one person about something and then once it edits
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.160]  that same line is put in a new sentence and you're talking to a different
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:46.520]  person so you know when Alex talks about being edited wrong and people are of
[02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:52.520]  course he's he's lying it's like now my oh no these editors are magicians so you
[02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:58.000]  know editing editing is the original fake news so as far as I'm concerned so
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:04.120]  besides this exciting baby coming October 19th I want to stay alive want to
[02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:10.640]  get back to being famous and rich that means joining a secret society I just
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:17.440]  get a just kidding mr. judge but it's not worth our souls at the end of the
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:19.840]  day so there's also a lot of fake secret societies that what he just used
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:22.680]  people seriously you guys have been in the top I wouldn't say you went to the
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:25.280]  bottom you guys are saying just as you got locked out of stuff because you
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:28.480]  weren't playing ball or speaking up for what you believed in that's why they
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:31.440]  demonize you and people now understand who's getting demonized generally is
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:35.360]  who either is at least good or wasn't following orders and as a rebel in a
[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:40.320]  maverick that's the place you want to be so I mean I get the joke Spencer Pratt
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:43.360]  and hiding Montag about to infiltrate Hollywood again but the thing is
[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:46.440]  Hollywood is collapsing that whole system is falling what type of projects
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:50.600]  have you guys thought about doing I think just something that makes sense for
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:53.960]  our lives so at this point our lives I'm not going to do something that
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:58.280]  compromises our integrity and our families and so if it's something that's
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:03.000]  fun and light-hearted and feel good show that can actually help other families
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.840]  like I love the show the Chris Lee's know best because it's a fun light-hearted
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:10.400]  family show and I think that can really help bring families together so if it
[02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:13.920]  was something like that I'd love to do it and I think it'd be great for us and
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:18.680]  a good opportunity but I'm definitely not going to play the villain or
[02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:23.320]  compromise our morals anymore how many of the reality shows from folks you
[02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:27.120]  talked to what you've experienced are like you 100% real and what would those
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:31.920]  shows be versus half real versus you know totally staged I would say the only
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:38.200]  reality show that's a hundred percent real is cops yeah it's a hard you know
[02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:42.720]  everything is for media it's on media it's for entertainment so at the end of
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:46.440]  the day there's always going to be editing and producing well I can tell
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:50.040]  you this when I'll throw a fit every once a while and stop off the stage or
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:55.280]  those of it's a real fact let's just get that again let's get that again let's
[02:45:55.280 --> 02:46:00.040]  get that here let's ask the crews is it real when I get mad it's not fake
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:05.160]  huh it's somebody is somebody calling the shots here no one's calling the
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:10.120]  shots there's no teleprompter there's no nothing it's real life happening as
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:12.640]  happens that's what's why people think they're like somebody tell me what to do
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:16.760]  I'm not even tell myself what to do I wish I was so nice yeah I didn't think
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:22.120]  anyone would tell you so so those viral clips of you getting all mad yelling you
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:25.120]  can't just turn that on for a shot because I would love to get one of those
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:28.120]  clips oh I mean I could turn it on but I feel that way so kind of let the dog
[02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:31.960]  off the leash how does there's some like a trigger line that I say that gets you
[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:35.840]  worked up oh yeah like tyranny people trying to dominate take control of our
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:41.320]  lives yeah they are so can we get a clip of just a little outburst I mean I'm
[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:45.440]  in a good mood right now the thing is the thing is I'm on air for hours and I
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:49.400]  start thinking about about Hillary ruling over my family and slug murdering
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:52.960]  piece of crap who thinks we're all her slave better than us no she's gonna fail
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:55.480]  I just gotta think about a piece of crap she is and Bill Clinton all the rest of
[02:46:55.480 --> 02:46:59.080]  them that seems like you're on I had a weird dream last night like Bill Clinton
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:01.920]  was it public and Paul Jones was there on the stage and he like ran over like
[02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:05.560]  gone was like grabbing on her I just remembered that just now that's a sad
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:11.760]  nightmare I'm glad I don't have those dreams I gotta say I ran into you guys
[02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:15.760]  yesterday I remember all the stuff you went through it was amazing and you guys
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:19.480]  talked about your journey and that you guys kind of felt symbolically something
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:22.480]  magic was about to happen and I thought about it and then we get out here in
[02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:26.320]  this huge rainbow appears right when we first get here it's gone now and that's
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:29.800]  the sign of new beginnings so we're not gonna see what's about to happen in the
[02:47:29.800 --> 02:47:32.840]  life of you guys but I think Hollywood rejecting you is a good sign not a
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:37.800]  negative one I hope you're right because I would like some some rejected
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:42.120]  checks please yeah I think that that's what we needed at the time and you know I
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:45.880]  felt like it was divine intervention because we were at a dark place and it
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:49.720]  became really hard and challenging and we reestablished a lot of relationships
[02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:54.560]  and brought our lives back together so I it was great and it wasn't worth what we
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:47:58.800]  were going through and I think now is a good time to move forward tell us about
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:03.960]  the baby the baby is really great I'm so excited he's kicking and this is this
[02:48:03.960 --> 02:48:08.560]  is what's important in life so I mean obviously we love to be successful again
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:12.040]  and whatever is meant to be but at the end of the day it's about family and
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:16.760]  your life and your values I'd say this is pretty success right here I mean
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:18.880]  wait till that baby's running around and everything you're gonna say this is what
[02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:21.640]  really matters final point I want to make here and then get here to your
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:28.680]  judiciary class is that they admit that 101 they've got fake liberal bots that
[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:31.960]  are paid for by Facebook Twitter Amazon's big and do it he's big into
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:36.920]  propaganda Bezos he owns Amazon.com he got $600 million from the CIA just to
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:41.360]  run propaganda from US taxpayers that a month for Obama left office okay this
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:44.400]  this info you see they're all quarterbacking that they think we're
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:48.960]  dumb it's admitted on Twitter on Facebook especially they have bots that are fake
[02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:53.320]  accounts that real people load stuff into but an AI computer then decides how
[02:48:53.320 --> 02:48:57.600]  to respond one gal respond to a thousand posts in a single second and they'll tell
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:00.840]  you oh you're nobody everybody hates you Trump's going down you're scum you're a
[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:05.000]  fool Alex is failing Alex is going bankrupt Alex is dying you're gonna die
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:08.800]  oh you're a failure you'll never be anybody and it's bots but it's not just
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:11.360]  to make you be demoralized and think that the enemy's winning like Tokyo
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:14.960]  Rosen you know Japan saying GIs America's been defeated your sweetheart's
[02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:18.720]  dead we just took over the US as we're dropping atomic bombs on them they were
[02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:21.840]  saying that they were winning just like Baghdad Bob remember the guy saying we
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:25.400]  have defeated the Americans they are in collate meanwhile like bombs are going
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:29.040]  off a mile behind him it's the same deal so they're trying to demoralize you but
[02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:32.480]  it's also about the fake liberals and Facebook documents came out this year
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:35.720]  where they go liberals are alone they're scared they live in their mother's
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:38.920]  basements they have demographics we need to keep them scared and alone and only
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:43.060]  bots are their friends so we've got to encourage them to be hateful and then be
[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:46.520]  friends with their bots so it's beyond being friends with folks on reality TV
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:51.400]  that are your friends like to show friends it is being friends with a bunch
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:54.880]  of bots that you all reinforce each other in a cult so it's people in a
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:59.000]  digital cult with digital avatar bots they're already in virtual reality like
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.400]  folks with second life you know they had money for a white Ferrari it's all our
[02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:07.840]  pink one it's all total fake billionaire strut garbage so it's all
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:11.680]  imaginary there's these superstars in fake world we're raiding into the matrix

[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:19.000]  blowing holes in the electronic Berlin Wall for the light of truth to come in
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:22.480]  we're not protecting a lot of truth we're blowing holes for it to come in so
[02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:25.840]  we're gonna get attacked as we go in and blow holes in it so just expect that

[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:45.600]  truth just bomb so does that make sense it does make sense and sometimes I feel
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:50.280]  like a bot you're not a bot because you guys broke with the matrix and right at
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:52.560]  the height of your career and said let's go on the Alex Jones show and at first
[02:55:52.560 --> 02:55:55.280]  I was like is this fake and then behind the scenes like hey come out let's hang
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:55:58.160]  out love your film I love this part we're gonna fight the new order micro chips
[02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:01.120]  I think I even had a few conversations with you quite a few I was like dude
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:04.320]  they're gonna come after you sure you want to do this you definitely warned us
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:08.880]  and I was like we're fine we're fine no what's crazy if we want to go to like
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:15.520]  dark dark you know multiple people died that were in our entourage yeah that hi
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:22.000]  our lawyer was allegedly he he's no longer alive right when this was all
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:25.680]  happening there's a lot of death in teaming our lawyers not Heidi's plastic
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:31.240]  surgeon no longer alive so I mean it was so the stakes got so beyond real when
[02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:36.360]  people you know when you feel that you know we can we actually go ahead and say
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:41.360]  yeah no we left to Costa Rica we were gonna move there and we left all our
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:46.760]  stuff yeah and because we were yeah we were concerned we're scared that we
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:50.600]  were gonna get like off Michael Jackson style like oh they're crazy the
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:53.920]  Starkiller stuff's real when a star they have an actuary a forming one want to
[02:56:53.920 --> 02:56:56.680]  start peaks and they know they're about to dive whatever but they know that
[02:56:56.680 --> 02:56:59.880]  the whole catalog worth double or triple so the catalogs already worth five
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:03.120]  billion and you kill somebody that's worth 15 billion instead of nothing
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:11.560]  thankfully we had no catalogs but we did we did start feeling that momentum so
[02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:14.920]  that's one of the reasons that we left and just dropped out of everything and
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:18.840]  took our dogs and it was just it was a scary time I've run into people just
[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:21.600]  separately trying to think they could create a catalog and then kill me and
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:24.280]  you're like and they're actually like in front of you preparing it and you
[02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:27.120]  figure out they're doing you're like no I mean people are crazy they don't want
[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:31.120]  to build something they want to steal it yeah no it's it's people are scary it's
[02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:36.280]  a scary world so all right guys well listen you're awesome and hopefully we
[02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:40.800]  do another interview this week while you're here thanks a lot guys hey bring
[02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:43.840]  the rainbow again next time no absolutely if I was trendy see I just

[03:00:22.680 --> 03:00:26.360]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us
[03:00:26.360 --> 03:00:30.000]  in the next segment for the fourth hour in this short segment I want to try to
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:34.480]  break down some of the timeline some of the context for what's happened with
[03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:38.080]  Debbie Wasserman Schulz and the DNC what we just learned in the last couple of
[03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:43.000]  days it's very large folks of course we had less than a week ago we found that
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:47.440]  the FBI had rated an IT worker who's been there's been a long series of
[03:00:47.440 --> 03:00:51.960]  articles by the Daily Caller and a few other outlets we've covered it ourselves
[03:00:51.960 --> 03:00:57.120]  as well but of course mainstream media has ignored this thoroughly and we
[03:00:57.120 --> 03:01:00.240]  started talking about the ghost employees the people that were getting
[03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:06.160]  paid 160,000 plus the family the brothers who came from Pakistan this is
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:09.600]  more about four to five times more than what the typical IT worker was getting
[03:01:09.600 --> 03:01:13.360]  this family got over four million dollars in just a couple of years and
[03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:18.840]  even as scandals began to crop up even as they were being investigated by the
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:23.400]  Capitol Police for theft of equipment Debbie Wasserman Schulz refused to fire
[03:01:23.400 --> 03:01:28.920]  this guy who was just arrested trying to leave the country after wiring 283,000
[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:33.520]  dollars to Pakistan he said at first for a funeral and the question is whose
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:40.520]  funeral his from the Clinton people or the funeral of the DNC Debbie Wasserman
[03:01:40.520 --> 03:01:46.000]  Schulz the political funeral of those people this is something that his wife
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:49.080]  left in March and of course she was stopped at the airport as she was going
[03:01:49.080 --> 03:01:52.560]  back to Pakistan she had over 16,000 dollars in cash you think you and I
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:55.680]  would be allowed to leave if they were suspicious of something and we're
[03:01:55.680 --> 03:01:59.840]  carrying that amount of money there's 25 years ago when I first saw one of the
[03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:04.040]  well the first civil asset forfeiture cases that I saw and of course it was a
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:08.600]  black man who had a business he would fly one way to another country another
[03:02:08.600 --> 03:02:13.680]  state rather and he would buy some equipment that he would then drive back
[03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:18.440]  in a truck he'd rent a truck and buy it was gardening and landscaping stuff
[03:02:18.440 --> 03:02:22.560]  that he would buy supplies and fly that back well he went at the last minute
[03:02:22.560 --> 03:02:26.720]  because he didn't make a lot of plans went the last minute paid for cash paid
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:31.160]  for his ticket and cash and the person who sold him the ticket alerted the
[03:02:31.160 --> 03:02:34.800]  airport officials they confiscated all of his cash he was not involved in
[03:02:34.800 --> 03:02:38.440]  anything criminal but of course they can just charge the cash and take it
[03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:42.160]  without charging with a crime but this lady the wife of this individual was
[03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:45.840]  allowed to leave with 16,000 dollars in cash he had a big stash of cash on him
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:49.520]  as well was going to Pakistan now this was just a couple of days after the FBI
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:53.400]  had finally moved to take a look at these disc drives and remember the DNC
[03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:56.120]  refused to turn over disc drives for quite some time I don't think they've
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:03:00.360]  still turned over all the disc drives but they learned that this individual had
[03:03:00.360 --> 03:03:03.480]  disc drives and had been stolen when they finally got to them they had been
[03:03:03.480 --> 03:03:07.240]  smashed and so this reminds me of the story that you've all heard about the
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:10.680]  individual who is crossing the border sometimes it's with bicycles sometimes
[03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:13.800]  it's with a wheelbarrow or whatever they are trying to figure out what what he's
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:16.920]  doing they think he's smuggling something but they're not quite sure and
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:20.720]  they keep stopping him and looking he's on the bicycle and eventually they
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:25.440]  realize he's smuggling bicycles so when he stole these disc drives they weren't
[03:03:25.440 --> 03:03:30.960]  interested in reselling the used computer equipment they were interested
[03:03:30.960 --> 03:03:34.160]  in what was on the disc drives information and then they don't want
[03:03:34.160 --> 03:03:37.680]  anybody to see what they were collecting there so they smashed this now we've had
[03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:43.000]  Representative Stephen King saying this individual Imran Awan had access to all
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:47.080]  the communications of the Foreign Affairs Committee that should be very
[03:03:47.080 --> 03:03:53.200]  troubling if we know who he is this is somebody who was guilty of blackmailing
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:58.000]  his stepmother she went to the police she had to have a translator because she
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:01.360]  didn't even speak English but she was saying he's threatening me and saying
[03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:05.040]  that they're going to kidnap my relatives back in Pakistan if I don't
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:07.960]  turn this over nevertheless we have Democrat congressman saying this is
[03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:12.320]  nothing but Islamophobia and this is the tact of defense that's being taken by
[03:04:12.320 --> 03:04:16.640]  his lawyer who is his lawyer his lawyer is Chris Gowan who said this is
[03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:20.800]  clearly a right-wing media-driven prosecution by the US Attorney's office
[03:04:20.800 --> 03:04:25.040]  that wants to prosecute people for working while Muslim no it was actually
[03:04:25.040 --> 03:04:30.040]  his relatives his Muslim relatives that were being blackmailed by him this is
[03:04:30.040 --> 03:04:33.240]  an individual by the way this attorney who worked for the Bill Clinton White
[03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:37.200]  House he worked for Senator Hillary Clinton he worked on her 2008 campaign
[03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:41.040]  he worked for the Clinton Foundation the Clinton Global Initiative the Clinton
[03:04:41.040 --> 03:04:45.360]  Library there's a lot of corruption going on here folks and when we see these
[03:04:45.360 --> 03:04:50.480]  people blackmailing having access to the communications of the foreign committee
[03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:53.520]  foreign affairs committee having access to all these Democrats the question is
[03:04:53.520 --> 03:04:57.360]  who were they blackmailing they were sending this information off-site we'll
[03:04:57.360 --> 03:05:01.160]  have more information about this tonight on the FO wars nightly news Paul Joseph
[03:05:01.160 --> 03:05:03.800]  Watson coming up
[03:05:04.840 --> 03:05:09.160]  after speaking with his military staff president Trump has banned transgenders
[03:05:09.160 --> 03:05:11.960]  from the military citing disruptions in the service such as structural
[03:05:11.960 --> 03:05:15.560]  accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons his decision stems
[03:05:15.560 --> 03:05:18.280]  from a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide
[03:05:18.280 --> 03:05:21.280]  insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another in other news
[03:05:21.280 --> 03:05:24.760]  president Trump also publicly blasted his attorney general Jeff sessions for
[03:05:24.760 --> 03:05:27.920]  not replacing acting FBI director Andrew McCabe who was at the center of
[03:05:27.920 --> 03:05:31.520]  controversy after his wife received 700,000 for her political campaign from
[03:05:31.520 --> 03:05:34.760]  Hillary Clinton the cable is handling the FBI investigation into Clinton the
[03:05:34.760 --> 03:05:38.000]  president also blasted sessions on Tuesday for taking quote a very weak
[03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:41.560]  position on Hillary Clinton crimes so far sessions has focused more on ramping
[03:05:41.560 --> 03:05:44.440]  up civil asset forfeiture and prosecuting marijuana users and
[03:05:44.440 --> 03:05:47.720]  investigating Hillary Clinton CNN however has launched an investigation
[03:05:47.720 --> 03:05:50.560]  into media pioneer Matt Drudge the founder of the Drudge report has been
[03:05:50.560 --> 03:05:53.120]  spending a lot of time at the White House which has forced establishment
[03:05:53.120 --> 03:05:56.200]  media to not only acknowledge his influence over Trump but also his role as
[03:05:56.200 --> 03:05:59.280]  the progress meter of the Trump agenda and how the Drudge report represents
[03:05:59.280 --> 03:06:02.040]  middle America if Matt Drudge is concerned about the progress Trump is
[03:06:02.040 --> 03:06:06.440]  making so should the president this is Kit Daniels with info wars.com as most
[03:06:06.440 --> 03:06:10.680]  of you already know I am a voracious consumer of news and information and
[03:06:10.680 --> 03:06:14.840]  in the last four or five years doing more and more research I came across the
[03:06:14.840 --> 03:06:19.440]  fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient
[03:06:19.440 --> 03:06:23.920]  ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our
[03:06:23.920 --> 03:06:28.800]  ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting
[03:06:28.800 --> 03:06:33.440]  killing and then processing and so I set out to develop caveman but to not just
[03:06:33.440 --> 03:06:38.360]  have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood
[03:06:38.360 --> 03:06:43.600]  ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time
[03:06:43.600 --> 03:06:47.840]  info wars isn't just fighting the globalist we're getting results and
[03:06:47.840 --> 03:06:52.400]  we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning
[03:06:52.400 --> 03:06:56.920]  because of your support caveman is finally back at the info war store you
[03:06:56.920 --> 03:07:02.120]  can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at info wars life.com
[03:07:02.120 --> 03:07:06.560]  or by calling toll free triple a two five three three one three nine they use
[03:07:06.560 --> 03:07:11.200]  their media to assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children
[03:07:11.200 --> 03:07:15.440]  that their president is another Hitler they use their movie stars and singers
[03:07:15.440 --> 03:07:19.760]  and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over
[03:07:19.760 --> 03:07:23.880]  again and then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance
[03:07:23.880 --> 03:07:29.880]  all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism and
[03:07:29.880 --> 03:07:35.280]  xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates
[03:07:35.280 --> 03:07:40.680]  and airports bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is
[03:07:40.680 --> 03:07:45.600]  for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness and when that happens
[03:07:45.600 --> 03:07:50.920]  they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only way we stop this the
[03:07:50.920 --> 03:07:56.600]  only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of
[03:07:56.600 --> 03:08:02.120]  lies with the clenched fist of truth I'm the National Rifle Association of
[03:08:02.120 --> 03:08:07.080]  America and I'm freedom's safest place
[03:08:10.400 --> 03:08:19.080]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show and now your host
[03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:23.280]  Paul Joseph Watson
[03:08:23.280 --> 03:08:31.320]  real live it is the poor power of the Alex Jones show and the map has gone for
[03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:35.680]  the time being it will be back but in its place is the Nazi haircut as you can
[03:08:35.680 --> 03:08:39.800]  see if you go to my Twitter actually I can show you what I'm talking about when
[03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:45.040]  I say Nazi haircut because the route which is a big online publication big
[03:08:45.040 --> 03:08:49.960]  left-wing news outlet actually did an article a few months ago where they
[03:08:49.960 --> 03:08:54.640]  said Eric Trump was probably a Nazi literally put him next to a picture of
[03:08:54.640 --> 03:09:01.520]  Hitler because he got a haircut which was a shaved back and sides with a bit of
[03:09:01.520 --> 03:09:06.440]  length on top there you see one of the tweets if you go to where if you scroll
[03:09:06.440 --> 03:09:12.840]  down a bit there's a tweet a few hours ago I put out probably not that one but
[03:09:12.840 --> 03:09:17.360]  it's the root magazine literally they said that Eric Trump was a probably a
[03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:21.600]  Nazi put his picture next next to Hitler there you see it next to Richard
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:26.720]  Spencer also because he got this haircut which is by the way the most
[03:09:26.720 --> 03:09:33.960]  universally fashionable haircut amongst men aged what 18 to 40 right now in the
[03:09:33.960 --> 03:09:39.880]  entire Western world but no that's not why Eric Trump got that haircut that's
[03:09:39.880 --> 03:09:43.840]  not why I got that haircut we got it because we're alt right fascists and
[03:09:43.840 --> 03:09:48.560]  we're literally Hitler that's why we got that haircut that was an actual serious
[03:09:48.560 --> 03:09:53.680]  news article that was published on the internet and people believed it this is
[03:09:53.680 --> 03:09:57.960]  the level of the hysteria that we're dealing with and we're gonna get into
[03:09:57.960 --> 03:10:03.000]  more of that later here on the show first up Gateway Pundit reports Hillary
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:08.440]  Clinton is getting mercilessly roasted over her book title what happened so
[03:10:08.440 --> 03:10:14.040]  yes Hillary Clinton in between whining about Russians and WikiLeaks and Alex
[03:10:14.040 --> 03:10:18.480]  Jones and info wars she's released yet another book despite the fact that they
[03:10:18.480 --> 03:10:22.640]  always bomb because nobody gives a damn about what she has to say anymore she's
[03:10:22.640 --> 03:10:28.320]  released yet another book called what happened well a few people on Twitter on
[03:10:28.320 --> 03:10:33.240]  social media had their own version of what happened and you can see some of
[03:10:33.240 --> 03:10:38.800]  them in this article one of them simply says shlonged that's what happened to
[03:10:38.800 --> 03:10:43.440]  Hillary Rodham Clinton there's a whole list of reasons what happened Hillary
[03:10:43.440 --> 03:10:47.880]  getting thrown into the side of a van like a side of beef back in September
[03:10:47.880 --> 03:10:53.520]  last year that's what happened Hillary's 30,000 deleted emails that's what
[03:10:53.520 --> 03:10:58.040]  happened Hillary rigging the primaries that's what happened
[03:10:58.040 --> 03:11:03.440]  her awful campaign strategy that's what happened Benghazi that's what happened the
[03:11:03.440 --> 03:11:06.720]  fact that she's a liar a criminal the fact that she abandoned Wisconsin the
[03:11:06.720 --> 03:11:10.280]  fact that she called black super predators the fact that she called half of
[03:11:10.280 --> 03:11:16.120]  America deplorables that's what happened Hillary but now she's got a new book
[03:11:16.120 --> 03:11:23.040]  making more excuses about why she lost the election blaming imaginary Russian
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:27.280]  conspiracy theories you know how blaming WikiLeaks blaming info wars
[03:11:27.280 --> 03:11:30.840]  people have got their own version of what happened and in fact this was an idea
[03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:36.880]  mentioned to me shortly before I came on the show here by Laura Luma who works
[03:11:36.880 --> 03:11:41.080]  over at the rebel now we're gonna talk to Alex about this I'm just gonna float
[03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:44.360]  this right now this is not an official announcement obviously because we need to
[03:11:44.360 --> 03:11:50.240]  talk about this if Hillary Clinton has book signings for this book which will
[03:11:50.240 --> 03:11:56.040]  probably happen should we troll Hillary Clinton that's the question I'm asking on
[03:11:56.040 --> 03:12:01.560]  the show today should we have people show up politely buy her book at any
[03:12:01.560 --> 03:12:06.960]  particular book signing that she attends and tell Hillary what happened or at
[03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:11.360]  least ask her the question what happened what happened to your 30,000
[03:12:11.360 --> 03:12:16.800]  emails Hillary what happened in Benghazi what happened to all the money for Haiti
[03:12:16.800 --> 03:12:21.520]  what happened there what happened to the fact that a fifth of your campaign at
[03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:26.320]  least was funded by Saudi Arabia a country that still stones gay people to
[03:12:26.320 --> 03:12:31.360]  death and yet your daughter was out on Twitter yesterday virtue signaling about
[03:12:31.360 --> 03:12:35.840]  how much she cares about LGBT issues what happened with that maybe we should
[03:12:35.840 --> 03:12:40.160]  have people show up at these events and ask Hillary directly what happened in
[03:12:40.160 --> 03:12:45.400]  all those cases what happened Hillary when you intimidated and abused Bill
[03:12:45.400 --> 03:12:50.280]  Clinton's right victims what happened there a lot of questions as to what
[03:12:50.280 --> 03:12:54.440]  happened in regards to Hillary Clinton isn't there and maybe we should ask her
[03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:58.560]  should we have a contest this is not an official announcement on flow in the
[03:12:58.560 --> 03:13:03.280]  idea should we have a contest for the best confrontation Hillary Clinton
[03:13:03.280 --> 03:13:08.400]  asking her what happened of course it's completely dependent on if she does any
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:13.920]  actual book signings we know for a fact that Hillary basically hates humans so
[03:13:13.920 --> 03:13:18.640]  it might not happen she might not want to actually meet them God forbid in
[03:13:18.640 --> 03:13:22.720]  public and you know touch them and have to speak to that to the scum to the
[03:13:22.720 --> 03:13:27.160]  plebs is she actually doing any book signings for this book we're gonna find
[03:13:27.160 --> 03:13:31.120]  out it was an idea that was presented to me literally 10 minutes ago I think
[03:13:31.120 --> 03:13:36.760]  very smart one and we may indeed find out what happened in all those cases of
[03:13:36.760 --> 03:13:40.320]  course she's not gonna answer the questions but it could be a nice little
[03:13:40.320 --> 03:13:44.680]  troll politely asking the question again the left will probably freak out about
[03:13:44.680 --> 03:13:49.360]  this now Newsweek will write articles saying that we're calling for civil war
[03:13:49.360 --> 03:13:53.560]  because we dare ask Hillary Clinton a question but I think that's a very
[03:13:53.560 --> 03:13:57.880]  interesting proposal and it may indeed come to fruition so I'm gonna flow that
[03:13:57.880 --> 03:14:02.160]  idea now let's see if it comes into effect let's see if she actually does
[03:14:02.160 --> 03:14:07.960]  any book signings because it's completely dependent on that moving on
[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:12.920]  West Monster reports Muslim gang attacks strangers in Liverpool for being white
[03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:18.560]  non-Muslims you turn the tables on this can you imagine for a second given all
[03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:23.560]  the hysteria given all the fake news about hate crime sweeping Britain after
[03:14:23.560 --> 03:14:30.440]  Brexit which is a complete hoax reports of hate crime have increased actual
[03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:34.600]  documented examples haven't then when you drill down into what they classify as a
[03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:38.640]  hate crime I mean you basically had Wiltshire police in the UK a couple of
[03:14:38.640 --> 03:14:44.160]  days ago saying that they would track down they literally use those words
[03:14:44.160 --> 03:14:48.560]  track down people who said mean things on Twitter that's not as if we've got
[03:14:48.560 --> 03:14:53.040]  acid attacks not as if we've got stabbings not as if we've got terrorism
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:58.200]  taking place in some cases every day in some areas of the UK right now no
[03:14:58.200 --> 03:15:04.080]  they're going to go after people who wrote offensive things on Twitter hate
[03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:09.560]  crimes that's what they're defining it as now imagine if a group of white people
[03:15:09.560 --> 03:15:14.880]  had rampaged through the streets of a major city in the UK attacking Muslims
[03:15:14.880 --> 03:15:21.600]  for being Muslim it would be a nationwide outrage non-stop media coverage
[03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:26.840]  you flip the tables a group of Muslims attack white people specifically
[03:15:26.840 --> 03:15:31.360]  because they're not Muslims which happened the national broadcaster of the
[03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:38.980]  country the BBC hasn't even reported on it the mafia that we all pay hundreds of
[03:15:38.980 --> 03:15:43.080]  pounds to every year not to get a knock on the door from the goons not to get a
[03:15:43.080 --> 03:15:49.320]  criminal record taxpayer funded they're not reporting on this at all nothing
[03:15:49.320 --> 03:15:55.800]  zip nada zilch a gang of Muslim jobs have been jailed following vicious
[03:15:55.800 --> 03:16:00.600]  attacks on strangers in Liverpool town center because they were quote why non
[03:16:00.600 --> 03:16:06.720]  Muslims I'm in Mohammed Mohammed Patel and Farooq Patel will call after a
[03:16:06.720 --> 03:16:11.000]  passerby saw them attacking a man and using racist language talking about
[03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:15.240]  Muslims and Christians one of the gang asked the man if he was a Muslim to
[03:16:15.240 --> 03:16:19.400]  which he replied that he was before being asked by the gang well what's the
[03:16:19.400 --> 03:16:24.240]  Muslim word he replied with a well-known Arabic phrase there is only one God
[03:16:24.240 --> 03:16:28.920]  Muhammad is the messenger he was allowed to leave the gang then cornered
[03:16:28.920 --> 03:16:32.920]  another man asking him what are you the victim was confused but when one of them
[03:16:32.920 --> 03:16:37.920]  said I'm a Muslim what are you he answered I'm a Christian the scumbags
[03:16:37.920 --> 03:16:42.400]  then assaulted the man breaking his glasses and causing a cut above his
[03:16:42.400 --> 03:16:49.160]  eye all I'll shout in quote why aren't you a Muslim this is the Sharia law
[03:16:49.160 --> 03:16:54.160]  patrol that are increasingly seeing on the streets of the UK beatdowns violent
[03:16:54.160 --> 03:17:00.760]  assaults policing of behavior for people who aren't Muslims in British cities a
[03:17:00.760 --> 03:17:05.680]  Labour councillor was also beaten by the man who was walking through the sound
[03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:09.880]  with his girlfriend as was a passerby who tried to intervene he was taken to
[03:17:09.880 --> 03:17:13.560]  hospital and treated for bruising and bleeding to his eyes judge Louise
[03:17:13.560 --> 03:17:18.680]  Brandon said quote this was a disgraceful and sustained campaign of
[03:17:18.680 --> 03:17:23.680]  violence carried out on the streets of this city Mohammed confessed to quote
[03:17:23.680 --> 03:17:28.600]  targeting people because they were white and non-Muslim that's a direct quote
[03:17:28.600 --> 03:17:33.080]  through toll officers he filmed the attacks because he thought it was quote
[03:17:33.080 --> 03:17:40.240]  funny and described it as quote a laugh Mohammed cried as he was jailed for 42
[03:17:40.240 --> 03:17:44.840]  weeks Patel received 42 and 18 weeks respectively in a young offenders
[03:17:44.840 --> 03:17:48.640]  institution so they're not even gonna be in jail for a year they'll probably be
[03:17:48.640 --> 03:17:54.720]  out in three months after vicious hate crime attacks on white people because
[03:17:54.720 --> 03:18:01.320]  they're not Muslims on the streets of a British city not a scintilla of coverage
[03:18:01.320 --> 03:18:07.760]  from the country's national broadcaster the BBC oh but the focus now has become
[03:18:07.760 --> 03:18:13.160]  a Muslim man stopped them from attacking someone so we've always found a
[03:18:13.160 --> 03:18:17.600]  reason to bow down and worship Islam once again they've even managed to squeeze
[03:18:17.600 --> 03:18:23.240]  that out the story where a Muslim mob is attacking white people because they're
[03:18:23.240 --> 03:18:28.360]  not Muslim Muslims they managed to squeeze a pro Islam narrative out of
[03:18:28.360 --> 03:18:35.240]  even that and the BBC is not reporting on it at all I'm gonna do an article
[03:18:35.240 --> 03:18:40.480]  about that we will see if we can pressure the top national tax payer
[03:18:40.480 --> 03:18:48.960]  funded broadcaster to report on a rampant hate crime mob rage that we saw on
[03:18:48.960 --> 03:18:52.800]  the streets of Liverpool it's been report elsewhere it's not being reported by the
[03:18:52.800 --> 03:18:57.080]  BBC if that was white people attacking Muslims because they were Muslim
[03:18:57.080 --> 03:19:04.280]  brutally assaulting them would be a national news story for weeks nothing
[03:19:04.280 --> 03:19:11.000]  absolutely nothing another story here in terms of cultural enrichment failed
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:17.640]  Afghan asylum seeker who wanted to kill Germans allowed to stay oh what could
[03:19:17.640 --> 03:19:22.560]  possibly go wrong a failed Afghan asylum seeker who said he wanted to kill
[03:19:22.560 --> 03:19:28.000]  Germans yeah great integration multiculturalism working great isn't
[03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:32.920]  it has been allowed to stay in the country following an appeal SFN again
[03:19:32.920 --> 03:19:36.280]  they don't give the full names because they protect them was arrested two months
[03:19:36.280 --> 03:19:40.320]  ago a college in Nuremberg with a view to being deported however following
[03:19:40.320 --> 03:19:45.720]  riots from far left students oh they came to his aid he lodged an appeal tried
[03:19:45.720 --> 03:19:51.840]  to claim asylum he was successful in doing so thanks to left wingers
[03:19:51.840 --> 03:19:57.440]  protesting in his favor after he said he wanted to kill Germans absolutely
[03:19:57.440 --> 03:20:06.520]  despicable will be back after the break stay tuned it's been said any society
[03:20:06.520 --> 03:20:11.000]  is only three missed meals away from chaos those times may be near think
[03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:14.680]  about it our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from
[03:20:14.680 --> 03:20:19.080]  Russia and North Korea social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to
[03:20:19.080 --> 03:20:23.040]  looting of stores and city shutdowns and a crumbling infrastructure leaves our

[03:26:56.680 --> 03:27:02.280]  the guy who has literally tried to overthrow Trump through his hysteria
[03:27:02.280 --> 03:27:09.040]  for the past six seven months is still talking about it this is out of CNS news
[03:27:09.040 --> 03:27:13.800]  Michael Moore I refuse to live in a country where Donald Trump is president
[03:27:13.800 --> 03:27:17.920]  and I'm not leaving literally sounds like a child having a tantrum because he
[03:27:17.920 --> 03:27:22.680]  didn't get his own way actually sounds like that let's go to the video clip
[03:27:22.680 --> 03:27:28.000]  this is Michael Moore on Steven Colbert's show here's the clip so I will tell you
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:34.480]  this I will say this I will say this I refuse to live in a country where Donald
[03:27:34.480 --> 03:27:41.680]  Trump is president and I'm not leaving so something got to change
[03:27:41.680 --> 03:27:48.480]  well do you think he makes it all for you make up makes another three and a
[03:27:48.480 --> 03:27:53.920]  half years I actually I live with the attitude and I'm sorry to you know I
[03:27:53.920 --> 03:27:58.360]  don't mean to go dark on you here but just think of you know you all know your
[03:27:58.360 --> 03:28:03.400]  age right now how old are you gonna be in 2025 the possibility exists that
[03:28:03.400 --> 03:28:12.720]  Donald Trump will be your our president in the year 2025 get used to it six
[03:28:12.720 --> 03:28:18.800]  months later or even seven months later hysterical sack of crap Michael Moore is
[03:28:18.800 --> 03:28:24.520]  still trying to overthrow the president with his temper tantrums after all this
[03:28:24.520 --> 03:28:29.840]  time I think what happened with Michael Moore who by the way was a big Bernie
[03:28:29.840 --> 03:28:34.120]  Sanders fan basically said Hillary Clinton was evil incarnate for months
[03:28:34.120 --> 03:28:39.320]  and months during the presidential campaign suddenly flipped and endorsed
[03:28:39.320 --> 03:28:43.360]  Hillary Clinton despite the fact that she was evil according to him for being
[03:28:43.360 --> 03:28:47.960]  funded by Goldman Sachs for voting for the Iraq war for all these are the
[03:28:47.960 --> 03:28:52.640]  reasons why you shouldn't vote for her oh suddenly you should vote for her that's
[03:28:52.640 --> 03:28:58.280]  Michael Moore's integrity it's non-existent so this is a guy who came out
[03:28:58.280 --> 03:29:01.840]  when everyone was saying oh it's inevitable that Hillary Clinton will win
[03:29:01.840 --> 03:29:07.320]  he's the one guy on the left that said no we have to be troubled by the
[03:29:07.320 --> 03:29:11.640]  prospect of Donald Trump winning he was right basically since now he thinks he's
[03:29:11.640 --> 03:29:16.400]  Nostradamus that he predicted this great unknown event he thinks he can
[03:29:16.400 --> 03:29:22.600]  actually steer and manipulate reality by making other predictions the problem
[03:29:22.600 --> 03:29:27.880]  with that is every single prediction he's made since has failed every single
[03:29:27.880 --> 03:29:33.160]  hysterical resistance activity he's tried has failed call on the Democrats to
[03:29:33.160 --> 03:29:37.080]  declare a national emergency failed called on protesters to disrupt the
[03:29:37.080 --> 03:29:41.720]  inauguration failed said there was something unexpected that might happen
[03:29:41.720 --> 03:29:46.520]  in December that would prevent Trump from being inaugurated never happened
[03:29:46.520 --> 03:29:50.920]  Michael Moore is a sack of crap he's been wrong time and time again he'll be
[03:29:50.920 --> 03:29:56.280]  wrong with this too we'll be back after the break don't go away the empires on

[03:30:10.640 --> 03:30:14.960]  most basic principle to being a free American is a notion that we as

[03:33:24.360 --> 03:33:28.880]  we are back just the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show there was just an article
[03:33:28.880 --> 03:33:33.840]  published at a website called potmatters and titled the summer of love lives on
[03:33:33.840 --> 03:33:39.080]  at the high Sierra music festival they mention my phrase which I've said many
[03:33:39.080 --> 03:33:43.360]  times over the past six months that conservatism is the new counterculture
[03:33:43.360 --> 03:33:47.080]  which is completely borne out by the fact that generation Z is the most
[03:33:47.080 --> 03:33:51.280]  conservative generation since World War two more and more people are rejecting
[03:33:51.280 --> 03:33:55.880]  the all left which has essentially become the mainstream left over the past
[03:33:55.880 --> 03:34:00.680]  year or so oh but this article proves me wrong it says quote this key point
[03:34:00.680 --> 03:34:05.360]  about peace love and fun because leftists really love fun don't they they
[03:34:05.360 --> 03:34:09.400]  don't try to ban anyone who says anything offensive is what alt right
[03:34:09.400 --> 03:34:14.200]  agitator don't even identify as alt right Paul Joseph Watson from info wars
[03:34:14.200 --> 03:34:18.640]  dot com misses completely with his utterly clueless suggestion earlier this
[03:34:18.640 --> 03:34:23.600]  year that the alt this is a quote from them I said apparently quote the alt
[03:34:23.600 --> 03:34:29.360]  right is a new counterculture as a quote never said that never said that like
[03:34:29.360 --> 03:34:35.200]  learn how learn what quotes are before trying slagging me off in articles said
[03:34:35.200 --> 03:34:38.680]  conservatism was a new counterculture not the alt right the alt right doesn't
[03:34:38.680 --> 03:34:44.400]  even like me get it right this is basic stuff here no sir mr. Watson this
[03:34:44.400 --> 03:34:49.320]  article reads like it was written by a 14 year old no sir mr. Watson you and
[03:34:49.320 --> 03:34:56.040]  your ilk on even in the ballpark right so me saying conservatism is a new
[03:34:56.040 --> 03:35:01.920]  counterculture was so silly was so asinine was so manifestly ridiculous
[03:35:01.920 --> 03:35:07.560]  four months ago that the left spent the next four months writing panicked
[03:35:07.560 --> 03:35:12.960]  articles reassuring themselves that conservatism isn't the new counterculture
[03:35:12.960 --> 03:35:18.040]  if what I said was so out there so incredibly stupid why do you keep
[03:35:18.040 --> 03:35:23.240]  bringing it up something tells me makes them nervous because they're looking at
[03:35:23.240 --> 03:35:28.840]  the same polls as me that show as I said generations evening the most
[03:35:28.840 --> 03:35:33.120]  conservative generation since World War two they're looking at the same numbers
[03:35:33.120 --> 03:35:38.480]  they're panicked they're nervous they're having to reassure themselves that they
[03:35:38.480 --> 03:35:44.680]  have the monopoly on the counterculture and they did they have for so long that's
[03:35:44.680 --> 03:35:49.960]  how they became the dominant culture you can't be the dominant culture and the
[03:35:49.960 --> 03:35:55.400]  counterculture when are you gonna get that when all the celebrities on the
[03:35:55.400 --> 03:36:00.760]  left virtue signal they all share the same opinions that's not counterculture
[03:36:00.760 --> 03:36:06.600]  anymore it's pretty simple concept to understand and they and the back of their
[03:36:06.600 --> 03:36:10.600]  minds I think they really do understand it which is why they're so nervous which
[03:36:10.600 --> 03:36:15.040]  is why they have to write these panicked articles the past four months since I
[03:36:15.040 --> 03:36:20.600]  said I don't even say it that much on Twitter anymore they bring it up this
[03:36:20.600 --> 03:36:25.280]  really I'm gonna start saying it more I'm gonna start saying it every day once
[03:36:25.280 --> 03:36:30.040]  again conservatism is the new counterculture because this really gets
[03:36:30.040 --> 03:36:33.960]  under their skin I'm gonna resurrect it and it's gonna come back stronger than
[03:36:33.960 --> 03:36:39.640]  ever how do you like them apples absolutely hilarious stuff speaking of
[03:36:39.640 --> 03:36:46.120]  hilarious the BBC came out with a cartoon this is actually in a December 2016
[03:36:46.120 --> 03:36:52.320]  production it was an educational cartoon for kids about Roman Britain they
[03:36:52.320 --> 03:36:58.200]  chose to depict a quote typical their word not mine typical Roman family in
[03:36:58.200 --> 03:37:05.000]  Britain 1500 years ago as black now why do you think they did that do you think
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:09.600]  they did that because a typical Roman family in Roman Britain 1500 years ago
[03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:15.160]  would have been black or because it was politically correct tokenism from the
[03:37:15.160 --> 03:37:22.440]  BBC one of the most if not the most PC obsessed entities in the Western world
[03:37:22.440 --> 03:37:26.880]  which one do you think is more likely well I made a video about this in fact
[03:37:26.880 --> 03:37:32.400]  the original way the issue arose was a tweet I got attacked by some fake supply
[03:37:32.400 --> 03:37:37.720]  teacher who claimed to be a historian the media picked it up JK Rowling picked it
[03:37:37.720 --> 03:37:44.080]  up it got a lot of press attention from outlets that nobody reads basically so
[03:37:44.080 --> 03:37:47.640]  it turned into a bit of a thing I made a video about it this is the video I'm
[03:37:47.640 --> 03:37:51.800]  gonna come back and talk about it after because this has only got funnier in the
[03:37:51.800 --> 03:37:58.120]  two days since here's the video about the BBC and historians self-proclaimed
[03:37:58.120 --> 03:38:03.760]  literally trying to rewrite history to claim that Roman Britain was ethnically
[03:38:03.760 --> 03:38:10.360]  diverse 1500 years ago here's the video the BBC released an educational
[03:38:10.360 --> 03:38:14.160]  documentary about Roman Britain depicting what they said was quote an
[03:38:14.160 --> 03:38:19.080]  exploration of life in Roman Britain shown through the eyes of a typical
[03:38:19.080 --> 03:38:24.280]  family this is how they chose to depict a typical family in Roman Britain over
[03:38:24.280 --> 03:38:29.200]  1500 years ago yeah really I tweeted about it saying it was historically
[03:38:29.200 --> 03:38:34.240]  inaccurate to depict Roman Britain as ethnically diverse making the point that
[03:38:34.240 --> 03:38:39.200]  this was obviously the BBC engaging in politically correct tokenism and that
[03:38:39.200 --> 03:38:43.560]  this wasn't what a typical family in Roman Britain would have looked like oh
[03:38:43.560 --> 03:38:48.960]  and the butthurt was immense verified libtards from every corner of Twitter
[03:38:48.960 --> 03:38:54.280]  exploded with rage including JK Rowling who still hasn't got back to me on why
[03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:59.120]  she virtue signals all day about refugees yet still hasn't taken in any
[03:38:59.120 --> 03:39:03.920]  refugees despite owning multiple mansions and having umpteen empty spare
[03:39:03.920 --> 03:39:08.880]  bedrooms she then retweeted this tweet storm from a self-proclaimed historian
[03:39:08.880 --> 03:39:15.040]  supply teacher let's call him mr. potato head who proceeded to school me on how
[03:39:15.040 --> 03:39:20.120]  Roman Britain really was ethnically diverse except he didn't school me on
[03:39:20.120 --> 03:39:26.400]  anything he's called himself on being a retard what was mr. potato heads evidence
[03:39:26.400 --> 03:39:30.960]  that Roman Britain was ethnically diverse well first I'm a fascist which
[03:39:30.960 --> 03:39:35.600]  last time I checked isn't an argument second that provincial governors in
[03:39:35.600 --> 03:39:39.360]  Roman Britain had black slaves and third that they found the skeleton of a
[03:39:39.360 --> 03:39:44.520]  North African woman who lived in Roman London and that's it so mr. potato head
[03:39:44.520 --> 03:39:49.120]  schooling me consisted of him proving there were a smattering of non-white
[03:39:49.120 --> 03:39:53.160]  people living in Roman Britain which is not the same thing as proving that
[03:39:53.160 --> 03:39:58.720]  Roman Britain was ethnically diverse it wasn't and this isn't a typical
[03:39:58.720 --> 03:40:03.440]  depiction of a family in Roman Britain there is some evidence of migration to
[03:40:03.440 --> 03:40:06.960]  Roman Britain from other parts of the Empire but there is considerable
[03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:10.320]  evidence to suggest that the population of Roman Britain remained
[03:40:10.320 --> 03:40:15.240]  overwhelmingly indigenous including the army's dependence there were probably
[03:40:15.240 --> 03:40:20.080]  125,000 migrants in the British Isles out of a population of 4 million which is
[03:40:20.080 --> 03:40:25.880]  about 3% it would be as ludicrous as going to a country that's 97% black and
[03:40:25.880 --> 03:40:31.120]  then claiming that this is an accurate representation of a typical family
[03:40:31.120 --> 03:40:35.920]  living in that country a small amount of non-white people living in a country
[03:40:35.920 --> 03:40:40.800]  doesn't make it ethnically diverse that's clearly an outlier not a
[03:40:40.800 --> 03:40:45.480]  reflection of widespread ethnic diversity that's like saying Japan is
[03:40:45.480 --> 03:40:51.320]  ethnically diverse because 1.5% of people living in Japan on ethnically
[03:40:51.320 --> 03:40:58.520]  Japanese Japan is 98.5% Japanese that's not ethnically diverse when I asked
[03:40:58.520 --> 03:41:03.800]  mr. potato head directly what percentage of Roman Britons were non-white he
[03:41:03.800 --> 03:41:07.560]  admitted there was no way of knowing but that Roman Britain definitely wasn't
[03:41:07.560 --> 03:41:12.280]  homogeneous except I never said it was homogeneous I also never said it was
[03:41:12.280 --> 03:41:17.560]  mono-racial yeah little tip for you mr. potato head if you school me on an
[03:41:17.560 --> 03:41:22.200]  argument that I never made mmm that's not schooling me that's called a straw
[03:41:22.200 --> 03:41:27.400]  man and a complete misrepresentation of my argument you called me a retard yet
[03:41:27.400 --> 03:41:32.160]  you can't read who's the retard no one is denying that there were a small amount
[03:41:32.160 --> 03:41:37.560]  of non-white people in Roman Britain that's not the argument the fact that
[03:41:37.560 --> 03:41:41.200]  there were a smattering of non-white people in Roman Britain doesn't mean
[03:41:41.200 --> 03:41:46.000]  that Roman Britain was ethnically diverse by today's standards to the point
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:50.880]  where a typical family in Roman Britain would be depicted as black let's look
[03:41:50.880 --> 03:41:55.240]  at some other depictions of Roman Britain so given that this is how the BBC
[03:41:55.240 --> 03:41:59.560]  thinks Roman Britain should accurately be depicted what kind of racist would
[03:41:59.560 --> 03:42:04.480]  depict Roman Britain like this no black people in that image oh look it's the
[03:42:04.480 --> 03:42:11.960]  BBC this is how the BBC chose to depict Roman Britain back in 2003 back then
[03:42:11.960 --> 03:42:17.120]  everyone in the BBC's depiction of Roman Britain was white right so what's
[03:42:17.120 --> 03:42:23.840]  changed between 2003 and 2017 did we suddenly reverse 2,000 years of
[03:42:23.840 --> 03:42:27.920]  knowledge and figure out that Roman Britain was in fact ethnically diverse
[03:42:27.920 --> 03:42:33.440]  or did the BBC which is so politically correct when it comes to race that it
[03:42:33.440 --> 03:42:37.400]  literally banned white people from applying for jobs during that time
[03:42:37.400 --> 03:42:42.080]  period become obsessed with political correctness and racial tokenism which
[03:42:42.080 --> 03:42:47.920]  is the more likely scenario hmm I wonder here's another depiction of Roman
[03:42:47.920 --> 03:42:51.600]  Britain Queen Boudicca leading a rebellion against the Romans yeah a lot
[03:42:51.600 --> 03:42:54.920]  of honkies in that painting here's another depiction of Roman Britain a
[03:42:54.920 --> 03:42:58.240]  famous painting called Britain's deploring departure of the last Roman
[03:42:58.240 --> 03:43:02.400]  Legion yeah I don't see many black people here's the Natural History Museum's
[03:43:02.400 --> 03:43:06.880]  illustration of daily life in Roman London you'll notice a distinct lack of
[03:43:06.880 --> 03:43:11.480]  melanin here's another famous painting of a family of ancient Britons in Roman
[03:43:11.480 --> 03:43:16.320]  Britain yeah a lot of whiteies there here's another is this a more accurate
[03:43:16.320 --> 03:43:21.600]  depiction of a typical family in Roman Britain or is this so either Roman
[03:43:21.600 --> 03:43:25.920]  Britain wasn't ethnically diverse by today's standards and all these
[03:43:25.920 --> 03:43:29.440]  depictions of Roman Britain stretching back hundreds of years are
[03:43:29.440 --> 03:43:34.400]  consistently accurate in depicting that or every single one of these
[03:43:34.400 --> 03:43:41.160]  depictions is wrong and this one BBC depiction from 2017 is accurate which is
[03:43:41.160 --> 03:43:46.040]  the more likely scenario to portray a typical family again their words not mine
[03:43:46.040 --> 03:43:52.240]  in Roman Britain as black is not typical it would be incredibly rare which is why
[03:43:52.240 --> 03:43:57.440]  virtually every other depiction of Roman Britain doesn't do this the BBC did
[03:43:57.440 --> 03:44:02.080]  it for politically correct tokenism at the expense of historical accuracy
[03:44:02.080 --> 03:44:06.320]  that's the argument I made and it's patently true this is an ethnically
[03:44:06.320 --> 03:44:11.520]  diverse Britain this isn't Roman Britain clearly wasn't ethnically diverse by
[03:44:11.520 --> 03:44:16.400]  today's standards here's the BBC's next educational cartoon an insight into how
[03:44:16.400 --> 03:44:20.040]  British women lived during the Victorian era historians say it's
[03:44:20.040 --> 03:44:24.600]  stunningly accurate tomorrow on BBC one we look at how Vikings invaded and
[03:44:24.600 --> 03:44:28.760]  occupied England from the 8th century onwards stunningly accurate oh yeah and
[03:44:28.760 --> 03:44:33.280]  just like flies around the usual gaggle of UK leftist hits the twats
[03:44:33.280 --> 03:44:37.600]  descended on this mashable the independent who by the way right
[03:44:37.600 --> 03:44:42.400]  endless hit pieces on me while begging for an interview and l magazine this
[03:44:42.400 --> 03:44:45.480]  history buffs take down of a political correctness gone mad tweet is everything
[03:44:45.480 --> 03:44:48.480]  we needed today a black James Bond that's political correctness gone mad a
[03:44:48.480 --> 03:44:51.280]  cartoon rest the ferry and mouse that's political correctness gone mad yeah can
[03:44:51.280 --> 03:44:56.160]  you enlighten me please l magazine and how people getting mad over fictional
[03:44:56.160 --> 03:45:01.320]  TV and movie characters which I said nothing about as anything to do with a
[03:45:01.320 --> 03:45:06.400]  debate about historical accuracy oh but mr. potato head owned me how are you
[03:45:06.400 --> 03:45:10.120]  gonna own me when you can't even own the fact that your hairline has itself
[03:45:10.120 --> 03:45:16.040]  receded back to Roman times just shave it off yeah and wearing cats on your
[03:45:16.040 --> 03:45:22.720]  head isn't a long-term solution this guy's so PC obsessed he gets triggered
[03:45:22.720 --> 03:45:28.280]  by images of Templar night she posted a long diatribe his pants about me making
[03:45:28.280 --> 03:45:33.320]  this video so you attack me publicly get all your verified libtard friends to
[03:45:33.320 --> 03:45:40.320]  pile in and then when I dare to respond you go crying a corner they love to dish
[03:45:40.320 --> 03:45:44.640]  it out don't they not so good at taking it back though I mean do I even need to
[03:45:44.640 --> 03:45:48.760]  roast this guy considering he got roasted by his own politically correct
[03:45:48.760 --> 03:45:54.080]  obsessed fan base for using an offensive word and had to apologize for it
[03:45:54.080 --> 03:45:58.600]  this is a guy who was in the news for trying to ban the word banter in school
[03:45:58.600 --> 03:46:03.520]  classrooms because someone's feelings might get hurt banter is another word
[03:46:03.520 --> 03:46:08.880]  for fun and now it all starts to make sense mr. potato head is a hysterical
[03:46:08.880 --> 03:46:13.800]  leftist blob obsessed with political correctness who got triggered by me
[03:46:13.800 --> 03:46:18.120]  pointing out reality and triggered the reality that the BBC depicting black
[03:46:18.120 --> 03:46:23.000]  people as a typical family in Roman Britain was clearly a clumsy attempt to
[03:46:23.000 --> 03:46:27.640]  inject politically correct propaganda into a cartoon aimed at children it
[03:46:27.640 --> 03:46:32.480]  wasn't historically accurate by today's standards Roman Britain wasn't
[03:46:32.480 --> 03:46:36.720]  ethnically diverse you didn't school me on anything you didn't even address my
[03:46:36.720 --> 03:46:40.920]  argument you're a self-proclaimed historian who's literally trying to
[03:46:40.920 --> 03:46:46.240]  rewrite history to fit your political agenda the lie that Britain has always
[03:46:46.240 --> 03:46:51.000]  been ethnically diverse it hasn't you're trying to posh the myth that mass
[03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:54.960]  uncontrolled immigration is natural because it's always been that way
[03:46:54.960 --> 03:46:59.420]  immigration into Britain was minimal until the 20th century and no amount of
[03:46:59.420 --> 03:47:05.960]  PC pandering BBC cartoons for kids are ever gonna change that historical fact
[03:47:05.960 --> 03:47:11.240]  mr. potato head you tried to take on the king of the roast and look what happened
[03:47:11.240 --> 03:47:15.960]  you got roasted
[03:47:16.160 --> 03:47:22.040]  there we have it that is video called Paul Joseph Watson got owned tongue-in-cheek
[03:47:22.040 --> 03:47:27.040]  title and this continues today they actually came out with an article in the
[03:47:27.040 --> 03:47:31.640]  independent which by the way as I said in the video literally begged me for an
[03:47:31.640 --> 03:47:35.920]  interview over and over again said no so they proceeded to write hit piece out
[03:47:35.920 --> 03:47:41.200]  to hit piece which is okay because nobody reads them in fact this article when I
[03:47:41.200 --> 03:47:46.360]  looked at it earlier today after you know I was after it had been published it
[03:47:46.360 --> 03:47:53.160]  had one comment that comment was by me so nobody's even reading this stuff the
[03:47:53.160 --> 03:47:58.280]  fact is some of it does get amplified though when people like JK Rowling
[03:47:58.280 --> 03:48:03.360]  virtue signal a supreme retweet it she's got millions of idiotic followers
[03:48:03.360 --> 03:48:08.520]  Twitter is a big echo chamber it gets media attention I respond to it oh
[03:48:08.520 --> 03:48:12.800]  you're triggered now there's a difference between being triggered for
[03:48:12.800 --> 03:48:17.560]  example by an image of Nigel Farage as the left is or an image of a Templar
[03:48:17.560 --> 03:48:21.960]  Knight like this potato head fake historian was there's a difference
[03:48:21.960 --> 03:48:27.440]  between that and responding to attacks on you by the media okay big difference
[03:48:27.440 --> 03:48:31.560]  get your own insult isn't it amazing that the word triggered has been
[03:48:31.560 --> 03:48:36.880]  appropriated by the left because they're so intellectually stunted to think up
[03:48:36.880 --> 03:48:41.400]  their own insults interest in development there but this article out of the
[03:48:41.400 --> 03:48:47.280]  independent if you want to pull it up the headline is this while debunking a
[03:48:47.280 --> 03:48:53.560]  historian this alt-right commentator got owned again so if we just put owned in
[03:48:53.560 --> 03:48:58.320]  the headline that means he was owned okay let's take a look the article says
[03:48:58.320 --> 03:49:01.280]  at the tail end of the rambling monologue they're talking about the video
[03:49:01.280 --> 03:49:05.480]  that you just heard Watson suggests sequels to the BBC educational video
[03:49:05.480 --> 03:49:09.600]  including an insight into how British women live during the Victorian era
[03:49:09.600 --> 03:49:13.960]  while displaying a picture of women wearing burqas in hijabs and if you

[03:49:18.840 --> 03:49:23.560]  independent independent article you can scroll down in the article they show my
[03:49:23.560 --> 03:49:28.960]  original tweet where I make a joke saying what's the BBC gonna do next are
[03:49:28.960 --> 03:49:33.000]  they're gonna say that this pictures of Muslim women in hijabs are
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:38.440]  representative if you scroll down further of 19 they have it right there
[03:49:38.440 --> 03:49:43.640]  there's a tweet is that representative of 19th century Victorian era women is
[03:49:43.640 --> 03:49:48.040]  that what they're gonna say next is it gonna get that crazy and they came out
[03:49:48.040 --> 03:49:53.680]  in this article and said that I was owned because one person on Twitter pointed
[03:49:53.680 --> 03:50:02.120]  out that a mosque was built in 1889 in the UK in London which is what literally
[03:50:02.120 --> 03:50:07.080]  two years before Queen Victoria died and that because there was one mosque in
[03:50:07.080 --> 03:50:12.400]  London that that means pictures of women in burqas is an accurate
[03:50:12.400 --> 03:50:19.520]  representation of Victorian era Britain they actually made that point and said
[03:50:19.520 --> 03:50:25.040]  that I was owned for saying that that's ridiculous I yeah I got I got owned for
[03:50:25.040 --> 03:50:29.680]  saying showing pictures of Muslim women in burqas and claiming that that's
[03:50:29.680 --> 03:50:35.920]  representative of Victorian era England I got owned for saying that as a joke
[03:50:35.920 --> 03:50:42.440]  absolutely incredible because one mosque existed in London two years before
[03:50:42.440 --> 03:50:46.960]  Queen Victoria died therefore London and England must have just been a wash
[03:50:46.960 --> 03:50:52.400]  with burqa wearing Muslim women right that's literally what they bought and
[03:50:52.400 --> 03:50:57.160]  people get paid to publish this no wonder that absolutely no one reads the
[03:50:57.160 --> 03:51:00.320]  independent that's why I went out of business in the print version in the
