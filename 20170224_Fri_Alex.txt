[00:00.000 --> 00:19.400]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again, you're listening to the Alex
[00:19.400 --> 00:20.400]  Jones show.
[00:20.400 --> 00:27.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, Alex Jones here.
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.920]  I am on the road, I will be in in the next hour, we've got so much to break down, I may
[00:31.920 --> 00:36.360]  even go four or five hours extra today because there is just so much to break down.
[00:36.360 --> 00:41.640]  The critical battles against the globalist are key junctures right now, the way they're
[00:41.640 --> 00:46.040]  trying to basically have a civil war inside the government and block Trump is amazing.
[00:46.040 --> 00:51.000]  The way he's fighting back is absolutely critical and that we support him.
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.600]  We're going to look at the demonization tactics that are taking place, Stephen Colbert misrepresenting
[00:55.600 --> 01:00.640]  what I say and what I do, the same tactics are used on Trump and ways to further mobilize
[01:00.640 --> 01:04.560]  the base to ensure that we defeat this entire program.
[01:04.560 --> 01:07.800]  We also have the Judas Code, Glenn Beck going on all these shows saying Stephen Bannon is
[01:07.800 --> 01:10.520]  dangerous because he's, quote, a nationalist.
[01:10.520 --> 01:14.400]  Glenn Beck is openly declaring himself a globalist, he's always been one to control
[01:14.400 --> 01:15.400]  the movement.
[01:15.400 --> 01:18.960]  And see, they were going to ban conservative and libertarian media this year, Hillary had
[01:18.960 --> 01:21.080]  admitted that when she got elected.
[01:21.080 --> 01:22.840]  And so they're still going to have that program.
[01:22.840 --> 01:26.480]  Beck thought he sided with the winners and he was going to be the representative now
[01:26.480 --> 01:27.480]  of the conservatives.
[01:27.480 --> 01:32.840]  He was going to be the fake conservative who then play along with their system as controlled
[01:32.840 --> 01:37.760]  opposition, but they lost because America was in such a critical crisis, finally the
[01:37.760 --> 01:43.000]  intelligence agencies and other patriot groups ensured Hillary couldn't fully steal the election.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.840]  She did steal part of it.
[01:44.840 --> 01:48.320]  And so now they're in such panic mode, they're just going ahead with their program as if
[01:48.320 --> 01:52.160]  Hillary still got elected and that's why the government and the shadow government is
[01:52.160 --> 01:57.640]  behaving as if Trump doesn't exist and the American people don't exist with total arrogance,
[01:57.640 --> 01:58.760]  but they're failing.
[01:58.760 --> 02:02.240]  We have the initiative, we have the upper hand, we have justice on the right side, with
[02:02.240 --> 02:04.560]  history on our side and destiny.
[02:04.560 --> 02:09.680]  But most importantly, pray to God and get on your knees and repent for everything you've
[02:09.680 --> 02:10.680]  done.
[02:10.680 --> 02:14.280]  I do as well and humble our souls before the Lord and ask God for guidance and to lift
[02:14.280 --> 02:18.320]  the scales from our fellow countrymen and women's eyes and others around the globe.
[02:18.320 --> 02:19.560]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:19.560 --> 02:23.680]  This is the Info War and you are the key, the critical anchor to that whole thing.
[02:23.680 --> 02:28.280]  In the last two days, we've seen massive unprecedented support coming in since the Google banned
[02:28.280 --> 02:34.520]  us through AdRoll from being able to online advertise just incredible jackboot chilling
[02:34.520 --> 02:35.520]  effect censorship.
[02:35.520 --> 02:38.240]  But we're going to find ways to defeat that thanks to your support.
[02:38.240 --> 02:39.240]  So thank you all.
[02:39.240 --> 02:41.640]  Now, back to the live transmission from Austin, Texas.
[02:41.640 --> 02:42.640]  All right.
[02:42.640 --> 02:46.160]  I'm David Knight and it's Friday, February 24th, 2017.
[02:46.160 --> 02:49.520]  We're going to have as our special guest for the next hour, Donald Trump.
[02:49.520 --> 02:50.520]  No, not as an interview.
[02:50.520 --> 02:54.120]  We're going to have his speech from CPAC and we're going to play that for you in its entirety
[02:54.120 --> 02:55.120]  with comments.
[02:55.120 --> 02:58.720]  But I have to say that as we're looking at the news coming out of CPAC, we've also seen
[02:58.720 --> 03:03.960]  an announcement from Ted Cruz saying that he believes that SCOTUS vacancy is just a
[03:03.960 --> 03:04.960]  few months away.
[03:04.960 --> 03:09.040]  He thinks by this summer, we're going to have someone who is going to leave the Supreme
[03:09.040 --> 03:10.040]  Court.
[03:10.040 --> 03:13.680]  Many people expect that's going to be Anthony Kennedy, a guy who's been there since Reagan
[03:13.680 --> 03:14.680]  appointed him.
[03:14.680 --> 03:19.400]  But he has been a swing justice, swinging to the left repeatedly.
[03:19.400 --> 03:20.920]  Why does he swing to the left?
[03:20.920 --> 03:26.920]  Well, because he looks to foreign law, international law to interpret the Constitution.
[03:26.920 --> 03:30.640]  Sorry, that's not how you interpret the Constitution.
[03:30.640 --> 03:34.560]  Another person who is off the track, of course, is Glenn Beck, as Alex Jones just pointed
[03:34.560 --> 03:35.560]  out.
[03:35.560 --> 03:37.680]  He used to think of him simply as a plagiarist.
[03:37.680 --> 03:40.080]  No, he's an enemy of the Constitution.
[03:40.080 --> 03:42.600]  He is an outright liar and subverter.
[03:42.600 --> 03:43.960]  And let me give you an example of this.
[03:43.960 --> 03:48.920]  He said that Steve Bannon's economic nationalism agenda is not conservative.
[03:48.920 --> 03:49.920]  Well you know what?
[03:49.920 --> 03:55.440]  We're not proposing going as radical as the Founding Fathers did.
[03:55.440 --> 03:56.440]  People like Thomas Jefferson.
[03:56.440 --> 04:00.480]  I've repeated this over and over again, the fact that Thomas Jefferson said on his second
[04:00.480 --> 04:05.160]  inaugural address that in his first term, he eliminated all internal taxation, which
[04:05.160 --> 04:06.160]  is very small.
[04:06.160 --> 04:12.600]  And he was able to support the government entirely on taxes and tariffs at the border.
[04:12.600 --> 04:14.480]  Now that was American foreign policy, folks.
[04:14.480 --> 04:20.720]  We funded our government pretty much exclusively on tariffs coming into this country.
[04:20.720 --> 04:25.960]  Until 1913, when we created the income tax and we created the Federal Reserve and we
[04:25.960 --> 04:32.120]  went to a situation where we started taxing citizens and not goods crossing the border.
[04:32.120 --> 04:33.640]  How's that worked out for us?
[04:33.640 --> 04:35.720]  Say, that's where this all comes together.
[04:35.720 --> 04:41.760]  The central banks, the globalists, Glenn Beck is now in that boat with them rowing as hard
[04:41.760 --> 04:46.200]  as he can in the opposite direction of Donald Trump and of Steve Bannon.
[04:46.200 --> 04:48.600]  I talked about this on Wednesday night on the Nightly News.
[04:48.600 --> 04:51.880]  We talked about how important it is that we not lose Bannon's voice.
[04:51.880 --> 04:53.200]  It's been a very important advisor.
[04:53.200 --> 04:55.600]  We'll be back with Donald Trump's speech at CPAC.
[04:55.600 --> 05:00.440]  Stay with us.
[05:00.440 --> 05:05.480]  President Trump's administration on Wednesday night withdrew Obama's guidance on transgender
[05:05.480 --> 05:07.880]  bathroom use in public schools.
[05:07.880 --> 05:12.600]  Now radical liberals are calling for violent protests in the streets.
[05:12.600 --> 05:18.480]  George DeKai from the original Star Trek tweeted out, the Trump administration's war on the
[05:18.480 --> 05:21.120]  LGBT community has begun.
[05:21.120 --> 05:23.880]  Be prepared to take our fight to the street.
[05:23.880 --> 05:26.560]  Are you with us, LGBT allies?
[05:26.560 --> 05:27.960]  But he wasn't done.
[05:27.960 --> 05:32.080]  Hours later, he tweeted that an American spring is coming.
[05:32.080 --> 05:37.560]  The radical left is demanding tolerance and threatening violence if they don't get special
[05:37.560 --> 05:40.240]  privileges in the name of tolerance.
[05:40.240 --> 05:45.640]  Yet they themselves practice extreme intolerance toward conservatives.
[05:45.640 --> 05:50.560]  So the question is, should we be tolerant toward their intolerance?
[05:50.560 --> 05:53.960]  Because after all, tolerance is a two-way street.
[05:53.960 --> 06:00.040]  This is Milly Weaver reporting for Infowars.com.
[06:00.040 --> 06:01.880]  Today we call it bone broth.
[06:01.880 --> 06:06.080]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss
[06:06.080 --> 06:08.440]  to our modern diets of processed junk.
[06:08.440 --> 06:13.680]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[06:13.680 --> 06:19.840]  bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[06:19.840 --> 06:21.320]  great tasting formula.
[06:21.320 --> 06:22.320]  Caveman.
[06:22.320 --> 06:26.240]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[06:26.240 --> 06:27.240]  superior ancestors.
[06:27.240 --> 06:30.240]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[06:30.240 --> 06:32.880]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[06:32.880 --> 06:38.080]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[06:38.080 --> 06:42.400]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces
[06:42.400 --> 06:46.040]  the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[06:46.040 --> 06:50.400]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[06:50.400 --> 06:54.000]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.360]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[06:57.360 --> 06:59.720]  at InfowarsLife.com today.
[06:59.720 --> 07:04.240]  You're investing in your health and supporting the Infowar when you visit InfowarsLife.com
[07:04.240 --> 07:08.720]  and purchase your supply of survival shield x2 nascent iodine, and all the great products
[07:08.720 --> 07:09.720]  at InfowarsLife.com.
[07:09.720 --> 07:14.360]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists,
[07:14.360 --> 07:16.440]  and the answer is clear.
[07:16.440 --> 07:21.080]  Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out that we
[07:21.080 --> 07:23.280]  simply can't even keep up with it.
[07:23.280 --> 07:28.680]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these
[07:28.680 --> 07:32.200]  purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[07:32.200 --> 07:36.120]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[07:36.120 --> 07:39.040]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[07:39.040 --> 07:43.240]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[07:43.240 --> 07:47.600]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[07:47.600 --> 07:51.880]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[07:51.880 --> 08:17.560]  It is exclusive to InfowarsLife.com and the InfowarsLife family of incredible products.
[08:17.560 --> 08:24.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[08:24.160 --> 08:28.280]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:28.280 --> 08:31.840]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show in this Friday, February 24, 2017.
[08:31.840 --> 08:32.840]  I'm David Knight.
[08:32.840 --> 08:37.520]  We're going to have a special guest for you, as I said, jokingly in the last segment, Donald
[08:37.520 --> 08:38.520]  Trump.
[08:38.520 --> 08:40.160]  Now, we're going to play his speech from CPAC.
[08:40.160 --> 08:44.640]  We're going to play the speech in its entirety, and that's coming up in just one moment before
[08:44.640 --> 08:45.640]  we do.
[08:45.640 --> 08:52.040]  I want to look at what we've seen also from CPAC, rather, that Ted Cruz says, another
[08:52.040 --> 08:54.440]  SCOTUS vacancy is just months away.
[08:54.440 --> 08:58.720]  He says, we may have another Supreme Court vacancy this summer, if that happens.
[08:58.720 --> 09:03.560]  As much as the left is crazy now, they will go full Armageddon meltdown because the next
[09:03.560 --> 09:07.760]  vacancy is where we'll have the ability to act and restore basic constitution protection.
[09:07.760 --> 09:12.880]  So what he's talking about is the fact that replacing Scalia, who was put in by Ronald
[09:12.880 --> 09:18.160]  Reagan and died, of course, about a year ago in office, replacing Scalia with a conservative
[09:18.160 --> 09:20.840]  justice has not changed the balance of the court.
[09:20.840 --> 09:26.120]  That's why Neil Gorsuch's nomination should not be a controversial issue.
[09:26.120 --> 09:30.640]  However, somebody else that changes now, it's going to move the court.
[09:30.640 --> 09:34.800]  If Donald Trump puts somebody like Neil Gorsuch in, or if he puts a conservative in, that
[09:34.800 --> 09:38.840]  could very well change the balance of the court, especially since most of the older
[09:38.840 --> 09:42.120]  justices are leaning to the left, like Kennedy.
[09:42.120 --> 09:46.360]  And he's the one that people believe is going to be the one, is going to be the next one
[09:46.360 --> 09:47.360]  to go.
[09:47.360 --> 09:49.640]  They've been talking about it since last fall.
[09:49.640 --> 09:55.960]  And some other justices have, their names have come up, but they've been put down essentially.
[09:55.960 --> 09:59.320]  Justice Clarence Thomas was mentioned, but of course his wife said, no, no, he's not
[09:59.320 --> 10:00.960]  looking to get out.
[10:00.960 --> 10:05.240]  When you look at Kennedy, he's been a swing justice because he interprets the law, not
[10:05.240 --> 10:06.240]  the way Scalia did.
[10:06.240 --> 10:11.920]  Scalia interpreted things by the Constitution, by original intent of our founders, by the
[10:11.920 --> 10:15.160]  intentions that they recorded when they were debating the Constitution.
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.600]  But Justice Kennedy would turn to international and foreign law.
[10:19.600 --> 10:23.960]  And that's when he would side with the left, because the left doesn't like the Constitution.
[10:23.960 --> 10:25.840]  They're looking at any way to escape it.
[10:25.840 --> 10:31.560]  So he has been at best a swing justice, but in recent years he's been moving far to the
[10:31.560 --> 10:32.560]  left.
[10:32.560 --> 10:34.240]  So that would be a very, very important thing.
[10:34.240 --> 10:37.600]  And of course, we may have, when you look at the ages and the health conditions of these
[10:37.600 --> 10:41.440]  justices, Donald Trump could have four appointments.
[10:41.440 --> 10:44.160]  So it would not be surprising to see another one this summer.
[10:44.160 --> 10:49.960]  Without further delay, let's get to the speech that Donald Trump gave earlier at CPAC.
[10:49.960 --> 10:52.680]  And let's cut to that right now.
[10:52.680 --> 11:19.680]  It is my honor to introduce to CPAC 2017 our president, Donald Trump.
[11:19.680 --> 11:23.680]  Hey.
[11:23.680 --> 11:37.200]  You gave the night to me.
[11:37.200 --> 11:46.680]  And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her or still today.
[11:46.680 --> 11:53.000]  It may be safe to say the crowd likes him.
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.000]  Is he conservative?
[11:54.000 --> 11:55.000]  They think he is.
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.000]  It's great to be with you.
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.000]  Thank you.
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  It's great to be back at C-Pack.
[12:02.000 --> 12:13.000]  It's a place I have really, I love this place, love you people.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.560]  So, thank you.
[12:17.560 --> 12:18.560]  Thank you very much.
[12:18.560 --> 12:27.320]  First of all, I want to thank Matt Schlapp and his very, very incredible wife.
[12:27.320 --> 12:35.600]  And boss, Mercedes, who have been fantastic friends and supporters, and so great when
[12:35.600 --> 12:37.960]  I watched them on television defending me.
[12:37.960 --> 12:38.960]  Nobody has a chance.
[12:38.960 --> 12:45.400]  So I want to thank Matt and Mercedes.
[12:45.400 --> 12:53.360]  And when Matt called and asked, I said, absolutely, I'll be there with you.
[12:53.360 --> 12:57.880]  I mean, the real reason I said it, I didn't want him to go against me, because that one
[12:57.880 --> 12:59.380]  you can't be.
[12:59.380 --> 13:03.720]  So I said, absolutely, and it really is an honor to be here.
[13:03.720 --> 13:07.440]  I wouldn't miss a chance to talk to my friends.
[13:07.440 --> 13:15.680]  He's on my friends.
[13:15.680 --> 13:21.840]  And we'll see you again next year, and the year after that, and I'll be doing this, I'll
[13:21.840 --> 13:28.440]  be doing this with C-Pack whenever I can, and I'll make sure that we're here a lot.
[13:28.440 --> 13:35.080]  You know, if you remember my first major speech, sit down, everybody, come on.
[13:35.080 --> 13:39.280]  You know, the dishonest media, they'll say, he didn't get a standing ovation.
[13:39.280 --> 13:40.280]  You know why?
[13:40.280 --> 13:42.560]  No, you know why?
[13:42.560 --> 13:47.960]  Because everybody stood and nobody sat, so they will say he never got a standing ovation.
[13:47.960 --> 13:48.960]  Right?
[13:48.960 --> 14:17.720]  They are the worst.
[14:17.720 --> 14:21.320]  So this is sit down.
[14:21.320 --> 14:25.840]  Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation.
[14:25.840 --> 14:27.520]  They leave out the part.
[14:27.520 --> 14:28.840]  They never sat down.
[14:28.840 --> 14:30.840]  They leave that out.
[14:30.840 --> 14:31.840]  So I just want to thank.
[14:31.840 --> 14:37.720]  But you know, my first major speech was at C-Pack, and probably five or six years ago,
[14:37.720 --> 14:41.320]  first major political speech, and you were there.
[14:41.320 --> 14:42.320]  And I loved it.
[14:42.320 --> 14:43.320]  I loved the people.
[14:43.320 --> 14:45.520]  I loved the commotion.
[14:45.520 --> 14:49.240]  And then they did these polls where I went through the roof, and I wasn't even running.
[14:49.240 --> 14:50.240]  Right?
[14:50.240 --> 14:53.440]  But it gave me an idea.
[14:53.440 --> 14:58.880]  And I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country.
[14:58.880 --> 15:00.320]  And I said, let's go to it.
[15:00.320 --> 15:02.480]  So it was very exciting.
[15:02.480 --> 15:05.600]  I walked the stage on C-Pack.
[15:05.600 --> 15:07.680]  I'll never forget it, really.
[15:07.680 --> 15:14.360]  I had very little notes and even less preparation.
[15:14.360 --> 15:19.160]  So when you had practically no notes and no preparation, and then you leave, and everybody
[15:19.160 --> 15:24.280]  was thrilled, I said, I think I like this business.
[15:24.280 --> 15:30.480]  I would have come last year, but I was worried that I would be, at that time, too controversial.
[15:30.480 --> 15:32.720]  We wanted border security.
[15:32.720 --> 15:35.440]  We wanted very, very strong military.
[15:35.440 --> 15:40.080]  We wanted all of the things that we're going to get, and people considered that controversial.
[15:40.080 --> 15:46.720]  But you didn't consider it controversial.
[15:46.720 --> 15:50.560]  So I've been with C-Pack for a long time, all of these years.
[15:50.560 --> 15:51.560]  We've been together.
[15:51.560 --> 15:54.200]  And now you finally have a president.
[15:54.200 --> 15:55.200]  Finally.
[15:55.200 --> 15:56.200]  Took you a long time.
[15:56.200 --> 15:57.200]  Took you a long time.
[15:57.200 --> 16:05.760]  And it's patriots like you that made it happen.
[16:05.760 --> 16:06.760]  Believe me.
[16:06.760 --> 16:07.760]  Believe me.
[16:07.760 --> 16:13.280]  You did it because you love your country, because you want a better future for your children,
[16:13.280 --> 16:22.800]  and because you want to make America great again.
[16:22.800 --> 16:29.800]  The media didn't think we would win.
[16:29.800 --> 16:36.440]  The pundits, you're right, they had an idea.
[16:36.440 --> 16:39.360]  The pundits didn't think we'd win.
[16:39.360 --> 16:46.640]  The consultants that suck up all that money, oh, they suck it up, they're so good.
[16:46.640 --> 16:54.240]  They're not good at politics, but they're really good at sucking up people's money.
[16:54.240 --> 16:58.240]  Especially my opponents, because I kept them down to a minimum.
[16:58.240 --> 17:04.760]  But the consultants didn't think we would win, but they all underestimated the power
[17:04.760 --> 17:06.680]  of the people, you.
[17:06.680 --> 17:11.160]  And the people proved them totally wrong.
[17:11.160 --> 17:20.440]  Never underestimate the people, never.
[17:20.440 --> 17:27.400]  I don't think it'll ever happen again.
[17:27.400 --> 17:31.120]  And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news.
[17:31.120 --> 17:32.120]  It's fake.
[17:32.120 --> 17:38.800]  It's fake.
[17:38.800 --> 17:43.840]  A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people, and they are.
[17:43.840 --> 17:48.440]  They are the enemy of the people.
[17:48.440 --> 17:54.520]  Because they have no sources, they just make them up when there are none.
[17:54.520 --> 17:59.000]  I saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed.
[17:59.000 --> 18:00.360]  There are no nine people.
[18:00.360 --> 18:04.040]  I don't believe there was one or two people, nine people.
[18:04.040 --> 18:07.000]  And I said, give me a break, because I know the people.
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.960]  I know who they talk to.
[18:08.960 --> 18:11.520]  There were no nine people, but they say nine people.
[18:11.520 --> 18:14.520]  And somebody reads it, they think, oh, nine people, they have nine sources.
[18:14.520 --> 18:16.400]  They make up sources.
[18:16.400 --> 18:17.720]  They're very dishonest people.
[18:17.720 --> 18:25.040]  In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake
[18:25.040 --> 18:28.840]  news the enemy of the people, the fakeness.
[18:28.840 --> 18:32.440]  They dropped off the word fake.
[18:32.440 --> 18:38.360]  And all of a sudden, the story became the media is the enemy.
[18:38.360 --> 18:41.040]  They take the word fake out.
[18:41.040 --> 18:44.160]  And now I'm saying, oh, no, this is no good.
[18:44.160 --> 18:47.320]  But that's the way they are.
[18:47.320 --> 18:49.080]  So I'm not against the media.
[18:49.080 --> 18:51.240]  I'm not against the press.
[18:51.240 --> 18:54.760]  I don't mind bad stories if I deserve them.
[18:54.760 --> 18:59.720]  And I tell you, I love good stories, but we won't.
[18:59.720 --> 19:02.600]  I don't get too many.
[19:02.600 --> 19:10.800]  But I am only against the fake news media or press fake, fake, I have to leave that word.
[19:10.800 --> 19:16.800]  I'm against the people that make up stories and make up sources.
[19:16.800 --> 19:23.040]  They shouldn't be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody's name.
[19:23.040 --> 19:25.080]  Let their name be put out there.
[19:25.080 --> 19:28.200]  Let their name be put out.
[19:28.200 --> 19:34.800]  A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being.
[19:34.800 --> 19:38.480]  Let him say it to my face.
[19:38.480 --> 19:45.200]  Let there be no more sources.
[19:45.200 --> 19:49.880]  And remember this, and in not all cases, I mean, I had a story written yesterday about
[19:49.880 --> 19:53.040]  me in Reuters by a very honorable man.
[19:53.040 --> 19:54.040]  It was a very fair story.
[19:54.040 --> 19:55.040]  All right.
[19:55.040 --> 19:56.040]  We're going to hold that speech.
[19:56.040 --> 19:58.040]  This is a speech that Donald Trump just gave at CPAC.
[19:58.040 --> 20:01.240]  We're going to be right back after the break with more of that speech.
[20:01.240 --> 20:29.440]  We're going to be right back after the break with more of that speech.
[20:29.440 --> 20:59.320]  We're going to be right back after the break with more of that speech.
[20:59.320 --> 21:03.840]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's in an epic battle of David versus
[21:03.840 --> 21:04.840]  Goliath.
[21:04.840 --> 21:08.240]  In the early 1980s, a child was born, two of them actually.
[21:08.240 --> 21:10.320]  Their names were Jeff and Andy.
[21:10.320 --> 21:14.720]  Time went by, they developed facial hair, and one day, something happened.
[21:14.720 --> 21:19.200]  Andy got ripped off by overpriced razors, so they decided to start their own shaving company
[21:19.200 --> 21:21.200]  and fix shaving once and for all.
[21:21.200 --> 21:22.760]  They hired the best designers.
[21:22.760 --> 21:27.120]  They bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started selling high-quality razors
[21:27.120 --> 21:30.160]  online with no upcharging direct-to-customers.
[21:30.160 --> 21:32.480]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[21:32.480 --> 21:34.280]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[21:34.280 --> 21:38.320]  Don't worry, Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to give all
[21:38.320 --> 21:40.960]  guys a great shave at a great price.
[21:40.960 --> 21:41.960]  Try Harry's free.
[21:41.960 --> 21:46.520]  They'll send you a razor with five German blades, foaming shave gel, and even a travel
[21:46.520 --> 21:48.040]  blade cover when you sign up.

[22:27.400 --> 22:33.120]  We use cell phones against our heads every day, but now a landmark U.S. government study
[22:33.120 --> 22:38.240]  confirms increased health risks from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[22:59.280 --> 23:03.360]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated
[23:03.360 --> 23:08.280]  with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines,
[23:08.280 --> 23:11.280]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[23:11.280 --> 23:16.360]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[23:16.360 --> 23:21.560]  Your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, new NSF EPA certified

[24:08.520 --> 24:12.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, February 24, 2017.
[24:12.200 --> 24:13.440]  I'm David Knight.
[24:13.440 --> 24:17.120]  We've been playing and we're going to continue to play for you Donald Trump's speech at
[24:17.120 --> 24:18.120]  CPAC.
[24:18.120 --> 24:21.200]  We're going to get back to that in just one moment, but before we do, I want to remind
[24:21.200 --> 24:28.840]  you of what we were talking about on Wednesday night, the fact that we had a major news agency,
[24:28.840 --> 24:33.360]  ad agency that works as an extension of Google, say we're going to boycott your ads, we're
[24:33.360 --> 24:37.560]  going to block your ads, we're not going to let them get out because you're a political
[24:37.560 --> 24:38.560]  organization.
[24:38.560 --> 24:42.800]  Now we have infowarstore.com, there you can see all the products that we sell to improve
[24:42.800 --> 24:48.360]  your life, your lifestyle, things that will help your health and your family's health,
[24:48.360 --> 24:50.240]  and that's not a political site.
[24:50.240 --> 24:54.240]  It's all about the products that we sell there and the ads that came from that non-political
[24:54.240 --> 24:56.880]  site were not political either.
[24:56.880 --> 25:01.280]  They were pictures of the supplements that we sell, of caveman, of super male vitality,
[25:01.280 --> 25:02.680]  brain force, etc.
[25:02.680 --> 25:04.320]  That's what they blocked.
[25:04.320 --> 25:11.360]  This is like saying because you have somebody who is a CEO at Apple who actively supports
[25:11.360 --> 25:16.560]  Hillary Clinton that you can't have iPhone commercials, that's what they're trying to
[25:16.560 --> 25:17.560]  do.
[25:17.560 --> 25:19.600]  Of course it's a direct attack on us and it is a big attack.
[25:19.600 --> 25:23.640]  So we have asked for your support and you have stepped up and we really appreciate that.
[25:23.640 --> 25:29.160]  So we've extended this mega special that we began on Wednesday with a live 13-hour broadcast
[25:29.160 --> 25:32.880]  that's going to be ending soon at infowarstore.com.
[25:32.880 --> 25:36.680]  That special, some of these most popular items that we sell at the store, silver bullet colloidal
[25:36.680 --> 25:44.520]  silver 33% off stock, super male vitality 25% off, brain force 25% off, survival shield
[25:44.520 --> 25:52.320]  X2 that's our nascent iodine that's 25% off, caveman our new product that's a paleo supplementation,
[25:52.320 --> 25:57.880]  has a bone broth, it has chaga root, it's got seven total primal super foods and a single
[25:57.880 --> 25:58.880]  great tasting formula.
[25:58.880 --> 26:04.320]  So it's basically a mix and you can make a great chocolate milkshake or some kind of
[26:04.320 --> 26:07.400]  a smoothie out of that or you can just mix it with milk or water.
[26:07.400 --> 26:12.480]  It's a great tasting way to get a lot of intense natural supplementation.
[26:12.480 --> 26:17.360]  Of course we had a article that was on Drudge Report today, they've discovered and they've
[26:17.360 --> 26:20.800]  even got some doctors who go shopping with their patients to try to help them to eat
[26:20.800 --> 26:21.800]  healthy.
[26:21.800 --> 26:23.520]  Well that's what we're trying to do here with you as well.
[26:23.520 --> 26:27.680]  We're offering the very best quality food and the kind of things that you don't necessarily
[26:27.680 --> 26:29.640]  get in a standard American diet.
[26:29.640 --> 26:33.320]  You do get a lot of preservatives and chemicals and so you need things to help you fight that
[26:33.320 --> 26:34.320]  as well.
[26:34.320 --> 26:36.160]  Also, so that's caveman at 33% off.
[26:36.160 --> 26:39.640]  We also have lithographs of Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan.
[26:39.640 --> 26:42.000]  These are limited edition lithographs.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.440]  There's only 700 of the classic Reagan lithograph and that was something that was done for the
[26:46.440 --> 26:47.440]  RNC.
[26:47.440 --> 26:50.320]  You've seen the picture before of Ronald Reagan and the cowboy hat.
[26:50.320 --> 26:51.320]  They're very detailed.
[26:51.320 --> 26:55.920]  They're printed on UV resistant premium bond paper, cream colored, clay coated.
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.160]  So we have 700 of the Ronald Reagan as a max that we printed.
[27:00.160 --> 27:04.400]  But I don't know how many of those are left and 2,500 of Donald Trump, which is a new
[27:04.400 --> 27:06.880]  one that we commissioned to do this.
[27:06.880 --> 27:11.840]  And so they're in dark ink on a very special paper and they're limited edition, 2,500 of
[27:11.840 --> 27:16.720]  Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan, only 700 and they are now 1995.
[27:16.720 --> 27:21.520]  So these are all different ways that you can support infowars stand with us as they try
[27:21.520 --> 27:25.960]  to censor our organization by strangling us financially.
[27:25.960 --> 27:31.960]  We created this type of outreach because we didn't want to be vulnerable to boycotts
[27:31.960 --> 27:33.120]  from sponsors.
[27:33.120 --> 27:35.600]  That's the way they've come after Breitbart and other news organizations.
[27:35.600 --> 27:36.600]  So it's not all fine.
[27:36.600 --> 27:41.640]  We'll create our own products, have them with their own separate website.
[27:41.640 --> 27:42.640]  And so then what do they do?
[27:42.640 --> 27:46.080]  They say, well, we're not going to allow you to advertise on the internet.
[27:46.080 --> 27:47.480]  And that's what they're doing to us right now.
[27:47.480 --> 27:49.760]  So we appreciate you standing with us.
[27:49.760 --> 27:55.280]  That sale is about to end some of our most popular products at 25 to 33% off.
[27:55.280 --> 27:58.640]  Let's go back in the time that we have in this break, we've got a long segment coming
[27:58.640 --> 27:59.640]  up.
[27:59.640 --> 28:03.320]  But let's go back to the speech that we had at CPAC earlier today.
[28:03.320 --> 28:05.920]  This is Donald Trump at CPAC.
[28:05.920 --> 28:08.200]  There are some great reporters around.
[28:08.200 --> 28:09.360]  They're talented.
[28:09.360 --> 28:11.480]  They're honest as the day is long.
[28:11.480 --> 28:12.600]  They're great.
[28:12.600 --> 28:17.520]  But there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our
[28:17.520 --> 28:21.040]  country and to our people, a tremendous disservice.
[28:21.040 --> 28:25.080]  They are very dishonest people and they shouldn't use sources.
[28:25.080 --> 28:26.880]  They should put the name of the person.
[28:26.880 --> 28:30.880]  You will see stories dry up like you've never seen before.
[28:30.880 --> 28:36.000]  So you have no idea how bad it is because if you are not part of the story, and I put
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.880]  myself in your position sometimes, because many of you, you're not part of the story.
[28:40.880 --> 28:46.320]  And if you're not part of the story, then you sort of know if you are part of the story,
[28:46.320 --> 28:49.240]  you know what they're saying is true or not.
[28:49.240 --> 28:54.720]  So when they make it up and they make up something else and you saw that before the
[28:54.720 --> 29:02.520]  election, polls, polls, the polls, they come out with these polls and everybody was so
[29:02.520 --> 29:03.520]  surprised.
[29:03.520 --> 29:04.520]  Actually, a couple of polls got it right.
[29:04.520 --> 29:11.880]  I must say Los Angeles Times did a great job, shocking because they did a great job.
[29:11.880 --> 29:16.280]  And we had a couple of others that were right, but generally speaking, I mean, I can tell
[29:16.280 --> 29:22.880]  you the network, somebody said, a poll came out and I say, what network is it?
[29:22.880 --> 29:30.360]  And they'll say a certain, let's not even mention names, right?
[29:30.360 --> 29:32.360]  Sure.
[29:32.360 --> 29:34.640]  Can we see an end?
[29:34.640 --> 29:36.160]  That's where Glenn Beck goes to.
[29:36.160 --> 29:37.160]  You have a lot of them.
[29:37.160 --> 29:40.760]  Look, the Clinton News Network is one.
[29:40.760 --> 29:45.720]  That's where Glenn Beck went to go and say that Bannon is not a conservative.
[29:45.720 --> 29:49.600]  All right, we're going to go break and we're going to be right back with all the speech
[29:49.600 --> 29:50.720]  from Donald Trump.
[29:50.720 --> 30:00.520]  The Empires on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.520 --> 30:05.600]  President Trump's administration on Wednesday night withdrew Obama's guidance on transgender
[30:05.600 --> 30:08.000]  bathroom use in public schools.
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.640]  Now radical liberals are calling for violent protests in the streets.
[30:12.640 --> 30:18.600]  George Dekai from the original Star Trek tweeted out, the Trump administration's war on the
[30:18.600 --> 30:21.240]  LGBT community has begun.
[30:21.240 --> 30:24.000]  Be prepared to take our fight to the street.
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.680]  Are you with us, LGBT allies?
[30:26.680 --> 30:28.080]  But he wasn't done.
[30:28.080 --> 30:32.200]  Hours later, he tweeted that an American spring is coming.
[30:32.200 --> 30:37.640]  The radical left is demanding tolerance and threatening violence if they don't get special
[30:37.640 --> 30:44.320]  privileges in the name of tolerance, yet they themselves practice extreme intolerance toward
[30:44.320 --> 30:45.320]  conservatives.
[30:45.320 --> 30:50.640]  So the question is, should we be tolerant toward their intolerance?
[30:50.640 --> 30:54.080]  Because after all, tolerance is a two way street.
[30:54.080 --> 30:58.520]  This is Milly Weaver reporting for info wars.com.
[30:58.520 --> 31:01.720]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[31:01.720 --> 31:03.720]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:03.720 --> 31:06.600]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:06.600 --> 31:12.640]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:12.640 --> 31:17.600]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[31:17.600 --> 31:22.560]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze, whether it's your home
[31:22.560 --> 31:27.680]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[31:27.680 --> 31:29.400]  you can to purify your air.
[31:29.400 --> 31:34.400]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:34.400 --> 31:39.600]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves, the general public doesn't.
[31:39.600 --> 31:43.540]  The Alexa pure breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:43.540 --> 31:47.160]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:47.160 --> 31:50.720]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more
[31:50.720 --> 31:53.920]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:53.920 --> 32:00.720]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and info wars store.com.
[32:00.720 --> 32:02.080]  This is Alex Jones.
[32:02.080 --> 32:06.440]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off the grid
[32:06.440 --> 32:07.440]  products of 2017.
[32:07.440 --> 32:10.560]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[32:10.560 --> 32:14.200]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from
[32:14.200 --> 32:16.440]  Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[32:16.440 --> 32:21.120]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110
[32:21.120 --> 32:25.480]  appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.
[32:25.480 --> 32:29.880]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18 wheelers, heavy equipment,
[32:29.880 --> 32:31.120]  even airplanes.
[32:31.120 --> 32:34.800]  The system provides an endless supply of off the grid electricity, allowing you to create
[32:34.800 --> 32:38.400]  your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[32:38.400 --> 32:43.000]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[32:43.000 --> 32:46.400]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[32:46.400 --> 32:48.480]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[32:56.600 --> 33:16.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, you're listening to Alex
[33:16.160 --> 33:17.160]  Jones.
[33:17.160 --> 33:22.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, February 24, 2017.
[33:22.640 --> 33:24.080]  I'm David Knight.
[33:24.080 --> 33:28.840]  We're listening to the speech that Donald Trump gave just this morning at CPAC.
[33:28.840 --> 33:29.840]  Great speech.
[33:29.840 --> 33:33.600]  And of course, in the speech, he's attacking, as we stop this, he's attacking CNN.
[33:33.600 --> 33:38.120]  He says, oh, there's all these fake news networks, really fake.
[33:38.120 --> 33:41.520]  I don't want to mention them, and they're all like CNN, and he goes, well, the Clinton
[33:41.520 --> 33:42.520]  News Network.
[33:42.520 --> 33:43.520]  Yeah, exactly.
[33:43.520 --> 33:45.360]  We've got a couple of stories up at infowars.com.
[33:45.360 --> 33:50.120]  Amid CNN leaks, sleuths say nearly half of CNN's Twitter followers are fake.
[33:50.120 --> 33:55.800]  Now, the interesting thing about this story is that, like we continually see with CNN
[33:55.800 --> 34:00.840]  and other organizations, they'll put out fake news about the real news.
[34:00.840 --> 34:05.080]  So the real news is that there's this leak coming out from Project Veritas.
[34:05.080 --> 34:09.440]  So to discredit it, they make up some quotes and put those quotes out, so then they can
[34:09.440 --> 34:12.840]  then come back and say, look, that wasn't real, and all the stuff that you're hearing
[34:12.840 --> 34:14.800]  from Project Veritas is not real.
[34:14.800 --> 34:16.040]  That's their tactic.
[34:16.040 --> 34:17.680]  So they go double fake, if you will.
[34:17.680 --> 34:22.480]  That's almost like 1984, double fake, no, they go double fake.
[34:22.480 --> 34:26.040]  But if you look at it, if you look at Twitter audit, which anybody can do, you can look
[34:26.040 --> 34:29.760]  at any Twitter account and you can see how many of the Twitter followers are real and
[34:29.760 --> 34:31.120]  how many are fake.
[34:31.120 --> 34:35.280]  Now, there's always going to be a certain percentage of fake followers, but if somebody
[34:35.280 --> 34:40.720]  goes out and buys followers, you're going to see that they're going to have a very small
[34:40.720 --> 34:42.600]  percentage of real followers.
[34:42.600 --> 34:47.200]  CNN, only 46% are real, 54% are fake.
[34:47.200 --> 34:52.560]  That should be a warning sign for people that they're out there getting Twitter followers.
[34:52.560 --> 34:57.320]  But even more interesting, I think, it's the fact that Glenn Beck went to CNN of all places
[34:57.320 --> 35:01.320]  to say that Trump and Steve Bannon were not real conservatives.
[35:01.320 --> 35:06.080]  Now, you saw the standing ovation, the multiple standing ovations that Donald Trump got and
[35:06.080 --> 35:07.880]  he said, well, they're going to say that this didn't happen.
[35:07.880 --> 35:11.800]  Now, that's not even as outrageous as what Glenn Beck is saying.
[35:11.800 --> 35:14.960]  He's saying, they're not conservative.
[35:14.960 --> 35:20.760]  You've got Bannon who wants to get rid of bureaucracy in Washington.
[35:20.760 --> 35:25.560]  Says when did bureaucracy in Washington, the administrative state, and this was the lower
[35:25.560 --> 35:32.160]  thirds that went up on CNN, who are Steve Bannon, says the White House goal is, quote, deconstruction
[35:32.160 --> 35:37.240]  of the administrative state to conservative support the administrative state.
[35:37.240 --> 35:38.240]  Maybe they do.
[35:38.240 --> 35:40.920]  Ronald Reagan said he was going to get rid of the Department of Education, but instead
[35:40.920 --> 35:46.000]  of getting rid of it, he made it like eight times larger over his term.
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.160]  And now we've got Glenn Beck out there saying, no, this is economic nationalism.
[35:50.160 --> 35:51.160]  That's not conservative.
[35:51.160 --> 35:52.160]  Yes, it was.
[35:52.160 --> 35:54.280]  Yes, it was.
[35:54.280 --> 36:00.520]  You had a situation, as I pointed out, Thomas Jefferson got rid of all internal taxation,
[36:00.520 --> 36:03.040]  he said in his second inaugural address.
[36:03.040 --> 36:06.880]  And so the entire government, when it was constitutionally sized, of course, we don't
[36:06.880 --> 36:10.080]  have a constitutionally sized government today because we've got this massive administrative
[36:10.080 --> 36:15.440]  state that Glenn Beck loves so dearly that he goes on CNN to say, Trump and Steve Bannon
[36:15.440 --> 36:16.640]  are not real conservatives.
[36:16.640 --> 36:22.240]  I mean, how ironic is that, that he would go on the fake news to say that other people
[36:22.240 --> 36:23.680]  are fake conservatives.
[36:23.680 --> 36:28.040]  This Glenn Beck who's a fake conservative, he's a fake reporter, he's fake news, he's
[36:28.040 --> 36:32.160]  a fake libertarian, he's a fake historian, he's a fake constitutionalist, he's fake.
[36:32.160 --> 36:33.160]  And he's been fake.
[36:33.160 --> 36:38.560]  He's been a plagiarizer of Alex Jones for a long time, but he's going after the values
[36:38.560 --> 36:43.880]  of conservatism, libertarianism, and nationalism.
[36:43.880 --> 36:46.680]  Not in the sense that it is a fascism, no.
[36:46.680 --> 36:52.840]  We always had more taxes at the border up until we created the income tax and the Federal
[36:52.840 --> 36:57.960]  Reserve, and that's when they started pursuing free trade, of course.
[36:57.960 --> 37:03.560]  But he goes to the favorite whipping dog of the globalists, the Smoot Holly Tariff Act
[37:03.560 --> 37:08.160]  that happened 20 years after the Federal Reserve started manipulating our economy.
[37:08.160 --> 37:10.840]  That's what really plunged us in the depression, no.
[37:10.840 --> 37:11.840]  I don't think so.
[37:11.840 --> 37:12.840]  I don't think so.
[37:12.840 --> 37:16.720]  They have the knives out for Steve Bannon because he understands where this is going,
[37:16.720 --> 37:18.680]  and he understands what the problem is.
[37:18.680 --> 37:23.400]  And the problem is, as we talked to Bruce Fine yesterday, he said we've got Congress
[37:23.400 --> 37:29.520]  has abdicated its power to this massive bureaucracy that is unaccountable.
[37:29.520 --> 37:35.400]  And we have not only taxation without representation from this bureaucracy, but we also have legislation
[37:35.400 --> 37:36.800]  without representation.
[37:36.800 --> 37:40.240]  And they say that your Sixth Amendment rights don't apply because they're coming after
[37:40.240 --> 37:43.200]  you for civil violations, for regulatory violations.
[37:43.200 --> 37:45.280]  They're not criminal laws.
[37:45.280 --> 37:49.880]  So not the protection of innocent until proven guilty or having a trial or protection against
[37:49.880 --> 37:50.880]  excessive fines.
[37:50.880 --> 37:53.800]  Now that applies because this is the bureaucracy coming after you.
[37:53.800 --> 37:59.280]  This is the FAA saying if you fly your toy drone without a permit from them, $25,000 fine.
[37:59.280 --> 38:04.560]  Or the EPA, they can put a fine of $35,000 a day on a guy that's a welder with eight
[38:04.560 --> 38:08.360]  acres in Montana that's got a pond that's all on his property, and they want to try
[38:08.360 --> 38:10.200]  to regulate that.
[38:10.200 --> 38:11.880]  That's the administrative state.
[38:11.880 --> 38:14.400]  That's what Glenn Beck goes on to CNN to cheerlead.
[38:14.400 --> 38:16.920]  And so let's go back to Donald Trump.
[38:16.920 --> 38:19.360]  He was taken on CNN pretty hard.
[38:19.360 --> 38:24.040]  And if you don't believe that he's a conservative, then take a look at the crowd.
[38:24.040 --> 38:28.600]  I think the crowd disagrees with Glenn Beck, but let's go back to the C-SPAN speech bum
[38:28.600 --> 38:30.760]  Donald Trump earlier today.
[38:30.760 --> 38:35.720]  Polls, they come out with these polls and everybody was so surprised, actually a couple
[38:35.720 --> 38:36.720]  of polls got it right.
[38:36.720 --> 38:41.760]  I must say Los Angeles Times did a great job, shocking because they did a great job.
[38:41.760 --> 38:42.760]  Hold it right there.
[38:42.760 --> 38:45.240]  Hold it right there because I gotta say this real quickly.
[38:45.240 --> 38:49.880]  One of the things that came out about CNN was the fact that they dismissed Rasmussen
[38:49.880 --> 38:51.000]  polls.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.880]  And those have proven to be amongst, if not the most accurate polls out there.
[38:55.880 --> 38:57.720]  But why would they dismiss it?
[38:57.720 --> 39:00.320]  Because it showed that Trump was going to win.
[39:00.320 --> 39:03.080]  So they try to pick the polls, they dismissed the people who have historically been the
[39:03.080 --> 39:04.080]  most accurate.
[39:04.080 --> 39:05.920]  And that's exactly what Donald Trump just said.
[39:05.920 --> 39:07.560]  Let's continue.
[39:07.560 --> 39:11.640]  We had a couple of others that were right, but generally speaking, I mean, I can tell
[39:11.640 --> 39:12.920]  you the network.
[39:12.920 --> 39:15.720]  Somebody said, a poll came out.
[39:15.720 --> 39:18.240]  And I say, what network is it?
[39:18.240 --> 39:21.800]  And they'll say a certain, let's not even mention names, right?
[39:21.800 --> 39:36.200]  Yeah, you have a lot of them, look, the Clinton News Network is one.
[39:36.200 --> 39:45.720]  Take a look, honestly, take a look at their polls over the last two years.
[39:45.720 --> 39:49.400]  Now you'd think they'd fire the pollster, right?
[39:49.400 --> 39:51.960]  After years and years of getting battered.
[39:51.960 --> 39:57.320]  But I don't know, I mean, who knows, maybe they're just bad at polling, or maybe they're
[39:57.320 --> 39:58.560]  not legit.
[39:58.560 --> 39:59.560]  But it's one or the other.
[39:59.560 --> 40:06.320]  Look at how inaccurate, look at CBS, look at ABC also, look at NBC, take a look at some
[40:06.320 --> 40:07.320]  of these polls.
[40:07.320 --> 40:09.480]  They're so bad, so inaccurate.
[40:09.480 --> 40:13.080]  And what that does is it creates a false narrative.
[40:13.080 --> 40:16.360]  It creates like this narrative that's just like, we're not going to win.
[40:16.360 --> 40:18.560]  And people say, oh, I love Trump.
[40:18.560 --> 40:21.240]  Like, you know, I'm not feeling great today, he can't win.
[40:21.240 --> 40:23.200]  So I won't go and vote.
[40:23.200 --> 40:24.640]  I won't go and vote.
[40:24.640 --> 40:27.240]  It creates a whole false deal.
[40:27.240 --> 40:28.640]  And we have to fight it, folks.
[40:28.640 --> 40:29.640]  We have to fight it.
[40:29.640 --> 40:33.000]  They're very smart, they're very cunning, and they're very dishonest.
[40:33.000 --> 40:40.360]  So just to conclude, I mean, it's a very sensitive topic, and they get upset when we expose their
[40:40.360 --> 40:42.320]  false stories.
[40:42.320 --> 40:47.000]  They say that we can't criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment.
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.800]  You know, they always bring up the First Amendment.
[40:50.800 --> 40:52.160]  And I love the First Amendment.
[40:52.160 --> 40:54.640]  Nobody loves it better than me.
[40:54.640 --> 40:55.640]  Nobody.
[40:55.640 --> 41:03.400]  I mean, who uses it more than I do?
[41:03.400 --> 41:07.440]  But the First Amendment gives all of us, it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives
[41:07.440 --> 41:12.000]  it to all Americans the right to speak our minds freely.
[41:12.000 --> 41:25.200]  It gives you the right, and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly.
[41:25.200 --> 41:31.400]  And many of these groups are part of the large media corporations that have their own agenda,
[41:31.400 --> 41:36.800]  and it's not your agenda, and it's not the country's agenda, it's their own agenda.
[41:36.800 --> 41:42.040]  They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly.
[41:42.040 --> 41:50.160]  But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn't tell the
[41:50.160 --> 41:53.680]  truth, doesn't tell the truth.
[41:53.680 --> 42:03.040]  So just in finishing, I say it doesn't represent the people, it never will represent the people,
[42:03.040 --> 42:07.360]  and we're going to do something about it because we have to go out and we have to speak our
[42:07.360 --> 42:09.560]  minds, and we have to be honest.
[42:09.560 --> 42:21.520]  Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before.
[42:21.520 --> 42:26.200]  And I'm here fighting for you, and I will continue to fight for you.
[42:26.200 --> 42:35.120]  The victory and the win was something that really was dedicated to a country and people
[42:35.120 --> 42:41.400]  that believe in freedom, security, and the rule of law.
[42:41.400 --> 42:53.440]  Our victory was a victory and a win for conservative values.
[42:53.440 --> 42:59.760]  And our victory was a win for everyone who believes it's time to stand up for America,
[42:59.760 --> 43:06.960]  to stand up for the American worker, and to stand up for the American flag.
[43:06.960 --> 43:13.280]  Yeah, there we should stand up.
[43:13.280 --> 43:33.720]  And by the way, we love our flag, and by the way, you folks are in here, the place is packed.
[43:33.720 --> 43:38.160]  There are lines that go back six blocks, and I tell you that because you won't read about
[43:38.160 --> 43:39.160]  it, okay?
[43:39.160 --> 43:44.720]  But there are lines that go back six blocks, there is such love in this country for everything
[43:44.720 --> 43:45.960]  we stand for.
[43:45.960 --> 43:51.360]  You saw that on election day, and you're going to see it more and more.
[43:51.360 --> 43:55.920]  And as Donald Trump goes out and speaks to people, you're going to see that dichotomy.
[43:55.920 --> 44:01.920]  A movement the likes of which actually the world has never seen before.
[44:01.920 --> 44:04.280]  There's never been anything like this.
[44:04.280 --> 44:09.320]  There's been some movements, but there's never been anything like this.
[44:09.320 --> 44:16.360]  There's been some movements that petered out, like Bernie petered out.
[44:16.360 --> 44:21.280]  But it was a little rigged against him, you know, super delegate, super delegate.
[44:21.280 --> 44:23.680]  She had so many delegates before the thing even started.
[44:23.680 --> 44:27.640]  I actually said to my people, how does that happen?
[44:27.640 --> 44:30.760]  Not that I'm a fan of Bernie, but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump.
[44:30.760 --> 44:31.840]  You know why?
[44:31.840 --> 44:34.000]  Because he's right on one issue, trade.
[44:34.000 --> 44:35.800]  He was right about trade.
[44:35.800 --> 44:39.760]  Our country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals.
[44:39.760 --> 44:40.840]  So he was right about that.
[44:40.840 --> 44:42.560]  But we got a lot of Bernie support.
[44:42.560 --> 44:43.560]  So actually I like Bernie.
[44:43.560 --> 44:44.560]  Okay?
[44:44.560 --> 44:45.560]  I like Bernie.
[44:45.560 --> 44:49.960]  And Sanders opposed TPP, and there's the first thing that Trump shut down.
[44:49.960 --> 44:55.840]  What this movement means for the future of the Republican Party, and for the future of
[44:55.840 --> 45:03.960]  America, first we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is.
[45:03.960 --> 45:06.440]  And what it actually represents.
[45:06.440 --> 45:15.760]  The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put, and will put, its
[45:15.760 --> 45:21.160]  own citizens first.
[45:21.160 --> 45:31.080]  Isn't it amazing that that's a controversially new issue to put Americans first?
[45:31.080 --> 45:32.520]  And of course it wasn't.
[45:32.520 --> 45:34.120]  That was the core of Republicans.
[45:34.120 --> 45:36.480]  It's one of the reasons why Glenn Beck is wrong.
[45:36.480 --> 45:40.920]  America first was the core of the Republican Party, all the way up to World War II, and
[45:40.920 --> 45:44.680]  then they got hit on the fact that we didn't get into that war sooner enough, and so then
[45:44.680 --> 45:45.840]  they backed off on it.
[45:45.840 --> 45:46.840]  Go ahead.
[45:46.840 --> 45:50.120]  To other countries.
[45:50.120 --> 45:51.680]  So terrible.
[45:51.680 --> 45:58.120]  We've defended other nations' borders while leaving ours wide open.
[45:58.120 --> 46:00.120]  Anybody can come in.
[46:00.120 --> 46:07.200]  We're going to build the wall, don't worry about it, we're building the wall, we're building
[46:07.200 --> 46:08.200]  the wall.
[46:08.200 --> 46:18.320]  Fact is going to start soon, way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule, way, way, way ahead
[46:18.320 --> 46:19.320]  of schedule.
[46:19.320 --> 46:21.520]  It's going to start very soon.
[46:21.520 --> 46:29.280]  General Kelly, by the way, has done a fantastic job, fantastic job he's done.
[46:29.280 --> 46:33.040]  And remember, we are getting the bad ones out.
[46:33.040 --> 46:38.880]  These are bad dudes, we're getting the bad ones out, okay?
[46:38.880 --> 46:39.880]  We're getting the bad.
[46:39.880 --> 46:43.120]  If you watch these people, it's like, oh gee, that's so sad.
[46:43.120 --> 46:48.040]  We're getting bad people out of this country, people that shouldn't be, whether it's drugs
[46:48.040 --> 46:52.000]  or murder or other things, we're getting bad ones out.
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.560]  Those are the ones they go first, and I said it from day one.
[46:55.560 --> 47:05.800]  Basically, all I've done is keep my promise.
[47:05.800 --> 47:11.860]  We've spent trillions of dollars overseas while allowing our own infrastructure to fall
[47:11.860 --> 47:16.400]  into total disrepair and decay.
[47:16.400 --> 47:26.000]  In the Middle East, we've spent, as of four weeks ago, six trillion dollars.
[47:26.000 --> 47:27.280]  Think of it.
[47:27.280 --> 47:34.040]  And by the way, the Middle East is in what, I mean, it's not even close, it's in much
[47:34.040 --> 47:37.560]  worse shape than it was 15 years ago.
[47:37.560 --> 47:43.160]  If our presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape
[47:43.160 --> 47:47.360]  than we are right now, that I can tell you.
[47:47.360 --> 47:51.480]  Yeah, hell of a lot better.
[47:51.480 --> 47:56.760]  We could have rebuilt our country three times with that money.
[47:56.760 --> 47:58.840]  This is the situation that I inherited.
[47:58.840 --> 48:01.920]  I inherited a mess, believe me.
[48:01.920 --> 48:10.040]  We also inherited a failed healthcare law that threatens our medical system with absolute
[48:10.040 --> 48:14.280]  and total catastrophe.
[48:14.280 --> 48:22.880]  Now, I've been watching, and nobody says it, but Obamacare doesn't work, folks.
[48:22.880 --> 48:27.400]  I mean, I could say, I could talk, it doesn't work.
[48:27.400 --> 48:31.200]  And now, people are starting to develop a little warm heart, but the people that you're
[48:31.200 --> 48:34.520]  watching, they're not you.
[48:34.520 --> 48:39.280]  They're largely, many of them are the side that lost, you know, they lost the election.
[48:39.280 --> 48:42.360]  It's like, how many elections do we have to have?
[48:42.360 --> 48:44.920]  They lost the election.
[48:44.920 --> 48:48.640]  But I always say Obamacare doesn't work.
[48:48.640 --> 48:53.680]  And these same people two years ago and a year ago were complaining about Obamacare.
[48:53.680 --> 48:57.520]  And the bottom line, we're changing it.
[48:57.520 --> 48:59.640]  We're going to make it much better.
[48:59.640 --> 49:01.480]  We're going to make it less expensive.
[49:01.480 --> 49:03.840]  We're going to make it much better.
[49:03.840 --> 49:07.080]  Obamacare covers very few people.
[49:07.080 --> 49:13.120]  So remember, deduct from the number, all of the people that had great healthcare that
[49:13.120 --> 49:16.000]  they loved that was taken away from them.
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.720]  Okay, let's hold it right there because we've got a break coming up and I want to get everything
[49:19.720 --> 49:24.480]  that he says about Obamacare together because he's going to be unveiling his program beginning
[49:24.480 --> 49:25.920]  to the middle of March.
[49:25.920 --> 49:30.080]  And interestingly enough, he's going to have a series of speeches that he's going to be
[49:30.080 --> 49:33.280]  doing, a lot of events that he's going to be attending, just like this.
[49:33.280 --> 49:38.640]  He's going to be showing the American people how there's this massive disconnect between
[49:38.640 --> 49:42.240]  what you believe, what you think, what you support, and what we continue to hear from
[49:42.240 --> 49:43.240]  CNN.
[49:43.240 --> 49:46.720]  And just as he's talking about healthcare, we just saw two of the largest health insurance
[49:46.720 --> 49:50.560]  companies saying we're failing, Humana, Etna, we need to get together.
[49:50.560 --> 49:52.680]  That's not going to help if they're losing money.
[49:52.680 --> 49:54.880]  You don't make it up in terms of volume.
[49:54.880 --> 50:00.200]  Now that merger did not happen, but we're now seeing a merger in the media between two
[50:00.200 --> 50:05.760]  failing entities, Glenn Beck and CNN, that's going to drive them even further down.
[50:05.760 --> 50:11.200]  It's not going to help them any more than the failed merger between Etna and Humana.
[50:11.200 --> 50:14.560]  So you have to understand there's a fundamental problem there and the fake news, that's what
[50:14.560 --> 50:15.560]  he's talking about.
[50:15.560 --> 50:18.600]  We're going to get back to what he says about Obamacare and again, he's going to have a
[50:18.600 --> 50:24.080]  series of speeches from about February 27th to I think it's March 3rd or 4th, 28th of
[50:24.080 --> 50:25.080]  February.
[50:25.080 --> 50:29.760]  He's going to be speaking in Washington to a large number of people there, a joint
[50:29.760 --> 50:33.920]  session that he's going to be addressing there, and then the Obamacare is going to roll out
[50:33.920 --> 50:34.920]  from that.
[50:34.920 --> 50:37.200]  Now we're going to be coming back in just a moment.
[50:37.200 --> 50:42.280]  Please stand with us, fight against censorship, fight against the attempts to kill the Liberty
[50:42.280 --> 50:43.280]  Movement.
[50:43.280 --> 50:44.760]  That's what we're seeing here at Info Wars.
[50:44.760 --> 50:45.760]  That's why we have these specials.
[50:45.760 --> 50:47.080]  I'm going to tell you more about that.
[50:47.080 --> 50:51.640]  We're going to cover more of the Trump speech at CPAC when we come back.
[50:51.640 --> 50:52.640]  Stay with us.
[50:52.640 --> 51:04.120]  Many books have been written regarding the law of attraction, but what if all these books
[51:04.120 --> 51:07.920]  are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this
[51:07.920 --> 51:09.520]  law in our lives?
[51:09.520 --> 51:14.000]  The new book, It's Time to Align, the most powerful self-help book ever written by Alan
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.280]  Laudinger, takes a look at how the law of attraction really works and how it is being
[51:18.280 --> 51:20.040]  suppressed in our lives.

[51:30.320 --> 51:34.600]  Trump has done it, and the leaders of the New World Order aren't happy.

[52:10.080 --> 52:12.880]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[52:12.880 --> 52:17.920]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[54:07.400 --> 54:08.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[54:08.640 --> 54:09.640]  I'm David Knight.
[54:09.640 --> 54:13.680]  We joined by Alex Jones in the next hour and he's got an interesting interview that he's
[54:13.680 --> 54:15.400]  going to be doing next hour with Joy Vila.
[54:15.400 --> 54:19.680]  Of course, she was a singer who went to the Grammy Awards wearing a Trump dress and now
[54:19.680 --> 54:24.120]  her career has skyrocketed because that should tell you something, shouldn't it?
[54:24.120 --> 54:28.520]  Shouldn't it tell people something that Donald Trump goes to CPAC after Glenn Beck goes to
[54:28.520 --> 54:31.040]  CNN and says, oh, they're not real conservatives.
[54:31.040 --> 54:33.240]  You saw the standing ovation there.
[54:33.240 --> 54:35.200]  They're trying to censor us, folks.
[54:35.200 --> 54:36.760]  And of course, Donald Trump is fighting back.
[54:36.760 --> 54:40.600]  He's going to have a series of speeches coming up at the end of February, beginning of March.
[54:40.600 --> 54:41.600]  He's going to go on an offensive.
[54:41.600 --> 54:44.200]  He's going to show that people stand with him.
[54:44.200 --> 54:45.480]  And that's what we're doing.
[54:45.480 --> 54:48.320]  We're going on the offensive because they're coming after us.
[54:48.320 --> 54:49.760]  They're censoring our videos.
[54:49.760 --> 54:53.120]  They shut down videos that had one of them 14 million views.
[54:53.120 --> 54:54.120]  They just took it off.
[54:54.120 --> 55:00.960]  I had my own video that was done on Tuesday talking about what is happening in Sweden,
[55:00.960 --> 55:05.000]  how the mainstream media was mocking Donald Trump saying he's lying about what's happening
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.720]  in Sweden, and we showed you pictures of what had happened.
[55:07.720 --> 55:12.200]  Now, these are pictures, reports, B-roll that we had shown many times before, but they are
[55:12.200 --> 55:15.040]  rated my, actually, it's an age restriction, okay?
[55:15.040 --> 55:16.480]  So it's like an R-rated video.
[55:16.480 --> 55:23.400]  You have to sign in in order to see the video, trying to kill views because we defended what
[55:23.400 --> 55:24.880]  Trump said.
[55:24.880 --> 55:25.880]  He said the right thing.
[55:25.880 --> 55:29.680]  He said what was going on in Sweden, and we showed what was going on, and we showed
[55:29.680 --> 55:33.200]  how they mocked the reality of what was going on.
[55:33.200 --> 55:36.360]  So we do that kind of stuff, they're actually censoring us, folks, but what they're also
[55:36.360 --> 55:41.520]  doing is they are trying to strangle us financially.
[55:41.520 --> 55:44.720]  Now we don't have any sponsors that they can boycott, so what they do is they say we're
[55:44.720 --> 55:48.240]  not going to let your ads be shown because you're a political organization.
[55:48.240 --> 55:52.000]  Our site, infowarsstore.com, is not a political site.
[55:52.000 --> 55:58.800]  It simply sells supplements and other products that enhance your life, and so they say, no,
[55:58.800 --> 56:04.680]  you can't show a picture of a vitamin bottle or brain force or supermail vitality.
[56:04.680 --> 56:05.680]  You can't show that.
[56:05.680 --> 56:10.480]  We're not going to serve those ads, so they try to strangle us financially.
[56:10.480 --> 56:13.480]  And so in response, we're going to fight back, just like Donald Trump fought back.
[56:13.480 --> 56:16.640]  Donald Trump says, I'm not going to let CNN set the narrative.
[56:16.640 --> 56:18.160]  Well, we aren't either, and you aren't either.
[56:18.160 --> 56:19.520]  You stood with us on Wednesday.
[56:19.520 --> 56:21.040]  They've extended this sale.
[56:21.040 --> 56:26.320]  It's going to be ending soon, however, but we had a 13-hour live broadcast on Wednesday,
[56:26.320 --> 56:31.040]  and we are now extending that Defense of Liberty mega special sale.
[56:31.040 --> 56:36.840]  Silver bullet, colloidal silver, 33% off, supermail vitality, 25% off, brain force,
[56:36.840 --> 56:43.640]  25% off, survival shield, X2, nascent iodine, 25% off, caveman, that's our newest supplement,
[56:43.640 --> 56:44.640]  33% off.
[56:44.640 --> 56:52.600]  And of course, like many of our products, this has some very essential ingredients here
[56:52.600 --> 56:54.560]  that are going to help your health.
[56:54.560 --> 56:58.480]  As we saw earlier today, we've got doctors who are now going to the grocery store to
[56:58.480 --> 57:01.000]  try to help their patients learn how to eat.
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.840]  That's what we're trying to do at InfoWars store.
[57:03.840 --> 57:06.760]  We're saying, look, these are good things for you.
[57:06.760 --> 57:09.200]  This is something that will help your family, help your health.
[57:09.200 --> 57:12.040]  These are things that you're not getting in the standard American diet.
[57:12.040 --> 57:17.320]  Things like bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, seven primal superfoods that you
[57:17.320 --> 57:20.200]  can take in a single great tasting formula.
[57:20.200 --> 57:26.160]  And we don't put all these kinds of preservatives and sweeteners and things like that in it
[57:26.160 --> 57:30.440]  that harm your health that you see in the standard American diet.
[57:30.440 --> 57:32.520]  So what we do is we try to come alongside of you.
[57:32.520 --> 57:37.080]  We create products that are going to have essential ingredients that are going to help
[57:37.080 --> 57:38.080]  your health.
[57:38.080 --> 57:39.080]  We tell you why that is.
[57:39.080 --> 57:40.080]  You can do your own research.
[57:40.080 --> 57:41.080]  You can read the reviews there.
[57:41.080 --> 57:42.280]  We've got a review on caveman.
[57:42.280 --> 57:43.920]  I'll read to you right here.
[57:43.920 --> 57:48.760]  It's as someone who does research on every formula I take, I can tell you that caveman
[57:48.760 --> 57:52.000]  is the best formula out there with bone broth and it tastes great.
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.760]  Other bone broth powders are almost impossible to take because of the taste.
[57:56.760 --> 57:58.840]  Also love the turmeric and the bee pollen.
[57:58.840 --> 58:00.080]  Thanks Alex and crew.
[58:00.080 --> 58:01.560]  Got another one here.
[58:01.560 --> 58:02.560]  Wow.
[58:02.560 --> 58:03.560]  Just wow.
[58:03.560 --> 58:04.560]  Love the taste with the cocoa.
[58:04.560 --> 58:05.640]  Use it every day now.
[58:05.640 --> 58:06.640]  And I do too.
[58:06.640 --> 58:08.200]  It's a great tasting supplement.
[58:08.200 --> 58:12.560]  And of course you can always put things in it like fruit or something like that if you
[58:12.560 --> 58:13.560]  make a smoothie.
[58:13.560 --> 58:15.160]  That's the bottom line.
[58:15.160 --> 58:19.760]  Because we try to work with you and we try to stand and we're not going to go away just
[58:19.760 --> 58:21.200]  like Donald Trump is not going to go away.
[58:21.200 --> 58:24.040]  The resistance increases, we're going to increase.
[58:24.040 --> 58:27.800]  And we know that you will stand with us and we appreciate you standing with us just as
[58:27.800 --> 58:29.480]  we saw these people standing with Trump.
[58:29.480 --> 58:34.160]  And as we're going to see in this tour as he crosses the country, the beginning of March
[58:34.160 --> 58:40.560]  and the lead up to his plan for Obamacare because Congress isn't going to do it.
[58:40.560 --> 58:50.240]  You are listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:50.240 --> 58:56.600]  National Defense Labs and Citizen Armor has given Info Wars the exclusive on distributing
[58:56.600 --> 59:00.560]  to the American people the true next generation in body armor.
[59:00.560 --> 59:07.560]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic lightweight
[59:07.560 --> 59:08.560]  body armor.
[59:08.560 --> 59:13.560]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable and stronger than anything
[59:13.560 --> 59:14.560]  else on the market.
[59:14.560 --> 59:17.680]  You said when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing it for years
[59:17.680 --> 59:20.840]  and people that currently are testing it for us, they didn't just say outstanding, what
[59:20.840 --> 59:21.840]  they really say about them.
[59:21.840 --> 59:24.400]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[59:24.400 --> 59:28.240]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[59:28.240 --> 59:32.080]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[59:32.080 --> 59:34.080]  I mean it's unbelievable, it's a quarter inch thick.
[59:34.080 --> 59:37.040]  It's got a 20 year warranty, it's waterproof, you can wear it, it's comfortable.
[59:37.040 --> 59:39.400]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it.
[59:39.400 --> 59:45.800]  Again, fund the Info Wars, get the game changing, and Nanotech Goobs gets a win-win, $200.
[59:45.800 --> 59:52.600]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com, it's amazing.
[59:52.600 --> 1:00:10.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:30.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.200]  Alex is going to be joining us this hour along with his guest Joy Vila, the singer who went
[1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:38.440]  to the Grammy Awards with a Trump dress and saw her career soar.
[1:00:38.440 --> 1:00:41.400]  So she's going to be talking to Alex Jones coming up in this hour.
[1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:46.040]  But I want to go back to the speech that Donald Trump gave earlier this morning at C-Span.
[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:49.160]  At the point that we stopped it, he was just about to get into Obamacare, and of course
[1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:52.000]  it is going to have to come from Donald Trump.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.960]  We've got all these different plans that they're coming out of the GOP, and of course they
[1:00:55.960 --> 1:00:58.120]  don't want anything to happen.
[1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:00.800]  We've had Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan there for a very long time, they could have put
[1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:02.360]  something together, but they're not going to do it.
[1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:06.160]  If it's going to happen, it's going to have to come from Donald Trump, who just had John
[1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:11.520]  Boehner yesterday saying, oh, all this talk about fixing Obamacare, that's just happy
[1:01:11.520 --> 1:01:12.520]  talk.
[1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:17.880]  Yeah, that's just happy talk that John Boehner and Paul Ryan and these Republican congressional
[1:01:17.880 --> 1:01:19.800]  people have used to get elected.
[1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:21.920]  They're not really interested in delivering.
[1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:25.440]  I think Donald Trump is, and he's going to have to be the one who's going to take the
[1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:26.440]  reins of Congress.
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:30.760]  He's going to have to go to the people, and I think we're going to see that happen in
[1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:31.760]  the next couple of weeks.
[1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:34.120]  He's going to go to the people, then he's going to go to the Congress, and he's going
[1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:35.120]  to say, do this.
[1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:38.560]  This is the plan, and it must start with repeal.
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:40.560]  We must put that kind of pressure on them.
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:45.920]  Let's go back to Donald Trump at C-SPAN.
[1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:48.040]  Millions of people were very happy with their healthcare.
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:50.840]  They had their doctor, they had their plan.
[1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:51.840]  Remember the lie?
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:53.480]  28 times.
[1:01:53.480 --> 1:01:55.960]  You can keep your doctor.
[1:01:55.960 --> 1:02:02.320]  You can keep your plan over and over and over again, you heard it.
[1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:17.040]  So we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare.
[1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:24.640]  And I tell Paul Ryan and all of the folks that we're working with very hard, Dr. Tom
[1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:28.920]  Price, very talented guy.
[1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:36.880]  And I tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single best thing we can do is nothing.
[1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:38.760]  Let it implode completely.
[1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:39.880]  It's already imploding.
[1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:42.080]  You see the carriers are all leaving.
[1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:43.960]  I mean, it's a disaster.
[1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:46.600]  But two years don't do anything.
[1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:50.600]  The Democrats will come to us and beg for help.
[1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:53.560]  They'll beg, and it's their problem.
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:56.160]  But it's not the right thing to do for the American people.
[1:02:56.160 --> 1:03:01.240]  It's not the right thing to do.
[1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:07.680]  We inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years.
[1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:08.680]  Think of it.
[1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:09.680]  $20 trillion.
[1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:12.040]  It's doubled.
[1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:16.920]  And we inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another.
[1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:17.920]  We don't win anymore.
[1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:19.680]  When was the last time we won?
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:21.200]  Do we win a war?
[1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:23.400]  Do we win anything?
[1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:27.640]  Do we win anything?
[1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:28.640]  We're going to win.
[1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:29.640]  We're going to win big, folks.
[1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:30.640]  We're going to start winning again.
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:44.400]  Believe me, we're going to win.
[1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:52.360]  But we're taking a firm, bold, and decisive measure we have to to turn things around.
[1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:56.600]  The era of empty talk is over.
[1:03:56.600 --> 1:03:59.200]  It's over.
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:02.640]  Now is the time for action.
[1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:10.720]  So let me tell you about the actions that we're taking right now to deliver on our promise
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:16.920]  to the American people and on my promise to make America great again.
[1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:22.340]  We've taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the United States and
[1:04:22.340 --> 1:04:35.920]  to begin the construction of a great, great border wall.
[1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:44.320]  By doing this and with the help of our great border police, with the help of ICE, with
[1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:51.120]  the help of General Kelly, and all of the people that are so passionate about this,
[1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:55.600]  our border patrol, I'll tell you what they do, they came and endorsed me, ICE came and
[1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:56.600]  endorsed me.
[1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:57.600]  They never endorsed the president.
[1:04:57.600 --> 1:04:58.600]  All right, we're going to break.
[1:04:58.600 --> 1:04:59.600]  We're going to be right back.
[1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:00.600]  Stay with us.
[1:05:00.600 --> 1:05:01.600]  More of Donald Trump and CPAC.
[1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:05.320]  For a CIA officer, Brian Dean Wright stated in an interview with Tucker Carlson that
[1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:10.880]  rumors about intelligence operatives withholding information from President Trump are true
[1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:14.640]  and that leaks are being made intentionally to discredit the president.
[1:05:14.640 --> 1:05:20.000]  He also said that these rogue intelligence officers are playing a dangerous game and
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:24.480]  that he supports the president in finding these people and throwing them in jail.
[1:05:24.480 --> 1:05:29.300]  We have to ask ourselves how safe is our country when we have shadow elements in various
[1:05:29.300 --> 1:05:34.200]  intelligence agencies withholding information from the president that could be pertinent
[1:05:34.200 --> 1:05:38.480]  to him being able to make fast decisions in regard to the safety of the nation.
[1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:43.520]  And lastly, given the history of nefarious conduct by various intelligence agencies,
[1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:48.920]  should Trump make an executive order within constitutional restrictions to drain the swamp
[1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:54.160]  within the intelligence agencies before they enact a coup against him, which would undermine
[1:05:54.160 --> 1:05:56.280]  the American democratic process.
[1:05:56.280 --> 1:06:26.240]  This is Milly Weaver reporting for Infowars.com.

[1:08:14.340 --> 1:08:21.940]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:08:21.940 --> 1:08:27.940]  Show. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. We're going to have Alex joining
[1:08:27.940 --> 1:08:34.500]  us in this hour. We also have Donald Trump at CPAC, and we've been playing excerpts from that
[1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:40.660]  speech. He went to CPAC and he talked a lot about the fake news media, about the opposition. And
[1:08:40.660 --> 1:08:46.900]  of course, we had Glenn Beck go to the center of that opposition, and Donald Trump didn't call
[1:08:46.900 --> 1:08:51.060]  him out directly. He called the Clinton News Network. We all know who he's talking about.
[1:08:51.060 --> 1:08:56.580]  They were all shouting CNN. But of course, Glenn Beck goes to CNN and says that Donald Trump is a
[1:08:56.580 --> 1:09:00.900]  fake conservative, that Steve Bannon is a fake conservative. And then they put up on the lower
[1:09:00.900 --> 1:09:06.820]  thirds that the White House goal, that says Bannon, is quote, deconstruction of the administrative
[1:09:06.820 --> 1:09:11.460]  state. And he says, no, that's not a conservative value. Conservatives, what big government says
[1:09:11.460 --> 1:09:16.420]  Glenn Beck? Beck said that Bannon has repeatedly talked about, quote, burning the system down
[1:09:16.420 --> 1:09:20.740]  to the ground. A policy he says most conservatives would be against. Well, that's only unless you
[1:09:20.740 --> 1:09:25.380]  look at somebody like Betsy DeVos who says, no, I want to keep the Department of Education and
[1:09:25.380 --> 1:09:30.420]  I want to fight for its right to tell people even how they can go to the bathroom. Is that real
[1:09:30.420 --> 1:09:35.620]  conservatism? No, real conservatism was what we voted for with Reagan when he said he was going
[1:09:35.620 --> 1:09:41.860]  to get rid of the Department of Education. Now we've got this Jeb Bush bureaucrat, Betsy DeVos,
[1:09:41.860 --> 1:09:48.180]  who wants to dictate even that level of control on everybody. No, you have to get rid of the state.
[1:09:48.180 --> 1:09:51.940]  Another example of this is the fact that social security administration has paid a billion dollars
[1:09:51.940 --> 1:09:56.500]  in benefits to people who don't even have social security numbers. How about that? A billion dollars
[1:09:56.500 --> 1:10:01.540]  in benefits they found in an audit, a sample of 100 beneficiaries, they only had six people
[1:10:01.540 --> 1:10:06.020]  with a social security number. So you don't even have to come here and forge your social
[1:10:06.020 --> 1:10:10.740]  security documents. You can just come here and get this stuff for free. The bureaucracy is mostly
[1:10:10.740 --> 1:10:16.580]  asleep, but they also allow illegal aliens without social security numbers to collect benefits.
[1:10:16.580 --> 1:10:24.020]  If it's done to represent their minor children, this has to end. This gravy train has to end.
[1:10:24.020 --> 1:10:29.300]  No other country does this. And this country cannot afford to do this anymore than we can
[1:10:29.300 --> 1:10:33.700]  afford to go destroy other countries and then rebuild their infrastructure while ours crumbles
[1:10:33.700 --> 1:10:37.300]  to the ground. That's what Donald Trump was talking about. But let's go back to what he
[1:10:37.300 --> 1:10:43.060]  was talking about at C-SPAN. He was going on to Obamacare and how he's going to change
[1:10:43.060 --> 1:10:47.780]  healthcare. And of course, it's going to have to come from Donald Trump. The Republicans will not
[1:10:47.780 --> 1:10:51.540]  do it. As John Boehner said, that's all just happy talk. He said that yesterday. We're not going
[1:10:51.540 --> 1:10:55.860]  to change anything. It's just happy talk. We just use that to make you guys happy. So you'll vote
[1:10:55.860 --> 1:10:59.700]  for us, but we're not really going to do anything. Donald Trump is going to have to be the one
[1:10:59.700 --> 1:11:01.940]  to hold their feet to the fire. Let's go back to C-SPAN.
[1:11:01.940 --> 1:11:15.060]  By doing this and with the help of our great border police, with the help of ICE,
[1:11:16.100 --> 1:11:21.620]  with the help of General Kelly, and all of the people that are so passionate about this,
[1:11:22.980 --> 1:11:27.940]  our Border Patrol, I'll tell you what they do. They came and endorsed me. ICE came and endorsed
[1:11:27.940 --> 1:11:32.580]  me. They never endorsed a presidential candidate before. They might not even be allowed to,
[1:11:34.420 --> 1:11:40.180]  but they were disgusted with what they saw. And we'll stop it. We'll stop the drugs
[1:11:41.060 --> 1:11:49.860]  from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth, pouring in, pouring in.
[1:11:49.860 --> 1:12:01.380]  We get the drugs. They get the money. We get the problems. They get the cash. No good. No good.
[1:12:01.380 --> 1:12:07.620]  Going to stop. By stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless talkstiles,
[1:12:07.620 --> 1:12:14.420]  and that's so important because the tax, the dollars that we're losing, are beyond anything
[1:12:14.420 --> 1:12:22.660]  that you can imagine, and the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling American communities,
[1:12:22.660 --> 1:12:36.500]  including our inner cities. We are also going to save countless American lives. As we speak today,
[1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:42.180]  immigration officers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers, and the criminal
[1:12:42.180 --> 1:12:55.860]  aliens, and throwing them the hell out of our country. And we will not let them back in. They're
[1:12:55.860 --> 1:13:00.900]  not coming back in, folks. They do. They're going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamt of.
[1:13:02.660 --> 1:13:05.380]  I'm also working with the Department of Justice
[1:13:05.380 --> 1:13:15.220]  to begin reducing violent crime. I mean, can you believe what's happening in Chicago as an example?
[1:13:16.100 --> 1:13:25.380]  Two days ago, seven people were shot, and I believe killed. Seven people, seven people.
[1:13:25.380 --> 1:13:32.980]  Chicago, a great American city, seven people shot and killed. We will support the incredible
[1:13:32.980 --> 1:13:46.660]  men and women of law enforcement.
[1:13:46.660 --> 1:14:10.020]  Thank you, and thank them. I've also followed through in my campaign promise and withdrawn
[1:14:10.020 --> 1:14:20.260]  America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership so that we can protect our economic freedom.
[1:14:20.260 --> 1:14:24.580]  And we're going to make trade deals, but we're going to do one-on-one, one-on-one. And if they
[1:14:24.580 --> 1:14:29.700]  misbehave, we terminate the deal, and then they'll come back and we'll make a better deal. None of
[1:14:29.700 --> 1:14:35.140]  these big quagmire deals that are a disaster. Just take a look, by the way, take a look at NAFTA,
[1:14:35.140 --> 1:14:41.220]  one of the worst deals ever made by any country having to do with economic development. It's
[1:14:41.220 --> 1:14:47.460]  economic undevelopment as far as our country is concerned. We're preparing to repeal and replace
[1:14:48.580 --> 1:14:55.300]  the disaster known as Obamacare. We're going to save Americans from this crisis and give them
[1:14:55.300 --> 1:15:03.060]  the access to the quality healthcare they need and deserve. We have authorized the construction
[1:15:03.060 --> 1:15:17.940]  one day of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipeline. And issued a new rule. This took place while I
[1:15:17.940 --> 1:15:23.140]  was getting ready to sign. I said, who makes the pipes for the pipeline? Well, sir, it comes from
[1:15:23.140 --> 1:15:28.180]  all over the world. It's not wonderful. I said, nope, it comes from the United States. Oh, we're
[1:15:28.180 --> 1:15:40.260]  not building it. American Steel. American Steel pumping American oil for American energy. Hey,
[1:15:40.260 --> 1:15:47.940]  that's a bad idea, right? No. In the United States, they're going to use pipe that's made
[1:15:47.940 --> 1:15:55.860]  in the United States. Do we agree? But can you imagine, I told the story the other day,
[1:15:55.860 --> 1:16:01.540]  can you imagine the gentleman never met him? Don't even know the name of his company. I actually
[1:16:01.540 --> 1:16:07.060]  sort of know it, but I want to get it exactly correct. Big, big, powerful company. They spent
[1:16:07.060 --> 1:16:12.660]  hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline. Same thing with the Dakota, different place.
[1:16:12.660 --> 1:16:16.180]  They got their approvals, everything in the case of Dakota, then all of a sudden they couldn't
[1:16:16.180 --> 1:16:22.020]  connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before. But with the Keystone,
[1:16:22.020 --> 1:16:26.340]  so they spent hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants, you know, sucking
[1:16:26.340 --> 1:16:32.340]  the blood out of the company. Don't worry. I used them all my life. Okay. Don't worry. We're going
[1:16:32.340 --> 1:16:38.260]  to get it approved. I'm connected. I'm a lobbyist. Don't worry. Bottom line. Obama didn't sign it,
[1:16:38.260 --> 1:16:44.900]  right? Could be 42,000 jobs somewhere around there. A lot of jobs didn't sign it. But can you imagine,
[1:16:44.900 --> 1:16:52.500]  he gave up a year ago. It was dead. Now he's doing nothing. Calling his wife, hello darling,
[1:16:52.500 --> 1:16:56.420]  I'm a little bored. You know that pipeline by that has killed us, that has killed our company.
[1:16:57.380 --> 1:17:05.380]  Knock, knock. Mr. So-and-so. The Keystone Pipelod, sir, out of nowhere has just been approved.
[1:17:06.500 --> 1:17:13.540]  Now, can you imagine the expression? And you know the sad part? The same bloodsucking consultants
[1:17:13.540 --> 1:17:18.900]  that hit him for all the money and failed, they're now going to go back to him and say,
[1:17:18.900 --> 1:17:24.100]  didn't we do a great job? We want more money, right? Because that's the way the system works,
[1:17:24.100 --> 1:17:29.300]  a little bit off. But that's the way the system works. We're preparing bold action
[1:17:30.020 --> 1:17:37.940]  to lift the restrictions on American energy, including shale oil, natural gas, and beautiful,
[1:17:37.940 --> 1:17:45.860]  clean coal. And we're going to put our miners back to work. Yeah, that's very important. And that's
[1:17:45.860 --> 1:17:51.140]  one of the key things that Donald Trump has done is put in an attorney general from Ohio
[1:17:51.140 --> 1:17:56.020]  who fought the overreach of the EPA. And when we talk about the environmental issues about the
[1:17:56.020 --> 1:18:01.380]  pipeline, we have to understand what the real issue is here, folks. There is no cheaper way
[1:18:01.380 --> 1:18:08.900]  to transfer our energy than by a pipeline in a safer way. You can't transfer this oil and we're
[1:18:08.900 --> 1:18:12.660]  just going to leave it in the ground. Well, that's what these people want. They don't want us to have
[1:18:12.660 --> 1:18:19.140]  coal. They don't want us to have oil. They want us to import our energy. They want us to subsidize
[1:18:19.140 --> 1:18:26.100]  the solar companies. We can have clean fossil fuels. And we can have safe fossil fuels delivered.
[1:18:26.100 --> 1:18:34.180]  You know, the Exxon Valdez spill was 1500 times bigger than the record spill out of a pipeline.
[1:18:34.180 --> 1:18:37.940]  That would mean you'd have to have the worst pipeline spill we've ever had
[1:18:37.940 --> 1:18:43.780]  every day for five years to equal one Exxon Valdez. And that wasn't even the largest tanker spill.
[1:18:43.780 --> 1:18:44.820]  Let's go back to the speech.
[1:18:44.820 --> 1:18:55.380]  Miners are going back to work, folks. Sorry to tell you that, but they're going back to work.
[1:18:56.580 --> 1:19:03.540]  We have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy,
[1:19:03.540 --> 1:19:10.020]  crushing. And not only our economy, crushing our jobs because companies can't hire.
[1:19:10.020 --> 1:19:16.820]  We're going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business.
[1:19:20.020 --> 1:19:27.140]  And by the way, I want regulation. I want to protect our environment. I want regulations
[1:19:27.140 --> 1:19:33.940]  for safety. I want all of the regulations that we need. And I want them to be so strong and so tough.
[1:19:33.940 --> 1:19:43.380]  But we don't need 75% of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies,
[1:19:43.380 --> 1:19:49.300]  hurt jobs, make us non-competitive overseas with other companies from other countries.
[1:19:49.300 --> 1:19:51.620]  We're going to take a break and we're going to be right back. You know,
[1:19:51.620 --> 1:20:04.420]  the point of Obama was to shut down the industry, not to keep our environment clean. We'll be right back.

[1:20:33.460 --> 1:20:38.340]  in turmeric known as curcumin is poorly absorbed into the cells due to its large particle size.
[1:20:38.340 --> 1:20:43.060]  But now one planet nutrition has the answer for this powerful anti-inflammatory.

[1:21:00.340 --> 1:21:06.260]  Hi there, Dick Holgeier here. I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[1:21:06.260 --> 1:21:12.580]  I normally never do commercial endorsements. I am very skeptical of health supplements,
[1:21:12.580 --> 1:21:18.580]  but a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One, so I purchased a bottle and my
[1:21:18.580 --> 1:21:24.420]  wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now. I very much dislike so-called energy boosters,
[1:21:24.420 --> 1:21:30.180]  those little energy drinks that have caffeine and Gerana and other things that make your heart race.
[1:21:30.180 --> 1:21:36.420]  This is not that. My experience with Synergy One has been great. My mood is better. My joints
[1:21:36.420 --> 1:21:42.980]  feel better. I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity. My wife and I both
[1:21:42.980 --> 1:21:49.060]  notice that we even dream more, so I recommend Synergy One. It's really good stuff. I'm having
[1:21:49.060 --> 1:21:58.980]  great results with it. Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com. That's oneworldwhey.com.

[1:23:01.540 --> 1:23:07.060]  in an epic battle of David versus Goliath. In the early 1980s, a child was born. Two of them
[1:23:07.060 --> 1:23:12.020]  actually. Their names were Jeff and Andy. Time went by, they developed facial hair,
[1:23:12.020 --> 1:23:16.580]  and one day something happened. Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors,
[1:23:16.580 --> 1:23:20.580]  so they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[1:23:20.580 --> 1:23:24.900]  They hired the best designers, they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory,
[1:23:24.900 --> 1:23:29.540]  and they started selling high quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers.
[1:23:29.540 --> 1:23:34.100]  How did the overpriced razor company respond? By threatening to sue their pants off.
[1:23:34.100 --> 1:23:37.700]  Don't worry, Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and are a relentless dream to get
[1:23:37.700 --> 1:23:42.820]  all guys a great shave at a great price. Try Harry's free. They'll send you a razor with

[1:24:07.860 --> 1:24:11.940]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. You can tell who the change agents are
[1:24:11.940 --> 1:24:17.460]  because they're the ones that the press and the laughter coming after, the media. People like
[1:24:17.460 --> 1:24:22.100]  Pruitt. We got Soros investigating him, trying to dig up dirt on him because he's going to change
[1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:25.860]  things at the EPA. He's going to get them back within the boundaries of the law, change their
[1:24:25.860 --> 1:24:29.780]  mission from shutting down entire industries to just protecting the environment. How about that
[1:24:29.780 --> 1:24:35.460]  for a change? Of course, Bannon has got Beck and CNN and Time Magazine and Saturday Night Live all
[1:24:35.460 --> 1:24:40.820]  coming after him. So does InfoWars. See, you can tell who the change agents are because they're
[1:24:40.820 --> 1:24:44.340]  the ones who are taking the flag. They let all these other people in their administration or
[1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:48.820]  other people in the press, they let them alone. But we've got people coming after us on a daily
[1:24:48.820 --> 1:24:55.300]  basis, whether it's Homeland that's creating an Alex Jones character or they're mocking him
[1:24:55.300 --> 1:25:01.300]  with Stephen Colbert or John Oliver, mischaracterizing what we say, censoring what we say
[1:25:01.300 --> 1:25:07.620]  at Google. And now we've been censored in terms of putting ads out. We've had a major component of
[1:25:07.620 --> 1:25:12.740]  our revenue production, and that is the ability to advertise to people. We make our own products,
[1:25:12.740 --> 1:25:16.260]  we have our own website, so we don't have sponsors. We're not subject to boycotts there,
[1:25:16.260 --> 1:25:22.820]  but we can have Google lean on Adroll, and Adroll will cut off their nose to spite our face,
[1:25:22.820 --> 1:25:25.860]  is what they're doing. So they're shutting down our ads, but we're not going to stand still.
[1:25:25.860 --> 1:25:30.660]  Just like Donald Trump, when they come after him, he goes straight to the people, and he talks to
[1:25:30.660 --> 1:25:33.460]  them, and he's going to be doing more of that in the next couple of weeks, and that's what we do.
[1:25:34.100 --> 1:25:38.580]  When they come after us, we go to those of you who have stood by us for many years,
[1:25:38.580 --> 1:25:44.580]  and we really appreciate that. And to show our appreciation, we had not only a 13-hour
[1:25:44.580 --> 1:25:50.580]  program that was live on Wednesday, but we also put together some specials, our Defense of Liberty
[1:25:50.580 --> 1:25:55.380]  mega specials, and we've given you discounts off of many of our most popular products there.
[1:25:55.380 --> 1:26:02.420]  Silver Bullet, that's colloidal silver, 33% off stock price. Supermail Vitality, 25% off,
[1:26:02.420 --> 1:26:06.900]  Brainforce, 25% off. That's one of my favorite supplements, folks, that really
[1:26:07.460 --> 1:26:11.220]  focuses your mind, and it does it without making you jittery like coffee.
[1:26:11.220 --> 1:26:17.940]  Survival Shield, X2, nascent iodine, 25% off. Caveman, our newest product, our paleo formulation,
[1:26:17.940 --> 1:26:24.500]  it's got bone broth, it's got chaga mushroom, it's got turmeric root. All those are very,
[1:26:25.060 --> 1:26:29.300]  very helpful things, things that you should be having in your diet that you don't get in the
[1:26:29.300 --> 1:26:34.740]  modern American diet. So we put it together in a great tasting formula that's easy to take.
[1:26:34.740 --> 1:26:39.860]  It's a liquid formula. You can make a drink out of it. It's chocolate flavored. It's a great way
[1:26:39.860 --> 1:26:45.060]  to take essential nutrients. We've put it down at 33% off. We also have lithographs of Donald
[1:26:45.060 --> 1:26:48.660]  Trump, Ronald Reagan. You've seen the one of Ronald Reagan. That's a classic lithograph.
[1:26:48.660 --> 1:26:52.980]  This is the same artist that did that for the Republican National Committee. We have 700 of
[1:26:52.980 --> 1:26:58.980]  those in limited edition. We had one that is new of Donald Trump, done in the same style. Very,
[1:26:58.980 --> 1:27:05.140]  very high quality, very limited edition of that. Those are $19.95. And also free Alexa Pure.
[1:27:05.140 --> 1:27:10.180]  If you get three months of info wars like storeable food supplies. So we've given you a lot of
[1:27:10.180 --> 1:27:14.900]  discounts. We really appreciate you standing with us. And we want you to know that we are going to
[1:27:14.900 --> 1:27:19.060]  continue to stand and we are not going to give up any more than Donald Trump is going to get up.
[1:27:19.060 --> 1:27:23.620]  So let's go back to this C-span speech that he gave earlier today. We're going to continue to
[1:27:23.620 --> 1:27:28.100]  play this till we get this through here. That we don't need, but we're going to have regulations.
[1:27:28.100 --> 1:27:32.340]  It's going to be really strong and really good. And we're going to protect our environment. And
[1:27:32.340 --> 1:27:44.180]  we're going to protect the safety of our people and our workers. Another major promise is tax reform.
[1:27:44.900 --> 1:27:51.140]  We're going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on American business,
[1:27:51.140 --> 1:27:58.340]  and make our tax code more simple and much more fair for everyone, including the people and the
[1:27:58.340 --> 1:28:13.060]  business. We're going to push that through against the resistance of the Republicans
[1:28:13.060 --> 1:28:16.340]  and also the Federal Reserve's going to be raising interest rates. I hope you can get that through
[1:28:16.340 --> 1:28:23.380]  and get it through quickly. In anticipation of these and other changes jobs are already starting
[1:28:23.380 --> 1:28:28.980]  to pour back into our country. You see that. In fact, I think I did more than any other
[1:28:29.940 --> 1:28:35.460]  pre-president. They say president-elect. President-elect is meeting with Ford. He's
[1:28:35.460 --> 1:28:40.100]  meeting with Chrysler. He's meeting with General Motors. I just want to save a little time.
[1:28:42.100 --> 1:28:49.700]  Because Ford and Fiat Chrysler General Motors, Sprint, Intel, and so many others
[1:28:49.700 --> 1:28:56.580]  are now, because of the election result, making major investments in the United States,
[1:28:57.220 --> 1:29:03.220]  expanding production, and hiring more workers. And they're going back to Michigan,
[1:29:03.220 --> 1:29:07.940]  and they're going back to Ohio, and they're going back to Pennsylvania, and they're going back to
[1:29:07.940 --> 1:29:19.780]  North Carolina, and to Florida. All right, so that's Donald Trump at CSPAC. We're going to take a
[1:29:19.780 --> 1:29:24.020]  break, and Alex Jones is going to be taking the show, and he's going to have a guest coming up
[1:29:24.020 --> 1:29:30.020]  in the next hour, Joy Vila. She's the person who made her career simply by wearing a Donald Trump
[1:29:30.020 --> 1:29:45.940]  dress. That should tell CNN something shouldn't it. And Glenn Beck, stay with us. Alex Jones will be right back.
[1:29:49.060 --> 1:29:59.940]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:59.940 --> 1:30:05.940]  Former CIA officer Brian Dean Wright stated in an interview with Tucker Carlson that rumors
[1:30:05.940 --> 1:30:10.980]  about intelligence operatives withholding information from President Trump are true,
[1:30:10.980 --> 1:30:16.020]  and that leaks are being made intentionally to discredit the president. He also said that these
[1:30:16.020 --> 1:30:21.860]  rogue intelligence officers are playing a dangerous game, and that he supports the president in
[1:30:21.860 --> 1:30:27.300]  finding these people and throwing them in jail. We have to ask ourselves how safe is our country
[1:30:27.300 --> 1:30:33.060]  when we have shadow elements in various intelligence agencies withholding information from the president
[1:30:33.060 --> 1:30:38.340]  that could be pertinent to him being able to make fast decisions in regard to the safety of the nation.
[1:30:38.340 --> 1:30:43.460]  And lastly, given the history of nefarious conduct by various intelligence agencies,
[1:30:43.460 --> 1:30:48.900]  should Trump make an executive order within constitutional restrictions to drain the swamp
[1:30:48.900 --> 1:30:54.180]  within the intelligence agencies before they enact a coup against him, which would undermine
[1:30:54.180 --> 1:30:59.620]  the American democratic process. This is Milly Weaver reporting for infowars.com.

[1:33:28.340 --> 1:33:33.220]  It's not high to say humanity is really waking up right now. Alex Jones here to host the second half
[1:33:33.220 --> 1:33:36.980]  of the transmission, taking care of some very important family matters, other issues that the
[1:33:36.980 --> 1:33:44.580]  good Lord has again delivered us on. Once again, it is of course Friday the 24th of day of February
[1:33:44.580 --> 1:33:52.180]  2017, and I am so wound up to get in studio and get on air. The mainstream media itself
[1:33:53.380 --> 1:33:59.060]  has gotten so incredibly corrupt, five times worse than they were just a few years ago,
[1:33:59.060 --> 1:34:04.820]  twice as worse I'd say, than even during the campaign, that it's completely illustrative of
[1:34:04.820 --> 1:34:09.380]  everything I'm talking about. Now I want to go back to more of the seat-packed speech, even though I
[1:34:09.380 --> 1:34:13.460]  love to talk. Everybody knows that because I want to finish up with a few of the things that
[1:34:13.460 --> 1:34:20.260]  Trump had to say, but everything he's saying is classic Americana, classic Renaissance,
[1:34:20.260 --> 1:34:28.900]  classic nationalism, classic power of the people, huge success. It's the model of any prosperous
[1:34:28.900 --> 1:34:34.580]  country, and you've not just got CNN, ABC, CBS, Stephen Colbert, and everybody else saying,
[1:34:34.580 --> 1:34:42.020]  this is totally insane. You've got Glenn Beck on CNN, CBS, ABC is everywhere going.
[1:34:42.020 --> 1:34:47.300]  It's very dangerous what Trump and Banner are doing, economic nationalism. We can't run our own
[1:34:47.300 --> 1:34:53.620]  affairs. He takes total globalism in our country, totally captured and selling out to world interest
[1:34:53.620 --> 1:34:57.860]  and says that if we do things that are good for our jobs and our industry, if Americans were to
[1:34:57.860 --> 1:35:02.420]  organize as a union, that's what a country's supposed to be as the original union. It has
[1:35:02.420 --> 1:35:08.420]  ideas, it has policies, it has beliefs, it has unifying spiritual systems, cultural systems,
[1:35:08.420 --> 1:35:12.660]  and then they have a goal of what that culture wants to be. And normally cultures are known
[1:35:12.660 --> 1:35:19.220]  for different things that they strive at and they succeed at. Or the barbarians. You've had
[1:35:19.220 --> 1:35:25.620]  those throughout history in every sector of the world. During the murder, deaths, cannibalism,
[1:35:25.620 --> 1:35:30.260]  human sacrifice, things like that. Civilization is into art and literature and culture.
[1:35:31.700 --> 1:35:36.660]  But the globalists are bringing in a corporate barbatism, a barbarous system that totally,
[1:35:36.660 --> 1:35:41.780]  in a piratical way, wages war against humanity from a psychopathic, cold-blooded perspective.
[1:35:42.980 --> 1:35:47.940]  And that's all basically coming to an end because humanity is rediscovering itself right now.
[1:35:48.740 --> 1:35:50.660]  But look at these headlines I'm going to cover when we come back.
[1:35:51.540 --> 1:35:56.820]  CNN host blames intolerant father for 12-year-old girl not wanting to see a men's penis in the
[1:35:56.820 --> 1:36:02.500]  locker room. This has been said by Obama as well. This is Como who said you can't read WikiLeaks
[1:36:02.500 --> 1:36:06.660]  only he can. People say that sounds crazy. Why would he tweet that and say that? Because they're
[1:36:06.660 --> 1:36:13.140]  told to to get you used to sexualizing your children. This is pedophilia. I don't know if
[1:36:13.140 --> 1:36:19.700]  him saying it is a promotion of himself. I'm not saying he's one. Oh, certainly not. No, I'm saying
[1:36:19.700 --> 1:36:26.580]  that saying how dare your daughter not want to see a man in the locker room with his penis.
[1:36:26.580 --> 1:36:33.700]  That you're intolerant. See how that works? Sexualizing your children, it starts with
[1:36:33.700 --> 1:36:38.020]  ending genders. They're not having you accept other genders. They're ending them. And all
[1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:41.620]  these well-mitting liberals are like, let's be nice to someone who thinks they're a dog or you
[1:36:41.620 --> 1:36:45.220]  think you're blind. The state will pay to dump bleach in your eyes and then we'll pay for all
[1:36:45.220 --> 1:36:52.180]  your welfare for the rest of your lives. This is mental illness. Mental illness,
[1:36:52.180 --> 1:36:56.180]  they're imposing as a cultural virus to shut us down. Doesn't mean we hate anybody.
[1:36:59.060 --> 1:37:02.820]  In fact, the first rollouts of different things they come out with sometimes are kind of interesting,
[1:37:02.820 --> 1:37:05.860]  but it's meant like candy to make you think it's something really good,
[1:37:05.860 --> 1:37:08.900]  though it sucks you down that vortex. So I don't hate anybody.
[1:37:11.540 --> 1:37:15.060]  And of course, humans explore things and do things. They're taking that natural
[1:37:15.780 --> 1:37:20.180]  curiosity, all those things that happen as you're an adult and they twist it when you're a child
[1:37:20.180 --> 1:37:27.460]  and tell you you're bad because you're freaked out by a 15-year-old or 16-year-old young man
[1:37:27.460 --> 1:37:33.620]  in the women's little girls' showers at a public school. Oh, and now you're upset about white boards
[1:37:33.620 --> 1:37:37.300]  so all over the country, colleges are removing them. I saw that in Michigan
[1:37:38.020 --> 1:37:42.260]  two days ago with the university pulling it out and the Detroit press covering it, mainstream news,
[1:37:42.260 --> 1:37:46.500]  straight face. Oh, good. Get rid of the load. Somebody might write on them. Might hurt someone.
[1:37:46.500 --> 1:37:50.980]  That's saying banned books. Banned books for someone might write something hurts your feelings.
[1:37:50.980 --> 1:37:55.620]  See? It's the end of culture, the end of language. And then I looked and found it all over the
[1:37:55.620 --> 1:37:58.980]  country and also in some areas of Europe, they're getting rid of white boards because
[1:37:58.980 --> 1:38:03.140]  it might hurt somebody. Somebody might exercise free speech in front of others,
[1:38:03.140 --> 1:38:09.780]  and that is the ultimate crime. And it gets worse. Glenn Beck, Bannon's Economic Nationalism
[1:38:09.780 --> 1:38:15.140]  Agenda is not conservative. It's dangerous. Mainstream media claims nothing juicy at 119 hours
[1:38:15.140 --> 1:38:20.660]  of CNN leaks. Of course, there is a bunch. Glenn Beck, Bannon's Economic Nationalism Agenda
[1:38:20.660 --> 1:38:25.540]  is not conservative. It's dangerous. That's just saying you have a country. The Ninth Circuit
[1:38:25.540 --> 1:38:31.060]  banned wearing American flags at school, having American flags on your shirt or on your car because
[1:38:31.060 --> 1:38:37.860]  it's hateful. It might hurt someone. First, it's banned the KKK, banned some black racist group,
[1:38:37.860 --> 1:38:42.180]  then it's banned white boards, banned brown bags, banned that American flags, then it's
[1:38:42.180 --> 1:38:46.580]  takedown all the statues. It's the end of language. Then of course, again,
[1:38:48.500 --> 1:38:53.220]  Chris Coma, what an embarrassing creature, but he thinks he's going to condition you and tell
[1:38:53.220 --> 1:38:59.460]  their audience of already Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness, cooks that, okay, the next
[1:38:59.460 --> 1:39:05.220]  thing is you got to let your daughters have, you know, hell, you have a senior in high school in
[1:39:05.220 --> 1:39:11.460]  those showers with your daughter. Then if somebody says anything, well, you're a bad person. And
[1:39:11.460 --> 1:39:16.180]  these aren't like cherry-picked examples. It's meant to be extreme. I mean, they had Melissa
[1:39:16.180 --> 1:39:20.900]  Harris Perry go on TV two years ago and say, your kids belong to us, and we're getting rid of the
[1:39:20.900 --> 1:39:28.740]  family, basically. And as we see the family fall apart, we understand they're single parents. We
[1:39:28.740 --> 1:39:33.620]  understand communities help. But the point is, that's the good side of it. The bad side of it is,
[1:39:33.620 --> 1:39:39.540]  it was all engineered. So as we see communities in crisis, we say, this is bad. They go, oh, you
[1:39:39.540 --> 1:39:43.860]  hate those communities. No, we don't. Look at this one. Now, this is the biggest one yet. And then
[1:39:43.860 --> 1:39:48.260]  I'm going to hit the really big news. Chinese Catholics fear Pope Francis will wrap them out
[1:39:48.260 --> 1:39:52.020]  to Communists now that he's officially merged with the Communist Party and they have accepted
[1:39:52.020 --> 1:39:59.380]  Pope Francis and the Catholic Church. They've been killing Catholics for 500 years in China.
[1:40:00.100 --> 1:40:02.740]  Japan had started accepting Catholics 400 years ago.
[1:40:02.740 --> 1:40:08.980]  So because they did accept Catholics, there's, there's movies made about how the Japanese
[1:40:08.980 --> 1:40:17.540]  say Catholics. But China's been killing Catholics during different periods for 500 years. And they
[1:40:17.540 --> 1:40:21.780]  still do. And for the first time ever, the huge underground church is being told, we want you
[1:40:21.780 --> 1:40:24.980]  to make contact with us. Tell us what you're doing, because we're going to make it okay,
[1:40:24.980 --> 1:40:30.420]  because the new Catholic Church is communism. This guy is a communist. He was a communist
[1:40:30.420 --> 1:40:36.340]  in South America who also helped round up communists that weren't following orders the grassroots
[1:40:36.340 --> 1:40:41.300]  and killed them. He's known for rounding up priests and villagers by the thousands and killing
[1:40:41.300 --> 1:40:45.860]  them. So he's worse than a communist. He's a globalist controller who manages the communist slave
[1:40:45.860 --> 1:40:50.660]  farms. Remember, Obama, what the South American said, you'll have communism in your country,
[1:40:50.660 --> 1:40:54.740]  mega banks will be private, and then they'll come in and work with you, meaning gang rape you.
[1:40:54.740 --> 1:40:58.580]  But it's okay because Obama said it can't have air conditioning, can't have cars. It's okay,
[1:40:58.580 --> 1:41:04.020]  he said it. The elites will be rich. You will have nothing, but I'm black. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:41:04.020 --> 1:41:09.700]  That doesn't sound racist or classes at all. So that's coming up.
[1:41:13.540 --> 1:41:16.100]  I want to play a few more minutes of Trump. And we've got
[1:41:17.700 --> 1:41:21.780]  Colbert attacking me saying I'm like a guy, you know, steroids and peyote,
[1:41:21.780 --> 1:41:30.500]  because they can take clips and there's a clip they play where they go. I'm anti-gay or anti-gay.
[1:41:30.500 --> 1:41:35.300]  Of course, I really said I'm not anti-gay, but he goes, oh, we're not cutting these clips up.
[1:41:35.300 --> 1:41:38.740]  So to show you here's some more, a bunch of real quick clips out of context.
[1:41:41.140 --> 1:41:45.140]  So we're going to analyze this propaganda and go over it. So just like I made fun and I said,
[1:41:45.140 --> 1:41:49.060]  Hillary clearly didn't open the pickle jar. It didn't pop. Everybody did it themselves and said,
[1:41:49.060 --> 1:41:53.060]  yeah, she's a liar. And then Kimmel had to say, okay, Alex Jones is right. It's true. But I knew
[1:41:53.060 --> 1:41:58.420]  they'd take the bait on the pickles. Just like J.Lo, I knew it'd be hundreds of publications.
[1:41:58.420 --> 1:42:00.740]  It was in more than that. It was all over the nightly news. You name it. I said,
[1:42:00.740 --> 1:42:04.740]  if she loves bringing in Somalis with a radical Islamic faith there,
[1:42:04.740 --> 1:42:07.940]  is even beyond orthodox, it's very radical, where they just say women are animals,
[1:42:07.940 --> 1:42:10.420]  rape them all you want. Even if they're hooded, they have no rights.
[1:42:12.580 --> 1:42:15.780]  And I said, if she loves that so much, she should go be amongst the Somalis,
[1:42:15.780 --> 1:42:19.300]  where women literally, you don't even see them on the streets. They are total slaves, total failed
[1:42:19.300 --> 1:42:25.220]  culture, total nightmare society beyond road warrior, beyond anything you've seen in fiction.
[1:42:25.220 --> 1:42:33.380]  I mean, it's hell on earth. Absolute hell on earth. Women are still sold on slave blocks.
[1:42:34.260 --> 1:42:39.700]  They're still sold up on the big slave stages. That's on record. Look it up. I'm going to do
[1:42:39.700 --> 1:42:46.740]  whole reports on it. But then alt-right hosts thought it was okay to gang rape on Jennifer
[1:42:46.740 --> 1:42:51.540]  Bolips to also see the vibe and everybody else trying to manipulate people in the inner city.
[1:42:51.540 --> 1:42:58.180]  He said, Alex Jones wants to rape J.Lo. And they show some really short clip of me saying
[1:42:59.220 --> 1:43:02.660]  she needs to get gang raped. Now I said, if she loves that and wants us to get gang raped
[1:43:02.660 --> 1:43:05.940]  and wants to bring that here and then defendant cover it up like Europe has done in Sweden,
[1:43:05.940 --> 1:43:10.260]  everywhere else coming out in the news, then she should go there if gang raping is so great.
[1:43:10.260 --> 1:43:14.180]  If she wants to bring the gang raping here, I'm clearly speaking out against rape.
[1:43:14.180 --> 1:43:18.500]  I'm clearly saying it's wrong. It's bad. But I knew they'd take it and misrepresent it.
[1:43:18.500 --> 1:43:22.500]  And then I know we're bigger than they are in many cases. So those people will come here
[1:43:22.500 --> 1:43:27.460]  and find the truth of what I said and they're further discredited. That's how they operate.
[1:43:28.420 --> 1:43:32.020]  When everyone knows we've been at the tip of the spear trying to fight Islam,
[1:43:32.020 --> 1:43:37.860]  abusing women and the gang raping going on all over the world. But we become, through their
[1:43:38.740 --> 1:43:44.660]  alchemy of baloney, the alchemy of BS, we become the gang rapers. So that's all coming up at first.
[1:43:47.460 --> 1:43:52.180]  Why Trump is dominating, why he's so important and why now it's unbelievable to see the real
[1:43:52.180 --> 1:43:55.860]  deal actually unfolding and the incredible speech he gave today and how to bring down
[1:43:55.860 --> 1:44:01.620]  globalism. I'm going to say it all and cover it all today. Then Nicobar's BS, we're going to hit it
[1:44:01.620 --> 1:44:08.420]  all. But before I do that in the ongoing civil war, I want to explain to some of the new listeners
[1:44:08.420 --> 1:44:14.420]  how this works. We didn't have sponsors that we had pulled from us. That's the normal thing,
[1:44:14.420 --> 1:44:19.220]  trying to go up to your sponsors. A boy got you. We had Adroll that's the exclusive advertising
[1:44:19.220 --> 1:44:24.340]  dealer of Google. So Google didn't have the liability. In my view, it's a front company of
[1:44:24.340 --> 1:44:29.780]  Google that's basically admitted the trade publications. They came out on Monday and
[1:44:29.780 --> 1:44:36.340]  said, you no longer have a right to advertise in the internet market through Google. You understand?
[1:44:36.340 --> 1:44:40.420]  That's saying I can't go. Like if I showed up at Dick's Sporting Goods, said I wanted to buy
[1:44:40.420 --> 1:44:44.660]  some golf clubs, I said, sorry, you're a conservative or you're white or you're black or whatever,
[1:44:44.660 --> 1:44:49.060]  you know, you're Jewish, you're whatever, you can't buy golf clubs. It's the same thing.
[1:44:49.860 --> 1:44:54.340]  It's not that we even violated the terms. It was a milk toast ads, you know, ads for supplements
[1:44:54.340 --> 1:44:58.980]  and things. They said, you are fake news. You are involved in politics. That's not allowed.
[1:44:58.980 --> 1:45:02.580]  Well, but then they take political advertising. They're saying someone in the federal
[1:45:03.220 --> 1:45:07.700]  election commission, said Alex Jones isn't allowed to operate. Well, give me the letter.
[1:45:07.700 --> 1:45:12.420]  Let me have my day in court. Let me know who to sue. Well, you won't tell me. So I know who I got to.
[1:45:13.060 --> 1:45:17.060]  That's more stuff I got to do. But okay. I'm going to sit there just hope it goes away, Adroll.
[1:45:17.060 --> 1:45:20.020]  The word is everybody else is scared. A bunch of other people got banned, but they're trying to
[1:45:20.020 --> 1:45:24.500]  work it out with Adroll. And what can we do, Adroll? How can we kiss your butt, Adroll? How can we
[1:45:24.500 --> 1:45:29.860]  no, no, you want to rack a tear on us? In my opinion, in my view, what this appears to be fine. You
[1:45:29.860 --> 1:45:34.580]  want litigation, I guess we'll have to do it. But here's the issue. We made 3.3 million last year
[1:45:34.580 --> 1:45:39.540]  to fund the operation, not profit, but money that made the funder operation advertising our products
[1:45:39.540 --> 1:45:44.820]  outside of our own sphere and show. Okay. Cause we want to reach other people. That's what we're
[1:45:44.820 --> 1:45:49.780]  doing. And they came in and they said, you can't do that anymore after three years, almost three years.
[1:45:49.780 --> 1:45:54.740]  And so now I'm sitting here looking at this happening and I'm, and we projected the graph
[1:45:54.740 --> 1:45:58.500]  because it takes time to build these up and figure out where to advertise and how it works.
[1:45:58.500 --> 1:46:02.820]  And a lot of work went into this and a lot of money we paid them. They pull the rug up after
[1:46:02.820 --> 1:46:09.780]  three year relationship and say bye-bye and then put a false name on us and claim we don't exist.
[1:46:09.780 --> 1:46:13.380]  And we're bad, just reputable people with no proof. Well, that's libelous. That's slander. That's
[1:46:13.380 --> 1:46:18.820]  defamation. I mean, the Washington Post had to pull their big list. Everybody's using two months ago
[1:46:18.820 --> 1:46:22.420]  admitting they don't know where they got it. Well, it was just made up and we know by who,
[1:46:22.420 --> 1:46:27.620]  Democratic Party. So the Democratic Party wants to ban political voices or just free speech in
[1:46:27.620 --> 1:46:31.860]  this country or free speech groups who have separate businesses that fund their speech.
[1:46:31.860 --> 1:46:35.460]  You're going to discriminate against that. I mean, you are in so much trouble politically,
[1:46:35.460 --> 1:46:43.300]  culturally, you name it, AdRoll. But then we brought in about a million for the last four days.
[1:46:43.300 --> 1:46:50.340]  That's gross though. We discount our products so much that that's only $500,000. And I'm not
[1:46:50.340 --> 1:46:54.260]  bitching. That's great. Thank you, audience. It's wonderful. Most other shows couldn't do anything
[1:46:54.260 --> 1:46:57.940]  like that. We sell products discounted. They're high quality. You get them. Thank you for the
[1:46:57.940 --> 1:47:03.860]  support. So it's a victory. I've got to make this up with other fundraisers over the next year.
[1:47:04.980 --> 1:47:09.060]  The money we made last year from it's budgeted. It just happens to be about the extra money we had
[1:47:09.060 --> 1:47:13.300]  for expansion. So it's a chilling effect of our free speech and of what we're trying to do, not
[1:47:13.300 --> 1:47:18.100]  letting us into the market. Just like for a decade, we fought this. We don't sell guns that we fought
[1:47:18.100 --> 1:47:25.140]  it. You've got gun dealers, the major gun shops, then sporting goods stores. First, it was little
[1:47:25.140 --> 1:47:29.620]  small gun dealers out of, you know, mom and pop outfits, you know, out of little storefronts.
[1:47:29.620 --> 1:47:34.740]  They banned those. Most magazines, TV ads, radio ads, did it a lot of places. Newspapers all got
[1:47:34.740 --> 1:47:38.900]  together and banned those. That was about 15, 20 years ago. Everybody remembers that. And then next,
[1:47:38.900 --> 1:47:43.380]  it was sporting goods stores. And then they just said, no guns advertised period anywhere. Okay.
[1:47:44.100 --> 1:47:48.020]  Now, some magazines would say, oh, we'll take an insert and still do it and get around that,
[1:47:48.020 --> 1:47:52.740]  because people file lawsuits. So they're blocking your access to the market. It's racketeering.
[1:47:52.740 --> 1:47:57.540]  It's like blocking little black kids from going into school in Alabama or places like
[1:47:57.540 --> 1:48:05.780]  Arkansas in 1959. Same deal. Same deal. You're saying you're not allowed in this restaurant.
[1:48:05.780 --> 1:48:09.700]  You're not allowed at this train station. You don't get service at this hotel. Get out of here.
[1:48:11.460 --> 1:48:17.060]  Not that, oh, your ads violate our rules. You, your website is political and you're not allowed
[1:48:17.060 --> 1:48:22.260]  to make money. Go in the corner and die. You can't have a job. Can you imagine what they'll do
[1:48:22.260 --> 1:48:27.220]  once they have total digital control and no cash anymore? The big grand thing is to get rid of
[1:48:27.220 --> 1:48:31.780]  cash and track everything you do because they can tax you, track you and turn you off. This is the
[1:48:31.780 --> 1:48:37.140]  mark of the beast. And Zuckerberg and his new report that came out said that they want Chinese style
[1:48:37.140 --> 1:48:42.900]  controls through a web censorship system and a web ID and web taxes and a web social score
[1:48:42.900 --> 1:48:47.860]  that corporations and governments like a no fly list just magically make behind closed doors.
[1:48:47.860 --> 1:48:54.100]  And it just becomes a trashy social score off the side of your head digitally when they face Kenya.
[1:48:54.100 --> 1:48:59.460]  With a bunch of made up crap they threw into your file just for fun. Do we as a culture
[1:48:59.460 --> 1:49:04.820]  in humanity think that's a good idea? No, we're going to reject that just like we're rejecting
[1:49:04.820 --> 1:49:10.580]  globalism all over the world and we're going to reject Hillary Clinton. The elite were so stupid
[1:49:10.580 --> 1:49:16.660]  they thought that they could just put a walking crazy evil looking corpse with all these crimes
[1:49:16.660 --> 1:49:21.700]  behind her with Bill like another zombie with all their corruption and the arrogant crazy Pelosi
[1:49:21.700 --> 1:49:26.180]  not knowing what planet she's on and force feed us that. That's why internal poll numbers
[1:49:26.180 --> 1:49:32.820]  showed 25% of blacks voting for Trump almost 40% of Hispanics. Primary numbers showed more than that.
[1:49:34.020 --> 1:49:37.300]  But they stole a bunch of states and they manipulated the demographics because they were
[1:49:37.300 --> 1:49:41.780]  even more scared not just a Trump winning but of the fact that if Hispanics and blacks ever talked
[1:49:41.780 --> 1:49:46.020]  to each other and find out they actually voted for Trump then the whole paradigm shifts of the
[1:49:46.020 --> 1:49:50.500]  bullying and the intimidation to go along with it and then it's total collapse for the new world
[1:49:50.500 --> 1:49:55.540]  order. Then you hear that whole CPAC speech we just started part of. You know he's not just saying
[1:49:55.540 --> 1:50:00.660]  we're going to cut taxes and bring jobs back and he's saying we're going to have coal, we're going
[1:50:00.660 --> 1:50:05.620]  to have oil, we're going to develop. He's saying we're open for business to all the multinationals
[1:50:05.620 --> 1:50:09.780]  who are already greedy and self-serving. They just manipulate things together. The fact that he's
[1:50:09.780 --> 1:50:14.500]  saying that means we're open and it makes us competitive so they all come back ladies and
[1:50:14.500 --> 1:50:18.820]  gentlemen and that's why the stock market goes up. That's why it's all exploding because the United
[1:50:18.820 --> 1:50:24.660]  States was already set up to dominate the future and it was sold out to other special interests
[1:50:24.660 --> 1:50:29.540]  and now we've gotten control of the country back and that's why they've got the CIA and the FBI
[1:50:29.540 --> 1:50:33.700]  and all these agencies saying we're not going to do a word you say president because they were
[1:50:33.700 --> 1:50:39.620]  already hijackers put in control by the globalist and so you're in the middle of a giant civil war
[1:50:39.620 --> 1:50:45.220]  but the good news is we have courage, we have honor, we have the truth on our side and the people
[1:50:45.220 --> 1:50:49.860]  are rapidly waking up and that's why they're in total panic and Maxine Waters is calling
[1:50:49.860 --> 1:50:56.260]  Trump's whole cabinet scumbags because they know they're losing, they're losing, they're arrogant
[1:50:56.260 --> 1:51:03.460]  losers, they will fail. In these uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method
[1:51:03.460 --> 1:51:08.180]  to cook food and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking
[1:51:08.180 --> 1:51:13.220]  over an open fire then there's a much better way. The Minivan rocket stove is a biomass burning
[1:51:13.220 --> 1:51:18.180]  cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel. The Minivan stove
[1:51:18.180 --> 1:51:22.980]  is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable. For the finest in survival cooking

[1:54:12.500 --> 1:54:19.060]  Trump is our giant battering ram. Just hours ago at CPAC, he came out
[1:54:19.060 --> 1:54:28.900]  speaking to the Republicans and he said, we are taking on the fake news. We're in a war
[1:54:29.540 --> 1:54:35.140]  with the fake news. We are fighting the fake news. We know they're the fake news,
[1:54:36.260 --> 1:54:40.980]  but they're not being faked or qualmo up. They're saying let grown men and little girls locker rooms,
[1:54:40.980 --> 1:54:44.500]  let them see their genitals, or you're not a loving person. So that's saying,
[1:54:44.500 --> 1:54:50.980]  let pedophilia take place. That's what it is. But see, oh, because it's for transgendered,
[1:54:50.980 --> 1:54:56.260]  it's okay. The man thinks he's a woman, so let him in there with your kids. They're seeing what
[1:54:56.260 --> 1:55:01.700]  they can get away with. They're seeing how far they can move the Overton window where you'll just
[1:55:01.700 --> 1:55:08.900]  accept anything. They're trying to get you to lay down and they're saying, let a grown men come in
[1:55:08.900 --> 1:55:17.140]  girls locker rooms at the YMCA, at your public school, at anywhere, let them come, let them come,
[1:55:17.140 --> 1:55:21.940]  let men that want to come in with your daughter in a shower, let them do it at your hateful.
[1:55:23.460 --> 1:55:28.580]  And accept Obamacare written by big banks and the Republican party to rape you or you're a racist
[1:55:29.220 --> 1:55:35.300]  or you're a Russian spy. Oh my gosh, he wants to control the borders and deport aggravated
[1:55:35.300 --> 1:55:43.540]  felons in Travis County. The sheriff is admittedly letting go people that are rapists, that have
[1:55:43.540 --> 1:55:50.660]  committed crimes because they're illegals. Who cares if they're illegal or not? Lock their ass up
[1:55:50.660 --> 1:55:55.300]  and when they're done, deport them. If you're in Cancun two days after they tell you, they call the
[1:55:55.300 --> 1:56:02.100]  hotel you're at and say, is this person there? Then the police come. I mean, Mexico has that,
[1:56:02.100 --> 1:56:07.700]  China has that. Why don't we five time deportee arrested for serial rape in central Texas?
[1:56:08.260 --> 1:56:14.180]  It's okay though. This is the insanity. This is really going on.
[1:56:16.100 --> 1:56:22.100]  The NSM is owned by the globalist. They have Glenn Beck going as the supposed conservative.
[1:56:22.100 --> 1:56:28.740]  I know it's horrible that Ben and believes America should actually have jobs for Americans.
[1:56:28.740 --> 1:56:33.380]  Isn't that, it's dangerous. Yes. And the CIA operative Anderson group was, yes. Yes, that's
[1:56:33.380 --> 1:56:38.900]  horrible. Can you imagine? Yes. And he also says people should have oxygen. I disagree. We should
[1:56:38.900 --> 1:56:44.020]  strangle them. I mean, that's the equivalent. It's just totally insane. But they say it with
[1:56:44.020 --> 1:56:48.820]  all this gravitas. It's so dangerous to have nationalism. Okay, well then who runs our country?
[1:56:48.820 --> 1:56:53.940]  Oh, the TPP and the multinationals that Trump just killed. And Beck always sits there with this,
[1:56:53.940 --> 1:56:59.620]  like sitting on a toilet look, like he's all has this gravitas and has this old powerful toad
[1:56:59.620 --> 1:57:04.020]  that knows all. You're a false toad. You're not a golden toad. You're not even a little frosty toad.
[1:57:04.020 --> 1:57:11.940]  You're an ugly toad, a lying toad. You are a little mercenary weasel that just runs around
[1:57:11.940 --> 1:57:15.700]  there to control the conservative movement. And Beck knew that Hillary's going to shut down the
[1:57:15.700 --> 1:57:24.180]  real right and the Patriots. So what did they do? They had their stand in ready. Glenn Beck,
[1:57:24.180 --> 1:57:28.900]  for after everybody was shut down, he'd still play that part of the loyal opposition and fall down
[1:57:28.900 --> 1:57:34.900]  like a clown when he was supposed to. Well, guess what? You lost, Beck. Now, crawl to CNN. I can't
[1:57:34.900 --> 1:57:38.980]  believe Clear Channel even has you on the air. Your ratings are gone. Your sponsors are gone.
[1:57:38.980 --> 1:57:44.180]  You're a joke and a fraud. And thank God there is a God. I'm going to come back and play the
[1:57:44.180 --> 1:57:47.540]  Trump clip at first and then get it all in the nose. I've got to have a special guest coming
[1:57:47.540 --> 1:57:54.420]  up. You know, that lady in the bombshell, make America great dress. They tried to get fired
[1:57:54.420 --> 1:57:58.900]  and everything. How dare you have free speech. Now she's a superstar. Well, that's right. It's
[1:57:58.900 --> 1:58:05.780]  amazing. She's going to be joining us. That's Joy Vila. Now, briefly, because I didn't plug this
[1:58:05.780 --> 1:58:10.980]  hour I need to. We're trying to raise back the money and throw it in their face that they took
[1:58:10.980 --> 1:58:16.180]  away from us that we had budgeted for the next year, projected by kicking us off any ads on
[1:58:16.180 --> 1:58:20.420]  Google platforms because we're subhuman and don't exist. And it's a chilling effect for everybody
[1:58:20.420 --> 1:58:25.060]  else, you know, to shut up or you'll be permanently deleted into the Phantom Zone.
[1:58:25.620 --> 1:58:30.660]  Well, the specials are all still running and we're almost sold out of the lower scan with
[1:58:30.660 --> 1:58:35.460]  Donald Trump with the laser etching. We've got a bunch of other specials that are also running
[1:58:35.460 --> 1:58:41.220]  across the board. Thank you all for your support infowarstore.com. Massive discounts up to 50%
[1:58:41.220 --> 1:58:46.500]  off on some products infowarstore.com. Thank you all for defending free speech and not giving up
[1:58:46.500 --> 1:58:53.140]  because we're winning. Why would you? Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years,
[1:58:53.140 --> 1:58:58.420]  our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[1:58:58.420 --> 1:59:04.260]  We are now introducing caveman by infowarslife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone
[1:59:04.260 --> 1:59:10.660]  broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting
[1:59:10.660 --> 1:59:15.620]  formula. Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization
[1:59:15.620 --> 1:59:19.700]  that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[1:59:19.700 --> 1:59:24.260]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance,
[1:59:24.260 --> 1:59:29.860]  the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength for the outside structure full of
[1:59:29.860 --> 1:59:34.340]  minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body. This is the
[1:59:34.340 --> 1:59:39.620]  engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as
[1:59:39.620 --> 1:59:44.020]  hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[1:59:44.020 --> 1:59:47.540]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[1:59:47.540 --> 2:00:04.020]  at infowarslife.com today. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:04.020 --> 2:00:14.340]  We're less than a month and a half in and already defending global electronics from enemies foreign
[2:00:14.340 --> 2:00:20.820]  and domestic. It's Alex Jones. I don't know, I just love this Van Halen song, the guitar and the
[2:00:20.820 --> 2:00:25.140]  way it all like transcends right here in this moment. Like let's just fade mightily face down
[2:00:25.140 --> 2:00:34.660]  and look at the globe for a moment as we watch. Just think about freedom. Humanity is reawakening.
[2:00:35.300 --> 2:00:42.580]  Spirit of freedom. God is rising. I feel sorry for those that aren't partaking of it. Spirit of
[2:00:42.580 --> 2:00:58.420]  life is rising. That's part right here. I love that song when I was first like 11 years old.
[2:01:01.220 --> 2:01:05.220]  Now it's the record store. My mom said, do you want a record? Yeah, I like Van Halen. I've heard
[2:01:05.220 --> 2:01:10.020]  on the radio. She goes, what do you want? Here's her new album. Boom. Got home in the little stereo.
[2:01:10.020 --> 2:01:13.700]  Put that record on. I listen to this record probably
[2:01:14.420 --> 2:01:16.580]  thousand times when I was right through the time I was a teenager.
[2:01:20.020 --> 2:01:27.220]  Amazing. Okay. Wow. I've got to focus on me. Good boy. I'm going to do it because I've got to guess
[2:01:27.220 --> 2:01:30.420]  come up the bottom of the hour. I'm going to come in and boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, play a bunch
[2:01:30.420 --> 2:01:34.180]  of clips and get to a bunch of analysis. But right now, we already had this live. David already
[2:01:34.180 --> 2:01:41.220]  covered it. Doing a great job. I want to play this clip of Trump saying, our enemies, the media,
[2:01:41.220 --> 2:01:45.300]  we're at war. And it's so true. We're always supposed to sit there and let them dictate and be our
[2:01:45.300 --> 2:01:50.340]  enemies and, and, and, you know, say literally let adult men come in the shower with your daughter
[2:01:50.340 --> 2:01:56.980]  or your hateful. That is promoting pedophilia. But they play these games with the terms.
[2:01:57.540 --> 2:02:02.900]  Nambla basically runs the UN folks. Okay. And they're so scared they're getting caught now
[2:02:02.900 --> 2:02:06.740]  that they're trying to normalize it and say, well, you're not just transgender. You're not
[2:02:06.740 --> 2:02:11.140]  just this. No, you like kids or you identify as a kid when you're a 50 year old pig like man.
[2:02:11.140 --> 2:02:15.940]  So somebody's eight year old daughter is okay. Well, then my 357 Magnum and the
[2:02:15.940 --> 2:02:19.940]  bullets that come out of it identify with your head. These bullets identify as your brain tissue.
[2:02:21.700 --> 2:02:26.180]  Is that okay too? You want to go, you know, with your ding dongs hanging out little girls?
[2:02:26.180 --> 2:02:31.140]  Is it okay if Smith and Wesson identifies as your brain tissue? I mean, I'm just asking.
[2:02:31.140 --> 2:02:36.660]  The headline will be Jones threatens to kill transgenders. I didn't say that. I said they
[2:02:36.660 --> 2:02:40.660]  use the whole transgender thing to say, let men come in showers with little girls or you're not
[2:02:40.660 --> 2:02:46.580]  tolerant. That's pedophilia. What's being pushed. I don't care who says it or if it's some asshole
[2:02:46.580 --> 2:02:51.300]  on CNN. Excuse me. I never use a lot of profanity on air. This is Christian show and I apologize
[2:02:51.300 --> 2:02:55.300]  and I'm going to stop it. But I got to tell you, there aren't names or words strong enough to
[2:02:55.300 --> 2:03:01.460]  describe people like that. I'm going to play that clip too. But let's play somebody who's actually
[2:03:01.460 --> 2:03:05.460]  trying to get jobs and turn our energy back on and bring us together. Someone who isn't up there
[2:03:05.460 --> 2:03:11.620]  telling us the number one issue is grown men with little girls and showers because of little girls
[2:03:11.620 --> 2:03:17.860]  don't like seeing men's penises. They're bad people. These are quotes. Okay. That's how weak-minded
[2:03:17.860 --> 2:03:23.060]  they think we are. Yes, CNN. I happen to have a 12 year old daughter. Let me immediately make sure
[2:03:23.060 --> 2:03:28.900]  that I will no doubt I catch a grown man in the shower with one of my daughters. I will beat
[2:03:28.900 --> 2:03:34.260]  your brains out with my bare hands. Guaranteed. Oh my God. So hateful. That's right. You can't
[2:03:34.260 --> 2:03:39.540]  rape little girls and you can't bring the fricking Islamist in here. That's a religion to rape
[2:03:39.540 --> 2:03:44.500]  and enslave women. I am sick of your crap. Excuse me. Let's go to the Trump. Here he is.
[2:03:44.500 --> 2:03:51.620]  And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It's fake phony fake.
[2:03:57.460 --> 2:04:03.380]  A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people and they are. They are the enemy
[2:04:03.380 --> 2:04:12.580]  of the people because they have no sources. They just make them up when there are none.
[2:04:12.580 --> 2:04:19.060]  I saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed. There are no nine people.
[2:04:19.060 --> 2:04:24.500]  I don't believe there was one or two people, nine people. And I said, give me a break because I
[2:04:24.500 --> 2:04:30.100]  know the people. I know who they talk to. There were no nine people, but they say nine people.
[2:04:30.100 --> 2:04:34.260]  And somebody reads it. They think, oh, nine people. They have nine sources. They make up sources.
[2:04:34.980 --> 2:04:40.020]  They're very dishonest people. I want McBrain, our great editor, or Jacobson, all the great folks.
[2:04:40.020 --> 2:04:43.540]  I want to take the speeches of promos that run continually. The whole thing's solid gold.
[2:04:44.180 --> 2:04:49.300]  I mean, it's absolutely true. The mainstream media is run by a bunch of old billionaire pedophiles,
[2:04:49.300 --> 2:04:54.420]  folks. And Trump knows that he's battling them. Gary Epstein, all of them. It's over, okay? If we
[2:04:54.420 --> 2:04:57.620]  win, it's over for all you child rapists. Just understand that. We'll be back. Stay with us.
[2:04:59.700 --> 2:05:05.700]  Former CIA officer Brian Dyn Wright stated in an interview with Tucker Carlson that rumors
[2:05:05.700 --> 2:05:10.740]  about intelligence operatives withholding information from President Trump are true
[2:05:10.740 --> 2:05:15.540]  and that leaks are being made intentionally to discredit the president. He also said that
[2:05:15.540 --> 2:05:21.380]  these rogue intelligence officers are playing a dangerous game and that he supports the president
[2:05:21.380 --> 2:05:26.660]  in finding these people and throwing them in jail. We have to ask ourselves how safe is our
[2:05:26.660 --> 2:05:32.100]  country when we have shadow elements in various intelligence agencies withholding information
[2:05:32.100 --> 2:05:36.660]  from the president that could be pertinent to him being able to make fast decisions in regard
[2:05:36.660 --> 2:05:41.860]  to the safety of the nation? And lastly, given the history of nefarious conduct by various
[2:05:41.860 --> 2:05:47.460]  intelligence agencies, should Trump make an executive order within constitutional restrictions
[2:05:47.460 --> 2:05:52.820]  to drain the swamp within the intelligence agencies before they enact a coup against him,
[2:05:52.820 --> 2:05:57.700]  which would undermine the American democratic process? This is Milly Weaver reporting for
[2:05:57.700 --> 2:06:04.340]  Infowars.com. Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its
[2:06:04.340 --> 2:06:09.860]  benefits before it became lost to our modern diets a processed junk. We are now introducing Caveman

[2:06:46.900 --> 2:06:51.700]  the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made

[2:07:19.060 --> 2:07:23.220]  or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person

[2:08:22.740 --> 2:08:34.260]  And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It's fake, phony, fake.
[2:08:40.180 --> 2:08:46.180]  A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people and they are, they are the enemy of
[2:08:46.180 --> 2:08:57.140]  the people because they have no sources. They just make them up when there are none. I saw one story
[2:08:57.140 --> 2:09:02.660]  recently where they said nine people have confirmed. There are no nine people. I don't believe there was
[2:09:02.660 --> 2:09:08.900]  one or two people, nine people. And I said give me a break because I know the people. I know who
[2:09:08.900 --> 2:09:14.100]  they talk to. There were no nine people but they say nine people and somebody reads it. They think
[2:09:14.100 --> 2:09:19.540]  oh nine people, they have nine sources. They make up sources. They're very dishonest people. In fact,
[2:09:19.540 --> 2:09:27.300]  in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news
[2:09:27.300 --> 2:09:35.140]  the enemy of the people, the fake news. They dropped off the word fake and all of a sudden
[2:09:35.140 --> 2:09:43.860]  the story became the media is the enemy. They take the word fake out and now I'm saying oh
[2:09:43.860 --> 2:09:50.500]  no this is no good but that's the way they are. That's right. So I'm not against the media.
[2:09:50.500 --> 2:09:58.420]  I'm not against the press. I don't mind bad stories if I deserve them and I tell, I love good stories
[2:09:58.420 --> 2:10:08.020]  but we won't. I don't get too many of them. You're good buddy. But I am only against the fake news,
[2:10:08.020 --> 2:10:15.060]  media or press. Fake, fake. They have to leave that word. I'm against the people who are screwing
[2:10:15.060 --> 2:10:18.660]  this country over, who are bought and paid for by the special entrants. I think they own you.
[2:10:19.300 --> 2:10:23.300]  And look, the years of selling America if Trump is successful and I believe he will be,
[2:10:24.260 --> 2:10:28.020]  the years of the globalists selling us out and then telling themselves how smart they are,
[2:10:28.020 --> 2:10:34.020]  feeding off the great engine of American ingenuity are over. And that's why it's so sad to see the
[2:10:34.020 --> 2:10:38.260]  weak minded that still hate Trump. But if you actually study what he's doing it's all very fair,
[2:10:38.260 --> 2:10:45.940]  it's very historical, it's very measured. He's so good that actually it makes me deep down suspect
[2:10:45.940 --> 2:10:50.740]  myself because my discernment says he's solid gold. I was saying that two years ago. I said my
[2:10:50.740 --> 2:10:56.820]  gut tells me he's great but I just said I can't believe it. And now it's just like what?
[2:10:59.380 --> 2:11:03.220]  It's not because he calls me sometimes on the telephone. You know I put out articles,
[2:11:03.220 --> 2:11:08.180]  I put out stories, I say he doesn't get a lot of his ideas from me. We're just on the same page,
[2:11:08.180 --> 2:11:12.660]  you know, Bannon I know has listened over the years and Breitbart's written about that. But
[2:11:12.660 --> 2:11:16.420]  we're promoting the same Americana. I listened to his ideas, he listens to mine. I mean yeah,
[2:11:16.420 --> 2:11:21.140]  we're all prominent leaders, Drudge's ideas get listened to. We're all prominent leaders in
[2:11:21.140 --> 2:11:26.260]  promoting Americana and freedom but it's not like we all look at a 57 Chevy that's midnight blue and
[2:11:26.260 --> 2:11:32.900]  white. I saw one today, unbelievable, driving into work. And it made me think it's like 20 people
[2:11:32.900 --> 2:11:37.540]  could look at that and say that's a beautiful piece of art right there. So Trump says look at
[2:11:37.540 --> 2:11:44.020]  that 57 Chevy, isn't it beautiful? They did cool looking. And I say absolutely, it's not like
[2:11:44.580 --> 2:11:48.100]  he's telling me what to think or I'm telling him what to think. We're like wouldn't it be nice if
[2:11:48.100 --> 2:11:52.420]  we had clean burning coal which we have and thousands of plants around the country and almost
[2:11:52.420 --> 2:11:56.020]  a thousand they shut down and that's why most people won't come here they tell Trump because
[2:11:56.020 --> 2:12:01.140]  our electricity is too expensive now. Oh wow, it's twice as you know twice as cheap in Mexico
[2:12:01.140 --> 2:12:07.220]  on average. It's three times cheaper in China. You know we might want to actually have a coal
[2:12:07.220 --> 2:12:15.940]  plant here plus ours are cleaner than theirs. I agree with Trump on that. He agrees with me
[2:12:15.940 --> 2:12:20.180]  because they've got articles. He's following Alex on coal, he's following Alex on guns,
[2:12:20.180 --> 2:12:25.220]  he's following Alex on borders, he's following Alex on the terms he uses in enemy media.
[2:12:26.260 --> 2:12:30.420]  And quite frankly I have, I thought back, one of my conversations with Trump I said they are your
[2:12:30.420 --> 2:12:35.380]  enemy and they will never stop until you're destroyed and they will never, never back off and
[2:12:35.380 --> 2:12:40.660]  they will never make deals and Hillary's going to double back on her deal and she is not going to
[2:12:40.660 --> 2:12:45.540]  ever stop trying to set you up. They've got fifth columns inside, they're going to block your agenda
[2:12:45.540 --> 2:12:50.340]  100% so he says very interesting Alex hold on one moment, comes back and goes yeah yeah we think
[2:12:50.340 --> 2:12:53.860]  that's real interesting, tell me more about that. Sure I'll tell the media what we talked about,
[2:12:53.860 --> 2:12:58.820]  we talked about hell, you are the enemy. So if I take credit for one thing it's introducing the
[2:12:58.820 --> 2:13:04.100]  term enemy media because you are the enemy and we had a show two years ago several, in fact we
[2:13:04.100 --> 2:13:09.620]  found the clip I tweeted it out last week where the listeners we all had two hours of phone calls
[2:13:09.620 --> 2:13:14.420]  on what is the name of the media, the scum media, the whore media, the sellout media,
[2:13:14.420 --> 2:13:18.180]  the fake stream media, the sewer stream media, the dinosaur media one of my terms,
[2:13:19.140 --> 2:13:23.300]  prostitutes, Gerald Salante term and I said you know what they're the enemy.
[2:13:23.300 --> 2:13:26.980]  We got to find all those clips and put them together with Trump. Yes, yes but it isn't
[2:13:26.980 --> 2:13:30.820]  because Trump was under my mind control and it's an easily influenced person,
[2:13:31.460 --> 2:13:35.220]  he didn't even comment when I kept saying they're the enemy, there the enemy goes
[2:13:37.540 --> 2:13:40.260]  yes very interesting, yes.
[2:13:43.300 --> 2:13:48.100]  And it's not, it's that he's so good that he's so dialed in and that now it's being set by the
[2:13:48.100 --> 2:13:54.420]  president of the United States annihilating scum that's on CNN saying full grown men should
[2:13:54.420 --> 2:13:58.980]  be with little girls in showers, I'm going to play that clip in a minute, I mean of course it's the
[2:13:58.980 --> 2:14:08.180]  damn enemy, I mean it's the screwball control freak crazy people enemy that wants to just run every
[2:14:08.180 --> 2:14:10.740]  people always read about authoritarian regimes and how crazy they are.
[2:14:11.780 --> 2:14:16.020]  Chilchescu in Romania wouldn't give most of the country electricity but a few days a week and
[2:14:16.020 --> 2:14:20.100]  would have them the public beg him for it but they would see his big city on a hill,
[2:14:20.100 --> 2:14:25.540]  the government district lit up for miles with just bright lights and big strobe lights and
[2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:30.740]  yeah I have light and you don't, oh I have air conditioning in a car, you don't, same Obama
[2:14:30.740 --> 2:14:36.580]  crap, imagine being the type of scumbag with a spirit of hatred for humanity where you want to
[2:14:36.580 --> 2:14:40.580]  go tell Africans they can't have electricity, medicine or cars, basically is what he said.
[2:14:44.020 --> 2:14:48.900]  People are, that's horrible, absolutely, they get off on you not having something,
[2:14:48.900 --> 2:14:53.140]  there are people that are totally jealous, total control freaks, absolutely hateful of everything
[2:14:53.140 --> 2:14:57.940]  you've got, really good-looking people have experienced this and a lot of times they become
[2:14:57.940 --> 2:15:00.820]  wicked and mean because everybody else is mean to them but when you have a good-looking person
[2:15:00.820 --> 2:15:03.860]  that isn't you know wicked and hateful, you know they're the easiest of the nicest people you know
[2:15:03.860 --> 2:15:06.980]  because they've gone through a lot of people being mean to them, it's the same thing if you're good
[2:15:06.980 --> 2:15:11.220]  at sports or you're good at art or whatever, you think people are going to embrace you and love you
[2:15:11.220 --> 2:15:16.980]  but haters going to hate and that's the same deal but Donald Trump he's so confident,
[2:15:16.980 --> 2:15:24.020]  he's so proud, he feels so good, he's so honorable, he'll run over big powerful kingpins and people
[2:15:24.020 --> 2:15:27.940]  but he's not going to run over little people because he wants to give you a shot because
[2:15:27.940 --> 2:15:32.100]  Donald Trump doesn't need you to be down the dirt for him to feel good about himself.
[2:15:34.340 --> 2:15:39.540]  He's got the best-looking wife and super smart and a great smart good-looking family and a successful
[2:15:39.540 --> 2:15:43.460]  and as honorable and has beat the establishment his whole life because they tried to keep his
[2:15:43.460 --> 2:15:47.940]  dad from building buildings in New York and his dad behind the scenes and a lot of stuff
[2:15:47.940 --> 2:15:51.860]  I've been looking into it all where Trump really came from kicking people's asses to get where they're
[2:15:51.860 --> 2:15:57.860]  at behind the scenes. You think you're just going to New York City in the 20s and 30s and 40s and
[2:15:57.860 --> 2:16:01.780]  you know do a lot of stuff like that when you got a German last name you're not Italian,
[2:16:01.780 --> 2:16:08.100]  you're not Irish, you're not English. The truth is the whole Trump family are a bunch of bad asses
[2:16:08.100 --> 2:16:13.460]  and they know what they're doing and they have been through what you've been through and they want to
[2:16:13.460 --> 2:16:19.620]  run the New World Order in the ground and all you got to do is start backing them and my family
[2:16:19.620 --> 2:16:24.580]  history is very very similar. Good people that aren't looking to dominate people but when thugs
[2:16:24.580 --> 2:16:30.500]  and scum and gangs want to start something it's like a sheepdog trained born bread to take you on
[2:16:30.500 --> 2:16:34.820]  and rip your political throats out and now you're starting to feel it. Now you're running up against
[2:16:34.820 --> 2:16:39.300]  people that aren't scared of what you do, aren't scared of what happens to us just as long as you
[2:16:39.300 --> 2:16:43.860]  get your head rammed in the concrete politically and learn that you're not going to pick on little
[2:16:43.860 --> 2:16:48.980]  people anymore while you claim you take care of them all day. I love the Democrats, fought the
[2:16:48.980 --> 2:16:54.260]  Civil Rights Act, fought the end of slavery, fought everything and they got Republicans blamed for
[2:16:54.260 --> 2:16:58.660]  doing it all but you know what the Republican Party's made of the same type of inbred elitist crap
[2:16:58.660 --> 2:17:03.540]  they're racist too. That's why they're all in this together and Donald Trump's not ladies and gentlemen
[2:17:03.540 --> 2:17:09.140]  so if you don't see that and if you don't know that you're an idiot but Trump did see him skip
[2:17:09.140 --> 2:17:14.980]  the break. Trump did see that killed our nationalism and taught us to say we even had borders was bad
[2:17:14.980 --> 2:17:20.900]  or racist he had to invoke the right of saying we're allowed to have a country we're allowed to be
[2:17:20.900 --> 2:17:30.180]  together and we're allowed to have a culture and a system and a birthright and that's all this is
[2:17:30.180 --> 2:17:36.340]  now since I've been mentioning this let me get to this clip first get to Cuomo who wants your
[2:17:36.340 --> 2:17:40.580]  daughters to have men in the showers with them oh yeah you're a racist now you're a bigot if you
[2:17:40.580 --> 2:17:48.820]  don't because little little know-it-all pretty boy says so what a piece of trash in my view
[2:17:49.780 --> 2:17:54.260]  Glenn Beck Bannon's economic nationalism agenda is not conservative it's dangerous this is like
[2:17:54.260 --> 2:17:59.460]  saying if you're against child molestation you're dangerous if you're against the plague you're
[2:17:59.460 --> 2:18:03.860]  dangerous if you're against getting the flu you're dangerous if you believe you should run your
[2:18:03.860 --> 2:18:07.540]  country and that your nation ought to be set up for the taxpayers to build a good culture for your
[2:18:07.540 --> 2:18:11.140]  country that your country wants to help people sometimes that's fine but congress votes on it
[2:18:11.140 --> 2:18:15.220]  no no no if you don't want foreign multinationals like TPP and the globalists and the communist
[2:18:15.220 --> 2:18:19.140]  Chinese buying up Hollywood running your life telling you who could be president telling you
[2:18:19.140 --> 2:18:25.620]  what you can do you're a bad person and then Glenn Beck sits throwing his churl he comes on
[2:18:25.620 --> 2:18:32.980]  to the grill cogiter very you know oh yes I'm very concerned about the nationalism is very
[2:18:32.980 --> 2:18:38.020]  dangerous of Bannon and Trump but he's like saying you having any effect over your lives
[2:18:38.020 --> 2:18:42.500]  you running your own country you being involved a guy that just wants you to have the same power
[2:18:42.500 --> 2:18:47.620]  price as China has the guy that doesn't want to screw you over the guy that wants you to have jobs
[2:18:49.460 --> 2:18:54.020]  that believes the country's actually constituted to be a country they've got us so far down globalism
[2:18:54.020 --> 2:18:58.340]  that here comes Glenn Beck the little Judas go who was always the designate to be the fake
[2:18:58.340 --> 2:19:03.940]  conservative to just credit things and to backstab manipulate because I was told I was offered his
[2:19:03.940 --> 2:19:11.940]  job before he existed 16 17 years ago I was approached and they said you're gonna be the
[2:19:11.940 --> 2:19:17.060]  next rush limbo you come right out of the thing we've tested it you're the best three million
[2:19:17.060 --> 2:19:22.500]  dollars then it was ten million dollars I said no back boom you're later everywhere
[2:19:22.500 --> 2:19:30.340]  where Glenn back they went and found some shock jock pro-abortion anti god he'd call it other hosts
[2:19:30.340 --> 2:19:34.900]  who's that a wife out of miscarriage said I'm so glad you had it I mean you talk a guy that hated
[2:19:34.900 --> 2:19:42.740]  Christians would just shake with hate on air for him and then he becomes a little milk toast
[2:19:42.740 --> 2:19:47.620]  creepy guy that knows everything I mean he's already defeated he's already destroyed he's
[2:19:47.620 --> 2:19:52.820]  already a joke but people should just put that marcation line here that this is where a trader
[2:19:52.820 --> 2:19:59.700]  politically is buried marked that spot the plague lies there the enemy there's nothing worse
[2:20:00.500 --> 2:20:04.260]  at least Melissa Harris Perry tells us who she is at least Hillary tells us part of who she is
[2:20:05.460 --> 2:20:09.780]  not these people at least the pope says it disgusts me to hear about Europe being Christian
[2:20:09.780 --> 2:20:14.820]  and its roots open the gates to Islam at least he I'll give I'll give this pope one
[2:20:14.820 --> 2:20:20.180]  he will tell you how evil he is he's less evil than than people like Glenn back
[2:20:21.860 --> 2:20:23.940]  it's hard to say this is come true I just realized that
[2:20:24.980 --> 2:20:27.780]  fruit loot must actually believe in what he's doing not with Beck it's all just a
[2:20:27.780 --> 2:20:33.540]  sneaky little octopus let me slither other and suck your culture out so imagine reading this
[2:20:33.540 --> 2:20:38.100]  with a straight face we have the video it's very dangerous to believe your nation should be first
[2:20:38.100 --> 2:20:42.340]  or to have economic nationalism and actually have the engine of America be successful that
[2:20:42.340 --> 2:20:46.980]  lift the whole world they want wages down globally not ours up forcing all the others up that's
[2:20:46.980 --> 2:20:52.100]  how that member got made in ten billion dollars on his own Ross Perot explained all that let me
[2:20:52.100 --> 2:20:56.260]  explain something you won't you you open this up it doesn't help those countries their wages lower
[2:20:56.260 --> 2:21:01.380]  and subtle ours second sound it ends industrial buildup you cannot do this in third world because
[2:21:01.380 --> 2:21:06.100]  there's no base there they'll just build factories at ports ship it off lower our industrial base
[2:21:06.100 --> 2:21:10.900]  and cultural base and and they won't have any bases well pure exploitation by mega corporations
[2:21:10.900 --> 2:21:15.300]  Lord knows what they'll do with all the money well a big project to take over the planet a
[2:21:15.300 --> 2:21:22.180]  breakaway civilization it's like the Pentagon in the 80s would get caught with $700 toilet seats and
[2:21:22.180 --> 2:21:26.420]  thousand dollar hammers it was going to black budget programs well globalism is that I mean
[2:21:27.780 --> 2:21:32.100]  something like 80 percent of the wealth is siphoned off to one percent and most of the one
[2:21:32.100 --> 2:21:38.820]  percent doesn't get it it's what was it 11 or 12 zeros and then a four two so almost all the wealth
[2:21:38.820 --> 2:21:45.220]  goes to a fraction of one percent and then no one even knows what they're building because most of
[2:21:45.220 --> 2:21:50.500]  the yachts and houses in real estate doesn't even add up to one tenth of it I'll tell you what they're
[2:21:50.500 --> 2:21:56.260]  building underground bases and some freaked out stuff in a giant race to get immortality wouldn't
[2:21:56.260 --> 2:22:00.580]  you if you were some inbred globals that didn't care about anybody and has no morals and sees
[2:22:00.580 --> 2:22:05.220]  everybody as slaves and own slave factories in china like apple apple's building some spaceship
[2:22:05.220 --> 2:22:09.460]  you know thing you know new campus and that's just a metaphor for what they're already building
[2:22:09.460 --> 2:22:16.580]  for themselves sucking on humanity's blood our ingenuity our work all the third worlds all this
[2:22:17.220 --> 2:22:22.420]  hidden thing they're constructing and then I told you that 18 years ago reading their own white
[2:22:22.420 --> 2:22:28.980]  papers now they're public admitting the entire plan oh we're building a breakaway society we're
[2:22:28.980 --> 2:22:32.740]  going to be gods you won't even exist soon you'll be like a roach we step on yeah we're siphoned
[2:22:32.740 --> 2:22:36.820]  the money off from that secret stuff yeah we got clones underground like john says he's still crazy
[2:22:36.820 --> 2:22:41.780]  though yeah we're merging humans with animals been doing it for 30 years big deal shut up and watch nfl
[2:22:46.260 --> 2:22:50.660]  and then alpha males that are left and I guess the chemicals didn't get to partly the radiation
[2:22:50.660 --> 2:22:53.780]  we're just freaking out up down the speakers don't let them do this oh that's where even
[2:22:53.780 --> 2:22:59.620]  perfect we just want to kill everybody we love our ancestors and you we're not out to get you
[2:22:59.620 --> 2:23:04.340]  it we're just here like trump and myself and others are just like and drudge is the same way
[2:23:05.060 --> 2:23:09.700]  don't don't humanity don't give up don't roll over don't die go look at the stars at night
[2:23:09.700 --> 2:23:13.620]  kiss your wife your girlfriend you know go plant a garden spend time with your kids unplug from the
[2:23:13.620 --> 2:23:19.460]  tv don't have the smartphones or keep them away when you don't have to have them they're they're
[2:23:19.460 --> 2:23:23.300]  powerful tools but they're evil they're they're they're things the globalists gave us for reasons
[2:23:23.300 --> 2:23:29.220]  of obvious control and so what's their answer just make jokes about it we're we're imagine how
[2:23:29.220 --> 2:23:33.620]  dumb they think CNN's audiences are limbeck saying it's very dangerous to have a nation
[2:23:33.620 --> 2:23:37.860]  or to actually want to do things for your own country and to have national interest that the
[2:23:37.860 --> 2:23:42.340]  reason is to do something outside the national interest if you work for the government I don't
[2:23:42.340 --> 2:23:45.700]  mind you switching sides and fighting for things you believe in if you want to go to shine a bet but
[2:23:45.700 --> 2:23:51.620]  you don't but he sits there like he's always on a toilet he's his little face like he's constipated
[2:23:51.620 --> 2:23:56.900]  to look it's like the character of like he's the great thinker he's really giving you something
[2:23:56.900 --> 2:24:03.540]  genuine because it's so ungenuine direct globalist Davos Bilderberg crap they used to say was secret
[2:24:03.540 --> 2:24:08.260]  30 years ago or even 10 years ago directly shoveled in your face by a rat
[2:24:11.460 --> 2:24:14.900]  I mean this is insane Limbaugh's not perfect I'm trying to hold him up because they're trying to
[2:24:14.900 --> 2:24:18.340]  break him down he's at least for America send him another host I'm not attacking Beck because
[2:24:18.340 --> 2:24:24.660]  I'm a competition with him I was supposed to be him do you understand that's why he wanted to destroy
[2:24:24.660 --> 2:24:30.820]  me because you can't have a body snatcher a doppelganger always in mythology wants to get
[2:24:30.820 --> 2:24:36.740]  rid of the real thing well guess what god wins again boy you didn't get rid of the real me
[2:24:36.740 --> 2:24:43.140]  praise Jesus for that so let's hear this is what they came up with let's hear the creature
[2:24:43.780 --> 2:24:49.780]  that they dug up out of atheist god-hating abortion radio and let's hear what he has to say
[2:24:49.780 --> 2:24:56.660]  did you learn anything about it I'm sorry back it up with a guy from the CIA admittedly interviewing
[2:24:56.660 --> 2:25:01.140]  him and then they write articles saying I'm crazy Anderson Cooper's not with a CIA when it's been
[2:25:01.140 --> 2:25:05.380]  known that this guy's worth hundreds of billions of dollars one of the richest people in the world
[2:25:05.380 --> 2:25:09.940]  his family goes back 500 years into Europe he's involved in everything evil you can imagine
[2:25:09.940 --> 2:25:15.700]  and he's above CIA and then they have to admit later he is CIA but but but let's just hear from one
[2:25:15.700 --> 2:25:21.700]  of the vampires interviewing his little little minion this little this little this little
[2:25:23.460 --> 2:25:29.620]  gremlin that's not even a goblin he's he's a gremlin here we go did you learn anything about
[2:25:29.620 --> 2:25:34.660]  him that that surprised you or did it confirm what you've already believed about it no it
[2:25:34.660 --> 2:25:40.820]  confirmed what I already believed what is frightening to me is the lack of reaction
[2:25:40.820 --> 2:25:46.020]  from the crowd at CPAC yeah back it up back and I'm sorry I'm sorry oh my god the lack of reaction
[2:25:47.220 --> 2:25:51.940]  talked about nationalism and having an economy and doing trade deals that are good for Americans
[2:25:52.580 --> 2:25:58.180]  I mean next she'll say like make your kids eggs in the morning and make them orange shoes and then
[2:25:58.180 --> 2:26:03.380]  walk them across the streets of the school bus I mean next trample saving families exist I mean
[2:26:03.380 --> 2:26:07.940]  you heard Cuomo earlier if we don't let grown men in the showers with our daughters we're hateful
[2:26:07.940 --> 2:26:09.940]  oh
[2:26:16.020 --> 2:26:19.380]  I'm sorry back at the beginning I'll be just gonna see that cosplay look again here I'm
[2:26:19.380 --> 2:26:24.340]  supposed to here we go learn anything about him that that surprised you or did it confirm
[2:26:24.340 --> 2:26:29.460]  what you've already believed about it no it confirmed what I already believed what is
[2:26:29.460 --> 2:26:36.020]  frightening to me is the lack of reaction from the crowd yeah he's like where's the spot where
[2:26:36.020 --> 2:26:39.460]  she's constipated on the screenshot like like back at the beginning of the video because it's so
[2:26:39.460 --> 2:26:45.380]  funny how actually all constipated but there's a CIA idiot that praying on everybody literally
[2:26:45.380 --> 2:26:50.820]  but I mean let's go back to this what's praying to me it's all calculated everything's been written
[2:26:50.820 --> 2:26:56.900]  before and he he scripts with actors and hops around big candy ass if I'm not back and sits there
[2:26:56.900 --> 2:27:01.220]  because they hate humanity so much he can't even go out again have a woman or procreate it's just this
[2:27:01.220 --> 2:27:05.220]  whole thing bring down humanity and at every level I'm not saying you're bad if you're gay I'm just
[2:27:05.220 --> 2:27:08.340]  saying with them it's all like that because it's like don't have children because it's like a
[2:27:08.340 --> 2:27:16.740]  act of war against humanity and he's sitting there and he's he's talking about how I'm so scared
[2:27:16.740 --> 2:27:21.700]  I'm so scared he's like so everybody's supposed to be scared now here's the Judas goat that's the
[2:27:21.700 --> 2:27:28.740]  good conservative who thinks you're so dumb here it is learn anything about him that that surprised
[2:27:28.740 --> 2:27:33.700]  you or did it confirm what you've already believed about it no it confirmed what I already believed
[2:27:33.700 --> 2:27:41.940]  confirmed writing to me is the the lack of reaction from the crowd at CPAC he he dropped
[2:27:41.940 --> 2:27:49.780]  economic nationalism two or three times he talked about it again not at the start brother
[2:27:49.780 --> 2:27:55.380]  they always act like we caught Jones saying rape J Lo no I said she better not go to Somalia
[2:27:55.380 --> 2:27:59.700]  where she'll get raped why she won a bunch of unvetted Somalis here very clear what I said
[2:27:59.700 --> 2:28:04.980]  she doesn't want to get raped so she shouldn't be for this same deal they'll they'll say you all
[2:28:04.980 --> 2:28:08.740]  these things so again this is all part of their deception it's all part of their manipulation
[2:28:08.740 --> 2:28:12.180]  it's all part of how they take these out of context and also act like they caught Trump
[2:28:12.180 --> 2:28:20.260]  in something big he said it three times like oh we caught him in a big televised speech
[2:28:20.260 --> 2:28:26.660]  doing something secret we have the moral high ground here it is nationalism a lot I don't know
[2:28:26.660 --> 2:28:34.580]  what Steve Bannon's plan is after he would burn down the system but he has talked repeatedly about
[2:28:34.580 --> 2:28:40.020]  burning the system the globalist system is set on top of our republic feeding off of it extracting
[2:28:40.020 --> 2:28:44.820]  the wealth out of the nation to build this global government project so of course we need to get
[2:28:44.820 --> 2:28:49.140]  rid of it all it's cancer and you've already been burned to the ground so is CNN politically
[2:28:49.140 --> 2:28:53.460]  everyone hates you but the dumbest people look how pathetic he feels he is such an arrogant
[2:28:53.460 --> 2:28:58.820]  piece of garbage let's finish the club um that's not good we no conservative would be for that we

[2:29:14.420 --> 2:29:20.180]  we want to conserve all the tyranny and teaching kids how to give blow jobs at age five and and
[2:29:20.180 --> 2:29:24.500]  you know telling kids they should have grown men in the showers with them i mean we need to conserve
[2:29:24.500 --> 2:29:29.540]  all the forced inoculations we need to conserve the life of satan the water and conserve the gmo
[2:29:29.540 --> 2:29:34.820]  and conserve the chemtrails and conserve the open borders and conserve the leprosy coming in and
[2:29:34.820 --> 2:29:38.980]  conserve funding radical islam and keeping the borders open in europe and just conserve everything

[2:29:59.780 --> 2:30:05.460]  president trump's administration on wednesday night withdrew obama's guidance on transgender
[2:30:05.460 --> 2:30:12.340]  bathroom use in public schools now radical liberals are calling for violent protests in the streets
[2:30:12.340 --> 2:30:19.220]  george decai from the original star trek tweeted out the trump administration's war on the lgbt
[2:30:19.220 --> 2:30:26.580]  community has begun be prepared to take our fight to the street are you with us lgbt allies but he
[2:30:26.580 --> 2:30:34.020]  wasn't done hours later he tweeted that an american spring is coming the radical left is demanding
[2:30:34.020 --> 2:30:40.020]  tolerance and threatening violence if they don't get special privileges in the name of tolerance
[2:30:40.020 --> 2:30:47.380]  yet they themselves practice extreme intolerance toward conservatives so the question is should
[2:30:47.380 --> 2:30:53.860]  we be tolerant toward their intolerance because after all tolerance is a two-way street this

[2:35:39.940 --> 2:35:43.460]  out in this whole culture it's all part of this cultural dominance to get rid of the image of
[2:35:43.460 --> 2:35:46.500]  women get rid of the image of men we're not against any other groups out there it's the
[2:35:46.500 --> 2:35:52.420]  studio war against just americana like donald trump tell us about your music uh where it is
[2:35:52.420 --> 2:35:58.180]  right now and what the whole story the back story of how you did this uh there uh at the
[2:35:58.180 --> 2:36:02.820]  grammy's and how big it's become absolutely well i want to say something you said about the image i
[2:36:02.820 --> 2:36:08.740]  mean as a strong feminine female you know i really believe that you can be strong and you can be
[2:36:08.740 --> 2:36:14.740]  feminine at the same time that's not that one cancels out the ego yeah i mean you can be sexy
[2:36:14.740 --> 2:36:20.100]  you can look great they don't want women to use the strength of being sexy exactly there's nothing
[2:36:20.100 --> 2:36:27.700]  wrong with that and there's nothing wrong with it the power so yeah about that and then my music
[2:36:27.700 --> 2:36:32.580]  is just exploded and i'm really really grateful for that um yeah i became the number one rock and
[2:36:32.580 --> 2:36:38.180]  alternative album this week i'll sold some of my favorite bands red hot chili peppers of italica
[2:36:38.900 --> 2:36:44.420]  number 12 you know i beat out i have a stepdaughter who's 13 she's she's kind of pissed that i beat out
[2:36:44.420 --> 2:36:53.220]  justin bieber and uh it's just been amazing you know my music has always been about love freedom
[2:36:53.220 --> 2:36:59.540]  for standing up for what you believe in um about being a spiritual being that can conquer all and
[2:36:59.540 --> 2:37:04.340]  accomplish great things and that's always been my message since i became an artist so my album i make
[2:37:04.340 --> 2:37:11.220]  the static being there has just it's really shown me that um you know what you do as a creator
[2:37:11.220 --> 2:37:16.100]  will speak to other people you just keep creating keep creating standing for what you believe in
[2:37:16.100 --> 2:37:20.820]  and the fans will see that and appreciate it i think everybody wants to appreciate someone
[2:37:20.820 --> 2:37:25.780]  that they can look up to i know when i was a kid i looked up to role models i bought music from people
[2:37:25.780 --> 2:37:33.220]  that i admired not just sonically and and you know artistically but also as a person well i
[2:37:33.220 --> 2:37:36.020]  always talk about if you look at old black and white photos i don't care the people are white
[2:37:36.020 --> 2:37:41.860]  black what they are people have electricity in their eyes yeah yeah nowadays if somebody's trying
[2:37:41.860 --> 2:37:47.060]  to look like that in hollywood it's more of an arrogance comes out instead you have that old
[2:37:47.060 --> 2:37:53.300]  fashioned fire in your eyes but it's not arrogant it's more loving and like you're happy and excited
[2:37:53.300 --> 2:37:56.900]  and want to interface with humanity and i talk a lot about you what's in the eyes it's like tony
[2:37:56.900 --> 2:38:01.220]  montana says in that famous movie it's a fictional you know account of real things that happen he says
[2:38:01.220 --> 2:38:06.020]  you know the eyes chico they never lie and it's in the eyes and so i think people resonate you
[2:38:06.020 --> 2:38:10.340]  were already popular you you're already successful but now you've exploded number one in rock number
[2:38:10.340 --> 2:38:14.500]  12 and billboard number one and a bunch of other countries around the world obviously on your way
[2:38:14.500 --> 2:38:18.980]  to be number one probably period all because of that moment challenging the status quo i mean
[2:38:18.980 --> 2:38:23.060]  i know you got some threats and you got attacked let's talk about the process who made the dress
[2:38:23.060 --> 2:38:26.900]  how you decided to do it and then the good the bad the ugly that's happened since
[2:38:26.900 --> 2:38:33.060]  okay you know um i've been to the grammy's i'm a member of the recording academy so i was at the
[2:38:33.060 --> 2:38:39.220]  grammy's um two years ago and i worked with the same artist andre soriano he always makes my dresses
[2:38:39.220 --> 2:38:45.380]  i'm his muse he's my partner in crime and he is a legal filipino immigrant he voted for trump
[2:38:45.380 --> 2:38:49.860]  and he happens to be gay as well so he's definitely not what people would think is a trump supporter
[2:38:49.860 --> 2:38:53.460]  you know what they think quote unquote actually i mean trump's always been he was doing articles
[2:38:53.460 --> 2:38:58.420]  the advocate 25 years ago for people's freedom exactly exactly he's always stood by his beliefs
[2:38:58.420 --> 2:39:04.820]  and so andre called me it was after the women's march and andre said you know what this is not
[2:39:04.820 --> 2:39:09.060]  right this narrative of hate and i said you're right you know someone's saying they want to bomb the
[2:39:09.060 --> 2:39:14.260]  white house saying that you know trump is a nazi and that we need to make a change we need to get
[2:39:14.260 --> 2:39:18.740]  him out we need to impeach him and it's just hate messages it's straight up hate violence
[2:39:18.740 --> 2:39:24.180]  inciting violence and people are listening to celebrities people are listening to those women
[2:39:24.180 --> 2:39:28.580]  and men who have that platform and if you're gonna say i'm gonna hate the president that is not a
[2:39:28.580 --> 2:39:33.860]  message you want to share to millions of people it's fine to say i don't agree but to say let's get
[2:39:33.860 --> 2:39:39.220]  him out with violence so andre was crying and he called he told me about it and i was overseas
[2:39:39.220 --> 2:39:43.780]  actually i was in denmark and i said oh my gosh i didn't know this was going on this was so bad
[2:39:43.780 --> 2:39:48.020]  and so i looked it up of course and i said okay this is this has got to change so he said let's
[2:39:48.020 --> 2:39:52.660]  this is my idea it was andre's idea and i said of course i voted for president trump
[2:39:53.220 --> 2:39:58.660]  secretly you know i mean i publicly voted but i have never been able to tweet that or
[2:39:58.660 --> 2:40:02.900]  rejoice sure because they will absolutely ban you it's admitted in hollywood and also in music
[2:40:02.900 --> 2:40:08.980]  it's it's a cult it's it really has gotten you know sickening it's like totally bullying it's
[2:40:08.980 --> 2:40:13.940]  absolute bullying and that's why my platform is like stop the bullying stop the hate let's change
[2:40:13.940 --> 2:40:18.260]  the narrative to love and peace because we can all agree on that no no matter where you fall in the
[2:40:18.260 --> 2:40:23.300]  political spectrum you have to believe that bullying somebody for supporting the president of the
[2:40:23.300 --> 2:40:27.700]  united states when you're in that country even if you're not in that country is wrong i would never
[2:40:27.700 --> 2:40:32.340]  bully someone who supports their president from another country you know but somehow yeah we have
[2:40:32.340 --> 2:40:37.940]  riots we have people who are inciting violence and this just sends the message that we're divided
[2:40:37.940 --> 2:40:41.940]  we're divided well exactly when i was like five years old watching pbs with my mom she would get a
[2:40:41.940 --> 2:40:46.820]  tv in the kitchen she'd cook dinner she'd watch tv and i saw footage from decades before of black
[2:40:46.820 --> 2:40:52.340]  people trying to vote or march being beaten up in alabama i felt guilt and bad just for humanity
[2:40:52.340 --> 2:40:55.700]  and hated it well i want to see footage of people being beaten up just because they're
[2:40:55.700 --> 2:41:00.020]  trump supporters or women being raped you know in europe by radical islamists i feel the same
[2:41:00.020 --> 2:41:04.340]  way let's do something i don't care what color you are we're all human beings and it just seems
[2:41:04.340 --> 2:41:07.460]  like the left is kind of gone crazy because i was never left-wing or right-wing i didn't
[2:41:07.460 --> 2:41:12.260]  really like george bush and now the left seems like it's gone really nuts it's really it's
[2:41:12.260 --> 2:41:18.500]  become so extreme you know extremism in anything is wrong because extremism means i'm right and i
[2:41:18.500 --> 2:41:23.300]  refuse to look at the other side i refuse to do the research i refuse to have a conversation
[2:41:23.300 --> 2:41:28.180]  and then now you're getting into this zone where you're blocking your friends who believe like
[2:41:28.180 --> 2:41:33.620]  you know the opposite of you do you're only watching tweets and tv shows and youtube videos
[2:41:33.620 --> 2:41:39.460]  that support your belief now you don't have the full 360 view you only have that one view
[2:41:39.460 --> 2:41:44.580]  and i feel like as a millennial myself i'm 25 years old and people my age it's so easy to only
[2:41:44.580 --> 2:41:49.060]  follow people we agree with and not see the other end so that's why it's so important not just to
[2:41:49.060 --> 2:41:53.540]  listen to the news not just to tweet out the things your friends are saying but to really really do
[2:41:53.540 --> 2:41:58.740]  the research and ask around and actually find out for yourself well that's right we only got about
[2:41:58.740 --> 2:42:01.940]  five six minutes well i appreciate your time up and come back you know more when you have more
[2:42:01.940 --> 2:42:06.820]  music coming out or new things that are developing but you're somebody that took the plunge got i mean
[2:42:06.820 --> 2:42:11.140]  i guess you've already said this but i mean your own words i'm wrong you took the plunge i mean
[2:42:11.140 --> 2:42:14.980]  what were you thinking before you did it and then boom it made you 20 times bigger i mean this is
[2:42:14.980 --> 2:42:20.420]  just for me an example of my own life getting fired from jobs having sponsors taken we just
[2:42:20.420 --> 2:42:25.220]  had a bunch of stuff happen this week but every time we don't submit to the intimidation it resonates
[2:42:25.220 --> 2:42:29.940]  with other people of every color every religion of every creed and we just come together and it
[2:42:29.940 --> 2:42:33.540]  seems like i can feel the spirit president trump i know feels that i've talked about it with him
[2:42:33.540 --> 2:42:39.380]  personally rising uh and it's it's really a liberal spirit and by liberal i mean classical
[2:42:39.380 --> 2:42:45.940]  human empowerment yes oh i love that alex human empowerment that's what this is it's human
[2:42:45.940 --> 2:42:52.020]  empowerment because free speech speaking up for what you believe in is is a human right you know
[2:42:52.020 --> 2:42:55.700]  it's actually human rights issue here when you're bullying somebody you're telling them to shut up
[2:42:55.700 --> 2:43:00.260]  because i don't agree with you so the other end is coming up you know and i mentioned a little bit
[2:43:00.260 --> 2:43:05.300]  about the hate i received i received a huge backlash like people attack me of you know different
[2:43:05.300 --> 2:43:09.940]  colors of my they attack my religion they attacked how i believe they attacked everything they've
[2:43:09.940 --> 2:43:15.140]  gone in deep on my tweets they attack my husband and my step kids and it's really gotten ugly
[2:43:15.140 --> 2:43:20.100]  but that's a small voice compared to the people like you said who are rising up and there really is
[2:43:20.100 --> 2:43:26.660]  a rise up for love support human understanding and that's that's what it is ultimately the people
[2:43:26.660 --> 2:43:31.940]  like us who are in the spotlight have to speak up for what we believe and other people see that
[2:43:31.940 --> 2:43:35.700]  they get encouraged and they follow suit i've got to ask you because i know trump reaches out to
[2:43:35.700 --> 2:43:40.260]  hundreds of people a day he's i've never seen energy like it uh have you been reached out to
[2:43:40.260 --> 2:43:46.980]  by trump or by the family because i'm obviously you're an icon not yet i haven't yet i hope so i
[2:43:46.980 --> 2:43:51.460]  hope to get an invitation to go perform well i get contacted by any of their folks you want to
[2:43:51.460 --> 2:43:56.660]  i mean give them your number sure absolutely you can do that i mean trump calls a lot of people
[2:43:56.660 --> 2:44:01.620]  like a cop you know you know he gets killed he calls the widow of somebody's doing a great job
[2:44:01.620 --> 2:44:04.660]  you know there's a homeless lady standing up you know when people are attacking her trump behind
[2:44:04.660 --> 2:44:08.900]  the scenes you know does amazing things i mean he really is all about individual connections to
[2:44:08.900 --> 2:44:12.020]  people and i'm just surprised they haven't talked to you yet because i'm telling you
[2:44:12.020 --> 2:44:16.100]  you're like a hydrogen bomb for this nationalist movement and again not that nations are perfect
[2:44:16.100 --> 2:44:20.820]  but we're better than global corporations running everything in secret and it's this re-emergence
[2:44:20.820 --> 2:44:25.620]  of cultures and freedom and you know the media saying it's very evil that trump thinks we should
[2:44:25.620 --> 2:44:29.700]  actually try to have jobs for america i mean that's crazy that is crazy because that's what
[2:44:29.700 --> 2:44:35.700]  america stands on is jobs is freedom is is exactly what the president is preaching he's actually
[2:44:35.700 --> 2:44:40.900]  he's acting on what he was preaching before when he campaigned and now as he's elected office so
[2:44:40.900 --> 2:44:44.660]  he's not saying anything different he hasn't said for like 30 years he does want to make america
[2:44:44.660 --> 2:44:49.860]  great again joy vila joy vila dot com on twitter then let me go back to this thing because i mean
[2:44:49.860 --> 2:44:54.100]  describe it when did you make the decision just run through it what was your heart beating i mean
[2:44:54.100 --> 2:44:58.740]  when you made the decision when you get there when you uncloak i mean i've seen a lot of people on
[2:44:58.740 --> 2:45:04.020]  hollywood and the grammy's the emmy's walk the walk show their dresses i'm not kidding this was the
[2:45:04.020 --> 2:45:08.580]  most electricity the most excited no matter how beautiful the woman was scarlet your hands it
[2:45:08.580 --> 2:45:14.020]  didn't matter this was like the best ever i mean it was just so sexy it was so cool what was it like
[2:45:14.020 --> 2:45:19.140]  describe it it was exciting i mean i was my heart was beating you know when i wore my cloak the white
[2:45:19.140 --> 2:45:23.780]  cloak that andre started on a design for me and i had my heart clutch and my heart was beating big
[2:45:23.780 --> 2:45:26.980]  time because people are like oh is there anything under that can i stand in the dress and i was like
[2:45:26.980 --> 2:45:32.020]  no you'll see i have a reveal you know i'd be a little bit cheeky with the press up there and
[2:45:32.020 --> 2:45:36.820]  then when i got on the state on the red carpet like the step and repeat that you see i took it off
[2:45:36.820 --> 2:45:41.380]  and they they cheered actually all the there's probably a hundred photographers there and they
[2:45:41.380 --> 2:45:47.380]  were cheering and i was so excited they felt the electricity and someone's saying i'm not bullied
[2:45:47.380 --> 2:45:52.500]  beautiful woman beautiful dress i'm not bullied it's it's finally the reemergence of art art is
[2:45:52.500 --> 2:45:57.860]  supposed to piss some people off that's right that's right it is supposed to it's supposed to elicit
[2:45:57.860 --> 2:46:02.500]  you know some sort of reaction and you know speaking of art i just dropped my remix album like
[2:46:02.500 --> 2:46:08.500]  i make the static and that's that's like dance feel good tunes for workout for you know just
[2:46:08.500 --> 2:46:13.540]  really good empowerment and call the static remixes so people can start buying that now and
[2:46:13.540 --> 2:46:17.540]  you know if they want to push me back to the charts or you know whatever they want to do
[2:46:17.540 --> 2:46:22.260]  but i'm i'm here for the people and i love making music like today you're like number one on rock
[2:46:22.260 --> 2:46:25.700]  and number 12 on billboard i guess you've gone higher some days on other charts let me ask you
[2:46:25.700 --> 2:46:30.980]  this then in closing i mean where do you go from here because obviously you're an example of so many
[2:46:30.980 --> 2:46:35.620]  others to get past the bullying this is what scares the system i'm the republicans are horrible so are
[2:46:35.620 --> 2:46:39.860]  the democrats i mean people understand trump at his inauguration went after both of them
[2:46:39.860 --> 2:46:44.020]  they keep trying to make it partisan i mean people need to understand i've studied the facts
[2:46:44.020 --> 2:46:48.260]  trump is really trying to empower people but just look at the example of how hundreds of
[2:46:48.260 --> 2:46:52.020]  photographers are there i would guess you're there on the mainwalk they're cheering because they get
[2:46:52.020 --> 2:46:55.860]  it something different it's something cool they know they're gonna be able to sell this photo for a
[2:46:55.860 --> 2:46:59.940]  lot they're all bullied too i mean i can tell me how many people come around from hollywood
[2:47:00.660 --> 2:47:04.260]  top producers you name it i mean people that have made you know the last couple years 200
[2:47:04.260 --> 2:47:09.220]  million dollars you know worth of productions hbo you name it and they go alex most of us are awake
[2:47:09.220 --> 2:47:13.380]  we're not conservatives we're not liberals we're we're just americana like kurt russell had the
[2:47:13.380 --> 2:47:18.260]  will to say it he's like most of us are just these americana people we want freedom we're sick of it
[2:47:18.260 --> 2:47:23.460]  but the democrats try to dominate us and it's a cult and if we speak out we get fired or we get
[2:47:23.460 --> 2:47:30.340]  shut down so the thing is that's a big hallmark a big you know tombstone for the elite a signpost
[2:47:30.340 --> 2:47:35.620]  that they're already dead people are just scared to say no so all that's left is the facade now
[2:47:36.500 --> 2:47:40.820]  yeah exactly and there's a lot of people like you said who actually believe the way we do
[2:47:40.820 --> 2:47:46.660]  in preserving american rights and preserving american culture in being a you know a cultural
[2:47:46.660 --> 2:47:52.100]  beacon for everybody because we're we're america and we can be proud to say like i remember when i
[2:47:52.100 --> 2:47:57.940]  was a kid even like 10 years ago it used to be okay to say i'm proud to be american and then i
[2:47:57.940 --> 2:48:02.980]  feel like you know as i got older it's like it's almost a shameful thing like american is a slang
[2:48:02.980 --> 2:48:09.460]  for bad oh glenn beck said came out today and said it was scary that bannon uh chief advisor to
[2:48:09.460 --> 2:48:15.220]  trump said that that we should have economic nationalism and help americans they said it's
[2:48:15.220 --> 2:48:19.780]  the worst thing ever so now they're banning american flags in california at schools and
[2:48:19.780 --> 2:48:24.820]  glenn beck says it's horrible and scary that trump wants to promote america i mean since we had
[2:48:25.700 --> 2:48:30.900]  yeah i can't believe it yeah it's it's we really have to change that narrative and just be like
[2:48:30.900 --> 2:48:36.580]  positive and keep standing up that's like you and your show alex you know info wars is such a great
[2:48:36.580 --> 2:48:41.940]  show and just being like proud to be american proud to be the other side telling the other side of
[2:48:41.940 --> 2:48:46.500]  the story because people will research even young people you know we're all researching we have the
[2:48:46.500 --> 2:48:52.340]  internet now so we can we can believe the other side rather than just believing what somebody
[2:48:52.340 --> 2:48:56.740]  tells us to believe she's the mm the magamon row we can figure out something even better we'll
[2:48:56.740 --> 2:49:04.020]  hashtag that get number one billboard rock album right now number one number 12 globally all music

[2:49:30.820 --> 2:49:35.620]  but it was a smile the eyes all of it most women now that are beautiful they try to look arrogant
[2:49:35.620 --> 2:49:40.260]  and it looks evil and they're trying to look all powerful no it's not that it's that it's that
[2:49:40.260 --> 2:49:45.940]  openness and that just goodness and that strength it's like thousand times better

[2:50:24.740 --> 2:50:33.060]  i'm not anti-gay i'm anti-gay that's what they do on the co-bearer show all of it i mean it's just
[2:50:33.060 --> 2:50:38.420]  they edit things like trump said i came out and i said the fake media is the enemy and they cut out
[2:50:38.420 --> 2:50:44.740]  fake they cut to media is the enemy and they did that and it's like it makes you sick when they sit
[2:50:44.740 --> 2:50:50.740]  there in between colmo saying your your your young daughter should have grown men in the showers with
[2:50:50.740 --> 2:50:56.020]  her i'm gonna play that clip coming up and you're just sitting there while they assault your sanity

[2:51:13.220 --> 2:51:18.740]  like i went crazy because i was an hillary supporter and jacari jackson uh one of our great
[2:51:18.740 --> 2:51:26.020]  former reporters uh like tackles me they ran that like that was serious and i said it was satire but
[2:51:26.020 --> 2:51:29.860]  it's just this but but here's my message to trump and i'm gonna cover this at the start of the next
[2:51:29.860 --> 2:51:36.100]  hour because i got some clips to get to i want to play the clips and go to it trump went and did
[2:51:36.100 --> 2:51:41.060]  wwe because he doesn't take himself too seriously he did a great job it was fun he's friends with
[2:51:41.060 --> 2:51:49.140]  vince big man it's clearly a venue to have fun it's multifaceted that our guardian of the republic are
[2:51:52.340 --> 2:51:55.060]  president our head honcho
[2:51:57.620 --> 2:52:02.020]  wants to go have fun and he goes boom boom me me me me me me me i mean i'm gonna get all the fun

[2:52:15.060 --> 2:52:19.780]  because they don't love them and i'm not on their level i'm not messing with my kids like so many
[2:52:19.780 --> 2:52:24.100]  parents do like like they got something to prove their kid and messing with them all day i'm like

[2:52:34.260 --> 2:52:40.420]  and stand up for yourself and i'll let you do basically whatever you want
[2:52:42.580 --> 2:52:46.580]  because i love you and i'm not gonna sit there and you love these other parents i see that just
[2:52:46.580 --> 2:52:52.100]  get on their kid's case and get in their faces and just work out psychological issues they already
[2:52:52.100 --> 2:52:57.860]  had previously themselves on their kids it's horrible to watch we've all seen it i'm not here
[2:52:57.860 --> 2:53:03.460]  working out my psychological issues with you i i have already attained success in my life when i
[2:53:03.460 --> 2:53:12.900]  was very very young i just had the ancestral memory i'll leave it to that and i didn't know what to
[2:53:12.900 --> 2:53:17.780]  deal with it i didn't know what to do i felt like i was 80 years old when i was like five
[2:53:22.820 --> 2:53:27.700]  and now i realize everything the globalists do is to block that because whether you're a little girl
[2:53:27.700 --> 2:53:30.740]  or a little boy whether you're black whether you're white whether you're asian whether you're whatever
[2:53:30.740 --> 2:53:39.940]  you are you have all these instincts carl yung discovered it all carl yung as a young boy was
[2:53:39.940 --> 2:53:43.780]  doing rituals that he'd never seen or never read about and then he learned they were like
[2:53:43.780 --> 2:53:47.860]  ancient germanic rituals and he was doing them exactly like they were supposed to be done it was
[2:53:47.860 --> 2:53:54.580]  all there it was all pre-programmed and it wasn't even so much the ritual itself those were like
[2:53:54.580 --> 2:53:59.940]  packaging on a weapon system or a farming system or a culture system it's everything
[2:53:59.940 --> 2:54:06.420]  that he was opening they were files that were genetically compressed in his dna that his brain
[2:54:06.420 --> 2:54:13.860]  was accessing and then he was doing rituals that ancestors had used to encode it into the dna and
[2:54:13.860 --> 2:54:17.700]  transmit forward and i've not even really read his books i just know what he was doing because
[2:54:17.700 --> 2:54:21.620]  i've only read the synopsis and i've experienced it myself i mean you could have a heyday with that
[2:54:21.620 --> 2:54:25.700]  but that's fine i don't care all the globalists know about this but they don't have access to
[2:54:25.700 --> 2:54:32.100]  knowledge that helps people they only have knowledge to very evil stuff and
[2:54:33.860 --> 2:54:36.660]  even though i see the globalists as stunted twisted people
[2:54:37.620 --> 2:54:42.820]  they're doesn't make them less dangerous and i used to even hate them and i get angry at them
[2:54:42.820 --> 2:54:47.620]  because it gives me energy and that's lower and i shouldn't do it but i i get weak and i sometimes
[2:54:47.620 --> 2:54:54.660]  lean on my animal instincts to be able to get through the day but as soon as you realize that
[2:54:54.660 --> 2:54:58.580]  it's it's a phase of humanity and these are very broken twisted people and they're sick and they're

[3:04:53.940 --> 3:05:02.180]  we're all dead i don't mean us physically but the genetic line former cia officer brian dian
[3:05:02.180 --> 3:05:07.620]  right stated in an interview with tucker carlson that rumors about intelligence operatives with
[3:05:07.620 --> 3:05:13.060]  holding information from president trump are true and that leaks are being made intentionally to
[3:05:13.060 --> 3:05:18.420]  discredit the president he also said that these rogue intelligence officers are playing a
[3:05:18.420 --> 3:05:24.180]  dangerous game and that he supports the president in finding these people and throwing them in jail
[3:05:24.180 --> 3:05:29.860]  we have to ask ourselves how safe is our country when we have shadow elements in various intelligence
[3:05:29.860 --> 3:05:34.500]  agencies with holding information from the president that could be pertinent to him being
[3:05:34.500 --> 3:05:40.020]  able to make fast decisions in regard to the safety of the nation and lastly given the history of
[3:05:40.020 --> 3:05:45.220]  nefarious conduct by various intelligence agencies should trump make an executive order
[3:05:45.220 --> 3:05:50.500]  within constitutional restrictions to drain the swamp within the intelligence agencies
[3:05:50.500 --> 3:05:55.940]  before they enact a coup against him which would undermine the american democratic process

[3:11:48.500 --> 3:11:54.420]  amazing they're trying to censor him he's not liberal conservative he plays our clips so the
[3:11:54.420 --> 3:11:59.940]  kids come up and tell me about it but but the point is is that the young people are into stuff
[3:11:59.940 --> 3:12:07.460]  as anti-establishment and so that's an example of how i was popular with kids because the globalist
[3:12:07.460 --> 3:12:13.860]  took clips of me and took the goofy clips out that were few and far between but on purpose
[3:12:13.860 --> 3:12:20.580]  and put them together they meant it to hurt me they went mega viral and putie pie and everybody
[3:12:20.580 --> 3:12:26.500]  else for years takes them and plays them and then people say who's alex jones then they wonder why
[3:12:26.500 --> 3:12:31.300]  watson had fertile soil to be more popular with young people than i did when i made him five years
[3:12:31.300 --> 3:12:37.860]  ago start getting on tv now he is almost or maybe more because you go to facebook he's getting 10
[3:12:37.860 --> 3:12:42.900]  15 20 million views a week 10 million on youtube ever number one he's like number one on t it's
[3:12:42.900 --> 3:12:48.180]  more than probably the president now he doesn't have a lot of followers as long like a 600 000 or
[3:12:48.180 --> 3:12:54.260]  something but actual impressions is as big as trump bigger than bbc i mean trump knows it too
[3:12:54.260 --> 3:12:59.940]  he's not he's happy i mean paul's huge the point is is that they did a bunch of videos attacking
[3:12:59.940 --> 3:13:06.340]  us over the last few years it turned out the kids all loved it and loved me for it they come here
[3:13:06.340 --> 3:13:12.180]  then they find watson it explodes even bigger no weapon formed against us will prosper so here's
[3:13:12.180 --> 3:13:17.780]  cobear i was looking it up his average show at night maybe has three to four million viewers
[3:13:17.780 --> 3:13:22.100]  and i think it's pretty funny overall i'm not not actually body language level i like the guy
[3:13:22.740 --> 3:13:26.900]  he's a good-looking guy nice suits has some funny stuff i don't even dislike him what's crazy
[3:13:26.900 --> 3:13:33.540]  he's trying to destroy me he's out to get me misrepresenting saying i hate gay people i said i
[3:13:33.540 --> 3:13:41.380]  don't hate gay people they're editing this in classic defamation and and i still don't even
[3:13:41.380 --> 3:13:49.220]  hate him but the guy has the amount of viewers every night that our terrestrial radio conservatively
[3:13:49.220 --> 3:13:56.340]  has four and a half million listeners a day rated confirmed pressure radio is great used to be like
[3:13:56.340 --> 3:14:01.060]  60 what we did it's now like 40 we're just exploding over here we have all this giant
[3:14:01.060 --> 3:14:06.340]  listenership every day over 10 million a day conservatively conservatively it's like 15 million
[3:14:06.340 --> 3:14:11.540]  a day the point is this guy doesn't have the views we have but he's got the big establishment thing
[3:14:11.540 --> 3:14:16.980]  where it looks like this is your daddy this is your mommy this is the system and it's mainly
[3:14:16.980 --> 3:14:22.660]  old people that listen to him now and think they're listening to the young guy because he's like 45
[3:14:22.660 --> 3:14:27.940]  50 whatever he is and then they're like 75 80 not against old folks the point is they tune into
[3:14:27.940 --> 3:14:32.900]  saturday night live they tune into this guy the demographics show it or the dumbest trendies do
[3:14:32.900 --> 3:14:38.900]  and then he sits there on a high horse telling us how we're a joke i mean we probably got let's not
[3:14:38.900 --> 3:14:46.180]  let's not exaggerate a million and a half people right now watching so everybody knows the average
[3:14:46.180 --> 3:14:50.180]  person was just like eight minutes for ours it's like 15 and a half we have all the algorithms
[3:14:50.180 --> 3:14:53.380]  i don't even time to mess with it all the point is it's not exaggerate million and a half right
[3:14:53.380 --> 3:14:57.140]  now stuff goes on youtube a couple things you know by tomorrow this little 10 minute segment
[3:14:57.140 --> 3:15:02.100]  two or three million people okay whatever we have a budget maybe to run this 15 minutes of a couple
[3:15:02.100 --> 3:15:06.900]  thousand dollars you've got hundreds of thousands of night bro and we're as big as you were bigger
[3:15:06.900 --> 3:15:13.860]  and that's just in a 15 minute segment so you know how cool it sounds to young people to say i'm
[3:15:13.860 --> 3:15:21.780]  on steroids and peyote see you're you don't get you already lost you're showing internet clips
[3:15:22.660 --> 3:15:28.340]  and things and you don't even know that you're empowering us to get your limited audience and
[3:15:28.340 --> 3:15:34.020]  why we've tripled our audience the last year you just you just don't get it bro we've got more viewers
[3:15:34.020 --> 3:15:40.980]  many weeks so the super bowl has figured that out yet but i get it you're all these weak people from
[3:15:40.980 --> 3:15:46.020]  weak families i'm not mad about it i'm sad up in new york all feeling powerful all around each other
[3:15:46.020 --> 3:15:50.340]  just but like betas do we're still number one right you know we're still number one we're still
[3:15:50.340 --> 3:15:57.380]  yeah we are okay let's move forward again all right you're like hitler and his bunker in 1945
[3:15:57.380 --> 3:16:05.540]  with the russians two miles away they were still believing until there were salvos from artillery
[3:16:05.540 --> 3:16:11.460]  detonating every second and they finally blew their heads off and took cyanide or either or
[3:16:11.460 --> 3:16:20.660]  hitler did both reportedly because there were bombs going off huge ones every second they didn't
[3:16:20.660 --> 3:16:25.780]  figure out until the last day and a half two days that no there's millions of people surrounding you
[3:16:25.780 --> 3:16:33.940]  you're dead politically in this case physically oh it went to argentina the matter the nazi regime was
[3:16:33.940 --> 3:16:40.180]  over whatever happened and this guy is in his new york bunker up there dancing around thinking
[3:16:40.180 --> 3:16:47.220]  if he ridicules us that makes us be destroyed that's what empowers trump and info wars because
[3:16:47.220 --> 3:16:52.100]  you're the scum you're the establishment you're the fake liberal we know what you're doing
[3:16:52.100 --> 3:16:56.740]  hey i'm in over i'm an overdrive live on here i'll call you right back
[3:16:58.180 --> 3:17:01.940]  so all that's going on and and people are sick of teleprompters they know
[3:17:01.940 --> 3:17:06.500]  we're talk radio on the internet meets the real world we don't we're not scripted everybody already
[3:17:06.500 --> 3:17:11.540]  knows let's get the break so let's go to cobert i'm gonna try to be nice and play the report
[3:17:11.540 --> 3:17:14.980]  without stopping it and then just comment on the eggs i got more clips to play here at us
[3:17:16.020 --> 3:17:20.340]  and i hope that doesn't upset donald trump because he's a bit of a hothead loose cannon
[3:17:20.340 --> 3:17:27.140]  hard king good boss sorry i said i wouldn't do it start to be it's the globals that want to start
[3:17:27.140 --> 3:17:30.420]  war with russia they're the ones at world war three they founded the arab spring they're the
[3:17:30.420 --> 3:17:34.980]  ones with the pivot to china they're the ones that all the even top analysts say are trying to try to
[3:17:34.980 --> 3:17:41.540]  war major detente with trump trump's trying to dial all that back so now trump's going to cause
[3:17:41.540 --> 3:17:46.980]  nuclear war kind of like the 1960s deal against very gold water except we were let's play that
[3:17:46.980 --> 3:17:51.780]  out at the 33 after or not add that promo video where leon the newt going off you can find it
[3:17:51.780 --> 3:17:53.140]  and the nuclear war ad we did
[3:17:56.100 --> 3:17:59.940]  oh that thing got about 20 million views on different platforms five million here three
[3:17:59.940 --> 3:18:04.340]  million there two million there eight million here oh yeah we made an ad that got seen more
[3:18:04.340 --> 3:18:09.700]  than it did in the 1960s election against very gold water would you elect him nooks go off
[3:18:09.700 --> 3:18:14.820]  we ran our ad and it kicked your ass you're the real ones causing nuclear war see at every point
[3:18:14.820 --> 3:18:21.380]  i can defeat cobear with the facts oh we took your little propaganda and actually used it
[3:18:21.380 --> 3:18:25.380]  because it was the truth that hillary might cause nuclear war see how that feels dumbo
[3:18:25.380 --> 3:18:29.460]  oh and one of our videos on youtube had more views than your show every night
[3:18:31.460 --> 3:18:37.460]  good job darren mcbreen and leon magnate with that little piece how's that for you let's go back
[3:18:37.460 --> 3:18:42.260]  to him here he is and i hope that doesn't upset donald trump because he's a bit of a hothead
[3:18:42.260 --> 3:18:47.620]  head loose cannon parkeg dump truck
[3:18:49.860 --> 3:18:55.300]  pull tab which is why it's important for him to be counseled by people who are even keeled
[3:18:55.300 --> 3:19:00.500]  unfortunately he's talking to some jerk named alex jones the far-right conspiracy theorist
[3:19:00.500 --> 3:19:04.820]  who has apparently taken on a new role as occasional information source and validator for
[3:19:04.820 --> 3:19:12.260]  trump it paused with whom he sometimes back it up this is the thing i'm talking about when homeland
[3:19:12.260 --> 3:19:16.740]  came out and admitted this is an alex jones character we have him say these things and then
[3:19:16.740 --> 3:19:23.460]  he's always wrong they had all these articles saying jones is insane he thinks this new character
[3:19:23.460 --> 3:19:32.660]  is about him so cobear just did it again oh some jerk but now we got to talk about it and again
[3:19:32.660 --> 3:19:37.460]  there's the key they're acting like they're discrediting trump no they want trump to be dumb
[3:19:37.460 --> 3:19:43.300]  and not understand his base and these issues are what makes him bona fide and what gives him
[3:19:43.860 --> 3:19:49.940]  his aura of the people that he delivers an action he's better than gold keep going
[3:19:51.380 --> 3:19:56.500]  and validate horror for trump with whom he sometimes speaks on the phone okay information
[3:19:56.500 --> 3:20:03.380]  source uh validator speaks on the phone sounds uh okay good to have a variety of voices in a time
[3:20:03.380 --> 3:20:09.540]  of crisis let's let's see what this guy's like i'm animated i'm alive my heart's big it's got hot
[3:20:09.540 --> 3:20:17.300]  blood going through it fast i like to fight too i like to eat i like to have children
[3:20:18.980 --> 3:20:25.140]  i'm here i got a life force this is a human this is what we look like this is what we act like
[3:20:25.140 --> 3:20:30.100]  this is what everybody was like before us this is what i am this is why you don't make steroids
[3:20:30.100 --> 3:20:36.100]  with peyote this is why this this is it now i don't
[3:20:42.660 --> 3:20:47.860]  you applause they're actually cheering me i don't know how to explain this uh but just
[3:20:47.860 --> 3:20:54.340]  watching that clip he somehow got spittle on me so alex jones has influence in the white house
[3:20:54.340 --> 3:20:59.940]  trump has even sent in messages to alex jones show congratulating him on his great reputation
[3:20:59.940 --> 3:21:05.540]  now if you've been living underground for the last few years you probably listen to alex jones
[3:21:05.540 --> 3:21:11.940]  but for the rest of you he runs a conspiracy website called info wars okay the name's easy
[3:21:11.940 --> 3:21:19.220]  to remember just imagine info then imagine someone at war with it and donald trump's phone buddy has
[3:21:19.220 --> 3:21:23.540]  gained a reputation for telling it like it isn't all right back it up like this explanation i'm
[3:21:23.540 --> 3:21:29.300]  going to talk about this because this is key here you said the same thing before i'm at war with info
[3:21:29.860 --> 3:21:36.180]  no information warfare means using information to win to have your culture to promote some idea
[3:21:36.180 --> 3:21:44.180]  whether it's true or not the globalist called what he does against us information war so we're
[3:21:44.180 --> 3:21:51.620]  exposing information war to everybody let's practice about 20 seconds because i want to go over
[3:21:51.620 --> 3:21:57.220]  all these pieces everything he's saying is a fundamental uh deception keep going
[3:21:58.420 --> 3:22:04.820]  full wars okay the name's easy to remember just imagine info then imagine someone at war with it
[3:22:06.100 --> 3:22:10.020]  and donald trump's phone buddy has gained a reputation for telling it like it isn't
[3:22:10.740 --> 3:22:15.140]  like this explanation as to why men are gay the reason there's so many gay people now
[3:22:15.140 --> 3:22:18.740]  is because it's a chemical warfare operation here's the inside of this juice box
[3:22:18.740 --> 3:22:23.220]  and if you and if they zoom in any more see that thin plastic it's got it exactly your
[3:22:24.100 --> 3:22:28.340]  again they admit misfealings doing this they admit the runoff is causing frogs to be
[3:22:29.140 --> 3:22:35.140]  asexual or bisexual it's a fact you can pull it up yourself but they make a joke out of it
[3:22:35.140 --> 3:22:41.620]  and use stuff from like you know six and a half years ago and then they have it edited to say
[3:22:41.620 --> 3:22:45.300]  i'm anti-gay when i said i'm not anti-gay this is how they deceive you here it is
[3:22:45.300 --> 3:22:51.220]  you're done drinking your little juices well you i mean you're you're ready to go out and
[3:22:51.220 --> 3:22:57.700]  have a baby you're ready to put makeup on you're ready to wear a short skirt yes juice boxes make
[3:22:57.700 --> 3:23:03.540]  men into women a couple of sips and suddenly your capri son is your capri daughter in a full
[3:23:03.540 --> 3:23:09.220]  well they're big secret about estrogen in the beer now the hops certain breed of hops does it
[3:23:09.220 --> 3:23:14.980]  it's it's been declassified he knows that he's a he's a ruling new yorker he's over here he's not fair
[3:23:14.980 --> 3:23:20.820]  to judge a guy on one isolated dumbass clip let's do some short clips again edit together
[3:23:21.540 --> 3:23:28.500]  Alex is anti-gay he's saying the chemicals are making people gay folks it's making the frogs gay
[3:23:28.500 --> 3:23:33.780]  two-thirds of the frogs down in houston are bisexual every major western country heavily
[3:23:33.780 --> 3:23:38.660]  involved in 9-11 it took me about a year with sandy hook to come to grips with the fact that the
[3:23:38.660 --> 3:23:46.020]  whole thing was fake the attacks in orlando were a false flag it's a part and in that very clip all
[3:23:46.020 --> 3:23:50.100]  those i said our main government's not involved they're bringing in radical islam they're letting
[3:23:50.100 --> 3:23:55.140]  them attack that is a form of false flagged by obama letting them in or bush and the globalists
[3:23:55.140 --> 3:23:59.460]  letting them do this in the 28 pages that had congress been on to break down their inside
[3:23:59.460 --> 3:24:03.380]  job means criminal elements a lot of it happened they turned that around and little clips just
[3:24:03.380 --> 3:24:08.340]  saying it's all fake to say the government did it again more little short clips to deceive you go
[3:24:08.340 --> 3:24:13.940]  ahead hear my show and it sounds like the most powerful talk radio i've ever heard other times
[3:24:13.940 --> 3:24:22.580]  it sounds like a monkey doing you know what with a football so to recap one of the counselors to the
[3:24:22.580 --> 3:24:30.180]  president knows what it sounds like when a monkey the football i was a boss and again it's part of
[3:24:30.180 --> 3:24:34.340]  humor to say i don't have all the answers i'm not perfect so they take that even have me quote
[3:24:34.340 --> 3:24:39.220]  his credit myself but that's just the genuineness of it all so it's another guy that thinks he's
[3:24:39.220 --> 3:24:43.460]  better than you he just deceived his audience he couldn't come out in the monologue this guy planned
[3:24:43.460 --> 3:24:49.300]  all day for a 30 minute show or a two minute monologue where he comes out and gives us to
[3:24:49.300 --> 3:24:56.020]  sound really smarty pants people are done with it bro they're done they want real that's why
[3:24:56.020 --> 3:25:00.660]  cobert's show might get canceled the ratings are in the toilet ours are of course exploding cobert
[3:25:00.660 --> 3:25:04.500]  but we're not new york we're i mean nothing is new yorkers are right people but you know we're
[3:25:04.500 --> 3:25:14.260]  not in the cool area let's go back to him alex jones is not content with talking to the leader of
[3:25:14.260 --> 3:25:20.100]  the free world he's also hoping info wars will qualify for a white house press credential so
[3:25:20.100 --> 3:25:23.940]  to those of you working in the white house press pool you're gonna want to get some earplugs
[3:25:23.940 --> 3:25:29.700]  and a poncho more disinfo they're full well we're gonna put reporters up there we already have
[3:25:29.700 --> 3:25:34.900]  uh do you guys remember this the president called the media the enemy of the american people okay
[3:25:34.900 --> 3:25:39.220]  so we're going to sign up to boo right there you're off the hook it's unlimited
[3:25:39.860 --> 3:25:47.300]  nash back it up national polls by their own system show seven to nine to ten point support
[3:25:47.300 --> 3:25:52.500]  the media has the lowest privilege we know that but you all just heard them boo oh he doesn't like
[3:25:52.500 --> 3:26:00.100]  the mainstream media boo no trump said he doesn't like the fake media you lied again just like he

[3:26:06.260 --> 3:26:13.380]  you think we're dumbasses but again he's steven cobert imagine all the weird mummies and globalists
[3:26:13.380 --> 3:26:22.260]  he hangs out with all day how crazy it is let's finish up okay so you're you're off the hook
[3:26:22.260 --> 3:26:31.780]  unlimited breadsticks now that upset that upset they're delicious now that upset a lot of media
[3:26:31.780 --> 3:26:37.940]  in response today the washington post added a subheader to its front page that says
[3:26:38.500 --> 3:26:44.900]  democracy dies in darkness so the washington post has officially entered its goth phase
[3:26:44.900 --> 3:26:51.380]  because it's just back it up democracy dies in darkness another lie so he says trump has declared the
[3:26:51.380 --> 3:26:58.180]  media the enemy no he said fake news media when they're putting out fake news so you lie and then
[3:26:58.180 --> 3:27:03.540]  the washington post run by the cia openly bought by the cia through jeff bezos 600 million last year
[3:27:04.100 --> 3:27:08.340]  per year 600 millions paid by the cia to run it the criminal elements the president what's he's
[3:27:08.340 --> 3:27:12.980]  supposed to do he knows it's fake another deals made with taxpayers for the cia to be running the
[3:27:12.980 --> 3:27:19.620]  washington post through jeff bezos and amazon they've given ai technology to bezos to track everything

[3:34:13.540 --> 3:34:17.380]  let me run a bunch of naked guys quite frankly you know you gotta get over that that's your own sex
[3:34:19.220 --> 3:34:24.980]  it's not normal in human societies to have you know people male sometimes gotta go up to warships
[3:34:24.980 --> 3:34:28.980]  fishing whenever they see other guys naked still don't you know women all together it's a little
[3:34:28.980 --> 3:34:33.540]  weird the point is is that you certainly don't want to see men in there but they deliberately
[3:34:33.540 --> 3:34:38.820]  want to force this in they want to do this he says i wondered if she is the problem or her
[3:34:38.820 --> 3:34:44.980]  overprotective and intolerant dad teach tolerance yeah yeah this this young girl saw a guy in the

[3:34:54.820 --> 3:34:59.940]  this probably don't tell a prompter you know was told to sweet this but this is this is the agenda

[3:35:04.420 --> 3:35:09.700]  grow up and be their own person when they ask for guidance you give it to them you don't go tell

[3:35:34.820 --> 3:35:39.220]  mentally all like them and it's just time to say no to them because they all have a cosmology of
[3:35:39.220 --> 3:35:44.020]  why they're doing it but it really is just a blueprint for their mental illness the pope
[3:35:44.820 --> 3:35:48.660]  chinese catholics for pope frances will rat them out to communists because he's merged with the
[3:35:48.660 --> 3:35:52.260]  government given them the list i mean it's just it's i said that a month ago he's with the communist

[3:36:20.500 --> 3:36:24.820]  total chilling effect totally illegal from my view my perspective uh you know we move on to
[3:36:24.820 --> 3:36:28.740]  some other company that's better or we go ahead and sue them just because you have to defend other
[3:36:28.740 --> 3:36:32.820]  people it's kind of a cost of analysis i don't see how we can't take action because everybody else

[3:38:58.500 --> 3:39:03.060]  it's real personal for me it's spiritual i'm obsessed with it and i get pissed at myself for
[3:39:03.060 --> 3:39:06.900]  not raising enough money when i when the sun's shining and when i could have then they just i
[3:39:06.900 --> 3:39:10.980]  take for granted something took us three years to develop how to advertise the way to do it the way
[3:39:10.980 --> 3:39:17.780]  to you know pick the right markets to do it and to bring in 3.3 million profit after the money
[3:39:17.780 --> 3:39:22.020]  we spent into the larger company to fund things not profit for ourselves which would be okay but
[3:39:22.020 --> 3:39:26.900]  profit for the you know the funding operation spare money to fund info wars and we're advertising
[3:39:26.900 --> 3:39:32.260]  outside of here to get money to come do this the average globalist would just you know run this and
[3:39:32.260 --> 3:39:35.620]  do stuff and have another thing that's another company they keep all the money i take the money
[3:39:35.620 --> 3:39:42.980]  and i put it back in and they just blew that all the way but i mean it just makes me worried man
[3:39:42.980 --> 3:39:47.300]  what else are they going to launch what else is coming i better get used to going to the public
[3:39:47.300 --> 3:39:50.820]  and you know ringing the salvation army can here if you want but it's all you're just giving us

[3:40:02.020 --> 3:40:05.460]  the seven percent markup ours like a hundred percent when we discount them it's less
[3:40:06.740 --> 3:40:10.020]  people argue with me here in the crew they're great folks they're smart they well we give

[3:42:15.860 --> 3:42:19.700]  of giving them special privilege and protection there used to be a time when somebody who was on
[3:42:19.700 --> 3:42:23.380]  the news media would say something like that it would be the end of their career they wouldn't be
[3:42:23.380 --> 3:42:28.020]  celebrated by as heroes and that's what we're seeing happening with with him and i i think it's
[3:42:28.020 --> 3:42:33.540]  really sad to see that i think it's also sad to see that we've got besie deboss who is very reluctant
[3:42:33.540 --> 3:42:37.540]  to give up the power of the state to force people on that she had to be called into trump's office
[3:42:37.540 --> 3:42:42.500]  so about the senator and and and the education people and all of them yeah they're all battling
[3:42:42.500 --> 3:42:47.060]  trump saying we want obama care we want the state to serve our education he gets these people in
[3:42:47.060 --> 3:42:51.140]  and then they won't even follow what the people want she says we're going to be watching i'm
[3:42:51.140 --> 3:42:54.740]  going to have my lawyers watching all you people make sure nobody's bullying you know who the bully
[3:42:54.740 --> 3:42:59.860]  is the bully is the department of education the bully is betsy deboss we shouldn't even have a
[3:42:59.860 --> 3:43:03.140]  department of education and remember we didn't like her i noticed she's already back back in
[3:43:03.140 --> 3:43:06.580]  trump yeah there's people in trump's administration like bannon who says look we've got to get rid of
[3:43:06.580 --> 3:43:11.700]  the administrative state here that's uh entrenched itself and that's exactly what oh yeah what do
[3:43:11.700 --> 3:43:17.060]  you make of beck saying it's dangerous and crazy to say we should look out for our own economy whoa
[3:43:17.060 --> 3:43:22.020]  i mean if that guy isn't done what is clear channel doing with him i mean it's just crazy
[3:43:22.020 --> 3:43:26.740]  well as i said earlier the program beck comes in and he says we don't want to conservatives don't
[3:43:26.740 --> 3:43:32.100]  want to see the massive bureaucracy in washington cut down it's like oh what a conservative stand
[3:43:32.100 --> 3:43:36.020]  for are they merely saying that they want to preserve the status quo because that's what now
[3:43:36.020 --> 3:43:40.180]  he wants to be saying artificial evidence is conservatism no we want we want what made america

[3:44:12.420 --> 3:44:18.580]  chris Cuomo says that if 12 year old girls feel uncomfortable or scared by seeing a naked person
[3:44:18.580 --> 3:44:24.660]  in the women's locker room who has a penis but identifies as a woman that the 12 year old girls
[3:44:24.660 --> 3:44:32.740]  are the quote problem because they're intolerant to transgender people i'm really a man i'll show
[3:44:32.740 --> 3:44:38.660]  you exactly what he said in his over 90 tweet twitter meltdown which included a rather lengthy
[3:44:38.660 --> 3:44:44.740]  twitter beef with me an insane meltdown that is making headlines now like in the daily caller
[3:44:44.740 --> 3:44:51.460]  which says cnn's chris Cuomo wants tolerance of naked men in women's restrooms but it's so much
[3:44:51.460 --> 3:44:57.060]  worse than that it all started when chris Cuomo who by the way is the brother of the current governor
[3:44:57.060 --> 3:45:03.460]  of new york andrew responded to this father of force tweet who says what do you tell a 12 year
[3:45:03.460 --> 3:45:10.100]  old girl who doesn't want to see a penis in the locker room the cnn host responded i wonder if
[3:45:10.100 --> 3:45:18.660]  she is the problem or her overprotective and intolerant dad teach tolerance he said and this
[3:45:18.660 --> 3:45:24.100]  is when i got involved in the conversation alerting everyone that cnn host chris Cuomo says that girls
[3:45:24.100 --> 3:45:30.580]  are quote intolerant for not wanting to see men's penises in girls locker rooms i then issued a
[3:45:30.580 --> 3:45:36.500]  clarification that he was talking about 12 year old girls when i said correction chris Cuomo said
[3:45:36.500 --> 3:45:43.220]  12 year old girls are the quote problem for not wanting people with penises in girls locker rooms
[3:45:43.220 --> 3:45:51.140]  you sick man he then responded find me the cases that show the spike the real risk well for starters
[3:45:51.140 --> 3:45:58.580]  you could take a look at this list of the top 25 recent instances of protransgender bathroom policies
[3:45:58.580 --> 3:46:05.060]  being dangerous to women and children i don't have time to go through all 25 of the i go get in the
[3:46:05.060 --> 3:46:10.660]  corner when i'm walking with men he then was modest again you little girl around us i'll give you
[3:46:10.660 --> 3:46:17.380]  10 times what you have to which i responded how are you going to give me 10 times more attention
[3:46:17.380 --> 3:46:23.940]  when my tweets have more engagement than yours i continued you can't have exactly it's all about
[3:46:23.940 --> 3:46:31.060]  he's the star she has and but dice is bigger than you como and retweets unless your followers
[3:46:31.060 --> 3:46:37.860]  are fake let's do some simple math my first tweet to him calling him out got 2.7 thousand likes
[3:46:37.860 --> 3:46:49.220]  and 2 thousand retweets his response to me got 10 retweets and 49 likes 2700 likes divided by
[3:46:49.220 --> 3:47:00.740]  his 49 is mine got 55 times more engagement 55 times more attention on my tweet than yours chris
[3:47:00.740 --> 3:47:08.420]  let's check the difference between retweet ratios shall we yours got 10 retweets mine got
[3:47:08.420 --> 3:47:19.380]  2000 2000 divided by 10 is 200 my tweet got 200 times more attention than yours you phony
[3:47:19.380 --> 3:47:26.500]  he responds don't use caps and insults use facts well i just pointed out some facts so let me point
[3:47:26.500 --> 3:47:32.020]  out a few more i said just read the replies to your original tweet and see how women feel about
[3:47:32.020 --> 3:47:38.020]  your insane statement they're already feeling victimized let me just point out again the fact
[3:47:38.020 --> 3:47:45.060]  that there has been compilations of at least the top 25 recent instances of crimes being committed
[3:47:45.060 --> 3:47:50.500]  because of this issue because by allowing anyone to use any bathroom that they choose because they
[3:47:50.500 --> 3:47:59.780]  supposedly identify as that gender you are saying that this 54 year old father now identifies as a
[3:47:59.780 --> 3:48:06.340]  six year old girl should be allowed to use the women's bathroom and maybe chris Cuomo should
[3:48:06.340 --> 3:48:12.580]  invite this guy over to play with his kids i'm sorry this girl over this little six year old girl
[3:48:12.580 --> 3:48:18.500]  to come over and play with your daughter chris and if society is going to consider this person who
[3:48:18.500 --> 3:48:23.140]  has a white chromosome and a penis but puts a dress on and puts his hair in pigtails if we're
[3:48:23.140 --> 3:48:30.980]  going to consider this person to be a girl a woman and allow it to shower and change in the
[3:48:30.980 --> 3:48:35.940]  girls locker rooms and showers at the gym and at any school and any public facility and private
[3:48:35.940 --> 3:48:40.900]  facility otherwise it's discrimination then this opens up a bigger can of worms as i posted
[3:48:40.900 --> 3:48:48.580]  as i posted what bathrooms will the other 29 legally recognized genders in new york use because in
[3:48:48.580 --> 3:48:55.860]  the state of new york where chris Cuomo it lives there are 31 different genders that are legally
[3:48:55.860 --> 3:49:03.780]  recognized it's not just male female trans male trans female this and that 31 different genders
[3:49:04.500 --> 3:49:08.420]  so which bathroom is someone going to use if they just don't identify as any gender which is a
[3:49:08.420 --> 3:49:13.780]  legally recognized gender it's called a gender they're not a male they're not female they're just
[3:49:13.780 --> 3:49:18.100]  neither which bathroom are they going to use by going down the slippery slope that these liberals
[3:49:18.100 --> 3:49:24.020]  want to push america down you're opening the door to anybody just deciding if they just want to
[3:49:24.020 --> 3:49:28.580]  start questioning their gender which is also a gender gender questioning they're not sure they
[3:49:28.580 --> 3:49:32.980]  want to maybe try to be the different gender they want to explore and see how that feels
[3:49:32.980 --> 3:49:37.780]  you're opening the door to anyone just saying hey i'm just gender questioning today hey you know
[3:49:37.780 --> 3:49:42.100]  i think i'm just going to go and shower in the girls locker room today at the gym this is twilight
[3:49:42.100 --> 3:49:48.740]  zone level in sanity let me just have this little boy from Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1990 film kindergarten
[3:49:48.740 --> 3:50:00.980]  cop explain this to you boys have a penis girls have a vagina okay that's uh mark dice's report
[3:50:00.980 --> 3:50:08.420]  and uh we're trying to explain some basic facts to um the press i i can't understand that somebody
[3:50:08.420 --> 3:50:13.620]  like Cuomo would even still have his job after tweeting out stuff like that but consider the
[3:50:13.620 --> 3:50:17.860]  fact that we got John Podesta joining the Washington Post now as a contributing columnist they would
[3:50:17.860 --> 3:50:22.500]  not be fake news would they remember we heard John we heard uh Colbert saying that the Washington
[3:50:22.500 --> 3:50:26.580]  Post had now entered its dark phase maybe he was referring to the fact that they've now hired John
[3:50:26.580 --> 3:50:31.780]  Podesta this guy who is so connected to the Clintons ran the campaign for now he's going
[3:50:31.780 --> 3:50:38.020]  to run the campaign for Washington Post who is running very hard against the Trump administration
[3:50:38.020 --> 3:50:42.900]  we know exactly what this is about and we've got the White House being criticized on the hill
[3:50:42.900 --> 3:50:49.060]  saying they handpicked select media outlets to have a gaggle meeting after the press conference
[3:50:49.060 --> 3:50:54.580]  with the press secretary nobody ever complained about the fact that these guys had an exclusive
[3:50:54.580 --> 3:50:59.300]  to the White House for decades all my life it's been handpicked media they just don't like the
[3:50:59.300 --> 3:51:03.140]  fact it's not them are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals are you happy doing

[3:53:57.780 --> 3:54:16.740]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night i saw this article yesterday i just
[3:54:16.740 --> 3:54:25.140]  cannot get past it john bainer goes on politico and he says yesterday that obama care repeal
[3:54:25.140 --> 3:54:30.820]  and replacement just isn't going to happen that's his words he says it's just happy talk he said
[3:54:30.820 --> 3:54:35.220]  when he heard people talking about this in november after the election it's like yes we finally got
[3:54:35.220 --> 3:54:39.860]  trump in now we're going to get this thing replaced he said i just laughed well you know
[3:54:39.860 --> 3:54:46.660]  why john bainer the last laugh may be on you because yes i know that the republicans in congress
[3:54:47.220 --> 3:54:51.460]  and your handpicked successor paul ryan doesn't want to see obama care replaced but the american
[3:54:51.460 --> 3:54:56.740]  people do that's why we put donald trump there and i think donald trump is going to give them a plan
[3:54:56.740 --> 3:55:02.580]  he's going to have a lot of speaking engagements leading up to this and i think he's going to
[3:55:02.580 --> 3:55:07.300]  bring the full weight of the american people to bear on this and we already got you out of there
[3:55:07.300 --> 3:55:13.540]  of course it was interesting how politico put this they said bainer who resigned in 2015 amid
[3:55:13.540 --> 3:55:21.620]  unrest among conservatives oh really the unrest among conservatives got him out of there and no
[3:55:21.620 --> 3:55:26.820]  it was a full-on rebellion and the american people are a big part of that and you're going to see a
[3:55:26.820 --> 3:55:31.300]  lot of anger if you guys get in the way of the repeal of obama care let me give you an example
[3:55:31.300 --> 3:55:37.220]  of this this is a story from zero hedge about philadelphia's soda tax so that led to a 30 to
[3:55:37.220 --> 3:55:44.260]  50 plunge in sales and massive layoffs so what is the principle here well the principle is
[3:55:45.060 --> 3:55:49.700]  that if you want to kill something you tax it right we understood that reagan talked about that
[3:55:50.340 --> 3:55:56.500]  the supreme court and obama in order to get the unconstitutional mandates through said obama care
[3:55:56.500 --> 3:56:02.420]  is a tax yes it is and guess what it's killing it's killing among other things insurance companies
[3:56:02.420 --> 3:56:07.940]  and health insurance we've already seen humana and etna say humana got out of it first major
[3:56:07.940 --> 3:56:11.300]  carrier to get up there's been a lot of others who couldn't afford to stay in it's not a good deal
[3:56:11.300 --> 3:56:16.980]  for the consumer and it's not a good deal for the health insurance companies and so humana has
[3:56:16.980 --> 3:56:21.460]  thrown in the towel they were going to merge with etna the government said no you can't merge etna
[3:56:21.460 --> 3:56:28.020]  says we're maybe getting out of obama care as well see it's kind of like both of them are losing money
[3:56:28.020 --> 3:56:31.300]  off of obama care and it's like don't worry we're losing money on every transaction we'll make it
[3:56:31.300 --> 3:56:37.620]  up in volume no you can't do that you can't make money by merging if you're both losing money on
[3:56:37.620 --> 3:56:42.660]  it you've got to get out of it and americans have to get out of it the consumers have to get out of
[3:56:42.660 --> 3:56:47.460]  it it's not just the health insurance because health insurance is not the goal folks remember that
[3:56:48.420 --> 3:56:53.540]  the goal is health care that we can afford now they said it was affordable we called it obama
[3:56:53.540 --> 3:56:59.140]  care we should have called it obama tax that's what donald trump should call it when he pushes back
[3:56:59.140 --> 3:57:05.220]  against it the supreme court said it's a tax call it a tax it's the obama tax let's get rid of that
[3:57:05.220 --> 3:57:11.540]  obama tax because it's not just a tax on health insurance it's a tax on health care on health
[3:57:11.540 --> 3:57:18.980]  providers on medical devices it's a broad-reaching tax now what happened in philadelphia well they
[3:57:18.980 --> 3:57:25.060]  said we're going to have a tax that's going to fund a lot of different projects that we have here
[3:57:25.060 --> 3:57:29.540]  no it didn't actually they dropped their revenue dropped 30 to 50 percent what they did was and
[3:57:29.540 --> 3:57:36.180]  here's a picture of a receipt on this article that a 10 pack of flavored water that had a 51
[3:57:36.180 --> 3:57:40.740]  percent beverage tax and so how did that work out when you combine it with the six percent
[3:57:41.300 --> 3:57:46.580]  sales tax at the state level the two percent at the philadelphia level that means that you get a
[3:57:46.580 --> 3:57:57.300]  six a 10 pack of soda that cost 647 last year now cost 975 and people are saying no we're not
[3:57:57.300 --> 3:58:02.580]  going to buy it so supermarkets and distributors are reporting a 30 to 50 drop in beverage sales
[3:58:02.580 --> 3:58:06.820]  and are now planning for layoffs just like what happened in the health care business
[3:58:07.460 --> 3:58:12.580]  you want to kill something you tax it meanwhile we got people in france putting out a petition
