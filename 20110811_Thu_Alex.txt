[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:40.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.480 --> 00:45.920]  hello ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us today it is thursday the 11th day of
[00:45.920 --> 00:52.320]  august 2011 we're going to be live here for the next three hours and we're also going to have
[00:52.320 --> 00:58.320]  wide open phones once i've gotten into some of the basic news now the stock market has dropped
[00:58.320 --> 01:04.080]  i don't know a thousand points or so in the last week and a half but today it's up 282 points
[01:04.080 --> 01:13.200]  currently CNBC asked the question markets are being irrational so stay away from stocks that's
[01:13.200 --> 01:20.160]  what their experts are saying is it really 2008 all over again and why it could get much much worse
[01:20.160 --> 01:24.960]  we're going to be looking at the ongoing riots in the UK with the British government the UK
[01:24.960 --> 01:31.680]  government now calling to restrict free speech all over that country and also start tracking and
[01:31.680 --> 01:37.680]  shutting down social media now if facebook twitter and others mainly twitter would have
[01:37.680 --> 01:41.760]  just shut down accounts that were calling for violence and coordinating criminal activity
[01:41.760 --> 01:46.640]  it wouldn't be needed to go after everyone's speech but this is how the system works the
[01:46.640 --> 01:53.120]  police stand down let four plus days of riots take place and then now parliament is meeting
[01:53.120 --> 01:59.760]  right now calling for all sorts of draconian restrictions as we predicted they would do
[01:59.760 --> 02:07.280]  in financial news we're going to be going over all of it today a national debt of 14 trillion
[02:07.280 --> 02:15.280]  try 211 trillion that's the headline by npr continuing government considers turning foreclosed
[02:15.280 --> 02:25.840]  houses into rentals continuing government is also trying to offer us bonds but a record low
[02:25.840 --> 02:33.600]  sales price for tenure notes again treasury sells tenure notes at record low rate we're
[02:33.600 --> 02:41.440]  going to be going over that report today also yawn climbs to 17 year high against the dollar
[02:41.440 --> 02:46.160]  we'll be breaking down exactly what that means another report here the sun never sets on the
[02:46.160 --> 02:53.840]  british welfare system and a system of total dependency there's a statement by the ex checker
[02:53.840 --> 03:00.160]  uh of the treasury over in england about the global financial meltdown that is being witnessed
[03:01.040 --> 03:08.880]  also i got some inside navy seal information not from my fort hood or fort bragg sources
[03:08.880 --> 03:17.360]  not from colonel six but directly directly from the father of the navy seal and i've
[03:17.360 --> 03:22.800]  really forgotten that i've known this individual for years i'll just leave it at that
[03:22.800 --> 03:29.120]  and we've got some inside information on that front fact i'll just put it out right now and
[03:29.120 --> 03:36.000]  they get more into it later 17 navy seals died not 22 and that's expected to come out very very
[03:36.000 --> 03:45.920]  soon and yes his son is not in seal team six but has a best friend in seal team six i'm not going
[03:45.920 --> 03:52.320]  to say too much or they'll be able to figure out who it is and they were very suspicious that they
[03:52.320 --> 03:59.760]  were ordered uh his son's friend survived he wasn't part of the crash um and wouldn't talk
[03:59.760 --> 04:06.000]  about whether he was on the bin laden raid or not they were very specific about the information
[04:06.000 --> 04:13.600]  that they gave me so i want to be careful about it um but to make a long story short and by the way
[04:13.600 --> 04:17.040]  this is all the information i have i don't have anything extra so there's no need for the government
[04:17.040 --> 04:22.480]  to come kill me um i just i just want to make that clarity info we get we release all of it except
[04:22.480 --> 04:28.160]  for the names uh that they do believe there was a bomb on board the helicopter and that they thought
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.080]  it was political that they were put on that national guard helicopter something that they're
[04:32.080 --> 04:37.920]  not normally done or that that many seals were put on board the helicopter and the scuttlebud is
[04:37.920 --> 04:43.920]  that they think somehow al qaeda or the taliban got a bomb on the helicopter of course that shows the
[04:43.920 --> 04:49.040]  naivete they can't believe that the government would do it but they do think that politics is
[04:49.040 --> 04:55.280]  involved somehow and so that is the information on that trial talk about that a little bit more
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.240]  when we come back we'll get into the latest and the riots going on in england we will also

[08:33.520 --> 08:40.080]  three hours we do have some special gas coming up i'll tell you a little bit more about later but
[08:40.080 --> 08:45.600]  the headline up at drudge report dot com the headline up at info wars dot com most dangerous
[08:45.600 --> 08:54.720]  time for global economy that's the head of the x checker or the treasury secretary of england
[08:55.440 --> 09:01.440]  saying that this is basically much more dangerous than the quote contrived controlled demolition
[09:01.440 --> 09:08.480]  and looting of the economy known as the global banker bailout of 2008 and of course as we predicted
[09:08.480 --> 09:13.200]  as soon as they had the super congress in place just like they had similar systems
[09:13.920 --> 09:20.000]  in ireland greece and other areas as soon as they use the earlier crises to get dictatorial
[09:20.000 --> 09:30.080]  control in place then they can start the real implosions of the economy also president obama
[09:30.080 --> 09:36.080]  is in deep water representative peter king says the pentagon cia must investigate uh yeah they're
[09:36.080 --> 09:44.320]  going to have belzebub investigate satan uh obama and the death of osama ben laden and the movie that
[09:44.320 --> 09:50.640]  he's producing uh secretly with the producers of hurtlocker which by the way is a very powerful
[09:50.640 --> 09:56.000]  movie had a lot of hype watch the movie on dvd months ago a year after it came out and it did
[09:56.000 --> 10:04.480]  certainly lived up to the hype but this is the type of propaganda we're dealing with and before
[10:04.480 --> 10:11.120]  i get into all the financial news and give the toll free number out and get into the latest big
[10:11.120 --> 10:17.440]  developments in england amazon disarms brits by banning self-defense items you know a few days
[10:17.440 --> 10:23.760]  ago it was pointed out that it was a 6500 percent that's when we happen to get a screenshot of it
[10:23.760 --> 10:30.560]  it was actually 7 000 plus percent one time uptick in sales of baseball bats they were the number
[10:30.560 --> 10:37.600]  one sales item on amazon uk and they've now said you know what you're not allowed to have a baseball
[10:37.600 --> 10:45.040]  bat aluminum wooden the little batons uh wiffle wall bats you can't have it you can't protect
[10:45.040 --> 10:52.400]  yourself absolutely ridiculous and just an expanded example of how governments disarm the
[10:52.400 --> 10:58.400]  population crime explodes and the public has the book thrown at them when they try to defend
[10:58.400 --> 11:05.680]  themselves so now that's coming up as well also a very interesting article more and more governments
[11:05.680 --> 11:12.320]  are going to begin to unveil the super weapons i've interviewed dr bob bowman the former head
[11:12.320 --> 11:18.560]  of the star wars weapons program a colonel in the air force when he got out and went to a head up
[11:18.560 --> 11:27.840]  the sdi program and he could only talk about on air and privately with me things that had
[11:27.840 --> 11:33.840]  accidentally been declassified that weren't supposed to be and he talked about how the
[11:33.840 --> 11:40.480]  former head of sdi after he left in a debate about sdi really being an offensive weapon
[11:40.480 --> 11:48.720]  in the mid 1990s on c span that he went ahead and leaked the fact uh that is the pro sdi individual
[11:48.720 --> 11:58.160]  uh that they had had unmanned drones circling the earth since the 70s and so dr bob bowman in
[11:58.160 --> 12:04.720]  fact it's time to get bob bowman back on tomorrow or next week the problem is he really won't talk
[12:04.720 --> 12:12.080]  much about it but it's so interesting and it also shows all of these advanced technologies
[12:12.080 --> 12:21.920]  that are secret and kept from the public but the reason i raise all of this is that in the 1970s
[12:22.480 --> 12:28.480]  sdi was already in full swing the public wasn't even told about it until 1981 and then it was
[12:28.480 --> 12:33.520]  announced that it was supposedly a new initiative kind of like they've now admitted oh yeah 20 years
[12:33.520 --> 12:38.720]  ago we were cloning human embryos but killing them before they grew too large and yeah now
[12:38.720 --> 12:44.720]  we're mixing them with animals and we've been doing that for a decade and then of course later
[12:44.720 --> 12:49.760]  it'll come out that it was even previous to that so there's a lot of things going on
[12:51.360 --> 12:57.440]  that are secret in this world and here's the london guardian today it's also in a bunch of other
[12:57.440 --> 13:03.840]  us papers us military to launch fastest ever playing and if you guys give me a document cam
[13:03.840 --> 13:08.800]  shot i'll show folks this we can put the article up on screen for prison planet dot tv viewers
[13:08.800 --> 13:15.120]  radio listeners just go to info wars dot com us military to launch fastest ever playing
[13:15.760 --> 13:23.840]  unmanned falcon hypersonic technology vehicle can travel from london to sydney in less than an hour
[13:23.840 --> 13:34.560]  or and it flies at the declassified speed of 13 000 miles per hour or 20 times the speed of sound
[13:36.640 --> 13:42.640]  now i've talked a lot about this but and then i'll get into the rest of the news that's
[13:42.640 --> 13:48.720]  happening currently but this is a lot bigger than just a story about this this the space plane
[13:48.720 --> 13:55.280]  and is a space plane the issue here is there's a lot of secret technology just like the stealth
[13:55.280 --> 14:01.360]  helicopter that reportedly is three generations back from around 30 years ago uh that you saw
[14:01.360 --> 14:07.520]  crash in the supposed bin Laden raid there's a lot of things going on we don't know about
[14:07.520 --> 14:13.280]  and that's why the system's so arrogant that's why they're on such incredible power trips and people
[14:13.280 --> 14:18.240]  need to get a hold of the national security apparatus and force all this out in the open
[14:18.240 --> 14:23.760]  we've had the elite banking system setting up the cia and 47 and getting the national security
[14:23.760 --> 14:29.600]  act passed to be able to do whatever they want and so shipping in 500 billion in narcotics a year
[14:29.600 --> 14:37.840]  now totally admitted is the tip of the stinking iceberg we are not in kansas anymore human animal
[14:37.840 --> 14:46.080]  clones old technology space planes old technology they tell you that the sr 71 blackbird developed
[14:46.080 --> 14:55.440]  in 52 in secret service in 55 uh in public operation in 59 is the fastest aircraft in the world
[14:55.440 --> 15:03.120]  they've been saying that until today cruises at mach 3 reportedly can go mach 6 1950s technology
[15:03.120 --> 15:17.280]  we're not in 1950 we're in 2011 and i give you the unveiling of the new falcon h tv 2 they claim
[15:17.280 --> 15:21.920]  they've been testing it since 2003 and that eight years later they're letting you know about it now
[15:21.920 --> 15:28.400]  if you believe that i'll sell you the brooklyn bridge for five dollars us military to launch
[15:28.400 --> 15:34.800]  fastest ever plane give me a break unmanned falcon hypersonic technology vehicle to
[15:34.800 --> 15:39.120]  can travel from london to sydney in less than an hour by the time you finish reading the
[15:39.120 --> 15:44.320]  sentence the falcon h tv 2 the fastest plane ever built probably 30 years old
[15:45.120 --> 15:50.320]  undoubtedly they're now showing you the stinker toy could have flown 18 miles it could get from
[15:50.320 --> 15:55.280]  london to sydney in less than an hour while with standing temperatures of almost 2000
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.280]  centigrade hotter than the melting point of steel now they're going to start unveiling
[15:59.280 --> 16:03.600]  some of the 20 30 year old technology now because the russians and the chinese are
[16:03.600 --> 16:08.720]  getting a little uppity and i have predicted here they're now going to start unveiling the
[16:08.720 --> 16:18.720]  80s technology and 70s technology now dr bob bowman revealed on this broadcast that by 1979
[16:18.720 --> 16:27.280]  over 100 drone space planes in continuous orbit around the planet can decapitate the entire
[16:27.280 --> 16:35.520]  leadership of every major industrial nation in one hour with du 100 pound sabo meteor gun rounds
[16:38.640 --> 16:46.080]  100 pound sabo du rounds they are not atomic they don't cause a hydrogen explosion
[16:46.080 --> 16:52.160]  the incredible acceleration when they fire it into a gravity well at a target can destroy bases
[16:52.160 --> 16:57.920]  deeper than one mile under the earth under a mountain they don't have bases one mile under
[16:57.920 --> 17:03.680]  the sea level because temperatures are above 120 degrees you have to burrow a burrow under
[17:03.680 --> 17:10.640]  mountains you get the nice 65 degrees on average year round this is a decapitation total precision
[17:10.640 --> 17:18.080]  weapon and they by the 70s the globalists that run our country had these craft circling the earth
[17:18.080 --> 17:25.440]  now that's the 1970s and dr bowman can only talk about it because in a debate the other former
[17:25.440 --> 17:36.640]  head of sdi shot his mouth off now we're in 2011 and they're telling us about jumbo auroras and
[17:36.640 --> 17:43.040]  that's what this is i remember a popular science article a decade ago about troop vehicles reportedly
[17:43.040 --> 17:51.520]  in secret development that can deploy marine force recon space troops that can deploy navy
[17:51.520 --> 17:58.160]  seals anything they want in one hour anywhere in the world it goes up into space with its payload
[17:58.160 --> 18:06.960]  comes back in over the target they then are ejected in some type of space pod getting it down near
[18:06.960 --> 18:12.080]  the ground and then bring their little hovercraft in for a landing they've also have systems deployed
[18:12.080 --> 18:17.440]  where they're in one man pods and fired in like a missile and then around a hundred thousand feet
[18:17.440 --> 18:24.960]  they eject with oxygen mask on and space suits and come into the ground when i gave a speech in
[18:24.960 --> 18:31.120]  i gave two speeches two nights in a row to crowds of 900 each evening out in santa cruz last year i
[18:31.120 --> 18:37.520]  talked about thousands of dead special forces astronauts and that was the one thing in the two
[18:37.520 --> 18:43.680]  days of speeches that some people rolled their eyes at i have that information directly from high
[18:43.680 --> 18:51.200]  level people inside nasa who in both cases began shaking and gulping when i was given the information
[18:51.200 --> 18:57.760]  because they were giving me highly classified information in fact i shouldn't i should be
[18:57.760 --> 19:03.840]  talking about it because it'll get me killed if i don't and i was only given basics and it was not
[19:03.840 --> 19:10.240]  bowman that gave me this information there has been a giant ongoing secret space program since
[19:10.240 --> 19:16.960]  the 1940s the russians were never ahead of the united states the russians are advanced and technological
[19:16.960 --> 19:22.240]  but nothing compared to what the united states and the german scientists have developed all right
[19:22.240 --> 19:27.120]  now i'm going off into a rant about this but they're finally going to start rolling out the
[19:27.120 --> 19:31.680]  super weapons they're bankrupting the world and they're going to let everybody know you're going
[19:31.680 --> 19:36.720]  to sit here and take this or we'll take out every one of your leaders and believe me the russians
[19:36.720 --> 19:43.360]  know about this and that's why they had but barovsky one of the big russian leaders just uh
[19:43.360 --> 19:49.760]  uh boris barovsky uh just a few months ago come out and say we have super weapons too we'll destroy
[19:49.760 --> 19:54.240]  you and no doubt the russians have been building giant underground bases all under the urals and
[19:54.240 --> 19:59.760]  other areas and they've got a lot of super weapons as well we'll be right back we're not in kansas

[24:29.200 --> 24:33.920]  about it and that's admitted that upwards 90 percent is secret and i said hundreds have died
[24:33.920 --> 24:40.800]  and both individuals were like numbers higher and i said thousands i'm not going to say but
[24:40.800 --> 24:46.320]  they just smile at you there has been and the russians you've heard the rumors the reports of

[24:52.480 --> 25:00.720]  do not want to announce failures or successes but the point is there there have been people
[25:00.720 --> 25:07.120]  military bases police officers fbi agents there have been countless credible individuals who've
[25:07.120 --> 25:13.280]  reported i've had family that's seen it the big flying v wings the big giant things that look like
[25:13.280 --> 25:18.880]  blimps and everybody thinks it's aliens it's human technology in fact i've shown this before
[25:18.880 --> 25:27.440]  you type giant blimps or or no no ufo over salt lake you'll get abc news and larry king also
[25:27.440 --> 25:35.440]  covered it a few years ago saying what is it is it a ufo is it aliens and they zoom in with a
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.640]  superpower zoom at a blimp over a hundred thousand feet you could even see the stinking propellers on
[25:40.640 --> 25:49.280]  it and the solar panels on the site and it's admitted that darpa and homeland security have
[25:49.280 --> 25:56.640]  got these up uh in at very high altitudes they've crashed before but the media still goes with the
[25:56.640 --> 26:04.960]  official cover story of it must be aliens no these in fact there it is daily download abc news ufo
[26:04.960 --> 26:10.960]  blimp and then you watch the newscaster like is it alien what is it oh yeah give me a break it's a
[26:10.960 --> 26:16.880]  gigantic blimp it's not an alien it's got stinking propellers on it and tail fins but that's the
[26:16.880 --> 26:21.280]  low tech stuff they go with that because they're really inexpensive alexander hagg's company sold
[26:21.280 --> 26:30.160]  the concept back in the 90s to the u.s government these giant v wings seen these before everybody
[26:30.160 --> 26:35.840]  thinks they're little green men no they're not little green men it's the aurora program they've
[26:35.840 --> 26:42.000]  got fighters they've got drones they've got trip carriers they've got it all and they've done all
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.480]  sorts of tests and if you're out in the night sky some nights i've seen it repeatedly you see a
[26:47.360 --> 26:54.480]  giant explosion and wreckage and they say oh it's a satellite oh it's space lab sometimes it is
[26:54.480 --> 27:02.560]  sometimes it didn't sometimes it's secret astronaut program and they're burning up so it is a giant
[27:02.560 --> 27:13.040]  secret program and you're looking at aurora 13 000 miles an hour and you better believe this is a
[27:13.040 --> 27:20.720]  model t space plane you can go pull up like i've been to nasa in florida and in houston

[27:44.720 --> 27:50.080]  unlimited funding and then that whole nazi space program just got moved over here uh they had the
[27:50.080 --> 27:59.280]  b2 style bomber designs they of course invented the jet engine and um had all sorts of jet aircraft

[33:42.080 --> 33:50.560]  yesterday you notice they've got another rewrite i love how drudge has that comment before the article
[33:50.560 --> 33:58.400]  rewrite seals were sent to stop fleeing taliban not to rescue rangers it's funny at dinner last
[33:58.400 --> 34:03.200]  night for my mother's birthday my dad said oh they've changed the story they've done a rewrite
[34:03.840 --> 34:08.880]  now they weren't going to save rangers they were going to chase fleeing taliban
[34:08.880 --> 34:14.320]  on see they put out their official story and then no later troops are going to say it's a lie so
[34:14.320 --> 34:26.960]  then they start changing and changing and changing it again well it turns out now that well i was
[34:26.960 --> 34:34.640]  told by a navy seals father who is known by me for many many years and i'll just leave it at that
[34:34.640 --> 34:43.280]  that his friend is in seal team six did not die uh over the weekend his his son is a navy
[34:43.280 --> 34:51.200]  seals his son's friend is in seal team six so i was told by the father of his of the navy seal
[34:51.200 --> 34:55.280]  that his friend his best friend in seal team six who was not killed in the crash over the weekend
[34:56.320 --> 35:01.040]  that the seals are hopping mad are angry and believe that was foul play and that it was
[35:01.040 --> 35:09.040]  political that they were put on that helicopter on that rundown shinook that
[35:12.560 --> 35:17.840]  was a national guard helicopter and that's not normally done that the whole mission was quote
[35:17.840 --> 35:26.960]  political that there were concerns raised and that they believe that taliban or al qaeda was able to
[35:26.960 --> 35:34.880]  get a bomb on the helicopter so they're saying it was some type of inside job and and that reminds
[35:34.880 --> 35:42.720]  me of the fbi in the news after 9 11 saying it was as if al qaeda had moles inside of the fbi
[35:42.720 --> 35:48.480]  and justice department well well you bet the pentagon runs al qaeda just like amour al laki
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.640]  hanging out with the secretary of the army secretly at the pentagon while he's on the news is number
[35:52.640 --> 35:57.600]  three in al qaeda or the government getting the underwear bomber on the aircraft the christmas
[35:57.600 --> 36:12.800]  day bomber the list goes on and on so it's just like with the raid on may first which we then
[36:12.800 --> 36:18.080]  learned wasn't on may first it was the day before and ben laden was buried at sea and the situation
[36:18.080 --> 36:23.200]  room photo was fake and there wasn't a live video feed we relied to about that and ben laden didn't
[36:23.200 --> 36:28.640]  use his wife as a shield and didn't fire back and it wasn't a palace and on and on and on and on and
[36:28.640 --> 36:37.920]  on they practice lies to confuse you to confound you so you don't know what's true then the government
[36:37.920 --> 36:44.560]  put out fake ben laden photos circulated it gave it to people in the military so they would then
[36:44.560 --> 36:48.320]  feel like they'd seen the dead body that they were special then it came out the government
[36:48.320 --> 36:54.000]  circulated a fake photo we saw senators say i've seen the photo turned out they were shown the fake
[36:56.080 --> 37:01.920]  but then you can have arguments with people in the military we've had arguments some of the staff
[37:01.920 --> 37:06.560]  here with family they have in the military that still say they've seen the photo even when it's
[37:06.560 --> 37:12.480]  admitted it was fake just like 50 plus percent of so-called conservatives believe wmds were found
[37:12.480 --> 37:18.000]  in iraq even though it's admitted they weren't they remember the initial lie they're holding on to it
[37:19.280 --> 37:23.760]  now i know erin dykes is here and updating will you call him in here real quick because i know the
[37:23.760 --> 37:32.160]  story about the hypersonic uh space plane is on info wars dot com but now it's just been reported
[37:32.160 --> 37:38.480]  hypersonic plane lost how convenient they want everybody know they've got it but now it's been
[37:38.480 --> 37:43.680]  lost the u.s defense advanced research projects that's DARPA folks that invented the internet
[37:43.680 --> 37:49.680]  and everything else they give us what they want to give us with backdoors in it the u.s defense
[37:49.680 --> 37:55.200]  advanced research projects agency come on in erin i want to make sure this goes up right now in
[37:55.200 --> 38:05.440]  info wars dot com please sir u.s defense thank you u.s defense advanced research projects agency
[38:05.440 --> 38:12.480]  says contact with its experimental hypersonic glider was lost after launch from vandenberg
[38:12.480 --> 38:20.400]  air force base on the central california coast yeah lost and now orbiting uh as a as we were talking
[38:20.400 --> 38:26.640]  about before this was announced a minutes ago orbiting as a platform to drop du sabos and
[38:26.640 --> 38:31.840]  that's speculation but we know they've got them it's speculation that's what's happened here the
[38:31.840 --> 38:38.320]  agency says in a twitter posting that its unmanned falcon hypersonic technology vehicle too was
[38:38.320 --> 38:43.680]  launched today atop a rocket successfully separated from the booster and entered the mission's glide
[38:43.680 --> 38:50.560]  phase so it uses the slingshot of the earth's gravity to accelerate the agency says telemetry
[38:50.560 --> 38:58.400]  was supposedly lost but released no details yes we launched it but it was lost yes a similar
[38:58.400 --> 39:02.640]  vehicle was launched last year in return nine minutes at their data before contact was
[39:03.440 --> 39:08.640]  prematurely lost small aircraft is supposed to maneuver through the atmosphere at 13 000 miles
[39:08.640 --> 39:14.560]  per hour before intentionally diving into the ocean sure it is the u.s military is trying to
[39:14.560 --> 39:19.360]  develop technology response to threats around the globe at speeds of mock 20 or greater
[39:19.360 --> 39:29.040]  yes the little robot drones are being lost every time this is all because we know from
[39:29.040 --> 39:34.800]  dr bob bowman and others a perfect way to cover the factor being left in orbit and have little
[39:34.800 --> 39:43.760]  special payloads on them i just when you study this stuff 24 7 i fact i almost predicted it
[39:43.760 --> 39:47.840]  would be lost 30 minutes ago but i didn't okay let's let's just go ahead and go to your phone
[39:47.840 --> 39:53.760]  calls it just gets too insane i went and saw a planet of the apes a few nights ago with the crew
[39:53.760 --> 40:00.880]  and told rob halfway through i said all humans will die from a bio weapon release and then as
[40:00.880 --> 40:05.440]  the lights turned on at the theater prematurely the movie ended i guess that's part of the effect
[40:05.440 --> 40:10.000]  i said watch in the next one i turned to everybody and i said watch all humans will be killed by a
[40:10.000 --> 40:20.800]  a bio weapon release the same one that makes the ape super smart and then it'll cut back
[40:20.800 --> 40:26.080]  in another episode to the astronauts returning to the planet that's all kind of the illuminati
[40:26.080 --> 40:33.280]  idea the 2001 idea uh that the globalists are obsessed with and then the lights went back down
[40:33.280 --> 40:38.080]  and the movie came back on and then that indeed is what happens i'm sorry i just gave the movie away
[40:38.080 --> 40:45.280]  okay now i'm going to shut up now and just go to your calls i want to remind you there's a special

[41:52.800 --> 41:57.760]  thanks for holding your on the air god bless you young man i've been listening to your show for
[41:57.760 --> 42:04.800]  about two years now may i have just 30 seconds to give credit to a group here in southern california
[42:04.800 --> 42:13.520]  i call it bablon too to to thank you for waking us up here we pray for you every day alex we want
[42:13.520 --> 42:20.000]  you to continue this fight um we're passing out your cds it's a fantastic group it's an
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.600]  adventist group here in southern california we pass out the dvds and the cds at our market night
[42:25.600 --> 42:32.000]  and i got together with them and they oh they awakened me they got me to um to get rid of all
[42:32.000 --> 42:40.320]  my worldly ways uh to give up listening to uh the radar the media uh to get rid of you know
[42:40.320 --> 42:45.680]  watching anything that they that the national news and social parts tell those lies every day
[42:46.720 --> 42:52.720]  and um you know we just we just love you man you know we well carol we appreciate you as well
[42:52.720 --> 42:58.240]  you know i mean i overall it's good to unplug from television but it's good to monitor the propaganda
[42:58.240 --> 43:03.600]  you know i don't watch sitcoms or dramas but every time i do it's the methhead in the show
[43:03.600 --> 43:10.880]  that abuses children is a ron paul supporter or the libertarian uh is a pedophile or the person
[43:10.880 --> 43:15.920]  that wants national sovereignty wants to murder people uh or the person that is concerned about
[43:15.920 --> 43:21.120]  the federal reserve is going to release nerve gas in new york uh or the person that is concerned
[43:21.120 --> 43:29.920]  about kim trails uh is uh going to shoot children it's everywhere and so we've got to remember the
[43:29.920 --> 43:35.760]  brain dead public either folks are totally starting to wake up or they're getting more deep under
[43:35.760 --> 43:42.320]  mind control it's kind of that split is happening and we have to remember that that that it it is
[43:42.320 --> 43:47.920]  getting more and more overt and so it's it's good sometimes when i'm tired or don't want to do an
[43:47.920 --> 43:52.000]  extra broadcast or don't want to do another radio interview or don't want to you know really put in
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.880]  the midnight oil all i've got to do is turn on the news or really turn on entertainment that's
[43:56.880 --> 44:01.440]  what the real propaganda is because they know folks are in an area of suspended disbelief
[44:01.440 --> 44:06.320]  and are very subconsciously open to be programmed you watch it and it's like something out of
[44:07.520 --> 44:14.240]  some high-tech brainwashed future it is so ridiculous absolutely uh kim trails was was the
[44:14.240 --> 44:18.800]  first thing that i noticed and the group told me look out in the skies early in the morning you see
[44:18.800 --> 44:24.080]  a nice beautiful blue sky day but do you notice once the last time you saw this this guy just
[44:24.080 --> 44:28.800]  stained blue the rest of the day now from the fall of last year to the spring of this year
[44:29.520 --> 44:34.800]  horizon to horizon they shot the chapel way across the sky and then i was waking up people say did
[44:34.800 --> 44:39.440]  you did you notice that do you know what that is out there that's aluminum strontium barium and other
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.720]  types of poisonous gases that they're releasing on us each and every day and you know the people just
[44:44.720 --> 44:48.960]  you know were disbanded and didn't believe that but i've been trying to go around the crusade here
[44:48.960 --> 44:53.760]  in my local town well good job carl we got to jump to get to other folks but that's exciting look
[44:54.960 --> 45:01.440]  for those that are new listeners 17 years ago starting at about 95 before before i was even
[45:01.440 --> 45:06.800]  on air i got on air on access at 95 people were saying are you seeing how the jet trails
[45:06.800 --> 45:12.480]  don't go away now and pilots and people i knew were saying they must be dumping their fuel or
[45:12.480 --> 45:17.520]  something this is weird and they're forming at low altitudes even in the summer and it's forming
[45:17.520 --> 45:24.160]  these hazes and look at the chemicals and then by about 12 years ago different scientists would go
[45:24.160 --> 45:29.120]  up in their own aircraft and capture some of it they would test the soil they said it's barium
[45:29.120 --> 45:35.920]  salt strontium aluminum dioxide this is some type of weather modification and then two years ago
[45:35.920 --> 45:45.200]  the first speech the head of the science czar of all science operations for DARPA you name it
[45:45.200 --> 45:49.840]  that's what holdren's over the guy that says put stuff in the water to sterilize the public
[45:49.840 --> 45:54.640]  world government exterminate people a very very wicked person but he's in line with the rest of
[45:54.640 --> 45:59.840]  them and so that's why he's put in that position he came out and said yes well there's been a
[45:59.840 --> 46:07.920]  15 year long program so that's now 17 year program and he even mentions the Nobel Prize
[46:07.920 --> 46:12.880]  that the scientists won i think it was 92 were coming up with a plan to spray these things in
[46:12.880 --> 46:20.400]  the atmosphere to save us from global warming and some people say that when they did all those
[46:20.400 --> 46:25.040]  high altitude nuke test at blue holes in the ionosphere and they're trying to fix it i don't
[46:25.040 --> 46:31.440]  know the truth all i know is the old timers went and did the test made films went on record said
[46:31.440 --> 46:36.720]  it's barium salts aluminum dioxide got called crazy and then the government comes out and says
[46:36.720 --> 46:40.560]  yeah we've got secret programs that have been in the testing phase we're getting ready to go
[46:40.560 --> 46:46.160]  operational with geoengineering it's it's terraforming the planet toward to the way they want
[46:47.120 --> 46:52.880]  and it's secret the details but we are spraying aluminum dioxide's barium salts other things
[46:52.880 --> 46:58.160]  i mean exactly what the researcher said exactly
[47:00.720 --> 47:05.600]  and see it was always hidden in plain view it was about five years ago a caller called and he said
[47:06.880 --> 47:13.520]  you haven't typed in high altitude aerosol passive aerosol spraying campaign and i said no and and
[47:13.520 --> 47:17.520]  he said yeah i just found this and by the way nobody found this stuff it was a caller found it
[47:17.520 --> 47:22.560]  i put the call out looked it up on google and it was all these universities and department of energy
[47:22.560 --> 47:31.120]  and everybody involved with the un admitting worldwide weather modification test and that they
[47:31.120 --> 47:36.480]  were manipulating the weather and so for five years you know we've talked about it and a couple
[47:36.480 --> 47:40.960]  years into that john p holdren came out and said yeah it's all true we're doing it for your own good
[47:40.960 --> 47:46.320]  the tales are classified and that's what i mean they just go yeah we got space planes don't worry
[47:46.320 --> 47:50.800]  about it yeah we're spraying stuff in the atmosphere don't worry about it yeah we created some human
[47:50.800 --> 47:57.120]  clones don't worry about it yeah we crossed them with animals don't worry about it folks dancing
[47:57.120 --> 48:06.000]  with the stars american idol this is not what matters we are in a very very strange position
[48:06.000 --> 48:12.960]  right now with very crazy anti-human people running things that are jacking with our food
[48:12.960 --> 48:21.280]  our water the vaccines we're all in this together 99.9 percent of people are not aware of this
[48:21.280 --> 48:25.600]  who are outside of these circles we've reverse engineered the information and covered it
[48:25.600 --> 48:30.240]  but we are living in a science fiction movie we are living in a false reality
[48:31.440 --> 48:37.920]  if you're tuned into the mainline information on the news all right let's go to pastor
[48:37.920 --> 48:44.080]  launey in tennessee than john chris james john and others go ahead pastor yeah i got uh one
[48:44.080 --> 48:50.080]  question and uh two or three points real quick uh did you happen to see on july 13th a simulation
[48:50.080 --> 48:55.840]  of oil supply disruption i did hear that the government was working on that with oil companies
[48:55.840 --> 49:01.920]  but i didn't really read deeply into it tell us about it yeah it's on c span uh july 13th but
[49:01.920 --> 49:08.400]  it's been uh playing uh quite a bit lately uh basically they dealt with uh what lindsay williams
[49:08.400 --> 49:14.560]  was saying with uh 200 dollars a barrel of oil they're saying the processing facility in saudi
[49:14.560 --> 49:20.000]  arabia ab quad i think it's pronounced the number one largest oil process facility
[49:21.760 --> 49:27.120]  yeah i've got to pull that up in fact somebody took my pen out of here probably me somebody will
[49:27.120 --> 49:33.360]  run me a pen in here uh i will uh somebody steals the pens out of the studio to begin with i don't
[49:33.360 --> 49:39.920]  really mean steal i mean everybody everybody bars everybody's pens thank you jaren um yeah i did see
[49:39.920 --> 49:45.840]  that a few weeks ago so why don't you give me the name of it again i want the simulated oil
[49:45.840 --> 49:52.560]  disruption program of the department of energy yeah it was called the simulation oil supply is on
[49:52.560 --> 50:01.600]  c span one and it dealt with steward idon's at shoes and swab steve hadley john nigger ponte
[50:01.600 --> 50:09.520]  john hoffmeister you know uh ceo shell yeah what they're doing is they are just like they had
[50:09.520 --> 50:14.000]  meetings eight years ago on c span about how tsa would be on the streets of america they get all
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.120]  the ceo's and people together with government and then government people do watch c span to actually
[50:19.120 --> 50:23.680]  know what's going on you can learn incredible things from there and now they've built a technological
[50:23.680 --> 50:29.120]  grid under the department of defense in darpa that designed our highways in the fifties the entire
[50:29.120 --> 50:35.280]  system and now they have us dependent on the grid so they can start turning it off you understand
[50:35.280 --> 50:40.880]  how wicked this this master plan is oh yeah i got a little bit more on that well well well tell me
[50:40.880 --> 50:46.240]  what they said uh on the piece i i saw blurbs a month ago or three weeks ago on it but i didn't
[50:46.240 --> 50:52.400]  look into it deeply pastor tell us more than john chris james john and others if you want to support

[54:25.920 --> 54:33.040]  oil shortage simulation on c-span go ahead yeah basically there's a bunch of bush cronies in his
[54:33.040 --> 54:39.360]  administration uh portraying obama's cronies in their administration which is no difference but
[54:39.360 --> 54:46.000]  uh they basically dealt with the credit downgrade uh they talked about uh hit on this oil processing
[54:46.000 --> 54:53.440]  plant trying to link it to how the cia ate us and uh stuff like that and uh basically just uh they
[54:53.440 --> 54:58.800]  had gnn the global news network and everything portrayed it while they sat there and portrayed
[54:58.800 --> 55:05.040]  it in segment uh pretty interesting it really shows them really pretty much admitting what's
[55:05.040 --> 55:13.280]  about to take place this fall uh other quick point to london uh if you read second has run apocrypha
[55:13.280 --> 55:19.760]  it talks about in chapter 15 16 for there shall be tradition among men and invading one another
[55:19.760 --> 55:24.640]  they shall not regard their kings nor princes in the course of their actions they'll stand in their
[55:24.640 --> 55:31.920]  power and uh just a whole uh chapter of 15 uh second has her talks about the whole middle east
[55:32.560 --> 55:38.480]  the rights that are about to take place globally and uh the last and final point i'd like to make
[55:38.480 --> 55:45.520]  is i know you guys are pretty educated you and anderson and bob Chapman and them talking about
[55:45.520 --> 55:51.120]  gold and silver but i just want to give you a critical thing to think about uh the bible also
[55:51.120 --> 55:56.320]  says they will throw their gold and jewels out in the streets and beat themselves on the head right
[55:57.120 --> 56:03.280]  well no not not necessarily you know that's in uh original in the old testament but i and second
[56:03.280 --> 56:10.720]  answer it talks about uh to be its pilgrims as mirrors don't occupy merchant dice because
[56:10.720 --> 56:15.920]  strangers will reap the fruits spoil the goods overthrow the houses and captain family show
[56:15.920 --> 56:22.320]  it listen i pastor i appreciate your call we need to try to make good financial decisions so that
[56:22.320 --> 56:28.080]  we're not poor and so the system can control us i mean you want to get into christians aren't supposed
[56:28.080 --> 56:36.480]  to be doing well uh what about uh the prodigal son what about abraham i mean it just i you know my
[56:36.480 --> 56:42.080]  whole issue here is it's good to give people advice on gold and they've done very very well
[56:42.080 --> 56:48.320]  with that uh thank you though john in texas you're on the air welcome hi elix hi welcome
[56:49.360 --> 56:52.800]  you know i want to talk about these weather weapons elix right now i think we're under all
[56:52.800 --> 56:58.080]  out attack i mean we've had record floods rugged carnados rugged storms right now we're in the
[56:58.080 --> 57:03.120]  middle of a drought in texas has burned us through a crisp well if we pay all gore some money he'll make
[57:03.120 --> 57:10.640]  it stop but right now nobody wants to talk about it i mean ring you know no pro well they do they do
[57:10.640 --> 57:16.800]  have i mean over in dubai they've they've put up the different harp systems that's uh daily mail
[57:16.800 --> 57:21.680]  associated press will you guys put up uh dubai turning the desert green it'll show the antenna
[57:21.680 --> 57:26.880]  farms that when the water comes across they hit it and make it turn into condensation and rain
[57:26.880 --> 57:31.440]  they're turning the desert green with that so yes the u.s government that developed all this
[57:31.440 --> 57:36.800]  could be making it rain right now bill gates has patented a bunch about he's obsessed with it
[57:37.440 --> 57:41.280]  i don't know if they're currently causing this drought we had a really bad drought in the 50s
[57:41.280 --> 57:48.800]  here in texas but it is an incredible drought i mean it's like living here in austin you go outside
[57:48.800 --> 57:54.000]  it's not like the desert there's like dead trees everywhere and dead grass everywhere and it just
[57:54.000 --> 57:59.920]  looks like some apocalyptic world and it's only getting worse we got two more months of incredible
[57:59.920 --> 58:04.560]  heat but i remember being a kid in dallas and it being 112 degrees so three four days in a row at
[58:04.560 --> 58:09.920]  107 and by the way the guys found the article for prison planet dot tv viewers if you scroll up
[58:09.920 --> 58:16.400]  you'll be able to see the antenna arrays um anything else uh on that front john yeah i was up in uh
[58:16.400 --> 58:23.120]  michigan in uh at the end of june and uh we had a uh rendus rainstorm and when it was over with my
[58:23.120 --> 58:27.040]  mother's house looked like it was sitting in the middle of the lake and she's 82 when she told me
[58:27.040 --> 58:30.720]  she said i'd never seen this happen before and i said mommy better hang on to your heck because
[58:30.720 --> 58:35.120]  it's going to get a whole lot worse it is and the globalists will say pay us a global carbon
[58:35.120 --> 58:48.080]  tax we'll make it all go away we'll be right back this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:49.760]  issues for the store to address and this month's video there was a guy in it uh and uh he's voicing
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:54.800]  over the thing and he says if you see someone purchasing unusual amounts of some materials
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:02.000]  such as a bag of fertilizer propane acids pipes pipe caps and timers contact the manager immediately
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.120]  in the video it's a large it's portraying a large black man with tattoos purchasing these products
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:14.720]  and a week before she told me this uh in our local newspaper they published this article about
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:20.960]  supposedly harmless bomb control operations uh here in our small town where they did it on a
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:26.000]  second floor of a shuttered warehouse and uh had a robot in there with a pipe bomb sitting on top of
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.560]  a beam uh 20 bomb tech officers doing different scenarios of uh it's called alice training alert
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.280]  lockdown informed counter really what it is is federalization training they sell them on this
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.640]  narrative then the narrative becomes gun owners uh and people like that and it's all about creating
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:48.720]  this illusion that there's really all these bombs going off yeah exactly and and it just i saw the
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.920]  two two stories kind of correlate together and i saw through the illusion that you know these these
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:59.120]  bomb controls are really for us that we're going to go to home depot make fertilizer bombs when we
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.520]  get fed up and we've had enough and uh they're they're ready for it and they're they're letting

[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:44.240]  it's so twitter refused to shut down the accounts of people actually calling for crimes and violence
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:50.800]  individually so now you see everybody gets to have their basic rights taken for no reason
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:56.080]  that's why they let terrorist attack us that's why they finance terrorist to attack us that's why
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:01.440]  corporation stage terror attacks government has been caught over and over again doing it
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:07.920]  and then you're looked at like you're crazy or you're somehow bad if you point out that government
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:15.120]  stands to gain from terror as a pretext to take our liberties also feds sin terrorist hand out
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.520]  to military surplus stores curtain emma's got an article on that we'll tell you more about what that
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:28.480]  means that's right they're saying that you're basically a terrorist if you go to the army
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:35.200]  surplus store amazon disarms brits by banning self-defense items like baseball bats because
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.760]  record sales of baseball bats were made in england predominantly over amazon with people
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:47.280]  seeking to defend themselves now that's just some of the news as well also the videos are being
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:54.560]  released from chicago and milwaukee and other areas and they are showing that many of these
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:10:01.760]  are racial attacks that are happening and people are so politically correct that you're not supposed
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:07.360]  to talk about the fact that there is some uptick in black on white violence we need to ask why is
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:15.680]  that happening we need to point out that that's wrong just like when white gangs from time to
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:22.160]  time have attacked ribs of black people it needs to be decried just like the mayor of philadelphia
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:27.760]  said who is black he came out and said it was wrong but if you won't criticize it and the police
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:34.080]  won't do anything about it it will get out of control i'll guarantee you can go find white
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:38.560]  gangs in america that if they were allowed to go out and beat up black people they would go out and
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:46.720]  do it see if it's seen as okay to attack a certain group it's done that's why for decades gays have
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:54.800]  have been quote rolled all over the country folks will go to areas where gays congregate and beat
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:00.640]  them and rob them because well they're gay so they deserve to be attacked and that's why they
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:06.720]  call for hate crime laws well no if you just enforce the law that assaulting anyone is a
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.760]  serious crime if it's not in self-defense you don't need a thought crime law but see under
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:17.760]  political correctness if you attack a quote protected group then they throw the book at you
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:23.280]  but if it's blacks attacking whites then nothing's done and it's being green lighted
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.200]  and so now that's being confirmed i want to get into that a little bit more later
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:39.520]  also continuing with some of the news here we've got incredible financial news coming out trade
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:46.960]  deficit sores to highest since 2008 jobless 395 thousand last week updated to 420 thousand
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:54.240]  it is absolutely incredible what's happening right now and it's all the info wars dot com
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:01.680]  present planet dot com and also drudge report dot com now i wanted to spend a segment or two
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:06.720]  with our next guest and we've got his video posted at info wars dot com if you're a radio
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:11.680]  listener we're going to play some of it here in a moment for audio listeners to hear it but
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:18.640]  also for viewers at present planet dot tv to see it danie penzela is an example of someone
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:26.480]  actually targeting the real criminals not going and burning down a warehouse or a furniture store
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:32.640]  not carjacking someone but actually going and peacefully protesting the private
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:38.560]  federal reserve parasite in new york city and that's why it's come out now that the pentagon
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:44.960]  homeland security is watching and tracking anyone that criticizes the federal reserve as a chilling
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:52.160]  effect and deploying police and even military in some cases at in the fed peaceful rallies this
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:13:00.160]  goes back three years we cover it in my film the obama deception danie a few days before he went
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:08.880]  down there called for a protest at the new york fed now because he's a activist who has a small
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:17.040]  site it didn't get a big response he was the only person an army of one who showed up with
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:25.840]  his child in the baby's trailer and he walked up and they had police every five feet you can
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:33.920]  watch the video at info wars.com in the 9 11 section in the banking section in fact i forget
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:40.400]  what section it's in um here's the headline if you want to find it police surround new york
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:47.680]  federal reserve after in the fed flash mom facebook post danie penzela true squad tv
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:58.560]  so that's how you can find it right there now this is an example of how all over the united
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:06.720]  states la riots katrina examples decades ago or just five years ago you will see the police
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:12.400]  not show up the military not show up when it's a big political event they're ordered to stand down
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.320]  now if you're being mugged at your house cops a lot of times show up really quick sometimes they
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:22.560]  can't that's why you need a second minute to defend yourself but the issue here is that
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:29.680]  when it's the federal reserve the real criminal fraudster hijacker owners of america they do
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.000]  show up and and it's an incredible image of the giant federal reserve building in new york
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.840]  built like a fortress with giant bars on the windows had police every five feet all the way
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:47.760]  around it and danie comes up and says why are you here and they say oh there was going to be a
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.720]  flash mom but nobody showed up and then danie laughs and goes ahead and hands out as flyers
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:59.520]  so the issue is this is the real establishment this is who needs to be identified not their
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:04.800]  puppet obama not their puppet mint romney their puppet george w bush james cameron
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:13.040]  murkel baroso room p we need to talk about the real criminals the people that have engineered
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:19.040]  this global collapse to re-engineer society danie i i've got to salute what you did because it
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.160]  turned into a big deal online hundreds of thousands have seen it watched it you failed
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:30.560]  in getting anybody to show up but you succeeded by stepping up to the plate and so you won
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:36.080]  resistance is victory and you illustrated how scared to death they are a peaceful people
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:41.440]  simply protesting the real power and it shows it is the real power that if you're you know if
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:47.040]  you're going to protest uh or or going to burn somebody's shop cops don't show up but if you
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:52.720]  go to peacefully protest the real criminals they do absolutely thank god that was a great
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:59.200]  introduction yeah i mean i think it's interesting that um the police when i got there um i walked
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.600]  right up to them i shook their hands i introduced myself i said i'm the flash mob you guys are
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.080]  waiting for and they laughed it off because they thought i was trying to get rid of them so that
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:13.520]  the real mob could show up uh you know they just were expecting some kind of violent mob and i even
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:18.240]  said to them i said you know this guy this is a fortress here how could you how would you even
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:24.720]  be worried about it did all this police response to uh facebook post is just it's silly well you
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:30.320]  notice that building was built what in the 20s it is a fortress and all their buildings have
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:35.840]  moats around them or giant walls the one in dallas has parapets around it i mean they've
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.080]  been getting ready for what they've shut up for a long time that's why they're armored fortresses
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:47.200]  absolutely absolutely and you know i think that the big issue here for me being a new yorker uh
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:53.520]  obviously the fed and the third reserve system is a big issue for the whole country uh but the fact
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:58.560]  that they're using the nypd you know they have their own uh federal reserve police but now they're
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:05.040]  using the nypd and it's funny that the one of the either lieutenant captain had said to me uh yeah
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.600]  you know uh some people they want to get their money's worth so i'm curious who exactly he meant
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.680]  by that was that the federal reserve looking to get their money's worth was that the federal
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:21.920]  government who we know uh gives grants to the nypd to implement their policies uh the nypd has
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:27.600]  hired rand corporation to develop policies for them so i'm curious exactly who he meant i mean i
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.720]  guess it's all the same in the end well we know crime has exploded in new york and other areas
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:38.160]  and i see reports all the time about women raped mugged in broad daylight and even nice areas the
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.680]  police won't come you know the police should be in central park dealing with crime but you notice
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:49.120]  they're always there getting in the face of peaceful political demonstrations and this really
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:55.600]  illustrates these are the owners of america and that's why they were there yeah absolutely it's uh
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:01.520]  it's really uh it was grateful and you know the um daily news reported yesterday that i don't know
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:07.040]  if you saw this yet that the nypd has unveiled its social networking task force where they're
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:13.680]  going to be monitoring uh social networking as well so here we have i was able to break this story
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:17.520]  about a month early before the police admitted it that they're actually and we know that this is
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:23.120]  under federal directive well absolutely i did see the report but but really what's happening here
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:27.120]  illustrated by twitter refusing to shut down accounts that we're saying let's meet and burn
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:33.600]  this down let's meet and rob these people clearly criminal activity the police have a direct line
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.920]  to the ip address where to go arrest them doing nothing the police say oh we stood down but for
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:45.520]  four days but will you shut these people down twitter says no so david cameron comes out today
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:53.040]  and says we want a total kill switch now over twitter just like egypt used and so now they'll
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.760]  selectively do it when it's their political mob that al gore called for an arab spring
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:03.920]  they'll be left alone but when it's us using it peacefully will be shut down yeah absolutely and
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:09.200]  what does this do this really has a chilling effect on free speech and freedom of assembly
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.720]  you know there might be people that will see these types of things and that's why i really
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:18.160]  wanted to illustrate in my my video that if you just go when you form a report with the police
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.520]  and you kind of just show them that you're not a threat you're no physical threat you're just there
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.800]  to educate people then that will counteract what the system is trying to do because i don't want
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:32.080]  people to be intimidated by the fact that uh you know they're they're doing this and then not show up
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:36.880]  to a protest well that's right they're trying to sell the idea that protesting is burning looting and
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:41.600]  killing and that's why they stood down in london stood down in seattle when their hired thugs
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:47.040]  got the party started i want to come back and talk to you about picking today tomorrow whatever's good
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:53.600]  for you i'm ready to try to help you let's get 500 a thousand people down there for a real event

[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.200]  why is it so many people suffer from so many illnesses today why don't doctors know how to
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:09.680]  help you could it be that our doctors don't know how because there's a nutrition solution
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:15.760]  and they only know about drugs over 68 diseases are known to be connected to a deficiency of glutathione

[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:56.160]  this little facebook hosting and by little i'm not belittling and i'm saying that's how big things
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:02.640]  start like luke redalsky literally had almost no support no followers came on this show he was
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.440]  oppressed by the police threatened people witnessed it so they went and supported him and now hundreds
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:13.200]  of groups worldwide educating folks and i hope that's what comes out of this going down there with his
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:19.920]  young son danie panzela thank you so much for what you've done folks can watch the full video again
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:27.280]  at truth squad tv or at info wars dot com but i hope to see at least 200 300 people spontaneously
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:33.120]  join you down there tomorrow at four uh any final comments yeah you know i wanted to mention the
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:38.160]  compartmentalization that you could see with the cops as i approached each one and they had different
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:43.200]  ranks one guy had no idea why he was there the other guy thought it was a drill and then finally
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.600]  the lieutenant was the one who actually knew uh you know what was going on so you could just see
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:53.200]  how they use the the compartmentalization to keep the police uh going forward with with a
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:58.480]  an agenda that's clearly unconstitutional well they certainly do and it's that very
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:02.800]  federal reserve that's the consortium for the megabanks that are destroying those officers
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.440]  future and the value of their dollar i mean there are the criminals and there's a great example
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:13.040]  of compartmentalization with the police there in mass protecting their kings earlier in the video
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.040]  if we can back it up and find the spot and just show the image for prison planet dot tv viewers
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:23.360]  radio listeners can go watch it on the websites truth squad tv and info wars dot com uh but if you
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.080]  watch the video what about every five feet there's a cop stationed all the way around the building
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:34.480]  yeah yeah they were they were all around all four blocks i walked i it's not in the video but i walked
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:40.080]  all four blocks around the fed and they were surrounding the whole building yeah in some
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:45.680]  areas the video looks like every five feet in other areas about every 15 uh but just incredible
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:51.680]  how many police total hundreds i would say they were probably about 40 spanning the whole the whole
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:56.560]  four blocks four blocks surrounding well you know they'll be out there tomorrow

[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:08.160]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:13.360]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:18.240]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:23.520]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is

[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:55.440]  got it basically boiled down and programmed as they say for the nightly show uh the crew has
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:01.600]  been staying i'd say two three nights a week until 10 or later uh we're all very tired and
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:08.880]  we're really dedicating ourselves to this because we realize uh how how serious how serious the times
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:13.120]  are we live in and that it's just going to get crazier from here on out as i've been warning you
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:23.440]  that said um i have gotten very tired and i need to take off three or four days before i
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:29.440]  launch the tv show so i can really be crisp for it also after years and years of broadcasting
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:35.040]  and screaming and going to rallies my voice is tired i've never experienced where my voice itself
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:41.920]  it's it's it's hard to speak sometimes um and i hope people will will will will will bear with me on
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:48.000]  that i cannot go to rallies anymore where you're not allowed to have a bullhorn and scream for
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:54.240]  two three hours at the top of my lungs uh or i'll lose my voice i've never gone to a speech coach
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:38:01.360]  i've never gone to a um i've never gone to a speech therapist i've never had my larynx checked
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:06.480]  i know i've screamed so loud before that i've coughed up blood uh and lacerated my larynx
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:15.040]  and uh so i've got to stop um and i am extremely tired right now i feel completely drained i'm
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:23.040]  not complaining uh it's just that um i'm going to run a rebroadcast sunday and i'm going to try to
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:32.720]  just sleep and exercise and read and try to reset uh because um i've got to rest a little before what's
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:40.400]  coming uh the problem is every subject every news item i want to cover it every issue has hundreds
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:47.520]  of angles to it i want to try to relay my analysis or impart my information and i do realize that i've
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:53.200]  got to uh pace myself because it's not the the rabbit that wins the race it's the tortoise
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:02.480]  and we've done incredible things together but um folks can look at me until i'm tired uh i uh
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:11.360]  uh i am drained but i've taken week-long vacations before maybe once a year and i really do come back
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:17.520]  refreshed and i've got to take one uh i don't know what i'm going to do but i may the problem
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:21.760]  is so much is happening and then if there's news going on i don't end up resting and i'm calling
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:27.920]  into my own show and working and sending my reporters news and information uh they all need
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:33.120]  vacations as well uh we've tried to hire new people we've tried to find quality people and
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:37.040]  then that's a huge hassle as you know than training people i'm not complaining it's just
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:41.440]  going to the next level we know it's our responsibility and when i go to your calls please
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:48.560]  don't thank me and and don't don't uh don't say oh alex you know take time off i i i just tend to
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:54.000]  sometimes talk off the top of my head and really just tell you what i'm believing and what i'm thinking
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:08.320]  uh but i again at five o'clock today i'm going to have unlimited energy it's like weird once i get
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:15.040]  burnout i have explosions of energy and then can't stop working and then i have no energy and it's
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:22.480]  like a instead of just a good even keeled continual energy that i've always had until the last year or
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:29.680]  so um and i i i'll take vitamins i'll take minerals and suddenly i'll have energy and then i'll
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.680]  forget to take the shakes i'll forget to take the minerals like i've done for the last two weeks
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:39.840]  and then i'll get exhausted so uh that's an issue there as well but we really are bashing our brains
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.840]  out around here and working our fingers to the bone uh to fight the globalist and and and you can see
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:50.800]  the result of it thanks for all of you spreading the word about the broadcast and just the incredible
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:56.240]  job you've done and i'm so thankful to all of our AM and FM affiliates i'm so thankful to all of our
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:03.040]  sponsors i'm so thankful to my great crew uh and the work that they're doing uh we couldn't do any of
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:11.760]  this any of this uh without you and i think of how exhausting it is to really be informed and really
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:17.440]  be well researched and i and then i because of the research i know that we're going to look back on
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:21.280]  this time as i said a year ago i said a year from now you'll look back on all the crazy stuff
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:28.480]  happening and this will seem tame and we'll look back a year from now on august 11 of the 2011
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:33.840]  and we will think it was a cakewalk a tea party uh a uh walk in the park
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:42.080]  and i just if people would just wake up to the globalist this nightmare can be turned around
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:47.600]  and i have faith people are going to wake up the problem is the social engineers know you're waking
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:53.360]  up and know you've woken up so they've put a very serious control grid in place uh to try to
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:59.840]  block us and if anybody questions that and doesn't know history just watch the dramas and sitcoms
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:06.320]  it is laced with anti-freedom messages it is laced with demonization of people that are awake
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:14.480]  and my heart shudders not in fear but with disgust at what we're going to have to go through
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:22.320]  and i think that's another reason that i have such a weight on me now is that decade ago i hated
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:27.520]  the globalist and it was a warm fire and the last 10 years i do what i do for love
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:38.960]  and just the darkness and the endless energy and the enjoyment of evil that the globalist exhibit
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:51.760]  disgust me and it's it's it's almost like a curse to um to know the mind of the globalist
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:43:01.600]  and to just wish that people could wake up spend time and discover that i'm not lying to you
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:10.080]  discover that in fact it's worse than i can even tell you everyone should have a fire in their
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:17.280]  belly a burning driving animating desire to resist thugs bullies and scum of every permutation
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:21.840]  all right i said to go to your calls i do need to thank the sponsors as well that also make the

[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:06.320]  much for taking my call thanks for calling buddy what's on your mind well um first I gotta thank
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:10.640]  my wife Lettie for turning me on to the show she found your show about seven or eight months ago
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:17.600]  and we've been listening ever since really awesome um secondly I want to speak about um a story that
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:26.400]  hits close to home and that's the awesome raw food raid um I wanted to uh see if you would address
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:33.440]  the other side of the story and um just all the the back story there's a whole another side of the
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:38.800]  story that hasn't been addressed by Mike Adams or yourself and I was really the point is they're
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:46.000]  raiding dairies too I mean you can go to Whole Foods website type in Whole Foods uh raw milk cheese
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.280]  and they'll on their fact sheet they go of course it's legal most of our cheese is raw milk cheese
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:58.720]  and all it means is non-pasteurized uh and uh it means it's real cheese and they they went
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:05.280]  after them for watermelons they went after them for um papayas and it's just a public store of a
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:10.480]  private private group they have them here in Austin where you own part of a cow or a whole
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:15.600]  cow at a farm and it's mainly highly educated folks that are doing it and I wish I had the
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.160]  time and energy to truly be healthy I know all this information but don't actually practice at all
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:27.280]  I'm trying to get to the point of where I do that but but but enlighten me John what is it that
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:34.160]  that that we're not covering well the fact that uh according to the newest court documents um
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:40.000]  they've got thousands of dollars worth of meat and eggs that were bought from commercial non-organic
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.360]  sources and they're repacked in it and selling it as organic and the story's been going on for a
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:51.040]  while I've been following it for about 10 months or so because I was looking in to get some uh
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:56.880]  organic meat from my family what really what's your what's your John send me send me information
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:01.680]  who you are so I can look that up because Mike Adams warned me about some stuff that the feds
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:06.800]  are up to and and I kind of heard it in the tone of your voice from the beginning uh do they deserve
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:11.840]  to have their money confiscated their watermelons confiscated uh no no hold on just a minute I'm
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:16.800]  done with you send me who you are and and then we and maybe we'll have you on with your full name
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:21.440]  and who you are in your whole background and proof I want you to send me some proof of that
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:26.480]  because the feds in their affidavits are alleging they were selling raw milk and raw cheese and uh
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:33.920]  watermelons and things and it was a private co-op and so so I mean I remember
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.640]  on so many cases whenever people are being persecuted or arrested that there'll be this
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:46.400]  narrative put out uh that oh well they were really bad and deserved it and uh I don't see any proof
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:51.520]  of that and Mike Adams warned me off air about this and I trust Mike and I saw some of the information
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:57.360]  so thanks a lot John you had to folks deserve a hundred thirty thousand dollar bond for selling
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:03.920]  tomatoes uh let me guess I bet that woman up in Michigan growing tomatoes facing 93 days in jail
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:08.960]  when there was no law maybe maybe maybe she was doing something bad uh maybe the lady who got
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:13.920]  arrested for trying to speak at city council maybe she deserved him maybe the mayor deserved it
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:20.960]  to be fired by the by the police chief I mean this this just goes on and on and on so I want to
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:25.120]  not just have an anonymous call on something like that I want your proof send it to show tips
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:30.400]  and info wars.com I want photographs I want documentation I want proof we know that raid
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:34.320]  happened we know they're raiding Amish all over the country we know they're raiding people selling
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:39.520]  pecans on the side of the road we know they're trying to pass codex elementarius and a total
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:45.360]  shutdown of people selling peaches and the feds always have got some some cockamamie story they
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:51.840]  put out yeah yeah bunch of you just hear it in the voice reading off that piece of paper I could

[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:02.000]  Illinois Michael you're on the air go ahead. Thanks a lot Alex uh I hear your sentiment's
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:08.080]  exactly regarding the uh the food uh so I'm here in Chicago um yeah why don't they raid the big

[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:30.480]  Illinois coming after your guns you're going over the void registration card where they have to
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:37.040]  authorize you as the slave you pay the tax to the mafia controllers to maybe have a gun that is if
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:44.320]  you live outside chicago please continue absolutely so in the course of pursuing this void case i
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:51.840]  came across the 89th general assembly it was a may 4th 1995 and he had a senator hendon who lived
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:55:00.160]  in one of the reffer district and he was lobbying you know for i guess with concealed carry but just
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:07.680]  i came across some astounding information just related to gun gun shipments so if i could read
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:14.160]  this very quickly he basically says if you hadn't had the stick up man put a gun to your head and
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:18.880]  then when you call a police the police say we can't be everywhere we can't be everywhere what are you
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:23.760]  going to do all we're trying to do is give the law-abiding citizens of this state a fighting chance
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:28.880]  a fighting chance that's it let me tell you or let you let you in on a little story and i'll be
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:34.400]  through they had a government shipment federal government coming through chicago west side of
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:39.360]  chicago the trains just happened to break down in the back of rockwell and if they're referring to
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:45.600]  rockwell gardens which is a housing project now senator dukes or duchess might know about this
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:50.320]  the train just happened to break down behind the public housing building the vice lord just
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:56.240]  happened to know which trains to go to to get the ak-47s and hand grenades they just happened to know
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:01.040]  if you believe that i want to sell you the old state capital building over there somebody told
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:05.600]  them because the crux are going to get the guns and the crux are on every level of government
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:11.520]  as well as out there on the street um so it it goes on but this is actually in the congressional
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.720]  i want to stop you because as i've said for a hundred years the feds have been arming the
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:22.720]  criminals to knock out their competition every vice is megabank run they're the real mafia
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:28.640]  only reason we know about organized crime was because the italians got too uppity with the
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:34.320]  wasp and jewish mob and had to be slapped down in the fifties and of course before that the head
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:39.600]  of the fbi said no organized crime existed just like they say the government isn't involved in
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:46.800]  terror today we have fast and furious caught shipping the guns into mexico drugs back alpaso
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:56.000]  times chicago tribune shipping guns as i said in illinois uh miami now the atf fbi dea all involved
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.640]  and yes i've talked to people that work for railroads and they say that there was always
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:05.600]  inside jobs uh even in dalis in places they would order the train to stop they would look the other
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:10.720]  way and then criminals would rob it including arm shipments the police were involved as well
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:14.880]  and i've talked to folks again who worked on the major railroad going in and out of dalis that's
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:20.080]  where i grew up and i had some family that worked on the railroad i'll just leave it at that in fact
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:23.280]  i had family basically had to get out of it because they got threatened because they weren't going to
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:28.080]  be part of it but the yes mafia runs everything the government runs everything the government is
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:36.160]  mafia i want to put you on hold this is big news because we can say in 95 uh state legislature
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:42.960]  you know legislature record uh you know government ship guns to gangs or something like that

[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:39.920]  we're looking into the illinois legislative session 89 it looks like jaren's found it
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:44.800]  very interesting to be heard the last caller about talk of the government arming the gangs
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:52.160]  then uh back in the mid 1990s wouldn't be the first time i remember la times the feds letting
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:01:02.400]  3000 ak-47s go free uh in long beach to the gangs man this just goes on and on i i just remembered
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:10.480]  that i have the la times that's actually in my first film america destroyed by design 1997
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:17.680]  the more i think about it how the government arms the criminals the select criminals to knock out
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:23.920]  their competition andrew in illinois pretty wild news from illinois my friend that reminds me of
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:29.760]  the during the clinton administration they seized a uh container shipment of ak-47s from china
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:34.160]  and they're no more worried about what they did with it uh actually that that was it that was
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:40.320]  long beach uh the the report was it made its way to drug gangs but here's the last call about his harp
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:48.080]  now harp is used to um manipulate storm cells you heard you know us you know storms be called
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:53.760]  cells because they have a positive and a negative side to them they can push these storm cells over
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:58.960]  any area or pull them to any area using harp plus they can heat the air up over them to give them
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:04.240]  physical energy or they can add energy i got some i'm trying to find more about adding injury to the
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:12.560]  storm but they admit there's all sorts of ionizing towers that can manipulate the weather that's a
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:17.360]  mainstream news now so much of this stuff that was science fiction has now admitted that it's
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:24.560]  been going on uh behind the scenes andrew ours is many harp by the way they're starting to test
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:29.120]  that out using this uh well i'm talking to a guy that works at a university of texas research
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:35.680]  facility and that's all i'm allowed to say well actually he's called in before i've known him
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:40.720]  personally for 12 years his first name steve and i'll just leave it at that in fact steve if you
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:46.160]  could ever get me a note i'd like to have you on as a guest without saying your last name but he has
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:53.280]  witnessed um he says that the doppler radar facilities many of them are a cover just like
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:58.400]  they have a camp within a camp at camp x-ray they'll have a real doppler radar system and then right
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:03.120]  next to it they'll have another array that they claim is under federal control that he claims is a
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:09.840]  harp antenna to manipulate weather and i remember him telling me this 10 years ago and he gave me
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:16.080]  a lot of good info but i'd still kind of roll my eyes now the exact arrays he was trying to show me
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:21.200]  diagrams of or what are in the daily mail with uh dubai saying they can control the weather looks
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:27.520]  just like them and uh it's just i can't handle it anymore i mean we're living in total crazy land
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:31.360]  there's a giant military industrial complex it's gotten away with whatever it wants to do
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:35.840]  they think they're god they're playing god they've got all sorts of life extension systems we're
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:40.560]  never going to get a hold of the general public's completely slobbering and dumbed down you know
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:46.240]  those that aren't awake are that way folks that are awake uh i don't know what we're going to do
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:53.280]  but anything else uh andrew yes uh also if people still have a uh television you know the old kind
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:59.920]  of antenna it's called a weller method you turn your tv to uh channel two and you uh take it a
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:04.400]  little bit off the channel and all that and you'll see the sparkles as a tornado producing
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.080]  storm approaches it will cause the screen to go white then you know what it for sure hit
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:13.120]  storm solver outside of the weather telling you well actually i was going back 65 70 years ago i
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:19.520]  saw where some of the first devices were tv tubes that weathermen would use to like track things that
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:24.240]  was some of the early warning systems was uh television tubes that they manipulated i've
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:29.440]  actually read that channel two is what you go on to use to get an antenna the old-fashioned
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:34.320]  kind not cable or satellite but have it on a tv antenna and channel two and then you adjust your
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:39.840]  uh the contrast a lot to see sparkles on your screen but then when that tornado producing

[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:06.960]  these the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:15.120]  okay your phone calls on a host of issues are coming up i'm gonna get to more of what's happening
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:21.120]  right now in the stock market the admission that yes we're going into a depression basically we're
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:26.960]  gonna be breaking all of that down today but there's a guy i really wanted to get on air because
[02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:33.280]  i don't know for a year and a half or so maybe longer now he has been airing my radio show on
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:41.680]  one of his radio stations live and then on the other one um he has been um replaying it on night
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:48.240]  and he has me up against rush limbaugh on his other other station he has a long bio but he is
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:54.160]  certainly a very interesting character and he's he's the model of local broadcasting that we had
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:09:01.040]  in the fifties sixties and seventies that's all dying out that's that's going away and the big
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:07.200]  majors will come in for two three years sell advertising for five dollars a spot to bankrupt
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:12.960]  all their competition then buy them up and i'm not for monopolies you know we've seen the big three
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:19.760]  out there now the big two um a decade ago or so couldn't own you know more than a certain amount
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:26.240]  of stations in each market now it's basically unlimited and it's destroyed local diversity
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:31.280]  on local radio at a time that we really really need it that's why i've encouraged citizen journalists
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:37.040]  to start their own local news shows their own local newspapers and and there's been a birth of those
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:46.240]  but there's nothing like the professionals from broadcast am and fm u h f v h f many of them now
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:52.880]  bagging groceries many of them mowing lawns many of them teaching sunday school uh or or or public
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:57.680]  school many of these incredible talents i mean remember growing up in dallas you go through
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:04.000]  the dial and just there here's so many interesting personalities local news and most stations don't
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:08.960]  even do that now or they just regurgitate uh national news but michael's whirling when i've
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:14.640]  been out uh in the area that he lives in uh in california santa cruz and surrounding areas
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:20.320]  you talk about a wide diversity of local shows he's only got really i guess a few syndicated
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:25.440]  uh that he carries and i'm honored to be one of them but i wanted to get michael on because
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:32.160]  when i went to talkers he was there uh and i of course went out and spoke uh to the kscl listeners
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:37.920]  at two events that were sell out crowds 900 uh at each event in fact somewhere above 900 it was
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:44.880]  capacity standing room only both nights and i was asking you me on the decades and decades you've
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:52.000]  owned this station how have you survived and thrived when other stations and programmers
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:59.280]  and most cases cannot figure out how to do it and michael's been extremely successful and the model
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:05.920]  he went with is basically similar to our model i sell books i sell videos i sell water filters
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:11.280]  i have a a a a retail store so i have my own products and i tell listeners i think these are
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:15.520]  really good products these are really good films good t-shirts spread the word if you believe in
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:20.800]  what we're doing buy these if you like this broadcasting vote with your dollars i also tell
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:25.840]  i also tell folks support your local amnf affiliate if you're listening to the show there sponsor them
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:33.280]  if you're a local uh business owner or support those local sponsors let them know i'm buying my
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:38.160]  tile from you or my carpet from you or my car from you or i'm going to your restaurant because
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:43.680]  you're on this local station that kerry shows i believe in there's a reason the white house
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:47.280]  is openly saying they want to shut down talk radio and free speech and want internet kill
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:54.960]  switches because it's a place you can call into talk radio is a long form format and so we can take
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:12:00.880]  little stories from around the country or overseas and show a pattern we can break that regional news
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:07.760]  control but if you don't have local radio there's no way for it ever to get out to you unless you
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:12.560]  have to be listening to a show like this one but when i was out in ksco they said you know
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:18.320]  they're making the local famous uh apple juice place put fluoride in their apple juice now
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:21.920]  and i said yes i've seen that and ended up talking to folks that are involved in apple
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:26.800]  production that work at the station i was they were saying and you're aware of the carbon
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:32.320]  taxes going in and yes i was aware of california issues but see i can cover that sometimes but
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:38.480]  local they're the folks that can organize people politically to stand up for themselves and that
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:45.200]  is not what the establishment wants so amongst other things i brought michael's whirling on the
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:55.840]  day for a message directly to am and fm broadcast license owners managers program directors to
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:13:01.200]  listen to the model your radio station shouldn't just be selling coffee mugs and t-shirts you
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:06.080]  should have bookstores you should have all your hosts doing youtube videos and and plugging your
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:11.040]  online stream i mean i'm going to give you some of my information that seems common sense to some
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:17.120]  but but but not to others and then swirling is going to give you some of his inside knowledge to
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:23.680]  help our radio stations but even if you're not uh picking up my radio broadcast or other great
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:28.400]  genesis shows or some of the shows that michael's whirling syndicates by the way through genesis
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:35.040]  that doesn't matter this is how you can really fund your radio station and then build it uh
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:41.760]  because mr's whirling zoom number one on his stations in his area in those key cities he's
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:46.720]  number one he's got shows many of them that are number one and he's done it against the big guys
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:51.760]  and this is the model you can't beat the big ad agencies blocking you out because you're on an
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:59.200]  insider you can't get at the table you can't do that there are ways to grow your station to a survive
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:05.840]  and then be grow and see thrive and dominate and this goes into alternative media it goes into
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:11.520]  so many things and so i hope that all the audience will stay with us as we cover it because this
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:16.800]  affects you and your capacity to call in the local radio your capacity to bring local host
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:24.480]  information your capacity to be a focal point talk radio is the electronic soap box and it
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:32.160]  talk radio pioneered the new media the systems that talk radio developed it's the oldest uh
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:38.080]  electronic media but it's also the newest of the old media and it's only talk radio that
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:44.880]  still has the giant audiences take coast to coast am most cities they have close to half or more
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:52.160]  of the combined total radio listening system uh take rush limbaugh 22 million listeners
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:58.800]  conservatively the biggest news shows now have a couple million talk radio is king and local talk
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:04.240]  radio needs to be king again and here i am a syndicated broadcaster telling you the inside
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:10.720]  baseball because i don't care about at the end of the day syndicated radio i care about truth
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:17.120]  and information and i started out obviously as a local access tv person in local community activism
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:22.480]  now michael's whirling is president and ceo's whirling broadcasting system ltd chairman and ceo

[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:38.000]  active vibrant news and information medium for monoray bay area established as ebs radio

[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:09.360]  for joining us today sir i can't believe it uh did i do all those things technology is absolutely
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:15.280]  incredible alexer have you have you been watching my my my face uh my facial expressions because
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:20.240]  we're on video skype absolutely you're here being simulcast at prison planet dot tv michael
[02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:24.320]  tell us about yourself you know i mean that magic in your eyes when you talk about being a little
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:29.760]  kid and first listening to ksco when you move there and all the doris day stories the clenny
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:34.960]  swood stories the ronald reagan stories i mean you're really an interesting guy but then also
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:41.840]  describe to people how you're able to not just survive but absolutely kick the big monopoly
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:49.840]  men's hind ends well in a nutshell it's called leveraging your audience traditionally alex
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:58.800]  what radio and television stations do is sell advertising time to businesses who want to reach
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:10.240]  the audience that the radio or tv station reaches okay and i don't know uh 14 15 years ago
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:16.160]  sort of by accident i stumbled upon a different way to do it and in fact i i should back up a
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:22.880]  little bit because i always wanted to own that particular station ksco am canadian sanikers
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:29.280]  when i was a youngster uh growing up it wasn't it wasn't a station that too many people would listen
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:35.520]  to um because uh too many young people would listen to because it was an old foggy music
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:40.400]  station you know they played monobony music and so forth but it was the only radio station that
[02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:46.320]  was in town so i used to hang out there as a kid and dream about being a dj there someday or better
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:51.680]  yet being a talk show host because we had this great radio station that was a trailblazer in
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:58.000]  the san francisco bay area called a go it's an amazing talk radio station at least it was for
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:03.760]  many many years now it's gone downhill and it's it's really very sad what's happening to a kgo
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:10.080]  and a lot of the other big stations the bigger they are the harder they fall but um uh so um
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:18.720]  in in the 1960s i had an opportunity to do the high school radio show time that was made available
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:25.280]  by the owner general manager of that radio of ksco the station that i now own and it was the most
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:32.640]  important thing in my life and one day after the um what i thought was the best program i and the
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:38.400]  high school staff had ever done the the manager walked in and said swirling you're through and i
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:44.160]  said why he says you don't make a fart noise on ksco fart noise it was a raspberry anyhow long
[02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:50.960]  story short i bowed right then and there uh on january fourth 1967 that someday i was going to
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:20:00.880]  own that station and turn it into a an amazing interactive communications vehicle and um and
[02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:08.960]  in 1991 what is that 24 years later i got that opportunity so we're celebrating our 20th year
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:18.080]  of uh being a voice for everyone uh in a in a media and an industry that seems to be going
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:23.440]  the opposite direction really really fast you know instead of serving local communities
[02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:29.360]  it seems to be shunning local communities as the big companies uh take over when i was able to
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:38.160]  acquire ksco in 1991 the rule at the time was only one am and one fm station could be owned by
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:45.840]  the same owner in a given market a year or two later it changed to two and two and in 1996 the
[02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:54.480]  communications act of 1996 that absolutely destroyed uh diversity and localism um in the
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:21:02.000]  united states of america made it possible as you said earlier in the intro that it's it's
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:08.640]  essentially limitless there is a limit but the limit is so high that uh one station one company
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:14.960]  or one entity can now own seven or eight or nine or ten stations and within the same community
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:21.200]  and dominate it it's just horrible it's totally destroyed everything anyhow um be careful what
[02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:26.160]  you wish for because in 1991 i got an opportunity to purchase the radio station that i always wanted
[02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:36.320]  to own uh did it uh and um and found that uh became it wasn't it wasn't uh it wasn't quite as fun uh
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:42.960]  owning the station and being responsible for payrolls and so forth um it was it wasn't the
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:48.800]  same as being a dj or a talk show host you're responsible for a lot of things and believe me
[02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:55.760]  tell me about it that's why i'm cheap chief cook a bottle washer everything and i got a great crew
[02:21:55.760 --> 02:22:01.360]  but it's still torture having to watch everything tell everybody what to do a lot of people want
[02:22:01.360 --> 02:22:06.080]  to be managers or bosses and believe me folks unless you're a control freak it's not fun
[02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:13.520]  all right well after uh after about six months by accident i don't know how i happened to find
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:19.200]  myself on a telephone conversation with a person a broadcaster a very successful broadcaster who
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:25.680]  it turned out right then i learned that he had been bidding against me from uh with the people
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:31.840]  that i ultimately bought the station from and i had won out and when he said that he he said you
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:36.880]  know i don't know i don't know how you could pay him to me it was a deal of a century that i i bought
[02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:42.960]  ksc04 but for him i overpaid and he says i don't know how you're gonna make money with that station
[02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:50.240]  but if you ever do i'm going to want to read your book well um i guess i'm ready to write the book
[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:56.480]  but it's going to be an awful short book it's only going to be two or three words leverage your
[02:22:56.480 --> 02:23:02.880]  audience if you have an audience that appreciates you and loves you like you do and like we do
[02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:12.800]  um if if you represent products that you either own or have a or a that's a distributor for or
[02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:19.360]  so for as long as you believe in those products the people who listen to you who believe in you
[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:24.560]  if you say buy these products try them out see if they work as well for you as they do for for me
[02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:29.360]  chances are they're going to do it and if you let them know that it's supporting the broadcast
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:34.160]  which is what you do and which is what we do amazing things happen and then all we've got to
[02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:41.280]  do morally is pick things to promote that we personally believe in gold silver high quality
[02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:46.560]  nutritional products the highest quality storeable food all i do is go out and find the best product
[02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:52.320]  then i promote it and then it's able to fund our message of liberty and freedom and free market
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:58.560]  and it wins wins wins and yeah i've seen radio stations now follow your model all over the
[02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:03.360]  country and they're the only ones that have been successful um you know there's a station in kansas
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:09.600]  city that sat us on i don't know for you know more than a decade that i know does that um as well
[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:16.400]  that's kcxl they they were even able to buy another station and upgrade it and and all this
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:21.680]  that's right by following that model so here we are literally giving people uh
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:29.840]  uh silver crosses for the big corporate vampires here if stations will listen to us but also
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:35.760]  listeners you've had a lot of listeners with the ungevity products with the info wars team.com
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:39.920]  system we've launched but but going back over a decade i hope you'll tell folks who've really
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:44.160]  been successful with this because i mean here's an example earlier in the show i felt absolutely
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:49.600]  horrible i hadn't eaten today i've been up since 6 30 i finally ate i feel great i know when i take
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:54.880]  the ungevity tangy tangerine or pollen burst that it gives me incredible energy i feel great
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:59.360]  but i'm such a workaholic i even forget to do that i forget to sleep so it's one thing to know all
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:06.000]  this i'm trying to put it into function it's the same thing for radio stations they need to go with
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:12.240]  the model that you've used to sustain themselves by promoting good products and turning themselves
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:17.280]  into the direct sellers and they can have advertising on top of it but the point is this
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:23.680]  is a system that will let the mom and pops but also the big independence not just survive but
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:30.640]  thrive so so so tell us about leveraging the audience and what it did for you uh well in
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:38.400]  in nine in 2001 uh the company that owned uh a i don't know if i mentioned names or i don't know
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:44.160]  if i should do that or not just give us the basics it doesn't matter yeah okay a company uh that uh
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:50.400]  that was the syndicator of a of our by far most listened to program which is a syndicated show
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:56.640]  decided to pull the plug on us not because we weren't doing a wonderful job and not because we
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:26:02.720]  weren't doing being being the best affiliate anybody could be but because that same company
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:09.440]  owned another station in our market and the but the manager of that station was complaining saying
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:16.240]  why in the world if we own the top syndicated talk radio property in the whole world should we allow
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:22.480]  our competitor that independent over in in Santa Cruz to carry that product when we are the owners
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:30.080]  of it and i guess he squawked enough to get the corporate people higher up to say oh okay we'll
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:36.640]  let you have it yeah so that makes sense i suppose and so they gave me the uh the uh uh uh legally
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:42.800]  required uh i think it was 90 day notification that uh you're going to be losing your affiliate
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:48.960]  status here and it's going to a competing station and i said okay look it's sort of like losing a
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:54.640]  lease if you don't own the property you know that's just like you know but i said it doesn't
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:27:00.320]  make any business sense at all to do what you're doing because you're going to be going from the
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:07.600]  station the the station with the strongest signal in the market am or fm bar none to a station with
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:12.880]  a pipsqueak signal just because it's owned by your same company that that doesn't make any business
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:16.480]  sense at all a lot of the people are not in the market aren't even going to be able to hear your
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:23.440]  program anymore and um they didn't listen to me they did it now under under ordinary circumstances
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:33.200]  that would have destroyed my station because taking such a huge chunk of our audience away
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:41.920]  and one fell swoop would have had devastating consequences but because i i was long into
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:49.120]  having discovered the leverage your audience uh a notion that i that i talked about we don't
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:57.280]  depend on the sale of advertising we we we developed a a residual compounding income
[02:27:57.280 --> 02:28:06.160]  that started in uh 1996 when i had this great idea uh about selling products uh to uh to our our
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:10.080]  listening audience they got to be good products or else they're not going to buy them again
[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:15.040]  a good salesperson can sell anybody anything wants but if it's not if it doesn't measure up
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:19.760]  if it doesn't do what it's supposed to do forget it well that's why ted's gone from probably you
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:25.680]  know in the 50th biggest gold broker and silver broker in the country to now number five because
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:31.040]  he gives great deals and he's been right so folks would be mad if i said buy gold when it was 300
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:36.560]  it's going to go up and it went down but it's gone up above 1800 so folks are like wow exactly my
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:41.520]  rule is if i buy it and i like it i promote it and let me tell you my family has had the
[02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:46.240]  ungevity stuff my wife is addicted to it it really is incredibly powerful and great and
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:51.680]  folks can by the way as individuals sign up and get a discount to be able to buy it even cheaper
[02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:58.160]  at info wars team dot com and the profit from it also goes to support our broadcast but then you
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:02.880]  can start selling it to your friends and family and this is just old-fashioned business or you
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:08.800]  can just buy the stuff at info wars team dot com and not sign up like cosco uh to get the discount
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:13.760]  but but getting back to this show they pull your big show so you launch your own syndicated show
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:17.920]  and and please continue i already had the syndicated show that's dead doctors don't lie
[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:24.800]  that was already an operation for for four or five years yeah what that happened uh long story short
[02:29:24.800 --> 02:29:32.400]  here we did just fine without uh without the the the the major syndicated property but you got the
[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:38.080]  big but you got the big host back anyways right we did we did get the big host back because they
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:43.200]  failed on the smaller pipsqueak station okay michael we've got a lot of big stations listening
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:47.840]  our mom pops all the great folks listening go through what you would do if you were them
[02:29:47.840 --> 02:29:55.600]  when we come back so they can survive and thrive we're on the march the empires on the run alex

[02:33:56.640 --> 02:34:03.360]  strength at all you have nothing but spindly limbs of a dream and the state has no use for your kind
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:13.680]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones oh we are back live i don't think
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:19.120]  i've ever done an hour of radio quite like this and we'll shift gears into some news and your
[02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:25.040]  calls here in a little while but i it was my idea to get michael's whirling on because you know you
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:30.080]  go to a big radio function radio managers owners from all over the country they want to come over
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:34.800]  and talk to michael's whirling because they know how successful he's been in the ratings
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:40.480]  in profits and of course he sells out his advertising too and he's got the big audience
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:45.840]  and even though they took a big host away from him he got that big number one host back years later
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:51.120]  but the point is he's been successful successful successful and he sought out my show to put it
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:55.760]  on air because he was talking to a lot of the big you know uppity ups in radio you know saying this
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:00.800]  is the up and coming show and this is listener driven and so i want to encourage listeners
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:05.760]  you know whether you want to make ten dollars a month or just get discounts on high quality

[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:08.160]  a radio exact it was a radio it was a radio consultant who said to me the smartest thing you
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:13.040]  could do mz is put alex jones i said alex jones i've interviewed him he's a great interview i've
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:17.360]  had i've had him on my show a couple of times you're a great interview and i knew that you had
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:22.160]  your own show in fact i met that fellow he'd been a station owner too correct no no never
[02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:28.160]  no never an owner he he was a he was and is a consultant to other radio stations and he said
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:33.840]  to me michael you have always been a trailblazer you've all you're a person who likes to experiment
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:38.240]  and do things differently this will be a great thing that if you listen to me you're going to
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:45.600]  be very very happy put alex jones on your station we had a we had a slot to fill anyhow because
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:51.280]  bill o'reilly uh announced that he was leaving talk radio sort of like the opposite of rush
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:56.000]  limbaugh rush did great and radio continues but not too well in television it's just the
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:00.480]  opposite with bill o'reilly did great with with television but not too well in radio never got
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:06.080]  many ratings so he decided to hang up his guns and and uh when that was announced uh because we
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:10.800]  were on affiliate list every syndicator in the world was calling us saying what are you going to
[02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:15.920]  do at ksco to replace alex to replace uh bill o'reilly and i said we're going to do something local
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:21.600]  and i said oh well they you could hear a thud because no one replaces one syndicated program
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:28.080]  with local they go the other direction but we're just sort of different anyhow um glenn said to me
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:33.520]  he said don't do you know who the local person is yet and i said no he says do an experiment
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:38.320]  like you like to do put alex jones on and see what happens you're going to be amazed at what
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:44.880]  happens you know within two or three days of putting you on as an experiment someone uh i
[02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:50.880]  was walking out of the radio station and a stranger walked up to me and said are you mz and i said yeah
[02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:56.560]  and he said uh he reaches out to shake my hand and he puts a hundred dollar bill in my hand
[02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:01.840]  and i said what's this he says that's for putting alex jones on the radio says just an experiment
[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:06.480]  we don't even know if it's going to be permanent here he says the very fact that you put him on
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:13.200]  for even an hour you deserve this money thank you thank you thank you anyhow really powerful
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:18.320]  dramatic stuff and that was many that was a year and a half before uh before you came and
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:22.960]  spoke at the coconut grove and uh people from all over the world i think the farthest person
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:27.760]  that i know of who flew in to watch you speak and pay ten dollars and eighty cents or we're at
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:33.840]  am ten eighty on the dial so we made the tickets really inexpensive um was uh came flew in from
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:39.360]  somewhere in ireland to watch you speak well that's the thing um and i know that's why from
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:43.440]  insiders that talk radio network they record my show every day i've been told us with people that
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:48.160]  work at talk radio network uh high level they record it and it's sent to the head guys and
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:53.200]  they're not sure what they're doing with it and i know claire channel keeps tabs on us and things
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:57.840]  and i'm not even that good of a talk show host it's just the information is real it's it's
[02:39:57.840 --> 02:40:03.440]  powerful and folks understand that if you did a gardening show it would be the best gardening
[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:10.640]  show i'm not going to smoke out i'm just being truthful you have passion you have spirit you
[02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:17.680]  believe you you you have truth you have belief in what in what you're all about and you that's why
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:23.360]  you're successful with with or without the broadcasting industry now it's it's true that
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:28.880]  the broadcasting industry still has many many many many many millions of people listening to it
[02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:34.640]  that's why i want to help other broadcasters who don't know what the hell to do including the kgo's
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:38.720]  of the world that are going down the toilet as we speak to know that there's something new and
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:44.960]  different anyhow i'm gonna tell them about that in a moment but just going back uh because time
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:50.240]  just flies and i was saying i've been on your stations for uh because you got two uh for uh
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:54.720]  a year and a half but i guess it's been a lot longer than that how long have i been on there
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:41:01.440]  uh since uh april or may of uh of oh nine so it's over two years now wow time just flies
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:06.720]  uh but but i'll tell you a brief story because my parents are really starting to get blown away
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:12.160]  because now through the internet and everything else and i'm not bragging i mean it's it's just a
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:19.200]  point out the effect of this broadcast now anywhere i go whether it's england central america canada
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:26.960]  uh austin texas everywhere i go i get stopped and sometimes i get mobbed by people to the point
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:34.720]  of where i got 20 people around me but my dad is going on a road trip next week uh with my mother
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:44.640]  and he called a motel in the middle of nowhere uh on the texas-oklahoma border to see about staying
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:51.120]  there this is just last week and to make a reservation and the woman said okay give me your uh you know
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:42:00.000]  info your zip code and when he said 78704 south austin she said wow austin that's where alex jones
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:05.760]  lives i listen to him every day uh do you don't you do you like alex jones yeah but the thing is
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:12.960]  that stuff is happening all the time and i'm telling you michael that's what's scary and daunting about
[02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:19.520]  this is that uh with great power comes great responsibility and we really are reaching
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:24.560]  millions of new people a week not just our three four million you know regular listeners we're
[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:31.360]  reaching millions of new people a week and the message is so uh unorthodox from the main line
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:37.280]  liberal conservative false spectrum you know inside the box system that that is just incredible
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:41.920]  but enough about me what has actually happened alex in the last year that no one would have
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:49.200]  ever believed possible even yourself probably you know uh people are much more open to the message
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:54.080]  that it ain't about liberal versus conservative it ain't about democrats versus republican
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:43:01.680]  it's about pure control of the serfs by government and big business that's your message in a nutshell
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:07.840]  yes and that's and that is the absolute truth absolutely and and no matter what we do put in
[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:12.880]  bush gets worse put in obama gets worse and it comes down to the big mega corporations
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:18.640]  that control government the the anti-capitalist crony monopolist but but enough of me because
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:22.880]  i want to get to some other news and uh calls here i mean speaking directly to the station
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:28.160]  owners managers and others yeah if they go to infomercial show become an affiliate of the alex

[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:23.920]  she first heard him she's a she by the way she's 90 years old going on 40 and she just published
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:28.560]  her first book it's amazing but went back when she first heard dr wallach on our station
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:33.760]  and she called me up and she said i don't know who this guy is but he's got an amazing message
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:39.120]  and you need to you know you need to somehow get involved with him and i said yes we're doing great
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:44.560]  i mean he's our biggest advertiser now so never mind what get get involved in helping him spread
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:50.960]  his message my mom's really smart no she is she she's sharp as a tack or sharp as a razor blade

[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:17.280]  i'm gonna try to get to julie and a few others go ahead uh alex yes sir go ahead yeah hi i'd like
[02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:24.480]  to cover two things if i could uh one is my own and the other one is my wife's um i run a very large
[02:56:24.480 --> 02:56:32.880]  trucking website and um i get about oh about 140 000 visitors a month and uh i did and i did some
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:38.960]  digging into this uh nasty super highway stuff about a year ago and this this relates to chops
[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:45.360]  really um there's a real problem i mean we we got a huge problem i mean these guys oh they're
[02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:50.000]  putting ships in everything tracking you they're going to make all the trucks out of mexico not
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:55.520]  be by the same rules but be able to come in again it's about the globalist just like with milk 50
[02:56:55.520 --> 02:57:00.720]  years ago coming in buying it up putting regulations in to shut down real milk producers
[02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:06.880]  shut down independent truckers or even american companies shut down local radio stations mz comments
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:13.280]  on this a comments on on what about shutting down well just the total consolidation across the board
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:21.440]  oh yeah that's it's it's awful i mean the fcc happened to uh three or four years ago uh come
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:29.680]  and have a public uh a hearing on how to increase diversity and localism and i said i i got up and
[02:57:29.680 --> 02:57:37.680]  spoke and i said it's obvious you know go back to the original rules about no no one station can
[02:57:37.680 --> 02:57:43.680]  own more than one am or one fm and one fm in the same market well now it's admitted that the big
[02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:49.520]  major syndicators are all in the verge of collapse so their own system like the megabanks has destroyed
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:54.160]  them so maybe it'll go back to that uh ron sorry to interrupt you finish up your point about the
