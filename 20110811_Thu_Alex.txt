[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.804]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.804 --> 00:00:11.406]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:12.947]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.947 --> 00:00:17.131]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:21.215]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.517 --> 00:00:41.679]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.961]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:46.965]  It is Thursday, the 11th day of August, 2011.
[00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:51.470]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.414]  And we're also going to have wide open phones once I've gotten into some of the basic news.
[00:00:56.135 --> 00:01:05.142]  Now, the stock market has dropped, I don't know, a thousand points or so in the last week and a half, but today it's up 282 points.
[00:01:05.142 --> 00:01:13.128]  Currently, CNBC asked the question, markets are being irrational, so stay away from stocks.
[00:01:13.128 --> 00:01:15.049]  That's what their experts are saying.
[00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.893]  Is it really 2008 all over again, and why it could get much, much worse?
[00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:33.783]  We're going to be looking at the ongoing riots in the UK with the British government, the UK government now calling to restrict free speech all over that country and also start tracking and shutting down social media.
[00:01:33.783 --> 00:01:42.770]  Now if Facebook, Twitter and others, mainly Twitter, would have just shut down accounts that were calling for violence and coordinating criminal activity, it wouldn't be needed.
[00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.651]  Go after everyone's speech, but this is how the system works.
[00:01:46.651 --> 00:02:01.035]  The police stand down, let four plus days of riots take place, and then now Parliament is meeting right now calling for all sorts of draconian restrictions as we predicted they would do.
[00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:04.856]  In financial news, we're going to be going over all of it today.
[00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:09.557]  A national debt of $14 trillion, try $211 trillion.
[00:02:09.557 --> 00:02:11.498]  That's the headline by NPR.
[00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:18.211]  Continuing government considers turning foreclosed houses into rentals.
[00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:19.314]  Continuing government...
[00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:23.975]  Is also trying to offer U.S.
[00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:29.976]  bonds, but a record low sale price for 10-year notes.
[00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:33.636]  Again, Treasury sells 10-year notes at record low rate.
[00:02:33.636 --> 00:02:36.377]  We're going to be going over that report today.
[00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:41.598]  Also, yawn climbs to 17-year high against the dollar.
[00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:43.598]  We'll be breaking down exactly what that means.
[00:02:43.598 --> 00:02:45.038]  Another report here.
[00:02:45.038 --> 00:02:48.019]  The sun never sets on the British welfare system.
[00:02:49.688 --> 00:02:51.429]  And a system of total dependency.
[00:02:51.429 --> 00:03:01.214]  There's a statement by the ex-checker of the Treasury over in England about the global financial meltdown that is being witnessed.
[00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:16.001]  Also, I got some inside Navy SEAL information, not from my Fort Hood or Fort Bragg sources, not from Colonel Six, but directly, directly from the father of a Navy SEAL.
[00:03:16.877 --> 00:03:21.841]  And I've really forgotten that I've known this individual for years.
[00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:23.963]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:03:23.963 --> 00:03:27.906]  And we've got some inside information on that front.
[00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:30.227]  In fact, I'll just put it out right now and I'll get more into it later.
[00:03:30.227 --> 00:03:33.550]  17 Navy SEALs died, not 22.
[00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.233]  And that's expected to come out very, very soon.
[00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:44.318]  And yes, his son is not in SEAL Team 6, but has a best friend in SEAL Team 6.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.443]  I'm not going to say too much or they'll be able to figure out who it is.
[00:03:49.443 --> 00:03:54.428]  And they were very suspicious that they were ordered.
[00:03:54.428 --> 00:03:55.689]  His son's friend survived.
[00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:59.232]  He wasn't part of the crash.
[00:03:59.232 --> 00:04:01.734]  And wouldn't talk about whether he was on the bin Laden raid or not.
[00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:08.117]  They were very specific about the information that they gave me.
[00:04:08.117 --> 00:04:10.939]  So I want to be careful about it.
[00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.142]  But to make a long story short, and by the way, this is all the information I have.
[00:04:15.142 --> 00:04:18.505]  I don't have anything extra, so there's no need for the government to come kill me.
[00:04:18.505 --> 00:04:19.986]  I just want to make that clear.
[00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:21.948]  Any info we get, we release.
[00:04:21.948 --> 00:04:24.210]  All of it, except for the names.
[00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.631]  They do believe there was a bomb on board the helicopter.
[00:04:27.612 --> 00:04:36.737]  And that they thought it was political, that they were put on that National Guard helicopter, something that they're not normally done, or that that many SEALs were put on board the helicopter.
[00:04:36.737 --> 00:04:42.501]  And the scuttlebutt is that they think somehow Al-Qaeda or the Taliban got a bomb on the helicopter.
[00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:44.843]  Of course, that shows the naivete.
[00:04:44.843 --> 00:04:50.988]  They can't believe that the government would do it, but they do think that politics is involved somehow.
[00:04:50.988 --> 00:04:53.871]  And so, that is the information on that front.
[00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:55.152]  I'll talk about that a little bit more.
[00:04:55.152 --> 00:04:59.055]  When we come back, we'll get into the latest in the riots going on in England.
[00:04:59.055 --> 00:05:00.917]  We will also... Well, stay with us.
[00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:03.079]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:08.383]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:08.383 --> 00:05:09.904]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:09.904 --> 00:05:18.692]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:19.432 --> 00:05:26.974]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:26.974 --> 00:05:34.977]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:34.977 --> 00:05:40.198]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:05:40.198 --> 00:05:42.359]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.365]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:05:48.365 --> 00:05:50.609]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:52.852]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:04.092]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:06:04.092 --> 00:06:05.372]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.372 --> 00:06:08.913]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:08.913 --> 00:06:11.534]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.534 --> 00:06:17.395]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.395 --> 00:06:23.637]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.037 --> 00:06:30.042]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.042 --> 00:06:34.225]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.225 --> 00:06:38.509]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:44.454]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:48.017]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.017 --> 00:06:49.998]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:49.998 --> 00:06:50.419]  It's here.

[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.926]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:09.926 --> 00:08:11.508]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.508 --> 00:08:13.070]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.255]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.255 --> 00:08:21.319]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.483 --> 00:08:30.508]  It is Thursday, the 11th day of August 2011.
[00:08:30.508 --> 00:08:34.531]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:38.215]  We do have some special guests coming up that I'll tell you a little bit more about later.
[00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:54.760]  But the headline up at DrugsReport.com, the headline up at Infowars.com, most dangerous time for global economy, that's the head of the Exchequer or the Treasury Secretary of England.
[00:08:55.561 --> 00:09:13.302]  Saying that this is basically much more dangerous than the quote contrived controlled demolition and looting of the economy known as the global banker bailout of 2008 and of course as we predicted as soon as they had the super Congress in place just like they had similar systems
[00:09:14.103 --> 00:09:27.471]  In Ireland, Greece, and other areas, as soon as they use the earlier crises to get dictatorial control in place, then they can start the real implosions of the economy.
[00:09:27.471 --> 00:09:31.614]  Also, President Obama is in deep water.
[00:09:31.614 --> 00:09:35.176]  Representative Peter King says the Pentagon, CIA must investigate.
[00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:38.898]  Yeah, they're going to have Beelzebub investigate Satan.
[00:09:38.898 --> 00:09:42.120]  Obama and the death of Osama bin Laden.
[00:09:43.536 --> 00:09:51.518]  And the movie that he's producing, secretly, with the producers of Hurt Locker, which by the way is a very powerful movie.
[00:09:51.518 --> 00:10:00.620]  Had a lot of hype, watched the movie on DVD months ago, a year after it came out, and it certainly lived up to the hype.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.101]  But this is the type of propaganda we're dealing with.
[00:10:04.101 --> 00:10:07.722]  And before I get into all the financial news, and give the toll-free number out,
[00:10:09.755 --> 00:10:12.958]  Get into the latest big developments in England.
[00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.862]  Amazon disarms Brits by banning self-defense items.
[00:10:16.862 --> 00:10:22.287]  You know, a few days ago it was pointed out that it was a 6,500 percent.
[00:10:22.287 --> 00:10:23.889]  That's when we happened to get a screenshot of it.
[00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:27.813]  It was actually 7,000 plus percent at one time.
[00:10:27.813 --> 00:10:30.175]  Uptick in sales of baseball bats.
[00:10:30.175 --> 00:10:32.938]  They were the number one sales item on Amazon UK.
[00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:36.040]  And they've now said, you know what?
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.542]  You're not allowed to have a baseball bat.
[00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:43.625]  Aluminum, wooden, little batons, whiffle wall bats.
[00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:44.305]  You can't have it.
[00:10:44.305 --> 00:10:46.746]  You can't protect yourself.
[00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:48.547]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:59.014]  And just an expanded example of how governments disarm the population, crime explodes, and the public has the book thrown at them when they try to defend themselves.
[00:10:59.014 --> 00:11:00.935]  So, that's coming up as well.
[00:11:00.935 --> 00:11:02.756]  Also, a very interesting article
[00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:09.734]  More and more, governments are going to begin to unveil the superweapons.
[00:11:09.734 --> 00:11:31.344]  I've interviewed Dr. Bob Bowman, the former head of the Star Wars weapons program, colonel in the Air Force when he got out and went to head up the STI program, and he could only talk about, on air and privately with me, things that had accidentally been declassified that weren't supposed to be.
[00:11:33.027 --> 00:11:53.860]  And he talked about how the former head of SDI, after he left, in a debate about SDI really being an offensive weapon in the mid-1990s on C-SPAN, that he went ahead and leaked the fact, that is the pro-SDI individual, that they had had unmanned drones circling the Earth
[00:11:54.986 --> 00:12:03.293]  Since the 70s and so Dr. Bob Bowman in fact it's time to get Bob Bowman back on tomorrow or next week.
[00:12:03.293 --> 00:12:16.064]  The problem is he really won't talk much about it but it's so interesting and it also shows all of these advanced technologies that are secret and kept from the public but
[00:12:18.174 --> 00:12:24.117]  The reason I raise all of this is that in the 1970s, SDI was already in full swing.
[00:12:24.117 --> 00:12:27.899]  The public wasn't even told about it until 1981.
[00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:31.260]  And then it was announced that it was supposedly a new initiative.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:38.324]  Kind of like they've now admitted, oh yeah, 20 years ago we were cloning human embryos, but killing them before they grew too large.
[00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:40.184]  And yeah, now we're mixing them with animals.
[00:12:40.184 --> 00:12:43.746]  And we've been doing that for a decade.
[00:12:43.746 --> 00:12:46.808]  And then, of course, later it'll come out that it was even previous to that.
[00:12:48.578 --> 00:12:53.042]  There's a lot of things going on that are secret in this world.
[00:12:54.304 --> 00:12:56.165]  And here's the London Guardian today.
[00:12:56.165 --> 00:12:57.987]  It's also in a bunch of other U.S.
[00:12:57.987 --> 00:12:58.587]  papers.
[00:12:58.587 --> 00:12:58.927]  U.S.
[00:12:58.927 --> 00:13:02.550]  military to launch fastest ever plane.
[00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.071]  And if you guys give me a document cam shot, I'll show folks this.
[00:13:05.071 --> 00:13:08.974]  We can put the article up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:13:08.974 --> 00:13:11.956]  Radio listeners, just go to InfoWars.com.
[00:13:11.956 --> 00:13:12.476]  U.S.
[00:13:12.476 --> 00:13:16.019]  military to launch fastest ever plane.
[00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:23.884]  Unmanned Falcon hypersonic technology vehicle can travel from London to Sydney in less than an hour.
[00:13:25.884 --> 00:13:36.747]  And it flies at the declassified speed of 13,000 miles per hour, or 20 times the speed of sound.
[00:13:36.747 --> 00:13:48.971]  Now, I've talked a lot about this, but, and then I'll get into the rest of the news that's happening currently, but this is a lot bigger than just a story about this space plane.
[00:13:48.971 --> 00:13:49.791]  And it is a space plane.
[00:13:51.721 --> 00:14:03.289]  The issue here is there's a lot of secret technology just like the stealth helicopter that reportedly is three generations back from around 30 years ago that you saw crash in the supposed Bin Laden raid.
[00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.693]  There's a lot of things going on we don't know about.
[00:14:07.693 --> 00:14:10.135]  And that's why the system's so arrogant.
[00:14:10.135 --> 00:14:12.798]  That's why they're on such incredible power trips.
[00:14:12.798 --> 00:14:18.444]  And people need to get a hold of the national security apparatus and force all this out in the open.
[00:14:18.444 --> 00:14:26.171]  We've had the elite banking system setting up the CIA in 47 and getting the National Security Act passed to be able to do whatever they want.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:34.202]  And so shipping in 500 billion in narcotics a year, now totally admitted, is the tip of the stinking iceberg.
[00:14:34.202 --> 00:14:36.823]  We are not in Kansas anymore.
[00:14:36.823 --> 00:14:39.244]  Human animal clones.
[00:14:39.244 --> 00:14:40.464]  Old technology.
[00:14:40.464 --> 00:14:41.625]  Space planes.
[00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:42.825]  Old technology.
[00:14:42.825 --> 00:14:48.587]  They tell you that the SR-71 Blackbird, developed in 52, in secret service in 55,
[00:14:50.247 --> 00:14:55.632]  In public operation in 59 is the fastest aircraft in the world.
[00:14:55.632 --> 00:14:58.014]  They've been saying that until today.
[00:14:58.014 --> 00:15:00.235]  Cruises at Mach 3 reportedly can go Mach 6.
[00:15:00.235 --> 00:15:01.677]  1950s technology.
[00:15:01.677 --> 00:15:02.317]  We're not in 1950.
[00:15:02.317 --> 00:15:02.757]  We're in 2011.
[00:15:02.757 --> 00:15:05.800]  And I give you... The unveiling of the new Falcon HTV-2.
[00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:22.039]  They claim they've been testing it since 2003, and that eight years later, they're letting you know about it now.
[00:15:22.039 --> 00:15:27.561]  If you believe that, I'll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge for $5.
[00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:27.721]  U.S.
[00:15:27.721 --> 00:15:31.543]  military-to-launch fastest-ever plane... Give me a break.
[00:15:31.543 --> 00:15:37.885]  Unmanned Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 can travel from London to Sydney in less than an hour.
[00:15:37.885 --> 00:15:44.368]  By the time you finish reading this sentence, the Falcon HTV-2, the fastest plane ever built, probably 30 years old,
[00:15:45.308 --> 00:15:47.851]  Undoubtedly, they're now showing you the stinker toy.
[00:15:47.851 --> 00:15:49.853]  Could have flown 18 miles.
[00:15:49.853 --> 00:15:52.575]  It could get from London to Sydney in less than an hour.
[00:15:52.575 --> 00:15:58.121]  While with standing temperatures of almost 2,000 centigrade, hotter than the melting point of steel.
[00:15:58.121 --> 00:16:04.427]  Now they're gonna start unveiling some of the 20-30 year old technology now, because the Russians and the Chinese are getting a little uppity.
[00:16:05.615 --> 00:16:11.439]  And I have predicted here they're now going to start unveiling the 80s technology and 70s technology.
[00:16:11.439 --> 00:16:15.061]  Now Dr. Bob Bowman revealed on this broadcast.
[00:16:16.806 --> 00:16:35.539]  That by 1979, over 100 drone space planes in continuous orbit around the planet can decapitate the entire leadership of every major industrial nation in one hour with DU 100-pound sabot meteor gun rounds.
[00:16:38.712 --> 00:16:42.414]  100-pound sabot du rounds.
[00:16:42.414 --> 00:16:43.994]  They are not atomic.
[00:16:43.994 --> 00:16:46.195]  They don't cause a hydrogen explosion.
[00:16:46.195 --> 00:16:56.360]  The incredible acceleration when they fire it into a gravity well at a target can destroy bases deeper than one mile under the earth, under a mountain.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:02.283]  They don't have bases one mile under the sea level because temperatures are above 120 degrees.
[00:17:02.283 --> 00:17:07.065]  You have to burrow under mountains to get the nice 65 degrees on average year-round.
[00:17:08.191 --> 00:17:18.215]  This is a decapitation, total precision weapon, and they, by the 70s, the globalists that run our country, had these craft circling the Earth.
[00:17:18.215 --> 00:17:28.039]  Now, that's the 1970s, and Dr. Bowman can only talk about it because in a debate, the other former head of SDI shot his mouth off.
[00:17:31.508 --> 00:17:37.593]  Now, we're in 2011, and they're telling us about Jumbo Auroras, and that's what this is.
[00:17:37.593 --> 00:17:56.087]  I remember a popular science article a decade ago about troop vehicles reportedly in secret development that can deploy Marine Force Recon Space Troops, that can deploy Navy SEALs, anything they want, in one hour, anywhere in the world.
[00:17:56.087 --> 00:17:59.750]  It goes up into space with its payload, comes back in over the target,
[00:18:00.731 --> 00:18:10.854]  They then are ejected in some type of space pod, getting it down near the ground, and then bring their little hovercraft in for a landing.
[00:18:10.854 --> 00:18:22.418]  They also have systems deployed where they're in one-man pods and fired in like a missile, and then at around 100,000 feet, they eject with oxygen mask on and spacesuits and come into the ground.
[00:18:22.418 --> 00:18:25.039]  When I gave a speech in
[00:18:26.263 --> 00:18:31.086]  I gave two speeches, two nights in a row, to crowds of 900 each evening out in Santa Cruz last year.
[00:18:31.086 --> 00:18:35.908]  I talked about thousands of dead Special Forces astronauts.
[00:18:35.908 --> 00:18:40.891]  And that was the one thing in the two days of speeches that some people rolled their eyes at.
[00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:54.478]  I have that information directly from high-level people inside NASA, who in both cases began shaking and gulping when I was given the information because they were giving me highly classified information.
[00:18:56.147 --> 00:19:01.231]  In fact, I should be talking about it, because it'll get me killed if I don't.
[00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:03.433]  And I was only given basics.
[00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:05.374]  And it was not Bowman that gave me this information.
[00:19:05.374 --> 00:19:11.599]  There has been a giant, ongoing, secret space program since the 1940s.
[00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:14.301]  The Russians were never ahead of the United States.
[00:19:14.301 --> 00:19:20.966]  The Russians are advanced and technological, but nothing compared to what the United States and the German scientists have developed.
[00:19:22.145 --> 00:19:28.247]  Alright, now I'm going off into a rant about this, but they're finally going to start rolling out the superweapons.
[00:19:28.247 --> 00:19:31.488]  They're bankrupting the world, and they're going to let everybody know.
[00:19:31.488 --> 00:19:35.949]  You're going to sit here and take this, or we'll take out every one of your leaders.
[00:19:35.949 --> 00:19:39.030]  And believe me, the Russians know about this.
[00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:43.451]  That's why they had, what, Baravosky, one of the big Russian leaders, just, uh,
[00:19:44.861 --> 00:19:49.186]  Boris Baravosky just a few months ago came out and said, we have super weapons too!
[00:19:49.186 --> 00:19:50.347]  We'll destroy you!
[00:19:50.347 --> 00:19:58.035]  And no doubt the Russians have been building giant underground bases all under the Urals and other areas, and they've got a lot of super weapons as well.
[00:19:58.035 --> 00:19:59.036]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:59.036 --> 00:20:00.138]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:20:00.578 --> 00:20:07.904]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.

[00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.973]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:35.973 --> 00:20:41.777]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:41.777 --> 00:20:45.419]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:22:04.461 --> 00:22:05.962]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:22:05.962 --> 00:22:14.387]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:22:14.827 --> 00:22:16.367]  Yes, my friends.
[00:22:16.367 --> 00:22:18.288]  Evil is rising.
[00:22:18.288 --> 00:22:19.168]  But take heart.
[00:22:19.168 --> 00:22:23.109]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:22:23.109 --> 00:22:28.531]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:22:28.531 --> 00:22:32.012]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:22:32.372 --> 00:22:34.093]  The globalists are scared.
[00:22:34.093 --> 00:22:35.413]  They've overreached.
[00:22:35.413 --> 00:22:38.934]  The future of the Infowar is in your hands.

[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.481]  The Infowar now goes into high gear.
[00:23:01.943 --> 00:23:12.291]  From the shattered Rust Belt come The Lost Vegas.
[00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:15.434]  Life Before the Collapse.

[00:24:03.206 --> 00:24:09.834]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:09.834 --> 00:24:14.279]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:23.030]  Briefly finishing up with the space news, what I was really told was there have been a lot of secret deaths and most of them
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.303]  The space program is under military and space command control.
[00:24:28.303 --> 00:24:29.924]  The public doesn't even know about it.
[00:24:29.924 --> 00:24:32.866]  And that's admitted, that upwards of 90% is secret.
[00:24:32.866 --> 00:24:34.027]  And I said, hundreds have died?
[00:24:34.027 --> 00:24:37.050]  And both individuals were like, numbers higher.
[00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.672]  And I said, thousands?
[00:24:39.672 --> 00:24:42.554]  I'm not going to say, but they just smile at you.
[00:24:42.554 --> 00:24:49.019]  There has been, and the Russians, you've heard the rumors, the reports of dead Chinese on the moon, dead Russians.
[00:24:49.019 --> 00:24:51.561]  There's all sorts of stuff going on.
[00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:54.184]  Most governments do not want to announce failures.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.170]  Or successes.
[00:24:57.341 --> 00:25:16.054]  But the point is, there have been people, military bases, police officers, FBI agents, there have been countless credible individuals who've reported, I've had family that's seen it, the big flying V-wings, the big giant things that look like blimps, and everybody thinks it's aliens.
[00:25:16.054 --> 00:25:17.515]  It's human technology.
[00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:19.056]  In fact, I've shown this before.
[00:25:19.056 --> 00:25:25.921]  You type giant blimps, or no, no, UFO over Salt Lake, you'll get ABC News,
[00:25:26.661 --> 00:25:31.485]  And Larry King also covered it a few years ago saying, what is it?
[00:25:31.485 --> 00:25:32.465]  Is it a UFO?
[00:25:32.465 --> 00:25:34.026]  Is it aliens?
[00:25:34.026 --> 00:25:38.710]  And they zoom in with a superpower zoom at a blimp over 100,000 feet.
[00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.612]  You could even see the stinking propellers on it.
[00:25:41.612 --> 00:25:46.636]  And the solar panels on the side.
[00:25:46.636 --> 00:25:52.640]  And it's admitted that DARPA and Homeland Security have got these up at very high altitudes.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.701]  They've crashed before.
[00:25:54.693 --> 00:26:00.196]  But the media still goes with the official cover story of, it must be aliens.
[00:26:00.196 --> 00:26:02.617]  No, these, in fact, there it is.
[00:26:02.617 --> 00:26:06.079]  Daily Download, ABC News, UFO blimp.
[00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:08.460]  And then you watch the newscast, they're like, is it alien?
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:08.980]  What is it?
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.441]  Oh, yeah.
[00:26:10.441 --> 00:26:10.861]  Give me a break.
[00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:12.162]  It's a gigantic blimp.
[00:26:12.162 --> 00:26:13.523]  It's not an alien.
[00:26:13.523 --> 00:26:16.484]  It's got stinking propellers on it and tail fins.
[00:26:16.484 --> 00:26:17.745]  But that's the low-tech stuff.
[00:26:17.745 --> 00:26:19.866]  They go with that because they're really inexpensive.
[00:26:19.866 --> 00:26:23.868]  Alexander Haig's company sold the concept back in the 90s to the U.S.
[00:26:23.868 --> 00:26:24.208]  government.
[00:26:27.162 --> 00:26:28.802]  These giant V-Wings.
[00:26:28.802 --> 00:26:29.923]  Seen these before?
[00:26:29.923 --> 00:26:32.843]  Everybody thinks they're little green men?
[00:26:32.843 --> 00:26:34.223]  No, they're not little green men.
[00:26:34.223 --> 00:26:35.764]  It's the Aurora program.
[00:26:35.764 --> 00:26:39.165]  They've got fighters, they've got drones, they've got troop carriers.
[00:26:39.165 --> 00:26:41.005]  They've got it all.
[00:26:41.005 --> 00:26:43.505]  And they've done all sorts of tests.
[00:26:43.505 --> 00:26:51.927]  And if you're out in the night sky some nights, I've seen it repeatedly, you see a giant explosion and wreckage and they say, oh, it's a satellite.
[00:26:51.927 --> 00:26:53.648]  Oh, it's Space Lab.
[00:26:53.648 --> 00:26:55.388]  Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.
[00:26:56.468 --> 00:27:01.094]  Sometimes it's secret astronaut program and they're burning up.
[00:27:01.094 --> 00:27:04.759]  So it is a giant secret program.
[00:27:04.759 --> 00:27:10.346]  And you're looking at Aurora.
[00:27:10.346 --> 00:27:11.307]  13,000 miles an hour.
[00:27:11.307 --> 00:27:14.492]  And you better believe this is a Model T space plane.
[00:27:15.936 --> 00:27:22.178]  You can go pull up, I've been to NASA in Florida and in Houston, and I can't remember which one it was.
[00:27:22.178 --> 00:27:23.778]  You can pull them up online too.
[00:27:23.778 --> 00:27:27.159]  The Werner Von Braun Drawings of Space Shuttle.
[00:27:27.159 --> 00:27:32.441]  Guys, type in Nazi Drawings of Space Shuttle, that'll get it.
[00:27:32.441 --> 00:27:36.002]  Or Werner Von Braun 1930s Drawings of Space Shuttle.
[00:27:36.002 --> 00:27:39.723]  He was proposing it to Hitler right after Hitler got elected.
[00:27:41.244 --> 00:27:46.245]  And Von Braun wasn't really a Nazi, but he went ahead and joined so he could get the unlimited funding.
[00:27:46.245 --> 00:27:49.786]  And then that whole Nazi space program just got moved over here.
[00:27:49.786 --> 00:27:53.106]  They had the B-2 style bomber designs.
[00:27:53.106 --> 00:28:02.408]  They, of course, invented the jet engine and had all sorts of jet aircraft that got into the fight in the last six months of the war.
[00:28:02.408 --> 00:28:03.608]  But I digress.
[00:28:03.608 --> 00:28:06.369]  They developed cruise missiles, unmanned cruise missiles.
[00:28:09.045 --> 00:28:10.906]  That was the 1940s, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:10.906 --> 00:28:12.467]  It's 2011.
[00:28:12.467 --> 00:28:14.969]  Look at how computer technology's developed.
[00:28:14.969 --> 00:28:16.790]  Look at automobile technology.
[00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:20.733]  Look at every form of technology has advanced.
[00:28:20.733 --> 00:28:22.854]  30 times, 40 times, 50 times.
[00:28:22.854 --> 00:28:27.978]  Now, computer, computing power doubles every year.
[00:28:27.978 --> 00:28:29.379]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:28:29.379 --> 00:28:32.721]  Okay, I'm done talking about that, and I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:28:32.721 --> 00:28:38.485]  We'll intersperse all the financial news, the incredible financial news, and your phone calls.
[00:28:40.409 --> 00:28:48.554]  Coming up throughout the next two and a half hours, but I want to give the toll-free number out to folks in England that want to talk about the riots and what they've witnessed there.
[00:28:48.554 --> 00:28:50.756]  Parliament's calls to take people's liberties now.
[00:28:50.756 --> 00:29:04.845]  In the aftermath of it, that wasn't hard to predict, the head of the Exchequer, the head of their Treasury Department, coming out and saying the most dangerous time for global economy.
[00:29:04.845 --> 00:29:07.847]  Yes, as we're maneuvered by the criminals into design collapse.
[00:29:08.888 --> 00:29:11.430]  We'll discuss all of that coming up.
[00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.732]  But the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:29:14.732 --> 00:29:15.772]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:15.772 --> 00:29:25.678]  And we will get you up and on the air today.
[00:29:25.678 --> 00:29:34.984]  And of course, Representative Peter King says Pentagon CIA must investigate Obama and death of Osama Bin Laden movie.
[00:29:34.984 --> 00:29:35.384]  Again,
[00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.352]  The bosses of America?
[00:29:39.352 --> 00:29:41.474]  The owners?
[00:29:41.474 --> 00:29:47.300]  The enforcers for the foreign bankers should investigate their teleprompter reader?
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.741]  Yeah, I'm sure that's gonna happen.
[00:29:48.741 --> 00:29:50.763]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.763 --> 00:29:52.164]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.164 --> 00:29:54.687]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.687 --> 00:29:57.389]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.902 --> 00:30:07.566]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:30:07.566 --> 00:30:12.709]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:12.709 --> 00:30:21.433]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:30:21.433 --> 00:30:25.516]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:30:25.516 --> 00:30:27.457]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:30:39.597 --> 00:30:41.738]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:30:41.738 --> 00:30:43.520]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.402]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:30:46.402 --> 00:30:50.645]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:30:50.645 --> 00:30:53.046]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:30:53.046 --> 00:30:55.748]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:30:55.748 --> 00:30:57.329]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:30:57.329 --> 00:30:58.110]  Got it.
[00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.610]  Others don't.
[00:31:01.505 --> 00:31:06.209]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:31:06.209 --> 00:31:12.634]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:31:12.634 --> 00:31:14.916]  Number one, study the past.
[00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:17.318]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:31:17.318 --> 00:31:21.040]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:25.253]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:31:25.253 --> 00:31:29.096]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:31:29.096 --> 00:31:34.140]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.143]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:31:38.143 --> 00:31:41.566]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:45.009]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:50.953]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:31:50.953 --> 00:31:55.596]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:55.596 --> 00:32:00.699]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:00.699 --> 00:32:15.148]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:32:16.161 --> 00:32:20.864]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:20.864 --> 00:32:33.631]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:32:33.631 --> 00:32:40.896]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:32:41.576 --> 00:32:51.945]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:32:51.945 --> 00:32:55.889]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:32:55.889 --> 00:32:58.992]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:33:06.949 --> 00:33:22.061]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:33:22.061 --> 00:33:24.743]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:36.075 --> 00:33:40.419]  Okay, we're going near phone calls here in just a moment.
[00:33:40.419 --> 00:33:43.943]  But I meant to get to this point yesterday.
[00:33:43.943 --> 00:33:45.465]  You notice they've done another rewrite.
[00:33:47.245 --> 00:33:50.668]  I love how Drudge has that comment before the article.
[00:33:50.668 --> 00:33:57.195]  Rewrite, SEALs were sent to stop fleeing Taliban not to rescue Rangers.
[00:33:57.195 --> 00:34:04.041]  It's funny, at dinner last night for my mother's birthday, my dad said, oh they've changed the story, they've done a rewrite.
[00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:08.946]  Now they weren't going to save Rangers, they were going to chase fleeing Taliban.
[00:34:10.305 --> 00:34:14.348]  See, they put out their official story, and then no later, troops are going to say it's a lie.
[00:34:14.348 --> 00:34:20.513]  So then they start changing it, changing it, changing it again.
[00:34:20.513 --> 00:34:39.769]  Well, it turns out now that, well, I was told by a Navy SEALs father who is known by me for many, many years, and I'll just leave it at that, that his friend is in SEAL Team 6, did not die over the weekend.
[00:34:42.465 --> 00:34:43.726]  His son is in Navy SEALS.
[00:34:43.726 --> 00:34:46.106]  His son's friend is in SEAL Team 6.
[00:34:46.106 --> 00:35:09.094]  So I was told by the father of the Navy SEAL that his friend, his best friend in SEAL Team 6, who was not killed in the crash over the weekend, that the SEALS are hopping mad, are angry, and believe that there was foul play, and that it was political that they were put on that helicopter, on that rundown Chinook, that
[00:35:12.648 --> 00:35:29.325]  Was a National Guard helicopter and that's not normally done that the whole mission was quote political that there were concerns raised and that they believe that Taliban or Al Qaeda was able to get a bomb on the helicopter.
[00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:43.636]  So they're saying it was some type of inside job, and that reminds me of the FBI in the news after 9-11 saying it was as if Al-Qaeda had moles inside of the FBI and Justice Department.
[00:35:43.636 --> 00:35:45.436]  Well, you bet!
[00:35:45.436 --> 00:35:53.940]  The Pentagon runs Al-Qaeda, just like Ammar al-Awlaki hanging out with the Secretary of the Army secretly at the Pentagon while he's on the news as number three in Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.322]  Or the government getting the underwear bomber on the aircraft.
[00:35:57.322 --> 00:35:58.542]  The Christmas Day bomber.
[00:35:58.542 --> 00:35:59.663]  The list goes on and on.
[00:36:04.944 --> 00:36:28.918]  So, it's just like with the raid on May 1st, which we then learned wasn't on May 1st, it was the day before, and bin Laden was buried at sea, and the Situation Room photo was fake, and there wasn't a live video feed, and we were lied to about that, and bin Laden didn't use his wife as a shield, and didn't fire back, and it wasn't a palace, and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:36:30.509 --> 00:36:37.171]  They practice lies to confuse you, to confound you, so you don't know what's true.
[00:36:37.171 --> 00:36:47.254]  Then the government put out fake Bin Laden photos, circulated it, gave it to people in the military, so they would then feel like they'd seen the dead body and that they were special.
[00:36:47.254 --> 00:36:50.195]  Then it came out the government circulated a fake photo.
[00:36:50.195 --> 00:36:52.796]  We saw senators say, I've seen the photo.
[00:36:52.796 --> 00:36:56.277]  Turned out they were shown the fake.
[00:36:56.277 --> 00:36:58.858]  But then you can have arguments with people in the military,
[00:36:59.963 --> 00:37:07.907]  We've had arguments, some of the staff here, with family they have in the military, that still say they've seen the photo, even when it's admitted it was fake.
[00:37:07.907 --> 00:37:14.851]  Just like 50 plus percent of so-called conservatives believe WMDs were found in Iraq, even though it's admitted they weren't.
[00:37:14.851 --> 00:37:17.993]  They remember the initial lie, they're holding on to it.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.200]  Now, I know Aaron Dykes is here and updating.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.221]  Will you call him in here real quick?
[00:37:23.221 --> 00:37:32.303]  Because I know the story about the hypersonic space plane is on Infowars.com, but now it's just been reported.
[00:37:32.303 --> 00:37:34.944]  Hypersonic plane lost.
[00:37:34.944 --> 00:37:36.124]  How convenient.
[00:37:36.124 --> 00:37:39.465]  They want to let everybody know they've got it, but now it's been lost.
[00:37:39.465 --> 00:37:39.925]  The U.S.
[00:37:39.925 --> 00:37:44.626]  Defense Advanced Research Projects, that's DARPA folks that invented the internet and everything else.
[00:37:44.626 --> 00:37:47.607]  They give us what they want to give us with back doors in it.
[00:37:48.814 --> 00:37:49.376]  The U.S.
[00:37:49.376 --> 00:37:52.164]  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
[00:37:52.164 --> 00:37:52.806]  Come on in, Aaron.
[00:37:52.806 --> 00:37:56.598]  I want to make sure this goes up right now on InfoWars.com, please, sir.
[00:38:00.439 --> 00:38:00.819]  U.S.
[00:38:00.819 --> 00:38:02.360]  Defense, thank you, U.S.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:15.906]  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency says, contact with its experimental hypersonic glider was lost after launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base on the central California coast.
[00:38:15.906 --> 00:38:25.570]  Yeah, lost and now orbiting as a, as we were talking about before this was announced minutes ago, orbiting as a platform to drop D.E.U.
[00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:26.770]  SABOs.
[00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.511]  That's speculation, but we know they've got them.
[00:38:29.625 --> 00:38:31.806]  It's speculation, that's what's happened here.
[00:38:31.806 --> 00:38:45.093]  The agency says in a Twitter posting that its unmanned Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 was launched today atop a rocket, successfully separated from the booster and entered the mission's glide phase.
[00:38:45.093 --> 00:38:48.534]  So it uses the slingshot of the Earth's gravity to accelerate.
[00:38:48.534 --> 00:38:53.777]  The agency says telemetry was supposedly lost, but released no details.
[00:38:53.777 --> 00:38:54.718]  Yes.
[00:38:54.718 --> 00:38:56.739]  We launched it, but it was lost.
[00:38:56.739 --> 00:38:57.159]  Yes.
[00:38:57.975 --> 00:39:04.719]  A similar vehicle was launched last year and returned nine minutes after data before contact was prematurely lost.
[00:39:04.719 --> 00:39:11.823]  The small aircraft is supposed to maneuver through the atmosphere at 13,000 miles per hour before intentionally diving into the ocean.
[00:39:11.823 --> 00:39:13.284]  Sure it is.
[00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:13.824]  The U.S.
[00:39:13.824 --> 00:39:21.929]  military is trying to develop technology response to threats around the globe at speeds of Mach 20 or greater.
[00:39:21.929 --> 00:39:24.891]  Yes, the little robot drones are being lost every time.
[00:39:27.251 --> 00:39:39.915]  This is all, because we know from Dr. Bob Bowman and others, a perfect way to cover the factor being left in orbit and have little special payloads on them.
[00:39:39.915 --> 00:39:45.917]  I just, when you study this stuff 24-7, in fact, I almost predicted it would be lost 30 minutes ago, but I didn't.
[00:39:45.917 --> 00:39:48.278]  Okay, let's just go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[00:39:48.278 --> 00:39:49.438]  It just gets too insane.
[00:39:51.314 --> 00:40:00.598]  I went and saw Planet of the Apes a few nights ago with the crew and told Rob halfway through, I said, all humans will die from a bioweapon release.
[00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:14.623]  And then as the lights turned on at the theater prematurely and the movie ended, I guess that's part of the effect, I said, watch, and the next one I turned to everybody and I said, watch, all humans will be killed by a bioweapon release, the same one that makes the apes super smart.
[00:40:14.623 --> 00:40:18.785]  And then
[00:40:20.214 --> 00:40:24.618]  It'll cut back in another episode to the astronauts returning to the planet.
[00:40:24.618 --> 00:40:36.527]  That's all kind of the Illuminati idea, the 2001 idea that the globalists are obsessed with and then the lights went back down and the movie came back on and then that indeed is what happens.
[00:40:36.527 --> 00:40:38.228]  I'm sorry, I just gave the movie away.
[00:40:38.228 --> 00:40:39.910]  Okay, now I'm going to shut up now.
[00:40:41.943 --> 00:40:43.303]  And just go to your calls.
[00:40:43.303 --> 00:40:48.084]  I want to remind you there's a special transmission tonight, 7 p.m.
[00:40:48.084 --> 00:40:51.065]  Central at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:40:51.065 --> 00:40:59.247]  I'm told it's going to be around 45 minutes long with Aaron Dykes, who from time to time will be sitting in doing the nightly news.
[00:40:59.247 --> 00:41:00.407]  It's going to start 7 p.m.
[00:41:00.407 --> 00:41:01.947]  Central, September 1st.
[00:41:01.947 --> 00:41:06.208]  You've been seeing a lot of InfoWars breaking news alerts.
[00:41:06.208 --> 00:41:09.589]  InfoWars Special Reports is technically their name.
[00:41:11.801 --> 00:41:18.543]  And you'll see Aaron doing special reports, myself doing special reports routinely for PrisonPlanet.tv members and viewers.
[00:41:18.543 --> 00:41:19.843]  And you've helped us build this.
[00:41:19.843 --> 00:41:21.343]  We built it and you came.
[00:41:21.343 --> 00:41:23.004]  Thank you.
[00:41:23.004 --> 00:41:26.004]  And also, we're going to start again that nightly show at 7.
[00:41:26.004 --> 00:41:32.666]  Special reports will generally be tagged on when we do them to the news transmission.
[00:41:32.666 --> 00:41:33.906]  And then it will just be extended.
[00:41:35.182 --> 00:41:40.027]  But as news breaks and develops, we will cover it all.
[00:41:40.027 --> 00:41:41.408]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[00:41:41.408 --> 00:41:45.972]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:41:45.972 --> 00:41:47.073]  Please make your point.
[00:41:47.073 --> 00:41:50.977]  I'll attempt to be brief so we can move on to the next person to get everybody on board here.
[00:41:50.977 --> 00:41:54.100]  Carl in California, thanks for holding your on the air.
[00:41:55.202 --> 00:41:56.803]  God bless you, young man.
[00:41:56.803 --> 00:41:59.146]  I've been listening to your show for about two years now.
[00:41:59.146 --> 00:42:04.951]  May I have just 30 seconds to give credit to a group here in Southern California.
[00:42:04.951 --> 00:42:07.393]  I call it Babylon 2.
[00:42:07.393 --> 00:42:11.397]  To thank you for waking us up here.
[00:42:11.397 --> 00:42:13.358]  We pray for you every day, Alex.
[00:42:13.358 --> 00:42:14.780]  We want you to continue this fight.
[00:42:16.405 --> 00:42:18.367]  We're passing out your CDs.
[00:42:18.367 --> 00:42:19.868]  It's a fantastic group.
[00:42:19.868 --> 00:42:21.669]  It's an Adventist group here in Southern California.
[00:42:21.669 --> 00:42:29.676]  We pass out the DVDs and the CDs at our market night, and I got together with them, and they awakened me.
[00:42:29.676 --> 00:42:37.243]  They got me to get rid of all my worldly ways, to give up listening to the radio and the media.
[00:42:38.653 --> 00:42:47.000]  Uh, to get rid of, you know, watching anything that the, that the national news and social parts tell those lies every day.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.983]  And, um, you know, we just, we just love you, man.
[00:42:50.983 --> 00:42:52.885]  Well, Carl, we appreciate you as well.
[00:42:52.885 --> 00:42:58.389]  You know, I mean, I, overall, it's good to unplug from television, but it's good to monitor the propaganda.
[00:42:58.389 --> 00:43:01.171]  You know, I don't watch sitcoms or dramas, but every time I do,
[00:43:02.052 --> 00:43:06.896]  It's the meth head in the show that abuses children is a Ron Paul supporter.
[00:43:06.896 --> 00:43:10.058]  Or the libertarian is a pedophile.
[00:43:10.058 --> 00:43:14.681]  Or the person that wants national sovereignty wants to murder people.
[00:43:14.681 --> 00:43:20.085]  Or the person that is concerned about the Federal Reserve is going to release nerve gas in New York.
[00:43:20.085 --> 00:43:27.110]  Or the person that is concerned about chemtrails is going to shoot children.
[00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:28.391]  It's everywhere.
[00:43:28.391 --> 00:43:31.333]  And so we've got to remember the brain-dead public
[00:43:32.762 --> 00:43:36.465]  Either folks are totally starting to wake up or they're getting more deep under mind control.
[00:43:36.465 --> 00:43:50.957]  It's kind of that split is happening and we have to remember that it is getting more and more overt and so it's good sometimes when I'm tired or don't want to do an extra broadcast or don't want to do another radio interview or don't want to
[00:43:51.277 --> 00:43:51.717]  Absolutely.
[00:43:51.717 --> 00:43:53.278]  Kim Trails was the first thing that I noticed.
[00:43:53.278 --> 00:43:57.281]  And the group told me, look out in the skies early in the morning, you'll see a nice, beautiful blue sky day.
[00:44:21.129 --> 00:44:25.531]  But, do you notice, when's the last time you saw this sky just stain blue the rest of the day?
[00:44:25.531 --> 00:44:33.554]  Now, from the fall of last year to the spring of this year, horizon to horizon, they shot the chaff all the way across the sky.
[00:44:33.554 --> 00:44:35.755]  And then I was waking up, people say, hey, did you notice that?
[00:44:35.755 --> 00:44:37.335]  Do you know what that is out there?
[00:44:37.335 --> 00:44:42.177]  That's aluminum, strontium, barium, and other types of poisonous gases that they're releasing on us each and every day.
[00:44:42.177 --> 00:44:46.939]  And, you know, the people just, you know, were dismayed and didn't believe it.
[00:44:46.939 --> 00:44:49.720]  But I've been trying to go around the crusade here in my local town.
[00:44:50.353 --> 00:44:51.354]  Well, good job, Carl.
[00:44:51.354 --> 00:44:53.595]  We gotta jump to get to other folks, but that's exciting.
[00:44:53.595 --> 00:45:09.624]  Look, for those that are new listeners, 17 years ago, starting at about 95, before I was even on air, I got on air on access at 95, people were saying, are you seeing how the jet trails don't go away now?
[00:45:09.624 --> 00:45:13.946]  And pilots and people I knew were saying, they must be dumping their fuel or something.
[00:45:13.946 --> 00:45:14.767]  This is weird.
[00:45:15.367 --> 00:45:27.338]  And they're forming at low altitudes even in the summer and it's forming these hazes and look at the chemicals and then by about 12 years ago, different scientists would go up on their own aircraft and capture some of it.
[00:45:27.338 --> 00:45:28.839]  They would test the soil.
[00:45:28.839 --> 00:45:32.403]  They said it's barium salt, strontium, aluminum dioxide.
[00:45:32.403 --> 00:45:36.546]  This is some type of weather modification and then two years ago,
[00:45:37.327 --> 00:45:48.034]  The first speech, the head of the science czar, of all science operations for DARPA, you name it, that's what Holdren's over.
[00:45:48.034 --> 00:45:58.100]  The guy that says put stuff in the water to sterilize the public, world government, exterminate people, a very, very wicked person, but he's in line with the rest of them, and so that's why he's put in that position.
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:02.363]  He came out and said, yes, there's been a 15-year-long program
[00:46:03.188 --> 00:46:15.798]  So that's now a 17-year program, and he even mentions the Nobel Prize that the scientists won, I think it was 92, for coming up with a plan to spray these things in the atmosphere to save us from global warming.
[00:46:18.726 --> 00:46:25.072]  And some people say that when they did all those high-altitude nuke tests, it blew holes in the ionosphere and that they're trying to fix it.
[00:46:25.072 --> 00:46:26.393]  I don't know the truth.
[00:46:26.393 --> 00:46:40.084]  All I know is the old-timers went and did the test, made films, went on record, said it's barium salts, aluminum dioxide, got called crazy, and then the government comes out and says, yeah, we've got secret programs that have been in the testing phase.
[00:46:40.084 --> 00:46:43.187]  We're getting ready to go operational with geoengineering.
[00:46:43.187 --> 00:46:46.270]  It's terraforming the planet to the way they want.
[00:46:47.493 --> 00:46:54.195]  And it's secret, the details, but we are spraying aluminum dioxides, barium salts, other things.
[00:46:54.195 --> 00:46:57.656]  Exactly what the researchers said.
[00:46:57.656 --> 00:47:00.977]  Exactly.
[00:47:00.977 --> 00:47:02.637]  And see, it was always hidden in plain view.
[00:47:02.637 --> 00:47:05.698]  It was about five years ago, a caller called and he said,
[00:47:07.062 --> 00:47:11.866]  You haven't typed in high-altitude aerosol, passive aerosol spraying campaign?
[00:47:11.866 --> 00:47:13.327]  And I said, no.
[00:47:13.327 --> 00:47:15.048]  And he said, yeah, I just found this.
[00:47:15.048 --> 00:47:16.589]  And by the way, nobody found this stuff.
[00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:17.790]  It was a caller found it.
[00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:29.940]  I put the call out, looked it up on Google, and it was all these universities and Department of Energy and everybody involved with the UN admitting worldwide weather modification test
[00:47:30.865 --> 00:47:33.167]  And that they were manipulating the weather.
[00:47:33.167 --> 00:47:36.090]  And so for five years, you know, we've talked about it.
[00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:39.993]  And a couple years into that, John P. Holdren came out and said, yeah, it's all true.
[00:47:39.993 --> 00:47:41.174]  We're doing it for your own good.
[00:47:41.174 --> 00:47:43.476]  The tales are classified.
[00:47:43.476 --> 00:47:44.397]  And that's what I mean.
[00:47:44.397 --> 00:47:46.078]  They just go, yeah, we got space planes.
[00:47:46.078 --> 00:47:47.059]  Don't worry about it.
[00:47:47.059 --> 00:47:48.581]  Yeah, we're spraying stuff in the atmosphere.
[00:47:48.581 --> 00:47:49.701]  Don't worry about it.
[00:47:49.701 --> 00:47:51.323]  Yeah, we created some human clones.
[00:47:51.323 --> 00:47:52.364]  Don't worry about it.
[00:47:52.364 --> 00:47:53.605]  Yeah, we crossed them with animals.
[00:47:53.605 --> 00:47:55.246]  Don't worry about it.
[00:47:55.246 --> 00:47:55.507]  Folks,
[00:47:56.792 --> 00:48:00.625]  Dancing with the Stars, American Idol, this is not what matters.
[00:48:00.625 --> 00:48:03.113]  We are in a very...
[00:48:04.364 --> 00:48:15.672]  Very strange position right now with very crazy anti-human people running things that are jacking with our food, our water, the vaccines.
[00:48:15.672 --> 00:48:18.434]  We're all in this together.
[00:48:18.434 --> 00:48:23.198]  99.9% of people are not aware of this who are outside of these circles.
[00:48:23.198 --> 00:48:28.421]  We've reverse engineered the information and covered it, but we are living in a science fiction movie.
[00:48:28.421 --> 00:48:30.243]  We are living in a false reality.
[00:48:31.658 --> 00:48:36.461]  If you're tuned in to the mainline information on the news.
[00:48:36.461 --> 00:48:40.863]  All right, let's go to Pastor Lonnie in Tennessee, then John, Chris, James, John and others.
[00:48:40.863 --> 00:48:42.824]  Go ahead, Pastor.
[00:48:42.824 --> 00:48:47.327]  Yeah, I got one question and two or three points real quick.
[00:48:47.327 --> 00:48:53.150]  Did you happen to see on July 13th a simulation of oil supply disruption?
[00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:57.633]  I did hear that the government was working on that with oil companies, but I didn't really read deeply into it.
[00:48:57.633 --> 00:48:58.173]  Tell us about it.
[00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:05.780]  Yeah, it was on C-SPAN, July 13th, but it's been playing quite a bit lately.
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:11.402]  Basically, they dealt with what Lindsey Williams was saying with $200 a barrel of oil.
[00:49:11.402 --> 00:49:19.987]  They're saying the processing facility in Saudi Arabia, Abquad, I think it's pronounced, the number one largest oil process facility.
[00:49:21.937 --> 00:49:23.257]  Yeah, I've got to pull that up.
[00:49:23.257 --> 00:49:26.698]  In fact, somebody took my pen out of here, probably me.
[00:49:26.698 --> 00:49:30.299]  Somebody will run me a pen in here.
[00:49:30.299 --> 00:49:33.300]  Somebody steals the pens out of the studio to begin with.
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.321]  I don't really mean steal, I mean everybody.
[00:49:35.321 --> 00:49:36.721]  Everybody borrows everybody's pens.
[00:49:36.721 --> 00:49:39.602]  Thank you, Jaren.
[00:49:39.602 --> 00:49:44.303]  I did see that a few weeks ago, so why don't you give me the name of it again.
[00:49:44.303 --> 00:49:48.084]  I want the Simulated Oil Disruption Program of the Department of Energy.
[00:49:49.318 --> 00:49:53.243]  Yeah, it was called the Simulation Oil Suppliers on C-SPAN 1.
[00:49:55.834 --> 00:50:05.739]  And Adele with Stuart Eisenbach, Susan Schwab, Steve Hadley, John Negroponte, John Hoffmeister, you know, CEO of Shell.
[00:50:05.739 --> 00:50:20.645]  Yeah, what they're doing is, they are, just like they had meetings eight years ago on C-SPAN about how TSA would be on the streets of America, they get all the CEOs and people together with government, and then government people do watch C-SPAN to actually know what's going on.
[00:50:20.645 --> 00:50:24.187]  You can learn incredible things from there, and now they've built a technological grid
[00:50:24.847 --> 00:50:34.873]  Under the Department of Defense and DARPA that designed our highways in the 50s, the entire system, and now they have us dependent on the grid so they can start turning it off.
[00:50:34.873 --> 00:50:37.274]  You understand how wicked this master plan is?
[00:50:38.248 --> 00:50:39.810]  Oh yeah, I got a little bit more on that.
[00:51:00.809 --> 00:51:01.709]  Attention gardeners!
[00:51:01.709 --> 00:51:04.310]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:08.852]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:51:08.852 --> 00:51:16.714]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:51:17.034 --> 00:51:20.156]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:51:20.156 --> 00:51:27.802]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:51:27.802 --> 00:51:33.606]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:51:33.606 --> 00:51:39.450]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:42.692]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:51:42.992 --> 00:51:46.576]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:51:46.576 --> 00:51:51.661]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:51:51.661 --> 00:51:54.544]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:54.744]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:52:00.598 --> 00:52:03.900]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:08.464]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long-term storable food business.
[00:52:08.464 --> 00:52:15.849]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price in 1981.
[00:52:19.994 --> 00:52:20.434]  I think so.
[00:52:37.722 --> 00:52:38.202]  We're good to go.

[00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:52.691]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[00:53:52.691 --> 00:53:54.413]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
[00:53:54.413 --> 00:53:55.093]  You're the pretender!
[00:54:21.323 --> 00:54:23.549]  Okay, let's try to hurry through your calls now.
[00:54:23.549 --> 00:54:28.803]  Pastor, finishing up the point that watching the oil shortage simulation on C-SPAN.
[00:54:28.803 --> 00:54:29.144]  Go ahead.
[00:54:30.114 --> 00:54:55.690]  Yeah, basically there's a bunch of Bush cronies in his administration portraying Obama's cronies in their administration, which, there's no difference, but they basically dealt with the credit downgrade, they talked about a hit on the soil processing plant, trying to link it to Al-Qaeda, and stuff like that, and basically just, they had GNN, the Global News Network,
[00:54:56.303 --> 00:55:00.584]  And everything portraying it while they sat there and portrayed it in segments.
[00:55:00.584 --> 00:55:01.465]  Pretty interesting.
[00:55:01.465 --> 00:55:07.526]  It really shows them really pretty much admitting what's about to take place this fall.
[00:55:07.526 --> 00:55:09.607]  Another quick point to London.
[00:55:09.607 --> 00:55:19.510]  If you read 2 Ezra and the Apocrypha, it talks about in chapter 15, 16, for there shall be sedition among men and invading one another.
[00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:20.430]  We're good to go.
[00:55:41.597 --> 00:55:50.380]  You and Anderson and Bob Chapman and them talking about gold and silver, but I just want to give you a critical thing to think about.
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:57.302]  The Bible also says... They will throw their gold and jewels out in the streets and beat themselves on the head, right?
[00:55:57.302 --> 00:55:58.802]  Well, no, not necessarily.
[00:55:58.802 --> 00:56:02.383]  You know, that's in the original, in the Old Testament.
[00:56:02.383 --> 00:56:07.424]  But in 2nd Ezra, it talks about to be as pilgrims as nourished.
[00:56:07.424 --> 00:56:09.205]  Don't occupy merchandise.
[00:56:10.495 --> 00:56:16.841]  Because strangers will reap their fruits, spoil their goods, overthrow their houses, and captivate their families.
[00:56:16.841 --> 00:56:18.862]  Pastor, I appreciate your call.
[00:56:18.862 --> 00:56:26.169]  We need to try to make good financial decisions so that we're not poor and so the system can control us.
[00:56:26.169 --> 00:56:28.391]  I mean, if you want to get into it, Christians aren't supposed to be
[00:56:29.821 --> 00:56:31.002]  Doing well.
[00:56:31.002 --> 00:56:33.323]  What about the prodigal son?
[00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:34.724]  What about Abraham?
[00:56:34.724 --> 00:56:43.329]  I mean, it's just my whole issue here is it's good to give people advice on gold, and they've done very, very well with that.
[00:56:43.329 --> 00:56:44.229]  Thank you, though.
[00:56:44.229 --> 00:56:45.870]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:46.991]  Welcome.
[00:56:46.991 --> 00:56:47.852]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:47.852 --> 00:56:48.132]  Hi.
[00:56:48.132 --> 00:56:48.412]  Welcome.
[00:56:49.537 --> 00:56:51.700]  You know, I want to talk about these weather weapons, Alex.
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.083]  Right now, I think we're under all-out attack.
[00:56:54.083 --> 00:56:57.528]  I mean, we've had wrecking floods, wrecking tornadoes, wrecking storms.
[00:56:57.528 --> 00:57:01.233]  Right now, we're in the middle of a drought, and Texas has burned us to a crisp.
[00:57:01.233 --> 00:57:05.158]  Well, if you pay Al Gore some money, he'll make it stop.
[00:57:05.158 --> 00:57:07.081]  But, right now, nobody wants to talk about it.
[00:57:07.805 --> 00:57:09.545]  I mean, you know, no problem.
[00:57:09.545 --> 00:57:15.426]  Well, they do have, I mean, over in Dubai, they've put up the different HAARP systems.
[00:57:15.426 --> 00:57:17.707]  That's Daily Mail Associated Press.
[00:57:17.707 --> 00:57:20.647]  Will you guys put up Dubai turning the desert green?
[00:57:20.647 --> 00:57:27.048]  It'll show the antenna farms that when the water comes across, they hit it and make it turn into condensation and rain.
[00:57:27.048 --> 00:57:28.909]  They're turning the desert green with that.
[00:57:28.909 --> 00:57:29.849]  So, yes, the U.S.
[00:57:29.849 --> 00:57:33.769]  government that developed all this could be making it rain right now.
[00:57:33.769 --> 00:57:36.810]  Bill Gates has patented a bunch of, he's obsessed with it.
[00:57:37.679 --> 00:57:40.044]  I don't know if they're currently causing this drought.
[00:57:40.044 --> 00:57:44.112]  We had a really bad drought in the 50s here in Texas, but it is an incredible drought.
[00:57:44.112 --> 00:57:46.817]  I mean, it's like living here in Austin.
[00:57:48.137 --> 00:57:50.338]  You go outside, it's not like the desert.
[00:57:50.338 --> 00:57:53.200]  There's like dead trees everywhere and dead grass everywhere.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:56.782]  And it just looks like some apocalyptic world.
[00:57:56.782 --> 00:57:57.842]  And it's only getting worse.
[00:57:57.842 --> 00:58:00.664]  We got two more months of incredible heat.
[00:58:00.664 --> 00:58:03.545]  But I remember being a kid in Dallas and it being 112 degrees.
[00:58:03.545 --> 00:58:06.086]  So three, four days in a row at 107.
[00:58:06.086 --> 00:58:09.348]  And by the way, the guys found the article for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:58:09.348 --> 00:58:13.010]  If you scroll up, you'll be able to see the antenna arrays.
[00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:14.731]  Anything else on that front, John?
[00:58:15.506 --> 00:58:21.910]  Yeah, I was up in Michigan at the end of June, and we had a horrendous rainstorm.
[00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:25.312]  And when it was over with, my mother's house looked like it was sitting in the middle of a lake.
[00:58:25.312 --> 00:58:29.134]  And she's 82, and she told me, she said, I've never seen this happen before.
[00:58:29.134 --> 00:58:32.236]  And I said, Mom, you better hang on to your hat, because it's going to get a whole lot worse.
[00:58:32.236 --> 00:58:35.657]  It is, and the globalists will say, pay us a global carbon tax.
[00:58:35.657 --> 00:58:37.358]  We'll make it all go away.
[00:58:37.358 --> 00:58:38.139]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:44.278 --> 00:58:51.682]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.682 --> 00:58:53.403]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.403 --> 00:58:58.705]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:58.705 --> 00:59:00.246]  Saving means to make money.
[00:59:00.246 --> 00:59:09.031]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:09.771 --> 00:59:17.295]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:17.295 --> 00:59:25.299]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[01:00:05.236 --> 01:00:10.060]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.661]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.661 --> 01:00:13.582]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.582 --> 01:00:17.405]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:23.149]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.149 --> 01:00:25.051]  The news couldn't be weirder.
[01:00:25.051 --> 01:00:28.133]  Man arrested by TSA with Fourth Amendment on his chest.
[01:00:29.491 --> 01:00:31.354]  Says constitutional rights violated.
[01:00:31.354 --> 01:00:35.018]  Putin finds ancient Greek jars while scuba diving.
[01:00:35.018 --> 01:00:35.919]  And you say staged?
[01:00:37.719 --> 01:00:38.720]  Unbelievable.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:47.868]  Sony is making a classified Bin Laden death raid movie illegally with the president and there's calls for investigations.
[01:00:47.868 --> 01:00:53.833]  They've also changed their official story saying the SEALs were sent to stop fleeing Taliban, not rescue Rangers.
[01:00:53.833 --> 01:00:57.295]  I tell you, they just script all this stuff.
[01:00:57.295 --> 01:00:59.938]  We'll be getting into all of that news and more.
[01:01:01.513 --> 01:01:08.216]  Here's another story, Drudge Report drives more traffic than Facebook and Twitter combined, absolutely.
[01:01:08.216 --> 01:01:12.658]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:01:12.658 --> 01:01:14.319]  Chris in California, welcome.
[01:01:15.444 --> 01:01:16.364]  Yes, thank you Alex.
[01:01:16.364 --> 01:01:19.485]  I wanted to say long time listener, first time caller.
[01:01:19.485 --> 01:01:23.145]  You do a lot for everybody out here and I really appreciate it.
[01:01:23.145 --> 01:01:24.886]  Thank you.
[01:01:24.886 --> 01:01:25.566]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:01:25.566 --> 01:01:26.246]  Thank you.
[01:01:26.246 --> 01:01:30.687]  I wanted to say first off, I got an email from my girlfriend this morning.
[01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:35.167]  She's an HR manager at a large outdoor construction home supply store chain in here.
[01:01:35.167 --> 01:01:36.088]  I won't name which one.
[01:01:36.088 --> 01:01:38.368]  I'm sure you can figure out one of the two.
[01:01:38.368 --> 01:01:44.569]  She's the HR manager there and has to watch these safety videos every month addressing kind of issues for the store to address.
[01:01:45.289 --> 01:02:02.155]  And this month's video, there was a guy in it and he's voicing over the thing and he says, if you see someone purchasing unusual amounts of some materials such as a bag of fertilizer, propane, acids, pipes, pipe caps, and timers, contact the manager immediately.
[01:02:02.155 --> 01:02:07.177]  In the video it's a large, it's portraying a large black man with tattoos purchasing these products.
[01:02:07.997 --> 01:02:26.216]  And a week before she told me this, in our local newspaper they published this article about supposedly harmless bomb control operations here in our small town where they did it on a second floor of a shuttered warehouse and had a robot in there with a pipe bomb sitting on top of a beam.
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:36.528]  Really what it is is federalization training.
[01:02:36.528 --> 01:02:38.350]  They sell them on this narrative.
[01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:41.733]  Then the narrative becomes gun owners and people like that.
[01:02:41.733 --> 01:02:45.658]  And it's all about creating this illusion that there's really all these bombs going off.
[01:02:46.567 --> 01:02:55.872]  Yeah, exactly, and I saw the two stories kind of correlate together, and I saw through the illusion that these bomb controls are really for us.
[01:02:55.872 --> 01:03:02.816]  That we're going to go to Home Depot, make fertilizer bombs when we get fed up and we've had enough, and they're ready for it.
[01:03:02.816 --> 01:03:05.337]  And they're letting them know at Home Depot already.
[01:03:05.737 --> 01:03:06.617]  No, that's it.
[01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:24.465]  They're not only going to provocateur events, they know as the banks take everything and destroy the country, some people will actually resist, and so they built the Homeland Security thing for the Muslims and Arabs, but it was always designed for everybody, and now they're changing the narrative over to the American people are terrorists, and anybody that protests is a looter.
[01:03:24.465 --> 01:03:26.126]  And they're selling that idea worldwide.
[01:03:26.126 --> 01:03:28.206]  It's all social engineering laid out.
[01:03:28.206 --> 01:03:30.127]  Great points, Chris.
[01:03:30.127 --> 01:03:31.768]  James in California, you're on the air.
[01:03:34.306 --> 01:03:35.827]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:03:35.827 --> 01:03:36.488]  Good, James.
[01:03:36.488 --> 01:03:39.611]  Welcome.
[01:03:39.611 --> 01:03:50.761]  First of all, man, I just want to congratulate you, man, on being a spearhead in this war against this government, man, because, you know, if don't nobody know what's going on, man, believe me, we do, man.
[01:03:51.263 --> 01:03:52.724]  And we appreciate it, man.
[01:03:52.724 --> 01:03:58.226]  I hear the frustration in your voice sometimes, man, when I hear you talk about how the blacks seem like we're really not paying attention.
[01:03:58.226 --> 01:04:00.387]  But trust me, Alex, we're listening, man.
[01:04:00.387 --> 01:04:03.228]  Well, it's not only some black folks that aren't paying attention.
[01:04:03.228 --> 01:04:04.688]  It's everybody.
[01:04:04.688 --> 01:04:07.089]  It's either folks are awake or they're not awake.
[01:04:07.089 --> 01:04:09.991]  But you're saying folks are starting to wake up?
[01:04:09.991 --> 01:04:10.751]  Right, man.
[01:04:10.751 --> 01:04:12.552]  I'm a former gang member, man.
[01:04:12.552 --> 01:04:14.753]  I was born and raised in Compton, California, man.
[01:04:14.753 --> 01:04:17.114]  So, you know, don't nobody know about the corruption.
[01:04:17.114 --> 01:04:17.834]  Believe me, we do.
[01:04:18.447 --> 01:04:19.468]  You know, we know.
[01:04:19.468 --> 01:04:20.289]  We've been through it.
[01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:21.070]  So, we know.
[01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:25.033]  So, I don't think all blacks are just stuck on Obama, man.
[01:04:25.033 --> 01:04:27.035]  Everybody getting out of that Obama distraction, man.
[01:04:27.035 --> 01:04:28.376]  You know, we know.
[01:04:28.376 --> 01:04:32.781]  We know that, uh, man, Alex, man, it's great to talk to you, man.
[01:04:32.781 --> 01:04:34.062]  It's great to talk to you.
[01:04:34.062 --> 01:04:35.263]  It's the same thing with white folks.
[01:04:35.263 --> 01:04:39.347]  They think Rick Perry's going to save them, and they're all going to get mad at me when I don't like him.
[01:04:40.047 --> 01:04:42.290]  Again, these people are all puppets.
[01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:43.711]  Well, John, keep spreading the word.
[01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:46.754]  Or James, keep spreading the word out there in California.
[01:04:46.754 --> 01:04:47.635]  God bless you.
[01:04:47.635 --> 01:04:48.376]  Call back again.
[01:04:48.376 --> 01:04:49.957]  I'm moving quick here.
[01:04:49.957 --> 01:04:52.780]  John in California, Justin, Michael, you're coming up next.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:58.766]  But first, for about 10 minutes, we've got a great activist on who really caused a stir in New York.
[01:04:58.766 --> 01:04:59.287]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.598 --> 01:05:08.701]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:08.701 --> 01:05:11.242]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:11.242 --> 01:05:16.624]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:16.624 --> 01:05:19.665]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:19.665 --> 01:05:21.726]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:21.986 --> 01:05:28.231]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.231 --> 01:05:31.613]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.613 --> 01:05:37.397]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:37.397 --> 01:05:39.038]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:39.038 --> 01:05:40.339]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:40.339 --> 01:05:43.001]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:43.001 --> 01:05:47.244]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:49.266]  You can find the video at www.
[01:05:50.026 --> 01:05:51.847]  End of America 3.com.
[01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:54.428]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:06:00.612 --> 01:06:03.954]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:06:03.954 --> 01:06:08.556]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long-term storable food business.
[01:06:08.556 --> 01:06:16.000]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price in 1981.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.281]  For a limited time, you get 30% off
[01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:20.182]  I think so.
[01:06:37.315 --> 01:06:37.835]  I think so.
[01:07:01.388 --> 01:07:05.392]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:05.392 --> 01:07:08.636]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:08.636 --> 01:07:13.461]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:13.461 --> 01:07:19.848]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:19.848 --> 01:07:22.091]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:22.611 --> 01:07:22.911]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:22.911 --> 01:07:23.171]  Bernanke?
[01:07:23.171 --> 01:07:23.772]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:23.772 --> 01:07:25.193]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:25.193 --> 01:07:27.614]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:41.502 --> 01:07:43.644]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:43.644 --> 01:07:48.787]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:48.787 --> 01:07:58.154]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:08.794]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.794 --> 01:08:16.978]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.978 --> 01:08:23.042]  Coming up, the Prime Minister of England suggests purple rain for rioters.
[01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:24.943]  Spring dye on them so they can be
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:31.743]  Targeted later, that was pioneered by Apartheid South Africa.
[01:08:31.743 --> 01:08:38.027]  UK riots, government moles, kill switch for Twitter and Facebook, army on the streets.
[01:08:38.027 --> 01:08:45.492]  So Twitter refused to shut down the accounts of people actually calling for crimes and violence individually.
[01:08:45.492 --> 01:08:50.936]  So now you see everybody gets to have their basic rights taken for no reason.
[01:08:51.536 --> 01:08:53.377]  That's why they let terrorists attack us.
[01:08:53.377 --> 01:08:55.317]  That's why they finance terrorists to attack us.
[01:08:55.317 --> 01:08:58.038]  That's why corporations stage terror attacks.
[01:08:58.038 --> 01:09:01.579]  Government has been caught over and over again doing it.
[01:09:01.579 --> 01:09:11.843]  And then you're looked at like you're crazy or you're somehow bad if you point out that government stands to gain from terror as a pretext to take our liberties.
[01:09:11.843 --> 01:09:17.365]  Also, feds send terrorist handouts to military surplus stores.
[01:09:17.365 --> 01:09:18.625]  Kurt Nimmo's got an article on that.
[01:09:18.625 --> 01:09:19.906]  We'll tell you more about what that means.
[01:09:24.264 --> 01:09:30.229]  That's right, they're saying that you're basically a terrorist if you go to the army surplus store.
[01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:42.039]  Amazon disarms Brits by banning self-defense items like baseball bats because record sales of baseball bats were made in England predominantly over Amazon with people seeking to defend themselves.
[01:09:42.039 --> 01:09:46.242]  That's just some of the news as well.
[01:09:46.242 --> 01:09:48.844]  Also, the videos are being released from Chicago.
[01:09:49.725 --> 01:09:58.049]  And Milwaukee, and other areas, and they are showing that many of these are racial attacks that are happening.
[01:09:58.049 --> 01:10:06.394]  And people are so politically correct that you're not supposed to talk about the fact that there is some uptick in black-on-white violence.
[01:10:06.394 --> 01:10:08.875]  We need to ask, why is that happening?
[01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:18.100]  We need to point out that that's wrong, just like when white gangs from time to time have attacked groups of black people.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:25.883]  It needs to be decried, just like the mayor of Philadelphia said, who is black, he came out and said it was wrong.
[01:10:25.883 --> 01:10:32.686]  But if you won't criticize it, and the police won't do anything about it, it will get out of control.
[01:10:32.686 --> 01:10:38.929]  I'll guarantee you can go find white gangs in America, that if they were allowed to go out and beat up black people, they would go out and do it.
[01:10:39.918 --> 01:10:43.381]  See, if it's seen as okay to attack a certain group, it's done.
[01:10:43.381 --> 01:10:50.248]  That's why for decades, gays have been, quote, rolled all over the country.
[01:10:50.248 --> 01:10:55.693]  Folks will go to areas where gays congregate and beat them and rob them.
[01:10:56.994 --> 01:11:00.196]  Because, well, they're gay, so they deserve to be attacked.
[01:11:00.196 --> 01:11:01.937]  And that's why they call for hate crime laws.
[01:11:01.937 --> 01:11:02.938]  Well, no.
[01:11:02.938 --> 01:11:11.442]  If you just enforce the law that assaulting anyone is a serious crime if it's not in self-defense, you don't need a thought crime law.
[01:11:11.442 --> 01:11:12.763]  But see, under political correctness,
[01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:17.935]  If you attack a, quote, protected group, then they throw the book at you.
[01:11:17.935 --> 01:11:23.481]  But if it's blacks attacking whites, then nothing's done, and it's being green-lighted.
[01:11:23.481 --> 01:11:25.002]  And so now that's being confirmed.
[01:11:25.002 --> 01:11:29.868]  I want to get into that a little bit more later.
[01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:35.214]  Also continuing with some of the news here.
[01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:39.412]  We've got incredible financial news coming out.
[01:11:39.412 --> 01:11:43.194]  Trade deficit soars to highest since 2008.
[01:11:43.194 --> 01:11:48.298]  Jobless $395,000 last week, updated to $420,000.
[01:11:48.298 --> 01:11:57.784]  It is absolutely incredible what's happening right now and it's all at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and also DrudgeReport.com.
[01:11:59.656 --> 01:12:07.199]  Now, I wanted to spend a segment or two with our next guest, and we've got his video posted at InfoWars.com if you're a radio listener.
[01:12:07.199 --> 01:12:15.902]  We're going to play some of it here in a moment for audio listeners to hear it, but also for viewers at PrisonPlanet.tv to see it.
[01:12:15.902 --> 01:12:28.306]  Danny Penzella is an example of someone actually targeting the real criminals, not going and burning down a warehouse or a furniture store, not carjacking someone.
[01:12:29.704 --> 01:12:36.148]  But actually going and peacefully protesting the private Federal Reserve parasite in New York City.
[01:12:36.148 --> 01:12:52.178]  And that's why it's come out now that the Pentagon Homeland Security is watching and tracking anyone that criticizes the Federal Reserve as a chilling effect and deploying police and even military in some cases at in the Fed peaceful rallies.
[01:12:52.178 --> 01:12:53.378]  This goes back three years.
[01:12:53.378 --> 01:12:55.980]  We cover it in my film, The Obama Deception.
[01:12:57.501 --> 01:13:04.924]  Danny, a few days before he went down there, called for a protest at the New York Fed.
[01:13:04.924 --> 01:13:11.886]  Now, because he's an activist who has a small site, it didn't get a big response.
[01:13:11.886 --> 01:13:20.269]  He was the only person, an army of one, who showed up with his child in the baby stroller.
[01:13:22.313 --> 01:13:25.775]  And he walked up and they had police every five feet.
[01:13:25.775 --> 01:13:33.018]  You can watch the video at InfoWars.com in the 9-11 section, in the banking section.
[01:13:33.018 --> 01:13:37.900]  In fact, I forget what section it's in.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.441]  Here's the headline if you want to find it.
[01:13:39.441 --> 01:13:43.123]  Police surround New York Federal Reserve after in the Fed flash mob.
[01:13:43.123 --> 01:13:47.845]  Facebook post, Danny Panzella, True Squad TV.
[01:13:47.845 --> 01:13:50.246]  So that's how you can find it right there.
[01:13:53.641 --> 01:14:12.565]  Now, this is an example of how all over the United States, LA riots, Katrina, examples decades ago or just five years ago, you will see the police not show up, the military not show up, when it's a big political event, they're ordered to stand down.
[01:14:12.565 --> 01:14:15.885]  Now, if you're being mugged at your house, cops a lot of times show up really quick.
[01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:17.205]  Sometimes they can't.
[01:14:17.205 --> 01:14:19.386]  That's why you need a Second Amendment to defend yourself.
[01:14:20.166 --> 01:14:30.391]  But the issue here is that when it's the Federal Reserve, the real criminal, fraudster, hijacker, owners of America, they do show up.
[01:14:30.391 --> 01:14:36.995]  And it's an incredible image of the giant Federal Reserve building in New York, built like a fortress with giant bars on the windows.
[01:14:39.068 --> 01:14:45.753]  Had police every five feet all the way around it, and Danny comes up and says, why are you here?
[01:14:45.753 --> 01:14:50.177]  And they say, oh, there was going to be a flash mob, but nobody showed up.
[01:14:50.177 --> 01:14:53.740]  And then Danny laughs and goes ahead and hands out his flyers.
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:57.383]  So the issue is, this is the real establishment.
[01:14:57.383 --> 01:14:59.264]  This is who needs to be identified.
[01:14:59.264 --> 01:15:04.889]  Not their puppet Obama, not their puppet Mitt Romney, their puppet George W. Bush, James Cameron.
[01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.370]  Markel
[01:15:25.364 --> 01:15:30.705]  In getting anybody to show up, but you succeeded by stepping up to the plate and so you won.
[01:15:30.705 --> 01:15:32.266]  Resistance is victory.
[01:15:32.266 --> 01:15:37.947]  And you illustrated how scared to death they are of peaceful people simply protesting the real power.
[01:15:37.947 --> 01:15:46.768]  And it shows it is the real power that if you're going to protest or going to burn somebody's shop, cops don't show up.
[01:15:46.768 --> 01:15:49.449]  But if you go to peacefully protest the real criminals, they do.
[01:15:51.204 --> 01:15:54.025]  Absolutely, thanks Alex, that was a great introduction.
[01:15:54.025 --> 01:16:10.492]  Yeah, I mean, I think it's interesting that the police, when I got there, I walked right up to them, I shook their hands, I introduced myself, I said, I'm the flash mob you guys are waiting for, and they laughed it off because they thought I was trying to get rid of them so that the real mob could show up.
[01:16:10.492 --> 01:16:14.654]  You know, they just were expecting some kind of violent mob, and I even said to them, I said, you know,
[01:16:15.274 --> 01:16:16.535]  This is a fortress here.
[01:16:16.535 --> 01:16:19.716]  How could you even be worried about it?
[01:16:19.716 --> 01:16:24.657]  That all this police response to a Facebook post is just, it's silly.
[01:16:24.657 --> 01:16:27.158]  Well, you notice that building was built, what, in the 20s?
[01:16:27.158 --> 01:16:28.459]  It is a fortress.
[01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:32.780]  And all their buildings have moats around them or giant walls.
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:35.241]  The one in Dallas has parapets around it.
[01:16:35.241 --> 01:16:38.742]  I mean, they've been getting ready for what they've set up for a long time.
[01:16:38.742 --> 01:16:40.083]  That's why they're armored fortresses.
[01:16:41.348 --> 01:16:42.769]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:16:42.769 --> 01:16:52.675]  And you know, I think that the big issue here, for me, being a New Yorker, obviously the Fed and the Federal Reserve System is a big issue for the whole country.
[01:16:52.675 --> 01:17:00.299]  But the fact that they're using the NYPD, you know, they have their own Federal Reserve Police, but now they're using the NYPD.
[01:17:00.299 --> 01:17:03.942]  And it's funny that one of the, either a lieutenant or captain, had said to me,
[01:17:04.902 --> 01:17:07.885]  Yeah, you know, some people, they want to get their money's worth.
[01:17:07.885 --> 01:17:10.147]  So I'm curious who exactly he meant by that.
[01:17:10.147 --> 01:17:12.929]  Was that the Federal Reserve looking to get their money's worth?
[01:17:12.929 --> 01:17:20.915]  Was that the federal government, who we know gives grants to the NYPD to implement their policies?
[01:17:20.915 --> 01:17:25.599]  The NYPD has hired Rand Corporation to develop policies for them.
[01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:27.481]  So I'm curious exactly who he meant.
[01:17:27.481 --> 01:17:29.002]  I mean, I guess it's all the same in the end.
[01:17:29.282 --> 01:17:39.067]  Well, we know crime has exploded in New York and other areas, and I see reports all the time about women raped, mugged, in broad daylight, in even nice areas, the police won't come.
[01:17:39.067 --> 01:17:52.615]  You know, the police should be in Central Park dealing with crime, but you notice they're always there getting in the face of peaceful, political demonstrations, and this really illustrates these are the owners of America, and that's why they were there.
[01:17:53.496 --> 01:17:55.837]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:57.558]  It's really disgraceful.
[01:17:57.558 --> 01:18:11.043]  And you know, the Daily News reported yesterday that, I don't know if you saw this yet, that the NYPD has unveiled its social networking task force where they're going to be monitoring social networking as well.
[01:18:11.043 --> 01:18:18.646]  So here we have, I was able to break this story about a month early before the police admitted it, that they're actually, and we know that this is under federal directive,
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:20.861]  Well, absolutely.
[01:18:20.861 --> 01:18:30.207]  I did see the report, but really what's happening here, illustrated by Twitter, refusing to shut down accounts that were saying, let's meet and burn this down, let's meet and rob these people.
[01:18:30.207 --> 01:18:32.308]  Clearly criminal activity.
[01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:37.111]  The police have a direct line to the IP address, where to go arrest them, doing nothing.
[01:18:37.111 --> 01:18:42.775]  The police say, oh, we stood down for four days, but will you shut these people down?
[01:18:42.775 --> 01:18:44.096]  Twitter says no.
[01:18:44.096 --> 01:18:49.400]  So David Cameron comes out today and says, we want a total kill switch now over Twitter.
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:52.161]  Just like Egypt used.
[01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:54.062]  And so now they'll selectively do it.
[01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:59.285]  When it's their political mob that Al Gore called for in Arab Spring, they'll be left alone.
[01:18:59.285 --> 01:19:01.907]  But when it's us using it peacefully, we'll be shut down.
[01:19:03.055 --> 01:19:03.955]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:03.955 --> 01:19:04.696]  And what does this do?
[01:19:04.696 --> 01:19:09.337]  This really has a chilling effect on free speech and freedom of assembly.
[01:19:09.337 --> 01:19:26.003]  You know, there might be people that will see these types of things, and that's why I really wanted to illustrate in my video that if you just go and you form a rapport with the police and you kind of just show them that you're not a threat, you're no physical threat, you're just there to educate people, then that will counteract what the system is trying to do.
[01:19:26.003 --> 01:19:32.465]  Because I don't want people to be intimidated by the fact that, you know, they're doing this and then not show up to a protest.
[01:19:32.765 --> 01:19:33.305]  Well, that's right.
[01:19:33.305 --> 01:19:42.970]  They're trying to sell the idea that protesting is burning, looting, and killing, and that's why they stood down in London, stood down in Seattle when their hired thugs got the party started.
[01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:47.952]  I want to come back and talk to you about picking today, tomorrow, whenever's good for you.
[01:19:47.952 --> 01:19:50.073]  I'm ready to try to help you.
[01:19:50.073 --> 01:19:53.754]  Let's get 500 to 1,000 people down there for a real event.
[01:19:53.754 --> 01:19:57.896]  Let's pick this tomorrow afternoon if you want.
[01:19:57.896 --> 01:19:59.717]  When we come back, we'll also play a clip.
[01:20:00.956 --> 01:20:04.117]  Why is it so many people suffer from so many illnesses today?
[01:20:04.117 --> 01:20:05.978]  Why don't doctors know how to help you?
[01:20:05.978 --> 01:20:11.679]  Could it be that our doctors don't know how because there's a nutrition solution and they only know about drugs?
[01:20:11.679 --> 01:20:15.961]  Over 68 diseases are known to be connected to a deficiency of glutathione.
[01:20:15.961 --> 01:20:20.382]  The missing ingredient to increasing your body's production of glutathione is cysteine.
[01:20:20.862 --> 01:20:33.708]  Raising your glutathione production protects you from cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
[01:20:33.708 --> 01:20:36.670]  Nature's richest source of cysteine is unheated whey.
[01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:39.472]  Heating can damage much of the cysteine.
[01:20:39.472 --> 01:20:43.294]  One World Whey is the first undamaged whey protein powder on the market.
[01:20:43.294 --> 01:20:49.719]  Using One World Whey may support optimal glutathione production unlike any other food or supplement you've ever taken.
[01:20:49.719 --> 01:20:50.219]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:20:50.219 --> 01:20:50.460]  That's 888-988-3325.

[01:22:30.103 --> 01:22:31.344]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.344 --> 01:22:35.908]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.908 --> 01:22:41.713]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:22:41.713 --> 01:22:45.096]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.356 --> 01:22:50.222]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.222 --> 01:22:53.126]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:53.126 --> 01:22:53.426]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.426 --> 01:22:54.788]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.695 --> 01:23:01.516]  Question.
[01:23:01.516 --> 01:23:06.120]  Can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our minds?
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:11.825]  Author Jose Calazo answers yes in his two new books, America's New Slavery.
[01:23:11.825 --> 01:23:17.349]  For more than 13 years, author Jose Calazo has been trying to prove that the U.S.
[01:23:17.349 --> 01:23:22.434]  government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology
[01:23:22.754 --> 01:23:29.238]  Known as FMRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and there is proof that it exists.
[01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:36.003]  America's New Slavery explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security.
[01:23:36.003 --> 01:23:37.604]  Who has access to it?
[01:23:37.604 --> 01:23:39.025]  How is it being used?
[01:23:39.025 --> 01:23:42.347]  Does America's salvation rest in this technology?
[01:23:42.347 --> 01:23:49.032]  These and many other questions are answered in America's New Slavery, the new books by Jose Collazo.
[01:23:49.452 --> 01:23:54.715]  Available on BN.com, Amazon.com, and Borders.com.
[01:23:54.715 --> 01:23:56.816]  America's New Slavery.
[01:23:56.816 --> 01:24:05.741]  All Americans should be concerned.
[01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:08.142]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:24:08.142 --> 01:24:10.864]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:12.532 --> 01:24:18.017]  Your calls and a ton of key news coming up in the next 30 minutes after this short segment.
[01:24:18.017 --> 01:24:27.324]  Then we're going to get into, well, a discussion of talk radio and communications and how to really get the word out on more AM and FM stations.
[01:24:27.324 --> 01:24:36.252]  We'll also discuss how the media has changed with Michael Zwirling, who is an independent radio station operator out in California.
[01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:45.079]  Now, if you want to watch the video in its entirely, it's in the US News section of Infowars.com.
[01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:56.347]  Police surround New York Federal Reserve after in the Fed flash mob Facebook protest and Danny Panzella is our guest right now.
[01:24:57.448 --> 01:24:58.509]  And I had the idea.
[01:24:58.509 --> 01:25:00.551]  I said, how about we have a demonstration?
[01:25:00.551 --> 01:25:03.494]  And I said, when is a good time, Danny?
[01:25:03.494 --> 01:25:06.197]  And he said, well, four o'clock's when Wall Street lets out.
[01:25:06.197 --> 01:25:11.242]  And you can really talk to the traders.
[01:25:11.242 --> 01:25:11.662]  Boy, that's a...
[01:25:12.645 --> 01:25:14.067]  That's a pun intended.
[01:25:14.067 --> 01:25:27.523]  You can talk to the Federal Reserve low-level minions coming out of the private cancer that is the seat of evil here in the United States, the Bank of England arm known as the New York Fed.
[01:25:27.523 --> 01:25:31.607]  So we're going to have a spontaneous demonstration.
[01:25:33.277 --> 01:25:37.481]  And again, this won't save the world, but resistance to tyranny will.
[01:25:37.481 --> 01:25:49.413]  And then you'll shoot YouTube videos, you'll post them, hundreds of thousands will see it, then they'll get the idea to protest their Fed in their area, instead of going and protesting the puppet Obama, which then everybody just ignores.
[01:25:49.413 --> 01:25:52.456]  It's these types of events that actually get attention.
[01:25:53.337 --> 01:25:55.298]  So, everybody, 4 to 6 tomorrow.
[01:25:55.298 --> 01:25:58.060]  Try to get there at 4, but if you can't, 5, 6 o'clock.
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.601]  4 to 6, New York Federal Reserve.
[01:26:00.601 --> 01:26:12.948]  Let's play a clip of Danny going up and the entire building being surrounded by police guarding their banker owners from the evil people that would criticize the foreign criminals.
[01:26:12.948 --> 01:26:13.328]  Here it is.
[01:26:13.908 --> 01:26:15.009]  Have the feds around it?
[01:26:15.009 --> 01:26:17.551]  You guys usually have the feds around it?
[01:26:17.551 --> 01:26:19.913]  Nah, we're just here for today.
[01:26:19.913 --> 01:26:20.894]  Something special going on.
[01:26:20.894 --> 01:26:22.996]  Something special going on?
[01:26:22.996 --> 01:26:24.077]  Don't work uptown.
[01:26:24.077 --> 01:26:29.762]  I don't know why.
[01:26:29.762 --> 01:26:31.523]  This cop says flash mob.
[01:26:31.523 --> 01:26:33.965]  You guys got the feds around it?
[01:26:33.965 --> 01:26:35.046]  That's not normal.
[01:26:35.046 --> 01:26:36.747]  Just a drill.
[01:26:36.747 --> 01:26:38.629]  Just a drill.
[01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:39.450]  Cop said just a drill.
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:42.641]  What's going on today?
[01:26:42.641 --> 01:26:43.962]  They don't usually have the feds around.
[01:26:43.962 --> 01:26:45.723]  I thought it was going to be a flash mob.
[01:26:45.723 --> 01:26:50.067]  No, it was going to be a flash mob today, but they never showed up.
[01:26:50.067 --> 01:26:52.449]  And then here's this little Facebook posting.
[01:26:52.449 --> 01:26:57.133]  And by little, I'm not belittling it, I'm saying that's how big things start.
[01:26:57.133 --> 01:27:01.938]  Like Luke Rodowski literally had almost no support, no followers, came on this show.
[01:27:02.478 --> 01:27:10.240]  He was oppressed by the police, threatened, people witnessed it, so they went and supported him, and now hundreds of groups worldwide educating folks.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:14.721]  And I hope that's what comes out of this, going down there with his young son.
[01:27:14.721 --> 01:27:18.301]  Danny Penzella, thank you so much for what you've done.
[01:27:18.301 --> 01:27:29.944]  Folks can watch the full video again at TruthSquadTV or at InfoWars.com, but I hope to see at least 200, 300 people spontaneously join you down there tomorrow at 4.
[01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:30.864]  Any final comments?
[01:27:31.824 --> 01:27:35.845]  Yeah, you know, I wanted to mention the compartmentalization that you could see with the cops.
[01:27:35.845 --> 01:27:40.707]  As I approached each one, and they had different ranks, one guy had no idea why he was there.
[01:27:40.707 --> 01:27:42.187]  The other guy thought it was a drill.
[01:27:42.187 --> 01:27:46.868]  And then finally, the lieutenant was the one who actually knew, you know, what was going on.
[01:27:46.868 --> 01:27:55.371]  So you could just see how they used the compartmentalization to keep the police going forward with an agenda that's clearly unconstitutional.
[01:27:56.601 --> 01:28:05.226]  Well, they certainly do, and it's that very Federal Reserve that's the consortium for the megabanks that are destroying those officers' future and the value of their dollar.
[01:28:05.226 --> 01:28:12.170]  I mean, there are the criminals, and there's a great example of compartmentalization with the police there, en masse, protecting their kings.
[01:28:12.170 --> 01:28:22.697]  Earlier in the video, if we can back it up and find the spot and just show the image for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, radio listeners can go watch it on the websites TruthSquadTV and InfoWars.com.
[01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:24.158]  But if you watch the video,
[01:28:24.918 --> 01:28:29.681]  What, about every five feet there's a cop stationed all the way around the building?
[01:28:29.681 --> 01:28:32.643]  Yeah, yeah, they were all around all four blocks.
[01:28:32.643 --> 01:28:39.707]  I walked, it's not in the video, but I walked all four blocks around the Fed and they were surrounding the whole building.
[01:28:39.707 --> 01:28:45.830]  Yeah, in some areas the video looks like every five feet, in other areas about every 15, but just incredible.
[01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:48.572]  How many police total, hundreds?
[01:28:48.572 --> 01:28:52.354]  I would say there were probably about 40 spanning the whole four blocks.
[01:28:53.407 --> 01:28:54.888]  Four blocks surrounding.
[01:28:54.888 --> 01:28:56.769]  Well, you know they'll be out there tomorrow.
[01:28:56.769 --> 01:28:58.330]  And I can hear your child in the background.
[01:28:58.330 --> 01:28:59.810]  Is it a boy or a girl?
[01:28:59.810 --> 01:29:00.371]  It's a boy.
[01:29:00.371 --> 01:29:01.551]  That's Xander.
[01:29:01.551 --> 01:29:09.135]  Well, hopefully he's going to have a future because his daddy will dare go point out the emperor has no clothes.
[01:29:09.135 --> 01:29:10.736]  And thank you so much for what you're doing.
[01:29:10.736 --> 01:29:12.237]  I hope folks will join you tomorrow.
[01:29:12.237 --> 01:29:14.078]  Tell folks the street address so they don't know where it is.
[01:29:14.918 --> 01:29:18.619]  It's 33 Liberty Street, down in the Wall Street area.
[01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:21.199]  And Alex, if I could just real quick, I'd like to plug.
[01:29:21.199 --> 01:29:24.820]  I'm hosting Liberty Fest New York City on September 10th.
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:26.960]  And it's LFNYC.com.
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:32.902]  We're having Richard Gage, Gary Franchi, Peter Schiff, a whole bunch of guests.
[01:29:32.902 --> 01:29:34.782]  We actually, I sent you an invitation.
[01:29:34.782 --> 01:29:37.323]  You know, I know you said you weren't going to be able to make it to New York.
[01:29:37.323 --> 01:29:38.023]  You're welcome.
[01:29:38.023 --> 01:29:39.663]  Jesse Ventura might be coming.
[01:29:39.663 --> 01:29:42.324]  So, we just hope everybody... Well, let me call Jesse today.
[01:29:42.324 --> 01:29:43.684]  I'm supposed to call him anyways.
[01:29:44.284 --> 01:29:45.305]  And we'll see about that.
[01:29:45.305 --> 01:29:46.885]  But we're gonna watch what happens tomorrow.
[01:29:46.885 --> 01:29:48.886]  Everybody get out there and join Danny.
[01:29:48.886 --> 01:29:51.087]  We'll be right back with the news.
[01:29:51.087 --> 01:29:52.488]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.488 --> 01:29:55.009]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.009 --> 01:29:57.691]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:03.561]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:03.561 --> 01:30:08.864]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:30:08.864 --> 01:30:10.405]  Saving means to make money.
[01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:19.190]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:27.452]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:30:27.452 --> 01:30:35.455]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:30:35.455 --> 01:30:42.857]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:30:45.618 --> 01:30:48.841]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:30:48.841 --> 01:30:51.223]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:30:51.223 --> 01:30:53.345]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:31:00.387 --> 01:31:04.930]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.930 --> 01:31:05.850]  Number one.
[01:31:05.850 --> 01:31:09.273]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.273 --> 01:31:10.133]  Number two.
[01:31:10.133 --> 01:31:15.036]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.036 --> 01:31:15.777]  It's true.
[01:31:15.777 --> 01:31:20.640]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:21.460]  Number three.
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:25.063]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.063 --> 01:31:28.745]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.965 --> 01:31:29.746]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.746 --> 01:31:32.509]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.509 --> 01:31:36.193]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.193 --> 01:31:36.994]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.994 --> 01:31:41.139]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.139 --> 01:31:45.904]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.184 --> 01:31:50.347]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.347 --> 01:31:52.148]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:52.148 --> 01:31:54.369]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:54.369 --> 01:31:57.011]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:57.011 --> 01:32:07.277]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:32:07.277 --> 01:32:12.420]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:14.301]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:16.505 --> 01:32:27.157]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[01:32:29.642 --> 01:32:34.226]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:32:34.226 --> 01:32:38.068]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:32:38.068 --> 01:32:39.309]  Others don't.
[01:32:39.309 --> 01:32:41.451]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:41.451 --> 01:32:43.232]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:43.232 --> 01:32:46.114]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:46.114 --> 01:32:52.739]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:52.739 --> 01:32:55.441]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:32:55.441 --> 01:32:57.823]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[01:32:57.823 --> 01:32:58.303]  Others don't.
[01:33:06.026 --> 01:33:12.078]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:12.078 --> 01:33:14.602]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:32.208 --> 01:33:38.688]  Okay, I've got a giant stack of the latest financial news, riot news, police state news.

[01:35:21.381 --> 01:35:22.302]  What am I going to say about it?
[01:35:24.519 --> 01:35:32.182]  Every subject in the world at PrisonPlanet.TV, every issue has been covered in eight years.
[01:35:32.182 --> 01:35:48.849]  And all my films, other films have been authorized to post, my book, Paul Watson's book, the special nightly news reports that go out live that are archived there, soon the nightly news report starting September 1st, it's all at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:35:48.849 --> 01:35:53.531]  And next week, ahead of the new TV show, we're going to launch
[01:35:55.134 --> 01:35:59.560]  PrisonPlanet.tv forward slash rants.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:00.280]  It isn't up yet.
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:01.522]  You'll see it soon.
[01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:05.687]  And PrisonPlanet.tv forward slash news.
[01:36:05.687 --> 01:36:07.429]  And these are whole new
[01:36:08.695 --> 01:36:27.428]  Updated pages where you'll have the nightly news reports, you'll have the special reports, you'll have rants where I upload rants or do live rants or live reports from my home, from on the road, when I'm on vacation, all the stuff you've been seeing at YouTube, you're going to see it at PrisonPlanet.TV.

[01:36:29.929 --> 01:36:35.753]  And it is your memberships at PrisonPlanet.TV that make this radio show possible.
[01:36:35.753 --> 01:36:38.095]  And I want to thank all of you for supporting us.
[01:36:38.976 --> 01:36:45.017]  Also, it's been very stressful getting ready for the new TV show.
[01:36:46.338 --> 01:36:54.985]  And we've almost got it basically boiled down and programmed, as they say, for the nightly show.
[01:36:54.985 --> 01:36:59.749]  The crew has been staying, I'd say, two, three nights a week until 10 or later.
[01:36:59.749 --> 01:37:13.180]  We're all very tired, and we're really dedicating ourselves to this because we realize how serious the times are we live in, and that it's just going to get crazier from here on out, as I've been warning you.
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:20.085]  That said, I have gotten very tired.
[01:37:20.085 --> 01:37:27.250]  And I need to take off three or four days before I launch the TV show so I can really be crisp for it.
[01:37:27.250 --> 01:37:32.895]  Also, after years and years of broadcasting and screaming and going to rallies, my voice is tired.
[01:37:32.895 --> 01:37:35.077]  I've never experienced where my voice itself
[01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:42.359]  It's hard to speak sometimes and I hope people will bear with me on that.
[01:37:42.359 --> 01:37:52.083]  I cannot go to rallies anymore where you're not allowed to have a bullhorn and scream for two, three hours at the top of my lungs or I'll lose my voice.
[01:37:52.083 --> 01:37:54.383]  I've never gone to a speech coach.
[01:37:54.383 --> 01:37:55.464]  I've never gone to a
[01:37:57.318 --> 01:37:59.419]  I've never gone to a speech therapist.
[01:37:59.419 --> 01:38:01.500]  I've never had my larynx checked.
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:06.682]  I know I've screamed so loud before that I've coughed up blood and lacerated my larynx.
[01:38:06.682 --> 01:38:09.963]  And so I've got to stop.
[01:38:09.963 --> 01:38:12.784]  And I am extremely tired right now.
[01:38:12.784 --> 01:38:14.104]  I feel completely drained.
[01:38:14.104 --> 01:38:16.905]  I'm not complaining.
[01:38:16.905 --> 01:38:17.826]  It's just that
[01:38:19.775 --> 01:38:35.061]  I'm going to run a rebroadcast Sunday and I'm going to try to just sleep and exercise and read and try to reset because I've got to rest a little before what's coming.
[01:38:35.061 --> 01:38:38.082]  The problem is every subject, every news item, I want to cover it.
[01:38:39.251 --> 01:38:41.272]  Every issue has hundreds of angles to it.
[01:38:41.272 --> 01:38:46.113]  I want to try to relay my analysis or impart my information.
[01:38:46.113 --> 01:38:55.154]  And I do realize that I've got to pace myself, because it's not the rabbit that wins the race, it's the tortoise.
[01:38:55.154 --> 01:39:00.536]  And we've done incredible things together, but folks can look at me until I'm tired.
[01:39:05.052 --> 01:39:14.757]  I am drained, but I've taken week-long vacations before, maybe once a year, and I really do come back refreshed, and I've got to take one.
[01:39:14.757 --> 01:39:17.158]  I don't know what I'm going to do, but I may.
[01:39:17.158 --> 01:39:27.183]  The problem is so much is happening, and then if there's news going on, I don't end up resting, and I'm calling into my own show and working and sending my reporters news and information.
[01:39:27.183 --> 01:39:29.084]  They all need vacations as well.
[01:39:30.304 --> 01:39:36.026]  We've tried to hire new people, we've tried to find quality people, and that's a huge hassle, as you know, than training people.
[01:39:36.026 --> 01:39:38.467]  I'm not complaining, it's just going to the next level.
[01:39:38.467 --> 01:39:40.508]  We know it's our responsibility.
[01:39:40.508 --> 01:39:47.611]  And when I go to your calls, please don't thank me and don't say, oh Alex, you know, take time off.
[01:39:47.611 --> 01:39:56.615]  I just tend to sometimes talk off the top of my head and really just tell you what I'm believing and what I'm thinking.
[01:39:56.615 --> 01:39:56.795]  But...
[01:40:01.378 --> 01:40:06.740]  I, again, at 5 o'clock today I'm going to have unlimited energy.
[01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:07.921]  It's like weird.
[01:40:07.921 --> 01:40:22.787]  Once I get burnout, I have explosions of energy and then can't stop working and then I have no energy and it's like a, instead of just a good, even keeled, continual energy that I've always had until the last year or so,
[01:40:25.271 --> 01:40:35.219]  And I'll take vitamins, I'll take minerals and suddenly I'll have energy and then I'll forget to take the shakes, I'll forget to take the minerals like I've done for the last two weeks and then I'll get exhausted.
[01:40:35.219 --> 01:40:37.901]  So that's an issue there as well.
[01:40:37.901 --> 01:40:44.146]  But we really are bashing our brains out around here and working our fingers to the bone to fight the globalists.
[01:40:44.146 --> 01:40:47.629]  And you can see the result of it.
[01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:51.552]  Thanks for all of you spreading the word about the broadcast and just the incredible job you've done.
[01:40:52.273 --> 01:40:55.057]  And I'm so thankful to all of our AM and FM affiliates.
[01:40:55.057 --> 01:40:56.899]  I'm so thankful to all of our sponsors.
[01:40:56.899 --> 01:41:02.086]  I'm so thankful to my great crew and the work that they're doing.
[01:41:02.086 --> 01:41:06.032]  We couldn't do any of this, any of this without you.
[01:41:07.492 --> 01:41:13.815]  And I think of how exhausting it is to really be informed and really be well-researched.
[01:41:13.815 --> 01:41:19.237]  And then I, because of the research, I know that we're going to look back on this time, as I said a year ago.
[01:41:19.237 --> 01:41:23.439]  I said, a year from now, you'll look back on all the crazy stuff happening, and this will seem tame.
[01:41:23.439 --> 01:41:33.864]  And we'll look back a year from now on August 11, 2011, and we will think it was a cakewalk, a tea party, a walk in the park.
[01:41:36.542 --> 01:41:42.931]  And I just, if people would just wake up to The Globalist, this nightmare could be turned around.
[01:41:42.931 --> 01:41:44.693]  And I have faith people are going to wake up.
[01:41:44.693 --> 01:41:52.564]  The problem is the social engineers know you're waking up and know you've woken up, so they've put a very serious control grid in place.
[01:41:53.725 --> 01:42:03.974]  To try to block us and if anybody questions that and doesn't know history just watch the dramas and sitcoms It is laced with anti-freedom messages.
[01:42:03.974 --> 01:42:20.229]  It is laced with demonization of people that are awake and My heart shudders Not in fear, but with disgust at what we're gonna have to go through and I think that's another reason that I have such a weight on me now and
[01:42:21.994 --> 01:42:26.737]  Is that decade ago I hated the globalists and it was a warm fire.
[01:42:26.737 --> 01:42:31.940]  And the last ten years I do what I do for love.
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:42.866]  And just the darkness and the endless energy and the enjoyment of evil that the globalists exhibit disgusts me.
[01:42:42.866 --> 01:42:47.689]  And it's almost like a curse to
[01:42:49.352 --> 01:43:03.530]  To know the mind of the globalist and to just wish that people could wake up, spend time, and discover that I'm not lying to you.
[01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:06.554]  Discover that in fact it's worse than I can even tell you.
[01:43:07.947 --> 01:43:17.496]  Everyone should have a fire in their belly, a burning, driving, animating desire to resist thugs, bullies, and scum of every permutation.
[01:43:17.496 --> 01:43:19.058]  Alright, I said to go to your calls.
[01:43:19.058 --> 01:43:22.902]  I do need to thank the sponsors as well that also make the broadcast possible.

[01:44:51.289 --> 01:44:55.531]  Okay, uh, that said, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[01:44:55.531 --> 01:44:57.812]  John in California, thanks for holding.
[01:44:57.812 --> 01:44:59.673]  You're on the air.
[01:44:59.673 --> 01:45:01.873]  Alex, thank you so much for taking my call.
[01:45:01.873 --> 01:45:02.674]  Thanks for calling, buddy.
[01:45:02.674 --> 01:45:04.635]  What's on your mind?
[01:45:04.635 --> 01:45:08.636]  Well, um, first I gotta thank my wife, Letty, for turning me on to the show.
[01:45:08.636 --> 01:45:12.238]  She found your show about seven or eight months ago and we've been listening ever since.
[01:45:12.238 --> 01:45:12.838]  Really awesome.
[01:45:13.591 --> 01:45:23.038]  Um, secondly, I want to speak about a story that hits close to home, and that's the Rawsome Raw Food Raid.
[01:45:23.038 --> 01:45:27.941]  I wanted to see if you would address the other side of the story.
[01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:32.352]  Just all the back story.
[01:45:32.352 --> 01:45:41.040]  There's a whole other side of the story that hasn't been addressed by Mike Adams or yourself and I was really hoping... The point is they're rating dairies too.
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:52.131]  I mean, you can go to Whole Foods' website, type in Whole Foods raw milk cheese and on their fact sheet they go, of course it's legal, most of our cheese is raw milk cheese.
[01:45:52.131 --> 01:45:54.173]  And all it means is non-pasteurized.
[01:45:55.013 --> 01:45:58.036]  Uh, and it means it's real cheese.
[01:45:58.036 --> 01:46:00.498]  And they went after them for watermelons.
[01:46:00.498 --> 01:46:03.921]  They went after them for papayas.
[01:46:03.921 --> 01:46:07.524]  It's just a public store of a private group.
[01:46:07.524 --> 01:46:12.028]  They have them here in Austin where you own part of a cow or a whole cow at a farm.
[01:46:12.028 --> 01:46:14.210]  And it's mainly highly educated folks that are doing it.
[01:46:14.850 --> 01:46:17.192]  And I wish I had the time and energy to truly be healthy.
[01:46:17.192 --> 01:46:20.614]  I know all this information, but don't actually practice it all.
[01:46:20.614 --> 01:46:24.978]  I'm trying to get to the point of where I do that.
[01:46:24.978 --> 01:46:28.881]  But enlighten me, John, what is it that we're not covering?
[01:46:29.892 --> 01:46:44.229]  Well, the fact that, uh, according to the newest court documents, um, they've got thousands of dollars worth of meat and eggs that were bought from commercial non-organic sources, and they're repackaging it and selling it as organic.
[01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:45.811]  And the story's been going on for a while.
[01:46:45.811 --> 01:46:46.692]  I've been following it.
[01:46:47.321 --> 01:46:52.646]  For about 10 months or so because I was looking in to get some organic meat for my family.
[01:47:06.418 --> 01:47:09.621]  Do they deserve to have their money confiscated, their watermelons confiscated?
[01:47:09.621 --> 01:47:11.883]  Hold on just a minute.
[01:47:11.883 --> 01:47:12.624]  I'm done with you.
[01:47:12.624 --> 01:47:19.830]  Send me who you are and maybe we'll have you on with your full name and who you are and your whole background and proof.
[01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:34.002]  I want you to send me some proof of that because the feds in their affidavits are alleging they were selling raw milk and raw cheese and watermelons and things and it was a private co-op and so I mean I remember
[01:47:36.256 --> 01:47:41.614]  On so many cases, whenever people are being persecuted or arrested, that there'll be this narrative put out.
[01:47:42.563 --> 01:47:45.104]  Uh, that, oh, they were really bad and deserved it.
[01:47:45.104 --> 01:47:51.605]  And, uh, I don't see any proof of that, and Mike Adams warned me off-air about this, and I trust Mike, and I saw some of the information.
[01:47:51.605 --> 01:47:53.406]  So, thanks a lot, John.
[01:47:53.406 --> 01:47:58.627]  Yeah, do folks deserve a $130,000 bond for, uh, selling, uh, tomatoes?
[01:47:58.627 --> 01:48:07.149]  Uh, let me guess, I bet that woman up in Michigan growing tomatoes, facing 93 days in jail, uh, when there was no law, maybe, maybe she was doing something bad.
[01:48:08.129 --> 01:48:11.291]  Maybe the lady who got arrested for trying to speak at city council.
[01:48:11.291 --> 01:48:12.672]  Maybe she deserved it.
[01:48:12.672 --> 01:48:14.654]  Maybe the mayor deserved it.
[01:48:14.654 --> 01:48:17.115]  To be fired by the police chief.
[01:48:17.115 --> 01:48:20.297]  I mean, this just goes on and on and on.
[01:48:20.297 --> 01:48:23.359]  So I want to not just have an anonymous call on something like that.
[01:48:23.359 --> 01:48:24.119]  I want your proof.
[01:48:24.119 --> 01:48:26.301]  Send it to showtips and infowars.com.
[01:48:26.301 --> 01:48:27.582]  I want photographs.
[01:48:27.582 --> 01:48:29.083]  I want documentation.
[01:48:29.083 --> 01:48:29.643]  I want proof.
[01:48:29.643 --> 01:48:31.084]  We know that raid happened.
[01:48:31.084 --> 01:48:33.165]  We know they're raiding Amish all over the country.
[01:48:33.165 --> 01:48:35.687]  We know they're raiding people selling pecans on the side of the road.
[01:48:36.147 --> 01:48:42.248]  We know they're trying to pass Codex Alimentarius and a total shutdown of people selling peaches.
[01:48:42.248 --> 01:48:46.409]  And the feds always have got some cockamamie story they put out.
[01:48:46.409 --> 01:48:48.250]  Yeah.
[01:48:48.250 --> 01:48:48.750]  Yeah.
[01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:51.770]  You just hear it in the voice, reading off that piece of paper.
[01:48:51.770 --> 01:48:54.891]  I could just hear it in their voices before I knew it was coming.
[01:48:54.891 --> 01:48:57.572]  Let's talk to Michael in Illinois.
[01:48:57.572 --> 01:48:58.492]  Michael, you're on the air.
[01:48:58.492 --> 01:48:58.852]  Go ahead.
[01:48:59.412 --> 01:49:01.053]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:49:01.053 --> 01:49:04.234]  I hear your sentiments exactly regarding the food.
[01:49:04.234 --> 01:49:05.954]  So I'm here in Chicago.
[01:49:05.954 --> 01:49:12.216]  Yeah, why don't they raid the big grocery stores that add water to the meat they sell people?
[01:49:12.216 --> 01:49:13.937]  Or that won't label GMO?
[01:49:15.318 --> 01:49:27.050]  Or these vaccine companies saying in handouts that the vaccines don't hurt you when their own insert says it'll cause massive brain damage in many cases.
[01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:37.141]  Again, you don't see the feds going after all the admitted stuff and then there's these little creepy disinfo stories being put out about, well, they were packaging stuff wrong there at the co-op.
[01:49:37.461 --> 01:49:41.022]  Who knows, at a co-op, somebody might have been bringing meat in that wasn't 100%.
[01:49:41.022 --> 01:49:44.563]  That's how Big Agra always attacks organic farms and stuff.
[01:49:44.563 --> 01:49:47.424]  They go, well, some of these might not really be organic.
[01:49:47.424 --> 01:49:54.026]  Some of these might actually, you know, that's how they... In fact, Monsanto said a decade ago that was their plan.
[01:49:54.026 --> 01:49:57.627]  Infect everything so that you can't even be sure anymore.
[01:49:57.627 --> 01:49:59.387]  Isn't it incredible how they do that?
[01:49:59.387 --> 01:50:01.968]  You know, we're all safe now, folks.
[01:50:01.968 --> 01:50:03.428]  They confiscated the watermelons.
[01:50:03.428 --> 01:50:05.249]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:50:06.101 --> 01:50:06.802]  Okay, thanks.
[01:50:06.802 --> 01:50:20.874]  So, uh, here in Chicago, uh, Police State Chicago, of course, um, I'm in the process of, uh, pursuing a, uh, FOID case, as you know, you know, firearms are a heck of a thing here in, uh, Chicago, in light of, uh, all the, uh, flash mobs.
[01:50:20.874 --> 01:50:28.040]  So I was, uh, in the course of doing the, uh, the research, I came across the, um, State of Illinois 89th General Assembly,
[01:50:29.827 --> 01:50:34.991]  Stay there!
[01:50:34.991 --> 01:50:35.371]  Stay there!
[01:50:35.371 --> 01:50:46.279]  For those that don't know, in Illinois, the police on average will not go after the gangbangers and people, those are their loved pets, because Chicago itself is publicly mafia run.
[01:50:46.279 --> 01:50:47.620]  Even worse than New York.
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:48.581]  We'll come back to you on this.
[01:50:49.761 --> 01:50:51.643]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[01:50:51.643 --> 01:50:55.086]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[01:50:55.086 --> 01:51:00.970]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed ZeroDebt100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[01:51:19.184 --> 01:51:20.485]  Forget loan modification.
[01:51:20.485 --> 01:51:26.848]  Zero Debt showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[01:51:26.848 --> 01:51:32.292]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt program.

[01:53:31.484 --> 01:53:36.047]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:53:36.047 --> 01:53:41.851]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:53:41.851 --> 01:53:45.493]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:53:45.493 --> 01:53:48.215]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:54:01.764 --> 01:54:06.626]  Okay, Michael, sorry to cut you off at the break.
[01:54:06.626 --> 01:54:10.267]  Get back into the mafia that runs Illinois.
[01:54:10.267 --> 01:54:19.031]  Coming after your guns, you're going over the
[01:54:28.029 --> 01:54:28.409]  Absolutely.
[01:54:28.409 --> 01:54:32.533]  So in the course of pursuing this Floyd case, I came across the 89th General Assembly.
[01:54:32.533 --> 01:54:33.094]  It was May 4th, 1995.
[01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:59.761]  And you had Senator Hendon, who lives in one of the rougher districts, and he was lobbying for, I guess, with concealed carry.
[01:54:59.761 --> 01:55:07.009]  But I came across some astounding information just related to gun shipments.
[01:55:07.009 --> 01:55:08.531]  So if I could read this very quickly.
[01:55:09.191 --> 01:55:17.840]  Um, he basically says, uh, if you hadn't had the stick-up man, uh, put a gun to your head, and then when you call the police, the police say, we can't be everywhere.
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:18.761]  We can't be everywhere.
[01:55:18.761 --> 01:55:19.882]  What are you going to do?
[01:55:19.882 --> 01:55:23.947]  All we're trying to do is give the law-abiding citizens of this state a fighting chance.
[01:55:23.947 --> 01:55:24.767]  A fighting chance.
[01:55:24.767 --> 01:55:25.688]  That's it.
[01:55:25.688 --> 01:55:29.172]  Let me tell you, or let you, let you in on a little story and I'll be through.
[01:55:29.890 --> 01:55:35.071]  They had a government shipment, federal government, coming through Chicago, west side of Chicago.
[01:55:35.071 --> 01:55:41.753]  The trains just happened to break down in the back of Rockwell, and they're referring to Rockwell Gardens, which is a housing project.
[01:55:41.753 --> 01:55:45.794]  Now, Senator Duges, or Duchess, might know about this.
[01:55:45.794 --> 01:55:49.174]  The train just happened to break down behind the public housing building.
[01:55:49.174 --> 01:55:55.336]  The vice lords just happened to know which trains to go to to get the AK-47s and hand grenades.
[01:55:55.336 --> 01:55:56.276]  They just happened to know.
[01:55:57.060 --> 01:56:00.463]  If you believe that, I want to sell you the old state capitol building over there.
[01:56:00.463 --> 01:56:08.288]  Somebody told them, because the crooks are going to get the guns, and the crooks are in every level of government, as well as out there on the streets.
[01:56:08.288 --> 01:56:11.671]  So it goes on, but this is actually in the congressional record.
[01:56:11.671 --> 01:56:19.116]  I want to stop you because, as I've said, for a hundred years the feds have been arming the criminals to knock out their competition.
[01:56:19.116 --> 01:56:22.698]  Every vice is mega bank run, they're the real mafia.
[01:56:23.783 --> 01:56:32.948]  Only reason we know about organized crime was because the Italians got too uppity with the WASP and Jewish mob and had to be slapped down in the 50s.
[01:56:32.948 --> 01:56:37.830]  And of course, before that, the head of the FBI said no organized crime existed.
[01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:41.512]  Just like they say, the government isn't involved in terror today.
[01:56:41.512 --> 01:56:51.478]  We have Fast and Furious, caught shipping the guns into Mexico, drugs back, El Paso Times, Chicago Tribune, shipping guns, as I said, in Illinois, Miami.
[01:56:53.092 --> 01:56:56.194]  Now the ATF, FBI, DEA, all involved.
[01:56:56.194 --> 01:57:02.239]  And yes, I've talked to people that work for railroads, and they say that there was always inside jobs.
[01:57:02.239 --> 01:57:08.844]  Even in Dallas, in places, they would order the train to stop, they would look the other way, and then criminals would rob it, including armed shipments.
[01:57:08.844 --> 01:57:10.865]  The police were involved as well.
[01:57:10.865 --> 01:57:14.868]  And I've talked to folks, again, who worked on the major railroad going in and out of Dallas.
[01:57:14.868 --> 01:57:16.089]  That's where I grew up.
[01:57:16.089 --> 01:57:18.251]  And I had some family that worked on the railroad.
[01:57:18.251 --> 01:57:19.131]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:57:19.952 --> 01:57:24.314]  In fact, I had family basically had to get out of it because they got threatened because they weren't going to be part of it.
[01:57:24.314 --> 01:57:26.215]  But the yes, mafia runs everything.
[01:57:26.215 --> 01:57:27.536]  The government runs everything.
[01:57:27.536 --> 01:57:29.277]  The government is mafia.
[01:57:29.277 --> 01:57:30.658]  I want to put you on hold.
[01:57:30.658 --> 01:57:42.724]  This is big news because we can say in 95 state legislature, you know, legislature record, government ship guns to gangs or something like that.
[01:57:42.724 --> 01:57:48.728]  I need Kurt Nimmo or Paul Watson or Steve Watson or Aaron to do an article on that and tie it into Fast and Furious.
[01:57:50.168 --> 01:57:56.111]  I'm going to put you on hold and give you an email, but tell us the date and the congressional record and where everybody can find that.
[01:57:56.111 --> 01:57:57.291]  Absolutely.
[01:57:57.291 --> 01:58:10.017]  So if you search for the State of Illinois 89th General Assembly, the Senate, May 4th, 1995, and this last piece is, it's the 43rd legislative day.
[01:58:10.017 --> 01:58:12.639]  So you really have to get refined with your search.
[01:58:12.639 --> 01:58:17.241]  So State of Illinois, 89th General Assembly, May 5th, 1995,
[01:58:20.215 --> 01:58:27.676]  It's the 43rd legislative day and it's Senator Hendon.
[01:58:27.676 --> 01:58:28.677]  Senator Hendon.
[01:58:28.677 --> 01:58:30.977]  Now listen, you can find the actual subpage.
[01:58:30.977 --> 01:58:32.337]  I want to put you on hold.
[01:58:32.337 --> 01:58:37.958]  I want you to email me the subpage of that right now and we will print that off and read that on air.
[01:58:37.958 --> 01:58:39.198]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:39.198 --> 01:58:42.479]  Stay there.

[01:58:54.999 --> 01:58:56.260]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.260 --> 01:59:00.123]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:59:00.123 --> 01:59:02.425]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.425 --> 01:59:08.290]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.290 --> 01:59:14.535]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:14.955 --> 01:59:20.899]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.899 --> 01:59:25.102]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:59:25.102 --> 01:59:29.384]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[01:59:35.348 --> 01:59:38.910]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:40.871]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:40.871 --> 01:59:41.312]  It's here.

[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:12.000]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.541]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.541 --> 02:00:17.742]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.742 --> 02:00:32.847]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.847 --> 02:00:34.248]  We're looking into the Illinois
[02:00:35.894 --> 02:00:38.795]  Legislative session, 89th.
[02:00:38.795 --> 02:00:40.975]  It looks like Jaren's found it.
[02:00:40.975 --> 02:00:48.057]  Very interesting if you heard the last caller about talk of the government arming the gangs then, back in the mid-1990s.
[02:00:48.057 --> 02:00:48.937]  Wouldn't be the first time.
[02:00:48.937 --> 02:00:59.519]  I remember LA Times, the feds letting 3,000 AK-47s go free in Long Beach to the gangs.
[02:00:59.519 --> 02:01:01.319]  Man, this just goes on and on.
[02:01:01.319 --> 02:01:02.780]  I just remembered that.
[02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:03.860]  I have the LA Times.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.702]  That's actually in my first film, America Destroyed by Design, 1997.
[02:01:09.702 --> 02:01:19.326]  The more I think about it, how the government arms the criminals, the select criminals, to knock out their competition.
[02:01:19.326 --> 02:01:22.527]  Andrew in Illinois, pretty wild news from Illinois, my friend.
[02:01:22.527 --> 02:01:31.511]  It reminds me of during the Clinton administration, they seized a container shipment of AK-47s from China, and there's no more word of what they did with it.
[02:01:32.464 --> 02:01:33.945]  Actually, that was it.
[02:01:33.945 --> 02:01:35.545]  That was Long Beach.
[02:01:35.545 --> 02:01:38.506]  The report was it made its way to drug gangs.
[02:01:38.506 --> 02:01:41.387]  But here's what I was talking about is HAARP.
[02:01:41.387 --> 02:01:46.209]  Now, HAARP is used to manipulate storm cells.
[02:01:46.209 --> 02:01:48.950]  You heard, you know, storms we call cells?
[02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:51.951]  Because they have a positive and a negative side to them.
[02:01:51.951 --> 02:01:57.133]  They can push these storm cells over any area or pull them to any area using HAARP.
[02:01:57.133 --> 02:01:59.794]  Plus, they can heat the air up over them to give them physical energy.
[02:02:00.385 --> 02:02:01.426]  Or they can add energy.
[02:02:01.426 --> 02:02:06.269]  I'm trying to find out more about adding energy to the storm.
[02:02:06.269 --> 02:02:12.433]  They admit there's all sorts of ionizing towers that can manipulate the weather.
[02:02:12.433 --> 02:02:14.695]  That's mainstream news now.
[02:02:14.695 --> 02:02:19.858]  So much of the stuff that was science fiction is now admitted that it's been going on behind the scenes, Andrew.
[02:02:23.427 --> 02:02:25.228]  They're starting to test that out.
[02:02:25.228 --> 02:02:33.975]  I've talked to a guy that works at a University of Texas research facility, and that's all I'm allowed to say.
[02:02:33.975 --> 02:02:35.376]  Well, actually, he's called in before.
[02:02:35.376 --> 02:02:37.337]  I've known him personally for 12 years.
[02:02:37.337 --> 02:02:39.739]  His first name's Steve, and I'll just leave it at that.
[02:02:39.739 --> 02:02:45.023]  In fact, Steve, if you could ever get me a note, I'd like to have you on as a guest without saying your last name.
[02:02:45.023 --> 02:02:46.804]  But he has witnessed
[02:02:48.561 --> 02:02:55.886]  He says that the Doppler radar facilities, many of them are a cover, just like they have a camp within a camp at Camp X-Ray.
[02:02:55.886 --> 02:03:05.553]  They'll have a real Doppler radar system, and then right next to it, they'll have another array that they claim is under federal control that he claims is a heartband tenant to manipulate weather.
[02:03:05.553 --> 02:03:11.878]  And I remember him telling me this ten years ago, and he gave me a lot of good info, but I'd still kind of roll my eyes.
[02:03:13.263 --> 02:03:22.547]  Now, the exact arrays he was trying to show me diagrams of, or what are in the Daily Mail with Dubai saying they can control the weather, looks just like them.
[02:03:22.547 --> 02:03:25.268]  And I can't handle it anymore.
[02:03:25.268 --> 02:03:27.689]  I mean, we're living in total crazy land.
[02:03:27.689 --> 02:03:31.491]  There's a giant military-industrial complex that's gotten away with whatever it wants to do.
[02:03:31.491 --> 02:03:32.311]  They think they're God.
[02:03:32.311 --> 02:03:33.152]  They're playing God.
[02:03:33.772 --> 02:03:37.396]  They've got all sorts of life extension systems we're never going to get a hold of.
[02:03:37.396 --> 02:03:40.660]  The general public's completely slobbering and dumbed down.
[02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:42.542]  Those that aren't awake are that way.
[02:03:42.542 --> 02:03:48.809]  Folks that are awake... I don't know what we're going to do, but anything else, Andrew?
[02:03:48.809 --> 02:03:53.995]  Yes, also if people still have a television, the old kind with antenna,
[02:03:54.605 --> 02:03:55.105]  We're good to go.
[02:04:10.418 --> 02:04:19.541]  Well, actually, I was going back 65, 70 years ago, I saw where some of the first devices were TV tubes that weathermen would use to, like, track things.
[02:04:19.541 --> 02:04:23.843]  That was some of the early warning systems was television tubes that they manipulated.
[02:04:23.843 --> 02:04:25.984]  I've actually read that.
[02:04:25.984 --> 02:04:34.067]  Channel 2 is what you go on using an antenna, the old-fashioned kind, not cable or satellite, but have it on a TV antenna in channel 2, and then you adjust your
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:38.622]  Contrasts a lot so you see sparkles on your screen.
[02:04:38.622 --> 02:04:41.323]  But then when that tornado precinct comes in, your screen will turn white.
[02:04:41.323 --> 02:04:42.564]  Hit the cellar.
[02:04:42.564 --> 02:04:44.365]  You got the tornado clouds right there.
[02:04:44.365 --> 02:04:45.165]  Alright, good job.
[02:04:45.165 --> 02:04:46.966]  Appreciate that, Andrew.
[02:04:46.966 --> 02:04:49.988]  Ron, Tom, Verna, Julie, we're going to get to all of you.
[02:04:49.988 --> 02:04:51.909]  We got a special guest coming up, though.
[02:04:51.909 --> 02:04:53.450]  We'll get to your calls while he's on with us.
[02:04:53.450 --> 02:04:58.032]  We're going to cover the media and where it's going in this country.
[02:04:58.032 --> 02:04:58.492]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.492 --> 02:04:59.053]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:01.212 --> 02:05:04.554]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:05:04.554 --> 02:05:09.158]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long-term storable food business.
[02:05:09.158 --> 02:05:15.342]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply.
[02:05:15.342 --> 02:05:16.603]  Even less than the price in 1981.
[02:05:16.603 --> 02:05:17.363]  For a limited time, you get 30%
[02:05:19.665 --> 02:05:20.225]  I think so.
[02:05:37.756 --> 02:05:38.176]  I think so.
[02:06:00.690 --> 02:06:01.891]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:06:01.891 --> 02:06:08.816]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:06:08.816 --> 02:06:11.378]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:06:11.378 --> 02:06:16.761]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:06:16.761 --> 02:06:19.804]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:06:19.804 --> 02:06:22.105]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:06:22.105 --> 02:06:28.370]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:06:28.370 --> 02:06:28.790]  In fact,
[02:06:29.070 --> 02:06:31.732]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:06:31.732 --> 02:06:37.517]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:06:37.517 --> 02:06:39.158]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:06:39.158 --> 02:06:40.459]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:06:40.459 --> 02:06:43.141]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:06:43.141 --> 02:06:47.364]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:06:47.364 --> 02:06:51.988]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:06:51.988 --> 02:06:54.570]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:06:54.570 --> 02:06:57.612]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:06:58.413 --> 02:07:01.736]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[02:07:01.736 --> 02:07:06.441]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:07:06.441 --> 02:07:12.868]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:07:12.868 --> 02:07:15.150]  Number one, study the past.
[02:07:15.150 --> 02:07:17.533]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:07:17.533 --> 02:07:21.276]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:07:22.375 --> 02:07:25.477]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:07:25.477 --> 02:07:29.319]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:07:29.319 --> 02:07:34.361]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:07:34.361 --> 02:07:38.363]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:07:38.363 --> 02:07:41.785]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:07:41.785 --> 02:07:45.407]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:46.247 --> 02:07:51.191]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:07:51.191 --> 02:07:55.814]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:55.814 --> 02:08:01.379]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:08:01.379 --> 02:08:06.943]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.949 --> 02:08:13.050]  Okay, your phone calls on a host of issues are coming up.
[02:08:13.050 --> 02:08:17.092]  I'm going to get to more of what's happening right now in the stock market.
[02:08:17.092 --> 02:08:20.994]  The admission that, yes, we're going into a depression, basically.
[02:08:20.994 --> 02:08:23.935]  We're going to be breaking all of that down today.
[02:08:23.935 --> 02:08:26.856]  But there's a guy I really wanted to get on air.
[02:08:26.856 --> 02:08:30.537]  Because, I don't know, for a year and a half or so, maybe longer.
[02:08:30.537 --> 02:08:35.700]  Now, he has been airing my radio show on one of his radio stations live.
[02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:38.281]  And then on the other one, he has been
[02:08:40.339 --> 02:08:40.999]  We're good to go.
[02:09:00.714 --> 02:09:10.338]  And the big majors will come in for two, three years, sell advertising for $5 a spot to bankrupt all their competition, then buy them up.
[02:09:10.338 --> 02:09:11.559]  And I'm not for monopolies.
[02:09:11.559 --> 02:09:20.963]  You know, we've seen the big three out there, now the big two, a decade ago or so couldn't own more than a certain amount of stations in each market.
[02:09:20.963 --> 02:09:24.445]  Now it's basically unlimited and it's destroyed.
[02:09:25.439 --> 02:09:29.741]  Local diversity on local radio at a time that we really, really need it.
[02:09:29.741 --> 02:09:35.163]  That's why I've encouraged citizen journalists to start their own local news shows, their own local newspapers.
[02:09:35.163 --> 02:09:37.184]  And there's been a birth of those.
[02:09:37.184 --> 02:09:40.365]  But there's nothing like the professionals from broadcast...
[02:09:41.866 --> 02:09:53.893]  AM and FM, UHF, VHF, many of them now bagging groceries, many of them mowing lawns, many of them teaching Sunday school or public school.
[02:09:53.893 --> 02:09:55.674]  Many of these incredible talents.
[02:09:55.674 --> 02:10:07.662]  I mean, I remember growing up in Dallas, you go through the dial and just hear so many interesting personalities, local news, and most stations don't even do that now, or they just regurgitate national news.
[02:10:07.662 --> 02:10:09.483]  But Michael's Whirling, when I've been out
[02:10:10.323 --> 02:10:14.745]  Uh, in the area that he lives in, uh, in California, Santa Cruz and surrounding areas.
[02:10:14.745 --> 02:10:18.047]  Uh, you talk about a wide diversity of local shows.
[02:10:18.047 --> 02:10:23.089]  He's only got really, I guess, a few syndicated, uh, that he carries, and I'm honored to be one of them, but...
[02:10:24.085 --> 02:10:36.955]  I wanted to get Michael on because when I went to Talkers, he was there, and I of course went out and spoke to the KSCO listeners at two events that were sell-out crowds, 900 at each event.
[02:10:36.955 --> 02:10:38.436]  In fact, somewhere above 900.
[02:10:38.436 --> 02:10:42.519]  It was capacity, standing room only, both nights.
[02:10:42.519 --> 02:10:49.185]  And I was asking him, you know, the decades and decades you've owned this station, how have you survived and thrived
[02:10:50.458 --> 02:10:56.404]  When other stations and programmers in most cases cannot figure out how to do it.
[02:10:56.404 --> 02:10:59.067]  And Michael's been extremely successful.
[02:10:59.067 --> 02:11:02.211]  And the model he went with is basically similar to our model.
[02:11:03.266 --> 02:11:04.107]  I sell books.
[02:11:04.107 --> 02:11:05.088]  I sell videos.
[02:11:05.088 --> 02:11:06.770]  I sell water filters.
[02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:09.393]  I have a retail store.
[02:11:09.393 --> 02:11:10.855]  So I have my own products.
[02:11:10.855 --> 02:11:12.997]  And I tell listeners, I think these are really good products.
[02:11:12.997 --> 02:11:13.938]  These are really good films.
[02:11:13.938 --> 02:11:14.599]  Good t-shirts.
[02:11:14.599 --> 02:11:15.680]  Spread the word.
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:17.142]  If you believe in what we're doing, buy these.
[02:11:17.142 --> 02:11:19.965]  If you like this broadcasting, vote with your dollars.
[02:11:20.906 --> 02:11:23.489]  I also tell folks support your local AM and FM affiliate.
[02:11:23.489 --> 02:11:29.456]  If you're listening to the show there, sponsor them if you're a local business owner.
[02:11:29.456 --> 02:11:31.999]  Or support those local sponsors.
[02:11:31.999 --> 02:11:38.826]  Let them know I'm buying my tile from you, or my carpet from you, or my car from you, or I'm going to your restaurant because you're on.
[02:11:39.787 --> 02:11:42.572]  This local station that carries shows I believe in.
[02:11:42.572 --> 02:11:48.362]  There's a reason the White House is openly saying they want to shut down talk radio and free speech and want internet kill switches.
[02:11:48.362 --> 02:11:50.826]  Because it's a place you can call into.
[02:11:50.826 --> 02:11:52.769]  Talk radio is a long-form format.
[02:11:53.689 --> 02:11:59.291]  And so we can take little stories from around the country or overseas and show a pattern.
[02:11:59.291 --> 02:12:01.993]  We can break that regional news control.
[02:12:01.993 --> 02:12:09.836]  But if you don't have local radio, there's no way for it ever to get out to you unless you happen to be listening to a show like this one.
[02:12:10.643 --> 02:12:18.191]  But when I was out in KSCO, they said, do you know they're making the local famous apple juice place put fluoride in their apple juice now?
[02:12:18.191 --> 02:12:20.033]  And I said, yes, I've seen that.
[02:12:20.033 --> 02:12:25.258]  And I ended up talking to folks that are involved in apple production that work at the station.
[02:12:25.258 --> 02:12:27.681]  They were saying, and you're aware of the carbon taxes going in.
[02:12:27.681 --> 02:12:29.542]  And yes, I was aware of California issues.
[02:12:30.143 --> 02:12:40.391]  But see, I can cover that sometimes, but local, they're the folks that can organize people politically to stand up for themselves, and that is not what the establishment wants.
[02:12:40.391 --> 02:12:57.063]  So, amongst other things, I brought Michael Zwirling on today for a message directly to AM and FM broadcast license owners, managers, program directors, to listen to the model.
[02:12:57.583 --> 02:13:01.205]  Your radio station shouldn't just be selling coffee mugs and t-shirts.
[02:13:01.205 --> 02:13:02.606]  You should have bookstores.
[02:13:02.606 --> 02:13:07.409]  You should have all your hosts doing YouTube videos and plugging your online stream.
[02:13:07.409 --> 02:13:12.593]  I mean, I'm going to give you some of my information that seems common sense to some, but not to others.
[02:13:12.593 --> 02:13:19.317]  And then Zwirling is going to give you some of his inside knowledge to help our radio stations.
[02:13:19.317 --> 02:13:20.257]  But even if you're not
[02:13:21.318 --> 02:13:29.607]  Picking up my radio broadcast or other great Genesis shows, or some of the shows that Michael Swerling syndicates, by the way, through Genesis, that doesn't matter.
[02:13:29.607 --> 02:13:31.228]  This is how you can really
[02:13:32.333 --> 02:13:35.174]  Fund your radio station and then build it.
[02:13:35.174 --> 02:13:41.677]  Because Mr. Swerling is number one on his stations in his area, in those key cities.
[02:13:41.677 --> 02:13:42.658]  He's number one.
[02:13:42.658 --> 02:13:44.899]  He's got shows, many of them, that are number one.
[02:13:44.899 --> 02:13:46.839]  And he's done it against the big guys.
[02:13:46.839 --> 02:13:48.540]  And this is the model.
[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:52.322]  You can't beat the big ad agencies blocking you out because you're on an insider.
[02:13:52.722 --> 02:13:55.204]  You can't get at the table, you can't do that.
[02:13:55.204 --> 02:13:57.865]  There are ways to grow your station.
[02:13:57.865 --> 02:14:03.249]  To A, survive, and then B, grow, and C, thrive and dominate.
[02:14:03.249 --> 02:14:07.191]  And this goes into alternative media, it goes into so many things.
[02:14:07.191 --> 02:14:14.876]  And so I hope that all the audience will stay with us as we cover it because this affects you and your capacity to call into local radio.
[02:14:15.316 --> 02:14:17.799]  Your capacity to bring local host information.
[02:14:17.799 --> 02:14:20.182]  Your capacity to be a focal point.
[02:14:20.182 --> 02:14:24.608]  Talk radio is the electronic soapbox.
[02:14:24.608 --> 02:14:27.812]  Talk radio pioneered the new media.
[02:14:27.812 --> 02:14:29.974]  The systems that talk radio developed.
[02:14:29.974 --> 02:14:30.595]  It's the oldest...
[02:14:33.399 --> 02:14:36.844]  electronic media, but it's also the newest of the old media.
[02:14:36.844 --> 02:14:40.870]  And it's only talk radio that still has the giant audiences.
[02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:41.992]  Take Coast to Coast AM.
[02:14:41.992 --> 02:14:48.622]  Most cities, they have close to half or more of the combined total radio listening system.
[02:14:50.392 --> 02:14:53.315]  Take Rush Limbaugh, 22 million listeners conservatively.
[02:14:53.315 --> 02:14:56.099]  The biggest news shows now have a couple million.
[02:14:56.099 --> 02:15:00.885]  Talk radio is king, and local talk radio needs to be king again.
[02:15:00.885 --> 02:15:06.252]  And here I am, a syndicated broadcaster, telling you the inside baseball because I don't care.
[02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:09.532]  About at the end of the day, syndicated radio.
[02:15:09.532 --> 02:15:12.013]  I care about truth and information.
[02:15:12.013 --> 02:15:17.277]  And I started out, obviously, as a local access TV person in local community activism.
[02:15:17.277 --> 02:15:21.720]  Now, Michael Zwirling is president and CEO of Zwirling Broadcasting System, LTD.
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:25.962]  Chairman and CEO of ZBS Radio Associates, LTD.
[02:15:25.962 --> 02:15:27.824]  Worked as a television news anchor for Cable 7.
[02:15:29.685 --> 02:15:40.373]  Santa Fe and Santa Cruz in 73 taught radio TV production and built educational FM radio stations for Salinas Union High School in 74.
[02:15:40.373 --> 02:15:43.095]  Started industrial video production business in 74.
[02:15:43.095 --> 02:15:47.959]  Made training promotional videos for companies and government agencies until 85.
[02:15:47.959 --> 02:15:51.442]  Built custom home for personal residents and video studio in 79.
[02:15:51.442 --> 02:15:53.143]  So he's a trailblazer.
[02:15:54.844 --> 02:16:14.498]  Bleeding liberal heart quickly healed as direct result of being told by government that materials, what materials and colors to be used, became interested in real estate investment shortly thereafter, obtained California real estate broker license in 85, established Michael's Whirling Investments real estate brokerage business, which continues until now.
[02:16:14.498 --> 02:16:23.565]  So a great American entrepreneur acquired KSCO Radio on July 31st, 1991, a station he listened to as his family was a little kid.
[02:16:24.526 --> 02:16:36.117]  Traveled and moved into Santa Cruz and vowed to build long-neglected sleeping giant station into premier active vibrant news and information medium for Monterey Bay area.
[02:16:36.117 --> 02:16:47.069]  Establishes EBS radio in January of 98 to develop innovative method to market nutritional supplements to public using educational empowerment properties of talk radio medium.
[02:16:47.489 --> 02:16:49.030]  Infowarsteam.com.
[02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:56.914]  He is the team leader of the entire operation for radio stations, for listeners, for everybody to survive and thrive.
[02:16:56.914 --> 02:16:57.635]  We've done it.
[02:16:57.635 --> 02:16:58.695]  He's done it.
[02:16:58.695 --> 02:17:03.818]  Michael Zwirling, quite a 10-minute intro, but thank you for joining us today, sir.
[02:17:03.818 --> 02:17:04.639]  I can't believe it.
[02:17:04.639 --> 02:17:06.280]  Did I do all those things?
[02:17:08.092 --> 02:17:10.973]  The technology is absolutely incredible, Alex.
[02:17:10.973 --> 02:17:15.194]  Have you been watching my facial expressions?
[02:17:15.194 --> 02:17:16.675]  Because we're on video Skype.
[02:17:16.675 --> 02:17:17.275]  Absolutely.
[02:17:17.275 --> 02:17:20.016]  You're here being simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:20.016 --> 02:17:21.437]  Michael, tell us about yourself.
[02:17:21.437 --> 02:17:31.880]  I mean, that magic in your eyes when you talk about being a little kid and first listening to KSCO when you moved there, and all the Doris Day stories, the Clint Eastwood stories, the Ronald Reagan stories.
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:33.341]  I mean, you're really an interesting guy.
[02:17:34.462 --> 02:17:42.883]  But then also describe to people how you're able to not just survive, but absolutely kick the big Monopoly men's hind ends.
[02:17:43.581 --> 02:17:48.565]  Well, in a nutshell, it's called leveraging your audience.
[02:17:48.565 --> 02:18:03.278]  Traditionally, Alex, what radio and television stations do is sell advertising time to businesses who want to reach the audience that the radio or TV station reaches.
[02:18:03.278 --> 02:18:04.539]  Okay?
[02:18:04.539 --> 02:18:05.780]  And I don't know.
[02:18:08.356 --> 02:18:14.561]  Fourteen, fifteen years ago, sort of by accident, I stumbled upon a different way to do it.
[02:18:14.561 --> 02:18:20.806]  And in fact, I should back up a little bit because I always wanted to own that particular station.
[02:18:20.806 --> 02:18:23.628]  KFCO, AM, Canadian, Santa Cruz.
[02:18:23.628 --> 02:18:29.512]  When I was a youngster growing up, it wasn't a station that too many people would listen to.
[02:18:30.553 --> 02:18:36.081]  Um, because, uh, too many young people would listen to because it was an old fogey music station.
[02:18:36.081 --> 02:18:41.788]  You know, they, they played Montavani music and so forth, but it was the only radio station that was in town.
[02:18:41.788 --> 02:18:48.216]  So I used to hang out there as a kid and dream about being a DJ there someday, or better yet being a talk show host.
[02:18:48.697 --> 02:18:55.304]  Because we had this great radio station that was a trailblazer in the San Francisco Bay Area called KGO.
[02:18:55.304 --> 02:18:57.307]  It's an amazing talk radio station.
[02:18:57.307 --> 02:18:58.868]  At least it was for many, many years.
[02:18:58.868 --> 02:19:05.376]  Now it's gone downhill and it's really very sad what's happening to KGO and a lot of the other big stations.
[02:19:05.376 --> 02:19:06.837]  The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[02:19:07.498 --> 02:19:26.694]  But, so, in the 1960s, I had an opportunity to do the high school radio show, time that was made available by the owner, general manager of KSCO, the station that I now own, and it was the most important thing in my life.
[02:19:26.694 --> 02:19:34.220]  And one day, after what I thought was the best program I and the high school staff had ever done,
[02:19:35.381 --> 02:19:38.344]  The manager walked in and said, Swirling, you're through.
[02:19:38.344 --> 02:19:39.285]  And I said, Why?
[02:19:39.285 --> 02:19:42.747]  He said, You don't make a fart noise on KSEO.
[02:19:42.747 --> 02:19:43.708]  It was a raspberry.
[02:19:43.708 --> 02:19:51.995]  Anyhow, long story short, I vowed right then and there, on January 4th, 1967, that someday I was going to own that station.
[02:19:52.715 --> 02:20:00.244]  And turn it into an amazing interactive communications vehicle.
[02:20:00.244 --> 02:20:03.969]  And in 1991, what is that?
[02:20:03.969 --> 02:20:06.251]  24 years later, I got that opportunity.
[02:20:06.251 --> 02:20:12.018]  So we're celebrating our 20th year of being a voice for everyone.
[02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:20.830]  Uh, in a, in a media and an industry that seems to be going the opposite direction really, really fast.
[02:20:20.830 --> 02:20:27.880]  You know, instead of serving local communities, it seems to be shunning local communities as the big companies take over.
[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:40.783]  When I was able to acquire KSCO in 1991, the rule at the time was only one AM and one FM station could be owned by the same owner in a given market.
[02:20:40.783 --> 02:20:43.844]  A year or two later, it changed to two and two.
[02:20:43.844 --> 02:20:57.248]  And in 1996, the Communications Act of 1996 that absolutely destroyed diversity and localism in the United States of America made it possible
[02:20:59.292 --> 02:21:03.135]  As you said earlier in the intro, it's essentially limitless.
[02:21:03.135 --> 02:21:16.345]  There is a limit, but the limit is so high that one company or one entity can now own 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 stations within the same community and dominate it.
[02:21:16.345 --> 02:21:17.386]  It's just horrible.
[02:21:17.386 --> 02:21:19.407]  It's totally destroyed everything.
[02:21:19.407 --> 02:21:26.573]  Anyhow, be careful what you wish for because in 1991 I got an opportunity to purchase the radio station that I always wanted to own.
[02:21:27.413 --> 02:21:39.882]  Uh, did it, uh, and, um, and found that, uh, it wasn't quite as fun owning a station and being responsible for payrolls and so forth.
[02:21:42.327 --> 02:21:45.708]  It wasn't the same as being a DJ or a talk show host.
[02:21:45.708 --> 02:21:48.089]  You're responsible for a lot of things.
[02:21:48.089 --> 02:21:49.609]  Believe me, tell me about it.
[02:21:49.609 --> 02:22:00.632]  That's why I'm chief cook, bottle washer, everything, and I got a great crew, but it's still torture having to watch everything, tell everybody what to do.
[02:22:00.632 --> 02:22:06.074]  A lot of people want to be managers or bosses, and believe me folks, unless you're a control freak, it's not fun.
[02:22:08.510 --> 02:22:23.619]  Well, after about six months, by accident, I don't know how, I happened to find myself on a telephone conversation with a person, a broadcaster, a very successful broadcaster, who, it turned out, right then I learned that he had been bidding against me.
[02:22:24.574 --> 02:22:31.322]  I don't know how you're gonna make money with that station, but if you ever do, I'm gonna want to read your book.
[02:22:46.482 --> 02:22:52.568]  Well, I guess I'm ready to write the book, but it's going to be an awful short book.
[02:22:52.568 --> 02:22:55.051]  It's only going to be two or three words.
[02:22:55.051 --> 02:22:58.294]  Leverage your audience.
[02:22:58.294 --> 02:23:02.959]  If you have an audience that appreciates you and loves you like you do and like we do,
[02:23:05.384 --> 02:23:24.312]  If you represent products that you either own or have a distributor for or so forth, as long as you believe in those products, the people who listen to you, who believe in you, if you say buy these products, try them out, see if they work as well for you as they do for me,
[02:23:25.612 --> 02:23:27.133]  Chances are they're going to do it.
[02:23:27.133 --> 02:23:33.236]  And if you let them know that it's supporting the broadcast, which is what you do and which is what we do, amazing things happen.
[02:23:33.236 --> 02:23:38.719]  And then all we've got to do morally is pick things to promote that we personally believe in.
[02:23:38.719 --> 02:23:44.402]  Gold, silver, high quality nutritional products, the highest quality storable food.
[02:23:44.402 --> 02:23:48.685]  All I do is go out and find the best product, then I promote it and then it's able to fund
[02:23:49.545 --> 02:23:49.825]  That's KCXL!
[02:24:12.463 --> 02:24:18.448]  They were even able to buy another station and upgrade it and all this by following that model.
[02:24:18.448 --> 02:24:30.617]  So here we are literally giving people silver crosses for the big corporate vampires here if stations will listen to us, but also listeners.
[02:24:30.617 --> 02:24:41.286]  You've had a lot of listeners with the Longevity products, with the Infowarsteam.com system we've launched, but going back over a decade, I hope you'll tell folks who've really been successful with this because
[02:24:42.126 --> 02:24:42.987]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:24:42.987 --> 02:24:44.828]  Earlier in the show, I felt absolutely horrible.
[02:24:44.828 --> 02:24:45.709]  I hadn't eaten today.
[02:24:45.709 --> 02:24:46.890]  I've been up since 6.30.
[02:24:46.890 --> 02:24:47.650]  I finally ate.
[02:24:47.650 --> 02:24:48.711]  I feel great.
[02:24:48.711 --> 02:24:54.235]  I know when I take the Longevity Tangy Tangerine or Pollen Burst that it gives me incredible energy.
[02:24:54.235 --> 02:24:55.076]  I feel great.
[02:24:55.076 --> 02:24:57.578]  But I'm such a workaholic, I even forget to do that.
[02:24:57.578 --> 02:24:58.398]  I forget to sleep.
[02:24:58.398 --> 02:24:59.699]  So it's one thing to know all this.
[02:24:59.699 --> 02:25:02.181]  I'm trying to put it into function.
[02:25:02.181 --> 02:25:03.822]  It's the same thing for radio stations.
[02:25:03.822 --> 02:25:04.503]  They need
[02:25:05.203 --> 02:25:16.167]  To go with the model that you've used to sustain themselves by promoting good products and turning themselves into the direct sellers, and they can have advertising on top of it.
[02:25:16.167 --> 02:25:25.031]  But the point is, this is a system that will let the mom and pops, but also the big independents, not just survive, but thrive.
[02:25:25.031 --> 02:25:29.793]  So tell us about leveraging the audience and what it did for you.
[02:25:29.793 --> 02:25:30.573]  Well, in 2001,
[02:25:33.454 --> 02:25:38.240]  Uh, the company that owned, uh, a, I don't know if I'll mention names here.
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:39.722]  I don't know if I should do that or not.
[02:25:39.722 --> 02:25:40.663]  Just give us the basics.
[02:25:40.663 --> 02:25:41.424]  It doesn't matter.
[02:25:41.424 --> 02:25:41.825]  Yeah.
[02:25:41.825 --> 02:25:42.606]  Okay.
[02:25:42.606 --> 02:25:50.055]  A company, uh, that, uh, that was the syndicator of a, of our by far most listened to program, which is a syndicated show.
[02:25:50.575 --> 02:26:09.122]  Decided to pull the plug on us not because we weren't doing a wonderful job and not because we weren't doing being the best affiliate anybody could be but because that same company owned another station in our market and the manager of that station was complaining saying
[02:26:09.562 --> 02:26:22.794]  Why in the world, if we own the top syndicated talk radio property in the whole world, should we allow our competitor, that independent over in Santa Cruz, to carry that product when we are the owners of it?
[02:26:23.895 --> 02:26:30.877]  And I guess he squawked enough to get the corporate people higher up to say, okay, we'll let you have it.
[02:26:30.877 --> 02:26:33.557]  Yes, that makes sense, I suppose.
[02:26:33.557 --> 02:26:46.081]  And so they gave me the legally required, I think it was 90 day notification that you're going to be losing your affiliate status here and it's going to a competing station.
[02:26:46.081 --> 02:26:49.502]  And I said, okay, look, it's sort of like losing a lease.
[02:26:49.502 --> 02:26:50.922]  If you don't own the property,
[02:26:52.062 --> 02:27:11.736]  You know, that's just life, you know, but I said it doesn't make any business sense at all to do what you're doing because you're going to be going from the station, the station with the strongest signal in the market, AM or FM, bar none, to a station with a pipsqueak signal just because it's owned by your same company.
[02:27:11.736 --> 02:27:13.677]  That doesn't make any business sense at all.
[02:27:13.677 --> 02:27:17.480]  A lot of the people in the market aren't even going to be able to hear your program anymore.
[02:27:18.420 --> 02:27:20.783]  And they didn't listen to me, they did it.
[02:27:20.783 --> 02:27:28.512]  Now, under ordinary circumstances, that would have destroyed my station.
[02:27:28.512 --> 02:27:37.362]  Because taking such a huge chunk of our audience away in one fell swoop would have had devastating consequences.
[02:27:38.183 --> 02:27:47.741]  But because I was long into having discovered the leverage your audience notion that I talked about.
[02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:52.381]  We don't depend on the sale of advertising.
[02:27:52.381 --> 02:28:06.846]  We developed a residual compounding income that started in 1996 when I had this great idea about selling products to our listening audience.
[02:28:06.846 --> 02:28:09.847]  They've got to be good products or else they're not going to buy them again.
[02:28:09.847 --> 02:28:12.648]  A good salesperson can sell anybody anything once.
[02:28:13.628 --> 02:28:17.809]  But if it's not, if it doesn't measure up, if it doesn't do what it's supposed to do, forget it.
[02:28:17.809 --> 02:28:28.411]  Well, that's why Ted's gone from probably, you know, the 50th biggest gold broker and silver broker in the country to now number five because he gives great deals and he's been right.
[02:28:28.411 --> 02:28:34.353]  So folks would be mad if I said buy gold when it was 300, it's going to go up and it went down, but it's gone up above 1800.
[02:28:34.353 --> 02:28:36.493]  So folks are like, wow, exactly.
[02:28:36.493 --> 02:28:39.654]  My rule is if I buy it and I like it, I promote it.
[02:28:40.094 --> 02:28:42.437]  And let me tell you, my family has had the longevity stuff.
[02:28:42.437 --> 02:28:44.259]  My wife is addicted to it.
[02:28:44.259 --> 02:28:46.261]  It really is incredibly powerful and great.
[02:28:46.261 --> 02:28:54.270]  And folks can, by the way, as individuals, sign up and get a discount to be able to buy it even cheaper at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:28:54.270 --> 02:28:57.093]  And the profit from it also goes to support our broadcast.
[02:28:57.093 --> 02:29:00.397]  But then you can start selling it to your friends and family
[02:29:00.917 --> 02:29:08.880]  And this is just old-fashioned business, or you can just buy the stuff at Infowarsteam.com and not sign up like Costco to get the discount.
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:14.921]  But getting back to this, so they pull your big show, so you launch your own syndicated show, and please continue.
[02:29:14.921 --> 02:29:16.662]  No, I already had the syndicated show.
[02:29:16.662 --> 02:29:18.022]  That's Dead Doctors Don't Lie.
[02:29:18.022 --> 02:29:22.804]  That was already in operation for four or five years when that happened.
[02:29:23.745 --> 02:29:31.951]  Long story short here, we did just fine without the major syndicated property.
[02:29:31.951 --> 02:29:35.934]  But you got the big host back anyways, right?
[02:29:35.934 --> 02:29:36.494]  We did!
[02:29:36.494 --> 02:29:40.957]  We did get the big host back because they failed on the smaller Pipsqueak station.
[02:29:40.957 --> 02:29:45.361]  Michael, we've got a lot of big stations listening, our mom and pops, all the great folks listening.
[02:29:45.361 --> 02:29:50.845]  Go through what you would do if you were them when we come back so they can survive and thrive.
[02:29:51.405 --> 02:29:55.333]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.333 --> 02:29:58.018]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.276 --> 02:30:06.277]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:06.277 --> 02:30:09.518]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.518 --> 02:30:14.680]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:20.701]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.701 --> 02:30:22.942]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.502 --> 02:30:24.983]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:30:24.983 --> 02:30:26.263]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:26.263 --> 02:30:28.504]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:49.671]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:32:00.712 --> 02:32:08.835]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:32:08.835 --> 02:32:11.376]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:11.376 --> 02:32:16.758]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:16.758 --> 02:32:19.799]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:19.799 --> 02:32:22.120]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:22.120 --> 02:32:26.402]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[02:32:26.442 --> 02:32:26.802]  I don't know.

[02:32:51.985 --> 02:32:54.567]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:32:54.567 --> 02:32:58.431]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:58.431 --> 02:32:59.452]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:33:02.824 --> 02:33:04.725]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:33:04.725 --> 02:33:06.105]  A lie!
[02:33:06.105 --> 02:33:08.105]  No man is obsolete!
[02:33:08.105 --> 02:33:09.966]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:33:09.966 --> 02:33:13.207]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[02:33:13.207 --> 02:33:18.668]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[02:33:18.668 --> 02:33:20.349]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:33:20.349 --> 02:33:21.409]  A crawling insect!
[02:33:22.109 --> 02:33:26.515]  Ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[02:33:26.515 --> 02:33:28.037]  I am a human being!
[02:33:28.037 --> 02:33:35.786]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[02:33:35.786 --> 02:33:36.928]  I don't care!
[02:33:36.928 --> 02:33:38.490]  I tell you, I don't care!
[02:33:38.490 --> 02:33:39.531]  I'm a human being!
[02:33:39.531 --> 02:33:40.031]  I exist!
[02:33:41.095 --> 02:33:47.219]  If I speak one for a log, that log lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[02:33:47.219 --> 02:33:50.381]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:33:50.381 --> 02:33:58.066]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[02:33:58.066 --> 02:34:03.369]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and mistake has no use for your kind!
[02:34:05.109 --> 02:34:09.191]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:34:09.191 --> 02:34:12.173]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:12.173 --> 02:34:13.474]  Oh, we are back live.
[02:34:13.474 --> 02:34:16.996]  I don't think I've ever done an hour of radio quite like this.
[02:34:16.996 --> 02:34:20.898]  And we'll shift gears into some news and your calls here in a little while.
[02:34:20.898 --> 02:34:23.880]  But it was my idea to get Michael swirling on.
[02:34:24.500 --> 02:34:39.272]  Because, you know, you go to a big radio function, radio managers, owners from all over the country, they want to come over and talk to Michael Swerling because they know how successful he's been in the ratings, in profits, and of course he sells out his advertising too.
[02:34:39.272 --> 02:34:41.334]  And he's got the big audience, and even though they took...
[02:34:42.294 --> 02:34:42.695]  I think so.
[02:35:02.967 --> 02:35:09.431]  Ten dollars a month, or just get discounts on high quality vitamins and minerals, sign up at InfoWars.team.
[02:35:09.431 --> 02:35:10.632]  InfoWars.team.
[02:35:10.632 --> 02:35:11.152]  Absolutely.
[02:35:11.152 --> 02:35:12.453]  InfoWars.team.com.
[02:35:12.453 --> 02:35:13.774]  I suddenly can't talk today.
[02:35:13.774 --> 02:35:16.395]  InfoWars.team.com.
[02:35:16.395 --> 02:35:20.278]  But at the same time, when you go to www.InfoWars.team.com,
[02:35:22.919 --> 02:35:30.901]  You can also, again, sign up to become a distributor, an affiliate of it, and you can get big discounts on the products, and also sell the products to others.
[02:35:30.901 --> 02:35:36.963]  Now, what I've done is I just gave it to family, I guess about eight, nine months ago now, and they're actually smart enough to take it.
[02:35:36.963 --> 02:35:41.884]  I've never been a vitamin person, so I'm just making myself do it, and I feel it every time I do.
[02:35:41.884 --> 02:35:49.686]  But to make a long story short, my parents love it, Rob Jacobson loves it, Aaron loves it, my wife loves it, everybody absolutely
[02:35:50.686 --> 02:35:51.127]  Love it!
[02:36:10.746 --> 02:36:21.195]  This is great for individuals, but for a radio station, this is something really great because they've got an audience who's going to love the products, who can also become affiliates themselves.
[02:36:21.195 --> 02:36:24.277]  An audience all ready to leverage.
[02:36:24.277 --> 02:36:24.818]  It's great!
[02:36:25.731 --> 02:36:26.291]  It's great.
[02:36:26.291 --> 02:36:29.634]  Yeah, break it down for folks how you've been successful.
[02:36:29.634 --> 02:36:32.236]  It's real simple, Alex.
[02:36:32.236 --> 02:36:40.641]  The smartest thing a radio station, large or small, should do is become an affiliate of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:42.783 --> 02:36:46.265]  Which, by the way, is the best-kept secret in the broadcast industry.
[02:36:46.265 --> 02:36:48.306]  I've got to correct you a little bit.
[02:36:48.306 --> 02:36:52.649]  I didn't find out about you as the up-and-coming thing from the broadcast industry.
[02:36:52.649 --> 02:36:57.692]  You, Alex Jones, are the best-kept secret in the broadcast industry.
[02:36:58.152 --> 02:36:59.594]  Most of which is pretty clueless.
[02:36:59.594 --> 02:37:03.018]  You just told me that radio exec guy that when you first called me that you really respected.
[02:37:03.018 --> 02:37:04.479]  I wasn't a radio exec.
[02:37:04.479 --> 02:37:10.406]  It was a radio consultant who said to me, the smartest thing you can do, MZ, is put Alex Jones.
[02:37:10.406 --> 02:37:11.447]  I said, Alex Jones?
[02:37:11.447 --> 02:37:12.148]  I've interviewed him.
[02:37:12.148 --> 02:37:13.430]  He's a great interviewer.
[02:37:13.430 --> 02:37:15.131]  I've had him on my show a couple of times.
[02:37:15.652 --> 02:37:18.194]  You're a great interviewer, and I knew that you had your own show.
[02:37:18.194 --> 02:37:19.415]  In fact, I met that fellow.
[02:37:19.415 --> 02:37:21.156]  He'd been a station owner, too, correct?
[02:37:21.156 --> 02:37:22.037]  No, no, no.
[02:37:22.037 --> 02:37:23.538]  Never an owner.
[02:37:23.538 --> 02:37:32.085]  He was and is a consultant to other radio stations, and he said to me, Michael, you have always been a trailblazer.
[02:37:32.085 --> 02:37:35.627]  You're a person who likes to experiment and do things differently.
[02:37:35.627 --> 02:37:37.109]  This will be a great thing.
[02:37:37.109 --> 02:37:39.731]  If you listen to me, you're going to be very, very happy.
[02:37:39.731 --> 02:37:42.193]  Put Alex Jones on your station.
[02:37:43.713 --> 02:37:50.295]  We had a slot to fill anyhow, because Bill O'Reilly announced that he was leaving talk radio.
[02:37:50.295 --> 02:37:51.856]  Sort of like the opposite of Rush Limbaugh.
[02:37:51.856 --> 02:37:55.737]  Rush did great in radio and continues, but not too well in television.
[02:37:55.737 --> 02:37:57.237]  It's just the opposite with Bill O'Reilly.
[02:37:57.237 --> 02:38:00.278]  He did great with television, but not too well in radio.
[02:38:00.278 --> 02:38:01.278]  Never got many ratings.
[02:38:01.278 --> 02:38:09.961]  So, he decided to hang up his guns, and when that was announced, because we were on an affiliate list, every syndicator in the world was calling us saying,
[02:38:10.521 --> 02:38:14.343]  What are you going to do at KSEO to replace Bill O'Reilly?
[02:38:14.343 --> 02:38:15.764]  And I said, we're going to do something local.
[02:38:15.764 --> 02:38:18.965]  And I said, oh, you could hear a thud.
[02:38:18.965 --> 02:38:22.667]  Because no one replaces one syndicated program with local.
[02:38:22.667 --> 02:38:24.668]  They go the other direction.
[02:38:24.668 --> 02:38:26.309]  But we're just sort of different.
[02:38:26.309 --> 02:38:31.831]  Anyhow, Glenn said to me, he said, do you know who the local person is yet?
[02:38:31.831 --> 02:38:32.492]  And I said, no.
[02:38:32.492 --> 02:38:35.093]  He says, do an experiment like you like to do.
[02:38:35.093 --> 02:38:37.314]  Put Alex Jones on and see what happens.
[02:38:37.314 --> 02:38:38.835]  You're going to be amazed at what happens.
[02:38:39.671 --> 02:38:50.159]  You know, within two or three days of putting you on as an experiment, someone, uh, I was walking out of the radio station and a stranger walked up to me and said, are you MZ?
[02:38:50.159 --> 02:38:51.920]  And I said, yeah.
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:56.644]  And he said, uh, he reaches out to shake my hand and he puts a hundred dollar bill in my hand.
[02:38:57.364 --> 02:38:58.906]  And I said, what's this?
[02:38:58.906 --> 02:39:00.869]  He says, that's for putting Alex Jones on the radio.
[02:39:00.869 --> 02:39:02.011]  I said, it's just an experiment.
[02:39:02.011 --> 02:39:04.414]  We don't even know if it's going to be permanent here.
[02:39:04.414 --> 02:39:09.641]  He says, the very fact that you put him on for even an hour, you deserve this money.
[02:39:09.641 --> 02:39:11.264]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[02:39:11.264 --> 02:39:14.148]  Anyhow, really powerful, dramatic stuff.
[02:39:14.588 --> 02:39:21.716]  And that was a year and a half before you came and spoke at the Coconut Grove and people from all over the world.
[02:39:21.716 --> 02:39:34.869]  I think the farthest person that I know of who flew in to watch you speak and pay $10.80 or were at AM 1080 on the dial, so we made the tickets really inexpensive, flew in from somewhere in Ireland.
[02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:42.812]  Well, that's the thing, and I know that's why from insiders at Talk Radio Network, they record my show every day.
[02:39:42.812 --> 02:39:49.954]  I've been told some people that work at Talk Radio Network, high level, they record it and it's sent to the head guys, and they're not sure what they're doing with it.
[02:39:49.954 --> 02:39:55.396]  And I know Claire Channel keeps tabs on us and things, and I'm not even that good of a talk show host.
[02:39:55.396 --> 02:40:00.538]  It's just the information is real, it's powerful, and folks understand that.
[02:40:00.538 --> 02:40:03.739]  If you did a gardening show, it would be the best gardening show.
[02:40:03.739 --> 02:40:04.979]  I'm not going to smoke out.
[02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:08.201]  I'm just being truthful.
[02:40:08.201 --> 02:40:09.361]  You have passion.
[02:40:09.361 --> 02:40:10.622]  You have spirit.
[02:40:10.622 --> 02:40:12.623]  You have truth.
[02:40:12.623 --> 02:40:15.645]  You have belief in what you're all about.
[02:40:15.645 --> 02:40:19.768]  And that's why you're successful.
[02:40:19.768 --> 02:40:22.209]  With or without the broadcasting industry.
[02:40:22.209 --> 02:40:28.613]  Now it's true that the broadcasting industry still has many, many, many, many, many millions of people listening to it.
[02:40:29.033 --> 02:40:39.778]  That's why I want to help other broadcasters who don't know what the hell to do, including the KGOs of the world that are going down the toilet as we speak, to know that there's something new and different.
[02:40:39.778 --> 02:40:42.780]  Anyhow... We're going to tell them about that in a moment, but just going back...
[02:40:44.522 --> 02:40:53.470]  Because time just flies, and I was saying I've been on your stations for, because you've got two, for a year and a half, but I guess it's been a lot longer than that.
[02:40:53.470 --> 02:40:55.332]  How long have I been on there?
[02:40:55.332 --> 02:41:00.377]  Since April or May of 2009, so it's over two years now.
[02:41:00.377 --> 02:41:02.779]  Wow, time just flies.
[02:41:02.779 --> 02:41:06.782]  But I'll tell you a brief story, because my parents are really starting to get blown away.
[02:41:08.123 --> 02:41:14.865]  Because now, through the internet and everything else, and I'm not bragging, I mean, it's just to point out the effect of this broadcast.
[02:41:14.865 --> 02:41:23.528]  Now, anywhere I go, whether it's England, Central America, Canada, Austin, Texas, everywhere I go I get stopped.
[02:41:23.528 --> 02:41:28.810]  And sometimes I get mobbed by people to the point of where I got 20 people around me.
[02:41:28.810 --> 02:41:30.851]  But my dad is going on a road trip
[02:41:31.883 --> 02:41:45.546]  Next week with my mother and he called a motel in the middle of nowhere on the Texas Oklahoma border to see about staying there.
[02:41:45.546 --> 02:41:48.927]  This is just last week and to make a reservation.
[02:41:48.927 --> 02:41:52.768]  And the woman said, OK, give me your info, your zip code.
[02:41:52.768 --> 02:41:53.448]  And when he said
[02:41:54.949 --> 02:41:55.769]  Do you like Alex Jones?
[02:42:15.454 --> 02:42:21.739]  With great power comes great responsibility, and we really are reaching millions of new people a week.
[02:42:21.739 --> 02:42:24.540]  Not just our 3-4 million regular listeners.
[02:42:24.540 --> 02:42:37.329]  We're reaching millions of new people a week, and the message is so unorthodox from the mainline liberal conservative false spectrum, you know, inside-the-box system, that it's just incredible.
[02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:38.049]  But enough about me!
[02:42:38.049 --> 02:42:46.093]  Because of what has actually happened, Alex, in the last year that no one would have ever believed possible, even yourself, probably.
[02:42:46.093 --> 02:43:00.299]  You know, people are much more open to the message that it ain't about liberal versus conservative, it ain't about Democrats versus Republicans, it's about pure control of the serfs by government and big business.
[02:43:00.299 --> 02:43:01.760]  That's your message, in a nutshell.
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:02.360]  Yes.
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:04.081]  And that is the absolute truth.
[02:43:04.921 --> 02:43:17.650]  Absolutely, and no matter what we do, put in Bush gets worse, put in Obama gets worse, and it comes down to the big mega-corporations that control government, the anti-capitalist crony monopolists.
[02:43:17.650 --> 02:43:21.393]  But enough of me, because I want to get to some other news and calls here.
[02:43:21.393 --> 02:43:26.377]  I mean, speaking directly to the station owners, managers, and others, if they go to the InfoWars team,
[02:43:26.937 --> 02:43:28.739]  Become an affiliate of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:28.739 --> 02:43:32.344]  We also have pharmacist Ben Fuchs' The Bright Side program.
[02:43:32.344 --> 02:43:34.306]  Fabulous information about health.
[02:43:34.306 --> 02:43:40.553]  Here's a very learned pharmacist who spends three or four hours a day reading and boning up.
[02:43:40.553 --> 02:43:41.735]  The guy is absolutely amazing.
[02:43:41.735 --> 02:43:42.436]  He's charismatic.
[02:43:42.436 --> 02:43:43.236]  He has his own show.
[02:43:44.017 --> 02:43:45.559]  Uh, that is broadcast every week.
[02:43:45.559 --> 02:43:49.342]  By the way, he's getting really popular in Austin because he's on here.
[02:43:49.342 --> 02:43:58.349]  And everybody I know is raving, including medical doctors, because pharmacist Ben Fuchs' knowledge of chemistry of the human body is so incredible.
[02:43:58.349 --> 02:44:00.551]  He's got a lot of doctors listening to him.
[02:44:00.551 --> 02:44:01.912]  That guy is going to be big.
[02:44:02.412 --> 02:44:05.476]  Yeah, no, for sure, and you're helping make that happen.
[02:44:05.476 --> 02:44:14.108]  And also, of course, there's Doc Wallach himself, the original Dead Doctors Don't Lie guy, and we've been syndicating his program since September of 1996.
[02:44:14.108 --> 02:44:19.515]  You know, thanks to my mother, of all people, when she first heard him, she said,
[02:44:20.576 --> 02:44:23.299]  By the way, she's 90 years old going on 40.
[02:44:23.299 --> 02:44:24.700]  And she just published her first book.
[02:44:24.700 --> 02:44:25.281]  It's amazing.
[02:44:25.281 --> 02:44:36.791]  But back when she first heard Dr. Wallach on our station, she called me up and she said, I don't know who this guy is, but he's got an amazing message and you need to, you know, you need to somehow get involved with him.
[02:44:36.791 --> 02:44:39.293]  And I said, geez, we're doing great.
[02:44:39.293 --> 02:44:41.375]  I mean, he's our biggest advertiser now.
[02:44:41.375 --> 02:44:43.337]  So nevermind.
[02:44:43.337 --> 02:44:45.359]  Get involved in helping him spread his message.
[02:44:45.359 --> 02:44:46.279]  My mom's really smart.
[02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:48.162]  No, she is.
[02:44:48.162 --> 02:44:51.806]  She's sharp as a tack, or sharp as a razor blade.
[02:44:51.806 --> 02:44:55.731]  So you've got those shows to syndicate through Genesis, through your operation.
[02:44:55.731 --> 02:45:04.563]  Also, again, stations go and they sign up at InfoWarsTeam.com to be affiliates, and then we'll cut liners for them, commercials.
[02:45:05.023 --> 02:45:17.157]  They can still sell commercials like they always have, but if they don't sell anything, if they have an audience, the money's going to come and it's going to be... It sure sells... What do I say?
[02:45:17.157 --> 02:45:24.545]  One of our affiliates said, I like the program, but it sure beats selling 30 and 60 second spots.
[02:45:25.645 --> 02:45:32.008]  I have a little website that I started years ago called FireYourSalesStaff.com.
[02:45:32.008 --> 02:45:34.029]  FireYourSalesStaff.com.
[02:45:34.029 --> 02:45:37.650]  You don't even need a sales tab if you do this, if you have an audience.
[02:45:37.650 --> 02:45:39.411]  If you don't have an audience, you're not going to make any money.
[02:45:39.411 --> 02:45:47.394]  But if you have an audience, it's getting tougher and tougher and tougher to sell advertising, which it is for everyone thanks to Google and the Internet, right?
[02:45:47.394 --> 02:45:47.615]  Yes.
[02:45:48.775 --> 02:45:57.025]  It's getting harder and harder to sell advertising in the newspapers and magazines, in television and in radio, you know?
[02:45:57.025 --> 02:46:03.091]  You don't need to sell advertising if you leverage your audience, if you have a good-sized audience to leverage.
[02:46:03.592 --> 02:46:04.453]  Check this down, folks.
[02:46:04.453 --> 02:46:05.813]  Sign up at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:46:05.813 --> 02:46:12.858]  We're going to give station managers, owners, and individuals, if they're serious, MZ's email.
[02:46:12.858 --> 02:46:14.179]  And he is the coordinator.
[02:46:14.179 --> 02:46:15.700]  I'm also working on it.
[02:46:15.700 --> 02:46:19.142]  And I actually drafted him in because I said, look, you're the guy that really knows this.
[02:46:19.142 --> 02:46:21.964]  This is overwhelming us, all the folks.
[02:46:21.964 --> 02:46:25.546]  We want the best leader in there to really help out our stations.
[02:46:25.546 --> 02:46:28.849]  And so MZ has come in to help us even more, even though it was his idea.
[02:46:28.849 --> 02:46:30.990]  InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:46:30.990 --> 02:46:32.211]  I want to explain something to people.
[02:46:33.391 --> 02:46:43.676]  If you read the Wall Street Journal, if you research what's happening, one of the only growth sectors other than government is Walgreens and Savons and CVSs.
[02:46:43.676 --> 02:46:46.397]  They're building them out in the middle of nowhere in the countryside.
[02:46:46.397 --> 02:46:48.378]  We have an aging population.
[02:46:48.378 --> 02:46:51.879]  Half the ads on TV and radio are these drug ads.
[02:46:51.879 --> 02:46:53.940]  Most of it toxic garbage.
[02:46:53.940 --> 02:47:01.504]  All you're doing is seeing that market and offering people super high quality, full spectrum vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids.
[02:47:02.464 --> 02:47:05.726]  Melatonin, colloidal silver, whatever the best product is.
[02:47:05.726 --> 02:47:07.347]  This is a big company, folks.
[02:47:07.347 --> 02:47:12.849]  They've bought up everything that they love and think is great out there and passionately believe in it.
[02:47:12.849 --> 02:47:17.092]  It's all listed at InfoWarsTeam.com and that's what they've done.
[02:47:17.092 --> 02:47:21.654]  They've put it all there together and so you see the only other growth area out there
[02:47:22.234 --> 02:47:28.837]  Are these drug stores and most of what they're selling is absolute big pharma garbage?
[02:47:28.837 --> 02:47:39.401]  Well, instead, we're saying to radio stations and to individuals or to other businesses or other companies who are into sales, get on board at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:47:39.401 --> 02:47:40.502]  Go there, sign up.
[02:47:40.902 --> 02:47:41.102]  I think?
[02:47:56.155 --> 02:48:06.365]  Getting America moving again and not giving the whole market share to Big Pharma and Walgreens and CVS and the rest of them to push Prozac and mercury filled shots.
[02:48:06.365 --> 02:48:09.928]  This stuff is absolutely incredible products.
[02:48:09.928 --> 02:48:11.230]  So if you're individuals,
[02:48:12.090 --> 02:48:17.412]  Or whether you're a radio station, whatever the case is, Infowarsteam.com.
[02:48:17.412 --> 02:48:33.296]  Now, Michael, if business people, if sales folks, if people want to make $100 a month or they want to try to make six, seven figures, whatever the case is, radio stations are tailor-made for this and it'll support local stations and get them out from under these big monopolies if they sign up.
[02:48:33.296 --> 02:48:40.138]  Who needs to contact you specifically via email or tell folks how simple it is to sign up at Infowarsteam.com?
[02:48:40.938 --> 02:48:45.382]  The general, I can give my email address directly now if you want.
[02:48:45.382 --> 02:48:46.303]  Yeah, give it out.
[02:48:46.303 --> 02:48:52.729]  Okay, it's mz at ksco.com.
[02:48:52.729 --> 02:48:59.415]  Mz at k, k as in kilo, s as in Sam, c as in Charles, o as in Oscar.
[02:48:59.415 --> 02:49:01.877]  Mz at ksco.com.
[02:49:01.877 --> 02:49:02.458]  And by the way,
[02:49:03.158 --> 02:49:12.404]  If you don't happen to be a radio station owner or general manager or decision maker who decides what programs to put on the radio, but you know of somebody...
[02:49:13.610 --> 02:49:16.731]  Let us know, because we'll involve you too!
[02:49:16.731 --> 02:49:17.752]  No problem.
[02:49:17.752 --> 02:49:28.036]  You can email me at mz at ksco.com or you can actually email me, it'll land at the same place, mz at infowarsteam.com.
[02:49:28.036 --> 02:49:30.677]  mz at infowarsteam.com.
[02:49:30.677 --> 02:49:38.460]  When you go to InfoWars Team, if you want to try the products, you can click on the big button on the right.
[02:49:38.780 --> 02:49:39.261]  I think so.
[02:49:57.697 --> 02:50:07.724]  If all you want to do is try the products, just click the button on the right and just become a wholesale buyer and you'll be able to buy it at the lowest possible price to begin with.
[02:50:07.724 --> 02:50:13.588]  But if you think you might want to make this a business, and I've got to tell you, it's an amazing business.
[02:50:13.588 --> 02:50:17.771]  Whether or not you own a radio station, it's a great business.
[02:50:17.771 --> 02:50:21.493]  Alex, you know the answer to this.
[02:50:21.493 --> 02:50:22.854]  Everybody knows the answer to this.
[02:50:22.854 --> 02:50:26.476]  What is the best form of advertising, traditionally, always?
[02:50:26.476 --> 02:50:27.297]  Person-to-person.
[02:50:28.217 --> 02:50:30.179]  Yeah, word of mouth, same thing.
[02:50:30.179 --> 02:50:32.240]  Person to person, exactly.
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:33.401]  What is this?
[02:50:33.401 --> 02:50:34.522]  What is talk radio?
[02:50:34.522 --> 02:50:37.304]  It's mass word of mouth advertising.
[02:50:37.304 --> 02:50:38.344]  What is Alex Jones?
[02:50:38.344 --> 02:50:40.726]  What is Pharmacist Ben Brightside?
[02:50:40.726 --> 02:50:44.148]  What is Dr. Joel Wallach on Dead Doctors Don't Lie?
[02:50:44.148 --> 02:50:53.235]  Both of these are live interactive programs that can be called by anybody with any kind of a health question or any kind of a political... It's tailor-made for talk radio.
[02:50:54.076 --> 02:50:56.979]  And again, folks, you don't even have to carry the shows to be an affiliate of this.
[02:50:56.979 --> 02:50:58.581]  You can just run the ads.
[02:50:58.581 --> 02:50:59.763]  InfoWorksTeam.com.
[02:50:59.763 --> 02:51:01.325]  Stay with us to take a few calls.
[02:51:01.325 --> 02:51:05.170]  Are you tired of spending money for metal canning lids year after year?
[02:51:05.170 --> 02:51:06.352]  Then stop!

[02:51:17.262 --> 02:51:21.265]  Traditional metal lids are single use throwaways that contain BPA.

[02:52:02.964 --> 02:52:04.184]  This is not a drill.
[02:52:04.184 --> 02:52:06.705]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:52:06.705 --> 02:52:08.606]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:52:08.606 --> 02:52:15.808]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:52:15.808 --> 02:52:20.209]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.

[02:52:39.578 --> 02:52:40.278]  But listen up.
[02:52:40.278 --> 02:52:46.523]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:52:46.523 --> 02:52:48.364]  Go to HideYourGuns.com.
[02:52:48.364 --> 02:52:50.525]  That's HideYourGuns.com.
[02:52:50.525 --> 02:52:51.406]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:52:51.406 --> 02:52:53.827]  Before they come for your guns.
[02:52:53.827 --> 02:52:54.948]  HideYourGuns.com.
[02:52:54.948 --> 02:52:55.308]  Right now.
[02:53:00.726 --> 02:53:01.287]  I don't know.

[02:53:57.286 --> 02:54:07.254]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:11.795 --> 02:54:18.278]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the main radio broadcast is going to end in five minutes, and I'm just going to give you five minutes of overdrive.
[02:54:18.278 --> 02:54:23.220]  It's internet only at PrisonPlanet.tv and audio streams at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:23.220 --> 02:54:26.481]  There's a special, just so we can get to some of your calls, there's a special
[02:54:27.902 --> 02:54:31.848]  InfoWars Report or InfoWars Special Report is its proper name.
[02:54:31.848 --> 02:54:43.225]  Tonight 7 o'clock with Aaron Dykes at PrisonPlanet.tv and yes we're taking most those reports and also then posting them for free for everybody at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[02:54:43.806 --> 02:54:55.976]  Our latest with Max Keiser and Paul Watson that's gone super viral on the web is titled London Burning Info War Special Report on Social Unrest and Economic Collapse with Max Keiser and Paul Watson.
[02:54:55.976 --> 02:54:57.537]  We've done four or five of these now.
[02:54:57.537 --> 02:54:59.119]  You notice each one gets better.
[02:54:59.119 --> 02:55:05.864]  These are quite frankly public rehearsals for the mainline news show that we're launching September 1st.
[02:55:05.864 --> 02:55:06.825]  30 minutes a night.
[02:55:06.825 --> 02:55:11.108]  We'll also have extended special reports and we're reaching
[02:55:12.148 --> 02:55:14.249]  Just on this channel, a couple million people a week.
[02:55:14.249 --> 02:55:17.530]  On the other channels, about 4 million a week on YouTube.
[02:55:17.530 --> 02:55:21.532]  On the other video channels, doing an aggregate check, about another 2 million.
[02:55:21.532 --> 02:55:26.453]  So that's 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7 million a week.
[02:55:26.453 --> 02:55:32.656]  Not counting all the other video sites, we're reaching about 3 million a week on the radio, commercial terrestrial radio.
[02:55:32.656 --> 02:55:36.137]  And we're reaching a couple million a week on audio streams and podcasts.
[02:55:36.137 --> 02:55:37.998]  It's about a half million a day just on the podcast.
[02:55:39.179 --> 02:55:43.864]  It's big, and it's only growing faster and faster, but we need your support.
[02:55:43.864 --> 02:55:47.048]  And so we try to sell you products that we believe in.
[02:55:47.048 --> 02:55:48.650]  So it's a win-win-win-win-win.
[02:55:48.650 --> 02:55:55.457]  But getting out of that subject, I hope folks will sign up at InfoWarsTeam.com, and I appreciate Michael Zwirling and all the great advice he's given me.
[02:55:56.138 --> 02:55:56.318]  Uh, Alex?
[02:56:16.109 --> 02:56:17.129]  Yeah, hi.
[02:56:17.129 --> 02:56:19.750]  I'd like to cover two things, if I could.
[02:56:19.750 --> 02:56:23.331]  One is my own, and the other one is my wife's.
[02:56:23.331 --> 02:56:30.853]  I run a very large trucking website, and I get about 140,000 visitors a month.
[02:56:30.853 --> 02:56:39.295]  And I did some digging into this NAFTA superhighway stuff about a year ago, and this relates to jobs, really.
[02:56:40.975 --> 02:56:42.296]  There's a real problem.
[02:56:42.296 --> 02:56:44.136]  I mean, we got a huge problem.
[02:56:44.136 --> 02:56:47.957]  I mean, these guys... Oh, they're putting ships in everything, tracking you.
[02:56:47.957 --> 02:56:52.958]  They're going to make all the trucks out of Mexico not be by the same rules, but be able to come in.
[02:56:52.958 --> 02:57:06.201]  Again, it's about the globalists, just like with milk 50 years ago, coming in, buying it up, putting regulations in to shut down real milk producers, shut down independent truckers or even American companies, shut down local radio stations.
[02:57:06.201 --> 02:57:07.361]  MZ comments on this.
[02:57:08.653 --> 02:57:09.814]  Comments on what?
[02:57:09.814 --> 02:57:10.775]  About shutting down?
[02:57:10.775 --> 02:57:13.578]  Well, just the total consolidation across the board.
[02:57:13.578 --> 02:57:16.842]  Oh, yeah, that's... It's awful.
[02:57:16.842 --> 02:57:28.013]  I mean, the FCC happened to, three or four years ago, come and have a public hearing on how to increase diversity and localism.
[02:57:28.013 --> 02:57:30.195]  And I said, I got up and spoke,
[02:57:30.956 --> 02:57:32.777]  And I said, it's obvious.
[02:57:32.777 --> 02:57:42.341]  You know, go back to the original rules about no one station can own more than one AM or one FM and one FM in the same market.
[02:57:42.341 --> 02:57:46.863]  Well, now it's admitted that the big major syndicators are all on the verge of collapse.
[02:57:46.863 --> 02:57:49.844]  So their own system, like the megabanks, has destroyed them.
[02:57:49.844 --> 02:57:51.665]  So maybe it'll go back to that.
[02:57:51.665 --> 02:57:53.285]  Ron, sorry to interrupt you.
[02:57:53.285 --> 02:57:54.626]  Finish up your point about the trucks.
[02:57:55.387 --> 02:57:58.048]  No problem.
[02:57:58.048 --> 02:58:11.431]  There's Asian shipping companies that are putting together this Mexico Superport, which in turn is being coordinated by an organization called nascocarter.com.
[02:58:11.431 --> 02:58:14.472]  And they set up the inland ports that are tax-free.
[02:58:14.472 --> 02:58:20.954]  And if you go down to, that's over on the Pacific Southern side of Mexico, that giant, biggest port in the world it's going to be, brother.
[02:58:21.949 --> 02:58:23.830]  And it's going to decimate California.
[02:58:23.830 --> 02:58:26.551]  California has a $30 billion a year port business.
[02:58:26.551 --> 02:58:31.053]  Hey, Californians, if they don't wake up to the New World Order, we're all destroyed.
[02:58:31.053 --> 02:58:32.233]  Thank you so much, Ron.
[02:58:32.233 --> 02:58:33.354]  Yeah, I should cover that more.
[02:58:33.354 --> 02:58:34.634]  We covered my film Endgame.
[02:58:34.634 --> 02:58:36.175]  Okay, main broadcast is over.
[02:58:36.175 --> 02:58:37.256]  Great job to the crew.
[02:58:37.256 --> 02:58:38.256]  See you back tomorrow live.
[02:58:38.256 --> 02:58:44.239]  I'm going to come back to Internet Only with a few more callers in Swirling.
[02:58:44.239 --> 02:58:47.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.480 --> 02:58:49.401]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.604 --> 02:58:54.927]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:58:54.927 --> 02:58:59.531]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long-term storable food business.
[02:58:59.531 --> 02:59:06.698]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price
[02:59:06.778 --> 02:59:07.078]  I don't know.
[02:59:28.527 --> 02:59:29.127]  I think so.
[02:59:52.045 --> 02:59:55.655]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.655 --> 02:59:58.863]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:07.236 --> 03:00:09.978]  Here's how the media is spinning this.
[03:00:09.978 --> 03:00:16.583]  Wired Magazine, American airline pilots allowed to dodge security screening.
[03:00:16.583 --> 03:00:19.045]  They're not allowed to dodge it.
[03:00:19.045 --> 03:00:23.709]  Last year they said, you're not gonna grab our genitals, stick your hands down our pants, we go fly the airplanes.
[03:00:23.709 --> 03:00:26.310]  We don't need a bomb to kill everybody on board.
[03:00:27.568 --> 03:00:29.909]  You're not going to have some minimum wage person do that?
[03:00:29.909 --> 03:00:33.070]  Our union says, no, we're going to stop flying.
[03:00:33.070 --> 03:00:35.070]  And so the feds backed off.
[03:00:35.070 --> 03:00:37.471]  And the citizens need to start doing this.
[03:00:37.471 --> 03:00:40.932]  I'm going to shoot a special report on this later that will be out at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:44.028 --> 03:00:48.672]  Code name Michael Zwirling, great guy and I hope you join InfoWarsTeam.com.
[03:00:48.672 --> 03:00:59.100]  It's a great business opportunity to spread a message of high quality vitamins and minerals, the best out there, and a message of health against big pharma.
[03:00:59.100 --> 03:01:01.101]  I want to jam in a few more calls with you, MZ.
[03:01:01.101 --> 03:01:02.122]  How's that sound?
[03:01:02.122 --> 03:01:03.263]  Sounds good, Alex.
[03:01:03.263 --> 03:01:05.625]  Alright, let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania.
[03:01:05.625 --> 03:01:06.466]  Tom, you're on the air.
[03:01:07.247 --> 03:01:07.627]  Hey, Tom.
[03:01:07.627 --> 03:01:08.388]  Hey, gentlemen.
[03:01:08.388 --> 03:01:09.949]  How are you this afternoon?
[03:01:09.949 --> 03:01:10.870]  Good.
[03:01:10.870 --> 03:01:11.370]  Great.
[03:01:11.370 --> 03:01:20.396]  Listen, I just want to tell people, any new call, any new listeners listening, I've been interested in your program for going on 12 years now.
[03:01:20.396 --> 03:01:23.919]  And you know, you call your videos evergreen.
[03:01:23.919 --> 03:01:27.802]  I want to say, Mr. Jones, you yourself are evergreen.
[03:01:27.802 --> 03:01:34.907]  People that looked at me like I was a madman a decade ago are looking at me now and saying, this is insane.
[03:01:34.907 --> 03:01:36.127]  I can't believe what's happening.
[03:01:37.388 --> 03:01:41.011]  I'm really not that shocked by any of this anymore.
[03:01:41.011 --> 03:01:44.253]  I also want to say, your message is on point.
[03:01:44.253 --> 03:01:51.918]  When I first started listening to you, I've called in a few times and, you know, was able to get right in, right on in about 10-15 minutes, brother.
[03:01:51.918 --> 03:01:55.720]  I've been on hold for two hours now, worth every single minute.
[03:01:55.720 --> 03:01:57.802]  Well, you're nice to put into that, Ron.
[03:01:57.802 --> 03:01:58.702]  I'll be honest with you.
[03:02:01.730 --> 03:02:04.032]  I've always just tried to tell the truth.
[03:02:04.032 --> 03:02:09.216]  But if I've done anything wrong, it's I've held back what I really believed.
[03:02:09.216 --> 03:02:12.438]  And I wish that our message wasn't all coming true now.
[03:02:12.438 --> 03:02:13.179]  But you're right.
[03:02:13.179 --> 03:02:21.525]  That's what's so amazing about this broadcast now is that so many tens of millions of people heard us and thought we were nuts.
[03:02:21.525 --> 03:02:24.888]  Now they're coming back and finding us because they're seeing things come true.
[03:02:26.255 --> 03:02:27.256]  Absolutely, sir.
[03:02:27.256 --> 03:02:28.337]  Absolutely.
[03:02:28.337 --> 03:02:32.961]  And I just want to touch on you with your complaining and moaning about being tired.
[03:02:32.961 --> 03:02:35.663]  Brother, if you're not in the fight, you're not tired, man.
[03:02:35.663 --> 03:02:36.323]  You know what I mean?
[03:02:36.323 --> 03:02:38.205]  Have a great afternoon, sir.
[03:02:38.205 --> 03:02:38.745]  Absolutely.
[03:02:38.745 --> 03:02:40.467]  You know, I shouldn't moan on air.
[03:02:40.467 --> 03:02:41.608]  I don't do it very often.
[03:02:41.608 --> 03:02:48.893]  I'm just so honest that if I forget to eat or forget to take my tangy tangerine or whatever, and I'm up working late at night,
[03:02:49.674 --> 03:02:52.017]  Or it might have been going to my mom's birthday party last night.
[03:02:52.017 --> 03:02:53.398]  I shouldn't have had that champagne.
[03:02:53.398 --> 03:02:54.119]  White wine, folks.
[03:02:54.119 --> 03:02:54.680]  Give me a break.
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:02:56.602]  A few glasses of it, instant headache.
[03:02:56.602 --> 03:03:02.769]  And I was like, man, I need to take a vacation ahead of the really crazy times that are about to take place.
[03:03:02.769 --> 03:03:04.611]  And you notice, folks, I don't really take vacations.
[03:03:05.111 --> 03:03:10.675]  I go on trips that are work-related, and all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[03:03:10.675 --> 03:03:12.156]  But thank you so much, Ron.
[03:03:12.156 --> 03:03:16.739]  I wish I had time to get to Tom, Verna, Julie, Kristen, and others.
[03:03:16.739 --> 03:03:18.941]  I apologize to everybody.
[03:03:18.941 --> 03:03:22.884]  In fact, John, if you get their names, I promise tomorrow.
[03:03:23.644 --> 03:03:29.085]  In the first hour, I will go to your calls first and hear what you had to say today, if you will call back in.
[03:03:29.085 --> 03:03:33.026]  That means John will give you a time, say at 1108 or something, to call in.
[03:03:33.026 --> 03:03:38.527]  He'll pick up the phone and we'll get to you, because I hate not talking to Verna and Julie.
[03:03:38.527 --> 03:03:40.167]  I've got a cousin named Verna.
[03:03:40.167 --> 03:03:42.228]  Kristen and others.
[03:03:42.228 --> 03:03:44.348]  We're going to get to all of you tomorrow.
[03:03:44.348 --> 03:03:46.309]  MZ, thank you for coming on with us today.
[03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:47.729]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:03:47.729 --> 03:03:48.089]  Great show.
[03:03:48.869 --> 03:03:50.951]  Hey, MZ, I've been trying to take more calls.
[03:03:50.951 --> 03:03:53.353]  People aren't telling me to do that, but I really enjoy the calls.
[03:03:53.353 --> 03:03:57.376]  Do you think I should take more calls?
[03:03:57.376 --> 03:04:08.846]  Yeah, but... How do you know ahead of time whether they're going to be more than just, you know... I think you're doing everything just exactly right.
[03:04:08.846 --> 03:04:14.451]  But when you tell people that we're going to get your calls and then we don't, then there's a reason.
[03:04:14.451 --> 03:04:15.752]  So what you just did is great.
[03:04:16.152 --> 03:04:18.353]  I'm getting a ton of emails already.
[03:04:33.695 --> 03:04:35.476]  I'm going to give you plenty of work.
[03:04:35.476 --> 03:04:36.336]  Yeah.
[03:04:36.336 --> 03:04:37.176]  Okay, Alex.
[03:04:37.176 --> 03:04:37.737]  Have a good one.
[03:04:37.737 --> 03:04:39.017]  It was great.
[03:04:39.017 --> 03:04:40.178]  MZ, you're awesome.
[03:04:40.178 --> 03:04:41.538]  Give us the email one more time.
[03:04:41.538 --> 03:04:45.300]  MZ at KSCO dot com.
[03:04:45.300 --> 03:04:49.061]  Either that, MZ at K... Here's the way we should do it.
[03:04:49.061 --> 03:04:54.003]  If it's a broadcaster, use MZ at KSCO dot com.
[03:04:54.003 --> 03:05:00.686]  If it's someone who's helping, who wants to help us, you know, get to broadcasters... MZ at Infowarsteam dot com.
[03:05:00.686 --> 03:05:00.946]  Thank you.
